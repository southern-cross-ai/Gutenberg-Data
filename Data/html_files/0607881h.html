<h3><a name="I_DISCOVER_MY_ISLAND" id="I_DISCOVER_MY_ISLAND"></a>I
DISCOVER MY ISLAND</h3>

<p>All was excitement that June morning among the clams of Jones's
Island (pronounced, by your leave, in two good healthy syllables,
thus: Jone'-zez). Softies by the bushel dug themselves deeper into
the shoreward mud, and whimpering little quahogs out in their watery
beds clung closer to their mothers as they heard the dread news
relayed by their kinsfolk of Seaman's Neck, Black Banks Channel,
Johnson's Flats and High Hill Crick. To say that uneasiness pervaded
the community would be putting it far too mildly. Those clams were
scared plumb out of a week's growth; which, as the clam flies, is a
lot of growth. In a word, panic reigned, if not pandemonium.</p>

<p>And well it might, for the scouts along the meadows, the deep
water observers and the liaison officers on the sandbars had
forwarded marine intelligence of no mean importance. As one clam they
reported the swift approach by rowboat across Great South Bay of a
sinister stranger, by every sign a very devil for chowder, raging and
roaring in the throes of starvation and flying the strange device,
"Jones's Island or Bust!" Yes, downright terror gripped even the
hardest of the clams. "He ought to be here at any moment!" shuddered
a visiting cherry-stone.</p>

<p>And see! Even now the hellish bark rounds Hawkins's Point,
splashes its desperate way through the shallows and crashes into
Savage's Dock with a sickening thud, hurling the oarsman from his
position amidships to a point which may be defined as galley-west.
Dizzily the skipper regains his feet, and as he rises to the general
view his singular and touching appearance sends thrills of relief up
and down the calcareous shells of the bivalves still on watch. Dame
Rumor is wrong again! Here is no demon with murder in his heart. Here
is no devil incarnate. For there in the full sunshine, the cynosure
of every clam, he weeps, the stranger weeps. Anon, he sneezes, and
again his eyes drip blinding tears. 'Tis plain some nobler grief than
the want of a square meal is bothering this chap. All told, it was
pretty pathetic.</p>

<p>The sorrowful newcomer seemed, truly, a man distrait, as he stood
there sniffling and snorting into his red bandanna, uttering violent
and wicked words, shaking his free fist at nothing in particular and
behaving generally as one bereft of all earthly solace and the
greater part of the cerebellum. (But don't get too much worked up
about this, dear reader; it turns out in a minute that it was only
me, arriving at Jones's Island with my rose cold.) Ever and again he
moved as though to cast himself and his afflictions into a low tide
puddle, always he drew back in time. Then, extracting a small compass
from his pocket, he made a few rapid calculations and, tossing a
stray lock from a thoughtful brow, began running due South. And as he
ran, he wept; and weeping, sneezed.</p>

<p>Some furlongs on his way, about where he would catch sight of
something blue and wonderful between the beach hills, he was heard to
shout, "<i>Thalassa! Thalassa!</i>" which is as much as to say in
plain English, "The sea!" and repeat. "<i>Eureka!</i>" he cried
next&mdash;"<i>Excelsior!</i>"&mdash;"<i>Gallia est omnis divisa in
partes tres!</i>" So, naturally, the clams, after thinking it over,
decided that he was perfectly harmless. Each happy shellfish,
according to his individual lights, sank back into a sort of nervous
lethargy or went about his own or his neighbor's business, forgetting
as best he could the horrid threat of a clambake. "I told you there
was not the slightest danger," squizzed the visiting cherry-stone.
"He's only another goof come to look at the ocean&mdash;probably a
typical New Yorker," he added, tapping his forehead significantly.
Whereupon he and the other clams, like the solitary horseman in
novels, only rather more clammily, disappeared from the picture. I'm
afraid I had ruined their day.</p>

<p>It was thus, or near enough, that I began my long and extremely
pleasant relations with the Atlantic, an association which neither of
us, I trust, has had cause to regret. You must forgive me for yelling
"<i>Thalassa!</i>" and "<i>E Pluribus Unum!</i>"&mdash;especially
"<i>Thalassa!</i>" since I have no Greek, and just got it out of a
book. But I was all excited. I had waited so long! My early yearning
for the sea had never been completely satisfied during my boyhood in
the Middle West. Later I found Lake Michigan marvelous, but fresh;
and seeing my ocean at long last, it struck me all of a heap, like. I
hope my readers will permit me to skip what I saw that morning as I
stood on the southern shore of Jones's and peered horizonward. I'm
not so good in purely descriptive passages, and I believe the
Atlantic has quite a number of sterling qualities which we need not
argue about. Suffice it that stout Cortez hadn't a thing on me when
with eagle eye he got into the wrong poem&mdash;it was really a
couple of other explorers.</p>

<p>I, too, was silent and just stared. Strangely silent, it occurred
to me, after letting my Viking spirit run wild for an hour or two.
Mark you well&mdash;for here the plot thickens&mdash;I had not
sneezed once in all that time, nor sniffed, nor sniveled, nor wished
that I had ne'er been born, nor any of the things one does when one
is subject to rose cold. I had arrived at Jones's Island a human
wreck, if that; just one more poor, underpaid book reviewer harried
and hunted by hay fever's hideous little cousin. And here I stood, my
vision clear, my smeller busy with salt fragrance, whole in mind and
nose, thinking in terms of high romance, all of a glorious June day;
convinced for the mad moment, I confess it, that Pippa was not a
half-wit at all. For a nickel I'd have burst into song. Some subtle
seaside virus was coursing through my system, sweeping out dusty
clouds of landlubberly notions and raising merry hell with my logical
faculties&mdash;I always hated them. "It would be sheer foolishness
ever to leave this sneezeless island with its own private ocean," I
told myself. "And it is our bounden duty as reasonable creatures to
shun and turn from folly, at least once in a while, especially when
the avoidance is so pleasant as this." So I philosophized. Already I
was half a hermit.</p>

<p>That afternoon I wandered back of the beach hills, seeking among
the swamps and meadows of the interior some aspect of animate or
inanimate Nature that might bring on a return of my tragedy, for as
yet I could not believe that this Fortunate Isle contained no germs
of rose cold. Though rose cold is mostly caused by the machinations
of evil spirits, flowers are part of it, too, and the victim must
watch them like so many wild animals. Flowers are very pretty, yes;
and don't they know it? But the best of them are full of pollen, a
substance used by Mother Nature to produce rose cold and hay fever
when she might be in better business. In a world where <i>Ambrosia
artemist&aelig;folia</i> turns out to be common ragweed, you can't be
too careful.</p>

<p>Proceeding, then, upon my usual assumption that every leaf and bud
that blows is my deadly enemy until it can prove that it isn't, I
adventured boldly into the unknown hinterland. Each humble, nameless
sprout of green I firmly challenged and encountered, sniffing to
windward and leeward, reconnoitering stealthily from ambush, doubling
in my tracks and charging suddenly to prevent trickery. I found no
actual flowers, if memory serves; but one homely creeper, apparently
some low and depraved form of sweet pea, showed a dangerous tendency
to bloom. I walked straight up to it, looked it in the eye and gave
it glare for glare. Nothing happened. I passed on, spasmless. Well,
well!</p>

<p>Here, obviously, were none of my vegetable enemies, and a man
might be at peace. A body might live here without an utterly ruinous
supply of red bandannas. Later there might be goldenrod, but let it
come. I am not affected by goldenrod, a fact which accounts for my
cocky leers whenever I meet a mess of that flaunting, cruel plant;
the joke is on the goldenrod, and so far as I'm concerned it may
flaunt its head off. At that I am not one of those happy, carefree
picnickers who carry heaping armfuls of goldenrod into railway trains
and subways on the off chance of finding some poor hay fever addict
and ending a perfect day with a good laugh. It might do these
excursionists a great deal of good if they sat down in a clump of
poison ivy some time. Speaking of hot Sitz baths, I had my troubles
that first day with the Jones's Island beach grass, a species of
improved hatpin, but that thrill was as nothing compared to my epic
discovery of the Zachs Inlet Coast Guard Station.</p>

<p>That's where I met Portygee Pete and Comanche and Pokamoke Benny
and Buttercup and Uncle John and, in the ways of seven or eight
years, some dozens of others who became my friends and privy
counselors, financial advisers, pump fixers, putters-on of typewriter
ribbons and bulwarks against melancholia. 'Twas there I first sampled
the most excellent cuisine of Hot Biscuit Slim, the second of that
honored name. Slim plied us all with stew, and afterwards stayed us
with pancakes, his own special brew, compounded of main strength, a
fertile imagination and a ladle of soda. Boy, that was food, and not
merely something to titillate a jaded palate. If your palate is jaded
at Jones's, you better move.</p>

<p>It was doubtless fate that drew me there; we cannot, the wisest
among us, prove the contrary. And fate, as a great writer has put it,
kept right on working. For towards evening, having dined at five, I
came by a crooked little path to a crooked little house about three
hundred yards from the station. I saw that it was my house, and had
been mine from the dim beginnings. Somewhere it was written. In a
kind of joyful amazement I opened my mouth and spoke, saying, "I have
been here before"; and I care not if the alienists have a long,
insulting name for that particular feeling. I added, for the benefit
of the small black kitten following close at my heels, "This is my
ancient home, from which I strayed long since. But now I am back from
my faring, and here I shall live and abide."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you have come to your senses at last," said the
kitten. "I picked you for a hermit all the time."</p>

<p>"Come on inside," said I to the kitten, who leaped ahead into the
crooked little kitchen and settled politely on the stove.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" demanded my inky familiar.</p>

<p>"I love it, all four rooms, furniture and all," I shouted from the
parlor. "But just what do you mean," I inquired, returning from my
hasty inspection, "you picked me for a hermit?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to take my word for things," smiled my companion.
"You were born in Auburn, Indiana, on August 23, 1894, making you a
Virgo character, with strong leanings towards Leo. Right?"</p>

<p>"The year's not quite right," said I; "but I can see you're a
mighty smart kitten. What's your name, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Finnegan."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Finnegan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just Finnegan to you," said the kitten.</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> Mister, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you must know," said Finnegan. "Well, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me Bill," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, Bill," resumed Finnegan, "I only meant that you are
obviously the island type, not the ordinary, crude oaf one meets
ashore in this darned old Riveting Age."</p>

<p>"You got out of that pretty nicely, you flatterer," said I. "What
else?"</p>

<p>"You hate noise? I thought so. You have a slight touch of auditory
hyper&aelig;sthesia, which might easily develop into schizophrenia.
In the quiet of Jones's Island you would probably write much better
book reviews. Don't you want to?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted. "I have a passionate, flamelike, all-consuming
desire to do that very thing, so as to have my wages raised."</p>

<p>"You'll get over that," said Finnegan, "once you're a hermit."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I can be one," said I. "There's civilization to
consider."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Finnegan. "Anyway, if you will pardon an
epigram, a hermit is simply a person to whom civilization has failed
to adjust itself."</p>

<p>"Did you think that up all by yourself?" I demanded, with mounting
admiration.</p>

<p>"I may have seen it in the National Geographic," said Finnegan.
"The Coast Guards saved a millionaire and his yacht from drowning
here lately, and he sent us a few back numbers as a
reward&mdash;wonderful reading, so broadening. As I was saying, let
somebody else worry about civilization."</p>

<p>"But I hate to be called a misfit!" said I. "Even now science is
hard at work on the cause and cure of hermits, and what with
psycho-analysis and all, the poor hermits soon won't have a pillar to
stand on."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" laughed Finnegan. "Of course there are some hermits
who haven't all their buttons, but we are speaking of the other kind.
There have been some grand ones. It is, I assure you, in no idle vein
that I mention such names as Theodosius of Cappadocia, James of
Mesopotamia, Epiphanius of Salamis, Hospitius of Villafranca and
Claudius Apollinaris of Hierapolis, not forgetting Robinson Crusoe.
There was also the Abbot Paphnutius&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The friend of Tha&iuml;s?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to mention him," said Finnegan. "It just slipped
out. Too bad about him&mdash;a mere matter of glands, and no good
doctors."</p>

<p>"Do you mean he had too many glands, or not enough, or what?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"We needn't go into that," said Finnegan.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I'm not so sure about the place of asceticism in
modern life. Morality, you know, is essentially social.
Life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lot you know about life," said Finnegan. "Life is within and no
man hath seen it. I guess I read that somewhere, too. Anyway, you're
not going to be so damned ascetic!"</p>

<p>"Right," I agreed. "I really don't want to be a cenobite or an
eremite just at present. I want to be good, in moderation, but you'll
have to let me go to literary teas in New York every few weeks. I
suppose I must live in a cave?"</p>

<p>"Cave, nothing!" said Finnegan with some show of emotion. "You'll
live right here in this house. That's exactly where so many hermits
make their big mistake&mdash;living in caves. Caves are damp, dark
and full of bats; it costs a small fortune to fix one of them so it's
at all habitable. All thinking hermits to-day deplore the cave habit.
Besides, I always say what is home without a house? It doesn't have
to be steam-het, either."</p>

<p>"Steam what?"</p>

<p>"Steam-het," said Finnegan. "It doesn't have to be. You'll be
perfectly comfortable with this kitchen range, and you can write your
book reviews on that table, and if any visitors come to disturb you,
I'll bite them. I know the man who owns this shack, and I'll arrange
the business end of it; just leave it all to me. You'll find after a
few weeks that your auditory hyper&aelig;sthesia will clear up and
you'll lose that pale onshore look; in no time we'll have you a
<i>mem sana in corpore sano</i>, or near enough to it for all
practical purposes."</p>

<p>"Maybe all I need," I replied, "is a good eye, ear, nose, throat
and brain specialist."</p>

<p>"What is to be will be," said Finnegan. "And if you want any more
cats, I have thirty-nine brothers and sisters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The die is cast!" I exclaimed, and groped my way to the tattered
blanket in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Soon we fell into a dreamless sleep, from which Finnegan was to
wake a speechless but no less sapient cat. At dawn I struck for the
mainland, returning at sunset with all that was mine or that my
friends would spare. And the evening of that day was the morning of
my hermiting. By and large, that was about how the fit took me. Some
think it passing strange that I should change my way of life so
completely because of a silly rose cold, a mere ocean, more or less,
the twilight look of a little crooked house in the sand and the
ravings of a temporarily enchanted cat. They say it doesn't stand to
reason. I reply, what does? But how can you argue with people who
have never loved at sight?</p>

<p>Sure, it's only Jones's where I live; just good old homely
Jones's. It isn't the Balearics, though it has often occurred to me
that there is something decidedly Balearic about the
place&mdash;there are ways of looking at islands. We have no
slingers, and maybe that's just as well; book reviewers have enough
on their minds without Balearic slingers and Gaditanian dancers and
such. Life can't be all slinging and dancing.</p>

<p>Time was when I planned to cast anchor not nearly so close to the
mainland. I started for some unsuspected isle in far-off seas; the
Cyclades, perhaps, if not the Hyades, and why not even Atlantis, if I
had to fish it up myself? Then the wind shifted, as the wind will,
and I'd have compromised on the Greater and Lesser Antilles. Anyway,
I got to Jones's, and that's something. Hermits cannot be choosers,
as Singapore Sam, just up from Hatteras, brought home to me as I was
writing this very piece.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to Coney Island, Bill?" he inquired&mdash;he's
saving up for the trip.</p>

<p>"Yes," I told him, truthfully; "but only once, and that was years
ago."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I suppose that's more for the upper
classes."</p>

<p>Let's leave it at that.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="BE_IT_EVER_SO_HUMBLE" id="BE_IT_EVER_SO_HUMBLE"></a>BE
IT EVER SO HUMBLE</h3>

<p>There has been much loose talk about my hermiting shack. I can't
see where it's so awful. Various persons from New York who have dared
the waves and the weather for a view (through no fault of my own, I
may say) have compared it, seldom to its advantage, with the
Parthenon, the mansion of Krazy Kat and the original home of the
Jukes family. I like it.</p>

<p>What seems to worry these people is art. Conventional painters,
including the house-and-barn type, generally greet my shack with
frank smiles of incredulity, followed by partial coma. And the
architects! I hear there's a movement among them to use my bungalow
as a textbook example of what's wrong with their business. The sooner
the better&mdash;that will give the dome of St. Paul's a rest. One
expert tells me that my home, in the small space of 20 by 20 feet and
up a ways, exhibits in a hitherto unknown mixture all but three of
the worst features of the Early Greek, Byzantine, Gothic, Egyptian
and Chester A. Arthur schools of thought, at the same time lacking
every essential mentioned in Ruskin's "The Seven Lamps of
Architecture." I still like it.</p>

<p>Well, fun is fun, and my villa seems to do its share in that way.
One amateur wit, somehow asked for the week-end, dropped his suitcase
and rolled on the sand in strong hysterics when I proudly announced,
"There it is!" He pretended he had just seen an extremely comical cow
in a nearby pasture, but I saw through that&mdash;we have no cows.
Later, he described his visit in the madcap line, "I came, I saw, I
went"; but I noticed he stayed his time out, ate like a horse and
tried to come again. He also invented that crack about the Jukeses.
Jukeses, indeed! I have met some very nice Jukeses, by and large,
with better manners, too.</p>

<p>As for art, my house represents the practical rather than the
abstract side of that subject. It may be said to serve, however
faultily, the eternal principle of utility; it is, or comes near
being, in some respects, adequate to the purpose for which it was
erected&mdash;to shelter an insolvent mortal from the blast. Let us
admit that somehow the lines, spaces and masses failed to jell. It
was built for comfort; if something went wrong, we can't have
everything. If it does not figure forth the vaulting spiritual
aspirations of the carpenter, it keeps most of the rain out, anyway.
If it does not evoke the cathedral mood, at least it's a place to
flop. A snippy author is fond of remarking that its architecture
shows a quality of brute force rather than an association of many
intellects. Yes, and I have more than a suspicion that if the
intelligentsia had designed my residence it wouldn't be here to tell
the tale.</p>

<p>Who did build it? Scoff if you will, but I have felt, ever since I
first came to Jones's, that maybe Inigo was guilty. Or is it only a
strange coincidence? If I am right in my little daydream, it is
probable that my shack betokens Inigo's earlier phase, before he had
got the knack of constructing human habitations, or perhaps some
later period when he was suffering from a nervous breakdown. Still,
why hang it on Inigo, when many another Jones, alive and able to
defend himself, is fully capable of the deed? Besides, Inigo would
hardly have survived this youthful error, and he became a famous man.
Maybe one of the Chippendales did it, Heaven knows it's wabbly
enough. Whoever he was, I am sure that my unknown architect was a
genius. No disaster less complete and irremediable will account for
the symptoms. Looking upon his handiwork, the thoughtful observer can
but realize that even genius can be badly bent by a few decades of
constant exposure to Mother Nature at her worst. At least, it can
here on Jones's Island.</p>

<p>Perched none too securely upon a slight eminence, a good yard and
a half above sea level, as far as possible from the boardwalk of a
small and transient summer colony and within hailing distance of the
Coast Guards (without about nine of which as near neighbors a hermit
would be in a pretty pickle), the site of my shack combines the
advantages of frequent assistance with comparative safety from flood
tides and company. Shielded from the distant view by the government
station and the bayberry bushes, my Castle in Spain bursts suddenly
upon the sight of occasional explorers with results already
indicated. Oh, these hilarious trippers! They seem to think that
hermits are deaf, or have no feelings, or both.</p>

<p>Doubtless my chimney causes some of the wisecracks. True, it leans
four ways at once and rather dominates the substructure and the
landscape; but the jokers simply show their ignorance of hermiting
and of air currents, especially during blizzards. How else would it
look, composed as it is of two lengths of tile, two pieces of
stovepipe and an extra bit of bonnet, all fighting desperately for
their very lives in all kinds of weather, and the devil take the
hindmost? How would these people themselves look in similar case? To
me that chimney's anything but funny. The mere hanging together of
its component parts, half-seas over as the effect may be, strikes me
as a noble and heartening instance of <i>esprit de corps</i>, moral
uplift and civic betterment.</p>

<p>And here I beg leave to deny a report circulated by some enemy,
presumably on the evidence of the spectacular wire network which
prevents my chimney from blowing, as the saying goes, to hell and
gone. The charge is that I have a radio. I need not assure my close
friends, who know how I adore the perfectly silent arts, that that is
a plain, unvarnished lie. When hermits take to radios we shall,
indeed, have reached a fine state of affairs.</p>

<p>I should have the whole house described by this time, of course,
but there's little to describe. Moreover, in all stories dealing with
horror&mdash;and that's the way the world chooses to look at my
house&mdash;one avoids the crassly concrete. Too, I'm sensitive.
About all I care to admit is that my bungalow is growing old, and
none too gracefully, that it has known adversity in many forms, that
it has repeatedly arisen from the blows of destiny with badly
wrenched timbers and with a head unbowed, that it leaks, sways in the
passing breeze, sometimes seems about to rise on its hind legs and
end it all in the ocean or the bay and that I'm very fond of it. It's
not what it was. Its marked departures from the vertical and the
horizontal speak all to poignantly of a youth that is fled, of an
autumn lurking round the corner. At that, it's a long way yet from
senile decay.</p>

<p>I find it possible to cope with these few weaknesses. When it
rains I keep reasonably dry by moving myself and manuscripts hastily
from spot to spot according to the whims of the dear old roof. In a
wintry hullabaloo I fool the icy drafts that whiz through the floor
by wrapping my feet in my overcoat and hot bricks. Some day I plan to
repair the roof, the walls, the four sides and the underpinning, not
from love of unbridled luxury, but in answer to insistent warnings of
my instinct to survive. My shack is a house, all right, but you could
just as well call it the great outdoors.</p>

<p>Speaking of weather, I must explain that my hermitage occupies a
strategic point. My little hill seems to be the meeting place of the
winds mentioned in Gayley's "Classic Myths," and that includes
everything from a moderate breeze (fishing smacks carry all canvas
with good list), through a fresh gale (all smacks make for harbor) to
a storm, what I mean storm (just hope for the best and keep your
kindling dry).</p>

<p>If, gentle reader, you have ever noticed a goofier than usual
paragraph in one of my book reviews, ten to one it was due to the
sudden collapse of a portion of my home, with resulting fierce
effects upon the critical frenzy. Too often in the midst of literary
labors I have to rush out into the night to hold down the parlor, to
anchor the bedroom more securely to the clothes pole, to see whether
that fearful racket is a herd of mad bull elephants trying to break
into the kitchen, or only the mizzen-mast at it again. How can I keep
my mind on a book when the loud tempests rave in such a place? How
follow the rajah's ruby with my starboard braces twisting, the deck
at an angle of fifty degrees, the buckets awash, lee scuppers
drowned, shipping water with every lurch, expecting each moment to be
on our beam ends, me and mine sunk without a trace in thirty fathoms
of sand? Why, rounding the Horn is child's play! And it certainly
raises Cain with one's onomatop&oelig;ia. No, I have no quatrefoils,
rosettes, gussets, gargoyles or Mexican drawnwork on my house, not
even a caryatid. And a good thing, too, for some young, inexperienced
caryatid&mdash;she'd last about two minutes.</p>

<p>Small wonder, I suppose, that city folk shudder at and in my
house. I suggest that all those who cannot cope with a few rough,
untutored elements remain snug at home in the inglenook with their
loved ones and their aspirin. That would save them telling me stories
about the Aged Recluse Found Frozen in Hut. I wonder if they haven't
an eye out for that million dollars hidden inside my mattress, the
bags of gold under the flooring and the bank books showing deposits
in seventeen banks! Well, they won't get a penny of mine unless they
change their ways. What hurts is that my shack does rather resemble
the hut where the Aged Recluse was found, if not the spot where the
cyclone reached its maximum violence. I thought paint would fix that,
but the trouble is, people never give hermits enough paint of one
kind&mdash;always remnants. So now I have blue sides, a yellow roof,
an apple green rear and a bright red piazza. And all it got me was
another headline about an Aged Color-Blind Recluse.</p>

<p>Sure, I own it; why wouldn't I? I bought it. Not outright, you
understand. By fits and starts. Nor do I regret the long, lean years
spent in the paying. Starting with dollar book reviews, my affairs
prospered, just as Finnegan had predicted, until to-day, with a ten
or a fifteen dollar check arriving every couple of weeks, I can
afford to laugh at those early struggles. Came the day when the last
of that two hundred dollar debt was canceled and the property was in
my possession. Now it is mine, all mine, and will so remain until
somebody comes along and kicks me off. Titles to land being what they
are out here, and the rage for turning God's pleasant places into
picnicking dumps for people with Fords being what <i>it</i> is, it
begins to look as though that might be almost any day now.</p>

<p>For the moment I'm sitting pretty on my own domain, consisting, I
should say, complete with grounds and outbuilding, of several square
rods; of course, the ocean goes with it. There are times, naturally,
when one feels land poor. Only last year, during a spell of black
famine, I came near burdening the estate for the purpose of buying
vitamins. The urgent need for something to put in my pantry drove me
to approach a wealthy summer colonist about a mortgage. He thought it
was only one of my jokes and laughed fit to kill, so there I was. And
that very evening, as luck would have it, I got a birthday cake from
shore. The crisis was safely past.</p>

<p>One word more, patient reader, about the &aelig;sthetic aspects of
hermiting. If art is what you seek at Jones's, take a look at my
brick outbuilding, out back of my bunkhouse. Not so bad. I built it
to shelter my rejected and unfinished manuscripts from fire, flood,
moths, rust and infantile traumas in general; 'twill serve. It's a
home for my brain-tots, bless their hearts, all three dozen! Ocean
may bear me away in the night on a perigy tide, meadow blazes scorch
me to cinders, and welcome, but if anything happens to those
brain-tots, I'm sunk. Myself, I live rather sketchily, but the
children of my fancy are something else again. As long as I can wield
a brick and a hod they shall have the best of everything, if I have
to do without chocolate almond bars. I'm going to give them what I
missed.</p>

<p>I swore I'd house those kiddies comfortably, and I did. I began to
build, not unambitiously, with the Temple of Karnak in mind, but
switched to the Petit Trianon for reasons having to do with a limited
foundation&mdash;5 by 6 feet, to be exact. I wanted it to look
something like a Norman keep, too, but who knows what that looks
like? Then the bag of cement gave out when the walls had risen no
more than a yard and a half, and it developed that Portygee Pete, my
assistant, had been using the Coast Guard potato cellar as a model,
anyway. Mere fragment of a dream that it is, the great curved roof,
with its round arch composed of galvanized iron, old tin, tar-paper,
pebbles and putty, strikes me as nothing short of swell. They call it
Cuppy's Folly, but on moonlit nights it reminds me a lot of the Taj
Mahal. Sometime, when the dust and strife are o'er, when I've
reviewed my last detective tale, when I've said good-by to the
clams&mdash;who knows? We can't all wind up in Grant's Tomb.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the brain-tots rest in peace, awaiting the millennial
dawn of a new kind of magazine, one devoted fearlessly and
sacrificially, if need be, to the small joys and sorrows of Jones's
Island. Sunshiny days I open the door of the coop, brush off the
mildew, administer tonics to the ailing tots and soundly drub the
worst examples of arrested development. Then we go for a walk on the
beach, proud father bowing to right and left and informing the
curious that we are the complete works of Ralph Waldo
Emerson&mdash;the children must have their little joke! Regular
little hermits, all of them! So I suppose our home is a happy home,
as such things go. And not so <i>darned</i> humble, at that.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="LIVING_FROM_CAN_TO_MOUTH" id=
"LIVING_FROM_CAN_TO_MOUTH"></a>LIVING FROM CAN TO MOUTH</h3>

<p>Supposing you lived, so to speak, on such a sandbar as mine, far
from the beaten track of travel, chain stores and one-arm lunches, in
order to ponder in peace some of the easier riddles of our curious
planet&mdash;supposing all this and more, how, where and what would
you eat? You may reply that in such a fix, God forbid, your keeper
would probably feed you; but I mean <i>alone</i>. Starting the lesson
all over again, I repeat: If you lived where I said, what, if
anything, would you eat? And, if so, why?</p>

<p>Well, I seem to make out. Indeed, people ashore are always asking
me how I manage to look so fit (meaning fat), implying that any one
who would move to Jones's in the first place couldn't possibly have
enough sense to think of proper food. Apparently these persons have
never heard of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak, the Winamwanga of Northern
Rhodesia, the Whazzits of the Torres Straits and the M'Benga of the
Gaboon. Besides, I am only seven pounds overweight, just as I have
been these many years, yet the cruel rumor persists that I breakfast,
dine and sup entirely upon dried apples and water. Some, noting my
crimson countenance among the landlubbers, give out that I batten
upon blubber, raw polar bear, codliver oil and maybe Mellin's Food,
when it's all due to actinic rays or ultra-violet or something. Of
course, that leads to worse and more of it: I that have always longed
to look pale, thin, hurt and a little wistful&mdash;in a word,
poetical!&mdash;I am pointed out when ashore as one of the chief
modern examples of the sanguine temperament, as opposed to the
phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic. As for retiring to Jones's to
stuff myself, why, I eat like a bird&mdash;naturally, one of the
larger birds.</p>

<p>How do I do it? It is true that I live where food must be lugged
an hour's journey oceanward from the southern Long Island shore, but
no one need starve, even so. To-day, for instance, my dinner went
something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Chicken Soup with Croutons<br>
Boiled Leg of Veal with Caper Sauce<br>
Fresh Lima Beans     Potatoes &agrave; la Gregory<br>
Lettuce and Tomato Salad with Mayonnaise<br>
Orange Layer Cake   Floating Island<br>
Chocolate Creams<br>
Luckies     Coffee<br>
More Cake</p>

<p>Not so bad for an isolated hermit, eh? I treated myself to this
delightful repast at Mrs. Gregory's, who lives away up the beach at
the summer colony. At other times Mrs. Gregory has roast chicken,
strawberry shortcake, doughnuts, caramels, corn on the cob, macaroni
and Camels. If not, Mrs. Prodgers has fried eels, bran muffins,
chocolate cake, ham sandwiches, cookies, beefsteak and second
helpings of everything. So have the Tappens.</p>

<p>You see which way the wind blows during the summer months,
glorious but all too brief. My experience tends to show that any
Jones's Island hermit who is willing to devote a ridiculously small
amount of time each day to learning the dinner hours of the various
families up the beach, keeping track of the boats for new arrivals
and departures, listening in at the grocery store and finding out
about parties need never suffer from the diseases of
undernourishment. He can and does obtain with a minimum of effort
choice cuts of this and that, clam chowder and what not, including
home-made fudge, all of which may be consumed on the spot, wrapped up
for future reference, or both. It is really astonishing how summer
resorters acquire such marvelous things to eat, considering the many
difficulties of refrigeration, transportation, checkbooks and
miscellaneous items that are all Greek to hermits.</p>

<p>There are, of course, minor problems in a career of this sort,
none of which need stump the book reviewer who goes after them with a
will. He must not overdo things at first. He must consider the
constant danger of social ostracism, yet must balance against this
the horrors of a bachelor diet of beans, bayberries and beach grass;
for Mother Nature seems to have made no provision at Jones's for the
edible lichens, Arctic moss, breadfruit and other blessings showered
so generously upon critics of other climes. Those South Sea
intelligentsia have it pretty soft.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the hermit is gifted with persistency and an ordinary
amount of plain human cunning he will fall heir to ten bottles of
ketchup, five cans of beans, the remains of two pot roasts, a Mason
jar of piccalilli and nine oranges in good condition when the summer
people leave for home after Labor Day. When I waved good-by to my
summer chums last year I kept back the tears by blinking rapidly and
forcing my thoughts to dwell upon their contributions to the large
cardboard grocery box which I had previously placed in a conspicuous
position on the dock in such a manner as practically to block the
only passage to the boat. It got me, if memory serves, the usual
ketchup, half a jar of German mustard, one-third parcel of baking
soda, seven of free-running salt, one-half pie com-plete with
pie-tin, one bottle of household ammonia, one-third bottle of
non-alcoholic French vermouth, two lemons, three boxes of soap
flakes, nine cakes of soap, three pairs of shoestrings, one damaged
portrait of a Cunard liner, one carton of birdseed, one package of
stove and furnace cement, eleven clothespins, a copy of "800 Proved
Pecan Recipes" and a pint of rhubarb and soda mixture.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that half a pie, two lemons and a small supply of
birdseed will not last forever, and some kind friend may wonder what
I do from Labor Day until the middle of the following June. Well,
when dependent upon my own cuisine, I'm afraid I am, scientifically
speaking, one of the byproducts of the Machine Age. My one culinary
talent lies in thinking up new, novel and palatable ways of opening
tin cans. When I glance out my window at the appalling pile of the
same which I seem to have thrown out, I am moved to forswear the
crude reality and utterly deny to myself and others that I ever had
anything to do with them, let alone ate what they once contained.
It's the only decent thing to do. I explain my empty cans in the same
way that I explain my red felt lambrequin with the green bird
outlined in tinsel and my green felt lambrequin with the red bird
outlined in ditto&mdash;they were there when I bought the house. I'm
getting so I believe it myself.</p>

<p>Yet I must be responsible, in some measure, for that hideous metal
mountain in my backyard, unless my neighbors at the Zachs Inlet Coast
Guard Station sneaked it over some dark night. About that Pelion of
tin cans I am more sorry than I can possibly say. It gives a totally
wrong impression. I'm not like that at all. I'm all against this
awful Machine Age with its materialistic, soul destroying inventions,
yet here I am, one of the main reasons why the annual consumption of
canned beans in the United States must be measured in light years.
Alas, the successful hermit of to-day, existing spiritually though he
may be in times less crass than our own, must compromise. Almost
without exception, such hermits eventually become eaters of canned
beans. I like to think that my tin cans are but a temporary expedient
until I can have my own garden, start a campaign for another kind of
civilization altogether and&mdash;oh, a lot of things! 'Tis but for
the moment that I find myself, as some joker had the nerve to say,
living from can to mouth.</p>

<p>The psychology of the tin can, its folklore and its sex life are
subjects that would well reward further study, although there is
already a considerable literature in this field. I have stopped
reading about the coal-tar dyes and fatal preservatives that one buys
along with the most innocent-appearing string bean; I never believed
a word of it, but it does give one the creeps. I think there is some
gossip, too, about the salts of tin that come with iron rations, and
why not? I may not be getting all my minerals, but if any dietitian
asks me, "Have you had your tin to-day?" I can look her straight in
the face and answer, "You said it."</p>

<p>I've been in rather a panic lately about some of my canned goods
just because I started reading an article on the household page. Said
the professor, "A good can should have slightly concave ends and
should give forth only a dull sound when struck on the top or
bottom," while convexity and a hollow drumlike response mean the
worst. Since then neither I nor the cans, some of which I've had for
years, have known much joy of life. Sometimes the cans look perfectly
concave and then again there are moments when nothing could well
appear more poisonously convex; they do and they don't. Occasionally
the tapping of the whole Coast Guard crew upon the rows of tomatoes,
corn, peas, beans and sundry results in dullness unrelieved; other
days we get the most terrifying medley of sepulchral moans, groans
and death rattles. The brave Coast Guards love this sport, but it has
left me in a condition bordering upon acute neurasthenia, certainly
with marked hallucinatory symptoms, both aural and ocular.</p>

<p>One probably should not judge these cans too hastily. Personally,
I feel that it is no outsider's business what goes on in a can of
succotash from season to season, so long as it harms no one else, but
of course that's the whole point. I hate to visit destructive
criticism upon <i>bacillus botulinus</i> for what it probably cannot
help&mdash;did it ask to be born?&mdash;but there is a limit. Some
nights while reading detective stories I get slightly desperate, what
with the toxicology and all. Follow regular Edgar Wallace dreams,
full of nothing but germs. Then morning comes, the jocund day, and
sense. What is to be will be, especially at Jones's.</p>

<p>As for my Ossa of tin, it may be all for the best. Nowadays some
very useful things are being made out of&mdash;guess what? Just
little old used tin cans! They are said to make wonderful
cooky-cutters, candlesticks, geranium sprinklers, ash trays,
mousetraps, watch fobs, ear muffs, bedroom slippers and modern
furniture; I see no reason why the house itself may not be built of
the same material. Persons with that kind of mind who come out to
Jones's&mdash;and I'll be right there waiting&mdash;will find me
ready and tickled to help them realize their artistic ideals; part
cash and the rest in Wall Street. Still, I may buy a goat.</p>

<p>We have clams, of course. Without clams the salt water or seashore
hermit of our North Temperate Zone (classified in technical usage as
the Greater American sand, marsh or beach hermit) would not be what
he is to-day. Inevitably, I might almost say ineluctably, if I were
that sort, he knows his bivalves. To deny the very close relationship
existing between the two species would ill become one who has earned
a certain limited celebrity around High Hill Crick as The Little
Brother of the Clams. Clams are a subject very close to my stomach
and some day I shall strive to celebrate them in suitable prose.
Another time, good friends! To-night as I listen to the chowder
bubbling on the hob&mdash;not really the hob, just the stove&mdash;my
thoughts turn pensively to fish. Oh, you fish!</p>

<p>Fish, you know, are good for the brain, unless I am thinking of
lettuce. This has been denied by some of our leading college
professors who have lived on a fish diet for years without tangible
results owing to the fact&mdash;well, why rub it in? Why try to be
funny by opining that those fish had nothing to work on? In this
connection I may explain that while any resident of Jones's Island
may be said to be entirely surrounded by fish, try and get them. Fish
also contain iodine, which is grand for goiter. My tragedy is that
though I live between Great South Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, within
a hop, step and jump of either, my craving for fish iodine is all too
seldom satisfied. When I feel it coming on the easiest way is to
signal a passing ship, sail for New York City and order <i>filet de
fluke</i>.</p>

<p>One has, of course, one's moments. Many a flounder, presented by
visiting baymen, has entered my kitchen to depart no more; full many
a September snapper, caught by obliging trippers, has gone the way of
all fish. October and November, however, are my fishiest months, for
then the frostfish come up out of the ocean on nipping nights, lie
down in any convenient spot and wait for hermits to bag them. Good
eating, too! Maybe you'd rather have a broiled bluefish, an
aristocratic smelt or one of those Lucullan carp steeped in water of
roses; but they suit me down to the ground. At a party I once gave in
my shack the guests simply loved them, though several fainted when I
told them that I found the fish. It seems that in New York to find
one's <i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> is considered extremely
<i>gauche</i>.</p>

<p>Just why they come up on the beach nobody knows; that is to say
the Coast Guards know, but I can't get it straight. Rattlesnake Ned
tells me it has something to do with the offshore or the onshore
wind, or with going North or South in the late fall, or vice versa;
perhaps also with the temperature, the tides and the mean average
humidity. I gather that for frostfish navigation is risky as well as
broadening; travel is their undoing, since for them it means just one
hermit after another. At any rate they come up, the hermit arrives,
they struggle for a little space, they engage in futile attempts to
foil they know not what, they try to carry on, they give up, gasp,
expire&mdash;and who doesn't? And maybe they're better off.</p>

<p>After not a little research I have succeeded in identifying the
Jones's Island frostfish as nothing more nor less than the Tomcod
(<i>Microgadus tomcodus</i>), take the word of that best of
thrillers, the New English Dictionary; it need not surprise you that
several other undeserving fish are also called Tomcod, such as young
codfish, adult male codfish and, of all things, the Jackfish of
California. Collating the N.E.D. with a standard work on nutrition I
next discovered that the frostfish boasts 81.5 per cent of water,
17.1 per cent of protein, 0.4 per cent of fat, 1.0 per cent of ash
and a fuel value of 328 calories per pound&mdash;a more than
respectable showing, as respectability goes. True, the alewife, an
American fish closely allied to the herring and suspected of some
sort of sinister affiliation with the shad, has a fuel value of 552
calories to the pound. But where would I get an alewife?</p>

<p>I do not regard the Tomcod as just something more to eat; there's
the spiritual side, too. The sight of a beachful of frostfish
shimmering opalescently under the full moon of a November midnight,
if there is such a thing, makes me think of parables, of pictures in
the Metropolitan, of poems yet unborn and of how I'd like to have a
dollar for each fish. Not everybody, it seems, is affected in this
manner. What shall we say of the lady at Long Beach who is alleged to
have bammed another lady over the head with a two-pound
<i>tomcodus</i> when she&mdash;the second lady, or fishee&mdash;tried
to take it away from her? I never heard the sequel, but I am far from
recommending the frostfish as a weapon. It is too slippery, it laughs
at form and it leaves clues. Moreover, it merely stuns; the victim is
likely to revive and come back with a horseshoe crab or an octopus,
and then where are you? Don't be greedy and quarrelsome. As you
journey through life share your fish with others, if they <i>will</i>
butt in. Far better to gather only a bushel or two, sit down in the
sand with your dreams and wait for Portygee Pete to come by on patrol
and carry them home. He doesn't know his own strength.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="MY_KITCHEN_BEAUTIFUL" id="MY_KITCHEN_BEAUTIFUL"></a>MY
KITCHEN BEAUTIFUL</h3>

<p>People sometimes ask me how I manage to keep my kitchen so
immaculate, so spick and span, so all that they seem to think a
kitchen ought to be. They gaze in positive unbelief at my row of
shining dippers, my spotless sink, my perfect pump with the pink
ribbon on the handle. They come to scoff, like as not, and they
remain to applaud. Some of them get quite flattering.</p>

<p>How do I do it? Well, I don't, very often; only on those fairly
rare occasions when friends inclined to slumming make the arduous
trip from shore, or when the summer folk wade through the meadows and
the mosquitoes to take a look. If my dazzling kitchen bowls them over
they have only themselves to blame, as ten to one I didn't invite
them.</p>

<p>Careless of the great world's judgment as I try to be, I am not
yet above putting up a good front when I practically have to do so.
Some dormant respect for public opinion, some remnant of unhermitical
pride stirs within me when I hear that company is coming. And, since
guests mostly enter my abode by the kitchen door, that is why I clean
the place up when I find they are actually on the way and cannot be
stopped by malicious animal magnetism or any other legal means that I
have discovered. They come in by the kitchen, and first impressions
mean so much. Once they have looked upon my aluminum they go about
thenceforth squelching the rumor&mdash;Lord knows how it
started&mdash;that I live in a state of disorder bordering on
frenzy.</p>

<p>Now for the secret of my resplendent kitchen, my scintillant
skillets, my dazzling dippers&mdash;it was bound to come out some
time, and it might as well be while I'm here to explain it all. As
soon as I learn through accredited channels that my guests are
approaching I race to the Coast Guard Station and commandeer such of
the boys as are not reading the Blue Book or trying in other ways to
increase the efficiency of our federal government. Returning to my
shack at top speed, we completely dismantle the kitchen, placing the
contents in an old blanket in the adjoining bedroom. An observer
might well be astonished at the swiftness with which we accomplish
this bit of routine; sober second thought will assure the reader that
when three or four Coast Guards and an able-bodied hermit loose their
destructive tendencies in an enclosed space measuring six by eight
feet, something is bound to give. We work rhythmically, to the swing
of a Coast Guard chanty consisting of obsolete and deleted words
which we need not go into at present.</p>

<p>We now have a completely bare kitchen to deal with. Open flies the
door under the sink, and up on the walls go the aforementioned
splendiferous utensils, kept for the occasion and as innocent of soot
and the scars of this world as when they first came from Macy's
basement. The more stunning of these objects are three graduated
aluminum dippers, three ditto frying pans and three assorted tin
vessels with lids to match. Draped effectively about in attitudes of
studied carelessness are the aluminum tea-egg and the coffee
strainer. There's one especially gorgeous item which may possibly be
a combination slaw-cutter, button hook and picture frame, and then
again it may be a spaghetti-stretcher or the young of a gyroscope.
Nobody ever asks what it is. Nobody dares. But it is obvious at a
glance that no home is complete without one and that the home with
one is not, and never can be, quite like other homes. As a producer
of awe and humility in the onlooker this gadget is really
marvelous.</p>

<p>That is the way we produce our grand transformation scene, and I
dare say that Belasco in his palmiest days never thought up a better
one. The effect upon the company seldom, if ever, varies. One and
all, you could knock them over with the tea-egg. A popular society
leader of East Orange who is noted for her housekeeping, her husband
and her eyes exclaimed, "Why, they look like new!" "Uh-huh!" I
returned, noncommittally. "How <i>do</i> you keep all that aluminum
so <i>clean</i>?" she inquired (the italics are hers), shifting her
lorgnette momentarily from the dippers to me. I hope no one will be
too much shocked to learn that I murmured, "Brillo!" I didn't shout
it. I merely murmured it, without any verbs or gestures, and I still
can't see the harm. Anybody is likely to murmur a word sometimes
without meaning anything much, and, besides, Brillo would do it if I
gave it the chance.</p>

<p>The question may arise of some larger, more inclusive hypocrisy in
the whole procedure. I do not regard my emergency kitchen as in the
least hypocritical. Certainly it is no worse than many of the other
things one does in order to appear a little brighter and more shining
than one really is. In arranging my kitchen for company inspection I
am merely putting my best pan forward, against my own &aelig;sthetic
tastes, simply to please others. Nobody maunders about hypocrisy when
you decorate the ballroom with rubber plants and carnations. Is it a
crime to decorate the kitchen with aluminum? Morally, I can face the
thing with a clear conscience. I show my guests what they want to
see, and I believe that is as firmly grounded in true kindness and
sacrificial selflessness as is my practice of telling them what they
want to hear. It's only polite.</p>

<p>Assuming that the tourists leave after a few moments&mdash;and
they do&mdash;the scene is immediately struck. The Coast Guards
having returned to their scientific studies, I dismantle the dream
kitchen, put back into their hiding place the glittering shams that
have served their little day, restore the battered tin and cracked
agate ware to their familiar haunts, and begin the long, laborious
sorting of the d&eacute;bris in my bedroom for traces of my articles,
book reviews, memoranda, pencils and miscellaneous household effects.
With luck, I can finish this job in one week. You may ask, "What if
the guests remain for supper?" They don't.</p>

<p>Restored to its normal state, my kitchen, for reasons which it
would be useless to elaborate, even if I knew them, is not as other
kitchens. It is where I live, because it is where the stove and table
are. My other rooms are only for the overflow, such as wood and coal,
food, clothing, books, silver, cut glass and linen, so to speak. The
kitchen is where I read, write, wash, iron, eat, worry about my
insurance premiums and generally have my being, such as it is. It is
a place for beautiful thoughts, not for pots and pans. It is, in
brief, my workroom. As soon as I get to making more money I hope to
call it my sanctum sanctorum. If the money goes to my head I may call
it my den, or even my studio. Just now it's only the kitchen.</p>

<p>And I feel that it's not at its loveliest when all puffed up with
vain aluminum and pink ribbons. True beauty in a kitchen inheres not
in a vulgar bedizenment which can at best but titillate the grosser
senses; rather, in a temperate and practical adaptation of means to
end. And the end I seek is to get through life with as little fuss
and feathers as I can, to shun extravagant and ostentatious neatness
so far as in me lies, to be able to move about from pump to table to
stove without falling over all three, to avoid black starvation
and&mdash;though it is too much to ask, life being what it
is&mdash;to get a little work finished, or, at least, fairly started.
You may not be able to eat off the floor of my kitchen, but who wants
to?</p>

<p>Let me add a word of advice to hermits who are planning kitchens.
If you hope to get anywhere in hermiting, the first thing to avoid is
superfluity. Experience has taught me that among the things
absolutely inessential and never required in a bachelor kitchen are
the following: One set jelly cake tins, one skimmer, one wooden
butter ladle, one dozen patty pans, one dozen tartlet pans, one
ramekin and one coarse gravy strainer. In my kitchen you would be
lucky to get any gravy at all, coarse or refined.</p>

<p>Glancing about me, I see that articles much more likely to prove
useful include: One large iron frying pan, one large dipper, one wash
basin, one pair rubber boots, one oilskin outfit, one gallon
kerosene, one large box Gold Dust, one package Uneeda Biscuits, one
alleged shaving mirror, one table for literary works, one pack Bull
Durham and one can-opener. Small wooden boxes, such as the ones
thrown overboard by passing ships, may be attached to the walls to
hold hammers, nails, hacksaws, gimlets, hinges, fishhooks, paint
brushes, buttons, needles and thread, mousetraps, egg beaters and old
Ford parts. If you have a patty pan through no fault of your own,
forget it.</p>

<h3><a name="CONFESSIONS_OF_A_SARDINE_FIEND" id=
"CONFESSIONS_OF_A_SARDINE_FIEND"></a>CONFESSIONS OF A SARDINE
FIEND</h3>

<p>If we learn our most valuable lessons here below from horrible
examples, as some thinkers hold, I suppose I deserve a medal. I've
done a lot of good that way, yet people don't seem to get that aspect
of my housekeeping, and I'm not sure I do myself. Well, I hope they
will feel differently when on some lonely, windswept dune or 'neath a
clump of bayberries in the swamp they come across my epitaph in
suppliant capitals: "EXCUSIT PLEASE"&mdash;or I may just use the
simple English motto, "I'm Sorry." I really am, too, but it wasn't my
fault. I couldn't help it. I meant it all for the best. Or did I?</p>

<p>Take sardines, now. In the ways of several seasons at Jones's I am
become little better than a sardine addict, all because Rattlesnake
Ned, a neighboring hermit, rowed over from Goose Crick that fateful
Friday the Thirteenth to borrow my clam rake and a batch of sanitary
flour. Pulling three or four cans of his favorite fish from the
pockets of his pea-coat without so much as predicting the weather, he
whisked off the covers with his patent dujingus, called for a couple
of chairs, some man-size onions and a hunk of bread, and the party
was on. In what followed I need hardly state that my all too
suggestible nature led me to take a prominent part.</p>

<p>Very probably it was never Rattlesnake Ned's intention to
disarrange my whole notion of feeding so violently and so thoroughly
as he did on that occasion; but he did. Hitherto I had looked upon
the sardine as mere <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i>, a nuance, a
tantalizing hint of joys to come rather than a full six-course
dinner. I had not thought of it as something to take the place of
beans and pancakes in my life, nor dreamed that it was fraught, as
the saying goes, with such potentialities for weal or woe, a finny
demon that might seize upon the imagination of a hermit in his cell
and do with him what it would. You never know!</p>

<p>I'm not blaming good old Ned, as fine a hermit as ever dug a clam;
he'd give you his last cent if only he had it himself. I had reached
an age when the law held me responsible for my acts. I had no more
illusions than most of my kind. What I did that day was for the
thrill I expected to get out of it&mdash;and, more's the pity, did.
True, Ned encouraged me in my madness. There were sardine and onion
orgies on the deserted shore of Great South Bay, and ichthyophagous
rites up the beach, far from the prying eyes and nostrils of
respectable citizens, where I proved an all too apt pupil. Shortly I
reached the point where I would as soon gulp down two cans of the
little devils as look at them, and succeeding years have meant to me,
more than I could wish to confess, just one sardine after another.
They've got me, so why not say so? Aware as I am of the fascinations
of the insidious sardine, I hesitate to start my readers upon a road
that may have no turning back. So fatally easy, once you fall, is the
jump to the stack of sardines in the pantry&mdash;and here I am
practically urging you to take the leap! Unless you are very sure of
yourselves, pray regard this article as pure mathematics rather than
as household hints, or you may get thrown out of your bridge club.
With an ordinary amount of caution, self-control and luck on your
part, my recipe for the sardine and onion sandwich of Jones's Island
may help you over more than one hungry moment in the kitchen; or, at
least, keep you out of such mischief as frying bananas or putting
sugar in the tomatoes. In broadcasting my recipe I shall try to
avoid, so far as possible, the use of technical terms and the dead
languages, the more certainly to bring my message home to the great
masses of our American house-keepers. Go forth, little sandwich!
There's plenty more where you came from.</p>

<p>First, obtain in some honorable manner a loaf of bread, preferably
of the white persuasion&mdash;forget your mineral salts for a minute,
will you?&mdash;and dissect out two sizable slices. Butter with
butter or its equivalent and let stand for a moment. Next overpower,
peel, draw, quarter and hamstring one large, ferocious onion, and use
it as a thick veneer over one of the slices of bread the instant it
(the onion) has reached a state of comparative coma; and don't bother
to peel the onion under water, as the cook book advises, unless you
live in the Hippodrome; leave that sort of thing to Annette
Kellerman. Keep your head, salt, and as you were. So far we have the
humble onion sandwich of commerce and Second Avenue, to be used here
as a mere substructure for some modern engineering.</p>

<p>Enter <i>Clupea pilchardus</i>, or <i>Clupea harengus</i>, as they
call them up in Maine, but don't let that scare you; after all,
sardines belong to the herrings, Latin or no Latin. Drape them in any
manner your fancy may suggest upon their luscious couch of onion, as
close together as you may wish. Me, I feel that they have been so
cribbed and cabined up to now that they should repose in comfort, say
about twelve to a slice. Then lay on a heavy cement of Teutonic
mustard, add slices of pickle, put on the roof and repeat <i>ad
lib</i>.</p>

<p>That is my regulation model, but I am willing to go further. In
reckless mood I often add bits of bacon, a cold pork chop, what came
out of the stew and half a tomato to the confection, though there is
seldom room for all these if I have already included cauliflower in
mustard&mdash;that prince of pickles!&mdash;instead of the
conventional dill. Unless you go in for disorderly conduct, beginners
will do well to stick to the standard model, leaving the skyscraper
type to veteran connoisseurs and boa constrictors. Try it, folks! You
will find that the surface simplicity of this sandwich is out of all
proportion to its total displacement, mean average horsepower and
far-reaching after effects. It stays by you, I'll say that much.
Devil-may-care callers who have tackled one or more of them on what
they supposed was an equal footing have departed, if able, with a new
respect for the machinery inside of allegedly decrepit hermits. The
one who threatened to notify the Health Department&mdash;well, dead
men tell no tales.</p>

<p>Yes, it has come to this; and the awful part is, I like it. I
shall not go so far as to say that I have swapped modern civilization
for a mess of sardines and onions, yet, in a way, my sandwich has
more than a little symbolic value in my life. It is the fragrant flag
of my freedom. As I was saying to Ned, if I could afford a
coat-of-arms, or whatever they are, I should probably choose a
sardine rampant with sinister onions on a field of cauliflower; and
Ned said make it the same for him, but throw in some fried eels, a
steak, a dime's worth of good, strong Java and a cartoon of
smokes.</p>

<p>The onion part of this discourse may pain some gentle souls whom I
wouldn't distress for worlds. There seem to be people who hold with
onions and people who do not, and we of the true faith can do nothing
about the abstainers but watch and wait, hoping that they will see
the light. Some pretty hard things have been said about onions,
although they belong to the lily family and their name derives from
the Latin word meaning pearl of great price. According to Diodorus,
Pliny and Strabo, they were highly popular among the Ancient
Egyptians. They're grand for insomnia, too, but the catch is that
they're likely to keep the other lodgers awake; how the Egyptians got
around <i>that</i> I don't know, unless they both ate them. I do know
that persons who refuse onions are often up to no good.</p>

<p>Just what certain portions of the American public have against
sardines is more of a problem; maybe it was the onions that riled
them. Anyway, when I recently mentioned my sandwich in a book review
without explaining how delicious it really is, I was showered, not
with thanks, not with rich gifts and wreaths of flowers, but with
contempt and obloquy. I received a boatload of letters full of
defamatory epithets, veiled insults, threats of bodily injury,
miscellaneous vilification and cheap humor, all of which material is
now in the hands of my lawyer. I shan't have any of these people
arrested, but I intend to scare them, and serve them right. I had
hoped to awaken a wholesome and healthful interest in something very
close to my stomach, by no means to cause a national uprising
resembling in some respects the worst days of the French Revolution.
I had supposed that in this great country, for which our forefathers
fought and fell, there was still room for a calm, dispassionate
salute to the sardine. I wonder!</p>

<p>My secretaries and I have succeeded in dividing my detractors into
three characteristic groups, always active at the birth of great
inventions and iconoclastic ideas. The first, consisting largely of
people who know what they like, charges that the sardine and onion
sandwich of Jones's Island is a tissue of barefaced lies from start
to finish, wholly without precedent and inimical to the best
interests of the home. The most unreasonable member of this group
says there is too much sex in sardines, when we all know there isn't
nearly enough. Such ravings as these are too ridiculous to answer. I
shrug and pass on.</p>

<p>Next come some disgruntled and embittered highbrows who say there
is nothing new in it at all. One housewife signing herself "Beware"
states that my sandwich was a staple article of diet in Ur of the
Chaldees, was a well known food among the lower classes of the lost
continent of Atlantis and figures to-day at every state banquet of
the Ipi-Ipi tribe in Central Africa. "Furious" writes that the fossil
remains of a sardine and onion sandwich, even to the cauliflower
pickle, were discovered in Java beside the jaw-bone of
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, the famous ape-man, and now rest in a
glass case at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A visit to the
institution failed to corroborate this report.</p>

<p>More difficult to cope with are those, mostly cranks and fanatics,
inventors of perpetual motion machines, squarers of the circle and so
on, who admit that my sandwich might go far if it were completely
changed according to enclosed plans and specifications. "Pro Bono"
strongly advises the substitution of apple jelly for the onions and a
fried egg for the sardines. "Brown Eyes" suggests that I stuff my
sardines with raisins, spinach, chestnuts, truffles and prunes, and
other recipes were just as bad. What is the history, what will be the
fate, of a mind capable of conceiving sardine dumplings? What of such
a person's family, friends and neighbors? I am almost tempted to tell
"Mrs. X.Y.Z.," who recommends a cocktail composed of equal parts of
gin, vermouth and sardine juice, with a dash of bitters, that our
penitentiaries and homes for the feeble-minded are full of
housekeepers who have let their thoughts run upon things not half so
monstrous. To reflect upon such recipes as these is to gaze into the
abyss and darned near to fall in. No good can come of these obvious
distortions of fact, these triflings with fundamental logic, this
utter lack of respect for what is fitting and proper. (Don't let me
lose track of you, "Brown Eyes.")</p>

<p>Moreover, the lady who wrote that my sandwich is already in the
cook book is wrong. There are plenty of recipes for sardine
sandwiches, but they all begin, "Skin the animal, pound the remainder
to an unrecognizable pulp, add lemon juice and call it something
else." That's not my sandwich. Nothing distresses me like seeing
sardines gas-piped, tortured, mutilated and put through meat-choppers
as though they were but senseless gobbets of cat-meat. I know of
<i>chefs</i> who have wasted the best years of their lives trying to
make a sardine look and taste like a candied violet. All one can say
of them is that their idiosyncrasy may have kept them from
maltreating some other poor fish. I see no immediate danger in this
psychosis and would not seek to stop it unless the patient becomes
unmanageable. Nor do I wish to interfere with the pleasure of those
housewives who glorify our hero with all the trappings of romance,
such as bouquets, pink icing, ostrich plumes and electric lights. It
may be different in the city, but out here the sardines themselves
don't expect it. To me such goings-on indicate a total
misunderstanding of the nature of the infant herring.</p>

<p>For they are but infants, if not in actual age, as the herring
flies, at least in comparison with great, hulking us. My heart goes
out with something akin to pity as I behold a flock of them in their
tin kimono, poised, it might almost be, for a sportive gambol in
their native element. You get the same effect when they are gently
placed upon their slices of cool and iridescent onion. There they
lie, bless their hearts, shining like so many brilliant butterflies,
ensorceled untimely into frozen immobility, a picture by a master
hand. Where are the eyes of our painters that they can rush from such
a sight in search of the nearest stray sheep or cow? Why must every
still-life consist of a pitcher, a banana and a deceased quail? Why
not sardines for a change?</p>

<p>I shall be fully repaid for an afternoon of creative agony if I
shall have contributed in however small a degree to the revival of
the sardine. Too often it is looked down upon by fish who haven't a
fraction of its charm and brains. Imagine a Long Island
fluke&mdash;the dumb thing!&mdash;high-hatting a can of <i>Clupea
pilchardus</i>. People are prone to pass it by with the thoughtless
remark, "Oh, it's only a sardine!" To-day it is but a modest,
hard-working, unassuming little creature, the butt of unfeeling jokes
and the plaything of destiny. To-morrow&mdash;who can say?
Personally, I consider the sardine the fish of the future. Already
there are signs and portents. I see by my almanac for 1912 that there
were in that year fifty-five sardine factories operating along the
coast of Maine alone, the total annual output being between
125,000,000 and 200,000,000 cans. That's the spirit! Let the good
work go on, until there are plenty for every growing girl and boy in
this land!</p>

<p>In closing, I would disabuse my readers of any lingering suspicion
that the sardine is a lowborn, illiterate or otherwise socially
undesirable fish. You may be surprised to learn that it is named
after Sardinia, an island in the Mediterranean Sea measuring 164 by
61 miles and containing a population of 9,308 when my reference book
last heard. In the original Greek a sardine sounds exactly like a
quotation from Homer. The peripatetic philosophers of
antiquity&mdash;perhaps Aristotle himself&mdash;held it in much
esteem as an aid to high-pressure cerebration, while legend
attributes much of the oratorical skill of the great Demosthenes to
his habit of holding a couple of sardines in his mouth while
practicing.</p>

<p>Yet it is not for its glorious past, not for the glamour of the
noble line from which it sprang, that I sing the sardine. I am no
snobbish climber of that sort. Pomp and circumstance have nothing to
do with my friendships. I take a fish as I find it, and I've never
been fooled yet. Well, hardly ever!</p>

<h3><a name="HARD-BOILED_RECIPES" id=
"HARD-BOILED_RECIPES"></a>HARD-BOILED RECIPES</h3>

<p>I may have mentioned that my cooking is not so hot. A great deal
of my intake is raw or already prepared for the human pantry by the
manufacturer, so that I have found it unnecessary to do much
stove-work. My usual course is simply to buy or borrow the food, and
eat it; warming it up or not depends largely upon the weather, the
amount of time I have to spare, my idea of what is important in life
at the moment and previous condition of servitude. I find that most
things can be managed without all this stewing, boiling and frying
that goes on in so many homes&mdash;hard, unyielding substances can
be soaked to advantage before chewing.</p>

<p>I suppose what I do is plain cooking. I really have no culinary
secrets to pass on, not what you would call culinary (pertaining to
the culinary art), unless it's the little first aid rule I happened
to discover by chance and couldn't do without: When you smell it
burning, it's done. That is why I offer herewith none of my own
kitchen inventions, but some recipes kindly provided, after much
coaxing, by the crew of the Zachs Inlet Coast Guard Station, visiting
clammers and miscellaneous inhabitants of Great South Bay and the
open spaces thereabouts and appertaining. These recipes may explain
why Coast Guards can tie a half-hitch or merely why there is always
good eating and plenty of it at government stations and such; and the
boys better not get sore about it, either, for they agreed for the
good of the service.</p>

<p>Fire Island Hoorah!&mdash;This virile dish, as described by a
constant user, may account for not a few of the brilliant feats of
seamanship out where the liners run aground every so often. Slice
your salt pork, cut fine in small giblets, fry it out. Slice your
potatoes, either fine or in eight pieces. Slice your onions. Cook
your potatoes ten minutes. Add your onions and cook twenty minutes.
Then if you want pastry, or what we call slippery slats, in it, add
your slippery slats and cook ten minutes more. These slippery slats
are biscuit dough. Forty minutes all told. Add corned beef if you
want it. Ye scribe, who always becomes flustered and all mixed up at
the first word of a recipe, begged for further details, but Portygee
Pete insisted that any one who wouldn't understand the thing as it
stood would never understand it if he explained all day.</p>

<p>Skimmer Chowder.&mdash;First catch your skimmers. These are large
sea clams that come up on the surf in coolish weather. They must be
gathered in the early morning before the gulls get up or at night
while the gulls are out somewhere. Use the heart and the eyes (any
passing beachite will explain this). Grind in chopper. Warm your
kettle and put in finely chopped salt pork until fried out. Add
chopped onions, get them brown, and if you want a gallon of chowder
add about five potatoes or so and cook until these are done. Add your
skimmers (forty or fifty) and boil fifteen or twenty minutes. Add
large can of tomatoes and cook as long as you want to, as it gets
better and better. Then knock off work and call it a day. The fact
that skimmer chowder appears to involve moving to the seashore and
staying up all night to obtain the major premise need not deter the
chowder addict. It's worth it.</p>

<p>Condensed Milk Sandwiches.&mdash;You almost have to be a hermit or
a Coast Guard to have these, unless you can go to a wreck in a
blizzard, miss a couple of meals and find the ingredients in the
partially submerged galley of the sinking ship. Just slice the bread,
open the can of condensed milk with a rusty nail, combine and thank
your lucky stars. Toasted, five cents extra. Whoever sneers at this
delicious concoction has never frozen three toes while engaged in a
thrilling rescue at sea, as Pete did and was, and I got pretty cold
watching it all. I may add that in the Argentine they do much the
same thing in their sober senses, only they take two days to it and
call it <i>dulce de leche</i>&mdash;and it isn't half as good. Thirty
million sandwiches are consumed daily in this country, and I see no
reason why they must all contain apple sauce, nasturtiums, goose
livers, prunes and shredded pineapple. Pete thought condensed milk
sandwiches too humble to mention, but I say credit where credit is
due. Still, there's nothing like a ham on rye.</p>

<p>Poor Man's Duff.&mdash;Take six cups flour, four teaspoons baking
powder, pinch of salt, and sift all together. Mix one cup molasses
and one cup hot water and pour into the sifted flour, stir to a thick
paste, add enough cold water to thin the paste a little. Grease pan
with butter and pour in the batter. Bake forty minutes&mdash;you
ought to put a dash of butter into the batter, too. You can steam
this in a duff pan if you can get one&mdash;two or three hours; if
so, better add some suet and raisins and maybe some ground nutmeg.
Swell. This is fine for keeping hermits good-natured, if it isn't all
gone by that time. When you come on Comanche wangling one of these
pones you may well guess that he has the last West patrol and that
the tide is raising all Hades and all the flashlight batteries have
been dead for two weeks. It sort of makes life worth living.</p>

<p>Lima Bean Treat.&mdash;Throw one pound of lima beans into a kettle
of water, add about a quarter of a pound of salt pork, salt to taste,
and cook about three hours. Then put them into a pan or baking dish,
add about two tablespoons of molasses and plenty of water, place
strips of bacon over the beans and bake another hour. If some higher
critic says they're not done yet, grin&mdash;there's always a
suspicion in government mess-rooms that somebody forgot to put on the
beans until just before dinner. Lima bean treat provides a welcome
variant of the most persistent motif in beach cookery. It gives you
something out of the ordinary, without encouraging a dangerous
tendency towards rare and exotic foods. It's a novelty, yet at the
same time it's not beefsteak smothered in mushrooms. Don't we know
it?</p>

<p>Able Seaman Custard.&mdash;Take eight eggs. Beat up. Put in your
milk and water. Stir it up. Put in pan. If you make it out of
condensed milk, you put in only one tablespoon sugar; if not, use
more. Take it out as soon as it gets thick. If you don't take it out
then, it goes to water. You can put flavoring in, too, but if you do,
it's liable to go to water. This makes about half a gallon. This
verbatim recipe by one who has actually done it for years is not to
be sneezed at. All that about going to water if you flavor it sounds
extremely odd, but who knows? Why have it at all if it isn't
flavored? I get the feeling that in this custard perfection of form
has been achieved at the expense of soul. What I say is, let it go to
water; at least you have the vanilla. If you're willing to eat
unflavored custard for fear of a little water, why not just forget it
and eat something else altogether, such as pickled pigs' feet or
tomato soup? The catch in this recipe is that I have eaten it and it
was grand.</p>

<p>Cape Hatteras Pie.&mdash;The custard problem at Jones's Island was
recently thrown into the wildest confusion by a pie, if such it may
be called, baked by Shanghai, a normal youth of twenty-one with no
pathological history and only one deck court against his
record&mdash;for an error in conduct having nothing whatever to do
with pies. The main point wherein this custard pie differed from all
other custard pies ever observed on this stretch of the Atlantic
seaboard by the most experienced pie-observers, was that the crust,
which Shanghai swears he last saw in the conventional place in the
bottom of the pan, finished on top and half an inch thick at that;
and what with the custard going to water, it had to be handled, if at
all, as a spoon food. It is probably not worth while trying to solve
the mystery whether Exhibit A resulted from improper manipulation of
the ingredients at birth, a faulty conception of oven temperatures,
or both, with complications. Shanghai is hazy about the details, as
he was taking care of the horse at the time, and couldn't give the
pie his full attention. Anyway, he was never meant for a <i>chef</i>,
and only tried it because he had tired for the nonce of climbing the
flagpole, jumping off the barn, putting the fifty-pound weight and
walking on his hands. He's not the pie-making type. The worst of it
is, Shang says he got this creepy item out of my own cook book. He
never! I have no pie recipes calling for gunpowder, cylinder oil,
blue paint and a traveling crust.</p>

<p>Zachs Inlet Bread Pudding.&mdash;First you get about eight or nine
slices of bread, see? Just regular white bread, maybe stale, and you
break that up into small pieces, put in a baking dish and pour about
two cups of milk over it. Then you get another dish and break up five
eggs and put in a cup of sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla and beat
it all up together. Then you put eight cups of milk in with that and
stir it all up together and pour it all over the bread and milk in
the baking dish, see? Sprinkle a little cinnamon over it and put in
the oven with a hot fire for about thirty minutes. Then you let it
cool, and it's done. This will do for a crew of about eight men. The
skipper likes it, and he ought to know. This could probably be eaten
hot, but the boys seem to want it cold, as it was cold the first
time. See? Sure, you could pour on some kind of dip when you eat it,
but what's the use? This is a very popular dessert at Jones's Island,
and all the Anti-Bread Pudding Leagues on earth can't stop us.</p>

<p>Hog Island Potatoes.&mdash;Under this somewhat <i>outr&eacute;</i>
title lurks nothing more astonishing than half a peck of fried
potatoes. But what fried potatoes! The outstanding feature of this
recipe is that you needn't worry about the temperature of the
grease&mdash;there's a deal of superstition in all this scientific
talk of having the grease smoking or not smoking, whichever it is,
before you hop off. Just fill the bottom of a gigantic skillet with
large lumps of shortening, wait until this is partly melted and add
your heap of sliced boiled or raw spuds. Prod from time to time;
don't stir too violently, or you'll be recovering most of your meal
from the stove and the floor. Pretty soon they're done. If you never
ate these, you don't know you're living. Giving the grease and the
tubers an even start seems to add a certain staying power to the
dish, and I am convinced that the extra nourishment obtained in this
way is of economic importance, so much of the Crisco soaks in.
Anyway, Hog Island potatoes are guaranteed to warm your gizzard as it
will never be warmed by a portion of effete French fried, especially
if you garnish with ketchup. We cook plenty, our ideal being a slight
superfluity rather than the elegant insufficiency you mostly get
ashore. If some of my readers prefer to think that the charm of Hog
Island fried is due to certain inborn characteristics of the potato
rather than to the sheer culinary skill of the Zachs Inlet boys, well
and good. It's pretty hard to ruin a potato, I must admit&mdash;it
has so darned much sense. By the way, what's become of potato
soup?</p>

<p>Codfish Chincoteague.&mdash;All writers on piscatology are
expected to mention the fact that the great Vatel, <i>ma&icirc;tre
d'h&ocirc;tel</i> to the Prince de Cond&eacute;, committed suicide
because the fish did not arrive in time to serve it to Louis XIV.
Consider it mentioned. We don't have that kind of fish here, and if
Louis XIV ever came to Jones's expecting more than his share, he'd
probably hear some home truths that would do him no harm. I might
even go so far as to repeat the old saw, "The Bourbons have learned
nothing and forgotten everything." My directions for codfish
Chincoteague are rather vague, as Pete was in a hurry, but read
between the lines. If you find a big codfish on the beach, and its
gills are red, it's a good one. Lug it home, cook some potatoes until
nearly done, boil the fish in another pot until ditto and unite the
two, adding onions, carrots and rutabagas. The net result is a pretty
kettle of fish, one I wouldn't trade for two of those tunny omelettes
that Brillat-Savarin made such a fuss about. Codfish Chincoteague is
really a dish fit for a king, at least one of the smaller kings;
anyway, it goes great with bos'n's mates, and even with warrant
officers.</p>

<p>Roast Duck.&mdash;Rattlesnake Ned says you clean your black duck
and put him in a pot of water with pepper and salt and parboil him
until he begins to get tender&mdash;about an hour. Then take him out
and put him in a pan with a little water, pepper and salt, stuffed or
unstuffed, stick him in the oven for two hours, adding a little water
from time to time to keep him from scorching. You can stuff him with
oysters, onions and potatoes if you want to. But Ned says the best
way to cook a duck is to stew him. The first thing you do is cut him
up in small pieces and put him in a pot half full of water with
potatoes and turnips and let him cook until you have a thick gravy,
and if you're smart enough you add biscuit dough for dumplings. The
stew is fine, but somehow I run to roast ducks, which I eat at the
station in season. I love ducks, but by the time I prepare one for
roasting, the first wild desire to eat the bird has passed forever.
It takes the romance all out of the duck. Besides, ducks have too
many feathers. Chickens have enough, but ducks! Figure two roast
ducks to a man.</p>

<p>These few recipes ought to start the beginner on the right road. I
only wish I could remember how Buttercup fixed Minnie the Muskrat the
time that Uncle John ate her, thinking she was stewed rabbit. I
should like to publish Harvey's biscuit directions, but he's left the
service and is probably making some woman a grand cook. More fragrant
memories arise of the superb slumgullion created by Rockaway Red out
of the less said the better, and God knows where he is now. I have
not tested these recipes in any germ-proof laboratory, nor counted
their calories and vertebr&aelig; by the latest standards, but I can
testify that I have weathered many a storm, many a cruel blow of
fate, by consuming them in carloads in their native haunts. The men
who have eaten them for years in quantities which by every rule of
cubic contents should prove fatal, are alive and well. I can assure
you that instead of going to hospitals and morgues in perfect droves,
they keep right on rowing out to wrecks and taking sick dietitians
ashore to the doctor. It may be the sea air.</p>

<p>What I say is, take a chance. Try some of these on your friends
and enemies. Real for-sure cooking calls for nerve, the kind of nerve
that drove our hardy forefathers across a continent in search of
gold, that freed us from the tyrant's yoke, that buoyed up
Christopher Columbus and Genghis Khan and Maria Theresa and Carrie
Nation and all that sort of thing. I only hope I have not balled up
the contents too much. It is surprising what a difference leaving out
two or three essential ingredients will make in something to eat;
it's even worse than putting in four or five wrong ones. Here's
hoping!</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HOME_IN_BUM_TASTE" id=
"THE_HOME_IN_BUM_TASTE"></a>THE HOME IN BUM TASTE</h3>

<p>I am constantly reminded by articles in the old newspapers and
magazines left at Jones's by duck hunters and such that the
Inartistic Home is one of the crying evils of the times. Now what,
exactly, do these writers mean by this concerted attack upon so
venerable an institution? Reluctantly and with a heavy heart I am
forced to conclude that they mean me. In fact, a good ninetenths of
the contemporary movements for state, federal, mental, moral and
unclassified reform seem to be aimed directly at your humble hermit.
How about it? I was going to write a rather refined essay on the
Bungalow Beautiful before I realized, at the last moment, that I
myself was probably one of the main obstacles to the progress of the
home in this country. I blush to admit that I then thought of
deceiving the public. I was all ready to describe the interior of my
shack as though it were the real, original corner stone of the
American Renaissance, simply bursting with Old Masters, expensive
chenille hangings, bibelots and all that&mdash;if I have any
incunabula, it's not intentional and they must have been brought by
some visitor (Memo: Look up incunabula; they may not be what I
think). I was about to begin, "The outside of my shack is not so
good, but once you step inside, ah!"</p>

<p>Well, all that is out. After wrestling with the demon of
temptation all one morning and consulting several standard
authorities in the afternoon I had to confess that my qualifications
and possessions entitled me to write nothing more stuck-up than a
piece on the House Horrible or words to that effect. It is my firm
intention to do better from now on. Meanwhile, in what follows, I beg
the patient customer to read between the lines a sincere sorrow for
my past, apologies for the present and glowing prophecies of the dawn
of a new day for interior decorating on Jones's Island. It will take
time to change the whole nature of a bungalow that has grown up
without the faintest notion that it was breaking the heart of
Professor Santayana and other experts on &aelig;sthetic theory, but I
believe it can be done&mdash;though it may not come in our day. I am
cheered onward by the words of a famous consultant who once declared,
"There never was a house so frightful that it could not be made over
by the exercise of time, money, brains, patience and luck into
something considerably less hideous." That's the spirit!</p>

<p>Not that I was in complete ignorance of the vast and splendid
literature of the subject. The trouble seems to be that the books on
home furnishing never apply very well to the place where I happen to
be living at the time, if I may except that useful work, "Hints and
Don'ts for Decorators." What would be right and fitting for the Hotel
Rambouillet or Madame de Pompadour's boudoir at Versailles might
appear affected, bizarre or actually effete at Jones's Island. People
would talk. They might act. Lately I've been trying to straighten up
the place, but I wonder how the net results would strike, say, Elsie
de Wolfe, whose excellent volume is on my shelves. Just between you
and me, I doubt if she would be greatly shocked. She'd be sure to
find me a good excuse under suitability, adaptation to environment,
<i>habeas corpus</i> or some such thing. The blow seems to fall
hardest upon those who were brought up in a barn. There, I hope that
will stop a few of the sarcastic remarks!</p>

<p>I never said that my house looked like Tiffany's window, but I do
maintain that it is homey. When I gaze upon the scene in my living
room I feel most poignantly the full force of the old saying that
there is no place like home. You can tell it has been lived in, and
it takes a heap o' livin' to make a house look the way mine does. An
alleged humorist once countered this favorite observation of mine
with the crack, "Yes, it looks as though it had been lived in by the
Wild Man of Borneo." I had to laugh at that myself, but the fellow
didn't get far if he was trying to draw me out about my early days. I
simply took him by the ear and led him to a newspaper clipping
showing that Silvester Hendershot, the original Wild Man of Borneo,
recently passed away in his home town, Plattesville, Wisconsin, at
the age of eighty-two, proving that I could not possibly be the same
person. Some confusion exists on this point because Silvester lived
in a shack, seldom shaved, had been quite a dude in his youth, took a
drink now and then, once helped a man to sell fish and died in the
poorhouse. Why, I never even met Al Ringling.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few words on my living room, modest as it is, will be
welcomed by those who are planning to spend the summer at the
seashore. My dear old living room! It is here the family would gather
on chilly evenings (in case they had nowhere else to go) beside the
great open fireplace, if I had a family and believed in open fires in
bungalows. As one who has fought several beach conflagrations just
because some sentimental souls love to conjure pretty pictures in the
flames and watch the varicolored sparks from the driftwood set things
afire, I confine my sparks to the kitchen range, where they belong,
and advise others to do likewise. I do my plain and fancy conjuring
with the assistance of a cast-iron stove, and have had no complaints.
I believe the fires I mentioned started outdoors, but the principle
remains. Furthermore, I wish to make public announcement, in response
to practically continuous inquiries, that the reason I have no great
open fireplace in my living room is that I do not want one. Is that
plain enough?</p>

<p>Entering this main room, then, directly from the kitchen, my
guests seldom fail to register strong emotion. I much prefer hearty,
ringing laughter to the hollow groans a few of the critics feel
called upon to emit. The extremely low wooden ceiling gives a few of
these sensitive souls a painful premonition of impending doom,
somewhat as if they had been struck on the dome with a heavy, blunt
instrument, and doubtless the impression of being picked on from
above is intensified if something heavy falls on them from the
shelves which peep coyly out atop the lintel. Perhaps I ought to ask
somebody what kind of paint would give the effect of height to this
room, but I'm afraid it wouldn't work. When a ceiling practically
hits you on the head it seems a feeble joke to strive for an illusion
of height with mere color. Supposing I painted it a light cerulean
hue, as has been suggested, you would only feel that the sky had
fallen on you. Personally, I admire the natural wooden walls and
ceiling. They remind me of the old Georgian paneled libraries in J.
S. Fletcher's detective stories, but others get the feeling that they
are hopelessly imprisoned in a large drygoods box. I had quite a bit
of trouble with the first few claustrophobes who entered this
enclosed space; it took hours of psycho-analysis and the threat of no
supper to bring them around.</p>

<p>You will note that I have avoided the term "drawing room," but the
apartment may be so designated on state occasions, as when an editor
or a rich relation hits the beach. It may serve as well as a parlor,
plain salon, or even saloon. Observed in its hours of ease, it is
best thought of as a combination gymnasium, prize ring, tannery for
musk-rats and minks, fish market, delicatessen and jumble sale. If
you prefer to call it just a place to throw things into, see if I
care.</p>

<p>I advise hermits and other beachites to struggle desperately
against overcrowding in their living rooms. Mine is a trifle too full
for a place that was much too small to begin with. Such permanent
features as the large ship's table that floated in one stormy night,
the kerosene cooker that I got from Perc Arnold, the huge Elizabethan
sea-chest that Harvey made me to keep my sheet in (Memo: Get another
sheet, in case&mdash;it's simply ridiculous to have only one sheet),
the tool chest, spare stove, china closet, wood pile, clothesline,
book shelves, wash tubs and chairs, not to mention the smaller loose
furniture, take up more mileage than can be spared, and rather huddle
the foreground from any point of view. I've had to give up all
thought of adding a day bed, chaise-longue, sofa and hatrack.</p>

<p>Mental torture and physical injury are bound to result from such a
clutter. My ideal is so different, too. Where simple dignity and Old
World spaciousness are the desiderata, I am forced to navigate among
my treasures with an electric torch and a cane even in broad
daylight. Yes, the problem that confronts the hermit of to-day is how
to achieve a classically serene interior, keep the kindling in out of
the rain and give shelter to the tons of impedimenta needed for the
four seasons. The clothing alone essential to the first-class, up and
coming hermit, exclusive of town wear, is roughly the equivalent of
that required for five trips to Europe. Naturally, the general effect
of my living room is more Gothic than Greek and more Hester Street
than either. On a busy day it looks more than I could wish like the
young of a couple of pushcarts.</p>

<p>I don't worry much about the dogma that too much furniture swamps
the owner, all I ask is to get around without breaking my neck. I
can't see that it matters whether it's the furniture that swamps you,
or something else. Nor do I care whether or not certain pieces of
furniture tend unduly to dominate the personality of the owner; what
I say is, if the furniture has the more striking individuality, let
it go ahead and dominate&mdash;that's life.</p>

<p>I have possessed but one really important piece of furniture, and
now that, too, has vanished. I was awfully fond of my piano, but it
had to go during the blizzards of '26, when I had run out of fuel. In
that grim hour I was forced to choose between art and immediate
freezing, and I left art flat. I decided to live on and try to help
others, if I ever found any one worse off than myself. For the piano
it was a noble end. It had seen everything, contributing in fullest
measure to the joy and gloom of existence, first as an eager, romping
aspirant in vaudeville, then in a worthy Long Island family, later as
a main attraction at Savage's Dance Casino and finally in that
sinister port of missing pianos, a hermit's lowly cot. Anyway, most
of its strings had snapped in the sea air, all of the keys stuck but
three and it had never been the same since the field mice moved into
it. But I'm all out of practice. I will not say, like Paderewski or
somebody, that missing a single day's practice fatally flaws my
technique, but three or four years does certainly cramp one's style.
I believe my touch is not entirely ruined. My chromatic scale is
still a marvel of its kind, on a straightaway I am as loud as ever,
but my arpeggios are not what they were. And my grace notes!</p>

<p>So now I can put my two chairs where the piano was. When I have
more than one guest the house is sold out. The chairs represent no
particular period, as I am no slave to that sort of thing, my
invariable rule being to take whatever is offered and no questions
asked. In that way I have worked up in the summer colony quite a nice
little opposition to the Salvation Army; going in for periods would
complicate things a lot. That's why my house seems a little weak on
Sheratons, Duncan Phyfes, and Louis Quatorze, whatever they are, and
long on Early Jones's, Tenth Avenue and Mid-Flatbush. Some day I
shall have a roomy, upholstered Queen Wilhelmina chair and other
evidences of altered fortunes: a Chippendale here, a Hepplewhite
there, with perhaps a few priceless bits of Cinque Cento, William and
Mary, Will and Isabel, and so on. Just at present I comfort myself
with the reflection that somewhere, sometime, there may have been a
period that looked like my house. There must have been. If there
wasn't, there is now.</p>

<p>Anyway, no one can say that in furnishing my shack I have been
motivated by the vulgar desire to impress people with my wealth and
social prominence. Such things as I have I just scatter about in a
manner that strikes me as sort of Baroque without being Rococo; that
Smart Aleck said it reminded him of the fashion in Rome just before
it fell. As for antiques, I am a skeptic. I might get an old Spanish
triptych, just for the fun of it, but would I know where to stop?
When I read in a recent novel of a Gothic side-chair with voluted
ears, cabriole legs, carved knees and ball-and-claw feet, I could
only ask myself: Whither are we drifting? I can understand living
with voluted ears, and carved knees are all right in their place. One
might, or might not, get used to ball-and-claw feet. But there has
never been a cabriole leg in my house, and, God willing, there never
will be.</p>

<p>In my own home and in those of the friends whom I sometimes advise
on art, I am inclined to a kind of informal conventionality in my
management of background, balance, abstract design, boule work,
calcimine, Chinoiserie, egg-and-darts, dadoes, gros pointe, galloons,
light, shade, movement, portieres, ruffles and love-seats. I can be
daring in these matters, but I prefer the cautious, pseudo-accidental
approach&mdash;it gets you more in the long run. Or maybe I just let
nature take its course. Harking back to periods, my six biscuit boxes
with their glass covers and their red and green paper jackets
represent modern progress, as does my emergency shelf of gayly
caparisoned tin cans; over against these sensational accents the
decrepit, rusty gas-heater speaks in no uncertain terms of the rich
heritage of the past. I don't go in much for mirrors, having only the
one over the kitchen sink for shaving purposes&mdash;a single, chaste
expanse of waves-of-ocean glass, and I can't stand <i>that</i> much
longer, as I've told everybody these last five years and more. I
suppose I could wangle some grand spots of color if I joined the Make
Your Own Lampshades movement, but somehow I don't. Or I could see
about some more paint. The trouble is, when you're using remnants of
gift paint on things that other people have thrown out for a very
good reason, you get kind of discouraged about art.</p>

<p>Throughout my home I have been very sparing in my use of chintzes;
indeed, of all drapes, throws, spreads, doilies, antimacassars and
lace and other curtains. My only exhibits of that kind are my two
beloved felt lambrequins with the tinsel birds, my pair of pillow
shams embroidered in a Medusa-like pattern of writhing serpents and
the remains of a luncheon set neatly stamped with a frieze of poison
ivy. I mean to do something with the piece of rare old chintz or
percale I found in the attic, but I always lose my nerve. It is a
very artistic chintz in red and brown tones, apparently illustrating
a plague of scorpions in the mating season. Another quaint greenish
scrap seems to be the seven-year locusts alighting on a field of
spinach or the defeat of the Armada. I guess I'll save them till
Christmas.</p>

<p>Doubtless I should add a word on my <i>objets d'art</i>. I am
quite devoted to the knickknacks I have picked up along the ocean
front, such as bottles, boxes, baskets, toys and miscellaneous
whittled items. I like to think that they have floated through the
Seven Seas straight to my little shack, and I always take it amiss
when people tell me that these prized souvenirs have obviously come
off the municipal garbage scows. My walls are too full of old
overcoats to permit of anything like a representative collection of
Rembrandts. I have hung a few quietly garish Christmas cards, a
framed photograph of the Aquitania, and a vigorous still-life of some
of Mr. Burpee's sweet peas. That's about all; and don't let any one
tell you that I have a stuffed fish.</p>

<p>Some of the faithful may be moved to ask whether, after all, my
house has meaning. Who knows? I have never sought to pry into its
secret. If it has one, I consider it none of my business. Does my
living room, as one curious theorist inquired, express <i>me?</i> I
sincerely hope not, but I'll think it over some day when I'm feeling
much, much stronger and more optimistic. Some say that a man is
judged by his lambrequins, but I'm not so sure. It all depends
whether we are what we are&mdash;and there are some very glib
arguments in favor of that position&mdash;or what we want to be.
Well, I certainly want to rid up the shack. And, so help me, I'll do
it yet. Still, it does seem as though we are what we are! I wish I
hadn't mentioned that.</p>

<p>As the chief object of my house and its contents is to help me
write book reviews and sundry away from the maddening superfluities
and confusion of modern city conditions, you may wonder where I
perform my typewriting prodigies in the midst of the phantasmagorical
mess that is my dwelling. The answer is, wherever I can temporarily
clear off a square foot of space among the millions of things I have
lugged out here from New York to simplify my life with. Mostly on the
kitchen table, between the soup, the clams, yesterday's dishes, a
bucket of laundry and nervous prostration.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="COFFEE_PLEASE" id="COFFEE_PLEASE"></a>COFFEE,
PLEASE!</h3>

<p>Five million housewives&mdash;or is it ten?&mdash;are asking every
morning, as regular as clockwork, "What shall we have for breakfast?"
Of course, I don't really believe it any more than you do, but that's
what I saw in an ad. All history goes to prove that many of these
ladies would be asking other things at the time: do they look like
slaves? is this Russia? what did they ever see in you, anyway? and
why don't you get up and get your own breakfast, you great big lazy
loafer? Some would not be speaking to the family at all, and others
wouldn't be home yet.</p>

<p>The fact remains that if only four and five-tenths housewives (God
bless 'em!) are wondering what to have for breakfast, steps should be
taken. You can't expect them all to eat Dusto; and if they did, their
matutinal riddle would remain unsolved. Dusto is all right in its
way, it's a welcome change from Gritto, but it hasn't brought the
millennium.</p>

<p>It seems a little strange to a certain bachelor that the husbands
of all these housewives, with their (the husbands') more impressive
cranial measurements, have not done something to answer or otherwise
silence this eternal query. If I were married to a housewife who
asked me each dewy morn, as I was trying to get a wink of sleep,
"What shall we have for breakfast?" I would simply reply "What have
you got?" or "Anything you want, dear!" If she kept it up I should
add, "Look in the pantry, darling, and act accordingly, and you may
be sure that whatever you bring me on my tray will be perfectly okay
with me, and would you mind slipping me the morning paper,
Angel-face?" A technique for stubborn cases may easily be improvised
from what we know of the Cro-Magnons and Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Poor single creature that I am, with no domestic catechism to
rouse me from my sodden slumbers, no silvery children's voices
happily and loudly demanding their fodder at peep of dawn, not even a
hound dog to inform me with playful barks, howls, yowls, yelps and
yips that I ought to be up and eating, and hence with no great store
of wisdom about the family breakfast problem in its more unfortunate
aspects, how can I hope to bring a little sunshine into the lives of
these five million bewildered housewives, some of them very pretty,
too? Well, at least I can tell what the years have taught me about
breakfast for one, trusting that in some mysterious way the seed will
fall upon&mdash;will fall&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh, you know what I
mean!</p>

<p>Myself, just to make it harder, I happen to be a breakfast hater.
Arising promptly on the stroke of noon, unless the mosquitoes, green
flies, birds, cats and nightmares desire otherwise, I drag myself by
force of habit a couple of yards to the breakfast room, alias
solarium or kitchen, seat myself at the table, relax, and worry about
things in general for ten or fifteen minutes, unless it's too cold to
worry sitting down. In freezing weather I carry on the same line of
thought while splitting some kindling to build a fire to melt the
tea-kettle to thaw out the pump to get a drink of water&mdash;a
routine which seldom fails to confirm me in my morning outlook upon
life and love. I just seem to be like that. After reading fifteen
success books and subscribing to a go-getter magazine I am still
unable to face returning consciousness with anything approaching the
gladsome grin recommended by the authors. I only know that all is
lost, and that nothing can help me unless I inherit money, strike oil
or go to work.</p>

<p>It was not ever thus. My memory is not what it was, but surely I
recall a lad who used to greet each newborn day with pagan
p&aelig;ans and miscellaneous minstrelsy as he leapt like a young
lamb or a gazelle or something for the nearest cereal, and the devil
take the hindmost. He would gobble up scruts by the quart, he'd as
soon ruin half a peck of oats as look at them. Let us waste no tears
upon him. He was a foolish youth enough, and he knew not half as much
as I know. Or <i>was</i> I thataway? No, now that I think it over, I
never was. These people who rise so happy and gay get worse as time
goes on. You can't cure a thing like that.</p>

<p>May no uncharitable reader judge me too harshly for hating
breakfast. I have my lovable moments. Grant me forgiveness for those
ten awful ones while I am trying to cope with things as they are and
wondering what, if anything, can be done. Some mornings it is not so
bad, as when somebody has written to me and told me that if I keep on
reviewing detective stories for fifteen or twenty years more
everything will be all right. But as a rule I'm terrible. You would
swear that nothing but a miracle could make me human, and you would
hit the nail precisely on the head. I keep a supply of miracles on
the shelf right over the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>Coffee! With the first nip of the godlike brew I decide not to
jump off the roof until things get worse&mdash;I'll give them another
week or so. With the second I think I see a way of meeting my monthly
insurance premium, and I simultaneously forgive the person I heard
saying that I was not half as funny as I thought I was. From then on
I get foolisher and foolisher, or wiser and wiser, according to the
point of view. As I drain the last fragrant drop I am conquering the
world single-handed by the invincible force of my own wits, building
a palatial yacht to sail the Seven Seas with a large party of my
dearest friends and leaving at home the ones who never appreciated me
when I was poor and practically starving to death. Honest, I'm not
nearly so unbearable when I am in my cups.</p>

<p>Even more marked effects are likely to appear as I imbibe my
second beaker and light my seventh Lucky from the ashes of my sixth.
Perhaps I might be seen to smile or heard to chuckle softly at some
invisible good thing in the circumambient air. I think of a
philosophical gambit which, with a little tinkering, will do to
impart to some one worthy of the gift, dash nimbly to the portable
and write it to a long-suffering friend, colleague, severe critic and
favorite novelist whose name may be indicated by the cabalistic
letters Is-b-l P-t-rs-n. I should be reviewing a book or chopping
wood, but what do I care? Why reck of to-morrow when to-day is here
with all its infinite promise and I am full of coffee? I've really
much to be thankful for. It might be worse. I'm perking on all
four.</p>

<p>That's about all there is to my breakfast, and those who care to
classify me as a coffee lover rather than a breakfast hater are
within their rights. I prefer the gentler epithet as more suited to
my generally fair and mildish disposition afternoons and evenings.
The intense pleasure I derive from my favorite beverage&mdash;you can
keep your old gin!&mdash;will probably strike some readers as a mark
of luxury and decadence akin to the worst excesses of Vitellius, the
lusts of Claudius and Commodus, the nameless debauches of the Regency
and the unbridled orgies of Park and Tilford. I don't mean it that
way. I get a lot of fun out of my two cups of breakfast coffee, but
at the same time I try to restrain myself. I can't see the harm so
long as I confine the parties to my own kitchen.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways of making coffee (magic berry, aromatic
draught, amber beverage, fragrant libation, ambrosial potion, etc.,
etc.&mdash;If I had the nerve I could burst into an ode beginning, "O
more than Heliconian fount! O super-bean!"&mdash;but it wouldn't do).
Many the methods, and each and every one of them goes with me.
Whatever answers to the name of coffee and can deliver the kick that
proves its royal birth is always sure of a welcome in my interior. I
drink it as the good Lord meant us to drink it, without any such
atrocities as milk, cream or sugar. I take it hot and strong, but I
shan't shatter your illusions with any other portion of my recipe; it
might turn out that I use a powdered brand, in order to avoid
grounds, extra dishwashing and other agony. Add boiling water and
gulp.</p>

<p>People exist, of course, who must have the right old pedigreed
Java or Mocha. They roast it in their own homes, and for all I know
they go to Asia and pick it themselves, to see that there's no
nonsense. Most of their days are spent in strange grindings,
distillations, filterings, white of egg and other mental quirks. For
them several hundred kinds of coffee-pots have been invented,
patented, tried and thrown away, showing what the perpetual motion
boys do in their spare time. Perhaps the best of these devices
contains a condenser in the lid to catch the aroma, a stabilizer to
prevent lateral tipping, a triple magneto to carry off the volatile
oils, shock absorbers to modify the coal-tar by-products and a talkie
attachment to save more steps for mother. Is this sort of thing to go
on, fellow citizens? All I say is, Voltaire had no such coffee-pot,
nor Balzac; no, not Napoleon himself, a coffee-bibber in the true
heroic mold.</p>

<p>In the good old days, when dietetics was in its infancy, coffee
was much esteemed as a digester, and it seldom failed to do the work.
Lately a famous authority has found that it somewhat retards the
process of peptic transmogrification, though only slightly in the
case of ham and eggs, the inhibitory effects being due entirely to
the tannic acid and the favorable ones to the caffeine. My
grandfather found just the opposite. The most striking pronouncement
I have seen on the subject says that "1,000 grains of the wood,
leaves and twigs of the coffee tree yield 33 grains of ashes, or 3.3
per cent"&mdash;a rather minor triumph of research, but one to be
kept carefully in mind. The fact is that coffee is not so good for
gout, but I never have gout. Tea-tasters are said to get quite jumpy
at times as the result of too much tannic acid (about the same amount
as in coffee), but in the natural course of events they would
probably get jumpy, anyway.</p>

<p>Supposing that coffee is bad for very sick folks, the main thing
is to keep well enough to handle your six cups a day. If that is too
much, what's medicine for? It is my firm conviction, founded upon
many years of practical observation, fairly wide reading and partial
baldness, that everything we poor mortals do, eat, drink, smoke or
chase, especially the nicest things, bring us just that much nearer
the dread, inevitable end at about a mile a minute, so why not take
our choice as we go along? It seems unreasonable of the doctors to
expect us to totter to our graves in a perfectly healthy condition.
Anyway, in my opinion these perfectly healthy people are full of
prunes.</p>

<p>The caffeine is what I'm after. Delightful alkaloid! It would ill
become me to dilate upon its virtues as a brain stimulant, a sure
softener of every angularity and asperity of character, a charming
begetter of geniality, generosity, good looks and high moral
standards. Its effect upon the cerebral cortex is especially notable,
and I believe that as soon as the human brain has improved a bit some
worthwhile results are bound to follow. Its influence upon literature
has been tremendous. Under the strong nervous excitement caused by
coffee, some of the worst drivel extant has been conceived and
written; but there have been many exceptions. Use more caffeine, my
friends. And if nothing happens, don't blame the coffee.</p>

<p>"If you want to improve your understanding," wrote Sydney Smith,
"drink coffee." A seventeenth century author states, "Surely it must
needs be salutiferous, because so many of the wittiest sort of
nations use it so much." And a contemporary essayist, Mr. P. Morton
Shand, taking issue with De Quincey, a tea-addict, tells us that
"coffee has always been considered the drink of intellectuals." What
is much more important and deeply fraught with social significance,
another authority, writing in 1872, brings news that coffee "has
suppressed to a great extent that excessive indulgence in inebriating
draughts that so frequently dishonored the banquets and prodigal
hospitalities of former times." And as luck will have it, Professor
Binz finds that dogs which have been rendered comatose by alcohol may
be aroused by the administration of coffee. Doesn't that just show
how all things work together for good?</p>

<p>I wonder who started it all. It seems that on its native heath the
coffee bean, consisting of two halves placed face to face and
enclosed in a toughish husk, is found inside the fruit of the
<i>Caff&aelig;a arabica</i>, and how any one ever had sense enough to
take it out, husk it, dry it, roast, grind, boil and drink it is
beyond me. What if he had given up, lost his hunch, picked some other
fruit, stepped on a bee's nest? How do people find out these things?
Some say it was goats; that a poor Dervish of Arabia Felix, noticing
a singular hilarity in his goats upon their return to camp each
evening, followed them and found them chewing the berries in a high
state of illumination, so he tried it and passed it on. So much for
the goats.</p>

<p>Another legend ascribes the discovery to Hadji Omer, who stewed
some of the berries while hiding from the police near Mocha in 1285.
He was acquitted, presented with a purse of gold and turned into a
saint. Others say coffee came from Abyssinia. However, according to
the account of Schehabeddin Ben, an Arabian scribe of the ninth
century of the Hegira (and a merry old robber he was, too), the true
discoverer of our berry was none other than Gemal Eddin, a Mufti of
Aden, who ran across it in the Persian pharmacop&oelig;ia. Three
rousing cheers for all of them, for Schehabeddin Ben and Gemal Eddin
and Hadji Omer and Abyssinia and the goats! And we mustn't forget
Soliman Aga, the Turkish Ambassador who introduced coffee at the
court of Louis XIV. One of my favorite pictures shows Soliman in his
nifty palace at Constantinople, reclining not unvoluptuously upon a
sinfully upholstered sofa with his whiskers, his chibouk and his
memories, about to receive a cup of his special brew from a damsel
who may be a Nubian slave, but who looks suspiciously like a houri.
Pretty soft!</p>

<p>Coffee, I may say, is the one bond between me and that none too
moral monarch, Louis XV, who, when he entertained that mischievous
baggage, Du Barry, always treated her to a potful. Said he on a
rather too frequently mentioned occasion, as he downed his brimming
bowl, "What would life be without coffee?" Then, casting a roguish
glance at the lady, he added, "What is it <i>with</i> coffee?" Rather
neat as a <i>bon mot</i>, of course. The ideology is sound, the wit
and humor are grand; but I think the king might have reserved his
wise-crack for a more appropriate audience. Goodness knows Du Barry
was doing her best, as usual, at considerable risk to her reputation,
too, and he might at least have thought up something more chivalrous,
such as "A cup of coffee underneath the bough, another cup and thou."
Still, that's not so elegant, either. The whole incident must be
regarded as decidedly distressing.</p>

<p>As I am about to close I get the uneasy impression that these
breakfast suggestions may not prove so helpful to the five million
housewives as I had intended. Coffee seems to be all I want, but
sometimes, when faced by unexpected guests, I bring out the pancakes.
My constant craving for cinnamon buns can be gratified only on trips
to New York, but I see no reason why others should not breakfast upon
them. Furthermore, my reference works show that people of all times
and places have managed to get through the first meal of the day on
such items as baked apples, prunes, raspberry jam, dehydrated
peaches, synthetic apricots, oatmeal, hominy, fried mush, warmed-over
potatoes, kidneys, kedgeree, codfish balls, crumpets, veal hash,
pickled pigs' feet, ham, Sally Lunn and fritters regardless. And I
believe somebody has suggested eggs. My notes also reveal the use of
canned spinach by an eccentric citizen who was shot the same day. It
may have been just a coincidence.</p>

<h3><a name="DIOGENES_OR_THE_FUTURE_OF_HOUSEKEEPING" id=
"DIOGENES_OR_THE_FUTURE_OF_HOUSEKEEPING"></a>DIOGENES, OR THE FUTURE
OF HOUSEKEEPING</h3>

<p>You may not believe it, but there are people in this world who
want more and better housekeeping. They are all about us. They have
their secret codes, their private meeting places and an organization
as utterly ruthless as it is efficient. They will stop at nothing.
Their propaganda, spreading hither and yon through a vast network of
underground channels, begins to permeate the practically impermeable
populace. Are we, brother and sister housekeepers of America, going
to let them put it over? We probably are.</p>

<p>Still, that needn't prevent us from taking a firm stand.
I&mdash;drat that old first person singular pronoun, anyway! Ugh! I
could almost say Ugh-h-h!&mdash;I have a plan. I have some
housekeeping secrets of my own, and it's just dumb luck that I didn't
carry them with me to the grave. I've held out against the publicity
of it for years, but as some one has put it so splendidly: What are
we here for, if not to help others? So I've decided to hand on the
torch. It may not do much good, but I hope it worries some of these
pure and spotless domestic scientists.</p>

<p>The trouble is, my system of home administration is so unusual,
not to say daring and sensational, that I can hardly look for
anything but muttered curses and vindictive backchat from the
hidebound pedants who dominate this branch of learning. Taboos and
conventions are so omnipresent and powerful in this field that my end
will doubtless be that of every idol breaker of the past. To that
consummation, however, I have long been reconciled. For the final
reckoning I am content to await some distant epoch when civilization,
as we know it to-day, shall have changed quite a bit; when, as some
of us fondly trust, it shall have disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>What I call, if I may do so without overstepping the bounds of
modesty, the Cuppy Plan of Motionless Housekeeping, has one grand
central purpose in view: the salvaging of many hours each day for the
poor drudges who find themselves caught in the domestic treadmill for
one reason or another (but chiefly the latter) which it is now too
late to laugh off. The hours thus saved may be spent in going to
movies, playing bridge, listening to the radio, attending auctions,
jawing the family, annoying the neighbors, explaining the symbolism
of Ibsen's dramas or in any other delightful and educational sport.
Myself, I employ the minutes snatched from the maw of time in
composing filler for the newspapers, replying diplomatically to my
creditors, wondering what everybody has against me, anyway, and in
plain, fancy and miscellaneous hermiting. Pretty slick, eh?</p>

<p>Visitors to our island are always wondering how I get my housework
done. "He's always taking a sun bath on the sand, or wading in the
bay, or chasing the birds with a club or talking to himself as he
splashes in the surf," they will tell you. "Or else he's shut up in
his shack writing all day and all night until four o'clock in the
morning. He positively never does a single lick of work." Little do
they suspect that the hermit of Jones's sails through life with the
magic assistance of Motionless Housekeeping, or Swaraj, based upon a
policy of complete noncooperation with external objects. No wonder my
career is one long holiday, without a care in the world. It's my
system.</p>

<p>Like all big scoops in the sphere of ideas, my scheme is simple,
almost to a fault. It verges upon the simplicity often observed in
certain innocent villagers, but I like to think that it escapes the
pathological by the hair's breadth that makes all the difference. To
come to the point, the Cuppy Plan stresses the elimination of useless
motions, a technique not wholly unknown to the elders, but never
hitherto developed beyond the rudimentary stages; thus, while looking
fearlessly towards the future, it is based upon that foundation of
petrified precedent without which nothing, however snappy, can hope
for ultimate success. Its intrinsic novelty inheres in the fact that
I carry the theory and practice much farther than other authorities;
indeed, to its logical conclusion. Where the pioneers sought merely
to reduce the number of motions involved in the traditional household
tasks, I cut out the tasks themselves. I issue the bold and sweeping
challenge: Why make any motions at all?</p>

<p>I became interested in Swaraj some years ago while reading a book
on how to systematize the loading of pig iron. As pig iron is not
indigenous to Jones's Island, and as I was at that time perfectly
unacquainted with any pig iron loaders, the volume, though inspiring,
left me about where I was in regard to ways and means. Then, one
eventful day, I chanced upon a monograph which applied the same line
of reasoning to the boiling of eggs. Some fortunate iconoclast, by
one of those mysterious associations rightly known as genius, had
bridged the gap between pig iron and eggs. Gosh, how it all comes
back to me!</p>

<p>There it was in black and white, proof positive that any
able-bodied adult could cook three eggs with only fifteen movements
instead of the customary twenty-seven, merely by employing a fireless
coddler and scrapping the old-fashioned stove and dipper. Since I
owned only two eggs and no fireless coddler (and I am far from sure
that I approve of such a queer, to say the least, contraption), I
passed an active morning testing this great invention in a saucepan.
Laboratory conditions weren't just right, of course, but the
experiment taught me that once you start counting your movements you
might as well abandon all pretense to spiritual freedom. We aren't
adding machines, now, are we?</p>

<p>Well, I got so balled up trying to omit motions that cannot
possibly be omitted, and so nervous trying to remember which was my
right hand and not to look at the clock and not to repeat the
eleventh motion that I fell over the broom handle, broke the eggs and
went hungry. The next time I boiled eggs I dragged in a lot of new
useless motions just for spite. Nevertheless, the adventure left its
mark; I began to realize that one must save a part of one's energy
for fun and not use it all up boiling eggs. I fry them now, and any
domestic scientist who doesn't like it can lump it. Coddling,
indeed!</p>

<p>Once I had conquered the habit of boiling eggs I found it easy to
give up more and more of the inside jobs which have done so much to
make the home what it is. For instance, I applied Motionless
Housekeeping to the making of beds. I understand that in most
families one day of the week is set aside for the making of beds. I
gain this whole precious day by omitting the festival and all its
works. At one blow I annihilate the two million motions which the
average housekeeper expends yearly upon this drab and tiresome
proceeding. While others are making beds I am making money by
reviewing books. Some day, when they are in Bellevue from tucking in
sheets and fluffing one pillow too many, I shall be in Wall Street.
What on earth is the use? Make your bed, if you will, lavish upon it
all the skill of all the bed makers since time began, then go
virtuously to sleep in it, and next morning where are you? Right back
where you started.</p>

<p>More priceless moments are gained by forgetting to sweep. Why
disturb the rhythm of a glorious day with this hideous, dusty and
frightfully uninteresting rite? Sweeping may be left for occasional
fits of neatness which overtake even hermits at odd intervals. The
alleged dirt on my floor which several society leaders have been
tactless enough to point out is perfectly clean dirt, such as old
newspapers, magazines, detective stories, pencil ends, orange peels,
lettuce leaves, eggshells, small lumps of coal, kindling, shavings,
sawdust and sand. What's so disgraceful in that? There isn't a germ
in the whole heap, or you may be sure I'd fire it right outdoors and
let it shift for itself.</p>

<p>Those who adopt the Cuppy Plan will do well to operate at first on
a regular day-by-day schedule, until the little grooves get
established in the brain. Divide the week into seven equal parts
called Monday, Tuesday and so on, toss overboard all that you were
taught during your formative years and act accordingly. Well, then.
Monday washing is optional. If we Motionless Housekeepers prefer not
to do Monday's wash, we don't wet a hand; and that disposes
definitely of Tuesday's ironing. On Wednesday, do not mend. There's
half the week gone already in good, constructive achievement.</p>

<p>We agreed, I think, about Thursday's sweeping, and I need not warn
my disciples against starting anything whatever on a luckless Friday.
Bachelor housekeepers mostly devote Saturday to much needed rest and
recreation; the ladies, certainly those who want to stand well with
W.C., will get up bright and early, dash to the kitchen and bake at
least one gigantic strawberry shortcake, or I won't guarantee
<i>any</i> kind of housekeeping&mdash;and there's no law against
sending it to some deserving hermit.</p>

<p>It may prove helpful, and the moral harm practically nil, to spend
a part of each Sunday in searching for household necessities that
have been lost in the shuffle. That's the one little weakness of the
Cuppy Plan, you never know where the can-opener is. Short of
attaching it to one's person with a piece of stout cord and dragging
the rest of the essentials about on a leash, there is no way of
getting around that sort of thing&mdash;you just have to put up with
it. Why not make capital of this small fault? You need never
subscribe to a memory strengthening course if you try to remember
that the nail that pries open the pantry door is probably under the
newspapers in the corner behind the stove, that the salt water soap
doubtless got mixed up in the winter woolens and extra bedding on the
tool chest (where it's as good as in a safe-deposit vault), that the
review of J. S. Fletcher's latest must have blown out the window and
that the Coast Guards borrowed the camphorated oil summer before last
that time Comanche had the lumbago. I couldn't swear to where much of
anything is in my house, but it's not as if I had spectacles to lose.
I haven't the faintest where my dustrag is, and I care less. I
haven't seen it in the last six months, and good riddance.</p>

<p>My official list of things not to do in the kitchen alone would
fill volumes. Censored activities include making your own mayonnaise,
chopping raisins, putting things through food-grinders, dropping a
pinch of flour into the hot fat to keep it from sputtering (Good
land, let it sputter!), scalding milk, dropping the white of an egg
into the soup to clarify same, wrapping a damp cloth around the
cheese to keep it moist, adding melted butter to the pancakes so that
you won't have to grease the griddle&mdash;you will, anyway&mdash;and
sifting the flour. There are a few natural born flour sifters who
simply cannot be stopped, unless you hide the sieve on them. They
sift anywhere from six up to ten and twelve times. Let them have
their fun in their own way. They can't help it.</p>

<p>Then there is the menace of beaten biscuits. "Beat thirty
minutes," "Beat two hours," "Beat three days," the experts will tell
you. Do no such thing, if you have to eat cake. I know it is
considered very elegant to cram your guests with beaten biscuits, but
the strain is really too great, as many an ambitious climber has
discovered. Many a fine old Southern family has dwindled, drooped and
finally disappeared from history's page just on account of this
widespread evil. Many a Kentucky and Virginia belle in the prime of
life has gone the biscuit route. Beautiful, charming and talented as
they were, where are they now? They're one with Ozymandias, that's
what. Just fragrant, fleeting memories, martyred before their time to
the beaten biscuit tradition. And how could it be otherwise, having
to leap out of bed in the middle of the night to lash the eternal
batter for breakfast? It is not too much to say that all the labor of
those millions of Egyptian slaves who built the Great Pyramid of
Gizeh was as nothing to the vital energy expended on beating biscuits
every day in this broad land of ours. Won't you help?</p>

<p>I may also mention the ungodly amount of parsley scattering that
goes on in our homes. Picking parsley apart and strewing it
regardless here, there and everywhere over the table has done its
share in retarding the progress of evolution. The place for this
plant is in a bouquet or a wreath, as the Early Greeks were aware.
Crowned with a dime's worth of parsley and maybe a few violets, about
the last thing an Early Greek hero thought of was Vitamin B. Warming
the plates for the rest of the family is another thankless
task&mdash;who do they think they are? Rolling fish in bread crumbs
before frying is also on the index, as is rinsing the dishes in
boiling, soapless water. Of these two futile jobs, rinsing is perhaps
the more pernicious. When I meditate upon what everybody might have
been accomplishing all these centuries instead of rinsing the
dishes&mdash;well, old worrier that I am, I get to brooding. I forgot
to say that worrying, in moderation, is part of the Cuppy Plan. Worry
a little every day, folks, I mean it. If you find it difficult, take
a good, square look at some of the people who never, never worry, not
even about split infinitives. That's exactly what ails them.</p>

<p>Glancing back over this article, I fear that the heat of passion
has led me to exaggerate in spots. The truth is that the Cuppy Plan
of Motionless Housekeeping is as yet rather a glowing ideal to be
held ever before the mind's eye than an accomplished fact in all its
details and ramifications. I have gone only a part of the way, but I
retire each night with the pleasing consciousness that I have balled
up the domestic science program as thoroughly as lies within my
powers. At present all I have to do in the morning before sitting
down to write is to find some wood, call a Coast Guard to fix the
pump, wash a cup for the coffee, clear off the supper table, mend the
window, hang out the wash, empty the ashes, tack a new leg on the
chair, look for the pencil and paper and feed the cat. I can always
find time between paragraphs to fill the lamp, gather more driftwood,
clean up what I spill, soak the beans, do a little baking, run over
to Crow Island on an errand, put out a few meadow fires and swat the
mosquitoes. Later, I hope for complete success. I may move into a
nice, new tent.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SECRET_OF_FREDERICK_BARBAROSSA" id=
"THE_SECRET_OF_FREDERICK_BARBAROSSA"></a>THE SECRET OF FREDERICK
BARBAROSSA</h3>

<p>If had it to do over, knowing what I know now&mdash;well,
naturally, I'd do the same thing all over again, only more so. One
boon, however, I should beg of fate. Instead of reviewing books, I
should ask to be appointed owner of a ham and egg store, so that a
constant supply of my favorite food might be always at my beck and
call. And every time I went bankrupt I'd hide a part of the stock for
future reference.</p>

<p>Not just for solitary gorging, either, though solitary gorging has
its place in any harmonious and well rounded existence. It would be
my aim to harness this peerless provender to the remnants of the play
instinct which have come down to us from the laughing childhood of
the race in spite of all the laws of those Medes and Persians. I
should amuse myself every few evenings by giving banquets of ham and
eggs to all comers, the noise whereof would rise and drown out the
stuck-up protests of the fancy feeders of to-day, and the trimmings
of which would do much to make my guests and neighbors forget the
disappearance of the corner saloon.</p>

<p>I dare say that with a little shopping at the chain stores and a
couple of varlets presiding at the kitchen range while I acted as
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, my banquets might have surpassed,
at least in quantity, those of the celebrated gourmands of antiquity.
Had things been different, who knows but that the name of a certain
hermit might have gone down to future ages somewhat as that of
Lucullus with his sacred mullets and that of Heliogabalus with his
spiders in aspic; it would be synonymous with ham, as, in our own
day, Edward W. Bok immediately suggests asparagus with nutmeg and as
the mere mention of Roy L. McCardell evokes visions of eggs
mushroomette.</p>

<p>Predestination, however, seems to have spoken in no uncertain
terms. A wholesale ham and egger I can never be, but must remain an
eternally frustrated hawker of these gorgeous groceries. Whenever I
see a happy proprietor in his store I must be content to murmur,
"There, but for my unkind stars, go I!" I must live out this thwarted
portion of my life on paper, and though I am not one to pour out raw
emotions to the public view, I care not if you say I wear my ham on
my sleeve.</p>

<p>I shouldn't have thought, until lately, that ham and eggs required
a champion. I had been going along as usual, lulled into a false
sense of security by my own inherent optimism, supposing that ham and
eggs were getting on fine and could take care of themselves. How
little we know of the troubles of others! In fact, as Portygee Pete
was saying to me only yesterday, "If knowledge was power, Bill, you'd
be helpless!" Imprimis, it has come to my attention that a famous
expert recently launched a savage and totally unprovoked attack upon
them, describing them as the last drivelings of the mind of a low
grade moron and using other language which I do not care to
repeat.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the statistics, which prove that since this
ill-advised ultimatum the intake of ham and eggs among the middle and
fairly upper classes of America has fallen to an alarming extent.
Thousands of our ambitious countrymen have quit the stuff, evidently
believing that total abstention will magically make them <i>high</i>
grade morons and qualify them for social success. Have there been any
tangible results? There have not, excepting that throughout this
broad and fertile land there are mobs of uneasy and bewildered
stomachs that should have known better than to turn against an old
friend on the say-so of a perfect stranger. And the pity of it is
they didn't get into the Four Hundred after all.</p>

<p>I do not intend to lose my temper at the moment, trusting that the
need for violent words&mdash;and deeds!&mdash;will not become acute
once the better nature of my opponents has had time to assert itself.
I have faith that the sturdy, protein-fed backbone of the nation will
not buckle without a fight before the voluptuaries who are seeking to
substitute <i>mousse jambon &agrave; la Tuileries en casserole,
&oelig;ufs &agrave; la Espagnol</i> and other foreign folderol for
you know what. Ordered exposition, the mechanical marshaling of vital
statistics, the latest findings of our research scientists, the
evidence of Grimm's Law&mdash;what are all these beside the living
senses of all sane citizens? It will be a sorry day for civilization
when the majority of folks think otherwise.</p>

<p>Let us put our trust in intuition rather than in a mass of
cold-blooded statistics that wouldn't lend you a nickel for carfare.
Let us come out boldly and admit that ham and eggs are responsible
for very much of the so-called progress of our species. I would
almost go so far as to say that the race has experienced two supreme
moments. When the first man stood upright upon two legs and cast his
quadrupedal heritage to the four winds of heaven, there, my friends,
was front page news. Was it not a far, far better thing than he had
ever done when his wife conceived the idea of cooking some ham and
some eggs on the same hot stone, inquiring the while in paleolithic
poetry, "How'll you have 'em, straight up?" I pause for a reply. As
for facts, if they do not string along with us, so much the worse for
facts. If the whole scientific fraternity should come out here to
Jones's Island, beat on the front door of my shack and demand my
proofs that ham and eggs are one of the prime causes of high thinking
and beautiful living, I should step quietly to my front porch, raise
my hand for silence, and quote the memorable words of a hermit of
old, "<i>Credo quia impossible est!" I</i> guess that would hold
them.</p>

<p>Who has not loved them? I believe that if all the secret memories
of our great geniuses could be brought to light, if we could look, as
the gods do, into the inmost hearts of our poets, if we even owned an
encyclop&aelig;dia or an anthology, we should find more than one
splendid tribute to the dish we celebrate. I recall few, if any,
indisputable references to ham and eggs, as such, among the early
Greeks, though they knew their ham. So little of Sappho's work
remains that we cannot speak of her views; we only know that she
jumped off the cliff, and even that isn't so. The Stagirite preserves
silence upon this single point, a circumstance not without deep
significance to students of psychology. Of certain obscure and
doubtful remarks by Simonides of Ceos, Meleager of Syria and
Philippus of Thessalonica I say nothing, permitting the intelligent
reader to draw his own conclusions. If the weight of all this
accumulated testimony does not convince the skeptic, what has he to
say in answer to &AElig;sop's superb fable, "The Pig and the
Hen"?</p>

<p>When I think how the authors of our own day neglect this subject I
am moved to wonder what we are coming to, if, indeed, we have not
already arrived. A world wide questionnaire of some time back
revealed but one writer courageous, far-sighted and
&aelig;sthetically sound enough to come out for ham and eggs as his
favorite tipple. That was Mr. Will Irwin. Would that he and his
trenchant pen might take up the good fight where I leave off; I feel
that a book by him on this matter would express much better than any
word of mine the true Spirit of the Frying Pan. Herewith I reproduce
his recipe, preserved for all time in the pages of "The Stag
Cookbook"&mdash;may it go sizzling down the ages as it so well
deserves. Lookit:</p>

<p>"Take a frying pan and some ham. Cook the ham in its own fat in
the frying pan; cook until the ham is well dappled with golden brown,
or until it is cooked enough. Then break some eggs. Take out the ham
and put it on a hot platter, then put in the eggs. Baste them a bit
with the hot ham fat. Put a cover on the pan and let the eggs cook in
the hot pan with no fire. A minute or two will do&mdash;then serve
the eggs with the ham and&mdash;oh, boy! For the very best results
use the best ham you can get and plenty of day old eggs."</p>

<p>Other famous Wills are notoriously fond of the same. Bill Williams
of Fire Island, Will Midget of Amagansett and Willie Watson of the
Zachs Inlet Coast Guard Station practically live on it. Dr. Will
Durant has not been interviewed, but he is too much of a philosopher
to spurn a dish that was once described&mdash;was it by
Nietzsche?&mdash;as the very corner stone of the new ethics. You
can't tell me that Will Shakespeare overlooked this bet; the sonnets
alone prove the contrary. Among other users I need but mention
Christopher Columbus, Daniel Boone, Alta May Coleman, Ninon de
Lenclos, Copernicus, Rutherford B. Hayes, Lois Blaker, Josephine Bell
Horton, Mr. and Mrs. Eugene R. Tappen, Henri D&eacute;sir&eacute;
Landru and Dr. and Mrs. August J. Raggi. Perhaps I have made it clear
that the fans are almost always persons possessed not only of
distinguished ability in the arts, sciences and miscellaneous, but of
decided personal beauty and charm. A safe rule is that nine out of
ten persons who like ham and eggs have It.</p>

<p>This brings us by a process of elimination, or <i>non
sequitur</i>, or something, to Frederick Barbarossa, history's most
outstanding example of ham and egg addiction. That is, the old
chroniclers say he was passionately fond of ham, and it is my theory
that they forgot the eggs. Only upon the supposition that Frederick
Barbarossa called loudly for ham and eggs at certain strategic points
in his career do the moot problems about the Holy Roman Empire become
childishly simple. Only so does Frederick become a human being
instead of a mere abstraction with the title of Holy Roman Emperor, a
red beard and some frightfully hard dates.</p>

<p>If it can be shown that eggs as well as ham were obtainable in
Frederick's early environment, I think my contention may safely be
accepted as a working hypothesis, such as the well known hypothesis
that the planets revolve about a central sun in orbits, or elliptical
black lines; it need hardly be pointed out that so intelligent a
person as Frederick Barbarossa was quite capable, even in childhood,
of putting two and two together. Well, his father was the Duke of
Swabia, a place fairly reeking with eggs; the young Frederick
probably spent many a happy summer vacation on the farm of his
grandfather, Henry the Black, in Bavaria, another hotbed of poultry
products. What's more, the boy's mother (the daughter of Henry the
Black) was a Welf, while the other side of the family was
thoroughbred Waiblingen; truly a weird heritage, accounting for some
of the inhibitions, warring factions and morbid strains in
Frederick's personality. Fortunately ham and eggs was the one thing
the Welfs and the Waiblingens were not continually fighting about, so
our hero was spared that, at least. But if, as I strongly suspect,
the Welfs and the Waiblingens were the same as the Guelphs and the
Ghibellines, the poor child had enough troubles trying to figure out
which was which&mdash;in our day a completely lost art. Through it
all he grew up, waxed strong and flourished mightily. He knew what he
liked.</p>

<p>Frederick's subjugation of Italy fits right in with my thesis. The
Lombards put up a game struggle, but he fixed them in the end; what
would the Lombards win on, anyway&mdash;broccoli? It was only when
Frederick's supplies gave out that he encountered his few defeats.
His crusade against Saladin was not so much, but you can't take ham
and eggs on a crusade! On the whole Frederick Barbarossa made a
wonderful showing, and I repeat that it was ham and eggs that turned
the trick among all those powers and principalities, potentates,
podest&agrave;s and palatinates, schisms, suzerainties, Hanseatic
Leagues and other infidels. He may be one of the Seven Sleepers, but
in his day very little got by him. Where shall we find his like for
stirring precepts, noble deeds and real, honest to goodness horse
sense?</p>

<p>He was a great one for making laws, Frederick was, and I wish he'd
made one about the sale of ham and eggs in restaurants. Step into an
attractive food palace in New York, my friends, place your order, if
you can elbow your way to the front, and what happens? "Ham and
country!" sings out the neat clerk behind the glass counter, as you
pick out an easy chair, get your glass of water from the cooler,
corral a paper napkin and sit back in a fool's paradise to await what
is to be, gazing blankly betimes at the pyramid of green bananas over
there by the pie. "Ham and country!" finally yodels the clerk again
with even more promising inflections in his Judas-like voice. Rushing
to the scene one discovers that the ham is <i>boiled!</i> Not the
smoked and then fried article on which our pioneering ancestors grew
fat and frisky, but <i>boiled</i> and fried, with results that would
not nourish even a Lombard. Country, my word!</p>

<p>This tragedy occurs thousands of times each day, even in the
better class of one-arms, where strong men go to get strong men's
nourishment to help them fight the battles of life. They ask for
he-food; they get an emaciated shaving of disenchanted and savorless
pork on which Jack Dempsey himself couldn't lick a flea. Here at
Jones's all that's different. We cook it right, eat it right and call
for another round. Portygee Pete maintains that though he has had to
doctor for it several times he has never had his full want. Same
here. Pete and I have never counted the pieces nor had enough eggs to
squander, so we really don't know our capacity. Rattlesnake Ned's
official record is said to be an hour and a half, elapsed time, using
the Goose Crick overhand&mdash;but he's southpaw.</p>

<p>Let me add a word to the young housewife who is just starting out
to get her hands ruined. Keep a good big supply of h. and e. in the
pantry. You'll find it something to cling to in the midst of
impermanence and all but chaos, something to lean up against while
you consider what is next to be done. Otherwise the day will surely
come when you'll sit down in the middle of the kitchen floor and
scream and yell at the ghastly, damnable futility of it all. It will,
anyway, but why rush to meet it? And here's a household hint, in case
your better half ever tells you that his dinner is fit for a king.
Remember what I told you about Frederick Barbarossa, and if he
springs that one on you, you just up and say, "Fit for a king, hell!
It's fit for a Holy Roman Emperor!"</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HERMITS_EMERGENCY_SHELF" id=
"THE_HERMITS_EMERGENCY_SHELF"></a>THE HERMIT'S EMERGENCY SHELF</h3>

<p>Since this piece concerns what to do when company comes, let's zip
right into the plot without bothering about fancy grammar. The
subject calls for action rather than mere rhetoric. Company, as you
may be aware, is a thing that might happen to any of us any minute,
and probably will. How are you going to meet the situation, brother
hermits of America?</p>

<p>Whoever replies "I'm going to run!" or "I'm going to jump under
the bedclothes and hide!" lays himself open to the suspicion of
flippancy, and utterly fails to reach the seat of the evil. Company
is no laughing matter. What to do, then, when a gay bevy of one's
dear friends invade the home with glad welcoming cries provided by
themselves? For one's friends, if you will forgive my putting the
matter in aphoristic form&mdash;one's friends are those persons who
always feel perfectly welcome in one's home.</p>

<p>Not that all guests are hungry (a conservative estimate figures
the practically starving ones at 99.7 per cent), but I'm thinking of
the kind of whom a wise man of antiquity remarked that they appear to
exist for no other purpose than to eat honest, God-fearing folk out
of house and home. The optimistic hermit is likely to interpret the
eager look in their eyes to extreme interest in how his rheumatism is
getting along. The disillusioned veteran, noting their furtive
glances about the shack, their sniffs to windward and their
significant prowlings hither and yon, knows only too well that they
are trying to find out where he keeps his emergency shelf.</p>

<p>There you are! The emergency shelf is the answer to the whole
problem, as you should have known all the time. Not that the shelf
alone does the trick. You might go on having an emergency shelf until
you are blue in the face, it will get you nothing without a system
and a little spare change. I hope I may hurt nobody's feelings when I
confess that I have been in many homes where they had the shelf, all
right, but couldn't seem to make up their minds what to do with it. I
feel more sympathetic towards my ravenous callers when I think of
what has occasionally happened to me. Don't be that way, dear
readers. You never know what gnawing sorrows your visitor may be
harboring under his belt.</p>

<p>It is really discouraging how few housekeepers ashore make
adequate arrangements for serving the unbidden guest with meals at
all hours. The imagination of many otherwise charming ladies who own
lovely emergency shelves soars boldly and beautifully to tea
biscuits, falters in mid-air, clutches wildly at more tea biscuits
and plunges to earth with a dull thud. Naturally, all you get in such
places is tea biscuits. That is no way to act in a world that is
jammed and crammed with good things to eat, such as&mdash;well,
anyway, what about peanut butter and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, oceans of
things (I'm no A and P bargain list!). If worst comes to worst, they
can always feed hermits what they have in the icebox, but when
hermits have company, it's not so easy. Hermits have no iceboxes.</p>

<p>If I speak briefly of my own emergency shelf, it is in the hope
that other hermits on other sandbars may draw from the account some
sterling lesson, which is more than I can do. A year or so ago, with
the assistance of Ned and Pete, I constructed a rather elegant one,
loaded it with a caviar canap&eacute;, a canned snail and a truffle
for the use of a certain critic and novelist not a thousand miles
from Hell's Kitchen, New York City, and proceeded to town to fetch
the lady. The impish creature refused to budge. She had long declined
to come, but I chose not to believe her. She proved it to me. She
never did show up&mdash;and oh, how I had been yearning for some of
those long, uninterrupted moonlit talks about Dostoievsky.</p>

<p>By that time, naturally, the canape was a pretty sight, and the
truffle but the shell of its former self. If I may intrude my private
affairs, the capricious authoress may visit me as soon as I can
arrange to have the ocean done over. She requires a special seashore
with a velvet Arcadian greensward richly pied with Elizabethan posies
and lambkins, a giant plane tree against God's own sunlight,
fountains running dandelion wine, a palatial yacht riding at anchor
hard by, and, if possible, a couple of mountains in the distance. I'm
working on all that now, but when and if my fair tormentor ever comes
out here, she'll have to take her chances on that snail.</p>

<p>Since then the poor old shelf has suffered a gradual
retrogression, not to say <i>d&eacute;gringolade.</i> From truffles
it declined to mere spuds, and of late I am afraid&mdash;I will not
actually say in so many words that I have done this, but I am afraid
that I have furnished it with the canned goods that I am none too
sure about, prunes that look awfully funny and cereals that have
outlived their allotted time. These things may be perfectly all
right, but then again, who knows? Certainly I should never think of
offering them to my guests unless I were forced to it by the urgent
demands of true hospitality. My emergency shelf is more or less of an
indoor junk heap at present, but you know how you hate to throw
things out that you have had for years and years.</p>

<p>Most of the canned goods is that half-case of spinach that Hilary
of the Coast Guards purchased ashore several seasons ago, presumably
during a spell of mind wandering, since Coast Guards are sworn
enemies of spinach, lettuce, celery and suchlike horse foods rich in
mineral salts and vitamins. As it was Hilary's turn in the kitchen
that week, he served a can of it at the regular eleven o'clock
dinner, with results that amounted roughly to mutiny in the
mess-room; granted that there is something revolting in the thought
of canned spinach at eleven o'clock in the morning, still, that was
the official dining hour, and if soup, why not spinach? There
followed an informal deck court for Hilary and a hurried trip to the
grocery lady at the summer colony, who flaunted the stuff on her
shelves all season without so much as a nibble. It passed eventually
into my possession, partly because I felt kind of sorry for the poor
spinach, and partly because hermits cannot say no. The rustier those
cans get, the wider berth I give them. If it be my destiny to dig my
grave with my can-opener, I'll be darned if spinach is going to have
the last word.</p>

<p>Fortunately&mdash;please watch this part of the narrative
closely&mdash;those who brave Great South Bay to visit me have
learned by trial and error to lug along a few bulging hampers. The
problem of what to do thus resolves itself into the question whether
I shall dive at once into the goodies or restrain myself until some
enterprising guest has set the table. Before I had my system working
on its present basis there were a few pretty sad parties at my shack.
Now it is well understood by all concerned that when company comes to
Jones's I am the emergency. Get the idea?</p>

<p>I try to be reasonable about what people bring to my shack, but
awkward incidents are bound to occur. Take the chum who arrived with
two dozen sacred eggs laid by a hen that had taken a prize at a dog
show. We did for twelve. When he left he attempted to take the other
dozen with him, and yet he wonders why I talk about him. Another
departed with contusions about the face and head, but really, three
meals of alligator pears hand running is a little too much. If I must
eat these foods that are eaten for the sole purpose of astonishing
the middle classes, an artichoke is about as far as I'll go. And I
only do that for the companionship. I've long ceased worrying about
the people who bring their own knives, forks, spoons, plates,
napkins, sheets and pillow slips; I just relax and wonder, without
caring much either way, why they came at all if they thought I had
bubonic plague. Anyway, it saves my napkin.</p>

<p>I believe I have demonstrated that it is possible to train
company, if you bring enough patience, zeal and courage to the task.
I have worked hard to perfect my system, but every lick has paid. I
can lean back now and feel fairly certain that if company comes I'll
get fed up for a while. And life being what it is, that's something.
Had I let things drift I shouldn't be sitting here now munching a
hunk of fruit cake with frosting&mdash;and candy on the frosting. If
this true story enables some other poor bachelor to get a piece of
fruit cake even half as good, my efforts shall not have been in
vain.</p>

<p>So much the world already knows or has guessed about my
hospitality, and I suppose some of you hermits, on the watch for
constructive advice, thought it a fairly open secret to be making
such a fuss about&mdash;now didn't you? Well, I haven't sprung the
real central plot yet, and the truth is I was trying to get out of
it. There is, indeed, another side to the picture&mdash;a sinister
side, you may say, but one which a starkly realistic autobiographer
may not blink. The answer is that the emergency shelf in my shack is
only a dummy, a sympathy catcher furnished with malice aforethought
for the furtherance of my system, and by that I might mean anything.
The real one, containing a considerable array of much more edible
food-stuffs, is outdoors in the cellar, its existence not so much as
imagined by my friends from the mainland. It and its contents are
strictly for myself and other islanders, hermits and dwellers in the
waste and solitary places who, for one reason or another, I could do
with a snack; not for trippers who live right next to delicatessens
and yet go gallivanting about the globe in search of quaint places to
eat in.</p>

<p>Before you condemn me unheard for this piece of manifest
chicanery&mdash;and I know how indefensible it must seem at first
blush to every decent reader&mdash;before you call me a disgrace to
my Southern ancestry, I ask you calmly to consider a few vital
statistics. In the first place, it would be quite impossible for me
to survive upon the provisions brought and left (Ha! Ha!) by incoming
guests. The report that I spend most of my time scanning the horizon
for richly laden argosies of company is a mistake. No, my friends,
horizon-scanning is not all it is cracked up to be, and any opinion
to the contrary involves a fatal misconception of the whole art and
science of hermit housekeeping. Even during the few summer months I
derive less than one per cent of my total nourishment from such a
source, and but twenty-three per cent from the summer colonists of
Jones's Island. I would be in a fine fix if I depended upon company
for calories when Great South Bay is frozen over for the winter and
people with money in the bank and anything remotely approaching
ordinary horse sense stay safe at home on shore where you don't have
to thaw out your ears every so often. These are the hard, cold facts
which I have come to realize more and more as life goes on, and which
my well-to-do acquaintances&mdash;I say it in no reproachful
spirit&mdash;must reconcile with their own consciences.</p>

<p>All of which indicates plainly that the bachelor hermit who lives
on a sandbar, surrounded in the ways of the ever-changing
seasons&mdash;and I often wonder which is the worst&mdash;either by
impassable icebergs or unendurable mosquitoes, must have more
gumption than he commonly gets credit for. What would happen if he
failed to lay up a box of fodder for the long Arctic night? What if
he gave it all to visitors, and couldn't get ashore again until too
late? What if he told everything he knew about his emergency shelf?
Well, what <i>would</i> happen? He might or he might not be
discovered next season in one of the tertiary tin can strata of his
backyard by some optimist mining for Scotch. There would be a brief
paragraph in the press advancing a new theory about Neanderthal Man
that wouldn't have a leg to stand on. After a pathetically short
interval business would go on as usual.</p>

<p>So it comes that I have something packed away in that old Haig and
Haig case in the cellar. Sometimes I take out my electric flash and
examine the cache with all the frenzy a rather unenthusiastic miser
must feel over his gold. To tell the truth, the kick is not what it
should be this year. Evaporated milk labels cease to thrill after a
while, and there seems to be an ungodly amount of canned corn for the
size of the box. Why it is that there is always so much canned corn
in my supplies, loathing the stuff as I do, must be looked into
sometime. I suppose it's just one of those things. Also, whence came
those serried ranks of shredded codfish, when, as all Jones's Island
knows, if there is one fish more than another&mdash;no, I won't say
it. The corned beef is all right, if it comes to that, but the future
would be black indeed if I didn't know that down in the bottom of the
box, under the succotash, is a big, beautiful can of&mdash;tuna fish!
But don't get me started on that.</p>

<p>Still, to clean up as we go along, I'm very fond of tuna, and
there's really no comeback to that, is there? Yet people persist in
clouding the issue with all sorts of specious arguments. A lady told
me not long since that she regarded tuna fish as a very inferior
imitation of chicken, to which I replied, "Oh, you do?" I wish I had
read that lady a lecture on the inadvisability of mixing up the
animal kingdom in that way; the tuna never pretended for one moment
to be a bird. She might better have called it a very superior
substitute for cat-salmon, and even that fails to express my
admiration. If I ever give up hermiting, I shall probably come to
terms with some one who knows 1,000 ways to feed me tuna fish, no
questions asked.</p>

<p>For bachelor housekeepers the one drawback to this food is that a
large can of it is likely to become, temporarily, one's whole
existence. You have to use it all up, and you string it out long,
long after the first sharp ecstasy has fled. Tuna salad for lunch and
dinner is fine, so is the tuna sandwich at bedtime, but by the second
day the routine begins to pall and come to-morrow you don't care if
you never see the fish again. How well I know the raptures, the lucid
intervals, the inevitable awakenings! But give me a day or two to
recuperate, and if I hear of a tuna fish in the vicinity, there I am,
waiting in line like a great big brainless ninny, for too much of a
good thing. I don't even attempt to cure myself any more. I just
admit that I like it. I must.</p>

<p>I hope no jealous codfish fan will take my words amiss. I hate to
wound any of God's creatures, a category in which we are taught to
place not only shredded codfish but those who feed upon them, not to
say batten. In fact, I had some myself only yesterday, and I'm up and
around again. We ought to bear in mind that the poor fish was not
always desiccated. It got that way through no fault of its own, and
there is no use holding a grudge.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I spoke that way about canned corn, too. Many a poor
starving heathen would be glad to eat it, and so shall I be, too,
some day when a bout of wood-splitting has roused the brute within me
and weakened my will to resist. I think I shall resolve this year to
be kinder to all foodstuffs, whatever their station in life. It
should be a lesson to me, out here on Jones's Island, that once in
the folly of youth I felt put upon because a dear old great-aunt of
mine used to bake me apple pies (with cinnamon on them!) somewhat too
often for my jaded taste. Idiot that I was, I thought that apple
pies, even with cinnamon, were not quite high-toned enough for me. To
stir my interest took peach at the very least, and to win a smile my
great-aunt had to take a day off and throw a lemon meringue.</p>

<p>Ah, well! We live and learn, or, anyway, we live. I mean to say,
right now I wouldn't speak ill of a prune. Did it ask to be
stewed?</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DUKES_DILEMMA" id="THE_DUKES_DILEMMA"></a>THE DUKE'S
DILEMMA</h3>

<p>"He had been Duke of Savoy, and after a very glorious reign, took
on him the habit of a <i>hermit</i>, and retired into this solitary
spot." You'll find that quotation (from Addison) right in Webster's
Dictionary, under the word "hermit"; and somehow it strikes me as
important. It thrills me like discovering a new family of clams down
by the Coast Guard dock or an epidemic of tar blocks for my kitchen
range. I often read it to myself when I get to brooding over
civilization in my shack&mdash;I don't mean that the civilization is
in my shack.</p>

<p>Not that Dukes, as such, impress me greatly, though, goodness
knows, I have nothing against them&mdash;it takes all kinds. But I
can't help thinking that there was a certain something about this
particular one. To have earned so fine a compliment from Mr. Addison
more than hints of sterling qualities, and getting into the
dictionary must also be accounted no mean feat, as feats go; it is
neither here nor there that the ornithorynchus, or duck-billed
platypus of Australia, got in, too. The Duke of Savoy had real stuff,
and his turning hermit surely clinches the argument.</p>

<p>They tell me I'm a bit hipped on the Duke of Savoy, just because I
sometimes work him into the conversation when ashore. Perhaps I am,
but it is not true that I ever posed as his full cousin; how could
that be when he probably lived away back in the Middle Ages? If
people choose to regard me as royalty because I'm always saying "the
Duke this" or "the Duke that," it's their own lookout. Nor have I, as
the rumor goes, been pestering the authorities for permission to call
myself the Duke of Jones's Island. That's all gossip. It's not true,
either, that I have got the Duke and myself so mixed up that I can't
tell us apart. In writing this brief sketch of my hero's life I must
confess that since I have never looked him up, either in Mr. Addison
or the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, for fear that I might find the
shadow of a fault (for such is the malice of history), the learned
reader may notice a few technical inaccuracies; none, I trust, that
matter. Worse, I must risk the suspicion of vanity in dealing at all
with one whose career, in some of its humbler aspects, so strangely
resembled my own. Some will say that this article is but a second
version of my own hermiting&mdash;a thinly veiled autobiography. Let
them say.</p>

<p>Begin we on that fateful day when the great and puissant, though
not really fat Duke of Savoy, sitting on his bejeweled throne,
surrounded by a seething mob of jongleurs, performing apes, bedesmen,
almoners, hereditary fiefs and Got wots, suddenly felt again in his
inmost soul that he was fed up with being the Duke of Savoy, and as
suddenly knew&mdash;he didn't just suppose it; he knew it&mdash;that
as quickly as possible he must become a hermit or bust. He was aware
that one more conference with the ducal seneschals, pantlers and
quhairs would be the death of him. As luck would have it, at that
very moment the court jester, a dwarf of uncanny wisdom, who alone
knew the secret that was slowly but surely undermining his master's
health and spirits, edged up behind the throne and whispered that
whereas and notwithstanding there were only twenty-four hours a day
in Savoy, there were forty-eight in a certain enchanted sandbar
yclept Smith's Island, according to signs and portents just revealed
to the ducal astrologer, who had been working on the problem for
months.</p>

<p>"The die is cast!" whispered the Duke in return, smiling the
famous smile which, only a few years before, ere the fatal secret had
embittered him, had caused not a few hearts about the court to beat a
little faster. "I hereby appoint the astrologer Count of Gex," he
added, "with all the rights, privileges and perquisites appertaining
thereunto; and you may regard yourself as chief official underskinner
to my successor, whoever he is."</p>

<p>Then he arose with dignity, sauntered slowly through the crowd of
sycophants and snoods, so as not to disturb their simple pleasures,
turned a sharp corner and streaked it hellbent for the ducal
apartments. At the very portals he hesitated at sight of a
marvelously beautiful damsel who was weaving a tapestry celebrating
his own martial adventures. Pausing only to assure himself that the
details were correct and ignoring the subtle advances of the lovely
maid, he spun on his heel and rushed into the antechamber, lustily
clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"What ho, varlet!" he cried. "Bring me the habit of a hermit, and
bestir thyself!" And to the astonished varlet who, in a trice, had
arrayed him neatly in the Middle Age equivalent of a pea-coat, army
breeches, hip boots and white hat, he merely said: "Gramercy, varlet.
I suppose you think I'm getting up another of those damfool charades,
but I'm not. I'm going to Smith's Island to be a hermit, so fare thee
well and alackaday."</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter a figure of distinguished mien, albeit quaintly
accoutered, might have been seen departing by the postern gate. In
his left hand the Duke (for it was he) carried a little basket
containing cold cuts, a few lentils, an oaten loaf and a small
quantity of salt and hyssop. Under his right arm, firmly clutched as
though it held his soul's salvation, as, in a manner of speaking, it
truly did, there rested a mysterious black box that might once have
contained something no more romantic than a pair of shoon&mdash;but
now! Essaying one last backward glance at his old, futile
environment, he saw the beauteous damsel of the tapestry riding apace
towards him upon a snow-white palfrey, and ever she wept and made
great dole. "It is now or never," said the Duke to himself, as he
closed the gate against her, and locked it. For him there could be no
turning back. Onward he strode, pressing still more closely to his
side the enigmatic black parcel, the box of mystery.</p>

<p>The scene now shifts to the wild and desolate sands of Smith's
Island, where our hero finally arrived, what by water and what by
land, with the assistance of a small shallop, trireme, felucca or
something manned by a gang of rollicking neatherds who were going
that way; it had never occurred to him before that neatherds might
rollick, but these did. The neatherds, who dwelt on a neighboring
islet and were later to prove the exile's boon companions and
advisers, refused to leave him until they had seen him safely inside
a half-portion furnished bungalow providentially provided, it would
seem, for the purpose. And there in his little crooked house the Duke
abode in comparative peace and content, considering the thing he had
come to do. The view was delightful, and his rose cold, strangely
enough, had entirely left him. On clear days he could just make out
the sea-coast of Bohemia; in the evenings, when he was not engaged at
his consecrated task, he might count the stars or watch the flashing
of the great beacon light reared upon yonder rocks. He seldom even
thought of Savoy as he sat eating his favorite sardine sandwiches,
raw cabbage and clams.</p>

<p>For in the Duke's new life clams of all sorts and sizes served as
the helpful animals so necessary to every hermit. He liked them
steamed, chowdered or alive and kicking. He also adored fried clams,
a dish which Lucullus or maybe Apicius has compared unfavorably with
fricassee of rubber galoshes. Clams really are a great convenience to
the marine, island or otherwise amphibious hermit. When all else
fails, when life seems dull and savorless, when one more bean would
make the difference between right reason and the padded cell, one can
always go out and catch a clam. In recognition of this self-evident
truth the Duke one day chuckled, "Clams are more than coronets!" He
meant it, too.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, he had to visit the dentist; and gosh, how
he dreaded those trips to Savoy. A person of charming manners
himself, he was always surprised and embarrassed when chance-met
courtiers demanded to know why on earth he had become a hermit. "'T
is passing strange," he would muse, "that people who would not dream
of inquiring 'Why are you a bee-inspector?' 'Why do your ears stick
out like that?' or 'Why does your aunt have fits?' feel no hesitation
in asking 'Why are you a hermit?'" It got to be rather a sore point
with the Duke.</p>

<p>Natheless he stood his ground. He would not, come what might,
disclose his darling secret to these curious oafs. Not though the
whole of Savoy went nutty over the riddle would he reveal until the
proper moment&mdash;and would that moment ever come?&mdash;the
contents of the ducal shoe-box. He used to enrage his acquaintances
by remarking, "I am a hermit because I like being one," a statement
which all agreed would not hold water for an instant. And once, when
his toothache was pretty bad, he so far forgot himself as to roar at
the venerable Bishop of Piedmont, "Gadzooks, it's none of your
deleted business!" In merrier mood he might explain, "It was a gal
an' the red-eye," or report that he was squaring the circle, when
everybody knew that he hadn't enough mathematical talent to mend his
own pump. To a few whom he really cared for he said, quite simply,
"It is written," or, if they persisted, "The stars have spoken." They
gave him up. Small wonder, the great world being what it is, that men
tapped their foreheads and said the devil had entered into His Grace,
the Duke of Savoy.</p>

<p>He let it go at that. And ever, as soon as he finished with the
dentist, he would hasten down a side street to the waterfront,
avoiding as well as he could the too ripe pomegranates and prickly
pears hurled after him by the ignorant little Savoyards, and
sometimes by the ignorant big Savoyards. A strange, unearthly gleam
in his ice-blue eyes, he would leap into his frail craft, seize the
oars and pull like one possessed for the open sea. Maybe he wasn't
glad, on these occasions, to be going back to his shack, what by
water and what by land, back to the sun and the stars and the sand
and the silence, back to the infinitely understanding clams, who
never asked him why he was a hermit, but just took it for granted.
Back, above all, to that cryptic repository, the mysterious shoe-box.
That very evening, by the light of his torch of dolphin oil, he
planned to lift it reverently from its hiding place under the kitchen
sink, remove the cover and take out&mdash;the rajah's ruby? I should
say not! "And the world well lost!" he would shout in the face of
wind and wave, laughing the while with mighty, oceanic laughter. Mad
he seemed, truly; and mad, perhaps, he was.</p>

<p>Wonderful, passionate nights! He often felt they were worth all of
his ten thousand nights ashore, with the possible exception of about
two hundred which he had written up in his diary and often read over
with considerable emotion. The kindly neatherds, seeing his torch
still flaring in the dawn, knew well that the man of mystery was
having another spell with his devil-box, for they had often crept up
and watched him taking scraps of paper out of it, tearing up some of
them, writing upon others with his pen of purple samite, sorting and
unsorting, laughing, weeping and chattering to himself as the endless
task went on; at such times they stole silently away again, leaving a
fresh quarter of neat beside the shack and maybe a couple of fish for
a change. They wasted very little time on the profound psychological
puzzle that was the Duke, believing, as their descendants do to this
day, that the proper study of mankind is neats&mdash;and who knows?
Still, they kept their eye on him, and sometimes returned in the
evening to fix the pump.</p>

<p>Those long, intense nocturnal sessions filled with delicious
agonies and joys, intoxicating s&eacute;ances that might have broken
a less rugged constitution, seemed to agree with the Duke. Next day
he would rise in the early afternoon, have brunch, neglect his
housework and proceed to do whatever he darn pleased. The mere fact
that he had no corner stones to lay used to amuse him no end. "By my
halidome," he once observed, "life in Savoy consists almost entirely
in killing time before it is time to go somewhere one would rather be
shot than go." Again he reflected, "Of course, the trouble with
Smith's Island is that one is sometimes lonely; but the trouble with
Savoy is that one is never lonely." Making middling epigrams of that
sort was the good Duke's weakness, if he had one. In Savoy there had
been a lot of people who hated his epigrams. "Oh, well," he had said
to one such, "there are only two kinds of people: those who hate
epigrams and those who can make them." As for loneliness, he liked
it. He was quite an introvert; and loneliness meant more nights with
the devil-box, and more.</p>

<p>Now surely that's enough suspense for one biography. The fact is,
the Duke was writing a play, as you probably guessed all along;
secretly, because nine-tenths of the other inhabitants of the dukedom
were also writing plays, all of which were bound to be very
bad&mdash;and his was different. The thing had become a public
scandal; he had often been compelled to incarcerate his own Prime
Ministers and Lord High Almoners for composing the most frightful
dramatic atrocities&mdash;the best of them mere box-office successes
catering to a low interest in sex and having no permanent effect
whatever upon the Commedia dell' Arte. He just couldn't bear to put
himself on their level by telling what he was up to, so he kept
pegging along in the privacy of his bedchamber, such as it
was&mdash;and you know how it is with Dukes. What with the eternal
banquets, joustings, pageants, processions and parties for visiting
rulers, he seldom found a moment for adding a scene, a line or even
an unfinished wise-crack to the mass of cluttered scraps in the black
shoe-box concealed under his Byzantine couch, let alone a whole night
in which to consider such vital problems as metonymy, synecdoche,
architectonics, osmosis, d&eacute;nouement and fainting in coils. The
beautiful damsel of the snow-white palfrey might have cheered him on,
but she was writing a novel and didn't sympathize with his theatrical
ambitions&mdash;and you see what <i>that</i> got her.</p>

<p>So there's the whole plot in a nutshell of the Duke's sensational
elopement from his court, the sinister shoe-box, the hermit's
mysterious nights of feverish pain and still more feverish bliss at
Smith's Island. My crystal does not show the ultimate fate of our
hero's drama. I see nothing resembling even a completed draft of Act
I, the scenario of which originally called for a metaphysical debate
between two atoms in the void, later switched to some characters
called He and She and then again included a few musical numbers, a
rope-walking artist and fireworks. I only know that he kept the
shoe-box under the sink, and every time he thought of something good
he tossed it in among the rest of the index cards, old cuffs and
crumpled bits of papyrus. His faith remained unshaken that some day,
when the characters and the action and the dialogue had got a little
clearer in his mind, it would all fit in.</p>

<p>And maybe it did. The Duke was slow but sure, and not nearly so
dumb as he looked. At least he laid definite plans for sorting out
the box completely and writing the first scene down on fair,
unspotted parchment. Each dawn he vowed to tackle the job at sunset.
Perhaps it was as well that he delayed. His was a sensitive spirit,
and so long as the play remained unfinished and unseen&mdash;I shall
not say unstarted&mdash;well, nobody could tell him that it was
terrible. As the years fled by&mdash;and they did, even with the
forty-eight hours a day&mdash;he learned to look upon his undertaking
in a way that seemed to him sufficient, as an end in itself rather
than a practical means of reforming the little theater movement in
Savoy. "At court," he said to himself, "I could never have come
within a mile of it; here at Smith's I have come within half a mile."
For all that, he kept on throwing thoughts under the sink, on the
theory that you're never licked till you quit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life was not so bad. The Duke did not require a great
deal of amusement. He'd had his fun, enough to last for years, and
some of it splendid material for the play. As he explained to
Piedmont Pete, the neatherd, "People never become hermits until they
have been around and seen a lot that no right-thinking person ought
to see; otherwise, they'd be afraid of missing something, and they
would be perfectly right." So he had his memories; emotions
recollected in tranquillity were a hobby with him. "I have a past,
and no one can take that from me," he told Pete. "Thank God, I have
something to regret." "Lord lumme," he would add, in reminiscent
mood, "I certainly had some wonderful, undesirable friends ashore."
Yet this playful old party, who had been such a son of a gun in his
youth, and who invented the morally subversive literary maxim, "Good
authoring and a clear conscience will not mix," was wont to declare,
"There comes a time when a quiet life can be quite as thrilling as
sin itself!"</p>

<p>Though he loved this quiet like good wine, and had always hated
the loud noises the Savoyards continually made, apparently from pure
meanness, it is not true that the Duke insisted upon absolute silence
throughout his island domain. He did throw things at the birds to
make them stop yelping, and tried to cure Pete of whistling, but
sometimes he felt just like having a musical evening in the shack. He
had brought his lute with him, and a theorbo and a cithern and a
psaltery, upon all of which he performed with a pensive
charm&mdash;he had never got the hang of the sackbut or the shawm, so
his recitals were always a little weak in the wood winds. Invariably
the neatherds would arrive in a body after the first selection and
oblige with folk-tunes on the cymbal, timbrel, ocarina and zambomba,
and like as not it would turn into quite a party.</p>

<p>The plaudits of the great world meant nothing to this man, though
he would not have minded taking a bow at a certain first night he
often thought of. After all, he had been Duke of Savoy! He had
reigned gloriously for a time, and you can hardly beat that for
publicity of the right sort. Distinguished throughout Christendom for
wisdom, justice, temperance and personal appeal, he had left behind
an honored name when he up and adopted the life of Reilly. That he
never tarnished, though he did little or nothing to keep his legend
alive. When the Savoyards sent special messengers to Smith's Island
begging him to mediate between powers and principalities, or when
ambassadors prayed him to accept the kingship of some orphaned
nation, he simply told them to go chase themselves and not come
bothering him with such nonsense. He never gave up his rank (such was
his common sense), but held himself in readiness, should nothing ever
come of the play, to consider any reasonable offer from the
politicians&mdash;but none of your small kingdoms or empires with
their long hours, short pay and try and get it. "In Savoy," he would
reflect, "I was a big toad in a big puddle; out here I am a small
toad in a small puddle, or vice versa, and I can't see that it makes
the slightest difference about the sizes of toads and puddles,
anyway&mdash;you can't take 'em with you!"</p>

<p>Speaking of the Duke's conversational remains, I cannot refrain
from quoting another of those sagacious phrases which have done so
much to perpetuate the fame of the grand old guy.</p>

<p>"Why be a hermit?" asked one of those pests to whom I have already
referred.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the Duke.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that the neatherds and other denizens of that
part of the ocean never thought of him, much less addressed him, as
the Duke of Savoy. They called him, in their own tongue, Guglielmo
dell' Isole&mdash;which is as much as to say, Will o' the Isles.</p>

<h3><a name="A_FEW_HINTS_ON_ETIQUETTE" id=
"A_FEW_HINTS_ON_ETIQUETTE"></a>A FEW HINTS ON ETIQUETTE</h3>

<p>Etiquette, or dog, in the original Coptic, means behaving yourself
a little better than is absolutely essential. The ancient Copts were
great sticklers for form, and you see what it got them. It is owing
entirely to the Copts, as we know from hieroglyphics deciphered by
certain scholars to their own satisfaction, that to-day at our state
banquets and in our more exclusive American homes we do not eat pie
with a knife.</p>

<p>Whether that is a good or a bad thing it is no part of my present
purpose to go into. I'm not looking for trouble. It is not my
intention to take sides on the pie question, but merely to clear up a
few popular fallacies about minor problems of good form as applied to
bachelors, especially if they happen to be book reviewers living on
Jones's Island. I am convinced that grave misunderstandings abound in
this branch of learning. So would you be if you got a letter from a
fair unknown ending, "P. S.&mdash;Do you wear a bib?"</p>

<p>Perhaps the postscript was meant in jest, but it hurt, pointing so
heartlessly at what is generally believed to be the bachelor hermit's
weak spot, namely, his table manners. Evidently my correspondent
feels that an inhabitant of Jones's Island would not be likely to
grasp the subtle difference between dining and just shoveling in the
provisions. Meanwhile I thank her for her recipe for warmed-over
beans, her gift of a patent can-opener and her sympathy, and assure
her that I do not wear a bib. I have a napkin. She would be surprised
though, if she knew how many prominent people <i>do</i> wear
bibs.</p>

<p>Moreover, napkin technique in my shack differs only slightly from
that in respectable circles ashore. I favor the red bandanna type. It
doesn't show the soup, and it makes a gay spot of color wherever it
happens to be left about the house. My napkin has seen its best days,
but who hasn't, for that matter? I'm not one to switch to a blue
bandanna just because it is said to be very chic with a deep-dish
huckleberry pie. At Jones's, as elsewhere, the napkin is partly
unfolded, if it ever was folded, and laid unostentatiously across the
right knee of the overalls. Then let nature take its course.</p>

<p>Being so much alone, though, and with one thing and another, it is
an undoubted and more or less deplorable fact that hermits do
occasionally let down in their etiquette. This is because hermits,
especially those of metaphysical bent, sometimes get to feeling, if
only subconsciously, that where there is no eye to see it, there is
no etiquette. Supposing, to put it in the classical manner, that a
hermit is eating soup at a distance of several miles from the nearest
human ear&mdash;his own doesn't count, as he is absorbed in a book;
can the sound waves resulting from the operation be said really to
exist in the sense that&mdash;that&mdash;in the sense that&mdash;Oh,
well, take it or leave it. According to the paradox of Zeno&mdash;No,
that was about Achilles and the tortoise, and when I first heard that
one I said that Achilles would eventually overtake the tortoise, and
I still say it. In brief, can social errors be committed where there
is no society? Does etiquette itself exist in such a situation?
Indeed, hermits often get to wondering whether they themselves exist.
They try to reassure themselves by repeating, "I think, therefore I
am," and even then some still, small inward voice is only too likely
to whisper, "But do you?"</p>

<p>Where life is lived amid such uncertainties and complications, you
can see how etiquette is bound to suffer. Take the book-reviewing
hermit who is trying to eat a plate of lettuce salad and read "The
Mystery of the Haunted Tooth" at one and the same time without
missing a thrill or a mouthful, and perhaps write it up to boot.
Sooner or later that hermit is going to cast aside the centuries of
etiquette, tell the ancient Copts to forget it and cut up his lettuce
with a knife and fork. After all, he figures, the main idea is to
convey the nourishment from the plate to the alimentary canal with a
minimum of accidents, and a writer is never at his best with the
salad trimmings cluttering up his stock in trade, with perhaps a
sprig of catnip or smilax worrying one ear and maybe a stray fish
thickening the plot of his review.</p>

<p>At first my whole soul revolted at the notion of cutting up my
lettuce before dinner merely that I might read, write and eat in
comparative peace and content, with a fair degree of synchronization;
but I got to thinking. It would be so easy, and who would ever know?
And then, one day, I did it! I was without the pale, but nothing
happened. In fact, my fortunes took a temporary turn for the better,
as I managed to produce from two to five more book reviews per meal,
not to speak of the saving in flying parsley, lettuce and sardines.
Naturally, I take a vicious delight now in attacking my salad with a
butcher knife when I am in a jam with my articles. "Ha! Ha!" I laugh.
"One simply doesn't do it, eh? Well, <i>I</i> do it!"</p>

<p>There is another, a darker side. Having once cut up his lettuce,
and all for the sake of worldly success, one cannot escape the
inevitable regrets. Blue devils assail one, hissing of what the
future may bring forth. Shall I finally take to hacking my pancakes,
my ham and eggs, my very clam fritters into small hunks&mdash;for a
career? Shall I come to blowing in my soup, drinking out of my
saucer, spilling crumbs on the floor and stacking my dishes? Shall I,
in a word, become an out-and-out Goop?</p>

<p>I suppose the ever present realization of my own fault has made me
something of a liberal in the matter of downing the trickier foods.
Knowing but too well that I have failed in the ordeal by lettuce, my
heart goes out to the millions of my fellow creatures who may be
trying at this moment to consume asparagus, corn-on-the-cob,
watermelon and squab in the manner prescribed by those tiresome
Copts. Some of our best brains have literally worn themselves out
inventing ways to eat green corn so that horrified observers will
speak to them afterwards, and nothing much has come of it but blasted
hopes and souls forsworn and ruined bridge-work. One keen thinker
suggests having the others present blindfold themselves in the belief
that it's all a game, and then fall to. My own system is to yell
"Fire! Murder!" at the psychological moment and have a gorgeous time
with the corn under cover of the excitement.</p>

<p>As for asparagus, the Copts themselves were rather vague, but it
should be evident to all that there is small &aelig;sthetic value in
the widespread sword swallowing or trained seal method. Any one who
has seen Mr. Ringling's sea elephant having a snack will probably
agree that everything humanly possible&mdash;particularly
fish&mdash;should be treated as a fork food. Experience, however, has
convinced me that to inhale a squab or other small bird in a way at
once sufficient unto the censors and the basal metabolism is quite
impossible. Wait until you're among friends. Many such tactical
problems arise in the eternal battle between the instinct of
self-preservation and the urge to beauty. And since we have been
countless ages learning to eat a lamb chop without getting more than
half of it into our system, it would be kind of a shame to lose the
art, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>I fear that hermits, when out in company, are likely to eat too
fast and too much, to grab the largest piece of chicken, spill the
water right off the bat, play tunes on the glassware and dispose of
grape-seeds in a manner of which the less said the better. But I
think the Copts go too far in expecting the guest to take the piece
of chicken nearest him when it is passed. Such a rule may impress the
besotted, taboo-ridden social climber, but it will never frighten the
able-bodied hermit who possesses any sense of fair play. Some
hostesses are fully capable of fixing the platter so that they will
get all the white meat. I think, therefore, that a little picking and
choosing is allowable, and if anybody objects, tell him that you're
looking for the smallest piece.</p>

<p>I have gradually cured Rattlesnake Ned, the hermit of Crow's
Island, of all his worst gaucheries except using his pocket comb
between courses, throwing butts into the finger bowl and leaving his
spoon in his cup. When these things occur at luxurious functions a
mere whisper, "Ship your oar, Ned!" or "Do you want to get us thrown
out?" quickly mends matters for the time being. It is true that he
recently assaulted and severely bit a wax pear that had been
presented to our hostess's grandmother by one of Queen Victoria's
ladies-in-waiting, but I had to laugh at that myself. I prefer not to
tell what Ned did the time he got the mouthful of hot escalloped
corn&mdash;probably the hottest thing on earth excepting hot
escalloped tomatoes. At least, they might have let me explain.</p>

<p>I should never have set up as an authority on etiquette but for
the fact that I've read it and Ned hasn't; it's in the back of my
cook book, complete from ordinary neighbors on through ministers
plenipotentiary and papal nuncios up to kings, queens and magazine
editors. If I sometimes err when it comes to a showdown, I really
know better. I have the book. I find, however, that hasty perusal of
the full directions just before going to a dinner party has a
tendency to confuse the hermit so that he's certain to do something
awful. My advice is to watch the hostess, but even then the hermit's
furtive glancing about, shifting of food from the wrong to the right
plate, juggling with forks and generally spasmodic behavior gets him
practically nowhere. Finally, when the attention of the whole
bejeweled throng has concentrated itself upon the poor goof and his
strange antics, the only thing left to do is to cut his own throat.
Personally, I try to hold fast to the thought that the fork is never
used for the thinner soups and that the drinking glass should never
be raised to the perpendicular and rested upon the nose in the effort
to drain the last drop unless the host or hostess has specially asked
you to do a trick.</p>

<p>Remember, fellow hermits, clam diggers and oyster tenders, that
the way you eat shows how you were raised, and that is a thing to be
avoided at any cost. The main idea is to give the impression that
food means less than nothing to you, that you'd as soon go hungry as
not, and at the same time keep rolling it in. While I by no means
advocate anarchy at the table, I cannot agree with my cook book that
daintiness is the sum and substance of refined eating. Dainty is as
dainty does. But let's resolve, one and all, to become a little less
uncouth during the coming year. I'm going to try, if I have to feed
myself a bean at a time.</p>

SPINACH AND THE GOOD LIFE</h3>

<span class="smcap">persons of the dialogue<br>
isabel paterson,<br>
a hermit</span>

<p><span class="smcap">scene</span>: <i>Mrs. Paterson's salon in
Hell's Kitchen, New York City</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cuppy</i>. Is it true, O thou wise Diotima, that you are very
fond of spinach?</p>

<p><i>Paterson</i>. Of that, Socrates, you may be assured. But who
told you?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus.</p>

<p><i>Pat. I</i> thought perhaps it was Metrodorus of Lampsacus, or
Stesimbrotus of Thasos, or Burton Rascoe of Larchmont.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. The fact is, I knew it all the time.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You ought to.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Then pleasure is not the same as good fortune, or pain
the same as evil fortune, and therefore the good is not the same as
the pleasant?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Have it your own way.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. But is not the good also the beautiful?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Well, is it?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. And is not the State greater than the individual?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Some States. But you told me you wished to use George
Moore's "Conversations in Ebury Street" as a model for this
interview.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. So I did. Ah, here is Mabel with the tea.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Where?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Nowhere. But George Moore is always saying, "Ah, here
is Mabel with the tea."</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Who is this Mabel?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Now don't have one of your tantrums. I tell you there
is no Mabel. Ah, here is Mabel with the tea.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Perhaps you had better just speak English. Anyway,
George Moore does not discuss spinach.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. He discusses George Eliot!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. And, after all, you are not George Moore.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Don't be too sure of that.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Ho hum!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. May I bore you with some figures for a moment?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>, For a moment, yes.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. A learned mathematician has discovered that one-half
cupful of cooked <i>Spinacia oleracea</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. What?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You heard me, you ain't blind. One-half cupful of
cooked <i>Spinacia oleracea</i>, belonging to the natural order
<i>Chenopodiace&aelig;</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Do you call that English?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. &mdash;known to the Persians as <i>aspanakh</i> and to
the aborigines of Jones's Island as hay, or timothy&mdash;well,
one-half cupful, weighing four ounces, contains twenty-seven
calories. The usual one-hundred calorie portion, therefore, would
have to be two cupfuls, weighing one pound, and in order to obtain
his daily two thousand calories an adult living entirely upon
spinach, as you are said to do, would be forced to eat forty cupfuls,
weighing twenty pounds, or the rough equivalent of a fleet of moving
vans overloaded with the stuff.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Your facts, figures, premises and conclusions are open
to argument, but it could be done. I knew a man once who did it. What
a man!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You do take up with the darndest people.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You should be the last to remind me of that.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Where did my pencil go when I fell off the sofa just
then?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Here it is.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Please don't do that again.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You were about to advance the quaint view that spinach
is not nourishing. Nobody said it was.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. What is it, then?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It is edifying.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Prove it!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It is a thing you cannot prove statistically. I merely
ask you to consider this, whether or not spinach conduces to the
higher life and the general happiness. Its entertainment value is
very great. Spinach eaters are invariably people you would like to be
seen walking down Park Avenue with.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. But once you take up spinach, you have no time to walk
down Park Avenue. You must stay home and wash it.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Yes, unless you make a life work of it, you don't get
anywhere, but that is true of everything.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You said it. Would you mind telling me exactly how you
cope with spinach? Have you a system?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Indeed I have. There is only one right way. On some
subjects, such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, there may be legitimate
divergence of opinion, but not with spinach. In the Ideal State,
degenerate minds who do not follow my plan will be segregated or
banished.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I recall no such stringent proposals in Plato's
"Republic."</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. No, all those boys did was sit around and talk about
the good life, instead of eating their spinach.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Nor in Sir Thomas Browne's "Utopia."</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Doubtless you mean Sir Thomas More's "Utopia"?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I guess so&mdash;go ahead.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Well, then! On the principal spinach days you must get
up at five in the morning, otherwise you'll get nothing else done.
Proceed to the garden, if you have a spinach garden, as everybody
ought to have, and cut spinach for about two hours&mdash;that is, for
one person.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. How about the family?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. The rule is two hours for each. Of course, if you live
in New York, drive to the market in your largest town car, fill it
with spinach and bring it home.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Is that what you do?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Yes. And you must have a proper kitchen, with
tubs.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Spinach tubs?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. No, just tubs. Then take the spinach, a leaf at a
time, and look at it. Yes, each leaf; only that way lies safety.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. That way lies madness, I should say. Still, it does,
anyway, so why worry?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Throw away all the bad leaves, the roots and so
on&mdash;that will be about one-third discarded.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Do you cut off the stem?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. About half of it.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. They say there isn't so much iron in the stems,
anyway.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Bother the iron. People who want iron in their diet
should become sword swallowers and be done with it. Then throw the
remaining leaves into a tub of water.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Great heavens, weren't they in water all this
time?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. No, it is more agreeable to pick them over dry first.
Then lift them out of the tub into the sink, which has been scrubbed
for the purpose, and run more water over them, stirring vigorously to
get the sand out. Then put them back into the tub, put on more
water&mdash;<i>da capo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. How long does this go on, by and large?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. At least eight times, without stopping for meals.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Is it clean now?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Comparatively. As you know, perfection is hardly to be
hoped for.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I can see how life might be like that. The trouble is,
I should think you could hardly see the trees for the spinach.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Are you trying to be funny?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Try harder.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. It seems there were two Irishmen, Cup and Pat.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Then cram the spinach into your largest kettle, place
on the fire and pour boiling water over it, with a spoonful of salt.
I should have mentioned that any that falls on the floor must be
bathed again, unless you have stepped on it.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Do you step on much?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Not so much now. Remember that if you put the spinach
on in cold water it will heave up and all over the stove as it gets
hotter, a fact which has discouraged a lot of beginners. Boil for
twenty minutes, actual boiling time. Twenty-five minutes won't hurt,
but more is too much.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Lucrezia Borgia was very fond of spinach.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Do you know that for a fact, or did you just hear
it?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I know it for a fact.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Then lift it out of the pot with a fork&mdash;by
lifting instead of pouring, a few grains of sand will remain
behind&mdash;into a press colander, and press out all the water you
possibly can. Sloppy spinach is dreadful, it's the chief reason why
so many people hate spinach. It should not be minced or creamed or
anything of the kind. Put it in a warm dish with a little fresh
butter on top. Don't mix the butter in, and don't mess it
up&mdash;also some freshly ground pepper. Then eat it.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. At last!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. The anti-spinach propaganda is promulgated and kept
going simply by people who are too lazy to prepare it correctly. I
lay the present outbreak of lawlessness to the fact that not nearly
enough people follow the proper procedure. You can see for yourself
that if they did, they'd have no time left for any criminal
occupations.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Brillat-Savarin tells of a Canon Chevrier who would
never have spinach served up on Friday that had not been cooked the
Sunday before and put every day on the fire, with a new addition of
butter.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I am not surprised at anything that Canon Chevrier
might do.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Spinach can be made very attractive by molding it into
the shape of birds and animals and trimming it with a border of
candy-tuft and maidenhair fern. Would you object to that?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I consider it mere trifling, but I do not seriously
object.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. The advantage is that you can always eat the
border.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Ha! Ha!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. But surely you have other preferences in the way of
food?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Certainly. The ideal menu for the spinach eater begins
with a clam-juice cocktail, with the conventional olives and celery
as <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres,</i> followed by broiled brook trout and
guinea hen stuffed with truffles&mdash;unless you object?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. The sky's the limit.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Asparagus, green peas, potatoes souffl&eacute;d.
SPINACH. Watercress salad, strawberries and caramel ice cream.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Why not strawberry shortcake?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Of course, and coffee and apricot brandy. Champagne to
be served throughout the dinner.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Just what is the subtle affinity I have noticed
between spinach and champagne?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Both conduce to cheerfulness. The Burgundies and
clarets, the great wines, are admirable, certainly, but they tend to
solemnity. Specialists in them almost always become unduly serious.
In moderation, yes; but taken to excess&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. How about champagne to excess?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. That is impossible. In the first place, you can't get
it. Secondly, if you could, whatever you had would be just barely
enough. Ah, here is Edith with the tea.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. We cracked that joke before.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. But you see her now, don't you? Edith, please bring
some of the same. Two lumps?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Nothing in mine, thanks.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You don't care much for tea?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Not much, but this spinach is really delicious. Your
own make?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Yes, do have some more. I believe in time you will
become a true spinach eater.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. After all, why not? We live but once, if that. May I
have a third helping? Do you like being interviewed, Pat?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I love it, Jake.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. What is your favorite flower?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Pansies, lilacs, roses, nasturtiums and
mignonette.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. What do you think of New York?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. May I tell my readers, then, that you attribute your
success to spinach?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. What success?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">scene</span>: <i>A subway shuttle-train plying
between Times Square and the Grand Central Station, New York
City</i>.</p>

<p><i>Paterson</i>. But you've interviewed me about spinach once
already, don't you remember?</p>

<p><i>Cuppy</i>. Could I forget?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I wouldn't put it past you. But I've too much work on
hand to-day. I have to write "Turns With a Bookworm" and two articles
and a chapter of the novel and go to a party and deliver a lecture
and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Do you call that work?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Well, it cuts into the afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Then why go clear from Times Square to the Grand
Central after more spinach, when you have enough for nine people
right here in this enormous bag?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. They're having a sale. Shall I carry it?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. No, I can manage it nicely with your brief-case and
books and umbrella and parcels, by hanging this little one on my
ear.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Let me hang it on. There!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I heard many compliments on our first interview about
the capture, initiation ceremonies, compulsive bathing and secret
culinary rites pertaining to <i>Spinacia oleracea</i>, or
spinach.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Yes, it was in your best classic manner.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Nonsense! I mean the funny things you said in it.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. But you said all the funny things.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Oh, what a fib! I did not! I thought I gave you a
break.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Did you?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. This is gratitude, when I'm always telling you how
brilliant you are.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Oh, but I'm not. I'm only a plain, simple little
thing. You are the brilliant one. Why else do I have you around?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I had hoped&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I wish these people would quit stepping on me.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. What do you think of tripe?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I don't think of it.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I feel that I should give you my tripe recipe in
return for your spinach directions.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I'm in no state of mind just now to hear any
tripe.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. But it would go so well in the article.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. As for articles, I always say keep your mind on the
main subject and the tripe will take care of itself.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Take two heads of fresh, young tripe&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Two heads of tripe?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Two heads are better than one. Boil forty-eight hours,
add chlorate of lime and&mdash;Oh, well!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I warned you.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Would you care to discuss the economic aspects of
spinach?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. With pleasure. Some of our great American fortunes are
founded upon spinach.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Where can I get some?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. That man stepped on me again.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You have been heard to express the opinion that
spinach has its literary side.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It has hardly anything else. Great writers have always
known that, instinctively. Spinach and literary genius go hand in
hand, as it were.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Would you say that the spinach causes the genius, or
that the genius causes the spinach?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Genius is born, but it requires spinach and other
favorable conditions to bring it out. That is all one can say about
genius.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Put case a young person who develops acute
<i>caco&euml;thes scribendi</i>, or the uncontrollable itch to write
things down on paper and try to get them printed. Should he be fed
upon a diet of spinach? Would that make his productions less
horrible?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. If spinach won't help him, nothing can&mdash;it is the
will of Allah. In the Ideal State a skilled physician will first
determine whether the youth has true <i>caco&euml;thes scribendi</i>
or merely scarlatina. If it is only scarlatina he will be cured by
means of herbs and simples and turned into a useful member of society
as a husbandman, weaver, smith, neatherd, goatherd, shepherd,
bootlegger or judge.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. But if it is really <i>caco&euml;thes
scribendi</i>?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Spinach is indicated. One of the wisest of the elders
will then be appointed to read the youth's works and decide whether
to administer more spinach or some form of euthanasia, or painless
annihilation.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I suppose I ought to eat more spinach. If I did, do
you think I would be a better reviewer of detective stories?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Your problem would then work itself out in another
way.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You mean that I wouldn't review them at all?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Did I say so?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Detective stories serve a worthy purpose. They rest
the mind.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Sure they do, if you have that sort of mind.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You think detective authors should eat more
spinach?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. No, more strychnine.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Who are some of these great writers who eat spinach,
anyway?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Well, you seem to eat quite a bit of it, man and
boy.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Oh, I'm not bragging.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Robert Browning was a natural born spinach eater. He
got plenty. That accounts for his cheery, warbling note, his feeling
that God's in his heaven, all's right with the world, the snail's on
the thorn and all that.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Who's this&mdash;Eddie Guest?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. No&mdash;Robert Browning.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. For me, Browning represents the triumph of mind over
spinach, or vice versa. I also detect a trace of deadly nightshade in
his work.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Dante, on the other hand, never got enough, with
resultant depression and gloom. He really belongs, of course, but
circumstances were against him. The "Inferno" clearly shows the lack
of Vitamins A and B.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Vitamin A is also found in alfalfa and clover.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Young clover is delicious.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Dr. Johnson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Distinctly non-spinach.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Yet Boswell says that Dr.Johnson ate spinach once.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Dr. Johnson was exactly the kind of man who would eat
spinach once.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. He had soup, a boiled leg of lamb and spinach on April
11, 1773.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Mutton, probably. Carlyle, though, was the real
ringleader of the opposition, the head and front of the anti-spinach
party. This stubborn obsession of his made him utterly impossible to
live with and caused him to write in such a style that nobody to this
day has been able to read him and find out what it was all about. He
absolutely never ate spinach, and it would have done him no good if
he had.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You seem a little shy of positive examples of spinach
addiction in history.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. History, is it? The whole cause of the sudden
marvelous efflorescence of genius that took place in the great Tudor
days was simply that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon, who,
being Spanish, introduced salad and spinach into England. She had
always been used to green vegetables at home and insisted upon having
them at the English court, so they became fashionable. But she could
never get Henry to eat any spinach, and that's the reason he turned
out the way he did. Ultimately, of course, it broke up the
marriage.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. That's just another negative example. Bring on your
spinacharians.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You can read in any authority that Queen Elizabeth ate
practically nothing else.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. She was a distant relative of Henry's, wasn't she?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Only his daughter. That succory pottage that the
historians mention was spinach. They speak of her making a whole meal
of a manchet of bread and some succory pottage, that is to say,
spinach.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. What are your grounds for thinking that succory
pottage is spinach?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Why&mdash;everybody knows that!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You wouldn't mislead me about it, would you, Pat?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Gosh, no, Jake, you know I wouldn't. So it wasn't long
until the spinach habit had spread throughout the land, and you got
Shakespeare, Jonson, Marlowe and all the magnificent company of
Elizabethan dramatists, singers and what not.</p>

<p><i>Citp</i>. And the explorers?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I haven't completed my investigations yet, so I can't
say whether they left home in search of newer varieties of spinach
and better places to grow it, or in order to get away from it.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I'm surprised you'd admit that possibility.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as unregenerate
human nature, and you have to reckon with it. I have told my
secretaries to go ahead with the research as soon as I can get an
appropriation passed to pay their salaries, and if the argument goes
against me, well and good&mdash;but it won't.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I suppose that's why Henry VIII beheaded his eight
wives?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Only two, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Is that all?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You feel that beheading only two out of six is rather
a low average?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Well, yes, for a king, who could do as he pleased. I
had always regarded him as a sort of champion in that way.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You admire him, then?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Only as a thinker. He was the first to advance the
theory that woman's place is on the chopping block. Queen Elizabeth
was pretty mean about her sister, Mary Queen of Scots, wasn't
she?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. You mean her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Just how far do you think Queen Elizabeth went with
all those men?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I think her diet sufficiently refutes those ancient
slanders.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Do you care to enlarge upon Shakespeare's love of
spinach, with perhaps something in the way of evidence and a few
well-chosen quotations?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. That is a subject upon which one has no need to
enlarge. There are the plays! They speak for themselves.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Well, that brings the history of spinach up to 1515,
the date of Shakespeare's death.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It is not the generally received opinion that
Shakespeare died in 1515.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You mean he didn't?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. He didn't.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I may be dumb, but really, I do know that much. I once
put in three hard, grinding years of graduate study on the
Elizabethan period, the whole thing leading up to the one central,
outstanding fact that Shakespeare died in 1515. If I learned anything
whatever at college, it was that. Are you trying to insult my
intelligence?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Your what?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You can always remember dates if you associate them
with little jingles, such as</p>

<p class="poem">In fourteen hundred and ninety-three<br>
Columbus sailed the deep blue sea.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Shakespeare was born in 1564. He bought New Place at
Stratford in 1597 for sixty pounds. The Globe Theater was finished in
1599, Queen Elizabeth died in 1603 and the First Folio appeared in
1623, seven years after Shakespeare's death.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Well, that proves that Shakespeare died in 1616, just
as I've been trying to tell you.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Life is very hard at times. Will you <i>please</i>
quit stepping on me, Mister?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. That's not the same man. That's a couple of other
fellows.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Oh, I apologize! Go right ahead, boys.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Speaking of "Hamlet," how did you happen to take up
spinach, anyway?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It was when I was having difficulties with my first
novel.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. And since then everything has been jake?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Swell!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Am I right in feeling that there is veiled spinach
propaganda in your Elizabethan novel, "The Fourth Queen"?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Yes, of course. It's in the form of a cryptogram. I'm
leaving it for posterity to decipher.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Hell, I wish I was rich.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Why didn't you get a job?</p>

<p><i>Cup. Vissi d'arte, vissi d'amore</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. That does complicate matters.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. There's evolution to consider, too.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. What are you leading up to?</p>

<p><i>Cup. Eohippus</i>, the Dawn Horse. It seems likely that spinach
prevented stringhalt in <i>Eohippus, Orohippus</i> and
<i>Epihippus</i> in the Eocene, <i>Mesohippus</i> and
<i>Miohippus</i> in the Oligocene, <i>Parahippus, Protohippus</i> and
<i>Hypohippus</i> in the Miocene, <i>Pliohippus</i> in the&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. It is also good for morbid conditions of the cerebral
cortex in certain Primates, such as the Simiid&aelig;, or man-like
apes.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. You win. It seems terrible, though, that
<i>Eohippus</i>, the Dawn Horse, is extinct. The poor little thing
was only about the size of a cat. Its fore limbs had four functional
digits, the second to fifth, while the first was completely lost. The
hind legs were three-toed, the first and fifth being merely vestigial
remains&mdash;cute, eh? Do you think we came from monkeys?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. What do you mean, came?</p>

<p><i>Cup. I</i> hold that if birds came from reptiles, anything
might happen. Have you anything to say about the Mendelian bean?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Not for publication.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. We haven't mentioned Neanderthal Man.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I know him personally.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Do you believe in epigenesis in ontogeny?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. I suppose it's all right if one has nothing better to
do.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. That just about covers the subject of evolution. What
do you think of trilobites?</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. There seem to be millions of them in this
shuttle-train. What do they mean rushing about and fighting each
other this way? Ouch!</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. This is the rush hour. Maybe we'd better get off this
trip.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Do you mean to say you've let me sit here and ride
back and forth all afternoon in this subway?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I couldn't bear to interrupt you.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Come on, now! Step lively.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. My God, I've been robbed!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Whazzat?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Your brief-case! Your books! The parcel on my ear! All
gone!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. The bag of spinach?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Here it is, still clutched firmly in my arms, if we
ever get out of here alive.</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. My hero! You have saved my spinach! Please don't worry
for a single moment about that silly brief-case and the other
things&mdash;it was only some unfinished manuscripts and my bank book
and some stocks and bonds and my passport and my watch and a few old
family necklaces. I was tired of them, anyway.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. I'll get you some more necklaces.</p>

<p><i>Par</i>. You'll do no such thing.</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Angel! Watch your step!</p>

<p><i>Pat</i>. Whew! Where are we now?</p>

<p><i>Cup</i>. Times Square.</p>

<h3><a name="WATCH_YOUR_BUDGET" id="WATCH_YOUR_BUDGET"></a>WATCH YOUR
BUDGET</h3>

<p>It is a commonplace among thinking economists that a dollar bill
will go just so far and no farther at a given time and place, the
same law of Nature holding true for bills of other denominations,
such as $2 bills, $5 bills, and so on, and even truer for the more
familiar nickel, dime and quarter. This doubtless accounts, or let us
so assume, for the widespread use of budgets, which have been defined
as financial estimates, filled with characteristic dotted lines,
embodying plans for the ensuing year. Budgets were well known to the
ancients, and frequently have been found alongside the mummies in
Egyptian tombs.</p>

<p>Anyway, it may not come amiss&mdash;and this is what I'm driving
at&mdash;to relate my own budget experiences for those in the same
fix. Though based roughly upon such scientific factors as supply and
demand, entrepreneurs and unearned increment, my observations are not
put forth as strictly professional. There is nothing hidebound or
academic about them. All I intend is to offer a few hints to hermits,
hack writers and other morbid bachelors on how to sustain life or its
equivalent upon a very moderate income, if that&mdash;in a word, how
to become efficient without a chance in the world.</p>

<p>I made my first budget a year ago, without appreciable results.
Having read in a book that a budget is a machine guaranteed to
convert the raw material, or income, into whatever one desires to get
out of life, I constructed such a machine designed to get perhaps
more than can be got all of a sudden. I based my calculations too
trustfully upon the way things would be if they were the way they
ought to be. I included practically everything there is in life,
quite overlooking the catch in the whole business, to wit: the
income. The budget was a good one, as budgets go, but this one
weakness seriously undermined its practical value. Still, there was a
wild, untrammeled charm to that budget that I just loved.</p>

<p>Without unduly catering to a cowardly and pessimistic prudence,
and with the tacit understanding between it and me that something may
turn up this year, my new budget takes more account of actual
conditions in the here and now. It remains fluid or elastic,
existing, as it were, in a state of flux, subject to unexpected jumps
in income, invitations out, birthday presents, discovery of a gold
mine and possible adoption by a wealthy couple in search of a steady,
reliable, deserving and middle-aged hermit who will take care of his
own room and not expect much pin money. Let us now examine it
briefly.</p>

<p>Taking up the various budget divisions in the regular order of
food, shelter, clothing, operating costs and advancement, we are
faced at the outset with the old bogey of starvation, which it is
always to a book reviewer's advantage to hold off as long as possible
while hoping against hope that some one may discover potential genius
in his paragraph on the back pages of literary journals and do
something. Although a certain amount of suffering is said to be just
fine for the spiritual development of writers, the harried book
reviewer is inclined to draw the line at hunger pains. He feels that
in justice to his editor he must eat. But how?</p>

<p>Well, supposing that the hypothetical hermit has saved up $10 for
the purchase of food, he will find the daily budget an excellent
contrivance for helping him spend it. The following memorandum is
recommended for marketing of this nature: One ham (the same ham that
he has wanted for years), probably about $5; fresh green vegetables
for vitamins, about $1; whole wheat flour for mineral salts,
somewhere around $0.25; package pancake flour, maybe $0.50; coffee
for inspiration, $0.50; carton Luckies for ditto, $1.35 or some such
price; twelve chocolate almond bars, large size, $1.20; two cans
honey, about $1 or less; miscellaneous, $1. Tucking this list inside
his seven sweaters, he sets out blithely for shore in the teeth of a
threatening snowstorm.</p>

<p>It may be noted that this budget foots up to $12.95, instead of
$10. It turns out not to matter, since one finds that one owes the
grocer $8.15, anyway, leaving a total of $1.85 for current supplies.
There goes the ham again. Hurriedly tearing up the budget, the
hermit's next move is to return to Jones's Island in a raging
blizzard with a soaking wet bundle containing one pack smokes, $0.15;
one tube tooth paste, $0.45; stamps, $0.50; one almond bar, $0.10,
and potatoes (very filling), $0.55. This leaves a surplus of $0.10
and incipient pneumonia.</p>

<p>I have outlined an extreme case, which need discourage no
determined hermit. The fact is, if he can find some way to get ashore
and back, and if he possesses sufficient powers of persuasion, he can
always charge his groceries, a nice basket of which can be obtained
in this way for from $5 to $10, depending upon the size of the basket
and the price of the foods. So why worry about this phase of the
problem? The grocery lady will soon be back at Jones's Island and the
summer colonists will be along eventually and Rattlesnake Ned has a
good idea about making vitamins out of eel grass and seaweed. And for
that matter, the Coast Guards would never see me starve.</p>

<p>I find that it does not pay to burden my mind with the actual cost
of the various items of diet&mdash;surely life has enough interests
without that. But it is probable that the typical hermit's meal would
go something like this: Clams, $0.00; corn muffins, $0.02; butter,
$0.01; coffee, $0.01; water, $0.00; laundry, $0.00; breakage, $0.00;
one can corn, presented by E. R. Tappen, $0.00; one can sardines
kindly sent by Franklyn Fisher, $0.00; overhead, $0.00; one onion,
forget it. Total, $0.04. I think I shall be able to cut my food
expenses still lower if I can learn to live on soy beans. Of course,
when I entertain I am as likely as not to break out a jar of figs in
syrup or a can of shrimp, but as a rule I try to keep my Blue Plate
dinners within reason, say about $0.09. Only last week, however, I
gave a party that ran well into two figures.</p>

<p>Shelter and operating costs for the family of one may be grouped
together. As I own my own country estate, I suppose I get shelter
free&mdash;at least, that is my understanding of the arrangement.
Upkeep on my house and outbuilding has probably amounted to $3.30,
but that isn't much for seven or eight years. Under operation this
year I lay out to get two ten-gallon cans of kerosene for
illumination, a ton of coal for next winter, a new mosquito-netting
canopy for my bed, a large bottle of citronella for the guest chamber
and a set of washers for the pump. I must also see if Mrs. Prodgers
can spare another lamp, as mine smokes, leaks and has dizzy spells.
All in all, exclusive of the coal, which will doubtless disappear
from the budget when the time comes, operating costs should come to
about $4.35. As for coal, there is much to be said for the popular
feeling that hermits were intended to burn driftwood. The
circumstance that, by some hideous freak of fate, there isn't any on
Jones's Island in the winter explains why one hermit talks to
himself.</p>

<p>Clothes, of course, one can't get away from. The weather being
what it is, and it is certainly all of that, we of Great South Bay
require a lot of good durable clothes; though, truth to tell, the
changing fashions do not disturb us at all. Why should we be slaves
to some dim arbiter in Paris, who couldn't tell a stiff gale from a
cyclone? What do they know in Paris of the needs of High Hill Beach,
Goose Crick and Crow Island? The hermit will do well to leave to the
very last his pink pajamas, silk socks and suchlike, including first
in his budget the best obtainable grade of hip boots, oilskins,
flannel shirts and woolen breeches&mdash;that's where the money goes.
And if the Rue de la Paix objects, he can tell the rue to lump
it.</p>

<p>During the long winter evenings at Jones's the Coast Guards and I
are wont to admire, without precisely aspiring to the elegant
costumes in the ads. Soup and fish, patent leathers&mdash;they are
hardly for us, but there's no harm in looking. We mostly have enough
clothes already, what with the large and varied assortment on the
station hooks, for these are a common possession to be used by the
first comer, like the station harmonium. We really solve this problem
at a minimum expense by wearing each other's clothes. It's a wise
beachite who knows his own pants.</p>

<p>Occasionally I add to the general wardrobe some items of apparel
which I keep in mothproof bags in my spare room on the theory that if
things get much worse I may be glad to wear them out in company. As
the rest do the same, we are always becomingly, if not gaudily,
arrayed. This year I do plan to have a new bathing suit, but you
never can tell. A bathing suit will always last one season more, if
you bathe away up the beach where chance spectators are likely to be
in the same predicament. In this way the hermit not infrequently gets
the full effect of the ultra-violet rays where they will do the most
good. A couple of dollars, then, for beach clothes, and a plentiful
supply of socks will come to about a dollar more.</p>

<p>But what of the hermit who goes occasionally to New York, where
men are fashion plates? What about Sunday clothes? How is he to
compete with the Coast Guards, beside whom, when they go ashore, the
lilies of the field may be said to be practically nowhere? As Bill
Williams may need his overcoat ere I return and Slim may miss his
shoes, it comes down to maintaining a more or less stylish outfit of
my own. My budget policy, here as elsewhere, is to let it
ride&mdash;in short, wait and see what may happen.</p>

<p>My next town suit, for instance, depends upon what Chase Horton,
the celebrated <i>bon vivant</i> of Greenwich Village, is going to do
about the brown tweed which he refused to sell me last year.
Discovering that I wanted the suit, he took a sudden liking to it,
and as he has worn it almost continuously since then&mdash;though he
has eleven other suits&mdash;it is hardly likely that he would have
the nerve to charge much for it at this late day. And right here
arises the possibility that in some future, fairer age persons of
quality and the well-to-do classes in general will give literary
hermits a thought before they go tossing suit after suit out the
window just because they (the suits) are a little bit thin in the
seat. I must say for Chase that he has always been most reasonable
about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Next comes the important matter of advancement; under this heading
may be grouped, in various pleasing arrangements, such items as
vacation, travel at home and abroad, amusements, college for the
kiddies, gifts to church and charities, insurance, savings,
investments and yachts. Here also belong books, magazines, lectures,
cut flowers, illness, postage stamps, napery and Chautauqua courses.
It is from no wish to remain coarse and brutal that I manage to save
quite a tidy sum on these folderols. The forward-looking budgeteer
can always cut out the advancement. Nobody can force you to be
refined if you can't afford it.</p>

<p>Now in re doctors. Since this is neither the time nor the place to
dwell upon my bodily ailments, suffice it that I am at some pains to
preserve such limbs and faculties as have been spared to me and that
this must be a considerable strain upon somebody. By a happy
coincidence my physician in chief, who has given lavishly of his
time, luncheons, spare rooms and dinners to assure me that my
diseases are all in my head, seems to be far above all sordid,
mercenary motives. Little does Dr. Raggi suspect that I intend to
discharge my heavy obligation by mentioning him prominently in my
will.</p>

<p>Dentists come a little higher. Mine has already done for me about
all that his branch of learning has thought up since the invention of
the original hydraulic gimlet, and $30 will nicely cover all that I
owe him at the moment. Dr. Steeves has opened vistas I hardly dreamed
of and has given me plain and fancy feelings compared to which being
in love is a positive pleasure. All this costs money, at least on
paper, and it would be well for the hermit to add the round sum of
$30 to his list as a permanent fixture. And about $5 for running
amuck in drug stores. It is fortunate that persons obsessed with an
ungovernable passion for practically everything they see in drug
stores&mdash;and most hermits must confess to this
peculiarity&mdash;are automatically protected from total ruin by the
fact that drug stores demand spot cash.</p>

<p>We live in an age of travel, so one must spare something for this
broadening influence. It costs me anywhere from $0.99 to $1.14 every
time my soul succumbs to wanderlust and nostalgia for the far places,
this being the fare to the Penn Station from my various points of
embarkation, once I get ashore. Then there are the nickels for the
subway. Hermits loose in Manhattan use more of these than the
natives, since they are likely to drop another one in the dujingus
when they exit, from sheer inability in the excitement to know
whether they are going or coming. Speaking of uplift, I shouldn't
mind owning a second-hand copy of the encyclop&aelig;dia, either.
It's an awful strain having to make up my own learned references
about all kinds of science as I go along, and sooner or later it's
going to get me fired from something. I should also like the
moon.</p>

<p>I thought of starting a bank account, but I am informed by the
hermit of Crow's Island that this is easier said than done. He says
that once you do get $17 over and above urgent current expenses, and
take it to a bank, they mumble something about a deposit of $200 and
wink at each other right before your eyes. Ned may have confused the
checking and savings departments in some way, but there's a good deal
of fundamental truth in his argument. As a principle, the family of
one should probably concentrate on the institution of borrowing,
which offers a shorter cut to advancement than savings do. Moreover,
the saving type is not in the best odor out here. The fellow who
doesn't spend his check before he gets it is bad pay, and that does
no one's reputation any good. We prefer to treat our money as though
we really owned it. If we want to shoot a dime for a chocolate almond
bar, we shoot it and reck not of the future. If we couldn't do that,
we'd as soon be in jail.</p>

<p>I wish I could do more for charities. I should like to give
liberally to Chinese missions, the Anti-Noise movement, the Society
for Being Kind to Hermits and many other worthy causes, and make some
very good looking people independent for life. For the present I have
to curb this side of my nature at every turn. Yet I do what I can. I
have for some years made it a practice, whenever occasion offers, to
smile at old crossing sweepers, assist crippled beggars through the
traffic, force my attentions upon apple and gum sellers and be as
nice as pie to shabby and forbidding ancients who look as though they
might own apartment buildings and be searching for a beneficiary of
their vast wealth. If that is not striving for advancement, what is
it?</p>

<p>In closing, let me advise the family of one not to take its
expense account too seriously. When you are making out a budget,
don't include everything you absolutely need, but on the other hand,
don't skimp yourself too much. Do the thing right. I find it an
excellent plan to do one's budgeting weekly instead of yearly, and as
I am just starting ashore for a while, I append a sample budget
hastily contrived to cover the next seven days:</p>

<p>It will be observed that the element of chance must be allowed for
in the above estimate. Indeed, nothing short of some gigantic
upheaval of nature or a total change in the financial system, or
both, can help me come out even this week. And what of that, when you
come right down to it? I sometimes think that wishing is an end in
itself. As for cold, hard facts, it may be that whatever you want in
this world, ten to one you won't get it; but, Lord love you, that
needn't stop a body from making a budget.</p>

<h3><a name="SIMPLIFIED_CLAMS" id="SIMPLIFIED_CLAMS"></a>SIMPLIFIED
CLAMS</h3>

<p>Perhaps no single component of our modern, highly advanced
civilization [laughter] is so little understood by the layman and
laywoman as the common, or soft clam <i>(Mya arenaria</i>), unless
it's the hard clam, or Freud. Some authorities attribute this to the
gradual movement of all intelligent persons towards New York City
after the Repeal of the Corn Laws; others blame the widespread loss
of respect for custom and tradition following the introduction of
gin. Both sides would benefit a lot by taking a teaspoonful of
thyroid three times a day&mdash;there's nothing like it for that
touch of cretinism.</p>

<p>I lay the whole thing to a conspiracy of silence, a policy of
suppression which has kept the boys and girls of to-day in almost
complete ignorance of the facts, and scared Nature authors into
writing about the birds, the flowers and how pretty the sunset is,
whether it is or not. Essayists who wish to reveal the true state of
affairs find themselves balked at the start, for Roget's Thesaurus is
pathetically vague on the subject; and as for "How to Sell
Manuscripts"! The real lowdown on clams is jealously guarded by the
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, which is owned by people who do not
have to write about clams. At their death the complete set and the
case it came in passes by due process of law to still other persons
who don't know what it is to miss a meal. Gawd, it's tough!</p>

<p>Indeed, what have we about clams in all literature&mdash;what have
we that will live, I mean&mdash;excepting several sporadic studies of
the love life of this species by writers with few if any scruples,
who have stressed the erotic at the expense of the more serious
aspects, if there are any? Many of my readers will immediately think
of Fr-nk S-ll-v-n and R-b-rt B-nchl-y&mdash;and I may state that
neither of these gentlemen invented the clam. And what have they
discovered, beyond the elementary fact that clams have a fully
developed philoprogenitive tendency, to put it that way, or, to come
right out with it, a grasp of fundamentals surpassed only by some of
the mammalian bipeds, such as business men, politicians and any one
else with the time and money? I wish, however, to express my
indebtedness to Mr. S-ll-v-n's valuable monograph on a Long Beach
clam named Elsie; without it I should never have met Elsie's sister
Agnes, now my next-door neighbor at Jones's Island.</p>

<p>He jests at clams who never&mdash;who never&mdash; At any rate, it
is well to remember, before sneering at any of the <i>Mollusca</i>,
that they are older citizens of our planet than some of the land
animals that pretend to be so much. Scholars tell us that they had a
complete culture and a really wonderful civilization of their own
millions of years (262 millions, to be exact) before you and I were
ever heard of, or maybe I am thinking of the Chinese. In the hunting
field, where success so often depends upon a superior quality of
cerebral neurons, a fairly clever soft clam is often more than a
match for an athletic hermit. The pity of it is that he has a
one-track mind and knows but a single direction&mdash;straight
down&mdash;a peculiarity which has led certain of our biologists to
advocate crossing him with the rabbit. If this can be done, I believe
that a new day will dawn for the clams. We'll have them chasing the
hermits instead of the other way round. And that will be news.</p>

<p>I saw in the paper that the young, or larval, clams rotate
spirally as they move through the water, reminding one of a flock of
young lambs frisking merrily about the dam. That is to say they do
not actually remind one of young lambs, since lambs do not really
rotate spirally, but lambs might easily give that impression,
especially if one were rotating spirally oneself at the time; the
point is hardly worth fighting about, as you can't see the larval
clams, anyway&mdash;they are only one four-hundredth of an inch long.
I simply mean to indicate that there is something essentially playful
and appealing in a larval clam for which it seldom gets credit.</p>

<p>Note what life does to these happy, carefree creatures. After
rotating for a few brief days, with no very tangible results, they
sink to the bottom and glue themselves to old shells or what not,
seldom moving from their chosen anchorage; when they attain the
length of one-half inch they dig farther down into the mud and
<i>never rise to the surface again!</i> They're through. I wonder
whether this is the clam's natural and inescapable destiny, or
whether it is the result of false conventions, of dogmas enforced
upon the young of the species by venal leaders for their own
sufficient reasons. Whichever it is, it shows an unfortunate
hypertrophy of the herd instinct&mdash;the sheep motif again. It
seems not improbable that sheep, as we know them to-day, are direct
descendants of the clam. The bivalves also display a curious likeness
to the ostrich, which similarly buries its head in the sand
(ostriches do not do this, but so many people think so that it seems
a shame to deny it&mdash;besides, I shouldn't be surprised if they
really do, there's so much talk). On the other hand, fossil clams
have been found many miles from the nearest fossil water, so they
probably get around more than we imagine.</p>

<p>The psychology of the clam is still in its infancy. Hard clam fans
find a decided kick in the somewhat aggressive, masterful nature of
the quahog, as opposed to the gentler, rather whimsical personality
of the humble softie. I have never known either kind to attack a
human without due provocation, and even then fear, rather than pure
meanness or the desire to make an extra nickel, was the ruling
factor. The incurably vicious clam is in the vast minority. As for
further research into the soul secrets of this interesting animal, I
favor applying the behavioristic system of Dr. John B. Watson, in the
firm belief that some sense might come of it.</p>

<p>People often ask me if I keep any clams as pets. No, I do not. I
have never kept even a fish. Having been born and brought up inland,
I seem not to have acquired the usual infantile fixations upon fish.
They seldom stir me. As companions fish can be awfully tiresome after
the first few sessions, and they have never struck me as nearly so
lovable as some of the other vertebrates. Their complete lack of
response finally wounds one's vanity past bearing, and all bets are
off, if you want to save the last remnants of your self-respect.
Clams are even worse. Platonic is no name for their utterly blah
indifference, their self-sufficiency and conceit. Who do they think
they are?</p>

<p>Besides, the clam's span of life is so short that if you did
become deeply attached to one you'd suffer something fierce. Your
existence would be just one clam after another, which, for some
people, might be pretty thrilling&mdash;but you have to be the type.
Such affairs seldom come to light, as the appearance of the clam is
all against it for anything approaching intimate relations. For what
becomes of high romance when you can't tell whether the small exposed
portion of the other party is its foot or its face? I pause for a
reply.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="BEDROOMS_ARE_WHAT_YOU_MAKE_THEM" id=
"BEDROOMS_ARE_WHAT_YOU_MAKE_THEM"></a>BEDROOMS ARE WHAT YOU MAKE
THEM</h3>

<p>It is really surprising what may be done in the home with a small
can of paint, if you aren't careful. A little paint is all that is
needed when the average hermit gets to feeling that he can no longer
cope with the mosquitoes and the rejection slips and stark realism in
general. At least so the experts say, and you know what elegant
results have been obtained by color lately in the treatment of the
more complicated neuroses and psychoses, such as most of us probably
have. I heard of a case where a single quart of common barn paint
cured a Middle Western hermit-author of delusions of dialect,
toothache and bad grammar in one application. After the second coat
he quit mumbling to himself, turned cheerful as anything and stopped
trying to think up homely and horrible people to write about.</p>

<p>In other words, I'm going to paint my bedroom. The recent official
investigation of conditions in my shack by myself and the Zachs Inlet
crew convinced us, as it would doubtless convince any fair-minded
jury, that the main trouble lay in the color scheme. This bit of
reform should come as good news to the summer resorters of High Hill
Beach, who sometimes pass my bedroom windows on their way to gather
mythical cranberries in the uncharted marshes back of my bungalow. I
caught a bevy of these ladies peering into my sleeping quarters one
morning, as I played dead under the blanket, and heard one of them
say that the place ought to be advertised as one of the plague spots
of Long Island.</p>

<p>I wish I'd been up to answer that woman, but I'm always just
getting to sleep when the slummers see fit to visit my part of the
island, or, for that matter, when anything else of interest or
importance happens. Since my bedroom is an open book, having two
windows abutting on what might be called the main thoroughfare to the
swamp, it offers a tempting mark to the general public during July
and August. As a summer menagerie I may consider myself a great
success, and I suppose I am lucky that nobody has yet chopped off an
ear or a toe as a souvenir. I have nothing much to conceal, but if
this goes on much longer I swear I'll get window shades for my
bedroom.</p>

<p>I must admit that the view of the interior from the windows is
slightly distressing. The foreground appears a trifle huddled, but
that will be all right as soon as I can do something about the
dismantled spare bed, the parts of a porch swing, the steamer chair,
that old trunk and the canned goods that I have to keep in this room
in addition to my own bed, bureau, table and clothing. Besides, it
will look entirely different when I get the rug. In time I hope to
have a chastely Hepplewhite bedroom, but just now, as that lady
rather cruelly went on to giggle, it shows the marked influence of
Attila, the Scourge of God. She must be right. Even Rattlesnake Ned
says that my boudoir reminds him irresistibly of the Death House at
Sing Sing. You may well wonder how, in the midst of such a shambles,
with its clutter of unfortunate furniture and its air of chaos come
again, I have managed to insinuate a modicum of that modest and
unpretentious charm which is always to be met with in the bedroom of
the man who knows. Well, maybe I haven't.</p>

<p>The trouble is that the color of the walls and
ceiling&mdash;identified by an artistic visitor as one of the more
trying shades of dying prune&mdash;invariably induces in all but the
most callous constitutions acute symptoms of eighteenth century
spleen, contemporary vapors and sometimes the Jones's Island horrors,
or slight manic-depressive seizures attended by vertigo. In the one
spot where I should be able to relax, forget the facts and sink into
restful, dreamless slumber, all I can do is lie awake, staring
bitterly into the blackness of an all too certain future, shuddering
with thoughts of the inevitable Judgment Day and wondering what evil
genius with a kink in his brain produced that particularly hideous
hue, that dire insult to the ruddier side of the spectrum which it is
my ambition to eradicate from off the face of the earth or perish in
the attempt. It came with the house.</p>

<p>The color is one of those rare accomplishments in art which
produce their own proof of malicious intent. Yet it seems impossible
that one lone criminal, guided by a libido however sadistic, could
have turned the trick without calling in outside help; so maybe it
was a gang. Still, Jones's being Jones's, I should not be surprised
if the whole thing was simply the result of a former owner's mixing a
gallon of pigmentary odds and ends found in the tool chest with
another gallon of something else discovered under the porch. If so,
my bedroom is a brilliant example of the Early&mdash;and
Late&mdash;Zachs Inlet school of thought, the object of which is not
so much to chase the nuance as to get it over with as soon as you can
and start smearing up something else so that it's own mother wouldn't
know it.</p>

<p>I am none too familiar with any of the colors, excepting red, blue
and green, and this one has me licked. I spoke of dying prune, but
that's too good for it. Decayed raspberry is also fulsome flattery.
Is it a particularly vicious petunia? A disillusioned magenta?
Perhaps it would be more charitable to name it a baffled mulberry, or
to think of it as a not quite bright verbena. All of these together
may serve to impress upon a few attuned and sympathetic intelligences
some vague notion of what I have suffered. I try to be fair, but I
have reached the conclusion, after mature deliberation, long
continued self-communion in the watches of the night and several
cat-fits in the morning, that this color is what caused the Fall of
Rome. In that bedroom Pollyanna herself would begin crossing
bridges.</p>

<p>I haven't picked the new color yet. Some pretty deep research in
the literature of the subject has left me just that much older. One
book strongly advises a combination of ivory, yellow, green and
violet; another holds out for gray and periwinkle blue; a third for
lavender, robin's egg and peach. None of these seems exactly right.
Orchid is out on the principle&mdash;well, on any principle. The same
is true of shrimp. There is a place for shrimp, and it is not in the
bedroom. Nor should I care to hold myself accountable in a mauve
bedroom stippled with turquoise on a ground of salmon. I knew a
hermit once who used that color scheme, and only the other day I
heard they had put him away.</p>

<p>A man's bedroom should be masterful without looking
aggressive&mdash;bold, if you will, and full of personality, but not
noticeably fresh. The ideal paint should appear to compromise with
life's little ironies, yet possess a mind of its own&mdash;something
suggesting <i>dolce far niente</i>, with nevertheless a sort of
seeming accidental note of <i>Carpe diem</i>. So why not red&mdash;a
good, honest red? I love red, and I understand that a timid,
supersensitive nature can often develop courage, poise and worldly
success by wallowing in it. Still, my favorite color is blue, and
that would be nice, too. Even so, it's got to be red, for I see that
red is a warm, advancing color, while blue is cold and retreating.
I'd rather have blue, but I'll not have it said, hermit or no hermit,
that my bedroom is cold and retreating. I'll paint some other room
blue.</p>

<p>All the rest of the room needs is an overhauling and a few
operations. Take my bed. When I rescued it from a pile of abandoned
household effects in the hills, it wasn't much to look at. Rusty,
rheumatic, totally unattractive as it was, I recognized some bond
between us and took it home. Painted a tasteful pink, it is now the
envy of all visitors who have to sleep on the floor and the despair
of every decorator who has seen it. Once junk, it may now be said to
have succeeded in life. You would think twice before you threw it out
or gave it to your sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Having always regarded the French Empire style as suitable for
bachelors, it was my intention to build around this bed something
swell in that line. Obviously of the Coolidge period, however, it
stubbornly resisted my every effort to make it or anything else in
the same room look Napoleonic. You can't carve pineapples,
cornucopias and bees on a castiron bedstead, so I had to be satisfied
with draping my mosquito netting over it in rather an Empress
Josephine manner. If I can ever get any one to embroider the imperial
"C" all over the netting, I shall have something not unimpressive in
the way of a bunk.</p>

<p>So pretentious a bed is at its best on a dais, but I don't know.
There is something about a dais that just naturally puts the beholder
in his place, but out here at Jones's it might be thought a trifle
affected. For the present the bed must stand on its own three legs
and the bricks, and I'd rather have a new mattress, anyway. "But why
do you put sawdust on the floor?" people often ask me. I don't; it's
the mattress. That's also the answer to the question, "Why do I get
up with lumbago, double neuritis and internal injuries?" Really, my
mattress is only fit for a guest room. Or maybe it's the springs.
They looked fine when I found them under a summer bungalow. They
proved to be the kind you have to live with before you discover their
real nature. I often become discouraged when I think of the postures
into which I am gouged by these springs in my efforts to snatch some
sleep. In order to go on I concentrate on the tricks done by Hindu
fakirs, such as standing on one leg for ninety years. If they can do
it, I say to myself, so can I. Let us all, fellow hermits, try to
look at life in this manner. On the other hand, let's make heroic
efforts to get some new springs and mattresses.</p>

<p>To end on a cheerful note, it will soon be time to get out the old
feather bed. That will help a lot. I know that some authorities call
feather beds unhygienic. Well, they keep you from getting struck by
lightning! Is that hygienic, or isn't it?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="CONSIDER_THE_LETTUCE" id=
"CONSIDER_THE_LETTUCE"></a>CONSIDER THE LETTUCE</h3>

<p>First catch your lettuce (from the Greek <i>Lettuce</i>, meaning
lettuce). There, in simple, untechnical language, is the garnered
wisdom of the ages about salad&mdash;and for once I agree with it. To
manufacture salad that is really salad with a mission and not just
something <i>pour passer le temps,</i> first catch your lettuce. I
suppose every one will admit that.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I suppose no such thing. I know only too well
that there exists to-day a growing and influential body of public
opinion upholding the notion that a ring of canned pineapple with a
ball of Grade A putty in the hole and a small American flag stuck in
the putty is an honest to God salad. Patriot as I am, whenever I meet
this particular tidbit out in company I feel impelled to ask: Whither
are we drifting? Have we lost all sense of moral obligation and
responsibility, all trace of Old World courtesy, all connection with
Early Victorian values in our mad scramble after the almighty dollar?
Are we, in short, reverting to a state of primitive savagery, in
which the passions are finally to overpower what little intelligence
we have left? I could ask a lot more of these, but what's the
use?</p>

<p>What I say is, even if the pineapple and putty item were trimmed
with George Washington in fireworks, it would still not be salad. It
might be wonderful in its way, but not salad. Never one for
half-measures, I advise that when and wherever this atrocity is met
up with it be instantly hurled straight at the shirtfront of Higgs
the butler. It would be a lesson.</p>

<p>Naturally, my readers will demand proof of my theory that all
salad should contain lettuce; the day has gone by when a domestic
scientist could write just anything foolish that came into his head
and expect to get away with it. Well, I started to work it out
mathematically, but you know how that goes, with all one's housework
to do. Suffice it to say for the present that several statistics have
already been obtained and that the net results will be announced in
due time; and you may rest assured they will be in favor of
lettuce.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I beg everybody to keep cool and act accordingly. Above
all, refuse to be stampeded by the jeers of a few flippant,
wise-cracking sophisticates who will tell you that lettuce is rabbit
food. This argument, all the more fiendish in that rabbits are said
to possess the smallest mammalian brains in captivity, will not hold
water for a moment&mdash;because it isn't so. In a state of nature,
if there is such a thing, rabbits never touch lettuce, subsisting
entirely upon roots, berries and the products of the chase. And
supposing they did, there are worse things than rabbits. Rabbits are
among the few remaining vertebrates which neither bark, sing,
whistle, play the piano, lecture nor invent new machines to make more
of the same or other loud noises. They should be encouraged.</p>

<p>At any rate, the younger hostesses of to-day are not doing right
by lettuce. They seem to take a wicked, irreligious delight in
banishing it from their menus, a procedure which may be attributed in
part to a widespread loss of respect for the older Vegetables, in
part to a dangerous enthusiasm for the new and untried, and in part
to certain obscure pathological conditions of the <i>medulla
oblongata</i>, or posterior brain. A radish rose, a celery curl, a
deviled bean or a fluted cucumber, and they think they have satisfied
the conventions. It remains, nevertheless, a self-evident truth that
no amount of dicing, cubing, shredding, fluting, hemstitching,
jig-sawing and brow-beating the vital vegetables can make up for the
lack of the one ingredient without which a salad is only a pathetic
bunch of left-overs, a jumble of odds and ends. Where, I ask you, is
the melodic line? In the mayonnaise? No, too often mayonnaise but
covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>As for fluting one's cucumbers, that may be well enough, if one
has nothing else to do, but it can easily become a menace. At best it
offers an occupational novelty to those jaded housewives who have
spent years of their lives rubbing two severed portions of a cucumber
together in the fond belief that thereby they are extracting a deadly
poison and saving the whole family. Me, I omit cucumbers altogether.
They cramp my style.</p>

<p>I really think that if things go on this way we're in for a wave
of rickets, if not beri-beri. Lettuce is anti-scorbutic, too. I can't
stop you if you've made up your mind to be scorbutic, but remember I
warned you; the novelty soon wears off and you'll wish you'd never
heard of it. It is no secret that lettuce cures rickets, though it
may not be common knowledge that it also strengthens the pituitary
gland, tones up the cerebral lobes and does wonders for the <i>os
innominatum</i>, or am I thinking of ultraviolet rays? Moreover, the
courtesans of Alexandria used external applications of lettuce for
softening and whitening the skin, considering it much better for this
sinister purpose than turnip-tops, eggplant, vegetable marrows or
Swiss chard.</p>

<p>Up to a point I understand and sympathize with those who refuse to
take advice, especially from food experts. What so robs existence of
its romantic glamour, nay, of self-respect? Time was when I, too,
scorned lettuce because it was healthful. Conformity seemed like
giving over all my youthful dreams of rum, riot and rebellion, open
sedition and piracy on the high seas. Now I'm more orthodox, whether
from some subtle stirring of the instinct of self-preservation, the
wisdom and tolerance of advancing years, or both, who knows? Perhaps
it was the spiritual side of lettuce that won me. Eating my lettuce
gives me the distinct impression that though my past may not have
been spotless, though I made mistakes, though I sowed false steps and
bankruptcy and blasted hopes and stomach-aches as thick as summer
flies, yet am I not all bad. I feel virtuous. I feel that sooner or
later I may succeed in life, that after all something may turn up,
and if not, there's always the county. If a feeling like that isn't
worth fifteen cents, what is?</p>

<p>There are drawbacks to lettuce, too, but hermits are seldom
exposed to the most insidious and horrible of them all, a form of
vegetable mania known as lettuce fondling. It is seldom possible to
obtain enough lettuce for this purpose at Jones's Island. In the
warmer months the grocery store at High Hill Beach carries lettuce,
but try and get it before the women folks have been there. For one
reason or another, chiefly the latter, it is necessary for hermits to
sublimate their desire for lettuce, so that the affliction mentioned
remains, if at all, in a latent or incipient stage. Ashore, the
seeing eye can pick out many a bachelor lettuce fondler, but let's
not be too harsh with them; let's remember that even Balzac
confessed, in his famous letter to the Duchesse d'Abrantes that he
felt within himself the capacity to become one of the worst.</p>

<p>It seems likely, on the whole, that this type of person will soon
be a thing of the past. Throughout the age of Victoria&mdash;and
sporadically since then&mdash;he devoted the major portion of his
spare time to mixing salad dressings, often in plain view of the
public, his face illumined the while with a secret and sinful
smile&mdash;and Freud has taught us the meaning of <i>that!</i> One
of the prominent remaining specimens is Dear Old Charlie in Eugene
O'Neill's "Strange Interlude," and to my mind the most significant
moment in the play was when the leading lady told Dear Old Charlie to
come behind the scenes and mix his favorite salad dressing. You
should have seen him go. I am not at liberty to reveal the complete
recipe, but the first thing Dear Old Charlie did after he was behind
the scenes was to rub his left ear with a clove of garlic handed to
him by the leading lady with fire-tongs. And from then on!</p>

<p>The cleaning and care of lettuce is a legitimate household
activity, not to be confused with compulsive fondling. Most experts
wash each leaf separately, rubbing briskly with a calico lettuce
cloth at right angles to the wrinkles; some probably use vanishing
cream and an astringent composed of equal parts benzoin and creosote.
I just hold the lettuce under the pump to remove the larger and more
vicious microbes, the main trouble with that being that my well water
is full of much larger and more horrible things. From the splinters,
animalcul&aelig;, fossil remains and unidentified souvenirs that come
out of my pump, it seems likely that the pipe connects with an
abandoned sawdust mine, or perhaps with a kitchen midden of the
Jones's Island aborigines (Pottawatomies). We can't have
everything.</p>

<p>The next two steps are draining and drying the lettuce. Hermits
have no lettuce drainers, so they squeeze it gently or brandish it
vigorously to and fro, an act involving quite a bit of dampness for
all concerned. Dry with an embroidered lettuce rag if you are that
sort, then place in a knitted lettuce bag before sending to cold
storage. It is a source of regret to me that I have no knitted
lettuce bag; it would be so wonderful for clothespins. As things are,
my clothespins are thought to be out under the clothesline, but when
I go after them, they turn out to be those wooden parcel handles.
What becomes of all the clothespins?</p>

<p>I might put the lettuce in the icebox then, if I had the icebox,
but my experience is that lettuce ought to be kept fairly warm. It's
frozen on me too often. If, dear reader, you have ever tried to keep
a head of lettuce in a seaside bungalow in zero weather, you realize
that said employment comes under the head of vain ideals and lost
causes. You retire in good order after tucking it into its crib, and
that very night, the worst since the blizzard of '88, the kitchen
stove gives out. Comes the dawn, and your cherished head of lettuce
is only one more item to take out and bury.</p>

<p>I have often been urged to go ahead and eat the lettuce before it
has had time to thaw, but that's easier said than done. Liquefaction
sets in as soon as you build the fire. Melted lettuce is much less
palatable than it sounds, and it sounds awful; too, its appearance,
at once an&aelig;mic and utterly blah, is all against it. Have you
ever noticed the reproachful look of a head of lettuce that had
trusted you? It doesn't bear thinking of, much less eating. Let us
trust that some day science will tell us how to revive a head of
lettuce that has gone the way of all vegetables; at present chafing
with handfuls of snow and frostbite drill by the Coast Guard crew
only complicate matters.</p>

<p>I'm rather surprised to find myself so worked up about this
subject; I hadn't realized how I cared. Strange, for the truth is
that the emotional kick of lettuce is not so good; it lacks
something. Lettuce has a fundamentally lovable nature, within limits,
but it doesn't knock you all of a heap, like. I'm all for the
lightning stroke myself, as opposed to the lambent fireside glow of
understanding comradeship. Electrocution's the word! Strike me pink
and I'm happy. My affection for lettuce is not like that. With me it
seems to arouse the instincts of pity and protection. I want to guard
it against life's pitfalls, save it from the many dangers of this
jazz-mad age and see that it doesn't go making a fool of itself. I
want to feel sure that after I have been out at a conference I have
something pretty nice, after all, to come back to, something I can
respect. The place for lettuce is in the home.</p>

<p>As for the other contents of my salads, I favor the full meal
model, preferably of the protein or carnivorous type. With an
exclusively vegetarian salad I always feel that somehow I am not
experiencing nearly all life has to offer. The lettuce, tomatoes,
carrots and what not of the main dish are all the better for some
canned fish, potted meat or cold boiled eggs. Such a combination, if
large enough, goes very well with a snack of bread and butter, cold
beans, crackers and cheese, bread and molasses, cigarettes, coffee,
bread and jam, clam chowder and more bread and jam. I don't care what
you put on it. Personally, I do not live in the odor of garlic.</p>

<p>I suppose salads ought to be beautiful, but I can't seem to get
the knack of those artistic rainbow creations you see in the ads.
Lately I saw a highly colored composition of green peas, grated
carrots, tomato jelly, shrimp, maidenhair fern and pimiento which I
regarded as little, if at all, inferior to the Mona Lisa. A cherry
here, a prune there, makes all the difference. Anyway, my salads
seldom reach the table, for by the time I should have the whole thing
assembled and strategically piled at the old feeding place I most
generally have eaten the color scheme as I went along. I may suggest,
however, that a few almonds, pecans, filberts or pistachios scattered
negligently about will serve admirably to give your salads that nutty
appearance. Still, looks aren't everything. The kind of salad I yearn
for is the kind they used to have at the Presbyterian socials in
Auburn, Indiana. It consisted, in part, of potatoes, spring onions,
boiled eggs, celery, lettuce and parsley&mdash;the rest was genius. I
understand there are still branches of the same lodge in Hicksville,
Ohio, and White Pigeon, Michigan&mdash;how about it, Aunt Eliza?</p>

<p>And speaking of thrills&mdash;oh, you celery! There can never
possibly be too much celery. That is why I often plan, as I sit
thinking my thoughts and watching the steam dredges and civilization
creep closer and closer to my hermitage, to move to Kalamazoo. If one
must be civilized, one might as well go where the celery is. Still
and all, I may decide on Hershey, Pa.</p>

<h3><a name="A_PLEA_FOR_BETTER_BATTER" id=
"A_PLEA_FOR_BETTER_BATTER"></a>A PLEA FOR BETTER BATTER</h3>

<p>Dear "Worried":</p>

<p>I shall be delighted to correspond with one who seems to take such
a deep interest in all that pertains to the habits, customs and
folklore of the pancake. Your letter has touched me in the right
spot, for, as you doubtless know, we hermits are almost solely
dependent upon pancakes for our enzymes, hormones, amino-acids,
migraine and miscellaneous <i>joie de vivre</i>. It must be fate that
has brought us together, if I can ever get over to Staten Island, but
are you sure you gave me your real name? Are you in the telephone
book? But now let's dispose of unfinished business.</p>

<p>You tell me that you are very, very fond of pancakes, and wish to
know if I approve. Am I, you ask, in favor of the pancake when
employed as human food? At first blush I feel inclined to reply, as
usual, yes&mdash;and no. But I am weary of that age-old, fool-proof
answer, though it is probably the best one ever invented up to now.
Let us have done with such halting dubieties. Let us cast off the
shackles of doubt and take our stand for the moment upon an
everlasting Yea! Let's have pancakes if we want them.</p>

<p>I mean by this, my dear "Worried," that of course it's all right
to have pancakes if you like them and if they harm nobody else very
much. But right here we bump against the moral issue, since you imply
that though you thrive upon the succulent flapjack, your husband and
seven children have a furious and ungovernable aversion to same as a
steady diet. Anybody who has ever been in a family can but
sympathize. As I often remark, laughingly, families are a public
nuisance. I mean it is often hard to see the home for the family.</p>

<p>It looks to me, "Worried," as though you are suffering from a New
England conscience or some severe infantile trauma, or both. I am
running enough lives as it is, but let me remind you that we pass
this way but once. I suggest that you take up the philosophy of
Aristippus of Gyrene, in which you will find good excuses for almost
everything that's a lot of fun, with just enough Marcus Aurelius
thrown in so that you can cast a free and untrammeled balance between
the pleasure you actually derive from pancakes and the annoyance to
which you are subjected in listening to the complaints and shooting
cramps of your loved ones. Look at the matter in a detached and
sensible way, as if you were still happy and single.</p>

<p>If you decide then that griddle cakes are what you really want in
this life, go to it. If you crave pancakes more than the rest of the
vain shams of the world, eat them&mdash;all you can get, up to the
seventeen per sitting allowed by the leading insurance companies.
Give all you own for griddle cakes. We have our special ways of
praising the Lord, and if such be your desire and destiny, say it
with pancakes. As dear old sentimental Baudelaire would have advised
you, be drunken, if only on pancakes. Thus and only thus will you be
able to murmur, as an exit line, "Well, I ate every gosh-blamed
pancake I could stow away, and I glory in it!"</p>

<p>Yes, I know, all the time your poor family will be eating them,
too, growing meaner and meaner, and perhaps staggering in and out of
the dining room in loud tortures of acute double-jointed gastritis.
Still, if they weren't kicking about pancakes, it would be parsnips,
or baked apples, or codfish balls. In concentrating their violence
upon pancakes you will be providing them with a comparatively
harmless outlet for the baser passions and helping the crime
situation. They will simply take it out on pancakes, instead of their
fellow creatures.</p>

<p>And yet, "Worried," and yet&mdash; Too surely the day will come
when you will recover from this passing fancy. You will awake some
morning, suddenly, just like that, with the exclamation, "Heavens,
how I detest pancakes!" The very thought of batter will be bitter.
You will wonder what you ever saw in them in the first place, and, by
God's mercy, pancakes will seem even a little bit ridiculous. You
will take up the shattered pieces of your past and pass on, I hope,
to less monotonous and maybe higher things.</p>

<p>Believe me, whether you then join the vast army of prune fans or
the orange juice and dry toast addicts, you will find either pleasant
enough in its way. Perhaps never again will you recover the mad,
godlike frenzy of your pancake phase. Nor can I promise that you will
be a bigger woman, for pancakes are fattening&mdash;had you thought
of that? But you will have gazed into your interior and made your
peace with prunes, and I think, all said, that you will be happier.
You will have come safely through the Neo-hedonists and arrived at
the Aristotelian mean, bless its old practical heart. You can live
with it. And what's more, your family can live with you.</p>

<p>In advising you to go ahead, I have only meant to suggest that
until the pancake problem works itself out naturally and inevitably
in your inmost soul, without external compulsion, don't weaken. While
you are young and able to fight your husband and seven children on
even terms, have a good time in your own way. But there's a
limit&mdash;Oh, remember that! Don't keep it up too long. Else some
tragic morn you are likely to face an empty breakfast table and a
vacant hearth and to hear through receding bursts of mocking laughter
the fatal cry, "You made your batter&mdash;now lie in it!"</p>

<p>I can best answer your other questions, "Worried," by telling you
about the Inter-Sandbar Pancake Convention held in my shack last
week. As a good time was had by all, we hope to make it an annual
affair. The first session was only an informal gathering consisting
roughly of the hermit of Goose Crick, a game warden from shore
(America, as we often call it), an oyster tender from Whale-neck
Point and one of the boys from Snappin' Island, who rowed over for a
chat and a shot at something that might go good in a stew. And, of
course, over the Orange Pekoe and Fig Newtons the subject nearest all
our hearts was bound to come up.</p>

<p>For instance, about lumps in the batter. I have been frantically
chasing those lumps around my pet dipper for years without tangible
results. No man on earth has put more downright industry&mdash;nay,
passion&mdash;into his job. And what has it got me? I have stalked
them with a fork and squeezed them with the back of a spoon, I have
waited until they came round again and swatted them with a knife, a
small trowel, with what not? I have done everything but dive into the
dipper and engage in hand-to-hand conflict, only to decide again and
again that there is something about lumps in the batter that we poor
mortals were not meant to understand, let alone do anything
about.</p>

<p>No sooner had I mentioned those lumps, casual-like, to the hermit
of Goose Crick, than I was conscious of a new feeling in my kitchen.
A tense, telepathic, electric, throbbing change came over those
strong silent baymen sitting in the sink, on the floor and in my
chair. I thought for a moment that Pete, who had come over from the
Coast Guard Station, would burst into tears at the sheer poignancy of
it all. We were moved as by a trumpet call or a dinner bell. We had
all been chasing those same lumps for years. How alike we are in
fundamentals! Or are we?</p>

<p>And then, dear "Worried," it came to me in a flash of what we book
reviewers jokingly call inspiration. Suddenly I remembered some
priceless words of Miss Florence Brobeck's in one of those recipes
she thinks up for millionaires with model kitchens&mdash;perhaps it
was in her classic essay on ketchup. Well, I just waved my Fig Newton
in the air and repeated her magic phrase, "Put through a
colander!"</p>

<p>I will spare you the scene of almost indescribable confusion that
followed the release of all that pent-up emotion. Suffice it to say
that I gave Florence Brobeck full credit, and henceforth, wherever
hermits ply their trade in the chill dawn of Great South Bay,
wherever Coast Guards are to be observed at 6 <span class=
"smcap">a.m</span>. putting their pancakes through a fine-toothed
colander, Miss Brobeck will be known as a full-fledged life-saver
with the freedom of the flats and the rank of admiral. Unfortunately
for hermits, this lady likes her pancakes Russian, with caviar and
sour cream, and expects them to be surrounded by chicken Florentine
Moray, clams Duxberry, Hawaiian curry with Major Gray's Indian
chutney, cottage cheese, gooseberry jam, gingerbread, a cheese
slipover consisting of a deep-dish apple pie with a Welsh rabbit
melted over it, lobster stuffed and baked, broccoli Parmesan, crisp
endive with Roquefort dressing, baked Alaska, coffee with grated
orange peel and a clove, a Bacardi swizzle and a bottle of Fiora del
Alpina, with a cashew nut to nibble and any other expensive or out of
season comestibles obtainable or not. Ah, well!</p>

<p>All the boys have promised to get colanders as soon as the spring
thaws arrive, so something is sure to come of it unless they forget.
I happen to have a colander of my own, which came with the shack and
has been lying fallow all this time. It's not what it was, but I
believe it can be restored to its pristine vigor and an entirely new
field of usefulness with a few bits of string and glue. I must report
that there was one dissenting voice, as there always is in any
iconoclastic and forward-looking movement. Said Singapore Sam, the
hardest-boiled of the Coast Guards, "I guess your appetite must be
all in your head if you can't stand a few lumps in your records." Out
here we call them records, and that is the real origin of the popular
phrase, "Put on another record."</p>

<p>At our next meeting we hope to tackle the problem of how to mix
pancakes without mixing enough for a family of twenty-nine. You know
how it is. In the effort to obtain a proper consistency of batter one
is always pumping too much water into the dipper and then adding too
much flour to make it come out even again. As the batter grows by
leaps and bounds, the nest of yellow bowls and a part of the floor
are soon full and overflowing, with resultant waste and mental agony.
It is almost enough to make one give up hermiting.</p>

<p>"This thing has got to stop!" I often say to myself as I try to
stem the tide, but try and do it. The worst of it is that once you
have obtained a practicable thickness or thinness of the batter you
must act with lightning speed. Turn your back an instant, the stuff
changes on you and the whole nerve-racking, soul-shattering procedure
begins all over again. I suppose the thing to do is simply to take a
chance on the first stirring, have the griddle hot, pull yourself
together, dump in the batter, trust to luck and watch for the
bubbles.</p>

<h3><a name="PERILS_OF_THE_HOME" id="PERILS_OF_THE_HOME"></a>PERILS
OF THE HOME</h3>

<p>I forget what humane author first wrote, albeit guardedly, in fear
and trembling, of housekeeping as a dangerous profession. Guardedly,
because this is one of those delicate subjects over which the
governing classes, through centuries of oppression and for reasons
that would hardly bear investigation, have cast a veil of illusion,
of obscurantism, of downright falsehood. Most essayists who so much
as mention it are never heard of again; others are kidnapped and held
for ransom, with no takers. And we housekeepers have stood for it all
like a flock of fish.</p>

<p>Surely the times are ripe for&mdash;I mean to say, it seems as
though we ought to take steps, and no halfway ones, either. Let us
get together and give our opponents a bit of lip about the perils of
the home. After all, talking back is about all one can hope to
accomplish in this mortal vale. Much good it does, too, though it
often saves a visit to the psycho-analyst and otherwise helps to cut
down the manic-depressive statistics. The majority of housekeepers
have hysterics in the butler's pantry simply and solely because they
don't come right out and tell the world what a fix they're in.</p>

<p>I look for no immediate improvement in conditions. Philanthropy
hasn't got to us yet. Social science is too busy building fences
around complicated and rather silly industrial machines which have
been invented, apparently, for the one purpose of having fences built
around them. What does it care if we unprotected kitchen mechanics
sit down on a red-hot stove? Hermits can do next to nothing about
such a state of affairs, but there are plenty of others who can.
Decent legislation may come eventually, or it may not, if you
housekeepers who are in a position to do so begin at once to nag and
keep on nagging until something happens. Persistent nagging, my
friends, has achieved more victories here below than all the armies
of the military geniuses and kings and potentates combined. It would
be a sad day if this, practically the only weapon remaining to a
large proportion of our citizens in this age of&mdash;this age
of&mdash;well, if they lost it all of a sudden.</p>

<p>My own contribution to the cause, consisting of data collected
during quite a spell of home work at Jones's, is put forward as a
mere feeler, on the chance that it may call forth the testimony of
those who have been crippled up, cut, scratched, gouged, banged and
bettered even more than I have; thus a dormant public opinion may be
aroused and we may all live to see a situation known in legal
parlance as the <i>status quo</i>. Not yet a complete and incurable
wreck from the so-called pleasures of steering the domestic craft, I
feel in my bones what is coming; I fear there are millions to whom it
has already come.</p>

<p>I believe the fiendishness of inanimate objects is familiar to all
who have ever been chummy with a kitchen stove. My own stove is
perhaps my proudest possession, but, like so many other things one
cares for, it can be cruel. It has taught me to think kindlier of the
heroines of novels and plays who burn their fingers the minute they
try to cook a biscuit or its equivalent for the hero. I used to
regard the heroine who did this as a low form of half-wit who should
be taken out and shot. I still think that a big grown-up girl should
be able to shoot a biscuit without yelling bloody murder, but now I
can see her side of it, too. I suggest that young women who blister
themselves once or twice be let off with a warning; after that,
anything goes.</p>

<p>The suspicion remains that they do it to be cute. Stop it, girls!
You don't see seasoned housewives who can bake strawberry shortcake
and all that giving way to these fits of temperament. I suppose that
after they have manufactured some tons of biscuits for a family of
about eleven over a stretch of years the desire to be cute in that
particular way sort of wears off. Still, occasionally they get
theirs, in spite of woman's intuition and the really uncanny skill
with which she learns to coax an incandescent and reluctant muffin
into her clutches. Lacking as they are in patience, finesse, sympathy
and Christian charity, male housekeepers find the problem pretty
fierce. You know them by their bandages.</p>

<p>Or take frying pans. Some joker has gone to the trouble of
inventing one with a trick wooden handle which revolves upon its
axis, or vice versa, at the psychological moment, dashing the
simmering contents upon all and sundry. I have one. The perennially
unsuspecting <i>chef</i> who tries to carry a panful of boiling bacon
grease from the stove to the sink is out of luck nine times in ten.
The artistic effects are even worse than the shooting pains along the
exposed flank. Nobody likes to see a mess of fried eggs on his
spotless floor; it might be spotless but for these very tragedies. A
meal of creamed codfish in the same posture is quite as
<i>gauche</i>. Pancakes may be dusted off, generally rehabilitated
and bolted as usual, but a skillet of dried beef gravy that has once
fallen is just fallen dried beef gravy. Just something else to mop
up. More small talk, more vows of deadly vengeance, more maniacal
laughter in the face of pitiless destiny.</p>

<p>My frying pan will look as though it had not a thought in the
world but to make me happy and gay, then&mdash;Bam! go the French
fried. Plainly I foresee the day when I'm going to spill a quart of
hot clam stew down the back of some haughty dowager, just after I
have become engaged to her homely but wealthy daughter. You may well
shudder. The dowager will start reprisals and one of us will get the
bum's rush.</p>

<p>Yet hermiting is not commonly classed as a hazardous occupation.
True, out here at Jones's one can't get run over by an automobile,
gaspiped by thugs or pushed under a subway train, but within the
sacred portals of the home (and why shouldn't hermits have sanctity
in their homes, like anybody else?) the risks are quite as
omnipresent and grave as in Manhattan itself, or Indiana. Here as
elsewhere one has the towel rack to gouge out portions of the human
face, the hanging lamp to extract divots from the invaluable scalp,
lamp chimneys to slice off hunks of one's favorite finger, coffee
cups to bounce on your bean from the top shelf, needles and pins to
turn up in totally unexpected regions of the torso and all the other
accompaniments of the cloistered career. Every move a pain.</p>

<p>The peculiar maimed and mangled appearance of hermit housekeepers,
as distinguished from the civilized, is in part attributable to
wood-splitting, a sport which compares favorably with the better
class of explosions and earthquakes. It is extraordinary the way a
log of driftwood will leap up and soak you in the beak at the
slightest provocation; which leads me to pass on to married persons a
hint I found in an old newspaper under the bedroom carpet. It seems
that a lady who was wont to lecture her husband daily for his sins
while he was chopping the firewood got gorgeously biffed in the eye
by a large flying wedge of hickory, with resultant syncope and
temporary impairment of the vocal cords, glottis and epiglottis. She
complained that he had been trying to do that very identical thing
for forty years. The judge let him off.</p>

<p>Yes, what with tripping over the coal scuttle into tubs of wash,
stepping on tacks, grappling with splinters and fishhooks, getting
stuck in the wringer, barking our shins on the tool chest, drowning
in dishwater while ramming the mop into the milk bottle, losing our
front hair in gasoline explosions, slipping in the bathtub and
falling up and down stairs with armfuls of this and that, we
housekeepers do our bit towards keeping modern life picturesque. For
us existence is one long procession of adhesive tape, rubber fingers,
iodine, arnica, chloroform liniment, hot water bottles and weak
gruel. And what does it get us? Admiration? Don't make me laugh.
People will gape by the hour at a parachute-jumper in the curious
belief that by comparison we in the home are a lot of timid,
unenterprising worms, if not actually slackers, cowards and caitiffs
(Memo: Must look up caitiffs). What I say is, in a parachute at least
you know where you are.</p>

<p>I trust I have not exaggerated the risks run gayly and
high-heartedly by so many of us. Let us seek the silver lining. It is
true that we have chosen, perhaps none too wisely, between retaining
the use of most of our original faculties and doing the housework.
But&mdash;and here's the point&mdash;we know the thrill of adventure!
We have escaped the drab lot of laborers in TNT factories and of
sitters upon volcanoes, of the tamers of man-eating lions and of the
human flies who climb the Woolworth Building with their fingernails.
We have felt the exaltation of real danger. We have lived. Besides,
there are savage tribes in Africa which greatly esteem and honor such
bumps and blemishes, scratches, scarifications and mutilations as we
housekeepers regularly acquire in the line of duty. If we ever move
to the jungle that might mean a lot in a social way.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="DOWN_WITH_BRILLAT-SAVARIN" id=
"DOWN_WITH_BRILLAT-SAVARIN"></a>DOWN WITH BRILLAT-SAVARIN!</h3>

<p>It's getting so a body cannot mention food or eating without being
called, among other things, the Brillat-Savarin of his time. Let but
some mute, inglorious hermit babble of condensed milk sandwiches, he
will immediately be tagged as a gourmet or a gourmand (whichever is
which), a connoisseur, a <i>ban vivant</i> and a prominent
salad-mixer. From there 't is but a step to the name of Sybarite,
trilobite, hellgramite and worse. That's the way it goes in this
business.</p>

<p>Well, my conscience is clear. I know and everybody knows who has
ever visited me at Jones's Island that I am <i>not</i>
Brillat-Savarin; if others choose to insist I can only repeat that
it's all a terrible misunderstanding. Brillat-Savarin was a lawyer, a
physician, a philosopher, a diner-out, a high priest of
transcendental gastronomy, an inhaler of ortolans, and the final
authority on <i>poularde de Bresse truff&eacute;e &agrave; la
p&eacute;rigourdine</i>. His pheasants had to be just so. I take my
food as I find it, no questions asked. That day seems afar off, and I
pray that it may never dawn, when I shall sneer at a hot dog. I
believe I may say without exaggeration that we represent two entirely
distinct schools of thought. That's only fair to both of us.</p>

<p>I seldom achieve ecstasy at my meals. I don't gloat enough over my
food to be really artistic. Still and all, I remain unconvinced that
in order to know anything whatever about the subject it is necessary
to have been christened Jean Anthelme Marie Henri Louis Philippe
Marie Hippolyte, to have written a volume entitled "<i>Physiologie du
go&ucirc;t; ou, M&eacute;ditations de gastronomic transcendante</i>"
and to have died in Paris, Feb. 2, 1826, after seventy-one years of
almost continuous banqueting on <i>poularde de Bresse truff&eacute;e
&agrave; la p&eacute;rigourdine</i>. At times, when I have been
goaded past endurance by invidious comparisons, I feel that I could
cast off all restraint and state boldly, without fear or favor, that
Brillat-Savarin was full of truffles. There!</p>

<p>But let's get one thing straight. Before launching my vicious
attack against Brillat-Savarin and his "Physiology of Taste" I wish
to defend him against the charge of intemperance. It was the Marquis
de Cussy, a contemporary observer, who wrote: "Brillant-Savarin ate
copiously and ill; chose little, talked dully, had no vivacity in his
looks, and was absorbed at the end of a repast." Well, why wouldn't
he be absorbed? In my opinion the Marquis de Cussy was jealous,
auto-intoxicated and afflicted with a negative <i>poularde</i>
complex, if not with subconscious homicidal tendencies. Supposing
Brillat-Savarin did overeat once in a way! I'm strongly in favor of
that, if only to spite the Anti-Fun League. Things have come to a
pretty pass when a champion gourmand cannot overeat. And what was the
marquis doing there? It looks as though he was not a total stranger
himself to what some cynic has called the pleasures of the
trough.</p>

<p>What riles me more, with its veiled insinuations and subtle
propaganda against Jones's Island and the Zachs Inlet Coast Guard
Station, is the master's famous Fourth Aphorism, "<i>Dis-moi ce que
tu manges, je te dirai ce qui tu es</i>"; which is as much as to say,
"Tell me what you eat and I'll tell you what you are." To this I
simply reply, "<i>Non! Jamais de la vie!</i>" which may be freely
translated, He's crazy. Were this theory to be generally accepted,
dear reader, it would make you bacon and eggs and sometimes chicken
on Sunday. In a way it stands to reason, or almost. Perhaps the man
who eats a potato in its jacket does thereupon instantly become,
through some strange doings of Dr. Albert Einstein, a <i>pomme de
terre en robe de chambre</i>&mdash;who am I to say? A pleasing
whimsy, but doubtless more strictly true in some dimension other than
the first three. And what about prunes?</p>

<p>I could wish that Brillat-Savarin had been more charitable in this
matter. We can't all have the Blue Plate dinner. The person who feeds
upon desiccated tripe is often a person, admirable in other respects,
who has been driven by hereditary influences, environment, radio,
women or the hellishness of life as a whole to feed upon desiccated
tripe. Show me a man toying with a side-order of parsnips and nine
times out of ten he is a man who can't get roast turkey with
dressing. Figure to yourself a hermit who lives exclusively upon
strawberry shortcake, and you're straining your imagination. And what
of him whom cruel destiny has forced to become omnivorous? Is he by
that token a cross between an ostrich and a goat? Well, then, M.
Brillat-Savarin!</p>

<p>Moreover, I find it difficult, as I wrestle catch-as-catch-can
with the bean and other dietary problems, to forgive our author for
remarking that "the empire of taste has also its blind and deaf
people." Thusly he rubs it in: "The sensation of taste resides
principally in the papill&aelig; of the tongue. But anatomy teaches
us that every tongue has not the same number of them, and that in
some tongues there are three times as many papill&aelig; as in
others." You cannot miss the artful implication that he has more
papill&aelig; than he really needs and that hermits have hardly any,
a rumor against housekeeping bachelors from the day that the Egyptian
called Antonios fled from the fleshpots of Heracleopolis with a
basket of lentils, not to mention Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius,
whose cupboard was even barer. They hadn't all their papill&aelig;,
forsooth! That seems to me too facile an explanation of the mystic
way. What, then, were the real facts? Why was it that neither of
these famous hermits would have stepped across the street for a
double order of <i>filet de sole Margu&eacute;ry</i>? Well, they had
other fish to fry.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that the dictionary lends partial support to
this absurd doctrine of papill&aelig;, submitting that the
papill&aelig; are known according to their shape as circumvallate,
fungiform and filiform, and that the circumvallate and the fungiform
bear taste buds. This is a pretty fix to be in, if you care for that
sort of thing. Taste buds, indeed! What next won't they invent?</p>

<p>A careful comparison of Brillat-Savarin's dates and my own would
seem to indicate that he never heard of me, yet the whole inner
message of his book for the modern world is that eating is a lost art
and that I lost it. I wonder! I hold no brief against the
&aelig;sthetics of deglutition. There's room for all kinds in this
world. All I'm saying is that in order to enjoy your three squares
rightly you don't have to win a pie-eating contest.</p>

<p>True, voluptuous nourishment is not encouraged at Jones's. Already
there have occurred regrettable incidents in the Zachs Inlet
mess-room, chiefly over stew; it would be too awful if the boys got
to demanding their plum duff on weekdays. For disciplinary reasons
Coast Guards who show the early symptoms of transcendental gastronomy
are sent on cutter duty, shipped to the Siberian mines or ordered to
paint the oil-house. While I remain their neighbor I must set an
example. Some day&mdash;who knows? I may even become a Sybarite, if I
can get the gardenia.</p>

<p>And I have another crow to pick with Brillat-Savarin, or shall I
say a potato? Observe the utter wrongness of this passage from his
Meditation XXI: "I look upon potatoes as a great preservative against
famine; but, except that, they seem to me thoroughly insipid." Now I
seldom indulge in violent abuse, but at the risk of provoking a duel
I declare that Brillat-Savarin says the thing that is not. To
maintain that potatoes are tasteless is to maintain stark, staring
lunacy. It all goes to show that people who brag about their
papill&aelig; only too often turn out sadly deficient, just pathetic
victims of Adlerian organ inferiority; while people you'd swear had
not a papilla to bless themselves with are likely to give you the
surprise of your life.</p>

<p>Economically as well as psychologically, an abhorrence of potatoes
leads to no good. Many of those who scorn this humble vegetable
because it is abundant and inexpensive wind up in the poorhouse,
though it is but just to admit that about an equal number become
millionaires&mdash;it's a poor potato that won't work both ways. It
is a not less significant fact that those who love potatoes,
especially baked potatoes, are almost invariably a credit to
themselves, their community and their country.</p>

<p>Brillat-Savarin appears also to regard the potato as a deadly
poison, since he speaks of the necessary removal by the cook of its
"deleterious qualities," doubtless referring to the valuable mineral
salts, vitamins and horoscopes in the skins. All this is hard to
bear, what with M. Tissot's book proving that potatoes cause idiocy,
palsy and leprosy, and the clamoring of those who stigmatize potatoes
as unscriptural&mdash;they're not mentioned in the Bible. Worse
(though it may be all newspaper talk), there are said to exist to-day
in our midst some very tiresome persons out to stop the constant
crossbreeding so essential to the health, happiness and reproduction
of the potato on the ground that it is inimical to the morals of the
tuber and will eventually undermine the home. What, they inquire,
will happen to endogamy if all this exogamy is allowed to go on? And
what, I ask right back, will happen to hermits and Colorado beetles
if it isn't?</p>

<p>Let them rave. Let a froward generation of artichoke fans run
after their decadent groceries. Let Brillat-Savarin, swollen with
insensate pride and truffles, lash his whiskers in impotent fury, the
fact remains and shall not go unheard while I have strength to yell
that baked potatoes are grand. What a dish, my friends, is this! How
new in season! how exquisite in sapidity! in form and flavor how
easily digestible! with butter how like nothing else! with salt and
pepper how perfectly damned gorgeous! the bachelor's delight! the
paragon of edibles! I speak now, dear reader, of victuals that are
victuals. Tell me not, after I have eaten my full want of the same,
that nobody loves me or that life's but an empty dream; I know
different. It is tragic, is it not, that our English and American
bards have not devoted more attention to this inspiring theme? I
confess with something akin to sorrow that I know of no epic,
excepting a few in Lithuanian and several in the ancient Coptic,
dealing at all adequately with the baked potato.</p>

<p>If there is a better food, tell me what it is. You can't!&mdash;I
thought so. Any one who has done justice to an adult baked potato
garnished with a chopped raw onion, a poached egg, a scant handful of
Hamburger, a few bits of crisp bacon, some gravy and extra butter may
well lean back in his chair and quote those lovely words of Bartlett,
"Fate cannot harm me&mdash;I have dined to-day." I have a little
theory of my own which I might as well spring right now: I regard it
as practically certain that the baked potato was the original
ambrosia, the food of the gods mentioned so prominently by Mr.
Bulfinch.</p>

<p>Alas, there are some unruly fans who refuse to eat the skins,
either from a fear of germs, a nitrogen-phobia or pure meanness. If
taken in time the most stubborn nitrogen-phobia can be cured; the
pity is that more and more young victims are permitted to grow up
without treatment, filling the world with more wife-beaters,
absconding cashiers, theater coughers and people who say there is too
much sex in Freud. Those who believe in bacilli may wash the potato
before using&mdash;a good, durable potato-washer can be purchased at
the nicer shops for seven dollars.</p>

<p>The preparation of this dish involves a considerable risk to the
performer, but what doesn't that's any fun at all? Up to now our
inventors, clever as they are at measuring the diameter of
Betelgeuse, have not taught us potato bakers how to prevent severe
burns, both going and coming. Many housekeepers manage to escape
serious injury while putting the potatoes in the oven, but getting
them out again is not so simple. If the top of the oven doesn't get
you the door will, and if by some lucky chance you emerge in good
condition, except for a blistered face and a soul forsworn, you still
have three red-hot potatoes in each fist and a very vague notion of
where to put them. It seems advisable for all those who bake potatoes
rather constantly to take a course in big-time juggling. What a seal
can do, you can do.</p>

<p>I hate to dwell upon these cosmic disharmonies, but I must add one
more warning, based rather upon my reading than upon personal
experience. It appears that the atoms of baked potatoes&mdash;and
this food is particularly rich in atoms&mdash;are so arranged that
the potato is liable to burst with a terrific roar if fondled or
squeezed immediately after its stretch in the oven, scattering
poultices of superheated pulp, volcanic steam and widespread
destruction in its wake. A tradition exists that one ought to prick
the skin of the potato before baking, thus releasing a few billions
of the superfluous atoms and providing against some of the more
spectacular explosions. Conservative potato-squeezers follow this
technique, but most of us who belong to the war generation just take
a chance&mdash;it's all in the game. If you are nervous and run down,
however, it will do no harm to lay in a garden rake, some atom-proof
gloves, a gas mask, a standard burn remedy, plenty of bandages and
the telephone number of a skilled physician&mdash;and keep your
insurance paid up. If you will take these precautions, your path
through life should be one long, sweet song; if not, you may never
know what hit you.</p>

<p>Anyway, you see now that the potato, far from being a dull,
insensitive clod, is wholly a creature of impulse, a passionate,
high-pressure vegetable knowing no laws but those of its own free,
untrammeled nature, as wholly irresponsible as all true genius ever
was and will be. Insipid? The word does not fit into the picture. I
leave the potato in your hands, my friends, confident that it will
receive fair treatment from so broad-minded and good-looking a
jury.</p>

<p>Does it not strike you as rather tragic that in so enlightened an
age I must add to this article a systematic defense of roast turkey?
Yet that such an emergency exists no person in his sober senses would
dream of denying&mdash;and all because of Brillat-Savarin.
Fortunately, he left roast turkey with a few shreds of its
reputation, though he might have done better. His characterization of
this noble creature as "the largest, and, if not the finest, at least
the most savory of our domestic birds,"&mdash;savory is the word, but
why not the finest, M. Brillat-Savarin?&mdash;is probably the
grandfather of some of the anti-turkey opinions circulated so freely
nowadays by gastronomes and other society leaders. The most sagacious
essayist in this country, by and large, but recently described the
turkey as "too big, too tough, too coarse grained." Did you ever hear
the like? It is the custom in some inner circles to raise an eyebrow
at intruders who prefer turkey to chicken and are courageous enough
to say so. Hostesses seem to fear that oafs of that sort are likely
at any moment to throw the broiler out the window and shout for roast
turkey&mdash;and if roast turkey, why not roast elephant or roast
diplodocus? Yet turkey-lovers can behave as well as any one else, and
always do so unless pushed too far.</p>

<p>I hear that in certain homes chicken, duck or goose is served even
on major feast days. We have ducks in plenty at Jones's, but it's not
the same; as for goose, one can only say that there are people whose
subtle affinity for goose is congenital and
ineradicable&mdash;nothing can be done about it, so why argue? Me and
the Coast Guards, give us turkey. The government and book reviewing
would be in a bad way on our island if the butcher and grocer on
shore did not send us turkeys for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New
Year's; the energy and efficiency of the inhabitants would be all
frittered away with indignation meetings, their voices worn hoarse
and haggard with the insistent cry, "We Want Turkey!" If the grocer
and the butcher ever weaken, there will be reprisals, swift and
terrible.</p>

<p>This brings us to osmazome, a mysterious and presumably delicious
ingredient which Brillat-Savarin says is found in very small
quantities or not at all in the white meat of turkeys. "It is for
this reason," he chirps, "that real connoisseurs have always
preferred the thick part of the thigh." Have they, indeed? Be that as
it may, upon white meat I take my everlasting stand&mdash;try and
budge me. These thigh fans often go to incredible lengths with their
foolishness. Speaking of a smaller bird than our hero,
Brillat-Savarin inquires, "Do we not see in our own days some that
can distinguish by its superior flavor the thigh on which the
partridge leans while sleeping?" Sure, we do. We also see some who
will sell you Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p>To Brillat-Savarin, of course, a turkey without truffles was but a
poor, homeless outcast, a veritable pariah fowl. This is hardly the
place, if there is such a place, to deal with truffles as they so
richly deserve. Our good Brillat-Savarin is known to have been more
than slightly hipped on them. He goes so far as to tell us, "However
good an entr&eacute;e may be, it should always be accompanied by
truffles to set it off to advantage"; naturally, a turkey without a
stuffing of these subterranean fungi was utterly outside the pale.
His one concession to the tight money situation is that persons of
moderate income may upon occasion stuff theirs with Lyons chestnuts.
For all that I hope that the sturdy peasantry of our land will long
continue to riot in forbidden stuffing. I shall, for one, to the last
scrap of stale bread, salt pork, sage and maybe oysters. Add giblet
gravy, and you can have your old stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>And another thing, should any of my readers remain unconvinced of
M. Brillat-Savarin's fallibility, I shall merely quote the following
sentence from the final pages of "The Physiology of Taste": "It was
the Count de Laplace who discovered a very elegant way of eating
strawberries, namely, of squeezing over them the juice of a sweet
orange, or apple of the Hesperides." Have fairer names ever been put
to a more dastardly use? Could a fiend from the pit devise a more
diabolical plot to ruin one&mdash;nay, two!&mdash;of God's grandest
fruits? I will bet anything within reason that this was the same
Laplace who balled up the nebular hypothesis so that they haven't got
it straightened out yet. I never liked that man's face. And where, I
ask you, were <i>his</i> papill&aelig;?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="HOW_TO_ENTERTAIN" id="HOW_TO_ENTERTAIN"></a>HOW TO
ENTERTAIN</h3>

<p>You'd hardly believe that Dame Rumor would bother her silly old
head about a mere hermit. Or would you? Well, Dame R. hath it that
she heard from a friend of hers, who got it straight from some one
who ought to know, that I told another party that I hated having
company, and that I wished all the people who visit me, promise to
visit me or threaten to do so would stay at home where they belong,
and not come pestering me at my seaside villa. That shows how things
get garbled.</p>

<p>I may have muttered in some unguarded moment at the unexpected, or
expected, arrival of a fresh batch of week-end guests, complete with
radio outfits, livestock, boatload of impedimenta and happy, carefree
laughter, when I was hoping against hope to finish a book review or
an article, or at least get one started, that I moved to Jones's
Island to be alone, and that running a more or less refined boarding
home from Thursdays to Wednesdays, excepting in January and February,
however enjoyable it might be from some points of view, struck me as
an exceedingly roundabout way of achieving that particular end. Is
that logic, or is it not? As for saying that persons who go merrily
stirring up hermits in their chosen solitudes invariably lack one or
more hemispheres of the cerebrum (the little gadget that is supposed
to make us think), I never! Nor did I state that ninety-nine per cent
of these hermit hunters are perfectly lovely people but practically
half-witted.</p>

<p>I deny the whole thing. I love company. I never tire of asking
everybody I meet on the mainland to come and see me at the first
opportunity. If I seem a little less cordial when they actually
arrive&mdash;well, I deny that, too. I trust I am not one to violate
the sacred laws of hospitality, even if it ruins my critical poise,
wrecks the second act of my play and generally makes of my fondest
dreams a hideous mockery. Why do you suppose I invite them, anyway?
Just to get them to shut up? I did tell one or two people that I
loathed having company, but they thought that was only my way of
making advances.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough to prevent company from reaching my island
if I were that sort of host. All I'd need would be a little
arrangement of floating mines, barbed wire entanglements, a cordon of
natives and a battery of trained scorpions, and I know a hermit who
is working on that now. I consider it a mean trick to give
prospective guests elaborate traveling directions which will land
them eventually in Montauk Point, Alaska or the South Seas. If I have
ever sounded vague about where Jones's is, that's partly because I
have no bump of direction&mdash;the Coast Guards attend to that sort
of thing&mdash;and because it is an ancient and inviolable rule for
hermits not to tell exactly where they live. The truth is they hardly
know themselves.</p>

<p>There are lots of nasty ways of getting rid of company, too.
Personally, I take steps as soon as the guests begin remarking that
the beach is so lovely and the sand so comfortable that they could
stay forever. I do nothing low, but manage to get the thought across
that they might be just as comfortable if they were on some other
beach bothering somebody else. A policy of slow starvation is
recommended by many hermits. Arsenic is no longer in favor, as the
coroners are beginning to detect it right and left in returned
week-enders. I merely mention these rather crude methods for what
they may be worth.</p>

<p>Perhaps I do appear slightly distrait and moody before my arriving
guests, but that's only because my bungalow isn't ready for them.
I've only lived in it seven years, and it isn't rid up yet. I haven't
got settled. An expert tells me that the shanty is quite lacking in
accommodations for any but the less fussy Hottentots, the hardier
Nootka Indians and the more informal and backward Kamchatkans. That
is why sensitive and cultured visitors who have left good homes to
come and see me often act so strangely. It explains why several of my
former friends have confessed at their departure that they felt as if
they had just been released from a long stretch at Dannemora. I may
mention here that it is not in the best taste to send one's weekend
host, instead of the usual clam chowder note, a comic Valentine
depicting a large and very repellent pig wallowing in the midst of an
untidy landscape labeled Jones's Island.</p>

<p>Speaking of how to act, I fancy I comport myself as well as some
of my guests from the moment I meet them at the dock. No hermit,
unless he has been called upon to welcome a mid-Victorian dowager
reeling to port after a hard night aground in Goose Crick in
Rattlesnake Ned's scooter, can rightfully claim that he has lived and
suffered, especially if she has frozen a few toes, got herself mixed
up with the motor, sat in the tar or dropped her aspirin overboard.
She is likely to say things. One of them recently read me my
horoscope with a richness of epithet that was supposed to have died
out with the Elizabethan pamphleteers and a few of the prettier
duchesses at the court of Charles the Second. It wasn't as bad as
that, really, but she was pretty mad. She still believes that Ned hit
the mud on purpose and that I, as the King Canute of these parts,
ordered the tide to wait until broad daylight. Week-enders, bless
their innocent hearts, are firmly convinced that hermits cause the
weather, the mosquitoes and all the other frightful phenomena
incidental to Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, though modern
science has gone out of its way to prove the exact opposite.</p>

<p>No, entertaining at the villa is not so simple as it might seem at
first glance. The ordinary rules for the bachelor's shooting lodge or
clam preserve hardly cover the ground, for I live here all the year
round and people expect something pretty polished. I used to strive
for a semblance of Old World gentility by awaiting my guests in the
drawing room (where the chairs are), as was always the custom at the
late Earl's place down in Kent, but I found that sooner or later I'd
have to chase down to the dock with the wheelbarrow, anyway. Now I
just rush for the scene at the first sign of trouble, prepared to
tell all and sundry how glad I am that a virulent cyclone did not
arise while they were in the middle of the bay and blow them all to
Amagansett and gone.</p>

<p>I also omit tea, but each arrival is more than welcome to as much
as he can stand of the pot of strong black coffee kept simmering on
the rear of my kitchen range, you might say for generations. Those
who prefer are shown at once to the sink to remove the marks of
travel; which is putting it optimistically, since the process would
remove at the same time the greater portion of the epidermis. For the
convenience of such I always keep my guest towel hanging right by the
pump, together with a supply of salt water soap, a good, durable
quality of steel wool and a pint bottle of iodine. In entertaining,
it's the little things that count.</p>

<p>Now, if it has stopped raining or snowing, we are all set for a
spell of real old-fashioned glee, such as bathing, clamming, eating,
clamming, bathing and eating. Ten to one the merry-makers will want
to carry their lunch to the surf and there consume it, whether from a
desire to provide their gustatory joys with a background in a big way
or to express their love for the Atlantic by throwing egg-shells and
banana peelings into it I have been unable to determine. I suppose
they mean it as a compliment. I'm not the type myself, and I am
against dispersing the general effect of the Atlantic among a lot of
dill pickles and sandwiches. I feel that it deserves one's undivided
attention&mdash;it's sort of earned it. Nevertheless, I trudge along,
and run back to the shack for water, and eat and run back for still
more water. Fun!</p>

<p>I recall one historic occasion when a visiting luncher smuggled
some canned music to the beach and, what's more, set it going
presumably to drown out the sound of God's waves. Well, one may rise
superior even to such a blow of fate. We happened to have with us a
prominent college widow of some seasons back, so she and I up and
waltzed, and if you want to see a certain eligible hermit give his
well-known imitation of Prince Charming, just strike up "Kiss Me
Again!" I have heard the sinister whisper passed along at more than
one party on shore, "Oh, don't bother with him, he's only a waltzer!"
I wear the insult gayly, like a plume. I glory in it! I could die
waltzing, and maybe I will yet.</p>

<p>As I delve into the secret memoirs of entertaining at Jones's, I
remember several happy afternoons, and I am not thinking of the day a
bevy of visitors made straight for the beach and got lost in the fog
until it was time to leave. For instance, it's all kinds of fun to
guess what was in the old tin cans that wash ashore. I only wish that
Rattlesnake Ned, who invented the game, would stop tasting the darn
things&mdash;it's taking unfair advantage of the fact that he's part
ostrich on his grandfather's side, and it makes week-enders nervous.
As I have no other pastimes to offer, I fear I am a far from perfect
host, but is it my fault if people who want to go visiting have got
me and the Coast Guards mixed up with the Prince of Wales' set, just
because we happen to live on the lunatic fringe of Long Island, the
playground of the rich?</p>

<p>One word to those who are planning to weekend with a hermit. Don't
expect too much; in fact, don't expect anything. Don't go around
muttering, "Never again!" Avoid making class-conscious remarks, such
as, "Well, well, so this is how the other half lives!" Some day you
might say that to the wrong hermit. When herded to your sleeping
quarters, if such they may be called, don't bring up Houston Street
and the Bowery. If you feel any social or other qualms about the
flopping arrangements, remind yourself that there is not room in my
house for both company and the conventions. Just try to remember that
I have moved out of my own bedroom, that I will have to move back
to-morrow and that with luck I may possibly get things fixed so that
I can start on that book review again by next Wednesday afternoon.
And that I just love company.</p>

<p>If you expect the hermit to furnish such staples as bread and
butter, don't kick if they aren't Grade A. It is pretty crude to
refer to the white bread served by the hermit as pumpernickel, but I
suppose you can't help knocking the butter. My butter is always
served in beautifully firm hunks in the winter, but in hot weather
it's something else again. I started housekeeping with the idea that
keeping ice in iceboxes is all foolishness, and I have stuck to my
theory, though the butter weakened. Besides, the top of my icebox is
full of books that all visitors so far classified would borrow if
they got half a chance. Bear in mind also that jokes about the
biscuits are no longer playing the big cities. You may not be aware
that in ancient Greece, before the Age of Luxury, the Spartans lived
on a simple dough of barley meal moistened with water and terrible
wine, and that it wasn't cooked <i>at all.</i> And don't examine that
green spot on the can of evaporated milk too closely; if it's a
<i>bacillus botulinus,</i> you probably have it already&mdash;go
quietly to your room, make your will and return without causing a
scene. But really, I get fewer complaints on my meals than you might
expect, considering. A recent guest was gracious enough to inform me
that I had provided a regular Barmecide feast. That's the spirit to
take on your week-ends!</p>

<p>All things come to an end, even company. Sooner or later the wet
blanket is sure to break into the party with the long-awaited remark,
"Well, Will, I guess we'd better be getting along." I fill in with
some neutral comment, such as, "I suppose I mustn't try to keep you,"
or "It does look as though you'd have just enough time to get across
the bay before it rains," and they're off. Most authorities on
etiquette agree that at parting neither the guest nor the host need
speak out all that is in his heart, yet I feel that a little
well-chosen invective and a fist fight or two often serve admirably
to clear the air and speed up the progress of the race as a whole.
And I beg to remind all hardworking hermits, everywhere, that if it
weren't company, it would be something else. Keep smiling!</p>

<h3><a name="SO_WHY_BE_PRESIDENT" id="SO_WHY_BE_PRESIDENT"></a>SO WHY
BE PRESIDENT?</h3>

<p>Who since the invention of printing by those heathen Chinese has
fitly sung the praise of cookery books? Alas, almost everybody! And
yet, the production and consumption of articles on this timely
subject being what they are, is there not always room and welcome for
one more? Here again a strict regard for the plain, unvarnished truth
might compel us to answer, "No!"</p>

<p>So far the argument appears to leave us about where we were, but
so do all arguments. We may as well proceed with the main topic of
the day, to wit, the use of cook books by old bachelors; to put it
more concretely, the use of my cook book by me, or vice versa, since
there are indications that the cook book has the upper hand.</p>

<p>Not that I am an abject slave to that or any other collection of
recipes. For I have lost the innocence of perfect faith. Time
was&mdash;and those were happy days&mdash;when I believed in the
direct inspiration of all cookery books. Before that fatal occasion
when some one introduced me to the tragedy of pure reason I believed
that recipes as a whole and in part, having originated in the brain
of Mrs. Rorer herself, who ought to know, were not for the likes of
us to pull to pieces and debate. Ours not to reason why. Some day
we'd understand.</p>

<p>Always a trusting soul, as a child I had not sought to question
the authority of revealed cooking as practiced by mother over a fire
she had presumably snatched from heaven for the sole benefit of your
humble servant. There was something in it, too. I can testify as well
that in spite of the Frenchified ways that even then were creeping
insidiously into our American kitchens, mother swung a mean sun-dried
cherry, not to mention her masterly crisp-fried beefsteak, her
chicken gravy with giblets, her mashed potatoes, her Charlotte Russe,
her endless dinner array of pickles, quince jelly, cookies,
strawberry shortcake and seven regular side dishes&mdash;nine for
company. And they wonder why I am plump.</p>

<p>Martha Washington was mixed up in all that, though I found out
later that she didn't write the "White House Cook Book." Yes, our old
kitchen companion was an early edition of that splendid work,
complete with our nation's Capitol and a view of the executive
mansion stamped in shining silver on the white front cover, both and
all now somewhat obscured by a rich patina of time and tomato soup.
There was Mrs. Washington's picture on page ninety-nine, just
opposite the directions for pot roast (Old Style), and much prettier,
I thought, than the smaller insets of Mrs. James Monroe, A. Adams and
Martha Jefferson Randolph. She and she alone inspired and guided my
first childish steps towards the presidency.</p>

<p>Now that I own this rare volume and have leisure to study the
several pages of our presidents' wives, I feel that I was right in
picking Martha Washington. Something of the old intimacy has fled,
but she is still beautiful in her powder and her shawl, or whatever
that thing is she has on; to-day she reminds me not so much of
strawberry shortcake as of some one I met at a masquerade. The others
are all right, too, though the sheik of our day might hesitate to
take some of them out, handy as they might come in at charades.
Lacking as one or two of them may be by the severest classic
tests&mdash;well, I'm sure their pictures don't do them justice,
especially Dolly Madison. A grand lot of girls they were, and if I
know a basque with jet passementerie when I see it I'll bet you they
could cook like a house afire; still and all, it seems there has been
a great improvement in this branch of our government here lately.</p>

<p>Times, as I was saying, have changed. Since I brought the old book
to Jones's Island I have learned by trial and error to look upon it,
if not with less reverence, at least with a clearer realization of
what it will do and what it won't. Much as I deplore the modern
tendency to higher criticism, I have found several recipes which are
obviously the survivals of some savage state of culture, others which
are certainly the work of commentators no brighter, to put it
bluntly, than I myself. In a word, carking care, relativity, natural
selection and all the ironies of life, love and art have forced me to
abandon the dogma of infallibility. Theoretically, that is. In a
tight place I seek the old book's guidance, just like the rest of us
poor hungry, baffled mortals. There's nothing quite like it
sometimes. Yet I would warn the inexperienced bachelor to have a care
in approaching any of the recipes which run above simple addition, to
close his eyes and ears to the seductions of those calling for
logarithms, square root and meringues.</p>

<p>Well for you, brother hermits, if you do not take the cook book
too literally. It is rather wonderful, I know, to read of chicken
patties, timbale of macaroni, potato snow, muttonettes, royal sago
pudding, syllabub, sweetbreads <i>&agrave; la Pompadour</i> and
<i>fruites saumon&eacute; au beurre de Montpellier</i>, but why let
it get you? We have all heard of these things, but who has actually
seen them? Who has made and eaten them? The use of a little common
sense right now will save the too optimistic hermit much useless
agony and vain regret, many a bitter longing for what exists,
perhaps, only as the wishful fantasy of some impractical dreamer.
Open your heart and your minds, my hermits, to the sheer loveliness
of the words, "sweetbreads <i>&agrave; la Pompadour</i>" but don't
forget that what really counts is ham and eggs. Such a point of view
need not poison for you the springs of beauty. If you have a cook
book, try to regard it as pure literature rather than as a guide to
conduct; as poetry rather than dull, plodding prose. After all, its
true value inheres in its symbolism. Much in life will still remain
to you, whether or not Jonah swallowed the whale.</p>

<p>Though an expert might estimate the practical influence of my cook
book upon my basal metabolism at approximately zero, or nil, I may
have picked up a thing or two just by luck. Without it I should never
have managed that rakish something about my fried salt pork and I
should be muddling along without escalloped corn. With it my lemon
pie and chocolate blanc mange remain in the controversial
field&mdash;the blanc mange is not at all bad if you use your
imagination. The lemon pie was only a joke. Anyway, I had sense
enough not to try apple dumplings. That way lies madness. In fact,
was it not George III who went crazy wondering how the apple got into
the dumpling? And to this day nobody knows how it did get in!</p>

<p>I went into cooking, as we all do, with the laughing heart of a
child, and emerged in the usual condition, after winning a hand or
two. In baking, for instance, I found the elementary straightaway
directions easy, lucid, admirable in every respect. I learned to make
cornmeal muffins without eggs; since then I have made them without
milk, without salt, without sugar, without baking powder and even
without cornmeal. A muffin will meet you halfway. It was a proud day
when finally I mastered the muffin, and it might have been a prouder
had I not sought, filled as I was with vaulting ambition and
vainglory, to scale the heights. "If muffins," I said to myself, "why
not marble cake, molasses fruit cake, chocolate layer? If chocolate
layer, why not sponge drops, why not lady fingers?" I well recall
when I cried out in my invincible ignorance, "If lady fingers, why
not angel's food?"</p>

<p>I shall not distress you with a description of my attempt at
angel's food. When I had worked my will upon the whites of eleven
eggs, the cream of tartar and what not, I took the count. I was
licked, and forever. Finally reason came winging back, and I opened a
can of beans. I can only say that if my recipe for angel's food is
intended as wit and humor, it's all sticky. If I had needed any
mucilage I would have turned to the proper page, after procuring the
needful amounts of gum dextrine, acetic acid, water and alcohol, if I
had to rob the compass. 'Twas thus I came to discover the true
inwardness of cook books for the hermitical intelligence and to
formulate my theory that they are to be considered as belonging to
the literature of escape.</p>

<p>Most of us can never hope to make an angel cake, yet need that
plunge us into dull despair? No; let us continue to read about all
kinds of cake, even cocoanut jumbles, in the firm belief that they
have a being in the Idea if not in the oven, upon some fairer plane
if not in the here and now. Anything else can but lead to the
dangerous materialism of Democritus as opposed to the teachings of
Plato.</p>

<p>There are also times when I permit myself a less orthodox
philosophical frolic, when I prefer to look upon my cook book, with
its recipes for lemon trifle, jelly kisses, apple puff, green
gooseberry tart, ribbon cake and tutti frutti ice cream exactly as I
look upon the "Egyptian Secrets" of Albertus Magnus, particularly his
remedy for the sweeny in man or beast, his amulet against cramp, what
to do if the cattle are bewitched, how to obtain money and how to
make yourself invisible. For this last "you must obtain the ear of a
black cat, boil it in the milk of a black cow, then make a
thumb-cover of it, and wear it on the thumb, and no one will be able
to see you." To get the cash, "take the eggs of a swallow, boil them,
return them to the nest, and if the old swallow brings a root to the
nest, take it, put it into your purse, and carry it in your pocket,
and be happy." Mind you, I'm not saying that Albertus Magnus ever
wrote all the things attributed to him; he was far too sound on
nominalism versus realism, universal ideas versus particulars and the
manifold errors of Averroes to lose his head. I haven't finished his
"<i>Summa Theologi&aelig;</i>" yet, but I heard it was grand.</p>

<p>Lord knows the authors of my cook book are not to blame. Mrs.
Fanny L. Gillette was one of the slickest pie wranglers of all time.
She knew her muffins. Her collaborator, Herr Hugo Ziemann, was
nothing less than steward of the White House Itself, in just which
administrations remains in doubt as we rush to press. He was,
moreover, according to the preface, "at one time caterer for that
Prince Napoleon who was killed fighting the Zulus in Africa"; though
where all these Zulus come in I can't see. He also reigned at the
Hotel Splendide in Paris, at the Brunswick Cafe in New York and at
the Hotel Richelieu in Chicago when Chicago was a wide open town, I
mean wide open; 'twas at the Richelieu he laid "the famous spread to
which the chiefs of the warring factions of the Republican Convention
sat down in June, 1888, and from which they arose with asperities
softened, differences harmonized and victory organized," in fact,
everything hotsy-totsy until next morning. I give these statistics in
simple justice; those desiring further proof will find Hugo's picture
on page forty-three, together with a view of the White House kitchen,
not inelegantly equipped with one dozen tin pans, one medium dipper,
a rolling pin, a nutmeg grater and a regular Jones's Island coffee
grinder.</p>

<p>The hitch occurred when Mrs. Gillette and Herr Hugo began
ministering to a hermit. They wrote at a time when housekeepers
automatically dropped three dozen eggs and two quarts of double cream
into each recipe as a mere starter, and for a clientele that seems to
have lived over a department store in the middle of a dairy farm and
truck garden. A hermit who seeks to emulate these fortunate cooks
will find himself at the last moment with large quantities of staple
groceries completely wrecked, an immediate need for twenty-six other
ingredients which grow only in Park and Tilford's front window, and a
wistful longing for a pinch of something known only to Theodore of
the Ritz and a few of his trusted confidants.</p>

<p>You still think it isn't in nature to be so dumb about a cook
book? Well, I'll tell you. Tradition hath it that the good fairies
who presided over a certain hermit's birth away back in the past
forgot all about dowering him with the Order of the Skillet. It
completely slipped their minds. Observing which, a rather dissipated
but kindly old hamadryad who was skulking about the place waved her
wand and cackled shrilly, "He'll never be able to cook, but he'll eat
practically anything." The ancient prophecy has come true, and then
some; to this day I couldn't tell a ramekin from a lambkin if I were
to swing. I do wish that old hamadryad had thought up something
snappier, such as the magic gift of baking my own gingerbread instead
of the talent for gulping it by the acre about once every three
years. She is the direful spring of all my troubles. All her fault
the morbid yearning for strawberry shortcake which, much as I
struggle against it, runs like a minor strain or a boll-weevil
through my written works. Thence the Russian pity, the
<i>Weltschmerz</i>, the wondering betimes whether, after all, Santa
Claus isn't just a solar myth.</p>

<p>So my cooking is nothing to brag of. My humble efforts aim not so
much at the creation of new, novel and startling effects as at
stirring up a pot of mush; I aspire no longer to achieve the
ineffable, but to avoid the utterly inedible. The net result is full
of good intentions, some have even called it grub. I have but one
lasting regret: that I have furnished certain stuck-ups with evidence
that the American cuisine, as they go about raving, is punk. Does
that give visiting wise-crackers leave to remark, "What's one man's
poison is chocolate blanc mange <i>&agrave; la Cuppy</i>?" Is it
polite and seemly for my company from the city to spend their time
guessing whether my fritters are animal, vegetable or mineral?</p>

<p>I have saved for a final word the main secret of me and my cook
book. Read and ponder, hermits, but don't go shouting it out for all
to hear. Go ahead and enjoy the esoteric pleasure I shall share with
you, but remember that for less, far less, some very nice people have
been lured into red brick institutions and accommodated in rooms with
cushioned walls&mdash;because, forsooth, they were a little
different! There's a way of thinking about your three squares. Buy a
cook book that contains, like mine, meals for every day in the year,
all nicely cooked and arranged and everything. When your cuckoo clock
strikes the hour, turn to the proper page, loosen your belt and
peruse. You'll be surprised at the added zest to hermiting. The habit
will grow on you; you'll find, as time goes on that you can't do
without it. Go to it, but mum's the word if you see one of those
mental specialists around; he's sure to go talking about the flight
from reality and regression to second childhood and acute anaphylaxis
and the like of that. What do those birds know about reality? They
think that reality is anything that's no fun.</p>

<p>To-day my cook book luncheon consisted of scrambled mutton, Welsh
rabbit, olives, hominy croquettes, currant jelly, molasses cup cake
and chocolate. To-night I dine upon oyster soup, roast loin of pork
with applesauce, boiled sweet potatoes, scalloped onions, stewed
carrots, pickled green peppers, royal sago pudding with sweet sauce,
crullers, fruit, cheese and coffee. Wouldn't I be the fool to sniff
at that?</p>

<p>As I've been working pretty hard, to-morrow I plan to splurge a
bit in time and space. I may go to Mrs. Cleveland's wedding lunch,
though the layout there will be simpler than I'm used
to&mdash;nothing, really, except the snipes on toast and the mottoes
for dessert. I'd take in General Grant's birthday dinner, only it
begins with clams; besides I had squabs yesterday at the menu for six
covers on page 463. The buffet for 1,000 people ought to be worth
while, especially the cold saddle of venison, but maybe I ought to
attend the state dinner at the White House&mdash;their
<i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i> are always splendid, and they offer some
interesting dishes called Haute Sauterne, Amontillado, Rauenthaler
Berg, Ernest Jeroy, Ch&acirc;teau Margause and Clos de Vougeot. No, I
won't, either. I couldn't work afterwards, and besides, the whole
beauty of not being president is that you needn't attend these
tiresome formal banquets. I shall be content with the homey little
family dinner on page 429:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Oysters on Half Shell<br>
Julienne Soup<br>
Baked Pickerel<br>
Roast Turkey      Oyster Stuffing<br>
Mashed Potatoes      Boiled Onions<br>
Baked Winter Squash<br>
Cranberry Sauce      Chicken Pie<br>
Plain Celery      Lobster Salad<br>
Olives      Spiced Currants<br>
English Plum Pudding      Wine Sauce<br>
Mince Pie      Orange Water Ice<br>
Fancy Cakes   Cheese   Fruits<br>
Nuts   Raisins   Confectionery<br>
Coffee<br>
</p>

<p>That will be all for to-morrow excepting baked apples, hominy,
broiled white fish, ham omelette, potatoes <i>&agrave; la
Cr&ecirc;me</i>, Parker House rolls, crullers and toast for
breakfast, and cold roast turkey, Boston oyster pie, celery salad,
baked sweet potatoes, rusks, fruit cake and sliced oranges for
supper. The next day I hope to spend quietly at home, perhaps in the
bedroom, reading the pages on barley water, weak oatmeal gruel,
arrowroot porridge, molasses posset, boneset tea and Grandmother's
Universal Liniment.</p>

<h3><a name="WHAT_CABBAGE_HAS_MEANT_TO_ME" id=
"WHAT_CABBAGE_HAS_MEANT_TO_ME"></a>WHAT CABBAGE HAS MEANT TO ME</h3>

<p>They kid me a lot about my cabbage. I take it raw, in rather large
and unusual quantities. Just the other day some joker sent me a home
talent painting of a head of cabbage with Russian dressing and blue
eyes&mdash;a darned good likeness, too, though the nose was insulting
and my ears don't flap that way. Let them have their fun. I love
cabbage, and I don't mean kohl-rabi.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed of my passion for cabbage. I know and the cabbage
knows there is nothing in our relations which may not with the
strictest propriety go on between a God-fearing hermit and a green
vegetable. If at times our close companionship seems to stray outside
the bounds of the completely abstract&mdash;well, my good gosh, we're
made like that, aren't we? Yet I've heard talk. Rumor has made much
more than was necessary out of the fact that I slept with my cabbage
a part of last winter to keep it from freezing; literally to save its
life, not to mention my own. I think that people who find food for
gossip in that must have a strong tendency that way themselves. It
shows what <i>their</i> minds run on! Besides, it isn't as if I was
alone with the cabbage. There were plenty of potatoes in the same
bedroom.</p>

<p>Cabbage is one of my hobbies, and I can't see why it is not just
as respectable as chasing butterflies, raising Belgian hares,
carrying a cane or piscatology in general; we need not speak of chess
and philately, as I have no wish to hurt any one's feelings. Green
vegetables are fashionable, too, and even a hermit has to keep in the
swim. I probably chose cabbage because it lasts longer than most and
is less sensitive to the violent changes in temperature on Jones's
Island. Mine is no blind and deaf infatuation, for I can see the
charm of the others. They are hard to get, however, and you can't go
sleeping with a bedful of lettuce, beet leaves and turnip-tops half
the time. I haven't come to that yet.</p>

<p>Indeed, I hope to branch out next winter with more or less fresh
things that won't stay the night. One of the men on the steam dredge
has volunteered to be my endive bearer, and Rattlesnake Ned will act
as tomato messenger when he comes from shore. I'm thinking up a human
chain and relay system that ought to do wonders, and if all goes well
I shall see Great South Bay dotted with swift ice-boats bringing me
this and that. It ought to give me a much more wholesome outlook. You
know a tomato here, a lemon there and so on soon count up.</p>

<p>I maintain that cabbage is worth the money. Not a few housekeepers
disparage it because it happens to be 91.5 per cent water in the raw
state. Why pay out cash for mere moisture, they inquire, especially
if you have to chew it? Because of what they believe to be the high
watery content of cabbage they are inclined to look upon it more as a
beverage. They are blissfully unaware that cauliflower is 92.3 per
cent water and that the official returns on asparagus, celery,
lettuce and cucumbers are 94 per cent, 94.5 per cent, 94.7 per cent
and 95.4 per cent! It would be a good lesson if some professor told
these people who object to the contents of cabbage exactly what
<i>they</i> are made of! I suggest that all housekeepers looking for
something dry take up a diet of cowpeas in a serious way&mdash;they
are only 13 per cent water. If I were mean enough I'd mention
evaporated carrots, perhaps the dryest substance known to science,
only 3.5 per cent water.</p>

<p>Others deprecate our hero on the ground that a pound of it gets
you only 143 calories. Here again one runs into the significant fact
that leeks provide only 125 calories to the pound and raw pumpkin but
117. If mere calories are what you seek in life, why not dried beans
at 1,564 calories? A pound of potato chips will put 2,598 calories
under your belt, the trouble being that a pound of potato chips, when
stowed away, is said to be nineteen and two-thirds times as heavy as
a pound of feathers. If all else fails, a pound of shelled hickory
nuts will turn the trick, for they average 3,238 calories to the
pound. Unfortunately the person who tried to verify this by eating
several pounds at a sitting left no record of his sensations, it all
happened so quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, if you cook your cabbage, all this advice goes for
naught. The watery content, for instance, advances to the ruinous and
really unreasonable mark of 97.4 per cent. Why this is true, if it is
true, I cannot say. Perhaps the mathematicians include the soup in
their calculations. I had supposed that the water would sort of seep
out of the cabbage while boiling, thus accounting for the familiar
clinical picture (limpness), but seems not; apparently part of the
water you pour in seeps into the cabbage; the whole thing is
difficult and complicated, a problem understood in all of its aspects
only by Dr. Albert Einstein and twelve other superior brains here and
there, chiefly the latter.</p>

<p>Other more ghastly evils follow the cooking of cabbage. For one
thing the revolutions of cooked cabbage upon its axis are thirty
times as numerous as those of Welsh rabbit, not to speak of its
simultaneous whizzing around its orbit and the phenomenon of mean
left ascension. Plenty of people have lived through a sight of boiled
cabbage, but don't ask me how. Its effect upon me is approximately
that of equal parts strychnine and prussic acid. Toxicologists and
criminologists would do well to get wise to this side of their
profession, for I am firmly convinced that all this raving of
ratsbane, deadly nightshade, cyanide, dhatura and other subtle Hindu
poisons in so many of our murder trials could be obviated by the
application of a little common sense. The state would be saved a pile
of money and many an innocent victim would escape the chair if only
it were realized that in nine cases out of ten the whole trouble was
due to boiled cabbage. It wasn't arsenic, it was simply cabbage. I
don't care if Apicius, the famous Roman man about town, did cook it.
Apicius was the chap who used to stuff dormice with asafetida and
then eat them to an obbligato of choice Latin phrases; any one who
would do that will bear watching. His cabbage recipe in his "De Re
Culinaria," which he probably did not write, begins: "Take only the
most delicate and tender part of the cabbage, which boil, and then
pour off the water; season it with cummin seed, salt, old wine, oil,
pepper, alisander, mint, rue, coriander seed and gravy." Other things
he might add from time to time were onions, raisins, leeks, flour of
almonds and olives, with perhaps a sprinkling of anise seed, hyssop,
pennyroyal and birdseed; if he had any asafetida handy, that went in,
too. I must admit that he had the right idea about disguising this
powerful food, but, personally, having been practically raised on it,
I've done all for asafetida that I'm ever going to do. In my opinion,
boiled cabbage will never come into its own until our research
experts discover some entirely new principle of ventilation and one
or more disinfectants stronger than formaldehyde.</p>

<p>Later on, having spent a round four million dollars on his
alimentary canal, Apicius committed suicide because he had only half
a million left and was afraid of starving to death. As nobody ever
went bankrupt on cabbage, I assume it was the dormice that ruined
him&mdash;he'd better have stuck to his greens. Despite his example,
I just chop mine into hunks with a knife and sometimes add salt and
vinegar; as yet the technique of coleslaw eludes me, but that may
come in good time.</p>

<p>A correspondent signing herself "Maizie" is obsessed with the
notion that living as I do entirely upon raw cabbage (which I do not)
I must soon find myself practically bedridden and unable to write
book reviews, if not a charge upon the community. Investigation shows
that there is something in what she says, though not much. It is held
in some quarters that cooking one's cabbage helps to rupture the
little starch grains, thus making them more readily digestible, but
out here at Jones's if the little starch grains remain unruptured,
that's their hard luck. My time is worth money, or would be if I
could get it to do. If I had any to spare I'd rid up the kitchen, buy
an encyclop&aelig;dia on the instalment plan, read the Sunday papers
and write a play; then I'd consider rupturing the starch grains.</p>

<p>"You'll be champing raw turnips next," submits the fair unknown.
You flatter me, Maizie, I invented that sport. And, by the by, I wish
some of my dietetic colleagues would stop talking about chopped
swedes, escalloped swedes, shredded swedes, swedes <i>au gratin</i>
and so forth. It makes me nervous. If they mean rutabagas, why not
say so; better still, why not work off their sadistic impulses on
mangel-wurzels? I don't care what happens to mangel-wurzels, but any
reference to French fried swedes never fails to give me a turn. If
there is a time and place for such, it's in a detective story, not a
cook book. No, Maizie, I'm not a vegetarian. I have nothing against
meat, as such. If I dwelt on the mainland, next a butcher shop, my
life would probably be one long, delirious symphony of Hamburger
rare; as it is, a carbohydrate in the system is worth two proteids
across the bay.</p>

<p>Doctors have always depended upon this wonderful plant in
emergencies, so much that they often exclaim, "When in doubt,
cabbage!" This remedy was used by Hippocrates upon his wealthiest
patients, sharing equal honors with such items as asphodel, bryony,
henbane, hellebore, squills, poppy and mandragora, and with most
felicitous results upon the blood, the phlegm, the bile and the black
bile; the fact that Hippocrates thought the earth was flat is neither
here nor there. Cabbage shed a trifle of its prestige as a panacea
when Asclepiades invented the Doctrine of Solids, as opposed to the
Doctrine of Fluids, or Humors, but what it lost there it gained on
the roundabouts. Dioscorides, private physician to Antony and
Cleopatra, invariably succeeded with cabbage when petrified toads
failed to do the work.</p>

<p>A few of the younger Greeks believed that this herb had an
unfortunate effect upon the cerebrum, resulting in an acute form of
hedonism; it is too late now to find out whether it was that or
something else. Possibly a long continued and exclusive diet of
cabbage might in time weaken the normal brain, but it is doubtful
whether a normal brain would be caught in that galley. At any rate,
Pythagoras urged cabbage upon his friends and enemies, and Cato the
Elder is said to have regarded it as a certain cure for the plague,
the quinsy and chronic blindstaggers. Of late it has proved its worth
in stubborn cases of hordeolum, or congenital baldness (<i>Alopecia
congenitalia</i>), where the child is born without hair, isn't that
killing?</p>

<p>Among the ancient Chaldeans, Assyrians and Babylonians cabbage was
held in high esteem, providing as it did a welcome change from the
eternal barley, millet, sesame, locusts and wild honey. You all know
the anecdote about King Sennacherib of Assyria and what it says in
the Code of Hammurabi, while King Nebuchadnezzar's fondness for
greens was notorious throughout Babylon, indeed, throughout
Mesopotamia; it was Belshazzar, however, who spilled the beans. The
Egyptians fell into line, for all the popular fallacy that they ate
only lepidotus, nefareh, sagbosa, lotus and papyrus. To become
convinced of this one has but to study carefully the hieroglyphs of
the falcon Horus, the dog Anubis and the ibis Thoth.</p>

<p>Prominent Egyptians whose names I associate with cabbage include
Queen Hatshepsut of the XVIIIth dynasty, who got such a bad break;
Khufu, or Cheops, who built the Great Pyramid, and Prince Ptah-hotpe
of the Cairo Ptah-hotpes. But my main exhibit is Amenhotep IV,
otherwise Akhnaton, a veritable slave to the stuff; a rather
fascinating personality, though something of an impractical dreamer.
Full of piety, good works and misfortune he was always munching a
handful of you know what and thinking beautiful thoughts while the
Hittites sneaked up on him from behind. It is a strange fact that
cabbage addicts are mostly of the visionary type and cursed with more
than their share of hard luck. They bear it all with Christian
fortitude. When they see a lot of dumbbells running loose, impressing
magazine editors and making heaps of money, they just smile tenderly
and murmur, "Heaven bless those dumbbells. God is love and the
editors are right. Who am I? Nobody!" They act that way even when
their rivals are obviously swinging from branch to branch by their
tails.</p>

<p>Naturally, Akhnaton was partly to blame for his troubles, though I
can't see just where the catch was. Josephus tells us that he was
very homely, maybe that was it. Interested as he was in the serious
problems, he never did find out what it was all about. I think his
mind lacked a certain fundamental sanity; some of his contemporaries
did not hesitate to hint as much. He was obviously neurotic, and must
have been an awful strain on his wife, Queen Nefertiti the One-eyed,
she that was the daughter of Ay and Ty and sister to Mutnothem, who
married Harmhabi. You may recall that Akhnaton and Nefertiti had
seven daughters; one of them, Enkhsenpeaton, got married to
Tutankhamen. The other girls did well for themselves, too, which
ought to stop the rumor that cabbage is a vulgar vegetable&mdash;for
that matter, it never pretended to be a calla lily. Moreover, there
is evidence all about us that plenty of cabbage came over in the
Mayflower.</p>

<p>How did Akhnaton get that way? How did I? Well, I suppose that I
incline my thoughts towards cabbage for the same reason that Immanuel
Kant kept harping on the categorical imperative and that Bishop
Berkeley made such an object of himself, and object is putting it
mildly; in all these cases the answer is infantile fixations, with
me, mother's coleslaw. We would come at cabbage differently, that's
all. If I understand Bishop Berkeley, he held that cabbage was mostly
in his own head, or at any rate, that its being consisted entirely in
being perceived; or, if that isn't plain enough, that its <i>esse</i>
was <i>percipe</i>. Kant, on the other hand, insisted that it was a
<i>Ding an Sich</i>. At Jones's it's just cabbage and glad to get it.
It stays by you, and that's a lot these days.</p>

<h3><a name="NEXT_TO_GODLINESS" id="NEXT_TO_GODLINESS"></a>NEXT TO
GODLINESS</h3>

<p>In the spring a housewife's fancy&mdash;if she has any
left&mdash;lightly turns to you know what. House-cleaning! Magic
word! At the very thought existence takes on a rosier hue and one
feels rich, indeed, in the blessings of love and all the finer things
of the spirit. One night the housewife retires as usual. Comes the
dawn, lightly she leaps forth, caroling, "Oh, goody, goody! Spring,
the season of housecleaning, is here! How good to be alive! How
wonderful that I am a housewife with a dirty house to clean from
cellar to attic. Hooray! Hooray!! Hooray!!!"</p>

<p>A few take it harder. Here and there a housewife will merely roll
over and mutter, "Spring has come! To hell with it!" To such the
vernal equinox is only a pain in the neck, and they don't care who
knows it. Hermits are the same way. The average hermit requires only
about two minutes to decide that last year's housecleaning is good
for another twelve months. And the pity is that most hermits' shacks
could very well do with a dusting, if not a thorough coat of
whitewash inside and out.</p>

<p>My own bungalow is much more vast in extent, and my housekeeping
problems therefore considerably larger, than most people seem to
realize. All the talk about my tiny shanty must have started when I
told one of those New York interviewers that my shack measured 20 by
20 feet, as, in fact, it does; I may state that he wasn't
interviewing me at the time&mdash;we just happened to be lunching at
the same counter on one of my trips to the city. I see what must have
occurred. This chap repeated to somebody else the dimensions of my
four-room domicile, and it got around that since the whole thing
measured 20 by 20 feet, each of the four rooms must measure 5 by 5
feet. Ask somebody to figure it, and listen.</p>

<p>Now I'm not going to argue. Any one who is willing to concentrate,
brush up on arithmetic, call in the neighbors, draw a few diagrams or
come out to Jones's Island with a footrule will eventually find that
each room, supposing they were all the same shape, would measure 10
by 10 feet. Nevertheless, either because the calculators stopped
school in the third grade for obvious reasons or because the talent
for simple subtraction has died out in this country, I still get
letters from sympathetic housewives telling me how to be efficient in
5 by 5 rooms. It can't be done. One of my correspondents has gathered
that the shack itself is a 5 by 5 affair and that each room is
1&frac14; by 1&frac14; feet&mdash;another glaring example of
confusing the participle with the gerundive. Next thing they'll have
me down a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>What I'm getting at is that I have all of 400 square feet of floor
space to be spotlessly cleaned each year, let alone the other spring
ceremonies. Many words have been wasted on this subject by people who
do not seem to know that I own the largest private collection of
soaps, washing powders, spot removers, magic scourers and scrubbing
brushes in our part of the ocean. And when the proper spring arrives,
I shall put them to good use. I do not want to assume an air of
conscious merit, but whenever I look at my cleaning things I feel a
little thrill of satisfaction at the thought that my home would be as
spick and span as any one's if only it had the proper care. And so
help me, I'll do it yet, if I ever find the time. Last spring I did
sweep&mdash;tons! But what the place needs is an utterly ruthless
steam shovel in the prime of life, or a savage wrecking crew that has
been fed on raw meat, or both.</p>

<p>What I want to make clear is that I'm really a soap-and-water
hermit; but somehow, with one thing and another, I can't seem to
prove it. Life is difficult enough for any homemaker, but remember
that a book reviewing hermit on an island has to do&mdash;or ought to
do&mdash;single handed, in the few moments allowed him at recess,
what the whole of civilization, working in shifts on a twenty-four
hour schedule for some &aelig;ons now, has but imperfectly achieved,
that is to say keep house. Well I know that the price of cleanliness
is eternal vigilance, and even then people will talk&mdash;ask,
maybe, whether you are sure you washed behind the pump. Anyway, I
have one dear friend in New York who knows of my veritable passion
for chasing spots. She's always sending me presents of soap&mdash;and
I'd call that good, wholesome romance.</p>

<p>I wash, too, whatever people may say. Summer colonists who
complain that they never see any washing on my line are unaware of my
indoor drying system&mdash;a little trick I learned from none other
than Abigail Adams. My own East Room is always gay with shirts,
socks, red bandannas, blue pants and what, if memory serves, used to
be pure white towels&mdash;I haven't been firm enough with those
towels. And I can prove by visitors that I always have three buckets
of wash going, as has every hermit worthy of the name. I don't make a
lot of useless fuss with ammonia, borax, bluing and boiling, but the
good work goes on just the same. I simply soak, wring, hang and
repeat, though I have nothing against hermits with washing-mania who
devote every Monday to its traditional use. It's a good, clean mania,
unless carried to excess. Of course I wash, as everybody ought to
know from my family motto, "Lux et Rinso!"</p>

<p>My windows are something else again. Whoever built my house was an
ardent advocate of those windows with twelve little panes of glass in
each, and how he managed to get six windows into one small shack
beats me. That makes seventy-two panes, all rattling at once. "They
must be awfully hard to keep clean," a lady once observed, and I
often wonder if she wasn't kidding me. It was the first time that
aspect of the subject had occurred to your humble hermit. They must
be, indeed. I must leave my readers to decide for themselves how I
solve this part of my housecleaning problem.</p>

<p>Though the spring riot seldom hits Jones's Island head on, I am
far from lacking a certain academic interest in the phenomenon. I
reviewed a book on the subject here lately, and I must say the author
made cleanliness sound very attractive. Take her cleaning closet
<i>de luxe</i>, a dujingus made of white enameled steel, which may be
obtained in varying sizes, priced from $60 to $495,000. It has flush
construction, well-fitting doors, hardware of the finest quality,
nickeled hooks and adjustable shelves re-introducing the central
motif of enameled steel. And what is supposed to be kept in this
elegant, sanitary object? The family jewels? No, just mops and such,
including suction cleaners, brushes and brooms in vast array, carpet
sweepers, mop wringers, cleaning baskets, dusters, cleaning cloths,
chamois doilies, window cleaners, tongs, floor waxers, stepladders,
scrap baskets, soaps, liquid polishes and eyebrow-curlers.</p>

<p>This is truly a far cry from the yellow soap, ragbag and woodshed
method prevailing at Jones's Island. I'm afraid that if I owned that
closet <i>de luxe</i> I should be tempted to use it as a library and
reception room, leaving the dustrags to their fate. One realizes,
however, that times are changing. The old mop is not what it used to
be. The very pot scourers are demanding a more refined environment
and shorter hours. Personally, I'm old-fashioned. I like a mop to
keep its place, but at the same time I must try to compromise with
the age. Let's be pals with our mops, instead of tyrants. Only thus
shall we arrive at a fuller understanding.</p>

<p>That book taught me a lot of other things, too, that you'll never
learn in college. The author recommends a circular motion for
scouring unfinished wood, prefers the overlapping stroke for dusting
ceilings and mentions favorably a correspondent's plea for the
upward, instead of the downward, brushing of side walls. One who has
suffered makes bold to add that even the downward kind of brushing,
with all its many faults, is immensely preferable to the deadly side
to side stroke employed by some wall brushers&mdash;and the
Australian crawl is even worse. The chapter on sweeping was also a
revelation to a certain bachelor who has always employed the Kansas
cyclone method of removing debris, as was the kitchen section, though
when the author speaks casually of the thrice a day cleaning of the
sink she is out of my depth. This seems to border dangerously on
fanaticism. On the other hand, how timely is her warning against
chipping ice in the sink. Who hasn't seen a perfectly swell sink
started on the downward path by a thoughtless blow from an ice pick
in the clutch of some charming little woman who wasn't quite herself
at the time?</p>

<p>Although many other esoteric problems demand research and
exposition (by more experienced hands and fancier pens), I must
content myself with a concluding word on feather catching, an art
much neglected in our day but of prime importance to any one who owns
a feather bed, or even a pillow. Countless thousands will bear me out
in my statement that one never knows what real excitement is until
the feather bed bursts while being turned, beaten or let severely
alone. When this happens one gets, of course, a certain amount of
transient fun pretending that one is playing the snow scene from "The
Two Orphans," but just as surely one finally decides that it cannot
and must not go on forever. Something must be done, yet how few
housekeepers, when called upon to sweep up a few bushels of feathers
which have run amuck, have the faintest notion of what to do beyond
yelling for the police?</p>

<p>Successful feather catchers are not born, but made in the give and
take of actual experience, tried and tempered in the school of hard
knocks, and life has taught them to beware of insensate violence in
their chosen field. Probably the only means that would instantly
quell an uprising of vigorous, adolescent goose feathers would be a
surprise barrage of buckshot or a combined attack of several fire
departments, but time has proved both these techniques unwise. Nor
can rampaging feathers on holiday be intimidated by wild leapings and
cavortings with a broom and dustpan, since for pure impudence,
irresponsibility and malicious gayety they are equaled among
so-called inanimate objects only by golf balls and collar buttons.
When you fly aft in a fine frenzy of misguided confidence, they sail
gracefully for'ard, and there you are. And there <i>they</i> are, I
might even say.</p>

<p>Don't lose your head. Keep cool, and when the dam things appear to
have forgotten all about you, advance slowly upon them with
outstretched wet newspapers, enfold them gently and they'll never
know what hit them, in case you did bag a few. And the moral of that
probably is that feathers, in their way, are a symbol of this our
mortal life, which is always breaking out in some other direction the
minute you think it's all set. Anyway, once the feathers got loose,
the problem of exercise in the home is solved for the next week or
so.</p>

<h3><a name="IF_CHRISTMAS_COMES" id="IF_CHRISTMAS_COMES"></a>IF
CHRISTMAS COMES</h3>

<p>Here it is almost Christmas, and not even a list made out yet. No,
that's hardly true. I did prepare my usual schedule of the presents I
want, but I'm not going to send it around&mdash;and you can be the
judge who's to blame for it all. It looks very very much as though
there would be an empty sock in a certain hermit's shanty this
Yuletide, and just when I was trying for a banner year!</p>

<p>Maybe I tried too hard. Anyway, all it got me to go flinging gifts
right, left and sideways most of last spring and summer and part of
this fall was the name of angling for return parcels this Christmas,
an aspersion the more unfortunate in that I already had a slight
reputation as a hinter&mdash;though I don't call it hinting to tell
people to whom I have been properly introduced that I am fond of blue
neckties. I repeat that I am fond of blue neckties, and blue neckties
I will have, one way or the other.</p>

<p>Those heavy suitcases, huge cardboard boxes and mysterious
packages wrapped in old newspapers which I kept lugging ashore all
year were presents to friends in New York, that much is perfectly
true. For these same friends I risked chronic lumbago and permanently
weakened the rowing muscles of Portygee Pete. For them I weathered a
blizzard, two cloudbursts and several fights with Long Island railway
conductors who tried to put me in the baggage car. At the cost of a
pretty penny, as pennies go at Jones's Island, I employed every means
of efficient distribution of presents known to modern science, short
of calling out Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen, only to
discover&mdash;with Christmas at my very door!&mdash;that my friends
weren't much thrilled, if at all, by those boatloads of beach pebbles
I took them. No matter how I found out. I can put two and two
together when I am notified by a lot of people upon whom I have been
lavishing beach pebbles that they have just started on a trip around
the world and will be gone quite some time.</p>

<p>Well, I accomplished one thing. I did bring on a sudden and
sensational epidemic of Chinese lilies in dozens of homes where all
they had ever known about botany was a pot of verbenas. These verbena
fans were particularly hard to manage; there seems to be something
about that unassuming little plant that makes housewives positively
stubborn, or perhaps the verbenas are the effect rather than the
cause. Yet I beat down all opposition, terrorized the cowering
verbenas and saw to it that those housewives had Chinese lilies,
willy-nilly; since, after all, about the only thing you can do with a
large consignment of pebbles, after the goldfish bowl is full and the
children have taken their pick, is to put them in a shallow bowl and
go buy a bulb. And when my generosity was at its height, it took a
lot of bulbs to come out even. It was fun while it lasted, but I
might have known there was bound to be a reaction. I suppose they got
to thinking how they had neglected the verbenas; or perhaps they
decided the pebbles were not so hot, anyway, even if the Chinese lily
had bloomed&mdash;life is like that.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Jones's Island pebbles are only small stones, not
very expertly colored. Yet, on their native beach, as the Atlantic
surf swirls coolly over them, they are translucent, opaline,
iridescent and all that sort of thing. The pity is that in captivity
they lose much of their wild, free spirit. A pebble on the seashore
is really a wonderful phenomenon, but a pebble in a rolled oats
container looks like nothing so much as a pebble in a rolled oats
container. By the time it gets to town it is utterly disillusioned.
It has lost its joy of living and most of its looks&mdash;all the
more reason, say I, to give it a helping hand, a warm, old-fashioned
welcome in the home and some assurance of a better and brighter
to-morrow in a shallow bowl with a bulb. Mere outward beauty isn't
everything, though I must admit it's a great deal.</p>

<p>Then look what happened to the tons of bayberries I gave away, not
to mention the stone paper weights, the empty quart bottles suitable
for lamps and candlesticks, the little glass jugs to be used as
vinegar cruets and the skimmer shells for the kiddies. I expected the
bayberries to make more of a hit, seems like they used to. With all
their faults I love bayberries. The gray, waxen pellets, when denuded
of their leafage, make delightful decorations and will last forever
if you are careful to glue, sew or tack each berry to the stem;
otherwise you will put in a lot of time sweeping them up. The
blighted specimens, of course, are not so pretty, and many persons
object to the little red worms that come with them. So my bayberry
clients have started around the world, too. They seem to have
forgotten that I never gave them any umbrella stands full of pampas
grass!</p>

<p>Whatever happens Christmas morning&mdash;and I'll be up at
dawn&mdash;my conscience is clear. My motives were good, as motives
go; if I happened to think of Christmas once or twice while
delivering my beach products, it was in a perfectly nice way and not
what they say. I hold no malice. I make no secret of the fact that I
love my friends and should like something to remember them by, and if
they see eye to eye with me on this proposition, I can do nothing to
prevent them. I'll even include the ones who called me a hinter
trying to acquire Christmas merit and blue neckties by unloading
useless Jones's Island junk all over their rugs. All I want this
year, though, is for my friends ashore to have a gorgeous time and
give marvelous presents to each other and never think of the lonely
hermit in his hut. In this connection I am reminded of a favorite
quotation from Wordsworth, immortalized by Mr. Bartlett:</p>

<p class="poem">"Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the
lore<br>
Of nicely calculated less or more."</p>

<p>Good old Wordsworth!</p>

<p>Although I am not officially releasing my list this year, I may
state in a general way that hermits as a class, or sub-species, are
not very particular what they get for Christmas, so long as it's
something. One hermit, whose identity must not be disclosed, is
always tickled to receive shoes in fairly good condition, sizes
8&frac12; to 10, inclusive; dungarees, 34 waist; chest, unexpanded,
38 inches; height, 5 feet 10&frac12; inches; blue eyes and mild
disposition unless riled. He's on the prowl all the year round, and
nothing makes his eyes glisten with sheer mischief like diverting
from its proper source a missionary box intended for the Patagonians,
the Uap Islanders, the Binbinga of Northern Australia or the Wagogo
of East Africa, unless it's obtaining access to a barrel of odds and
ends addressed to some community stricken by flood, earthquake or
famine&mdash;he's forever asking people if they have heard of an
earthquake lately and who is going to send a box.</p>

<p>Since it happens to be extremely fashionable this season to
provide for hermits, I will add that presents need not be confined to
cut flowers, sheet music and picture postcards of Anne Hathaway's
cottage. Why not a beribboned carton of peanut brittle or a gayly
painted tin of glac&eacute;d prunes, both acceptable combinations of
art and nourishment and much more tactful than a great crate of bread
and butter. A safe rule to go by is that hermits need about two of
everything, and if I were rich I'd see that they got it. So far I
have received but one Christmas present from a millionaire. It came
in a grand envelope that must have cost a quarter all by itself, and
when I opened it, out popped&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a
wonderful paragraph just bursting with love, best wishes and good
advice. Life is like that, too.</p>

<p>If you truly want to bring a little Yuletide joy into the lives of
others, my friends, see any mail order catalogue. There's one at the
Coast Guard station, and reading it of nights is almost as good as
Christmas itself. I've just gone through it again, and if I lose my
critical reputation I call it the best book of the year and superior
on every count to all but a few of the chosen classics of all time.
It wasn't just thought up by some one who was no brighter than he
should have been. It has a message. And some day, when my ship comes
in, I'm going to write to the author and tell him to rush me one of
each. It will cut into the principal and sort of crowd the shack, but
it will be, I flatter myself, a magnificent gesture.</p>

<p>I've given the matter quite a bit of thought, and about the only
things in our catalogue that I can get along without are ageratum
seeds, pickle forks, wind chimes, cuckoo clocks, bee traps, hot air
accelerators, artificial boutonni&egrave;res, imported hand-painted
cookie dishes, chin rests for playing the violin, bird remedies,
cream separators, sheep dip, asthma relief, air ferns and coin
purses. I can't decide about the genuine leather adjustable horse
collars for expressing and teaming, and the high quality, waterproof
fly nets with straps to buckle around the hames. They're worth
considering, but first I want to go thoroughly into the whole subject
of hames.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christmas is coming! And I, for one, shall be on my
best behavior until the last returns are in. I suspect that a great
many people are secretly rejoicing in the fact that pebbles and
bayberries are out of season. But who knows what a hermit may do when
the Yuletide spirit seizes him like a frenzy and the joy of giving
rouses all that is worst in his nature? I still have a few pebbles
left. I wonder!</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="THE_FEAST_OF_THE_BEAN" id=
"THE_FEAST_OF_THE_BEAN"></a>THE FEAST OF THE BEAN</h3>

<p>History has recorded many famous banquets. Herodotus tells us, I
forget just what; but certainly there have been plenty of important
feeds&mdash;Herodotus was nothing but an old liar, anyway. I know for
a fact, and can prove by witnesses, that there recently occurred a
pretty large and vociferous dinner party at Jones's Island, and that
those present, including myself, some of the hungrier Coast Guards
and a couple of visiting hermits from the Eastern marshes, fairly
groaned with viands. The repast was spread at and practically all
over my shack, and a good time was had, if I do say it. I cooked it
myself and didn't lose a guest.</p>

<p>All persons from the mainland were barred by a rising vote of the
tribe. We had a rank outsider at our last affair&mdash;a humorist
from New York&mdash;and everything struck him as funny. He made
several unnecessary remarks about the food, such as, "Well, you don't
go till your time comes!" and kept calling, "Come on in, Lucrezia!"
and making other cracks about slow poison. He even looked up the list
of antidotes on the back of my cook book. He got away.</p>

<p>That and similar experiences have shown the wisdom of admitting no
critical and, for all we know, cultured aliens to the Feast of the
Bean. I am afraid we of Jones's are not always careful to observe the
delicate line, if any, which differentiates the truly fastidious
gourmet from the Motumotu of New Guinea. The whole point of the orgy
is quantity or bulk of intake, and individual success depends largely
upon the fine art of grabbing, which not infrequently brings out some
notable feats of strength and agility rather dangerous to those of
frail physique. Sometimes we forget to eat as though we hated it.</p>

<p>I came through the ordeal all right by sticking closely to the
rather rigid ceremonial prescribed for the Feast of the Bean.
Tradition requires the host, at the appointed hour, to seize the
communal megaphone, expand his chest and yell repeatedly, "All hot!
All hot!" adding, perhaps, by way of sentiment, "Come and get it!"
Invited guests and others within earshot invariably flock in at the
rate of ten seconds flat to each hundred yards, whereupon the host
points silently to the festive oilcloth in sign of good faith, waves
each comer to his chair or its equivalent and puts everybody at his
ease with the welcome words, "Eat hearty, boys, and give the ship a
good name!" By that time the soup is about gone.</p>

<p>The soup was not clam chowder, for it is a point of honor among
beachites to omit that grand but provincial dish sometimes, just for
a change, particularly upon extraordinary occasions such as the
return from the hunt, hauling in the catch, a tribal wedding or the
Feast of the Bean. One can always serve clam chowder, but it is not
every host who provides consomm&eacute; froid, consomm&eacute; Du
Barry, potage <i>&agrave; la Bellevue</i>, or split pea, any one of
which may be prepared by the initiates in about a day and a half,
excepting Barsch with Ushka, the Polish national sport, which takes
two weeks without counting the Ushka, and generally involves a score
of assistants and social ostracism. If I said we had any of these I'd
be fibbing like two hermits. I can make soup, if I have to, I'll say
that. In my day I have thought up some highly unusual ones, so much
so that many a visitor has exclaimed, "What a soup!" and turned my
first course into a guessing game. They have guessed ectoplasm,
beaver-board, paranoia and manic-depressive without a single
bull's-eye; ten to one it was only left-overs&mdash;no trouble at
all, but it takes a knack. This time it was canned tomato.</p>

<p>Nor shall I apologize for dealing a patent brand of soup. When
all's said, I can't help thinking that those fellows in the factory,
who make it a life work, have hit upon a richer mixture than any poor
efforts of mine have achieved to date. As for the manual labor, you
never know what real, solid comfort is until you quit bucking the
soup trust. Mental agony you are spared as well, since people no
longer ask you, with sincere concern, whether you have lost your
sense of taste or smell, or both. Everybody's happy. Is this
spineless compromise? Is this weakly giving in to life? No, in most
cases it's just common decency. You may feel that your party's a
success when your guests, as mine did, demand at least three
helpings&mdash;after that, anything goes. Thank goodness for canned
soup!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the beans were swell. They had to be, for immemorial
custom decrees that they must oblige as fish, entr&eacute;e, roast,
salad, and sometimes dessert. Nothing is said in the by-laws about
<i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i>, and I spent many an anxious moment
wondering whether to stage some such course; reason prevailed, and I
didn't. A literary correspondent whose help I enlisted, suggested,
"Why not <i>escargots &agrave; la Bourguignonne?</i>" I simply
replied by return mail, "Not in <i>my</i> house!" Her next message,
reading "Since when?" failed to alter my decision. For a while I
considered Bologna, but my enthusiasm dwindled. By and large, the
wursts leave me cold. And pickled beet relish drives me crazy
mad.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to exercise restraint when I think of the
misguided people whose <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres,</i> day after day,
year after weary year, consist of what?&mdash;pickled beets. I dare
say that pickled beets, with their deadly, soul-sapping monotony,
have torn more fond hearts asunder, broken up more happy homes and
caused more crimes of passion than any other three vegetables chosen
at random. Picture to yourself the young artisan returning from the
foundry fairly sober, kissing his happy bride and inquiring with a
light laugh, "What have we for <i>hors-d'&oelig;uvres</i> this
evening, sweet?" "Same old thing, pickled beets!" says she. "Fine!"
exclaims the illuded youth, vouchsafed as yet no prevision of the
tragedy that is to stalk in after years. If only they had realized!
But they never did (not being very bright, anyway) until they met as
strangers in the bread-line during a blinding snowstorm, pathetic
victims of ten thousand portions of pickled beet relish with all its
brood of quarrels, flatirons and bricks. Better, far better, if they
had done without <i>hors-d'[oeu]vres</i> altogether. I could furnish
more frightful examples by the dozen, now that I have already ruined
my plot with this one. Yet how often to-day we hear the <i>cri du
c&oelig;ur</i> from victim after victim of the pickled beet, "My God,
I've married a moron!"</p>

<p>Beets in any form are, strictly speaking, a food for the rougher
sort of cow. Their one merit from the human point of view is that
alcohol may be extracted from them, and a few delightful housewives
have the secret of coloring pickled eggs with their aid. The main
trouble is that beets contain 85 per cent of concrete. I once boiled
a couple of them during an entire afternoon without the slightest
result&mdash;if anything, they seemed to get harder. Turn, gouge and
glare at them as I would, not one' single gleam of intelligence could
I get from those beets. In the evening I forked them again, but they
had apparently made up their minds to be stubborn, and my own blood
was up, too (<i>cf</i>. the old folk-saying, "As stubborn as a
beet"). Finally I forgot the water and they were left high and dry. I
have always felt that the joke was on them. I must confess that I am
against beet soup, too, especially cold. Cold beet soup always gives
me the decided impression that life is just a grim joke of the gods,
and adding sour cream to it doesn't help much. The fact that the
people who put sour cream in cold beet soup are Lithuanians seems a
very flimsy excuse.</p>

<p>To return to the Feast of the Bean, another inflexible law, said
to have been rushed through by Old Zachs of Zachs Inlet himself,
calls for as many beans as a crew of eight surfmen and a skipper can
account for at a single sitting, or, as we of to-day interpret the
ancient ruling, infinity of beans, beans without end, let or
hindrance. Whether the original intention was in this manner to
symbolize the fertility of Nature, the bean producer, or the capacity
of man, the bean eater, will probably never be determined, obscured
as the finer points have been by generations of scribes, yeomen, clam
diggers and hermits. At any rate, beans it is.</p>

<p>And a good thing, too. The bean is all that the beet is not. I
have small patience with people who are always sneering at the bean
and insisting that it caused the Hundred Years' War. A prominent
dietitian recently declared that the common or navy bean contains in
great abundance every element needed to sustain life; he lost his job
the next day, but there may be something in it. He who attacks the
bean is threatening the very existence of the social order, at least
here at Jones's. He is guilty of treason to the spirit of our
American institutions. Such a one must take his chances before the
tribunal of history, unless we catch him first.</p>

<p>Where would we be without the bean? Charles Darwin, the evolution
man, was a rabid vegetarian, a loyal bean fan. George Bernard Shaw
adores beans. William Salt, the eminent antiquarian, Egyptologist and
authority on mummies was inspired to some of his most heroic feats by
beans and beans alone. And what of those great human documents, Magna
Charta and the Declaration of Independence? What about the cotton gin
and the spinning jenny, or is it the other way round? In my opinion
Shakespeare was an out-and-out beanist, though he denied it with some
heat.</p>

<p>So many gifted authors have lavished their eloquence upon baked
bean recipes that my own humble, unassuming one&mdash;requested so
often that I dare no longer refuse&mdash;may come as an anticlimax.
The method with which I have had most success, and remember that I'm
not bragging, goes something like this: First be sure your fire is
burning like sixty and the dampers are properly adjusted for a
strong, steady heat. Have your best bean-pan spotless and gleaming.
Lock every door in the house, then sneak to the pantry, select a
plump, full-grown, nicely rounded can of beans and use your own
judgment. This may shock some of the veterans, but it's a secret
every bride should know, and may also stop the report that hermits
are too lazy to warm up their food. For the Feast of the Bean I used
two large cans to a man, with a dozen extra for possible shrinkage,
and nobody reneged except Portygee Pete, who'd had his five squares
and could cope with a mere can and a half. As usual, Ned won,
claiming a total of three flat. Of course, we had bread, too. We of
Jones's hold the old-fashioned Ptolemaic, or pre-Copernican, view
that white bread made from denatured flour is the staff of life, and
not the rank poison it's supposed to be nowadays. White bread was
good enough for Old Zachs, and he lived to be ninety.</p>

<p>The one awkward moment came at the very end of the meal, for the
rumor of dessert had somehow got abroad; probably one of the boys saw
me pricing plum puddings and imagined I had come into money. I have
never understood why dinner guests so often become violent about the
dessert, when by every rule of physiology they should be reduced to a
state of harmless complaisance and good will towards all. But no,
they seem to get a new lease on life about that time, and are likely
to start a fight at the first glimpse of a baked apple or worse. Like
as not they expected floating island, filled cookies, or even
something as sensational and improbable as a banana split or baked
Alaska, if not the Venus de Milo in Jello. Well, it passed over all
right, but there was a dangerous look in more than one eye when I
produced the coffee ring. Next time I'll certainly invest in those
canned puddings, or see to it that the coffee ring has nuts on the
top&mdash;that seemed to be the main grievance. Rattlesnake Ned, with
his heart of gold, saved the situation by rustling griddle after
griddle of his justly celebrated pancakes, reputed to be the
fillingest this side of Montauk Point. After all, the Coast Guard
marches on its stomach, and some of the guests still had work to do.
Thus was good humor restored and our congenial fellowship spared
anything so vulgar as a free-for-all over a coffee ring.</p>

<p>On the whole, and allowing for the dessert, I knew that my party
had got across. Already the guests, if able, were rising from their
seats with symptoms of that postprandial languor which attests man's
kinship to the boa constrictor. Comanche had that blissful look of
the bayman who has eaten just a little too much, Ned had assumed the
glassy stare with which he always succumbs to the processes of
digestion, osmosis, transmogrification and apotheosis on such
occasions, and the rest were trying their land-legs about the banquet
hall. All was as it should be, for while some epicures love to fancy
that they have heard the rustling of angelic pinions with their
dinner, we like to feel that something has hit us, that we have
something tangible under our belts and that the basal metabolism has
plenty to work on. And that's just what we felt. It was ten o'clock
of a fair frosty night, sea calm, wind Northwest by North, and we
were fed up for another day, or would be after another snack at
bedtime. The Feast of the Bean was over, except for rhubarb and soda
all round, bicarbonate where needed and a spoonful of Jamaica ginger
for Shanghai, the youngest. Shanghai can't stand much.</p>

<h3><a name="IF_YOU_HAVE_TEARS" id="IF_YOU_HAVE_TEARS"></a>IF YOU
HAVE TEARS</h3>

<p>I'm not so sure that I want to be in a sideshow. I have spent
years, you might say, keeping out of one, and I hate to give up the
struggle. Still, it's time I was getting started at something.</p>

<p>I don't mean a regular sideshow in a circus, with good pay and a
chance to lay up a bit for old age. I never get offers like that.
What I mean is&mdash;well, it's a very delicate matter, and I hope my
readers will forgive my mentioning it. The fact is&mdash;and remember
it's none of my doings&mdash;can I help it if certain persons want to
turn my hut into a literary shrine? Of course, it wouldn't be
Stratford-on-Avon; anyway, not right at first. But in time&mdash;</p>

<p>To get at the plot, we must go back to the morning when I first
noticed that peculiar throbbing sensation in my ears. It wasn't
really painful; just a sort of vaguely maddening pulsation only loud
enough to poison the incoming air waves and evoke some pretty low
thoughts without driving a hermit completely nuts&mdash;not unlike a
radio in the distance, except that radios sometimes stop, if the
owner is shot. For a while I thought it must be a mosquito in the
aural vestibule, or maybe in the Eustachian tube&mdash;and why my
Eustachian tubes are not always full of mosquitoes is more than I
know.</p>

<p>Along towards evening, after first aid treatment with hot cylinder
oil, iodine, Sloan's and ten-penny nails, I ruled out the mosquito
and flew to the family doctor book, as I always do when I want a good
scare. And there I read, as the wind howled mournfully outside and
the lightning struck everything but my humble cot, how I had not only
elementary tinnitus, or noises in the ears, but acute otitis media,
with secondary dislocation of the malleus, incus and stapes and
rupture of the main drum (the ten-penny nails did that!), accompanied
by serious disturbance of the endolymph, complete functional
breakdown of the auricle and the pinna and something frightfully
wrong with, of all things, the cochlea&mdash;I never knew I had one!
Well, I was fit to be tied.</p>

<p>Naturally, I took steps and practically everything else in the
medicine chest, nor did I neglect to send up a few heartfelt
petitions to whatever gods there be&mdash;a little habit I have when
I'm sick, right reason or no right reason. All this modern science
served only to intensify the symptoms and bring on complications. I
began seeing things, too; and where I had pains you wouldn't believe.
So I resigned myself to the worst, put my affairs in order and went
ashore to the doctor. And, to make a long story short, he refused to
operate. This was just as well, for the noises turned out to be steam
dredges in the bay.</p>

<p>Yes, steam dredges in the bay, quite a ways off as yet, but
creeping slowly and ever slowly towards my hermitage. And why? You
may well ask.</p>

<p>I have decided to be very nice about these dredges and what they
did to my life. God bless them! They were, and still are, as I pen
these words, engaged in pumping up sand to build a road, with
bridges, across the bay, so that thousands upon thousands of utterly
delightful people can drive their automobiles right out to Jones's
Island and up and down the length of same on a concrete boulevard. As
I live and breathe, a concrete boulevard. For it seems that as a
joint result of recent elections, modern philanthropy and what is
known in my family as the Luck of the Cuppys, Jones's Island is going
to be a State Park.</p>

<p>And God bless whoever thought <i>that</i> up! Now all and sundry
can come right out to my shack and have picnics in my front yard with
their banana peelings, cute little poodles, golden-haired infants
with pop-guns, canned music and firecrackers. God bless <i>them!</i>
To all concerned in this perfectly splendid scheme for bringing a
little sunlight into the lives of the masses and disrupting what is
left of my reason I wish the very best of everything in this great
big beautiful world&mdash;would that they had but one neck. And yet,
my friends, and yet! Was it for this that I&mdash;well, was it for
this?</p>

<p>At first I'm afraid I was selfish about the State Park. I talked
of sinking the dredges, blowing up the bridges, seizing the post
office and murdering the politicians with subtle tortures that would
make Edgar Wallace look sillier. And I didn't mean a word of it.
Through suffering I have come to realize that State Parks, as part of
the glorious march of civilization&mdash;which is to say as part of
the general conspiracy against hermits&mdash;will go on and on, and
I'm through fighting them. I've done all I can against the glorious
march of civilization, and I haven't scratched the surface. I
realize, too, that the poor mainlanders with Fords must have sunlight
and fresh air and a bath and hot dogs, and that the only place they
can get these is Jones's Island, and I'm sorry now that when I first
heard of their dire need I exclaimed, "Why don't they eat cake?" God
bless them again, and that goes double.</p>

<p>That's how I come to be planning a literary shrine for the
multitude, just when I was getting started as a hermit&mdash;with
prospects, too, such as they were. I am not pushing the idea in any
immodest manner. I'm only saying that if it be the will of the
people, if the sovereign state of New York so orders and decrees, I'm
willing to dicker. If, on the other hand, I am requested to move on
to some other beach, and make it snappy, I won't answer for my
neuroses. I'm not the migrating type, and it would be plain hell
taking up with a lot of strange clams. I want to stay, even if I have
to be one of the Zips.</p>

<p>I must admit that my shrine would be the least worthy known to
fame; and perhaps the only one featuring a reviewer of detective
stories. The park officials could ward off criticism on that score by
posting large and conspicuous signs reading, "This Way To The World's
Worst Literary Shrine." I shall insist upon that. My shack doesn't
pretend to be Poe's Cottage or the last resting place of Alice and
Ph&oelig;be Gary, and I shall make no such claim. Still, I see where
they're fitting up a memorial for Henry Thoreau,who lived for two
years by a mere pond up in Massachusetts, and if you ask me, he was
only fair to middling. They have quite a shrine for John Burroughs,
too, the famous peewit chaser of some time back, and what's so noble
about chasing peewits I never could understand. Such facts lead me to
hope that I might get over, on my merits. I'm not woodsy, like
Thoreau and Burroughs, but I can wiggle my ears.</p>

<p>Really, I think my hut is rich enough in literary associations to
make a passable showing, when everything is set out in glass cases,
with labels and dates and things. To the right as you enter would be
my herbarium of rejection slips from some of the leading magazines,
with the actual manuscripts razzed and letters from the editors
explaining in none too guarded terms just why I am not front page
news&mdash;some of them very nice people, but natural-born hermit
haters; also communications from prominent authors and newspaper
readers inquiring why I don't see a cranial surgeon, now that
operations are nothing at all. And, of course, the First Folio,
containing the complete authentic, unexpurgated text of all my books,
namely, "How To Be a Hermit," together with notes by the
commentators, if there should be any.</p>

<p>I'm short on portraits and busts at present, but that's soon
fixed; and I think I'll plant a mulberry tree, just in case. And why
not a small aquarium showing the seven ages of clams from the larval
state to fritters <i>&agrave; la Zachs?</i> Later I'll arrange
parking space for the pilgrims who come in motor cars, wheel chairs
and such; the rest will be a mere matter of a few guides, guards,
interpreters, bouncers and barkers&mdash;that'll be Ned, who was born
with a caul and a carnival.</p>

<p>And speaking of art, isn't there something said of a sixpence at
Stratford Church? If so, I wonder whether it is good form to collect
while one is yet quick? I should certainly feel like a ninny taking
dimes at the door, yet I think it only fair to charge a nominal fee.
Perhaps Ned will relieve me of the sordid details on a commission
basis&mdash;of course, the park officials will get theirs too. Even
at five cents a caller I believe my whole attitude towards visitors
would change for the better. Or would it be more in the spirit of
simple dignity and classic traditions to have a hermit-box for
voluntary contributions? Frankly, I feel that it would not.</p>

<p>There would have to be a candy counter, but one thing I'm going to
be firm about. I'll not have the whole thing cheapened with a lot of
high pressure business. There will be no hot dogs in my shrine.
They'll be outside, with the peanuts, popcorn, soft drinks, souvenir
clam shells, photographs and autographed copies of "How To Be a
Hermit." And while we are on this embarrassing subject of money, I
may as well state that any hero worshipers who appear with offers of
bronze tablets, stained glass windows and illuminated scrolls
attesting my influence upon the decline and fall of American letters
will be given fifty per cent off for the cash. Dividends may be slow
at first, so I think I'll just sit in a corner, reviewing books,
protected by a rope fence and a sign announcing, "Visitors Are
Strictly Forbidden To Prod Or Feed The Hermit." I'm crazy about
peanuts, too, but you've got to keep order. Pilgrims who insist upon
meeting me, strictly for literary purposes, may do so for fifteen
cents extra, two for a quarter.</p>

<p>Of course, if I put on the act, my hut must have a name&mdash;and
not The Cuppy Hole, either. I did call it Villa Mon Repos one season,
but I'd rather have something I can pronounce. Another year I hit
upon Flotsam, and that only kept me explaining, with no very tangible
results, what I had against Jetsam. I rather liked Flotsam, but you
can't be forever explaining the difference between flotsam and
jetsam, with a dictionary that gives you practically no help; and I
may say that I'm in favor of clearing up the matter once for all by
making jetsam the female of flotsam, or vice versa. Anyway, I finally
painted out the Flot and left Sam, which caused even more excitement;
so one day Ned and I took Sam for a ride. That left me with a
prominently displayed sign about Rabbits For Sail, but that was never
the name of the shack, any more than last winter's Steam-Fitting And
Plumbing Done Here&mdash;just boards for patching the porch.</p>

<p>Kind friends have suggested plenty of names, but something is
wrong with them all; and you can parse that to suit yourselves.
Castle Terrabil sounds kind of grand and Arthurian, until you think
it over, and the same is true of Moronia and Dumbbellton Grange.
Bellevue is a nice name, too, but kind of ambiguous.
Tottering-on-the-Brink is good. In fact, it is much too good. You
can't tell me that the race has gone on for millions of years without
thinking that up and using it long ago. If we are reasonable beings
in a reasonable scheme, dozens of hermits, created for that special
purpose, must have lived, suffered, hoped in vain and died unwept in
bungalows named Tottering-on-the-Brink. Otherwise, where are we?</p>

<p>For years and years I tried to think up something of the sort used
by the summer colonists, who run to such hospitable lengths as Dew
Drop Inn, Uneeda-Rest and Dowantogawa. I dallied with Keepa-Going,
Go-Rite-On-By, Danger This Means You, and Smallpox, but lost my
nerve. Same with Nobody Home, which could easily give the wrong
impression. Besides, I need something now that will draw the crowds.
Heartbreak House might be over their heads, and so would Help Wanted,
and Concha del Clam is perhaps too upstage for a ten-cent
attraction.</p>

<p>Ah, well! A part of the dream is dreamed out, and the rest will be
as may be. The Fords have not actually arrived, and meanwhile I have
some names that I like to meditate upon as the bridge crawls closer
to my hermitage. God bless that bridge! Perhaps my favorite, no
kidding, is Fool's Paradise; to me it means a lot of things that I
haven't time to explain. And sometimes my home is Joyous Gard,
because of the Zachs Inlet crew, and sometimes Just An Idea, after
one of the Prince of Wales' horses. In more literary moments I think
of it as one of those P. G. Wodehouse places, but I never can decide
between East Wobsley, Little-Wigmarsh-in-the-Dell,
Lower-Briskett-in-the-Midden and
Higgleford-cum-Wortlebury-beneath-the-Hill. So now I just call it
August Johnson, as you may verify by the huge gold curlicued letters
over my porch. Shanghai found the gorgeous sign on the beach and
dragged it home, knowing my taste in art or its equivalent. It's a
swell sign and an honest, respectable name, but I'm open to
reason.</p>

<p>And to think that the very day before I heard of the State Park I
was all set on Hermit's Snug Harbor. Pretty tough, what?</p>

<p>At the moment, I confess, I'm a hermit up in the air. To Zip or
not to Zip, that is the question. I know just how that poor fellow
felt when he couldn't make up his mind about whatever it was; but
I'll never admit that he was mad, and if he <i>was</i> a bit off, why
wouldn't he be? What would he have done in my shoes? He'd have made a
fearful mess, one way or another, that's all we can be sure of, the
rest is silence. I'd better be asking, what would Anthony have
done&mdash;meaning, naturally, my favorite hermit, Antonios the
Egyptian.</p>

<p>It's uncanny how I stumble along in the footsteps of that grand
old guy, though falling rather more frequently beside the way. He had
his Jones's Island, too&mdash;a pleasant breathing place beside the
Nile, whither he had retired from the foolish goings-on of
Heracleopolis and Alexandria. For twenty years he dwelt there in
great peace and content in a little abandoned fort in the sand, and
no man set eyes upon him; no, nor woman, neither, excepting the
somewhat persistent wraith of the Queen of Sheba, who wouldn't take
no for an answer. And one day, aware of unseemly commotion, he
stepped forth, astonished, into that fierce light which beats upon a
hermit. Did his eyes deceive him?</p>

<p>Nay, 'twas true enough. The place was alive with hermits, profane
tourists, camels, donkeys and unclassified. Somebody had constructed
a pilgrim road across the Nile, and now the little crooked fort in
the sand was become the center of a thriving settlement; and its name
was Aphroditopolis! You may read in the "Apophthegmata Patrum" of our
hero's horror. So Antonios of Egypt stood there, thinking long, long
thoughts, and staggered back into the fort to think some more.</p>

<p>He bore it for a time, but finally, according to an ancient
manuscript, "he beat it to a more remote part of the desert." In
fact, he never stopped running until he reached the Red Sea. I like
to think that he was happy there, meditating his fill, resisting some
wonderful temptations and communing betimes with passing
Anthropophagi, Cynocephali, Nisnas, Blemmyes and Sciapods. He was a
great one for the likes of that, Antonios was. You do meet some
interesting Blemmyes, considering that they have no heads, but I
never could abide those Sciapods, who lie fettered to the earth by
their hair, with their umbrella-shaped feet in the air to keep off
the sun and the rain&mdash;I always get the feeling that they do it
on purpose.</p>

<p>Of course, there were always the Sphinx and the Chimera to
converse with, and such pets as sadhuzags, basilisks, griffins and
catoblepases. All I have is a ph&oelig;nix and a unicorn and a
dipsas&mdash;and the dipsas is pining away. I've always wanted a
catoblepas, but I don't know. I might get all moved and wish I was
back. I suppose a catoblepas has its drawbacks, too.</p>
