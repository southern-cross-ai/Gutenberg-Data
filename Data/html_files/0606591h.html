<h1>The Rider on the White Horse</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Theodor Storm</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>WHAT I am about to tell I learned nearly half a century ago in the
house of my great-grand-mother, old Madame Fedderson, widow of the
senator, while I was sitting beside her armchair, busy reading a
magazine bound in blue pasteboard-I don't remember whether it was a
copy of the "Leipzig" or of "Pappes Hamburger Lesefruchte." I still
remember with a shudder how meanwhile the light hand of the past
eighty-year-old woman glided tenderly over the hair of her
great-grandson. She herself and her time are buried long ago. In vain
have I searched for that magazine, and therefore I am even less able
to vouch for the truth of the statements in it than I am to defend
them if anyone should question them; but of so much I can assure
anyone, that since that time they have never been forgotten, even
though no outer incident has revived them in my memory.</p>

<p>It was in the third decade of our century, on an October
afternoon-thus began the story-teller of that time-that I rode
through a mighty storm along a North Frisian dike. For over an hour I
had on my left the dreary marshland, already deserted by all the
cattle; on my right, unpleasantly near me, the swamping waters of the
North Sea. I saw nothing, however, but the yellowish-grey waves that
beat against the dike unceasingly, as if they were roaring with rage,
and that now and then bespattered me and my horse with dirty foam;
behind them I could see only chaotic dusk which did not let me tell
sky and earth apart, for even the half moon which now stood in the
sky was most of the time covered by wandering clouds. It was ice
cold; my clammy hands could scarcely hold the reins, and I did not
wonder that the croaking and cackling crows and gulls were always
letting themselves be swept inland by the storm. Nightfall had begun,
and already I could no longer discern the hoof of my horse with any
certainty. I had met no human soul, heard nothing but the screaming
of the birds when they almost grazed me and my faithful mare with
their long wings, and the raging of the wind and water. I cannot deny
that now and then I wished that I were in safe quarters.</p>

<p>It was the third day that this weather had lasted, and I had
already allowed an especially dear relative to keep me longer than I
should have done on his estate in one of the more northern districts.
But to-day I could not stay longer. I had business in the city which
was even now a few hours' ride to the south, and in spite of all the
persuasions of my cousin and his kind wife, in spite of the Perinette
and Grand Richard apples still to be tried, I had ridden away.</p>

<p>"Wait till you get to the sea," he had called after me from his
house door. "You will turn back. Your room shall be kept for
you."</p>

<p>And really, for a moment, when a black layer of clouds spread
pitch-darkness round me and at the same time the howling squalls were
trying to force me and my horse down from the dike, the thought shot
through my head: "Don't be a fool! Turn back and stay with your
friends in their warm nest." But then it occurred to me that the way
back would be longer than the way to my destination; and so I trotted
on, pulling the collar of my coat up over my ears.</p>

<p>But now something came toward me upon the dike; I heard nothing,
but when the half moon shed its spare light, I believed that I could
discern more and more clearly a dark figure, and soon, as it drew
nearer, I saw that it sat on a horse, on a long-legged, haggard,
white horse; a dark cloak was waving round its shoulders, and as it
flew past me, two glowing eyes stared at me out of a pale face.</p>

<p>Who was that? What did that man want? And now it came to my mind
that I had not heard the beating of hoofs or any panting of the
horse; and yet horse and rider had ridden close by me!</p>

<p>Deep in thought over this I rode on, but I did not have much time
to think, for straightway it flew past me again from behind; it
seemed as if the flying cloak had grazed me, as if the apparition,
just as it had done the first time, had rushed by me without a sound.
Then I saw it farther and farther away from me, and suddenly it
seemed as if a shadow were gliding down at the inland side of the
dike.</p>

<p>Somewhat hesitating, I rode on behind. When I had reached that
place, hard by the "Koog," the land won from the sea by damming it
in, I saw water gleam from a great "Wehl," as they call the breaks
made into the land by the storm floods which remain as small but deep
pools.</p>

<p>In spite of the protecting dike, the water was remarkably calm;
hence the rider could not have troubled it. Besides, I saw nothing
more of him. Something else I saw now, however, which I greeted with
pleasure: before me, from out of the "Koog," a multitude of little
scattered lights were glimmering up to me; they seemed to come from
some of the rambling Frisian houses that lay isolated on more or less
high mounds. But close in front of me, half way up the inland side of
the dike lay a great house of this kind. On the south side, to the
right of the house door, I saw all the windows illumined, and beyond,
I perceived people and imagined that I could hear them in spite of
the storm. My horse had of himself walked down to the road along the
dike which led me up to the door of the house. I could easily see
that it was a tavern, for in front of the windows I spied the
so-called "ricks," beams resting on two posts with great iron rings
for hitching the cattle and horses that stopped there.</p>

<p>I tied my horse to one of these and left him to the servant who
met me as I entered the hall.</p>

<p>"Is a meeting going on here?" I asked him, for now a noise of
voices and clicking glasses rose clearly from the room beyond the
door.</p>

<p>"Aye, something of the sort," the servant replied in Plattdeutsch,
and later I learned that this dialect had been in full swing here, as
well as the Frisian, for over a hundred years; "the dikemaster and
the overseers and the other landholders! That's on account of the
high water!"</p>

<p>When I entered, I saw about a dozen men sitting round a table that
extended beneath the windows; a punch bowl stood upon it; and a
particularly stately man seemed to dominate the party.</p>

<p>I bowed and asked if I might sit down with them, a favor which was
readily granted.</p>

<p>"You had better keep watch here!" I said, turning to this man;
"the weather outside is bad; there will be hard times for the
dikes!"</p>

<p>"Surely," he replied, "but we here on the east side believe we are
out of danger. Only over there on the other side it isn't safe; the
dikes there are mostly made more after old patterns; our chief dike
was made in the last century. We got chilly outside a while ago; and
you," he added, "probably had the same experience. But we have to
hold out a few hours longer here; we have reliable people outside,
who report to us." And before I could give my order to the host, a
steaming glass was pushed in front of me.</p>

<p>I soon found out that my pleasant neighbour was the dikemaster; we
entered into conversation, and I began to tell him about my strange
encounter on the dike. He grew attentive, and I noticed suddenly that
all talk round about was silenced.</p>

<p>"The rider on the white horse," cried one of the company and a
movement of fright stirred the others.</p>

<p>The dikemaster had risen.</p>

<p>"You don't need to be afraid," he spoke across the table, "that
isn't meant for us only; in the year '17 it was meant for them too;
may they be ready for the worst!"</p>

<p>Now a horror came over me.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" I said. "What about this rider on the white
horse?"</p>

<p>Apart from the others, behind the stove, a small, haggard man in a
little worn black coat sat somewhat bent over; one of his shoulders
seemed a little deformed. He had not taken part with a single word in
the conversation of the others, but his eyes, fringed as they were
with dark lashes, although the scanty hair on his head was grey,
showed clearly that he was not sitting there to sleep.</p>

<p>Toward him the dikemaster pointed:</p>

<p>"Our schoolmaster," he said, raising his voice, "will be the one
among us who can tell you that best-to be sure, only in his way, and
not quite as accurately as my old house-keeper at home, Antje
Vollmans, would manage to tell it."</p>

<p>"You are joking, dikemaster!" the somewhat feeble voice of the
schoolmaster rose from behind the stove, "if you want to compare me
to your silly dragon!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all right, schoolmaster!" replied the other, "but
stories of that kind are supposed to be kept safest with
dragons."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the little man, "in this we are not quite of the
same opinion." And a superior smile flitted over his delicate
face.</p>

<p>"You see," the dikemaster whispered in my ear, "he is still a
little proud; in his youth he once studied theology and it was only
because of an unhappy courtship that he stayed hanging about his home
as schoolmaster."</p>

<p>The schoolmaster had meanwhile come forward from his corner by the
stove and had sat down beside me at the long table.</p>

<p>"Come on! Tell the story, schoolmaster," cried some of the younger
members of the party.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the old man, turning toward me. "I will gladly
oblige you; but there is a good deal of superstition mixed in with
it, and it is quite a feat to tell the story without it."</p>

<p>"I must beg you not to leave the superstition out," I replied.
"You can trust me to sift the chaff from the wheat by myself!"</p>

<p>The old man looked at me with an appreciative smile.</p>

<p>Well, he said, in the middle of the last century, or rather, to be
more exact, before and after the middle of that century, there was a
dikemaster here who knew more about dikes and sluices than peasants
and landowners usually do. But I suppose it was nevertheless not
quite enough, for he had read little of what learned specialists had
written about it; his knowledge, though he began in childhood, he had
thought out all by himself. I dare say you have heard, sir, that the
Frisians are good at arithmetic, and perhaps you have heard tell of
our Hans Mommsen from Fahntoft, who was a peasant and yet could make
chronometers, telescopes, and organs. Well, the father of this man
who later became dikemaster was made out of this same stuff-to be
sure, only a little. He had a few fens, where he planted turnips and
beans and kept a cow grazing; once in a while in the fall and spring
he also surveyed land, and in winter, when the northwest wind blew
outside and shook his shutters, he sat in his room to scratch and
prick with his instruments. The boy usually would sit by and look
away from his primer or Bible to watch his father measure and
calculate, and would thrust his hand into his blond hair. And one
evening he asked the old man why something that he had written down
had to be just so and could not be something different, and stated
his own opinion about it. But his father, who did not know how to
answer this, shook his head and said:</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell you; anyway it is so, and you are mistaken. If
you want to know more, search for a book to-morrow in a box in our
attic; someone whose name is Euclid has written it; that will tell
you."</p>

<p>The next day the boy had run up to the attic and soon had found
the book, for there were not many books in the house anyway, but his
father laughed when he laid it in front of him on the table. It was a
Dutch Euclid, and Dutch, although it was half German, neither of them
understood.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "this book belonged to my father; he
understood it; is there no German Euclid up there?"</p>

<p>The boy, who spoke little, looked at his father quietly and said
only: "May I keep it? There isn't any German one."</p>

<p>And when the old man nodded, he showed him a second half-torn
little book.</p>

<p>"That too?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"Take them both!" said Tede Haien; "they won't be of much use of
you."</p>

<p>But the second book was a little Dutch grammar, and as the winter
was not over for a long while, by the time the gooseberries bloomed
again in the garden it had helped the boy so far that he could almost
entirely understand his Euclid, which at that time was much in
vogue.</p>

<p>I know perfectly well, sir, the story teller interrupted himself,
that this same incident is also told of Hans Mommsen, but before his
birth our people here have told the same of Hauke Haien-that was the
name of the boy. You know well enough that as soon as a greater man
has come, everything is heaped on him that his predecessor has done
before him, either seriously or in fun.</p>

<p>When the old man saw that the boy had no sense for cows or sheep
and scarcely noticed when the beans were in bloom, which is the joy
of every marshman, and when he considered that his little place might
be kept up by a farmer and a boy, but not by a half-scholar and a
hired man, inasmuch as he himself had not been over-prosperous, he
sent his big boy to the dike, where he had to cart earth from Easter
until Martinmas. "That will cure him of his Euclid," he said to
himself.</p>

<p>And the boy carted; but his Euclid he always had with him in his
pocket, and when the workmen ate their breakfast or lunch, he sat on
his upturned wheelbarrow with the book in his hand. In autumn, when
the tide rose higher and sometimes work had to be stopped, he did not
go home with the others, but stayed and sat with his hands clasped
over his knees on the seaward slope of the dike, and for hours
watched the sombre waves of the North Sea beat always higher and
higher against the grass-grown scar of the dike. Not until the water
washed over his feet and the foam sprayed his face did he move a few
feet higher, only to stay and sit on. He did not hear the splash of
the water, or the scream of the gulls or strand birds that flew round
him and almost grazed him with their wings, flashing their black eyes
at his own; nor did he see how night spread over the wide wilderness
of water. The only thing he saw was the edge of the surf, which at
high tide was again and again hitting the same place with hard blows
and before his very eyes washing away the grassy scar of the steep
dike.</p>

<p>After staring a long time, he would nod his head slowly and,
without looking up, draw a curved line in the air, as if he could in
this way give the dike a gentler slope. When it grew so dark that all
earthly things vanished from his sight and only the surf roared in
his ears, then he got up and marched home half drenched.</p>

<p>One night when he came in this state into the room where his
father was polishing his surveying instruments, the latter started.
"What have you been doing out there?" he cried. "You might have
drowned; the waters are biting into the dike to-day."</p>

<p>Hauke looked at him stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear me? I say, you might have drowned!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hauke, "but I'm not drowned!"</p>

<p>"No," the old man answered after a while and looked into his face
absently-"not this time."</p>

<p>"But," Hauke returned, "our dikes aren't worth anything."</p>

<p>"What's that, boy?"</p>

<p>"The dikes, I say."</p>

<p>"What about the dikes?"</p>

<p>"They're no good, father," replied Hauke.</p>

<p>The old man laughed in his face. "What's the matter with you, boy?
I suppose you are the prodigy from L&uuml;beck."</p>

<p>But the boy would not be put down. "The waterside is too steep,"
he said; "if it happens some day as it has happened before, we can
drown here behind the dike too."</p>

<p>The old man pulled his tobacco out of his pocket, twisted off a
piece and pushed it behind his teeth. "And how many loads have you
pushed to-day?" he asked angrily, for he saw that the boy's work on
the dike had not been able to chase away his brainwork.</p>

<p>"I don't know, father," said the boy; "about as many as the others
did, or perhaps half a dozen more; but-the dikes have got to be
changed!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man with a short laugh, "perhaps you can
manage to be made dikemaster; then you can change them."</p>

<p>"Yes, father," replied the boy.</p>

<p>The old man looked at him and swallowed a few times, then he
walked out of the door. He did not know what to say to the boy.</p>

<p>Even when, at the end of October, the work on the dike was over,
his walk northward to the farm was the best entertainment for Hauke
Haien. He looked forward to All Saints' Day, the time when the
equinoctial storms were wont to rage-a day on which we say that
Friesland has a good right to mourn-just as children nowadays look
forward to Christmas. When an early flood was coming, one could be
sure that in spite of storm and bad weather, he would be lying all
alone far out on the dike; and when the gulls chattered, when the
waters pounded against the dike and as they rolled back swept big
pieces of the grass cover with them into the sea, then one could have
heard Hauke's furious laughter.</p>

<p>"You aren't good for anything!" he cried out into the noise. "Just
as the people are no good!" And at last, often in darkness, he
trotted home from the wide water along the dike, until his tall
figure had reached the low door under his father's thatch roof and
slipped into the little room.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had brought home a handful of clay; then he sat down
beside the old man, who now humoured him, and by the light of the
thin tallow candle he kneaded all sorts of dike models, laid them in
a flat dish with water and tried to imitate the washing away by the
waves; or he took his slate and drew the profiles of the dikes toward
the waterside as he thought they ought to be.</p>

<p>He had no idea of keeping up intercourse with his schoolmates; it
seemed, too, as if they did not care for this dreamer. When winter
had come again and the frost had appeared, he wandered still farther
out on the dike to points he had never reached before, until the
boundless ice-covered sand flats lay before him.</p>

<p>During the continuous frost in February, dead bodies were found
washed ashore; they had lain on the frozen sand flats by the open
sea. A young woman who had been present when they had taken the
bodies into the village, stood talking fluently with old Haien.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe that they looked like people!" she cried; "no,
like sea devils! Heads as big as this," and she touched together the
tips of her outspread and outstretched hands, "coal-black and shiny,
like newly baked bread! And the crabs had nibbled them, and the
children screamed when they saw them." For old Haien this was nothing
new.</p>

<p>"I suppose they have floated in the water since November!" he said
indifferently.</p>

<p>Hauke stood by in silence, but as soon as he could, he sneaked out
on the dike; nobody knew whether he wanted to look for more dead, or
if he was drawn to the places now deserted by the horror that still
clung to them. He ran on and on, until he stood alone in the solitary
waste, where only the winds blew over the dike where there was
nothing but the wailing voices of the great birds that shot by
swiftly. To his left was the wide empty marshland, on the other side
the endless beach with its sand flats now glistening with ice; it
seemed as if the whole world lay in a white death.</p>

<p>Hauke remained standing on the dike, and his sharp eyes gazed far
away. There was no sign of the dead; but when the invisible streams
on the sand flats found their way beneath the ice, it rose and sank
in streamlike lines.</p>

<p>He ran home, but on one of the next nights he was out there again.
In places the ice had now split; smoke-clouds seemed to rise out of
the cracks, and over the whole sand-stretch a net of steam and mist
seemed to be spun, which at evening mingled strangely with the
twilight. Hauke stared at it with fixed eyes, for in the mist dark
figures were walking up and down that seemed to him as big as human
beings. Far off he saw them promenade back and forth by the steaming
fissures, dignified, but with strange, frightening gestures, with
long necks and noses. All at once, they began to jump up and down
like fools, uncannily, the big ones over the little ones, the little
ones over the big ones-then they spread out and lost all shape.</p>

<p>"What do they want? Are they ghosts of the drowned?" thought
Hauke. "Hallo!" he screamed out aloud into the night; but they did
not heed his cry and kept on with their strange antics.</p>

<p>Then the terrible Norwegian sea spectres came to his mind, that an
old captain had once told him about, who bore stubby bunches of sea
grass on their necks instead of heads. He did not run away, however,
but dug the heels of his boots faster into the clay of the dike and
rigidly watched the farcical riot that was kept up before his eyes in
the falling dusk. "Are you here in our parts too?" he said in a hard
voice. "You shall not chase me away!"</p>

<p>Not until darkness covered all things did he walk home with stiff,
slow steps. But behind him he seemed to hear the rustling of wings
and resounding screams. He did not look round, neither did he walk
faster, and it was late when he came home. Yet he is said to have
told neither his father nor anyone else about it. But many years
after he took his feeble-minded little girl, with whom the Lord later
had burdened him, out on the dike with him at the same time of day
and year, and the same riot is said to have appeared then out on the
sand flats. But he told her not to be afraid, that these things were
only the herons and crows, that seemed so big and horrible, and that
they were getting fish out of the open cracks.</p>

<p>God knows, the schoolmaster interrupted himself, there are all
sorts of things on earth that could confuse a Christian heart, but
Hauke was neither a fool nor a blockhead.</p>

<p>As I made no response, he wanted to go on. But among the other
guests, who till now had listened without making a sound, only
filling the low room more and more thickly with tobacco smoke, there
arose a sudden stir. First one, then another, then all turned toward
the window. Outside, as one could see through the uncurtained glass,
the storm was driving the clouds, and light and dark were chasing one
another; but it seemed to me too as if I had seen the haggard rider
whiz by on his white horse.</p>

<p>"Wait a little, schoolmaster," said the dikemaster in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"You don't need to be afraid, dikemaster," laughed the little
narrator. "I have not slandered him and have no reason to do so"-and
he looked up at him with his small clever eyes.</p>

<p>"All right," said the other. "Let your glass be filled again!" And
when that had been done and the listeners, most of them with rather
anxious faces, had turned to him again, he went on with his
story:</p>

<p>Living thus by himself and liking best to associate only with sand
and water and with scenes of solitude, Hauke grew into a long lean
fellow. It was a year after his confirmation that his life was
suddenly changed, and this came about through the old white Angora
cat which old Trin Jans's son, who later perished at sea, had brought
her on his return from a voyage to Spain. Trin lived a good way out
on the dike in a little hut, and when the old woman did her chores in
the house, this monster of a cat used to sit in front of the house
door and blink into the summer day and at the peewits that flew past.
When Hauke went by, the cat mewed at him and Hauke nodded; both knew
how each felt toward the other.</p>

<p>Now it was spring and Hauke, as he was accustomed to do, often lay
out on the dike, already farther out near the water, between beach
pinks and the fragrant sea-wormwood, and let the strong sun shine on
him. He had gathered his pockets full of pebbles up on the higher
land the day before, and when at low tide the sand flats were laid
bare and the little gay strand snipes whisked across them screaming,
he quickly pulled out a stone and threw it after the birds. He had
practiced this from earliest childhood on, and usually one of the
birds remained lying on the ground; but often it was impossible to
get at it. Hauke had sometimes thought of taking the cat with him and
training him as a retriever. But there were hard places here and
there on the sand; in that case he ran and got his prey himself. On
his way back, if the cat was still sitting in front of the house
door, the animal would utter piercing cries of uncontrollable greed
until Hauke threw him one of the birds he had killed.</p>

<p>To-day when he walked home, carrying his jacket on his shoulder,
he was taking home only one unknown bird, but that seemed to have
wings of gay silk and metal; and the cat mewed as usual when he saw
him coming. But this time Hauke did not want to give up his prey-it
may have been an ice bird-and he paid no attention to the greed of
the animal. "Wait your turn!" he called to him. "To-day for me,
to-morrow for you; this is no food for a cat!"</p>

<p>As the cat came carefully sneaking along, Hauke stood and looked
at it: the bird was hanging from his hand, and the cat stood still
with its paw raised. But it seemed that the young man did not know
his cat friend too well, for, while he had turned his back on it and
was just going on his way, he felt that with a sudden jerk his booty
was torn from him, and at the same time a sharp claw cut into his
flesh. A rage like that of a beast of prey shot into the young man's
blood; wildly he stretched out his arm and in a flash had clutched
the robber by his neck. With his fist he held the powerful animal
high up and choked it until its eyes bulged out among its rough
hairs, not heeding that the strong hind paws were tearing his flesh.
"Hello!" he shouted, and clutched him still more tightly; "let's see
which of us two can stand it the longest!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the hind legs of the big cat fell languidly down, and
Hauke walked back a few steps and threw it against the hut of the old
woman. As it did not stir, he turned round and continued his way
home.</p>

<p>But the Angora cat was the only treasure of her mistress; he was
her companion and the only thing that her son, the sailor, had left
her after he had met with sudden death here on the coast when he had
wanted to help his mother by fishing in the storm. Hauke had scarcely
walked on a hundred steps, while he caught the blood from his wounds
on a cloth, when he heard a shrill howling and screaming from the
hut. He turned round and, in front of it, saw the old woman lying on
the ground; her grey hair was flying in the wind round her red head
scarf.</p>

<p>"Dead!" she cried; "dead!" and raised her lean arm threateningly
against him: "A curse on you! You have killed her, you good for
nothing vagabond; you weren't good enough to brush her tail!" She
threw herself upon the animal and with her apron she tenderly wiped
off the blood that was still running from its nose and mouth; then
she began her screaming again.</p>

<p>"When will you be done?" Hauke cried to her. "Then let me tell
you, I'll get you a cat that will be satisfied with the blood of mice
and rats!"</p>

<p>Then he went on his way, apparently no longer concerned with
anything. But the dead cat must have caused some confusion in his
head, for when he came to the village, he passed by his father's
house and the others and walked on a good distance toward the south
on the dike toward the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Trin Jans, too, wandered on the dike in the same
direction. In her arms she bore a burden wrapped in an old blue
checkered pillowcase, and clasped it carefully as if it were a child;
her grey hair fluttered in the light spring wind. "What are you
lugging there, Trina?" asked a peasant who met her. "More than your
house and farm," replied the old woman, and walked on eagerly. When
she came near the house of old Haien, which lay below, she walked
down to the houses along the "akt," as we call the cattle and foot
paths that lead slantingly up and down the side of the dike.</p>

<p>Old Tede Haien was just standing in front of his door, looking at
the weather. "Well, Trin!" he said, when she stood panting in front
of him and dug her crutch into the ground, "What are you bringing us
in your bag?"</p>

<p>"First let me into the room, Tede Haien! Then you shall see!" and
her eyes looked at him with a strange gleam.</p>

<p>"Well, come along!" said the old man. What did he care about the
eyes of the stupid woman!</p>

<p>When both had entered, she went on: "Take that old tobacco box and
those writing things from the table. What do you always have to write
for, anyway? All right; and now wipe it clean!"</p>

<p>And the old man, who was almost growing curious, did everything
just as she said. Then she took the blue pillow-case at both ends and
emptied the carcass of the big cat out on the table. "There she is!"
she cried; "your Hauke has killed her!" Thereupon she began to cry
bitterly; she stroked the thick fur of the dead animal, laid its paws
together, bent her long nose over its head and whispered
incomprehensible words of tenderness into its ears.</p>

<p>Tede Haien watched this. "Is that so," he said; "Hauke has killed
her?"</p>

<p>He did not know what to do with the howling woman.</p>

<p>She nodded at him grimly. "Yes, yes, God knows, that's what he has
done," and she wiped the tears from her eyes with her hand, crippled
by rheumatism. "No child, no live thing any more!" she complained.
"And you know yourself how it is after All Saints' Day, when we old
people feel our legs shiver at night in bed, and instead of sleeping
we hear the northwest wind rattle against the shutters. I don't like
to hear it. Tede Haien, it comes from where my boy sank to death in
the quicksand!"</p>

<p>Tede Haien nodded, and the old woman stroked the fur of her dead
cat. "But this one here," she began again, "when I would sit by my
spinning-wheel, there she would sit with me and spin too and look at
me with her green eyes! And when I grew cold and crept into my
bed-then it wasn't long before she jumped up to me and lay down on my
chilly legs, and we both slept as warmly together as if I still had
my young sweetheart in bed!"</p>

<p>The old woman, as if she were waiting for his assent to this
remembrance, looked with her gleaming eyes at the old man standing
beside her at the table. Tede Haien, however, said thoughtfully: "I
know a way out for you, Trin Jans," and he went to his strong box and
took a silver coin out of the drawer. "You say that Hauke has robbed
your animal of life, and I know you don't lie; but here is a crown
piece from the time of Christian IV; go and buy a tanned lamb-skin
with it for your cold legs! And when our cat has kittens, you may
pick out the biggest of them; both together, I suppose, will make up
for an Angora cat feeble from old age! Take your beast and, if you
want to, take it to the tanner in town, but keep your mouth shut and
don't tell that it has lain on my honest table."</p>

<p>During this speech the woman had already snatched the crown and
stowed it away in a little bag that she carried under her skirts,
then she tucked the cat back into the pillowcase, wiped the
bloodstains from the table with her apron, and stalked out of the
door. "Don't you forget the young cat!" she called back.</p>

<p>After a while, when old Haien was walking up and down in the
narrow little room, Hauke stepped in and tossed his bright bird on to
the table. But when he saw the still recognizable bloodstain on the
clean white top, he asked as if by the way: "What's that?"</p>

<p>His father stood still. "That's blood that you have spilled!"</p>

<p>The young man flushed hotly. "Why, has Trin Jans been here with
her cat?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded: "Why did you kill it?"</p>

<p>Hauke uncovered his bleeding arm. "That's why," he said. "She had
torn my bird away from me!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the old man said nothing. For a time he began to walk up
and down, then he stood still in front of the young man and looked at
him for a while almost absently.</p>

<p>"This affair with the cat I have made all right," he said, "but
look, Hauke, this place is too small; two people can't stay on it-it
is time you got a job!"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," replied Hauke; "I have been thinking something of
the sort myself."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, one gets wild inside unless one can let it out on a decent
piece of work!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the old man, "and that's why you have killed
the Angora cat? That might easily lead to something worse!"</p>

<p>"You may be right, father, but the dikemaster has discharged his
farmhand; I could do that work all right!"</p>

<p>The old man began to walk up and down, and meanwhile spat out the
black tobacco. "The dikemaster is a blockhead, as stupid as a goose!
He is dikemaster only because his father and grandfather have been
the same, and on account of his twenty-nine fens. Round Martinmas,
when the dike and sluice bills have to be settled, then he feeds the
schoolmaster on roast goose and mead and wheat buns, and sits by and
nods while the other man runs down the columns of figures with his
pen, and says: 'Yes, yes, schoolmaster, God reward you! How finely
you calculate!' But when the schoolmaster can't or won't, then he has
to go at it himself and sits scribbling and striking out again, his
big stupid head growing red and hot, his eyes bulging out like glass
balls, as if his little bit of sense wanted to get out that way."</p>

<p>The young man stood up straight in front of his father and
marveled at his talking; he had never heard him speak like that.
"Yes, God knows," he said, "no doubt he is stupid, but his daughter
Elke, she can calculate!"</p>

<p>The old man looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Hauke," he exclaimed "what do you know about Elke
Volkerts?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, father; only the schoolmaster has told me?"</p>

<p>The old man made no reply; he only pushed his piece of tobacco
thoughtfully from one cheek into the other. "And you think," he said,
"that you can help in the counting there too."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, father, that would work all right," the son replied, and
there was a serious twitching about his mouth.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head: "Well, go if you like; go and try your
luck!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, father!" said Hauke, and climbed up to his sleeping place
in the garret. There he sat down on the edge of the bed and pondered
why his father had shouted at him so when he had mentioned Elke
Volkerts. To be sure, he knew the slender, eighteen-year-old girl
with the tanned, narrow face and the dark eyebrows that ran into each
other over the stubborn eyes and the slender nose; but he had
scarcely spoken a word to her. Now, if he should go to old Tede
Volkerts, he would look at her more and see what there was about the
girl. Right off he wanted to go, so that no one else could snatch the
position away from him-it was now scarcely evening. And so he put on
his Sunday coat and his best boots and started out in good
spirits.</p>

<p>The long rambling house of the dikemaster was visible from afar
because of the high mound on which it stood, and especially because
of the highest tree in the village, a mighty ash. The grandfather of
the present dikemaster, the first of the line, had in his youth
planted an ash to the east of the house door; but the first two had
died, and so he had planted a third on his wedding morning, which was
still murmuring as if of old times in the increasing wind with its
crown of foliage that was growing mightier and mightier.</p>

<p>When, after a while, tall, lank Hauke climbed up the hill which
was planted on both sides with beets and cabbage, he saw the daughter
of the owner standing beside the low house door. One of her somewhat
thin arms was hanging down languidly, the other seemed to be grasping
behind her back at one of the iron rings which were fastened to the
wall on either side of the door, so that anyone who rode to the house
could use them to hitch his horse. From there the young girl seemed
to be gazing over the dike at the sea, where on this calm evening the
sun was just sinking into the water and at the same time gilding the
dark-skinned maiden with its last golden glow.</p>

<p>Hauke climbed up the hill a little more slowly, and thought to
himself: "She doesn't look so dull this way!" Then he was at the top.
"Good evening to you!" he said, stepping up to her. "What are you
looking at with your big eyes, Miss Elke?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking," she replied, "at something that goes on here every
night, but can't be seen here every night." She let the ring drop
from her hand, so that it fell against the wall with a clang. "What
do you want, Hauke Haien?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Something that I hope you don't mind," he said. "Your father has
just discharged his hired man; so I thought I would take a job with
you."</p>

<p>She glanced at him, up and down: "You are still rather lanky,
Hauke!" she said, "but two steady eyes serve us better than two
steady arms!" At the same time she looked at him almost sombrely, but
Hauke bravely withstood her gaze. "Come on, then," she continued.
"The master is in his room; let's go inside."</p>

<p>The next day Tede Haien stepped with his son into the spacious
room of the dikemaster. The walls were covered with glazed tiles on
which the visitor could enjoy her a ship with sails unfurled or an
angler on the shore, there a cow that lay chewing in front of a
peasant's house. This durable wall-covering was interrupted by an
alcove-bed with doors now closed, and a cupboard which showed all
kinds of china and silver dishes through glass doors. Beside the door
to the "best room" a Dutch clock was set into the wall behind a pane
of glass.</p>

<p>The stout, somewhat apoplectic master of the house sat at the end
of the well-scrubbed, shining table in an armchair with a
bright-coloured cushion. He had folded his hands across his stomach,
and was staring contentedly with his round eyes at the skeleton of a
fat duck; knife and fork were resting in front of him on his
plate.</p>

<p>"Good day, dikemaster!" said Haien, and the gentleman thus
addressed slowly turned his head and eyes toward him.</p>

<p>"You here, Tede?" he replied, and the devoured fat duck had left
its mark on his voice. "Sit down; it is quite a walk from your place
over here!"</p>

<p>"I have come, dikemaster," said Tede Haien, while he sat down
opposite the other in a corner on the bench that ran along the wall.
"You have had trouble with your hired man and have agreed with my boy
to put him in his place!"</p>

<p>The dikemaster nodded: "Yes, yes, Tede; but-what do you mean by
trouble? We people of the marshes, thank goodness, have something to
take against troubles!"-and he took the knife before him and patted
the skeleton of the poor duck almost affectionately. "This was my pet
bird," he added laughing smugly; "he fed out of my hand!"</p>

<p>"I thought," said old Haien, not hearing the last remark, "the boy
had done harm in your stable."</p>

<p>"Harm? Yes, Tede; surely harm enough! That fat clown hadn't
watered the calves; but he lay drunk on the hayloft, and the beasts
bellowed all night with thirst, so that I had to make up my lost
sleep till noon; that's not the way a farm can go on!"</p>

<p>"No, dikemaster; but there is no danger of that happening with my
boy."</p>

<p>Hauke stood, his hands in his pockets, by the door-post, and had
thrown back his head and was studying the window frames opposite
him.</p>

<p>The dikemaster had raised his eyes and nodded toward him: "No, no,
Tede,"-and now he nodded at the old man too; "your Hauke won't
disturb my night's rest; the schoolmaster has told me before that he
would rather sit with his slate and do arithmetic than with a glass
of whiskey."</p>

<p>Hauke did not hear this encouragement, for Elke had stepped into
the room and with her light hand took out the remnants from the
table, meanwhile glancing at him carelessly with her dark eyes. Then
his glances fell on her too. "By my faith," he said to himself, "she
doesn't look so dull now either!"</p>

<p>The girl had left the room. "You know, Tede," the dikemaster began
again, "the Lord has not granted me a son!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dikemaster, but don't let that worry you," replied the
other, "for they say that in the third generation the brains of a
family run out; your grandfather, we all remember, was a man who
protected the land!"</p>

<p>The dikemaster, after some pondering, looked quite puzzled: "How
do you mean, Tede Haien?" he said and sat up in his armchair; "I am
in the third generation myself!"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Never mind, dikemaster; that's just what people say!"
And the lean Tede Haien looked at the old dignitary with rather
mischievous eyes.</p>

<p>The latter, however, spoke unconcerned: "You mustn't let old women
get nonsense like that into your head, Tede Haien; you don't know my
daughter yet-she can calculate three times better than I can! I only
wanted to say, your Hauke will be able to make some profit outside of
his field work in my room with pen and pencil, and that will do him
no harm."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dikemaster, he can do that; there you are perfectly
right;" said old Haien and then began to demand some privileges with
the contract which his son had not thought of the night before. For
instance, the latter should receive, besides his linen shirts, eight
pair of woollen stockings in addition to his wages; also he wanted to
have his son's help at his own work for eight days in spring-and more
of the sort. But the dikemaster agreed to everything; Hauke Haien
appeared to him just the right servant.</p>

<p>"Well, God help you, my boy," said the old man, when they had just
left the house, "if that man is to make the world clear to you!"</p>

<p>But Hauke replied calmly: "Never mind, father; everything will
turn out all right."</p>

<p>Hauke had not been wrong in his judgment. The world, or what the
world meant to him, grew clearer to his mind, the longer he stayed in
this house-perhaps all the more, the less he was helped by a wiser
insight and the more, he had to depend on his own powers with which
he had from the beginning helped himself. There was someone in the
house, however, whom he did not seem to suit; that was Ole Peters,
the head man, a good worker and a great talker. The former lazy and
stupid but stocky hired man had been more to his liking, whose back
he could load calmly with a barrel of oats and whom he could knock
about to his heart's content. Hauke, who was still more silent, but
who surpassed him mentally, he could not treat in the same way; Hauke
had too strange a way of looking at him. Nevertheless he managed to
pick out tasks which might have been dangerous for the young man's
yet undeveloped body; and when the head man would say: "You ought to
have seen fat Nick, he could do it without any trouble at all," then
Hauke would work with all his might and finish the task, although
with difficulty. It was lucky for him that Elke usually could hinder
this, either by herself or through her father. One may ask what it is
that binds people who are complete strangers to each other;
perhaps-well, they were both born arithmeticians, and the girl could
not bear to see her comrade ruined by rough work.</p>

<p>The conflict between head man and second man did not grow less
when after Martinmas the different dike bills came in for
revision.</p>

<p>It happened on a May evening, but the weather was like November;
inside the house one could hear the surf roar outside from behind the
dike.</p>

<p>"Hey, Hauke," said the master of the house, "come in; now is your
chance to show if you can do arithmetic!"</p>

<p>"Master," Hauke replied; "I'm supposed to feed the young cattle
first."</p>

<p>"Elke!" called the dikemaster; "where are you, Elke? Go and tell
Ole to feed the young cattle; I want Hauke to calculate!"</p>

<p>So Elke hurried into the stable and gave the order to the head man
who was just busy hanging the harness used during the day back in
place.</p>

<p>Ole Peters whipped the post beside which he had been busying
himself with a bridle, as if he wanted to beat it to pieces: "The
devil take that cursed scribbler!"</p>

<p>She heard these words even before she had closed the stable door
again.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the old man, as she stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"Ole was willing to do it," said his daughter, biting her lips a
little, and sat down opposite Hauke on one of the roughly carved
chairs which in those days were still made at home on winter
evenings. Out of a drawer she had taken a white stocking with a red
bird pattern on it, which she was now knitting; the long-legged
creatures might have represented herons or storks. Hauke sat opposite
her, deep in his arithmetic; the dikemaster himself rested in his
armchair and blinked sleepily at Hauke's pen. On the table, as always
in the house of the dikemaster, two tallow candles were burning, and
behind the windows with their leaden frames the shutters were closed
and fastened from within; now the wind could bang against them as
hard as it liked. Once in a while Hauke raised his head and glanced
for a moment at the bird stockings or at the narrow, calm face of the
girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the armchair there rose a loud snore, and a glance
and smile flew back and forth between the two young people; gradually
the breathing grew more quiet, and one could easily talk a
little-only Hauke did not know about what.</p>

<p>But when she raised her knitting and the birds appeared in their
whole length, he whispered across the table: "Where have you learned
that, Elke?"</p>

<p>"Learned what?" the girl returned.</p>

<p>"This bird knitting?" said Hauke.</p>

<p>"This? From Trin Jans out there on the dike; she can do all sorts
of things. She was servant here to my grandfather a long time
ago."</p>

<p>"At that time I don't suppose you were born?" said Hauke.</p>

<p>"I think not; but she has often come to the house since then."</p>

<p>"Does she like birds?" asked Hauke; "I thought only cats were for
her."</p>

<p>Elke shook her head: "Why, she raises ducks and sells them; but
last spring, when you had killed her Angora cat, the rats got into
the pen at the back of the house and made mischief; now she wants to
build herself another in front of the house."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Hauke and whistled low through his teeth,
"that's why she dragged mud and stones from the upper land. But then
she will get on to the inland road; has she a grant?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Elke. But he had spoken the last word so loud
that the dikemaster started out of his slumber.</p>

<p>"What grant?" he asked and looked almost wildly from one to the
other. "What about the grant?"</p>

<p>But when Hauke had explained the matter to him, he slapped the
young man's shoulder, laughing: "Oh, well, the inland road is broad
enough; God help the dikemaster if he has to worry about duck
pens!"</p>

<p>It weighed on Hauke's heart that he should have delivered the old
woman and her ducks over to the rats, but he allowed himself to be
quieted by this objection. "But, master," he began again, "it might
be good for some people to be prodded a little, and if you don't want
to go after them yourself, why don't you prod the overseers who ought
to look out for order on the dike?"</p>

<p>"How-what is the boy saying?" and the dikemaster sat up straight,
and Elke let her fancy stocking sink down and turned an ear toward
Hauke.</p>

<p>"Yes, master," Hauke went on, "you have already gone round on your
spring inspection; but just the same Peter Jansen hasn't weeded his
lot to this day; and in summer the goldfinches will play round the
red thistles as gaily as ever. And near by-I don't know to whom it
belongs-there is a hole like a cradle on the outer side of the dike;
when the weather is good it is always full of little children that
roll in it; but-God save us from high water!"</p>

<p>The eyes of the old dikemaster had grown bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>"And then-" said Hauke again.</p>

<p>"Then what more, boy?" asked the dikemaster; "haven't you finished
yet?" and it seemed as if he had already had too much of his second
man's speech.</p>

<p>"Yes; then, master," Hauke went on; "you know that fat Vollina,
the daughter of the overseer Harder, who always fetches her father's
horse from the fen-well, as soon as she sits with her round legs on
the old yellow mare-Get up!-why, then every time she goes diagonally
up the slope of the dike!"</p>

<p>Hauke did not notice until now that Elke had fixed her intelligent
eyes on him and was gently shaking her head.</p>

<p>He was silent, but a bang on the table from the old man's fist
thundered in his ears. "Confound it!" he cried, and Hauke was almost
frightened by the bear's voice that suddenly broke out: "to the fens!
Note down that fat creature in the fens, Hauke! That girl caught
three of my young ducks last summer! Yes, yes, put it down," he
repeated, when Hauke hesitated; "I even believe there were four!"</p>

<p>"Oh, father," said Elke, "wasn't it an otter that took the
ducks?"</p>

<p>"A big otter!" cried the old man, panting; "I guess I can tell the
fat Vollina and an otter apart! No, no, four ducks, Hauke-but as for
the rest of what you have been chattering-last spring the dikemaster
general and I, after we had breakfasted together at my house, drove
by your weeds and your cradle-hole and yet couldn't see anything. But
you two," and he nodded a few times significantly at Hauke and his
daughter, "you can thank God that you are no dikemaster! Two eyes are
all one has, and one is supposed to look with a hundred. Take the
bills for the straw coverings, Hauke, and look them over; those
rascals do keep their accounts in such a shiftless way!"</p>

<p>Then he leaned back in his chair again, moved his heavy body a few
times and soon gave himself over to care-free slumber.</p>

<p>The same thing was repeated on many an evening. Hauke had sharp
eyes, and when they sat together, he did not neglect to call the old
man's attention to one or the other violation or omission in dike
matters, and as the latter could not always keep his eyes closed,
unawares the management acquired a greater efficiency and those who
in other times had gone on sinning in their old, careless ways and
now, as it were, unexpectedly felt their mischievous or lazy fingers
slapped, looked round indignantly and with astonishment to see whence
these slaps had come. And Ole, the head man, did not hesitate to
spread the information and in this way to rouse indignation among
these people against Hauke and his father, who had to bear part of
the guilt. The others, however, who were not affected or who were not
concerned with the matter, laughed and rejoiced to see that the young
man had at last got the old man going a bit. "It's only too bad,"
they said, "that the young fellow hasn't enough ground under his
feet; else he might make a dikemaster of the kind we used to have-but
those few acres of his old man wouldn't do, after all!"</p>

<p>Next autumn, when the inspector and the dikemaster general came
for the inspection, he looked at old Tede Volkerts from top to toe,
while the latter was urging him to sit down to lunch.</p>

<p>"I tell you, dikemaster," he said, "I was thinking-you have
actually grown ten years younger. You have set my blood coursing with
all your proposals; if only we can get down with all that
to-day!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall, we shall, your Honor," replied the old man with a
smirk; "the roast goose over there will give us strength! Yes, thank
God, I am still always well and brisk!" He looked round the room to
make sure that Hauke was not about; then he added with calm dignity:
"And so I hope I may fulfill the duties of my office a few more
blessed years."</p>

<p>"And to this, my dear dikemaster," returned his superior, "we want
to drink this glass together."</p>

<p>Elke who had looked after the lunch laughed to herself as she left
the room just when the glasses were clicking. Then she took a dish of
scraps from the kitchen and walked through the stable to give them to
the poultry in front of the outside door. In the stable stood Hauke
Haien and with his pitch-fork put hay into the racks of the cows that
had to be brought up here so early because of the bad weather. But
when he saw the girl come, he stuck the pitchfork into the ground.
"Well, Elke!" he said.</p>

<p>She stood still and nodded at him: "All right, Hauke-but you
should have been in there!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Why, Elke?"</p>

<p>"The dikemaster general has praised the master!"</p>

<p>"The master? What has that to do with me?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean, he has praised the dikemaster!"</p>

<p>The young man's face was flushed crimson: "I know very well," he
said, "what you are driving at."</p>

<p>"Don't blush, Hauke; it was really you whom the dikemaster general
praised!"</p>

<p>Hauke looked at her with a half smile. "You too, Elke!" he
said.</p>

<p>But she shook her head: "No, Hauke; when I was helper alone, we
got no praise. And then, I can only do arithmetic; but you see
everything outdoors that the dikemaster is supposed to see for
himself. You have cut me out!"</p>

<p>"That isn't what I intended-least of all you!" said Hauke timidly,
and he pushed aside the head of a cow. "Come, Redskin, don't swallow
my pitchfork, you'll get all you want!"</p>

<p>"Don't think that I'm sorry, Hauke;" said the girl after thinking
a little while; "that really is a man's business."</p>

<p>Then Hauke stretched out his arm toward her. "Elke, give me your
hand, so that I can be sure."</p>

<p>Beneath her dark brows a deep crimson flushed the girl's face.
"Why? I'm not lying!" she cried.</p>

<p>Hauke wanted to reply; but she had already left the stable, and he
stood with his pitchfork in his hand and heard only the cackling and
crowing of the ducks and the hens round her outside.</p>

<p>In the January of Hauke's third year of service a winter festival
was to be held-"Eisboseln" they call it here. The winds had been calm
on the coast and steady frost had covered all the ditches between the
fens with a solid, even, crystal surface, so that the marked-off
strips of land offered a wide field for the throwing at a goal of
little wooden balls filled with lead. Day in, day out, a light
northeast wind was blowing: everything had been prepared. The people
from the higher land, inhabitants of the village that lay eastward
above the marshes, who had won last year, had been challenged to a
match and had accepted. From either side nine players had been
picked. The umpire and the score-keepers had been chosen. The latter,
who had to discuss a doubtful throw whenever a difference of opinion
came up, were always chosen from among people who knew how to place
their own case in the best possible light, preferably young fellows
who not only had good common sense but also a ready tongue. Among
these was, above all, Ole Peters, the head man of the dikemaster.
"Throw away like devils!" he said; "I'll do the talking for
nothing!"</p>

<p>Toward evening on the day before the holiday a number of throwers
had appeared in the side room of the parish inn up on the higher
land, in order to decide about accepting some men who had applied in
the last moment. Hauke Haien was among these. At first he had not
wanted to take part, although he was well aware of having arms
skilled in throwing; but he was afraid that he might be rejected by
Ole Peters who had a post of honor in the game, and he wanted to
spare himself this defeat. But Elke had made him change his mind at
the eleventh hour. "He won't dare, Hauke," she had said; "he is the
son of a day laborer; your father has his cow and horse and is the
cleverest man in the village."</p>

<p>"But if he should manage to, after all?"</p>

<p>Half smiling she looked at him with her dark eyes. "Then he'll get
left," she said, "in the evening, when he wants to dance with his
master's daughter." Then Hauke had nodded to her with spirit.</p>

<p>Now the young men who still hoped to be taken into the game stood
shivering and stamping outside the parish inn and looked up at the
top of the stone church tower which stood beside the tavern. The
pastor's pigeons which during the summer found their food on the
fields of the village were just returning from the farmyards and
barns of the peasants, where they had pecked their grain, and were
disappearing into their nests underneath the shingles of the tower.
In the west, over the sea, there was a glowing sunset.</p>

<p>"We'll have good weather to-morrow," said one of the young
fellows, and began to wander up and down excitedly; "but cold-cold."
Another man, when he saw no more pigeons flying, walked into the
house and stood listening beside the door of the room in which a
lively babble was now sounding. The second man of the dikemaster,
too, had stepped up beside him. "Listen, Hauke," he said to the
latter; "now they are making all this noise about you." And clearly
one could hear from inside Ole Peters's grating voice: "Underlings
and boys don't belong here!"</p>

<p>"Come," whispered the other man and tried to pull Hauke by his
sleeve to the door of the room, "here you can learn how high they
value you."</p>

<p>But Hauke tore himself away and went to the front of the house
again: "They haven't barred us out so that we should hear," he called
back.</p>

<p>Before the house stood the third of the applicants. "I'm afraid
there's a hitch in this business for me," he called to Hauke; "I'm
barely eighteen years old; if they only won't ask for my birth
certificate! Your head man, Hauke, will get you out of your fix, all
right!"</p>

<p>"Yes, out!" growled Hauke and kicked a stone across the road; "but
not in!"</p>

<p>The noise in the room was growing louder; then gradually there was
calm. Those outside could again hear the gentle northeast wind that
broke against the point of the church steeple. The man who listened
joined them. "Whom did they take in there?" asked the
eighteen-year-old one.</p>

<p>"Him!" said the other, and pointed to Hauke; "Ole Peters wanted to
make him out as a boy; but the others shouted against it.-'And his
father has cattle and land,' said Jess Hansen.-'Yes, land,' cried Ole
Peters, 'land that one can cart away on thirteen wheelbarrows!' Last
came Ole Hensen: 'Keep still!' he cried; 'I'll make things clear:
tell me, who is the first man in the village?'-Then all kept mum and
seemed to be thinking. Then a voice said: 'I should say it was the
dikemaster!'-'And who is the dikemaster?' cried Ole Hensen again;
'but now think twice!'-Then somebody began to laugh quietly, and then
someone else too, and so on till there was nothing but loud laughter
in the room.-'Well, then call him,' said Ole Hensen; 'you don't want
to keep the dikemaster out in the cold!'-I believe they're still
laughing; but Ole Peters's voice could not be heard any more!" Thus
the young fellow ended his account.</p>

<p>Almost in the same instant the door of the room inside the house
was opened suddenly and out into the cold night sounded loud and
merry cries of "Hauke! Hauke Haien!"</p>

<p>Then Hauke marched into the house and never could hear the rest of
the story of who was the dikemaster; meanwhile no one has found out
what was going on in his head.</p>

<p>After a while, when he approached the house of his employers, he
saw Elke standing by the fence below, where the ascent began; the
moonlight was shimmering over the measureless white frosted
pasture.</p>

<p>"You are standing here, Elke?" he asked.</p>

<p>She only nodded: "What happened?" she said; "has he dared?"</p>

<p>"What wouldn't he-?"</p>

<p>"Well, and-?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Elke; I'm allowed to try it to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"Good night, Hauke!" And she fled up the slope and vanished into
the house.</p>

<p>Slowly he followed her.</p>

<p>Next afternoon on the wide pasture that extended in the east along
the land side of the dike, one could see a dark crowd. Now it would
stand motionless, now move gradually on, down from the long and low
houses lying behind it, as soon as a wooden ball had twice shot forth
from it over the ground now freed by the bright sun from frost. The
teams of the "Eisbosler" were in the middle, surrounded by old and
young, by all who lived with them in these houses or up in those of
the higher land-the older men in long coats, pensively smoking their
short pipes, the women in shawls or jackets, some leading children by
the hand or carrying them on their arms. From the frozen ditches,
which were being crossed gradually, the pale light of the afternoon
sun was gleaming through the sharp points of the sedges. It was keen
frost, but the game went on uninterruptedly, and the eyes of all were
again and again following the flying ball, for upon it depended the
honor of the whole village for the day. The score-keepers of the two
sides carried a white stick with an iron point for the home team, a
black one of the same kind for the team of the people from the upper
land. Where the ball ended its flight, the stick was driven into the
frozen ground, accompanied, as it happened, either by silent approval
or the derisive laughter of the opposing side; and he whose ball had
first reached the goal, had won the game for his team.</p>

<p>Little was said by all these people; only when a capital throw had
been made, a cry from the young men or women could be heard;
sometimes, too, one of the old men would take his pipe out of his
mouth and knock with it on the shoulder of the thrower with a few
cheering words: "That was a good throw, said Zacharias, and threw his
wife out of the door!" or: "That's the way your father threw, too;
God bless him in eternity!" or some other friendly saying.</p>

<p>Hauke had no luck with his first throw: just as he was swinging
his arm backward in order to hurl off the ball, a cloud sailed away
which had covered the sun so that now its bright beams shot into his
eyes; the throw was too short, the ball fell on a ditch and remained
stuck in the ice.</p>

<p>"That doesn't count! That doesn't count! Hauke, once more!" called
his partners.</p>

<p>But the score-keeper of the people from the high land protested
against this: "It'll have to count; a throw is a throw!"</p>

<p>"Ole! Ole Peters!" cried the young folks of the marshes. "Where is
Ole? Where the devil is he?"</p>

<p>But there he was: "Don't scream so! Does Hauke have to be patched
up somewhere? I thought as much."</p>

<p>"Never mind! Hauke has to throw again; now show that your tongue
is good for something!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is all right!" cried Ole and stepped up to the scorekeeper
of the other side and talked a lot of bosh. But the pointedness and
sharpness of his usually so scintillating words were absent this
time. Beside him stood the girl with the enigmatic eyebrows and
looked at him sharply with angry glances; but she was not allowed to
talk, for women had no say in the game.</p>

<p>"You are babbling nonsense," cried the other scorekeeper, "because
you can't use any sense for this! Sun, moon and stars are alike for
us all and always in the sky; the throw was awkward, and all awkward
throws have to count!"</p>

<p>Thus they talked back and forth a little while, but the end of it
was that, according to the decision of the umpire, Hauke was not
allowed to repeat his throw.</p>

<p>"Come on!" called the people from the upper land, and their
score-keeper pulled the black stick out of the ground, and the
thrower came forward when his number was called and hurled the ball
ahead. When the head man of the dikemaster wanted to watch the throw,
he had to pass Elke Volkerts: "For whose sake have you left your
brains at home to-day?" she whispered to him.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her almost grimly, and all joking was gone from
his broad face. "For your sake," he said, "for you have forgotten
yours too!"</p>

<p>"Go, go-I know you, Ole Peters!" the girl replied, drawing herself
up straight. But he turned his head away and pretended not to have
heard.</p>

<p>And the game and the black and white stick went on. When Hauke's
turn to throw came again, his ball flew so far, that the goal, the
great whitewashed barrel, came clearly in sight. He was now a solidly
built young fellow, and mathematics and the art of throwing he had
practised daily in his boyhood. "Why, Hauke!" there were cries from
the crowd; "that was just as if the archangel Michael himself had
thrown the ball!" An old woman with cake and brandy pushed her way
through the crowd toward him; she poured out a glass for him and
offered it to him: "Come," she said, "we want to be friends: this
to-day is better than when you killed my cat!" When he looked at her,
he recognised her as Trin Jans. "Thank you, old lady," he said; "but
I don't drink that." He put his hand into his pocket and pressed a
newly minted mark piece into her hand: "Take that and empty your
glass yourself, Trin; and so we are friends!"</p>

<p>"You're right, Hauke!" replied the old woman, while she obeyed his
instructions; "you're right; that's better for an old woman like
me!"</p>

<p>"How are your ducks getting on" he called after her, when she had
already started on her way with her basket; but she only shook her
head, without turning round, and struck the air with her old hands.
"Nothing, nothing, Hauke; there are too many rats in your ditches;
God help me, but I've got to support myself some other way!" And so
she pushed her way into the crowd and again offered her brandy and
honey cake.</p>

<p>The sun had at last gone down behind the dike; in his stead rose a
red violet glimmer; now and then black crows flew by and for moments
looked gilded: evening had come. But on the fens the dark mass of
people were moving still farther away from the already distant houses
toward the barrel; an especially good throw would have to reach it
now. The people of the marshes were having their turn: Hauke was to
throw.</p>

<p>The chalky barrel showed white against the broad evening shadow
that now fell from the dike across the plain.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll leave it to us this time," called one of the
people of the upper land, for it was very close; they had the
advantage of at least ten feet.</p>

<p>Hauke's lean figure was just stepping out of the crowd; the grey
eyes in his long Frisian face were looking ahead at the barrel; in
his hand which hung down he held the ball.</p>

<p>"I suppose the bird is too big for you," he heard Ole Peters's
grating voice in this instant behind his ears; "shall we exchange it
for a grey pot?"</p>

<p>Hauke turned round and looked at him with steady eyes: "I'm
throwing for the marshes," he said. "Where do you belong?"</p>

<p>"I think, I belong there too; I suppose you're throwing for Elke
Volkerts!"</p>

<p>"Go!" shouted Hauke and stood in position again. But Ole pushed
his head still nearer to him. Then suddenly, before Hauke could do
anything against it himself, a hand clutched the intruder and pulled
him back, so that the fellow reeled against his comrades. It was not
a large hand that had done it; for when Hauke turned his head round
for a moment he saw Elke Volkerts putting her sleeve to rights, and
her dark brows looked angry in her heated face.</p>

<p>Now something like steely strength shot into Hauke's arm; he bent
forward a little, rocked the ball a few times in his hand; then he
made the throw, and there was dead silence on both sides. All eyes
followed the flying ball, one could hear it whizz as it cut the air;
suddenly, already far from the starting point, it was covered by the
wings of a silver gull that came flying from the dike with a scream.
At the same time, however, one could hear something bang from a
distance against the barrel.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Hauke!" called the people from the marshes, and cries
went through the crowd: "Hauke! Hauke Haien has won the game!"</p>

<p>He, however, when all were crowding round him, had thrust his hand
to one side to seize another; and even when they called again: "Why
are you still standing there, Hauke? The ball is in the barrel!"-he
only nodded and did not budge from his place. Only when he felt that
the little hand lay fast in his, he said: "You may be right; I think
myself I have won."</p>

<p>Then the whole company streamed back and Elke and Hauke were
separated and pushed on by the crowd along the road to the inn which
ascended from the hill of the dikemaster to the upper land. At this
point both escaped the crowd, and while Elke went up to her room,
Hauke stood in front of the stable door on the hill and saw how the
dark mass of people was gradually wandering up to the parish tavern
where a hall was ready for the dancers. Darkness was slowly spreading
over the wide land; it was growing calmer and calmer round about,
only in the stable behind him the cattle were stirring; from up on
the high land he believed that he could already hear the piping of
the clarinets in the tavern. Then round the corner of the house he
heard the rustling of a dress, and with small steady steps someone
was walking along the path that led through the fens up to the high
land. Now he discerned the figure walking along in the twilight, and
saw that it was Elke; she, too, was going to the dance at the inn.
The blood shot up to his neck; shouldn't he run after her and go with
her? But Hauke was no hero with women; pondering over this problem,
he remained standing still until she had vanished from his sight in
the dark.</p>

<p>Then, when the danger of catching up with her was over, he walked
along the same way until he had reached the inn by the church, where
the chattering and shouting of the crowds in front of the house and
in the hall and the shrill sounds of the violins and clarinets surged
round him and bewildered his senses. Unobserved he made his way into
the Guildhall; but it was not large and so crowded that he could not
look a step ahead of him. Silently he stood by the doorpost and
looked into the restless swarm. These people seemed to him like
fools; he did not have to worry that anyone was still thinking of the
match of this afternoon and about who had won the game only an hour
ago; everybody thought only of his girl and spun round with her in a
circle. His eyes sought only the one, and at last-there! She was
dancing with her cousin, the young dike overseer; but soon he saw her
no longer, only other girls from the marshes or the high land who did
not concern him. Then suddenly the violins and clarinets broke off,
and the dance was over; but immediately another one began. An idea
shot through Hauke's head-he wondered if Elke would keep her word and
if she would not dance by him with Ole Peters. He had almost uttered
a scream at this thought; then-yes, what should he do then? But she
did not seem to be joining in this dance, and at last it was over.
Another one followed, however, a two-step which had just come into
vogue here. The music started up madly, the young fellows rushed to
their girls, the lights flickered along the walls. Hauke strained his
neck to recognise the dancers; and there in the third couple, was Ole
Peters-but who was his partner? A broad fellow from the marshes stood
in front of her and covered her face! But the dance was raging on,
and Ole and his partner were turning out of the crowd. "Vollina!
Vollina Harders!" cried Hauke almost aloud, and drew a sigh of
relief. But where was Elke? Did she have no partner or had she
rejected all because she did not want to dance with Ole? And the
music broke off again, and a new dance began; but she was not in
sight! There came Ole, still with fat Vollina in his arms! "Well,
well," said Hauke; "Jess Harders with his twenty-five acres will soon
have to retire too! But where is Elke?"</p>

<p>He left the doorpost and crowded farther into the hall; suddenly
he was standing in front of her, as she sat with an older girl friend
in a corner. "Hauke!" she called, looking up to him with her narrow
face; "are you here? I didn't see you dance."</p>

<p>"I didn't dance," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why not, Hauke?" and half rising she added: "Do you want to dance
with me? I didn't let Ole Peters do it; he won't come again!"</p>

<p>But Hauke made no move in this direction: "Thank you, Elke," he
said; "I don't know how to dance well enough; they might laugh at
you; and then-" he stopped short and looked at her with his whole
heart in his grey eyes, as if he had to leave it to them to say the
rest.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Hauke?" she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I mean, Elke, the day can't turn out any better for me than it
has done already."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "you have won the game."</p>

<p>"Elke!" he reproached her almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>Then her face flushed crimson: "Go!" she said; "what do you want?"
and she cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>But when Elke's friend was being drawn away to the dance by a
young man, Hauke said louder: "I thought Elke, I had won something
better!"</p>

<p>A few seconds longer her eyes searched the floor; then she raised
them slowly, and a glance met his so full of the quiet power of her
nature that it streamed through him like summer air. "Do as your
heart tells you to, Hauke!" she said; "we ought to know each
other!"</p>

<p>Elke did not dance any more that evening, and then, when both went
home, they walked hand in hand. Stars were gleaming in the sky above
the silent marshes; a light east wind was blowing and bringing severe
cold with it; but the two walked on, without many shawls or
coverings, as if it had suddenly turned spring.</p>

<p>Hauke had set his mind on something the fit use for which lay in
the uncertain future; but he had thought of celebrating with it
quietly by himself. So the next Sunday he went into the city to the
old goldsmith Andersen and ordered a strong gold ring. "Stretch out
your finger for me to measure!" said the old man and seized his
ring-finger. "Well," he said; "yours isn't quite so big as they
usually are with you people!" But Hauke said: "You had better measure
the little finger," and held that one toward him.</p>

<p>The goldsmith looked at him puzzled; but what did he care about
the notions of the young peasant fellows. "I guess we can find one
among the girls' rings" he said, and the blood shot into both of
Hauke's cheeks. But the little gold ring fitted his little finger,
and he took it hastily and paid for it with shining silver; then he
put it into his waistcoat pocket while his heart beat loudly as if he
were performing a ceremony. There he kept it thenceforth every day
with restlessness and yet with pride, as if the waistcoat pocket had
no other purpose than to carry a ring.</p>

<p>Thus he carried it for over a year-indeed, the ring even had to
wander into a new waistcoat pocket; the occasion for its liberation
had not yet presented itself. To be sure, it had occurred to him that
he might go straight to his master; his own father was, after all, a
landholder too. But when he was calmer, he knew very well that the
old dikemaster would have laughed at his second man. And so he and
the dikemaster's daughter lived on side by side-she, too, in maidenly
silence, and yet both as if they were walking hand in hand.</p>

<p>A year after that winter holiday Ole Peters had left his position
and married Vollina Harders. Hauke had been right: the old man had
retired, and instead of his fat daughter his brisk son-in-law was
riding the brown mare over the fens and, as people said, on his way
back always up the dike. Hauke was head man now, and a younger one in
his place. To be sure, the dikemaster at first did not want to let
him move up. "It's better he stays what he is," he had growled; "I
need him here with my books." But Elke had told him: "Then Hauke will
go too, father." So the old man had been scared, and Hauke had been
made head man, although he had nevertheless kept on helping the
dikemaster with his administration.</p>

<p>But after another year he began to talk with Elke about how his
own father's health was failing and told her that the few days in
summer that his master allowed him to help on his father's farm were
not enough; the old man was having a hard time, and he could not see
that any more. It was on a summer evening; both stood in the twilight
under the great ash tree in front of the house door. For a while the
girl looked up silently into the boughs of the tree; then she
replied: "I didn't want to say it, Hauke; I thought you would find
the right thing to do for yourself."</p>

<p>"Then I will have to leave your house," he said, "and can't come
again."</p>

<p>They were silent for a while and looked at the sunset light which
vanished behind the dike in the sea.</p>

<p>"You must know," she said; "only this morning I went to see your
father and found him asleep in his armchair; his drawing pen was in
his hand and the drawing board with a half-finished drawing lay
before him on the table. And when he had waked up and talked to me
with effort for a quarter of an hour, and I wanted to go, then he
held me back by the hand so full of fear, as if he were afraid it was
for the last time; but-"</p>

<p>"But what, Elke?" asked Hauke, when she hesitated to go on.</p>

<p>A few tears ran down the girl's cheeks. "I was only thinking of my
father," she said; "believe me, it will be hard for him to get on
without you." And then added, as if she had to summon her strength
for these words: "It often seems to me as if he too were getting
ready for death."</p>

<p>Hauke said nothing; it seemed to him suddenly, as if the ring were
stirring in his pocket. But even before he had suppressed his
indignation over this involuntary impulse, Elke went on: "No, don't
be angry, Hauke; I trust you won't leave us anyway."</p>

<p>Then he eagerly took her hand, and she did not draw it away. For a
while the young people stood together in the falling darkness, until
their hands slipped apart and each went his way. A gust of wind
started and rustled through the leaves of the ash tree and made the
shutters rattle on the front of the house; but gradually the night
sank down, and quiet lay over the gigantic plain.</p>

<p>Through Elke's persuasion, the old dikemaster had relieved Hauke
of his services, although he had not given notice at the right time,
and two new hired men were in the house. A few months later Tede
Haien died; but before he died, he called his son to his bedside:
"Sit by me, my child;" said the old man with his faint voice, "close
by me! You don't need to be afraid; he who is near me now is only the
dark angel of the Lord who comes to call me."</p>

<p>And his son, deeply affected, sat down close by the dark bed fixed
to the wall: "Tell me, father, what you still have to say."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, there is still something," said the old man and
stretched out his hands across the quilt. "When, as a half-grown boy,
you went to serve the dikemaster, then you had the idea in your head
that you wanted to be one yourself some day. That idea I caught from
you, and gradually I came to think that you were the right man for
it. But your inheritance was too small for such an office. I have
lived frugally during your time of service-I planned to increase it.
"</p>

<p>Passionately Hauke seized his father's hands, and the old man
tried to sit up, so that he could see him. "Yes, yes, my son," he
said; "there in the uppermost drawer of the chest is a document. You
know old Antje Wohlers has a fen of five and a half acres; but she
could not get on with the rent alone in her crippled old age; so I
have always round Martinmas given the poor soul a certain sum, or
more when I could; and for that she gave her fen over to me; it is
all legally settled. Now she too is on her deathbed; the disease of
our marshes, cancer, has seized her; you won't have to pay her any
more."</p>

<p>For a while he closed his eyes; then he spoke once more: "It isn't
much; but you'll have more then than you were accustomed to with me.
May it serve you well in your life on earth!"</p>

<p>With his son's words of thanks in his ears, the old man fell
asleep. He had no more cares: and after a few days the dark angel of
the Lord had closed his eyes forever, and Hauke received his
inheritance.</p>

<p>The day after the funeral Elke came into his house. "Thanks for
looking in, Elke," Hauke greeted her.</p>

<p>But she replied: "I'm not looking in; I want to put things in
order a little, so that you can live decently in your house. Your
father with all his figures and drawings didn't look round much, and
the death too makes confusion. I want to make things a little livable
for you."</p>

<p>His grey eyes looked full of confidence upon her. "All right, put
things in order!" he said; "I like it better that way too."</p>

<p>And then she began to clear up: the drawing board, which was still
lying there, was dusted and carried up to the attic, drawing pens and
pencil and chalk were locked away carefully in a drawer of the chest;
then the young servant girl was called in to help and the furniture
was put into different and better positions in the room, so that it
seemed as if it now had grown lighter and bigger. Smiling, Elke said:
"Only we women can do that," and Hauke in spite of his mourning for
his father, had watched her with happy eyes, and, where there was
need for it, had helped too.</p>

<p>And when toward dusk-it was in the beginning of
September-everything was just as she wanted it for him, she took his
hand and nodded to him with her dark eyes: "Now come and have supper
with us; for I had to promise my father to bring you; then when you
go home, you can enter your house in peace."</p>

<p>Then when they came into the spacious living-room of the
dikemaster, where the shutters were already closed and the two
candles burning on the table, the latter wanted to rise from his
armchair, but his heavy body sank back and he only called to his
former man: "That's right, that's right, Hauke, that you've come to
see your old friends. Come nearer, still nearer." And when Hauke had
stepped up to his chair, he took his hand into both of his own: "Now,
now, my boy," he said, "be calm now, for we all must die, and your
father was none of the worst. But Elke, now see that the roast gets
on to the table; we have to get strength. There's a great deal of
work for us, Hauke! The fall inspection is coming; there's a pile of
dike and sluice bills as high as the house; the damage to the dike of
the western enclosure the other day-I don't know where my head is,
but yours, thank God, is a good bit younger; you're a good boy,
Hauke."</p>

<p>And after this long speech, with which the old man had laid bare
his whole heart, he let himself drop back into his chair and blinked
longingly toward the door, through which Elke was just coming in with
the roast on the platter. Hauke stood smiling beside him. "Now sit
down," said the dikemaster, "so that we won't lose time for nothing;
that doesn't taste well cold."</p>

<p>And Hauke sat down; it seemed to be taken for granted that he
should help to do the work of Elke's father. And when the fall
inspection had come and a few more months of the year were gone, he
had indeed done the greatest part of the work.</p>

<p>The story-teller stopped and looked round. The scream of a gull
had knocked against the window, and out in the hall one could hear a
stamping of feet, as if someone were taking the clay off his heavy
boots.</p>

<p>The dikemaster and the overseers turned their heads toward the
door of the room. "What is it?" called the first.</p>

<p>A strong man with a southwester on his head had stepped in.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "we both have seen it-Hans Nickels and I: the
rider on the white horse has thrown himself into the breach."</p>

<p>"Where did you see that?" asked the dikemaster.</p>

<p>"There is only the one break; in Jansen's fen, where the
Hauke-Haienland begins."</p>

<p>"Did you see it only once?"</p>

<p>"Only once; it was only like a shadow, but that doesn't mean that
this was the first time it happened."</p>

<p>The dikemaster had risen. "You must excuse me," he said, turning
to me, "we have to go out and see what this calamity is leading to."
Then he left the room with the messenger; the rest of the company too
rose and followed him.</p>

<p>I stayed alone with the schoolmaster in the large deserted room;
through the curtainless windows, which were now no longer covered by
the backs of the guests sitting in front of them, one could have a
free view and see how the wind was chasing the dark clouds across the
sky.</p>

<p>The old man remained on his seat, with a superior, almost pitying
smile on his lips. "It is too empty here now," he said; "may I invite
you to my room? I live in this house; and believe me, I know every
kind of weather here by the dike-there is nothing for us to
fear."</p>

<p>This invitation I accepted with thanks, for I too began to feel
chilly, and so we took a light and climbed up the stairs to a room
under the gables; there the windows also looked toward the west, but
they were covered by woollen rugs. In a bookcase I saw a small
library, beside it portraits of two old professors; before a table
stood a great high armchair. "Make yourself comfortable," said my
pleasant host and threw some pieces of peat into the still faintly
glowing stove, which was crowned by a tin kettle on top. "Only wait a
little while! The fire will soon roar; then I'll mix you a little
glass of grog-that'll keep you awake!"</p>

<p>"I don't need that," I said; "I won't grow sleepy, when I
accompany your Hauke upon his life-journey!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" and he nodded toward me with his keen eyes,
after I had been comfortably settled in his armchair.</p>

<p>Well, where did we leave off? Yes, yes; I know. Well, Hauke had
received his inheritance, and as old Antje Wohlers, too, had died of
her ailment, his property was increased by her fen. But since the
death, or rather, since the last words of his father, something had
sprung up within him, the seed of which he had carried in his heart
since his boy-hood; he repeated to himself more often than enough
that he was the right man for the post if there had to be a new
dikemaster. That was it; his father, who had to know, who was the
cleverest man in the village, had added his word, like a last gift to
his heritage. The fen of the Wohlers woman, for which he had to thank
his father too, should be the first stepping-stone to this height.
For, to be sure, even with this-a dikemaster had to be able to show
more real estate! But his father had got on frugally through his
lonely years; and with what he had saved he had made himself owner of
new property. This Hauke could do too, and even more; for his
father's strength had already been spent, but he could do the hardest
work for years. To be sure, even if he should succeed along this
line-on account of the sharp methods he had brought into the
administration of his old employer, he had made no friends in the
village, and Ole Peters, his old antagonist, had just inherited
property and was beginning to be a well-to-do man. A row of faces
passed before his inner vision, and they all looked at him with
hostile eyes. Then a rage against these people seized him: he
stretched out his arms as if he would clutch them, for they wanted to
push him from the office for which he alone, of all, was destined.
These thoughts did not leave him; they were always there again, and
so in his young heart there grew beside honor and love, also ambition
and hate. But these two he locked up deep within him; even Elke
surmised nothing of them.</p>

<p>When the new year had come, there was a wedding; the bride was a
relative of the Haiens, and Hauke and Elke were both invited. Indeed,
at the wedding dinner it happened that, because a nearer relative was
absent, they found themselves seated side by side. Their joy about
this was betrayed only by a smile that flitted over the face of each.
But Elke to-day sat with indifference in the midst of the noise of
chattering and the click of the glasses.</p>

<p>"Is something ailing you?" asked Hauke.</p>

<p>"Oh, really nothing; only there are too many people here for
me."</p>

<p>"But you look so sad!"</p>

<p>She shook her head; then again she said nothing.</p>

<p>Then something like jealousy rose within him on account of her
silence, and secretly, under the overhanging table-cloth, he seized
her hand. She did not draw it away, but clasped it, as if full of
confidence, round his. Had a feeling of loneliness come over her, as
she had to watch the failing body of her father every day? Hauke did
not think of asking her this; but his breathing stopped, as he pulled
the gold ring from his pocket. "Will you let it stay?" he asked
trembling, while he pushed the ring on the ring-finger of the slender
hand.</p>

<p>Opposite them at the table sat the pastor's wife; she suddenly
laid down her fork and turned to her neighbor: "My faith, look at
that girl!" she cried; "she is turning deadly pale!"</p>

<p>But the blood was returning into Elke's face. "Can you wait,
Hauke?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Clever Frisian though he was, he nevertheless had to stop and
think a few seconds. "For what?" he asked then.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well; I don't need to tell you."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said; "yes, Elke, I can wait-if it's within a
human limit."</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I'm afraid, a very near one! Don't talk like that,
Hauke; you are speaking of my father's death!" She laid her other
hand on her breast; "Till then," she said, "I shall wear the gold
ring here; you shan't be afraid of getting it back in my
lifetime!"</p>

<p>Then both smiled, and their hands pressed each other so tightly
that on other occasions the girl would have cried out aloud.</p>

<p>The pastor's wife meanwhile had looked incessantly at Elke's eyes,
which were now glowing like dark fire under the lace fringe of her
little gold brocade cap. But in the growing noise at the table she
had not understood a word; neither did she turn to her partner again,
for she was accustomed not to disturb budding marriages-and this
seemed to be such a case-if only for the sake of the promise of the
wedding-fee for her husband, who did the marrying.</p>

<p>Elke's presentiment had come true; one morning after Easter the
dikemaster Tede Volkerts had been found dead in his bed. When one
looked at his face, one could see written upon it that his end had
been calm. In the last months he had often expressed a weariness of
life; his favorite roast, even his ducks, wouldn't please him any
more.</p>

<p>And now there was a great funeral in the village. Up on the high
land in the burying-ground round the church there was on the western
side a burial-place surrounded by a wrought-iron fence. Upright
against a weeping willow stood a broad blue tombstone upon which was
hewn the image of death with many teeth in the skeleton jaws; beneath
it one could read in large letters: "Ah, death all earthly things
devours, Takes art and knowledge that was ours; The mortal man at
rest here lies-God give, that bless&eacute;d he may rise."</p>

<p>It was the burial-place of the former dikemaster Volkert Tedsen;
now a new grave had been dug in which his son, Tede Volkerts, was to
be buried. And now the funeral procession was coming up from the
marshes, a multitude of carriages from all parish villages. Upon the
first one stood the heavy coffin, and the two shining black horses of
the dikemaster's stable drew it up the sandy hill to the high land;
their tails and manes were waving in the sharp spring breeze. The
graveyard round the church was filled with people up to the ramparts;
even on the walled gate boys were perching with little children in
their arms; all wanted to see the burying.</p>

<p>In the house down in the marshes Elke had prepared the funeral
meal in the best parlour and the living-room. Old wine was set on the
table in front of the plates; by the plate of the dikemaster
general-for he, too, was not missing to-day-and of the pastor there
was a bottle of "Langkork" for each. When everything was ready, she
went through the stable in front of the yard door; she met no one on
the way, for the hired men were at the funeral with two carriages.
Here she stood still and while her mourning clothes were waving in
the spring wind, she watched the last carriages down in the village
drive up to the church. There after a while a great turmoil appeared,
which seemed to be followed by a deadly silence. Elke folded her
hands; now they must be letting the coffin into the grave: "And to
dust thou shalt return!" Inevitably, in a low voice, as if she could
have heard them from up here, she repeated the words. Then her eyes
filled with tears, her hands folded across her breast sank into her
lap. "Our Father, who art in heaven!" she prayed ardently. And when
the Lord's prayer was finished, she stood a long time motionless-she,
now the mistress of this great marsh farm; and thoughts of death and
of life began to struggle within her.</p>

<p>A distant rumbling waked her. When she opened her eyes, she again
saw one carriage after another drive rapidly down from the marshes
and up to her farm. She straightened herself, looked ahead sharply
once more and then went back, as she had come, through the stable
into the solemnly ordered living-rooms. Here too there was nobody;
only through the wall could she hear the bustle of the maids in the
kitchen. The festive board looked so quiet and deserted; the mirror
between the windows had been covered with white scarfs, and likewise
the brass knobs of the stove; there was nothing bright any more in
the room. Elke saw that the doors of the alcove-bed, in which her
father had slept his last sleep were open and she went up and closed
them fast. Almost absently she read the proverb that was written on
them in golden letters between roses and carnations: "If thou thy
day's work dost aright, Then sleep comes by itself at night."</p>

<p>That was from her grandfather! She cast a glance at the sideboard;
it was almost empty. But through the glass doors she could still see
the cut-glass goblet which her father, as he used to tell with
relish, had once won as a prize when riding the ring in his youth.
She took it out and set it in front of the dikemaster general's
plate. Then she went to the window, for already she heard the
carriages drive up the hill; one after the other they stopped in
front of her house, and, more briskly than they had come, the guests
leaped from their seats to the ground. Rubbing their hands and
chattering, all crowded into the room; it was not long before they
sat down at the festive board, where the well-prepared dishes were
steaming-in the best parlor the dikemaster general and the pastor.
And noise and loud talking ran along the table, as if death had never
spread its awful stillness here. Silent, with her eyes upon her
guests, Elke walked round the tables with her maids, to see that
nothing was missing at the funeral meal. Hauke Haien, too, sat in the
living-room with Ole Peters and other small landowners.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, the white pipes were taken out of the
corner and lighted, and Elke was again busy offering the filled
coffee cups to her guests; for there was no economy in coffee,
either, on this day. In the living-room, at the desk of the man just
buried, the dikemaster general stood talking with the pastor and the
white-haired dike overseer Jewe Manners.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said the former; "we have buried the old
dikemaster with honor; but where shall we get the new one? I think,
Manners, you will have to make up your mind to accept this
dignity."</p>

<p>Old Manners smiled and lifted his little black velvet cap from his
white hair: "Mr. Dikemaster General," he said, "the game would be too
short then; when the deceased Tede Volkers was made dikemaster I was
made overseer and have been now for forty years."</p>

<p>"That is no defect, Manners; then you know the affairs all the
better and won't have any trouble with them."</p>

<p>But the old man shook his head: "No, no, your Honor, leave me
where I am, then I can run along with the rest for a few years
longer."</p>

<p>The pastor agreed with him: "Why not give the office," he said,
"to the man who has actually managed the affairs in the last
years?"</p>

<p>The dikemaster general looked at him: "I don't understand you,
pastor!"</p>

<p>But the pastor pointed with his finger to the best parlor, where
Hauke in a slow serious manner seemed to be explaining something to
two older people. "There he stands," he said; "the long Frisian over
there with the keen grey eyes, the bony nose and the high, projecting
forehead. He was the old man's hired man and now has his own little
place; to be sure, he is rather young."</p>

<p>"He seems to be about thirty," said the dikemaster general,
inspecting the man thus presented to him.</p>

<p>"He is scarcely twenty-four," remarked the overseer Manners; "but
the pastor is right: all the good work that has been done with dikes
and sluices and the like in the last years through the office of
dikemaster has been due to him; the old man couldn't do much toward
the end."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said the dikemaster general; "and you think, he would be
the right man to move up into the office of his old master?"</p>

<p>"He would be absolutely the right man," replied Jewe Manners; "but
he lacks what they call here 'clay under one's feet;' his father had
about fifteen, he may well have twenty acres; but with that nobody
has yet been made dikemaster."</p>

<p>The pastor had already opened his mouth, as if he wanted to
object, when Elke Volkers, who had been in the room for a while,
spoke to them suddenly: "Will your Honor allow me a word?" she said
to the dikemaster general; "I am speaking only to prevent a mistake
from turning into a wrong."</p>

<p>"Then speak, Miss Elke," he replied; "wisdom always sounds well
from the lips of pretty girls."</p>

<p>"It isn't wisdom, your Honor; I only want to tell the truth."</p>

<p>"That too one must be able to hear, Miss Elke."</p>

<p>The girl let her dark eyes glance sideways, as if she wanted to
make sure that there were no superfluous ears about: "Your Honor,"
she began then, and her breast heaved with a stronger motion, "my
godfather, Jewe Manners, told you that Hauke Haien owned only about
twenty acres; that is quite true in this moment, but as soon as it
will be necessary, Hauke will call his own just so many more acres as
my father's, now my own farm, contains. All that together ought to be
enough for a dikemaster."</p>

<p>Old Manners stretched his white head toward her, as if he had to
see who was talking there: "What is that?" he said; "child, what are
you talking about?"</p>

<p>But Elke pulled a gleaming gold ring on a black ribbon out of her
bodice: "I am engaged, godfather Manners," she said; "here is my
ring, and Hauke Haien is my betrothed."</p>

<p>"And when-I think I may ask that, as I held you at your baptism,
Elke Volkerts-when did that happen?"</p>

<p>"That happened some time ago; but I was of age, godfather
Manners," she said; "my father's health had already fallen off, and
as I knew him, I thought I had better not get him excited over this;
now that he is with God, he will see that his child is in safekeeping
with this man. I should have kept still about it through the year of
mourning; but for the sake of Hauke and of the diked-in land, I had
to speak." And turning to the dikemaster general, she added: "Your
Honor will please forgive me."</p>

<p>The three men looked at one another; the pastor laughed, the old
overseer limited himself to a "hm, hm!" while the dikemaster general
rubbed his forehead as if he were about to make an important
decision. "Yes, dear miss," he said at last, "but how about marriage
property rights here in this district? I must confess I am not very
well versed in these things at this moment in all this
confusion."</p>

<p>"You don't need to be, your Honor," replied the daughter of the
dikemaster, "before my wedding I shall make my goods over to my
betrothed. I have my little pride too," she added smiling; "I want to
marry the richest man in the village."</p>

<p>"Well, Manners," said the pastor, "I think you, as godfather,
won't mind if I join the young dikemaster with the old one's
daughter!"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head gently: "Our Lord give His blessing!"
he said devoutly.</p>

<p>But the dikemaster general gave the girl his hand: "You have
spoken truly and wisely, Elke Volkerts; I thank you for your firm
explanations and hope to be a guest in your house in the future, too,
on happier occasions than today. But that a dikemaster should have
been made by such a young lady-that is the wonderful part of this
story!"</p>

<p>"Your Honor," replied Elke and looked at the kindly high official
with her serious eyes, "a true man ought to be allowed the help of
his wife!" Then she went into the adjoining parlor and laid her hand
silently in that of Hauke Haien.</p>

<p>Several years had gone by: in the little house of Tede Haien now
lived a vigorous workman with his wife and child; the young
dikemaster Hauke Haien lived with his wife Elke Volkerts on the farm
of her father. In summer the mighty ash tree murmured as before in
front of the house; but on the bench that now stood beneath it, the
young wife was usually seen alone in the evening, sitting with some
sewing in her hands; there was no child yet from this marriage. The
husband had other things to do than to sit in front of his house
door, for, in spite of his having helped in the old man's management
before, there was still a multitude of labors to be done which, in
those other times, he had not found it wise to touch upon; but now
everything had to be cleared up gradually, and he swept with a stiff
broom. Besides that, there was the management of the farm, enlarged
by his own land, especially as he was trying to save a second hired
man. So it came about that, except on Sundays, when they went to
church, the two married people saw each other usually only during
dinner, which Hauke ate with great haste, and at the rise and close
of day; it was a life of continuous work, although one of
content.</p>

<p>Then a troublesome rumor started. When one Sunday, after church, a
somewhat noisy company of young land-owners from the marshes and the
higher land had stayed over their cups at the inn, they talked, when
it came to the fourth and fifth glass, not about the king and the
government, to be sure-they did not soar so high in those days-but
about communal and higher officials, specially about the taxes
demanded of the community. And the longer they talked, the less there
was that found mercy in their eyes, particularly not the new dike
taxes. All the sluices and locks had always held out before, and now
they have to be repaired; always new places were found on the dike
that required hundreds of cartloads of earth-the devil take the whole
affair!</p>

<p>"That's all on account of your clever dikemaster," cried one of
the people of the higher land, "who always goes round pondering and
sticks his finger into every pie!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is tricky and wants to win the favor of the dikemaster
general; but we have caught him!"</p>

<p>"Why did you let him be thrust on you?" said the other; "now you
have to pay in cash."</p>

<p>Ole Peters laughed. "Yes, Marten Fedders, that's the way it is
here, and it can't be helped: the old one was made dikemaster on
account of his father, the new one on account of his wife." The
laughter which ran round the table showed how this sally was
appreciated.</p>

<p>But as it had been spoken at the public table of an inn, it did
not stay there, and it was circulated in the village of the high land
as well as that of the marshes below; and so it reached Hauke. Again
the row of ill-meaning faces passed by his inner eye, and he heard
the laughter round the tavern table more jeering than it really was.
"Dogs!" he shouted, and his eyes looked grimly to the side, as if he
wanted to have these people whipped.</p>

<p>Then Elke laid her hand upon his arm: "Let them be; they all would
like to be what you are."</p>

<p>"That's just it," he replied angrily.</p>

<p>"And," she went on, "didn't Ole Peters better himself by
marriage?"</p>

<p>"He did, Elke; but what he married with Vollina wasn't enough to
be dikemaster on."</p>

<p>"Say rather: he wasn't enough," and Elke turned her husband round
so that he had to look into the mirror, for they stood between the
windows in their room. "There is the dikemaster!" she said; "now look
at him; only he who can manage an office has it."</p>

<p>"You're not wrong," he replied pensively, "and yet-Well, Elke, I
have to go to the eastern lock; the gates won't close again."</p>

<p>He went; but he was not gone long, before the repairing of the
lock was forgotten. Another idea, which he had only half thought out
and carried round with him for years, which, however, had been pushed
back by the urgent affairs of his office, now took hold of him again
and more powerfully than before, as if he had suddenly grown
wings.</p>

<p>Before he was really aware of it himself, he found himself on the
sea-dike a good way south toward the city; the village that lay on
this side had some time ago vanished to the left. He was still
walking on, fixing his eyes constantly on the seaward side of the
broad foreland. If some one had walked beside him, he must have seen
what concentrated mental work was going on behind those eyes. At last
he stood still: the foreland here dwindled into a narrow strip along
the dike. "It will have to work!" he said to himself. "Seven years in
the office-they shan't say any more that I am dikemaster only because
of my wife."</p>

<p>He was still standing there, and his eyes swept sharply and
thoughtfully on all sides over the green foreland. Then he walked
back until, here too, the broad plain that lay before him ended in a
narrow strip of green pastureland. Through this, close by the dike,
shot a strong arm of the sea which divided almost the whole foreland
from the mainland and made it an island; a crude wooden bridge led to
it, so that one could go back and forth with cattle or teams of hay
or grain. It was low tide now, and the golden September sun was
glistening on the strip of wet clay, about a hundred feet broad, and
on the deep channel in the middle of it through which the sea was
even now driving its waters. "That can be damned!" said Hauke to
himself, after he had watched this playing of the water for a while.
Then he looked up, and on from the dike upon which he stood, past the
channel, he drew an imaginary line along the edge of the isolated
land, round toward the south and back again to the east over the
eastern continuation of the channel, up to the dike. But the line
which he had drawn invisibly was a new dike, new also in the
construction of its outline, which as yet existed only in his
head.</p>

<p>"That would make dammed-in land of about a thousand acres," he
said smiling to himself; "not so large; but-"</p>

<p>Another calculation came into his mind: the foreland here belonged
to the community, or rather, a number of shares to the single
members, according to the size of their property in the municipality
or other legal income. He began to count up how many shares he had
received from his father and how many from Elke's father, and how
many he had already bought during his marriage, partly with a dim
foreboding of future gain, partly because of his increased sheep
stock. It was a considerable lot; for he had also bought all of Ole
Peter's shares when the latter had been disgusted because his best
ram had been drowned, once when the foreland had been partly flooded.
What excellent pasture and farm land that must make and how valuable
it would be if it were all surrounded by his new dike! Like
intoxication this idea rose into his brain; but he pressed his nails
into the hollows of his hands and forced his eyes to see clearly and
soberly what lay there before him: a great plain without a dike
exposed to who knew what storms and floods in the next years, and at
its outermost edge a herd of dirty sheep now wandering and grazing
slowly. That meant a heap of work, struggle, and annoyance for him!
In spite of all that, as he was walking on the footpath down from the
dike across the fens toward his hill, he felt as if he were carrying
home a great treasure.</p>

<p>In the hall Elke came to meet him: "How about the lock?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He looked down at her with a mysterious smile: "We shall soon need
another lock," he said; "and sluices and a new dike."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," returned Elke, as they walked into the room;
"what do you want to do, Hauke?"</p>

<p>"I want," he began slowly and then stopped for a second, "I want
the big foreland that begins opposite our place and stretches on
westward to be diked in and made into a solid enclosure. The high
floods have left us in peace for almost a generation now; but when
one of the bad ones comes again and destroys the growth down
there-then all at once there'll be an end to all this glory. Only the
old slackway has let things stay like this till to-day."</p>

<p>She looked at him with astonishment: "Why, you are scolding
yourself!" she said.</p>

<p>"I am, Elke; but till now there were so many other things to
do."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hauke; surely, you have done enough."</p>

<p>He had sat down in the armchair of the old dikemaster, and his
hands were clutching both arms fast.</p>

<p>"Have you the courage for it?" his wife asked him.</p>

<p>"I have that, Elke," he spoke hastily.</p>

<p>"Don't be too hasty, Hauke; that work is a matter of life and
death; and almost all the people will be against you, they won't
thank you for your labor and trouble."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I know that!" he said.</p>

<p>"And if it will only succeed," she cried again, "ever since I was
a child I heard that the channel can't be stopped up, and that
therefore one shouldn't touch it."</p>

<p>"That was an excuse for the lazy ones!" said Hauke; "why shouldn't
one be able to stop up the channel?"</p>

<p>"That I have not heard; perhaps because it goes right through; the
rush of the water is too strong." A remembrance came over her and an
almost mischievous smile gleamed out of her serious eyes: "When I was
a child," she told, "I heard our hired men talk about it once; they
said, if a dam was to hold there, some live thing would have to be
thrown into the hold and diked up with the rest; when they were
building a dike on the other side, about a hundred years ago, a gipsy
child was dammed in that they had bought from its mother for a lot of
money. But now I suppose no one would sell her child."</p>

<p>Hauke shook his head: "Then it is just as well that we have none;
else they would do nothing less than demand it of us."</p>

<p>"They shouldn't get it!" said Elke and folded her arms across her
body as if in fear.</p>

<p>And Hauke smiled; but she asked again: "And the huge cost? Have
you thought of that?"</p>

<p>"I have, Elke; what we will get out of it will far surpass the
cost; even the cost of keeping up the old dike will be covered a good
bit by the new one. We do our own work and there are over eight teams
of horses in the community, and there is no lack of young strong
arms. At least you shan't have made me dikemaster for nothing, Elke;
I want to show them that I am one!"</p>

<p>She had been crouching in front of him and looking at him full of
care; now she rose with a sigh. "I have to go back to my day's work,"
she said, and gently stroked his cheek; "you do yours, Hauke."</p>

<p>"Amen, Elke!" he said with a serious smile; "there is work enough
for us both."</p>

<p>There was truly work enough for both, but the heaviest burden was
now on the man's shoulder. On Sunday afternoons, often too in the
evenings, Hauke sat together with a good surveyor, deep in
calculations, drawings and plans; when he was alone, he did the same
and often did not stop till long after midnight. Then he would slip
into their common sleeping-room-for the stuffy beds fixed to the wall
in the living-room were no longer used in Hauke's household-and his
wife would lie with her eyes closed, pretending to sleep, so that he
would get his rest at last, although she was really waiting for him
with a beating heart. Then he would sometimes kiss her forehead and
say a low word of love, and then lie down to sleep, though sleep
often did not come to him before the first crowing of the cock. In
the winter storms he ran out on the dike with pencil and paper in his
hand, and stood and made drawings and took notes while a gust of wind
would tear his cap from his head and make his long, light hair fly
round his heated face. Soon, as long as the ice did not bar his way,
he rowed with a servant out into the sea and with plumb line and rods
measured the depths of the currents about which he was not yet sure.
Often enough Elke trembled for his life, but when he was safely back,
he could hardly have noticed anything, except by the tight clasp of
her hand or by the bright lightning that gleamed from her usually so
quiet eyes. "Have patience, Elke," he said once when it seemed to him
as if his wife would not let him alone; "I have to have the whole
thing clear to myself before I propose it." Then she nodded and let
him be. There were no less rides into the city, either, to see the
dikemaster general, and all these and the labors for house and farm
were always followed by work late into the night. His intercourse
with other people outside of his work and business vanished almost
entirely; even with his wife it grew less and less. "These are bad
times, and they will last long yet," said Elke to herself and went to
her work.</p>

<p>At last, when sun and spring winds had broken the ice everywhere,
the last work in preparation had been done. The petition to the
dikemaster general, to be seconded by a higher official, contained
the proposal that the foreland should be diked for the promoting of
the general weal, particularly of the diked-in district, as well as
the ruler's treasury, as this would receive in a few years the taxes
from about a thousand acres. This was neatly copied and put into a
firm envelope together with the corresponding drafts and plans of all
the positions, present and future, of the locks and sluices and
everything else that belonged to the project; and this was sealed
with the official seal of the dikemaster.</p>

<p>"Here it is, Elke," said the young dikemaster; "now give it your
blessing."</p>

<p>Elke laid her hand into his: "We want to stand by each other," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, we do."</p>

<p>Then the petition was sent into the city by a messenger on
horseback.</p>

<p>I must call your attention to the fact, dear sir, the
school-master interrupted his account, fixing his eyes pleasantly
upon me, that what I have told you up to this point I have gathered
during my activity of almost forty years in this district from the
traditions of intelligent people or from the tales of their
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. What I am about to tell you
now, so that you may find the right connection between what has gone
before and the final outcome of my story, used to be and is still the
talk of the whole marsh village, as soon as the spinning-wheels begin
to whir round All Saints' Day.</p>

<p>If one stood on the dike, about five or six hundred feet to the
north of the dikemaster's farm, one could, at that time, look a few
thousand feet out over the sea, and somewhat farther from the
opposite shore one could see a little island, which they called
"Jeverssand," or "Jevers Island." Our forefathers of that generation
had used it as a pasture for sheep, for at that time grass was still
growing on it; but even that had stopped, because the low island had
several times been flooded by the sea, and in midsummer too, so that
the growth of grass was stunted and made useless as a sheep pasture.
So it happened that the island had no more visitors except gulls and
other birds and occasionally a sea eagle; and on moonlight nights
from the dike one could only see the light or heavy mists pass over
it. And people believed that, when the moon shone upon the island
from the east, they could recognise a few bleached skeletons of
drowned sheep and that of a horse, although, to be sure, no one could
understand how it had come there.</p>

<p>It was at the end of March that the day laborer from the house of
Tede Haien and Iven Johns, the hired man of the young dikemaster,
stood beside each other at that place and without stirring stared at
the island which could scarcely be recognised in the dim moonshine;
but something out of the ordinary seemed to hold them there. The
laborer put his hands into his pockets and shuddered: "Come, Iven,"
he said; "there's nothing good in that; let us go home."</p>

<p>The other laughed, even though horror sounded through his
laughter: "Oh, bosh, it's a live creature, a big one! Who the devil
has chased it on to the clay out there? Look, now it's stretching its
neck our way! No, it's drooping its head; it is feeding. I'd have
thought, there was nothing to feed on there! What can it be?"</p>

<p>"That's not our business!" replied the other. "Good night, Iven,
if you don't want to go with me; I'm going home!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you've got a wife, you can go into your warm bed! But
I've got a lot of March air in my room!"</p>

<p>"Good night, then," the laborer called back, as he marched home on
the dike. The hired man looked round a few times after his fleeing
companion; but the desire to see something gruesome held him fast.
Then a dark, stocky figure came toward him on the dike from the
village; it was the servant boy of the dikemaster. "What do you want,
Carsten?" the hired man called to him.</p>

<p>"I?-nothing," said the boy; but our master wants to speak to you,
Iven Johns."</p>

<p>The man's eyes were drawn back to the island again. "All right,
I'm coming right off," he said.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at so?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>The man raised his arm and pointed silently to the island. "Oh,
look!" whispered the boy; "there goes a horse-a white horse-the devil
must be riding that-how can a horse get to Jevers Island?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, Carsten; if it's only a real horse!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Iven; look, now it's feeding just like a horse! But who
has brought it there-we have no boats in the village big enough!
Perhaps it's only a sheep; Peter Ohm says by moonlight ten circles of
peat look like a whole village. No, look! Now it's jumping around-it
must be a horse after all!"</p>

<p>Both stood silent for a while, their eyes fixed on what they saw
indistinctly going on upon yonder island. The moon stood high in the
heavens and shone upon the wide sea what was just beginning, as the
tide rose, to wash with its waters over the glistening flats of clay.
Only the low murmur of the water, not the sound of a single animal
was heard here in the vast open; on the marshes behind the dike, too,
all was deserted, and cows and oxen were still in their stalls.
Nothing stirred; only the thing that they took for a horse-a white
horse-seemed to be moving on Jevers Island. "It is growing lighter,"
the hired man broke into the silence; "I can see the white sheeps'
skeletons shimmer distinctly!"</p>

<p>"I too," said the boy and stretched his neck; but then, as if it
came over him suddenly, he pulled the man by the sleeve. "Iven," he
gasped, "the horse skeleton, that used to lie there too-where is
that? I can't see it!"</p>

<p>"I don't see it either. Strange!" said the man.</p>

<p>"Not so strange, Iven! Sometimes, I don't know in what nights, the
bones are supposed to rise and act as if they were alive!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the man; "that's an old wives' story!"</p>

<p>"May be, Iven," said the boy.</p>

<p>"But I thought you were sent to get me. Come, we have to go home.
It always stays the same, anyway."</p>

<p>The man could not get the boy away until he had turned him round
by force and pushed him on to the way. "Listen, Carsten," said the
former, when the ghostly island lay a good way behind him, "you are
supposed to be a good sport; I believe you would like to inspect
these doings yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carsten, still shuddering a little. "Yes, I'd like
to do that, Iven."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that? Then," said the man after he had given
his hand to the boy emphatically, "we'll take our boat to-morrow
evening; you row to Jeverssand; I'll stay on the dike in the
meantime."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy, "that'll work! I'll take my whip with
me."</p>

<p>"Do that."</p>

<p>Silently they came near the house of their employers, to which
they slowly climbed up the high hill.</p>

<p>At the same hour on the following night the hired man sat on the
big stone in front of the stable door, when the boy came to him,
snapping his whip. "What a strange sound!" said the former.</p>

<p>"I should say-take care!" returned the boy; "I have stuck nails
into the string, too."</p>

<p>"Then come," said the other.</p>

<p>As on the night before, the moon stood in the eastern sky and
looked down with a clear light. Soon both were not on the dike again
and looked over to Jevers Island, that looked like a strip of mist in
the water. "There it goes again," said the man; "I was here in the
afternoon, and then it wasn't there; but I saw the white horse
skeleton lying there distinctly!"</p>

<p>The boy stretched his neck: "That isn't there now, Iven," he
whispered.</p>

<p>"Well, Carsten, how is it?" said the man. "Are you still keen on
rowing over?"</p>

<p>Carsten stopped to think a moment; then he struck the air with his
whip: "Go ahead and slip the mooring, Iven."</p>

<p>But over yonder it seemed as if the creature moving there were
stretching its neck and raising its head toward the mainland. They
were not seeing it any more; they were already walking down the dike
to the place where the boat was moored. "Now get in," said the man,
after he had slipped the mooring. "I'll wait till you are back.
You'll have to land on the eastern side; that's where one always
could land." And the boy nodded silently and rowed away into the
moonlit night with his whip; the man wandered back to the foot of the
dike and climbed on to it again at the place where they had stood
before. Soon he saw how the boat was moored at a steep, dark place,
where a broad creek flowed out, and how a stocky figure leaped
ashore. Didn't it seem as if the boy were snapping his whip? But
then, too, it might be the sound of the rising flood. Several hundred
feet to the north he saw what they had taken for a white horse; and
how-yes, the figure of the boy came marching straight up to it. Now
it raised its head as if it were startled; and the boy-now one could
hear it plainly-snapped his whip. But-what was he doing? He was
turning round, he was going back the same way he had come. The
creature over there seemed to graze on unceasingly; no sound of
neighing could be heard; sometimes it seemed as if strips of water
were drawn across the apparition. The man gazed as if spellbound.</p>

<p>Then he heard the arrival of the boat at the shore he was on, and
soon in the dusk he saw the boy climb toward him up the dike. "Well,
Carsten," he asked, "what was it?"</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. "It was nothing!" he said. "From the boat
I saw it a short way off; but then, when I was on the island-the
devil knows where that animal has hid himself! The moonlight was
bright enough; but when I came to that place there was nothing there
but the pale bones of a half dozen sheep, and a little farther away
lay the horse skeleton, too, with its white, long skull and let the
moon shine into its empty sockets."</p>

<p>"Hm!" replied the man; "are you sure you saw right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Iven, I stood in the place; a forlorn bird that had cowered
behind the skeleton for the night flew up screaming so that I was
startled and snapped my whip after it a few times."</p>

<p>"And that was all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Iven; I don't know any more."</p>

<p>"It is enough, too," said the man, then he pulled the boy toward
him by the arm and pointed over to the island. "Do you see something
over there, Carsten?"</p>

<p>"It's true, there it goes again."</p>

<p>"Again?" said the man; "I've been looking over there all the time,
and it hasn't been away at all; you went right up to the
monster."</p>

<p>The boy stared at him; all at once horror was in his usually so
pert face, and this did not escape the man. "Come," said the latter
"let's go home: from here it looks alive and over there is nothing
but bones-that's more than you and I can grasp. But keep quiet about
it, one mustn't talk of these things."</p>

<p>They turned round and the boy trotted beside him; they did not
speak, and by their side the marshes lay in perfect silence.</p>

<p>But when the moon had vanished and the nights were black,
something else happened.</p>

<p>At the time when the horse market was going on Hauke Haien had
ridden into the city, although he had had nothing to do with the
market. Nevertheless, when the came home toward evening, he brought
home a second horse. It had rough hair, however, and was lean, so
that one could count every rib and its eyes looked tired and sunken
deep into the sockets. Elke had stepped out in front of the house
door to meet her husband: "Heaven help us!" she cried, "what shall we
do with that old white horse?" For when Hauke had ridden up to the
house with it and stopped under the ash tree, she had seen that the
poor creature was lame, too.</p>

<p>The young dikemaster, however, jumped laughing down from his brown
horse: "Never mind, Elke; it didn't cost much, anyway."</p>

<p>The clever woman replied: "You know, the greatest bargain turns
out to be the most expensive."</p>

<p>"But not always, Elke; this animal is at most four years old; look
at it more carefully. It is starved and has been abused; our oats
shall do it good. I'll take care of it myself, so that they won't
overfeed it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the animal stood with bowed head; its long mane hung
down its neck. Elke, while her husband was calling the hired men,
walked round it with curious eyes; but she shook her head: "A horse
like this has never yet been in our stable."</p>

<p>When the servant boy came round the corner, he suddenly stood
still with frightened eyes. "Well, Carsten," called the dikemaster,
"what has struck you? Don't you like my white horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes-oh, yes, master, why not?"</p>

<p>"Then take the animal into the stable; don't feet it. I'll come
myself right off."</p>

<p>The boy took hold of the halter of the white horse carefully and
then hastily, as if for protection, seized the bridle of the brown
horse also put into his trust. Hauke then went into the room with his
wife. She had warm beer ready for him, and bread and butter were
there, too.</p>

<p>He had soon finished; then he got up and walked up and down the
room with his wife. "Let me tell you, Elke," he said, while the
evening glow played on the tiles of the wall, "how I came to get the
animal. I spent about an hour at the dikemaster general's; he has
good news for me-there will be some departures, here and there, from
my drawings; but the main thing, my outline, has been accepted, and
the next days may bring the command to begin the new dike."</p>

<p>Elke sighed involuntarily. "After all?" she said, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, wife," returned Hauke; "it will be hard work; but for that,
I think, the Lord has brought us together! Our farm is in such good
order now, you can take a good part of it on your own shoulders.
Think ahead ten years-then we'll own quite a different property."</p>

<p>During his first words she had pressed her husband's hand into
hers as a sign of assurance; but his last words could give her no
pleasure. "For whom all the property?" she said. "You would have to
take another wife then; I shall bring you no children."</p>

<p>Tears shot into her eyes; but he drew her close into his arms.
"We'll leave that to the Lord," he said; "but now and at that time
too, we are young enough to have joy for ourselves in the fruits of
our labors."</p>

<p>She looked at him a long time with her dark eyes while he held
her. "Forgive me, Hauke," she said; "sometimes I am a woman in
despair."</p>

<p>He bent down to her face and kissed her: "You are my wife and I am
your husband, Elke. And nothing can alter that."</p>

<p>Then she clasped her arms tightly round his neck: "You are right,
Hauke, and what comes, will come for us both." Then she freed him,
blushing. "You wanted to tell me about the white horse," she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"So I did, Elke, I told you, my head and heart were full of joy
over the good news that the dikemaster general had given me. So I was
riding back again out of the city, when on the dam, behind the
harbor, I met a shabby fellow-I couldn't tell if he was a vagabond, a
tinker, or what. This fellow was pulling the white horse after him by
the halter; but the animal raised his head and looked at me with dull
eyes. It seemed to me as if he wanted to beg me for something-and,
indeed, at that moment I was rich enough. 'Hallo, good sir,' I hailed
him, 'where do you want to go with your jade?'</p>

<p>"The fellow stopped, and the white horse, too. 'Sell him,' he
said, and nodded to me slyly.</p>

<p>"'But spare me!' I called cheerfully.</p>

<p>"'I think I shall!' he said; 'it's a good horse and worth no less
than a hundred dollars.'</p>

<p>"I laughed into his face.</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'don't laugh so hard; you don't need to pay it.
But I have no use for it, it'll perish with me; with you it would
soon look different.'</p>

<p>"Then I jumped down from my brown horse and looked into the white
horse's mouth and saw that it was still a young animal. 'How much do
you want for it?' I cried, for again the horse seemed to look at me
beseechingly.</p>

<p>"'Sir, take it for thirty dollars,' said the fellow, and I'll give
you the halter to the bargain.'</p>

<p>"And then, wife, I took the fellow's stretched-out brown hand,
which looked almost like a claw. And so we have the white horse, and
I think a good enough bargain. The only strange thing was that, when
I rode away with the horses, I soon heard laughter behind me, and
when I turned round my head, saw the Slovak standing with his legs
apart, his arms on his back, and laughing after me like a devil.</p>

<p>"Oh, horror," cried Elke; "I hope that white horse will bring you
nothing from his old master. May he thrive for your good, Hauke!"</p>

<p>"Thrive he shall, at least as far as I can make him!" And the
dikemaster went into the stable, as he had told the boy a while
ago.</p>

<p>But not only on the first night did he feed the white horse-from
that time on he always did it himself and did not leave the animal
out of sight. He wanted to show that he had mad a first-rate bargain;
anyway, he did not want to allow any mistake. And already after a few
weeks the animal's condition improved: gradually the rough hair
vanished; a smooth, blue-spotted skin appeared, and one day when he
led it round on the place, it walked nimbly on its steady legs. Hauke
thought of the adventurous seller. "That fellow was a fool, or a
knave who had stolen it," he murmured to himself. Then soon, when the
horse merely heard his footsteps, it threw back its head and neighed
to greet him; and now he saw too that it had, what the Arabs demand
of a good horse, a spare face, out of which two fiery brown eyes were
gleaming. He would lead it into its stable and put a light saddle on
it; and scarcely did he sit on the saddle, when the animal uttered a
neigh like a shout of delight. It sped away with him, down the hill
to the road and then to the dike; but the rider sat securely, and
when they had reached the top, it went more quietly, easily, as if
dancing, and thrust its head to the side of the sea. He patted and
stroked its smooth neck, but it no longer needed these endearments,
the horse seemed altogether to be one with the rider, and after he
had ridden a distance northwards out on the dike, he turned it easily
and reached the farm again.</p>

<p>The men stood at the foot of the hill and waited for the return of
their master. "Now, John," he cried, as he leaped down from his
horse. "you ride it to the fens where the others are; it'll carry you
like a cradle."</p>

<p>The white horse shook its head and neighed aloud over the sunny
marshes, while the hired man was taking off the saddle and the boy
ran with it to the harness-room; then it laid its head on its
master's shoulder and suffered him to caress it. But when the hired
man wanted to swing himself on its back, it leaped to the side with a
sudden bound and then stood motionless, turning its beautiful eyes on
its master. "Hallo, Iven," cried Hauke, "has he hurt you?" and he
tried to help his man up from the ground.</p>

<p>The latter was busily rubbing his hip: "No, sir, I can manage
still; but let the devil ride that white horse!"</p>

<p>"And me!" Hauke added, laughing. "Then bring him to the fens by
the bridle."</p>

<p>"And when the man obeyed, somewhat humiliated, the white horse
meekly let itself be led.</p>

<p>A few evenings later the man and the boy stood together in front
of the stable door. The sunset gleam had vanished behind the dike,
the land it enclosed was already wrapped in twilight; only at rare
intervals from far off one could hear the lowing of a startled bull
or the scream of a lark whose life was ending through the assault of
a weasel or a water rat. The man was leaning against the doorpost and
smoking his short pipe, from which he could no longer see the smoke;
he and the boy had not yet talked together. Something weighed on the
boy's soul, however, but he did not know how to begin with the silent
man. "Iven," he said finally, "you know that horse skeleton on
Jeverssand."</p>

<p>"What about it?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, Iven, what about it? It isn't there any more-neither by day
nor by moonlight; I've run up to the dike about twenty times."</p>

<p>"The old bones have tumbled to pieces, I suppose," said Iven and
calmly smoked on.</p>

<p>"But I was out there by moonlight, too; nothing is moving over
there on Jeverssand, either!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" said the man, "if the bones have fallen apart, it
won't be able to get up any more."</p>

<p>"Don't joke, Iven! I know now; I can tell you where it is."</p>

<p>The man turned to him suddenly: "Well, where is it, then?"</p>

<p>"Where?" repeated the boy emphatically. "It is standing in our
stable; there it has been standing, ever since it was no more on the
island. It isn't for nothing that our master always feeds it himself;
I know about it, Iven."</p>

<p>For a while the man puffed away violently into the night. "You're
not right in your mind, Carsten," he said then; "our white horse? If
ever a horse was alive, that one is. How can a wide-awake youngster
like you get mixed up with such an old wives' belief!"</p>

<p>But the boy could not be converted: if the devil was inside the
white horse, why shouldn't it be alive? On the contrary, it was all
the worse. He started, frightened, every time that he stepped into
the stable toward night, where the creature was sometimes kept in
summer and it turned its fiery head toward him so violently. "The
devil take you!" he would mutter; "we won't stay together much
longer!"</p>

<p>So he secretly looked round for a new place, gave notice and,
about All Saints' Day, went to Ole Peters as hired man. Here he found
attentive listeners for his story of the dikemaster's devil's horse.
Fat Mrs. Vollina and her dull-witted father, the former dike
overseer, Jess Harders, listened in smug horror and afterwards told
it to all who had a grudge against the dikemaster in their hearts or
who took pleasure in that kind of thing.</p>

<p>In the mean time already at the end of March the order to begin on
the new dike had arrived from the dikemaster general. Hauke first
called the dike overseers together, and in the inn up by the church
they had all appeared one day and listened while he read to them the
main points from the documents that had been drawn up so far: points
from his petition from the report of the dikemaster general, and
lastly the final order in which, above all, the outline which he had
proposed was accepted, so that the new dike should not be steep like
the old ones, but slant gradually toward the sea. But they did not
listen with cheerful or even satisfied faces.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said an old dike overseer, "here we have the whole
business now, and protests won't do any good, because the dikemaster
general patronises our dikemaster."</p>

<p>"You're right, Detlev Wiens," added a second; "our spring work is
waiting, and now a dike miles long is to be made-then everything will
have to be left undone."</p>

<p>"You can finish all that this year," said Hauke; "things don't
move as fast as that."</p>

<p>Few wanted to admit that. "But your profile," said a third,
bringing up something new; "the dike will be as broad on the outside
toward the water as other things are long. Where shall we get the
material? When shall the work be done?"</p>

<p>"If not this year, then next year; that will depend chiefly on
ourselves," said Hauke.</p>

<p>Angry laughter passed along the whole company. "But what is all
that useless labor for? The dike isn't supposed to be any bigger than
the old one;" cried a new voice; "and I'm sure that's stood for over
thirty years."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Hauke, "thirty years ago the old dike broke;
then backwards thirty-five years ago, and again forty-five years ago;
but since then, although it is still standing steep and senseless,
the highest floods have spared us. But the new dike is to stand in
spite of such floods for hundreds of years; for it will not be broken
through; because the gentle slope toward the sea gives the waves no
point of attack, and so you will gain safe land for yourselves and
your children, and that is why the government and the dikemaster
general support me-and, besides, that is what you ought to be aware
of for your own profit."</p>

<p>When the assembled were not ready on the spot to answer these
words, an old white-haired man rose with difficulty from his chair.
It was Elke's godfather, Jewe Manners, who, in response to Hauke's
beseeching, had kept his office as dike overseer.</p>

<p>"Dikemaster Hauke Haien," he said, "you give us much commotion and
expense, and I wish you had waited with all this until the Lord had
called me to rest; but-you are right, and only unreason can deny
that. We ought to thank God every day that He has kept us our
precious piece of foreland against storms and the force of the tide,
in spite of our idleness; now, I believe, is the eleventh hour, in
which we must lend a hand and try to save it for ourselves to the
best of our knowledge and powers, and not defy God's patience any
longer. I, my friends, am an old man; I have seen dikes built and
broken; but the dike that Hauke Haien has proposed according to his
God-given insight and has carried through with the government-that
dike none of you living men will see broken. And if you don't want to
thank him yourselves, your grandchildren some day will not deny him
his laurel wreath."</p>

<p>Jewe Manners sat down again; he took his blue handkerchief from
his pocket and wiped a few drops from his forehead. The old man was
still known as a man of efficiency and irreproachable integrity, and
as the assembly was not inclined to agree with him, it remained
silent. But Hauke Haien took the floor, though all saw that he had
grown pale.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Jewe Manners," he said, "for staying here and for
what you have said. You other gentlemen, have the goodness at least
to consider the building of the new dike, which indeed will be my
burden, as something that cannot be helped any more, and let us
decide accordingly what needs to be done."</p>

<p>"Speak!" said one of the overseers. And Hauke spread the map of
the new dike out on the table.</p>

<p>"A while ago someone has asked," he began, "from where we shall
get the soil? You see, as far as the foreland stretches out into the
flooded district, a strip of land is left free outside of the dike
line; from this we can take our soil and from the foreland which runs
north and south along the dike from the new enclosed land. If we have
a good layer of clay at the water side, at the inside and the middle
we can take sand. Now first we have to get a surveyor to mark off the
line of the new dike on the foreland. The one who helped me work out
my plan will be best suited for the work. Furthermore we have to
order some one-horse tip-carts at a cartwright's for the purpose of
getting our clay and other material. For damming the channel and also
for the inside, where we may have to use sand, we shall need-I cannot
tell now how many cartloads of straw for the dike, perhaps more than
can be spared in the marshes. Let us discuss then now how all this is
to be acquired and arranged. The new lock here, too, on the west side
toward the water will have to be given over to an efficient carpenter
later for repairs."</p>

<p>The assembly gathered round the table, looked at the map with half
attention and gradually began to talk; but it seemed as if they did
it merely so that there might be some talking. When it came to the
choice of a surveyor, one of the younger ones remarked: "You have
thought it out, dikemaster; you must know best yourself who is fit
for it."</p>

<p>But Hauke replied: "As you are sworn men, you have to speak your
own opinion, Jacob Meyen; and if you think of something better, I'll
let my proposal fall."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess it'll be all right," said Jacob Meyen.</p>

<p>But one of the older ones did not think it would be so perfectly
all right. He had a nephew, a surveyor, the like of whom had never
been in the marshes, who was said to surpass the dikemaster's father,
the late Tede Haien.</p>

<p>So there was a discussion about the two surveyors and it was
finally decided to let both do the work together. There was similar
disputing over the carts, the furnishing of the straw and everything
else, and Hauke came home late and almost exhausted on his brown
horse which he was still riding at that time. But when he sat in the
old armchair, handed down from his self-important but more easy-going
predecessor, his wife was quickly at his side: "You look tired,
Hauke, she said, and with her slender hand pushed his hair out of his
forehead.</p>

<p>"A little, I suppose," he replied.</p>

<p>"And is it getting on?"</p>

<p>"It'll get on;" he said with a bitter smile; "but I myself have to
push the wheels and have to be glad if they aren't kept back."</p>

<p>"But not by all?"</p>

<p>"No, Elke; your godfather, Jewe Manners, is a good man; I wish he
were thirty years younger."</p>

<p>When after a few weeks the dike line had been marked off and most
of the carts had been furnished, the dikemaster had gathered together
in the inn by the church all the shareholders of the land to be diked
in and also the owners of the land behind the old dike. He wanted to
present to them a plan for the distribution of the work and the cost
and to hear their possible objections; for the owners of the old land
had to bear their part of the labor land the cost because the new
dike and the new sluices would lessen the running expenses of the
older ones. This plan had been a hard piece of work for Hauke and if
he had not been given a dike messenger and a dike clerk through the
mediation of the dikemaster general, he could not have accomplished
it so soon, although again he was working well into the night. When
he went to bed, tired to death, his wife no longer waited for him
with feigned sleep; she, too, had such a full share of daily work
that she lay, as if at the bottom of a deep well, in a sleep that
could not be disturbed.</p>

<p>Now Hauke read his plan and again spread his papers out on the
table-papers which, to be sure, had already lain for three days in
the inn for inspection. Some serious men were present, who regarded
this conscientious diligence with awe, and who, after quiet
consideration, submitted to the low charge of the dikemaster. But
others, whose shares in the new land had been sold either by
themselves or their fathers or someone else who had bought them,
complained because they had to pay part of the expenses of the new
diked-in land which no longer concerned them, not thinking that
through the new work the old lands would be less costly to keep up.
Again there were others who were blessed with shares for the new land
who clamoured that one should buy these of them for very little,
because they wanted to be rid of shares that burdened them with such
unreasonable labor. Old Peters who was leaning against the doorpost
with a grim face, shouted into the midst: "Think first and then trust
in our dikemaster! He knows how to calculate; he already had most of
the shares, then he was clever enough to get mine at a bargain, and
when he had them, he decided to dike in the new land."</p>

<p>After these words for a moment a deadly silence fell upon the
assembly. The dikemaster stood by the table where he had spread out
his papers before; he raised his head and looked over to Old Peters:
"You know very well, Ole Peters," he said, "that you are libeling me;
you are doing it just the same, because you know that, nevertheless,
a good part of the dirt you are throwing at me will cling to me. The
truth is that you wanted to be rid of your shares, and that at that
time I needed them for my sheep raising. And if you want to know more
I will tell you that the dirty words which escaped your lips here at
the inn, namely that I was made dikemaster only on account of my
wife-that they have stirred me up and I wanted to show you all that I
could be dikemaster on my own account. And so, Ole Peters, I have
done what the dikemaster before me ought to have done. If you are
angry, though, because at that time your shares were made mine-you
hear now, there are enough who want to sell theirs cheaply, because
the work connected with them is too much."</p>

<p>There was applause from a small part of the assembled men, and old
Jewe Manners, who stood among them, cried aloud: "Bravo, Hauke Haien!
The Lord will let your work succeed!"</p>

<p>But they did not finish after all, although Ole Peters was silent,
and the people did not disperse till supper time. Not until they had
a second meeting was everything settled, and then only after Hauke
had agreed to furnish four teams in the next month instead of the
three that were his share.</p>

<p>At last, when the Whitsuntide bells were ringing through the land,
the work had begun: unceasingly the dumpcarts were driven from the
foreland to the dike line, there to dump the clay, and in the same
way an equal number was driven back to get new clay from the
foreland. At the line of the dike itself men stood with shovels and
spades in order to put the dumped clay into its right place and to
smooth it. Huge loads of straw were driven up and taken down. This
straw was not only used to cover the lighter material, like sand and
loose earth, which was used for the inside; gradually single pieces
of the dike were finished, and the sod with which they were covered
was in places securely overlaid with straw as a protection against
the gnawing waves. Inspectors engaged for the purpose walked back and
forth, and when it was stormy, they stood with wide open mouths and
shouted their orders through wind and storm. In and out among them
rode the dikemaster on his white horse, which he now used
exclusively, and the animal flew back and forth with its rider, while
he have his orders quickly and drily, praised the workmen, or, as it
happened sometimes, dismissed a lazy or clumsy man without mercy.
"That can't be helped!" he would cry; "we can't have the dike spoiled
on account of your laziness!" From far, when he came up from the
enclosed land below, they heard the snorting of his horse, and all
hands went to work more briskly. "Come on, get to work! There's the
rider on the white horse!"</p>

<p>During breakfast time, when the workmen sat together in masses on
the ground, with their morning bread, Hauke rode along the deserted
works, and his eyes were sharp to spy where slovenly hands had used
the spade. Then when he rode up to the men and explained to them how
the work ought to be done, they would look up at him and keep on
chewing their bread patiently; but he never heard a word of assent or
even any remark. Once at this time of day, though rather late, when
he had found the work on a part of the dike particularly well done,
he rode to the nearest assembly of breakfasting men, jumped down from
his white horse and asked cheerfully who had done such a neat day's
work. But they only looked at him shyly and sombrely and only slowly,
as if against their will, a few names were given. The man to whom he
had given his horse, which stood as meekly as a lamb, held it with
both hands and looked as if he were frightened at the animal's
beautiful eyes fixed, as usual, upon its master.</p>

<p>"Well, Marten," Hauke called to him: "why do you stand there as if
you had been thunderstruck?"</p>

<p>"Sir, your horse is so calm, as if it were planning something
bad!"</p>

<p>Hauke laughed and took the horse by the reins himself, when
immediately it rubbed its head caressingly against his shoulder. Some
of the workmen looked shyly at horse and rider, others ate their
morning meal silently, as if all this were no concern of theirs, and
now and then threw a crumb to the gulls who had remembered this
feeding place and with their slender wings almost descended on the
heads of the men. For a while the dikemaster gazed absently at the
begging birds as they chased with their bills the bits thrown at
them; then he leaped to his saddle and rode away, without turning
round to look at the men. Some of the words that now were being
spoken among them sounded to him like derision. "What can that mean?"
he spoke to himself. "Was Elke right when she said that all were
against me? These laborers and poorer people, too, many of whom will
be well off through my new dike?"</p>

<p>He spurred on his horse, which flew down into the enclosed land as
if it were mad. To be sure, he himself knew nothing of the uncanny
glamour with which the rider of the white horse had been clothed by
his former servant boy; but now the people should have seen him, with
his eyes staring out of his haggard face, his coat fluttering on his
fiery white horse.</p>

<p>Thus summer and autumn had passed and until toward the end of
November the work had been continued; then frost and snow had put a
stop to the labors and it was decided to leave the land that was to
be diked in, open. Eight feet the dike rose above the level of the
land. Only where the lock was to be made on the west side toward the
water, a gap had been left; the channel up in front of the old dike
had not yet been touched. So the flood could make its way into the
enclosed land without doing it or the new dike either any great
damage. And this work of human hands was entrusted to the great God
and put under His protection until the spring sun should make
possible its completion.</p>

<p>In the mean time a happy event had been expected in the house of
the dikemaster: in the ninth year of his marriage a child had been
born. It was red and shrivelled and weighed seven pounds, as new-born
children should when they belong, as this one did, to the female sex;
only its crying was strangely muffled and did not please the wise
woman. The worst of all was that on the third day Elke was seized
with high childbed fever, was delirious and recognised neither her
husband nor her old helper. The unbounded joy that had come over
Hauke at the sight of his child had turned to sorrow. The doctor from
the city was called, he sat at her bedside and felt her pulse and
looked about helplessly. Hauke shook his head: "He won't help; only
God can help!" He had thought out a Christianity of his own, but
there was something that kept back his prayer. When the old doctor
had driven away, Hauke stood by the window, staring out into the
wintry day, and while the patient was screaming in her delirium, he
folded his hands-he did not know whether he did so in devotion or so
as not to lose himself in his terrible fear.</p>

<p>"The sea! The sea!" wailed the patient. "Hold me!" she screamed;
"hold me, Hauke!" Then her voice sank; it sounded, as if she were
crying: "Out on the sea, on the wide sea. Oh, God, I'll never see him
again!"</p>

<p>Then he turned round and pushed the nurse from the bed; he fell on
his knees, clasped his wife and drew her to his heart: "Elke, Elke,
don't you know me? I am with you!"</p>

<p>But she only opened wide her eyes glowing with fever and looked
about, as if hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>He laid her back on her pillows; then he pressed his hands
together convulsively: "Lord, my God," he cried; "don't take her from
me! Thou knowest, I cannot live without her!" Then it seemed as if a
thought came to him, and he added in a lower voice: "I know well Thou
canst not always do as Thou wouldst-not even Thou; Thou art all-wise;
Thou must act according to Thy wisdom. Oh Lord, speak to me through a
breath!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if there were a sudden calm. He only heard low
breathing; when he turned to the bed, he saw his wife lying in a
quiet sleep and the nurse looking at him with horrified eyes. He
heard the door move.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sir, the maid Ann Grethe went out; she had brought in the
warming-pan."</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so in such confusion, Madame Levke?"</p>

<p>"I? I was frightened by your prayer; with that you can't pray
death away from anybody!"</p>

<p>Hauke looked at her with his penetrating eyes: "Do you, too, like
our Ann Grethe, go to the conventicle at the Dutch tailor
Jantje's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we both have the living faith!"</p>

<p>Hauke made no reply. The practise of holding seceding
conventicles, which at that time was in full swing, had also
blossomed out among the Frisians. "Down-and-out" artisans and
schoolmasters dismissed as drunkards played the leading parts, and
girls, young and old women, lazy and lonely people went eagerly to
the secret meetings at which anybody could play the priest. Of the
dikemaster's household Ann Gerthe and the servant boy in love with
her spent their free evenings there. To be sure, Elke had not
concealed her doubtful opinion of this from Hauke, but he had said
that in matters of faith one ought not to interfere with anyone: this
could not hurt anybody, and it was better to have them go there than
to the inn for whiskey.</p>

<p>So he had let it be, and so he had kept silent even now. But, to
be sure, people were not silent about him; the words of his prayer
were spread from house to house. He had denied the omnipotence of
God; what was a God without omnipotence? He was a denier of God; that
affair with the devil's horse may have something in it after all!</p>

<p>Hauke heard nothing of all this; his ears and eyes were open only
for his wife in these days, even his child did not exist for him any
more.</p>

<p>The old doctor came again, came every day, sometimes twice, then
stayed a whole night, again wrote a prescription and Iven Johns
swiftly rode with it to the apothecary. But finally the doctor's face
grew more cheerful, and he nodded confidentially to the dikemaster:
"She'll pull through. She'll pull through, with God's help!" And one
day-whether it was because his skill had conquered her illness or
because in answer to Hauke's prayer God had been able after all to
find a way out of his trouble-when the doctor was alone with the
patient, he spoke to her, while his old eyes smiled: "Lady, now I can
safely say to you: to-day the doctor has his gala-day; things looked
very darkly for you, but now you belong to us again, to the
living!"</p>

<p>Then a flood of light streamed out of her dark eyes; "Hauke,
Hauke, where are you?" she cried, and when, in response to her loud
cry, he rushed into the room and to her bed, she flung her arms round
his neck: "Hauke, my husband-saved! I can stay with you!" then the
old doctor pulled his silk handkerchief out of his pocket, wiped his
forehead and cheeks with it and nodding left the room.</p>

<p>On the third evening after this day a pious speaker-it was a
slippermaker who had once been dismissed by the dikemaster-spoke at
the conventicle held at the Dutch tailor's, where he explained to his
audience the attributes of God: "But he who denies the omnipotence of
God, who says: "I know Thou canst not as Thou wouldst"-we all know
the unhappy man; he weighs like a stone on the community-he has
fallen off from God and seeks the enemy of God, the friend of sin, as
his comforter; for the hand of man has to lean upon some staff. But
you-beware of him who prays thus; his prayer is a curse!"</p>

<p>This too was spread from house to house. What is not spread in a
small community? And it reached Hauke's ears. He said no word about
it, not even to his wife; but sometimes he would embrace her
violently and draw her to himself: "Stay faithful, Elke! Stay
faithful to me!" Then her eyes would look up at him full of wonder.
"Faithful to you? To whom else should I be faithful?" After a short
while, however, she had understood his words. "Yes, Hauke, we are
faithful to each other; not only because we need each other." Then
each went his and her way to work.</p>

<p>So far all would have been well. But in spite of all the lively
work, a loneliness had spread round him, and in his heart nestled a
stubbornness and a reserved manner toward other people. Only toward
his wife he was always the same, and every evening and every morning
he knelt at the cradle of his child as if there he could find the
place of his eternal salvation. Towards servants and workmen,
however, he grew more severe; the clumsy and careless ones whom he
used to instruct with quiet reproaches were now startled by his harsh
address, and sometimes Elke had to make things right quietly where he
had offended.</p>

<p>When spring came, work on the dike began again. The gap in the
western dike line was closed by a temporary dike half-moon shaped on
the inside and the same toward the outside, for the protection of the
new lock about to be made. And as the lock grew, so the chief dike
gradually acquired its height, which could be more and more quickly
attained. The work of directing was not any easier for the
dikemaster, as in place of Jewe Manners, Ole Peters had stepped in as
dike overseer. Hauke had not cared to attempt preventing this, but
now in place of the encouraging word and the corresponding friendly
slap on the shoulder that he had earned form his wife's old
godfather, he had to cope with the successor's secret hostility and
unnecessary objections which had to be thwarted with equally
unnecessary reasons. For Ole belonged to the important people, to be
sure, but not to the clever ones in dike matters; besides, the
"scribbling hired man" of former days was still in his way.</p>

<p>The brightest sky again spread over sea and marshes, and the
enclosed land was once more gay with strong cattle, the bellowing of
which from time to time interrupted the widespread calm. Larks sang
continually high in the air, but one was not aware of it until for
the time of heartbeat the singing had ceased. No bad weather
disturbed the work, and the lock was ready with its unpainted
structure of beams before it needed the protection of the temporary
dike for even one night; the Lord seemed to favor the new work. Then
Elke's eyes would laugh to greet her husband when he came home from
the dike on his white horse. "You did turn into a good animal!" he
said, and then patted the horse's smooth neck. But when he saw the
child clinging round her neck, Hauke leaped down and let the tiny
thing dance in his arms. Then, when the white horse would fix its
brown eyes on the child, he would say: "Come here, you shall have the
honor." And he would place little Wienke-for that was her Christian
name-on the saddle and lead the white horse round in a circle on the
hill. The old ash tree, too, sometimes had the honor; he would set
the child on a swinging bough and let it rock. The mother stood in
the house door with laughing eyes. But the child did not laugh; her
eyes, between which there was a delicate little nose, looked a little
dully into the void, and her little hands did not try to seize the
small stick that her father was holding for her to take. Hauke did
not pay attention to this, especially as he knew nothing about such
little children. Only Elke, when she saw the bright-eyed girl on the
arm of her charwoman, who had been confined at the same time with
her, sometimes said with regret: "Mine isn't as far on as yours yet,
Trina." And the woman, as she shook the chubby boy she held by the
hand with brusque love, would cry: "Yes, madam, children are
different; this one here, he stole apples out of my room before he
was more than two years old." And Elke pushed the chubby boy's curls
from his eyes, and then secretly pressed her quiet child to her
heart.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October, the new lock stood solidly at the
west side in the main dike, now closed on both sides. Except for the
gaps by the channel, the new dike now sloped all the way round with a
gentle profile toward the water and rose above the ordinary high tide
by fifteen feet. From the northwestern corner one could look
unhindered past Jevers Island out over the sea. But, to be sure, the
winds blew more sharply here; one's hair fluttered, and he who wanted
a view from this point had to have his cap securely on his head.</p>

<p>Toward the end of November, when storm and rain had set in, there
remained only one gap to close, the one hard by the old dike, at the
bottom of which the sea water shot through the channel into the new
enclosure. At both sides stood the walls of the dike; now the cleft
between them had to vanish. Dry summer weather would have made the
work easier; but it had to be done anyway, for a rising storm might
endanger the whole work. And Hauke staked everything on accomplishing
the end. Rain poured down, the wind whistled; but his lean figure on
the fiery white horse rose now here, now there out of the black
masses of people who were busy by the gap, above and below, on the
north side of the dike. Now he was seen below beside the dump-carts
that already had to go far on the foreland to get the clay; a crowded
lot of these had just reached the channel in order to cast off their
loads. Through the splashing of the rain and the roaring of the wind,
from time to time sounded the sharp orders of the dikemaster, who
wanted to rule here alone to-day. He called the carts according to
their numbers and ordered back those that were crowding up. When his
"Stop" sounded, then all work ceased. "Straw!" Send down a load of
straw! he called to those above, and the straw from one of their
loads came tumbling down on to the wet clay. Below men jumped about
in it and tore it apart and called up to the others that they did not
want to be buried. Again new carts came, and Hauke was up on top once
more, and looked down from his white horse into the cleft below and
watched them shovel and dump their loads. Then he glanced out over
the sea. The wind was sharp and he saw how the edge of the water was
climbing higher up the dike and that the waves rose still higher. He
saw, too, that the men were drenched and could scarcely breathe
during their hard work because of the wind which cut off the air
right before their mouths and because of the cold rain that was
pouring down on them. "Hold out, men! Hold out!" he shouted down to
them. "Only one foot higher; then it'll be enough for this flood."
And through all the raging of the storm one could hear the noise of
the workmen; the splashing of the masses of clay tumbling down, the
rattling of the carts and the rustling of the straw let down from
above went on unceasingly. In the midst of these noises, now and
then, the wailing of a little yellow dog could be heard, which,
shivering and forlorn, was knocked about among all the men and teams.
Suddenly a scream of anguish from the little animal rose out of the
cleft. Hauke looked down: he had seen the dog hurled down from above.
His face suddenly flushed with rage. "Stop! Stop!" he shouted down to
the carts; for the wet clay was being heaped up unceasingly.</p>

<p>"Why?" a rough voice bawled up from below, "not on account of the
wretched brat of a dog?"</p>

<p>"Stop, I say!" Hauke shouted again; "bring me the dog! I don't
want any crime done with our work."</p>

<p>But not a hand stirred; only a few spades full of tough clay were
still thrown beside the howling animal. Then he spurred his white
horse so that it uttered a cry and stormed down the dike, and all
gave way before him. "The dog!" he shouted, "I want the dog!"</p>

<p>A hand slapped his shoulder gently, as if it were the hand of old
Jewe Manners, but when Hauke looked round, he saw that it was only a
friend of the old man's. "Take care, dikemaster!" he whispered to
him. "You have no friends among these people; let this dog business
be!"</p>

<p>The wind whistled, the rain splashed, the men had stuck their
spades into the ground, some had thrown them away. Hauke bent down to
the old man. "Do you want to hold my horse, Harke Jens?" he asked;
and the latter scarcely had the reins in his hand when Hauke had
leaped into the cleft and held the little wailing animal in his arms.
Almost in the same moment he sat high in his saddle again and
galloped back to the dike. He glanced swiftly over the men who stood
by the teams. "Who was it?" he called. "Who threw down this
creature?"</p>

<p>For a moment all was silent, for rage was flashing from the face
of the dikemaster, and they had a superstitious fear of him. Then a
muscular fellow stepped down from a team and stood before him. "I
didn't do it, dikemaster," he said, bit off a piece from his roll of
tobacco, and calmly pushed it into his mouth before he went on, "but
he who did it, did right; if your dike is to hold, something alive
has to be put into it!"</p>

<p>"Something alive? From what catechism have you learned that?"</p>

<p>"From none, sir!" replied the fellow with a pert laugh: "our
grandfathers knew that, who, I am sure, were as good Christians as
you! A child is still better; if you can't get that, a dog will
do!'</p>

<p>"You keep still with your heathen doctrines," Hauke shouted at
him, "the hole would be stopped up better if you had been thrown into
it!"</p>

<p>"Oho!" sounded from a dozen throats, and the dikemaster saw grim
faces and clenched fists round him; he saw that these were no
friends. The thought of his dike came over him like a sudden fear.
What would happen if now all should throw down their spades? As he
glanced down he again saw the friend of old Jewe Manners, who walked
in and out among the workmen, talked to this one and that one, smiled
at one, slapped another on the shoulder with a pleasant air-and one
after another took up his spade again. After a few minutes the work
was in full swing-What was it that he still wanted? The channel had
to be closed and he hid the dog safely in the folds of his cloak.
With a sudden decision, he turned his white horse to the next team:
"Let down the straw!" he called despotically, and the teamster obeyed
mechanically. Soon it rustled down into the depth, and on all sides
all arms were stirring again.</p>

<p>This work lasted an hour longer. It was six o'clock, and deep
twilight was descending; the rain had stopped. Then Hauke called the
superintendents together beside his horse: "To-morrow morning at four
o'clock," he said, "everybody is to be in his place; the moon will
still be shining, then we'll finish with God's blessing. And one
thing more," he cried, when they were about to go: "do you know this
dog?" And he took the trembling creature out of his cloak.</p>

<p>They did not know it. Only one man said: "He has been begging
round the village for days; he belongs to nobody."</p>

<p>"Then he is mine!" said the dikemaster. "Don't forget: to-morrow
morning at four o'clock!" And he rode away.</p>

<p>When he came home, Ann Grethe stepped out of the door. She had on
neat clothing, and the thought shot through his head that she was
going to the conventicle tailor's.</p>

<p>"Hold out your apron!" he called to her, and as she did so
automatically, he threw the little dog, all covered with clay, into
the apron.</p>

<p>"Carry him in to little Wienke; he is to be her companion! But
wash and warm him first; then you'll do a good deed, too, that will
please God, for the creature is almost frozen!"</p>

<p>And Ann Grethe could not help obeying her master, and therefore
did not get to the conventicle that day.</p>

<p>The next day the last cut with the spade was made on the new dike.
The wind had gone down; gulls and other sea birds were flying back
and forth over land and water in graceful flight. From Jevers Island
one could hear like a chorus of a thousand voices the cries of the
wild geese that still were making themselves at home on the coast of
the North Sea, and out of the white morning mists that spread over
the wide marshes, gradually rose a golden autumn day and shed its
light on the new work of human hands.</p>

<p>After a few weeks the commissioners of the ruler came with the
dikemaster general for inspection. A great banquet, the first since
the funeral banquet of old Tede Volkerst, was given in the house of
the dikemaster, to which all the dike overseers and the greater
landowners were invited. After dinner all the carriages of the guests
and of the dikemaster were made ready. The dikemaster general helped
Elke into the carriage in front of which the brown horse was stamping
his hoofs; then he leaped in after her and took the reins himself,
for he wanted to drive the clever wife of his dikemaster himself.
Then they rode merrily from the hill down to the road, then up to the
new dike, and upon it all round the new enclosed land. In the mean
time a light northwest wind had risen and the tide was driven against
the north and west sides of the new dike. But one could not help
being aware of the fact that the gentle slope made the attack of the
water gentler; and praise was poured on the new dikemaster from the
lips of the ruler's commissioners, so that the objections which now
and then were slowly brought out by the overseers, were soon stifled
by it.</p>

<p>This, too, passed by. But the dikemaster received another
satisfaction one day as he rode along on the new dike, in quiet,
self-conscious meditation. The question naturally arose in his mind,
why the new enclosure, which would not have had its being without
him, into which he had put the sweat of his brow and his night
watches, now finally was named after one of the princesses "the new
Caroline-land." But it was so: on all the documents concerned with it
stood the name, on some even in red Gothic letters. Then, just as he
was looking up, he saw two workmen coming toward him with their
tools, the one about twenty paces behind the other. "Why don't you
wait!" he heard the one behind calling. The other, who was just
standing by a path which led down into the new land, called to him:
"Another time, Jens. I'm late; I have to dig clay here."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Down here, in the Hauke-Haien-land."</p>

<p>He called it aloud, as he trotted down the path, as if he wanted
the whole marsh below to hear it. But Hauke felt as if he were
hearing his fame proclaimed; he rose from his saddle, spurred on his
horse and with steady eyes looked over the wide land that lay to his
left. "Hauke-Haien-land! Hauke-Haien-land!" he repeated softly; that
sounded as if in all time it could not have another name. Let them
defy him as they would-they could not get round his name; the name of
the princess-wouldn't that soon moulder in old documents?-His white
horse galloped proudly and in his ears he heard a murmur:
"Hauke-Haien-land! Hauke-Haien-land!" In his thoughts the new dike
almost grew into the eighth wonder of the world; in all Frisia there
was not the like of it. And he let the white horse dance, for he felt
as if he were standing in the midst of all the Frisians, towering
over them the height of a head, and glancing down upon all keenly and
full of pity.</p>

<p>Gradually three years had gone by since the building of the dike.
The new structure had proved its worth, the cost of repairing had
been small. And now almost everywhere in the enclosed land white
clover was blooming, and as one walked over the sheltered pastures,
the summer wind blew toward one a whole cloud of sweet fragrance.
Thus the time had come to turn the shares, which hitherto had only
been ideal, into real ones, and to allot to each shareholder the
piece which he was to keep as his own. Hauke had not been slow to
acquire some new shares before this; Old Peters had kept back out of
spite, and owned nothing in the new land. The distribution of the
parts could not be accomplished without annoyance and quarreling; but
it was done, nevertheless. This day, too, lay behind the
dikemaster.</p>

<p>From now on he lived in a lonely way for his duties as farmer and
as dikemaster and for those who were nearest to him. His old friends
were no longer living, and he was not the man to make new ones. But
under his roof was a peace which even the quiet child did not mar.
She spoke little, the constant questioning that is so characteristic
of bright children was rare with her and usually came in such a way
that it was hard to answer; but her dear, simple little face almost
always wore an expression of content. She had two play-fellows, and
they were enough: when she wandered over the hill, the rescued little
yellow dog always jumped round her, and when the dog appeared, little
Wienke did not stay away long. The second companion was a pewit gull.
As the dog's name was "Pearl" so the gull was called "Claus."</p>

<p>Claus had been installed on the farm by an aged woman.
Eighty-year-old Trin Jans had not been able to keep herself any
longer in her hut on the outer dike; and Elke had thought that the
aged servant of her grandfather might find peaceful evening hours and
a good room to die in at her home. So, half by force, she and Hauke
had brought her to their farm and settled her in the little northwest
room in the new barn that the dikemaster had had built beside the
main house when he had enlarged his establishment. A few of the maids
had been given rooms next to the old woman's and could help her
tonight. Along the walls she kept her old furnishings; a chest made
of wood from sugar boxes, above it two coloured pictures of her lost
son, then a spinning-wheel, now at rest, and a very neat canopied bed
in front of which stood an unwieldy stool covered with the white fur
of the defunct Angora cat. But something alive, too, she had had
about her and brought with her: that was the gull Claus, which had
been attached to her and fed by her for years. To be sure, when
winter came, it flew with the other gulls to the south and did not
come again until the wormwood was fragrant on the shore.</p>

<p>The barn was a little lower down on the hill, so the old woman
could not look over the dike at the sea from her window. "You keep me
here as in prison, dikemaster," she muttered one day, as Hauke
stepped in to see her, and she pointed with her bent finger at the
fens that spread out below. "Where is Jeverssand? Above those red
oxen or those black ones?"</p>

<p>"What do you want Jeverssand for?" asked Hauke.</p>

<p>"Jeverssand!" muttered the old woman. "Why, I want to see where my
boy that time went to God!"</p>

<p>"If you want to see that," Hauke replied, "you'll have to sit up
there under the ash tree. From there you can look over the whole
sea."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old woman; "yes, if I had your young legs,
dikemaster."</p>

<p>This was the style of thanks the dikemaster and his wife received
for some time, until all at once everything was different. The little
child's head of Wienke one morning peeped in through her half-open
door. "Well," called the old woman, who sat with her hands folded on
her wooden stool; "what have you to tell me?"</p>

<p>But the child silently came nearer and looked at her constantly
with its listless eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you the dikemaster's child?" Trin Jans asked, and as the
child lowered its head as if nodding, she went on: "Then sit down
here on my stool. Once it was an Angora cat-so big! But your father
killed it. If it wee still alive, you could ride on it."</p>

<p>Wienke silently turned her eyes to the white fur; then she knelt
down and began to stroke lit with her little hands as children are
wont to do with live cats or dogs. "Poor cat!" she said then and went
on with her caresses.</p>

<p>"Well," cried the old woman after a while, "now that's enough; and
you can sit on him to-day, too. Perhaps your father only killed him
for that." Then she lifted up the child by both arms and set it down
roughly on the stool. But when it remained sitting there, silent and
motionless and only kept looking at her, she began to shake her head.
"Thou art punishing him, Lord God! Yes, yes, Thou art punishing him!"
she murmured. But pity for the child seemed to come over her; she
stroked its scanty hair with her bony hand, and the eyes of the
little girl seemed to show that this did her good.</p>

<p>From now on Wienke came every day to the old woman in her room.
Soon she sat down on the Angora stool of her own accord, and Trin
Jans put small bits of meat and bread which she always saved into the
child's little hands, and made her throw them on the floor. Then the
gull shot out of some corner with screams and wings spread out and
pounced on the morsels. At first the great, rushing bird frightened
the child and made her cry out; but soon it all happened like a game
learned by heart, and her little head only had to appear in the
opening of the door, when the bird rushed up to her and perched on
her head and shoulders, until the old woman helped and the feeding
could begin. Trin Jans who before never could bear to have anyone
merely stretch out a hand after her "Claus," now patiently watched
the child gradually win over the bird altogether. It willingly let
itself be chased, and she carried it about in her apron. Then, when
on the hill the little yellow dog would jump round her and up at the
bird in jealousy, she would cry: "Don't, don't, Pearl!" and lift the
gull with her little arms so high, that the bird, after setting
itself free, would fly screaming over the hill, and now the dog, by
jumping and caressing, would try to win its place in her arms.</p>

<p>When by chance Hauke's or Elke's eyes fell upon this strange
four-leaved clover which, as it were, was held to the same stem only
by the same defect-then they cast tender glances upon the child. But
when they turned away, there remained on their faces only the pain
that each carried away alone, for the saving word had not yet been
spoken between them. One summer morning, when Wienke sat with the old
woman and the two animals on the big stones in front of the barn
door, both her parents passed by-the dikemaster leading his white
horse, with the reins flung over his arm. He wanted to ride on the
dike and had got his horse out of the fens himself; on the hill his
wife had taken his arm. The sun shone down warmly; it was almost
sultry, and now and then a gust of wind blew from the
south-southeast. It seemed that her seat was uncomfortable for the
child. "Wienke wants to go too!" she cried, shook the gull out of her
lap and seized her father's hand.</p>

<p>"Then come!" said he.</p>

<p>But Elke cried: "In this wind? She'll fly away from you!"</p>

<p>"I'll hold her all right; and to-day we have warm air and jolly
water; then she can see it dance!"</p>

<p>Then Elke ran into the house and got a shawl and a little cap for
her child. "But a storm is brewing," she said; "hurry and get on your
way and be back soon."</p>

<p>Hauke laughed: "That shan't get us!" and lifted the child to his
saddle. Elke stayed a while on the hill and, shading her eyes with
her hand, watched the two trot down the road and toward the dike.
Trin Jan sat on the stone and murmured incomprehensible things with
her lips.</p>

<p>The child lay motionless in her father's arms. It seemed as if it
breathed with difficulty under the pressure of the sultry air. He
bent down his head to her: "Well, Wienke?" he asked.</p>

<p>The child looked at him a while: "Father," she said, "you can do
that. Can't you do everything?"</p>

<p>"What is it that I can do, Wienke?"</p>

<p>But she was silent; she seemed not to have understood her own
question.</p>

<p>It was high tide. When they came to the dike, the reflection of
the sun on the wide water flashed into her eyes, a whirlwind made the
waves eddy and raised them high up, ever new waves came and beat
splashing against the beach. Then, in her fear, her little hands
clung round her father's fist which was holding the reins, so that
the horse made a bound to the side. The pale-blue eyes looked up at
Hauke in confused fright: "The water, father! The water!" she
cried.</p>

<p>But he gently freed his hand and said: "Be calm, child; you are
with your father; the water won't hurt you!"</p>

<p>She pushed her pale blond hair from her forehead and again dared
to look upon the sea. "It won't hurt me," she said trembling; "no,
tell it not to hurt us; you can do that, and then it won't do
anything to us!"</p>

<p>"I can't do that, child," replied Hauke seriously; "but the dike
on which we are riding shelters us, and this your father has thought
out and has had built."</p>

<p>Her eyes turned upon him as if she did not quite understand that;
then she buried her strikingly small head in the wide folds of her
father's coat.</p>

<p>"Why are you hiding, Wienke?" he whispered to her; "are you
afraid?" And a trembling little voice rose out of the folds of the
coat: "Wienke would rather not look; but you can do everything, can't
you, father?"</p>

<p>Distant thunder was rolling against the wind. "Hoho!" cried Hauke,
"there it comes!" And he turned his horse round to ride back. "Now we
want to go home to mother!"</p>

<p>The child drew a deep breath; but not until they had reached the
hill and the house did she raise her little head from her father's
breast. When Elke had taken off the little shawl and cap in the room,
the child remained standing before her mother like a dumb little
ninepin.</p>

<p>"Well, Wienke," she said, and shook her gently, "do you like the
big water?"</p>

<p>But the child opened her eyes wide. "It talks," she said. "Wienke
is afraid!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't talk; it only murmurs and roars!"</p>

<p>The child looked into the void: "Has it got legs?" she asked
again; "can it come over the dike?"</p>

<p>"No, Wienke; your father looks out for that, he is the
dikemaster."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the child and clapped her little hands together with
an idiotic smile. "Father can do everything-everything!" Then
suddenly, turning away from her mother, she cried: "Let Wienke go to
Trin Jans, she has red apples!"</p>

<p>And Elke opened the door and let the child out. When she had
closed it again, she glanced at her husband with the deepest anguish
in her eyes from which hitherto he had drawn only comfort and courage
that had helped him.</p>

<p>He gave her his hand and pressed hers, as if there were no further
need for words between them; then she said in a low voice: "No,
Hauke, let me speak: the child that I have borne you after years will
stay a child always. Oh, good God! It is feeble-minded! I have to say
it once in your hearing."</p>

<p>"I knew it long ago," said Hauke and held tightly his wife's hand
which she wanted to draw away.</p>

<p>"So we are left alone after all," she said again.</p>

<p>But Hauke shook his head: "I love her, and she throws her little
arms round me and presses close to my breast; for all the treasures
of the world I wouldn't miss that!"</p>

<p>The woman stared ahead darkly: "But why?" she asked; "what have I,
poor mother, done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Elke, that I have asked, too, of Him who alone can know; but
you know, too, that the Almighty gives men no answer-perhaps because
we would not grasp it."</p>

<p>He had seized his wife's other hand too, and gently drew her
toward him. "Don't let yourself be kept from loving your child as you
do; be sure it understands that."</p>

<p>Then Elke threw herself on her husband's breast and cried to her
heart's content and was on longer alone with her grief. Then suddenly
she smiled at him; after pressing his hand passionately, she ran out
and got her child from old Trin Jans' room, took it on her lap and
caressed and kissed it, until it stammered:</p>

<p>"Mother, my dear mother!"</p>

<p>Thus the people on the dikemaster's farm lived quietly; if the
child had not been there, it would have been greatly missed.</p>

<p>Gradually the summer passed by; the migrating birds had flown
away, the song of larks was no longer in the air; only in front of
the barns, where they pecked at the grain in thrashing time, one
could hear some of them scream as they flew away. Already everything
was frozen hard. In the kitchen of the main house Trin Jans sat one
afternoon on the wooden steps of a stairway that started beside the
stove and led to the attic. In the last weeks it seemed as if a new
life had entered into her. Now she liked to go into the kitchen
occasionally and watch Elke at work; there was no longer any idea of
her legs not being able to carry her so far, since one day little
Wienke had pulled her up here by her apron. Now the child was
kneeling beside her, looking with her quiet eyes into the flames that
were blazing up out of the stove-hole; one of her little hands was
clinging to the old woman's sleeve, the other was in her own pale
blonde hair. Trin Jans was telling a story: "You know," she said, "I
was in the service at your great-grandfather's, as housemaid, and
there I had to feed the pigs. He was cleverer than all the rest-then
it happened-it was awfully long ago-but, one night, by moonlight,
they had the lock to the sea closed, and she couldn't go back into
the sea. Oh, how she screamed and clutched her hard, bristly hair
with her fish-hands! Yes, child, I saw her and heard her scream. The
ditches between the fens were all full of water, and the moon beamed
on them so that they shone like silver; and she swam from one ditch
into another and raised her arms and clapped what hands she had
together, so that one could hear the splash from far, as if she
wanted to pray. But, child, those creatures can't pray. I sat in
front of the house door on a few beams that had been driven there to
build with, and looked far over the fens; and the mermaid was still
swimming in the ditches, and when she raised her arms, they were
glittering with silver and diamonds. At last I saw her no longer, and
the wild geese and gulls that I had not been hearing all the time
were again flying through the air with whistling and cackling."</p>

<p>The old woman stopped. The child had caught one word: "Couldn't
pray?" she asked. "What are you saying? Who was that?"</p>

<p>"Child," said the old woman; "it was the mermaid; they are
monsters and can't be saved."</p>

<p>"Can't be saved!" repeated the child, and a deep sigh made her
little breast heave, as if she had understood that.</p>

<p>"Trin Jans!" a deep voice sounded from the kitchen door, and the
old woman was a little startled. It was the dikemaster Hauke Haien,
who leaned there by the post; "what are you telling the child?
Haven't I told you to keep your fairy-tales for yourself or else to
tell them to the geese and hens?"</p>

<p>The old woman looked at him with an angry glance and pushed the
little girl away. "That's no fairy-tale," she murmured, "my
great-uncle told it to me!"</p>

<p>"Your great-uncle, Trin? You just said you had seen it
yourself."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," said the old woman; "but you don't believe
me, Hauke Haien; you want to make my great-uncle a liar!" Then she
moved nearer to the stove and stretched her hands out over the flames
of the stove-hole.</p>

<p>The dikemaster cast a glance at the window: twilight had scarcely
begun. "Come, Wienke!" he said and drew his feeble-minded child
toward him; "come with me, I want to show you something outside, from
the dike. But we have to walk; the white horse is at the
blacksmith's." Then he took her into the room and Elke wrapped thick
woolen shawls round the child's neck and shoulders; and soon her
father walked with her on the old dike toward the north-west, past
Jeverssand, where the flats stretched out broad and almost
endless.</p>

<p>Now he would carry her, now she would walk holding his hand; the
twilight thickened; in the distance everything vanished in mist and
vapour. But in parts still in sight, the invisibly swelling streams
that washed the flats had broken the ice and, as Hauke Haien had once
seen it in his youth, steaming mists rose out of the cracks as at
that time, and there again the uncanny foolish figures were hopping
toward one another, bowed and suddenly stretched out into horrible
breadths.</p>

<p>The child clung frightened to her father and covered her face with
his hand. "The sea devils!" she whispered, trembling, through his
fingers; "the sea devils!"</p>

<p>He shook his head: "No, Wienke, they are neither mermaids nor sea
devils; there are no such things; who told you about them?"</p>

<p>She looked up to him with a dull glance; but she did not reply.
Tenderly he stroked her cheeks: "Look there again!" he said, "they
are only poor hungry birds! Look now, how that big one spreads its
wings; they are getting the fish that go into those steaming
cracks!"</p>

<p>"Fish!" repeated Wienke.</p>

<p>"Yes, child, they are all alive, just as we are; there is nothing
else; but God is everywhere!"</p>

<p>Little Wienke had fixed her eyes on the ground and held her
breath; she looked frightened as if she were gazing into an abyss.
Perhaps it only seemed so; her father looked at her a long while, he
bent down and looked at her little face, but on it was written no
emotion of her inscrutable soul. He lifted her on his arm and put her
icy little hands into one of his thick woollen mittens. "There, my
Wienke"-the child could not have been aware of the note of passionate
tenderness in his words-"there, warm yourself, near me! You are our
child, our only one. You love us-" The man's voice broke; but the
little girl pressed her small head tenderly against his rough
beard.</p>

<p>And so they went home in peace.</p>

<p>After New Year care had once more entered the house. A fever of
the marshes had seized the dikemaster; he too had hovered near the
edge of the grave, and when he had revived under Elke's nursing and
care, he scarcely seemed the same man. The fatigue of his body also
lay upon his spirit, and Elke noticed with some worry that he was
always easily satisfied. Nevertheless, toward the end of March, he
had a desire to mount his white horse and for the first time to ride
along his dike again. This was one afternoon when the sun that had
shone before, was shrouded for a long while by dim mist.</p>

<p>In the winter there had been a few floods; but they had not been
serious. Only over by the other shore a flock of sheep had been
drowned on an island and a piece of the foreland torn away; here on
this side and on the new land no damage worth mentioning had been
done. But in the last night a stronger storm had raged; now the
dikemaster had to go out and inspect everything with his own eyes. He
had ridden along on the new dike from the southeastern corner and
everything was well preserved. But when he reached the northeastern
corner, at the point where the new dike meets the old one, the new
one, to be sure, was unharmed. But where formerly the channel had
reached the old dike and flowed along it, he saw a great, broad piece
of the grassy scar destroyed and washed away and a hollow in the body
of the dike worn by the flood, in which, moreover, a network of paths
made by mice was exposed. Hauke dismounted and inspected the damage
close by: there was no doubt that the mischief done by the mice
extended on invisible.</p>

<p>He was startled violently. All this should have been considered
when the new dike was being built; as it had been overlooked then,
something had to be done now. The cattle were not yet grazing in the
fens, the growth of the grass was unusually backward; wherever he
looked there was barrenness and void. He mounted his horse again and
rode up and down the shore; it was low tide, and he was well aware of
how the current had again dug itself a new bed in the clay and had
now hit upon the old dike. The new dike, however, when it was hit,
had been able to withstand the attack on account of its gentler
slope.</p>

<p>A heap of new toil and care rose before the mind's eye of the
dikemaster. Not only did the old dike have to be reenforced, its
profile, too, had to be made more like that of the new one; above
all, the channel, which again had proved dangerous, had to be turned
aside by new dams or walls.</p>

<p>Once more he rode on the new dike up to the farthest northwestern
corner, then back again, keeping his eyes continually on the newly
worn bed of the channel which was marked off clearly on the exposed
clay beside him. The white horse pushed forward, snorted and pawed
with its front hoofs; but the rider held him back, for he wanted to
ride slowly, and to curb the inner unrest that was seething within
him more and more wildly.</p>

<p>If a storm flood should come again-a flood like the one in 1655,
when property and unnumbered human beings were swallowed up-if it
should come again, as it had come several times before! A violent
shudder came over the rider-the old dike would not hold out against
the sudden attack. What then-what would happen then? There would be
only one, one single way of possibly saving the old enclosed land
with the property and life in it. Hauke felt his heart stand still,
his usually so steady head grew dizzy. He did not utter it, but
something spoke within him strongly enough: your land, the
Hauke-Haien-land, would have to be sacrificed and the new dike
pierced.</p>

<p>In his mind's eye he saw the rushing tide break in and cover grass
and clover with its salty, foaming spray. His spur pricked the flanks
of his white horse, which, with a sudden scream, flew along the dike
and down the road that led to the hill of the dikemaster.</p>

<p>He came home with his head full of inner fright and disorderly
plans. He threw himself into his armchair, and when Elke came into
the room with their daughter, he rose again, lifted up the child and
kissed it. Then he chased away the little yellow dog with a few light
slaps. "I have to go up to the inn again," he said, and took his cap
from the hook by the door, where he had only just put it.</p>

<p>His wife looked at him anxiously. "What do you want to do there?
It is near evening, Hauke."</p>

<p>"Dike matters!" he muttered. "I'll meet some of the overseers
there."</p>

<p>She followed him and pressed his hand, for with these words he had
already left the door. Hauke Haien, who hitherto had made all
decisions by himself, now was eager for a word from those whom he had
not considered worthy of taking an interest before. In the room of
the tavern he found Ole Peters with two of the overseers and an
inhabitant of the district at the card table.</p>

<p>"I suppose you come from out there, dikemaster?" said Ole, who
took up the already half distributed cards and threw them down
again.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ole," Hauke replied; "I was there; it looks bad."</p>

<p>"Bad? Well, it'll cost a few hundred pieces of sod and a straw
covering. I was there too this afternoon.</p>

<p>"It won't be done so cheaply, Ole," replied the dikemaster; "the
channel is there again, and even if it doesn't hit the old dike from
the north, it hits it from the north-west."</p>

<p>"You should have left it where you found it," said Ole drily.</p>

<p>"That means," returned Hauke, "the new land's none of your
business; and therefore it should not exist. That is your own fault.
But if we have to make walls to protect the old dike, the green
clover behind the new one will bring us a profit above the cost."</p>

<p>"What are you saying, dikemaster?" cried the overseers; "Walls?
How many? You like to have the most expensive of everything."</p>

<p>The cards lay untouched upon the table. "I'll tell you,
dikemaster," said Ole Peters, and leaned on both elbows, "Your new
land that you presented to us is a devouring thing. Everybody is
still laboring under the heavy cost of your broad dike; and now that
is devouring our old dike too we are expected to renew it.
Fortunately it isn't so bad; the dike has held out so far and will
continue to hold out. Mount your white horse to-morrow and look at it
again!"</p>

<p>Hauke had come here from the peace of his own house; behind these
words he had just heard, moderate though they were, there lay-and he
could not but be aware of it-tough resistance; he felt, too, as if he
were lacking his old strength to cope with it. "I will do as you
advise, Ole," he said; "only I fear I shall find it as I have seen it
to-day."</p>

<p>A restless night followed this day. Hauke tossed sleepless upon
his pillows. "What is the matter?" asked Elke who was kept awake by
worry over her husband; "if something depresses you, speak it out;
that's the way we've always done."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence, Elke," he replied, "there is something to
repair on the dike at the locks; you know that I always have to work
over these things at night." That was all he said; he wanted to keep
freedom of action; unconsciously the clear insight and strong
intelligence of his wife was a hindrance to him which he
instinctively avoided in his present weakness.</p>

<p>The following morning when he came out on to the dike once more
the world was different from the one he had seen the day before; it
was low tide again, to be sure, but the day had not yet attained its
noon, and beams of the bright spring sun fell almost perpendicularly
onto the endless flats. The white gulls flew quietly hither and
thither, and invisible above them, high under the azure sky, larks
sang their eternal melody. Hauke, who did not know how nature can
deceive one with her charms, stood on the north-western corner of the
dike and looked for the new bed of the channel that had startled him
so yesterday, but in the sunlight pouring down from the zenith, he
did not even find it at first. Not until he had shaded his eyes from
the blinding rays, did he recognise it. Yet the shadows in the
twilight of yesterday must have deceived him: it could be discerned
but faintly. The exposed mouse business must have done more damage to
the dike than the flood. To be sure, things had to be changed;
however, this could be done by careful digging and, as Ole Peters had
said, the damage could be repaired by fresh sod and some bundles of
straw for covering.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so bad," he said to himself, relieved; "you fooled
yourself yesterday." He called the overseers, and the work was
decided on without contradiction, something that had never happened
before.</p>

<p>The dikemaster felt as if a strengthening calm were spreading
through his still weakened body and after a few weeks everything was
neatly carried out.</p>

<p>The year went on, but the more it advanced and the more
undisturbed the newly spread turf grew green through the straw
covering, the more restlessly Hauke walked or rode past the spot. He
turned his eyes away, he rode on the inside edge of the dike. A few
times, when it occurred to him that he would have to pass by the
place, he had his horse, though it was already saddled, led back into
the stable. Then again, when he had no business there, he would
wander to it, suddenly and on foot, so as to leave his hill quickly
and unseen. Sometimes he had turned back again, unable once more to
inflict on himself the sight of this uncanny place. Finally, he felt
like breaking up the whole thing with his own hands, for this piece
of the dike lay before his eyes like a bite of conscience that had
taken on form outside of himself. And yet his hand could not touch it
any more; and to no one, not even his wife, could he talk about it.
Thus September had come; at night a moderate storm had raged and at
last had blown away to the northwest. On the dull forenoon after it,
at low tide, Hauke rode out on the dike and, as his glance swept over
the flats, something shot through him: there, on from the northwest,
he suddenly saw the ghostly new bed of the channel again, more
sharply marked and worn deeper. No matter how hard he strained his
eyes, it would not go.</p>

<p>When he came home, Elke seized his hand. "What's the matter,
Hauke?" she said, as she looked at his gloomy face. "There is no new
calamity, is there? We are so happy now; it seems, you are at peace
now with all of them."</p>

<p>After these words, he did not feel equal to expressing his
confused fear.</p>

<p>"No, Elke," he said, "nobody is hostile to me; but it is a
responsible function-to protect the community from our Lord's
sea."</p>

<p>He withdrew, so as to escape further questioning by his beloved
wife. He walked through stable and barn, as if he had to look over
everything; but he saw nothing round about. He was preoccupied only
with hushing up his conscience, with convincing himself that it was a
morbidly exaggerated fear.</p>

<p>The year that I am telling about, my host, the school-master, said
after a while, was the year 1756, which will surely never be
forgotten in this region. Into the house of Hauke Haien it brought a
death. At the end of September Trin Jans, almost ninety years old,
was dying in the barn furnished for her. According to her wishes,
they had propped her up in her pillows, and her eyes wandered through
the little windows with their leaden casements far out into the
distance. A thin layer of atmosphere must have lain above a thicker
one up in the sky, for there was a high mirage and the reflection
raised the sea like a glittering strip of silver above the edge of
the dike, so that it shone dazzlingly into the room. The southern tip
of Jeverssand was visible, too.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed little Wienke was cowering, holding with
one hand that of her father who stood beside her. On the face of the
dying woman death was just imprinting the Hippocratic face, and the
child stared breathlessly on the uncanny incomprehensible change in
the plain, but familiar features.</p>

<p>"What is she doing? What is that, father?" she whispered, full of
fear, and dug her finger nails into her father's hand.</p>

<p>"She is dying!" said the dikemaster.</p>

<p>"Dying!" repeated the child, and seemed to have fallen into a
confused pondering.</p>

<p>But the old woman moved her lips once more: "Jens! Jens!" her
screams broke out, like cries in danger, and her long arms were
stretched out against the glittering reflection of the sea; "Help me!
Help me! You are in the water--God have mercy on the others!"</p>

<p>Her arms sank down, a low creaking of the bedstead could be heard;
she had ceased to live.</p>

<p>The child drew a deep breath and lifted her pale eyes to her
father's. "Is she still dying?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She has done it!" said the dikemaster, and took his child in his
arms. "Now she is far from us with God."</p>

<p>"With God!" repeated the child and was silent for a while, as if
she had to think about these words. "Is that good-with God?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the best." In Hauke's heart, however, the last words
of the dying woman resounded heavily. "God have mercy on the others!"
a low voice said within him. "What did the old hag mean? Are the
dying prophets-?"</p>

<p>Soon after Trin Jans had been buried by the church, there was more
and more talk about all kinds of mischief and strange vermin that had
frightened the people in North Frisia, and there was no doubt that on
mid-Lent Sunday the golden cock was thrown down by a whirlwind. It
was true, too, that in midsummer a great cloud of vermin fell down,
like snow, from the sky, so that one could scarcely open one's eyes,
and afterwards it lay on the fens in a layer as high as a hand, and
no one had ever seen anything like it. But at the end of September,
after the hired man had driven to the city market with grain and the
maid Ann Grethe with butter, they both climbed down, when they came
home, with faces pale from fright. "What's the matter? What's the
matter with you?" cried the other maids, who had come running out
when they heard the wagon roll up.</p>

<p>Ann Grethe in her travelling clothes stepped breathless into the
spacious kitchen. "Well, tell us," cried the maids again, "what has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Oh, our Lord Jesus protect us!" cried Ann Grethe. "You know, old
Marike of the brickworks from over there across the water-we always
stand together with our butter by the drugstore at the corner-she
told me, and Iven Johns said too-'There's going to be a calamity!' he
said; 'a calamity for all North Frisia; believe me, Ann Grethe!'
And"-she muffled her voice-"maybe there's something wrong after all
about the dikemaster's white horse!"</p>

<p>"Sh! Sh!" replied the other maids.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, what do I care! But over there, on the other side, it's
even worse than ours. Not only flies and vermin, but blood has poured
down from the sky like rain. And the Sunday morning after that, when
the pastor went to his washbowl, he found five death's heads in it,
as big as peas, and everybody came to look at them. In the month of
August horrible red-headed caterpillars crawled all over the land and
devoured what they found, grain and flour and bread, and no fire
could kill them off."</p>

<p>The talker broke off suddenly; none of the maids had noticed that
the mistress of the house had stepped into the kitchen. "What are you
talking about there?" she said. "Don't let your master hear that!"
And as they all wanted to tell about it now, she stopped them. "Never
mind; I heard enough; go to your work; that will bring you better
blessings." Then she took Ann Grethe with her into the room and
settled the accounts of the market business.</p>

<p>Thus the superstitious talk in the house of the dikemaster found
no reception from its master and mistress. But it spread into the
other houses, and the longer the evenings grew, the more easily it
found its way in. Something like sultry air weighed on all, and it
was secretly said that a calamity, a serious one, would come over
North Frisia.</p>

<p>It was All Saints' Day, in October. During the day a southwest
wind had raged; at night a half moon was in the sky, dark brown
clouds chased by it, and shadows and dim light flitted over the earth
in confusion. The storm was growing. In the room of the dikemaster's
house stood the cleared supper table, the hired men were sent to the
stables to look after the cattle; the maids had to see if the doors
and shutters were closed everywhere in the house and attic, so that
the storm would not blow in and do harm. Inside stood Hauke beside
his wife at the window, after he had hurriedly eaten his supper. He
had been outside on the dike. On foot he had marched out, early in
the afternoon. Pointed posts and bags full of clay or earth he had
had brought to the place where the dike seemed to betray a weakness.
Everywhere he had engaged people to ram in the posts and make a dam
of them and the bags, as soon as the flood began to damage the dike;
at the northwestern corner, where the old and the new dike met, he
had placed the most people, who were allowed to leave their appointed
posts only in case of need. These orders he had left when, scarcely a
quarter of an hour ago, he had come home wet and dishevelled, and
now, as he listened to the gusts of wind that made the windows rattle
in their leaden casements, he gazed absently out into the wild night.
The clock on the wall was just striking eight. The child that stood
beside her mother, started and buried her head in her mother's
clothes. "Claus!" she exclaimed crying, "where's my Claus?"</p>

<p>She had a right to ask, for this year, as well as the year before,
the gull had not gone on its winter journey. Her father overheard the
question; her mother took the child on her arm. "Your Claus is in the
barn," she said; "there he is warm."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Wienke, "is that good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is good."</p>

<p>The master of the house was still standing by the window.</p>

<p>"This won't do any longer, Elke!" he said; "call one of the maids;
the storm will break through the windowpanes-the shutters have to be
fastened!"</p>

<p>At the word of the mistress, the maid had rushed out; from the
room one could see how her skirts were flying. But when she had
loosened the hooks, the storm tore the shutter out of her hand and
threw it against the window, so that several panes flew splintered
into the room and one of the candles went out, smoking. Hauke had to
go out himself to help, and only with trouble did they gradually get
the shutters fastened in front of the windows. As they opened the
door to step back into the house a gust blew after them so that the
glass and silver in the sideboard rattled; and upstairs, over their
heads the beams trembled and creaked, as if the storm wanted to tear
the roof from the walls. But Hauke did not come back into the room;
Elke heard him walk across the threshing floor to the stable. "The
white horse! The white horse, John! Quick!" she heard him call. Then
he came back into the room with his hair dishevelled, but his gray
eyes beaming. "The wind has turned!" he cried, "to the northwest; at
half spring tide! Not a wind-we have never lived through a storm like
this!"</p>

<p>Elke had turned deadly pale. "And you want to go out once
more?"</p>

<p>He seized both her hands and pressed them almost convulsively. "I
have to, Elke."</p>

<p>Slowly she raised her dark eyes to his, and for a few seconds they
looked at each other; but it seemed an eternity. "Yes, Hauke," said
his wife, "I know-you have to!"</p>

<p>Then trotting was heard outside the house door. She fell upon his
neck, and for a moment it seemed as if she could not let him go; but
that, too, was only for a moment. "This is our fight!" said Hauke,
"you are safe here; no flood has ever risen up to this house. And
pray to God that He may be with me too!"</p>

<p>Hauke wrapped himself up in his coat, and Elke took a scarf and
wrapped it carefully round his neck, but her trembling lips failed
her.</p>

<p>Outside the neighing of the white horse sounded like trumpets amid
the howling of the storm. Elke had stepped out with her husband; the
old ash tree creaked, as if it would fall to pieces. "Mount, sir!"
cried the hired man; "the horse is like mad; the reins might
tear!"</p>

<p>Hauke embraced his wife. "At sunrise I'll be back."</p>

<p>He had already leaped onto his horse; the animal rose on its hind
legs, then, like a warhorse rushing into battle, it tore down the
hill with its rider, out into the night and the howling storm.
"Father, my father!" a plaintive child voice screamed after him, "my
dear father!"</p>

<p>Wienke had run after her father as he was tearing away; but after
a hundred steps she stumbled over a mound of earth and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>The man Iven Johns brought the crying child back to her mother.
She was leaning against the trunk of the ash tree the branches of
which were whipping the air above her, and staring absently out into
the night where her husband had vanished. When the roaring of the
storm and the distant splashing of the sea stopped for a few moments,
she started as if in fright; it seemed to her now as if all were
seeking to destroy him and would be hushed suddenly when they had
seized him. Her knees were trembling, the wind had unloosed and was
sporting with her hair. "Here is the child, lady," John cried to her;
"hold her fast!" and pressed the little girl into her mother's
arms.</p>

<p>"The child?-I had forgotten you, Wienke!" she cried. "God forgive
me!" Then she lifted her to her heart, as close as only love can
hold, and with her fell on her knees. "Lord God and Thou my Jesus,
let us not be widow and orphan! Protect him, oh, good God; only Thou
and I, we alone know him!" Now the storm had no more pauses; it
howled and thundered as if the whole world would pass away in this
uproar.</p>

<p>"Go into the house, lady!" said John; "come!" and he helped them
up and led both into the house and into the room.</p>

<p>The dikemaster Hauke Haien sped on his white horse to the dike.
The small path seemed to have no bottom, for measureless rain had
fallen; nevertheless, the wet, sucking clay did not appear to hold
back the hoofs of the animal, for it acted as if it felt the solid
ground of summer beneath it. As in a wild chase the clouds wandered
in the sky; below lay the marshes like an indistinct desert filled
with restless shadows. A muffled roaring rose from the water behind
the dike, more and more horrible, as if it had to drown all other
sounds. "Get up, horse!" called Hauke, "we are riding our worst
ride."</p>

<p>Then a scream of death sounded under the hoofs of his horse. He
jerked back the reins, and turned round: beside him, close above the
ground, half flying, half hurled by the wind, a swarm of white gulls
was passing by with derisive cackling; they were seeking shelter on
land. One of them-the moon was shining through the clouds for a
moment-lay trampled by the way: the rider believed that he saw a red
ribbon flutter at its throat. "Claus!" he cried; "poor Claus!"</p>

<p>Was it the bird of his child? Had it recognised horse and rider
and wanted to find shelter with them? The rider did not know. "Get
up!" he cried again; the white horse raised his hoofs to gallop once
more. All at once the wind stopped, and in its place there was a
deathlike silence-but only for a second, when it began again with
renewed rage. But human voices and the forlorn barking of dogs
meanwhile fell upon the rider's ear, and when he turned his head
round to look at his village, he recognised by the appearing
moonlight people working round heaped up wagons on the hills and in
front of the houses. Instantly he saw other wagons hurriedly driving
up to the higher land; he heard the lowing of cattle that were being
driven up there out of their warm stables. "Thank God! They are
saving themselves and their cattle!" his heart cried within him; and
then with a scream of fear: "My wife! My child! No, no; the water
doesn't rise up on our hill!"</p>

<p>A terrible gust came roaring from the sea, and horse and rider
were rushing against it up the small path to the dike. When they were
on top, Hauke stopped his horse violently. But where was the sea?
Where Jeverssand? Where had the other shore gone? He saw only
mountains of water before him that rose threateningly against the
dark sky, that were trying to tower above one another in the dreadful
dusk and beat over one another against the solid land. With white
crests they rushed on, howling, as if they uttered the outcry of all
terrible beasts of prey in the wilderness. The horse kicked and
snorted out into the uproar; a feeling came over the rider that here
all human power was at an end; that now death, night, and chaos must
break in.</p>

<p>But he stopped to think: this really was the storm flood; only he
himself had never seen it like this. His wife, his child, were safe
on the high hill, in the solid house. His dike-and something like
pride shot through his breast-the Hauke-Haien dike, as the people
called it, now should show how dikes ought to be built!</p>

<p>But-what was that? He stopped at the corner between the two dikes;
where were the men whom he had placed there to keep watch? He glanced
to the north up at the old dike; for he had ordered some there too.
But neither here nor there could he see a man. He rode a way further
out, but he was still alone; only the blowing of the wind and the
roar of the sea all the way from an immeasurable distance beat with
deafening force against his ear. He turned his horse back again; he
reached the deserted corner and let his eyes wander along the line of
the new dike. He discerned clearly that the waves were here rolling
on more slowly, less violently; there it seemed almost as if there
were a different sea. "That will stand all right!" he murmured, and
something like a laugh rose within him.</p>

<p>But his laughter vanished when his eyes wandered farther along the
line of his dike: in the northwestern corner-what was that? A dark
mass was swarming in confusion; he saw that it was stirring busily
and crowding-no doubt, there were people! What were they doing, what
were they working for now at his dike? Instantly his spurs dug into
the shanks of his horse, and the animal sped thither. The storm
rushed on broadside; at times the gusts of wind were so violent, that
they would almost have been hurled from the dike into the new
land-but horse and rider knew where they were riding. Already Hauke
saw that a few dozen men were gathered there in eager work, and now
he saw clearly that a groove was dug diagonally across the new dike.
Forcibly he stopped his horse: "Stop!" he shouted, "stop! What
devil's mischief are you doing there?"</p>

<p>In their fright they had let their spades rest, when they had
suddenly spied the dikemaster among them. The wind had carried his
words over to them, and he noticed that several were trying to answer
him; but he saw only their violent gestures, for they stood to the
left of him and their words were blown away by the wind which here at
times was throwing the men reeling against each other, so that they
gathered close together. Hauke measured the dug-in groove with his
quick glance and the might of the water which in spite of the new
profile, splashed almost to the top of the dike and sprayed horse and
rider. Only ten minutes more of work-he saw that clearly-and the
flood would break through the groove and the Hauke-Haien-land would
be drowned by the sea!</p>

<p>The dikemaster beckoned one of the workmen to the other side of
his horse. "Now, tell me," he shouted, "what are you doing here? What
does that mean?"</p>

<p>And the man shouted back: "We are to dig through the new dike,
sir, so that the old dike won't break."</p>

<p>"What are you to do?"</p>

<p>"Dig through the new dike."</p>

<p>"And drown the land? What devil has ordered that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, no devil, the overseer Ole Peters has been here and
ordered it."</p>

<p>Rage surged into the rider's eyes. "Do you know me?" he shouted.
"Where I am, Ole Peters can't give any orders! Away with you! Go to
your posts, where I put you!"</p>

<p>And when they hesitated, he made his horse gallop in among them.
"Away to your own or the devil's grandmother!"</p>

<p>"Sir, take care!" cried one of the crowd and hit his spade against
the animal that acted as if it were mad; but a kick of its hoof flung
the spade from his hand; another man fell to the ground. Then all at
once a scream rose from the rest of the crowd-a scream such as only
the fear of death can call forth from the throat of man. For a moment
all, even the dikemaster and the horse were benumbed. Only one
workman had stretched out his arm like a road sign and pointed to the
northwestern corner of both dikes where the new one joined the old.
Nothing could be heard but the raging of the storm and the roar of
the water. Hauke turned round in his saddle: what was that? His eyes
grew big: "Lord God! A break! A break in the old dike!"</p>

<p>"Your fault, dikemaster!" shouted a voice out of the crowd; "your
fault! Take it with you before the throne of God."</p>

<p>Hauke's face, red with rage, had turned deathly pale; the moon
that shone upon it could not make it any paler; his arms hung down
limply; he scarcely knew that he was holding his reins. But that,
too, was only for a moment. Instantly he pulled himself erect with a
heavy moan; then he turned his horse silently, and the white horse
snorted and tore away with him eastward upon the dike. The rider
glanced sharply to all sides; in his head these thoughts were raging:
what fault had he to bear to God's throne? The digging through of the
new dike-perhaps they would have accomplished it, if he had not
stopped them; but-there was something else that shot seething into
his heart, because he knew it all too well-if only, last summer, Ole
Peters's malicious words hadn't kept him back-that was the point. He
alone had recognised the weakness of the old dike; he ought to have
seen the new repairs through in spite of all. "Lord God, yes, I
confess it," he cried out aloud suddenly into the storm: "I have
fulfilled my task badly."</p>

<p>To his left, close to the horse's the sea was raging; in front of
him, now in complete darkness lay the old enclosed land with its
hills and homelike houses. The pale light of the sky had gone out
altogether; from one point only a glimmer of light broke through the
dark. A solace came into the man's heart: the light must have been
shining over from his own house. It seemed like a greeting from wife
and child. Thank God, they were safe on their high hill! The others
surely were up in the village of the higher land, for more lights
were glimmering there than he had ever seen before. Yes, even high up
in the air, perhaps from the church steeple, light was piercing the
darkness. "They must all have left-all!" said Hauke to himself; "to
be sure, on many a hill the houses will lie in ruins; a bad year will
come for the flooded fens; sluices and locks will have to be
repaired! We'll have to bear it and I will help even those who did me
harm; only, Lord, my God, be merciful to us human beings!"</p>

<p>Then he cast a glance to his side at the new enclosed land; the
sea foamed round it, but the land lay as if the peace of night were
upon it. An inevitable sense of triumph rose out of the rider's
breast. "The Hauke-Haien dike will hold all right, it will hold after
a hundred years!"</p>

<p>A thundering roar at his feet waked him out of his dreams; the
horse refused to go on. What was that? The horse bounded back, and he
felt that a piece of the dike was crashing into the depth right
before him. He opened his eyes wide and shook off all his pondering:
he was stopping by the old dike; his horse had already planted his
forelegs upon it. Instinctively he pulled his horse back. Then the
last mantle of clouds uncovered the moon, and the mild light shone on
all the horror that was rushing, foaming and hissing into the depth
before him, down into the old land.</p>

<p>Hauke stared at it, as if bereft of his senses; this was a deluge
to devour beasts and men. Then the light glimmered to his eyes again,
the same that he had seen before; it was still burning up on his
hill. When he looked down into the land now, encouraged as he was, he
perceived that behind the chaotic whirlpool that was pouring down,
raging in front of him, only a breadth of about a hundred paces was
flooded; beyond he could recognise clearly the path that led through
the land. He saw still more: a carriage, no, a two-wheeled cart was
driven like mad toward the dike; in it sat a woman-yes, a child too.
And now-was that not the barking of a little dog that reached his
ears through the storm? Almighty God! It was his wife, his child;
already they were coming close, and the foaming mass of water was
rushing toward them. A scream, a scream of despair broke forth from
the rider's breast: "Elke!" he screamed; "Elke! Back! Back!"</p>

<p>But the storm and sea were not merciful, their raving scattered
his words. The wind had caught his cloak and almost torn him down
from his horse; and the cart was speeding on without pause towards
the rushing flood. Then he saw that his wife was stretching out her
arms as if toward him. Had she recognised him? Had her longing, her
deathly fear for him driven her out of her safe house? And now-was
she crying a last word to him? These questions shot through his
brain; they were never answered, for from her to him, and from him to
her, their words were all lost. Only a roar as if the world were
coming to an end filled their ears and let no other sound enter.</p>

<p>"My child! Oh, Elke, oh, faithful Elke!" Hauke shouted out into
the storm. Then another great piece of the dike fell crashing into
the depth, and the sea rushed after it, thundering. Once more he saw
the head of the horse below, saw the wheels of the cart emerge out of
the wild horror and then, caught in an eddy, sink underneath it and
drown. The staring eyes of the rider, who was left all alone on the
dike, saw nothing more. "The end!" he said, in a low voice to
himself. Then he rode up to the abyss where the water, gurgling
gruesomely, was beginning to flood his home village. Still he saw the
light glimmer from his house; it was soulless now. He drew himself up
erect, and drove the spurs into his horse's shanks; the horse reared
and would almost have fallen over, but the man's force held it down.
"Go on!" he called once more, as he had called so often when he
wanted a brisk ride. "Lord God, take me, save the others!"</p>

<p>One more prick of the spurs; a scream from the horse that rose
above the storm and the roar of the waves-then from the rushing
stream below a muffled sound, a short struggle.</p>

<p>The moon shone from her height, but down on the dike there was no
more life, only the wild waters that soon had almost wholly flooded
the old land. But the hill of Hauke Haien's farm was still rising
above the turmoil, the light was still glimmering there and from the
higher land, where the houses were gradually growing darker, the
lonely light in the church steeple sent its quivering gleams over the
foaming waves.</p>

<p>The story-teller stopped. I took hold of my full glass that had
for a long time been standing before me, but I did not raise it to my
lips; my hand remained on the table.</p>

<p>"That is the story of Hauke Haien," my host began again, "as I
have been able to tell it according to my best knowledge. To be sure,
the housekeeper of our dikemaster would have told it differently. For
people tell this too: the white horse skeleton was seen after the
flood again, just as before, by moonlight on Jevers Island; the whole
village is supposed to have seen it. But this is certain: Hauke Haien
with wife and child perished in this flood. Not even their graves
have I been able to find up in the churchyard; their dead bodies must
have been carried by the receding water through the breach into the
sea and gradually have been dissolved into their elements on the sea
bottom-thus they were left in peace by men at last. But the
Hauke-Haien dike is still standing after a hundred years, and
to-morrow, if you are going to ride to the city and don't mind half
an hour's longer way, your horse will feel it under its hoofs.</p>

<p>"The thanks of a younger generation that Jewe Manners had once
promised the builder of the dike he never received, as you have seen.
For that is the way, sir: Socrates they gave poison to drink, and our
Lord Christ they nailed to the cross. That can't be done so easily
nowadays, but-making a saint out of a tyrant or a bad, stubborn
priest, or turning a good fellow, just because he towers above us by
a head, into a ghost or a monster-that's still done every day."</p>

<p>When the serious little man had said that, he got up and listened
into the night. "Some change must have gone on outside," he said, and
drew the woolen covering from the window. There was bright moonlight.
"Look," he went on, "there the overseers are coming back; but they
are scattering, they are going home. There must have been a break in
the dike on the other shore; the water has sunk."</p>

<p>I looked out beside him. The windows up here were above the edge
of the dike; everything was just as he had said. I took up my glass
and drank the rest: "I thank you for this evening. I think now we can
sleep in peace."</p>

<p>"We can," replied the little gentleman; "I wish you heartily a
good night's sleep."</p>

<p>As I walked downstairs, I met the dikemaster in the hall; he
wanted to take home a map that he had left in the tavern. "All over!"
he said. "But our schoolmaster, I suppose, has told you a fine
story-he belongs to the enlighteners!"</p>

<p>"He seems to be a sensible man."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, surely; but you can't distrust your own eyes. And over
there on the other side-I said it would-the dike is broken."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "You will have to think that over in bed.
Good night, dikemaster."</p>

<p>The next morning, in the golden sunlight that shone over wide
ruin, I rode down to the city on the Hauke-Haien dike.</p>
