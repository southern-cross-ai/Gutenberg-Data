<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">LIKE the Conan epos, the stories featuring King Kull are set in a pseudo-historical period that Robert E. Howard called the "Hyborian Age." He described this era in some detail in an essay published under the homonymous title in the February 1936 issue of <i>The Phantagraph</i>. The following excerpts provide a context for the present story. The complete essay is available here:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603571h.html">
The Hyborian Age</a></p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"OF that epoch known by the Nemedian chroniclers as the Pre-Cataclysmic Age, little is known except the latter part, and that is veiled in the mists of legendry. Known history begins with the waning of the Pre-Cataclysmic civilization, dominated by the kingdoms of Kamelia, Valusia, Verulia, Grondar, Thule and Commoria. These peoples spoke a similar language, arguing a common origin. There were other kingdoms, equally civilized, but inhabited by different, and apparently older races.</p>

<p class="quote">"The barbarians of that age were the Picts, who lived on islands far out on the western ocean; the Atlanteans, who dwelt on a small continent between the Pictish Islands and the main, or Thurian Continent; and the Lemurians, who inhabited a chain of large islands in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p class="quote">"There were vast regions of unexplored land. The civilized kingdoms, though enormous in extent, occupied a comparatively small portion of the whole planet. Valusia was the western-most kingdom of the Thurian Continent; Grondar the eastern-most. East of Grondar, whose people were less highly cultured than those of their kindred kingdoms, stretched a wild and barren expanse of deserts. Among the less arid stretches of desert, in the jungles, and among the mountains, lived scattered clans and tribes of primitive savages. Far to the south there was a mysterious civilization, unconnected with the Thurian culture, and apparently pre-human in its nature. On the far-eastern shores of the Continent there lived another race, human, but mysterious and non-Thurian, with which the Lemurians from time to time came in contact. They apparently came from a shadowy and nameless continent lying somewhere east of the Lemurian Islands.</p>

<p class="quote">"The Thurian civilization was crumbling; their armies were composed largely of barbarian mercenaries. Picts, Atlanteans and Lemurians were their generals, their statesmen, often their kings. Of the bickerings of the kingdoms, and the wars between Valusia and Commoria, as well as the conquests by which the Atlanteans founded a kingdom on the mainland, there were more legends than accurate history."</p>

<h2><a id="shadow1" name="shadow1"></a>I. &mdash; A KING COMES RIDING</h2>

<p class="first">THE blare of the trumpets grew louder, like a
deep golden tide surge, like the soft booming of the evening
tides against the silver beaches of Valusia. The throng shouted,
women flung roses from the roofs as the rhythmic chiming of
silver hosts came clearer and the first of the mighty array swung
into view in the broad white street that curved round the golden-spired Tower of Splendor.</p>

<p>First came the trumpeters, slim youths, clad in scarlet,
riding with a flourish of long, slender golden trumpets; next the
bowmen, tall men from the mountains; and behind these the heavily
armed footmen, their broad shields clashing in unison, their long
spears swaying in perfect rhythm to their stride. Behind them
came the mightiest soldiery in all the world, the Red Slayers,
horsemen, splendidly mounted, armed in red from helmet to spur.
Proudly they sat their steeds, looking neither to right nor to
left, but aware of the shouting for all that. Like bronze statues
they were, and there was never a waver in the forest of spears
that reared above them.</p>

<p>Behind those proud and terrible ranks came the motley files of
the mercenaries, fierce, wild-looking warriors, men of Mu and of
Kaa-u and of the hills of the east and the isles of the west.
They bore spears and heavy swords, and a compact group that
marched somewhat apart were the bowmen of Lemuria. Then came the
light foot of the nation, and more trumpeters brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>A brave sight, and a sight which aroused a fierce thrill in
the soul of Kull, king of Valusia. Not on the Topaz Throne at the
front of the regal Tower of Splendor sat Kull, but in the saddle,
mounted on a great stallion, a true warrior king. His mighty arm
swung up in reply to the salutes as the hosts passed. His fierce
eyes passed the gorgeous trumpeters with a casual glance, rested
longer on the following soldiery; they blazed with a ferocious
light as the Red Slayers halted in front of him with a clang of
arms and a rearing of steeds, and tendered him the crown salute.
They narrowed slightly as the mercenaries strode by. They saluted
no one, the mercenaries. They walked with shoulders flung back,
eyeing Kull boldly and straightly, albeit with a certain
appreciation; fierce eyes, unblinking; savage eyes, staring from
beneath shaggy manes and heavy brows.</p>

<p>And Kull gave back a like stare. He granted much to brave men,
and there were no braver in all the world, not even among the
wild tribesmen who now disowned him. But Kull was too much the
savage to have any great love for these. There were too many
feuds. Many were age-old enemies of Kull's nation, and though the
name of Kull was now a word accursed among the mountains and
valleys of his people, and though Kull had put them from his
mind, yet the old hates, the ancient passions still lingered. For
Kull was no Valusian but an Atlantean.</p>

<p>The armies swung out of sight around the gemblazing shoulders
of the Tower of Splendor and Kull reined his stallion about and
started toward the palace at an easy gait, discussing the review
with the commanders that rode with him, using not many words, but
saying much.</p>

<p>"The army is like a sword," said Kull, "and must not be
allowed to rust." So down the street they rode, and Kull gave no
heed to any of the whispers that reached his hearing from the
throngs that still swarmed the streets.</p>

<p>"That is Kull, see! Valka! But what a king! And what a man!
Look at his arms! His shoulders!"</p>

<p>And an undertone of more sinister whispering:</p>

<p>"Kull! Ha, accursed usurper from the pagan isles." "Aye, shame
to Valusia that a barbarian sits on the Throne of Kings."</p>

<p>Little did Kull heed. Heavy-handed had he seized the decaying
throne of ancient Valusia and with a heavier hand did he hold it,
a man against a nation.</p>

<p>After the council chamber, the social palace where Kull
replied to the formal and laudatory phrases of the lords and
ladies, with carefully hidden grim amusement at such frivolities;
then the lords and ladies took their formal departure and Kull
leaned back upon the ermine throne and contemplated matters of
state until an attendant requested permission from the great king
to speak, and announced an emissary from the Pictish embassy.</p>

<p>Kull brought his mind back from the dim mazes of Valusian
statecraft where it had been wandering, and gazed upon the Pict
with little favor. The man gave back the gaze of the king without
flinching. He was a lean-hipped, massive-chested warrior of
middle height, dark, like all his race, and strongly built. From
strong, immobile features gazed dauntless and inscrutable
eyes.</p>

<p>"The chief of the Councilors, Ka-nu of the tribe, right hand
of the king of Pictdom, sends greetings and says: "'There is a
throne at the feast of the rising moon for Kull, king of kings,
lord of lords, emperor of Valusia.'"</p>

<p>"Good," answered Kull. "Say to Ka-nu the Ancient, ambassador
of the western isles, that the king of Valusia will quaff wine
with him when the moon floats over the hills of Zalgara."</p>

<p>Still the Pict lingered. "I have a word for the king,
not"&mdash;with a contemptuous flirt of his hand&mdash;"for these
slaves."</p>

<p>Kull dismissed the attendants with a word, watching the Pict
warily.</p>

<p>The man stepped nearer, and lowered his voice:</p>

<p>"Come alone to feast tonight, lord king. Such was the word of
my chief."</p>

<p>The king's eyes narrowed, gleaming like gray sword steel,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>They eyed each other silently, their mutual tribal enmity
seething beneath their cloak of formality. Their mouths spoke the
cultured speech, the conventional court phrases of a highly
polished race, a race not their own, but from their eyes gleamed
the primal traditions of the elemental savage. Kull might be the
king of Valusia and the Pict might be an emissary to her courts,
but there in the throne hall of kings, two tribesmen glowered at
each other, fierce and wary, while ghosts of wild wars and world-ancient feuds whispered to each.</p>

<p>To the king was the advantage and he enjoyed it to its fullest
extent. Jaw resting on hand, he eyed the Pict, who stood like an
image of bronze, head flung back, eyes unflinching.</p>

<p>Across Kull's lips stole a smile that was more a sneer.</p>

<p>"And so I am to come&mdash;alone?" Civilization had taught him
to speak by innuendo and the Pict's dark eyes glittered, though
he made no reply. "How am I to know that you come from
Ka-nu?"</p>

<p>"I have spoken," was the sullen response.</p>

<p>"And when did a Pict speak truth?" sneered Kull, fully aware
that the Picts never lied, but using this means to enrage the
man.</p>

<p>"I see your plan, king," the Pict answered imperturbably. "You
wish to anger me. By Valka, you need go no further! I am angry
enough. And I challenge you to meet me in single battle, spear,
sword or dagger, mounted or afoot. Are you king or man?"</p>

<p>Kull's eyes glinted with the grudging admiration a warrior
must needs give a bold foeman, but he did not fail to use the
chance of further annoying his antagonist.</p>

<p>"A king does not accept the challenge of a nameless savage,"
he sneered, "nor does the emperor of Valusia break the Truce of
Ambassadors. You have leave to go. Say to Ka-nu I will come
alone."</p>

<p>The Pict's eyes flashed murderously. He fairly shook in the
grasp of the primitive blood-lust; then, turning his back
squarely upon the king of Valusia, he strode across the Hall of
Society and vanished through the great door.</p>

<p>Again Kull leaned back upon the ermine throne and
meditated.</p>

<p>So the chief of the Council of Picts wished him to come alone?
But for what reason? Treachery? Grimly Kull touched the hilt of
his great sword. But scarcely. The Picts valued too greatly the
alliance with Valusia to break it for any feudal reason. Kull
might be a warrior of Atlantis and hereditary enemy of all Picts,
but too, he was king of Valusia, the most potent ally of the Men
of the West.</p>

<p>Kull reflected long upon the strange state of affairs that
made him ally of ancient foes and foe of ancient friends. He rose
and paced restlessly across the hall, with the quick, noiseless
tread of a lion. Chains of friendship, tribe and tradition had he
broken to satisfy his ambition. And, by Valka, god of the sea and
the land, he had realized that ambition! He was king of
Valusia&mdash;a fading, degenerate Valusia, a Valusia living
mostly in dreams of bygone glory, but still a mighty land and the
greatest of the Seven Empires. Valusia&mdash;Land of Dreams, the
tribesmen named it, and sometimes it seemed to Kull that he moved
in a dream. Strange to him were the intrigues of court and
palace, army and people. All was like a masquerade, where men and
women hid their real thoughts with a smooth mask. Yet the seizing
of the throne had been easy&mdash;a bold snatching of
opportunity, the swift whirl of swords, the slaying of a tyrant
of whom men had wearied unto death, short, crafty plotting with
ambitious statesmen out of favor at court&mdash;and Kull,
wandering adventurer, Atlantean exile, had swept up to the dizzy
heights of his dreams: he was lord of Valusia, king of kings. Yet
now it seemed that the seizing was far easier than the keeping.
The sight of the Pict had brought back youthful associations to
his mind, the free, wild savagery of his boyhood. And now a
strange feeling of dim unrest, of unreality, stole over him as of
late it had been doing. Who was he, a straightforward man of the
seas and the mountain, to rule a race strangely and terribly wise
with the mysticisms of antiquity? An ancient race...</p>

<p>"I am Kull!" said he, flinging back his head as a lion flings
back his mane. "I am Kull!"</p>

<p>His falcon gaze swept the ancient hall. His self-confidence
flowed back... And in a dim nook of the hall a tapestry
moved&mdash;slightly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="shadow2" name="shadow2"></a>
II. &mdash; THUS SPAKE THE SILENT HALLS OF VALUSIA</h2>

<p class="first">THE moon had not risen, and the garden was
lighted with torches aglow in silver cressets when Kull sat down
on the throne before the table of Ka-nu, ambassador of the
western isles. At his right hand sat the ancient Pict, as much
unlike an emissary of that fierce race as a man could be. Ancient
was Ka-nu and wise in statecraft, grown old in the game. There
was no elemental hatred in the eyes that looked at Kull
appraisingly; no Tribal traditions hindered his judgments. Long
associations with the statesmen of the civilized nations had
swept away such cobwebs. Not: who and what is this man? was the
question ever foremost in Ka-nu's mind, but: can I use this man,
and how? Tribal prejudices he used only to further his own
schemes.</p>

<p>And Kull watched Ka-nu, answering his conversation briefly,
wondering if civilization would make of him a thing like the
Pict. For Ka-nu was soft and paunchy. Many years had stridden
across the sky-rim since Ka-nu had wielded a sword. True, he was
old, but Kull had seen men older than he in the forefront of
battle. The Picts were a long-lived race. A beautiful girl stood
at Ka-nu's elbow, refilling his goblet, and she was kept busy.
Meanwhile Ka-nu kept up a running fire of jests and comments, and
Kull, secretly contemptuous of his garrulity, nevertheless missed
none of his shrewd humor.</p>

<p>At the banquet were Pictish chiefs and statesmen, the latter
jovial and easy in their manner, the warriors formally courteous,
but plainly hampered by their tribal affinities. Yet Kull, with a
tinge of envy, was cognizant of the freedom and ease of the
affair as contrasted with like affairs of the Valusian court.
Such freedom prevailed in the rude camps of Atlantis&mdash;Kull
shrugged his shoulders. After all, doubtless Ka-nu, who had
seemed to have forgotten he was a Pict as far as time-hoary
custom and prejudice went, was right and he, Kull, would better
become a Valusian in mind as in name.</p>

<p>At last when the moon had reached her zenith, Ka-nu, having
eaten and drunk as much as any three men there, leaned back upon
his divan with a comfortable sigh and said, "Now, get you gone,
friends, for the king and I would converse on such matters as
concern not children. Yes, you too, my pretty; yet first let me
kiss those ruby lips&mdash;so; no, dance away, my rose-bloom."</p>

<p>Ka-nu's eyes twinkled above his white beard as he surveyed
Kull, who sat erect, grim and uncompromising.</p>

<p>"You are thinking, Kull," said the old statesman, suddenly,
"that Ka-nu is a useless old reprobate, fit for nothing except to
guzzle wine and kiss wenches!"</p>

<p>In fact, this remark was so much in line with his actual
thoughts, and so plainly put, that Kull was rather startled,
though he gave no sign.</p>

<p>Ka-nu gurgled and his paunch shook with his mirth. "Wine is
red and women are soft," he remarked tolerantly. "But&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;think not old Ka-nu allows either to interfere with
business."</p>

<p>Again he laughed, and Kull moved restlessly. This seemed much
like being made sport of, and the king's scintillant eyes began
to glow with a feline light.</p>

<p>Ka-nu reached for the wine-pitcher, filled his beaker and
glanced questoningly at Kull, who shook his head irritably.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Ka-nu equably, "it takes an old head to stand
strong drink. I am growing old, Kull, so why should you young men
begrudge me such pleasures as we oldsters must find? Ah me, I
grow ancient and withered, friendless and cheerless."</p>

<p>But his looks and expressions failed far of bearing out his
words. His rubicund countenance fairly glowed, and his eyes
sparkled, so that his white beard seemed incongruous. Indeed, he
looked remarkably elfin, reflected Kull, who felt vaguely
resentful. The old scoundrel had lost all of the primitive
virtues of his race and of Kull's race, yet he seemed more
pleased in his aged days than otherwise.</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Kull," said Ka-nu, raising an admonitory finger,
"'tis a chancy thing to laud a young man, yet I must speak my
true thoughts to gain your confidence."</p>

<p>"If you think to gain it by flattery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush. Who spake of flattery? I flatter only to disguard."</p>

<p>There was a keen sparkle in Ka-nu's eyes, a cold glimmer that
did not match his lazy smile. He knew men, and he knew that to
gain his end he must smite straight with this tigerish barbarian,
who, like a wolf scenting a snare, would scent out unerringly any
falseness in the skein of his word-web.</p>

<p>"You have power, Kull," said he, choosing his words with more
care than he did in the council rooms of the nation, "to make
yourself mightiest of all kings, and restore some of the lost
glories of Valusia. So. I care little for Valusia&mdash;though
the women and wine be excellent&mdash;save for the fact that the
stronger Valusia is, the stronger is the Pict nation. More, with
an Atlantean on the throne, eventually Atlantis will become
united&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kull laughed in harsh mockery. Ka-nu had touched an old
wound.</p>

<p>"Atlantis made my name accursed when I went to seek fame and
fortune among the cities of the world. We&mdash;they&mdash;are
age-old foes of the Seven Empires, greater foes of the allies of
the Empires, as you should know."</p>

<p>Ka-nu tugged his beard and smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay. Let it pass. But I know whereof I speak. And then
warfare will cease, wherein there is no gain; I see a world of
peace and prosperity&mdash;man loving his fellow man&mdash;the
good supreme. All this can you accomplish&mdash;<i>if you
live</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" Kull's lean hand closed on his hilt and he half rose,
with a sudden movement of such dynamic speed that Ka-nu, who
fancied men as some men fancy blooded horses, felt his old blood
leap with a sudden thrill. Valka, what a warrior! Nerves and
sinews of steel and fire, bound together with the perfect co-ordination, the fighting instinct, that makes the terrible
warrior.</p>

<p>But none of Ka-nu's enthusiasm showed in his mildly sarcastic
tone.</p>

<p>"Tush. Be seated. Look about you. The gardens are deserted,
the seats empty, save for ourselves. You fear not <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>Kull sank back, gazing about him warily.</p>

<p>"There speaks the savage," mused Ka-nu. "Think you if I
planned treachery I would enact it here where suspicion would be
sure to fall upon me? Tut. You young tribesmen have much to
learn. There were my chiefs who were not at ease because you were
born among the hills of Atlantis, and you despise me in your
secret mind because I am a Pict. Tush. I see you as Kull, king of
Valusia, not as Kull, the reckless Atlantean, leader of the
raiders who harried the western isles. So you should see in me,
not a Pict but an international man, a figure of the world. Now
to that figure, hark! If you were slain tomorrow who would be
king?"</p>

<p>"Kaanuub, baron of Blaal."</p>

<p>"Even so. I object to Kaanuub for many reasons, yet most of
all for the fact that he is but a figurehead."</p>

<p>"How so? He was my greatest opponent, but I did not know that
he championed any cause but his own."</p>

<p>"The night can hear," answered Ka-nu obliquely. "There are
worlds within worlds. But you may trust me and you may trust
Brule, the Spear-slayer. Look!" He drew from his robes a bracelet
of gold representing a winged dragon coiled thrice, with three
horns of ruby on the head.</p>

<p>"Examine it closely. Brule will wear it on his arm when he
comes to you tomorrow night so that you may know him. Trust Brule
as you trust yourself, and do what he tells you to. And in proof
of trust, look ye!"</p>

<p>And with the speed of a striking hawk, the ancient snatched
something from his robes, something that flung a weird green
light over them, and which he replaced in an instant.</p>

<p>"The stolen gem!" exclaimed Kull recoiling. "The green jewel
from the Temple of the Serpent! Valka! You! And why do you show
it to me?"</p>

<p>"To save your life. To prove my trust. If I betray your trust,
deal with me likewise. You hold my life in your hand. Now I could
not be false to you if I would, for a word from you would be my
doom."</p>

<p>Yet for all his words the old scoundrel beamed merrily and
seemed vastly pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"But why do you give me this hold over you?" asked Kull,
becoming more bewildered each second.</p>

<p>"As I told you. Now, you see that I do not intend to deal you
false, and tomorrow night when Brule comes to you, you will
follow his advice without fear of treachery. Enough. An escort
waits outside to ride to the palace with you, lord."</p>

<p>Kull rose. "But you have told me nothing."</p>

<p>"Tush. How impatient are youths!" Ka-nu looked more like a
mischievous elf than ever. "Go you and dream of thrones and power
and kingdoms, while I dream of wine and soft women and roses. And
fortune ride with you, King Kull."</p>

<p>As he left the garden, Kull glanced back to see Ka-nu still
reclining lazily in his seat, a merry ancient, beaming on all the
world with jovial fellowship.</p>

<p><br>
A MOUNTED warrior waited for the king just without the garden
and Kull was slightly surprised to see that it was the same that
had brought Ka-nu's invitation. No word was spoken as Kull swung
into the saddle nor as they clattered along the empty
streets.</p>

<p>The color and the gayety of the day had given way to the eerie
stillness of night. The city's antiquity was more than ever
apparent beneath the bent, silver moon. The huge pillars of the
mansions and palaces towered up into the stars. The broad
stairways, silent and deserted, seemed to climb endlessly until
they vanished in the shadowy darkness of the upper realms. Stairs
to the stars, thought Kull, his imaginative mind inspired by the
weird grandeur of the scene.</p>

<p>Clang! clang! clang! sounded the silver hoofs on the broad,
moon-flooded streets, but otherwise there was no sound. The age
of the city, its incredible antiquity, was almost oppressive to
the king; it was as if the great silent buildings laughed at him,
noiselessly, with unguessable mockery. And what secrets did they
hold?</p>

<p>"You are young," said the palaces and the temples and the
shrines, "but we are old. The world was wild with youth when we
were reared. You and your tribe shall pass, but we are
invincible, indestructible. We towered above a strange world, ere
Atlantis and Lemuria rose from the sea; we still shall reign when
the green waters sigh for many a restless fathom above the spires
of Lemuria and the hills of Atlantis and when the isles of the
Western Men are the mountains of a strange land.</p>

<p>"How many kings have we watched ride down these streets before
Kull of Atlantis was even a dream in the mind of Ka, bird of
Creation? Ride on, Kull of Atlantis; greater shall follow you;
greater came before you. They are dust; they are forgotten; we
stand; we know; we are. Ride, ride on, Kull of Atlantis; Kull the
king, Kull the fool!"</p>

<p>And it seemed to Kull that the clashing hoofs took up the
silent refrain to beat it into the night with hollow re-echoing
mockery:</p>

<p>"Kull-the-king! Kull-the-fool!"</p>

<p>Glow, moon; you light a king's way! Gleam, stars; you are
torches in the train of an emperor! And clang, silver-shod hoofs;
you herald that Kull rides through Valusia.</p>

<p>Ho! Awake, Valusia! It is Kull that rides, Kull the king!</p>

<p>"We have known many kings," said the silent halls of
Valusia.</p>

<p>And so in a brooding mood Kull came to the palace, where his
bodyguard, men of the Red Slayers, came to take the rein of the
great stallion and escort Kull to his rest. There the Pict, still
sullenly speechless, wheeled his steed with a savage wrench of
the rein and fled away in the dark like a phantom; Kull's
heightened imagination pictured him speeding through the silent
streets like a goblin out of the Elder World.</p>

<p>There was no sleep for Kull that night, for it was nearly dawn
and he spent the rest of the night hours pacing the throne-room,
and pondering over what had passed. Ka-nu had told him nothing,
yet he had put himself in Kull's complete power. At what had he
hinted when he had said the baron of Blaal was naught but a
figurehead? And who was this Brule who was to come to him by
night, wearing the mystic armlet of the dragon? And why? Above
all, why had Ka-nu shown him the green gem of terror, stolen long
ago from the temple of the Serpent, for which the world would
rock in wars were it known to the weird and terrible keepers of
that temple, and from whose vengeance not even Ka-nu's ferocious
tribesmen might be able to save him? But Ka-nu knew he was safe,
reflected Kull, for the statesman was too shrewd to expose
himself to risk without profit. But was it to throw the king off
his guard and pave the way to treachery? Would Ka-nu dare let him
live now? Kull shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="shadow3" name="shadow3"></a>III. &mdash; THEY THAT WALK THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">THE moon had not risen when Kull, hand to hilt,
stepped to a window. The windows opened upon the great inner
gardens of the royal palace, and the breezes of the night,
bearing the scents of spice trees, blew the filmy curtains about.
The king looked out. The walks and groves were deserted;
carefully trimmed trees were bulky shadows; fountains near by
flung their slender sheen of silver in the starlight and distant
fountains rippled steadily. No guards walked those gardens, for
so closely were the outer walls guarded that it seemed impossible
for any invader to gain access to them.</p>

<p>Vines curled up the walls of the palace, and even as Kull
mused upon the ease with which they might be climbed, a segment
of shadow detached itself from the darkness below the window and
a bare, brown arm curved up over the sill. Kull's great sword
hissed halfway from the sheath; then the King halted. Upon the
muscular forearm gleamed the dragon armlet shown him by Ka-nu the
night before.</p>

<p>The possessor of the arm pulled himself up over the sill and
into the room with the swift, easy motion of a climbing
leopard.</p>

<p>"You are Brule?" asked Kull, and then stopped in surprise not
unmingled with annoyance and suspicion; for the man was he whom
Kull had taunted in the Hall of Society; the same who had
escorted him from the Pictish embassy.</p>

<p>"I am Brule, the Spear-slayer," answered the Pict in a guarded
voice; then swiftly, gazing closely in Kull's face, he said,
barely above a whisper:</p>

<p>"<i>Ka nama kaa lajerama</i>!"</p>

<p>Kull started. "Ha! What mean you?"</p>

<p>"Know you not?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the words are unfamiliar; they are of no language I ever
heard&mdash;and yet, by Valka!&mdash;somewhere&mdash;I have
heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye," was the Pict's only comment. His eyes swept the room,
the study room of the palace. Except for a few tables, a divan or
two and great shelves of books of parchment, the room was barren
compared to the grandeur of the rest of the palace.</p>

<p>"Tell me, king, who guards the door?"</p>

<p>"Eighteen of the Red Slayers. But how come you, stealing
through the gardens by night and scaling the walls of the
palace?"</p>

<p>Brule sneered. "The guards of Valusia are blind buffaloes. I
could steal their girls from under their noses. I stole amid them
and they saw me not nor heard me. And the walls&mdash;I could
scale them without the aid of vines. I have hunted tigers on the
foggy beaches when the sharp east breezes blew the mist in from
seaward and I have climbed the steeps of the western sea
mountain. But come&mdash;nay, touch this armlet."</p>

<p>He held out his arm and, as Kull complied wonderingly, gave an
apparent sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"So. Now throw off those kingly robes; for there are ahead of
you this night such deeds as no Atlantean ever dreamed of."</p>

<p>Brule himself was clad only in a scanty loin-cloth through
which was thrust a short, curved sword.</p>

<p>"And who are you to give me orders?" asked Kull, slightly
resentful.</p>

<p>"Did not Ka-nu bid you follow me in all things?" asked the
Pict irritably, his eyes flashing momentarily. "I have no love
for you, lord, but for the moment I have put the thought of feuds
from my mind. Do you likewise. But come."</p>

<p>Walking noiselessly, he led the way across the room to the
door. A slide in the door allowed a view of the outer corridor,
unseen from without, and the Pict bade Kull look.</p>

<p>"What see you?"</p>

<p>"Naught but the eighteen guardsmen."</p>

<p>The Pict nodded, motioned Kull to follow him across the room.
At a panel in the opposite wall Brule stopped and fumbled there a
moment. Then with a light movement he stepped back, drawing his
sword as he did so. Kull gave an exclamation as the panel swung
silently open, revealing a dimly lighted passageway.</p>

<p>"A secret passage!" swore Kull softly. "And I knew nothing of
it! By Valka, someone shall dance for this!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" hissed the Pict.</p>

<p>Brule was standing like a bronze statue as if straining every
nerve for the slightest sound; something about his attitude made
Kull's hair prickle slightly, not from fear but from some eery
anticipation. Then beckoning, Brule stepped through the secret
doorway which stood open behind them. The passage was bare, but
not dust-covered as should have been the case with an unused
secret corridor. A vague, gray light filtered through somewhere,
but the source of it was not apparent. Every few feet Kull saw
doors, invisible, as he knew, from the outside, but easily
apparent from within.</p>

<p>"The palace is a very honeycomb," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Aye. Night and day you are watched, king, by many eyes."</p>

<p>The king was impressed by Brule's manner. The Pict went
forward slowly, warily, half crouching, blade held low and thrust
forward. When he spoke it was in a whisper and he continually
flung glances from side to side.</p>

<p>The corridor turned sharply and Brule warily gazed past the
turn.</p>

<p>"Look!" he whispered. "But remember! No word! No
sound&mdash;on your life!"</p>

<p>Kull cautiously gazed past him. The corridor changed just at
the bend to a flight of steps. And then Kull recoiled. At the
foot of those stairs lay the eighteen Red Slayers who were that
night stationed to watch the king's study room. Brule's grip upon
his mighty arm and Brule's fierce whisper at his shoulder alone
kept Kull from leaping down those stairs.</p>

<p>"Silent, Kull! Silent, in Valka's name!" hissed the Pict.
"These corridors are empty now, but I risked much in showing you,
that you might then believe what I had to say. Back now to the
room of study." And he retraced his steps, Kull following; his
mind in a turmoil of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"This is treachery," muttered the king, his steel gray eyes
a-smolder, "foul and swift! Mere minutes have passed since those
men stood at guard."</p>

<p>Again in the room of study Brule carefully closed the secret
panel and motioned Kull to look again through the slit of the
outer door. Kull gasped audibly. <i>For without stood the
eighteen guardsmen</i>!</p>

<p>"This is sorcery!" he whispered, half-drawing his sword. "Do
dead men guard the king?"</p>

<p>"<i>Aye</i>!" came Brule's scarcely audible reply; there was a
strange expression in the Pict's scintillant eyes. They looked
squarely into each other's eyes for an instant, Kull's brow
wrinkled in a puzzled scowl as he strove to read the Pict's
inscrutable face. Then Brule's lips, barely moving, formed the
words: "<i>The&mdash;snake&mdash;that&mdash;speaks</i>!"</p>

<p>"Silent!" whispered Kull, laying his hand over Brule's mouth.
"That is death to speak! That is a name accursed!"</p>

<p>The Pict's fearless eyes regarded him steadily.</p>

<p>"Look, again, King Kull. Perchance the guard was changed."</p>

<p>"Nay, those are the same men. In Valka's name, this is
sorcery&mdash;this is insanity! I saw with my own eyes the bodies
of those men, not eight minutes agone. Yet there they stand."</p>

<p>Brule stepped back, away from the door, Kull mechanically
following.</p>

<p>"Kull, what know ye of the traditions of this race ye
rule?"</p>

<p>"Much&mdash;and yet, little. Valusia is so old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye," Brule's eyes lighted strangely, "we are but
barbarians&mdash;infants compared to the Seven Empires. Not even
they themselves know how old they are. Neither the memory of man
nor the annals of the historians reach back far enough to tell us
when the first men came up from the sea and built cities on the
shore. But Kull, <i>men were not always ruled by men</i>!"</p>

<p>The king started. Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Aye, there is a legend of my people&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And mine!" broke in Brule. "That was before we of the isles
were allied with Valusia. Aye, in the reign of Lion-fang, seventh
war chief of the Picts, so many years ago no man remembers how
many. Across the sea we came, from the isles of the sunset,
skirting the shores of Atlantis, and falling upon the beaches of
Valusia with fire and sword. Aye, the long white beaches
resounded with the clash of spears, and the night was like day
from the flame of the burning castles. And the king, the king of
Valusia, who died on the red sea sands that dim day&mdash;" His
voice trailed off; the two stared at each other, neither
speaking; then each nodded.</p>

<p>"Ancient is Valusia!" whispered Kull. "The hills of Atlantis
and Mu were isles of the sea when Valusia was young."</p>

<p>The night breeze whispered through the open window. Not the
free, crisp sea air such as Brule and Kull knew and reveled in,
in their land, but a breath like a whisper from the past, laden
with musk, scents of forgotten things, breathing secrets that
were hoary when the world was young.</p>

<p>The tapestries rustled, and suddenly Kull felt like a naked
child before the inscrutable wisdom of the mystic past. Again the
sense of unreality swept upon him. At the back of his soul stole
dim, gigantic phantoms, whispering monstrous things. He sensed
that Brule experienced similar thoughts. The Pict's eyes were
fixed upon his face with a fierce intensity. Their glances met.
Kull felt warmly a sense of comradeship with this member of an
enemy tribe. Like rival leopards turning at bay against hunters,
these two savages made common cause against the inhuman powers of
antiquity.</p>

<p><br>
BRULE again led the way back to the secret door. Silently they
entered and silently they proceeded down the dim corridor, taking
the opposite direction from that in which they previously
traversed it. After a while the Pict stopped and pressed close to
one of the secret doors, bidding Kull look with him through the
hidden slot.</p>

<p>"This opens upon a little-used stair which leads to a corridor
running past the study-room door."</p>

<p>They gazed, and presently, mounting the stair silently, came a
silent shape.</p>

<p>"Tu! Chief councilor!" exclaimed Kull. "By night and with
bared dagger! How, what means this, Brule?"</p>

<p>"Murder! And foulest treachery!" hissed Brule. "Nay"&mdash;as
Kull would have flung the door aside and leaped forth&mdash;"we
are lost if you meet him here, for more lurk at the foot of those
stairs. Come!"</p>

<p>Half running, they darted back along the passage. Back through
the secret door Brule led, shutting it carefully behind them,
then across the chamber to an opening into a room seldom used.
There he swept aside some tapestries in a dim corner nook and,
drawing Kull with him, stepped behind them. Minutes dragged. Kull
could hear the breeze in the other room blowing the window
curtains about, and it seemed to him like the murmur of ghosts.
Then through the door, stealthily, came Tu, chief councilor of
the king. Evidently he had come through the study room and,
finding it empty, sought his victim where he was most likely to
be.</p>

<p>He came with upraised dagger, walking silently. A moment he
halted, gazing about the apparently empty room, which was lighted
dimly by a single candle. Then he advanced cautiously, apparently
at a loss to understand the absence of the king. He stood before
the hiding place&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Slay!" hissed the Pict.</p>

<p>Kull with a single mighty leap hurled himself into the room.
Tu spun, but the blinding, tigerish speed of the attack gave him
no chance for defense or counterattack. Sword steel flashed in
the dim light and grated on bone as Tu toppled backward, Kull's
sword standing out between his shoulders.</p>

<p>Kull leaned above him, teeth bared in the killer's snarl,
heavy brows ascowl above eyes that were like the gray ice of the
cold sea. Then he released the hilt and recoiled, shaken, dizzy,
the hand of death at his spine.</p>

<p>For as he watched, Tu's face became strangely dim and unreal;
the features mingled and merged in a seemingly impossible manner.
Then, like a fading mask of fog, the face suddenly vanished and
in its stead gaped and leered <i>a monstrous serpent's
head</i>!</p>

<p>"Valka!" gasped Kull, sweat beading his forehead, and again;
"Valka!"</p>

<p>Brule leaned forward, face immobile. Yet his glittering eyes
mirrored something of Kull's horror.</p>

<p>"Regain your sword, lord king," said he. "There are yet deeds
to be done."</p>

<p>Hesitantly Kull set his hand to the hilt. His flesh crawled as
he set his foot upon the terror which lay at their feet, and as
some jerk of muscular reaction caused the frightful mouth to gape
suddenly, he recoiled, weak with nausea. Then, wrathful at
himself, he plucked forth his sword and gazed more closely at the
nameless thing that had been known as Tu, chief councilor. Save
for the reptilian head, the thing was the exact counterpart of a
man.</p>

<p>"A man with the head of a snake!" Kull murmured. "This, then,
is a priest of the serpent god?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Tu sleeps unknowing. These fiends can take any form they
will. That is, they can, by a magic charm or the like, fling a
web of sorcery about their faces, as an actor dons a mask, so
that they resemble anyone they wish to."</p>

<p>"Then the old legends were true," mused the king; "the grim
old tales few dare even whisper, lest they die as blasphemers,
are no fantasies. By Valka, I had thought&mdash;I had
guessed&mdash;but it seems beyond the bounds of reality. Ha! The
guardsmen outside the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They too are snake-men. Hold! What would you do?"</p>

<p>"Slay them!" said Kull between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Strike at the skull if at all," said Brule. "Eighteen wait
without the door and perhaps a score more in the corridors. Hark
ye, king, Ka-nu learned of this plot. His spies have pierced the
inmost fastnesses of the snake priests and they brought hints of
a plot. Long ago he discovered the secret passageways of the
palace, and at his command I studied the map thereof and came
here by night to aid you, lest you die as other kings of Valusia
have died. I came alone for the reason that to send more would
have roused suspicion. Many could not steal into the palace as I
did. Some of the foul conspiracy you have seen. Snake-men guard
your door, and that one, as Tu, could pass anywhere else in the
palace; in the morning, if the priests failed, the real guards
would be holding their places again, nothing knowing, nothing
remembering; there to take the blame if the priests succeeded.
But stay you here while I dispose of this carrion."</p>

<p>So saying, the Pict shouldered the frightful thing stolidly
and vanished with it through another secret panel. Kull stood
alone, his mind a-whirl. Neophytes of the mighty serpent, how
many lurked among his cities? How might he tell the false from
the true? Aye, how many of his trusted councilors, his generals,
were men? He could be certain&mdash;of whom?</p>

<p><br>
THE secret panel swung inward and Brule entered.</p>

<p>"You were swift."</p>

<p>"Aye!" The warrior stepped forward, eyeing the floor. "There
is gore upon the rug. See?"</p>

<p>Kull bent forward; from the corner of his eye he saw a blur of
movement, a glint of steel. Like a loosened bow he whipped erect,
thrusting upward. The warrior sagged upon the sword, his own
clattering to the floor. Even at that instant Kull reflected
grimly that it was appropriate that the traitor should meet his
death upon the sliding, upward thrust used so much by his race.
Then, as Brule slid from the sword to sprawl motionless on the
floor, the face began to merge and fade, and as Kull caught his
breath, his hair a-prickle, the human features vanished and there
the jaws of a great snake gaped hideously, the terrible beady
eyes venomous even in death.</p>

<p>"He was a snake priest all the time!" gasped the king. "Valka!
What an elaborate plan to throw me off my guard! Ka-nu there, is
he a man? Was it Ka-nu to whom I talked in the gardens? Almighty
Valka!" as his flesh crawled with a horrid thought; "are the
people of Valusia men or are they <i>all</i> serpents?"</p>

<p>Undecided he stood, idly seeing that the thing named Brule no
longer wore the dragon armlet. A sound made him wheel.</p>

<p><i>Brule was coming through the secret door</i>.</p>

<p>"Hold!" Upon the arm upthrown to halt the king's hovering
sword gleamed the dragon armlet. "Valka!" The Pict stopped short.
Then a grim smile curled his lips.</p>

<p>"By the gods of the seas! These demons are crafty past
reckoning. For it must be that one lurked in the corridors, and
seeing me go carrying the carcass of that other, took my
appearance. So. I have another to do away with."</p>

<p>"Hold!" there was the menace of death in Kull's voice; "I have
seen two men turn to serpents before my eyes. How may I know if
you are a true man?"</p>

<p>Brule laughed. "For two reasons. King Kull. No snake-man wears
this"&mdash;he indicated the dragon armlet&mdash;"nor can any say
these words," and again Kull heard the strange phrase; "<i>Ka
nama kaa lajerama</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Ka nama kaa lajerama</i>," Kull repeated mechanically.
"Now, where, in Valka's name, have I heard that? I have not! And
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, you remember, Kull," said Brule. "Through the dim
corridors of memory those words lurk; though you never heard them
in this life, yet in the bygone ages they were so terribly
impressed upon the soul mind that never dies, that they will
always strike dim chords in your memory, though you be
reincarnated for a million years to come. For that phrase has
come secretly down the grim and bloody eons, since when,
uncounted centuries ago, those words were watchwords for the race
of men who battled with the grisly beings of the Elder Universe.
For none but a real man of men may speak them, whose jaws and
mouth are shaped different from any other creature. Their meaning
has been forgotten but not the words themselves."</p>

<p>"True," said Kull. "I remember the legends. Valka!" He stopped
short, staring, for suddenly, like the silent swinging wide of a
mystic door, misty, unfathomed reaches opened in the recesses of
his consciousness and for an instant he seemed to gaze back
through the vastness that spanned life and life; seeing through
the vague and ghostly fogs dim shapes reliving dead
centuries&mdash;men in combat with hideous monsters, vanquishing
a planet of frightful terrors. Against a gray, ever-shifting
background moved strange nightmare forms, fantasies of lunacy and
fear; and man, the jest of the gods, the blind, wisdom-less
striver from dust to dust, following the long bloody trail of his
destiny, knowing not why, bestial, blundering, like a great
murderous child, yet feeling somewhere a spark of divine
fire...</p>

<p>Kull drew a hand across his brow, shaken; these sudden
glimpses into the abysses of memory always startled him.</p>

<p>"They are gone," said Brule, as if scanning his secret mind;
"the bird-women, the harpies, the bat-men, the flying fiends, the
wolf-people, the demons, the goblins&mdash;all save such as this
being that lies at our feet, and a few of the wolf-men. Long and
terrible was the war, lasting through the bloody centuries, since
first the first men, risen from the mire of apedom, turned upon
those who then ruled the world.</p>

<p>"And at last mankind conquered, so long ago that naught but
dim legends come to us through the ages. The snake-people were
the last to go, yet at last men conquered even them and drove
them forth into the waste lands of the world, there to mate with
true snakes until some day, say the sages, the horrid breed shall
vanish utterly. Yet the Things returned in crafty guise as men
grew soft and degenerate, forgetting ancient wars. Ah, that was a
grim and secret war! Among the men of the Younger Earth stole the
frightful monsters of the Elder Planet, safeguarded by their
horrid wisdom and mysticisms, taking all forms and shapes, doing
deeds of horror secretly. No man knew who was true man and who
false. No man could trust any man. Yet by means of their own
craft they formed ways by which the false might be known from the
true. Men took for a sign and a standard the figure of the flying
dragon, the winged dinosaur, a monster of past ages, which was
the greatest foe of the serpent. And men used those words which I
spoke to you as a sign and symbol, for as I said, none but a true
man can repeat them. So mankind triumphed. Yet again the fiends
came after the years of forgetfulness had gone by&mdash;for man
is still an ape in that he forgets what is not ever before his
eyes. As priests they came; and for that men in their luxury and
might had by then lost faith in the old religions and worships,
the snake-men, in the guise of teachers of a new and truer cult,
built a monstrous religion about the worship of the serpent god.
Such is their power that it is now death to repeat the old
legends of the snake-people, and people bow again to the serpent
god in new form; and blind fools that they are, the great hosts
of men see no connection between this power and the power men
overthrew eons ago. As priests the snake-men are content to
rule&mdash;and yet&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"Go on." Kull felt an unaccountable stirring of the short hair
at the base of his scalp.</p>

<p>"Kings have reigned as true men in Valusia," the Pict
whispered, "and yet, slain in battle, have died serpents&mdash;as
died he who fell beneath the spear of Lion-fang on the red
beaches when we of the isles harried the Seven Empires. And how
can this be, Lord Kull? These kings were born of women and lived
as men! This&mdash;the true kings died in secret&mdash;as you
would have died tonight&mdash;and priests of the Serpent reigned
in their stead, no man knowing."</p>

<p>Kull cursed between his teeth. "Aye, it must be. No one has
ever seen a priest of the Serpent and lived, that is known. They
live in utmost secrecy."</p>

<p>"The statecraft of the Seven Empires is a mazy, monstrous
thing," said Brule. "There the true men know that among them
glide the spies of the Serpent, and the men who are the Serpent's
allies&mdash;such as Kaanuub, baron of Blaal&mdash;yet no man
dares seek to unmask a suspect lest vengeance befall him. No man
trusts his fellow and the true statesmen dare not speak to each
other what is in the minds of all. Could they be sure, could a
snake-man or plot be unmasked before them all, then would the
power of the Serpent be more than half broken; for all would then
ally and make common cause, sifting out the traitors. Ka-nu alone
is of sufficient shrewdness and courage to cope with them, and
even Ka-nu learned only enough of their plot to tell me what
would happen&mdash;what has happened up to this time. Thus far I
was prepared; from now on we must trust to our luck and our
craft. Here and now I think we are safe; those snake-men without
the door dare not leave their post lest true men come here
unexpectedly. But tomorrow they will try something else, you may
be sure. Just what they will do, none can say, not even Ka-nu;
but we must stay at each other's sides, King Kull, until we
conquer or both be dead. Now come with me while I take this
carcass to the hiding-place where I took the other being."</p>

<p><br>
KULL followed the Pict with his grisly burden through the
secret panel and down the dim corridor. Their feet, trained to
the silence of the wilderness, made no noise. Like phantoms they
glided through the ghostly light, Kull wondering that the
corridors should be deserted; at every turn he expected to run
full upon some frightful apparition. Suspicion surged back upon
him; was this Pict leading him into ambush? He fell back a pace
or two behind Brule, his ready sword hovering at the Pict's
unheeding back. Brule should die first if he meant treachery. But
if the Pict was aware of the king's suspicion, he showed no sign.
Stolidly he tramped along, until they came to a room, dusty and
long unused, where moldy tapestries hung heavy. Brule drew aside
some of these and concealed the corpse behind them.</p>

<p>Then they turned to retrace their steps, when suddenly Brule
halted with such abruptness that he was closer to death than he
knew; for Kull's nerves were on edge.</p>

<p>"Something moving in the corridor," hissed the Pict. "Ka-nu
said these ways would be empty, yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew his sword and stole into the corridor, Kull following
warily.</p>

<p>A short way down the corridor a strange, vague glow appeared
that came toward them. Nerves a-leap, they waited, backs to the
corridor wall; for what they knew not, but Kull heard Brule's
breath hiss through his teeth and was reassured as to Brule's
loyalty.</p>

<p>The glow merged into a shadowy form. A shape vaguely like a
man it was, but misty and illusive, like a wisp of fog, that grew
more tangible as it approached, but never fully material A face
looked at them, a pair of luminous great eyes, that seemed to
hold all the tortures of a million centuries. There was no menace
in that face, with its dim, worn features, but only a great
pity&mdash;and that face&mdash;that face&mdash;</p>

<p>"Almighty gods!" breathed Kull, an icy hand at his soul;
"Eallal, king of Valusia, who died a thousand years ago!"</p>

<p>Brule shrank back as far as he could, his narrow eyes widened
in a blaze of pure horror, the sword shaking in his grip,
unnerved for the first time that weird night. Erect and defiant
stood Kull, instinctively holding his useless sword at the ready;
flesh a-crawl, hair a-prickle, yet still a king of kings, as
ready to challenge the powers of the unknown dead as the powers
of the living.</p>

<p>The phantom came straight on, giving them no heed; Kull shrank
back as it passed them, feeling an icy breath like a breeze from
the arctic snow. Straight on went the shape with slow, silent
footsteps, as if the chains of all the ages were upon those vague
feet, vanishing about a bend of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Valka!" muttered the Pict, wiping the cold beads from his
brow; "that was no man! That was a ghost!"</p>

<p>"Aye!" Kull shook his head wonderingly. "Did you not recognize
the face? That was Eallal, who reigned in Valusia a thousand
years ago and who was found hideously murdered in his throne-room&mdash;the room now known as the Accursed Room. Have you not
seen his statue in the Fame Room of Kings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember the tale now. Gods, Kull! that is another
sign of the frightful and foul power of the snake
priests&mdash;that king was slain by snake-people and thus his
soul became their slave, to do their bidding throughout eternity!
For the sages have ever maintained that if a man is slain by a
snake-man his ghost becomes their slave."</p>

<p>A shudder shook Kull's gigantic frame. "Valka! But what a
fate! Hark ye"&mdash;his fingers closed upon Brule's sinewy arm
like steel&mdash;"hark ye! If I am wounded unto death by these
foul monsters, swear that ye will smite your sword through my
breast lest my soul be enslaved."</p>

<p>"I swear," answered Brule, his fierce eyes lighting. "And do
ye the same by me, Kull."</p>

<p>Their strong right hands met in a silent sealing of their
bloody bargain.</p>

<h2><a id="shadow4" name="shadow4"></a>IV. &mdash; MASKS</h2>

<p class="first">KULL sat upon his throne and gazed broodily out
upon the sea of faces turned toward him. A courtier was speaking
in evenly modulated tones, but the king scarcely heard him. Close
by, Tu, chief councilor, stood ready at Kull's command, and each
time the king looked at him, Kull shuddered inwardly. The surface
of court life was as the unrippled surface of the sea between
tide and tide. To the musing king the affairs of the night before
seemed as a dream, until his eyes dropped to the arm of his
throne. A brown, sinewy hand rested there, upon the wrist of
which gleamed a dragon armlet; Brule stood beside his throne and
ever the Pict's fierce secret whisper brought him back from the
realm of unreality in which he moved.</p>

<p>No, that was no dream, that monstrous interlude. As he sat
upon his throne in the Hall of Society and gazed upon the
courtiers, the ladies, the lords, the statesmen, he seemed to see
their faces as things of illusion, things unreal, existent only
as shadows and mockeries of substance. Always he had seen their
faces as masks, but before he had looked on them with
contemptuous tolerance, thinking to see beneath the masks
shallow, puny souls, avaricious, lustful, deceitful; now there
was a grim undertone, a sinister meaning, a vague horror that
lurked beneath the smooth masks. While he exchanged courtesies
with some nobleman or councilor he seemed to see the smiling face
fade like smoke and the frightful jaws of a serpent gaping there.
How many of those he looked upon were horrid, inhuman monsters,
plotting his death, beneath the smooth mesmeric illusion of a
human face?</p>

<p>Valusia&mdash;land of dreams and nightmares&mdash;a kingdom of
the shadows, ruled by phantoms who glided back and forth behind
the painted curtains, mocking the futile king who sat upon the
throne&mdash;himself a shadow.</p>

<p>And like a comrade shadow Brule stood by his side, dark eyes
glittering from immobile face. A real man, Brule! And Kull felt
his friendship for the savage become a thing of reality and
sensed that Brule felt a friendship for him beyond the mere
necessity of statecraft.</p>

<p>And what, mused Kull, were the realities of life? Ambition,
power, pride? The friendship of man, the love of
women&mdash;which Kull had never known&mdash;battle, plunder,
what? Was it the real Kull who sat upon the throne or was it the
real Kull who had scaled the hills of Atlantis, harried the far
isles of the sunset, and laughed upon the green roaring tides of
the Atlantean sea? How could a man be so many different men in a
lifetime? For Kull knew that there were many Kulls and he
wondered which was the real Kull. After all, the priests of the
Serpent went a step further in their magic, for all men wore
masks, and many a different mask with each different man or
woman; and Kull wondered if a serpent did not lurk under every
mask.</p>

<p>So he sat and brooded in strange, mazy thought ways, and the
courtiers came and went and the minor affairs of the day were
completed, until at last the king and Brule sat alone in the Hall
of Society save for the drowsy attendants.</p>

<p>Kull felt a weariness. Neither he nor Brule had slept the
night before, nor had Kull slept the night before that, when in
the gardens of Ka-nu he had had his first hint of the weird
things to be. Last night nothing further had occurred after they
had returned to the study room from the secret corridors, but
they had neither dared nor cared to sleep. Kull, with the
incredible vitality of a wolf, had aforetime gone for days upon
days without sleep, in his wild savage days; but now his mind was
edged from constant thinking and from the nerve-breaking eeriness
of the past night. He needed sleep, but sleep was furthest from
his mind.</p>

<p>And he would not have dared sleep if he had thought of it.
Another thing that had shaken him was the fact that though he and
Brule had kept a close watch to see if, or when, the study-room
guard was changed, yet it was changed without their knowledge;
for the next morning those who stood on guard were able to repeat
the magic words of Brule, but they remembered nothing out of the
ordinary. They thought that they had stood at guard all night, as
usual, and Kull said nothing to the contrary. He believed them
true men, but Brule had advised absolute secrecy, and Kull also
thought it best.</p>

<p>Now Brule leaned over the throne, lowering his voice so not
even a lazy attendant could hear: "They will strike soon, I
think, Kull. A while ago Ka-nu gave me a secret sign. The priests
know that we know of their plot, of course, but they know not,
how much we know. We must be ready for any sort of action. Ka-nu
and the Pictish chiefs will remain within hailing distance now
until this is settled one way or another. Ha, Kull, if it comes
to a pitched battle, the streets and the castles of Valusia will
run red!"</p>

<p>Kull smiled grimly. He would greet any sort of action with a
ferocious joy. This wandering in a labyrinth of illusion and
magic was extremely irksome to his nature. He longed for the leap
and clang of swords, for the joyous freedom of battle.</p>

<p>Then into the Hall of Society came Tu again, and the rest of
the councilors.</p>

<p>"Lord king, the hour of the council is at hand and we stand
ready to escort you to the council room."</p>

<p><br>
KULL rose, and the councilors bent the knee as he passed
through the way opened by them for his passage, rising behind
him, and following. Eyebrows were raised as the Pict strode
defiantly behind the king, but no one dissented. Brule's
challenging gaze swept the smooth faces of the councilors with
the defiance of an intruding savage.</p>

<p>The group passed through the halls and came at last to the
council chamber. The door was closed, as usual, and the
councilors arranged themselves in the order of their rank before
the dais upon which stood the king. Like a bronze statue Brule
took up his stand behind Kull.</p>

<p>Kull swept the room with a swift stare. Surely no chance of
treachery here. Seventeen councilors there were, all known to
him; all of them had espoused his cause when he ascended the
throne.</p>

<p>"Men of Valusia&mdash;" he began in the conventional manner,
then halted, perplexed. The councilors had risen as a man and
were moving toward him. There was no hostility in their looks,
but their actions were strange for a council room. The foremost
was close to him when Brule sprang forward, crouched like a
leopard.</p>

<p>"<i>Ka nama kaa lajerama</i>!" his voice crackled through the
sinister silence of the room and the foremost councilor recoiled,
hand flashing to his robes; and like a spring released, Brule
moved and the man pitched headlong and lay still while his face
faded and became the head of a mighty snake.</p>

<p>"Slay, Kull!" rasped the Pict's voice. "They be all serpent-men!"</p>

<p>The rest was a scarlet maze. Kull saw the familiar faces dim
like fading fog and in their places gaped horrid reptilian
visages as the whole band rushed forward. His mind was dazed but
his giant body faltered not.</p>

<p>The singing of his sword filled the room, and the onrushing
flood broke in a red wave. But they surged forward again,
seemingly willing to fling their lives away in order to drag down
the king. Hideous jaws gaped at him; terrible eyes blazed into
his unblinkingly; a frightful fetid scent pervaded the
atmosphere&mdash;the serpent scent that Kull had known in
southern jungles. Swords and daggers leaped at him and he was
dimly aware that they wounded him. But Kull was in his element;
never before had he faced such grim foes but it mattered little;
they lived, their veins held blood that could be spilt and they
died when his great sword cleft their skulls or drove through
their bodies. Slash, thrust, thrust and swing. Yet had Kull died
there but for the man who crouched at his side, parrying and
thrusting. For the king was clear berserk, fighting in the
terrible Atlantean way, that seeks death to deal death; he made
no effort to avoid thrusts and slashes, standing straight up and
ever plunging forward, no thought in his frenzied mind but to
slay. Not often did Kull forget his fighting craft in his
primitive fury, but now some chain had broken in his soul,
flooding his mind with a red wave of slaughter-lust. He slew a
foe at each blow, but they surged about him, and time and again
Brule turned a thrust that would have slain, as he crouched
beside Kull, parrying and warding with cold skill, slaying not as
Kull slew with long slashes and plunges, but with short overhand
blows and upward thrusts.</p>

<p>Kull laughed, a laugh of insanity. The frightful faces swirled
about him in a scarlet blaze. He felt steel sink into his arm and
dropped his sword in a flashing arc that cleft his foe to the
breast-bone. Then the mists faded and the king saw that he and
Brule stood alone above a sprawl of hideous crimson figures who
lay still upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Valka! what a killing!" said Brule, shaking the blood from
his eyes. "Kull, had these been warriors who knew how to use the
steel, we had died here. These serpent priests know naught of
swordcraft and die easier than any men I ever slew. Yet had there
been a few more, I think the matter had ended otherwise."</p>

<p>Kull nodded. The wild berserker blaze had passed, leaving a
mazed feeling of great weariness. Blood seeped from wounds on
breast, shoulder, arm and leg. Brule, himself bleeding from a
score of flesh wounds, glanced at him in some concern.</p>

<p>"Lord Kull, let us hasten to have your wounds dressed by the
women."</p>

<p>Kull thrust him aside with a drunken sweep of his mighty
arm.</p>

<p>"Nay, we'll see this through ere we cease. Go you, though, and
have your wounds seen to&mdash;I command it."</p>

<p>The Pict laughed grimly. "Your wounds are more than mine, lord
king&mdash;" he began, then stopped as a sudden thought struck
him. "By Valka, Kull, this is not the council room!"</p>

<p>Kull looked about and suddenly other fogs seemed to fade.
"Nay, this is the room where Eallal died a thousand years
ago&mdash;since unused and named 'Accursed.'"</p>

<p>"Then by the gods, they tricked us after all!" exclaimed Brule
in a fury, kicking the corpses at their feet. "They caused us to
walk like fools into their ambush! By their magic they changed
the appearance of all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then there is further deviltry afoot." said Kull, "for if
there be true men in the councils of Valusia they should be in
the real council room now. Come swiftly."</p>

<p>And leaving the room with its ghastly keepers they hastened
through halls that seemed deserted until they came to the real
council room. Then Kull halted with a ghastly shudder. <i>From
the council room sounded a voice speaking, and the voice was
his</i>!</p>

<p>With a hand that shook he parted the tapestries and gazed into
the room. There sat the councilors, counterparts of the men he
and Brule had just slain, and upon the dais stood Kull, king of
Valusia.</p>

<p>He stepped back, his mind reeling.</p>

<p>"This is insanity!" he whispered. "Am I Kull? Do I stand here
or is that Kull yonder in very truth, and am I but a shadow, a
figment of thought?"</p>

<p>Brule's hand clutching his shoulder, shaking him fiercely,
brought him to his senses.</p>

<p>"Valka's name, be not a fool! Can you yet be astounded after
all we have seen? See you not that those are true men bewitched
by a snake-man who has taken your form, as those others took
their forms? By now you should have been slain, and yon monster
reigning in your stead, unknown by those who bowed to you. Leap
and slay swiftly or else we are undone. The Red Slayers, true
men, stand close on each hand and none but you can reach and slay
him. Be swift!"</p>

<p>Kull shook off the onrushing dizziness, flung back his head in
the old, defiant gesture. He took a long, deep breath as does a
strong swimmer before diving into the sea; then, sweeping back
the tapestries, made the dais in a single lion-like bound. Brule
had spoken truly. There stood men of the Red Slayers, guardsmen
trained to move quick as the striking leopard; any but Kull had
died ere he could reach the usurper. But the sight of Kull,
identical with the man upon the dais, held them in their tracks,
their minds stunned for an instant, and that was long enough. He
upon the dais snatched for his sword, but even as his fingers
closed upon the hilt, Kull's sword stood out behind his shoulders
and the thing that men had thought the king pitched forward from
the dais to lie silent upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Hold!" Kull's lifted hand and kingly voice stopped the rush
that had started, and while they stood astounded he pointed to
the thing which lay before them&mdash;whose face was fading into
that of a snake. They recoiled, and from one door came Brule and
from another came Ka-nu.</p>

<p>These grasped the king's bloody hand and Ka-nu spoke: "Men of
Valusia, you have seen with your own eyes. This is the true Kull,
the mightiest king to whom Valusia has ever bowed. The power of
the Serpent is broken and ye be all true men. King Kull, have you
commands?"</p>

<p>"Lift that carrion," said Kull, and men of the guard took up
the thing.</p>

<p>"Now follow me," said the king, and he made his way to the
Accursed Room. Brule, with a look of concern, offered the support
of his arm but Kull shook him off.</p>

<p>The distance seemed endless to the bleeding king, but at last
he stood at the door and laughed fiercely and grimly when he
heard the horrified ejaculations of the councilors.</p>

<p>At his orders the guardsmen flung the corpse they carried
beside the others, and motioning all from the room Kull stepped
out last and closed the door.</p>

<p>A wave of dizziness left him shaken. The faces turned to him,
pallid and wonderingly, swirled and mingled in a ghostly fog. He
felt the blood from his wound trickling down his limbs and he
knew that what he was to do, he must do quickly or not at
all.</p>

<p>His sword rasped from its sheath.</p>

<p>"Brule, are you there?"</p>

<p>"Aye!" Brule's face looked at him through the mist, close to
his shoulder, but Brule's voice sounded leagues and eons
away.</p>

<p>"Remember our vow, Brule. And now, bid them stand back."</p>

<p>His left arm cleared a space as he flung up his sword. Then
with all his waning power he drove it through the door into the
jamb, driving the great sword to the hilt and sealing the room
forever.</p>

<p>Legs braced wide, he swayed drunkenly, facing the horrified
councilors. "Let this room be doubly accursed. And let those
rotting skeletons lie there forever as a sign of the dying might
of the Serpent. Here I swear that I shall hunt the serpent-men
from land to land, from sea to sea, giving no rest until all be
slain, that good triumph and the power of Hell be broken. This
thing I
swear&mdash;I&mdash;Kull&mdash;king&mdash;of&mdash;Valusia."</p>

<p>His knees buckled as the faces swayed and swirled. The
councilors leaped forward, but ere they could reach him, Kull
slumped to the floor, and lay still, face upward.</p>

<p>The councilors surged about the fallen king, chattering and
shrieking. Ka-nu beat them back with his clenched fists, cursing
savagely.</p>

<p>"Back, you fools! Would you stifle the little life that is yet
in him? How, Brule, is he dead or will he live?"&mdash;to the
warrior who bent above the prostrate Kull.</p>

<p>"Dead?" sneered Brule irritably. "Such a man as this is not so
easily killed. Lack of sleep and loss of blood have weakened
him&mdash;by Valka, he has a score of deep wounds, but none of
them mortal. Yet have those gibbering fools bring the court women
here at once."</p>

<p>Brule's eyes lighted with a fierce, proud light.</p>

<p>"Valka, Ka-nu, but here is such a man as I knew not existed in
these degenerate days. He will be in the saddle in a few scant
days and then may the serpent-men of the world beware of Kull of
Valusia. Valka! but that will be a rare hunt! Ah, I see long
years of prosperity for the world with such a king upon the
throne of Valusia."</p>
