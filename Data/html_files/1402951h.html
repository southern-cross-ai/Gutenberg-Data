  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE MAGIC CASKET</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was in the near neighbourhood of King's Road, Chelsea,
  that chance, aided by Thorndyke's sharp and observant eyes, introduced us to
  the dramatic story of the Magic Casket. Not that there was anything
  strikingly dramatic in the opening phase of the affair, nor even in the story
  of the casket itself. It was Thorndyke who added the dramatic touch, and most
  of the magic, too; and I record the affair principally as an illustration of
  his extraordinary capacity for producing odd items of out-of-the-way
  knowledge and instantly applying them in the most unexpected manner.</p>

  <p>Eight o'clock had struck on a misty November night when we turned out of
  the main road, and, leaving behind the glare of the shop windows, plunged
  into the maze of dark and narrow streets to the north. The abrupt change
  impressed us both, and Thorndyke proceeded to moralise on it in his pleasant,
  reflective fashion.</p>

  <p>"London is an inexhaustible place," he mused. "Its variety is infinite. A
  minute ago we walked in a glare of light, jostled by a multitude. And now
  look at this little street. It is as dim as a tunnel, and we have got it
  absolutely to ourselves. Anything might happen in a place like this."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped. We were, at the moment, passing a small church or
  chapel, the west door of which was enclosed in an open porch; and as my
  observant friend stepped into the latter and stooped, I perceived in the deep
  shadow against the wall, the object which had evidently caught his eye.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked, following him in.</p>

  <p>"It is a handbag," he replied; "and the question is, what is it doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>He tried the church door, which was obviously locked, and coming out,
  looked at the windows.</p>

  <p>"There are no lights in the church." said he; "the place is locked up, and
  there is nobody in sight. Apparently the bag is derelict. Shall we have a
  look at it?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for an answer, he picked it up and brought it out into the
  mitigated darkness of the street, where we proceeded to inspect it. But at
  the first glance it told its own tale; for it had evidently been locked, and
  it bore unmistakable traces of having been forced open.</p>

  <p>"It isn't empty," said Thorndyke. "I think we had better see what is in
  it. Just catch hold while I get a light."</p>

  <p>He handed me the bag while he felt in his pocket for the tiny electric
  lamp which he made a habit of carrying, and an excellent habit it is. I held
  the mouth of the bag open while he illuminated the interior, which we then
  saw to be occupied by several objects neatly wrapped in brown paper. One of
  these Thorndyke lifted out, and untying the string and removing the paper,
  displayed a Chinese stoneware jar. Attached to it was a label, bearing the
  stamp of the Victoria and Albert Museum, on which was written:</p>
 <br>

  <p class="sign">"Miss MABEL BONNET,<br>
  168 Willow Walk,<br>
  Fulham Road, W."</p>
  <br>

  <p>"That tells us all that we want to know," said Thorndyke, re-wrapping the
  jar and tenderly replacing it in the bag. "We can't do wrong in delivering
  the things to their owner, especially as the bag itself is evidently her
  property, too," and he pointed to the gilt initials, "M. B.," stamped on the
  morocco.</p>

  <p>It took us but a few minutes to reach the Fulham Road, but we then had to
  walk nearly a mile along that thoroughfare before we arrived at Willow
  Walk&mdash;to which an obliging shopkeeper had directed us&mdash;and,
  naturally, No. 168 was at the farther end.</p>

  <p>As we turned into the quiet street we almost collided with two men, who
  were walking at a rapid pace, but both looking back over their shoulders. I
  noticed that they were both Japanese&mdash;well-dressed, gentlemanly-looking
  men&mdash;but I gave them little attention, being interested, rather, in what
  they were looking at. This was a taxicab which was dimly visible by the light
  of a street lamp at the farther end of the "Walk," and from which four
  persons had just alighted. Two of these had hurried ahead to knock at a door,
  while the other two walked very slowly across the pavement and up the steps
  to the threshold. Almost immediately the door was opened; two of the shadowy
  figures entered, and the other two returned slowly to the cab and as we came
  nearer, I could see that these latter were policemen in uniform. I had just
  time to note this fact when they both got into the cab and were forthwith
  spirited away.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a street accident of some kind," I remarked; and then, as I
  glanced at the number of the house we were passing, I added: "Now, I wonder
  if that house happens to be&mdash;yes, by Jove! it is. It is 168! Things have
  been happening, and this bag of ours is one of the dramatis personae."</p>

  <p>The response to our knock was by no means prompt. I was, in fact, in the
  act of raising my hand to the knocker to repeat the summons when the door
  opened and revealed an elderly servant-maid, who regarded us inquiringly,
  and, as I thought, with something approaching alarm.</p>

  <p>"Does Miss Mabel Bonney live here?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," was the reply; "but I am afraid you can't see her just now,
  unless it is something urgent. She is rather upset, and particularly engaged
  at present."</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion whatever to disturb her," said Thorndyke. "We have
  merely called to restore this bag, which seemed to have been lost;" and with
  this he held it out towards her. She grasped it eagerly with a cry of
  surprise, and as the mouth fell open, she peered into it.</p>

  <p>"Why," she exclaimed, "they don't seem to have taken anything, after all.
  Where did you find it, sir?"</p>

  <p>"In the porch of a church in Spelton Street," Thorndyke replied, and was
  turning away when the servant said earnestly: "Would you kindly give me your
  name and address, sir? Miss Bonney will wish to write and thank you."</p>

  <p>"There is really no need," said he; but she interrupted anxiously: "If you
  would be so kind, sir. Miss Bonney will be so vexed if she is unable to thank
  you; and besides, she may want to ask you some questions about it."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Thorndyke (who was restrained only by good manners
  from asking one or two questions, himself). He produced his card-case, and
  having handed one of his cards to the maid, wished her "good-evening" and
  retired.</p>

  <p>"That bag had evidently been pinched," I remarked, as we walked back
  towards the Fulham Road.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," he agreed, and was about to enlarge on the matter when our
  attention was attracted to a taxi, which was approaching from the direction
  of the main road. A man's head was thrust out of the window, and as the
  vehicle passed a street lamp, I observed that the head appertained to an
  elderly gentleman with very white hair and a very fresh face.</p>

  <p>"Did you see who that was?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"It looked like old Brodribb," I replied.</p>

  <p>"It did; very much. I wonder where he is off to."</p>

  <p>He turned and followed, with a speculative eye, the receding taxi, which
  presently swept alongside the kerb and stopped, apparently opposite the house
  from where we had just come. As the vehicle came to rest, the door flew open
  and the passenger shot out like an elderly, but agile, Jack-in-the-box, and
  bounced up the steps.</p>

  <p>"That is Brodribb's knock, sure enough," said I, as the old-fashioned
  flourish reverberated up the quiet street. "I have heard it too often on our
  own knocker to mistake it. But we had better not let him see us watching
  him."</p>

  <p>As we went once more on our way, I took a sly glance, now and again, at my
  friend, noting with a certain malicious enjoyment his profoundly cogitative
  air. I knew quite well what was happening in his mind for his mind reacted to
  observed facts in an invariable manner. And here was a group of related
  facts: the bag, stolen, but deposited intact; the museum label; the injured
  or sick person&mdash;probably Miss Bonney, herself&mdash;brought home under
  police escort; and the arrival, post-haste, of the old lawyer; a significant
  group of facts. And there was Thorndyke, under my amused and attentive
  observation, fitting them together in various combinations to see what
  general conclusion emerged. Apparently my own mental state was equally clear
  to him, for he remarked, presently, as if response to an unspoken comment:
  "Well, I expect we shall know all about it before many days have passed if
  Brodribb sees my card, as he most probably will. Here comes an omnibus that
  will suit us. Shall we hop on?"</p>

  <p>He stood at the kerb and raised his stick; and as the accommodation on the
  omnibus was such that our seats were separated, there was no opportunity to
  pursue the subject further, even if there had been anything to discuss.</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke's prediction was justified sooner than I had expected. For
  we had not long finished our supper, and had not yet closed the "oak," when
  there was heard a mighty flourish on the knocker of our inner door.</p>

  <p>"Brodribb, by Jingo!" I exclaimed, and hurried across the room to let him
  in.</p>

  <p>"No, Jervis," he said as I invited him to enter, "I am not coming in.
  Don't want to disturb you at this time of night. I've just called to make an
  appointment for to-morrow with a client."</p>

  <p>"Is the client's name Bonney?" I asked.</p>

  <p>He started and gazed at me in astonishment. "Gad, Jervis!" he exclaimed,
  "you are getting as bad as Thorndyke. How the deuce did you know that she was
  my client?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind how I know. It is our business to know everything in these
  chambers. But if your appointment concerns Miss Mabel Bonney, for the Lord's
  sake come in and give Thorndyke a chance of a night's rest. At present, he is
  on broken bottles, as Mr. Bumble would express it."</p>

  <p>On this persuasion, Mr. Brodribb entered, nothing loath&mdash;very much
  the reverse, in fact&mdash;and having bestowed a jovial greeting on
  Thorndyke, glanced approvingly round the room.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said he, "you look very cosy. If you are really sure I am
  not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I cut him short by propelling him gently towards the fire, beside which I
  deposited him in an easy chair, while Thorndyke pressed the electric bell
  which rang up in the laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, spreading himself out comfortably before the fire
  like a handsome old Tom-cat, "if you are going to let me give you a few
  particulars&mdash;but perhaps you would rather that I should not talk
  shop?"</p>

  <p>"Now you know perfectly well, Brodribb," said Thorndyke, "that 'shop' is
  the breath of life to us all. Let us have those particulars."</p>

  <p>Brodribb sighed contentedly and placed his toes on the fender (and at this
  moment the door opened softly and Polton looked into the room. He took a
  single, understanding glance at our visitor, and withdrew, shutting the door
  without a sound).</p>

  <p>"I am glad," pursued Brodribb, "to have this opportunity of a preliminary
  chat, because there are certain things that one can say better when the
  client is not present; and I am deeply interested in Bonney's affairs. The
  crisis in those affairs which has brought me here is of quite recent
  date&mdash;in fact, it dates from this evening. But I know your partiality
  for having events related in their proper sequence, so I will leave today's
  happenings for the moment and tell you the story&mdash;the whole of which is
  material to the case&mdash;from the beginning."</p>

  <p>Here there was a slight interruption, due to Polton's noiseless entry with
  a tray on which was a decanter, a biscuit box, and three port glasses. This
  he deposited, on a small table, which he placed within convenient reach of
  our guest. Then, with a glance of altruistic satisfaction at our old friend,
  he stole out like a benevolent ghost.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Brodribb, beaming on the decanter, "this is really
  too bad. You ought not to indulge me in this way."</p>

  <p>"My dear Brodribb," replied Thorndyke, "you are a benefactor to us. You
  give us a pretext for taking a glass of port. We can't drink alone, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"I should, if I had a cellar like yours," chuckled Brodribb, sniffing
  ecstatically at his glass. He took a sip, with his eyes closed, savoured it
  solemnly, shook his head, and set the glass down on the table.</p>

  <p>"To return to our case," he resumed; "Miss Bonney is the daughter of a
  solicitor, Harold Bonney&mdash;you may remember him. He had offices in
  Bedford Row; and there, one morning, a client came to him and asked him to
  take care of some property while he, the said client, ran over to Paris,
  where he had some urgent business. The property in question was a collection
  of pearls of most unusual size and value, forming a great necklace, which had
  been unstrung for the sake of portability. It is not clear where they came
  from, but as the transaction occurred soon after the Russian Revolution, we
  may make a guess. At any rate, there they were, packed loosely in a leather
  bag, the string of which was sealed with the owner's seal.</p>

  <p>"Bonney seems to have been rather casual about the affair. He gave the
  client a receipt for the bag, stating the nature of the contents, which he
  had not seen, and deposited it, in the client's presence, in the safe in his
  private office. Perhaps he intended to take it to the bank or transfer it to
  his strong-room, but it is evident that he did neither; for his managing
  clerk, who kept the second key of the strong-room&mdash;without which the
  room could not be opened&mdash;knew nothing of the transaction. When he went
  home at about seven o'clock, he left Bonney hard at work in his office, and
  there is no doubt that the pearls were still in the safe.</p>

  <p>"That night, at about a quarter to nine, it happened that a couple of
  C.I.D. officers were walking up Bedford Row when they saw three men come out
  of one of the houses. Two of them turned up towards Theobald's Road, but the
  third came south, towards them. As he passed them, they both recognised him
  as a Japanese named Uyenishi, who was believed to be a member of a
  cosmopolitan gang and whom the police were keeping under observation.
  Naturally, their suspicions were aroused. The first two men had hurried round
  the corner and were out of sight; and when they turned to look after
  Uyenishi, he had mended his pace considerably and was looking back at them.
  Thereupon one of the officers, named Barker, decided to follow the Jap, while
  the other, Holt, reconnoitred the premises.</p>

  <p>"Now, as soon as Barker turned, the Japanese broke into a run. It was just
  such a night as this dark and, slightly foggy. In order to keep his man in
  sight, he had to run, too; and he found that he had a sprinter to deal with.
  From the bottom of Bedford Row, Uyenishi darted across and shot down Hand
  Court like a lamp-lighter. Barker followed, but at the Holborn end his man
  was nowhere to be seen. However, he presently learned from a man at a shop
  door that the fugitive had run past and turned up Brownlow Street, so off he
  went again in pursuit. But when he got to the top of the street, back in
  Bedford Row, he was done. There was no sign of the man, and no one about from
  whom he could make inquiries. All he could do was to cross the road and walk
  up Bedford Row to see if Holt had made any discoveries.</p>

  <p>"As he was trying to identify the house, his colleague came out on to the
  doorstep and beckoned him in and this was the story that he told. He had
  recognised the house by the big lamp-standard; and as the place was all dark,
  he had gone into the entry and tried the office door. Finding it unlocked, he
  had entered the clerks' office, lit the gas, and tried the door of the
  private office, but found it locked. He knocked at it, but getting no answer,
  had a good look round the clerk's office; and there, presently, on the floor
  in a dark corner, he found a key. This he tried in the door of the private
  office, and finding that it fitted, turned it and opened the door. As he did
  so, the light from the outer office fell on the body of a man lying on the
  floor just inside.</p>

  <p>"A moment's inspection showed that the man had been murdered&mdash;first
  knocked on the head and then finished with a knife. Examination of the
  pockets showed that the dead man was Harold Bonney, and also that no robbery
  from the person seemed to have been committed. Nor was there any sign of any
  other kind of robbery. Nothing seemed to have been disturbed, and the safe
  had not been broken into, though that was not very conclusive, as the safe
  key was in the dead man's pocket. However, a murder had been committed, and
  obviously Uyenishi was either the murderer or an accessory; so Holt had, at
  once, rung up Scotland Yard on the office telephone, giving all the
  particulars.</p>

  <p>"I may say at once that Uyenishi disappeared completely and at once. He
  never went to his lodgings at Limehouse, for the police were there before he
  could have arrived. A lively hue and cry was kept up. Photographs of the
  wanted man were posted outside every police-station, and a watch was set at
  all the ports. But he was never found. He must have got away at once on some
  outward-bound tramp from the Thames. And there we will leave him for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"At first it was thought that nothing had been stolen, since the managing
  clerk could not discover that anything was missing. But a few days later the
  client returned from Paris, and presenting his receipt, asked for his pearls.
  But the pearls had vanished. Clearly they had been the object of the crime.
  The robbers must have known about them and traced them to the office. Of
  course the safe had been opened with its own key, which was then replaced in
  the dead man's pocket.</p>

  <p>"Now, I was poor Bonney's executor, and in that capacity I denied his
  liability in respect of the pearls on the ground that he was a gratuitous
  bailee&mdash;there being no evidence that any consideration had been
  demanded&mdash;and that being murdered cannot be construed as negligence. But
  Miss Mabel, who was practically the sole legatee, insisted on accepting
  liability. She said that the pearls could have been secured in the bank or
  the strong-room, and that she was morally, if not legally, liable for their
  loss; and she insisted on handing to the owner the full amount at which he
  valued them. It was a wildly foolish proceeding, for he would certainly have
  accepted half the sum. But still I take my hat off to a person&mdash;man or
  woman&mdash;who can accept poverty in preference to a broken covenant;" and
  here Brodribb, being in fact that sort of person himself, had to be consoled
  with a replenished glass.</p>

  <p>"And mind you," he resumed, "when I speak of poverty, I wish to be taken
  literally. The estimated value of those pearls was fifty thousand
  pounds&mdash;if you can imagine anyone out of Bedlam giving such a sum for a
  parcel of trash like that; and when poor Mabel Bonney had paid it, she was
  left with the prospect of having to spread her butter mighty thin for the
  rest of her life. As a matter of fact, she has had to sell one after another
  of her little treasures to pay just her current expenses, and I'm hanged if I
  can see how she is going to carry on when she has sold the last of them. But
  there, I mustn't take up your time with her private troubles. Let us return
  to our muttons.</p>

  <p>"First, as to the pearls They were never traced, and it seems probable
  that they were never disposed of. For, you see, pearls are different from any
  other kind of gems. You can cut up a big diamond, but you can't cut up a big
  pearl. And the great value of this necklace was due not only to the size, the
  perfect shape and 'orient' of the separate pearls, but to the fact that the
  whole set was perfectly matched. To break up the necklace was to destroy a
  good part of its value.</p>

  <p>"And now as to our friend Uyenishi. He disappeared, as I have said; but he
  reappeared at Los Angeles, in custody of the police, charged with robbery and
  murder. He was taken red-handed and was duly convicted and sentenced to
  death; but for some reason&mdash;or more probably, for no reason, as we
  should think&mdash;the sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. Under
  these circumstances, the English police naturally took no action, especially
  as they really had no evidence against him.</p>

  <p>"Now Uyenishi was, by trade, a metal-worker; a maker of those pretty
  trifles that are so dear to the artistic Japanese, and when he was in prison
  he was allowed to set up a little workshop and practise his trade on a small
  scale. Among other things that he made was a little casket in the form of a
  seated figure, which he said he wanted to give to his brother as a keepsake.
  I don't know whether any permission was granted for him to make this gift,
  but that is of no consequence; for Uyenishi got influenza and was carried off
  in a few days by pneumonia; and the prison authorities learned that his
  brother had been killed, a week or two previously, in a shooting affair at
  San Francisco. So the casket remained on their hands.</p>

  <p>"About this time, Miss Bonney was invited to accompany an American lady on
  a visit to California, and accepted gratefully. While she was there she paid
  a visit to the prison to inquire whether Uyenishi had ever made any kind of
  statement concerning the missing pearls. Here she heard of Uyenishi's recent
  death; and the governor of the prison, as he could not give her any
  information, handed over to her the casket as a sort of memento. This
  transaction came to the knowledge of the press, and&mdash;well, you know what
  the Californian press is like. There were 'some comments,' as they would say,
  and quite an assortment of Japanese, of shady antecedents, applied to the
  prison to have the casket 'restored' to them as Uyenishi's heirs. Then Miss
  Bonney's rooms at the hotel were raided by burglars&mdash;but the casket was
  in the hotel strong-room&mdash;and Miss Bonney and her hostess were shadowed
  by various undesirables in such a disturbing fashion that the two ladies
  became alarmed and secretly made their way to New York. But there another
  burglary occurred, with the same unsuccessful result, and the shadowing began
  again. Finally, Miss Bonney, feeling that her presence was a danger to her
  friend, decided to return to England, and managed to get on board the ship
  without letting her departure be known in advance.</p>

  <p>"But even in England she has not been left in peace. She has had an
  uncomfortable feeling of being watched and attended, and has seemed to be
  constantly meeting Japanese men in the streets, especially in the vicinity of
  her house. Of course, all the fuss is about this infernal casket; and when
  she told me what was happening, I promptly popped the thing in my pocket and
  took it, to my office, where I stowed it in the strong-room. And there, of
  course, it ought to have remained. but it didn't. One day Miss Bonney told me
  that she was sending some small things to a loan exhibition of oriental works
  of art at the South Kensington Museum, and she wished to include the casket.
  I urged her strongly to do nothing of the kind, but she persisted; and the
  end of it was that we went to the museum together, with her pottery and stuff
  in a handbag and the casket in my pocket.</p>

  <p>"It was a most imprudent thing to do, for there the beastly casket was,
  for several months, exposed in a glass case for anyone to see, with her name
  on the label; and what was worse, full particulars of the origin of the
  thing. However, nothing happened while it was there&mdash;the museum is not
  an easy place to steal from&mdash;and all went well until it was time to
  remove the things after the close of the exhibition. Now, to-day was the
  appointed day, and, as on the previous occasion, she and I went to the museum
  together. But the unfortunate thing is that we didn't come away together. Her
  other exhibits were all pottery, and these were dealt with first, so that she
  had her handbag packed and was ready to go before they had begun on the metal
  work cases. As we were not going the same way, it didn't seem necessary for
  her to wait; so she went off with her bag and I stayed behind until the
  casket was released, when I put it in my pocket and went home, where I locked
  the thing up again in the strong-room.</p>

  <p>"It was about seven when I got home. A little after eight I heard the
  telephone ring down in the office, and down I went, cursing the untimely
  ringer, who turned out to be a policeman at St. George's Hospital. He said he
  had found Miss Bonney lying unconscious in the street and had taken her to
  the hospital, where she had been detained for a while, but she was now
  recovered and he was taking her home. She would like me, if possible, to go
  and see her at once. Well, of course, I set off forthwith and got to her
  house a few minutes after her arrival, and just after you had left.</p>

  <p>"She was a good deal upset, so I didn't worry her with many questions, but
  she gave me a short account of her misadventure, which amounted to this: She
  had started to walk home from the museum along the Brompton Road, and she was
  passing down a quiet street between that and Fulham Road when she heard soft
  footsteps behind her. The next moment, a scarf or shawl was thrown over her
  head and drawn tightly round her neck. At the same moment, the bag was
  snatched from her hand. That is all that she remembers, for she was so
  terrified that she fainted, and knew no more until she found herself in a cab
  with two policemen who were taking her to the hospital.</p>

  <p>"Now it is obvious that her assailants were in search of that damned
  casket, for the bag had been broken open and searched, but nothing taken or
  damaged; which suggests the Japanese again, for a British thief would have
  smashed the crockery. I found your card there, and I put it to Miss Bonney
  that we had better ask you to help us&mdash;I told her all about
  you&mdash;and she agreed emphatically. So that is why I am here, drinking
  your port and robbing you of your night's rest."</p>

  <p>"And what do you want me to do?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you think best," was the cheerful reply. "In the first place,
  this nuisance must be put a stop to&mdash;this shadowing and hanging about.
  But apart from that, you must see that there is something queer about this
  accursed casket. The beastly thing is of no intrinsic value. The museum man
  turned up his nose at it. But it evidently has some extrinsic value, and no
  small value either. If it is good enough for these devils to follow it all
  the way from the States, as they seem to have done, it is good enough for us
  to try to find out what its value is. That is where you come in. I propose to
  bring Miss Bonney to see you to-morrow, and I will bring the infernal casket,
  too. Then you will ask her a few questions, take a look at the
  casket&mdash;through the microscope, if necessary&mdash;and tell us all about
  it in your usual necromantic way."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed as he refilled our friend's glass. "If faith will move
  mountains, Brodribb," said he, "you ought to have been a civil engineer. But
  it is certainly a rather intriguing problem."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the old solicitor; "then it's all right. I've known you a
  good many years, but I've never known you to be stumped; and you are not
  going to be stumped now. What time shall I bring her? Afternoon or evening
  would suit her best."</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied Thorndyke; "bring her to tea&mdash;say, five o'clock.
  How will that do?"</p>

  <p>"Excellently; and here's good luck to the adventure." He drained his
  glass, and the decanter being now empty, he rose, shook our hands warmly, and
  took his departure in high spirits.</p>

  <p>It was with a very lively interest that I looked forward to the
  prospective visit. Like Thorndyke, I found the case rather intriguing. For it
  was quite clear, as our shrewd old friend had said, that there was something
  more than met the eye in the matter of this casket.</p>

  <p>Hence, on the following afternoon, when, on the stroke of five, footsteps
  became audible on our stairs, I awaited the arrival of our new client with
  keen curiosity, both as to herself and her mysterious property.</p>

  <p>To tell the truth, the lady was better worth looking at than the casket.
  At the first glance, I was strongly prepossessed in her favour, and so, I
  think, was Thorndyke. Not that she was a beauty, though comely enough. But
  she was an example of a type that seems to be growing rarer; quiet, gentle,
  soft-spoken, and a lady to her finger-tips; a little sad-faced and care worn,
  with a streak or two of white in her prettily-disposed black hair, though she
  could not have been much over thirty-five. Altogether a very gracious and
  winning personality.</p>

  <p>When we had been presented to her by Brodribb&mdash;who treated her as if
  she had been a royal personage&mdash;and had enthroned her in the most
  comfortable easy-chair, we inquired as to her health, and were duly thanked
  for the salvage of the bag. Then Polton brought in the tray, with an air that
  seemed to demand an escort of choristers; the tea was poured out, and the
  informal proceedings began.</p>

  <p>She had not, however, much to tell; for she had not seen her assailants,
  and the essential facts of the case had been fully presented in Brodribb's
  excellent summary. After a very few questions, therefore, we came to the next
  stage; which was introduced by Brodribb's taking from his pocket a small
  parcel which he proceeded to open.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, "that is the fons et origo mali. Not much to look at, I
  think you will agree." He set the object down on the table and glared at it
  malevolently, while Thorndyke and I regarded it with a more impersonal
  interest. It was not much to look at. Just an ordinary Japanese casket in the
  form of a squat, shapeless figure with a silly little grinning face, of which
  the head and shoulders opened on a hinge; a pleasant enough object, with its
  quiet, warm colouring, but certainly not a masterpiece of art.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked it up and turned it over slowly for preliminary
  inspection; then he went on to examine it detail by detail, watched closely,
  in his turn, by Brodribb and me. Slowly and methodically, his
  eye&mdash;fortified by a watchmaker's eyeglass&mdash;travelled over every
  part of the exterior. Then he opened it, and I having examined the inside of
  the lid, scrutinised the bottom from within, long and attentively. Finally,
  he turned the casket upside down and examined the bottom from without, giving
  to it the longest and most rigorous inspection of all&mdash;which puzzled me
  somewhat, for the bottom was absolutely plain At length, he passed the casket
  and the eyeglass to me without comment.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, "what is the verdict?"</p>

  <p>"It is of no value as a work of art," replied Thorndyke. "The body and lid
  are just castings of common white metal&mdash;an antimony alloy, I should
  say. The bronze colour is lacquer."</p>

  <p>"So the museum man remarked," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Thorndyke, "there is one very odd thing about it. The
  only piece of fine metal in it is in the part which matters least. The bottom
  is a separate plate of the alloy known to the Japanese as Shakudo&mdash;an
  alloy of copper and gold."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Brodribb, "the museum man noted that, too, and couldn't make
  out why it had been put there."</p>

  <p>"Then," Thorndyke continued, "there is another anomalous feature; the
  inside of the bottom is covered with elaborate decoration&mdash;just the
  place where decoration is most inappropriate, since it would be covered up by
  the contents of the casket. And, again, this decoration is etched; not
  engraved or chased. But etching is a very unusual process for this purpose,
  if it is ever used at all by Japanese metal-workers. My impression is that it
  is not; for it is most unsuitable for decorative purposes. That is all that I
  observe, so far."</p>

  <p>"And what do you infer from your observations?" Brodribb asked.</p>

  <p>"I should like to think the matter over," was the reply. "There is an
  obvious anomaly, which must have some significance. But I won't embark on
  speculative opinions at this stage. I should like, however, to take one or
  two photographs of the casket, for reference; but that will occupy some time.
  You will hardly want to wait so long."</p>

  <p>"No," said Brodribb. "But Miss Bonney is coming with me to my office to go
  over some documents and discuss a little business. When we have finished, I
  will come back and fetch the confounded thing."</p>

  <p>"There is no need for that," replied Thorndyke. "As soon as I have done
  what is necessary, I will bring it up to your place."</p>

  <p>To this arrangement Brodribb agreed readily, and he and his client
  prepared to depart. I rose, too, and as I happened to have a call to make in
  Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, I asked permission to walk with them.</p>

  <p>As we came out into King's Bench Walk I noticed a smallish,
  gentlemanly-looking man who had just passed our entry and now turned in at
  the one next door; and by the light of the lamp in the entry he looked to me
  like a Japanese. I thought Miss Bonney had observed him, too, but she made no
  remark, and neither did I. But, passing up Inner Temple Lane, we nearly
  overtook two other men, who&mdash;though I got but a back view of them and
  the light was feeble enough&mdash;aroused my suspicions by their neat, small
  figures. As we approached, they quickened their pace, and one of them looked
  back over his shoulder; and then my suspicions were confirmed, for it was an
  unmistakable Japanese face that looked round at us. Miss Bonney saw that I
  had observed the men, for she remarked, as they turned sharply at the
  Cloisters and entered Pump Court: "You see, I am still haunted by
  Japanese."</p>

  <p>"I noticed them," said Brodribb. "They are probably law students. But we
  may as well be cornpanionable;" and with this, he, too, headed for Pump
  Court.</p>

  <p>We followed our oriental friends across the Lane into Fountain Court, and
  through that and Devereux Court out to Temple Bar, where we parted from them;
  they turning westward and we crossing to Bell Yard, up which we walked,
  entering New Square by the Carey Street gate. At Brodribb's doorway we halted
  and looked back, but no one was in sight. I accordingly went my way,
  promising to return anon to hear Thorndyke's report, and the lawyer and his
  client disappeared through the portal.</p>

  <p>My business occupied me longer than I had expected, but nevertheless, when
  I arrived at Brodribb's premises&mdash;where he lived in chambers over his
  office&mdash;Thorndyke had not yet made his appearance. A quarter of an hour
  later, however, we heard his brisk step on the stairs, and as Brodribb threw
  the door open, he entered and produced the casket from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Brodribb, taking it from him and locking it, for the time
  being, in a drawer, "has the oracle Spoken; and if so, what did he say?"</p>

  <p>"Oracles," replied Thorndyke, "have a way of being more concise than
  explicit. Before I attempt to interpret the message, I should like to view
  the scene of the escape; to see if there was any intelligible reason why this
  man Uyenishi should have returned up Brownlow Street into what must have been
  the danger zone. I think that is a material question."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Brodribb, with evident eagerness, "let us all walk up and
  have a look at the confounded place. It is quite close by."</p>

  <p>We all agreed instantly, two of us, at least, being on the tip-toe of
  expectation. For Thorndyke, who habitually understated his results, had
  virtually admitted that the casket had told him something; and as we walked
  up the Square to the gate in Lincoln's Inn Fields, I watched him furtively,
  trying to gather from his impassive face a hint as to what the something
  amounted to, and wondering how the movements of the fugitive bore on the
  solution of the mystery. Brodribb was similarly occupied, and as we crossed
  from Great Turnstile and took our way up Brownlow Street, I could see that
  his excitement was approaching bursting-point.</p>

  <p>At the top of the street Thorndyke paused and looked up and down the
  rather dismal thoroughfare which forms a continuation of Bedford Row and
  bears its name. Then he crossed to the paved island surrounding the pump
  which stands in the middle of the road, and from thence surveyed the
  entrances to Brownlow Street and Hand Court; and then he turned and looked
  thoughtfully at the pump.</p>

  <p>"A quaint old survivor, this," he remarked, tapping the iron shell with
  his knuckles. "There is a similar one, you may remember, in Queen Square, and
  another at Aldgate. But that is still in use."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb assented, almost dancing with im patience and inwardly
  damning the pump, as I could see, "I've noticed it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Thorndyke proceeded, in a reflective tone, "they had to
  remove the handle. But it was rather a pity."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was," growled Brodribb, whose complexion was rapidly
  developing affinities to that of a pickled cabbage, "but what the
  d&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here he broke off short and glared silently at Thorndyke, who had raised
  his arm and squeezed his hand into the opening once occupied by the handle.
  He groped in the interior with an expression of placid interest, and
  presently reported: "The barrel is still there, and so, apparently, is the
  plunger"&mdash;(Here I heard Brodribb mutter huskily, "Damn the barrel and
  the plunger too!")&mdash;"but my hand is rather large for the exploration.
  Would you, Miss Bonney, mind slipping your hand in and telling me if I am
  right?"</p>

  <p>We all gazed at Thorndyke in dismay, but in a moment Miss Bonney recovered
  from her astonishment, and with a deprecating smile, half shy, half amused,
  she slipped off her glove, and reaching up&mdash;it was rather high for
  her&mdash;inserted her hand into the narrow slit. Brodribb glared at her and
  gobbled like a turkey-cock, and I watched her with a sudden suspicion that
  something was going to happen. Nor was I mistaken. For, as I looked, the shy,
  puzzled smile faded from her face and was succeeded by an expression of
  incredulous astonishment. Slowly she withdrew her hand, and as it came out of
  the slit it dragged something after it. I started forward, and by the light
  of the lamp above the pump I could see that the object was a leather bag
  secured by a string from which hung a broken seal.</p>

  <p>"It can't be!" she gasped as, with trembling fingers, she untied the
  string. Then, as she peered into the open mouth, she uttered a little cry.
  "It is! It is! It is the necklace!"</p>

  <p>Brodribb was speechless with amazement. So was I; and I was still gazing
  open-mouthed at the bag in Miss Bonney's hands when I felt Thorndyke touch my
  arm. I turned quickly and found him offering me an automatic pistol. "Stand
  by, Jervis," he said quietly, looking towards Gray's Inn.</p>

  <p>I looked in the same direction, and then perceived three men stealing
  round the corner from Jockey's Fields. Brodribb saw them, too, and snatching
  the bag of pearls from his client's hands, buttoned it into his breast pocket
  and placed himself before its owner, grasping his stick with a war-like air.
  The three men filed along the pavement until they were opposite us, when they
  turned simultaneously and bore down on the pump, each man, as I noticed,
  holding his right hand behind him. In a moment, Thorndyke's hand, grasping a
  pistol, flew up&mdash;as did mine, also&mdash;and he called out sharply:
  "Stop! If any man moves a hand, I fire."</p>

  <p>The challenge brought them up short, evidently unprepared for this kind of
  reception. What would have happened next it is impossible to guess. But at
  this moment a police whistle sounded and two constables ran out from Hand
  Court. The whistle was instantly echoed from the direction of Warwick Court,
  whence two more constabulary figures appeared through the postern gate of
  Gray's Inn. Our three attendants hesitated but for an instant. Then, with one
  accord, they turned tail and flew like the wind round into Jockey's Fields,
  with the whole posse of constables close on their heels.</p>

  <p>"Remarkable coincidence," said Brodribb, "that those policemen should
  happen to be on the look-out. Or isn't it a coincidence?"</p>

  <p>"I telephoned to the station superintendent before I started," replied
  Thorndyke, "warning him of a possible breach of the peace at this spot."</p>

  <p>Brodribb chuckled. "You're a wonderful man, Thorndyke. You think of
  everything. I wonder if the police will catch those fellows."</p>

  <p>"It is no concern of ours," replied Thorndyke. "We've got the pearls, and
  that finishes the business. There will be no more shadowing, in any
  case."</p>

  <p>Miss Bonney heaved a comfortable little sigh and glanced gratefully at
  Thorndyke. "You can have no idea what a relief that is!" she exclaimed; "to
  say nothing of the treasure-trove."</p>

  <p>We waited some time, but as neither the fugitives nor the constables
  reappeared, we presently made our way back down Brownlow Street. And there it
  was that Brodribb had an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," said be. "I will just pop these things in my
  strong-room&mdash;they will be perfectly safe there until the bank opens
  to-morrow&mdash;and then we'll go and have a nice little dinner. I'll pay the
  piper."</p>

  <p>"Indeed you won't!" exclaimed Miss Bonney. "This is my thanksgiving
  festival, and the benevolent wizard shall be the guest of the evening."</p>

  <p>"Very well, my dear," agreed Brodribb. "I will pay and charge it to the
  estate. But I stipulate that the benevolent wizard shall tell us exactly what
  the oracle said. That is essential to the preservation of my sanity."</p>

  <p>"You shall have his ipsissima verba," Thorndyke promised; and the
  resolution was carried, nem. con.</p>

  <p>An hour and a half later we were seated around a table in a private room
  of a caf to which Mr. Brodribb had conducted us. I may not divulge its
  whereabouts, though I may, perhaps, hint that we approached it by way of
  Wardour Street. At any rate, we had dined, even to the fulfilment of
  Brodribb's ideal, and coffee and liqueurs furnished a sort of gastronomic
  doxology. Brodribb had lighted a cigar and Thorndyke had produced a
  vicious-looking little black cheroot, which he regarded fondly and then
  returned to its abiding-place as unsuited to the present company.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Brodribb, watching Thorndyke fill his pipe (as understudy of
  the cheroot aforesaid), "we are waiting to hear the words of the oracle."</p>

  <p>"You shall hear them," Thorndyke replied. "There were only five of them.
  But first, there are certain introductory matters to be disposed of. The
  solution of this problem is based on two well-known physical facts, one
  metallurgical and the other optical."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Brodribb. "But you must temper the wind to the shorn lamb, you
  know, Thorndyke. Miss Bonney and I are not scientists."</p>

  <p>"I will put the matter quite simply, but you must have the facts. The
  first relates to the properties of malleable metals&mdash;excepting iron and
  steel&mdash;and especially of copper and its alloys. If a plate of such metal
  or alloy&mdash;say, bronze, for instance&mdash;is made red-hot and quenched
  in water, it becomes quite soft and flexible&mdash;the reverse of what
  happens in the case of iron. Now, if such a plate of softened metal be placed
  on a steel anvil and hammered, it becomes extremely hard and brittle."</p>

  <p>"I follow that," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Then see what follows. If, instead of hammering the soft plate, you put
  on it the edge of a blunt chisel and strike on that chisel a sharp blow, you
  produce an indented line. Now the plate remains soft; but the metal forming
  the indented line has been hammered and has become hard. There is now a line
  of hard metal on the soft plate. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Brodribb; and Thorndyke accordingly continued: "The
  second fact is this: If a beam of light falls on a polished surface which
  reflects it, and if that surface is turned through a given angle, the beam of
  light is deflected through double that angle."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" grunted Brodribb. "Yes. No doubt. I hope we are not going to get
  into any deeper waters, Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"We are not," replied the latter, smiling urbanely. "We are now going to
  consider the application of these facts. Have you ever seen a Japanese magic
  mirror?</p>

  <p>"Never; nor even heard of such a thing."</p>

  <p>"They are bronze mirrors, just like the ancient Greek or Etruscan
  mirrors&mdash;which are probably 'magic' mirrors, too. A typical specimen
  consists of a circular or oval plate of bronze, highly polished on the face
  and decorated on the back with chased ornament&mdash;commonly a dragon or
  some such device&mdash;and furnished with a handle. The ornament is, as I
  have said, chased; that is to say, it is executed in indented lines made with
  chasing tools, which are, in effect, small chisels, more or less blunt, which
  are struck with a chasing-hammer.</p>

  <p>"Now these mirrors have a very singular property. Although the face is
  perfectly plain, as a mirror should be, yet, if a beam of sunlight is caught
  on it and reflected, say, on to a white wall, the round or oval patch of
  light on the wall is not a plain light patch. It shows quite clearly the
  ornament on the back of the mirror."</p>

  <p>"But how extraordinary!" exclaimed Miss Bonney.</p>

  <p>"It sounds quite incredible." I said.</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed. "And yet the explanation is quite simple.
  Professor Sylvanus Thompson pointed it out years ago. It is based on the
  facts which I have just stated to you. The artist who makes one of these
  mirrors begins, naturally, by annealing the metal until it is quite soft.
  Then he chases the design on the back, and this design then shows slightly on
  the face. But he now grinds the face perfectly flat with fine emery and water
  so that the traces of the design are complete obliterated. Finally, he
  polishes the face with rouge on a soft buff.</p>

  <p>"But now observe that wherever the chasing-tool has made a line, the metal
  is hardened right through, so that the design is in hard metal on a soft
  matrix. But the hardened metal resists the wear of the polishing buffer more
  than the soft metal does. The result is that the act of polishing causes the
  design to appear in faint relief on the face. Its projection is
  infinitesimal&mdash;less than the hundred-thousandth of an inch&mdash;and
  totally invisible to the eye. But, minute as it is, owing to the optical law
  which I mentioned&mdash;which, in effect, doubles the projection&mdash;it is
  enough to influence the reflection of light. As a consequence, every chased
  line appears on the patch of light as a dark line with a bright border, and
  so the whole design is visible. I think that is quite clear."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly clear," Miss Bonney and Brodribb agreed.</p>

  <p>"But now," pursued Thorndyke, "before we come to the casket, there is a
  very curious corollary which I must mention. Supposing our artist, having
  finished the mirror, should proceed with a scraper to erase the design from
  the back; and on the blank, scraped surface to etch a new design. The process
  of etching does not harden the metal, so the new design does not appear on
  the reflection. But the old design would. For although it was invisible on
  the face and had been erased from the back, it would still exist in the
  substance of the metal and continue to influence the reflection. The odd
  result would be that the design which would be visible in the patch of light
  on the wall would be a different one from that on the back of the mirror.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, you see what I am leading up to. But I will take the
  investigation of the casket as it actually occurred. It was obvious, at once,
  that the value of the thing was extrinsic. It had no intrinsic value, either
  in material or workmanship. What could that value be? The clear suggestion
  was that the casket was the vehicle of some secret message or information. It
  had been made by Uyenishi, who had almost certainly had possession of the
  missing pearls, and who had been so closely pursued that be never had an
  opportunity to communicate with his confederates. It was to be given to a man
  who was almost certainly one of those confederates; and, since the pearls had
  never been traced, there was a distinct probability that the (presumed)
  message referred to some hiding-place in which Uyenishi had concealed them
  during his flight, and where they were probably still hidden.</p>

  <p>"With these considerations in my mind, I examined the casket, and this was
  what I found. The thing, itself, was a common white-metal casting, made
  presentable by means of lacquer. But the white metal bottom had been cut out
  and replaced by a plate of fine bronze&mdash;Shakudo. The inside of this was
  covered with an etched design, which immediately aroused my suspicions.
  Turning it over, I saw that the outside of the bottom was not only smooth and
  polished; it was a true mirror. It gave a perfectly undistorted reflection of
  my face. At once, I suspected that the mirror held the secret; that the
  message, whatever it was, had been chased on the back, had then been scraped
  away and an etched design worked on it to hide the traces of the scraper.</p>

  <p>"As soon as you were gone, I took the casket up to the laboratory and
  threw a strong beam of parallel light from a condenser on the bottom,
  catching the reflection on a sheet of white paper. The result was just what I
  had expected. On the bright oval patch on the paper could be seen the
  shadowy, but quite distinct, forms of five words in the Japanese
  character.</p>

  <p>"I was in somewhat of a dilemma, for I have no knowledge of Japanese,
  whereas the circumstances were such as to make it rather unsafe to employ a
  translator. However, as I do just know the Japanese characters and possess a
  Japanese dictionary, I determined to make an attempt to fudge out the words
  myself. If I failed, I could then look for a discreet translator.</p>

  <p>"However, it proved to be easier than I had expected, for the words were
  detached; they did not form a sentence, and so involved no questions of
  grammar. I spelt out the first word and then looked it up in the dictionary.
  The translation was 'pearls.' This looked hopeful, and I went on to the next,
  of which the translation was 'pump.' The third word floored me. It seemed to
  be 'jokkis,' or 'jokkish,' but there was no such word in the dictionary; so I
  turned to the next word, hoping that it would explain its predecessor. And it
  did. The fourth word was 'fields,' and the last word was evidently 'London.'
  So the entire group read 'Pearls, Pump, Jokkis, Fields, London.'</p>

  <p>"Now, there is no pump, so far as I know, in Jockey Fields, but there is
  one in Bedford Row close to the corner of the Fields, and exactly opposite
  the end of Brownlow Street And by Mr. Brodribb's account, Uyenishi, in his
  flight, ran down Hand Court and returned up Brownlow Street, as if he were
  making for the pump. As the latter is disused and the handle-hole is high up,
  well out of the way of children, it offers quite a good temporary
  hiding-place, and I had no doubt that the bag of pearls had been poked into
  it and was probably there still. I was tempted to go at once and explore; but
  I was anxious that the discovery should be made by Miss Bonney, herself, and
  I did not dare to make a preliminary exploration for fear of being shadowed.
  If I had found the treasure I should have had to take it and give it to her;
  which would have been a flat ending to the adventure. So I had to dissemble
  and be the occasion of much smothered objurgation on the part of my friend
  Brodribb. And that is the whole story of my interview with the oracle."</p>

  <p>Our mantelpiece is becoming a veritable museum of trophies of victory, the
  gifts of grateful clients. Among them is a squat, shapeless figure of a
  Japanese gentleman of the old school, with a silly grinning little
  face&mdash;The Magic Casket. But its possession is no longer a menace. Its
  sting has been drawn; its magic is exploded; its secret is exposed, and its
  glory departed.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2"></a>THE CONTENTS OF A MARE'S NEST</h2>

  <p class="first">"IT is very unsatisfactory," said Mr. Stalker, of the
  Griffin Life Assurance Company, at the close of a consultation on a doubtful
  claim. "I suppose we shall have to pay up."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you will," said Thorndyke. "The death was properly certified,
  the deceased is buried, and you have not a single fact with which to support
  an application for further inquiry."</p>

  <p>"No," Stalker agreed. "But I am not satisfied. I don't believe that doctor
  really knew what she died from. I wish cremation were more usual."</p>

  <p>"So, I have no doubt, has many a poisoner," Thorndyke remarked dryly.</p>

  <p>Stalker laughed, but stuck to his point. "I know you don't agree," said
  he, "but from our point of view it is much more satisfactory to know that the
  extra precautions have been taken. In a cremation case, you have not to
  depend on the mere death certificate; you have the cause of death verified by
  an independent authority, and it is difficult to see how any miscarriage can
  occur."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "It is a delusion, Stalker. You can't provide in
  advance for unknown contingencies. In practice, your special precautions
  degenerate into mere formalities. If the circumstances of a death appear
  normal, the independent authority will certify; if they appear abnormal, you
  won't get a certificate at all. And if suspicion arises only after the
  cremation has taken place, it can neither be confirmed nor rebutted."</p>

  <p>"My point is," said Stalker, "that the searching examination would lead to
  discovery of a crime before cremation."</p>

  <p>"That is the intention," Thorndyke admitted. "But no examination, short of
  an exhaustive post-mortem, would make it safe to destroy a body so that no
  reconsideration of the cause of death would be possible."</p>

  <p>Stalker smiled as he picked up his hat. "Well," he said, "to a cobbler
  there is nothing like leather, and I suppose that to a toxicologist there is
  nothing like an exhumation," and with this parting shot he took his
  leave.</p>

  <p>We had not seen the last of him, however. In the course of the same week
  he looked in to consult us on a fresh matter.</p>

  <p>"A rather queer case has turned up," said he. "I don't know that we are
  deeply concerned in it, but we should like to have your opinion as to how we
  stand. The position is this: Eighteen months ago, a man named Ingle insured
  with us for fifteen hundred pounds, and he was then accepted as a first-class
  life. He has recently died&mdash;apparently from heart failure, the heart
  being described as fatty and dilated&mdash;and his wife, Sibyl, who is the
  sole legatee and executrix, has claimed payment.</p>

  <p>"But just as we were making arrangements to pay, a caveat has been entered
  by a certain Margaret Ingle, who declares that she is the wife of the
  deceased and claims the estate as next-of-kin. She states that the alleged
  wife, Sibyl, is a widow named Huggard who contracted a bigamous marriage with
  the deceased, knowing that he had a wife living."</p>

  <p>"An interesting situation," commented Thorndyke, "but, as you say, it
  doesn't particularly concern you. It is a matter for the Probate Court."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Stalker. "But that is not all. Margaret Ingle not only
  charges the other woman with bigamy; she accuses her of having made away with
  the deceased."</p>

  <p>"On what grounds?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the reasons she gives are rather shadowy. She states that Sibyl's
  husband, James Huggard, died under suspicious circumstances&mdash;there seems
  to have been some suspicion that he had been poisoned&mdash;and she asserts
  that Ingle was a healthy, sound man and could not have died from the causes
  alleged."</p>

  <p>"There is some reason in that," said Thorndyke, "if he was really a
  first-class life only eighteen months ago. As to the first husband, Huggard,
  we should want some particulars: as to whether there was an inquest what was
  the alleged cause of death, and what grounds there were for suspecting that
  he had been poisoned. If there really were any suspicious circumstances, it
  would be advisable to apply to the Home Office for an order to exhume the
  body of Ingle and verify the cause of death."</p>

  <p>Stalker smiled somewhat sheepishly. "Unfortunately," said he, "that is not
  possible. Ingle was cremated."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Thorndyke, "that is, as you say, unfortunate. It clearly
  increases the suspicion of poisoning, but destroys the means of verifying
  that suspicion."</p>

  <p>"I should tell you," said Stalker, "that the cremation was in accordance
  with the provisions of the will."</p>

  <p>"That is not very material," replied Thorndyke. "In fact, it rather
  accentuates the suspicious aspect of the case; for the knowledge that the
  death of the deceased would be followed by cremation might act as a further
  inducement to get rid of him by poison. There were two death certificates, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The confirmatory certificate was given by Dr. Halbury, of Wimpole
  Street. The medical attendant was a Dr. Barber, of Howland Street. The
  deceased lived in Stock-Orchard Crescent, Holloway."</p>

  <p>"A good distance from Howland Street," Thorndyke remarked. "Do you know if
  Halbury made a post-mortem? I don't suppose he did."</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't," replied Stalker.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "his certificate is worthless. You can't tell
  whether a man has died from heart failure by looking at his dead body. He
  must have just accepted the opinion of the medical attendant. Do I understand
  that you want me to look into this case?"</p>

  <p>"If you will. It is not really our concern whether or not the man was
  poisoned, though I suppose we should have a claim on the estate of the
  murderer. But we should like you to investigate the case; though how the
  deuce you are going to do it I don't quite see."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said Thorndyke. "However, we must get into touch with the
  doctors who signed the certificates, and possibly they may be able to clear
  the whole matter up."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said I, "there is the other body&mdash;that of
  Huggard&mdash;which might be exhumed&mdash;unless he was cremated, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke; "and for the purposes of the criminal law,
  evidence of poisoning in that case would be sufficient. But it would hardly
  help the Griffin Company, which is concerned exclusively with Ingle deceased.
  Can you let us have a prcis of the facts relating to this case,
  Stalker?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought one with me," was the reply; "a short statement, giving
  names, addresses, dates, and other particulars. Here it is;" and he handed
  Thorndyke a sheet of paper bearing a tabulated statement.</p>

  <p>When Stalker had gone Thorndyke glanced rapidly through the prcis and
  then looked at his watch. "If we make our way to Wimpole Street at once,"
  said he, "we ought to catch Halbury. That is obviously the first thing to do.
  He signed the 'C' certificate, and we shall be able to judge from what he
  tells us whether there is any possibility of foul play. Shall we start
  now?"</p>

  <p>As I assented, he slipped the prcis in his pocket and we set forth. At
  the top of Middle Temple Lane we chartered a taxi by which we were shortly
  deposited at Dr. Halbury's door and a few minutes later were ushered into his
  consulting room, and found him shovelling a pile of letters into the
  waste-paper basket.</p>

  <p>"How d'ye do?" he said briskly, holding out his hand. "I'm up to my eyes
  in arrears, you see. Just back from my holiday. What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"We have called," said Thorndyke, "about a man named Ingle."</p>

  <p>"Ingle&mdash;Ingle," repeated Halbury. "Now, let me see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stock-Orchard Crescent, Holloway," Thorndyke explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I remember him. Well, how is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's dead," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Is he really?" exclaimed Halbury. "Now that shows how careful one should
  be in one's judgments. I half suspected that fellow of malingering. He was
  supposed to have a dilated heart, but I couldn't make out any appreciable
  dilatation. There was excited, irregular action. That was all. I had a
  suspicion that he had been dosing himself with trinitrine. Reminded me of the
  cases of cordite chewing that I used to meet with in South Africa. So he's
  dead, after all. Well, it's queer. Do you know what the exact cause of death
  was?"</p>

  <p>"Failure of a dilated heart is the cause stated on the
  certificates&mdash;the body was cremated; and the 'C' Certificate was signed
  by you."</p>

  <p>"By me!" exclaimed the physician. "Nonsense! It's a mistake. I signed a
  certificate for a Friendly Society. Ingle brought it here for me to
  sign&mdash;but I didn't even know he was dead. Besides, I went away for my
  holiday a few days after I saw the man and only came back yesterday. What
  makes you think I signed the death certificate?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced Stalker's prcis and handed it to Halbury, who read out
  his own name and address with a puzzled frown. "This is an extraordinary
  affair," said he. "It will have to be looked into."</p>

  <p>"It will, indeed," assented Thorndyke; "especially as a suspicion of
  poisoning has been raised."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Halbury. "Then it was trinitrine, you may depend. But I
  suspected him unjustly. It was somebody else who was dosing him; perhaps that
  sly-looking baggage of a wife of his. Is anyone in particular suspected?</p>

  <p>"Yes. The accusation, such as it is, is against the wife."</p>

  <p>"H'm. Probably a true bill. But she's done us. Artful devil. You can't get
  much evidence out of an urnful of ashes. Still, somebody has forged my
  signature. I suppose that is what the hussy wanted that certificate
  for&mdash;to get a specimen of my handwriting. I see the 'B' certificate was
  signed by a man named Meeking. Who's he? It was Barber who called me in for
  an opinion."</p>

  <p>"I must find out who he is," replied Thorndyke. "Possibly Dr. Barber will
  know. I shall go and call on him now."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Dr. Halbury, shaking hands as we rose to depart, "you ought to
  see Barber. He knows the history of the case, at any rate."</p>

  <p>From Wimpole Street we steered a course for Howland Street, and here we
  had the good fortune to arrive just as Dr. Barber's car drew up at the door.
  Thorndyke introduced himself and me, and then introduced the subject of his
  visit, but said nothing, at first, about our call on Dr. Halbury.</p>

  <p>"Ingle," repeated Dr. Barber. "Oh, yes, I remember him. And you say he is
  dead. Well, I'm rather surprised. I didn't regard his condition as
  serious."</p>

  <p>"Was his heart dilated?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Not appreciably. I found nothing organic; no valvular disease. It was
  more like a tobacco heart. But it's odd that Meeking didn't mention the
  matter to me&mdash;he was my locum, you know. I handed the case over to him
  when I went on my holiday. And you say he signed the death certificate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and the 'B' certificate for cremation, too."</p>

  <p>"Very odd," said Dr. Barber. "Just come in and let us have a look at the
  day book."</p>

  <p>We followed him into the consulting room, and there, while he was turning
  over the leaves of the day book, I ran my eye along the shelf over the
  writing-table from which he had taken it; on which I observed the usual
  collection of case books and books of certificates and notification forms,
  including the book of death certificates.</p>

  <p>"Yes;" said Dr. Barber, "here we are; 'Ingle, Mr., Stock-Orchard
  Crescent.' The last visit was on the 4th of September, and Meeking seems to
  have given some sort of certificate. Wonder if he used a printed form." He
  took down two of the books and turned over the counterfoils.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said presently; "'Ingle, Jonathan, 4 September. Now
  recovered and able to resume duties.' That doesn't look like dying, does it?
  Still, we may as well make sure."</p>

  <p>He reached down the book of death certificates and began to glance through
  the most recent entries.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, turning over the leaves, "there doesn't seem to
  be&mdash;Hullo! What's this? Two blank counterfoils; and about the date, too;
  between the 2nd and 13th of September. Extraordinary! Meeking is such a
  careful, reliable man."</p>

  <p>He turned back to the day book and read through the fortnight's entries.
  Then he looked up with an anxious frown.</p>

  <p>"I can't make this out," he said. "There is no record of any patient
  having died in that period."</p>

  <p>"Where is Dr. Meeking at present?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere in the South Atlantic," replied Barber. "He left here three
  weeks ago to take up a post on a Royal Mail Boat. So he couldn't have signed
  the certificate in any case."</p>

  <p>That was all that Dr. Barber had to tell us, and a few minutes later we
  took our departure.</p>

  <p>"This case looks pretty fishy," I remarked, as we turned down Tottenham
  Court Road.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed. "There is evidently something radically wrong.
  And what strikes me especially is the cleverness of the fraud; the knowledge
  and judgment and foresight that are displayed."</p>

  <p>"She took pretty considerable risks," I observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but only the risks that were unavoidable. Everything that could be
  foreseen has been provided for. All the formalities have been complied
  with&mdash;in appearance. And you must notice, Jervis, that the scheme did
  actually succeed. The cremation has taken place. Nothing but the incalculable
  accident of the appearance of the real Mrs. Ingle, and her vague and
  apparently groundless suspicions, prevented the success from being final. If
  she had not come on the scene, no questions would ever have been asked."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed. "The discovery of the plot is a matter of sheer bad luck.
  But what do you suppose has really happened?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult to say. The mechanism of the affair is obvious
  enough, but the motives and purpose are rather incomprehensible. The illness
  was apparently a sham, the symptoms being produced by nitro-glycerine or some
  similar heart poison. The doctors were called in, partly for the sake of
  appearances and partly to get specimens of their handwriting. The fact that
  both the doctors happened to be away from home and one of them at sea at the
  time when verbal questions might have been asked&mdash;by the undertaker, for
  instance&mdash;suggests that this had been ascertained in advance. The death
  certificate forms were pretty certainly stolen by the woman when she was left
  alone in Barber's consulting-room, and, of course, the cremation certificates
  could be obtained on application to the crematorium authorities. That is all
  plain sailing. The mystery is, what is it all about? Barber or Meeking would
  almost certainly have given a death certificate, although the death was
  unexpected, and I don't suppose Halbury would have refused to confirm it.
  They would have assumed that their diagnosis had been at fault."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it could have been suicide, or an in advertent overdose of
  trinitrine?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly. If it was suicide, it was deliberate, for the purpose of getting
  the insurance money for the woman, unless there was some further motive
  behind. And the cremation, with all its fuss and formalities, is against
  suicide; while the careful preparation seems to exclude inadvertent
  poisoning. Then, what was the motive for the sham illness except as a
  preparation for an abnormal death?"</p>

  <p>"That is true," said I. "But if you reject suicide, isn't it rather
  remarkable that the victim should have provided for his own cremation?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know that he did," replied Thorndyke. "There is a suggestion of
  a capable forger in this business. It is quite possible that the will itself
  is a forgery."</p>

  <p>"So it is!" I exclaimed. "I hadn't thought of that."</p>

  <p>"You see," continued Thorndyke, "the appearances suggest that cremation
  was a necessary part of the programme; otherwise these extraordinary risks
  would not have been taken. The woman was sole executrix and could have
  ignored the cremation clause. But if the cremation was necessary, why was it
  necessary? The suggestion is that there was something suspicious in the
  appearance of the body; something that the doctors, would certainly have
  observed or that would have been discovered if an exhumation had taken
  place."</p>

  <p>"You mean some injury or visible signs of poisoning?"</p>

  <p>"I mean something discoverable by examination even after burial."</p>

  <p>"But what about the undertaker? Wouldn't he have noticed anything palpably
  abnormal?"</p>

  <p>"An excellent suggestion, Jervis. We must see the undertaker. We have his
  address: Kentish Town Road&mdash;a long way from deceased's house, by the
  way. We had better get on a bus and go there now."</p>

  <p>A yellow omnibus was approaching as he spoke. We hailed it and sprang on,
  continuing our discussion as we were borne northward.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burrell, the undertaker, was a pensive-looking, profoundly civil man
  who was evidently in a small way, for he combined with his funeral functions
  general carpentry and cabinet making. He was perfectly willing to give any
  required information, but he seemed to have very little to give.</p>

  <p>"I never really saw the deceased gentleman," he said in reply to
  Thorndyke's cautious inquiries. "When I took the measurements, the corpse was
  covered with a sheet; and as Mrs. Ingle was in the room, I made the business
  as short as possible."</p>

  <p>"You didn't put the body in the coffin, then?"</p>

  <p>"No. I left the coffin at the house, but Mrs. Ingle said that she and the
  deceased gentleman's brother would lay the body in it."</p>

  <p>"But didn't you see the corpse when you screwed the coffin-lid down?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't screw it down. When I got there it was screwed down already.
  Mrs. Ingle said they had to close up the coffin, and I dare say it was
  necessary. The weather was rather warm; and I noticed a strong smell of
  formalin."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, as we walked back down the Kentish Town Road, "we haven't
  got much more forward."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," replied Thorndyke. "We have a further instance of
  the extraordinary adroitness with which this scheme was carried out; and we
  have confirmation of our suspicion that there was something unusual in the
  appearance of the body. It is evident that this woman did not dare to let
  even the undertaker see it. But one can hardly help admiring the combination
  of daring and caution, the boldness with which these risks were taken, and
  the care and judgment with which they were provided against. And again I
  point out that the risks were justified by the result. The secret of that
  man's death appears to have been made secure for all time."</p>

  <p>It certainly looked as if the mystery with which we were concerned were
  beyond the reach of investigation. Of course, the woman could be prosecuted
  for having forged the death certificates, to say nothing of the charge of
  bigamy. But that was no concern of ours or Stalker's. Jonathan Ingle was
  dead, and no one could say how he died.</p>

  <p>On our arrival at our chambers we found a telegram that had just arrived,
  announcing that Stalker would call on us in the evening; and as this seemed
  to suggest that he had some fresh information we looked forward to his visit
  with considerable interest. Punctually at six o'clock he made his appearance
  and at once opened the subject.</p>

  <p>"There are some new developments in this Ingle case," said he. "In the
  first place, the woman, Huggard, has bolted. I went to the house to make a
  few inquiries and found the police in possession. They had come to arrest her
  on the bigamy charge, but she had got wind of their intentions and cleared
  out. They made a search of the premises, but I don't think they found
  anything of interest except a number of rifle cartridges; and I don't know
  that they are of much interest either, for she could hardly have shot him
  with a rifle."</p>

  <p>"What kind of cartridges were they?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>Stalker put his hand in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"The inspector let me have one to show you," said he; and he laid on the
  table a military cartridge of the pattern of some twenty years ago. Thorndyke
  picked it up, and taking from a drawer a pair of pliers drew the bullet out
  of the case and inserted into the latter a pair of dissecting forceps. When
  he withdrew the forceps, their points grasped one or two short strings of
  what looked like cat-gut.</p>

  <p>"Cordite!" said I. "So Halbury was probably right, and this is how she got
  her supply." Then, as Stalker looked at me inquiringly, I gave him a short
  account of the results of our investigations.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "the plot thickens. This juggling with the death
  certificates seems to connect itself with another kind of juggling that I
  came to tell you about. You know that Ingle was Secretary and Treasurer to a
  company that bought and sold land for building estates. Well, I called at
  their office after I left you and had a little talk with the chairman. From
  him I learned that Ingle had practically complete control of the financial
  affairs of the company, that he received and paid all moneys and kept the
  books. Of late, however, some of the directors have had a suspicion that all
  was not well with the finances, and at last it was decided to have the
  affairs of the company thoroughly overhauled by a firm of chartered
  accountants. This decision was communicated to Ingle, and a couple of days
  later a letter arrived from his wife saying that he had had a severe heart
  attack and asking that the audit of the books might be postponed until he
  recovered and was able to attend at the office."</p>

  <p>"And was it postponed?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stalker. "The accountants were asked to get to work at once,
  which they did; with the result that they discovered a number of
  discrepancies in the books and a sum of about three thousand pounds
  unaccounted for. It isn't quite obvious how the frauds were carried out, but
  it is suspected that some of the returned cheques are fakes with forged
  endorsements."</p>

  <p>"Did the company communicate with Ingle on the subject?" asked
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No. They had a further letter from Mrs. Ingle&mdash;that is,
  Huggard&mdash;saying that Ingle's condition was very serious; so they decided
  to wait until he had recovered. Then, of course, came the announcement of his
  death, on which the matter was postponed pending the probate of the will. I
  suppose a claim will be made on the estate, but as the executrix has
  absconded, the affair has become rather complicated."</p>

  <p>"You were saying," said Thorndyke, "that the fraudulent death certificates
  seem to be connected with these frauds on the company. What kind of
  connection do you assume?"</p>

  <p>"I assume&mdash;or at least, suggest," replied Stalker, "that this was a
  case of suicide. The man, Ingle, saw that his frauds were discovered, or were
  going to be, and that he was in for a long term of penal servitude, so he
  just made away with himself. And I think that if the murder charge could be
  dropped, Mrs. Huggard might be induced to come forward and give evidence as
  to the suicide."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The murder charge couldn't be dropped," said he, "if it was suicide,
  Huggard was certainly an accessory; and in law, an accessory to suicide is an
  accessory to murder. But, in fact, no official charge of murder has been
  made, and at present there are no means of sustaining such a charge. The
  identity of the ashes might be assumed to be that stated in the cremation
  order, but the difficulty is the cause of death. Ingle was admittedly ill. He
  was attended for heart disease by three doctors. There is no evidence that he
  did not die from that illness."</p>

  <p>"But the illness was due to cordite poisoning," said I, "That is what we
  believe. But no one could swear to it. And we certainly could not swear that
  he died from cordite poisoning."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Stalker, "apparently there is no means of finding out whether
  his death was due to natural causes, suicide, or murder?"</p>

  <p>"There is only one chance," replied Thorndyke. "It is just barely possible
  that the cause of death might be ascertainable by an examination of the
  ashes."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem very hopeful," said I. "Cordite poisoning would
  certainly leave no trace."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't assume that he died from cordite poisoning," said Thorndyke.
  "Probably he did not. That may have masked the action of a less obvious
  poison, or death might have been produced by some new agent."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "how many poisons are there that could be detected in
  the ashes? No organic poison would leave any traces, nor would metallic
  poisons such as mercury, antimony, or arsenic."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "But there are other metallic poisons which could
  be easily recovered from the ashes; lead, tin, gold, and silver, for
  instance. But it is useless to discuss speculative probabilities. The only
  chance that we have of obtaining any new facts is by an examination of the
  ashes. It seems infinitely improbable that we shall learn anything from it,
  but there is the bare possibility and we ought not to leave it untried."</p>

  <p>Neither Stalker nor I made any further remark, but I could see that the
  same thought was in both our minds. It was not often that Thorndyke was
  "gravelled;" but apparently the resourceful Mrs. Huggard had set him a
  problem that was beyond even his powers. When an investigator of crime is
  reduced to the necessity of examining a potful of ashes in the wild hope of
  ascertaining from them how the deceased met his death, one may assume that he
  is at the very end of his tether. It is a forlorn hope indeed.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Thorndyke seemed to view the matter quite cheerfully, his
  only anxiety being lest the Home Secretary should refuse to make the order
  authorising the examination. And this anxiety was dispelled a day or two
  later by the arrival of a letter giving the necessary authority, and
  informing him that a Dr. Hemming&mdash;known to us both as an expert
  pathologist&mdash;had been deputed to be present at the examination and to
  confer with him as to the necessity for a chemical analysis.</p>

  <p>On the appointed day Dr. Hemming called at our chambers and we set forth
  together for Liverpool Street; and as we drove thither it became evident to
  me that his view of our mission was very similar to my own. For, though he
  talked freely enough, and on professional topics, he maintained a most
  discreet silence on the subject of the forthcoming inspection; indeed, the
  first reference to the subject was made by Thorndyke himself just as the
  train was approaching Corfield, where the crematorium was situated.</p>

  <p>"I presume," said he, "you have made all necessary arrangements,
  Hemming?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "The superintendent will meet us and will conduct us
  to the catacombs, and there, in our presence, will take the casket from its
  niche in the columbarium and have it conveyed to the office, where the
  examination will be made. I thought it best to use these formalities, though,
  as the casket is sealed and bears the name of the deceased, there is not much
  point in them."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke, "but I think you were right. It would be easy to
  challenge the identity of a mass of ashes if all precautions were not taken,
  seeing that the ashes themselves are unidentifiable."</p>

  <p>"That was what I felt," said Hemming; and then, as the train slowed down,
  he added: "This is our station, and that gentleman on the platform, I
  suspect, is the superintendent."</p>

  <p>The surmise turned out to be correct; but the cemetery official was not
  the only one present bearing that title; for as we were mutually introducing
  ourselves, a familiar tall figure approached up the platform from the rear of
  the train&mdash;our old friend Superintendent Miller of the Criminal
  Investigation Department.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to intrude," said he, as he joined the group and was
  presented by Thorndyke to the strangers, "but we were notified by the Home
  Office that an investigation was to be made, so I thought I would be on the
  spot to pick up any crumbs of information that you may drop. Of course, I am
  not asking to be present at the examination."</p>

  <p>"You may as well be present as an additional witness to the removal of the
  urn," said Thorndyke; and Miller accordingly joined the party, which now made
  its way from the station to the cemetery.</p>

  <p>The catacombs were in a long, low arcaded building at the end of the
  pleasantly-wooded grounds, and on our way thither we passed the crematorium,
  a smallish, church-like edifice with a perforated chimney-shaft partly
  concealed by the low spire. Entering the catacombs, we were conducted to the
  "columbarium," the walls of which were occupied by a multitude of niches or
  pigeon-holes, each niche accommodating a terra-cotta urn or casket. The
  superintendent proceeded to near the end of the gallery, where he halted, and
  opening the register, which he had brought with him, read out a number and
  the name "Jonathan Ingle," and then led us to a niche bearing that number and
  name, in which reposed a square casket, on which was inscribed the name and
  date of death. When we had verified these particulars, the casket was
  tenderly lifted from its place by two attendants, who carried it to a
  well-lighted room at the end of the building, where a large table by a window
  had been covered with white paper. Having placed the casket on the table, the
  attendants retired, and the superintendent then broke the seals and removed
  the cover.</p>

  <p>For a while we all stood looking in at the contents of the casket without
  speaking; and I found myself contrasting them with what would have been
  revealed by the lifting of a coffin-lid. Truly corruption had put on
  incorruption. The mass of snow-white, coral-like fragments, delicate,
  fragile, and lace-like in texture, so far from being repulsive in aspect,
  were almost attractive. I ran my eye, with an anatomist's curiosity, over
  these dazzling remnants of what had lately been a man, half-unconsciously
  seeking to identify and give a name to particular fragments, and a little
  surprised at the difficulty of determining that this or that
  irregularly-shaped white object was a part of any one of the bones with which
  I had thought myself so familiar.</p>

  <p>Presently Hemming looked up at Thorndyke and asked: "Do you observe
  anything abnormal in the appearance of these ashes? I don't."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," replied Thorndyke, "we had better turn them out on to the
  table, so that we can see the whole of them."</p>

  <p>This was done very gently, and then Thorndyke proceeded to spread out the
  heap, touching the fragments with the utmost delicacy&mdash;for they were
  extremely fragile and brittle&mdash;until the whole collection was
  visible.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Hemming, when we had once more looked them over critically,
  "what do you say? I can see no trace of any foreign substance. Can you?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "And there are some other things that I can't
  see. For instance, the medical referee reported that the proposer had a good
  set of sound teeth. Where are they? I have not seen a single fragment of a
  tooth. Yet teeth are far more resistant to fire than bones, especially the
  enamel caps."</p>

  <p>Hemming ran a searching glance over the mass of fragments and looked up
  with a perplexed frown.</p>

  <p>"I certainly can't see any sign of teeth," he admitted, "and it is rather
  curious, as you say. Does the fact suggest any particular significance to
  you?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Thorndyke delicately picked up a flat fragment and
  silently held it out towards us. I looked at it and said nothing; for a very
  strange suspicion was beginning to creep into my mind.</p>

  <p>"A piece of a rib," said Hemming. "Very odd that it should have broken
  across so cleanly. It might have been cut with a saw."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laid it down and picked up another, larger fragment, which I had
  already noticed.</p>

  <p>"Here is another example," said he, handing it to our colleague.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Hemming. "It is really rather extraordinary. It looks
  exactly as if it had been sawn across."</p>

  <p>"It does," agreed Thorndyke. "What bone should you say it is?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I was just asking myself," replied Hemming, looking at the
  fragment with a sort of half-vexed smile. "It seems ridiculous that a
  competent anatomist should be in any doubt with as large a portion as this,
  but really I can't confidently give it a name. The shape seems to me to
  suggest a tibia, but of course it is much too small. Is it the upper end of
  the ulna?"</p>

  <p>"I should say no," answered Thorndyke. Then he picked out another of the
  larger fragments, and handing it to Hemming, asked him to name it.</p>

  <p>Our friend began to look somewhat worried.</p>

  <p>"It is an extraordinary thing, you know," said he, "but I can't tell you
  what bone it is part of. It is clearly the shaft of a long bone, but I'm
  hanged if I can say which. It is too big for a metatarsal and too small for
  any of the main limb bones. It reminds one of a diminutive thigh bone."</p>

  <p>"It does," agreed Thorndyke, "very strongly." While Hemming had been
  speaking he had picked out four more large fragments, and these he now laid
  in a row with the one that had seemed to resemble a tibia in shape. Placed
  thus together, the five fragments bore an obvious resemblance.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "look at these. There are five of them. They are parts of
  limb bones, and the bones of which they are parts were evidently exactly
  alike, excepting that three were apparently from the left side and two from
  the right. Now, you know, Hemming, a man has only four limbs and of those
  only two contain similar bones. Then two of them show distinct traces of what
  looks like a saw-cut."</p>

  <p>Hemming gazed at the row of fragments with a frown of deep cogitation.</p>

  <p>"It is very mysterious," he said. "And looking at them in a row they
  strike me as curiously like tibia in shape; not in size."</p>

  <p>"The size," said Thorndykeis about that of a sheep's tibia."</p>

  <p>"A sheep's?" exclaimed Hemming, staring in amazement, first at the
  calcined bones and then at my colleague.</p>

  <p>"Yes; the upper half, sawn across in the middle of the shank."</p>

  <p>Hemming was thunderstruck. "It is an astounding affair!" he exclaimed.
  "You mean to suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I suggest," said Thorndyke, "that there is not a sign of a human bone in
  the whole collection. But there are very evident traces of at least five legs
  of mutton."</p>

  <p>For a few moments there was a profound silence, broken only by a murmur of
  astonishment from the cemetery official and a low chuckle from Superintendent
  Miller, who had been listening with absorbed interest. At length Hemming
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Then, apparently, there was no corpse in the coffin at all?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Thorndyke. "The weight was made up, and the ashes
  furnished, by joints of butcher's meat. I dare say, if we go over the ashes
  carefully, we shall be able to judge what they were. But it is hardly
  necessary. The presence of five legs of mutton and the absence of a single
  recognisable fragment of a human skeleton, together with the forged
  certificates, gives us a pretty I conclusive case. The rest, I think we can
  leave to Superintendent Miller."</p>
  <hr align="center"
      width="25%">

  <p>"I take it, Thorndyke," said I, as the train moved out of the station,
  "that you came here expecting to find what you did find?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "It seemed to me the only possibility, having regard to
  all the known facts."</p>

  <p>"When did it first occur to you?"</p>

  <p>"It occurred to me as a possibility as soon as we discovered that the
  cremation certificates had been forged; but it was the undertaker's statement
  that seemed to clench the matter."</p>

  <p>"But he distinctly stated that he measured the body."</p>

  <p>"True. But there was nothing to show that it was a dead body. What was
  perfectly clear was that there was something that must on no account be seen;
  and when Stalker told us of the embezzlement we had a body of evidence that
  could point to only one conclusion. Just consider that evidence.</p>

  <p>"Here we had a death, preceded by an obviously sham illness and followed
  by cremation with forged certificates. Now, what was it that had happened?
  There were four possible hypotheses. Normal death, suicide, murder, and
  fictitious death. Which of these hypotheses fitted the facts?</p>

  <p>"Normal death was apparently excluded by the forged certificates.</p>

  <p>"The theory of suicide did not account for the facts. It did not agree
  with the careful, elaborate preparation. And why the forged certificates? If
  Ingle had really died, Meeking would have certified the death. And why the
  cremation? There was no purpose in taking those enormous risks.</p>

  <p>"The theory of murder was unthinkable. These certificates were almost
  certainly forged by Ingle himself, who we know was a practised forger. But
  the idea of the victim arranging for his own cremation is an absurdity.</p>

  <p>"There remained only the theory of fictitious death; and that theory
  fitted all the facts perfectly. First, as to the motive. Ingle had committed
  a felony. He had to disappear. But what kind of disappearance could be so
  effectual as death and cremation? Both the prosecutors and the police would
  forthwith write him off and forget him. Then there was the bigamy&mdash;a
  criminal offence in itself. But death would not only wipe that off; after
  'death' he could marry Huggard regularly under another name, and he would
  have shaken off his deserted wife for ever. And he stood to gain fifteen
  hundred pounds from the Insurance Company. Then see how this theory explained
  the other facts. A fictitious death made necessary a fictitious illness. It
  necessitated the forged certificates, since there was no corpse. It made
  cremation highly desirable; for suspicion might easily have arisen, and then
  the exhumation of a coffin containing a dummy would have exploded the fraud.
  But successful cremation would cover up the fraud for ever. It explained the
  concealment of the corpse from the undertaker, and it even explained the
  smell of formalin which he noticed."</p>

  <p>"How did it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Consider, Jervis," he replied. "The dummy in this coffin had to be a
  dummy of flesh and bone which would yield the correct kind of ash. Joints of
  butcher's meat would fulfil the conditions. But the quantity required would
  be from a hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds. Now Ingle could not go to
  the butcher and order a whole sheep to be sent the day before the funeral.
  The joints would have to be bought gradually and stored. But the storage of
  meat in warm weather calls for some kind of preservative; and formalin is
  highly effective, as it leaves no trace after burning.</p>

  <p>"So you see that the theory of fictitious death agreed with all the known
  circumstances, whereas the alternative theories presented inexplicable
  discrepancies and contradictions. Logically, it was the only possible theory,
  and, as you have seen, experiment proved it to be the true one."</p>

  <p>As he concluded, Dr. Hemming took his pipe from his mouth and laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>"When I came down to-day," said he, "I had all the facts which you had
  communicated to the Home Office, and I was absolutely convinced that we were
  coming to examine a mare's nest. And yet, now I have heard your exposition,
  the whole thing looks perfectly obvious."</p>

  <p>"That is usually the case with Thorndyke's conclusions," said I. "They are
  perfectly obvious&mdash;when you have heard the explanation."</p>

  <p>Within a week of our expedition, Ingle was in the hands of the police. The
  apparent success of the cremation adventure had misled him to a sense of such
  complete security that he had neglected to cover his tracks, and he had
  accordingly fallen an easy prey to our friend Superintendent Miller. The
  police were highly gratified, and so were the directors of the Griffin Life
  Assurance Company.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3"></a>THE STALKING HORSE</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Thorndyke and I descended the stairs of the foot bridge
  at Densford Junction we became aware that something unusual had happened. The
  platform was nearly deserted save at one point, where a small but dense crowd
  had collected around the open door of a first-class compartment of the down
  train; heads were thrust out of the windows of the other coaches, and at
  intervals doors opened and inquisitive passengers ran along to join the
  crowd, from which an excited porter detached himself just as we reached the
  platform.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go for Dr. Pooke first," the station-master called after
  him.</p>

  <p>On this, Thorndyke stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"My friend and I," said he, "are medical men. Can we be of any service
  until the local doctor arrives?"</p>

  <p>"I'm very much afraid not, sir," was the reply, "but you'll see." He
  cleared a way for us and we approached the open door.</p>

  <p>At the first glance there appeared to be nothing to account for the
  awe-stricken expression with which the bystanders peered into the carriage
  and gazed at its solitary occupant. For the motionless figure that sat
  huddled in the corner seat, chin on breast, might have been a sleeping man.
  But it was not. The waxen pallor of the face and the strange, image-like
  immobility forbade the hope of any awakening.</p>

  <p>"It looks almost as if he had passed away in his sleep," said the station
  when we had concluded our brief examination and ascertained certainly that
  the man was dead. "Do you think it was a heart attack, sir?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head and touched with his finger a depressed spot on
  the dead man's waistcoat. When he withdrew his finger it was smeared with
  blood.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" the official gasped, in a horrified whisper. "The man has been
  murdered!" He stared incredulously at the corpse for a few moments and then
  turned and sprang out of the compartment, shutting the door behind him, and
  we heard him giving orders for the coach to be separated and shunted into the
  siding.</p>

  <p>"This is a gruesome affair, Jervis," my colleague, said as he sat down on
  the seat opposite the dead man and cast a searching glance round the
  compartment. "I wonder who this poor fellow was and what was the object of
  the murder? It looks almost too determined, for a common robbery; and, in
  fact, the body does not appear to have been robbed." Here he stooped suddenly
  to pick up one or two minute fragments of glass which seemed to have been
  trodden into the carpet, and which he examined closely in the palm of his
  hand. I leaned over and looked at the fragments, and we agreed that they were
  portions of the bulb of an electric torch or flash-lamp.</p>

  <p>"The significance of these&mdash;if they have any," said Thorndyke, "we
  can consider later. But if they are recent, it would appear that the metal
  part of the bulb has been picked up and taken away. That might be an
  important fact. But, on the other hand, the fragments may have been here some
  time and have no connection with the tragedy; though you notice that they
  were lying opposite the body and opposite the seat which the murderer must
  have occupied when the crime was committed."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, the uncoupled coach began slowly to move towards the
  siding, and we both stooped to make a further search for the remainder of the
  lamp-bulb, And then, almost at the same moment, we perceived two objects
  lying under the opposite seat&mdash;the seat occupied by the dead man. One
  was a small pocket-handkerchief, the other a sheet of notepaper.</p>

  <p>"This," said I, as I picked up the former, "accounts for the strong smell
  of scent in the compartment."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," Thorndyke agreed, "though you will notice that the odour does
  not come principally from the handkerchief, but from the back cushion of the
  corner seat. But here is something more distinctive&mdash;a most
  incriminating piece of evidence, unless it can be answered by an undeniable
  alibi." He held out to me a sheet of letter paper, both pages of which were
  covered with writing in bright blue ink, done with a Hectograph or some
  similar duplicator. It was evidently a circular letter, for it bore the
  printed heading, "Women's Emancipation League, 16 Barnabas Square, S.W.," and
  the contents appeared to refer to a "militant demonstration" planned for the
  near future.</p>

  <p>"It is dated the day before yesterday," commented Thorndyke, "so that it
  might have been lying here for twenty-four hours, though that is obviously
  improbable; and as this is neither the first sheet nor the last, there
  are&mdash;or have been&mdash;at least two more sheets. The police will have
  something to start on, at any rate."</p>

  <p>He laid the letter on the seat and explored both of the hat-racks, taking
  down the dead man's hat, gloves, and umbrella, and noting in the hat the
  initials "F. B." He had just replaced them when voices became audible
  outside, and the station-master climbed up on the foot-board and opened the
  door to admit two men, one of whom I assumed to be a doctor, the other being
  a police inspector.</p>

  <p>"The station-master tells me that this is a case of homicide," said the
  former, addressing us jointly.</p>

  <p>"That is what the appearances suggest," replied Thorndyke. "There is a
  bullet wound, inflicted apparently at quite short range&mdash;the waistcoat
  is perceptibly singed&mdash;and we have found no weapon in the
  compartment."</p>

  <p>The doctor stepped past us and proceeded to make a rapid examination of
  the body.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I agree with you. The position of the wound and the
  posture of the body both suggest that death was practically instantaneous. If
  it had been suicide, the pistol would have been in the hand or on the floor.
  There is no clue to the identity of the murderer, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"We found these on the floor under the dead man's seat," replied
  Thorndyke, indicating the letter and the handkerchief; "and there is some
  glass trodden into the carpet&mdash;apparently the remains of an electric
  flash-lamp."</p>

  <p>The inspector pounced on the handkerchief and the letter, and having
  scrutinised the former vainly in search of name or initials, turned to the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Why, this is a suffragist's letter!" he exclaimed. "But it can't have
  anything to do with this affair. They are mischievous beggars, but they don't
  do this sort of thing." Nevertheless, he carefully bestowed both articles in
  a massive wallet, and approaching the corpse, remarked: "We may as well see
  who he is while we are waiting for the stretcher."</p>

  <p>With a matter-of-fact air, which seemed somewhat to shock the
  station-master, he unbuttoned the coat of the passive figure in the corner
  and thrust his hand into the breast pocket, drawing out a letter-case which
  he opened, and from which he extracted a visiting card. As he glanced at it,
  his face suddenly took on an expression of amazement.</p>

  <p>"God!" he exclaimed in a startled tone. "Who do you think he is, doctor?
  He is Mr. Francis Burnham!"</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at him with an interrogative frown.
  "Burnham&mdash;Burnham," he repeated. "Let me see, now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know? The anti-suffrage man. Surely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted the doctor. "Of course I remember him. The
  arch-enemy of the suffrage movement and&mdash;yes, of course." The doctor's
  brisk speech changed abruptly into a hesitating mumble. Like the inspector,
  he had suddenly "seen a great light;" and again, like the officer, his
  perception had begotten a sudden reticence.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced at his watch. "Our train is a minute overdue," said he.
  "We ought to get back to the platform." Taking a card from his case, he
  handed it to the inspector, who looked at it and slightly raised his
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I don't think my evidence will be of much value," said he; "but, of
  course, I am at your service if you want it." With this and a bow to the
  doctor and the station-master, he climbed down to the ground; and when I had
  given the inspector my card, I followed, and we made our way to the
  platform.</p>

  <p>The case was not long in developing. That very evening, as Thorndyke and I
  were smoking our after-dinner pipes by the fire, a hurried step was heard on
  the stair and was followed by a peremptory knock on our door. The visitor was
  a man of about thirty, with a clean-shaved face, an intense and rather
  neurotic expression, and a restless, excited manner. He introduced himself by
  the name of Cadmus Bawley, and thereby, in effect, indicated the purpose of
  his visit.</p>

  <p>"You know me by name, I expect," he said, speaking rapidly and with a
  sharp, emphatic manner, "and probably you can guess what I have come about.
  You have seen the evening paper, of course?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Bawley, "you know about the murder of the man Burnham,
  because I see that you were present at the discovery; and you know that part
  of a circular letter from our League was found in the compartment. Perhaps
  you will not be surprised to learn that Miss Isabel Dalby has been arrested
  and charged with the murder."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's an infamous affair! A national disgrace!" exclaimed Bawley,
  banging the table with his fist. "A manifest plot of the enemies of social
  reform to get rid of a high-minded, noble-hearted lady whose championship of
  this great Cause they are unable to combat by fair means in the open. And it
  is a wild absurdity, too. As to the fellow, Burnham, I can't pretend to feel
  any regret&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May I suggest"&mdash;Thorndyke interrupted somewhat stiffly&mdash;"that
  the expression of personal sentiments is neither helpful nor discreet? My
  methods of defence&mdash;if that is what you have come about&mdash;are based
  on demonstration rather than rhetoric. Could you give us the plain
  facts?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cadmus Bawley looked unmistakably sulky, but after a short pause, he
  began his recital in a somewhat lower key.</p>

  <p>"The bald facts," he said, "are these: This afternoon, at half-past two,
  Miss Dalby took the train from King's Cross to Holmwood. This is the train
  that stops at Densford Junction and is the one in which Burnham travelled.
  She took a first-class ticket and occupied a compartment for ladies only, of
  which she was the only occupant. She got out at Holmwood and went straight to
  the house of our Vice-President, Miss Carleigh&mdash;who has been confined to
  her room for some days&mdash;and stayed there about an hour. She came back by
  the four-fifteen train, and I met her at the station&mdash;King's
  Cross&mdash;at a quarter to five. We had tea at a restaurant opposite the
  station, and over our tea we discussed the plans for the next demonstration,
  and arranged the rendezvous and the most convenient routes for retreat and
  dispersal when the police should arrive. This involved the making of sketch
  plans, and these Miss Dalby drew on a sheet of paper that she took from her
  pocket, and which happened to be part of the circular letter referring to the
  raid. After tea we walked together down Gray's Inn Road and parted at
  Theobald's Road, I going on to the head-quarters and she to her rooms in
  Queen Square. On her arrival home, she found two detectives waiting outside
  her house, and then&mdash;and then, in short, she was arrested, like a common
  criminal, and taken to the police station, where she was searched and the
  remainder of the circular letter found in her pocket. Then she was formally
  charged with the murder of the man Burnham, and she was graciously permitted
  to send a telegram to head-quarters. It arrived just after I got there, and,
  of course, I at once went to the police station. The police refused to accept
  bail, but they allowed me to see her to make arrangements for the
  defence."</p>

  <p>"Does Miss Dalby offer any suggestion," asked Thorndyke, "as to how a
  sheet of her letter came to be in the compartment with the murdered man?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" replied Mr. Bawley. "I had forgotten that. It wasn't her letter
  at all. She destroyed her copy of the letter as soon as she had read it."</p>

  <p>"Then," inquired Thorndyke, "how came the letter to be in her pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," replied Bawley, "that is the mystery. She thinks someone must have
  slipped it into her pocket to throw suspicion on her."</p>

  <p>"Did she seem surprised to find it in her pocket when you were having tea
  together?"</p>

  <p>"No. She had forgotten having destroyed her copy. She only remembered it
  when I told her that the sheet had been found in Burnham's carriage."</p>

  <p>"Can she produce the fragments of the destroyed letter?"</p>

  <p>"No, she can't. Unfortunately she burned it."</p>

  <p>"Do these circular letters bear any distinguishing mark? Are they
  addressed to members by name?"</p>

  <p>"Only on the envelopes. The letters are all alike. They are run off a
  duplicator. Of course, if you don't believe the story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not judging the case," interrupted Thorndyke; "I am simply
  collecting the facts. What do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"If you feel that you could undertake the defence I should like you to do
  so. We shall employ the solicitors to the League, Bird &amp; Marshall, but I
  know they will be willing and glad to act with you."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "I will investigate the case and consult with
  your solicitors. By the way, do the police know about the sheet of the letter
  on which the plans were drawn?"</p>

  <p>"No. I thought it best to say nothing about that, and I have told Miss
  Dalby not to mention it."</p>

  <p>"That is just as well," said Thorndyke. "Have you the sheet with the plan
  on it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't it about me," was the reply. "It is in my desk at my
  chambers."</p>

  <p>"You had better let me have it to look at," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You can have it if you want it, of course," said Bawley, "but it won't
  help you. The letters are all alike, as I have told you."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see it, nevertheless," said Thorndyke; "and perhaps you
  could give me some account of Mr. Burnham. What do you know about him?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bawley shut his lips tightly, and his face took on an expression of
  vindictiveness verging on malignity.</p>

  <p>"All I know about Burnham," he said, "is that he was a fool and a ruffian.
  He was not only an enemy of the great reform that our League stands for; he
  was a treacherous enemy&mdash;violent, crafty, and indefatigably active. I
  can only regard his death as a blessing to mankind."</p>

  <p>"May I ask," said Thorndyke, "if any members of your League have ever
  publicly threatened to take personal measures against him?</p>

  <p>"Yes," snapped Bawley. "Several of us&mdash;including myself&mdash;have
  threatened to give him the hiding that he deserved. But a hiding is a
  different thing from murder, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed somewhat dryly; then he asked: "Do you know
  anything about Mr. Burnham's occupation and habits?"</p>

  <p>"He was a sort of manager of the London and Suburban Bank. His job was to
  supervise the suburban branches, and his habit was to visit them in rotation.
  He was probably going to the branch at Holmwood when he was killed. That is
  all I can tell you about him."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke; and as our visitor rose to depart he
  continued: "Then I will look into the case and arrange with your solicitors
  to have Miss Dalby properly represented at the inquest; and I shall be glad
  to have that sheet of the letter as soon as you can send or leave it."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Bawley, "though, as I have told you, it won't be of any
  use to you. It is only a duplicated circular."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," Thorndyke assented. "But the other sheets will be produced in
  Court, so I may as well have an opportunity of examining it beforehand."</p>

  <p>For some minutes after our client had gone Thorndyke remained silent and
  reflective, copying his rough notes into his pocket-book and apparently
  amplifying and arranging them. Presently he looked up at me with an unspoken
  question in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is a queer case," said I. "The circumstantial evidence seems to be
  strongly against Miss Dalby, but it is manifestly improbable that she
  murdered the man."</p>

  <p>"It seems so," he agreed. "But the case will be decided on the evidence;
  and the evidence will be considered by a judge, not by a Home Secretary. You
  notice the importance of Burnham's destination?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was evidently dead when the train arrived at Holmwood. But it
  isn't clear how long he had been dead."</p>

  <p>"The evidence," said Thorndyke, "points strongly to the tunnel between
  Cawden and Holmwood as the place where the murder was committed. You will
  remember that the up-express passed our train in the tunnel. If the adjoining
  compartments were empty, the sound of a pistol shot would be completely
  drowned by the noise of the express thundering past. Then you will remember
  the fragments of the electric bulb that we picked up, and that there was no
  light on in the carriage. That is rather significant. It not only suggests
  that the crime was committed in the dark, but there is a distinct suggestion
  of preparation&mdash;arrangement and premeditation. It suggests that the
  murderer knew what the circumstances would be and provided for them."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and that is rather a point against our client. But I don't quite see
  what you expect to get out of that sheet of the letter. It is the presence of
  the letter, rather than its matter, that constitutes the evidence against
  Miss Dalby."</p>

  <p>"I don't expect to learn anything from it," replied Thorndyke; "but the
  letter will be the prosecution's trump card, and it is always well to know in
  advance exactly what cards your opponent holds. It is a mere matter of
  routine to examine everything, relevant or irrelevant."</p>

  <p>The inquest was to be held at Densford on the third day after the
  discovery of the body. But in the interval certain new facts had come to
  light. One was that the deceased was conveying to the Holmwood branch of the
  bank a sum of three thousand pounds, of which one thousand was in gold and
  the remainder in Bank of England notes, the whole being contained in a
  leather handbag. This bag had been found, empty, in a ditch by the side of
  the road which led from the station to the house of Miss Carleigh, the
  Vice-President of the Women's Emancipation League. It was further stated that
  the ticket-collector at Holmwood had noticed that Miss Dalby&mdash;whom he
  knew by sight&mdash;was carrying a bag of the kind described when she passed
  the barrier, and that when she returned, about an hour later, she had no bag
  with her. On the other hand, Miss Carleigh had stated that the bag which Miss
  Dalby brought to her house was her (Miss Carleigh's) property, and she had
  produced it for the inspection of the police. So that already there was some
  conflict of evidence, with a balance distinctly against Miss Dalby.</p>

  <p>"There is no denying," said Thorndyke, as we discussed the case at the
  breakfast table on the morning of the inquestthat the circumstantial evidence
  is formidably complete and consistent, while the rebutting evidence is of the
  feeblest. Miss Dalby's statement that the letter had been put into her pocket
  by some unknown person will hardly be taken seriously, and even Miss
  Carleigh's statement with reference to the bag will not carry much weight
  unless she can furnish corroboration."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said I, "the general probabilities are entirely in favour
  of the accused. It is grossly improbable that a lady like Miss Dalby would
  commit a robbery with murder of this cold-blooded, deliberate type."</p>

  <p>"That may be," Thorndyke retorted, "but a jury has to find in accordance
  with the evidence."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "did Bawley ever send you that sheet of the letter
  that you asked for?"</p>

  <p>"No, confound him! But I have sent Polton round to get it from him, so
  that I can look it over carefully in the train. Which reminds me that I can't
  get down in time for the opening of the inquest. You had better travel with
  the solicitors and see the shorthand writers started. I shall have to come
  down by a later train."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, just as I was about to start, a familiar step was
  heard on the stair, and then our laboratory assistant, Polton, let himself in
  with his key.</p>

  <p>"Just caught him, sir, as he was starting for the station," he said, with
  a satisfied, crinkly smile, laying an envelope on the table, and added,
  "Lord! how he did swear!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled, and having thanked his assistant, opened the envelope
  and handed it to me. It contained a single sheet of letter-paper, exactly
  similar to the one that we had found in the railway carriage, excepting that
  the writing filled one side and a quarter only, and, since it concluded with
  the signature "Letitia Humboe, President," it was evidently the last sheet.
  There was no water-mark nor anything, so far as I could see, to distinguish
  it from the dozens of other impressions that had been run off on the
  duplicator with it, excepting the roughly-pencilled plan on the blank side of
  the sheet.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said as I put on my hat and walked towards the door, "I suspect
  that Bawley was right. You won't get much help from this to support Miss
  Dalby's rather improbable statement." And Thorndyke agreed that appearances
  were not very promising.</p>

  <p>The scene in the coffee-room of "The Plough" Inn at Densford was one with
  which I was familiar enough. The quiet, business-like coroner, the
  half-embarrassed jurors, the local police and witnesses and the spectators,
  penned up at one end of the room, were all well-known characters. The unusual
  feature was the handsome, distinguished-looking young lady who sat on a plain
  Windsor chair between two inscrutable policemen, watched intently by Mr.
  Cadmus Bawley. Miss Dalby was pale and obviously agitated, but quiet,
  resolute, and somewhat defiant in manner. She greeted me with a pleasant
  smile when I introduced myself, and hoped that I and my colleague would have
  no difficulty in disposing of "this grotesque and horrible accusation."</p>

  <p>I need not describe the proceedings in detail. Evidence of the identity of
  the deceased having been taken, Dr. Pooke deposed that death was due to a
  wound of the heart produced by a spherical bullet, apparently fired from a
  small, smooth-bore pistol at very short range. The wound was in his opinion
  not self-inflicted. The coroner then produced the sheet of the circular
  letter found in the carriage, and I was called to testify to the finding of
  it. The next witness was Superintendent Miller of the Criminal Investigation
  Department, who produced the two sheets of the letter which were taken from
  Miss Dalby's pocket when she was arrested. These he handed to the coroner for
  comparison with the one found in the carriage with the body of deceased.</p>

  <p>"There appear," said the coroner, after placing the three sheets together,
  "to be one or more sheets missing. The two you have handed me are sheets one
  and three, and the one found in the railway carriage is sheet two."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the witness agreed, "sheet four is missing, but I have a photograph
  of it. Here is a set of the complete letter," and he laid four unmounted
  prints on the table.</p>

  <p>The coroner examined them with a puzzled frown. "May I ask," he said, "how
  you obtained these photographs?"</p>

  <p>"They are not photographs of the copy that you have," the witness
  explained, "but of another copy of the same letter which we intercepted in
  the post. That letter was addressed to a stationer's shop to be called for.
  We have considered it necessary to keep ourselves informed of the contents of
  these circulars, so that we can take the necessary precautions; and as the
  envelopes are marked with the badge and are invariably addressed in blue ink,
  it is not difficult to identify them."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the coroner, glaring stonily at Mr. Bawley, who had
  accompanied the superintendent's statement with audible and unfavourable
  comments. "Is that the whole of your evidence? Thank you. Then, if there is
  no cross-examination, I will call the next witness. Mr. Bernard Parsons."</p>

  <p>Mr. Parsons was the general manager of the London and Suburban Bank, and
  he deposed that deceased was, on the day when be met his death, travelling to
  Holmwood to visit and inspect the new local branch of the bank, and that he
  was taking thither the sum of three thousand pounds, of which one thousand
  was in gold and the remainder in Bank of England notes&mdash;mostly
  five-pound notes. He carried the notes and specie in a strong leather
  handbag.</p>

  <p>"Can you say if either of these is the bag that he carried?" the coroner
  asked, indicating two largish, black leather bags that his officer had placed
  on the table.</p>

  <p>Mr. Parsons promptly pointed to the larger of the two, which was smeared
  externally with mud. The coroner noted the answer and then asked: "Did anyone
  besides yourself know that deceased was making this visit?"</p>

  <p>"Many persons must have known," was the reply. "Deceased visited the
  various branches in a fixed order. He came to Holmwood on the second Tuesday
  in the month."</p>

  <p>"And would it be known that he had this great sum of money with him?"</p>

  <p>"The actual amount would not be generally known, but he usually took with
  him supplies of specie and notes&mdash;sometimes very large sums&mdash;and
  this would be known to many of the bank staff, and probably to a good many
  persons outside. The Holmwood Branch consumes a good deal of specie, as most
  of the customers pay in cheques and draw out cash for local use."</p>

  <p>This was the substance of Mr. Parsons' evidence, and when he sat down the
  ticket-collector was called. That official identified Miss Dalby as one of
  the passengers by the train in which the body of deceased was found. She was
  carrying a bag when she passed the barrier. He could not identify either of
  the bags, but both were similar to the one that she was carrying. She
  returned about an hour later and caught an up-train, and he noticed that she
  was then not carrying a bag. He could not say whether any of the other
  passengers was carrying a bag. There were very few first-class passengers by
  that train, but a large number of third-class&mdash;mostly
  fruit-pickers&mdash;and they made a dense crowd at the barrier so that he did
  not notice individual passengers particularly. He noticed Miss Dalby because
  he knew her by sight, as she often came to Holmwood with other suffragist
  ladies. He did not see which carriage Miss Dalby came from, and he did not
  see any first-class compartment with an open door.</p>

  <p>The coroner noted down this evidence with thoughtful deliberation, and I
  was considering whether there were any questions that it would be advisable
  to ask the witness when I felt a light touch on my shoulder, and looking up
  perceived a constable holding out a telegram. Observing that it was addressed
  to "Dr. Jervis, Plough Inn, Densford," I nodded to the constable, and taking
  the envelope from him, opened it and unfolded the paper. The telegram was
  from Thorndyke, in the simple code that he had devised for our private use. I
  was able to decode it without referring to the key&mdash;which each of us
  always carried in his pocket&mdash;and it then read:</p>
<br>

  <p class="telegram">"I AM STARTING FOR FOLKESTONE IN RE BURNHAM DECEASED. FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY AND BRING MILLER IF YOU CAN FOR POSSIBLE ARREST. MEET ME ON PIER NEAR OSTEND BOAT. THORNDYKE."</p>
<br>

  <p>Accustomed as I was to my colleague's inveterate habit of acting in the
  least expected manner, I must confess that I gazed at the decoded message in
  absolute stupefaction. I had been totally unaware of the faintest clue beyond
  the obvious evidence to which I had been listening, and behold! here was
  Thorndyke with an entirely fresh case, apparently cut-and-dried, and the
  unsuspected criminal in the hollow of his hand. It was astounding.</p>

  <p>Unconsciously I raised my eyes&mdash;and met those of Superintendent
  Miller, fixed on me with devouring curiosity. I held up the telegram and
  beckoned, and immediately he tip-toed across and took a seat by my side. I
  laid the decoded telegram before him, and when he had glanced through it, I
  asked in a whisper: "Well, what do you say?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply, he whisked out a time-table, conned it eagerly for a few
  minutes, and then held it towards me with his thumb-nail on the words
  "Densford Junction."</p>

  <p>"There's a fast train up in seven minutes," he whispered hoarsely. "Get
  the coroner to excuse us and let your solicitors carry on for you."</p>

  <p>A brief, and rather vague, explanation secured the assent of the
  coroner&mdash;since we had both given our evidence&mdash;and the less willing
  agreement of my clients. In another minute the superintendent and I were
  heading for the station, which we reached just as the train swept up
  alongside the platform.</p>

  <p>"This is a queer start," said Miller, as the train moved out of the
  station; "but, Lord! there is never any calculating Dr. Thorndyke's moves.
  Did you know that he had anything up his sleeve?"</p>

  <p>"No; but then one never does know. He is as close as an oyster. He never
  shows his hand until he can play a trump card. But it is possible that he has
  struck a fresh clue since I left."</p>

  <p>"Well," rejoined Miller, "we shall know when we get to the other end And I
  don't mind telling you that it will be a great relief to me if we can drop
  this charge against Miss Dalby."</p>

  <p>From time to time during the journey to London, and from thence to
  Folkestone, the superintendent reverted to Thorndyke's mysterious
  proceedings. But it was useless to speculate. We had not a single fact to
  guide us; and when, at last, the train ran into Folkestone Central Station we
  were as much in the dark as when we started.</p>

  <p>Assuming that Thorndyke would have made any necessary arrangements for
  assistance from the local police, we chartered a cab and proceeded direct to
  the end of Rendez-vous Street&mdash;a curiously appropriate destination, by
  the way. Here we alighted in order that we might make our appearance at the
  meeting-place as inconspicuously as possible, and, walking towards the
  harbour, perceived Thorndyke waiting on the quay, ostensibly watching the
  loading of a barge, and putting in their case a pair of prismatic binoculars
  with which he had apparently observed our arrival.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come, Miller," he said, shaking the superintendent's
  hand. "I can't make any promises, but I have no doubt that it is a case for
  you even if it doesn't turn out all that I hope and expect. The Cornflower is
  our ship, and we had better go on board separately in case our friends are
  keeping a look-out. I have arranged matters with the captain, and the local
  superintendent has got some plain-clothes men on the pier."</p>

  <p>With this we separated. Thorndyke went on in advance, and Miller and I
  followed at a discreet interval.</p>

  <p>As I descended the gangway a minute or so after Miller, a steward
  approached me, and having asked my name requested me to follow him, when he
  conducted me to the purser's office, in which I found Thorndyke and Miller in
  conversation with the purser.</p>

  <p>"The gentlemen you are inquiring for," said the latter, "are in the
  smoking-room playing cards with another passenger. I have put a tarpaulin
  over one of the ports, in case you want to have a look at them without being
  seen."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better make a preliminary inspection, Miller," said
  Thorndyke. "You may know some of them."</p>

  <p>To this suggestion the superintendent agreed, and forthwith went off with
  the purser, leaving me and Thorndyke alone. I at once took the opportunity to
  demand an explanation. "I take it that you struck some new evidence after I
  left you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied. "And none too soon, as you see. I don't quite
  know what it will amount to, but I think we have secured the defence, at any
  rate and that is really all that we are concerned with. The positive aspects
  of the case are the business of the police. But here comes Miller, looking
  very pleased with himself, and with the purser."</p>

  <p>The superintendent, however, was not only pleased; he was also not a
  little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed, "this is a quaint affair. We have got two of the
  leading lights of the suffrage movement in there. One is Jameson, the
  secretary of the Women's Emancipation League, the other is Pinder, their
  chief bobbery-monger. Then there are two men named Dorman and Spiller, both
  of them swell crooks, I am certain, though we have never been able to fix
  anything on them. The fifth man I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said Thorndyke. "My repertoire includes only four. And now
  we will proceed to sort them out. Could we have a few words with Mr.
  Thorpe&mdash;in here, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied the purser "I'll go and fetch him." He bustled away
  in the direction of the smoking-room, whence he presently reappeared,
  accompanied by a tall, lean man who wore large bi-focal spectacles of the
  old-fashioned, split-lens type, and was smoking a cigar. As the newcomer
  approached down the alley-way, it was evident that he was nervous and uneasy,
  though he maintained a certain jaunty swagger that accorded ill with a
  pronounced, habitual stoop. As he entered the cabin, however, and became
  aware of the portentous group of strangers, the swagger broke down
  completely; suddenly his face became ashen and haggard, and he peered through
  his great spectacles from one to the others, with an expression of
  undisguisable terror.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Thorpe?" queried Thorndyke; and the superintendent murmured: "Alias
  Pinder."</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply, in a husky undertone. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke turned to the superintendent. "I charge this man," said he,
  "with having murdered Francis Burnham in the train between London and
  Holmwood."</p>

  <p>The superintendent was visibly astonished, but not more so than the
  accused, on whom Thorndyke's statement produced the most singular effect. In
  a moment, his terror seemed to drop from him; the colour returned to his
  face, the haggard expression of which gave place to one of obvious
  relief.</p>

  <p>Miller stood up, and addressing the accused, began "It is my duty to
  caution you&mdash;" but the other interrupted: "Caution your grandmother! You
  are talking a parcel of dam' nonsense. I was in Birmingham when the murder
  was committed. I can prove it, easily."</p>

  <p>The superintendent was somewhat taken aback, for the accused spoke with a
  confidence that carried conviction.</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Thorndyke, "you can probably explain how a letter
  belonging to you came to be found in the carriage with the murdered man."</p>

  <p>"Belonging to me!" exclaimed Thorpe. "What the deuce do you mean? That
  letter belonged to Miss Dalby. The rest of it was found in her pocket."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Thorndyke. "One sheet had been placed in the railway
  carriage and the remainder in Miss Dalby's pocket to fix suspicion on her.
  But it was your letter, and the inference is that you disposed of it in that
  manner for the purpose that I have stated."</p>

  <p>"But," persisted Thorpe, with visibly-growing uneasiness, "this was a
  duplicated circular. You couldn't tell one copy from another."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pinder," said Thorndyke, in an impressively quiet tone, "if I tell
  you that I ascertained from that letter that you had taken a passage on this
  ship in the name of Thorpe, you will probably understand what I mean."</p>

  <p>Apparently he did understand, for, once more, the colour faded from his
  face and he sat down heavily on a locker, fixing on Thorndyke a look of
  undisguised dismay. Thus he sat for some moments, motionless and silent,
  apparently thinking hard.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he started up. "My God!" he exclaimed, "I see now what has
  happened. The infernal scoundrel! First he put it on to Miss Dalby, and now
  he has put it on to me. Now I understand why he looked so startled when I ran
  against him."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," replied Pinder. "As I move about a good deal&mdash;and
  for other reasons&mdash;I used to have my suffrage letters sent to a
  stationer's shop in Barlow Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," interrupted the superintendent; "Bedall's. I used to look them
  over and take photographs of them." He grinned craftily as he made this
  statement, and, rather to my surprise, the accused grinned too. A little
  later I understood that grin.</p>

  <p>"Well," continued Pinder, "I used to collect these letters pretty
  regularly. But this last letter was delivered while I was away at Birmingham.
  Before I came back I met a man who gave me
  certain&mdash;er&mdash;instructions&mdash;you know what they were," he added,
  addressing Thorndyke&mdash;"so I did not need the letter. But, of course, I
  couldn't leave it there uncollected, so when I got back to London, I called
  for it. That was two days ago. To my astonishment Miss Bedall declared that I
  had collected it three days previously. I assured her that I was not in
  London on that day, but she was positive that I had called. 'I remember
  clearly,' she said, 'giving you the letter myself.' Well, there was no
  arguing. Evidently she had given the letter to the wrong person&mdash;she is
  very near-sighted, I should say, judging by the way she holds things against
  her nose&mdash;but how it happened I couldn't understand. But I think I
  understand now. There is one person only in the world who knew that I had my
  letters addressed there: a sort of pal of mine named Payne. He happened to be
  with me one evening when I called to collect my letters. Now, Payne chanced
  to be a good deal like me&mdash;at least he is tall and thin and stoops a
  bit; but he does not wear spectacles. He tried on my spectacles once for a
  joke, and then he really looked extremely like me. He looked in a mirror and
  remarked on the resemblance himself. Now, Payne did not belong to the Women's
  League, and I suggest that he took advantage of this resemblance to get
  possession of this letter. He got a pair of spectacles like mine and
  personated me at the shop."</p>

  <p>"Why should he want to get possession of that letter?" Miller
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"To plant it as he has planted it," replied Pinder, "and set the police on
  a false trail."</p>

  <p>"This sounds pretty thin," said Miller. "You are accusing this man of
  having murdered Mr. Burnham. What grounds have you for this accusation?"</p>

  <p>"My grounds," replied Pinder, "are, first, that he stole this letter which
  has been found, obviously planted; and, second, that he had a grudge against
  Burnham and knew all about his movements."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Miller, with suddenly increased interest. "Then who and
  what is this man Payne?"</p>

  <p>"Why," replied Pinder, "until a month ago, he was assistant cashier at the
  Streatham branch of the bank. Then Burnham came down and hoofed him out
  without an hour's notice. I don't know what for, but I can guess."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know where Payne is at this moment?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. He is on this ship, in the smoking-room&mdash;only he is Mr.
  Shenstone now. And mighty sick he was when he found me on board."</p>

  <p>The superintendent looked at Thorndyke. "What do you think about it,
  doctor?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that we had better have Mr. Shenstone in here
  and ask him a few questions. Would you see if you can get him to come here?"
  he added, addressing the purser, who had been listening with ecstatic
  enjoyment.</p>

  <p>"I'll get him to come along all right," replied the purser, evidently
  scenting a new act in this enthralling drama; and away he bustled, all agog.
  In less than a minute we saw him returning down the alley-way, with a tall,
  thin man, who, at a distance, was certainly a good deal like Pinder, though
  the resemblance diminished as he approached. He, too, was obviously agitated,
  and seemed to be plying the purser with questions. But when he came opposite
  the door of the cabin he stopped dead and seemed disposed to shrink back.</p>

  <p>"Is that the man?" Thorndyke demanded sharply and rather loudly, springing
  to his feet as he spoke.</p>

  <p>The effect of the question was electrical. As Thorndyke rose, the
  new-comer turned, and, violently thrusting the purser aside, raced madly down
  the alley-way and out on to the deck.</p>

  <p>"Stop that man!" roared Miller, darting out in pursuit; and at the shout a
  couple of loitering deck-hands headed the fugitive off from the gangway.
  Following, I saw the terrified man swerving this way and that across the
  littered deck to avoid the seamen, who joined in the pursuit; I saw him make
  a sudden frantic burst for a baggage-slide springing from a bollard up to the
  bulwark-rail. Then his foot must have tripped on a lashing, for he staggered
  for a moment, flung out his arms with a wild shriek, and plunged headlong
  into the space between the ship's side and the quay wall.</p>

  <p>In an instant the whole ship was in an uproar. An officer and two hands
  sprang to the rail with ropes and a boathook, while others manned the cargo
  derrick and lowered a rope with a running bowline between the ship and the
  quay.</p>

  <p>"He's gone under," a hoarse voice proclaimed from below; "but I can see
  him jammed against the side."</p>

  <p>There were a couple of minutes of sickening suspense. Then the voice from
  below was heard again. "Heave up!"</p>

  <p>The derrick-engine rattled, the taut rope came up slowly, and at length
  out of that horrid gulf arose a limp and dripping shape that, as it cleared
  the bulwark, was swung inboard and let down gently on the deck. Thorndyke and
  I stooped over him. But it was a dead man's face that we looked into; and a
  tinge of blood on the lips told the rest of the tale.</p>

  <p>"Cover him up," said the superintendent. "He's out of our jurisdiction
  now. But what's going on there?"</p>

  <p>Following his look, I perceived a small scattered crowd of men all running
  furiously along the quay towards the town. Some of them I judged to be the
  late inmates of the smoking-room and some plain-clothes men. The only figure
  that I recognised was that of Mr. Pinder, and he was already growing small in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>"The local police will have to deal with them," said Miller. Then turning
  to the purser, he asked: "What baggage had this man?"</p>

  <p>"Only two cabin trunks," was the reply. "They are both in his
  state-room."</p>

  <p>To the state-room we followed the purser, when Miller had possessed
  himself of the dead man's keys, and the two trunks were hoisted on to the
  bunk and opened. Each trunk contained a large cash-box, and each cash-box
  contained five hundred pounds in gold and a big bundle of notes. The latter
  Miller examined closely, checking their numbers by a column of entries in his
  pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he reported at length; "it's a true bill. These are the notes that
  were stolen from Mr. Burnham. And now I will have a look at the baggage of
  those other four sportsmen."</p>

  <p>This being no affair of ours, Thorndyke and I went ashore and slowly made
  our way towards the town. But presently the superintendent overtook us in
  high glee, with the news that he had discovered what appeared to be the
  accumulated "swag" of a gang of swell burglars for whom he had been for some
  months vainly on the look-out.</p>

  <p>"How was it done?" repeated Thorndyke in reply to Miller's question, as we
  sat at a retired table in the "Lord Warden" Hotel. "Well, it was really very
  simple. I am afraid I shall disappoint you if you expect anything ingenious
  and recondite. Of course, it was obvious that Miss Dalby had not committed
  this atrocious murder and robbery; and it was profoundly improbable that this
  extremely incriminating letter had been dropped accidentally. That being so,
  it was almost certain that the letter had been 'planted,' as Pinder expressed
  it. But that was a mere opinion that helped us not at all. The actual
  solution turned upon a simple chemical fact with which I happened to be
  acquainted; which is this: that all the basic coal-tar dyes, and especially
  methylene blue, dye oxycellulose without requiring a mordant, but do not
  react in this way on cellulose. Now, good paper is practically pure
  cellulose; and if you dip a sheet of such paper into certain oxidising
  liquids, such as a solution of potassium chlorate with a slight excess of
  hydrochloric acid, the paper is converted into oxycellulose. But if instead
  of immersing the paper, you write on it with a quill or glass pen dipped in
  the solution, only the part which has been touched by the pen is changed into
  oxycellulose. No change is visible to the eye: but if a sheet of paper
  written on with this colourless fluid is dipped in a solution of, say,
  methylene blue, the invisible writing immediately becomes visible. The
  oxycellulose takes up the blue dye.</p>

  <p>"Now, when I picked up that sheet of the letter in the railway carriage
  and noted that the ink used appeared to be methylene blue, this fact was
  recalled to my mind. Then, on looking at it closely, I seemed to detect a
  certain slight spottiness in the writing. There were points on some of the
  letters that were a little deeper in colour than the rest; and it occurred to
  me that it was possible that these circulars might be used to transmit secret
  messages of a less innocent kind than those that met the unaided eye, just as
  these political societies might form an excellent cover for the operations of
  criminal associations. But if the circulars had been so used, it is evident
  that the secret writing would not be on all the circulars. The prepared
  sheets would be used only for the circulars that were to be sent to
  particular persons, and in those cases the secret writing would probably be
  in the nature of a personal communication, either to a particular individual
  or to a small group. The possible presence of a secret message thus became of
  vital evidential importance; for if it could be shown that this letter was
  addressed to some person other than Miss Dalby, that would dispose of the
  only evidence connecting her with the crime.</p>

  <p>"It happened, most fortunately, that I was able to get possession of the
  final sheet of this letter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course it did," growled Miller, with a sour smile.</p>

  <p>"It reached me," continued Thorndyke, "only after Dr. Jervis had started
  for Densford. The greater part of one side was blank, excepting for a rough
  plan drawn in pencil, and this blank side I laid down on a sheet of glass and
  wetted the written side with a small wad of cotton-wool dipped in distilled
  water. Of course, the blue writing began to run and dissolve out; and then,
  very faintly, some other writing began to show through in reverse. I turned
  the paper over, and now the new writing, though faint, was quite legible, and
  became more so when I wiped the blue-stained cotton-wool over it a few times.
  A solution of methylene blue would have made it still plainer, but I used
  water only, as I judged that the blue writing was intended to furnish the dye
  for development. Here is the final result."</p>

  <p>He drew from his pocket a letter-case, from which he extracted a folded
  paper which he opened and laid on the table. It was stained a faint blue,
  through which the original writing could be seen, dim and blurred, while the
  secret message, though very pale, was quite sharp and clear. And this was the
  message:</p>

  <p>"...so although we are not actually blown on, the position is getting
  risky and it's time for us to hop. I have booked passages for the four of us
  to Ostend by the Cornflower, which sails on Friday evening next (20th). The
  names of the four illustrious passengers are, Walsh (that's me), Grubb
  (Dorman), Jenkins (Spiller) and Thorpe (that's you). Get those names well
  into your canister&mdash;better make a note of them&mdash;and turn up in good
  time on Friday."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, as he handed back the letter, "we can't know
  everything&mdash;unless we are Dr. Thorndyke. But there's one thing I do
  know."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I know why that fellow Pinder grinned when I told him that I had
  photographed his confounded letters."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4"></a>THE NATURALIST AT LAW</h2>

  <p class="first">A HUSH had fallen on the court as the coroner concluded his
  brief introductory statement and the first witness took up his position by
  the long table. The usual preliminary questions elicited that Simon Moffet,
  the witness aforesaid, was fifty-eight years of age, that he followed the
  calling of a shepherd and that he was engaged in supervising the flocks that
  fed upon the low-lying meadows adjoining the little town of Bantree in
  Buckinghamshire.</p>

  <p>"Tell us how you came to discover the body," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"'Twas on Wednesday morning, about half-past five," Moffet began. "I was
  getting the sheep through the gate into the big meadow by Reed's farm, when I
  happened to look down the dyke, and then I noticed a boot sticking up out of
  the water. Seemed to me as if there was a foot in it by the way it stuck up,
  so as soon as all the sheep was in, I shut the gate and walked down the dyke
  to have a look at un. When I got close I see the toe of another boot just
  alongside. Looks a bit queer, I thinks, but I couldn't see anything more,
  'cause the duck-weed is that thick as it looks as if you could walk on it.
  Howsever, I clears away the weed with my stick, and then I see 'twas a dead
  man. Give me a rare turn, it did. He was a-layin' at the bottom of the ditch
  with his head near the middle and his feet up close to the bank. Just then
  young Harry Walker comes along the cart-track on his way to work, so I shows
  him the body and sends him back to the town for to give notice at the police
  station."</p>

  <p>"And is that all you know about the affair?"</p>

  <p>"Ay. Later on I see the sergeant come along with a man wheelin' the
  stretcher, and I showed him where the body was and helped to pull it out and
  load it on the stretcher. And that's all I know about it."</p>

  <p>On this the witness was dismissed and his place taken by a shrewd-looking,
  business-like police sergeant, who deposed as follows:</p>

  <p>"Last Wednesday, the 8th of May, at 6.15 a.m., I received information from
  Henry Walker that a dead body was lying in the ditch by the cart-track
  leading from Ponder's Road to Reed's farm. I proceeded there forthwith,
  accompanied by Police-Constable Ketchum, and taking with us a wheeled
  stretcher. On the track I was met by the last witness, who conducted me to
  the place where the body was lying and where I found it in the position that
  he has described; but we had to clear away the duck-weed before we could see
  it distinctly. I examined the bank carefully, but could see no trace of
  footprints, as the grass grows thickly right down to the water's edge. There
  were no signs of a struggle or any disturbance on the bank. With the aid of
  Moffet and Ketchum, I drew the body out and placed it on the stretcher. I
  could not see any injuries or marks of violence on the body or anything
  unusual about it. I conveyed it to the mortuary, and with Constable Ketchum's
  assistance removed the clothing and emptied the pockets, putting the contents
  of each pocket in a separate envelope and writing the description on each. In
  a letter-case from the coat pocket were some visiting cards bearing the name
  and address of Mr. Cyrus Pedley, of 21 Hawtrey Mansions, Kensington, and a
  letter signed Wilfred Pedley, apparently from deceased's brother. Acting on
  instructions, I communicated with him and served a summons to attend this
  inquest."</p>

  <p>"With regard to the ditch in which you found the body," said the coroner,
  "can you tell us how deep it is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I measured it with Moffet's crook and a tape measure. In the deepest
  part, where the body was lying, it is four feet two inches deep. From there
  it slopes up pretty sharply to the bank."</p>

  <p>"So far as you can judge, if a grown man fell into the ditch by accident,
  would he have any difficulty in getting out?"</p>

  <p>"None at all, I should say, if he were sober and in ordinary health. A man
  of medium height, standing in the middle at the deepest part, would have his
  head and shoulders out of water; and the sides are not too steep to climb up
  easily, especially with the grass and rushes on the bank to lay hold of."</p>

  <p>"You say there were no signs of disturbance on the bank. Were there any in
  the ditch itself?</p>

  <p>"None that I could see. But, of course, signs of disturbance soon
  disappear in water. The duck-weed drifts about as the wind drives it, and
  there are creatures moving about on the bottom. I noticed that deceased had
  some weed grasped in one hand."</p>

  <p>This concluded the sergeant's evidence, and as he retired, the name of Dr.
  Albert Parton was called. The new witness was a young man of grave and
  professional aspect, who gave his evidence with an extreme regard for
  clearness and accuracy.</p>

  <p>"I have made an examination of the body of the deceased," he began, after
  the usual preliminaries. "It is that of a healthy man of about forty-five. I
  first saw it about two hours after it was found. It had then been dead from
  twelve to fifteen hours. Later I made a complete examination. I found no
  injuries, marks of violence or any definite bruises, and no signs of
  disease."</p>

  <p>"Did you ascertain the cause of death?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The cause of death was drowning."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure. The lungs contained a quantity of water and duck-weed, and
  there was more than a quart of water mixed with duck-weed and water-weed in
  the stomach. That is a clear proof of death by drowning. The water in the
  lungs was the immediate cause of death, by making breathing impossible, and
  as the water and weed in the stomach must have been swallowed, they furnish
  conclusive evidence that deceased was alive when he fell into the water."</p>

  <p>"The water and weed could not have got into the stomach after death?</p>

  <p>"No, that is quite impossible. They must have been swallowed when the head
  of the deceased was just below the surface; and the water must have been
  drawn into the lungs by spasmodic efforts to breathe when the mouth was under
  water."</p>

  <p>"Did you find any signs indicating that deceased might have been
  intoxicated?"</p>

  <p>"No. I examined the water from the stomach very carefully with that
  question in view, but there was no trace of alcohol&mdash;or, indeed, of
  anything else. It was simple ditch-water. As the point is important I have
  preserved it, and&mdash;" here the witness produced a paper parcel which he
  unfastened, revealing a large glass jar containing about a quart of water
  plentifully sprinkled with duck-weed. This he presented to the coroner, who
  waved it away hastily and indicated the jury; to whom it was then offered and
  summarily rejected with emphatic head-shakes. Finally it came to rest on the
  table by the place where I was sitting with my colleague, Dr. Thorndyke, and
  our client, Mr. Wilfred Pedley. I glanced at it with faint interest, noting
  how the duck-weed plants had risen to the surface and floated, each with its
  tassel of roots hanging down into the water, and how a couple of tiny, flat
  shells, like miniature ammonites, had sunk and lay on the bottom of the jar.
  Thorndyke also glanced at it; indeed, he did more than glance, for he drew
  the jar towards him and examined its contents in the systematic way in which
  it was his habit to examine everything. Meanwhile the coroner asked: "Did you
  find anything abnormal or unusual, or anything that could throw light on how
  deceased came to be in the water?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," was the reply. "I found simply that deceased met his
  death by drowning."</p>

  <p>Here, as the witness seemed to have finished his evidence, Thorndyke
  interposed.</p>

  <p>"The witness states, sir, there were no definite bruises. Does he mean
  that there were any marks that might have been bruises?"</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at Dr. Parton, who replied: "There was a faint mark on
  the outside of the right arm, just above the elbow, which had somewhat the
  appearance of a bruise, as if the deceased had been struck with a stick. But
  it was very indistinct. I shouldn't like to swear that it was a bruise at
  all."</p>

  <p>This concluded the doctor's evidence, and when he had retired, the name of
  our client, Wilfred Pedley, was called. He rose, and having taken the oath
  and given his name and address, deposed: "I have viewed the body of deceased.
  It is that of my brother, Cyrus Pedley, who is forty-three years of age. The
  last time I saw deceased alive was on Tuesday morning, the day before the
  body was found."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice anything unusual in his manner or state of mind?"</p>

  <p>The witness hesitated but at length replied: "Yes. He seemed anxious and
  depressed. He had been in low spirits for some time past, but on this
  occasion he seemed more so than usual."</p>

  <p>"Had you any reason to suspect that he might contemplate taking his
  life?"</p>

  <p>"No," the witness replied, emphatically, "and I do not believe that he
  would, under any circumstances, have contemplated suicide."</p>

  <p>"Have you any special reason for that belief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Deceased was a highly conscientious man and he was in my debt. He
  had occasion to borrow two thousand pounds from me, and the debt was secured
  by an insurance on his life. If he had committed suicide that insurance would
  be invalidated and the debt would remain unpaid. From my knowledge of him, I
  feel certain that he would not have done such a thing."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded gravely, and then asked: "What was deceased's
  occupation?"</p>

  <p>"He was employed in some way by the Foreign Office, I don't know in what
  capacity. I know very little about his affairs."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if he had any money worries or any troubles or embarrassments
  of any kind?"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard of any; but deceased was a very reticent man. He lived
  alone in his flat, taking his meals at his club, and no one knew&mdash;at
  least, I did not&mdash;how he spent his time or what was the state of his
  finances. He was not married, and I am his only near relative."</p>

  <p>"And as to deceased's habits. Was he ever addicted to taking more
  stimulants than was good for him?"</p>

  <p>"Never," the witness replied emphatically. "He was a most temperate and
  abstemious man."</p>

  <p>"Was he subject to fits of any kind, or fainting attacks?"</p>

  <p>"I have never heard that he was."</p>

  <p>"Can you account for his being in this solitary place at this
  time&mdash;apparently about eight o'clock at night?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot. It is a complete mystery to me. I know of no one with whom
  either of us was acquainted in this district. I had never heard of the place
  until I got the summons to the inquest."</p>

  <p>This was the sum of our client's evidence, and, so far, things did not
  look very favourable from our point of view&mdash;we were retained on the
  insurance question, to rebut, if possible, the suggestion of suicide.
  However, the coroner was a discreet man, and having regard to the obscurity
  of the case&mdash;and perhaps to the interests involved&mdash;summed up in
  favour of an open verdict; and the jury, taking a similar view, found that
  deceased met his death by drowning, but under what circumstances there was no
  evidence to show.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, as the court rose, "that leaves it to the insurance people
  to make out a case of suicide if they can. I think you are fairly safe, Mr.
  Pedley. There is no positive evidence."</p>

  <p>"No," our client replied. "But it isn't only the money I am thinking of.
  It would be some consolation to me for the loss of my poor brother if I had
  some idea how he met with his death, and could feel sure that it was an
  unavoidable misadventure. And for my own satisfaction&mdash;leaving the
  insurance out of the question&mdash;I should like to have definite proof that
  it was not suicide."</p>

  <p>He looked half-questioningly at Thorndyke, who nodded gravely. "Yes," the
  latter agreed, "the suggestion of suicide ought to be disposed of if
  possible, both for legal and sentimental reasons. How far away is the
  mortuary?"</p>

  <p>"A couple of minutes' walk," replied Mr. Pedley. "Did you wish to inspect
  the body?"</p>

  <p>"If it is permissible," replied Thorndyke; "and then I propose to have a
  look at the place where the body was found."</p>

  <p>"In that case," our client said, "I will go down to the Station Hotel and
  wait for you. We may as well travel up to town together, and you can then
  tell me if you have seen any further light on the mystery."</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, Dr. Parton advanced, tying the string of the
  parcel which once more enclosed the jar of ditch-water.</p>

  <p>"I heard you say, sir, that you would like to inspect the body," said he.
  "If you like, I will show you the way to the mortuary. The sergeant will let
  us in, won't you, sergeant? This gentleman is a doctor as well as a
  lawyer."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, sir," said the sergeant, "I know who Dr. Thorndyke is, and I
  shall feel it an honour to show him anything he wishes to see."</p>

  <p>Accordingly we set forth together, Dr. Parton and Thorndyke leading the
  way.</p>

  <p>"The coroner and the jury didn't seem to appreciate my exhibit," the
  former remarked with a faint grin, tapping the parcel as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed; "and it is hardly reason able to expect a layman
  to share our own matter-of-fact outlook. But you were quite right to produce
  the specimen. That ditch-water furnishes conclusive evidence on a vitally
  material question. Further, I would advise you to preserve that jar for the
  present, well covered and under lock and key."</p>

  <p>Parton looked surprised. "Why?" he asked. "The inquest is over and the
  verdict pronounced."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it was an open verdict, and an open verdict leaves the case in
  the air. The inquest has thrown no light on the question as to how Cyrus
  Pedley came by his death."</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to me much mystery about it," said the doctor. "Here
  is a man found drowned in a shallow ditch which he could easily have got out
  of if he had fallen in by accident. He was not drunk. Apparently he was not
  in a fit of any kind. There are no marks of violence and no signs of a
  struggle, and the man is known to have been in an extremely depressed state
  of mind. It looks like a clear case of suicide, though I admit that the jury
  were quite right, in the absence of direct evidence."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "it will be my duty to contest that view if the
  insurance company dispute the claim on those grounds."</p>

  <p>"I can't think what you will have to offer in answer to the suggestion of
  suicide," said Parton.</p>

  <p>"Neither can I, at present," replied Thorndyke. "But the case doesn't look
  to me quite so simple as it does to you."</p>

  <p>"You think it possible that an analysis of the contents of this jar may be
  called for?"</p>

  <p>"That is a possibility," replied Thorndyke. "But I mean that the case is
  obscure, and that some further inquiry into the circumstances of this man's
  death is by no means unlikely."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Parton, "I will certainly follow your advice and lock up this
  precious jar. But here we are at the mortuary. Is there anything in
  particular that you want to see?"</p>

  <p>"I want to see all that there is to see," Thorndyke replied. "The evidence
  has been vague enough so far. Shall we begin with that bruise or mark that
  you mentioned?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Parton advanced to the grim, shrouded figure that lay on the
  slate-topped table, like some solemn effigy on an altar tomb, and drew back
  the sheet that covered it. We all approached, stepping softly, and stood
  beside the table, looking down with a certain awesome curiosity at the still,
  waxen figure that, but a few hours since, had been a living man like
  ourselves. The body was that of a good-looking, middle-aged man with a
  refined, intelligent face&mdash;slightly disfigured by a scar on the
  cheek&mdash;now set in the calm, reposeful expression that one so usually
  finds on the faces of the drowned; with drowsy, half-closed eyes and slightly
  parted lips that revealed a considerable gap in the upper front teeth.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke stood awhile looking down on the dead man with a curious
  questioning expression. Then his eye travelled over the body, from the placid
  face to the marble-like torso and the hand which, though now relaxed, still
  lightly grasped a tuft of water-weed. The latter Thorndyke gently disengaged
  from the limp hand, and, after a glance at the dark green, feathery fronds,
  laid it down and stooped to examine the right arm at the spot above the elbow
  that Parton had spoken of.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I think I should call it a bruise, though it is very
  faint. As you say, it might have been produced by a blow with a stick or rod.
  I notice that there are some teeth missing. Presumably he wore a plate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Parton; "a smallish gold plate with four teeth on
  it&mdash;at least, so his brother told me. Of course, it fell out when he was
  in the water, but it hasn't been found; in fact, it hasn't been looked
  for."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded and then turned to the sergeant. "Could I see what you
  found in the pockets?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The sergeant complied readily, and my colleague watched his orderly
  procedure with evident approval. The collection of envelopes was produced
  from an attach-case and conveyed to a side table, where the sergeant emptied
  out the contents of each into a little heap, opposite which he placed the
  appropriate envelope with its written description. Thorndyke ran his eye over
  the collection&mdash;which was commonplace enough&mdash;until he came to the
  tobacco pouch, from which protruded the corner of a scrap of crumpled paper.
  This he drew forth and smoothed out the creases, when it was seen to be a
  railway receipt for an excess fare.</p>

  <p>"Seems to have lost his ticket or travelled without one," the sergeant
  remarked. "But not on this line."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Thorndyke. "It is the Tilbury and Southend line. But you
  notice the date. It is the 18th; and the body was found on the morning of
  Wednesday, the 19th. So it would appear that he must have come into this
  neighbourhood in the evening; and that he must have come either by way of
  London or by a very complicated cross-country route. I wonder what brought
  him here."</p>

  <p>He produced his notebook and was beginning to copy the receipt when the
  sergeant said: "You had better take the paper, sir. It is of no use to us
  now, and it isn't very easy to make out."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke thanked the officer, and, handing me the paper, asked: "What do
  you make of it, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I scrutinised the little crumpled scrap and deciphered with difficulty the
  hurried scrawl, scribbled with a hard, ill-sharpened pencil.</p>

  <p>"It seems to read 'Ldn to C.B'. or 'S.B', 'Hlt'&mdash;that is some 'Halt,'
  I presume. But the amount, 4/9, is clear enough, and that will give us a clue
  if we want one." I returned the paper to Thorndyke, who bestowed it in his
  pocket-book and then remarked: "I don't see any keys."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied the sergeant, "there aren't any. Rather queer, that,
  for he must have had at least a latch key. They must have fallen out into the
  water."</p>

  <p>"That is possible," said Thorndyke, "but it would be worth while to make
  sure. Is there anyone who could show us the place where the body was
  found?"</p>

  <p>"I will walk up there with you myself, sir, with pleasure," said the
  sergeant, hastily repacking the envelopes. "It is only a quarter of an hour's
  walk from here."</p>

  <p>"That is very good of you, sergeant," my colleague responded; "and as we
  seem to have seen everything here, I propose that we start at once. You are
  not coming with us, Parton?"</p>

  <p>"No," the doctor replied. "I have finished with the case and I have got my
  work to do." He shook hands with us heartily and watched us&mdash;with some
  curiosity, I think&mdash;as we set forth in company with the sergeant.</p>

  <p>His curiosity did not seem to me to be unjustified. In fact, I shared it.
  The presence of the police officer precluded discussion, but as we took our
  way out of the town I found myself speculating curiously on my colleague's
  proceedings. To me, suicide was written plainly on every detail of the case.
  Of course, we did not wish to take that view, but what other was possible?
  Had Thorndyke some alternative theory? Or was he merely, according to his
  invariable custom, making an impartial survey of everything, no matter how
  apparently trivial, in the hope of lighting on some new and informative
  fact?</p>

  <p>The temporary absence of the sergeant, who had stopped to speak to a
  constable on duty, enabled me to put the question: "Is this expedition
  intended to clear up anything in particular?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "excepting the keys, which ought to be found. But you
  must see for yourself that this is not a straightforward case. That man did
  not come all this way merely to drown himself in a ditch. I am quite in the
  dark at present, so there is nothing for it but to examine everything with
  our own eyes and see if there is anything that has been overlooked that may
  throw some light on either the motive or the circumstances. It is always
  desirable to examine the scene of a crime or a tragedy."</p>

  <p>Here the return of the sergeant put a stop to the discussion and we
  proceeded on our way in silence. Already we had passed out of the town, and
  we now turned out of the main road into a lane or by-road, bordered by
  meadows and orchards and enclosed by rather high hedgerows.</p>

  <p>"This is Ponder's Road," said the sergeant. "It leads to Renham, a couple
  of miles farther on, where it joins the Aylesbury Road. The cart track is on
  the left a little way along."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later we came to our turning, a narrow and rather muddy
  lane, the entrance to which was shaded by a grove of tall elms. Passing
  through this shady avenue, we came out on a grass-covered track, broken by
  deep wagon-ruts and bordered on each side by a ditch, beyond which was a wide
  expanse of marshy meadows.</p>

  <p>"This is the place," said the sergeant, halting by the side of the
  right-hand ditch and indicating a spot where the rushes had been flattened
  down. "It was just as you see it now, only the feet were just visible
  sticking out of the duck-weed, which had drifted back after Moffet had
  disturbed it."</p>

  <p>We stood awhile looking at the ditch, with its thick mantle of bright
  green, spotted with innumerable small dark objects and showing here and there
  a faint track where a water-vole had swum across.</p>

  <p>"Those little dark objects are water-snails, I suppose," said I, by way of
  making some kind of remark.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke; "the common Amber shell, I think&mdash;Succinea
  putris." He reached out his stick and fished up a sample of the duck-weed, on
  which one or two of the snails were crawling. "Yes," he repeated. "Succinea
  putris it is; a queer little left handed shell, with the spire, as you see,
  all lop-sided. They have a habit of swarming in this extraordinary way. You
  notice that the ditch is covered with them."</p>

  <p>I had already observed this, but it hardly seemed to be worth commenting
  on under the present circumstances&mdash;which was apparently the sergeant's
  view also, for he looked at Thorndyke with some surprise, which developed
  into impatience when my colleague proceeded further to expand on the subject
  of natural history.</p>

  <p>"These water-weeds," he observed, "are very remarkable plants in their
  various ways. Look at this duck-weed, for instance. Just a little green oval
  disc with a single root hanging down into the water, like a tiny umbrella
  with a long handle; and yet it is a complete plant, and a flowering plant,
  too." He picked a specimen off the end of his stick and held it up by its
  root to exhibit its umbrella-like form; and as he did so, he looked in my
  face with an expression that I felt to be somehow significant; but of which I
  could not extract the meaning. But there was no difficulty in interpreting
  the expression on the sergeant's face. He had come here on business and be
  wanted to "cut the cackle and get to the hosses."</p>

  <p>"Well, sergeant," said Thorndyke, "there isn't much to see, but I think we
  ought to have a look for those keys. He must have had keys of some kind, if
  only a latchkey; and they must be in this ditch."</p>

  <p>The sergeant was not enthusiastic. "I've no doubt you are right, sir,"
  said he; "but I don't see that we should be much forrader if we found them.
  However, we may as well have a look, only I can't stay more than a few
  minutes. I've got my work to do at the station."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "let us get to work at once. We had better hook
  out the weed and look it over; and if the keys are not in that, we must try
  to expose the bottom where the body was lying. You must tell us if we are
  working in the right place."</p>

  <p>With this he began, with the crooked handle of his stick, to rake up the
  tangle of weed that covered the bottom of the ditch and drag the detached
  masses ashore, piling them on the bank and carefully looking them through to
  see if the keys should chance to be entangled in their meshes. In this work I
  took my part under the sergeant's direction, raking in load after load of the
  delicate, stringy weed, on the pale green ribbon-like leaves of which
  multitudes of the water-snails were creeping; and sorting over each batch in
  hopeless and fruitless search for the missing keys. In about ten minutes we
  had removed the entire weedy covering from the bottom of the ditch over an
  area of from eight to nine feet&mdash;the place which, according to the
  sergeant, the body had occupied; and as the duck-weed had been caught by the
  tangled masses of water-weed that we had dragged ashore, we now had an
  uninterrupted view of the cleared space save for the clouds of mud that we
  had stirred up.</p>

  <p>"We must give the mud a few minutes to settle," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the sergeant agreed, "it will take some time; and as it doesn't
  really concern me now that the inquest is over, I think I will get back to
  the station if you will excuse me."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke excused him very willingly, I think, though politely and with
  many thanks for his help. When he had gone I remarked, "I am inclined to
  agree with the sergeant. If we find the keys we shan't be much forrader."</p>

  <p>"We shall know that he had them with him," he replied. "Though, of course,
  if we don't find them, that will not prove that they are not here. Still, I
  think we should try to settle the question."</p>

  <p>His answer left me quite unconvinced; but the care with which he searched
  the ditch and sorted out the weed left me in no doubt that, to him, the
  matter seemed to be of some importance. However, nothing came of the search.
  If the keys were there they were buried in the mud, and eventually we had to
  give up the search and make our way back towards the station.</p>

  <p>As we passed out of the lane into Ponder's Road, Thorndyke stopped at the
  entrance, under the trees, by a little triangle of turf which marked the
  beginning of the lane, and looked down at the muddy ground.</p>

  <p>"Here is quite an interesting thing, Jervis," he remarked, "which shows us
  how standardised objects tend to develop an individual character. These are
  the tracks of a car, or more probably a tradesman's van, which was fitted
  with Barlow tyres. Now there must be thousands of vans fitted with these
  tyres; they are the favourite type for light covered vans, and when new they
  are all alike and indistinguishable. Yet this tyre&mdash;of the off hind
  wheel&mdash;has acquired a character which would enable one to pick it out
  with certainty from ten thousand others. First, you see, there is a deep cut
  in the tyre at an angle of forty-five, then a kidney-shaped 'Blakey' has
  stuck in the outer tyre without puncturing the inner; and finally some
  adhesive object&mdash;perhaps a lump of pitch from a newly-mended
  road&mdash;has become fixed on just behind the 'Blakey.' Now, if we make a
  rough sketch of those three marks and indicate their distance apart,
  thus"&mdash;here he made a rapid sketch in his notebook, and wrote in the
  intervals in inches&mdash;"we have the means of swearing to the identity of a
  vehicle which we have never seen."</p>

  <p>"And which," I added, "had for some reason swerved over to the wrong side
  of the road. Yes, I should say that tyre is certainly unique. But surely most
  tyres are identifiable when they have been in use for some time."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he replied. "That was my point. The standardised thing is
  devoid of character only when it is new."</p>

  <p>It was not a very subtle point, and as it was fairly obvious I made no
  comment, but presently reverted to the case of Pedley deceased.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see why you are taking all this trouble. The insurance
  claim is not likely to be contested. No one can prove that it was a case of
  suicide, though I should think no one will feel any doubt that it was, at
  least that is my own feeling."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me with an expression of reproach.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that my learned friend has not been making very good use of
  his eyes," said he. "He has allowed his attention to be distracted by
  superficial appearances."</p>

  <p>"You don't think that it was suicide, then?" I asked, considerably taken
  aback.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of thinking," he replied. "It was certainly not
  suicide. There are the plainest indications of homicide; and, of course, in
  the particular circumstances, homicide means murder."</p>

  <p>I was thunderstruck. In my own mind I had dismissed the case somewhat
  contemptuously as a mere commonplace suicide. As my friend had truly said, I
  had accepted the obvious appearances and let them mislead me, whereas
  Thorndyke had followed his golden rule of accepting nothing and observing
  everything. But what was it that he had observed? I knew that it was useless
  to ask, but still I ventured on a tentative question.</p>

  <p>"When did you come to the conclusion that it was a case of homicide?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as I had had a good look at the place where the body was found,"
  he replied promptly.</p>

  <p>This did not help me much, for I had given very little attention to
  anything but the search for the keys. The absence of those keys was, of
  course, a suspicious fact, if it was a fact. But we had not proved their
  absence; we had only failed to find them.</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do next?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Evidently," he answered, "there are two things to be done. One is to test
  the murder theory&mdash;to look for more evidence for or against it; the
  other is to identify the murderer, if possible. But really the two problems
  are one, since they involve the questions Who had a motive for killing Cyrus
  Pedley? and Who had the opportunity and the means?"</p>

  <p>Our discussion brought us to the station, where, outside the hotel, we
  found Mr. Pedley waiting for us.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come," said he. "I was beginning to fear that we
  should lose this train. I suppose there is no new light on this mysterious
  affair?"</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied. "Rather there is a new problem. No keys were
  found in your brother's pockets, and we have failed to find them in the
  ditch; though, of course, they may be there."</p>

  <p>"They must be," said Pedley. "They must have fallen out of his pocket and
  got buried in the mud, unless he lost them previously, which is most
  unlikely. It is a pity, though. We shall have to break open his cabinets and
  drawers, which he would have hated. He was very fastidious about his
  furniture."</p>

  <p>"You will have to break into his flat, too," said I.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I shan't have to do that. I have a duplicate of his
  latchkey. He had a spare bedroom which he let me use if I wanted to stay in
  town." As he spoke, he produced his key-bunch and exhibited a small Chubb
  latchkey. "I wish we had the others, though," he added.</p>

  <p>Here the up-train was heard approaching and we hurried on to the platform,
  selecting an empty first-class compartment as it drew up. As soon as the
  train had started, Thorndyke began his inquiries, to which I listened
  attentively.</p>

  <p>"You said that your brother had been anxious and depressed lately. Was
  there anything more than this? Any nervousness or foreboding?"</p>

  <p>"Well yes," replied Pedley. "Looking back, I seem to see that the
  possibility of death was in his mind. A week or two ago he brought his will
  to me to see if it was quite satisfactory to me as the principal beneficiary
  and he handed to me his last receipt for the insurance premium. That looks a
  little suggestive."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed. "And as to his occupation and his associates,
  what do you know about them?"</p>

  <p>"His private friends are mostly my own, but of his official associates I
  know nothing. He was connected with the Foreign Office; but in what capacity
  I don't know at all. He was extremely reticent on the subject. I only know
  that he travelled about a good deal, presumably on official business."</p>

  <p>This was not very illuminating, but it was all our client had to tell; and
  the conversation languished somewhat until the train drew up at Marylebone,
  when Thorndyke said, as if by an after-thought: "You have your brother's
  latchkey. How would it be if we just took a glance at the flat? Have you time
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I will make time," was the reply, "if you want to see the flat. I don't
  see what you could learn from inspecting it; but that is your affair. I am in
  your hands."</p>

  <p>"I should like to look round the rooms," Thorndyke answered; and as our
  client assented, we approached a taxi-cab and entered while Pedley gave the
  driver the necessary directions. A quarter of an hour later we drew up
  opposite a tall block of buildings, and Mr. Pedley, having paid off the cab,
  led the way to the lift.</p>

  <p>The dead man's flat was on the third floor, and, like the others, was
  distinguished only by the number on the door. Mr. Pedley inserted the key
  into the latch, and having opened the door, preceded us across the small
  lobby into the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, as he entered, "this solves your problem." As he
  spoke, he pointed to the table, on which lay a small bunch of keys, including
  a latch key similar to the one that he had shown us. "But," he continued, "it
  is rather extraordinary. It just shows what a very disturbed state his mind
  must have been in."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, looking critically about the room; "and as the
  latchkey is there, it raises the question whether the keys may have been out
  of his possession. Do you know what the various locked receptacles
  contain?"</p>

  <p>"I know pretty well what is in the bureau; but as to the cupboard above
  it, I have never seen it open and don't know what he kept in it. I always
  assumed that he reserved it for his official papers. I will just see if
  anything seems to have been disturbed."</p>

  <p>He unlocked and opened the flap of the old-fashioned bureau and pulled out
  the small drawers one after the other, examining the contents of each. Then
  he opened each of the larger drawers and turned over the various articles in
  them. As he closed the last one, he reported "Everything seems to be in
  order&mdash;cheque-book, insurance policy, a few share certificates, and so
  on. Nothing seems to have been touched. Now we will try the cupboard, though
  I don't suppose its contents would be of much interest to anyone but himself.
  I wonder which is the key."</p>

  <p>He looked at the keyhole and made a selection from the bunch, but it was
  evidently the wrong key. He tried another and yet another with a like result,
  until he had exhausted the resources of the bunch.</p>

  <p>"It is very remarkable," he said. "None of these keys seems to fit. I
  wonder if he kept this particular key locked up or hidden. It wasn't in the
  bureau. Will you try what you can do?"</p>

  <p>He handed the bunch to Thorndyke, who tried all the keys in succession
  with the same result. None of them was the key belonging to the lock. At
  length, having tried them all, he inserted one and turned it as far as it
  would go. Then he gave a sharp pull; and immediately the door came open.</p>

  <p>"Why, it was unlocked after all!" exclaimed Mr. Pedley. "And there is
  nothing in it. That is why there was no key on the bunch. Apparently he
  didn't use the cupboard."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked critically at the single vacant shelf, drawing his finger
  along it in two places and inspecting his finger-tips. Then he turned his
  attention to the lock, which was of the kind that is screwed on the inside of
  the door, leaving the bolt partly exposed. He took the bolt in his fingers
  and pushed it out and then in again; and by the way it moved I could see that
  the spring was broken. On this he made no comment, but remarked, "The
  cupboard has been in use pretty lately. You can see the trace of a largish
  volume&mdash;possibly a box-file&mdash;on the shelf. There is hardly any dust
  there whereas the rest of the shelf is fairly thickly coated However, that
  does not carry us very far; and the appearance of the rooms is otherwise
  quite normal."</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Pedley. "But why shouldn't it be? You didn't
  suspect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was merely testing the suggestion offered by the absence of the keys,"
  said Thorndyke. "By the way, have you communicated with the Foreign
  Office?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply, "but I suppose I ought to. What had I better say to
  them?"</p>

  <p>"I should merely state the facts in the first instance. But you can, if
  you like, say that I definitely reject the idea of suicide."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you say that," said Pedley. "Can I give any reasons for
  your opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the first place," replied Thorndyke. "I will consider the case and
  let you have a reasoned report in a day or two, which you can show to the
  Foreign Office and also to the insurance company."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pedley looked as if he would have liked to ask some further questions,
  but as Thorndyke now made his way to the door, he followed in silence,
  pocketing the keys as we went out. He accompanied us down to the entry and
  there we left him, setting forth in the direction of South Kensington
  Station.</p>

  <p>"It looked to me," said I, as soon as we were out of ear-shot, "as if that
  lock had been forced. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered, "locks get broken in ordinary use, but taking all the
  facts together, I think you are right. There are too many coincidences for
  reasonable probability. First, this man leaves his keys, including his
  latchkey, on the table, which is an extraordinary thing to do. On that very
  occasion, he is found dead under inexplicable circumstances. Then, of all the
  locks in his rooms, the one which happens to be broken is the one of which
  the key is not on the bunch. That is a very suspicious group of facts."</p>

  <p>"It is," I agreed. "And if there is, as you say&mdash;though I can't
  imagine on what grounds&mdash;evidence of foul play, that makes it still more
  suspicious. But what is the next move? Have you anything in view?"</p>

  <p>"The next move," he replied, "is to clear up the mystery of the dead man's
  movements on the day of his death. The railway receipt shows that on that day
  be travelled down somewhere into Essex. From that place, he took a long,
  cross-country journey of which the destination was a ditch by a lonely meadow
  in Buckinghamshire. The questions that we have to answer are, What was he
  doing in Essex? Why did he make that strange journey? Did he make it alone?
  and, if not, Who accompanied him?</p>

  <p>"Now, obviously, the first thing to do is to locate that place in Essex;
  and when we have done that, to go down there and see if we can pick up any
  traces of the dead man."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a pretty vague quest," said I; "but if we fail, the
  police may be able to find out something. By the way, we want a new
  Bradshaw."</p>

  <p>"An excellent suggestion, Jervis," said he. "I will get one as we go into
  the station."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, as we sat on a bench waiting for our train, he passed
  to me the open copy of Bradshaw, with the crumpled railway receipt.</p>

  <p>"You see," said he, "it was apparently 'G.B.Hlt.,' and the fare from
  London was four and ninepence. Here is Great Buntingfield Halt, the fare to
  which is four and ninepence. That must be the place. At any rate, we will
  give it a trial. May I take it that you are coming to lend a hand? I shall
  start in good time to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>I assented emphatically. Never had I been more completely in the dark than
  I was in this case, and seldom had I known Thorndyke to be more positive and
  confident. Obviously, he had something up his sleeve; and I was racked with
  curiosity as to what that something was.</p>

  <p>On the following morning we made a fairly early start, and half-past ten
  found us seated in the train, looking out across a dreary waste of marshes,
  with the estuary of the Thames a mile or so distant. For the first time in my
  recollection Thorndyke had come unprovided with his inevitable "research
  case," but I noted that he had furnished himself with a botanist's
  vasculum&mdash;or tin collecting-case&mdash;and that his pocket bulged as if
  he had some other appliances concealed about his person. Also that he carried
  a walking-stick that was strange to me.</p>

  <p>"This will be our destination, I think," he said, as the train slowed
  down; and sure enough it presently came to rest beside a little makeshift
  platform on which was displayed the name "Great Buntingfield Halt." We were
  the only passengers to alight, and the guard, having noted the fact, blew his
  whistle and dismissed the little station with a contemptuous wave of his
  flag.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke lingered on the platform after the train had gone, taking a
  general survey of the country. Half a mile away to the north a small village
  was visible; while to the south the marshes stretched away to the river,
  their bare expanse unbroken save by a solitary building whose unredeemed
  hideousness proclaimed it a factory of some kind. Presently the
  station-master approached deferentially, and as we proffered our tickets,
  Thorndyke remarked: "You don't seem overburdened with traffic here."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. You're right," was the emphatic reply. "'Tis a dead-alive place.
  Excepting the people at the Golomite Works and one now and then from the
  village, no one uses the halt. You're the first strangers I've seen for more
  than a month."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Thorndyke. "But I think you are forgetting one. An
  acquaintance of mine came here last Tuesday&mdash;and by the same token, he
  hadn't got a ticket and had to pay his fare."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember," the station-master replied. "You mean a gentleman with a
  scar on his cheek. But I don't count him as a stranger. He has been here
  before; I think he is connected with the works, as he always goes up their
  road."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to remember what time he came back?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"He didn't come back at all," was the reply. "I am sure of that, because I
  work the halt and level crossing by myself. I remember thinking it queer that
  he didn't come back, because the ticket that he had lost was a return. He
  must have gone back in the van belonging to the works&mdash;that one that you
  see coming towards the crossing."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed to a van that was approaching down the factory
  road&mdash;a small covered van with the name "Golomite Works" painted, not on
  the cover, but on a board that was attached to it. The station-master walked
  towards the crossing to open the gates, and we followed; and when the van had
  passed, Thorndyke wished our friend "Good morning," and led the way along the
  road, looking about him with lively interest and rather with the air of one
  looking for something in particular.</p>

  <p>We had covered about two-thirds of the distance to the factory when the
  road approached a wide ditch; and from the attention with which my friend
  regarded it, I suspected that this was the something for which he had been
  looking. It was, however, quite unapproachable, for it was bordered by a wide
  expanse of soft mud thickly covered with rushes and trodden deeply by cattle.
  Nevertheless, Thorndyke followed its margin, still looking about him keenly,
  until, about a couple of hundred yards from the factory, I observed a small
  decayed wooden staging or quay, apparently the remains of a vanished
  footbridge. Here Thorndyke halted and unbuttoning his coat, began to empty
  out his pockets, producing first the vasculum, then a small case containing
  three wide-mouthed bottles&mdash;both of which he deposited on the
  ground&mdash;and finally a sort of miniature landing-net, which he proceeded
  to screw on to the ferrule of his stick.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said I, "that these proceedings are a blind to cover some
  sort of observations."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he replied. "We are engaged in the study of pond and ditch
  natural history, and a most fascinating and instructive study it is. The
  variety of forms is endless. This ditch, you observe, like the one at
  Bantree, is covered with a dense growth of duck-weed: but whereas that ditch
  was swarming with succinea here there is not a single succinea to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>I grunted a sulky assent, and watched suspiciously as he filled the
  bottles with water from the ditch and then made a preliminary sweep with his
  net.</p>

  <p>"Here is a trial sample," said he, holding the loaded net towards me.
  "Duck-weed, horn-weed, Planorbis nautileus, but no succinea. What do you
  think of it, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I looked distastefully at the repulsive mess, but yet with attention, for
  I realised that there was a meaning in his question. And then, suddenly, my
  attention sharpened. I picked out of the net a strand of dark green, plumy
  weed and examined it. "So this is horn-weed," I said. "Then it was a piece of
  horn-weed that Cyrus Pedley held grasped in his hand; and now I come to think
  of it, I don't remember seeing any horn-weed in the ditch at Bantree."</p>

  <p>He nodded approvingly. "There wasn't any," said he.</p>

  <p>"And these little ammonite-like shells are just like those that I noticed
  at the bottom of Dr. Parton's jar. But I don't remember seeing any in the
  Bantree ditch."</p>

  <p>"There were none there," said he. "And the duck-weed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," I replied, "duck-weed is duck-weed, and there's an end of
  it."</p>

  <p>He chuckled aloud at my answer, and quoting: "A primrose by the river's
  brim A yellow primrose was to him," bestowed a part of the catch in the
  vasculum, then turned once more to the ditch and began to ply his net
  vigorously, emptying out each netful on the grass, looking it over quickly
  and then making a fresh sweep, dragging the net each time through the mud at
  the bottom. I watched him now with a new and very lively interest; for
  enlightenment was dawning, mingled with some self-contempt and much
  speculation as to how Thorndyke had got his start in this case.</p>

  <p>But I was not the only interested watcher. At one of the windows of the
  factory I presently observed a man who seemed to be looking our way. After a
  few seconds' inspection he disappeared, to reappear almost immediately with a
  pair of field-glasses, through which he took a long look at us. Then he
  disappeared again, but in less than a minute I saw him emerge from a side
  door and advance hurriedly towards us.</p>

  <p>"We are going to have a notice of ejectment served on us, I fancy," said
  I.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced quickly at the approaching stranger but continued to ply
  his net, working, as I noticed, methodically from left to right. When the man
  came within fifty yards he hailed us with a brusque inquiry as to what our
  business was. I went forward to meet him and, if possible, to detain him in
  conversation; but this plan failed, for he ignored me and bore straight down
  on Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," said he, "what's the game? What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke was in the act of raising his net from the water, but he now
  suddenly let it fall to the bottom of the ditch while he turned to confront
  the stranger.</p>

  <p>"I take it that you have some reason for asking," said he.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have," the other replied angrily and with a slight foreign accent
  that agreed with his appearance&mdash;he looked like a Slav of some sort.
  "This is private land. It belongs to the factory. I am the manager."</p>

  <p>"The land is not enclosed," Thorndyke remarked.</p>

  <p>"I tell you the land is private land," the fellow retorted excitedly. "You
  have no business here. I want to know what you are doing."</p>

  <p>"My good sir," said Thorndyke, "there is no need to excite yourself. My
  friend and I are just collecting botanical and other specimens."</p>

  <p>"How do I know that?" the manager demanded. He looked round suspiciously
  and his eye lighted on the vasculum. "What have you got in that thing?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Let him see what is in it," said Thorndyke, with a significant look at
  me.</p>

  <p>Interpreting this as an instruction to occupy the man's attention for a
  few moments, I picked up the vasculum and placed myself so that he must turn
  his back to Thorndyke to look into it. I fumbled awhile with the catch, but
  at length opened the case and began to pick out the weed strand by strand. As
  soon as the stranger's back was turned Thorndyke raised his net and quickly
  picked out of it something which he slipped into his pocket. Then he advanced
  towards us, sorting out the contents of his net as he came.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you see we are just harmless naturalists. By the way,
  what did you think we were looking for?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what I thought," the other replied fiercely. "This is private
  land. You have no business here, and you have got to clear out."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "As you please. There are plenty of other
  ditches." He took the vasculum and the case of bottles, and having put them
  in his pocket, unscrewed his net, wished the stranger "Good-morning," and
  turned back towards the station. The man stood watching us until we were near
  the level crossing, when he, too, turned back and retired to the factory.</p>

  <p>"I saw you take something out of the net," said I. "What was it?"</p>

  <p>He glanced back to make sure that the manager was out of sight. Then he
  put his hand in his pocket, drew it out closed, and suddenly opened it. In
  his palm lay a small gold dental plate with four teeth on it.</p>

  <p>"My word!" I exclaimed; "this clenches the matter with a vengeance. That
  is certainly Cyrus Pedley's plate. It corresponds exactly to the
  description."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "it is practically a certainty. Of course, it will have
  to be identified by the dentist who made it. But it is a foregone
  conclusion."</p>

  <p>I reflected as we walked towards the station on the singular sureness with
  which Thorndyke had followed what was to me an invisible trail. Presently I
  said, "What is puzzling me is how you got your start in this case. What gave
  you the first hint that it was homicide and not suicide or misadventure?"</p>

  <p>"It was the old story, Jervis," he replied; "just a matter of observing
  and remembering apparently trivial details. Here, by the way, is a case in
  point."</p>

  <p>He stopped and looked down at a set of tracks in the soft, earth
  road&mdash;apparently those of the van which we had seen cross the line. I
  followed the direction of his glance and saw the clear impression of a
  Blakey's protector, preceded by that of a gash in the tyre and followed by
  that of a projecting lump.</p>

  <p>"But this is astounding!" I exclaimed. "It is almost certainly the same
  track that we saw in Ponder's Road."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed. "I noticed it as we came along." He brought out his
  spring-tape and notebook, and handing the latter to me, stooped and measured
  the distances between the three impressions. I wrote them down as he called
  them out, and then we compared them with the note made in Ponder's Road. The
  measurements were identical, as were the relative positions of the
  impressions.</p>

  <p>"This is an important piece of evidence," said he. "I wish we were able to
  take casts, but the notes will be pretty conclusive. And now," he continued
  as we resumed our progress towards the station, "to return to your question.
  Parton's evidence at the inquest proved that Cyrus Pedley was drowned in
  water which contained duck-weed. He produced a specimen and we both saw it.
  We saw the duck-weed in it and also two Planorbis shells. The presence of
  those two shells proved that the water in which he was drowned must have
  swarmed with them. We saw the body, and observed that one hand grasped a wisp
  of horn-weed. Then we went to view the ditch and we examined it. That was
  when I got, not a mere hint, but a crucial and conclusive fact. The ditch was
  covered with duck-weed, as we expected. But it was the wrong duck-weed."</p>

  <p>"The wrong duck-weed!" I exclaimed. "Why, how many kinds of duck-weed are
  there?"</p>

  <p>"There are four British species," he replied. "The Greater Duck-weed, the
  Lesser Duck-weed, the Thick Duck-weed, and the Ivy-leaved Duckweed. Now the
  specimens in Parton's jar I noticed were the Greater Duck-weed, which is
  easily distinguished by its roots, which are multiple and form a sort of
  tassel. But the duck-weed on the Bantree ditch was the Lesser Duck weed,
  which is smaller than the other, but is especially distinguished by having
  only a single root. It is impossible to mistake one for the other.</p>

  <p>"Here, then, was practically conclusive evidence of murder. Cyrus Pedley
  had been drowned in a pond or ditch. But not in the ditch in which his body
  was found. Therefore his dead body had been conveyed from some other place
  and put into this ditch. Such a proceeding furnishes prima facie evidence of
  murder. But as soon as the question was raised, there was an abundance of
  confirmatory evidence. There was no horn-weed or Planorbis shells in the
  ditch, but there were swarms of succinea, some of which would inevitably have
  been swallowed with the water. There was an obscure linear pressure mark on
  the arm of the dead man, just above the elbow: such a mark as might be made
  by a cord if a man were pinioned to render him helpless. Then the body would
  have had to be conveyed to this place in some kind of vehicle; and we found
  the traces of what appeared to be a motor-van, which had approached the
  cart-track on the wrong side of the road, as if to pull up there. It was a
  very conclusive mass of evidence; but it would have been useless but for the
  extraordinarily lucky chance that poor Pedley had lost his railway ticket and
  preserved the receipt; by which we were able to ascertain where he was on the
  day of his death and in what locality the murder was probably committed. But
  that is not the only way in which Fortune has favoured us. The
  station-master's information was, and will be, invaluable. Then it was most
  fortunate for us that there was only one ditch on the factory land; and that
  that ditch was accessible at only one point, which must have been the place
  where Pedley was drowned."</p>

  <p>"The duck-weed in this ditch is, of course, the Greater Duck-weed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have taken some specimens as well as the horn-weed and
  shells."</p>

  <p>He opened the vasculum and picked out one of the tiny plants, exhibiting
  the characteristic tassel of roots.</p>

  <p>"I shall write to Parton and tell him to preserve the jar and the
  horn-weed if it has not been thrown away. But the duck-weed alone, produced
  in evidence, would be proof enough that Pedley was not drowned in the Bantree
  ditch; and the dental plate will show where he was drowned."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to pursue the case any farther?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "I shall call at Scotland Yard on my way home and report
  what I have learned and what I can prove in court. Then I shall have finished
  with the case. The rest is for the police, and I imagine they won't have much
  difficulty. The circumstances seem to tell their own story. Pedley was
  employed by the Foreign Office, probably on some kind of secret service. I
  imagine that he discovered the existence of a gang of
  evil-doers&mdash;probably foreign revolutionaries, of whom we may assume that
  our friend the manager of the factory is one; that he contrived to associate
  himself with them and to visit the factory occasionally to ascertain what was
  made there besides Golomite&mdash;if Golomite is not itself an illicit
  product. Then I assume that he was discovered to be a spy, that he was lured
  down here; that he was pinioned and drowned some time on Tuesday night and
  his body put into the van and conveyed to a place miles away from the scene
  of his death, where it was deposited in a ditch apparently identical in
  character with that in which he was drowned. It was an extremely ingenious
  and well-thought-out plan. It seemed to have provided for every kind of
  inquiry, and it very narrowly missed being successful."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "But it didn't provide for Dr. John Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"It didn't provide for a searching examination of all the details," he
  replied; "and no criminal plan that I have ever met has done so. The
  completeness of the scheme is limited by the knowledge of the schemers, and,
  in practice, there is always something overlooked. In this case, the
  criminals were unlearned in the natural history of ditches."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's theory of the crime turned out to be substantially correct.
  The Golomite Works proved to be a factory where high explosives were made by
  a gang of cosmopolitan revolutionaries who were all known to the police. But
  the work of the latter was simplified by a detailed report which the dead man
  had deposited at his bank and which was discovered in time to enable the
  police to raid the factory and secure the whole gang. When once they were
  under lock and key, further information was forthcoming; for a charge of
  murder against them jointly soon produced King's Evidence sufficient to
  procure a conviction of the three actual perpetrators of the murder.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5"></a>MR. PONTING'S ALIBI</h2>

  <p class="first">THORNDYKE looked doubtfully at the pleasant-faced
  athletic-looking clergyman who had just come in, bearing Mr. Brodribb's card
  as an explanatory credential.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see," said he, "why Mr. Brodribb sent you to me. It seems
  to be a purely legal matter which he could have dealt with himself, at least
  as well as I can."</p>

  <p>"He appeared to think otherwise," said the clergyman. ("The Revd. Charles
  Meade" was written on the card.)</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he added with a persuasive smile, "here I am, and I hope
  you are not going to send me away."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't offer that affront to my old friend Brodribb," replied
  Thorndyke, smiling in return; "so we may as well get to business, which, in
  the first place, involves the setting out of all the particulars. Let us
  begin with the lady who is the subject of the threats of which you
  spoke."</p>

  <p>"Her name," said Mr. Meade, "is Miss Mlillicent Fawcett. She is a person
  of independent means, which she employs in works of charity. She was formerly
  a hospital sister, and she does a certain amount of voluntary work in the
  parish as a sort of district nurse. She has been a very valuable help to me
  and we have been close friends for several years; and I may add, as a very
  material fact, that she has consented to marry me in about two months' time.
  So that, you see, I am properly entitled to act on her behalf."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke. "You are an interested party. And now, as to the
  threats. What do they amount to?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Meade, "I can't tell you. I gathered quite by chance, from
  some words that she dropped, that she had been threatened. But she was
  unwilling to say more on the subject, as she did not take the matter
  seriously. She is not at all nervous. However, I told her I was taking
  advice; and I hope you will be able to extract more details from her. For my
  own part, I am decidedly uneasy."</p>

  <p>"And as to the person or persons who have uttered the threats. Who are
  they? and out of what circumstances have the threats arisen?"</p>

  <p>"The person is a certain William Ponting, who is Miss Fawcett's
  step-brother&mdash;if that is the right term. Her father married, as his
  second wife, a Mrs. Ponting, a widow with one son. This is the son. His
  mother died before Mr. Fawcett, and the latter, when he died, left his
  daughter, Millicent, sole heir to his property. That has always been a
  grievance to Ponting. But now he has another. Miss Fawcett made a will some
  years ago by which the bulk of her rather considerable property is left to
  two cousins, Frederick and James Barnett, the sons of her father's sister. A
  comparatively small amount goes to Ponting. When he heard this he was
  furious. He demanded a portion at least equal to the others, and has
  continued to make this demand from time to time. In fact, he has been
  extremely troublesome, and appears to be getting still more so. I gathered
  that the threats were due to her refusal to alter the will."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "doesn't he realise that her marriage will render that will
  null and void?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," replied Meade; "nor, to tell the truth, did I realise it
  myself. Will she have to make a new will?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied. "And as that new will may be expected to be still
  less favourable to him, that will presumably be a further grievance."</p>

  <p>"One doesn't understand," said Thorndyke, "why he should excite himself so
  much about her will. What are their respective ages?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Fawcett is thirty-six and Ponting is about forty."</p>

  <p>"And what kind of man is he?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"A very unpleasant kind of man, I am sorry to say. Morose, rude, and
  violent-tempered. A spendthrift and a cadger. He has had quite a lot of money
  from Miss Fawcett&mdash;loans, which, of course, are never repaid. And he is
  none too industrious, though he has a regular job on the staff of a weekly
  paper. But he seems to be always in debt."</p>

  <p>"We may as well note his address," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"He lives in a small flat in Bloomsbury&mdash;alone now, since he
  quarrelled with the man who used to share it with him. The address is 12
  Borneo House, Devonshire Street."</p>

  <p>"What sort of terms is he on with the cousins, his rivals?"</p>

  <p>"No sort of terms now," replied Meade. "They used to be great friends. So
  much so that he took his present flat to be near them&mdash;they live in the
  adjoining flat, number 12 Sumatra House. But since the trouble about the
  wills he is hardly on speaking terms with them."</p>

  <p>"They live together, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Frederick and his wife and James, who is unmarried. They are rather
  a queer lot, too. Frederick is a singer on the variety stage, and James
  accompanies him on various instruments. But they are both sporting characters
  of a kind, especially James, who does a bit on the turf and engages in other
  odd activities. Of course, their musical habits are a grievance to Ponting.
  He is constantly making complaints of their disturbing him at his work."</p>

  <p>Mr. Meade paused and looked wistfully at Thorndyke, who was making full
  notes of the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the latter, "we seem to have got all the facts excepting the
  most important&mdash;the nature of the threats. What do you want us to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to see Miss Fawcett&mdash;with me, if possible&mdash;and
  induce her to give you such details as would enable you to put a stop to the
  nuisance. You couldn't come to-night, I suppose? It is a beast of a night,
  but I would take you there in a taxi&mdash;it is only to Tooting Bec. What do
  you say?" he added eagerly, as Thorndyke made no objection. "We are sure to
  find her in, because her maid is away on a visit to her home and she is alone
  in the house."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked reflectively at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Half-past eight," he remarked, "and half an hour to get there. These
  threats are probably nothing but ill-temper. But we don't know. There may be
  something more serious behind them; and, in law as in medicine, prevention is
  better than a post-mortem. What do you say, Jervis?"</p>

  <p>What could I say? I would much sooner have sat by the fire with a book
  than turn out into the murk of a November night. But I felt it necessary,
  especially as Thorndyke had evidently made up his mind. Accordingly I made a
  virtue of necessity; and a couple of minutes later we had exchanged the cosy
  room for the chilly darkness of Inner Temple Lane, up which the gratified
  parson was speeding ahead to capture a taxi. At the top of the Lane we
  perceived him giving elaborate instructions to a taxi-driver as he held the
  door of the cab open; and Thorndyke, having carefully disposed of his
  research-case&mdash;which, to my secret amusement, he had caught up, from
  mere force of habit, as we started&mdash;took his seat, and Meade and I
  followed.</p>

  <p>As the taxi trundled smoothly along the dark streets, Mr. Meade filled in
  the details of his previous sketch, and, in a simple, manly, unaffected way
  dilated upon his good fortune and the pleasant future that lay before him. It
  was not, perhaps, a romantic marriage, he admitted; but Miss Fawcett and he
  had been faithful friends for years, and faithful friends they would remain
  till death did them part. So he ran on, now gleefully, now with a note of
  anxiety, and we listened by no means unsympathetically, until at last the cab
  drew up at a small, unpretentious house, standing in its own little grounds
  in a quiet suburban road.</p>

  <p>"She is at home, you see," observed Meade, pointing to a lighted
  ground-floor window. He directed the taxi-driver to wait for the return
  journey, and striding up the path, delivered a characteristic knock at the
  door. As this brought no response, he knocked again and rang the bell. But
  still there was no answer, though twice I thought I heard the sound of a bolt
  being either drawn or shot softly. Again Mr. Meade plied the knocker more
  vigorously, and pressed the push of the bell, which we could hear ringing
  loudly within.</p>

  <p>"This is very strange," said Meade, in an anxious tone, keeping his thumb
  pressed on the bell-push. "She can't have gone out and left the electric
  light on. What had we better do?"</p>

  <p>"We had better enter without more delay," Thorndyke replied. "There were
  certainly sounds from within. Is there a side gate?"</p>

  <p>Meade ran off towards the side of the house, and Thorndyke and I glanced
  at the lighted window, which was slightly open at the top.</p>

  <p>"Looks a bit queer," I remarked, listening at the letter-box.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke assented gravely, and at this moment Meade returned, breathing
  hard.</p>

  <p>"The side gate is bolted inside," said he; and at this I recalled the
  stealthy sound of the bolt that I had heard. "What is to be done?"</p>

  <p>Without replying, Thorndyke handed me his research-case, stepped across to
  the window, sprang up on the sill, drew down the upper sash and disappeared
  between the curtains into the room. A moment later the street door opened and
  Meade and I entered the hall. We glanced through the open doorway into the
  lighted room, and I noticed a heap of needlework thrown hastily on the
  dining- table. Then Meade switched on the hall light, and Thorndyke walked
  quickly past him to the half-open door of the next room. Before entering, he
  reached in and switched on the light; and as he stepped into the room he
  partly closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"Don't come in here, Meade!" he called out. But the parson's eye, like my
  own, had seen something before the door closed: a great, dark stain on the
  carpet just within the threshold. Regardless of the admonition, he pushed the
  door open and darted into the room. Following him, I saw him rush forward,
  fling his arms up wildly, and with a dreadful, strangled cry, sink upon his
  knees beside a low couch on which a woman was lying.</p>

  <p>"Merciful God!" he gasped. "She is dead! Is she dead, doctor? Can nothing
  be done?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "Nothing," he said in a low voice. "She is
  dead."</p>

  <p>Poor Meade knelt by the couch, his hands clutching at his hair and his
  eyes riveted on the dead face, the very embodiment of horror and despair.</p>

  <p>"God Almighty!" he exclaimed in the same strangled undertone. "How
  frightful! Poor, poor Millie! Dear, sweet friend!" Then suddenly&mdash;almost
  savagely&mdash;he turned to Thorndyke. "But it can't be, doctor! It is
  impossible&mdash;unbelievable. That, I mean!" and he pointed to the dead
  woman's right hand, which held an open razor.</p>

  <p>Our poor friend had spoken my own thought. It was incredible that this
  refined, pious lady should have inflicted those savage wounds, that gaped
  scarlet beneath the waxen face. There, indeed, was the razor lying in her
  hand. But what was its testimony worth? My heart rejected it; but yet,
  unwillingly, I noted that the wounds seemed to support it; for they had been
  made from left to right, as they would have been if self-inflicted.</p>

  <p>"It is hard to believe," said Thorndyke, "but there is only one
  alternative. Someone should acquaint the police at once."</p>

  <p>"I will go," exclaimed Meade, starting up. "I know the way and the cab is
  there." He looked once more with infinite pity and affection at the dead
  woman. "Poor, sweet girl!" he murmured. "If we can do no more for you, we can
  defend your memory from calumny and call upon the God of Justice to right the
  innocent and punish the guilty."</p>

  <p>With these words and a mute farewell to his dead friend, he hurried from
  the room, and immediately afterwards we heard the street door close.</p>

  <p>As he went out, Thorndyke's manner changed abruptly. He had been deeply
  moved&mdash;as who would not have been&mdash;by this awful tragedy that had
  in a moment shattered the happiness of the genial, kindly parson. Now he
  turned to me with a face set and stern. "This is an abominable affair,
  Jervis," he said in an ominously quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"You reject the suggestion of suicide, then?" said I, with a feeling of
  relief that surprised me.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he replied. "Murder shouts at us from everything that meets
  our eye. Look at this poor woman, in her trim nurse's dress, with her
  unfinished needlework lying on the table in the next room and that
  preposterous razor loose in her limp hand. Look at the savage wounds. Four of
  them, and the first one mortal. The great bloodstain by the door, the great
  bloodstain on her dress from the neck to the feet. The gashed collar, the
  cap-string cut right through. Note that the bleeding had practically ceased
  when she lay down. That is a group of visible facts that is utterly
  inconsistent with the idea of suicide. But we are wasting time. Let us search
  the premises thoroughly. The murderer has pretty certainly got away, but as
  he was in the house when we arrived, any traces will be quite fresh."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he took his electric lamp from the research-case and walked to
  the door.</p>

  <p>"We can examine this room later," he said, "but we had better look over
  the house. If you will stay by the stairs and watch the front and back doors,
  I will look through the upper rooms."</p>

  <p>He ran lightly up the stairs while I kept watch below, but he was absent
  less than a couple of minutes.</p>

  <p>"There is no one there," he reported, "and as there is no basement we will
  just look at this floor and then examine the grounds."</p>

  <p>After a rapid inspection of the ground-floor rooms, including the kitchen,
  we went out by the back door, which was unbolted, and inspected the grounds.
  These consisted of a largish garden with a small orchard at the side. In the
  former we could discover no traces of any kind, but at the end of the path
  that crossed the orchard we came an a possible clue. The orchard was enclosed
  by a five-foot fence, the top of which bristled with hooked nails; and at the
  point opposite to the path, Thorndyke's lantern brought into view one or two
  wisps of cloth caught on the hooks.</p>

  <p>"Someone has been over here," said Thorndyke, "but as this is an orchard,
  there is nothing remarkable in the fact. However, there is no fruit on the
  trees now, and the cloth looks fairly fresh. There are two kinds, you notice:
  a dark blue and a black and white mixture of some kind."</p>

  <p>"Corresponding, probably, to the coat and trousers," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," he agreed, taking from his pocket a couple of the little
  seed-envelopes of which he always carried a supply. Very delicately he picked
  the tiny wisps of cloth from the hooks and bestowed each kind in a separate
  envelope. Having pocketed these, he leaned over the fence and threw the light
  of his lamp along the narrow lane or alley that divided the orchard from the
  adjoining premises. It was ungravelled and covered with a growth of rank
  grass, which suggested that it was little frequented. But immediately below
  was a small patch of bare earth, and on this was a very distinct impression
  of a foot, covering several less distinct prints.</p>

  <p>"Several people have been over here at different times," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed. "But that sharp footprint belongs to the last one
  over, and he is our concern. We had better not confuse the issues by getting
  over ourselves. We will mark the spot and explore from the other end." He
  laid his handkerchief over the top of the fence and we then went back to the
  house.</p>

  <p>"You are going to take a plaster cast, I suppose?" said I; and as he
  assented, I fetched the research-case from the drawing-room. Then we fixed
  the catch of the front-door latch and went out, drawing the door to after
  us.</p>

  <p>We found the entrance to the alley about sixty yards from the gate, and
  entering it, walked slowly forwards, scanning the ground as we went. But the
  bright lamplight showed nothing more than the vague marks of trampling feet
  on the grass until we came to the spot marked by the handkerchief on the
  fence.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," I remarked, "that this footprint has obliterated the
  others."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," he replied, "this one, which is the one that
  interests us, is remarkably clear and characteristic: a circular heel and a
  rubber sole of a recognisable pattern mended with a patch of cement paste. It
  is a footprint that could be identified beyond a doubt."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, he took from the research-case the water-bottle,
  plaster-tin, rubber mixing-bowl and spoon, and a piece of canvas with which
  to "reinforce" the cast. Rapidly, he mixed a bowlful&mdash;extra thick, so
  that it should set quickly and hard&mdash;dipped the canvas into it, poured
  the remainder into the footprint, and laid the canvas on it.</p>

  <p>"I will get you to stay here, Jervis," said he, "until the plaster has
  set. I want to examine the body rather more thoroughly before the police
  arrive, particularly the back."</p>

  <p>"Why the back?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Did not the appearance of the body suggest to you the advisability of
  examining the back?" he asked, and then, without waiting for a reply, he went
  off, leaving the inspection-lamp with me.</p>

  <p>His words gave me matter for profound thought during my short vigil. I
  recalled the appearance of the dead woman very vividly&mdash;indeed, I am not
  likely ever to forget it&mdash;and I strove to connect that appearance with
  his desire to examine the back of the corpse. But there seemed to be no
  connection at all. The visible injuries were in front, and I had seen nothing
  to suggest the existence of any others. From time to time I tested the
  condition of the plaster, impatient to rejoin my colleague but fearful of
  cracking the thin cast by raising it prematurely. At length the plaster
  seemed to be hard enough, and trusting to the strength of the canvas, I
  prised cautiously at the edge, when, to my relief, the brittle plate came up
  safely and I lifted it clear. Wrapping it carefully in some spare rag, I
  packed it in the research-case, and then, taking this and the lantern, made
  my way back to the house.</p>

  <p>When I had let down the catch and closed the front door, I went to the
  drawing-room, where I found Thorndyke stooping over the dark stain at the
  threshold and scanning the floor as if in search of something. I reported the
  completion of the cast and then asked him what he was looking for.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for a button," he replied. "There is one missing from the
  back; the one to which the collar was fastened."</p>

  <p>"Is it of any importance?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is important to ascertain when and where it became detached," he
  replied. "Let us have the inspection-lamp."</p>

  <p>I gave him the lamp, which he placed on the floor, turning it so that its
  beam of light travelled along the surface. Stooping to follow the light, I
  scrutinised the floor minutely but in vain.</p>

  <p>"It may not be here at all," said I; but at that moment the bright gleam,
  penetrating the darkness under a cabinet, struck a small object close to the
  wall. In a moment I had thrown myself prone on the carpet, and reaching under
  the cabinet, brought forth a largish mother-of-pearl button.</p>

  <p>"You notice," said Thorndyke, as he examined it, "that the cabinet is near
  the window, at the opposite end of the room to the couch. But we had better
  see that it is the right button."</p>

  <p>He walked slowly towards the couch, still stooping and searching the floor
  with the light. The corpse, I noticed, had been turned on its side, exposing
  the back and the displaced collar. Through the strained button-hole of the
  latter Thorndyke passed the button without difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "that is where it came from. You will notice that there is
  a similar one in front. By the way," he continued, bringing the lamp close to
  the surface of the grey serge dress, "I picked off one or two
  hairs&mdash;animal hairs; cat and dog they looked like. Here are one or two
  more. Will you hold the lamp while I take them off?"</p>

  <p>"They are probably from some pets of hers," I remarked, as he picked them
  off with his forceps and deposited them in one of the invaluable
  seed-envelopes. "Spinsters are a good deal addicted to pets, especially cats
  and dogs."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," he replied. "But I could see none in front, where you would
  expect to find them, and there seem to be none on the carpet. Now let us
  replace the body as we found it and just have a look at our material before
  the police arrive. I expected them here before this."</p>

  <p>We turned the body back into its original position, and taking the
  research-case and the lamp, went into the dining-room. Here Thorndyke rapidly
  set up the little travelling microscope, and bringing forth the seed-
  envelopes, began to prepare slides from the contents of some while I prepared
  the others. There was time only for a very hasty examination, which Thorndyke
  made as soon as the specimens were mounted.</p>

  <p>"The clothing," he reported, with his eye at the microscope, "is woollen
  in both cases. Fairly good quality. The one a blue serge, apparently indigo
  dyed; the other a mixture of black and white, no other colour. Probably a
  fine tabby or a small shepherd's plaid."</p>

  <p>"Serge coat and shepherd's plaid trousers," I suggested. "Now see what the
  hairs are." I handed him the slide, on which I had roughly mounted the
  collection in oil of lavender, and he placed it on the stage.</p>

  <p>"There are three different kinds of hairs here," he reported, after a
  rapid inspection. "Some are obviously from a cat&mdash;a smoky Persian.
  Others are long, rather fine tawny hairs from a dog. Probably a Pekinese. But
  there are two that I can't quite place. They look like monkey's hairs, but
  they are a very unusual colour. There is a perceptible greenish tint, which
  is extremely uncommon in mammalian hairs. But I hear the taxi approaching. We
  need not be expansive to the local police as to what we have observed. This
  will probably be a case for the C.I.D."</p>

  <p>I went out into the hall and opened the door as Meade came up the path,
  followed by two men; and as the latter came into the light, I was astonished
  to recognise in one of them our old friend, Detective-Superintendent Miller,
  the other being, apparently, the station superintendent.</p>

  <p>"We have kept Mr. Meade a long time," said Miller, "but we knew you were
  here, so the time wouldn't be wasted. Thought it best to get a full statement
  before we inspected the premises. How do, doctor?" he added, shaking hands
  with Thorndyke. "Glad to see you here. I suppose you have got all the facts.
  I understood so from Mr. Meade."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "we have all the antecedents of the case, and we
  arrived within a few minutes of the death of the deceased."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Miller. "Did you? And I expect you have formed an opinion
  on the question as to whether the injuries were self-inflicted?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that it would be best to act on the assumption
  that they were not&mdash;and to act promptly."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Miller agreed emphatically. "You mean that we had better find
  out at once where a certain person was at&mdash;What time did you arrive
  here?"</p>

  <p>"It was two minutes to nine when the taxi stopped," replied Thorndyke;
  "and, as it is now only twenty-five minutes to ten, we have good time if Mr.
  Meade can spare us the taxi. I have the address."</p>

  <p>"The taxi is waiting for you," said Mr. Meade, "and the man has been paid
  for both journeys. I shall stay here in case the superintendent wants
  anything." He shook our hands warmly, and as we bade him farewell and noted
  the dazed, despairing expression and lines of grief that had already eaten
  into the face that had been so blithe and hopeful, we both thought bitterly
  of the few fatal minutes that had made us too late to save the wreckage of
  his life.</p>

  <p>We were just turning away when Thorndyke paused and again faced the
  clergyman. "Can you tell me," he asked, "whether Miss Fawcett had any pets?
  Cats, dogs, or other animals?"</p>

  <p>Meade looked at him in surprise, and Superintendent Miller seemed to prick
  up his ears. But the former answered simply: "No. She was not very fond of
  animals; she reserved her affections for men and women."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded gravely, and picking up the research-case walked slowly
  out of the room, Miller and I following.</p>

  <p>As soon as the address had been given to the driver and we had taken our
  seats in the taxi, the superintendent opened the examination-in-chief.</p>

  <p>"I see you have got your box of magic with you, doctor," he said, cocking
  his eye at the research-case. "Any luck?"</p>

  <p>"We have secured a very distinctive footprint," replied Thorndyke, "but it
  may have no connection with the case."</p>

  <p>"I hope it has," said Miller. "A good cast of a footprint which you can
  let the jury compare with the boot is first-class evidence." He took the
  cast, which I had produced from the research-case, and turning it over
  tenderly and gloatingly, exclaimed: "Beautiful! beautiful! Absolutely
  distinctive! There can't be another exactly like it in the world. It is as
  good as a fingerprint. For the Lord's sake take care of it. It means a
  conviction if we can find the boot."</p>

  <p>The superintendent's efforts to engage Thorndyke in discussion were not
  very successful, and the conversational brunt was borne by me. For we both
  knew my colleague too well to interrupt him if he was disposed to be
  meditative. And such was now his disposition. Looking at him as he sat in his
  corner, silent but obviously wrapped in thought, I knew that he was mentally
  sorting out the data and testing the hypotheses that they yielded.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Miller, opening the door as the taxi stopped. "Now
  what are we going to say? Shall I tell him who I am?"</p>

  <p>"I expect you will have to," replied Thorndyke, "if you want him to let us
  in."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miller. "But I shall let you do the talking, because I
  don't know what you have got up your sleeve."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's prediction was verified literally. In response to the third
  knock, with an obbligato accompaniment on the bell, wrathful
  footsteps&mdash;I had no idea footsteps could be so expressive&mdash;advanced
  rapidly along the lobby, the door was wrenched open&mdash;but only for a few
  inches&mdash;and an angry, hairy face appeared in the opening.</p>

  <p>"Now then," the hairy person demanded, "what the deuce do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. William Pouting?" the superintendent inquired.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is that to do with you?" was the genial answer&mdash;in
  the Scottish mode.</p>

  <p>"We have business," Miller began persuasively.</p>

  <p>"So have I," the presumable Ponting replied, "and mine won't wait."</p>

  <p>"But our business is very important," Miller urged.</p>

  <p>"So is mine," snapped Ponting, and would have shut the door but for
  Miller's obstructing foot, at which he kicked viciously, but with
  unsatisfactory results, as he was shod in light slippers, whereas the
  superintendent's boots were of constabulary solidity.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here," said Miller, dropping his conciliatory manner very
  completely, "you'd better stop this nonsense. I am a police officer, and I am
  going to come in;" and with this he inserted a massive shoulder and pushed
  the door open.</p>

  <p>"Police officer, are you?" said Ponting. "And what might your business be
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I have been waiting to tell you," said Miller. "But we don't
  want to do our talking here."</p>

  <p>"Very well," growled Panting. "Come in. But understand that I am busy.
  I've been interrupted enough this evening."</p>

  <p>He led the way into a rather barely furnished room with a wide bay-window
  in which was a table fitted with a writing-slope and lighted by an electric
  standard lamp. A litter of manuscript explained the nature of his business
  and his unwillingness to receive casual visitors. He sulkily placed three
  chairs, and then, seating himself, glowered at Thorndyke and me.</p>

  <p>"Are they police officers, too?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miller, "they are medical gentlemen. Perhaps you had better
  explain the matter, doctor," he added, addressing Thorndyke, who thereupon
  opened the proceedings.</p>

  <p>"We have called," said he, "to inform you that Miss Millicent Fawcett died
  suddenly this evening."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Panting. "That's sudden with a vengeance. What time
  did this happen?"</p>

  <p>"About a quarter to nine."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" muttered Ponting. "I saw her only the day before
  yesterday, and she seemed quite well then. What did she die of?"</p>

  <p>"The appearances," replied Thorndyke, "suggest suicide."</p>

  <p>"Suicide!" gasped Ponting. "Impossible! I can't believe it. Do you mean to
  tell me she poisoned herself?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke, "it was not poison. Death was caused by injuries to
  the throat inflicted with a razor."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Ponting. "What a horrible thing! But," he added,
  after a pause, "I can't believe she did it herself, and I don't. Why should
  she commit suicide? She was quite happy, and she was just going to be married
  to that mealy-faced parson. And a razor, too! How do you suppose she came by
  a razor? Women don't shave. They smoke and drink and swear, but they haven't
  taken to shaving yet. I don't believe it. Do you?"</p>

  <p>He glared ferociously at the superintendent who replied: "I am not sure
  that I do. There's a good deal in what you've just said, and the same
  objections had occurred to us. But you see, if she didn't do it herself,
  someone else must have done it, and we should like to find out who that
  someone is. So we begin by ascertaining where any possible persons may have
  been at a quarter to nine this evening."</p>

  <p>Ponting smiled like an infuriated cat. "So you think me a possible person,
  do you?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Everyone is a possible person," Miller replied blandly, "especially when
  he is known to have uttered threats."</p>

  <p>The reply sobered Ponting considerably. For a few moments he sat, looking
  reflectively at the superintendent; then, in comparatively quiet tones, he
  said: "I have been working here since six o'clock. You can see the stuff for
  yourself, and I can prove that it has been written since six."</p>

  <p>The superintendent nodded, but made no comment, and Ponting gazed at him
  fixedly, evidently thinking hard. Suddenly he broke into a harsh laugh.</p>

  <p>"What is the joke?" Miller inquired stolidly.</p>

  <p>"The joke is that I have got another alibi&mdash;a very complete one.
  There are compensations in every evil. I told you I had been interrupted in
  my work already this evening. It was those fools next door, the
  Barnetts&mdash;cousins of mine. They are musicians, save the mark! Variety
  stage, you know. Funny songs and jokes for mental defectives. Well, they
  practise their infernal ditties in their rooms, and the row comes into mine,
  and an accursed nuisance it is. However, they have agreed not to practise on
  Thursdays and Fridays&mdash;my busy nights&mdash;and usually they don't. But
  to-night, just as I was in the thick of my writing, I suddenly heard the most
  unholy din; that idiot, Fred Barnett, bawling one of his imbecile
  songs&mdash;'When the pigs their wings have folded,' and balderdash of that
  sort&mdash;and the other donkey accompanying him on the clarinet, if you
  please! I stuck it for a minute or two. Then I rushed round to their flat and
  raised Cain with the bell and knocker. Mrs. Fred opened the door, and I told
  her what I thought of it. Of course she was very apologetic, said they had
  forgotten that it was Thursday and promised that she would make her husband
  stop. And I suppose she did, for by the time I got back to my rooms the row
  had ceased. I could have punched the whole lot of them into a jelly, but it
  was all for the best as it turns out."</p>

  <p>"What time was it when you went round there?" asked Miller.</p>

  <p>"About five minutes past nine," replied Ponting. "The church bell had
  struck nine when the row began."</p>

  <p>"Hm!" grunted Miller, glancing at Thorndyke. "Well, that is all we wanted
  to know, so we need not keep you from your work any longer."</p>

  <p>He rose, and being let out with great alacrity, stumped down the stairs,
  followed by Thorndyke and me. As we came out into the street, he turned to us
  with a deeply disappointed expression.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "this is a suck-in. I was in hopes that we had
  pounced on our quarry before he had got time to clear away the traces. And
  now we've got it all to do. You can't get round an alibi of that sort."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Thorndyke to see how he was taking this unexpected check. He
  was evidently puzzled, and I could see by the expression of concentration in
  his face that he was trying over the facts and inferences in new combinations
  to meet this new position. Probably he had noticed, as I had, that Ponting
  was wearing a tweed suit, and that therefore the shreds of clothing from the
  fence could not be his unless he had changed. But the alibi put him
  definitely out of the picture, and, as Miller had said, we now had nothing to
  give us a lead.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Thorndyke came out of his reverie and addressed the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"We had better put this alibi on the basis of ascertained fact. It ought
  to be verified at once. At present we have only Ponting's unsupported
  statement."</p>

  <p>"It isn't likely that he would risk telling a lie," Miller replied
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"A man who is under suspicion of murder will risk a good deal," Thorndyke
  retorted, "especially if he is guilty. I think we ought to see Mrs. Barnett
  before there is any opportunity of collusion."</p>

  <p>"There has been time for collusion already," said Miller. "Still, you are
  quite right, and I see there is a light in their sitting-room, if that is it,
  next to Ponting's. Let us go up and settle the matter now. I shall leave you
  to examine the witness and say what you think it best to say."</p>

  <p>We entered the building and ascended the stairs to the Barnetts' flat,
  where Miller rang the bell and executed a double knock. After a short
  interval the door was opened and a woman looked out at us inquisitively.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mrs. Frederick Barnett?" Thorndyke inquired. The woman admitted
  her identity in a tone of some surprise, and Thorndyke explained: "We have
  called to make a few inquiries concerning your neighbour, Mr. Ponting, and
  also about certain matters relating to your family. I am afraid it is a
  rather unseasonable hour for a visit, but as the affair is of some importance
  and time is an object, I hope you will overlook that."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnett listened to this explanation with a puzzled and rather
  suspicious air. After a few moments' hesitation, she said: "I think you had
  better see my husband, if you will wait here a moment I will go and tell
  him." With this, she pushed the door to, without actually closing it, and we
  heard her retire along the lobby, presumably to the sitting-room. For, during
  the short colloquy, I had observed a door at the end of the lobby, partly
  open, through which I could see the end of a table covered with a red
  cloth.</p>

  <p>The "moment" extended to a full minute, and the superintendent began to
  show signs of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you didn't ask her the simple question straight out," he
  said, and the same question had occurred to me. But at this point footsteps
  were heard approaching, the door opened, and a man confronted us, holding the
  door open with his left hand, his right being wrapped in a handkerchief. He
  looked suspiciously from one to the other of us, and asked stiffly: "What is
  it that you want to know? And would you mind telling me who you are?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Thorndyke," was the reply. "I am the legal adviser of the
  Reverend Charles Meade, and these two gentlemen are interested parties. I
  want to know what you can tell me of Mr. Ponting's recent
  movements&mdash;to-day, for instance. When did you last see him?"</p>

  <p>The man appeared to be about to refuse any conversation, but suddenly
  altered his mind, reflected for a few moments, and then replied: "I saw him
  from my window at his&mdash;they are bay-windows&mdash;about half-past eight.
  But my wife saw him later than that. If you will come in she can tell you the
  time exactly." He led the way along the lobby with an obviously puzzled air.
  But he was not more puzzled than I, or than Miller, to judge by the
  bewildered glance that the superintendent cast at me, as he followed our host
  along the lobby. I was still meditating on Thorndyke's curiously indirect
  methods when the sitting-room door was opened; and then I got a minor
  surprise of another kind. When I had last looked into the room, the table had
  been covered by a red cloth. It was now bare; and when we entered the room I
  saw that the red cover had been thrown over a side table, on which was some
  bulky and angular object. Apparently it had been thought desirable to conceal
  that object, whatever it was, and as we took our seats beside the bare table,
  my mind was busy with conjectures as to what that object could be.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnett repeated Thorndyke's question to his wife, adding: "I think it
  must have been a little after nine when Ponting came round. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "it would be, for I heard it strike nine just before
  you began your practice, and he came a few minutes after."</p>

  <p>"You see," Barnett explained, "I am a singer, and my brother, here,
  accompanies me on various instruments, and of course we have to practise. But
  we don't practise on the nights when Ponting is busy&mdash;Thursdays and
  Fridays&mdash;as he said that the music disturbed him. To-night, however, we
  made a little mistake. I happen to have got a new song that I am anxious to
  get ready&mdash;it has an illustrative accompaniment on the clarinet, which
  my brother will play. We were so much taken up with the new song that we all
  forgot what day of the week it was, and started to have a good practice. But
  before we had got through the first verse, Ponting came round, battering at
  the door like a madman. My wife went out and pacified him, and of course we
  shut down for the evening."</p>

  <p>While Mr. Barnett was giving his explanation, I looked about the room with
  vague curiosity. Somehow&mdash;I cannot tell exactly how&mdash;I was sensible
  of something queer in the atmosphere of this place; of a certain indefinite
  sense of tension. Mrs. Barnett looked pale and flurried. Her husband, in
  spite of his volubility, seemed ill at ease, and the brother, who sat huddled
  in an easy-chair, nursing a dark-coloured Persian cat, stared into the fire,
  and neither moved nor spoke. And again I looked at the red table-cloth and
  wondered what it covered.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Barnett, after a brief pause, "what is the point of
  these inquiries of yours? About Ponting, I mean. What does it matter to you
  where he was this evening?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he produced a pipe and tobacco-pouch, and proceeded to fill
  the former, holding it in his bandaged right hand and filling it with his
  left. The facility with which he did this suggested that he was left-handed,
  an inference that was confirmed by the ease with which he struck the match
  with his left hand, and by the fact that he wore a wrist-watch on his right
  wrist.</p>

  <p>"Your question is a perfectly natural one," said Thorndyke. "The answer to
  it is that a very terrible thing has happened. Miss Millicent Fawcett, who
  is, I think, a connection of yours, met her death this evening under
  circumstances of grave suspicion. She died, either by her own hand or by the
  hand of a murderer, a few minutes before nine o'clock. Hence it has become I
  necessary to ascertain the whereabouts at that time of any persons on whom
  suspicion might reasonably fall."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Barnett. "What a shocking thing!"</p>

  <p>The exclamation was followed by a deep silence, amidst which I could hear
  the barking of a dog in an adjacent room, the unmistakable sharp, treble yelp
  of a Pekinese. And again I seemed to be aware of a strange sense of tension
  in the occupants of this room. On hearing Thorndyke's answer, Mrs. Barnett
  had turned deadly pale and let her head fall forward on her hand. Her husband
  had sunk on to a chair, and he, too, looked pale and deeply shocked, while
  the brother continued to stare silently into the fire.</p>

  <p>At this moment Thorndyke astonished me by an exhibition of what
  seemed&mdash;under the tragic circumstances&mdash;the most outrageous bad
  manners and bad taste. Rising from his chair with his eyes fixed on a print
  which hung on the wall above the red-covered table, he said: "That looks like
  one of Cameron's etchings," and forthwith stepped across the room to examine
  it, resting his hand, as he leaned forward, on the object covered by the
  cloth.</p>

  <p>"Mind where you are putting your hand, sir!" Fred Barnett called out,
  springing to his feet.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked down at his hand, and deliberately raising a corner of
  the cloth, looked under. "There is no harm done," he remarked quietly,
  letting the cloth drop; and with another glance at the print, he went back to
  his chair.</p>

  <p>Once more a deep silence fell upon the room, and I had a vague feeling
  that the tension had increased. Mrs. Barnett was as white as a ghost and
  seemed to catch at her breath. Her, husband watched her with a wild, angry
  expression and smoked furiously, while the superintendent&mdash;also
  conscious of something abnormal in the atmosphere of the room&mdash;looked
  furtively from the woman to the man and from him to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Yet again in the silence the shrill barking of the Pekinese dog broke out,
  and somehow that sound connected itself in my mind with the Persian cat that
  dozed on the knees of the immovable man by the fire. I looked at the cat and
  at the man, and even as I looked, I was startled by a most extraordinary
  apparition. Above the man's shoulder, slowly rose a little round head like
  the head of a diminutive, greenish-brown man. Higher and higher the tiny
  monkey raised itself, resting on its little hands to peer at the strangers.
  Then, with sudden coyness, like a shy baby, it popped down out of sight.</p>

  <p>I was thunderstruck. The cat and the dog I had noted merely as a curious
  coincidence. But the monkey&mdash;and such an unusual monkey, too&mdash;put
  coincidences out of the question. I stared at the man in positive
  stupefaction. Somehow that man was connected with that unforgettable figure
  lying upon the couch miles away. But how? When that deed of horror was doing,
  he had been here in this very room. Yet, in some way, he had been concerned
  in it. And suddenly a suspicion dawned upon me that Thorndyke was waiting for
  the actual perpetrator to arrive.</p>

  <p>"It is a most ghastly affair," Barnett repeated presently in a husky
  voice. Then, after a pause, he asked: "Is there any sort of evidence as to
  whether she killed herself or was killed by somebody else?"</p>

  <p>"I think that my friend, here, Detective-Superintendent Miller, has
  decided that she was murdered." He looked at the bewildered superintendent,
  who replied with an inarticulate grunt.</p>

  <p>"And is there any clue as to who the&mdash;the murderer may be? You spoke
  of suspected persons just now."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "there is an excellent clue, if it can only be
  followed up. We found a most unmistakable footprint; and what is more, we
  took a plaster cast of it. Would you like to see the cast?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply, he opened the research-case and took out the
  cast, which he placed in my hands.</p>

  <p>"Just take it round and show it to them," he said.</p>

  <p>The superintendent had witnessed Thorndyke's amazing proceedings with an
  astonishment that left him speechless. But now he sprang to his feet, and, as
  I walked round the table, he pressed beside me to guard the precious cast
  from possible injury. I laid it carefully down on the table, and as the light
  fell on it obliquely, it presented a most striking appearance&mdash;that of a
  snow-white boot-sole on which the unshapely patch, the circular heel, and the
  marks of wear were clearly visible.</p>

  <p>The three spectators gathered round, as near as the superintendent would
  let them approach, and I observed them closely, assuming that this
  incomprehensible move of Thorndyke's was a device to catch one or more of
  them off their guard. Fred Barnett looked at the cast stolidly enough, though
  his face had gone several shades paler, but Mrs. Barnett stared at it with
  starting eyeballs and dropped jaw&mdash;the very picture of horror and
  dismay. As to James Barnett, whom I now saw clearly for the first time, he
  stood behind the woman with a singularly scared and haggard face, and his
  eyes riveted on the white boot-sole. And now I could see that he wore a suit
  of blue serge and that the front both of his coat and waistcoat were thickly
  covered with the shed hairs of his pets.</p>

  <p>There was something very uncanny about this group of persons gathered
  around that accusing footprint, all as still and rigid as statues and none
  uttering a sound. But something still more uncanny followed. Suddenly the
  deep silence of the room was shattered by the shrill notes of a clarinet, and
  a brassy voice burst forth:</p>

  <p>"When the pigs their wings have folded<br>
  And the cows are in their nest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>We all spun round in amazement, and at the first glance the mystery of the
  crime was solved. There stood Thorndyke with the red table-cover at his feet,
  and at his side, on the small table, a massively-constructed phonograph of
  the kind used in offices for dictating letters, but fitted with a convoluted
  metal horn in place of the rubber ear-tubes.</p>

  <p>A moment of astonished silence was succeeded by a wild confusion. Mrs.
  Barnett uttered a piercing shriek and fell back on to a chair, her husband
  broke away and rushed at Thorndyke, who instantly gripped his wrist and
  pinioned him, while the superintendent, taking in the situation at a glance,
  fastened on the unresisting James and forced him down into a chair. I ran
  round, and having stopped the machine&mdash;for the preposterous song was
  hideously incongruous with the tragedy that was enacting&mdash;went to
  Thorndyke's assistance and helped him to remove his prisoner from the
  neighbourhood of the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Superintendent Miller," said Thorndyke, still maintaining a hold on his
  squirming captive, "I believe you are a justice of the peace?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply, "ex officio."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I accuse these three persons of being concerned
  in the murder of Miss Millicent Fawcett; Frederick Barnett as the principal
  who actually committed the murder, James Barnett as having aided him by
  holding the arms of the deceased, and Mrs. Barnett as an accessory before the
  fact in that she worked this phonograph for the purpose of establishing a
  false alibi."</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing about it!" Mrs. Barnett shrieked hysterically. "They never
  told me why they wanted me to work the thing."</p>

  <p>"We can't go into that now," said Miller. "You will be able to make your
  defence at the proper time and place. Can one of you go for assistance or
  must I blow my whistle?"</p>

  <p>"You had better go, Jervis," said Thorndyke. "I can hold this man until
  reinforcements arrive. Send a constable up and then go on to the station. And
  leave the outer door ajar."</p>

  <p>I followed these directions, and having found the police station,
  presently returned to the flat with four constables and a sergeant in two
  taxis.</p>

  <p>When the prisoners had been removed, together with the three
  animals&mdash;the latter in charge of a zoophilist constable&mdash;we
  searched the bedrooms. Frederick Barnett had changed his clothing completely,
  but in a locked drawer&mdash;the lock of which Thorndyke picked neatly, to
  the superintendent's undisguised admiration&mdash;we found the discarded
  garments, including a pair of torn shepherd's plaid trousers, covered with
  blood stains, and a new, empty razor-case. These things, together with the
  wax cylinder of the phonograph, Miller made up into a neat parcel and took
  away with him.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said I, as we walked homewards, "the general drift of this
  case is quite obvious. But it seemed to me that you went to the Barnetts'
  flat with a definite purpose already formed, and with a definite suspicion in
  your mind. Now, I don't see how you came to suspect the Barnetts."</p>

  <p>"I think you will," he replied, "if you will recall the incidents in their
  order from the beginning, including poor Meade's preliminary statement. To
  begin with the appearances of the body: the suggestion of suicide was
  transparently false. To say nothing of its incongruity with the character and
  circumstances of the deceased and the very unlikely weapon used, there were
  the gashed collar and the cut cap-string. As you know, it is a
  well-established rule that suicides do not damage their clothing. A man who
  cuts his own throat doesn't cut his collar. He takes it off. He removes all
  obstructions. Naturally, for he wishes to complete the act as easily and
  quickly as possible, and he has time for preparation. But the murderer must
  take things as he finds them and execute his purpose as best he can.</p>

  <p>"But further; the wounds were inflicted near the door, but the body was on
  the couch at the other end of the room. We saw, from the absence of bleeding,
  that she was dying&mdash;in fact, apparently dead&mdash;when she lay down.
  She must therefore have been carried to the couch after the wounds were
  inflicted.</p>

  <p>"Then there were the blood-stains. They were all in front, and the blood
  had run down vertically. Then she must have been standing upright while the
  blood was flowing. Now there were four wounds, and the first one was mortal,
  it divided the common carotid artery and the great veins. On receiving that
  wound she would ordinarily have fallen down. But she did not fall, or there
  would have been a blood-stain across the neck. Why did she not fall? The
  obvious suggestion was that someone was holding her up. This suggestion was
  confirmed by the absence of cuts on her hands&mdash;which would certainly
  have been cut if someone bad not been holding them. It was further confirmed
  by the rough crumpling of the collar at the back: so rough that the button
  was torn off. And we found that button near the door.</p>

  <p>"Further, there were the animal hairs. They were on the back only. There
  were none on the front&mdash;where they would have been if derived from the
  animals&mdash;or anywhere else. And we learned that she kept no animals. All
  these appearances pointed to the presence of two persons, one of whom stood
  behind her and held her arms while the other stood in front and committed the
  murder. The cloth on the fence supported this view, being probably derived
  from two different pairs of trousers. The character of the wounds made it
  nearly certain that the murderer was left-handed.</p>

  <p>"While we were returning in the cab, I reflected on these facts and
  considered the case generally. First, what was the motive? There was nothing
  to suggest robbery, nor was it in the least like a robber's crime. What other
  motive could there be? Well, here was a comparatively rich woman who had made
  a will in favour of certain persons, and she was going to be married. On her
  marriage the will would automatically become void, and she was not likely to
  make another will so favourable to those persons. Here, then, was a possible
  motive, and that motive applied to Ponting, who had actually uttered threats
  and was obviously suspect.</p>

  <p>"But, apart from those threats, Ponting was not the principal suspect, for
  he benefited only slightly under the will. The chief beneficiaries were the
  Barnetts, and Miss Fawcett's death would benefit them, not only by securing
  the validity of the will, but by setting the will into immediate operation.
  And there were two of them. They therefore fitted the circumstances better
  than Ponting did. And when we came to interview Ponting, he went straight out
  of the picture. His manuscript would probably have cleared him&mdash;with his
  editor's confirmation. But the other alibi was conclusive.</p>

  <p>"What instantly struck me, however, was that Ponting's alibi was also an
  alibi for the Barnetts. But there was this difference: Ponting had been seen;
  the Barnetts had only been heard. Now, it has often occurred to me that a
  very effective false alibi could be worked with a gramophone or a
  phonograph&mdash;especially with one on which one can make one's own records.
  This idea now recurred to me; and at once it was supported by the appearance
  of an arranged effect. Ponting was known to be at work. It was practically
  certain that a blast of 'music' would bring him out. Then he would be
  available, if necessary, as a witness to prove an alibi. It seemed to be
  worth while to investigate.</p>

  <p>"When we came to the flat we encountered a man with an injured
  hand&mdash;the right, it would have been more striking if it had been his
  left. But it presently turns out that he is left-handed; which is still more
  striking as a coincidence. This man is extraordinarily ready to answer
  questions which most persons would have refused to answer at all. Those
  answers contain the alibi.</p>

  <p>"Then there was the incident of the table&mdash;I think you noticed it.
  That cover was on the large table when we arrived, but it was taken off and
  thrown over something, evidently to conceal it. But I need not pursue the
  details. When I had seen the cat, heard the dog, and then seen the monkey, I
  determined to see what was under the table-cover; and finding that it was a
  phonograph with the cylinder record still on the drum, I decided to 'go Nap'
  and chance making a mistake. For until we had tried the record, the alibi
  remained. If it had failed, I should have advised Miller to hold a boot
  parade. Fortunately we struck the right record and completed the case."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnett's defence was accepted by the magistrate and the charge
  against her was dismissed. The other two were committed for trial, and in due
  course paid the extreme penalty. "Yet another illustration," was Thorndyke's
  comment, "of the folly of that kind of criminal who won't let well alone, and
  who will create false clues. If the Barnetts had not laid down those false
  tracks, they would probably never have been suspected. It was their clever
  alibi that led us straight to their door."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6"></a>PANDORA'S BOX</h2>

  <p class="first">"I SEE our friend, S. Chapman, is still a defaulter," said
  I, as I ran my eye over the "personal" column of The Times.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked up interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"Chapman?" he repeated; "let me see, who is he?"</p>

  <p>"The man with the box. I read you the advertisement the other day. Here it
  is again. 'If the box left in the luggage-room by S. Chapman is not claimed
  within a week from this date, it will be sold to defray
  expenses.&mdash;Alexander Butt, "Red Lion" Hotel, Stoke Varley, Kent.' That
  sounds like an ultimatum; but it has been appearing at intervals for the last
  month. As the first notice expired about three weeks ago, the question is,
  why doesn't Mr. Butt sell the box and have done with it?"</p>

  <p>"He may have some qualms as to the legality of the proceeding," said
  Thorndyke. "It would be interesting to know what expenses he refers to and
  what is the value of the box."</p>

  <p>The latter question was resolved a day or two later by the appearance in
  our chambers of an agitated gentleman, who gave his name as George Chapman.
  After apologising for his unannounced visit he explained: "I have come to you
  on the advice of my solicitor and on behalf of my brother, Samuel, who has
  become involved in a most extraordinary and horrible set of complications. At
  present he is in custody of the police charged with an atrocious murder."</p>

  <p>"That is certainly a rather serious complication," Thorndyke observed
  dryly. "Perhaps you had better give us an account of the
  circumstances&mdash;the whole set of circumstances, from the beginning."</p>

  <p>"I will," said Mr. Chapman, "without any reservations. The only question
  is, which is the beginning? There are the business and the domestic affairs.
  Perhaps I had better begin with the business concerns. My brother was a sort
  of travelling agent for a firm of manufacturing jewellers. He held a stock of
  the goods, which he used as samples for large orders, but in the case of
  small retailers he actually supplied the goods himself. When travelling, he
  usually carried his stock in a small Gladstone bag, but he kept the bulk of
  it in a safe in his house, and he used to go home at week-ends, or oftener,
  to replenish his travelling stock. Now, about two months ago he left home on
  a trip, but instead of taking a selection of his goods, he took the entire
  stock in a largish wooden box, leaving the safe empty. What he meant to do I
  don't know, and that's the fact. I offer no opinion. The circumstances were
  peculiar, as you will hear presently, and his proceedings were peculiar; for
  he went down to Stoke Varley&mdash;a village not far from
  Folkestone&mdash;put up at the 'Red Lion,' and deposited his box in the
  luggage-room that is kept for the use of commercial travellers; and then,
  after staying there for a few days, came up to London to make some
  arrangements for selling or letting his house&mdash;which, it seems, he had
  decided to leave. He came up in the evening, and the very next morning the
  first of his adventures befell, and a very alarming one it was.</p>

  <p>"It appears that, as he was walking down a quiet street, he saw a lady's
  purse lying on the pavement. Naturally he picked it up, and as it contained
  nothing to show the name or address of the owner, he put it in his pocket,
  intending to hand it in at a police station. Shortly after this, he got into
  an omnibus, and a well-dressed woman entered at the same time and sat down
  next to him. Just as the conductor was coming in to collect the fares, the
  woman began to search her pocket excitedly, and then, turning to my brother,
  called on him loudly to return her purse. Of course, he said that he knew
  nothing about her purse, whereupon she roundly accused him of having picked
  her pocket, declaring to the conductor that she had felt him take out her
  purse, and demanding that the omnibus should be stopped and a policeman
  fetched. At this moment a policeman was seen on the pavement. The conductor
  stopped the omnibus and hailed the constable, who came, and having examined
  the floor of the vehicle without finding the missing purse, and taken the
  conductor's name and number, took my brother into custody and conducted him
  and the woman to the police station. Here the inspector took down from the
  woman a description of the stolen purse and its contents, which my brother,
  to his utter dismay, recognised as that of the purse which he had picked up
  and which was still in his pocket. Immediately, he gave the inspector an
  account of the incident and produced the purse; but it is hardly necessary to
  say that the inspector refused to take his explanation seriously.</p>

  <p>"Then my brother did a thing which was natural enough, but which did not
  help him. Seeing that he was practically certain to be convicted&mdash;for
  there was really no answer to the charge&mdash;he gave a false name and
  refused his address. He was then locked up in a cell for the night, and the
  next morning was brought before the magistrate, who, having heard the
  evidence of the woman and the inspector and having listened without comment
  to my brother's story, committed him for trial at the Central Criminal Court,
  and refused bail. He was then removed to Brixton, where he was detained for
  nearly a month, pending the opening of the sessions.</p>

  <p>"At length the day of his trial drew near. But it was then found that the
  woman who had accused him had left her lodgings and could not be traced. As
  there was no one to prosecute, and as the disappearance of the woman put a
  rather new light upon my brother's story, the case against him was allowed to
  drop, and he was released.</p>

  <p>"He went home by train, and at the station he bought a copy of The Times
  to read on the way. Before opening it he chanced to run his eye over the
  'personal' column, and there his attention was arrested by his own name in an
  advertisement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Relating to a box?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Then you have seen it. Well, considering the value of the
  contents of that box, he was naturally rather anxious. At once he sent off a
  telegram saying that he would call on the following day before noon to claim
  the box and pay what was owing. And he did so. Yesterday morning he took an
  early train down to Stoke Varley and went straight to the 'Red Lion.' On his
  arrival he was asked to step into the coffee-room, which he did; and there he
  found three police officers, who forthwith arrested him on a charge of
  murder. But before going into the particular that charge I had better give
  you an account of his domestic affairs on which this incredible and horrible
  accusation turns.</p>

  <p>"My brother, I am sorry to say, was living with a woman who was not his
  wife. He had originally intended to marry her, but his association with
  her&mdash;which lasted over several years&mdash;did not encourage that
  intention. She was a terrible woman, and she led him a terrible life. Her
  temper was ungovernable; and when she had taken too much to drink&mdash;which
  was a pretty frequent occurrence&mdash;she was not only noisy and
  quarrelsome, but physically violent as well. Her antecedents were
  disreputable&mdash;she had been connected with the seamy side of the
  music-hall stage; her associations were disreputable; she brought
  questionable women to my brother's house; she consorted with men of doubtful
  character, and her relations with them were equally doubtful. Indeed, with
  one of them, a man named Gamble, I should say that her relations were not
  doubtful at all, though I understand he was a married man.</p>

  <p>"Well, my brother put up with her for years, living a life that cut him
  off from all decent society. But at last his patience gave way (and I may add
  that he made the acquaintance of a very desirable lady, who was willing to
  condone his past and marry him if he could secure a possible future). After a
  particularly outrageous scene, he ordered the woman&mdash;Rebecca Mings was
  her name&mdash;out of the house and declared their relationship at an
  end.</p>

  <p>"But she refused to be shaken off. She kept possession of the street-door
  key, and she returned again and again, and made a public scandal. The last
  time she created such an uproar when the door was bolted against her that a
  crowd collected in the street and my brother was forced to let her in. She
  stayed with him some hours, alone in the house&mdash;for the only servant he
  had was a daily girl who left at three o'clock&mdash;and went away quite
  quietly about ten at night. But, although a good many people saw her go into
  the house, no one but my brother seems to have seen her leave it; a most
  disastrous circumstance, for, from the moment when she left the house, no one
  ever saw her again. She did not go to her lodgings that night. She
  disappeared utterly&mdash;until&mdash;but I must go back now to the 'Red
  Lion' at Stoke Varley.</p>

  <p>"When my brother was arrested on the charge of having murdered Rebecca
  Mings, certain particulars were given to him; and when I went down there in
  response to a telegram, I gathered some more. The circumstances are these:
  About a fortnight after my brother had left to come to London, some of the
  'commercials' who used the luggage-room complained of an unpleasant odour in
  it, which was presently traced to my brother's box. As that box appeared to
  have been abandoned, the landlord became suspicious, and communicated with
  the police. They telephoned to the London police, who found my brother's
  house shut up and his whereabouts unknown. Thereupon the local police broke
  open the box and found in it a woman's left arm and a quantity of
  blood-stained clothing. On which they caused the advertisement to be put in
  The Times, and meanwhile they made certain inquiries. It appeared that my
  brother had spent part of his time at Stoke Varley fishing in the little
  river. On learning this, the police proceeded to dredge the river, and
  presently they brought up a right arm&mdash;apparently the fellow of the one
  found in the box&mdash;and a leg divided into three parts, evidently a
  woman's. Now, as to the arm found in the box, there could be no question
  about its identity, for it bore a very distinct tattooed inscription
  consisting of the initials R. M. above a heart transfixed by an arrow, with
  the initials J. B. underneath. A few inquiries elicited the fact that the
  woman, Rebecca Mings, who had disappeared, bore such a tattooed mark on her
  left arm and certain persons who had known her, having been sworn to secrecy,
  were shown the arm, and recognised the mark without hesitation. Further
  inquiries showed that Rebecca Mings was last seen alive entering my brother's
  house, as I have described; and on this information the police broke into the
  house and searched it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if they found anything?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied Chapman, "but I infer that they did. The police at
  Stoke Varley were very courteous and kind, but they declined to give any
  particulars about the visit to the house. However, we shall hear at the
  inquest if they made any discoveries."</p>

  <p>"And is that all that you have to tell us?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply, "and enough, too. I make no comment on my brother's
  story, and I won't ask whether you believe it. I don't expect you to. The
  question is whether you would undertake the defence. I suppose it isn't
  necessary for a lawyer to be convinced of his client's innocence in order to
  convince the jury."</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of an advocate," said Thorndyke. "I am not an advocate,
  and I should not defend a man whom I believed to be guilty. The most that I
  can do is to investigate the case. If the result of the investigation is to
  confirm the suspicions against your brother, I shall, go no farther in the
  case. You will have to get an ordinary criminal barrister to defend your
  brother. If, on the other hand, I find reasonable grounds for believing him
  innocent, I will undertake the defence. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I've no choice," replied Chapman; "and I suppose if you find all the
  evidence against him, the defence won't matter much."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is so," said Thorndyke. "And, now there are one or two
  questions to be cleared up. First, does your brother offer any explanation of
  the presence of these remains in his box?"</p>

  <p>"He supposes that somebody at the 'Red Lion' must have taken the jewellery
  out and put the remains in. Anyone could get access to the luggage-room by
  asking for the key at the office."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "that is conceivable. Then, as to the person who
  might have made this exchange. Is there anyone who had any reason for wishing
  to make away with deceased?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Chapman. "Plenty of people disliked her, but no one but my
  brother had any motive for getting rid of her."</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a man with whom she was on somewhat intimate terms. There
  had been no quarrel or breach there, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"The man Gamble, you mean. No, I should say they were the best of friends.
  Besides, Gamble had no responsibilities in regard to her. He could have
  dropped her whenever he was tired of her."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about him?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Very little. He has been a rolling stone, and has been in all sorts of
  jobs, I believe. He was in the New Zealand trade for some time, and dealt in
  all sorts of things&mdash;among others, in smoked human heads; sold them to
  collectors and museums, I understand. So he would have had some previous
  experience," Chapman added with a faint grin.</p>

  <p>"Not in dismemberment," said Thorndyke. "Those will have been ancient
  Maori heads&mdash;relics of the old head hunters. There are some in the
  Hunterian Museum. But, as you say, there seems to be no motive in Gamble's
  case, even if there had been the opportunity; whereas, in your brother's
  case, there seem to have been both the motive and the opportunity. I suppose
  your brother never threatened the deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say he did," replied Chapman. "On several occasions, and
  before witnesses, too, he threatened to put her out of the way. Of course he
  never meant it&mdash;he was really the mildest of men. But it was a foolish
  thing to do and most unfortunate, as things have turned out."</p>

  <p>"Well." said Thorndyke, "I will look into the matter and let you know what
  I think of it. It is unnecessary to remark that appearances are not very
  encouraging."</p>

  <p>"No, I can see that," said Chapman, rising and producing his card-case.
  "But we must hope for the best." He laid his card on the table, and having
  shaken hands with us gloomily, took his departure.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't do to take things at their face value," I remarked, when he
  had gone; "but I don't think we have ever had a more hopeless-looking case.
  All it wants to complete it is the discovery of remains in Chapman's
  house."</p>

  <p>"In that respect," said Thorndyke, "it may already be complete. But it
  hardly wants that finishing touch. On the evidence that we have, any jury
  would find a verdict of 'guilty' without leaving the box. The only question
  for us is whether the face value of the evidence is its real value. If it is,
  the defence will be a mere formality."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "you will begin the investigation at Stoke
  Varley?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "We begin by checking the alleged facts. If they are
  really as stated, we shall probably need to go no farther. And we had better
  lose no time, as the remains may be moved into the jurisdiction of a London
  coroner, and we ought to see everything in situ as far as possible. I suggest
  that we postpone the rest of to-day's business and start at once, taking
  Scotland Yard on the way to get authority to inspect the remains and the
  premises."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes we were ready for the expedition. While Thorndyke packed
  the "research-case" with the necessary instruments, I gave instructions to
  our laboratory assistant, Polton, as to what was to be done in our absence,
  and then, when we had consulted the time-table, we set forth by way of the
  Embankment.</p>

  <p>At Scotland Yard, on inquiring for our friend, Superintendent Miller, we
  received the slightly unwelcome news that he was at Stoke Varley, inquiring
  into the case. However, the authorisation was given readily enough, and,
  armed with this, we made our way to Charing Cross Station, arriving there in
  good time to catch our train.</p>

  <p>We had just given up our tickets and turned out into the pleasant station
  approach of Stoke Varley when Thorndyke gave a soft chuckle. I looked at him
  inquiringly, and he explained. "Miller has had a telegram, and we are going
  to have facilities, with a little supervision." Following the direction of
  his glance, I now observed the superintendent strolling towards us, trying to
  look surprised, but achieving only a somewhat sheepish grin.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure, gentlemen!" he exclaimed. "This is an unexpected
  pleasure. You don't mean to say you are engaged in this treasure-trove
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you why not," replied Miller. "Because it's no go. You'll
  only waste your time and injure your reputation. I may as well let you know,
  in confidence, that we've been through Chapman's house in London. It wasn't
  very necessary; but still, if there was a vacancy in his coffin for one or
  two more nails, we've knocked them in."</p>

  <p>"What did you find in his house?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"We found," replied Miller, "in a cupboard in his bedroom, a good-sized
  bottle of hyoscine tablets, about two-thirds full&mdash;one-third missing. No
  great harm in that; he might have taken 'em himself. But when we went down
  into the cellar, we noticed that the place smelt&mdash;well, a bit
  graveyardy, so to speak. So we had a look round. It was a stone-floored
  cellar, not very even, but so far as we could see, none of the flagstones
  seemed to have been disturbed. We didn't want the job of digging the whole of
  them up, so I just filled a bucket with water and poured it over the floor.
  Then I watched.</p>

  <p>"In less than a minute one big flagstone near the middle went nearly dry,
  while the water still stood on all the others. 'What O!' says I. 'Loose earth
  underneath here.' So we got a crow-bar and prised up that big flag; and sure
  enough, underneath it we found a good-sized bundle done up in a sheet. I
  won't go into unpleasant particulars&mdash;not that it would upset you, I
  suppose&mdash;but that bundle contained human remains."</p>

  <p>"Any bones?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No. Mostly in'ards and some skin from the front of the body. We handed
  them over to the Home Office experts, and they examined them and made an
  analysis. Their report states that the remains are those of a woman of about
  thirty-five&mdash;that was about Mings' age&mdash;and that the various organs
  contained a large quantity of hyoscine; more than enough to have caused
  death. So there you are. If you are going to conduct the defence, you won't
  get much glory from it."</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, Miller," said Thorndyke, "to have given us this
  private information. It is very helpful, though I have not undertaken the
  defence. I have merely come down to check the facts and see if there is any
  material for a defence. And I shall go through the routine, as I am here.
  Where are the remains?"</p>

  <p>"In the mortuary. I'll show you the way, and as I happen to have the key
  in my pocket, I can let you in."</p>

  <p>We passed through the outskirts of the village, gathering a small train of
  stealthy followers, who dogged us to the door of the mortuary and hungrily
  watched us as the superintendent let us in and locked the door after us.</p>

  <p>"There you are," said Miller, indicating the slate table on which the
  remains lay, covered by a sheet soaked in an antiseptic. "I've seen all I
  want to see." And he retired into a corner and lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>The remnants of mortality, disclosed by the removal of the sheet, were
  dreadfully suggestive of crime in its most brutal and horrible form, but they
  offered little information. The dismemberment had been manifestly rude and
  unskilful, and the remains were clearly those of a woman of medium size and
  apparently in the prime of life. The principal interest centred in the left
  arm, the waxen skin of which bore a very distinct tattoo-mark, consisting of
  the initials R. M. over a very symmetrical heart, transfixed by an arrow,
  beneath which were the initials J. B. The letters were Roman capitals about
  half an inch high, well-formed and finished with serifs, and the heart and
  arrow quite well drawn. I looked reflectively at the device, standing out in
  dull blue from its ivory-like background, and speculated vaguely as to who J.
  B. might have been and how many predecessors and successors he had had. And
  then my interest waned, and I joined the superintendent in the corner. It was
  a sordid case, and a conviction being a foregone conclusion, it did not seem
  to call for further attention.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, however, seemed to think otherwise. But that was his way. When
  he was engaged in an investigation he put out of his mind everything that he
  had been told and began from the very beginning. That was what he was doing
  now. He was inspecting these remains as if they had been the remains of some
  unidentified person. He made, and noted down, minute measurements of the
  limbs; he closely examined every square inch of surface; he scrutinised each
  finger separately, and then with the aid of his portable inking-plate and
  roller, took a complete set of finger-prints. He measured all the dimensions
  of the tattoo-marks with a delicate calliper-gauge, and then examined the
  marks themselves, first with a common lens and then with the high-power
  Coddington. The principles that he laid down in his lectures at the hospital
  were: "Accept no statement without verification; observe every fact
  independently for yourselves; and keep an open mind." And, certainly, no one
  ever carried out more conscientiously his own precepts.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Dr. Jervis," the superintendent whispered to me as Thorndyke
  brought his Coddington to bear on the tattoo-marks, "I believe this lens
  business is becoming a habit with the doctor. It's my firm conviction that if
  somebody were to blow up the Houses of Parliament, he'd go and examine the
  ruins through a magnifying glass. Just look at him poring over those tattooed
  letters that you could read plainly twenty feet away!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Thorndyke, unconscious of these criticisms, placidly continued
  his inspection. From the table, with its gruesome burden, he transferred his
  attention to the box, which had been placed on a bench by the window,
  examining it minutely inside and out; feeling with his fingers the dark grey
  paint with which it was coated and the white-painted initials, "S. C.," on
  the lid, which he also measured carefully. He even copied into his note book
  the maker's name, which was stamped on a small brass label affixed to the
  inside of the lid, and the name of the lock-maker, and inspected the screws
  which had drawn from the wood when it was forced open. At length he put away
  his notebook, closed the research-case and announced that he had finished,
  adding the inquiry: "How do you get to the 'Red Lion' from here?"</p>

  <p>"It's only a few minutes' walk," said Miller. "I'll show you the way. But
  you're wasting your time, doctor, you are indeed. You see," he continued,
  when he had locked up the mortuary and pocketed the key, "that suggestion of
  Chapman's is ridiculous on the face of it. Just imagine a man bringing a
  portmanteau full of human remains into the luggage-room of a commercial
  hotel, opening it and opening another's man's box, and swapping the contents
  of the one for the other with the chance of one of the commercials coming in
  at any moment. Supposing one of 'em had, what would he have had to say?
  'Hallo!' says the baggy, 'you seem to have got somebody's arm in your box.'
  'So I have,' says Chapman. 'I expect it's my wife's. Careless woman! must
  have dropped it in when she was packing the box.' Bah! It's a fool's
  explanation. Besides, how could he have got Chapman's box open? We couldn't.
  It was a first-class lock. We had to break it open, but it hadn't been broken
  open before. No, sir, that cat won't jump. Still, you needn't take my word
  for it. Here is the place, and here is Mr. Butt, himself, standing at his own
  front door looking as pleasant as the flowers in May, like the lump of sugar
  that you put in a fly-trap to induce 'em to walk in."</p>

  <p>The landlord, who had overheard&mdash;without difficulty&mdash;the
  concluding passage of Miller's peroration, smiled genially; and when the
  purpose of the visit had been explained, suggested a "modest quencher" in the
  private parlour as an aid to conversation.</p>

  <p>"I wanted," said Thorndyke, waiving the suggestion of the 'quencher,' "to
  ascertain whether Chapman's theory of an exchange of contents could be
  seriously entertained."</p>

  <p>Well, sir," said the landlord, "the fact is that it couldn't. That room is
  a public room, and people may be popping in there at any time all day. We
  don't usually keep it locked. It isn't necessary. We know most of our
  customers, and the contents of the packages that are stowed in the room are
  principally travellers' samples of no considerable value. The thing would
  have been impossible in the daytime, and we lock the room up at night."</p>

  <p>"Have you had any strangers staying with you in the interval between
  Chapman's going away and the discovery of the remains?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There was a Mr. Doler; he had two cabin trunks: and a uniform case
  which went to the luggage-room. And then there was a lady, Mrs. Murchison.
  She had a lot of stuff in there: a small, flat trunk, a hat-box, and a big
  dress-basket&mdash;one of these great basket pantechnicons that ladies take
  about with them. And there was another gentleman&mdash;I forget his name, but
  you will see it in the visitors' book&mdash;he had a couple of largish
  portmanteaux in there. Perhaps you would like to see the book?"</p>

  <p>"I should," said Thorndyke, and when the book was produced and the names
  of the guests pointed out, he copied the entries into his notebook, adding
  the particulars of their luggage.</p>

  <p>"And now, sir," said Miller, "I suppose you won't be happy until you've
  seen the room itself?"</p>

  <p>"Your insight is really remarkable, superintendent," my colleague replied.
  "Yes, I should like to see the room."</p>

  <p>There was little enough to see, however, when we arrived there. The key
  was in the door, and the latter was not only unlocked but stood ajar; and
  when we pushed it open and entered we saw a small room, empty save for a
  collection of portmanteaux, trunks, and Gladstone bags. The only noteworthy
  fact was that it was at the end of a corridor, covered with linoleum, so that
  anyone inside would have a few seconds' notice of another person's approach.
  But evidently that would have been of little use in the alleged
  circumstances. For the hypothetical criminal must have emptied Chapman's box
  of the jewellery before he could put the incriminating objects into it; so
  that, apart from the latter, the arrival of an inopportune visitor would have
  found him apparently in the act of committing a robbery. The suggestion was
  obviously absurd.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, as we descended the stairs, "where is the
  central character of this drama&mdash;Chapman? He is not here, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is," replied Miller. "He is committed for trial, but we are
  keeping him here until we know where the inquest is to be held. You would
  probably like to have a few words with him? Well, I'll take you along to the
  police station and tell them who you are, and then perhaps you would like to
  come back here and have some lunch or dinner before you return to town."</p>

  <p>I warmly seconded the latter proposal, and the arrangement having been
  made, we set forth for the police station, which we gathered from Miller was
  incorporated with a small local prison. Here we were shown into what appeared
  to be a private office, and presently a sergeant entered, ushering in a man
  whom we at once recognised from his resemblance to our client, Mr. George
  Chapman, disguised though it was by his pallor, his unshaven face, and his
  air of abject misery. The sergeant, having announced him by name, withdrew
  with the superintendent and locked the door on the outside. As soon as we
  were alone, Thorndyke rapidly acquainted the prisoner with the circumstances
  of his brother's visit and then continued: "Now, Mr. Chapman, you want me to
  undertake your defence. If I do so, I must have all the facts. If there is
  anything known to you that your brother has not told me, I ask you to tell it
  to me without reservation."</p>

  <p>Chapman shook his head wearily.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing more than you know," said he. "The whole affair is a
  mystery that I can make nothing of. I don't expect you to believe me. Who
  would, with all this evidence against me? But I swear to God that I know
  nothing of this abominable crime. When I brought that box down here, it
  contained my stock of jewellery and nothing else; and after I put it in the
  luggage-room, I never opened it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know of anybody who might have had a motive for getting rid of
  Rebecca Mings?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," replied Chapman. "She led me the devil's own life, but she
  was popular enough with her own friends. And she was an attractive woman in
  her way: a fine, well-built woman, rather big&mdash;she stood
  five-feet-seven&mdash;with a good complexion and very handsome golden hair.
  Such as her friends were&mdash;they were a shady lot&mdash;I think they were
  fond of her, and I don't believe she had any enemies."</p>

  <p>"Some hyoscine was found in your house," said Thorndyke. "Do you know
  anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I got it when I suffered from neuralgia. But I never took any. My
  doctor heard about it and sent me to the dentist. The bottle was never
  opened. It contained a hundred tablets."</p>

  <p>"And with regard to the box," said Thorndyke. "Had you had it long?"</p>

  <p>"Not very long. I bought it at Fletchers, in Holborn, about six months
  ago."</p>

  <p>"And you have nothing more to tell us?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "I wish I had;" and then, after a pause, he asked with a
  wistful look at Thorndyke: "Are you going to undertake my defence, sir? I can
  see that there is very little hope, but I should like to be given just a
  chance."</p>

  <p>I glanced at Thorndyke, expecting at the most a cautious and conditional
  reply. To my astonishment he answered: "There is no need to take such a
  gloomy view of the case, Mr. Chapman. I shall undertake the defence, and I
  think you have quite a fair chance of an acquittal."</p>

  <p>On this amazing reply I reflected, not without some self-condemnation,
  during our walk to the hotel and the meal that preceded our departure. For it
  was evident that I had missed something vital. Thorndyke was a cautious man
  and little given to making promises or forecasts of results. He must have
  picked up some evidence of a very conclusive kind; but what that evidence
  could be, I found it impossible to imagine. The superintendent, too, was
  puzzled, I could see, for Thorndyke made no secret of his intention to go on
  with the case. But Miller's delicate attempts to pump him came to nothing;
  and when he had escorted us to the station and our train moved off, I could
  see him standing on the platform, gently scratching the back of his head and
  gazing speculatively at our retreating carriage.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were clear of the station, I opened my attack.</p>

  <p>"What on earth," I demanded, "did you mean by giving that poor devil,
  Chapman, hopes of acquittal? I can't see that he has a dog's chance."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me gravely.</p>

  <p>"My impression is, Jervis." he said, "that you have not kept an open mind
  in this case. You have allowed yourself to fall under the suggestive
  influence of the obvious; whereas the function of the investigator is to
  consider the possible alternatives of the obvious inference. And you have not
  brought your usual keen attention to bear on the facts. If you had considered
  George Chapman's statement attentively you would have noticed that it
  contained some very curious and significant suggestions; and if you had
  examined those dismembered remains critically, you would have seen that they
  confirmed those suggestions in a very remarkable manner."</p>

  <p>"As to George Chapman's statement," said I, "the only suggestive point
  that I recall is the reference to those Maori heads. But, as you, yourself,
  pointed out, the dealers in those heads don't do the dismemberment."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, Jervis," said he, "that isn't the point at all. Any fool can
  cut up a dead body as this one has been cut up. The point is that that
  statement, carefully considered, yields a definite and consistent alternative
  to the theory that Samuel Chapman killed this woman and dismembered her body;
  and that alternative theory is supported by the appearance of these remains.
  I think you will see the point if you recall Chapman's statement, and reflect
  on the possible bearing of the various incidents that he described."</p>

  <p>In this, however, Thorndyke was unduly optimistic. I recalled the
  statement completely enough, and reflected on it frequently and profoundly
  during the next few days; but the more I thought of it the more conclusive
  did the case against the accused appear.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, my colleague appeared to be taking no steps in the matter, and
  I assumed that he was waiting for the inquest. It is true that, when, on one
  occasion, he had accompanied me towards the City, and leaving me in Queen
  Victoria Street disappeared into the premises of Messrs. Burden Brothers,
  lock manufacturers, I was inclined to associate his proceedings with his
  minute examination of the lock at Stoke Varley. And, again, when our
  laboratory assistant, Polton, was seen to issue forth, top-hatted and armed
  with an umbrella and an attach-case, I suspected some sort of "private
  inquiries," possibly connected with the case. But from Thorndyke I could get
  no information at all. My tentative "pumpings" elicited one unvarying reply.
  "You have the facts, Jervis. You heard George Chapman's statement, and you
  have seen the remains. Give me a reasonable theory and I will discuss it with
  pleasure." And that was how the matter remained. I had no reasonable
  theory&mdash;other than that of the police&mdash;and there was accordingly no
  discussion.</p>

  <p>On a certain evening, a couple of days before the inquest&mdash;which had
  been postponed in the hope that some further remains might be
  discovered&mdash;I observed signs of an expected visitor: a small table
  placed by the supernumerary arm-chair and furnished with a tray bearing a
  siphon, a whisky-decanter and a box of cigars. Thorndyke caught my inquiring
  glance at these luxuries, for which neither of us had any use, and proceeded
  to explain.</p>

  <p>"I have asked Miller to look in this evening&mdash;he is due now. I have
  been working at this Chapman case, and, as it is now complete, I propose to
  lay my cards on the table."</p>

  <p>"Is that safe?" said I. "Supposing the police still go for a conviction
  and try to forestall your evidence?"</p>

  <p>"They won't," he replied. "They couldn't. And it would be most improper to
  let the case go for trial on a false theory. But here is Miller; and a mighty
  twitter he is in, I have no doubt."</p>

  <p>He was. Without even waiting for the customary cigar, he plumped down into
  the chair, and dragging a letter from his pocket, fixed a glare of
  astonishment on my placid colleague.</p>

  <p>"This letter of yours, sir," said he, "is perfectly incomprehensible to
  me. You say that you are prepared to put us in possession of the facts of
  this Chapman case. But we are in possession of the facts already. We are
  absolutely certain of a conviction. Let me remind you, sir, of what those
  facts are. We have got a dead body which has been identified beyond all
  doubt. Part of that body was found in a box which is the property of Samuel
  Chapman, which was brought by him and deposited by him at the 'Red Lion
  'Hotel. Another part of that body was found in his dwelling-house. A supply
  of poison&mdash;an uncommon poison, too&mdash;similar to that which killed
  the dead person, has also been found in his house; and the dead body is that
  of a woman with whom Chapman was known to be on terms of enmity and whom he
  has threatened, in the presence of witnesses, to kill. Now, sir, what have
  you got to say to those facts?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded the agitated detective with a quiet smile. "My
  comments, "Miller," said he, "can be put in a nut-shell. You have got the
  wrong man, you have got the wrong box, and you have got the wrong body."</p>

  <p>The superintendent was thunderstruck, and no wonder. So was I. As to
  Miller, he drew himself forward until he was sitting on the extreme edge of
  the chair, and for some moments stared at my impassive colleague in
  speechless amazement. At length he burst out: "But, my dear sir! This is
  sheer nonsense&mdash;at least, that's what it sounds like, though I know it
  can't be. Let's begin with the body. You say it's the wrong one."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Rebecca Mings was a biggish woman. Her height was five-feet-seven.
  This woman was not more than five-feet-four."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" exclaimed Miller. "You can't judge to an inch or two from parts of
  a dismembered body. You are forgetting the tattoo-mark. That clenches the
  identity beyond any possible doubt."</p>

  <p>"It does, indeed," said Thorndyke. "That is the crucial evidence. Rebecca
  Mings had a certain tattoo mark on her left forearm. This woman had not."</p>

  <p>"Had not!" shrieked Miller, coming yet farther forward on his chair. (I
  expected, every moment, to see him sitting on the floor.) "Why, I saw it; and
  so did you."</p>

  <p>"I am speaking of the woman, not of the body," said Thorndyke. "The mark
  that you saw was a post-mortem tattoo-mark. It was made after death. But the
  fact that it was made after death is good evidence, that it was not there
  during life."</p>

  <p>"Moses!" exclaimed the superintendent. "This is a facer. Are you perfectly
  sure it was done after death?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure. The appearance, through a powerful lens, is unmistakable.
  Tattoo-marks are made, as you know, of course, by painting Indian ink on the
  skin and pricking it in with fine needles. In the living skin the
  needle-wounds heal up at once and disappear, but in the dead skin the
  needle-holes remain unclosed and can be easily seen with a lens. In this case
  the skin had been well washed and the surface pressed with some smooth
  object; but the holes were plainly visible and the ink was still in
  them."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure!" said Miller. "I never heard of tattooing a dead body
  before."</p>

  <p>"Very few people have, I expect," said Thorndyke. "But there is one class
  of persons who know all about it: the persons who deal in Maori heads."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" queried Miller. "How does it concern them?"</p>

  <p>"Those heads are usually elaborately tattooed, and the value of a head
  depends on the quality of the tattooing. Now, when those heads became objects
  of trade, the dealers conceived the idea of touching up defective specimens
  by additional tattooing on the dead head, and from this they proceeded to
  obtain heads which had no tattoo-marks, and turn them into tattooed
  heads."</p>

  <p>"Well, to be sure," said the superintendent, with a grin, "what wicked men
  there are in the world, aren't there, Dr. Jervis?"</p>

  <p>I murmured a vague assent, but I was principally conscious of a desire to
  kick myself for having failed to pick this invaluable clue out of George
  Chapman's statement.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Miller, "we come to the box. How do you know it is the
  wrong one?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "is proved even more conclusively. The original
  box was made by Fletchers, in Holborn. It was sold to Chapman, and his
  initials painted on it, on the 9th of last April. I have seen the entry in
  the day-book. The locks of these boxes are made by Burden Brothers of Queen
  Victoria Street, and as they are quite high-class locks each is given a
  registered number, which is stamped on the lock. The number on the box that
  you have is 5007, and Burden's books show that it was made and sold to
  Fletchers about the middle of July&mdash;the sale was dated the 13th.
  Therefore this can not be Chapman's box."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," Miller agreed. "But whose box is it? And what has become
  of Chapman's box?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "was presumably taken away in Mrs. Murchison's
  dress-basket."</p>

  <p>"Then who the deuce is Mrs. Murchison?" demanded the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I should say," replied Thorndyke, "that she was formerly known as Rebecca
  Mings."</p>

  <p>"The deceased!" exclaimed Miller, falling back in his chair with a guffaw.
  "My eye! What a lark it is! But she must have some sauce, to walk off with
  the jewellery and leave her own dismembered remains in exchange! By the way,
  whose remains are they?"</p>

  <p>"We shall come to that presently," Thorndyke answered. "Now we have to
  consider the man you have in custody."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miller, "we must settle about him. Of course if it isn't his
  box, and the body isn't Mings' body, that puts him out of it so far. But
  there are those remains that we dug up in his cellar. What about them?"</p>

  <p>"That question," replied Thorndyke, "will, I think, be answered by a
  general review of the case. But I must, remind you that if the box is not
  Chapman's, it is some other person's; that is to say, that if Chapman goes
  out of the case, as to the Stoke Varley incidents, someone else comes in. So,
  if the body is not Mings' body, it is some other woman's, and that other
  woman must have disappeared. And now let us review the case as a whole.</p>

  <p>"You know about the pocket-picking charge. It was obviously a false
  charge, deliberately prepared by 'planting' the purse; that is, it was a
  conspiracy. Now what was the object of this conspiracy? Clearly it was to get
  Chapman out of the way while the boxes were exchanged at Stoke Varley, and
  the remains deposited in the river and elsewhere. Then who were the
  conspirators&mdash;other than the agent who planted the purse?</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;if there were more than one&mdash;must have had access to
  Mings, dead or alive, in order to make the exact copy, or tracing, of her
  tattoo-mark. They must have had some knowledge of the process of post-mortem
  tattooing. They must have had access to Chapman's house. And, since they had
  in their possession the dead body of a woman, they must have been associated
  with some woman who has disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Who is there who answers this description? Well, of course, Mings had
  access to herself, though she could hardly have taken a tracing from her own
  arm, and she had access to Chapman's house, since she had possession of the
  latchkey. Then there is a man named Gamble, with whom Mings was on terms of
  great intimacy. Now Gamble was formerly a dealer in tattooed Maori heads, so
  he may be assumed to know something about post-mortem tattooing. And I have
  ascertained that Gamble's wife has disappeared from her usual places of
  resort. So here are two persons who, together, agree with the description of
  the conspirators. And now let us consider the train of events in connection
  with the dates.</p>

  <p>"On July the 29th Chapman came to town from Stoke Varley. On the 30th he
  was arrested as a pick pocket. On the 31st he was committed for trial. On the
  2nd of August Mrs. Gamble went away to the country. No one seems to have seen
  her go, but that is the date on which she is reported to have gone. On August
  the 5th Mrs. Murchison deposited at Stoke Varley a box which must have been
  purchased between the 13th of July and the 4th of August, and which contained
  a woman's arm. On the 14th of August that box was opened by the police. On
  the 18th human remains were discovered in Chapman's house. On the 27th
  Chapman was released from Brixton. On the 28th he was arrested for murder at
  Stoke Varley. I think, Miller, you will agree that that is a very striking
  succession of dates."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed. "It looks like a true bill. If you will give me Mr.
  Gamble's address, I'll call on him."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you won't find him at home," said Thorndyke. "He has gone into
  the country, too; and I gather from his landlord, who holds a returned
  cheque, that Mr. Gamble's banking account has gone into the country with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the superintendent "I suppose I must take a trip into the
  country, too."</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I said, as I laid down the paper containing the report
  of the trial of Gamble and Mings for the murder of Theresa Gamble, one
  morning about four months later, "you ought to be very highly gratified.
  After sentencing Gamble to death and Mings to fifteen years' penal servitude,
  the judge took the opportunity to compliment the police on their ingenuity in
  unravelling this crime, and the Home Office experts on their skill in
  detecting the counterfeit tattoo-marks. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that his lordship showed a very proper and
  appreciative spirit."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7"></a>THE TRAIL OF BEHEMOTH</h2>

  <p class="first">OF all the minor dissipations in which temperate men indulge
  there is none, I think, more alluring than the after-breakfast pipe. I had
  just lit mine and was standing before the fire with the unopened paper in my
  hand when my ear caught the sound of hurried footsteps ascending the stair.
  Now experience has made me somewhat of a connoisseur in footsteps. A good
  many are heard on our stair, heralding the advent of a great variety of
  clients, and I have learned to distinguish those which are premonitory of
  urgent cases. Such I judged the present ones to be, and my judgment was
  confirmed by a hasty, importunate tattoo on our small brass knocker,
  Regretfully taking the much-appreciated pipe from my mouth, I crossed the
  room and threw the door open.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Dr. Jervis," said our visitor, a barrister whom I knew
  slightly. "Is your colleague at home?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Bidwell," I replied. "I am sorry to say he is out of town. He
  won't be back until the day after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bidwell was visibly disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Pity!" he exclaimed; and then with quick tact he added. "But still,
  you are here. It comes to the same thing."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," said I. "But, at any rate, I am at your
  service."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said he. "And in that case I will ask you to come round with
  me at once to Tanfield Court. A most shocking thing has happened. My old
  friend and neighbour, Giles Herrington has been&mdash;well, he is
  dead&mdash;died suddenly, and I think there can be no doubt that he was
  killed. Can you come now? I will give you the particulars as we go."</p>

  <p>I scribbled a hasty note to say where I had gone, and having laid it on
  the table, got my hat and set forth with Mr. Bidwell.</p>

  <p>"It has only just been discovered," said he, as we crossed King's Bench
  Walk. "The laundress who does his chambers and mine was battering at my door
  when I arrived&mdash;I don't live in the Temple, you know. She was as pale as
  a ghost and in an awful state of alarm and agitation. It seems that she had
  gone up to Herrington's chambers to get his breakfast ready as usual; but
  when she went into the sitting-room she found him lying dead on the floor.
  Thereupon she rushed down to my chambers&mdash;I am usually an early
  bird&mdash;and there I found her, as I said, battering at my door, although
  she has a key.</p>

  <p>"Well, I went up with her to my friend's chambers&mdash;they are on the
  first floor, just over mine&mdash;and there, sure enough, was poor old Giles
  lying on the floor, cold and stiff. Evidently he had been lying there all
  night."</p>

  <p>"Were there any marks of violence on the body?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice any," he replied, "but I didn't look very closely. What I
  did notice was that the place was all in disorder&mdash;a chair overturned
  and things knocked off the table. It was pretty evident that there had been a
  struggle and that he had not met his death by fair means."</p>

  <p>"And what do you want us to do?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "I was Herrington's friend; about the only friend he
  had, for he was not an amiable or a sociable man; and I am the executor of
  his will.</p>

  <p>"Appearances suggest very strongly that he has been murdered, and I take
  it upon myself to see that his murderer is brought to account. Our friendship
  seems to demand that. Of course, the police will go into the affair, and if
  it turns out to be all plain sailing, there will be nothing for you to do.
  But the murderer, if there is one, has got to be secured and convicted, and
  if the police can't manage it, I want you and Thorndyke to see the case
  through. This is the place."</p>

  <p>He hurried in through the entry and up the stairs to the first-floor
  landing, where he rapped loudly at the closed "oak" of a set of chambers
  above which was painted the name of "Mr. Giles Herrington."</p>

  <p>After an interval, during which Mr. Bidwell repeated the summons, the
  massive door opened and a familiar face looked out: the face of Inspector
  Badger of the Criminal Investigation Department. The expression that it bore
  was not one of welcome, and my experience of the inspector caused me to brace
  myself up for the inevitable contest.</p>

  <p>"What is your business?" he inquired forbiddingly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bidwell took the question to himself and replied: "I am Mr.
  Herrington's executor, and in that capacity I have instructed Dr. Jervis and
  his colleague, Dr. Thorndyke, to watch the case on my behalf. I take it that
  you are a police officer?"</p>

  <p>"I am," replied Badger, "and I can't admit any unauthorised persons to
  these chambers."</p>

  <p>"We are not unauthorised persons," said Mr. Bidwell. "We are here on
  legitimate business. Do I understand that you refuse admission to the legal
  representatives of the deceased man?"</p>

  <p>In the face of Mr. Bidwell's firm and masterful attitude, Badger began, as
  usual, to weaken. Eventually, having warned us to convey no information to
  anybody, he grudgingly opened the door and admitted us.</p>

  <p>"I have only just arrived, myself," he said. "I happened to be in the
  porter's lodge on other business when the laundress came and gave the
  alarm."</p>

  <p>As I stepped into the room and looked round, I saw at a glance the clear
  indications of a crime. The place was in the utmost disorder. The cloth had
  been dragged from the table, littering the floor with broken glass, books, a
  tobacco jar, and various other objects. A chair sprawled on its back, the
  fender was dislodged from its position, the hearth-rug was all awry; and in
  the midst of the wreckage, on the space of floor between the table and the
  fireplace, the body of a man was stretched in a not uneasy posture.</p>

  <p>I stooped over him and looked him over searchingly; an elderly man,
  clean-shaved and slightly bald, with a grim, rather forbidding countenance,
  which was not, however, distorted or apparently unusual in expression. There
  were no obvious injuries, but the crumpled state of the collar caused me to
  look more closely at the throat and neck, and I then saw pretty plainly a
  number of slightly discoloured marks, such as would be made by fingers
  tightly grasping the throat. Evidently Badger had already observed them, for
  he remarked: "There's no need to ask you what he died of, doctor; I can see
  that for myself."</p>

  <p>"The actual cause of death," said I, "is not quite evident. He doesn't
  appear to have died from suffocation, but those are very unmistakable marks
  on the throat."</p>

  <p>"Uncommonly," agreed Badger; "and they are enough for my purpose without
  any medical hair-splittings. How long do you think he has been dead?"</p>

  <p>"From nine to twelve hours," I replied, "but nearer nine, I should
  think."</p>

  <p>The inspector looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"That makes it between nine o'clock and midnight, but nearer midnight,"
  said he. "Well, we shall hear if the night porter has anything to tell us.
  I've sent word for him to come over, and the laundress, too. And here is one
  of 'em."</p>

  <p>It was, in fact, both of them, for when the inspector opened the door,
  they were discovered conversing eagerly in whispers. "One at a time," said
  Badger. "I'll have the porter in first;" and having admitted the man, he
  unceremoniously shut the door on the woman. The night porter saluted me as he
  came in&mdash;we were old acquaintances&mdash;and then halted near the door,
  where he stood stiffly, with his eyes riveted on the corpse.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Badger, "I want you to try to remember if you let in any
  strangers last night, and if so, what their business was."</p>

  <p>"I remember quite well," the porter replied. "I let in three strangers
  while I was on duty. One was going to Mr. Bolter in Fig Tree Court, one was
  going to Sir Alfred Blain's chambers, and the third said he had an
  appointment with Mr. Herrington."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Badger, rubbing his hands. "Now, what time did you let him
  in?"</p>

  <p>"It was just after ten-fifteen."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us what he was like and how he was dressed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "He didn't know where Tanfield Court was, and I had
  to walk down and show him, so I was able to have a good look at him. He was a
  middle-sized man, rather thin, dark hair, small moustache, no beard, and he
  had a long, sharp nose with a bump on the bridge. He wore a soft felt hat, a
  loose light overcoat, and he carried a thickish rough stick."</p>

  <p>"What class of man was he? Seem to be a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"He was quite a gentlemanly kind of man, so far as I could judge, but he
  looked a bit shabby as to his clothes."</p>

  <p>"Did you let him out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He came to the gate a few minutes before eleven."</p>

  <p>"And did you notice anything unusual about him then?"</p>

  <p>"I did," the porter replied impressively. "I noticed that his collar was
  all crumpled and his hat was dusty and dented. His face was a bit red, and he
  looked rather upset, as if he had been having a tussle with somebody. I
  looked at him particularly and wondered what had been happening, seeing that
  Mr. Herrington was a quiet, elderly gentleman, though he was certainly a bit
  peppery at times."</p>

  <p>The inspector took down these particulars gleefully in a large notebook
  and asked: "Is that all you know of the affair?" And when the porter replied
  that it was, he said: "Then I will ask you to read this statement and sign
  your name below it."</p>

  <p>The porter read through his statement and carefully signed his name at the
  foot. He was about to depart when Badger said: "Before you go, perhaps you
  had better help us to move the body into the bedroom. It isn't decent to
  leave it lying there."</p>

  <p>Accordingly the four of us lifted the dead man and carried him into the
  bedroom, where we laid him on the undisturbed bed and covered him with a rug.
  Then the porter was dismissed, with instructions to send in Mrs. Runt.</p>

  <p>The laundress's statement was substantially a repetition of what Mr.
  Bidwell had told me. She had let herself into the chambers in the usual way,
  had come suddenly on the dead body of the tenant, and had forthwith rushed
  downstairs to give the alarm. When she had concluded the inspector stood for
  a few moments looking thoughtfully at his notes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said presently, "you haven't looked round these chambers
  this morning? Can't say if there is anything unusual about them, or anything
  missing?"</p>

  <p>The laundress shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I was too upset," she said, with another furtive glance at the place
  where the corpse had lain; "but," she added, letting her eyes roam vaguely
  round the room, "there doesn't seem to be anything missing, so far as I can
  see&mdash;wait! Yes, there is. There's something gone from that nail on the
  wall; and it was there yesterday morning, because I remember dusting it."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Badger. "Now what was it that was hanging on that
  nail?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Mrs. Runt replied hesitatingly, "I really don't know what it was.
  Seemed like a sort of sword or dagger, but I never looked at it particularly,
  and I never took it off its nail. I used to dust it as it hung."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Badger, "you can give us some sort of description of it, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I can," she replied. "It had a leather case, and the
  handle was covered with leather, I think, and it had a sort of loop, and it
  used to hang on that nail."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you said that before," Badger commented sourly. "When you say it had
  a case, do you mean a sheath?"</p>

  <p>"You can call it a sheath if you like," she retorted, evidently ruffled by
  the inspector's manner. "I call it a case."</p>

  <p>"And how big was it? How long, for instance?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Runt held out her hands about a yard apart, looked at them
  critically, shortened the interval to a foot, extended it to two, and still
  varying the distance, looked vaguely at the inspector.</p>

  <p>"I should say it was about that," she said.</p>

  <p>"About what?" snorted Badger. "Do you mean a foot or two feet or a yard?
  Can't you give us some idea?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say no clearer than what I have," she snapped. "I don't go round
  gentlemen's chambers measuring the things."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that Badger's questions were rather unnecessary, for the
  wall-paper below the nail gave the required information. A coloured patch on
  the faded ground furnished a pretty clear silhouette of a broad bladed sword
  or large dagger, about two feet six inches long, which had apparently hung
  from the nail by a loop or ring at the end of the handle. But it was not my
  business to point this out. I turned to Bidwell and asked:</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us what the thing was?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't," he replied. "I have very seldom been in these
  chambers. Herrington and I usually met in mine and went to the club. I have a
  dim recollection of something hanging on that nail, but I have not the least
  idea what it was or what it was like. But do you think it really matters? The
  thing was almost certainly a curio of some kind. It couldn't have been of any
  appreciable value. It is absurd, on the face of it, to suppose that this man
  came to Herrington's chambers, apparently by appointment, and murdered him
  for the sake of getting possession of an antique sword or dagger. Don't you
  think so?"</p>

  <p>I did, and so, apparently, did the inspector, with the qualification that
  the thing seemed to have disappeared, and its disappearance ought to be
  accounted for; which was perfectly true, though I did not quite see how the
  "accounting for" was to be effected. However, as the laundress had told all
  that she knew, Badger gave her her dismissal and she retired to the landing,
  where I noticed that the night porter was still lurking. Mr. Bidwell also
  took his departure, and happening, a few moments later, to glance out of the
  window, I saw him walking slowly across the court, apparently conferring with
  the laundress and the porter.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were alone, Badger assumed a friendly and confidential
  manner and proceeded to give advice.</p>

  <p>"I gather that Mr. Bidwell wants you to investigate this case, but I don't
  fancy it is in your line at all. It is just a matter of tracing that stranger
  and getting hold of him. Then we shall have to find out what property there
  was on these premises. The laundress says that there is nothing missing, but
  of course no one supposes that the man came here to take the furniture. It is
  most probable that the motive was robbery of some kind. There's no sign of
  anything broken open; but then, there wouldn't be, as the keys were
  available."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he prowled round the room, examining every receptacle that
  had a lock and trying the drawers of the writing-table and of what looked
  like a file cabinet.</p>

  <p>"You will have your work cut out," I remarked, "to trace that man. The
  porter's description was pretty vague."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied; "there isn't much to go on. That's where you come in,"
  he added with a grin, "with your microscopes and air-pumps and things. Now if
  Dr. Thorndyke was here he would just sweep a bit of dust from the floor and
  collect any stray oddments and have a good look at them through his
  magnifier, and then we should know all about it. Can't you do a bit in that
  line? There's plenty of dust on the floor. And here's a pin. Wonderful
  significant thing is a pin. And here's a wax vesta; now, that ought to tell
  you quite a lot. And here is the end of a leather boot-lace&mdash;at least,
  that is what it looks like. That must have come out of somebody's boot. Have
  a look at it, doctor, and see if you can tell me what kind of boot it came
  out of and whose boot it was."</p>

  <p>He laid the fragment, and the match, and the pin on the table and grinned
  at me somewhat offensively. Inwardly I resented his
  impertinence&mdash;perhaps the more so since I realised that Thorndyke would
  probably not have been so completely gravelled as I undoubtedly was. But I
  considered it politic to take his clumsy irony in good part, and even to
  carry on his elephantine joke. Accordingly, I picked up the three "clues,"
  one after the other, and examined them gravely, noting that the supposed
  boot-lace appeared to be composed of whalebone or vulcanite.</p>

  <p>"Well, inspector," I said. "I can't give you the answer off-hand. There's
  no microscope here. But I will examine these objects at my leisure and let
  you have the information in due course."</p>

  <p>With that I wrapped them with ostentatious care in a piece of note and
  bestowed them in my pocket, a proceeding which the inspector watched with a
  sour smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll be too late," said he. "Our men will probably pick up
  the tracks while you are doing the microscope stunt. However, I mustn't stay
  here any longer. We can't do anything until we know what valuables there were
  on the premises; and I must have the body removed and examined by the police
  surgeon."</p>

  <p>He moved towards the door, and as I had no further business in the rooms,
  I followed, and leaving him to lock up, I took my way back to our
  chambers.</p>

  <p>When Thorndyke returned to town a couple of days later, I mentioned the
  case to him. But what Badger had said appeared to be true. It was a case of
  ascertaining the identity of the stranger who had visited the dead man on
  that fatal night, and this seemed to be a matter for the police rather than
  for us. So the case remained in abeyance until the evening following the
  inquest, when Mr. Bidwell called on us, accompanied by a Mr. Carston, whom he
  introduced as an old friend of his and of Herrington's family.</p>

  <p>"I have called," he said, "to bring you a full report of the evidence at
  the inquest. I had a shorthand writer there, and this is a typed transcript
  of his notes. Nothing fresh transpired beyond what Dr. Jervis knows and has
  probably told you, but I thought you had better have all the information in
  writing."</p>

  <p>"There is no clue as to who the suspicious visitor was, I suppose?" said
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," replied Bidwell. "The porter's description is all
  they have to go on, and of course it would apply to hundreds of persons. But,
  in connection with that, there is a question on which I should like to take
  your opinion. Poor Herrington once mentioned to me that he was subjected to a
  good deal of annoyance by a certain person who from time to time applied to
  him for financial help. I gathered that some sort of claim was advanced, and
  that the demands for money were more or less of the nature of blackmail.
  Giles didn't say who the person was, but I got the impression that he was a
  relative. Now, my friend Carston, who attended the inquest with me, noticed
  that the porter's description of the stranger would apply fairly well to a
  nephew of Giles's, whom he knows slightly and who is a somewhat shady
  character; and the question that Carston and I have been debating is whether
  these facts ought to be communicated to the police. It is a serious matter to
  put a man under suspicion on such very slender data; and yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet," said Carston, "the facts certainly fit the circumstances. This
  fellow&mdash;his name is Godfrey Herrington&mdash;is a typical ne'er-do-weel.
  Nobody knows how he lives. He doesn't appear to do any work. And then there
  is the personality of the deceased. I didn't know Giles Herrington very well,
  but I knew his brother, Sir Gilbert, pretty intimately, and if Giles was at
  all like him, a catastrophe might easily have occurred."</p>

  <p>"What was Sir Gilbert's special characteristic?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Unamiability," was the reply. "He was a most cantankerous, overbearing
  man, and violent at times. I knew him when I was at the Colonial Office with
  him, and one of his official acts will show the sort of man he was. You may
  remember it, Bidwell&mdash;the Bekw affair. There was some trouble in Bekw,
  which is one of the minor kingdoms bordering on Ashanti, and Sir Gilbert was
  sent out as a special commissioner to settle it. And settle it he did with a
  vengeance. He took up an armed force, deposed the king of Bekw, seized the
  royal stool, message stick, state sword, drums, and the other insignia of
  royalty, and brought them away with him. And what made it worse was that he
  treated these important things as mere loot kept some of them himself and
  gave away others as presents to his friends.</p>

  <p>"It was an intolerably high-handed proceeding, and it caused a rare
  outcry. Even the Colonial Governor protested, and in the end the Secretary of
  State directed the Governor to reinstate the king and restore the stolen
  insignia, as these things went with the royal title and were necessary for
  the ceremonies of reinstatement or the accession of a new king."</p>

  <p>"And were they restored?" asked Bidwell.</p>

  <p>"Most of them were. But just about this time Gilbert died, and as the
  whereabouts of one or two of them were unknown, it was impossible to collect
  them then. I don't know if they have been found since."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke led Mr. Carston back to the point from which he had
  digressed.</p>

  <p>"You are suggesting that certain peculiarities of temper and temperament
  on the part of the deceased might have some bearing on the circumstances of
  his death."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Carston. "If Giles Herrington was at all like his
  brother&mdash;I don't know whether he was&mdash;" here he looked inquiringly
  at Bidwell, who nodded emphatically.</p>

  <p>"I should say he was, undoubtedly," said he. "He was my friend, and I was
  greatly attached to him; but to others, I must admit, he must have appeared a
  decidedly morose, cantankerous, and irascible man."</p>

  <p>"Very well," resumed Carston. "If you imagine this cadging, blackmailing
  wastrel calling on him and trying to squeeze him, and then you imagine
  Herrington refusing to be squeezed and becoming abusive and even violent, you
  have a fair set of antecedents for&mdash;for what, in fact, did happen."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "what exactly did happen, according to the
  evidence?"</p>

  <p>"The medical evidence," replied Bidwell, "showed that the immediate cause
  of death was heart failure. There were marks of fingers on the throat, as you
  know, and various other bruises. It was evident that deceased had been
  violently assaulted, but death was not directly due to the injuries."</p>

  <p>"And the finding of the jury?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Wilful murder, committed by some person unknown."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't appear to me," said I, "that Mr. Carston's suggestion has much
  present bearing on the case. It is really a point for the defence. But we are
  concerned with the identity of the unknown man."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with Dr. Jervis," said Bidwell. "We have got to
  catch the hare before we go into culinary details."</p>

  <p>"My point is," said Carston, "that Herrington's peculiar temper suggests a
  set of circumstances that would render it probable that his visitor was his
  nephew Godfrey."</p>

  <p>"There is some truth in that," Thorndyke agreed. "It is highly
  speculative, but a reasonable speculation cannot be disregarded when the
  known facts are so few. My feeling is that the police ought to be informed of
  the existence of this man and his possible relations with the deceased. As to
  whether he is or is not the suspected stranger, that could be settled at once
  if he were confronted with the night porter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is true," said Bidwell "I think Carston and I had better call
  at Scotland Yard and give the Assistant Commissioner a hint on the subject.
  It will have to be a very guarded hint, of course."</p>

  <p>"Was the question of motive raised?" Thorndyke asked. "As to robbery, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>"There is no evidence of robbery," replied Bidwell. "I have been through
  all the receptacles in the chambers, and everything seems intact. The keys
  were in poor Giles's pocket and nothing seems to have been disturbed; indeed,
  it doesn't appear that there was any portable property of value on the
  premises."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "the first thing that has to be done is to
  establish the identity of the nocturnal visitor. That is the business of the
  police. And if you call and tell them what you have told us, they will, at
  least, have something to investigate. They should have no difficulty in
  proving either that he is or is not the man whom the porter let in at the
  gate; and until they have settled that question, there is no need for us to
  take any action."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Bidwell, rising and taking up his hat. "If the police can
  complete the case, there is nothing for us to do. However, I will leave you
  the report of the inquest to look over at your leisure, and will keep you
  informed as to how the case progresses."</p>

  <p>When our two friends had gone, Thorndyke sat for some time turning over
  the sheets of the report and glancing through the depositions of the
  witnesses. Presently he remarked: "If it turns out that this man, Godfrey
  Herrington, is not the man whom the porter let in, the police will be left in
  the air. Apart from Bidwell's purely speculative suggestion, there seems to
  be no clue whatever to the visitor's identity."</p>

  <p>"Badger would like to hear you say that," said I. "He was very sarcastic
  respecting our methods of research," and here I gave him an account of my
  interview with the inspector, including the "clues" with which he had
  presented me.</p>

  <p>"It was like his impudence," Thorndyke commented smilingly, "to pull the
  leg of my learned junior. Still, there was a germ of sense in what he said. A
  collection of dust from the floor of that room, in which two men had engaged
  in a violent struggle, would certainly yield traces of both of them."</p>

  <p>"Mixed up with the traces of a good many others," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"True," he admitted. "But that would not affect the value of a positive
  trace of a particular individual. Supposing, for instance, that Godfrey
  Herrington were known to have dyed hair; and suppose that one or more dyed
  male hairs were found in the dust from the floor of the room. That would
  establish a probability that he had been in that room, and also that he was
  the person who had struggled with the deceased."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," said I. "Perhaps I ought to have collected some of the
  dust. But it isn't too late now, as Bidwell has locked up the chambers,
  Meanwhile, let me present you with Badger's clues. They came off the
  floor."</p>

  <p>I searched in my pocket and produced the paper packet, the existence of
  which I had forgotten, and having opened it, offered it to him with an
  ironical bow. He looked gravely at the little collection, and, disregarding
  the pin and the match, picked out the third object and examined it
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"That is the alleged boot-lace end," he remarked. "It doesn't do much
  credit to Badger's powers of observation. It is as unlike leather as it could
  well be."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is obviously whalebone or vulcanite."</p>

  <p>"It isn't vulcanite," said he, looking closely at the broken end and
  getting out his pocket lens for a more minute inspection.</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose it is?" I asked, my curiosity stimulated by the
  evident interest with which he was examining the object.</p>

  <p>"We needn't suppose," he replied. "I fancy that if we get Polton to make a
  cross section of it, the microscope will tell us what it is. I will take it
  up to him." As he went out and I heard him ascending to the laboratory where
  our assistant, Polton, was at work, I was conscious of a feeling of vexation
  and a sense of failure. It was always thus. I had treated this fragment with
  the same levity as had the inspector, just dropping it into my pocket and
  forgetting it. Probably the thing was of no interest or importance; but
  whether it was or not, Thorndyke would not be satisfied until he knew for
  certain what it was. And that habit of examining everything, of letting
  nothing pass without the closest scrutiny, was one of the great secrets of
  his success as an investigator.</p>

  <p>When he came down again I reopened the subject.</p>

  <p>It has occurred to me," I said, "that it might be as well for us to have a
  look at that room. My inspection was rather perfunctory, as Badger was
  there."</p>

  <p>"I have just been thinking the same," he replied. "If Godfrey is not the
  man, and the police are left stranded, Bidwell will look to us to take up the
  inquiry, and by that time the room may have been disturbed. I think we will
  get the key from Bidwell to-morrow morning and make a thorough examination.
  And we may as well adopt Badger's excellent suggestion respecting the dust. I
  will instruct Polton to come over with us and bring a full-sized
  vacuum-cleaner, and we can go over what he collects at our leisure."</p>

  <p>Agreeably to this arrangement, we presented ourselves on the following
  morning at Mr. Bidwell's chambers, accompanied by Polton, who, however, being
  acutely conscious of the vacuum-cleaner, which was thinly disguised in brown
  paper, sneaked up the stairs and got out of sight. Bidwell opened the door
  himself, and Thorndyke explained our intentions to him.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can have the key," he said, "but I don't know that it is
  worth your while to go into the matter. There have been developments since I
  saw you last night. When Carston and I called at Scotland Yard we found that
  we were too late. Godfrey Herrington had come forward and made a voluntary
  statement."</p>

  <p>"That was wise of him," said Thorndyke, "but he would have been wiser
  still to have notified the porter of what had happened and sent for a doctor.
  He claims that the death was a misadventure, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Bidwell. "He states that when be left, Giles was
  perfectly well; so well that he was able to kick him&mdash;Godfrey&mdash;down
  the stairs and pitch him out on to the pavement. It seems, according to his
  account, that he called to try to get some financial help from his uncle. He
  admits that he was rather importunate and persisted after Giles had
  definitely refused. Then Giles got suddenly into a rage, thrust him out of
  the chambers, ran him down the stairs, and threw him out into Tanfield Court.
  It is a perfectly coherent story, and quite probable up to a certain point,
  but it doesn't account for the bruises on Giles's body or the finger-marks on
  his throat."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Thorndyke; "either he is lying, or he is the victim of some
  very inexplicable circumstances. But I gather that you have no further
  interest in the case?"</p>

  <p>Bidwell reflected.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I don't know about that. Of course I don't believe him,
  but it is just possible that he is telling the truth. My feeling is that, if
  he is guilty, I want him convicted; but if by any chance he is
  innocent&mdash;well, he is Giles's nephew, and I suppose it is my duty to see
  that he has a fair chance. Yes, I think I would like you to watch the case
  independently&mdash;with a perfectly open mind, neither for nor against. But
  I don't see that there is much that you can do."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said Thorndyke. "But one can observe and note the visible
  facts, if there are any. Has anything been done to the rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," was the reply. "They are just as Dr. Jervis and I
  found them the morning after the catastrophe."</p>

  <p>With this he handed Thorndyke the key and we ascended to the landing,
  where we found Polton on guard with the vacuum-cleaner, like a sentry armed
  with some new and unorthodox weapon.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the room was unchanged. The half-dislodged table-cloth,
  the litter of broken glass on the floor, even the displaced fender and
  hearth-rug, were just as I had last seen them. Thorndyke looked about him
  critically and remarked "The appearances hardly support Godfrey's statement.
  There was clearly a prolonged and violent struggle, not a mere ejectment. And
  look at the table cloth. The uncovered part of the table is that nearest the
  door, and most of the things have fallen off at the end nearest the
  fireplace. Obviously, the body that dislodged the cloth was moving away from
  the door, not towards it, which again suggests something more than an
  unresisted ejectment."</p>

  <p>He again looked round, and his glance fell on the nail and the coloured
  silhouette on the wall-paper.</p>

  <p>"That, I presume," said he, "is where the mys terious sword or dagger
  hung. It is rather large for a dagger and somewhat wide for a sword, though
  barbaric swords are of all shapes and sizes."</p>

  <p>He produced his spring tape and carefully measured the phantom shape on
  the wall. "Thirty-one inches long," he reported, "including the loop at the
  end of the handle, by which it hung; seven and a half inches at the top of
  the scabbard, tapering rather irregularly to three inches at the tip. A
  curious shape. I don't remember ever having seen a sword quite like it."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Polton, having picked up the broken glass and other objects, had
  uncovered the vacuum-cleaner and now started the motor&mdash;which was driven
  by an attached dry battery&mdash;and proceeded very systematically to trundle
  the machine along the floor. At every two or three sweeps he paused to empty
  the receiver, placing the grey, felt-like mass on a sheet of paper, with a
  pencilled note of the part of the room from whence it came. The size of these
  masses of felted dust, and the astonishing change in the colour of the carpet
  that marked the trail of the cleaner, suggested that Mrs. Runt's activities
  had been of a somewhat perfunctory character. Polton's dredgings apparently
  represented the accumulations of years.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful lot of hairs in this old dust," Polton remarked as he deposited
  a fresh consignment on the paper, "especially in this lot. It came from under
  that looking-glass on the wall. Perhaps that clothes brush that hangs under
  the glass accounts for it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "they will be hairs brushed off Mr. Herrington's collar
  and shoulders. But," I added, taking the brush from its nail and examining
  it, "Mrs. Runt seems to have used the glass, too. There are three long hairs
  still sticking to the brush."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke was still occupied in browsing inquisitively round the room,
  I proceeded to make a preliminary inspection of the heaps of dust, picking
  out the hairs and other recognisable objects with my pocket forceps, and
  putting them on a separate sheet of paper. Of the former, the bulk were
  pretty obviously those of the late tenant&mdash;white or dull black male
  hairs&mdash;but Mrs. Runt had contributed quite liberally, for I picked out
  of the various heaps over a dozen long hairs, the mousy brown colour of which
  seemed to identify them as hers. The remainder were mostly ordinary male
  hairs of various colours, eyebrow hairs and eyelashes, of no special
  interest, with one exception. This was a black hair which lay flat on the
  paper in a Close coil, like a tiny watch-spring.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who this negro was," said I, inspecting it through my lens.</p>

  <p>"Probably some African or West Indian Law student," Thorndyke suggested.
  "There are always a good many about the Inns of Court."</p>

  <p>He came round to examine my collection, and while he was viewing the negro
  hair with the aid of my lens, I renewed my investigation of the little
  dust-heaps. Presently I made a new discovery.</p>

  <p>"Why," I exclaimed, "here is another of Badger's boot-laces&mdash;another
  piece of the same one, I think. By the way, did you ascertain what that
  boot-lace really was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Polton made a section of it and mounted it; and
  furthermore, he made a magnified photograph of it. I have the photograph in
  my pocket, so you can answer your own question."</p>

  <p>He produced from his letter-case a half-plate print which he handed to me
  and which I examined curiously.</p>

  <p>"It is a singular object," said I, "but I don't quite make it out. It
  looks rather like a bundle of hairs embedded in some transparent
  substance."</p>

  <p>"That, in effect," he replied, "is what it is. It is an elephant's hair,
  probably from the tail. But, as you see, it is a compound hair; virtually a
  group of hairs agglutinated into a single stem. Most very large hairs are
  compound. A tiger's whiskers, for instance, are large, stiff hairs which, if
  cut across, are seen to be formed of several largish hairs fused together;
  and the colossal hair which grows on the nose of the rhinoceros&mdash;the
  so-called nasal horn&mdash;is made up of thousands of subordinate hairs."</p>

  <p>"It is a remarkable-looking thing," I said, handing back the photograph;
  "very distinctive&mdash;if you happen to know what it is. But the mystery is
  how on earth it came here. There are no elephants in the Temple."</p>

  <p>"I certainly haven't noticed any," he replied; "and, as you say, the
  presence of an elephant's hair in a room in the middle of London is a rather
  remarkable circumstance. And yet, perhaps, if we consider all the other
  circumstances, it may not be impossible to form a conjecture as to how it
  came here. I recommend the problem to my learned friend for consideration at
  his leisure and now, as we have seen all that there is to see&mdash;which is
  mighty little&mdash;we may as well leave Polton to finish the collection of
  data from the floor. We can take your little selection with us."</p>

  <p>He folded the paper containing the hairs that I had picked out into a neat
  packet, which he slipped into his pocket; then, having handed the key of the
  outer door to Polton, for return to Mr. Bidwell, he went out and I followed.
  We descended the stairs slowly, both of us deeply reflective. As to the
  subject of his meditations I could form no opinion, but my own were occupied
  by the problem which he had suggested; and the more I reflected on it, the
  less capable of solution did it appear.</p>

  <p>We had nearly reached the ground floor when I became aware of quick
  footsteps descending the stairs behind us. Near the entry our follower
  overtook us, and as we stood aside to let him pass, I had a brief vision of a
  shortish, dapper, smartly-dressed coloured man&mdash;apparently an African or
  West Indian&mdash;who carried a small suit-case and a set of golf-clubs.</p>

  <p>"Now," said I, in a low tone, "I wonder if that gentleman is the late
  owner of that negro hair that I picked up. It seems intrinsically probable as
  he appears to live in this building, and would be a near neighbour of
  Herrington's." I halted at the entry and read out the only name painted on
  the door-post as appertaining to the second floor&mdash;Mr. Kwaku Essien,
  which, I decided, seemed to fit a gentleman of colour.</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke was not listening. His long legs were already carrying him,
  with a deceptively leisurely air, across Tanfield Court in the wake of Mr.
  Essien, and at about the same pace. I put on a spurt and over took him, a
  little mystified by his sudden air of purpose and by the fact that he was not
  walking in the direction of our chambers. Still more mystified was I when it
  became clear that Thorndyke was following the African and keeping at a
  constant distance in rear of him; but I made no comment until, having pursued
  our quarry to the top of Middle Temple Lane, we saw him hail a taxi and drive
  off. Then I demanded an explanation.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see him fairly out of the precincts," was the reply, "because
  I have a particular desire to see what his chambers are like. I only hope his
  door has a practicable latch."</p>

  <p>I stared at him in dismay.</p>

  <p>"You surely don't contemplate breaking into his chambers!" I
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he replied, "if the latch won't yield to gentle
  persuasion I shall give it up. But don't let me involve you, Jervis. I admit
  that it is a slightly irregular proceeding."</p>

  <p>"Irregular!" I repeated. "It is house-breaking, pure and simple I can only
  hope that you won't be able to get in."</p>

  <p>The hope turned out to be a vain one, as I had secretly feared. When we
  had reconnoitred the stairs and established the encouraging fact that the
  third floor was untenanted, we inspected the door above which our victim's
  name was painted; and a glance at the yawning key of an old-fashioned
  draw-latch told me that the deed was as good as done.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jervis," said Thorndyke, producing from his pocket the curious
  instrument that he described as a "smoker's companion"&mdash;it was an
  undeniable pick-lock, made by Polton under his direction&mdash;"you had
  better clear out and wait for me at our chambers."</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," I replied. "I am an accessory before the
  fact already, so I may as well stay and see the crime committed."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case," said he, "you had better keep a look-out from the
  landing window and call me if any one comes to the house. That will make us
  perfectly safe."</p>

  <p>I accordingly took my station at the window, and Thorndyke, having knocked
  several times at the "oak" without eliciting any response, set to work with
  the smoker's companion. In less than a minute the latch clicked, the outer
  door opened, and Thorndyke, pushing the inner door open, entered, leaving
  both doors ajar. I was devoured by curiosity as to what his purpose was.
  Obviously it must be a very definite one to justify this most extraordinary
  proceeding. But I dared not leave my post for a moment, seeing that we were
  really engaged in a very serious breach of the law and it was of vital
  importance that we should not be surprised in the act. I was therefore unable
  to observe my colleague's proceedings, and I waited impatiently to see if
  anything came of this unlawful entry.</p>

  <p>I had waited thus some ten minutes, keeping a close watch on the pavement
  below, when I heard Thorndyke quickly cross the room and approach the door. A
  moment later he came out on the landing, bearing in his hand an object which,
  while it enlightened me as to the purpose of the raid, added to my
  mystification.</p>

  <p>"That looks like the missing sword from Herrington's room!" I exclaimed,
  gazing at it in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "I found it in a drawer in the bedroom. Only it isn't a
  sword."</p>

  <p>"Then, what the deuce is it?" I demanded, for the thing looked like a
  broad-bladed sword in a soft leather scabbard of somewhat rude native workman
  ship.</p>

  <p>By way of reply he slowly drew the object from its sheath, and as it came
  into sight, I uttered an exclamation of astonishment. To the inexpert eye it
  appeared an elongated body about nine inches in length covered with coarse,
  black leather, from either side of which sprang a multitude of what looked
  like thick, black wires. Above, it was furnished with a leather handle which
  was surmounted by a suspension loop of plaited leather.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said I, "that this is an elephant's tail."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "and a rather remarkable specimen. The hairs are of
  unusual length. Some of them, you see, are nearly eighteen inches long."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do now?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I am going to put it back where I found it. Then I shall run down to
  Scotland Yard and advise Miller to get a search warrant. He is too discreet
  to ask inconvenient questions."</p>

  <p>I must admit that it was a great relief to me when, a minute later,
  Thorndyke came out and shut the door; but I could not deny that the raid had
  been justified by the results. What had, presumably, been a mere surmise had
  been converted into a definite fact on which action could confidently be
  taken.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, as we walked down towards the Embankment en route for
  Scotland Yard, "I ought to have spotted this case."</p>

  <p>"You had the means," Thorndyke replied. "At your first visit you learned
  that an object of some kind had disappeared from the wall. It seemed to be a
  trivial object of no value, and not likely to be connected with the crime. So
  you disregarded it. But it had disappeared. Its disappearance was not
  accounted for, and that disappearance seemed to coincide in time with the
  death of Herrington. It undoubtedly called for investigation. Then you found
  on the floor an object the nature of which was unknown to you. Obviously, you
  ought to have ascertained what it was."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I ought," I admitted, "though I am not sure that I should have been
  much forrader even then. In fact, I am not so very much forrader even now. I
  don't see how you spotted this man Essien, and I don't understand why he took
  all this trouble and risk and even committed a murder to get possession of
  this trumpery curio. Of course I can make a vague guess. But I should like to
  hear how you ran the man and the thing to earth."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke. "Let me retrace the train of discoveries and
  inferences in their order. First I learned that an object, supposed to be a
  barbaric sword of some kind, had disappeared about the time of the
  murder&mdash;if it was a murder. Then we heard from Carston that Sir Gilbert
  Herrington had appropriated the insignia and ceremonial objects belonging to
  the king of Bekw; that some had subsequently been restored, but others had
  been given to friends as curios. As I listened to that story, the possibility
  occurred to me that this curio which had disappeared might be one of the
  missing ceremonial objects. It was not only possible: it was quite probable.
  For Giles Herrington was a very likely person to have received one of these
  gifts, and his morose temper made it unlikely that he would restore it. And
  then, since such an object would be of great value to somebody, and since it
  was actually stolen property, there would be good reasons why some interested
  person should take forcible possession of it. This, of course, was mere
  hypothesis of a rather shadowy kind. But when you produced an object which I
  at once suspected, and then proved, to be an elephant's hair, the hypothesis
  became a reasonable working theory. For, among the ceremonial objects which
  form what we may call the regalia of a West African king is the elephant's
  tail which is carried before him by a special officer as a symbol of his
  power and strength. An elephant's tail had pretty certainly been stolen from
  the king, and Carston said nothing about its having been restored.</p>

  <p>"Well, when we went to Herrington's chambers just now, it was clear to me
  that the thing which had disappeared was certainly not a sword. The phantom
  shape on the wall did not show much, but it did show plainly that the object
  had hung from the nail by a large loop at the end of the handle. But the
  suspension loop of a sword or dagger is always on the scabbard, never on the
  hilt. But if the thing was not a sword, what was it? The elephant's hair that
  you found on the floor seemed to answer the question.</p>

  <p>"Now, as we came in, I had noticed on the doorpost the West African name,
  Kwaku Essien. A man whose name is Kwaku is pretty certainly a negro. But if
  this was an elephant's tail, its lawful owner was a negro, and that owner
  wanted to recover it and was morally entitled to take possession of it. Here
  was another striking agreement. The chambers over Herrington's were occupied
  by a negro. Finally, you found among the floor dust a negro's hair. Then a
  negro had actually been in this room. But from what we know of Herrington,
  that negro was not there as an invited visitor. All the probabilities pointed
  to Mr. Essien. But the probabilities were not enough to act on. Then we had a
  stroke of sheer luck. We got the chance to explore Essien's chambers and seek
  the crucial fact. But here we are at Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>That night, at about eight o'clock, a familiar tattoo on our knocker
  announced the arrival of Mr. Superintendent Miller, not entirely unexpected
  as I guessed.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, as I let him in, "the coloured nobleman has come home.
  I've just had a message from the man who was detailed to watch the
  premises."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to make the arrest now?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I should be glad if you could come across with me. You know more
  about the case than I do."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke assented at once, and we set forth together. As we entered
  Tanfield Court we passed a man who was lurking in the shadow of an entry, and
  who silently indicated the lighted windows of the chambers for which we were
  bound. Ascending the stairs up which I had lately climbed with unlawful
  intent, we halted at Mr. Essien's door, on which the superintendent executed
  an elaborate flourish with his stick, there being no knocker. After a short
  interval we heard a bolt with drawn, the door opened a short distance, and in
  the interval a black face appeared looking out at us suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want?" the owner of the face demanded
  gruffly.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Kwaku Essien, I think?" said Miller, unostentatiously
  insinuating his foot into the door opening.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "But I don't know you. What is your business?"</p>

  <p>"I am a police officer," Miller replied, edging his foot in a little
  farther, "and I hold a warrant to arrest you on the charge of having murdered
  Mr. Giles Herrington."</p>

  <p>Before the superintendent had fairly finished his sentence, the dusky face
  vanished and the door slammed violently&mdash;on to the superintendent's
  massive foot. That foot was instantly reinforced by a shoulder and for a few
  moments there was a contest of forces, opposite but not equal. Suddenly the
  door flew open and the superintendent charged into the room. I had a
  momentary vision of a flying figure, closely pursued, darting through into an
  inner room, of the slamming of a second door&mdash;once more on an
  intercepting foot. And then&mdash;it all seemed to have happened in a few
  seconds&mdash;a dejected figure, sitting on the edge of a bed, clasping a
  pair of manacled hands and watching Miller as he drew the elephant's tail out
  of a drawer in the dressing-chest.</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;er&mdash;article," said Miller, "belonged to Mr. Herrington,
  and was stolen from his premises on the night of the murder."</p>

  <p>Essien shook his head emphatically.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "You are wrong. I stole nothing, and I did not murder
  Mr. Herrington. Listen to me and I will tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>Miller administered the usual caution and the prisoner continued: "This
  elephant-brush is one of many things stolen, years ago, from the king of
  Bekw. Some of those things&mdash;most of them&mdash;have been restored, but
  this could not be traced for a long time. At last it became known to me that
  Mr. Herrington had it, and I wrote to him asking him to give it up and
  telling him who I was&mdash;I am the eldest living son of the king's sister,
  and therefore, according to our law, the heir to the kingdom. But he would
  not give it up or even sell it. Then, as I am a student of the Inn, I took
  these chambers above his, intending, when I had an opportunity, to go in and
  take possession of my uncle's property. The opportunity came that night that
  you have spoken of. I was coming up the stairs to my chambers when, as I
  passed his door, I heard loud voices inside as of people quarrelling. I had
  just reached my own door and opened it when I heard his door open, and then a
  great uproar and the sound of a struggle. I ran down a little way and looked
  over the banisters, and then I saw him thrusting a man across the landing and
  down the lower stairs. As they disappeared, I ran down, and finding his door
  ajar, I went in to recover my property. It took me a little time to find it,
  and I had just taken it from the nail and was going out with it when, at the
  door, I met Mr. Herrington coming in. He was very excited already, and when
  he saw me he seemed to go mad. I tried to get past him, but he seized me and
  dragged me back into the room, wrenching the thing out of my hand. He was
  very violent. I thought he wanted to kill me, and I had to struggle for my
  life. Suddenly he let go his hold of me, staggered back a few paces, and then
  fell on the floor. I stooped over him, thinking that he was taken ill, and
  wondering what I had better do. But soon I saw that he was not ill; he was
  dead. Then I was very frightened. I picked up the elephant brush and put it
  back into its case, and I went out very quietly, shut the door, and ran up to
  my rooms. That is what happened. There was no robbery and murder."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, as the prisoner and his escort disappeared towards
  the gate, "I suppose, in a technical sense, it is murder, but they are hardly
  likely to press the charge."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is even technically," said Thorndyke. "My feeling is
  that he will be acquitted if he is sent for trial. Meanwhile, I take it that
  my client, Godfrey Herrington, will be released from custody at once."</p>

  <p>"Yes, doctor," replied Miller, "I will see to that now. He has had better
  luck than he deserved, I suspect, in having his case looked after by you. I
  don't fancy he would have got an acquittal if he had gone for trial."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's forecast was nearly correct, but there was no acquittal, since
  there was no trial. The case against Kwaku Essien never got farther than the
  Grand Jury.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8"></a>THE PATHOLOGIST TO THE RESCUE</h2>

  <p class="first">"I HOPE," said I, as I looked anxiously out of our window up
  King's Bench Walk, "that our friend, Foxley, will turn up to time, or I shall
  lose the chance of hearing his story. I must be in court by half-past eleven.
  The telegram said that he was a parson, didn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "The Reverend Arthur Foxley."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps this may be he. There is a parson crossing from the Row in
  this direction, only he has a girl with him. He didn't say anything about a
  girl, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. He merely asked for the appointment. However," he added, as he joined
  me at the window and watched the couple approaching with their eyes
  apparently fixed on the number above our portico, "this is evidently our
  client, and punctual to the minute."</p>

  <p>In response to the old-fashioned flourish on our little knocker, he opened
  the inner door and invited the clergyman and his companion to enter; and
  while the mutual introductions were in progress, I looked critically at our
  new clients. Mr. Foxley was a typical and favourable specimen of his class: a
  handsome, refined, elderly gentleman, prim as to his speech, suave and
  courteous in bearing, with a certain engaging simplicity of manner which
  impressed me very favourably. His companion I judged to be a parishioner for
  she was what ladies are apt to describe as "not quite;" that is to say, her
  social level appeared to appertain to the lower strata of the middle-class.
  But she was a fine, strapping girl, very sweet-faced and winsome, quiet and
  gentle in manner and obviously in deep trouble, for her clear grey
  eyes&mdash;fixed earnestly, almost devouringly, on Thorndyke&mdash;were
  reddened and swimming with unshed tears.</p>

  <p>"We have sought your aid, Dr. Thorndyke," the clergyman began, "on the
  advice of my friend, Mr. Brodribb, who happened to call on me on some
  business. He assured me that you would be able to solve our difficulties if
  it were humanly possible, so I have come to lay those difficulties before
  you. I pray to God that you may be able to help us, for my poor young friend
  here, Miss Markham, is in a most terrible position, as you will understand
  when I tell you that her future husband, a most admirable young man named
  Robert Fletcher, is in the custody of the police, charged with robbery and
  murder."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded gravely, and the clergyman continued: "I had better tell
  you exactly what has happened. The dead man is one Joseph Riggs, a maternal
  uncle of Fletcher's, a strange, eccentric man, solitary, miserly, and of a
  violent, implacable temper. He was quite well-to-do, though penurious and
  haunted constantly by an absurd fear of poverty. His nephew, Robert, was
  apparently his only known relative, and, under his will, was his sole heir.
  Recently, however, Robert has become engaged to my friend, Miss Lilian, and
  this engagement was violently opposed by his uncle, who had repeatedly urged
  him to make what he called a profitable marriage. For Miss Lilian is a
  dowerless maiden&mdash;dowerless save for those endowments with which God has
  been pleased to enrich her, and which her future husband has properly prized
  above mere material wealth. However, Riggs declared, in his brutal way, that
  he was not going to leave his property to the husband of a shop-woman, and
  that Robert might look out for a wife with money or be struck out of his
  will.</p>

  <p>"The climax was reached yesterday when Robert, in response to a peremptory
  summons, went to see his uncle. Mr. Riggs was in a very intractable mood. He
  demanded that Robert should break off his engagement unconditionally and at
  once, and when Robert bluntly insisted on his right to choose his own wife
  the old man worked himself up into a furious rage, shouting, cursing, using
  the most offensive language and even uttering threats of personal violence.
  Finally, he drew his gold watch from his pocket and laid it with its chain on
  the table then, opening a drawer, he took out a bundle of bearer bonds and
  threw them down by the watch.</p>

  <p>"'There, my friend,' said he, 'that is your inheritance. That is all you
  will get from me, living or dead. Take it and go, and don't let me ever set
  eyes on you again.'</p>

  <p>"At first Robert refused to accept the gift, but his uncle became so
  violent that eventually, for peace's sake, he took the watch and the bonds,
  intending to return them later, and went away. He left at half-past five,
  leaving his uncle alone in the house."</p>

  <p>"How was that?" Thorndyke asked. "Was there no servant?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Riggs kept no resident servant. The young woman who did his housework
  came at half-past eight in the morning and left at half-past four. Yesterday
  she waited until five to get tea ready, but then, as the uproar in the
  sitting-room was still unabated, she thought it best to go. She was afraid to
  go in to lay the tea-things.</p>

  <p>"This morning, when she arrived at the house, she found the front door
  unlocked, as it always was during the day. On entering, her attention was at
  once attracted by two or three little pools of blood on the floor of the
  hall, or passage. Somewhat alarmed by this, she looked into the sitting-room,
  and finding no one there, and being impressed by the silence in the house,
  she went along the passage to a back room&mdash;a sort of study or office,
  which was usually kept locked when Mr. Riggs was not in. Now, however, it was
  unlocked and the door was ajar; so having first knocked and receiving no
  answer, she pushed open the door and looked in; and there, to her horror, she
  saw her employer lying on the floor, apparently dead, with a wound on the
  side of his head and a pistol on the floor by his side.</p>

  <p>"Instantly she turned and rushed out of the house, and she was running up
  the street in search of a policeman when she encountered me at a corner and
  burst out with her dreadful tidings. I walked with her to the police station,
  and as we went she told me what had happened on the previous afternoon.
  Naturally, I was profoundly shocked and also alarmed, for I saw
  that&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;suspicion must immediately fall on Robert
  Fletcher. The servant, Rose Turnmill, took it for granted that he had
  murdered her master; and when we found the station inspector, and Rose had
  repeated her statement to him, it was evident that he took the same view.</p>

  <p>"With him and a sergeant, we went back to the house; but on the way we met
  Mr. Brodribb, who was staying at the 'White Lion' and had just come out for a
  walk. I told him, rapidly, what had occurred and begged him to come with us,
  which, with the inspector's consent, he did; and as we walked I explained to
  him the awful position that Robert Fletcher might be placed in, and asked him
  to advise me what to do. But, of course, there was nothing to be said or done
  until we had seen the body and knew whether any suspicion rested on
  Robert.</p>

  <p>"We found the man Riggs lying as Rose had said. He was quite dead, cold
  and stiff. There was a pistol wound on the right temple, and a pistol lay on
  the floor at his right side. A little blood&mdash;but not much&mdash;had
  trickled from the wound and lay in a small pool on the oilcloth. The door of
  an iron safe was open and a bunch of keys hung from the lock; and on a desk
  one or two share certificates were spread out. On searching the dead man's
  pockets it was found that the gold watch which the servant told us he usually
  carried was missing, and when Rose went to the bedroom to see if it was
  there, it was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>"Apart from the watch, however, the appearances suggested that the man had
  taken his own life. But against this view was the blood on the hall floor.
  The dead man appeared to have fallen at once from the effects of the shot,
  and there had been very little bleeding. Then how came the blood in the hall?
  The inspector decided that it could not have been the blood of the deceased;
  and when we examined it and saw that there were several little pools and that
  they seemed to form a track towards the street door, he was convinced that
  the blood had fallen from some person who had been wounded and was escaping
  from the house. And, under the circumstances, he was bound to assume that
  that person was Robert Fletcher; and on that assumption, he dispatched the
  sergeant forthwith to arrest Robert.</p>

  <p>"On this I held a consultation with Mr. Brodribb, who pointed out that the
  case turned principally on the blood in the hall. If it was the blood of
  deceased, and the absence of the watch could be explained, a verdict of
  suicide could be accepted. But if it was the blood of some other person, that
  fact would point to murder. The question, he said, would have to be settled,
  if possible, and his advice to me, if I believed Robert to be
  innocent&mdash;which, from my knowledge of him, I certainly did&mdash;was
  this: Get a couple of small, clean, labelled bottles from a chemist
  and&mdash;with the inspector's consent&mdash;put in one a little of the blood
  from the hall and in the other some of the blood of the deceased. Seal them
  both in the inspector's presence and mine and take them up to Dr. Thorndyke.
  If it is possible to answer the question, Are they or are they not from the
  same person? he will answer it.</p>

  <p>"Well, the inspector made no objection, so I did what he advised. And here
  are the specimens. I trust they may tell us what we want to know."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Foxley took from his attach-case a small cardboard box, and
  opening it, displayed two little wide-mouthed bottles carefully packed in
  cotton wool. Lifting them out tenderly, he placed them on the table before
  Thorndyke. They were both neatly corked, sealed&mdash;with Brodribb's seal,
  as I noticed&mdash;and labelled; the one inscribed "Blood of Joseph Riggs,"
  and the other "Blood of unknown origin," and both signed "Arthur Foxley" and
  dated. At the bottom of each was a small mass of gelatinous blood-clot.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked a little dubiously at the two bottles, and addressing the
  clergyman, said: "I am afraid Mr. Brodribb has rather over-estimated our
  resources. There is no known method by which the blood of one person can be
  distinguished with certainty from that of another."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Mr. Foxley. "How disappointing! Then these
  specimens are useless, after all?"</p>

  <p>"I won't say that; but it is in the highest degree improbable that they
  will yield any information. You must build no expectations on them."</p>

  <p>"But you will examine them and see if anything is to be gleaned," the
  parson urged, persuasively.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will examine them. But you realise that if they should yield any
  evidence, that evidence might be unfavourable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; Mr. Brodribb pointed that out, but we are willing to take the risk,
  and so, I may say, is Robert Fletcher, to whom I put the question."</p>

  <p>"Then you have seen Mr. Fletcher since the discovery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him at the police station after his arrest. It was then that
  he gave me&mdash;and also the police&mdash;the particulars that I have
  repeated to you. He had to make a statement, as the dead man's watch and the
  bonds were found in his possession."</p>

  <p>"With regard to the pistol. Has it been identified?"</p>

  <p>"No. It is an old-fashioned derringer which no one has ever seen before,
  so there is no evidence as to whose property it was."</p>

  <p>"And as to those share certificates which you spoke of as lying on the
  desk. Do you happen to remember what they were?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they were West African mining shares; Abusum Pa-pa was the name, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "Mr. Riggs had been losing money. The Abusum Pa-pa
  Company has just gone into liquidation. Do you know if anything had been
  taken from the safe?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to say, but apparently not, as there was a good deal of
  money in the cash-box, which we unlocked and inspected. But we shall hear
  more to-morrow at the inquest, and I trust we shall hear something there from
  you. But in any case I hope you will attend to watch the proceedings on
  behalf of poor Fletcher. And if possible, to be present at the autopsy at
  eleven o'clock. Can you manage that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And I shall come down early enough to make an inspection of the
  premises if the police will give the necessary facilities."</p>

  <p>Mr. Foxley thanked him effusively, and when the details as to the trains
  had been arranged, our clients rose to depart. Thorndyke shook their hands
  cordially, and as he bade farewell to Miss Markham he murmured a few words of
  encouragement. She looked up at him gratefully and appealingly as she navely
  held his hand.</p>

  <p>"You will try to help us, Dr. Thorndyke, won't you?" she urged. "And you
  will examine that blood very, very carefully. Promise that you will. Remember
  that poor Robert's life may hang upon what you can tell about it."</p>

  <p>"I realise that, Miss Markham," he replied gently, "and I promise you that
  the specimens shall be most thoroughly examined; and further, that no stone
  shall be left unturned in my endeavours to bring the truth to light."</p>

  <p>At his answer, spoken with infinite kindliness and sympathy, her eyes
  filled and she turned away with a few broken words of thanks, and the good
  clergyman&mdash;himself not unmoved by the little episode&mdash;took her arm
  and led her to the door.</p>

  <p>"Well," I remarked as their retreating footsteps died away, "old
  Brodribb's enthusiasm seems to have let you in for a queer sort of task; and
  I notice that you appear to have accepted Fletcher's statement."</p>

  <p>"Without prejudice," he replied. "I don't know Fletcher, but the balance
  of probabilities is in his favour. Still, that blood-track in the hall is a
  curious feature. It certainly requires explanation."</p>

  <p>"It does, indeed!" I exclaimed, "and you have got to find the explanation!
  Well, I wish you joy of the job. I suppose you will carry out the farce to
  the bitter end as you have promised?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he replied. "But it is hardly a farce. I should have looked
  the specimens over in any case. One never knows what illuminating fact a
  chance observation may bring into view."</p>

  <p>I smiled sceptically.</p>

  <p>"The fact that you are asked to ascertain is that these two samples of
  blood came from the same person. If there are any means of proving that, they
  are unknown to me. I should have said it was an impossibility."</p>

  <p>"Of course," he rejoined, "you are quite right, speaking academically and
  in general terms. No method of identifying the blood of individual persons
  has hitherto been discovered. But yet I can imagine the possibility, in
  particular and exceptional cases, of an actual, personal identification by
  means of blood. What does my learned friend think?"</p>

  <p>"He thinks that his imagination is not equal to the required effort," I
  answered; and with that I picked up my brief-bag and went forth to my duties
  at the courts.</p>

  <p>That Thorndyke would keep his promise to poor Lilian Markham was a
  foregone conclusion, preposterous as the examination seemed. But even my long
  experience of my colleague's scrupulous conscientiousness had not prepared me
  for the spectacle which met my eyes when I returned to our chambers. On the
  table stood the microscope, flanked by three slide-boxes. Each box held six
  trays, and each tray held six slides&mdash;a hundred and eight slides in
  all!</p>

  <p>But why three boxes? I opened one. The slides&mdash;carefully mounted
  blood-films&mdash;were labelled "Joseph Riggs." Those in the second box were
  labelled, "Blood from hall floor." But when I opened the third box, I beheld
  a collection of empty slides labelled "Robert Fletcher"!</p>

  <p>I chuckled aloud. Prodigious! Thorndyke was going even one better than his
  promise. He was not only going to examine&mdash;probably had
  examined&mdash;the two samples produced; he was actually going to collect a
  third sample for himself!</p>

  <p>I picked out one of Mr. Riggs's slides and laid it on the stage of the
  microscope. Thorndyke seemed to have been using a low-power
  objective&mdash;the inch-and-a-half. After a glance through this, I swung
  round the nose-piece to the high power. And then I got a further surprise.
  The brightly-coloured "white" corpuscles showed that Thorndyke had actually
  been to the trouble of staining the films with eosin! Again I murmured,
  "Prodigious!" and put the slide back in its box. For, of course, it showed
  just what one expected: blood&mdash;or rather, broken-up blood-clot. From its
  appearance I could not even have sworn that it was human blood.</p>

  <p>I had just closed the box when Thorndyke entered the room. His quick eye
  at once noted the changed objective and he remarked: "I see you have been
  having a look at the specimens."</p>

  <p>"A specimen." I corrected. "Enough is as good as a feast."</p>

  <p>"Blessed are they who are easily satisfied," he retorted; and then he
  added: "I have altered my arrangements, though I needn't interfere with
  yours. I shall go down to Southaven to-night; in fact, I am starting in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"For several reasons. I want to make sure of the post-mortem to-morrow
  morning, I want to pick up any further facts that are available, and finally,
  I want to prepare a set of blood-films from Robert Fletcher. We may as well
  make the series complete," he added with a smile, to which I replied by a
  broad grin.</p>

  <p>"Really, Thorndyke," I protested. "I'm surprised at you, at your age, too.
  She is a nice girl, but she isn't so beautiful as to justify a hundred and
  eight blood-films."</p>

  <p>I accompanied him to the taxi, followed by Polton, who carried his modest
  luggage, and then returned to speculate on his probable plan of campaign.
  For, of course, he had one. His purposive, resolute manner told me that he
  had seen farther into this case than I had. I accepted that as natural and
  inevitable. Indeed, I may admit that my disrespectful badinage covered a
  belief in his powers hardly second even to old Brodribb's. I was, in fact,
  almost prepared to discover that those preposterous blood-films had, after
  all, yielded some "illuminating fact" which had sent him hurrying down to
  Southaven in search of corroboration.</p>

  <p>When I alighted from the train on the following day at a little past noon,
  I found him waiting on the platform, ready to conduct me to his hotel for an
  early lunch.</p>

  <p>"All goes well, so far," he reported. "I attended the post-mortem, and
  examined the wound thoroughly. The pistol was held in the right hand not more
  than two inches from the head; probably quite close, for the skin is scorched
  and heavily tattooed with black powder grains. I find that Riggs was
  right-handed. So the prima facie probabilities are in favour of suicide; and
  the recent loss of money suggests a reasonable motive."</p>

  <p>"But what about that blood in the hall?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we have disposed of that. I completed the blood-film series last
  night."</p>

  <p>I looked at him quickly to see if he was serious or only playing a
  facetious return-shot. But his face was as a face of wood.</p>

  <p>"You are an exasperating old devil, Thorndyke!" I exclaimed with
  conviction. Then, knowing that cross-examination would be futile, I asked:
  "What are we going to do after lunch?"</p>

  <p>"The inspector is going to show us over 'the scene of the tragedy,' as the
  newspapers would express it."</p>

  <p>I noted gratefully that he had reserved this item for me, and dismissed
  professional topics for the time being, concentrating my attention on the
  old-world, amphibious streets through which we were walking. There is always
  something interesting in the aspect of a sea-port town, even if it is only a
  small one like Southaven.</p>

  <p>The inspector arrived with such punctuality that he found us still at the
  table and was easily induced to join us with a cup of coffee and to accept a
  cigar&mdash;administered by Thorndyke, as I suspected, with the object of
  hindering conversation. I could see that his interest in my colleague was
  intense and not unmingled with awe, a fact which, in conjunction with the
  cigar, restrained him from any undue manifestations of curiosity, but not
  from continuous, though furtive, observation of my friend. Indeed, when we
  arrived at the late Mr. Riggs's house, I was secretly amused by the close
  watch that he kept on Thorndyke's movements, unsensational as the inspection
  turned out to be.</p>

  <p>The house, itself, presented very little of interest excepting its
  picturesque old-world exterior, which fronted on a quiet by-street and was
  furnished with a deep bay which, as Thorndyke ascertained, commanded a clear
  view of the street from end to end. It was a rather shabby, neglected little
  house, as might have been expected, and our examination of it yielded, so far
  as I could see, only a single fact of any significance: which was that there
  appeared to be no connection whatever between the blood-stain on the study
  floor and the train of large spots from the middle of the hall to the street
  door. And on this piece of evidence&mdash;definitely unfavourable from our
  point of view&mdash;Thorndyke concentrated his attention when he had made a
  preliminary survey.</p>

  <p>Closely followed by the watchful inspector, he browsed round the little
  room, studying every inch of the floor between the blood-stain and the door.
  The latter he examined minutely from top to bottom, especially as to the
  handle, the jambs, and the lintel. Then he went out into the hall,
  scrutinising the floor inch by inch, poring over the walls, and even looking
  behind the framed prints that hung on them. A reflector lamp suspended by a
  nail on the wall received minute and prolonged attention, as did also a
  massive lamp-hook screwed into one of the beams of the low ceiling, of which
  Thorndyke remarked as he stooped to pass under it, that it must have been
  fixed there by a dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the inspector agreed, "and a fool. A swinging lamp hung on that
  hook would have blocked the whole fairway. There isn't too much room as it
  is. What a pity we weren't a bit more careful about footprints in this place.
  There are plenty of tracks of wet feet here on this oil-cloth; faint, but you
  could have made them out all right if they hadn't been all on top of one
  another. There's Mr. Foxley's, the girl's, mine, and the men who carried out
  the body, but I'm hanged if I can tell which is which. It's a regular mix
  up."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is all very confused. But I notice one rather odd
  thing. There are several faint traces of a large right foot, but I can't see
  any sign of the corresponding left foot. Can you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this is it," said Thorndyke, pointing to a large, vague oval
  mark. "I have noticed that it seems to occur in some sort of connection with
  the big right foot; but I must admit that it is not a very obvious
  foot-print."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have taken it for a foot-print at all, or at any rate, not a
  human foot-print. It is more like the spoor of some big animal."</p>

  <p>"It is," Thorndyke agreed; "but whatever it is, it seems to have been here
  before any of the others arrived. You notice that wherever it occurs, it
  seems to have been trodden on by some of the others."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had noticed that, and the same is true of the big right foot, so
  it seems probable that they are connected, as you say. But I am hanged if I
  can make anything of it. Can you, inspector?"</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head. He could not recognise the mark as a
  foot-print, but he could see very plainly that he had been a fool not to have
  taken more care to protect the floor.</p>

  <p>When the examination of the hall was finished, Thorndyke opened the door
  and looked at the big, flat doorstep. "What was the weather like here on
  Wednesday evening?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Showery," the inspector replied; "and there were one or two heavy showers
  during the night. You were noticing that there are no blood-tracks on the
  doorstep. But there wouldn't be in any case; for if a man had come out of
  this door dropping blood, the blood would have dropped on wet stone and got
  washed away at once."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke admitted the truth of this; and so another item of favourable
  evidence was extinguished. The probability that the blood in the hall was
  that of some person other than the deceased remained undisturbed; and I could
  not see that a single fact had been elicited by our inspection of the house
  that was in any way helpful to our client. Indeed, it appeared to me that
  there was absolutely no case for the defence, and I even asked myself whether
  we were not, in fact, merely trying to fudge up a defence for an obviously
  guilty man. It was not like Thorndyke to do that. But how did the case stand?
  There was a suggestion of suicide, but a clear possibility of homicide. There
  was strong evidence that a second person had been in the house, and that
  person appeared to have received a wound. But a wound suggested a struggle;
  and the servant's evidence was to the effect that when she left the house a
  violent altercation was in progress. The deceased was never again seen alive;
  and the other party to the quarrel bad been found with property of the dead
  man in his possession. Moreover, there was a clear motive for the crime,
  stupid as that crime was. For the dead man had threatened to revoke his will
  but as he had presumably not done so, his death left the will still
  operative. In short, everything pointed to the guilt of our client, Robert
  Fletcher.</p>

  <p>I had just reached this not very gratifying conclusion when a statement of
  Thorndyke's shattered my elaborate summing up into impalpable fragments.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir," said the inspector, "there isn't anything that you would
  care to tell us, as you are for the defence. But we are not hostile to
  Fletcher. In fact, he hasn't been charged. He is only being detained in
  custody until we have heard what turns up at the inquest. I know you have
  examined that blood that Mr. Foxley took, and Fletcher's blood, too, and
  you've seen the premises. We have given all the facilities that we could, and
  if you could give us any sort of hint that might be useful, I should be very
  much obliged."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments. Then he replied: "There is no
  reason for secrecy in regard to you, inspector, who have been so helpful and
  friendly, so I will be quite frank. I have examined both samples of blood and
  Fletcher's, and I have inspected the premises; and what I am able to say
  definitely is this: the blood in the hall is not the blood of the
  deceased&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the inspector, "I was afraid it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"And it is not the blood of Robert Fletcher."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it now! Well, I am glad to hear that."</p>

  <p>"Moreover," continued Thorndyke, "it was shed well after nine o'clock at
  night, probably not earlier than midnight."</p>

  <p>"There, now!" the inspector exclaimed, with an admiring glance at
  Thorndyke, "just think of that. See what it is to be a man of science! I
  suppose, sir, you couldn't give us any sort of description of the person who
  dropped that blood in the hall?"</p>

  <p>Staggered as I had been by Thorndyke's astonishing statements, I could not
  repress a grin at the inspector's artless question. But the grin faded rather
  abruptly as Thorndyke replied in matter-of-fact tones: "A detailed
  description is, of course, impossible. I can only sketch out the
  probabilities. But if you should happen to meet with a negro&mdash;a tall
  negro with a bandaged head or a contused wound of the scalp and a swollen
  leg&mdash;you had better keep your eye on him. The leg which is swollen is
  probably the left."</p>

  <p>The inspector was thrilled; and so was I, for that matter. The thing was
  incredible; but yet I knew that Thorndyke's amazing deductions were the
  products of perfectly orthodox scientific methods. Only I could form no sort
  of guess as to how they had been arrived at. A negro's blood is no different
  from any other person's, and certainly affords no clue to his height or the
  condition of his legs. I could make nothing of it: and as the dialogue and
  the inspector's note-takings brought us to the little town hall in which the
  inquest was to be held, I dismissed the puzzle until such time as Thorndyke
  chose to solve it.</p>

  <p>When we entered the town hall we found everything in readiness for the
  opening of the proceedings. The jury were already in their places and the
  coroner was just about to take his seat at the head of the long table. We
  accordingly slipped on to the two chairs that were found for us by the
  inspector, and the latter took his place behind the jury and facing us. Near
  to him Mr. Foxley and Miss Markham were seated, and evidently hailed our
  arrival with profound relief, each of them smiling us a silent greeting. A
  professional-looking man sitting next to Thorndyke I assumed to be the
  medical witness, and a rather good young man who sat apart with a police
  constable I identified as Robert Fletcher.</p>

  <p>The evidence of the "common" witnesses, who deposed to the general facts,
  told us nothing that we did not already know, excepting that it was made
  clear that Fletcher had left his uncle's house not later than seven o'clock
  and that thereafter until the following morning his whereabouts were known.
  The medical witness was cautious, and kept an uneasy eye on Thorndyke. The
  wound which caused the death of deceased might have been inflicted by himself
  or by some other person. He had originally given the probable time of death
  as six or seven o'clock on Wednesday evening. He now admitted in reply to a
  question from Thorndyke that he had not taken the temperature of the body,
  and that the rigidity and other conditions were not absolutely inconsistent
  with a considerable later time of death. Death might even have occurred after
  midnight.</p>

  <p>In spite of this admission, however, the sum of the evidence tended
  strongly to implicate Fletcher, and one or two questions from jurymen
  suggested a growing belief in his guilt. I had no doubt whatever that if the
  case had been put to the jury at this stage, a unanimous verdict of "wilful
  murder" would have been the result. But, as the medical witness returned to
  his seat, the coroner fixed an inquisitive eye on Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"You have not been summoned as a witness, Dr. Thorndyke," said he, "but I
  understand that you have made certain investigations in this case. Are you
  able to throw any fresh light on the circumstances of the death of the
  deceased, Joseph Riggs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied. "I am in a position to give important and
  material evidence."</p>

  <p>Thereupon he was sworn, and the coroner, still watching him curiously,
  said: "I am informed that you have examined samples of the blood of deceased
  and the blood which was found in the hall of deceased's house. Did you
  examine them, and if so, what was the object of the examination?"</p>

  <p>"I examined both samples and also samples of the blood of Robert Fletcher.
  The object was to ascertain whether the blood on the hall floor was the blood
  of the deceased or of Robert Fletcher."</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at the medical witness, and a faint smile appeared on
  the face of each.</p>

  <p>"And did you," the former asked in a slightly ironical tone, "form any
  opinion on the subject?"</p>

  <p>"I ascertained definitely that the blood in the hall was neither that of
  the deceased nor that of Robert Fletcher."</p>

  <p>The coroner's eyebrows went up, and once more he glanced significantly at
  the doctor.</p>

  <p>"But," he demanded incredulously, "is it possible to distinguish the blood
  of one person from that of another?"</p>

  <p>"Usually it is not, but in certain exceptional cases it is. This happened
  to be an exceptional case."</p>

  <p>"In what respect?"</p>

  <p>"It happened," Thorndyke replied, "that the person whose blood was found
  in the hall suffered from the parasitic disease known as filariasis. His
  blood was infested with swarms of a minute worm named Filaria nocturna. I
  have here," he continued, taking out of his research-case the two bottles and
  the three boxes, "thirty-six mounted specimens of this blood, and in every
  one of them one or more of the parasites is to be seen. I have also
  thirty-six mounted specimens each of the blood of the deceased and the blood
  of Robert Fletcher. In not one of these specimens is a single parasite to be
  found. Moreover, I have examined Robert Fletcher and the body of the
  deceased, and can testify that no sign of filarial disease was to be
  discovered in either. Hence it is certain, that the blood found in the halt
  was not the blood of either of these two persons."</p>

  <p>The ironic smile had faded from the coroner's face. He was evidently
  deeply impressed, and his manner was quite deferential as he asked: "Do these
  very remarkable observations of yours lead to any further inferences?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "They render it certain that this blood was shed
  no earlier than nine o'clock and probably nearer midnight."</p>

  <p>"Really!" the astonished coroner exclaimed. "Now, how is it possible to
  fix the time in that exact manner?"</p>

  <p>"By inference from the habits of the parasite," Thorndyke explained. "This
  particular filaria is distributed by the mosquito, and its habits are adapted
  to the habits of the mosquito. During the day, the worms are not found in the
  blood; they remain hidden in the tissues of the body. But about nine o'clock
  at night they begin to migrate from the tissues into the blood, and remain in
  the blood during the hours when the mosquitoes are active. Then about six
  o'clock in the morning, they leave the blood and migrate back into the
  tissues.</p>

  <p>"There is another very similar species&mdash;Filaria diurna&mdash;which
  has exactly opposite habits, adapted to day-flying suctorial insects. It
  appears in the blood about eleven in the forenoon and goes back into the
  tissues at about six o'clock in the evening."</p>

  <p>"Astonishing!" exclaimed the coroner. "Wonderful! By the way, the
  parasites that you found could not, I suppose, have been Filaria diurna?"</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied. "The time excludes that possibility. The blood
  was certainly shed after six. They were undoubtedly nocturna, and the large
  numbers found suggest a late hour. The parasites come out of the tissues very
  gradually, and it is only about midnight that they appear in the blood in
  really large numbers."</p>

  <p>"That is very important," said the coroner. "But does this disease affect
  any particular class of persons?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied. "As the disease is confined to tropical
  countries, the sufferers are naturally residents of the tropics, and nearly
  always natives. In West Africa, for instance, it is common among the negroes
  but practically unknown among the white residents."</p>

  <p>"Should you say that there is a distinct probability that this unknown
  person was a negro?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But apart from the filaria there is direct evidence that he was.
  Searching for some cause of the bleeding, I noticed a lamp-hook screwed into
  the ceiling, and low enough to strike a tall man's head. I examined it
  closely, and observed on it a dark, shiny mark, like a blood-smear, and one
  or two short coiled hairs which I recognised as the scalp-hairs of a negro. I
  have no doubt that the unknown man is a negro, and that he has a wound of the
  scalp."</p>

  <p>"Does filarial disease produce any effects that can be recognised?</p>

  <p>"Frequently it does. One of the commonest effects produced by Filaria
  nocturna, especially among negroes, is the condition known as elephantiasis.
  This consists of an enormous swelling of the extremities, most usually of one
  leg, including the foot; whence the name. The leg and foot look like those of
  an elephant. As a matter of fact, the negro who was in the hall suffered from
  elephantiasis of the left leg. I observed prints of the characteristically
  deformed foot on the oil-cloth covering the floor."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's evidence was listened to with intense interest by everyone
  present, including myself. Indeed, so spell-bound was his audience that one
  could have heard a pin drop; and the breathless silence continued for some
  seconds after he had ceased speaking. Then, in the midst of the stillness, I
  heard the door creak softly behind me.</p>

  <p>There was nothing particularly significant in the sound. But its effects
  were amazing. Glancing at the inspector, who faced the door, I saw his eyes
  open and his jaw drop until his face was a very mask of astonishment. And as
  this expression was reflected on the faces of the jurymen, the coroner and
  everyone present, excepting Thorndyke, whose back was towards the door, I
  turned to see what had happened. And then I was as astonished as the
  others.</p>

  <p>The door had been pushed open a few inches and a head thrust in&mdash;a
  negro's head, covered with a soiled and blood rag forming a rough bandage. As
  I gazed at the black, shiny, inquisitive face, the man pushed the door
  farther open and shuffled into the room; and instantly there arose on all
  sides a soft rustle and an inarticulate murmur followed by breathless
  silence, while every eye was riveted on the man's left leg.</p>

  <p>It certainly was a strange, repulsive-looking member, its monstrous bulk
  exposed to view through the slit trouser and its great shapeless
  foot&mdash;shoeless, since no shoe could have contained it&mdash;rough and
  horny like the foot of an elephant. But it was tragic and pitiable too, for
  the man, apart from this horrible excrescence, was a fine, big,
  athletic-looking fellow.</p>

  <p>The coroner was the first to recover. Addressing Thorndyke, but keeping an
  eye on the negro, he said: "Your evidence, then, amounts to this: On the
  night of Joseph Riggs' death, there was a stranger in the house. That
  stranger was a negro, who seems to have wounded his head and who, you say,
  had a swelled left leg."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke admitted, "that is the substance of my evidence."</p>

  <p>Once more a hush fell on the room. The negro stood near the door, rolling
  his eyes to and fro over the assembly as if uneasily conscious that everyone
  was looking at him. Suddenly, he shuffled up to the foot of the table and
  addressed the coroner in deep, buzzing, resonant tones. "You tink I kill dat
  ole man! I no kill um. He kill himself. I look um."</p>

  <p>Having made this statement, he rolled his eyes defiantly round the court,
  and then turned his face expectantly towards the coroner, who said: "You say
  you know that Mr. Riggs killed himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yas. I look um. He shoot himself. You tink I shoot um. I tell you I no
  shoot um. Why I fit kill this man? I no sabby um."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "if you know that he killed himself, you must
  tell us all that you know; and you must swear to tell us the truth."</p>

  <p>"Yas," the negro agreed, "I tell you eberyting one time. I tell you de
  troof. Dat ole man kill himself."</p>

  <p>When the coroner had explained to him that he was not bound to make any
  statement that would incriminate him, as he still elected to give evidence,
  he was sworn and proceeded to make his statement with curious fluency and
  self-possession.</p>

  <p>"My name Robert Bruce. Dat my English name. My country name Kwaku Mensah.
  I live for Winnebah on de Gold Coast. Dis time I cook's mate for dat steamer
  Leckie. On Wednesday night I lay in my bunk. I no fit sleep. My leg he chook
  me. I look out of de porthole. Plenty moon live. In my country when de moon
  big, peoples walk about. So I get up. I go ashore to walk about de town. Den
  de rain come. Plenty rain. Rain no good for my sickness. So I try for open
  house doors. No fit. All doors locked. Den I come to dis ole man's house. I
  turn de handle. De door open. I go in. I look in one room. All dark. Nobody
  live. Den I look annudder room. De door open a little. Light live inside. I
  no like dat I tink, spose somebody come out and see me, be tink I come for
  teef someting. So I tink I go away.</p>

  <p>"Den someting make 'Ping!' same like gun. I hear someting fall down in dat
  room. I go to de door and I sing out, 'Who live in dere?' Nobody say nutting.
  So I open de door and look in. De room full ob smoke. I look dat ole man on
  de floor. I look dat pistol. I sabby dat ole man kill himself. Den I frighten
  too much. I run out. De place all dark. Someting knock my head. He make blood
  come plenty. I go back for ship. I no say nutting to nobody. Dis day I hear
  peoples talk 'bout dis inquess to find out who kill dat ole man. So I come to
  hear what peoples say. I hear dat gentleman say I kill dat ole man. So I tell
  you eberyting. I tell you de troof. Finish."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what time it was when you came ashore?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yas. When I come down de ladder I hear eight bells ring. I get back to de
  ship jus' before dey ring two bells in de middle watch."</p>

  <p>"Then you came ashore at midnight and got back just before one
  o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Yas. Dat is what I say."</p>

  <p>A few more questions put by the coroner having elicited nothing fresh, the
  case was put briefly to the jury.</p>

  <p>"You have heard the evidence, gentlemen, and most remarkable evidence it
  was. Like myself, you must have been deeply impressed by the amazing skill
  with which Dr. Thorndyke reconstructed the personality of the unknown visitor
  to that house, and even indicated correctly the very time of the visit, from
  an examination of a mere chance blood-stain. As to the statement of Kwaku
  Mensab, I can only say that I see no reason to doubt its truth. You will note
  that it is in complete agreement with Dr. Thorndyke's evidence, and it
  presents no inconsistencies or improbabilities. Possibly the police may wish
  to make some further inquiries, but for our purposes it is the evidence of an
  eyewitness, and as such must be given full weight. With these remarks, I
  leave you to consider your verdict."</p>

  <p>The jury took but a minute or two to deliberate. Indeed, only one verdict
  was possible if the evidence was to be accepted, and that was agreed on
  unanimously&mdash;suicide whilst temporarily insane. As soon as it was
  announced, the inspector, formally and with congratulations, released
  Fletcher from custody, and presently retired in company with the negro to
  make a few inquiries on board the ship.</p>

  <p>The rising of the court was the signal for a wild demonstration of
  enthusiasm and gratitude to Thorndyke. To play his part efficiently in that
  scene he would have needed to be furnished, like certain repulsive Indian
  deities, with an unlimited outfit of arms. For everyone wanted to shake his
  hand, and two of them&mdash;Mr. Foxley and Miss Markham&mdash;did so with
  such pertinacity as entirely to exclude the other candidates.</p>

  <p>"I can never thank you enough," Miss Markham exclaimed, with swimming
  eyes, "if I should live to be a hundred. But I shall think of you with
  gratitude every day of my life. Whenever I look at Robert, I shall remember
  that his liberty, and even his life, are your gifts."</p>

  <p>Here she was so overcome by grateful emotion that she again seized and
  pressed his hand. I think she was within an ace of kissing him; but being,
  perhaps, doubtful how he would take it, compromised by kissing Robert
  instead. And, no doubt, it was just as well.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9"></a>GLEANINGS FROM THE WRECKAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a time, and not so very long ago, when even the
  main streets of London, after midnight, were as silent as&mdash;not the
  grave; that is an unpleasant simile. Besides, who has any experience of
  conditions in the grave? But they were nearly as silent as the streets of a
  village. Then the nocturnal pedestrian could go his way encompassed and
  soothed by quiet, which was hardly disturbed by the rumble of a country wagon
  wending to market or the musical tinkle of the little bells on the collar of
  the hansom-cab horse sedately drawing some late reveller homeward.</p>

  <p>Very different is the state of those streets nowadays. Long after the hour
  when the electric trams have ceased from troubling and the motor omnibuses
  are at rest, the heavy road transport from the country thunders through the
  streets; the air is rent by the howls of the electric hooter, and belated
  motor-cyclists fly past, stuttering explosively like perambulant Lewis guns
  with an inexhaustible charge.</p>

  <p>"Let us get into the by-streets," said Thorndyke, as a car sped past us
  uttering sounds suggestive of a dyspeptic dinosaur. "We don't want our
  conversation seasoned with mechanical objurgations. In the back-streets it is
  still possible to hear oneself speak and forget the march of progress."</p>

  <p>We turned into a narrow by-way with the confidence of the born and bred
  Londoner in the impossibility of losing our direction, and began to thread
  the intricate web of streets in the neighbourhood of a canal.</p>

  <p>"It is a remarkable thing," Thorndyke resumed anon, "that every new
  application of science seems to be designed to render the environment of
  civilised man more and more disagreeable. If the process goes much farther,
  as it undoubtedly will, we shall presently find ourselves looking back
  wistfully at the Stone-age as the golden age of human comfort."</p>

  <p>At this point his moralising was cut short by a loud, sharp explosion. We
  both stopped and looked about from the parapet of the bridge that we were
  crossing.</p>

  <p>"Quite like old times," Thorndyke remarked. "Carries one back to 1915,
  when friend Fritz used to call on us. Ah! There is the place; the top story
  of that tall building across the canal." He pointed as he spoke to a
  factory-like structure, from the upper windows of which a lurid light shone
  and rapidly grew brighter.</p>

  <p>"It must be down the next turning," said I, quickening my pace.</p>

  <p>But he restrained me, remarking: "There is no hurry. That was the sound of
  high explosive, and those flames suggest nitro compounds burning. Festina
  lente. There may be some other packets of high explosives."</p>

  <p>He had hardly finished speaking when a flash of dazzling violet light
  burst from the burning building. The windows flew out bodily, the roof opened
  in places, and almost at the same moment the clang of a violent explosion
  shook the ground under our feet, a puff of wind stirred our hair, and then
  came a clatter of falling glass and slates.</p>

  <p>We made our way at a leisurely pace towards the scene of the explosion,
  through streets lighted up by the ruddy glare from the burning factory. But
  others were less cautious. In a few minutes the street was filled by one of
  those crowds which, in London, seem mysteriously to spring up in an instant
  where but a moment before not a person was to be seen. Before we had reached
  the building, a fire-engine had rumbled past us, and already a sprinkling of
  policemen had appeared as if, like the traditional frogs, they had dropped
  from the clouds.</p>

  <p>In spite of the ferocity of its outbreak, the fire seemed to be no great
  matter, for even as we looked and before the fire-hose was fully run out, the
  flames began to die down. Evidently, they had been dealt with by means of
  extinguishers within the building, and the services of the engine would not
  be required after all. Noting this flat ending to what had seemed so
  promising a start, we were about to move off and resume our homeward journey
  when I observed a uniformed inspector who was known to us, and who, observing
  us at the same instant, made his way towards us through the crowd.</p>

  <p>"You remind me, sir," said be, when he had wished us good-evening, "of the
  stories of the vultures that make their way in the sky from nowhere when a
  camel drops dead in the desert. I don't mean anything uncomplimentary," he
  hastened to add. "I was only thinking of the wonderful instinct that has
  brought you to this very spot at this identical moment, as if you had smelt a
  case afar off."</p>

  <p>"Then your imagination has misled you," said Thorndyke, "for I haven't
  smelt a case, and I don't smell one now. Fires are not in my province."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," replied the inspector, "but bodies are, and the fireman tells
  me that there is a dead man up there&mdash;or at least the remains of one. I
  am going up to inspect. Do you care to come up with me?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke considered for a moment, but I knew what his answer would be,
  and I was not mistaken.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of professional interest, I should," he replied, "but I don't
  want to be summoned as a witness at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't, sir," the inspector agreed, "and I will see that you
  are not summoned, unless an expert witness is wanted. I need not mention that
  you have been here; but I should be glad of your opinion for my own guidance
  in investigating the case."</p>

  <p>He led us through the crowd to the door of the building, where we were
  joined by a fireman&mdash;whose helmet I should have liked to borrow&mdash;by
  whom we were piloted up the stairs. Half up we met the night-watchman,
  carrying an exhausted extinguisher and a big electric lantern, and he joined
  our procession, giving us the news as we ascended.</p>

  <p>"It's all safe up above," said he, "excepting the roof; and that isn't so
  very much damaged. The big windows saved it. They blew out and let off the
  force of the explosion. The floor isn't damaged at all. It's girder and
  concrete. But poor Mr. Manford caught it properly. He was fairly blown to
  bits."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how it happened?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't," was the reply. "When I came on duty Mr. Manford was up there in
  his private laboratory. Soon afterwards a friend of his&mdash;a foreign
  gentleman of the name of Bilsky&mdash;came to see him. I took him up, and
  then Mr. Manford said he had some business to do, and after that he had got a
  longish job to do and would be working late. So he said I might turn in and
  he would let me know when he had finished. And he did let me know with a
  vengeance, poor chap. I lay down in my clothes, and I hadn't been asleep
  above a couple of hours when some noise woke me up. Then there came a most
  almighty bang. I rushed for an extinguisher and ran upstairs, and there I
  found the big laboratory all ablaze, the windows blown out and the ceiling
  down. But it wasn't so bad as it looked. There wasn't very much stuff up
  there; only the experimental stuff, and that burned out almost at once. I got
  the rest of the fire out in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"What stuff is it that you are speaking of?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Celluloid, mostly, I think," replied the watchman. "They make films and
  other celluloid goods in the works. But Mr. Manford used to do experiments in
  the material up in his laboratory. This time he was working with alloys,
  melting them on the gas furnace. Dangerous thing to do with all that
  inflammable stuff about. I don't know what there was up there, exactly. Some
  of it was celluloid, I could see by the way it burned, but the Lord knows
  what it was that exploded. Some of the raw stuff, perhaps."</p>

  <p>At this point we reached the top floor, where a door blown off its hinges
  and a litter of charred wood fragments filled the landing. Passing through
  the yawning doorway, we entered the laboratory and looked on a hideous scene
  of devastation. The windows were mere holes, the ceiling a gaping space
  fringed with black and ragged lathing, through which the damaged roof was
  visible by the light of the watchman's powerful lantern. The floor was
  covered with the fallen plaster and fragments of blackened woodwork, but its
  own boards were only slightly burnt in places, owing, no doubt, to their
  being fastened directly to the concrete which formed the actual floor.</p>

  <p>"You spoke of some human remains," said the inspector.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said the watchman, "you may well say 'remains'. Just come here." He
  led the way over the rubbish to a corner of the laboratory, where he halted
  and threw the light of his lantern down on a brownish, dusty, globular object
  that lay on the floor half buried in plaster. "That's all that's left of poor
  Mr. Manford; that and a few other odd pieces. I saw a hand over the other
  side."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke picked up the head and placed it on the blackened remnant of a
  bench, where, with the aid of the watchman's lantern and the inspection lamp
  which I produced from our research-case, he examined it curiously. It was
  extremely, but unequally, scorched. One ear was completely shrivelled, and
  most of the face was charred to the bone. But the other ear was almost
  intact; and though most of the hair was burned away to the scalp, a tuft
  above the less damaged ear was only singed, so that it was possible to see
  that the hair had been black, with here and there a stray white hair.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made no comments, but I noticed that he examined the gruesome
  object minutely, taking nothing for granted. The inspector noticed this, too;
  and when the examination was finished, looked at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Anything abnormal, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke; "nothing that is not accounted for by fire and
  the explosion. I see he had no natural teeth, so he must have worn a complete
  set of false teeth. That should help in the formal identification, if the
  plates are not completely destroyed."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much need for identification," said the watchman, "seeing
  that there was nobody in the building but him and me. His friend went away
  about half-past twelve. I heard Mr. Manford let him out."</p>

  <p>"The doctor means at the inquest," the inspector explained. "Somebody has
  got to recognise the body if possible."</p>

  <p>He took the watchman's lantern, and throwing its light on the floor, began
  to search among the rubbish. Very soon he disinterred from under a heap of
  plaster the headless trunk. Both legs were attached, though the right was
  charred below the knee and the foot blown off, and one complete arm. The
  other arm&mdash;the right&mdash;was intact only to the elbow. Here, again,
  the burning was very unequal. In some parts the clothing had been burnt off
  or blown away completely; in others, enough was left to enable the watchman
  to recognise it with certainty. One leg was much more burnt than the other;
  and whereas the complete arm was only scorched, the dismembered one was
  charred almost to the bone. When the trunk had been carried to the bench and
  laid there beside the head, the lights were turned on it for Thorndyke to
  make his inspection.</p>

  <p>"It almost seems," said the police officer, as the hand was being
  examined, "as if one could guess how he was standing when the explosion
  occurred. I think I can make out finger-marks&mdash;pretty dirty ones,
  too&mdash;on the back of the hand, as if he had been standing with his hands
  clasped together behind him while he watched something that he was
  experimenting with." The inspector glanced for confirmation at Thorndyke, who
  nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I think you are right. They are very indistinct, but the
  marks are grouped like fingers. The small mark near the wrist suggests a
  little finger and the separate one near the knuckle looks like a fore-finger,
  while the remaining two marks are close together." He turned the hand over
  and continued "And there, in the palm, just between the roots of the third
  and fourth fingers, seems to be the trace of a thumb. But they are all very
  faint. You have a quick eye, inspector."</p>

  <p>The gratified officer, thus encouraged, resumed his explorations among the
  debris in company with the watchman&mdash;the fireman had retired after a
  professional look round&mdash;leaving Thorndyke to continue his examination
  of the mutilated corpse, at which I looked on unsympathetically. For we had
  had a long day and I was tired and longing to get home. At length I drew out
  my watch, and with a portentous yawn, entered a mild protest.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly two o'clock," said I. "Don't you think we had better be
  getting on? This really isn't any concern of ours, and there doesn't seem to
  be anything in it, from our point of view."</p>

  <p>"Only that we are keeping our intellectual joints supple," Thorndyke
  replied with a smile. "But it is getting late. Perhaps we had better adjourn
  the inquiry."</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, the inspector discovered the missing
  forearm&mdash;completely charred&mdash;with the fingerless remains of the
  hand, and almost immediately afterwards the watchman picked up a dental plate
  of some white metal, which seemed to be practically uninjured. But our brief
  inspection of these objects elicited nothing of interest, and having glanced
  at them, we took our departure, avoiding on the stairs an eager reporter, all
  agog for "copy."</p>

  <p>A few days later we received a visit, by appointment, from a Mr. Herdman,
  a solicitor who was unknown to us and who was accompanied by the widow of Mr.
  James Manford, the victim of the explosion. In the interval the inquest had
  been opened but had been adjourned for further examination of the premises
  and the remains. No mention had been made of our visit to the building, and
  so far as I knew nothing had been said to anybody on the subject.</p>

  <p>Mr. Herdman came to the point with business directness.</p>

  <p>"I have called," he said, "to secure your services, if possible, in regard
  to the matter of which I spoke in my letter. You have probably seen an
  account of the disaster in the papers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I read the report of the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Then you know the principal facts. The inquest, as you know, was
  adjourned for three weeks. When it is resumed; I should like to retain you to
  attend on behalf of Mrs. Manford."</p>

  <p>"To watch the case on her behalf?" Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly," replied Herdman. "I should ask you to inspect the
  premises and the remains of poor Mr. Manford, so that, at the adjourned
  inquest, you could give evidence to the effect that the explosion and the
  death of Mr. Manford were entirely due to accident."</p>

  <p>"Does anyone say that they were not?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not," Mr. Herdman replied hastily. "Not at all. But I
  happened, quite by chance, to see the manager of the 'Pilot' Insurance
  Society, on another matter, and I mentioned the case of Mr. Manford. He then
  let drop a remark which made me slightly uneasy. He observed that there was a
  suicide clause in the policy, and that the possibility of suicide would have
  to be ruled out before the claim could be settled. Which suggested a possible
  intention to contest the claim."</p>

  <p>"But," said Thorndyke, "I need not point out to you that if he sets up the
  theory of suicide, it is for him to prove it, not for you to disprove it. Has
  anything transpired which would lend colour to such a suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing material," was the reply. "But we should feel more happy if you
  could be present and give positive evidence that the death was
  accidental."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "would be hardly possible. But my feeling is that
  the suicide question is negligible. There is nothing to suggest it, so far as
  I know. Is there anything known to you?"</p>

  <p>The solicitor glanced at his client and replied somewhat evasively: "We
  are anxious to secure ourselves. Mrs. Manford is left very badly off, unless
  there is some personal property that we don't know about. If the insurance is
  not paid, she will be absolutely ruined. There isn't enough to pay the debts.
  And I think the suicide question might be raised&mdash;even
  successfully&mdash;on several points. Manford had been rather queer lately:
  jumpy and rather worried. Then, he was under notice to terminate his
  engagement at the works. His finances were in a confused state; goodness
  knows why, for he had a liberal salary. And then there was some domestic
  trouble. Mrs. Manford had actually consulted me about getting a separation.
  Some other woman, you know."</p>

  <p>"I should like to forget that," said Mrs. Manford; "and it wasn't that
  which worried him. Quite the contrary. Since it began he had been quite
  changed. So smart in his dress and so particular in his appearance. He even
  took to dyeing his hair. I remember that he opened a fresh bottle of dye the
  very morning before his death and took no end of trouble putting it on. It
  wasn't that entanglement that made him jumpy. It was his money affairs. He
  had too many irons in the fire."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke listened with patient attention to these rather irrelevant
  details and inquired: "What sort of irons?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," said Herdman. "About three months ago he had need for
  two thousand pounds; for what purpose, I can't say, but Mrs. Manford thinks
  it was to invest in certain valuables that he used to purchase from time to
  time from a Russian dealer named Bilsky. At any rate, he got this sum on
  short loan from a Mr. Clines, but meanwhile arranged for a longer loan with a
  Mr. Elliott on a note of hand and an agreement to insure his life for the
  amount.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, the policy was made out in Elliott's name, he having
  proved an insurable interest. So if the insurance is paid, Elliott is settled
  with. Otherwise the debt falls on the estate, which would be disastrous; and
  to make it worse, the day before his death, he drew out five hundred
  pounds&mdash;nearly the whole balance&mdash;as he was expecting to see Mr.
  Bilsky, who liked to be paid in bank-notes. He did see him, in fact, at the
  laboratory, but they couldn't have done any business, as no jewels were
  found."</p>

  <p>"And the bank-notes?"</p>

  <p>"Burned with the body, presumably. He must have had them with him."</p>

  <p>"You mentioned," said Thorndyke, "that he occasionally bought jewels from
  this Russian. What became of them?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" replied Herdman, "there is a gleam of hope there. He had a safe
  deposit somewhere. We haven't located it yet, but we shall. There may be
  quite a nice little nest-egg in it. But meanwhile there is the debt to
  Elliott. He wrote to Manford about it a day or two ago. You have the letter,
  I think," he added, addressing Mrs. Manford, who thereupon produced two
  envelopes from her handbag and laid them on the table.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Elliott's letter," she said. "Merely a friendly reminder, you
  see, telling him that he is just off to the Continent and that he has given
  his wife a power of attorney to act in his absence."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced through the letter and made a few notes of its contents.
  Then he looked inquiringly at the other envelope.</p>

  <p>"That," said Mrs. Manford, "'is a photograph of my husband. I thought it
  might help you if you were going to examine the body."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke drew the portrait out and regarded it thoughtfully, I
  recalled the shapeless, blackened fragments of its subject; and when he
  passed it to me, I inspected it with a certain grim interest, and mentally
  compared it with those grisly remains. It was a commonplace face, rather
  unsymmetrical&mdash;the nose was deflected markedly to the left, and the left
  eye had a pronounced divergent squint. The bald head, with an abundant black
  fringe and an irregular scar on the the side of the forehead, sought
  compensation in a full beard and moustache, both apparently jet-black. It was
  not an attractive countenance, and it was not improved by a rather odd-shaped
  ear&mdash;long, lobeless, and pointed above, like the ear of a satyr.</p>

  <p>"I realise your position," said Thorndyke, "but I don't quite see what you
  want of me. If," he continued, addressing the solicitor, "you had thought of
  my giving ex parte evidence, dismiss the idea. I am not a witness-advocate.
  All I can undertake to do is to investigate the case and try to discover what
  really happened. But in that case, whatever I may discover I shall disclose
  to the coroner. Would that suit you?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked doubtful and rather glum, but Mrs. Manford interposed,
  firmly: "Why not? We are not proposing any deception, but I am certain that
  he did not commit suicide. I agree unreservedly to what you propose."</p>

  <p>With this understanding&mdash;which the lawyer was disposed to boggle
  at&mdash;our visitors took their leave. As soon as they were gone, I gave
  utterance to the surprise with which I had listened to Thorndyke's
  proposal.</p>

  <p>"I am astonished at your undertaking this case. Of course, you have given
  them fair warning, but still, it will be unpleasant if you have to give
  evidence unfavourable to your client."</p>

  <p>"Very," he agreed. "But what makes you think I may have to?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you seem to reject the probability of suicide, but have you
  forgotten the evidence at the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have," he replied blandly. "Let us go over it again."</p>

  <p>I fetched the report from the office, and spreading it out on the table
  began to read it aloud. Passing over the evidence of the inspector and the
  fireman, I came to that of the night-watchman.</p>

  <p>"Shortly after I came on duty at ten o'clock, a foreign, gentleman named
  Bilsky called to see Mr. Manford. I knew him by sight, because he had called
  once or twice before at about the same time. I took him up to the laboratory,
  where Mr. Manford was doing something with a big crucible on the gas furnace.
  He told me that he had some business to transact with Mr. Bilsky and when he
  had finished he would let him out. Then he was going to do some experiments
  in making alloys, and as they would probably take up most of the night he
  said I might as well turn in. He said he would call me when he was ready to
  go. So I told him to be careful with the furnace and not set the place on
  fire and burn me in my bed, and then I went downstairs. I had a look round to
  see that everything was in order, and then I took off my boots and laid down.
  About half-past twelve I heard Mr. Manford and Bilsky come down. I recognised
  Mr. Bilsky by a peculiar cough that he had and by the sound of his stick and
  his limping tread&mdash;he had something the matter with his right foot and
  walked quite lame."</p>

  <p>"You say that the deceased came down with him," said the coroner. "Are you
  quite sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose Mr. Manford came down with him, but I can't say I
  actually heard him."</p>

  <p>"You did not hear him go up again?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. But I was rather sleepy and I wasn't listening very
  particular. Well, then I went to sleep and slept till about half-past one,
  when some noise woke me. I was just getting up to see what it was when I
  heard a tremendous bang, right overhead. I ran down and turned the gas off at
  the main and then I got a fire extinguisher and ran up to the laboratory. The
  place seemed to be all in a blaze, but it wasn't much of a fire after all,
  for by the time the fire engines arrived I had got it practically out."</p>

  <p>The witness then described the state of the laboratory and the finding of
  the body, but as this was already known to us, I passed on to the evidence of
  the next witness, the superintendent of the fire brigade, who had made a
  preliminary inspection of the premises. It was a cautious statement and
  subject to the results of a further examination; but clearly the officer was
  not satisfied as to the cause of the outbreak. There seemed to have been two
  separate explosions, one near a cupboard and another&mdash;apparently the
  second&mdash;in the cupboard itself; and there seemed to be a burned track
  connecting the two spots. This might have been accidental or it might have
  been arranged. Witness did not think that the explosive was celluloid. It
  seemed to be a high explosive of some kind. But further investigations were
  being made.</p>

  <p>The superintendent was followed by Mrs. Manford, whose evidence was
  substantially similar to what she and Mr. Herdman had told us, and by the
  police surgeon, whose description of the remains conveyed nothing new to us.
  Finally, the inquest was adjourned for three weeks to allow of further
  examination of the premises and the remains.</p>

  <p>"Now," I said, as I folded up the report, "I don't see how you are able to
  exclude suicide. If the explosion was arranged to occur when Manford was in
  the laboratory, what object, other than suicide, can be imagined?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked at me with an expression that I knew only too well. "Is
  it impossible," he asked, "to imagine that the object might have been
  homicide?"</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "there was no one there but Manford&mdash;after Bilsky
  left."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he agreed, dryly; "after Bilsky left. But up to that time there
  were two persons there."</p>

  <p>I must confess that I was startled, but as I rapidly reviewed the
  circumstances I percieved the cogency of Thorndyke's suggestion. Bilsky had
  been present when Manford dismissed the night-watchman. He knew that there
  would be no interruption. The inflammable and explosive materials were there,
  ready to his hand. Then Bilsky had gone down to the door alone instead of
  being conducted down and let out; a very striking circumstance, this. Again,
  no jewels had been found though the meeting had been ostensibly for the
  purpose of a deal; and the bank-notes had vanished utterly. This was very
  remarkable. In view of the large sum, it was nearly certain that the notes
  would be in a close bundle, and we all know how difficult it is to burn
  tightly-folded paper. Yet they had vanished without leaving a trace. Finally,
  there was Bilsky himself. Who was he? Apparently a dealer in stolen
  property&mdash;a hawker of the products of robbery and murder committed
  during the revolution.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "the theory of homicide is certainly tenable. But
  unless some new facts can be produced, it must remain a matter of
  speculation."</p>

  <p>"I think, Jervis," he rejoined, "you must be overlooking the facts that
  are known to us. We were there. We saw the place within a few minutes of the
  explosion and we examined the body. What we saw established a clear
  presumption of homicide, and what we have heard this, morning confirms it. I
  may say that I communicated my suspicions the very next day to the coroner
  and to Superintendent Miller."</p>

  <p>"Then you must have seen more than I did," I began. But he shook his head
  and cut short my protestations.</p>

  <p>"You saw what I saw, Jervis, but you did not interpret its meaning.
  However, it is not too late. Try to recall the details of our adventure and
  what our visitors have told us. I don't think you will then entertain the
  idea of suicide."</p>

  <p>I was about to put one or two leading questions, but at this moment
  footsteps became audible ascending our stairs. The knock which followed
  informed me that our visitor was Superintendent Miller, and I rose to admit
  him.</p>

  <p>"Just looked in to report progress," he announced as he subsided into an
  arm-chair. "Not much to report, but what there is supports your view of the
  case. Bilsky has made a clean bolt. Never went home to his hotel. Evidently
  meant to skedaddle, as he has left nothing of any value behind. But it was a
  stupid move, for it would have raised suspicion in any case. The notes were a
  consecutive batch. All the numbers are known, but, of course, none of them
  have turned up yet. We have made inquiries about Bilsky, and gather that he
  is a shady character; practically a fence who deals in the jewellery stolen
  from those unfortunate Russian aristocrats. But we shall have him all right.
  His description has been circulated at all the seaports and he is an easy man
  to spot with his lame foot and his stick and a finger missing from his right
  hand."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke nodded, and seemed to reflect for a moment. Then he asked: "Have
  you made any other inquiries?"</p>

  <p>"No; there is nothing more to find out until we get hold of our man, and
  when we do, we shall look to you to secure the conviction. I suppose you are
  quite certain as to your facts?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"I am never certain until after the event. We can only act on
  probabilities."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the superintendent, casting a sly look at me; "but
  your probabilities are good enough for me."</p>

  <p>With this, he picked up his hat and departed, leaving us to return to the
  occupations that our visitors had interrupted.</p>

  <p>I heard no more of the Manford case for about a week, and assumed that
  Thorndyke's interest in it had ceased. But I was mistaken, as I discovered
  when he remarked casually one evening: "No news of Bilsky, so far; and time
  is running on. I am proposing to make a tentative move in a new direction." I
  looked at him inquiringly, and he continued: "It appears, 'from information
  received,' that Elliott had some dealings with him, so I propose to call at
  his house to-morrow and see if we can glean any news of the lost sheep."</p>

  <p>"But Elliott is abroad," I objected.</p>

  <p>"True; but his wife isn't; and she evidently knows all about his affairs.
  I have invited Miller to come with me in case he would like to put any
  questions; and you may as well come, too, if you are free."</p>

  <p>It did not sound like a very thrilling adventure, but one never knew with
  Thorndyke. I decided to go with him, and at that the matter dropped, though I
  speculated a little curiously on the source of the information. So,
  apparently, had the superintendent, for when he arrived on the following
  morning he proceeded to throw out a few cautious feelers, but got nothing for
  his pains beyond vague generalities.</p>

  <p>"It is a purely tentative proceeding," said Thorndyke, "and you mustn't be
  disappointed if nothing comes of it."</p>

  <p>"I shall be, all the same," replied Miller, with a sly glance at my
  senior, and with this we set forth on our quest.</p>

  <p>The Elliotts' house was, as I knew, in some part of Wimbledon, and thither
  we made our way by train. From the station we started along a wide, straight
  main street from which numbers of smaller streets branched off. At the corner
  of one of these I noticed a man standing, apparently watching our approach;
  and something in his appearance seemed to me familiar. Suddenly he took off
  his hat, looked curiously into its interior, and put it on again. Then he
  turned about and walked quickly down the side street. I looked at his
  retreating figure as we crossed the street, wondering who he could be. And
  then it flashed upon me that the resemblance was to a certain ex-sergeant
  Barber whom Thorndyke occasionally employed for observation duties. Just as I
  reached this conclusion, Thorndyke halted and looked about him
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we have come too far," said he. "I fancy we ought to have
  gone down that last turning." We accordingly faced about and walked back to
  the corner, where Thorndyke read out the name, Mendoza Avenue.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "this is the way," and we thereupon turned down the
  Avenue, following it to the bottom, where it ended in a cross-road, the name
  of which, Berners Park, I recognised as that which I had seen on Elliott's
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Sixty-four is the number," said Thorndyke, "so as this corner house is
  forty-six and the next is forty-eight, it will be a little way along on this
  side, just about where you can see that smoke&mdash;which, by the way, seems
  to be coming out of a window."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" I exclaimed. "The staircase window, apparently. Not our
  house, I hope!"</p>

  <p>But it was. We read the number and the name, 'Green Bushes', on the gate
  as we came up to it, and we hurried up the short path to the door. There was
  no knocker, but when Miller fixed his thumb on the bell-push, we heard a loud
  ringing within. But there was no response; and meanwhile the smoke poured
  more and more densely out of the open window above.</p>

  <p>"Rum!" exclaimed Miller, sticking to the bell-push like a limpet. "House
  seems to be empty."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is." Thorndyke replied calmly.</p>

  <p>The superintendent looked at him with quick suspicion, and then glanced at
  the ground-floor window.</p>

  <p>"That window is unfastened," said he, "and here comes a constable."</p>

  <p>Sure enough, a policeman was approaching quickly, looking up at the
  houses. Suddenly he perceived the smoke and quickened his pace, arriving just
  as Thorndyke had pulled down the upper window-sash and was preparing to climb
  over into the room. The constable hailed him sternly, but a brief explanation
  from Miller reduced the officer to a state of respectful subservience, and we
  all followed Thorndyke through the open window, from which smoke now began to
  filter.</p>

  <p>"Send the constable upstairs to give the alarm," Thorndyke instructed
  Miller in a low tone. The order was given without question, and the next
  moment the officer was bounding up the stairs, roaring like a whole fire
  brigade. Meanwhile, the superintendent browsed along the hall through the
  dense smoke, sniffing inquisitively, and at length approached the street
  door. Suddenly, from the heart of the reek, his voice issued in tones of
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm hanged! It's a plumber's smoke-rocket. Some fool has stuck it
  through into the letter-cage!"</p>

  <p>In the silence which followed this announcement I heard an angry voice
  from above demand: "What is all this infernal row about? And what are you
  doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you see that the house is on fire?" was the constable's, stern
  rejoinder. "You'd better come down and help to put it out."</p>

  <p>The command was followed by the sound of descending footsteps, on which
  Thorndyke ran quickly up the stairs, followed by the superintendent and me.
  We met the descending party on the landing, opposite a window, and here we
  all stopped, gazing at one another with mutual curiosity. The man who
  accompanied the constable looked distinctly alarmed&mdash;as well he
  might&mdash;and somewhat hostile.</p>

  <p>"Who put that smoke in the hall?" Miller demanded fiercely. "And why
  didn't you come down when you heard us ringing the bell?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you a talking about." the man replied sulkily, "or what
  business this is of yours. Who are you? And what are you doing in my
  house?"</p>

  <p>"In your house?" repeated Thorndyke. "Then you will be Mr. Elliott?"</p>

  <p>The man turned a startled glance on him and replied angrily: "Never you
  mind who I am. Get out of this house."</p>

  <p>"But I do mind who you are," Thorndyke rejoined mildly. "I came here to
  see Mr. Elliott. Are you Mr. Elliott?</p>

  <p>"No, I am not. Mr. Elliott is abroad. If you like to send a letter here
  for him, I will forward it when I get his address."</p>

  <p>While this conversation had been going on, I had been examining the
  stranger, not without curiosity. For his appearance was somewhat unusual. In
  the first place, he wore an unmistakable wig, and his shaven face bore an
  abundance of cuts and scratches, suggesting a recently and unskilfully mown
  beard. His spectacles did not disguise a pronounced divergent squint of the
  left eye; but what specially caught my attention was the ear&mdash;large ear,
  lobeless and pointed at the tip like the ear of a satyr. As I looked at this,
  and at the scraped face, the squint and the wig, a strange suspicion flashed
  into my mind; and then, as I noted that the nose was markedly deflected to
  the left, I turned to glance at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling us your name?" the latter asked blandly.</p>

  <p>"My name is&mdash;is&mdash;Johnson; Frederick Johnson."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Thorndyke. "I thought it was Manford&mdash;James
  Manford&mdash;and I think so still. I suggest that you have a scar on the
  right side of your forehead, just under the wig. May we see?"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke spoke the name, the man turned a horrible livid grey and
  started back as if to retreat up the stairs. But the constable blocked the
  way; and as the man was struggling to push past, Miller adroitly snatched off
  the wig; and there, on the forehead, was the tell-tale scar.</p>

  <p>For an appreciable time we all stood stock-still like the figures of a
  tableau. Then Thorndyke turned to the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I charge this man, James Manford, with the murder of Stephan Bilsky."</p>

  <p>Again there was a brief interval of intolerable silence. In the midst of
  it, we heard the street door open and shut, and a woman's voice called up the
  stairs: "Whatever is all this smoke? Are you up there, Jim?"</p>

  <p>I pass over the harrowing details of the double arrest. I am not a
  policeman, and to me such scenes are intensely repugnant. But we must needs
  stay until two taxis and four constables had conveyed the prisoners away from
  the still reeking house to the caravanserai of the law. Then, at last, we
  went forth with relief into the fresh air and bent our steps towards the
  station.</p>

  <p>"I take it," Miller said reflectively, "that you never suspected
  Bilsky?"</p>

  <p>"I did at first. But when Mrs. Manford and the solicitor told their tale I
  realised that he was the victim and that Manford must be the murderer."</p>

  <p>"Let us have the argument," said I. "It is obvious that I have been a
  blockhead, but I don't mind our old friend here knowing it."</p>

  <p>"Not a blockhead, Jervis," he corrected. "You were half asleep that night
  and wholly uninterested. If you had been attending to the matter, you would
  have observed several curious and anomalous appearances. For instance, you
  would have noticed that the body was, in parts, completely charred, and
  brittle. Now we saw the outbreak of the fire and we found it extinguished
  when we reached the building. Its duration was a matter of minutes; quite
  insufficient to reduce a body to that state. For, as you know, a human body
  is an extremely incombustible thing. The appearance suggested the destruction
  of a body which had been already burnt; and this suggestion was emphasised by
  the curiously unequal distribution of the charring. The right hand was burnt
  to a cinder and blown to pieces. The left hand was only scorched. The right
  foot was utterly destroyed, but the left foot was nearly intact. The face was
  burned away completely, and yet there were parts of the head where the hair
  was only singed.</p>

  <p>"Naturally, with these facts in mind, I scrutinised those remains
  narrowly. And presently something much more definite and sinister came to
  light. On the left hand, there was a faint impression of another
  hand&mdash;very indistinct and blurred, but still unmistakably a hand."</p>

  <p>"I remember," said I, "the inspector pointed it out as evidence that the
  deceased had been standing with his hands clasped before or behind him; and I
  must admit that it seemed a reasonable inference."</p>

  <p>"So it did, because you were both assuming that the man had been alone and
  that it must therefore have been the impression of his own hand. For that
  reason, neither of you looked at it critically. If you had, you would have
  seen at once that it was the impression of a left hand."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," I confessed ruefully. "As the man was stated to
  have been alone, the hand impression did not interest me. And it was a mere
  group of smudges, after all. You are sure that it was a left hand?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," he replied. "Blurred as the smudges were, one could make out the
  relative lengths of the fingers. And there was the thumb mark at the distal
  end of the palm, but pointing to the outer side of the hand. Try how you may,
  you can't get a right hand into that position.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, here was a crucial fact. The mark of a left hand on a left
  hand proved the presence of a second person, and at once raised a strong
  presumption of homicide, especially when considered in conjunction with the
  unaccountable state of the body. During the evening, a visitor had come and
  gone, and on him&mdash;Bilsky&mdash;the suspicion naturally fell. But Mrs.
  Manford unwittingly threw an entirely new light on the case. You remember she
  told us that her husband had opened a new bottle of hair dye on the very
  morning before the explosion and had applied it with unusual care. Then his
  hair was dyed. But the hair of the corpse was not dyed. Therefore the corpse
  was not the corpse of Manford. Further, the presumption of murder applied now
  to Manford, and the body almost certainly was that of Bilsky."</p>

  <p>"How did you deduce that the hair of the corpse was not dyed?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't deduce it at all. I observed it. You remember a little patch of
  hair above the right ear, very much singed but still recognisable as hair?
  Well, in that patch I made out distinctly two or three white hairs.
  Naturally, when Mrs. Manford spoke of the dye, I recalled those white hairs,
  for though you may find silver hairs among the gold, you don't find them
  among the dyed. So the corpse could not be Manford's and was presumably that
  of Bilsky.</p>

  <p>"But the instant that this presumption was made, a quantity of fresh
  evidence arose to support it. The destruction of the body was now
  understandable. Its purpose was to prevent identification. The parts
  destroyed were the parts that had to be destroyed for that purpose: the face
  was totally unrecognisable, and the right hand and right foot were burnt and
  shattered to fragments. But these were Bilsky's personal marks. His right
  hand was mutilated and his right foot deformed. And the fact that the false
  teeth found were undoubtedly Manford's was conclusive evidence of the
  intended deception.</p>

  <p>"Then there were those very queer financial transactions, of which my
  interpretation was this: Manford borrowed two thousand pounds from Clines.
  With this he opened an account in the name of Elliott. As Elliott, he lent
  himself two thousand pounds which he repaid Clines&mdash;subject to an
  insurance of his life for that amount, taken out in Elliott's name."</p>

  <p>"Then he would have gained nothing," I objected.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, he would have stood to gain two thousand pounds on proof
  of his own death. That, I assumed, was his scheme: to murder Bilsky, to
  arrange for Bilsky's corpse to personate his own, and then, when the
  insurance was paid, to abscond the company of some woman this sum, with the
  valuables that he had taken from Bilsky, and the five hundred pounds that he
  had withdrawn from the bank.</p>

  <p>"But this was only theory. It had to be tested; and as we had Elliott's
  address, I did the only thing that was possible. I employed our friend,
  ex-Sergeant Barber, to watch the house. He took lodgings in a house nearly
  opposite and kept up continuous observation, which soon convinced him that
  there was someone on the premises besides Mrs. Elliott. Then, late one night,
  he saw a man come out and walk away quickly. He followed the man for some
  distance, until the stranger turned back and began to retrace his steps. Then
  Barber accosted him, asking for a direction, and carefully inspecting him.
  The man's appearance tallied exactly with the description that I had
  given&mdash;I had assumed that he would probably shave off his
  beard&mdash;and with the photograph; so Barber, having seen him home,
  reported to me. And that is the whole story."</p>

  <p>"Not quite the whole," said Miller, with a sly grin. "There is that
  smoke-rocket. If it hadn't been for the practical joker who slipped that
  through the letter-slit, we could never have got into that house. I call it a
  most remarkable coincidence."</p>

  <p>"So do I," Thorndyke agreed, without moving a muscle; "but there is a
  special providence that watches over medical jurists."</p>

  <p>We were silent for a few moments. Then I remarked: "This will come as a
  terrible shock to Mrs. Manford."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it will," Thorndyke agreed. "But it will be better for her
  than if Manford had absconded with this woman, taking practically every penny
  that he possessed with him. She stood to lose a worthless husband in either
  event. At least we have saved her from poverty. And, knowing the facts, we
  were morally and legally bound to further the execution of justice."</p>

  <p>"A very proper sentiment," said the superintendent, "though I am not quite
  clear as to the legal aspects of that smoke-rocket."</p>
