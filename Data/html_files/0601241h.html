  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CREDIT this story to Wild Pat Morgan, that laughing,
  reckless, black-haired grandson of Ireland's peat bogs. To Pat Morgan,
  one-time flying lieutenant of the AEF, ex-inventor, amateur boxer, and
  drinking companion <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

  <p>I met Pat Morgan at the country-club bar, one of those casual things.
  After the third highball we were calling each other by our first names. By
  the sixth we had dragged the family skeletons out of the closet and were
  shaking the dust off them. A little later we were weeping on one another's
  shoulders, and that's how it began.</p>

  <p>We got pretty well acquainted that evening, and afterwards our friendship
  grew. We saw a lot of each other when he brought his ship to the airport
  where I kept mine. His wife was dead, and he was a rather lonely figure
  evenings; so I used to have him up to the house for dinner often.</p>

  <p>He had been rather young when the war broke out, but had managed to get to
  France and the front just before the end. I think he shot down three enemy
  planes, although he was just a kid. I had that from another flyer; Pat never
  talked about it. But he was full of flying anecdotes about other war-time
  pilots and about his own stunting experiences in the movies. He had followed
  this latter profession for several years.</p>

  <p>All of which has nothing to do with the real story other than to explain
  how I became well enough acquainted with Pat Morgan to be on hand when he
  told the strange tale of his flight to Russia, of the scientist who mastered
  Time, of the man from 50,000 B.C. called Jimber Jaw.</p>

  <p>We were lunching together at The Vendome that day. I had been waiting for
  Pat at the bar, discussing with some others the disappearance of Stone, the
  wrestler. Everyone is familiar, of course, with Stone's meteoric rise to fame
  as an athlete and a high-salaried star in the movies, and his vanishing had
  become a minor ten-days' wonder. We were trying to decide if Stone had been
  kidnapped, whether the ransom letters received were the work of cranks, when
  Pat Morgan came in with the extra edition of the <i>Herald and Express</i>
  that the newsboys were hawking in the streets.</p>

  <p>I followed Pat to our table and he spread the paper out. A glaring
  headline gave the meat of the story.</p>

  <p>"So they've found him!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Pat Morgan nodded. "The police had me in on it. I've just come from
  Headquarters." He shrugged, frowned, and then began to talk slowly:</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I'VE always been inclined to putter around with inventions
  (Pat Morgan said), and after my wife died I tried to forget my loneliness by
  centering my interest on my laboratory work. It was a poor substitute for the
  companionship I had lost, but at that I guess it proved my salvation.</p>

  <p>I was working on a new fuel which was much cheaper and less bulky than
  gasoline; but I found that it required radical changes in engine design, and
  I lacked the capital to put my blueprints into metal.</p>

  <p>About this time my grandfather died and left me a considerable fortune.
  Quite a slice of it went into experimental engines before I finally perfected
  one. It was a honey.</p>

  <p>I built a ship and installed my engine in it; then I tried to sell the
  patents on both engine and fuel to the Government&mdash;but something
  happened. When I reached a certain point in these official negotiations I ran
  into an invisible stone wall&mdash;I was stopped dead. I couldn't even get a
  permit to manufacture my engine.</p>

  <p>I never did find out who or what stopped me, but I remembered the case of
  the Doble steam car. Perhaps you will recall that, also.</p>

  <p>Then I got sore and commenced to play around with the Russians. The
  war-winds were already beginning to blow again in Europe, and the comrades of
  the Soviet were decidedly interested in new aircraft developments. They had
  money to burn, and their representatives had a way with them that soothed the
  injured ego of a despondent inventor. They finally made me a splendid offer
  to take my plans and formulae to Moscow and manufacture engines and fuel for
  them. In addition, as a publicity and propaganda stunt, they offered a
  whacking bonus if I would put my new developments to the test by
  <i>flying</i> there.</p>

  <p>I jumped at this chance to make monkeys out of those bureaucratic
  boneheads in Washington. I'd show those guys what they were missing.</p>

  <p>During the course of these negotiations I met Dr. Stade who was also
  flirting with the brethren of the U.S.S.R. Professor Marvin Stade, to give
  him his full name and title, and he was quite a guy. A big fellow, built like
  an ox, with a choleric temper and the most biting pair of blue eyes I've ever
  gazed upon. You must have read in the papers about Stade's experiments with
  frozen dogs and monkeys. He used to freeze them up solid for days and weeks,
  and then thaw them out and bring them alive again. He had also been
  conducting some unique studies in surgical hypnosis, and otherwise stepping
  on the toes of the constituted medical poobahs.</p>

  <p>The S.P.C.A. and the Department of Health had thrown a monkey-wrench into
  Stade's program&mdash;stopped him cold&mdash;and there was fire in his eye.
  We were a couple of soreheads, perhaps, but I think we had a right to be.
  Lord knows we were both sincere in what we were trying to accomplish&mdash;he
  to fight disease, I to add something to the progress of aviation.</p>

  <p>The Reds welcomed Dr. Stade with open arms. They agreed not only to let
  him carry his experiments as far as he liked but to finance him as well. They
  even promised to let him use human beings as subjects and to furnish said
  humans in job lots. I suppose they had a large supply of
  counter-revolutionists on hand.</p>

  <p>When Stade found that I planned to fly my ship to Moscow, he asked if he
  might go along. He was a showman as well as a scientist, and the publicity
  appealed to him. I told him the risk was too great, that I didn't want to
  take the responsibility of any life other than my own, but he pooh-poohed
  every objection in that bull-bellow voice of his. Finally I shrugged and said
  okay.</p>

  <p>I won't bore you with the details of the flight. You couldn't have read
  about it in the papers, of course, for the word went out through official
  channels that we were to get a cold shoulder. The press put a blanket of
  silence on us, and that was that. There were passport difficulties, refusals
  to certify the plane, all that sort of thing. But we managed to muddle
  through.</p>

  <p>The engine functioned perfectly. So did the fuel. So did everything,
  including my navigation, until we were flying over the most God-forsaken
  terrain anyone ever saw&mdash;some place in Northern Siberia according to our
  maps. That's where my new-fangled carburetor chose to go haywire.</p>

  <p>We had about ten thousand feet elevation at the time, but that wasn't much
  help. There was no place to land. As far as I could see there was nothing but
  forests and rivers&mdash;hundreds of rivers.</p>

  <p>I went into a straight glide with a tail-wind, figuring I could cover a
  lot more territory that way than I could by spiraling and every second I was
  keeping my eyes peeled for a spot, however small, where I might set her down
  without damage. We'd never get out of that endless forest, I knew, unless we
  flew out.</p>

  <p>I've always liked trees&mdash;a nature-lover at heart&mdash;but as I
  looked down on that vast host of silent sentinels of the wilderness, I felt
  the chill of fear and something that was akin to hate. There was a loneliness
  and an emptiness inside me. There they stood&mdash;in regiments, in
  divisions, in armies, waiting to seize us and hold us forever; to hold our
  broken bodies, for when we struck them, they would crush us, tear us to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Then I saw a little patch of yellow far ahead. It was no larger than the
  palm of my hand, it seemed, but it was an open space&mdash;a tiny sanctuary
  in the very heart of the enemy's vast encampment. As we approached, it grew
  larger until at last it resolved itself into a few acres of reddish yellow
  soil devoid of trees. It was the most beautiful landscape I have ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>As the ship rolled to a stop on fairly level ground, I turned and looked
  at Dr. Stade. He was lighting a cigarette. He paused, with the match still
  burning, and grinned at me. I knew then that he was regular. It's funny, but
  neither one of us had spoken since the motor quit. That was as it should have
  been; for there was nothing to say&mdash;at least nothing that would have
  meant anything.</p>

  <p>We got down and looked around. Beside us, a little river ran north to
  empty finally into the Arctic Ocean. Our tiny patch of salvation lay in a
  bend on the west side of the river. On the east side was a steep cliff that
  rose at least three hundred feet above the river. The lowest stratum looked
  like dirty glass. Above that were strata of conglomerate and sedimentary
  rock; and, topping all, the grim forest scowled down upon us menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Funny looking rock," I commented, pointing toward the lowest ledge.</p>

  <p>"Ice," said Stade. "My friend, you are looking at the remnants of the late
  lamented glacial period that raised havoc with the passing of the
  Pleistocene. What are we going to use for food?"</p>

  <p>"We got guns," I reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was very thoughtful of you to get permission to bring firearms
  and ammunition, but what are we going to shoot?"</p>

  <p>I shrugged. "There must be something. What are all these trees for? They
  must have been put here for birds to sit on. In the meantime we've sandwiches
  and a couple of thermoses of hot coffee. I hope it's hot."</p>

  <p>"So do I."</p>

  <p>It wasn't....</p>

  <p>I took a shotgun and hunted up river. I got a hare&mdash;mostly fur and
  bones&mdash;and a brace of birds that resembled partridges. By the time I got
  back to camp the weather had become threatening. There was a storm north of
  us. We could see the lightning, and faint thunder began to growl.</p>

  <p>We had already wheeled the plane to the west and highest part of our
  clearing and staked it down as close under the shelter of the forest as we
  could. Nothing else to do.</p>

  <p>By the time we had cooked and eaten our supper it commenced to rain. The
  long, northern twilight was obliterated by angry clouds that rolled low out
  of the north. Thunder bombarded us. Lightning laid down a barrage of pale
  brilliance all about. We crawled into the cabin of the plane and spread our
  mattresses and blankets on the floor behind the seats.</p>

  <p>It rained. And when I say it rained, I mean it <i>rained.</i> It could
  have given ancient Armenia seven-and-a-half honor tricks and set it at least
  three; for what it took forty days and forty nights to do in ancient Armenia,
  it did in one night on that nameless river somewhere in Siberia, U.S.S.R.
  I'll never forget that downpour.</p>

  <p>I don't know how long I slept, but when I awoke it was raining not cats
  and dogs only, but the entire animal kingdom. I crawled out and looked
  through a window. The next flash of lightning showed the river swirling
  within a few feet of the outer wing.</p>

  <p>I shook Dr. Stade awake and called his attention to the danger of our
  situation.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" he said. "Wait till she floats." He turned over and went to
  sleep again. Of course it wasn't his ship, and perhaps he was a strong
  swimmer; I wasn't.</p>

  <p>I lay awake most of what was left of the night. The rising flood was a
  foot deep around the landing gear at the worst; then she commenced to go
  down.</p>

  <p>The next morning the river was running in a new channel a few yards from
  the ship, and the cliff had receded at least fifty feet toward the east. The
  face of it had fallen into the river and been washed away. The lowest stratum
  was pure and gleaming ice.</p>

  <p>I called Stade's attention to the topographical changes.</p>

  <p>"That's interesting," he said. "By any chance is there any partridge or
  hare left?"</p>

  <p>There was, and we ate it. Then we got out and sloshed around in the mud. I
  started to work on the carburetor. Stade studied the havoc wrought by the
  storm.</p>

  <p>He was down by the edge of the river looking at the new cliff face when he
  called to me excitedly. I had never before seen the burly professor exhibit
  any enthusiasm except when he was damning the S.P.C.A. and the health
  authorities. I went on the run.</p>

  <p>I could see nothing to get excited about. "What's eating you?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Come here, you dumb Irishman, and see a man fifty thousand years old, or
  thereabouts." Stade was mainly Scotch and German, which may have accounted
  for his crazy sense of humor.</p>

  <p>I was worried. I thought maybe it might be the heat, but there wasn't any
  heat. No more could it have been the altitude; so I figured it must be
  hereditary, and crawled down and walked over to him.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said. He pointed across the river at the cliff.</p>

  <p>I looked&mdash;and there it was. Frozen into the solid ice, was the body
  of a man. He was clothed in furs and had a mighty beard. He lay on his side
  with his head resting on one arm, as though he were soundly sleeping.</p>

  <p>Stade was awe struck. He just stood there, goggle-eyed, staring at the
  corpse. Finally he drew in his breath in a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, Pat, that we are looking at a man who may have lived
  fifty thousand years ago, a survivor of the old Stone Age?"</p>

  <p>"What a break for you, Doc," I said.</p>

  <p>"Break for me? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You can thaw him out and bring him to life."</p>

  <p>He looked at me in a sort of blank way, as though he didn't comprehend
  what I was saying. His lips moved, mumbling, then he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he's been frozen too long," he said.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand years is quite a while, but wouldn't it be worth trying?
  Keep you busy while I'm fixing things to get us out of here."</p>

  <p>Again he fixed his blank stare upon me. His eyes were cold and
  expressionless as that distant cliff of ice. "All right, Paddy me boy," he
  said suddenly. "But you'll have to help me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MY suggestion was a joke, of course, but Stade was in deadly
  earnest once he got started. I wasn't much help, I'm afraid, after the first
  couple of days, for I came down with a queer combination of chills and fever
  that had me light-headed most of the time. But I worked when I could.</p>

  <p>It took us two weeks to build a rude hut of saplings and chink it with
  clay. It had a fireplace and a bench for the queer paraphernalia that Stade
  had brought along&mdash;more gadgets than you could shake a stick at. Then it
  took us another two weeks to chip our cave man out of the ice. We had to be
  careful; there was danger of breaking him.</p>

  <p>I'm the one who gave our corpse his name. There in the ice, with his
  skin-clad body and his hairy face, he looked like a big lantern-jawed grizzly
  I'd seen one time up the Yellowstone. Jimber Jaw had been the grizzly's name,
  and that's what I called our discovery. That fever had me so dizzy, I tell
  you, that I felt like a man on a spree most of the time.</p>

  <p>Anyway, we worked all around our frozen subject, leaving him encased in a
  small block of the glacier. Then we lowered him to the ground, floated him
  across the river, and dragged him up to the laboratory on a crude sled we had
  built for that purpose.</p>

  <p>All the time we were working on him we did a lot of thinking. I kept on
  treating the whole thing as a sort of joke, but Stade grew more grimly
  serious with every day. He worked with a furious driving energy that swept me
  along. Nights, by the fire, he would talk on and on about the memories that
  were locked in that frozen brain. What sights had those ice-cased eyes beheld
  in the days when the world was young? What loves, what hates had stirred that
  mighty breast?</p>

  <p>Here was a creature that had lived in the days of the mammoth and the
  saber-tooth and the great flying monsters. He had survived against the odds,
  with only a stone spear and a stone knife against a predatory world, until
  the cold of the great glacier had captured and overpowered him.</p>

  <p>Stade said he had been hunting and that he had been caught in a blizzard.
  Numb with cold, he had at last dropped down on the chill ice, succumbing to
  that inevitable urge to sleep that overtakes all freezing men. For fifty
  thousand years he had slept on, undisturbed. (Lord, how I sometimes envied
  him!)</p>

  <p>I was pretty well played out by the time the final test arrived. My
  temperature was well past 102°, and I walked around in a semi-delirium most
  of the morning. But Stade insisted that he needed me, that I had to stay on
  my feet. He crammed me full of quinine and whiskey and I went on a singing
  jag. I remembered the words to some of the old songs that I thought I'd
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>That's why there are parts of that day that I remember distinctly and
  other parts that are only a hazy blank.</p>

  <p>Stade built a roaring blaze in the fireplace and our laboratory-hut was
  oven warm. The propeller of the plane, idling, kept the air of the room in
  circulation, blowing wind through an opening in the wall that had been built
  for that purpose. I helped to prop our subject in front of the fire, then
  slumped back, all groggy, and left the rest to Stade. It was his picnic.</p>

  <p>He kept turning Jimber Jaw over&mdash;first one side then the other toward
  the fire&mdash;until the ice was all melted. Then the body commenced to
  warm.</p>

  <p>I stopped my singing long enough to get sensible. I shook the fog out of
  my brain and stared at Stade. I knew perfectly well that the best we could
  expect was that in due course our prehistoric statue would turn blue and
  commence to smell, but for some reason I couldn't fight off my mounting
  excitement. Stade's tension had got into my blood. The big doctor was trying
  to be the cool and collected man-of-science and failing miserably in the
  attempt. His eyes blazed and his big body was taut with tension. His fingers
  trembled as he lit a cigarette, and the half-smile on his lips was a nervous
  grimace, frozen there.</p>

  <p>I chuckled. "What if he does come to life, doc?" I asked. "You thought of
  that? You thought what it's going to mean to old Jimber to be fifty thousand
  years away from all his friends? You thought of what he may do to us?"</p>

  <p>It was amusing to imagine that and I laughed at the notion. "What sort of
  people were the men of the old Stone Age?" I went on. "We named this baby
  after a grizzly bear and he certainly looks the part. He looks like a guy who
  would have definite ideas about strangers who waken people to whom they
  haven't been introduced&mdash;people who've been peacefully sleeping for
  fifty thousand years. Suppose he acts up, doc?"</p>

  <p>Stade shrugged. Devil-fire danced in his eyes. "Do you really think he'll
  come to life, Pat?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"You ought to know&mdash;you're the doctor."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Well, theoretically he should. It's not impossible.... Come
  on, sit over here, Pat."</p>

  <p>Stade bent over me, half-smiling, and his eyes burned down into mine. He
  didn't say anything and neither did I. Then he practically carried me across
  the room and propped me in a chair.</p>

  <p>The rest of it is rather hazy. I saw it all clearly enough&mdash;I
  remember the whole scene now as vividly as on that day&mdash;but it was all
  like a vision through a pale gray veil. Like something seen through a spirit
  disembodied. Perhaps it was my fever and the whiskey; I still don't know.</p>

  <p>First Stade gave Big Jim a blood transfusion, using me as the donor. After
  that he injected an adrenalin chloride solution into the belly. The doctor
  crouched over the slumped body and turned a tense face to stare at me. His
  eyes were lambent fire. Suddenly he jerked back to his patient and I heard
  his startled gasp.</p>

  <p>Jimber Jaw opened his mouth and yawned!</p>

  <p>I felt as if all the giants in the world had slapped me across the face.
  My breath caught and I couldn't see for a moment. Stade peered at me as if
  for confirmation, and I nodded. I have never in my life felt such a weight of
  responsibility. Why in the devil's name hadn't the man stayed frozen&mdash;
  why hadn't he started to decay? Now that he had shown signs of life we
  <i>had</i> to go on. It would have been murder not to finish what we started.
  I remember thinking dizzily: It wouldn't be right to murder a man who was
  born fifty thousand years ago....</p>

  <p>Stade injected an ounce and a half of anterior pituitary fluid. Big Jim
  scowled and wiggled his fingers. He was definitely alive, and it frightened
  me. I almost whimpered. It was like messing around with business that belongs
  only to God.</p>

  <p>Stade filled his hypodermic with posterior pituitary fluid and gave our
  discovery a shot of that. For a second nothing happened. Then the man of the
  old Stone Age turned over and tried to sit up. Stade let a yell out of him
  and I began to grow fainter and fainter.</p>

  <p>As in a dream I saw Stade push him back gently and speak soothingly. I
  couldn't hear what he said. Then the doctor injected sex hormones from sheep
  and squared his shoulders triumphantly. He came toward me, eyes glowing, and
  about that time I passed completely out of the picture...</p>

  <p>It was dark when I came to again. I had a splitting headache, my arm was
  sore as a boil, but otherwise I was okay again. Those fever attacks of mine
  have a way of vanishing swiftly. Stade was sitting at the table,
  shirt-sleeved, with a bottle at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been passed out?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>"Three-four hours."</p>

  <p>"What day is this?"</p>

  <p>He frowned at me. "What's the matter, Pat? Have you gone completely
  haywire?"</p>

  <p>I sat up&mdash;and then I saw the figure on the bench. It hadn't been a
  bad dream after all. Apparently Stade had stripped the soggy skins from
  Jimber Jaw, and he was wrapped in our blankets from the ship, peacefully
  sleeping. I went across to him and touched the bare shoulder lightly&mdash;
  real flesh. I could see his chest rise and fall, could hear his breathing.
  Slowly I went back to my home-made chair and sank down in it. I put my face
  in my hands and tried to think. At last I looked up and met Stade's level
  stare. He shrugged and I nodded.</p>

  <p>We had worked a miracle&mdash;and now we were stuck with it.</p>

  <p>Big Jim was a fine specimen of a man, about six-feet-three and beautifully
  muscled. Beneath his beard he appeared to have good and regular features,
  though perhaps the jaw was a little heavy. Stade thought he might be in his
  twenties. He certainly was not old.</p>

  <p>Some two hours later our guest from the past sat up and looked at us. A
  scowl darkened his forehead, and he looked about him quickly as though for
  his weapons. But they weren't there&mdash;Stade had seen to that. He tried to
  get up, but he was too weak.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, pal," I told him and he finally sprawled back. For a while
  he watched us from eyes that were wide and calm and animal-alert. Then he
  went to sleep again.</p>

  <p>He was a pretty sick boy for a long time. We both thought he'd never pull
  through. All the time we nursed him like a baby and took care of him; and by
  the time he commenced to convalesce he seemed to have gained confidence in
  us. He no longer scowled or shrank away or looked for his weapons when we
  came around; he smiled at us now, and it was a mighty winning smile.</p>

  <p>At first he had been delirious; he talked a lot in a strange tongue that
  we couldn't make head nor tail of. A soft, liquid tongue with l's and vowels
  flowing through it; but low, like a deep river. There was one word that he
  repeated often in his delirium&mdash;<i>Lilami</i>. The way he said it
  sounded sometimes like a prayer and sometimes like a wail of anguish.</p>

  <p>I had repaired the carburetor. There was nothing serious the matter with
  it&mdash;just clogged and jammed up a little. We could have gone on as soon
  as our flood receded but there was Jimber Jaw&mdash;whose name we had
  shortened to "Jim." We couldn't leave him to die, and he was too sick to take
  along; so we stayed with him. We never even discussed the matter much&mdash;
  just took it for granted that the responsibility was ours, and stuck
  along.</p>

  <p>Stade was, of course, elated by the success of this first practical
  demonstration of the soundness of his theory. I don't believe you could have
  dragged him away from Jim with an ox team. Yet as the days went on the good
  doctor seemed to draw farther back into a shell of reserve. The training of
  our charge was mainly left to my hands.</p>

  <p>The fact that we couldn't talk with Jim irked me. There were so many
  questions I wanted to ask him. Just think of it! Here was a man of the old
  Stone Age who could have told us all about conditions in the Pleistocene,
  fifty thousand years ago, perhaps; and I couldn't exchange a single thought
  with him. But we set out to cure that.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was strong enough, we commenced to teach him English. At
  first it was aggravatingly slow work; but Jim proved an apt pupil, and as
  soon as he had a little foundation he progressed rapidly. He had a marvelous
  memory. He never forgot anything&mdash;once he had a thing, he had it.</p>

  <p>No use reviewing the long weeks of his convalescence and education. He
  recovered fully, and he learned to speak English&mdash;excellent English, for
  Stade was a highly cultured man and a scholar. It was just as well that Jim
  didn't learn his English from me&mdash;barracks and hangars are not the
  places to acquire academic English.</p>

  <p>If Jim was a curiosity to us, imagine what we must have been to him. The
  little one-room shack we had built and in which he had convalesced was an
  architectural marvel beyond the limits of his imagining. He told us that his
  people lived in caves; and he thought that this was a strange cave that we
  had found, until we explained that we had built it.</p>

  <p>Our clothing intrigued him; our weapons were a never ending source of
  wonderment. The first time I took him hunting with me and shot game, he was
  astounded. Perhaps he was frightened by the noise and the smoke and the
  sudden death of the quarry; but if he were, he never let on. Jim never showed
  fear; perhaps he never felt fear. Alone, armed only with a stone-shod spear
  and a stone knife, he had been hunting the great red bear when the glacier
  had claimed him. He told us about it.</p>

  <p>"The day before you found me," he said, "I was hunting the great red bear.
  The wind blew; the snow and sleet drove against me. I could not see. I did
  not know in which direction I was going. I became very tired. I knew that if
  I lay down I should sleep and never awaken; but at last I could stand it no
  longer, and I lay down. If you had not come the next day, I should have
  died." How could we make him understand that his yesterday was fifty thousand
  years ago?</p>

  <p>Eventually we succeeded in a way, though I doubt if he ever fully
  appreciated the tremendous lapse of time that had intervened since he started
  from his father's cave to hunt the great red bear.</p>

  <p>When he first realized that he was a long way from that day and that it
  and his times could never be recalled, he again voiced that single
  word&mdash;<i>Lilami</i>. It was almost a sob. I had never dreamed that so
  much heartache, so much longing could be encompassed within a single
  word.</p>

  <p>I asked him what it meant.</p>

  <p>He was a long time in answering. He seemed to be trying to control his
  emotions, which was unusual for Big Jim. Ordinarily he appeared never to have
  emotions. One day he told me why. A great warrior never let his face betray
  anger or pain or sorrow. You will notice that he didn't mention fear.
  Sometimes I think he had never learned what fear is. Before a youth was
  admitted to the warrior class, he was tortured to make certain that he could
  control his emotions.</p>

  <p>But to get back to <i>Lilami</i>:</p>

  <p>At last he spoke: "Lilami is a girl&mdash;was a girl. She was to have been
  my mate when I came back with the head of the great red bear. Where is she
  now, Pat Morgan?"</p>

  <p>There was a question! If we hadn't discovered Jim and thawed him out,
  Lilami wouldn't have been even a memory. "Try not to think about her, old
  man," I said. "You'll never see Lilami again&mdash;not in this world."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," he replied. "If I am not dead, Lilami is not dead. I shall
  find her."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE plane was so absolutely beyond Jimber Jaw's conception
  that he couldn't even ask questions about it. I think anyone else in the
  world, under similar circumstances, would have been terrified when we finally
  took off from that lonely Siberian forest. The whir of the propeller, the
  roar of the exhaust, the wild careening of the take-off must have had
  <i>some</i> effect on Jim, but he never showed it by so much as a bat of an
  eyelid. He had all the appearance of a blasé young man of today.</p>

  <p>I had given him an old suit&mdash;breeches, field boots, and a leather
  coat. He was smooth shaven now. After watching us scrape our jowls every day,
  he had insisted first on being shaved and then learning to shave himself. The
  transformation had been most astounding&mdash;from Man Mountain Dean to
  Adonis with a few snips of the scissors and a few passes of the
  safety-razor!</p>

  <p>When I looked at him and thought of the civilization that he was about to
  crash for the first time, I felt sorry for Lilami. Pretty soon she would be
  scarcely even a memory. But I didn't know Big Jim&mdash;then.</p>

  <p>Well, we finally got to Moscow; and there was the devil to pay about our
  unexpected passenger. No one believed our story. I can scarcely blame them.
  But what got me sore was their insistence that we were all spies and
  counter-revolutionists and Nazis and Fascists and capitalists and
  what-have-you that is anathema in Red Russia.</p>

  <p>Of course, Jim had no passport. We tried to explain that they weren't
  issuing passports in the Pleistocene, but we got nowhere. They wanted to
  shoot us; but the American ambassador came to our rescue, and they
  compromised by shooing us out of the country and telling us to stay out. That
  suited me. If I never see a Comrade again, that will be far too soon for Pat
  Morgan.</p>

  <p>After our experience in Russia, Stade and I decided to keep our mouths
  shut about Jim's genesis and antecedents. This was Stade's suggestion, and I
  confess I was rather surprised to hear him make it. The good doctor had never
  been adverse to publicity, and here was the greatest chance in the world for
  him to beat his own drum. Think of the scientific <i>kudos</i> that would
  shower down on him!</p>

  <p>But Stade wasn't interested in that, he said. He suddenly went coy on me
  &mdash;began to talk of the difficulties of establishing absolute scientific
  proof and all that rot. Suggested we'd better wait a while&mdash;allow our
  colossus to orient himself. He'd leave Jim in my care for a time, since
  important business was waiting for him in Chicago.</p>

  <p>I shrugged and agreed.</p>

  <p>We arrived in America shrouded in a pall of silence. As a matter of fact,
  we smuggled Jim into the old U.S.A., and after that we had to keep our mouths
  shut about him. What else could we have done? After all, there is no
  Pleistocene quota.</p>

  <p>When we got home, I took him to my place in Beverly Hills; and told people
  he was an old friend&mdash;Jim Stone from Schenectady.</p>

  <p>He had been greatly impressed by the large cities he had seen. He thought
  skyscrapers were mountains with caves in them. As intelligent as he was, he
  just couldn't conceive that man had built anything so colossal.</p>

  <p>It was a treat taking him around. The movies were as real to him as death
  and taxes. There was a caveman sequence in one we saw, and Jim really showed
  signs of life then. I knew he was having difficulty in restraining himself.
  He was just honing to crawl into one of those prop caves. When the heavy
  grabbed the leading lady by the hair and started to drag her across the
  scenery, Big Jim hoisted himself into the aisle and started for the screen. I
  grabbed him by the coat-tails, but it was a lap dissolve that saved the
  day.</p>

  <p>Yep, Jim and I had fun....</p>

  <p>One night I took him to the wrestling matches at the Olympic. We had
  ring-side seats. The Lone Wolf and Tiny Sawbuck (237 pounds) were committing
  mayhem on one another inside the ropes. It seemed to get Jim's goat.</p>

  <p>"Do you call those great warriors?" he inquired. Then, before I could do
  anything about it, he vaulted over the ropes and threw them both into the
  third row.</p>

  <p>The Lone Wolf and Tiny Sawbuck were sore, but the audience and the
  promoter were one hundred percent plus for Jimber Jaw. Before the evening was
  over, the latter had signed Jim up to meet the winner, and a week later our
  survivor of the Stone Age stepped into the ring with Tiny Sawbuck.</p>

  <p>I'm still laughing. Tiny is famed as a bad hombre. He knows all the dirty
  tricks that the other wrestlers know and has invented quite a few of his own.
  But he didn't have an opportunity to try any of them on Jim. The moment they
  met in the center of the ring, the man who lived in the day of the mammoths,
  picked him up, carried him to the ropes, and threw him into the fourth row.
  He did that three times, and the last time Tiny stayed there. You couldn't
  have hired him to come back into that ring.</p>

  <p>About the same thing happened in boxing. I had been giving Jim some
  preliminary instruction in the manly art of acquiring cauliflower ears. By
  this time he was well known as a wrestler. Every Wednesday he had gone to the
  Olympic and ruined a few cash customers by throwing opponents at them. That
  was all he ever did. He never wrestled, never made any faces, never gave the
  other fellow a chance. He just picked him up and threw him out of the ring,
  and kept on doing it until the other man decided to stay out.</p>

  <p>The fight promoter approached me. "Can he box?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He can't wrestle, but he always wins. Why don't you find
  out? I have one thousand bucks that says he can put any of your white hopes
  to sleep."</p>

  <p>"You're on," opined the promoter.</p>

  <p>The following Tuesday the fight came off. I cautioned Jim: "Don't forget,"
  I admonished him, "that you're supposed to box, not wrestle."</p>

  <p>"I hit?" Jim inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you hit&mdash;and sock him hard."</p>

  <p>"Okey-doke," rejoined the man from the old Stone Age. "Bring 'em on!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands and retired to their corners; then the bell rang. The
  white hope came charging out like the Light Brigade at Balaklava, and he got
  just about as far. Big Jim swung one terrific right that he must have learned
  from the cave-bear and the white hope was draped over the upper rope. That
  was the end of that fight. Others went similar ways: then the cinema moguls
  noticed Jimber Jaw.</p>

  <p>One night, while we were still negotiating for a movie contract, we went
  to see a preview. Lorna Downs was the star. The moment she came onto the
  screen, Jim sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Lilami!" he cried. "It is I, Kolani."</p>

  <p>The heavy was insulting Lorna at the time. Jim leaped toward the screen
  just as Lorna made her exit into the garden. Without a moment's hesitation he
  tried to follow her.</p>

  <p>It wasn't so much the damage he did to the screen as the hurt to the
  theater manager's pride. He made the mistake of trying to eject Jim by force.
  That <i>was</i> a mistake. After they had gathered the manager up from the
  sidewalk and carried him to his office, I managed to settle with him and keep
  Jim out of jail.</p>

  <p>When we got home, I asked Jim what it was all about.</p>

  <p>"It was Lilami," he explained.</p>

  <p>"It was not Lilami&mdash;it was Lorna Downs. And, what you saw was not
  Lorna herself&mdash;just a moving picture of her."</p>

  <p>"It was Lilami," the big fellow said gravely. "I told you that I would
  find her."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LORNA DOWNS was in the east making a personal appearance
  tour in connection with her latest release. Jim wanted to go after her. I
  explained that he had entered into a contract to make pictures and that he
  would have to live up to his agreement. I also told him that Lorna would be
  back in Hollywood in a few weeks, so he reluctantly agreed to wait. Meanwhile
  we moved into movie circles, and thus came a new phase in Jim's career. He
  suddenly became a social lion. Men liked him and women were crazy about
  him.</p>

  <p>The first time he went to the Trocadero he turned to me and asked, "What
  kind of women are these?"</p>

  <p>I told him that, measured by fame and wealth, they were the cream of the
  elect.</p>

  <p>"They are without shame," he said. "They go almost naked before men. In my
  country their men would drag them home by the hair and beat them."</p>

  <p>I had to admit that that was what some of our men would like to do.</p>

  <p>"Of what good is a mate in your country?" he asked. "They are no different
  from men. The men smoke; the women smoke. The men drink; the women drink. The
  men swear; the women swear. They gamble&mdash;they tell dirty stories
  &mdash;they are out all night and cannot be fit to look after the caves and
  the children the next day. They are only good for one thing, otherwise they
  might as well be men. One does not need to take a mate for what they can give
  &mdash;not here. In my country such women are killed. No one would want
  children from them."</p>

  <p>The ethics, the standards, and the philosophy of the Stone Age did not fit
  Jim to enjoy modern society. He stopped going out evenings except to pictures
  and fights. He was waiting for Lilami to return.</p>

  <p>"She is different," he said.</p>

  <p>I felt sorry for him. I didn't know Lorna Downs, but I would have been
  willing to bet she was not so different.</p>

  <p>At last Lorna came back. I was with Jim when they met. It was on a set at
  the studio. It was in the middle of a scene, but when he saw her he walked
  right off the set and up to her. Never before have I seen so much happiness
  and love reflected in a man's face.</p>

  <p>"Lilami!" he said in a voice tense with emotion, and reached for her.</p>

  <p>She shrank back. "What's the idea, big boy?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me, Lilami? I'm Kolani. Now I have found you we can go
  away together. I have searched for you for a long time."</p>

  <p>She looked up at me. "Are you his keeper, mister?" she demanded. "If you
  are, you'd better take him back to the college and lock him up."</p>

  <p>I sent Jim away, and then I talked to her. I didn't tell her everything,
  but enough so that she understood that Jim wasn't crazy, that he was a good
  kid, and that he really believed that she was the girl he had known in
  another country.</p>

  <p>He was standing a little way off, and she sat and looked at him for a few
  moments before she answered; then she said she'd be nice to him.</p>

  <p>"It ought to be good fun," she said.</p>

  <p>After that they were together a great deal. It looked very much as though
  the movie belle were falling for the cave man. They went to shows together
  and dined in quiet places and took long drives.</p>

  <p>Then, one afternoon she went to a cocktail party without him. She didn't
  tell him she was going; but he found it out, and along about seven o'clock he
  walked into the place.</p>

  <p>Lorna was sitting on some bird's lap, and he had his arms around her and
  was kissing her. It didn't mean a thing&mdash;not to them. A girl might kiss
  any one at a cocktail party&mdash;that is any one except her husband. But it
  meant a lot to Jimber Jaw of 50,000 B.C.</p>

  <p>He was across that room in two strides. He never said a word; he just
  grabbed Lorna by the hair and yanked her out of the man's lap; then he picked
  the fellow up and threw him all the way across the room. He was the original
  cave man then, and no mistake.</p>

  <p>Lorna struck down his hands and slapped his face. "Get out of here, you
  big boob," she screamed. "You tank-town Romeo&mdash;get out and stay out.
  You're washed up. I'm through with you."</p>

  <p>Jim's fingers balled into a fist but he didn't hit her. The repressed fury
  drained out of his face and his shoulders sagged. He turned without a word,
  stalked away. That was the last time any one ever saw him&mdash;until this
  morning.</p>

  <p>Pat Morgan raised his hand, signal to the waiter for another pair of
  highballs. He stared across the table at me without expression,
  shrugging.</p>

  <p>"That's the story of Jimber Jaw," he said. "Take it or leave it.... I
  could see by your face when I was telling it that you were thinking what I
  used to think: That Stade took advantage of my grogginess&mdash;maybe even
  hypnotized me&mdash;to make me believe that I saw something in that Siberian
  hut which never happened.</p>

  <p>"That's possible. He might have picked up some wandering dumb Kulak, put
  the evil eye on him, drugged him up&mdash;yes, it could have happened that
  way. But I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>He tapped the newspaper that told in screaming headlines of the discovery
  of the body of Jim Stone. The story told of Stone's quick rise to fame, of
  his disappearance, of the finding of him that morning, an apparent
  suicide.</p>

  <p>"But the whole story isn't there," Pat Morgan said. "The police called me
  in to identify the corpse, and it was Big Jim all right. They found him in
  the frozen-meat room of a cold storage warehouse&mdash;been there for weeks,
  apparently. He was resting on his side, face against his arm, and I've never
  seen a man, alive or dead, more peaceful.</p>

  <p>"Pinned to the lapel of his coat was a scrawled note addressed to me. The
  police couldn't make head nor tail of it, but as far as I was concerned it
  spoke volumes. It said:</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>"I go to find the real Lilami. And don't thaw me out
  again."</i></p>
