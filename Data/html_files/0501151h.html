    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia Pillson, the Mayor-Elect of Tilling and her husband
      Georgie were talking together one October afternoon in the
      garden-room at Mallards. The debate demanded the exercise
      of their keenest faculties. Viz:
    </p>
    <p>
      Should Lucia, when next month she entered on the supreme
      Municipal Office, continue to go down to the High Street
      every morning after breakfast with her market-basket, and
      make her personal purchases at the shops of the baker, the
      grocer, the butcher and wherever else the needs of the
      day's catering directed? There were pros and cons to be
      considered, and Lucia had been putting the case for both
      sides with the tedious lucidity of opposing counsel
      addressing the Court. It might be confidently expected
      that, when she had finished exploring the entire territory,
      she would be fully competent to express the verdict of the
      jury and the sentence of the judge. In anticipation of the
      numerous speeches she would soon be called upon to make as
      Mayor, she was cultivating, whenever she remembered to do
      so, a finished oratorical style, and a pedantic Oxford
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be very careful, Georgie," she said. "Thoroughly
      democratic as you know I am in the truest sense of the
      word, I shall be entrusted, on the ninth of November next,
      with the duty of upholding the dignity and tradition of my
      high office. I'm not sure that I ought to go popping in and
      out of shops, as I have hitherto done, carrying my
      market-basket and bustling about just like anybody else.
      Let me put a somewhat similar case to you. Supposing you
      saw a newly-appointed Lord Chancellor trotting round the
      streets of Westminster in shorts, for the sake of exercise.
      What would you feel about it? What would your reactions
      be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you're not thinking of putting on shorts, are you?"
      asked Georgie, hoping to introduce a lighter tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Lucia. "A parallel case only. And
      then there's this. It would be intolerable to my democratic
      principles that, if I went into the grocer's to make some
      small purchase, other customers already there should stand
      aside in order that I might be served first. That would
      never do. Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie surveyed with an absent air the pretty piece of
      needlework on which he was engaged. He was embroidering the
      Borough arms of Tilling in coloured silks on the back of
      the white kid gloves which Lucia would wear at the
      inaugural ceremony, and he was not quite sure that he had
      placed the device exactly in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How tar'some," he said. "Well, it will have to do. I
      daresay it will stretch right. About the Lord Chancellor in
      shorts. I don't think I should mind. It would depend a
      little on what sort of knees he had. As for other customers
      standing aside because you were the Mayor, I don't think
      you need be afraid of that for a moment. Most unlikely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia became violently interested in her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, they look too smart for anything," she said.
      "Beautiful work, Georgie. Lovely. They remind me of the
      jewelled gloves you see in primitive Italian pictures on
      the hands of kneeling Popes and adoring Bishops."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think the arms are quite in the middle?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks perfect. Shall I try it on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia displayed the back of her gloved hand, leaning her
      forehead elegantly against the finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that seems all right," said Georgie. "Give it me
      back. It's not quite finished. About the other thing. It
      would be rather marked if you suddenly stopped doing your
      marketing yourself, as you've done it every day for the
      last two years or so. Except Sundays. Some people might say
      that you were swanky because you were Mayor. Elizabeth
      would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly. But I should be puzzled, dear, to name off-hand
      anything that mattered less to me than what Elizabeth
      Mapp-Flint said, poor woman. Give me your opinion, not
      hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might drop the marketing by degrees, if you felt it
      was undignified," said Georgie yawning. "Shop every day
      this week, and only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday next
      week--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear," interrupted Lucia. "That would be hedging, and
      I never hedge. One thing or the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hedge may save you from falling into a ditch," said
      Georgie brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Georgino,</i> how epigrammatic! What does it mean
      exactly? What ditch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any ditch," said Georgie. "Just making a mistake and not
      being judicious. Tilling is a mass of pitfalls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind about pitfalls so long as my conscience
      assures me that I am guided by right principles. I must set
      an example in my private as well as my public life. If I
      decide to go on with my daily marketing I shall certainly
      make a point of buying very cheap, simple provisions.
      Cabbages and turnips, for instance, not asparagus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got plenty of that in the garden when it comes in,"
      said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--plaice, not soles. Apples," went on Lucia, as if he
      hadn't spoken. "Plain living in private--everybody will
      hear me buying cheap vegetables--Splendour, those lovely
      gloves, in public. And high thinking in both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would sound well in your inaugural speech," said
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it will. What I want to do in our dear Tilling is
      to elevate the tone, to make it a real centre of
      intellectual and artistic activity. That must go on
      simultaneously with social reforms and the well-being of
      the poorer classes. All the slums must be cleared away.
      There must be an end to overcrowding. Pasteurisation of
      milk, Georgie; a strict censorship of the films; benches in
      sunny corners. Of course, it will cost money. I should like
      to see the rates go up by leaps and bounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't make you very popular," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should welcome any unpopularity that such reforms might
      earn for me. The decorative side of life, too. Flower boxes
      in the windows of the humblest dwellings. Cheap concerts of
      first-rate music. The revival of ancient customs, like
      beating the bounds. I must find out just what that is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The town-council went in procession round the boundaries
      of the parish," said Georgie, "and the Mayor was bumped on
      the boundary stones. Hadn't we better stick to the question
      of whether you go marketing or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not like the idea of being bumped on boundary
      stones . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, dear. I lose myself in my dreams. We were
      talking about the example we must set in plain living. I
      wish it to be known that I do my catering with economy. To
      be heard ordering neck of mutton at the butcher's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't eat neck of mutton in order to be an example to
      anybody," said Georgie. "And, personally, whatever you
      settle to do, I won't give up the morning shopping.
      Besides, one learns all the news then. Why, it would be
      worse than not having the wireless! I should be lost
      without it. So would you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia tried to picture herself bereft of that eager daily
      interchange of gossip, when her Tilling circle of friends
      bustled up and down the High Street carrying their
      market-baskets and bumping into each other in the narrow
      doorways of shops. Rain or fine, with umbrellas and
      goloshes or with sunshades and the thinnest blouses, it was
      the bracing hour that whetted the appetite for the
      complications of life. The idea of missing it was
      unthinkable, and without the slightest difficulty she
      ascribed exalted motives and a high sense of duty to its
      continuance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, dear," she said. "Thank you for your
      guidance! More than ever now in my new position, it will be
      incumbent on me to know what Tilling is thinking and
      feeling. My finger must be on its pulse. That book I was
      reading the other day, which impressed me so
      enormously--what on earth was it? A biography."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catherine the Great?" asked Georgie. Lucia had dipped into
      it lately, but the suggestion was intended to be humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: I shall forget my own name next. She always had her
      finger on the pulse of her people: that I maintain was the
      real source of her greatness. She used to disguise herself,
      you remember, as a peasant woman--moujik, isn't it?--and
      let herself out of the back-door of the Winter Palace, and
      sat in the bars and cafés or wherever they drink vodka and
      tea--samovars--and hear what the common people were saying,
      astonishing her Ministers with her knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt fearfully bored with her and this preposterous
      rubbish. Lucia did not care two straws what "the common
      people" were saying. She, in this hour of shopping in the
      High Street, wanted to know what fresh mischief Elizabeth
      Mapp-Flint was hatching, and what Major Benjy Mapp-Flint
      was at, and whether Diva Plaistow's Irish terrier had got
      mange, and if Irene Coles had obtained the sanction of the
      Town Surveying Department to paint a fresco on the front of
      her house of a nude Venus rising from the sea, and if Susan
      Wyse had really sat down on her budgerigar, squashing it
      quite flat. Instead of which she gassed about the duty of
      the Mayor Elect of Tilling to have her finger on the pulse
      of the place, like Catherine the Great. Such nonsense was
      best met with a touch of sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be a new experience, dear," he said. "Fancy your
      disguising yourself as a gypsy-woman and stealing out
      through the back-door, and sitting in the bars of
      public-houses. I do call that thorough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you take me too literally, Georgie," she said. "Only a
      loose analogy. In some respects I should be sorry to behave
      like that marvellous woman. But what a splendid notion to
      listen to all that the moujiks said when their tongues were
      unloosed with vodka. <i>In vino veritas."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always," said Georgie. "For instance, Major Benjy was
      sitting boozing in the club this afternoon. The wind was
      too high for him to go out and play golf, so he spent his
      time in port . . . Putting out in a gale, you see, or
      stopping in port. Quite a lot of port."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie waited for his wife to applaud this pretty play
      upon words, but she was thinking about herself and
      Catherine the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, wine wasn't making him truthful, but just the
      opposite," he went on. "Telling the most awful whoppers
      about the tigers he'd shot and his huge success with women
      when he was younger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Elizabeth," said Lucia in an unsympathetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He grew quite dreadful," said Georgie, "talking about his
      bachelor days of freedom. And he had the insolence to dig
      me in the ribs and whisper 'We know all about that, old
      boy, don't we? Ha ha. What?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how impertinent," cried Lucia. "Why, it's
      comparing Elizabeth with me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me with him," suggested Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Altogether most unpleasant. Any more news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I saw Diva for a moment. Paddy's not got mange. Only
      a little eczema. And she's quite determined to start her
      tea-shop. She asked me if I thought you would perform the
      opening ceremony and drink the first cup of tea. I said I
      thought you certainly would. Such <i>éclat</i> for her if
      you went in your robes! I don't suppose there would be a
      muffin left in the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's brow clouded, but it made her happy to be on
      Mayoral subjects again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I wish you hadn't encouraged her to hope that I
      would," she said. "I should be delighted to give Diva such
      a magnificent send-off as that, but I must be very careful.
      Supposing next day somebody opens a new boot-shop I shall
      have made a precedent and shall have to wear the first pair
      of shoes. Or a hat-shop. If I open one, I must open all,
      for I will not show any sort of favouritism. I will gladly,
      ever so gladly, go and drink the first cup of tea at
      Diva's, as Mrs. Pillson, but not officially. I must be
      officially incognita."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll be disappointed," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Diva, I fear so. As for robes, quite impossible. The
      Mayor never appears in robes except when attended by the
      whole Corporation. I can hardly request my Aldermen and
      Councillors to have tea with Diva in state. Of course it's
      most enterprising of her, but I can't believe her little
      tea-room will resemble the goldmine she anticipates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think she's doing it just to make money," said
      Georgie, "though, of course she wouldn't mind that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then? Think of the expense of cups and saucers and
      tables and tea-spoons. The trouble, too. She told me she
      meant to serve the teas herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just that she'll enjoy so much," said Georgie,
      "popping in and out and talking to her customers. She's got
      a raving passion for talking to anybody, and she finds it
      such silent work living alone. She'll have constant
      conversation if her tea-room catches on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you may be right," said Lucia. "Oh, and there's
      another thing. My Mayoral banquet. I lay awake half last
      night--perhaps not quite so much--thinking about it, and I
      don't see how you can come to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's sickening," said Georgie. "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very difficult. If I ask you, it will certainly set a
      precedent--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think too much about precedents," interrupted Georgie.
      "Nobody will care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But listen. The banquet is entirely official. I shall ask
      the Mayors of neighbouring boroughs, the Bishop, the Lord
      Lieutenant, the Vicar, who is my Chaplain, my Aldermen and
      Councillors, and Justices of the Peace. You, dear, have no
      official position. We are, so to speak, like Queen Victoria
      and the Prince Consort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said that before," said Georgie, "and I looked it up.
      When she opened Parliament he drove with her to Westminster
      and sat beside her on a throne. A throne--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if that is so. Some of those lives of the Queen
      are very inaccurate. At that rate, the wife of the Lord
      Chancellor ought to sit on a corner of the Woolsack.
      Besides, where are you to be placed? You can't sit next me.
      The Lord Lieutenant must be on my right and the Bishop on
      my left--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they come," observed Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally they won't sit there if they don't. After them
      come the Mayors, Aldermen and Councillors. You would have
      to sit below them all, and that would be intolerable to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't mind where I sat," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should love you to be there, Georgie," she said. "But in
      what capacity? It's all official, I repeat. Think of
      tradition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there isn't any tradition. No woman has ever been
      Mayor of Tilling before: you've often told me that.
      However, don't let us argue about it. I expect Tilling will
      think it very odd if I'm not there. I shall go up to London
      that day, and then you can tell them I've been called
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would never do," cried Lucia. "Tilling would think it
      much odder if you weren't here on my great day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having dinner alone at Mallards," said Georgie bitterly.
      "The neck of mutton you spoke of."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time for my bath," he said. "And I shan't talk about it or
      think about it any more. I leave it to you."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie went upstairs, feeling much vexed. He undressed and
      put on his blue silk dressing-gown, and peppered his bath
      with a liberal allowance of verbena salts. He submerged
      himself in the fragrant liquid, and concentrated his mind
      on the subject he had resolved not to think about any more.
      Just now Lucia seemed able to apply her mind to nothing
      except herself and the duties or dignities of her coming
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Egalo-megalo-mayoralo-mania', I call it," Georgie said to
      himself in a withering whisper. "Catherine the Great!
      Delirium! She thinks the whole town is as wildly excited
      about her being Mayor as she is herself. Whereas it's a
      matter of supreme indifference to them . . . All except
      Elizabeth, who trembles with rage and jealousy whenever she
      sees Lucia . . . But she always did that . . . Bother! I've
      dropped my soap and it slips away like an eel . . . All
      very tar'some. Lucia can't talk about anything else . . .
      Breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, there's nothing but that
      . . . Mayoral complex . . . It's a crashing bore, that's
      what it is . . . Everlastingly reminding me that I've no
      official position . . . Hullo, who's that? No, you can't
      come in, whoever you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      A volley of raps had sounded at the door of the bathroom.
      Then Lucia's voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't want to come in," she said. "But,
      <i>eureka,</i> Georgie. <i>Ho trovato: ho ben trovato!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you found?" called Georgie, sitting up in his
      bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It. Me. My banquet. You and my banquet. I'll tell you at
      dinner. Be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably she'll let me hand the cheese," thought Georgie,
      still feeling morose. "I'm in no hurry to hear that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He padded back to his bedroom in his dressing-gown and
      green morocco slippers. A parcel had arrived for him while
      he was at his bath, and Foljambe, the parlour-maid valet
      had put it on his pink bed-quilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be my new dinner suit," he said to himself. "And
      with all this worry I'd quite forgotten about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut the string and there it was: jacket and waistcoat
      and trousers of ruby-coloured velvet, with synthetic-onyx
      buttons, quite superb. It was Lucia's birthday present to
      him; he was to order just what dinner-suit he liked, and
      the bill was to be sent to her. She knew nothing more,
      except that he had told her that it would be something
      quite out of the common and that Tilling would be
      astonished. He was thrilled with its audacious beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now let me think," he meditated. "One of my pleated
      shirts, and a black butterfly tie, and my garnet solitaire.
      And my pink vest. Nobody will see it, but I shall know it's
      there. And red socks. Or daren't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He swiftly invested himself in this striking creation. It
      fitted beautifully in front, and he rang the bell for
      Foljambe to see if it was equally satisfactory behind. Her
      masterful knock sounded on the door, and he said come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe gave a shrill ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lor!" she said. "Something fancy-dress, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Georgie. "My new evening suit. Isn't it
      smart, Foljambe? Does it fit all right at the back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to," said Foljambe, pulling his sleeve. "Stand a bit
      straighter, sir. Yes, quite a good fit. Nearly gave me
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you like it?" asked Georgie anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a bit of a shock, sir. I hope you won't spill things
      on it, for it would be a rare job to get anything sticky
      out of the velvet, and you do throw your food about
      sometimes. But it is pretty now I begin to take it in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie went into his sitting-room next door, where there
      was a big mirror over the fireplace, and turned on all the
      electric lights. He got up on a chair, so that he could get
      a more comprehensive view of himself, and revolved slowly
      in the brilliant light. He was so absorbed in his
      Narcissism that he did not hear Lucia come out of her
      bedroom. The door was ajar, and she peeped in. She gave a
      strangled scream at the sight of a large man in a glaring
      red suit standing on a chair with his back to her. It was
      unusual. Georgie whisked round at her cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!" he said. "Your delicious present. There it was when
      I came from my bath. Isn't it lovely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia recovered from her shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively Venetian, Georgie," she said. "Real Titian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's adorable," said Georgie, getting down. "Won't
      Tilling be excited? Thank you a thousand times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a thousand congratulations, Georgino," she said. "Oh,
      and my discovery! I am a genius, dear. There'll be a high
      table across the room at my banquet with two tables joining
      it at the corners going down the room. Me, of course, in
      the centre of the high table. We shall sit only on one side
      of these tables. And you can sit all by yourself exactly
      opposite me. Facing me. No official position, neither above
      or below the others. Just the Mayor's husband close to her
      materially, but officially in the air, so to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      From below came the merry sound of little bells that
      announced dinner. Grosvenor, the other parlour-maid, was
      playing quite a sweet tune on them to-night, which showed
      she was pleased with life. When she was cross she made a
      snappy jangled discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That solves everything!" said Georgie. "Brilliant. How
      clever of you! I <i>did</i> feel a little hurt at the
      thought of not being there. Listen: Grosvenor's happy, too.
      We're all pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered her his beautiful velvet arm, and they went
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my garnet solitaire," he said. "Doesn't it go well
      with my clothes? I must tuck my napkin in securely. It
      would be frightful if I spilt anything. I am glad about the
      banquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I, dear. It would have been horrid not to have had
      you there. But I had to reconcile the feelings of private
      life with the etiquette of public life. We must expect
      problems of the sort to arise while I'm Mayor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such good fish," said Georgie, trying to divert her from
      the eternal subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent, isn't it," said Lucia. "In the time of Queen
      Elizabeth, Georgie, the Mayor of Tilling was charged with
      supplying fish for the Court. A train of pack-mules was
      despatched to London twice a week. What a wonderful thing
      if I could get that custom restored! Such an impetus to the
      fishermen here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Court must have been rather partial to putrid fish,"
      said Georgie. "I shouldn't care to eat a whiting that had
      been carried on a mule to London in hot weather, or in
      cold, for that matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I should not mean to go back to the mules," said
      Lucia, "though how picturesque to see them loaded at the
      river-bank, and starting on their Royal errand. One would
      use the railway. I wonder if it could be managed. The Royal
      Fish Express."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you propose a special train full of soles and lobsters
      twice a week for Buckingham Palace or Royal Lodge?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A refrigerating van would be sufficient. I daresay if I
      searched in the archives I should find that Tilling had the
      monopoly of supplying the Royal table, and that the right
      has never been revoked. If so, I should think a petition to
      the King: 'Your Majesty's loyal subjects of Tilling humbly
      pray that this privilege be restored to them'. Or perhaps
      some preliminary enquiries from the Directors of the
      Southern Railway first. Such prestige. And a steady demand
      would be a wonderful thing for the fishing industry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's got enough demand already," said Georgie. "There
      isn't too much fish for us here as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie! Where's your political economy? Demand invariably
      leads to supply. There would be more fishing-smacks built,
      more men would follow the sea. Unemployment would diminish.
      Think of Yarmouth and its immense trade. How I should like
      to capture some of it for our Tilling! I mustn't lose sight
      of that among all the schemes I ponder over so constantly.
      . . . But I've had a busy day: let us relax a little and
      make music in the garden-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and her voice assumed a careless lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw to-day," she said, "in one of my old bound-up
      volumes of duets, an arrangement for four hands of
      Glazonov's 'Bacchanal'. It looked rather attractive. We
      might run through it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had seen it, too, a week ago, and though most of
      Lucia's music was familiar, he felt sure they had never
      tried this. He had had a bad cold in the head, and, not
      being up to their usual walk for a day or two, he had
      played over the bass part several times while Lucia was out
      taking her exercise: some day it might come in useful. Then
      this very afternoon, busy in the garden, he had heard a
      long-continued soft-pedalled tinkle, and rightly
      conjectured that Lucia was stealing a march on him in the
      treble part . . . Out they went to the garden-room, and
      Lucia found the 'Bacchanal'. His new suit made him feel
      very kindly disposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take the treble, then," he said. "I could never
      read that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lazy of you, dear," she said, instantly sitting down.
      "Well, I'll try if you insist, but you mustn't scold me if
      I make a mess of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It went beautifully. Odd trains of thought coursed through
      the heads of both. "Why is she such a hypocrite?" he
      wondered. "She was practising it half the afternoon." . . .
      Simultaneously Lucia was saying to herself, "Georgie can't
      be reading it. He must have tried it before." At the end
      were mutual congratulations: each thought that the other
      had read it wonderfully well. Then bed-time. She kissed her
      hand to him as she closed her bedroom door, and Georgie
      made a few revolutions in front of his mirror before
      divesting himself of the new suit. By a touching
      transference of emotions, Lucia had vivid dreams of heaving
      seas of ruby-coloured velvet, and Georgie of the new Cunard
      liner, <i>Queen Mary,</i> running aground in the river on a
      monstrous shoal of whiting and lobsters.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was an early autumnal frost in the night, though not
      severe enough to blacken the superb dahlias in Lucia's
      garden and soon melting. The lawn was covered with pearly
      moisture when she and Georgie met at breakfast, and the red
      roofs of Tilling gleamed bright in the morning sun. Lucia
      had already engaged a shorthand and typewriting secretary
      to get used to her duties before the heavy mayoral
      correspondence began to pour in, but to-day the post
      brought nothing but a few circulars at once committed to
      the waste-paper basket. But it would not do to leave Mrs.
      Simpson completely idle, so, before setting out for the
      morning marketing, Lucia dictated invitations to Mrs.
      Bartlett and the Padre, to Susan and Mr. Wyse, to Elizabeth
      Mapp-Flint and Major Benjy for dinner and Bridge the
      following night. She would write in the invocations and
      signatures when she returned, and she apologized in each
      letter for the stress of work which had prevented her from
      writing with her own hand throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I shall have to learn typing myself," she said as
      they started. "I can easily imagine some municipal crisis
      which would swamp Mrs. Simpson, quick worker though she is.
      Or isn't there a machine called the dictaphone? . . . How
      deliciously warm the sun is! When we get back I shall make
      a water-colour sketch of my dahlias in the <i>giardino
      segreto.</i> Any night might see them blackened, and I
      should deplore not having a record of them. <i>Ecco,</i>
      there's Irene beckoning to us from her window. Something
      about the fresco, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene Coles bounced out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, beloved one," she cried. "It's too cruel! That
      lousy Town Surveying Department refuses to sanction my
      fresco-design of Venus rising from the sea. Come into my
      studio and look at my sketch of it, which they have sent
      back to me. Goths and Vandals and Mrs. Grundys to a man and
      woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch was very striking. A nude, well-nourished,
      putty-coloured female, mottled with green shadows, was
      balanced on an oyster shell, while a prizefighter,
      representing the wind and sprawling across the sky,
      propelled her with puffed cheeks up a river towards a
      red-roofed town on the shore which presented Tilling with
      pre-Raphaelite fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me! Quite Botticellian!" said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" screamed Irene. "Darling, how can you compare my
      great deep-bosomed Venus, fit to be the mother of heroes,
      with Botticelli's anæmic flapper? What'll the next
      generation in Tilling be like when my Venus gets ashore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Quite. So vigorous! So allegorical!" said Lucia.
      "But, dear Irene, do you want everybody to be reminded of
      that whenever they go up and down the street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? What can be nobler than Motherhood?" asked Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! Nothing!" Lucia assured her. "For a maternity
      home--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene picked up her sketch and tore it across.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what I shall do," she said. "I shall turn my
      wondrous Hellenic goddess into a Victorian mother. I shall
      dress her in a tartan shawl and skirt and a bonnet with a
      bow underneath her chin and button-boots and a parasol. I
      shall give my lusty South Wind a frock-coat and trousers
      and a top-hat, and send the design back to that foul-minded
      Department asking if I have now removed all objectionable
      features. Georgie, when next you come to see me, you won't
      need to blush."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't blushed once!" said Georgie indignantly. "How
      can you tell such fibs?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Irene is so full of vitality," said Lucia as they
      regained the street. "Such ozone! She always makes me feel
      as if I was out in a high wind, and I wonder if my hair is
      coming down. But so easily managed with a little tact--Ah!
      There's Diva at her window. We might pop in on her for a
      minute, and I'll break it to her about a State-opening for
      her tea-rooms . . . Take care, Georgie! There's Susan's
      Royce plunging down on us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyse's huge car, turning into the High Street, drew up
      directly between them and Diva's house. She let down the
      window and put her large round face where the window had
      been. As usual, she had on her ponderous fur-coat, but on
      her head was a quite new hat, to the side of which, like a
      cockade, was attached a trophy of bright blue, green and
      yellow plumage, evidently the wings, tail and breast of a
      small bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I give you a lift, dear?" she said in a mournful
      voice. "I'm going shopping in the High Street. You, too, of
      course, Mr. Georgie, if you don't mind sitting in front."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks, dear Susan," said Lucia, "but hardly worth
      while, as we are in the High Street already."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan nodded sadly to them, put up the window, and
      signalled to her chauffeur to proceed. Ten yards brought
      her to the grocer's, and the car stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, it was the remains of the budgerigar tacked to
      her hat," said Lucia in a thrilled whisper as they crossed
      the street. "Yes, Diva: we'll pop in for a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wearing it," said Diva in her telegraphic manner as she
      opened the front-door to them. "In her hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then is it true, Diva?" asked Lucia. "Did she sit down on
      her budgerigar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Definitely. I was having tea with her. Cage open.
      Budgerigar flitting about the room. A messy bird. Then
      Susan suddenly said 'Tweet, tweet. Where's my blue Birdie?'
      Not a sign of it. 'It'll be all right,' said Susan. 'In the
      piano or somewhere.' So we finished tea. Susan got up and
      there was blue Birdie. Dead and as flat as a pancake. We
      came away at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very tactful," said Georgie. "But the head wasn't on her
      hat, I'm pretty sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having it stuffed, I expect. To be added later between the
      wings. And what about those new clothes, Mr. Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How on earth did you hear that?" said Georgie in great
      astonishment. How news travelled in Tilling! Only last
      night, dining at home, he had worn the ruby-coloured velvet
      for the first time, and now, quite early next morning, Diva
      had heard about it. Really things were known in Tilling
      almost before they happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Janet was posting a letter, ten p.m.," said Diva.
      "Foljambe was posting a letter. They chatted. And are they
      really red?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll see before long," said Georgie, pleased to know
      that interest in his suit was blazing already. "Just wait
      and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this conversation had taken place on Diva's doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in for a minute," she said. "I want to consult you
      about my parlour, when I make it into a tea-room. Shall
      take away those two big tables, and put in six little ones,
      for four at each. Then there's the small room at the back
      full of things I could never quite throw away. Bird-cages.
      Broken coal-scuttles. Old towel-horses. I shall clear them
      out now, as there's no rummage-sale coming on. Put that big
      cupboard there against the wall, and a couple of card
      tables. People might like a rubber after their tea if it's
      raining. Me always ready to make a fourth if wanted. Won't
      that be cosy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very cosy indeed," said Lucia. "But may you provide
      facilities for gambling in a public place, without risking
      a police-raid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see why not," said Diva. "I may provide chess or
      draughts, and what's to prevent people gambling at them?
      Why not cards? And you will come in your robes, won't you,
      on Mayoring day, to inaugurate my tea-rooms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, quite impossible," said Lucia firmly. "As I told
      Georgie, I should have to be attended by my Aldermen and
      Councillors, as if it was some great public occasion. But
      I'll come as Mrs. Pillson, and everyone will say that the
      Mayor performed the opening ceremony. But, officially, I
      must be incognita."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's something," said Diva. "And may I put up some
      posters to say that Mrs. Pillson will open it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There can be no possible objection to that," said Lucia
      with alacrity. "That will not invalidate my incognita. Just
      some big lettering at the top 'Ye Olde Tea-House', and, if
      you think my name will help, big letters again for 'Mrs.
      Pillson' or 'Mrs. Pillson of Mallards'. Quite. Any other
      news? I know that your Paddy hasn't got mange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, I think. Oh yes, Elizabeth was in here just now,
      and asked me who was to be your Mayoress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Mayoress?" asked Lucia. "Aren't I both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I don't know," said Diva. "But she says she's
      sure all Mayors have Mayoresses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Elizabeth: she always gets things muddled. Oh, Diva,
      will you--No nothing: I'm muddled, too. Goodbye, dear. All
      too cosy for words. A month to-day, then, for the opening.
      Georgie, remind me to put that down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and her husband passed on up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such an escape!" she said. "I was on the point of asking
      Diva to dine and play bridge to-morrow, quite forgetting
      that I'd asked the Bartletts and the Wyses and the
      Mapp-Flints. You know, our custom of always asking husbands
      and wives together is rather Victorian. It dates us. I
      shall make innovations when the first terrific weeks of
      office are over. If we always ask couples, single people
      like Diva get left out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So shall I if the others do it, too," remarked Georgie.
      "Look, we've nearly caught up Susan. She's going into the
      post-office."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Susan, a few yards ahead, stepped ponderously out of the
      Royce, her head brushed against the side of the door, and a
      wing from the cockade of bright feathers, insecurely
      fastened, fluttered down on to the pavement. She did not
      perceive her loss, and went in to the office. Georgie
      picked up the plume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better put it back on the seat inside," whispered Lucia.
      "Not tactful to give it her in public. She'll see it when
      she gets in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may sit down on it again," whispered Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the far seat: that'll do. She can't miss it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed it carefully in the car, and they walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's always a joy to devise those little unseen
      kindnesses," said Lucia. "Poulterer's first, Georgie. If
      all my guests accept for to-morrow, I had better bespeak
      two brace of partridges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious," said Georgie, "but how about the plain living?
      Oh I see: that'll be after you become Mayor . . . Good
      morning, Padre."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Kenneth Bartlett stepped out of a shop in
      front. He always talked a mixture of faulty Scots and
      spurious Elizabethan English. It had been a playful
      diversion at first, but now it had become a habit, and
      unless carried away by the conversation he seldom spoke the
      current tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guid morrow, richt worshipful leddy," he said. "Well met,
      indeed, for there's a sair curiosity abroad, and 'tis you
      who can still it. Who's the happy wumman whom ye'll hae for
      your Mayoress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the second time I've been asked that this morning,"
      said Lucia. "I've had no official information that I must
      have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A'weel. It's early days yet. A month still before you need
      her. But ye mun have one: Mayor and Mayoress, 'tis the law
      o' the land. I was thinking--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's that helpmate of mine," he said. "Not that there's
      been any colloquy betune us. She just passed the remark
      this morning: 'I wonder who Mistress Pillson will select
      for her Mayoress,' and I said I dinna ken and left it
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wise," said Lucia encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre's language grew almost Anglicized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it put an idea into my head, that my Evie might be
      willing to help you in any way she could. She'd keep you in
      touch with all Church matters which I know you have at
      heart, and Sunday Schools and all that. Mind. I don't
      promise that she'd consent, but I think 'tis likely, though
      I wouldn't encourage false hopes. All confidential, of
      course; and I must be stepping."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked furtively round as if engaged in some dark
      conspiracy and stepped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I wonder if there can be any truth in it," said
      Lucia. "Of course, nothing would induce me to have poor
      dear little Evie as Mayoress. I would as soon have a mouse.
      Oh, there's Major Benjy: he'll be asking me next who my
      Mayoress is to be. Quick, into the poulterer's."
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried into the shop. Mr. Rice gave her a low bow.
      "Good-morning, your worship--" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not yet, Mr. Rice," said Lucia. "Not for a month yet.
      Partridges. I shall very likely want two brace of
      partridges to-morrow evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got some prime young birds, your worsh--ma'am," said
      Mr. Rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Please earmark four birds for me. I will let
      you know the first thing to-morrow morning, if I require
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Earmarked they are, ma'am," said Mr. Rice
      enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia peeped cautiously out. Major Benjy had evidently seen
      them taking cover, and was regarding electric heaters in
      the shop next door with an absent eye. He saw her look out
      and made a military salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning," he said cordially. "Lovely day isn't it?
      October's my favourite month. Chill October, what? I was
      wondering, Mrs. Pillson, as I strolled along, if you had
      yet selected the fortunate lady who will have the honour of
      being your Mayoress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Major. Oddly enough somebody else asked me
      that very thing a moment ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! I bet five to one I know who that was. I had a word or
      two with the Padre just now, and the subject came on the
      <i>tapis,</i> as they say in France. I fancy he's got some
      notion that that good little wife of his--but that would be
      too ridiculous--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've settled nothing yet," said Lucia. "So overwhelmed
      with work lately. Certainly it shall receive my attention.
      Elizabeth quite well? That's good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away with Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question of the Mayoress is in the air like influenza,
      Georgie," she said. "I must ring up the Town Hall as soon
      as I get in, and find out if I must have one. I see no
      necessity. There's Susan Wyse beckoning again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan let down the window of her car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just going home again," she said. "Shall I give you a lift
      up the hill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, a thousand thanks," said Lucia. "It's only a hundred
      yards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't overdo it, dear," she said. "As we get on in life we
      must be careful about hills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Mayoress business is worrying me, Georgie," said
      Lucia when Susan had driven off. "If it's all too true, and
      I must have one, who on earth shall I get? Everyone I can
      think of seems so totally unfit for it. I believe, do you
      know, that it must have been in Major Benjy's mind to
      recommend me to ask Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" said Georgie. "I might as well recommend you
      to ask Foljambe."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia found on her return to Mallards that Mrs. Simpson had
      got through the laborious task of typing three identical
      dinner invitations for next day to Mrs. Wyse, Mrs. Bartlett
      and Mrs. Mapp-Flint with husbands. She filled up in
      autograph "Dearest Susan, Evie and Elizabeth" and was
      affectionately theirs. Rack her brains as she would she
      could think of no further task for her secretary, so Mrs.
      Simpson took these letters to deliver them by hand, thus
      saving time and postage. "And could you be here at
      nine-thirty to-morrow morning," said Lucia, "instead of ten
      in case there is a stress of work? Things turn up so
      suddenly, and it would never do to fall into arrears."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked at her engagement book. Its fair white pages
      satisfied her that there were none at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be glad of a few days' quiet, dear," she said to
      Georgie. "I shall have a holiday of painting and music and
      reading. When once the rush begins there will be little
      time for such pursuits. Yet I know there was something very
      urgent that required my attention. Ah, yes! I must find out
      for certain whether I must have a Mayoress. And I must get
      a telephone extension into the garden-room, to save running
      in and out of the house for calls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia went in and rang up the clerk at the Town Hall. Yes:
      he was quite sure that every Mayor had a Mayoress, whom the
      Mayor invited to fill the post. She turned to Georgie with
      a corrugated brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is so," she said. "I shall have to find some
      capable obliging woman with whom I can work harmoniously.
      But who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The metallic clang of the flap of the letter-box on the
      front door caused her to look out of the window. There was
      Diva going quickly away with her scudding, birdlike walk.
      Lucia opened the note she had left, and read it. Though
      Diva was telegraphic in conversation, her epistolary style
      was flowing.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      DEAREST LUCIA,
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt quite shy of speaking to you about it to-day, for
      writing is always the best, don't you think, when it's
      difficult to find the right words or to get them out when
      you have, so this is to tell you that I am quite at your
      disposal, and shall [Note: Line missing in scanned copy]
      much longer in Tilling than you, dear, that perhaps I can
      be of some use in all your entertainments and other
      functions. Not that I would <i>ask</i> you to choose me as
      your Mayoress, for I shouldn't think of such a thing. So
      pushing! So I just want to say that I am quite at your
      service, as you may feel rather diffident about asking me,
      for it would be awkward for me to refuse, being such an old
      friend, if I didn't feel like it. But I should positively
      enjoy helping you, quite apart from my duty as a friend.
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      Ever yours,
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      DIVA.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear, ridiculous little Diva!" said Lucia, handing
      Georgie this artless epistle. "So ambitious and so
      pathetic! And now I shall hurry off to begin my sketch of
      the dahlias. I will not be interrupted by any further
      public business this morning. I must have a little time to
      myself--What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the metallic clang from the letter box, and Lucia,
      consumed with curiosity, again peeped out from a corner of
      the window and saw Mr. Wyse with his malacca cane and his
      Panama hat and his black velveteen coat, walking briskly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just an answer to my invitation for to-morrow, I expect,"
      she said. "Susan probably doesn't feel up to writing after
      the loss of her budgerigar. She had a sodden and battered
      look this morning, didn't you think, like a cardboard box
      that has been out in the rain. Flaccid. No resilience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had taken Mr. Wyse's letter from the post-box, as she
      made these tonic remarks. She glanced through it, her mouth
      falling wider and wider open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Georgie!" she said:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR AND WORSHIPFUL MAYOR-ELECT,
    </p>
    <p>
      It has reached my ears (Dame Rumour) that during the coming
      year, when you have so self-sacrificingly consented to fill
      the highest office which our dear little Tilling can
      bestow, thereby honouring itself so far more than you, you
      will need some partner to assist you in your arduous
      duties. From little unconscious signs, little involuntary
      self-betrayals that I have observed in my dear Susan, I
      think I may encourage you to hope that she <i>might</i> be
      persuaded to honour herself and you by accepting the
      onerous post which I hear is yet unfilled. I have not had
      any word with her on the subject. Nor is she aware that I
      am writing to you. As you know, she has sustained a severe
      bereavement in the sudden death of her little winged
      companion. But I have ventured to say to her, "<i>Carissima
      sposa,</i> you must buck up. You must not let a dead bird,
      however dear, stand between you and the duties and
      opportunities of life which may present themselves to you."
      And she answered (whether she guessed the purport of my
      exhortation, I cannot say), "I will make an effort,
      Algernon." I augur favourably from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the distinction which renders her so suitable for the
      post of Mayoress I need not speak, for you know her
      character so well. I might remind you, however, that our
      late beloved Sovereign himself bestowed on her the insignia
      of the Order of Member of the British Empire, and that she
      would therefore bring to her new office a <i>cachet</i>
      unshared by any of the otherwise estimable ladies of
      Tilling. And in this distressing estrangement which now
      exists between the kingdoms of England and Italy, the fact
      that my dear Susan is sister-in-law to my dear sister
      Amelia, Contessa di Faraglione, might help to heal the
      differences between the countries. In conclusion, dear
      lady, I do not think you could do better than to offer my
      Susan the post for which her distinction and abilities so
      eminently fit her, and you may be sure that I shall use my
      influence with her to get her to accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A rivederci, illustrissima Signora, ed anche presto!</i>
    </p>

      ALGERNON WYSE.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.: I will come round at any moment to confer with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.P.S.: I reopen this to add that Susan has just received
      your amiable invitation for to-morrow, which we shall both
      be honoured to accept.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and Georgie looked at each other in silence at the
      end of the reading of this elegant epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautifully expressed, I must allow," she said. "Oh,
      Georgie, it is a frightful responsibility to have patronage
      of this crucial kind in one's gift! It is mine to confer
      not only an honour but an influence for good of a most
      far-reaching sort. A line from me and Susan is my Mayoress.
      But good Susan has not the energy, the decision which I
      should look for. I could not rely on her judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She put Algernon up to writing that lovely letter," said
      Georgie. "How they're all struggling to be Mayoress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not surprised, dear, at that," said Lucia, with
      dignity. "No doubt also Evie got the Padre to recommend
      her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Diva recommended herself," remarked Georgie, "as she
      hadn't got anyone to do it for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Major Benjy was certainly going to say a word for
      Elizabeth, if I hadn't cut him short," said Lucia. "I find
      it all rather ugly, though, poor things, I sympathise with
      their ambitions which in themselves are noble. I shall have
      to draft two very tactful letters to Diva and Mr. Wyse,
      before Mrs. Simpson comes to-morrow. What a good thing I
      told her to come at half-past nine. But just for the
      present I shall dismiss it all from my mind, and seek an
      hour's peace with my paint-box and my <i>belli fiori.</i>
      What are you going to do till lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my day for cleaning my bibelots," said Georgie. "What
      a rush it all is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie went to his sitting-room and got busy. Soon he
      thought he heard another metallic clang from the post-box,
      and hurrying to the window, he saw Major Benjy walking
      briskly away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll be another formal application, I expect," he said
      to himself, and went downstairs to see, with his
      wash-leather in his hand. There was a letter in the
      post-box, but to his surprise it was addressed not to
      Lucia, but himself. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR PILLSON,
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife has just received Her Worship's most amiable
      invitation that we should dine <i>chez vous</i> to-morrow.
      I was on the point of writing to you in any case, so she
      begs me to say we shall be charmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my dear old man (if you'll permit me to call you so)
      I've a word to say to you. Best always, isn't it, to be
      frank and open. At least that's my experience in my
      twenty-five years of service in the King's (God bless him)
      army. So listen. <i>Re Mayoress.</i> It will be a
      tremendous asset to your wife's success in her most
      distinguished post, if she can get a wise and level-headed
      woman to assist her. A woman of commanding character,
      big-minded enough to disregard the little flurries and
      disturbances of her office, and above all one who has tact,
      and would never make mischief. Some of our mutual
      friends--I mention no names--are only too apt to scheme and
      intrigue and indulge in gossip and tittle-tattle. I can
      only put my finger on one who is entirely free from such
      failings, and that is my dear Elizabeth. I can't answer for
      her accepting the post. It's a lot to ask of any woman, but
      in my private opinion, if your wife approached Elizabeth in
      a proper spirit, making it clear how inestimable a help she
      (Elizabeth) would be to her, (the Mayor), I think we might
      hope for a favourable reply. Perhaps to-morrow evening I
      might have a quiet word with you. Sincerely yours,
    </p>

      BENJAMIN MAPP-FLINT (Major).

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie with his wash-leather hurried out to the
      <i>giardino segreto</i> where Lucia was drawing dahlias. He
      held the letter out to her, but she scarcely turned her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to tell me, dear, that your letter is on behalf of
      another applicant. Elizabeth Mapp-Flint, I believe. Read it
      me while I go on drawing. Such exquisite shapes: we do not
      look at flowers closely enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Georgie read it she plied a steady pencil, but when he
      came to the sentence about approaching Elizabeth in a
      proper spirit, her hand gave a violent jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, it isn't true!" she cried. "Show me. . . . Yes.
      My india-rubber? Ah, there it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie finished the letter, and Lucia, having rubbed out
      the random line her pencil had made, continued to draw
      dahlias with concentrated attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, it's too ridiculous of you to pretend to be
      absorbed in your sketch," he said impatiently. "What are
      you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia appeared to recall herself from the realms of peace
      and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elizabeth will be my Mayoress," she said calmly. "Don't
      you see, dear, she would be infinitely more tiresome if she
      wasn't? As Mayoress, she will be muzzled, so to speak.
      Officially, she will have to perform the tasks I allot to
      her. She will come to heel, and that will be very good for
      her. Besides, who else <i>is</i> there? Diva with her
      tea-shop? Poor Susan? Little mouse-like Evie Bartlett?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you see yourself approaching Elizabeth in a proper
      spirit?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a gay trill of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I cannot. I shall wait for her to approach me.
      She will have to come and implore me. I shall do nothing
      till then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie pondered on this extraordinary decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're being very rash," he said. "And you and
      Elizabeth hate each other like poison--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emphatically no," said Lucia. "I have had occasion
      sometimes to take her down a peg or two. I have sometimes
      felt it necessary to thwart her. But hate? Never. Dismiss
      that from your mind. And don't be afraid that I shall
      approach her in any spirit at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what am I to say to Benjy when he asks me for a few
      private words to-morrow night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, they'll all ask you for a few private words
      to-morrow night. There's the Padre running poor little
      Evie. There's Mr. Wyse running Susan. They'll all want to
      know whom I'm likely to choose, and to secure your
      influence with me. Be like Mr. Baldwin and say your lips
      are sealed, or like some other Prime Minister, wasn't it?
      who said 'Wait and see.' Counting Diva, there are four
      applicants now--remind me to tell Mrs. Simpson to enter
      them all--and I think the list may be considered closed.
      Leave it to me; be discreet . . . And the more I think of
      it, the more clearly I perceive that Elizabeth Mapp-Flint
      must be my Mayoress. It is far better to have her on a
      lead, bound to me by ties of gratitude than skulking about
      like a pariah dog, snapping at me. True, she may not be
      capable of gratitude, but I always prefer to look for the
      best in people, like Mr. Somerset Maugham in his delightful
      stories."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Simpson arriving at half-past nine next morning had to
      wait a considerable time for Lucia's tactful letters to
      Diva and Mr. Wyse; she and Georgie sat long after breakfast
      scribbling and erasing on half-sheets and envelopes turned
      inside out till they got thoroughly tactful drafts. Lucia
      did not want to tell Diva point-blank that she could not
      dream of asking her to be Mayoress, but she did not want to
      raise false hopes. All she could do was to thank her warmly
      for her offers of help ("So like you, dear Diva!") and to
      assure her that she would not hesitate to take advantage of
      them should occasion arise. To Mr. Wyse she said that no
      one had a keener appreciation of Susan's great gifts (so
      rightly recognised by the King) than she; no one more
      deplored the unhappy international relations between
      England and Italy . . . Georgie briefly acknowledged Major
      Benjy's letter and said he had communicated its contents to
      his wife, who was greatly touched. Lucia thought that these
      letters had better not reach their recipients till after
      her party, and Mrs. Simpson posted them later in the day.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was quite right about the husbands of expectant
      Mayoresses wanting a private word with Georgie that
      evening. Major Benjy and Elizabeth arrived first, a full
      ten minutes before dinner-time and explained to Foljambe
      that their clocks were fast, while Georgie in his new red
      velvet suit was putting the menu-cards which Mrs. Simpson
      had typed on the dinner-table. He incautiously put his head
      out of the dining-room door, while this explanation was
      going on, and Benjy spied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, a word with you, my dear old man," he exclaimed, and
      joined Georgie, while Elizabeth was taken to the
      garden-room to wait for Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my soul, amazingly stupid of us to have come so
      early," he said, closing the dining-room door behind him.
      "I told Liz we should be too early--ah, our clocks were
      fast. Don't let me interrupt you; charming flowers, and,
      dear me, what a handsome suit. Just the colour of my wife's
      dress. However, that's neither here nor there. What I
      should like to urge on you is to persuade your wife to take
      advantage of Elizabeth's willingness to become Mayoress,
      for the good of the town. She's willing, I gather, to
      sacrifice her time and her leisure for that. Mrs. Pillson
      and Mrs. Mapp-Flint would be an alliance indeed. But
      Elizabeth feels that her offer can't remain open
      indefinitely, and she rather expected to have heard from
      your wife to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But didn't you tell me, Major," asked Georgie, "that your
      wife knew nothing about your letter to me? I understood
      that it was only your opinion that if properly
      approached--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tap at the door, and Mr. Wyse entered. He was
      dressed in a brand new suit, never before seen in Tilling,
      of sapphire blue velvet, with a soft pleated shirt, a
      sapphire solitaire and bright blue socks. The two looked
      like two middle-aged male mannequins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyse began bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Georgie!" he said. "Major Benjy! The noise of voices.
      It occurred to me that perhaps we men were assembling here
      according to that pretty Italian custom, for a glass of
      vermouth, so my wife went straight out to the garden-room.
      I am afraid we are some minutes early. The Royce makes
      nothing of the steep hill from Starling Cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was disappointed at the ruby velvet not being the
      only sartorial sensation of the evening, but he took it
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening," he said. "Well, I do call that a lovely
      suit. I was just finishing the flowers, when Major Benjy
      popped in. Let us go out to the garden-room, where we shall
      find some sherry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, here be all the laddies," said the Padre. "Mr. Wyse; a
      handsome costume, sir. Just the colour of the dress wee
      wifie's donned for this evening. She's ganged awa' to the
      garden-room. I wanted a bit word wi' ye, Mr. Pillson, and
      your parlour-maid told me you were here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid we must go out now to the garden-room, Padre,"
      said Georgie, rather fussed. "They'll all be waiting for
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to get them to move, for each of the men
      stood aside to let the others pass, and thus secure a word
      with Georgie. Eventually the Church unwillingly headed the
      procession, followed by the Army, lured by the thought of
      sherry, and Mr. Wyse deftly closed the dining-room door
      again and stood in front of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A word, Mr. Georgie," he said. "I had the honour yesterday
      to write a note to your wife about a private matter--not
      private from you, of course--and I wondered whether she had
      spoken to you about it. I have since ascertained from my
      dear Susan--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened again, and bumped against his heels and the
      back of his head with a dull thud. Foljambe's face looked
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg your pardon, sir," she said. "Thought I heard you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must follow the others," said Georgie. "Lucia will
      wonder what's happened to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wives looked enquiringly into the faces of their
      husbands as they filed into the garden-room to see if there
      was any news. Georgie shook hands with the women and Lucia
      with the men. He saw how well his suit matched Elizabeth's
      gown, and Mr. Wyse's might have been cut from the same
      piece as that of the Padre's wife. Another brilliant point
      of colour was furnished by Susan Wyse's budgerigar. The
      wing that had been flipped off yesterday had been
      re-stitched, and the head, as Diva had predicted, had been
      stuffed and completed the bird. She wore this notable
      decoration as a centrepiece on her ample bosom. Would it be
      tactful, wondered Georgie, to admire it, or would it be
      tearing open old wounds again? But surely when Susan
      displayed her wound so conspicuously, she would be
      disappointed if he appeared not to see it. He gave her a
      glass of sherry and moved aside with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly charming, Mrs. Wyse," he said, looking pointedly
      at it. "Lovely! Most successful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done right; Susan's great watery smile spread across
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So glad you like it," she said, "and since I've worn it,
      Mr. Georgie, I've felt comforted for Blue Birdie. He seems
      to be with me still. A very strong impression. Quite
      psychical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very interesting and touching," said Georgie
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not? I am hoping to get into rapport with him again.
      His pretty sweet ways! And may I congratulate you, too?
      Such a lovely suit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia's present to me," said Georgie, "though I chose it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a coincidence!" said Susan. "Algernon's new suit is
      my present to him and he chose it. There are brain-waves
      everywhere, Mr. Georgie, beyond the farthest stars."
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe announced dinner. Never before had conversation,
      even at Lucia's table, maintained so serious and solid a
      tone. The ladies in particular, though the word Mayoress
      was never mentioned, vied with each other in weighty
      observations bearing on municipal matters, in order to show
      the deep interest they took in them. It was as if they even
      engaged on a self-imposed vive-voce examination to exhibit
      their qualifications for the unmentioned post. They
      addressed their answers to Lucia and of each other they
      were highly critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear Evie," said Elizabeth, "I cannot share your views
      about girl-guides. Boy scouts I wholeheartedly support. All
      that drill teaches them discipline, but the best discipline
      for girls is to help mother at home. Cooking, housework,
      lighting the fire, father's slippers. Don't you agree, dear
      hostess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, Mistress Mapp-Flint," said the Padre, strongly
      upholding his wife. "Ye havena' the tithe of my Evie's
      experience among the bairns of the parish. Half the
      ailments o' the lassies come from being kept at home
      without enough exercise and air and chance to fend for
      themselves. Easy to have too much of mother's apron
      strings, and as fur father's slippers I disapprove of
      corporal punishment for the young of whatever sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Padre, how could you think I meant that!" exclaimed
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as for letting a child light a fire," put in Susan,
      "that's most dangerous. No match-box should ever be allowed
      within a child's reach. I must say too, that I wish the
      fire-brigade in Tilling was better organized and more
      efficient. If once a fire broke out here the whole town
      would be burned to the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Susan, is it possible you haven't heard that there
      was a fire in Ford Place last week? Fancy! And you're
      strangely in error about the brigade's efficiency, for they
      were there in three minutes from the time the alarm was
      given, and the fire was extinguished in five minutes more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, what is really wanted in Tilling," said Susan, "is
      better lighting of the streets. Coming home sometimes in
      the evening my Royce has to crawl down Porpoise Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More powerful lamps to your car would make that all right,
      dear," said Elizabeth. "Not a very great expense. The
      paving of the streets, to my mind, wants the most immediate
      attention. I nearly fell down the other day, stepping in a
      great hole. The roads, too: the road opposite my house is
      little better than a snipe bog. Again and again I have
      written to the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyse bowed across the table to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret to say I have missed seeing your letters," he
      said. "Very careless of me. Was there one last week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie emitted the mouse-like squeak which denoted intense
      private amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've missed them, too," she said. "I expect we all have.
      In any case, Elizabeth, Grebe is outside the parish
      boundaries. Nothing to do with Tilling. It's a County
      Council road you will find if you look at a map. Now the
      overcrowding in the town itself, Lucia, is another matter
      which does concern us. I have it very much at heart, as
      anybody must have who knows anything about it. And then
      there are the postal deliveries. Shocking. I wrote a letter
      the other day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the subjects which Susan Wyse had specially
      mugged up. By leaning forward and putting an enormous elbow
      on the table she interposed a mountain of healthy animal
      tissue between Evie and Lucia, and the mouse was
      obliterated behind the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And only two posts a day, Lucia," she said. "You will find
      it terribly inconvenient to get only two and the second is
      never anything but circulars. There's not a borough in
      England so ill-served. I'm told that if a petition is sent
      to the Postmaster-General signed by fifty per cent. of the
      population he is bound by law to give us a third delivery.
      Algernon and I would be only too happy to get up this
      petition--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon from the other side of the table suddenly
      interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Susan, take care!" he cried. "Your budgerigar: your
      raspberry soufflé!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too late. The budgerigar dropped into the middle of
      Susan's bountifully supplied plate. She took it out,
      dripping with hot raspberry juice and wrapped it in her
      napkin, moaning softly to herself. The raspberry juice
      stained it red, as if Blue Birdie had been sat on again,
      and Foljambe very tactfully handed a plate to Susan on
      which she deposited it. After so sad and irrelevant an
      incident, it was hard to get back to high topics, and the
      Padre started on a lower level.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cosy little establishment will Mistress Diva Plaistow be
      running presently," he said. "She tells me that the opening
      of it will be the first function of our new Mayor. A fine
      send-off indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      A simultaneous suspicion shot through the minds of the
      candidates present that Diva (incredible as it seemed)
      might be in the running. Like vultures they swooped on the
      absent prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little too cosy for my tastes," said Elizabeth. "If all
      the tables she means to put into her tea-room were full,
      sardines in a tin wouldn't be the word. Not to mention that
      the occupants of two of the tables would be being kippered
      up the chimney, and two others in a gale every time the
      door was opened. And are you going to open it officially,
      dear Lucia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Lucia. "I told her I would drink the
      first cup of tea with pleasure, but as Mrs. Pillson, not as
      Mayor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Diva can't <i>make</i> tea," squeaked Evie. "She
      never could. It's either hot water or pure tannin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she intends to make all the fancy pastry herself,"
      said Susan sorrowfully. "Much better to stick to bread and
      butter and a plain cake. Very ambitious, I call it, but
      nowadays Diva's like that. More plans for all we know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And quite a reformer," said Elizabeth. "She talks about a
      quicker train service to London. She knows a brother-in-law
      of one of the directors. Of course the thing is as good as
      done with a word from Diva. It looks terribly like paranoia
      coming on."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies left. Major Benjy drunk off his port in a great
      hurry, so as to get a full glass when it came round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very good glass of port," he said. "Well, I don't mind
      if I fill up. The longer I live with my Liz., Pillson, the
      more I am astonished at her masculine grasp of new ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Susan's remarks about an additional postal delivery and
      lighting of the streets showed a very keen perception of
      the reforms of which our town most stands in need," said
      Algernon. "Her judgment is never at fault. I have often
      been struck--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre, speaking to Major Benjy, raised his voice for
      Georgie to hear and thumped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wee wifie's energy is unbounded," he said. "Often I say to
      her: 'Spare yourself a bitty' I've said, and always she's
      replied 'Heaven fits the back to the burden' quo' she, 'and
      if there's more work and responsibility to be undertaken,
      Evie's ready for it'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't let her overtax herself, Padre," said Benjy
      with great earnestness. "She's got her hands over full
      already. Not so young as she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, that's what ails all the ladies of Tilling," retorted
      the Padre, "an' she'll be younger than many I could
      mention. An abounding vitality. If they made me Lord
      Archbishop to-morrow, she'd be a mother in Israel to the
      province, and no mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Benjy. It would have been a gross
      dereliction of duty not to let loose his withering powers
      of satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No no, Padre," he said. "Tilling can't spare you.
      Canterbury must find someone else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, well, and if the War Office tries to entice you away,
      Major, you must say no. That'll be a bargain. But the point
      of my observation was that my Evie is aye ready and willing
      for any call that may come to her. That's what I'm getting
      at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha, Padre; let me know when you've got it, and then
      I'll talk to you. Well, if the port is standing idle in
      front of you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie rose. He had had enough of these unsolicited
      testimonials, and when Benjy became satirical it was a
      symptom that he should have no more port.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's time we got to our Bridge," he said. "Lucia
      will scold me if I keep you here too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      They marched in a compact body to the garden-room, where
      Lucia had been keeping hopeful Mayoresses at bay with
      music, and two tables were instantly formed. Georgie and
      Elizabeth, rubies, played against the sapphires, Mr. Wyse
      and Evie, and the other table was drab in comparison. The
      evening ended unusually late, and it was on the stroke of
      midnight when the three pairs of guests, unable to get a
      private word with either of their hosts, moved sadly away
      like a vanquished army. The Royce conveyed the Wyses to
      Porpoise Street, just round the corner, with Susan, faintly
      suggesting Salome, holding the plate with the bloodstained
      handkerchief containing the budgerigar; a taxi that had
      long been ticking conveyed the Mapp-Flints to the
      snipe-bog, and two pairs of goloshes took the Padre and his
      wife to the Vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's tactful letters were received next morning. Mr.
      Wyse thought that all was not yet lost, though it surprised
      him that Lucia had not taken Susan aside last night and
      implored her to be Mayoress. Diva, on the other hand, with
      a more correct estimate of the purport of Lucia's tact, was
      instantly sure that all was lost, and exclaiming, "Drat it,
      so that's that," gave Lucia's note to Paddy to worry, and
      started out for her morning's shopping. There were plenty
      of absorbing interests to distract her. Susan, with the
      budgerigar cockade in her hat, looked out of the window of
      the Royce, but to Diva's amazement the colour of the bird's
      plumage had changed; it was flushed with red like a stormy
      sunset with patches of blue sky behind. Could Susan, for
      some psychical reason, have dyed it? . . . Georgie and
      Lucia were approaching from Mallards, but Diva, after that
      tactful note, did not want to see her friend till she had
      thought of something pretty sharp to say. Turning towards
      the High Street she bumped baskets sharply with Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, dear!" said Elizabeth. "Do you feel up to a
      chat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Diva. "Come in. I'll do my shopping afterwards.
      Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benjy and I dined with Worshipful last night. Wyses,
      Bartletts, Bridge. We all missed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't asked," said Diva. "A good dinner? Did you win?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partridges a little tough," said Elizabeth musingly. "Old
      birds are cheaper, of course. I won a trifle, but nothing
      like enough to pay for our taxi. An interesting, curious
      evening. Rather revolting at times, but one mustn't be
      captious. Evie and Susan--oh, a terrible thing happened.
      Susan wore the bird as a breastplate, and it fell into the
      raspberry soufflé. Plop!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva gave a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>That</i> explains it," she said. "Saw it just now and
      it puzzled me. Go on, Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revolting, I was saying. Those two women. One talked about
      boy-scouts, and the other about posts, and then one about
      overcrowding and the other about the fire brigade. I just
      sat and listened and blushed for them both. So cheap and
      obvious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's so cheap and obvious and blush-making?" asked
      Diva. "It only sounds dull to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that fictitious interest in municipal matters. What
      has Susan cared hitherto for postal deliveries, or Evie for
      overcrowding? In a nutshell, they were trying to impress
      Lucia, and get her to ask them, at least one of them, to be
      Mayoress. And from what Benjy told me, their husbands were
      just as barefaced when we went into the garden-room. An
      evening of intrigue and self-advertisement. Pah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pah indeed!" said Diva. "How did Lucia take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really hardly noticed. I was too disgusted at all these
      underground schemings. So transparent! Poor Lucia! I trust
      she will get someone who will be of use to her. She'll be
      sadly at sea without a woman of sense and experience to
      consult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was Mr. Georgie's dinner costume very lovely?" asked
      Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth half closed her eyes as if to visualise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very pretty colour," she said. "Just like the gown I had
      dyed red not long ago, if you happen to remember it. Of
      course he copied it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The front-door bell rang. It was quicker to answer it
      oneself, thought Diva, than to wait for Janet to come up
      from the kitchen, and she trundled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Evie," she said, "Elizabeth's here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elizabeth would not wait, and Evie, in turn, gave her
      own impressions of the previous evening. They were on the
      same lines as Elizabeth's, only it had been Elizabeth and
      Susan who (instead of revolting her) had been so vastly
      comical with their sudden interest in municipal affairs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, oh, dear me," she said, "Mr. Wyse and Major Benjy
      were just as bad. It was like that musical thing where you
      have a tune in the treble, and the same tune next in the
      bass. Fugue; that's it. Those four were just like a Bach
      concert. Kenneth and I simply sat listening. And I'm much
      mistaken if Lucia and Mr. Georgie didn't see through them
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva had now got a complete idea of what had taken place;
      clearly there had been a six-part fugue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she's got to choose somebody," she said. "Wonder who
      it'll be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you, he, he!" squeaked Evie for a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That it won't," cried Diva emphatically, looking at the
      fragments of Lucia's tactful note scattered about the room.
      "Sooner sing songs in the gutter. Fancy being at Lucia's
      beck and call, whenever she wants something done which she
      doesn't want to do herself. Not worth living at that price.
      No, thank you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just my fun," said Evie. "I didn't mean it seriously. And
      then there were other surprises. Mr. Georgie in a red--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know; the colour of Elizabeth's dyed one," put in Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and Mr. Wyse in sapphire velvet," continued Evie. "Just
      like my second-best, which I was wearing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I hadn't heard that," said Diva. "Aren't the Tilling
      boys getting dressy?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The tension increased during the next week to a point
      almost unbearable, for Lucia, like the Pythian Oracle in
      unfavourable circumstances, remained dumb, waiting for
      Elizabeth to implore her. The strain was telling and
      whenever the telephone bell rang in the houses of any of
      the candidates she or her husband ran to it to see if it
      carried news of the nomination. But, as at an inconclusive
      sitting of the Conclave of Cardinals for the election of
      the Pontiff, no announcement came from the precinct; and
      every evening, since the weather was growing chilly, a
      column of smoke curled out of the chimney of the
      garden-room. Was it that Lucia, like the Cardinals, could
      not make up her mind, or had she possibly chosen her
      Mayoress and had enjoined silence till she gave the word?
      Neither supposition seemed likely, the first, because she
      was so very decisive a person; the second, because it was
      felt that the chosen candidate could not have kept it to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a series of curious things happened, and to the
      overwrought imagination of Tilling they appeared to be of
      the nature of omens. The church clock struck thirteen one
      noon, and then stopped with a jarring sound. That surely
      augured ill for the chances of the Padre's wife. A spring
      broke out in the cliff above the Mapp-Flint's house, and,
      flowing through the garden, washed the asparagus bed away.
      That looked like Elizabeth's hopes being washed away too.
      Susan Wyse's Royce collided with a van in the High Street
      and sustained damage to a mud-guard; that looked bad for
      Susan. Then Elizabeth, distraught with anxiety, suddenly
      felt convinced that Diva had been chosen. What made this
      the more probable was that Diva had so emphatically denied
      to Evie that she would ever be induced to accept the post.
      It was like poor Diva to think that anybody would believe
      such a monstrous statement; it only convinced Elizabeth
      that she was telling a thumping lie, in order to conceal
      something. Probably she thought she was being Bismarckian,
      but that was an error. Bismarck had said that to tell the
      truth was a useful trick for a diplomatist, because others
      would conclude that he was not. But he had never said that
      telling lies would induce others to think that he was
      telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went on, and Georgie began to have qualms as to
      whether Elizabeth would ever humble herself and implore the
      boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time's passing," he said, as he and Lucia sat one morning
      in the garden-room. "What on earth will you do, if she
      doesn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will," said Lucia, "though I allow she has held out
      longer than I expected. I did not know how strong that
      false pride of hers was. But she's weakening. I've been
      sitting in the window most of the morning--such a
      multiplicity of problems to think over--and she has passed
      the house four times since breakfast. Once she began to
      cross the road to the front-door, but then she saw me, and
      walked away again. The sight of me, poor thing, must have
      made more vivid to her what she had to do. But she'll come
      to it. Let us discuss something more important. That idea
      of mine about reviving the fishing industry. The Royal Fish
      Express. I made a few notes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia glanced once more out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie," she cried. "There's Elizabeth approaching again.
      That's the fifth time. Round and round like a squirrel in
      its cage."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glided to her ambush behind the curtain, and, peeping
      stealthily out, became like the reporter of the University
      boat-race on the wireless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's just opposite, level with the front-door," she
      announced. "She's crossing the road. She's quickening up.
      She's crossed the road. She's slowing down on the
      front-door steps. She's raised her hand to the bell. She's
      dropped it again. She turned half-round--no, I don't think
      she saw me. Poor woman, what a tussle! Just pride. Georgie,
      she's rung the bell. Foljambe's opened the door; she must
      have been dusting the hall. Foljambe's let her in, and has
      shut the door. She'll be out here in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Mapp-Flint, ma'am," she said. "I told her you were
      probably engaged, but she much wants to see you for a few
      moments on a private matter of great importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sat down in a great hurry, and spread some papers on
      the table in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go into the garden, will you, Georgie," she said, "for
      she'll never be able to get it out unless we're alone. Yes,
      Foljambe; tell her I can spare her five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later Elizabeth again stood on the doorstep of
      Mallards, uncertain whether to go home to Grebe by the
      Vicarage and tell inquisitive Evie the news, or <i>via</i>
      Irene and Diva. She decided on the latter route,
      unconscious of the vast issues that hung on this apparently
      trivial choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this warm October morning, quaint Irene (having no
      garden) was taking the air on a pile of cushions on her
      door-step. She had a camera beside her in case of
      interesting figures passing by, and was making tentative
      jottings in her sketch-book for her Victorian Venus in a
      tartan shawl. Irene noticed something peculiarly buoyant
      about Elizabeth's gait, as she approached, and with her
      Venus in mind she shouted to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand still a moment, Mapp. Stand on one leg in a poised
      attitude. I want that prancing action. One arm forward if
      you can manage it without tipping up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth would have posed for the devil in this triumphant
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like that, you quaint darling?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect. Hold it for a second while I snap you first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene focused and snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now half a mo' more," she said, seizing her sketchbook.
      "Be on the point of stepping forward again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene dashed in important lines and curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll do," she said. "I've got you. I never saw you so
      lissom and elastic. What's up? Have you been successfully
      seducing some young lad in the autumn of your life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you shocking thing," said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty! But I've just been having such a lovely talk with
      our sweet Lucia. Shall I tell you about it, or shall I
      tease you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whichever you like," said Irene, putting in a little
      shading. "I don't care a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll give you a hint. Make a pretty curtsey to the
      Mayoress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish," said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear. Not rubbish. Gospel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, what an imagination you have," said Irene. "How do
      you <i>do</i> it? Does it just come to you like a dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gospel, I repeat," said Elizabeth. "And such joy, dear,
      that you should be the first to hear about it, except Mr.
      Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked at her and was forced to believe. Unaffected
      bliss beamed in Mapp's face; she wasn't pretending to be
      pleased, she wallowed in a bath of exuberant happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord, tell me about it," she said. "Bring another
      cushion, Lucy," she shouted to her six-foot maid, who was
      leaning out of the dining-room window, greedily listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear, it was an utter surprise to me," said
      Elizabeth. "Such a notion had never entered my head. I was
      just walking up by Mallards: I often stroll by to look at
      the sweet old home that used to be mine--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can cut all that," said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and I saw Lucia at the window of the garden-room,
      looking, oh, so anxious and worn. She slipped behind a
      curtain and suddenly I felt that she needed me. A sort of
      presentiment. So I rang the bell--oh, and that was odd,
      too, for I'd hardly put my finger on it when the door was
      opened, as if kind Foljambe had been waiting for me--and I
      asked her if Lucia would like to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth paused for a moment in her embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Foljambe went to ask her," she continued, "and came
      almost running back, and took me out to the garden-room.
      Lucia was sitting at her table apparently absorbed in some
      papers. Wasn't that queer, for the moment before she had
      been peeping out from behind the curtain? I could see she
      was thoroughly overwrought and she gave me such an
      imploring look that I was quite touched."
    </p>
    <p>
      A wistful smile spread over Elizabeth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then it came," she said. "I don't blame her for
      holding back: a sort of pride, I expect, which she couldn't
      swallow. She begged me to fill the post, and I felt it was
      my duty to do so. A dreadful tax, I am afraid, on my time
      and energies, and there will be difficult passages ahead,
      for she is not always very easy to lead. What Benjy will
      say to me I don't know, but I must do what I feel to be
      right. What a blessed thing to be able to help others!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was holding herself in, trembling slightly with the
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth continued, still wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lovely little talk," she said, "and then there was Mr.
      Georgie in the garden, and he came across the lawn to me
      with such questioning eyes, for I think he guessed what we
      had been talking about--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene could contain herself no longer. She gave one maniac
      scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mapp, you make me sick," she cried. "I believe Lucia has
      asked you to be Mayoress, poor misguided darling, but it
      didn't happen like that. It isn't true, Mapp. You've been
      longing to be Mayoress: you've been losing weight, not a
      bad thing either, with anxiety. You asked her: you implored
      her. I am not arguing with you, I am telling you . . .
      Hullo, here they both come. It will be pretty to see their
      gratitude to you. Don't go, Mapp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth rose. Dignity prevented her from making any reply
      to these gutter-snipe observations. She did it very well.
      She paused to kiss her hand to the approaching Lucia, and
      walked away without hurrying. But once round the corner
      into the High Street, she, like Foljambe, "almost ran".
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene hailed Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and talk for a minute, darling," she said. "First, is
      it all too true, Mayoress Mapp, I mean? I see it is. You
      had far better have chosen me or Lucy. And what a liar she
      is! Thank God I told her so. She told me that you had at
      last swallowed your pride, and asked her--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" cried Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that; and that she felt it was her duty to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, though trembling with indignation, was magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing!" she said. "Like all habitual liars, she
      deceives herself far more often than she deceives others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But aren't you going to <i>do</i> anything?" asked Irene,
      dancing wild fandangoes on the doorstep. "Not tell her
      she's a liar? Or, even better, tell her you never asked her
      to be Mayoress at all! Why not? There was no one there but
      you and she."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Irene, you wouldn't want me to lower myself to her
      level?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, for once it wouldn't be a bad thing. You can become
      lofty again immediately afterwards. But I'll develop the
      snap-shot I made of her, and send it to the press as a
      photograph of our new Mayoress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an hour the news was stale. But the question of how
      the offer was made and accepted was still interesting, and
      fresh coins appeared from Elizabeth's mint: Lucia, it
      appeared had said "Beloved friend, I could never have
      undertaken my duties without your support" or words to that
      effect, and Georgie had kissed the hand of the Mayoress
      Elect. No repudiation of such sensational pieces came from
      head-quarters and they passed into a sort of doubtful
      currency. Lucia merely shrugged her shoulders, and said
      that her position forbade her directly to defend herself.
      This was thought a little excessive; she was not actually
      of Royal blood. A brief tranquillity followed, as when a
      kettle, tumultuously boiling, is put on the hob to cool
      off, and the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> merely stated that Mrs.
      Elizabeth Mapp-Flint (née Mapp) would be Mayoress of
      Tilling for the ensuing year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next week the kettle began to lift its lid again, for in
      the same paper there appeared a remarkable photograph of
      the Mayoress. She was standing on one foot, as if skating,
      with the other poised in the air behind her. Her face wore
      a beckoning smile, and one arm was stretched out in front
      of her in eager solicitation. Something seemed bound to
      happen. It did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva by this time had furnished her tea-room, and was
      giving dress-rehearsals, serving tea herself to a few
      friends and then sitting down with them, very hot and
      thirsty. To-day Georgie and Evie were being entertained,
      and the Padre was expected. Evie did not know why he was
      late: he had been out in the parish all day, and she had
      not seen him since after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing like rehearsals to get things working smoothly,"
      said Diva, pouring her tea into her saucer and blowing on
      it. "There are two jams, Mr. Georgie, thick and clear, or
      is that soup?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're both beautifully clear," said Georgie politely,
      "and such hot, crisp toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There should have been pastry-fingers as well," said Diva,
      "but they wouldn't rise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tar'some things," said Georgie with his mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuck to the tin and burned," replied Diva. "You must
      imagine them here even for a shilling tea. And cream for
      eighteenpenny teas with potted meat sandwiches. Choice of
      China or Indian. Tables for four can be reserved, but not
      for less. . . . Ah, here's the Padre. Have a nice cup of
      tea, Padre, after all those funerals and baptisms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry I'm late, Mistress Plaistow," said he, "and I've a
      bit o' news, and what d'ye think that'll be about? Shall I
      tease you, as Mistress Mapp-Flint says?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't tease me," said Georgie, "because I know it's
      about that picture of Elizabeth in the <i>Hampshire
      Argus.</i> And I can tell you at once that Lucia knew
      nothing about it, whatever Elizabeth may say, till she saw
      it in the paper. Nothing whatever, except that Irene had
      taken a snap-shot of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, you know nowt o' my news. I was sitting in the
      club for a bitty, towards noon, when in came Major Benjy,
      and picked up the copy of the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> where
      was the portrait of his guid wife. I heard a sort o'
      gobbling turkey-cock noise and there he was, purple in the
      face, wi' heathen expressions streaming from him like
      torrents o' spring. Out he rushed with the paper in his
      hand--club-property, mind you, and not his at all--and I
      saw him pelting down the road to Grebe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" cried Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mistress Plaistow. A bit later as I was doing my
      parish visiting, I saw the Major again with the famous cane
      riding-whip in his hand, with which, we've all heard often
      enough, he hit the Indian tiger in the face while he
      snatched his gun to shoot him. 'No one's going to insult my
      wife, while I'm above ground,' he roared out, and popped
      into the office o' the <i>Hampshire Argus."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! What a crisis!" squeaked Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's but the commencement, mem! The rest I've heard
      from the new Editor, Mr. McConnell, who took over not a
      week ago. Up came a message to him that Major Mapp-Flint
      would like to see him at once. He was engaged, but said
      he'd see the Major in a quarter of an hour, and to pass the
      time wouldn't the Major have a drink. Sure he would, and
      sure he'd have another when he'd made short work of the
      first, and, to judge by the bottle, McConnell guessed he'd
      had a third, but he couldn't say for certain. Be that as it
      may, when he was ready to see the Major, either the Major
      had forgotten what he'd come about, or thought he'd be more
      prudent not to be so savage, for a big man is McConnell, a
      very big man indeed, and the Major was most affable, and
      said he'd just looked in to pay a call on the newcomer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that was a come-down," ejaculated Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And further to come down yet," said the Padre, "for they
      had another drink together, and the poor Major's mind must
      have got in a fair jumble. He'd come out, ye see, to give
      the man a thrashing, and instead they'd got very pleasant
      together, and now he began talking about bygones being
      bygones. That as yet was Hebrew-Greek to McConnell, for it
      was the Art-Editor who'd been responsible for the picture
      of the Mayoress and McConnell had only just glanced at it,
      thinking there were some queer Mayoresses in Hampshire, and
      then, oh, dear me, if the Major didn't ask him to step
      round and have a bit of luncheon with him, and as for the
      riding-whip it went clean out of his head and he left it in
      the waiting-room at the office. There was Mistress
      Elizabeth when they got to Grebe, looking out o' the
      parlour window and waiting to see her brave Benjy come
      marching back with the riding-whip shewing a bit of wear
      and tear, and instead there was the Major with no
      riding-whip at all, arm in arm with a total stranger saying
      as how this was his good friend Mr. McConnell, whom he'd
      brought to take pot-luck with them. Dear, oh dear, what
      wunnerful things happen in Tilling, and I'll have a look at
      that red conserve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it all," cried Diva. "And did they have lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did that," said the Padre, "though a sorry one it
      was. It soon came out that Mr. McConnell was the Editor of
      the <i>Argus,</i> and then indeed there was a terrifying
      glint in the lady's eye. He made a hop and a skip of it
      when the collation was done, leaving the twa together, and
      he told me about it a' when I met him half an hour ago and
      'twas that made me a bit late, for that's the kind of tale
      ye can't leave in the middle. God knows what'll happen now,
      and the famous riding-whip somewhere in the newspaper
      office."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door-bell had rung while this epic was being related,
      but nobody noticed it. Now it was ringing again, a long,
      uninterrupted tinkle, and Diva rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shan't be a second," she said. "Don't discuss it too much
      till I get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be Elizabeth herself," she thought excitedly.
      "Nobody else rings like that. Using up such a lot of
      current, instead of just dabbing now and then."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door. Elizabeth was on the threshold smiling
      brilliantly. She carried in her hand the historic
      riding-whip. Quite unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear one!" she said. "May I pop in for a minute. Not seen
      you for so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva overlooked the fact that they had had a nice chat this
      morning in the High Street, for there was a good chance of
      hearing more. She abounded in cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come in," she said. "Lovely to see you after all this
      long time. Tea going on. A few friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sidled into the tea-room: the door was narrow for
      a big woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evie dearest! Mr. Georgie! Padre!" she saluted. "How de do
      everybody. How cosy! Yes, Indian, please, Diva."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid the whip down by the corner of the fireplace. She
      beamed with geniality. What turn could this humiliating
      incident have taken, everybody wondered, to make her so
      jocund and gay? In sheer absorption of constructive thought
      the Padre helped himself to another dollop of red jam and
      ate it with his teaspoon. Clearly she had reclaimed the
      riding-whip from the <i>Argus</i> office but what next? Had
      she administered to Benjy the chastisement he had feared to
      inflict on another? Meantime, as puzzled eyes sought each
      other in perplexity, she poured forth compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a banquet, Diva!" she exclaimed. "What a pretty
      tablecloth! If this is the sort of tea you will offer us
      when you open, I shan't be found at home often. I suppose
      you'll charge two shillings at least, and even then you'll
      be turning people away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva recalled herself from her speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: this will be only a shilling tea," she said, "and
      usually there'll be pastry as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy! And so beautifully served. So dainty. Lovely
      flowers on the table. Quite like having tea in the garden
      with no earwigs . . . I had an unexpected guest to lunch
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cataleptic rigidity seized the entire company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a pleasant fellow," continued Elizabeth. "Mr.
      McConnell, the new Editor of the <i>Argus.</i> Benjy paid a
      morning call on him at the office and brought him home. He
      left his tiger-riding-whip there, the forgetful boy, so I
      went and reclaimed it. Such a big man: Benjy looked like a
      child beside him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sipped her tea. The rigidity persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never by any chance see the <i>Hampshire Argus,"</i> she
      said. "Not set eyes on it for years, for it used to be very
      dull. All advertisements. But with Mr. McConnell at the
      helm, I must take it in. He seemed so intelligent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperceptibly the rigidity relaxed, as keen brains
      dissected the situation . . . Elizabeth had sent her
      husband out to chastise McConnell for publishing this
      insulting caricature of herself. He had returned, rather
      tipsy, bringing the victim to lunch. Should the true
      version of what had happened become current, she would find
      herself in a very humiliating position with a craven
      husband and a monstrous travesty unavenged. But her version
      was brilliant. She was unaware that the <i>Argus</i> had
      contained any caricature of her, and Benjy had brought his
      friend to lunch. A perfect story, to the truth of which, no
      doubt, Benjy would perjure himself. Very clever! Bravo
      Elizabeth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was a slight feeling of disappointment, for
      only a few minutes ago some catastrophic development seemed
      likely, and Tilling's appetite for social catastrophe was
      keen. The Padre sighed and began in a resigned voice
      "A'weel, all's well that ends well", and Georgie hurried
      home to tell Lucia what had really happened and how clever
      Elizabeth had been. She sent fondest love to Worshipful,
      and as there were now four of them left, they adjourned to
      Diva's card-room for a rubber of bridge.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Diva's Janet came up to clear tea away, and with her the
      bouncing Irish terrier, Paddy, who had only got a little
      eczema. He scouted about the room, licking up crumbs from
      the floor and found the riding-whip. It was of agreeable
      texture for the teeth, just about sufficiently tough to
      make gnawing a pleasure as well as a duty. He picked it up,
      and, the back-door being open, took it into the wood-shed
      and dealt with it. He went over it twice, reducing it to a
      wet and roughly minced sawdust. There was a silver cap on
      it, which he spurned and when he had triturated or
      swallowed most of the rest, he rolled in the debris and
      shook himself. Except for the silver cap, no murderer could
      have disposed of a corpse with greater skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs the geniality of the tea-table had crumbled over
      cards. Elizabeth had been losing and she was feeling hot.
      She said to Diva "This little room--so cosy--is quite
      stifling, dear. May we have the window open?" Diva opened
      it as a deal was in progress, and the cards blew about the
      table: Elizabeth's remnant consisted of Kings and aces, but
      a fresh deal was necessary. Diva dropped a card on the
      floor, face upwards, and put her foot on it so nimbly that
      nobody could see what it was. She got up to fetch the book
      of rules to see what ought to happen next, and, moving her
      foot disclosed an ace. Elizabeth demanded another fresh
      deal. That was conceded, but it left a friction. Then
      towards the end of a hand, Elizabeth saw that she had
      revoked, long, long ago, and detection was awaiting her.
      "I'll give you the last trick," she said, and attempted to
      jumble up together all the cards. "Na, na, not so fast,
      Mistress," cried the Padre, and he pounced on the card of
      error. "Rather like cheating: rather like Elizabeth" was
      the unspoken comment, and everyone remembered how she had
      tried the same device about eighteen months ago. The
      atmosphere grew acid. The Padre and Evie had to hurry off
      for a choir-practice, for which they were already late, and
      Elizabeth finding she had not lost as much as she feared
      lingered for a chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen poor Susan Wyse lately?" she asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva was feeling abrupt. It <i>was</i> cheating to try to
      mix up the cards like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This morning," she said. "But why 'poor'? You're always
      calling people 'poor'. She's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think she's got over the budgerigar?" asked
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite. Wearing it to-day. Still raspberry-coloured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if she has got over it," mused Elizabeth. "If you
      ask me, I think the budgerigar has got over her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the foggiest notion what you mean," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what I say. She believes she is getting in touch with
      the bird's spirit. She told me so herself. She thinks that
      she hears that tiresome little squeak it used to make, only
      she now calls it singing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Singing in the ears, I expect," interrupted Diva. "Had it
      sometimes myself. Wax. Syringe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and the flutter of its wings," continued Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's trying to get communications from it by automatic
      script. I hope our dear Susan won't go dotty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish!" said Diva severely, her thoughts going back
      again to that revoke. She moved her chair up to the fire,
      and extinguished Elizabeth by opening the evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayoress bristled and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we shall see whether it's rubbish or not," she said.
      "Such a lovely game of Bridge, but I must be off. Where's
      Benjy's riding-whip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherever you happened to put it, I suppose," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked in the corner by the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's where I put it," she said. "Who can have moved it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, of course. Probably took it into the card-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm perfectly certain I didn't," said Elizabeth, hurrying
      there. "Where's the switch, Diva?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behind the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an inconvenient place to put it. It ought to have
      been the other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth cannoned into the card-table and a heavy fall of
      cards and markers followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid I've upset something," she said. "Ah, I've got it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said you'd taken it there yourself," said Diva. "Pick
      those things up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the riding-whip; the switch," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked in this corner and that, and under tables
      and chairs, but there was no sign of what she sought. She
      came out, leaving the light on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here," she said. "Perhaps the Padre has taken it. Or
      Evie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better go round and ask them," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear. Or might I use your telephone? It would
      save me a walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      The call was made, but they were both at choir-practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or Mr. Georgie, do you think?" asked Elizabeth. "I'll just
      enquire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one of Diva's most sacred economies was the telephone.
      She would always walk a reasonable distance herself to
      avoid these outlays which, though individually small,
      mounted up so ruinously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want to telephone to all Tilling, Elizabeth," she
      said, "you'd better go home and do it from there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about that," said Elizabeth effusively; "I'll
      pay you for the calls now, at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her bag, dropped it, and a shower of coins of
      low denomination scattered in all directions on the parquet
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clumsy of me," she said, pouncing on the bullion.
      "Ninepence in coppers, two sixpences and a shilling, but I
      know there was a threepenny bit. It must have rolled under
      your pretty sideboard. Might I have a candle, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Diva firmly. "If there's a threepenny bit, Janet
      will find it when she sweeps in the morning. You must get
      along without it till then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no 'if' about it, dear. There <i>was</i> a
      threepenny bit. I specially noticed it because it was a new
      one. With your permission I'll ring up Mallards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe answered. No; Mr. Georgie had taken his umbrella
      when he went out to tea, and he couldn't have brought back
      a riding-whip by mistake . . . Would Foljambe kindly make
      sure by asking him . . . He was in his bath . . . Then
      would she just call through the door. Mrs. Mapp-Flint would
      hold the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Elizabeth waited for the answer, humming a little tune,
      Janet came in with Diva's glass of sherry. She put up two
      fingers and her eyebrows to enquire whether she should
      bring two glasses, and Diva shook her head. Presently
      Georgie came to the telephone himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't have bothered you for words, Mr. Georgie," said
      Elizabeth. "Foljambe said you were in your bath. She must
      have made a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just going," said Georgie rather crossly, for the
      water must be getting cold. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benjy's riding-whip has disappeared most mysteriously, and
      I can't rest till I trace it. I thought you might possibly
      have taken it away by mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, the tiger one?" said Georgie, much interested in
      spite of the draught round his ankles. "What a disaster.
      But I haven't got it. What a series of adventures it's had!
      I saw you bring it into Diva's; I noticed it particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Elizabeth, and rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for the police-station," said Diva, sipping her
      delicious sherry. "That'll be your fourth call."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Third, dear," said Elizabeth, uneasily wondering what
      Georgie meant by the series of adventures. "But that would
      be premature for the present. I must search a little more
      here, for it must be somewhere. Oh, here's Paddy. Good dog!
      Come to help Auntie Mayoress to find pretty riding-whip?
      Seek it, Paddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Paddy, intelligently following Elizabeth's pointing hand,
      thought it must be a leaf of Diva's evening paper, which
      she had dropped on the floor, that Auntie Mayoress wanted.
      He pounced on it, and worried it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paddy, you fool," cried Diva. "Drop it at once. Torn to
      bits and all wet. Entirely your fault, Elizabeth." She
      rose, intensely irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must give it up for the present," she said to
      Elizabeth who was poking about among the logs in the
      wood-basket. "All most mysterious, I allow, but it's close
      on my supper-time, and that interests me more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was most reluctant to return to Benjy with the
      news that she had called for the riding-whip at the office
      of the <i>Argus</i> and had subsequently lost it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's Benjy's most cherished relic," she said. "It was
      the very riding-whip with which he smacked the tiger over
      the face, while he picked up his rifle and then shot him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a lot of legends aren't there?" said Diva menacingly.
      "And if other people get talking there may be one or two
      more, just as remarkable. And I want my supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth paused in her search. This dark saying produced
      an immediate effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too bad of me to stop so long," she said. "And thanks,
      dear, for my delicious tea. It would be kind of you if you
      had another look round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva saw her off. The disappearance of the riding-whip was
      really very strange: positively spooky. And though
      Elizabeth had been a great nuisance, she deserved credit
      and sympathy for her ingenious version of the awkward
      incident . . . She looked for the pennies which Elizabeth
      had promised to pay at once for those telephone calls, but
      there was no trace of them, and all her exasperation
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like her," she muttered. "That's the sort of thing
      that really annoys me. So mean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Janet's evening out, and after eating her supper,
      Diva returned to the tea-room for a few games of patience.
      It was growing cold; Janet had forgotten to replenish the
      wood-basket, and Diva went out to the wood-shed with an
      electric torch to fetch in a few more logs. Something
      gleamed in the light, and she picked up a silver cap, which
      seemed vaguely familiar. A fragment of chewed wood
      projected from it, and looking more closely she saw
      engraved on it the initials B. F.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Golly! It's it," whispered the awe-struck Diva. "Benjamin
      Flint, before he Mapped himself. But why here? And how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea struck her, and she called Paddy, but Paddy had no
      doubt gone out with Janet. Forgetting about fresh logs but
      with this relic in her hand, Diva returned to her room, and
      warmed herself with intellectual speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody had disposed of all the riding-whip except this
      metallic fragment. By process of elimination (for she
      acquitted Janet of having eaten it), it must be Paddy.
      Should she ring up Elizabeth and say that the riding-whip
      had been found? That would not be true, for all that had
      been found was a piece of overwhelming evidence that it
      never would be found. Besides, who could tell what
      Elizabeth had said to Benjy by this time? Possibly (even
      probably, considering what Elizabeth was) she would not
      tell him that she had retrieved it from the office of the
      <i>Argus,</i> and thus escape his just censure for having
      lost it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe," thought Diva, "that it might save developments
      which nobody can foresee, if I said nothing about it to
      anybody. Nobody knows except Paddy and me. <i>Silentio,</i>
      as Lucia says, when she's gabbling fit to talk your head
      off. Let them settle it between themselves, but nobody
      shall suspect <i>me</i> of having had anything to do with
      it. I'll bury it in the garden before Janet comes back.
      Rather glad Paddy ate it. I was tired of Major Benjy
      showing me the whip, and telling me about it over and over
      again. Couldn't be true, either. I'm killing a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of a torch and a trowel Diva put the relic
      beyond reasonable risk of discovery. This was only just
      done when Janet returned with Paddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been strolling in the garden," said Diva with chattering
      teeth. "Such a mild night. Dear Paddy! Such a clever dog."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth pondered over the mystery as she walked briskly
      home, and when she came to discuss it with Benjy after
      dinner they presently became very friendly. She reminded
      him that he had behaved like a poltroon this morning, and,
      like a loyal wife, she had shielded him from exposure by
      her ingenious explanations. She disclosed that she had
      retrieved the riding-whip from the <i>Argus</i> office, but
      had subsequently lost it at Diva's tea-rooms. A great pity,
      but it still might turn up. What they must fix firmly in
      their minds was that Benjy had gone to the office of the
      <i>Argus</i> merely to pay a polite call on Mr. McConnell,
      and that Elizabeth had never seen the monstrous caricature
      of herself in that paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's settled then," she said, "and it's far the most
      dignified course we can take. And I've been thinking about
      more important things than these paltry affairs. There's an
      election to the Town Council next month. One vacancy. I
      shall stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very wise, Liz," he said. "You tried that once, and
      came in at the bottom of the poll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that. Lucia and I polled exactly the same number of
      votes. But times have changed now. She's Mayor and I'm
      Mayoress. It's of her I'm thinking. I shall be much more
      assistance to her as a Councillor. I shall be a support to
      her at the meetings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very thoughtful of you," said Benjy. "Does she see it like
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not told her yet. I shall be firm in any case. Well,
      it's bedtime; such an exciting day! Dear me, if I didn't
      forget to pay Diva for a few telephone calls I made from
      her house. Dear Diva, and her precious economies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Diva's back garden, soon to tarnish by contact with
      the loamy soil, there lay buried, like an unspent shell
      with all its explosive potentialities intact, the silver
      cap of the vanished relic.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mayoring day arrived and Lucia, formally elected by the
      Town Council, assumed her scarlet robes. She swept them a
      beautiful curtsey and said she was their servant. She made
      a touching allusion to her dear friend the Mayoress, whose
      loyal and loving support would alone render her own immense
      responsibilities a joy to shoulder, and Elizabeth, wreathed
      in smiles, dabbed her handkerchief on the exact piece of
      her face where tears, had there been any, would have
      bedewed it. The Mayor then entertained a large party to
      lunch at the King's Arms Hotel, preceding them in state
      while church bells rang, dogs barked, cameras clicked, and
      the sun gleamed on the massive maces borne before her.
      There were cheers for Lucia led by the late Mayor and
      cheers for the Mayoress led by her present husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Lucia inaugurated Diva's tea-shop,
      incognita as Mrs. Pillson. The populace of Tilling was not
      quite so thrilled as she had expected at the prospect of
      taking its tea in the same room as the Mayor, and no one
      saw her drink the first cup of tea except Georgie and Diva,
      who kept running to the window on the look-out for
      customers. Seeing Susan in her Royce, she tapped on the
      pane, and got her to come in so that they could inaugurate
      the card-room with a rubber of Bridge. Then suddenly a
      torrent of folk invaded the tea-room and Diva had to leave
      an unfinished hand to help Janet to serve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wish they'd come sooner," she said, "to see the ceremony.
      Do wait a bit; if they ease off we can finish our game."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away. A few minutes afterwards she opened the
      door and said in a thrilling whisper, "Fourteen shilling
      ones, and two eighteen-penny's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid!" said everybody, and Susan began telling them
      about her automatic script.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sit there with my eyes shut and my pencil in my hand,"
      she said, "and Blue Birdie on the table by me. I get a sort
      of lost feeling, and then Blue Birdie seems to say 'Tweet,
      tweet', and I say 'Good morning, dear'. Then my pencil
      begins to move. I never know what it writes. A queer,
      scrawling hand, not a bit like mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Diva's face beamed redly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still twelve shilling ones," she said, "though six of the
      first lot have gone. Two more eighteen-penny, but the cream
      is getting low, and Janet's had to add milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where had I got to?" said Susan. "Oh, yes. It goes on
      writing till Blue Birdie seems to say 'Tweet, tweet' again,
      and that means it's finished and I say 'Good-bye, dear'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of things does it write?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All sorts. This morning it kept writing <i>mère</i> over
      and over again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very strange," said Lucia eagerly. "Very. I expect
      Blue Birdie wants to say something to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Susan. "Not your sort of Mayor. The French word
      <i>mère,</i> just as if Blue Birdie said 'Mummie'. Speaking
      to me evidently."
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not seem to interest Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And anything of value?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all of value," said Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight crash sounded from the tea-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a tea-cup," said Diva, looking in again. Rather like
      breaking a bottle of wine when you launch a ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like me to show myself for a minute?" asked
      Lucia. "I will gladly walk through the room if it would
      help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So good of you, but I don't want any help except in
      handling things. Besides, I told the reporter of the
      <i>Argus</i> that you had had your tea, and were playing
      cards in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not quite wise, Diva," said Lucia. "Tell him I wasn't
      playing for money. Think of the example."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid he's gone," said Diva. "Besides, it wouldn't be
      true. Two of your Councillors here just now. Shillings.
      Didn't charge them. Advertisement."
    </p>
    <p>
      The press of customers eased off, and, leaving Janet to
      deal with the remainder, Diva joined them, clinking a bag
      of bullion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots of tips," she said. "I never reckoned on that. Mostly
      twopences, but they'll add up. I must just count the
      takings, and then let's finish the rubber."
    </p>
    <p>
      The takings exceeded all expectation; quite a pile of
      silver; a pyramid of copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you do with all that money now the banks are
      closed?" asked Georgie lightly. "Such a sum to have in the
      house. I should bury it in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva's hand gave an involuntary twitch as she swept the
      coppers into a bag. Odd that he should say that! "Safe
      enough," she replied. "Paddy sleeps in my room, now that I
      know he hasn't got mange."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayoral banquet followed in the evening. Unfortunately,
      neither the Lord Lieutenant nor the Bishop nor the Member
      of Parliament were able to attend, but they sent charming
      letters of regret, which Lucia read before her Chaplain,
      the Padre, said Grace. She wore her mayoral chain of office
      round her neck, and her chain of inherited seed-pearls in
      her hair, and Georgie, as arranged, sat alone on the other
      side of the table directly opposite her. He was
      disadvantageously placed with regard to supplies of food
      and drink, for the waiter had to go round the far end of
      the side-tables to get at him, but he took extra large
      helpings when he got the chance, and had all his
      wine-glasses filled. He wore on the lapel of his coat a
      fine green and white enamel star, which had long lain among
      his <i>bibelots,</i> and which looked like a foreign order.
      At the far end of the room was a gallery, from which
      ladies, as if in purdah, were allowed to look on. Elizabeth
      sat in the front row, and waggled her hand at the Mayor,
      whenever Lucia looked in her direction, in order to
      encourage her. Once, when a waiter was standing just behind
      Lucia, Elizabeth felt sure that she had caught her eye, and
      kissed her hand to her. The waiter promptly responded, and
      the Mayoress, blushing prettily, ceased to signal. . . .
      There were flowery speeches made and healths drunk, and
      afterwards a musical entertainment. The Mayor created a
      precedent by contributing to this herself and giving (as
      the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> recorded in its next issue) an
      exquisite rendering on the piano of the slow movement of
      Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. It produced a somewhat
      pensive effect, and she went back to her presiding place
      again amid respectful applause and a shrill, solitary cry
      of "Encore!" from Elizabeth. The spirits of her guests
      revived under the spell of lighter melodies, and at the end
      Auld Lang Syne was sung with crossed hands by all the
      company, with the exception of Georgie, who had no
      neighbours. Lucia swept regal curtsies to right and left,
      and a loop of the seed pearls in her hair got loose and
      oscillated in front of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayor and her Prince Consort drove back to Mallards,
      Lucia strung up to the highest pitch of triumph, Georgie
      intensely fatigued. She put him through a catechism of
      self-glorification in the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I gave them a good dinner," she said. "And the
      wine was excellent, wasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirable," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my speech. Not too long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. Exactly right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought they drank my health very warmly. <i>Non e
      vero?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very. <i>Molto,</i>" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia struck a chord on the piano before she closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I take the Moonlight a little too quick?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I never heard you play it better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt the enthusiasm tingling round me," she said. "In
      the days of horse-drawn vehicles, I am sure they would have
      taken my horses out of the shafts and pulled us up home.
      But impossible with a motor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They might have taken out the carburetter," he said
      wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at some papers on her table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be up early to-morrow," she said, "to be ready for
      Mrs. Simpson. . . . A new era, Georgie. I seem to see a new
      era for our dear Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c04"
          id="c04">CHAPTER IV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not find her new duties quite as onerous as she
      expected, but she made them as onerous as she could. She
      pored over plans for new houses which the Corporation was
      building, and having once grasped the difference between
      section and elevation was full of ideas for tasteful
      weathercocks, lightning conductors and balconies. With her
      previous experience in Stock Exchange transactions to help
      her, she went deeply into questions of finance and hit on a
      scheme of borrowing money at three and a half per cent. for
      a heavy outlay for the renewal of drains, and investing it
      in some thoroughly sound concern that brought in four and a
      half per cent. She explained this masterpiece to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say we borrow ten thousand pounds at three and a half,"
      she said, "the interest on that will be three hundred and
      fifty pounds a year. We invest it, Georgie,--follow me
      closely here--at four and a half, and it brings us in four
      hundred and fifty pounds a year. A clear gain of one
      hundred pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That does seem brilliant," said Georgie. "But wait a
      moment. If you re-invest what you borrow, how do you pay
      for the work on your drains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's face grew corrugated with thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see what you're driving at, Georgie," she said slowly.
      "Very acute of you. I must consider that further before I
      bring my scheme before the Finance Committee. But in my
      belief--of course this is strictly private--the work on the
      drains is not so very urgent. We might put it off for six
      months, and in the meantime reap our larger dividends. I'm
      sure there's something to be done on those lines."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Then with a view to investigating the lighting of the
      streets, she took Georgie out for walks after dinner on
      dark and even rainy evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This corner now," she said as the rain poured down on her
      umbrella. "A most insufficient illumination. I should never
      forgive myself if some elderly person tripped up here in
      the dark and stunned himself. He might remain undiscovered
      for hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," said Georgie, "But this is very cold-catching.
      Let's get home. No elderly person will come out on such a
      night. Madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a little wet," said Lucia, who never caught cold.
      "I'll go to look at that alley by Bumpus's buildings
      another night, for there's a memorandum on Town Development
      plans waiting for me, which I haven't mastered. Something
      about residential zones and industrial zones, Georgie. I
      mustn't permit a manufactory to be opened in a residential
      zone: for instance, I could never set up a brewery or a
      blacksmith's forge in the garden at Mallards--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you don't want to, do you?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The principle, dear, is the interesting thing. At first
      sight it looks rather like a curtailment of the liberty of
      the individual, but if you look, as I am learning to do,
      below the surface, you will perceive that a blacksmith's
      forge in the middle of the lawn would detract from the
      tranquillity of adjoining residences. It would injure their
      amenities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie plodded beside her, wishing Lucia was not so
      excruciatingly didactic, but trying between sneezes to be a
      good husband to the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mayn't you reside in an industrial zone?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I must look into. I should myself certainly permit a
      shoe-maker to live above his shop. Then there's the general
      business zone. I trust that Diva's tea-rooms in the High
      Street are in order: it would be sad for her if I had to
      tell her to close them . . . Ah, our comfortable
      garden-room again! You were asking just now about residence
      in an industrial zone. I think I have some papers here
      which will tell you that. And there's a coloured map of
      zones somewhere, green for industrial, blue for residential
      and yellow for general business, which would fascinate you.
      Where is it now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother about it to-night," said Georgie. "I can
      easily wait till to-morrow. What about some music? There's
      that Scarlatti duet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ah, divino Scarlattino!"</i> said Lucia absently, as
      she turned over her papers. "Eureka! Here it is! No, that's
      about slums, but also very interesting . . . What's a
      'messuage'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably a misprint for message," said he. "Or massage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, neither makes sense: I must put a query to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sat down at the piano, and played a few fragments
      of remembered tunes. Lucia continued reading: it was rather
      difficult to understand, and the noise distracted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious tunes," she said, "but would it be very selfish
      of me, dear, to ask you to stop while I'm tackling this? So
      important that I should have it at my fingers' ends before
      the next meeting, and be able to explain it. Ah, I see . .
      . no, that's green. Industrial. But in half an hour or
      so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie closed the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall go to bed," he said. "I may have caught
      cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now I see," cried Lucia triumphantly. "You can reside
      in any zone. That is only fair: why should a chemist in the
      High Street be forced to live half a mile away? And very
      clearly put. I could not have expressed it better myself.
      Good-night, dear. A few drops of camphor on a lump of
      sugar. Sleep well."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayoress was as zealous as the Mayor. She rang Lucia up
      at breakfast time every morning, and wished to speak to her
      personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything I can do for you, dear Worship?" she asked.
      "Always at your service, as I needn't remind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever, thanks," answered Lucia. "I've a Council
      meeting this afternoon--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No points you'd like to talk over with me? Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," said Lucia firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are one or two bits of things I should like to bring
      to your notice," said the baffled Elizabeth, "for of course
      you can't keep in touch with everything. I'll pop in at one
      for a few minutes and chance finding you disengaged. And a
      bit of news."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia went back to her congealed bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's got quite a wrong notion of the duties of a
      Mayoress, Georgie," she said. "I wish she would understand
      that if I want her help I shall ask for it. She has nothing
      to do with my official duties, and as she's not on the Town
      Council, she can't dip her oar very deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's hoping to run you," said Georgie. "She hopes to have
      her finger in every pie. She will if she can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have got to be very tactful," said Lucia thoughtfully.
      "You see the only object of my making her Mayoress was to
      dope her malignant propensities, and if I deal with her too
      rigorously I should merely stimulate them . . . Ah, we must
      begin our régime of plain living. Let us go and do our
      marketing at once, and then I can study the <i>agenda</i>
      for this afternoon before Elizabeth arrives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth had some assorted jobs for Worship to attend to.
      Worship ought to know that a car had come roaring down the
      hill into Tilling yesterday at so terrific a pace that she
      hadn't time to see the number. A van and Susan's Royce had
      caused a complete stoppage of traffic in the High Street;
      anyone with only a few minutes to spare to catch a train
      must have missed it. "And far worse was a dog that howled
      all last night outside the house next Grebe," said
      Elizabeth. "Couldn't sleep a wink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't stop it," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? I should have thought some threatening notice might be
      served on the owner. Or shall I write a letter to the
      <i>Argus,</i> which we both might sign. More weight. Or I
      would write a personal note to you which you might read to
      the Council. Whichever you like, Worship. You to choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not find any of these alternatives attractive,
      but made a business-like note of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most valuable suggestions," she said. "But I don't feel
      that I could move officially about the dog. It might be a
      cat next, or a canary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was gazing out of the window with that kind,
      meditative smile which so often betokened some atrocious
      train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just little efforts of mine, dear Worship, to enlarge your
      sphere of influence," she said. "Soon, perhaps, I may be
      able to support you more directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt a qualm of sickening apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be lovely," she said. "But how, dear Elizabeth,
      could you do more than you are doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth focused her kind smile on dear Worship's face. A
      close up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess, dear!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, there's a vacancy in the Borough Council, and
      I'm standing for it. Oh, if I got in! At hand to support
      you in all your Council meetings. You and me! Just think!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made one desperate attempt to avert this appalling
      prospect, and began to gabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be wonderful," she said, "and how well I know
      that it's your devotion to me that prompts you. How I value
      that! But somehow it seems to me that your influence, your
      tremendous influence, would be lessened rather than the
      reverse, if you became just one out of my twelve
      Councillors. Your unique position as Mayoress would suffer.
      Tilling would think of you as one of a body. You, my right
      hand, would lose your independence. And then, unlikely,
      even impossible as it sounds, supposing you were not
      elected? A ruinous loss of prestige--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunch," she said, and left the door of the garden-room
      wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sprang up with a shrill cry of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No idea it was lunch-time," she cried. "How naughty of me
      not to have kept my eye on the clock, but time passed so
      quickly, as it always does, dear, when I'm talking to you.
      But you haven't convinced me; far from it. I must fly;
      Benjy will call me a naughty girl for being so late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia remembered that the era of plain living had begun.
      Hashed mutton and treacle pudding. Perhaps Elizabeth might
      go away if she knew that. On the other hand, Elizabeth had
      certainly come here at one o'clock in order to be asked to
      lunch, and it would be wiser to ask her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring him up and say you're lunching here," she decided.
      "Do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth recollected that she had ordered hashed beef and
      marmalade pudding at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I consider that a command, dear Worship," she said. "May I
      use your telephone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All these afflictions strongly reacted on Georgie. Mutton
      and Mapp and incessant conversation about municipal affairs
      were making home far less comfortable than he had a right
      to expect. Then Lucia sprang another conscientious surprise
      on him, when she returned that afternoon positively
      invigorated by a long Council meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to consult you, Georgie," she said. "Ever since the
      <i>Hampshire Argus</i> reported that I played Bridge in
      Diva's card-room, the whole question has been on my mind. I
      don't think I ought to play for money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't call threepence a hundred money," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a large sum, but emphatically it <i>is</i>
      money. It's the principle of the thing. A very sad
      case--all this is very private--has just come to my notice.
      Young Twistevant, the grocer's son, has been backing
      horses, and is in debt with his last quarter's rent unpaid.
      Lately married and a baby coming. All the result of
      gambling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how the baby is the result of gambling," said
      Georgie. "Unless he bet he wouldn't have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave the wintry smile that was reserved for jokes she
      didn't care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expressed myself badly," she said. "I only meant that
      his want of money, when he will need it more than ever, is
      the result of gambling. The principle is the same whether
      it's threepence or a starving baby. And Bridge surely, with
      its call both on prudence and enterprise, is a sufficiently
      good game to play for love: for love of Bridge. Let us set
      an example. When we have our next Bridge party, let it be
      understood that there are no stakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you'll get many Bridge parties if that's
      understood," said Georgie. "Everyone will go seven no
      trumps at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they'll be doubled," cried Lucia triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And redoubled. It wouldn't be any fun. Most monotonous.
      The dealer might as well pick up his hand and say Seven
      no-trumps, doubled and redoubled, before he looked at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope we take a more intelligent interest in the game
      than <i>that,"</i> said Lucia. "The judgment in declaring,
      the skill in the play of the cards, the various systems so
      carefully thought out--surely we shan't cease to practise
      them just because a few pence are no longer at stake?
      Indeed, I think we shall have far pleasanter games. They
      will be more tranquil, and on a loftier level. The question
      of even a few pence sometimes produces acrimony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't agree," said Georgie. "Those acrimonies are the
      result of pleasant excitement. And what's the use of
      keeping the score, and wondering if you dare finesse, if it
      leads to nothing? You might try playing for twopence a
      hundred instead of threepence--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must repeat that it's the principle," interrupted Lucia.
      "I feel that in my position it ought to be known that
      though I play cards, which I regard as quite a reasonable
      relaxation, I no longer play for money. I feel sure we
      should find it just as exciting. Let us put it to the test.
      I will ask the Padre and Evie to dine and play to-morrow,
      and we'll see how it goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't go. Lucia made the depressing announcement during
      dinner, and a gloom fell on the party as they cut for
      partners. For brief bright moments one or other of them
      forgot that there was nothing to be gained by astuteness
      except the consciousness of having been clever, but then he
      (or she) remembered, and the gleam faded. Only Lucia
      remained keen and critical. She tried with agonised anxiety
      to recollect if there was another trump in and decided
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too stupid of me, Padre," she said. "I ought to have
      known. I should have drawn it, and then we made our
      contract. Quite inexcusable. Many apologies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, it's no matter; it's no matter whatever," he said.
      "Just nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the adding-up. Georgie had not kept the score and
      everyone accepted Lucia's addition without a murmur. At
      half past ten instead of eleven, it was agreed that it was
      wiser not to begin another rubber, and Georgie saw the
      languid guests to the door. He came back to find Lucia
      replaying the last hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could have got another trick, dear," she said. "Look;
      you should have discarded instead of trumping. A most
      interesting man&oelig;uvre. As to our test, I think they
      were both quite as keen as ever, and for myself I never had
      a more enjoyable game."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this depressing evening spread apace through
      Tilling, and a small party assembled next day at Diva's for
      shilling teas and discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I winna play for nowt," said the Padre. "Such a mirthless
      evening I never spent. And by no means a well-furnished
      table at dinner. An unusual parsimony.''
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth chimed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got hashed mutton and treacle pudding for lunch a few
      days ago," she said. "Just what I should have had at home
      except that it was beef and marmalade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you happened to look in a few minutes before
      unexpectedly," suggested Diva who was handing crumpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a nasty sort of innuendo about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got any cream, dear," retorted Elizabeth. "Would
      you kindly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll be an eighteen-penny tea then," Diva warned her,
      "though you'll get potted meat sandwiches as well. Shall it
      be eighteen-pence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth ignored the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for playing bridge for nothing," she resumed, "I won't.
      I've never played it before, and I'm too old to learn now.
      Dear Worship, of course, may do as she likes, so long as
      she doesn't do it with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva finished her serving and sat down with her customers.
      Janet brought her cream and potted-meat sandwiches, for of
      course she could eat what she liked, without choosing
      between a shilling and an eighteen-penny tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Makes it all so awkward," she said. "If one of us gives a
      Bridge-party, must the table at which Lucia plays do it for
      nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other table, too, I expect," said Elizabeth bitterly,
      watching Diva pouring quantities of cream into her tea.
      "Worship mightn't like to know that gambling was going on
      in her presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I won't submit to," cried Evie. "I won't, I won't.
      She may be Mayor but she isn't Mussolini."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see nought for it," said the Padre, "but not to ask her.
      I play my Bridge for diversion and it doesna' divert me to
      exert my mind over the cards and not a bawbee or the loss
      if it to show for all my trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other customers came in; the room filled up and Diva had to
      get busy again. The office boy from the <i>Hampshire
      Argus</i> and a friend had a good blow-out, and ate an
      entire pot of jam, which left little profit on their teas.
      On the other hand, Evie and the Padre and Elizabeth were so
      concerned about the Bridge crisis that they hardly ate
      anything. Diva presented them with their bills, and they
      each gave her a tip of twopence, which was quite decent for
      a shilling tea, but the office boy and his friend, in the
      bliss of repletion, gave her threepence. Diva thanked them
      warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie and the Padre continued the subject on the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such hard luck on Mr. Georgie," she said. "He's as bored
      as anybody with playing for love. I saw him yawn six times
      the other night and he never added up. I think I'll ask him
      to a Bridge-tea at Diva's, just to see if he'll come
      without Lucia. Diva would be glad to play with us
      afterwards, but it would never do to ask her to tea first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" asked the Padre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why she would be making a profit by being our guest. And
      how could we tip her for four teas, when she had had one of
      them herself? Very awkward for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A'weel, then let her get her own tea," said the Padre,
      "though I don't think she's as delicate of feeling as all
      that. But ask the puir laddie by all means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was duly rung up and a slightly embarrassing moment
      followed. Evie thought she had said with sufficient
      emphasis "So pleased if <i>you</i> will come to Diva's
      tomorrow for tea and Bridge," but he asked her to hold on
      while he saw if Lucia was free. Then Evie had to explain it
      didn't matter whether Lucia was free or not, and Georgie
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt sure it would happen," he said to himself, "but I
      think I shan't tell Lucia. Very likely she'll be busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vain was the hope of man. As they were moderately enjoying
      their frugal lunch next day, Lucia congratulated herself on
      having a free afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively nothing to do," she said. "Not a committee to
      attend, nothing. Let us have one of our good walks, and pop
      in to have tea with Diva afterwards. I want to encourage
      her enterprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A walk would be lovely," said Georgie, "but Evie asked me
      to have tea at Diva's and play a rubber afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember her asking me," said Lucia. "Does she
      expect me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather think Diva's making our fourth," faltered
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia expressed strong approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very sensible innovation," she said. "I remember telling
      you that it struck me as rather <i>bourgeois,</i> rather
      Victorian, always to have husbands and wives together. No
      doubt also, dear Evie felt sure I should be busy up till
      dinner-time. Really very considerate of her, not to give me
      the pain of refusing. How I shall enjoy a quiet hour with a
      book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't like it at all the same," thought Georgie, as,
      rather fatigued with a six mile tramp in a thick sea mist,
      he tripped down the hill to Diva's, "and I shouldn't wonder
      if she guessed the reason . . ." The tea-room was crowded,
      so that Diva could not have had tea with them even if she
      had been asked. She presented the bill to Evie herself
      (three eighteenpenny teas) and received the generous tip of
      fourpence a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear Evie," she said pocketing the extra
      shilling. "I do call that handsome. I'll join you in the
      card-room as soon as ever I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had most exciting games at the usual stakes. It was
      impossible to leave the last rubber unfinished, and Georgie
      had to hurry over his dressing not to keep Lucia waiting.
      Her eye had that gimlet-like aspect, which betokened a
      thirst for knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good tea and a pleasant rubber?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both," said Georgie. "I enjoyed myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So glad. And many people having tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crammed. Diva couldn't join us till close on six."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How pleasant for Diva. And did you play for stakes, dear,
      or for nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stakes," said Georgie. "The usual threepence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I'm going to ask a favour of you," she said. "I
      want you to set an example--poor young Twistervant, you
      know--I want it to be widely known that I do not play cards
      for money. You diminish the force of my example, dear, if
      you continue to do so. The lime-light is partially, at any
      rate, on you as well as me. I ask you not to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I can't consent," said Georgie. "I don't see
      any harm in it--Naturally you will do as you like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to thank me. And I shall do as I like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Silentio!"</i> whispered Lucia. "Yes, Grosvenor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Mapp-Flint has rung up"--began Grosvenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her I can't attend to any business this evening,"
      said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She doesn't want you to, ma'am. She only wants to know if
      Mr. Pillson will dine with her the day after tomorrow and
      play Bridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank her," said Georgie firmly. "Delighted."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Card-playing circles in Tilling remained firm: there was no
      slump. If, in view of her exemplary position, Worship
      declined to play Bridge for money, far be it from us, said
      Tilling, to seek to persuade her against the light of
      conscience. But if Worship imagined that Tilling intended
      to follow her example, the sooner she got rid of that fond
      illusion the better. Lucia sent out invitations for another
      Bridge party at Mallards but everybody was engaged. She
      could not miss the significance of that, but she put up a
      proud front and sent for the latest book on Bridge and
      studied it incessantly, almost to the neglect of her
      Mayoral Duties, in order to prove that what she cared for
      was the game in itself. Her grasp of it, she declared,
      improved out of all knowledge, but she got no opportunities
      of demonstrating that agreeable fact. Invitations rained on
      Georgie, for it was clearly unfair that he should get no
      Bridge because nobody would play with the Mayor, and he
      returned these hospitalities by asking his friends to have
      tea with him at Diva's rooms, with a rubber afterwards, for
      he could not ask three gamblers to dinner and leave Lucia
      to study Bridge problems by herself, while the rest of the
      party played. Other entertainers followed his example, for
      it was far less trouble to order tea at Diva's and find the
      card-room ready, and as Algernon Wyse expressed it, 'ye
      olde tea-house' became quite like Almack's. This was good
      business for the establishment, and Diva bitterly regretted
      that it had not occurred to her from the first to charge
      card-money. She put the question one day to Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All those markers being used up so fast," she said, "and I
      shall have to get new cards so much oftener than I
      expected. Twopence, say, for card-money, don't you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't dream of it, dear," said Elizabeth very
      decidedly. "You must be doing very well as it is. But I
      should recommend some fresh packs of cards. A little
      greasy, when last I played. More daintiness, clean cards,
      sharp pencils and so on are well worth while. But
      card-money, no!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of the election to the vacancy on the Town
      Council diverted the Mayor's mind from her abstract study
      of Bridge. Up to within a few days of the date on which
      candidates' names must be sent in, Elizabeth was still the
      only aspirant. Lucia found herself faced by the prospect of
      her Mayoress being inevitably elected, and the thought of
      that filled her with the gloomiest apprehensions. She
      wondered if Georgie could be induced to stand. It was his
      morning for cleaning his <i>bibelots,</i> and she went up
      to his room with offers of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I so often wish, dear," she said pensively, attacking a
      snuff-box, "that you were more closely connected with me in
      my municipal work. And such an opportunity offers itself
      just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do be careful with that snuff-box," said he. "Don't rub it
      hard. What's this opportunity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Town Council. There's a vacancy very soon. I'm
      convinced, dear, that with a little training, such as I
      could give you, you would make a marvellous Councillor, and
      you would find the work most absorbing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it would bore me stiff," he said. "I'm no good at
      slums and drains."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia decided to disclose herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, it's to help me," she said. "Elizabeth at present
      is the only candidate, and the idea of having her on the
      Council is intolerable. And with the prestige of your being
      my husband I don't doubt the result. Just a few days of
      canvassing; you with your keen interest in human nature
      will revel in it. It is a duty, it seems to me, that you
      owe to yourself. You would have an official position in the
      town. I have long felt it an anomaly that the Mayor's
      husband had none."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie considered. He had before now thought it would be
      pleasant to walk in Mayoral processions in a purple gown.
      And bored though he was with Lucia's municipal gabble, it
      would be different when, with the weight of his position to
      back him, he could say that he totally disagreed with her
      on some matter of policy, and perhaps defeat some project
      of hers at a Council Meeting. Also, it would be a pleasure
      to defeat Elizabeth at the poll . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you'll help me with the canvassing--" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if I only could!" she said. "But, dear, my position
      precludes me from taking any active part. It is analogous
      to that of the King, who, officially, is outside politics.
      The fact that you are my husband--what a blessed day was
      that when our lives were joined--will carry immense weight.
      Everyone will know that your candidature has my full
      approval. I shouldn't wonder if Elizabeth withdrew when she
      learns you are standing against her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," said he. "But you must coach me on what my
      programme is to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear, a thousand times! You must send in your
      name at once. Mrs. Simpson will get you a form to fill up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several horrid days ensued and Georgie wended his dripping
      way from house to house in the most atrocious weather. His
      ticket was better housing for the poorer classes, and he
      called at rows of depressing dwellings, promising to devote
      his best energies to procuring the tenants bath-rooms,
      plumbing, bicycle-sheds and open spaces for their children
      to play in. A disagreeable sense oppressed him that the
      mothers, whose household jobs he was interrupting, were
      much bored with his visits, and took very little interest
      in his protestations. In reward for these distasteful
      exertions Lucia relaxed the Spartan commissariat--indeed,
      she disliked it very much herself and occasionally wondered
      if her example was being either followed or respected--and
      she gave him Lucullan lunches and dinners. Elizabeth, of
      course, at once got wind of his candidature and canvassing,
      but instead of withdrawing, she started a hurricane
      campaign of her own. Her ticket was the reduction of rates,
      instead of this rise in them which these idiotic schemes
      for useless luxuries would inevitably produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the election was to be announced by the Mayor
      from the steps of the Town Hall. Owing to the howling gale,
      and the torrents of rain the street outside was absolutely
      empty save for the figure of Major Benjy clad in a
      sou'wester hat, a mackintosh and waders, crouching in the
      most sheltered corner he could find beneath a dripping
      umbrella. Elizabeth had had hard work to induce him to come
      at all: he professed himself perfectly content to curb his
      suspense in comfort at home by the fire till she returned
      with the news, and all the other inhabitants of Tilling
      felt they could wait till next morning . . . Then Lucia
      emerged from the Town Hall with a candidate on each side of
      her, and in a piercing scream, to make her voice heard in
      this din of the elements, she announced the appalling
      figures. Mrs. Elizabeth Mapp-Flint, she yelled, had polled
      eight hundred and five votes, and was therefore elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy uttered a hoarse "Hurrah!" and trying to clap
      his hands let go of his umbrella which soared into the gale
      and was seen no more. . . . Mr. George Pillson, screamed
      Lucia, had polled four hundred and twenty-one votes.
      Elizabeth, at the top of her voice, then warmly thanked the
      burgesses of Tilling for the confidence which they had
      placed in her, and which she would do her best to deserve.
      She shook hands with the Mayor and the defeated candidate,
      and instantly drove away with her husband. As there were no
      other burgesses to address Georgie did not deliver the
      speech which he had prepared: indeed it would have been
      quite unsuitable, since he had intended to thank the
      burgesses of Tilling in similar terms. He and Lucia
      scurried to their car, and Georgie put up the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most mortifying," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you did your best," said Lucia, pressing his arm
      with a wet but sympathetic hand. "In public life, one has
      to take these little reverses--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most humiliating," interrupted Georgie. "All that trouble
      thrown away. Being triumphed over by Elizabeth when you led
      me to expect quite the opposite. She'll be far more swanky
      now than if I hadn't put up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Georgie, there I can't agree," said Lucia. "If there
      had been no other candidate, she would have said that
      nobody felt he had the slightest chance against her. That
      would have been much worse. Anyhow she knows now that four
      hundred and--what was the figure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four hundred and twenty-one," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, four hundred and twenty-one thoughtful voters in
      Tilling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "--against eight hundred and five thoughtless ones," said
      Georgie. "Don't let's talk any more about it. It's a loss
      of prestige for both of us. No getting out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia hurried indoors to tell Grosvenor to bring up a
      bottle of champagne for dinner, and to put on to the fire
      the pretty wreath of laurel leaves which she had privily
      stitched together for the coronation of her new Town
      Councillor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that nasty smell of burning evergreen?" asked
      Georgie morosely, as they went into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the opinion of friends the loss of prestige had been
      entirely Lucia's. Georgie would never have stood for the
      Council unless she had urged him, and it was a nasty defeat
      which, it was hoped, might do the Mayor good. But the
      Mayoress's victory, it was feared, would have the worst
      effect on her character. She and Diva met next morning in
      the pouring rain to do their shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very disagreeable for poor Worship," said Elizabeth, "and
      not very friendly to me to put up another candidate--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rubbish," said Diva. "She's made you Mayoress. Quite
      enough friendliness for one year, I should have thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it was out of friendliness that I accepted. I wanted
      to be of use to her, and stood for the Council for the same
      reason--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only she thought Mr. Georgie would be of more use than
      you," interrupted Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody in her pocket--Take care, Diva. Susan's van."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Royce drew up close to them, and Susan's face loomed in
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Elizabeth," she said. "I've just heard--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, dear, for your congratulations," said Elizabeth.
      "But quite a walk-over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan's face shewed no sign of comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you walk over?" she asked. "In this rain,
      too?--Oh, the election to the Town Council. How nice for
      you! When are you going to reduce the rates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrill whistle, and Irene's huge red umbrella joined the
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo, Mapp!" she said. "So you've got on the map again.
      Ha, ha! How dare you stand against Georgie when my Angel
      wanted him to get in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene's awful tongue always deflated Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear quaint one!" she said. "What a lovely umbrella."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that. But how dare you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was stung into sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we don't all of us think that your Angel must always
      have her way, dear," she replied, "and that we must lie
      down flat for her to trample us into the mire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she raised you out of the mire, woman," cried Irene,
      "when she made you Mayoress. She took pity on your
      fruitless efforts to become somebody. Wait till you see my
      fresco."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was sorry she had been so courageous!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Painting a pretty fresco, dear?" she asked. "How I shall
      look forward to seeing it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a disappointment to you," said Irene. "Do you
      remember posing for me on the day Lucia made you Mayoress?
      It came out in the <i>Hampshire Argus.</i> Well, it's going
      to come out again in my fresco. Standing on an oyster shell
      with Benjy blowing you along. Wait and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no brawl for an M.B.E. to be mixed up in, and
      Susan called "Home!" to her chauffeur, and shut the window.
      Even Diva thought she had better move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bye-bye," she said. "Must get back to my baking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth turned on her with a frightful grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wise," she said. "If you had got back earlier to your
      baking yesterday, we should have enjoyed your jam-puffs
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's too much!" cried Diva. "You ate three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And bitterly repented it," said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene hooted with laughter and went on down the street.
      Diva crossed it, and Elizabeth stayed where she was for a
      moment to recover her poise. Why did Irene always cause her
      to feel like a rabbit with a stoat in pursuit? She
      bewildered and disintegrated her; she drained her of all
      power of invective and retort. She could face Diva, and had
      just done so with signal success, but she was no good
      against Irene. She plodded home through the driving rain,
      menaced by the thought of that snap-shot being revived
      again in fresco.

    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody was more conscious of this loss of prestige than
      Lucia herself, and there were losses in other directions as
      well. She had hoped that her renunciation of gambling would
      have induced card-playing circles to follow her example.
      That hope was frustrated; bridge-parties with the usual
      stakes were as numerous as ever, but she was not asked to
      them. Another worry was that the humiliating election
      rankled in Georgie's mind and her seeking his advice on
      municipal questions, which was intended to show him how
      much she relied on his judgment, left him unflattered. When
      they sat after dinner in the garden-room (where, alas, no
      eager gamblers now found the hours pass only too quickly)
      her lucid exposition of some administrative point failed to
      rouse any real enthusiasm in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if everything isn't quite clear," she said, "mind you
      interrupt me, and I'll go over it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      But no interruption ever came; occasionally she thought she
      observed that slight elongation of the face that betokens a
      suppressed yawn, and at the end, as likely as not, he made
      some comment which shewed he had not listened to a word she
      was saying. To-night, she was not sorry he asked no
      questions about the contentious conduct of the catchment
      board, as she was not very clear about it herself. She
      became less municipal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How these subjects get between one and the lighter side of
      life!" she said. "Any news to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that turn-up between Diva and Elizabeth," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, you never told me! What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I began to tell you at dinner," said Georgie, "only you
      changed the subject to the water-rate. It started with
      jam-puffs. Elizabeth ate three one afternoon at Diva's, and
      said next morning that she bitterly repented it. Diva says
      she'll never serve her a tea again, until she apologizes,
      but I don't suppose she means it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me more!" said Lucia, feeling the old familiar
      glamour stealing over her. "And how is her tea-shop getting
      on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flourishing. The most popular house in Tilling. All so
      pleasant and chatty, and a rubber after tea on most days.
      Quite a centre."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia wrestled with herself for an intense moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a point on which I much want your advice," she
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, I don't think I can hope to understand any
      more municipal affairs to-night," said Georgie firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not that sort, dear," she said, wondering how to
      express herself in a lofty manner. "It is this: You know
      how I refused to play Bridge any more for money. I've been
      thinking deeply over that decision. Deeply. It was meant to
      set an example, but if nobody follows an example, Georgie,
      one has to consider the wisdom of continuing to set it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always thought you'd soon find it very tar'some not to
      get your Bridge," said Georgie. "You used to enjoy it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it's not <i>that,"</i> said Lucia, speaking in her
      best Oxford voice. "I would willingly never see a card
      again if that was all, and indeed the abstract study of the
      game interests me far more. But I did find a certain value
      in our little Bridge-parties quite apart from cards. Very
      suggestive discussions, sometimes about local affairs, and
      now more than ever it is so important for me to be in touch
      with the social as well as the municipal atmosphere of the
      place. I regret that others have not followed my example,
      for I am sure our games would have been as thrilling as
      ever, but if others won't come into line with me, I will
      gladly step back into the ranks again. Nobody shall be able
      to say of me that I caused splits and dissensions. 'One and
      all', as you know, is my favourite motto."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie didn't know anything of the sort, but he let it
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital!" he said. "Everybody will be very glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it would give me great pleasure to reconcile that
      childish quarrel between Diva and Elizabeth," continued
      Lucia. "I'll ask Elizabeth and Benjy to have tea with us
      there to-morrow; dear Diva will not refuse to serve a guest
      of <i>mine,</i> and their little disagreement will be
      smoothed over. A rubber afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie looked doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you had better tell them that you will play for
      the usual stakes," he said. "Else they might say they were
      engaged again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, with her vivid imagination, visualised the horrid
      superior grin which, at the other end of the telephone,
      would spread over Elizabeth's face, when she heard that,
      and felt that she would scarcely be able to get the words
      out. But she steeled herself and went to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth and Benjy accepted, and, after a reconciliatory
      eighteen-penny tea, at which Elizabeth ate jam puffs with
      gusto ("Dear Diva, what delicious, light pastry," she said.
      "I wonder it doesn't fly away") the four retired into the
      card-room. As if to welcome Lucia back into gambling
      circles, the God of Chance provided most exciting games.
      There were slams declared and won, there was doubling and
      redoubling and rewards and vengeances. Suddenly Diva looked
      in with a teapot in her hand and a most anxious expression
      on her face. She closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Inspector of Police wants to see you, Lucia," she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose, white to the lips. In a flash there came back
      to her all her misgivings about the legality of Diva's
      permitting gambling in a public room, and now the police
      were raiding it. She pictured headlines in the <i>Hampshire
      Argus</i> and lurid paragraphs. . . . Raid on Mrs. Godiva
      Plaistow's gaming rooms . . . The list of the gamblers
      caught there. The Mayor and Mayoress of Tilling . . . A
      retired Major. The Mayor's husband. The case brought before
      the Tilling magistrates with the Mayor in the dock instead
      of on the Bench. Exemplary fines. Her own resignation.
      Eternal infamy. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he ask for me personally?" said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Knew that you were here," wailed Diva. "And my
      tea-shop will be closed. Oh, dear me, if I'd only heeded
      your warning about raids! Or if we'd only joined you in
      playing Bridge for nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose to the topmost peak of magnanimity, and
      refrained from rubbing that in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there a back way out, Diva?" she asked. "Then they
      could all go. I shall remain and receive my Inspector here.
      Just sitting here. Quietly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's no back way out," said Diva. "And you can't
      get out of the window. Too small."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hide the cards!" commanded Lucia, and they all snatched up
      their hands. Georgie put his in his breast-pocket. Benjy
      put his on the top of the large cupboard. Elizabeth sat on
      hers. Lucia thrust hers up the sleeve of her jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask him to come in," she said. "Now all talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and the Inspector stood majestically there
      with a blue paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, as you say, Major Mapp-Flint," said Lucia in an
      unwavering Oxford voice, "the League of Nations has
      collapsed like a card-house--I should say a ruin--Yes,
      Inspector, did you want me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Worship. I called at Mallards, and was told I
      should catch you here. There's a summons that needs your
      signature. I hope your Worship will excuse my coming, but
      it's urgent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, Inspector," said Lucia. "I am always ready to
      be interrupted on magisterial business. I see. On the
      dotted line. Lend me your fountain-pen, Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she held out her hand for it, all her cards tumbled out
      of her sleeve. A draught eddied through the open door and
      Benjy's <i>cache</i> on the cupboard fluttered into the
      air. Elizabeth jumped up to gather them, and the cards on
      which she was sitting fell on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia signed with a slightly unsteady hand, and gave the
      summons back to the Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, your Worship," he said. "Very sorry to
      interrupt your game, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Lucia. "You were only doing your duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must apologise to you all," said Lucia without a
      moment's pause, "but my good Inspector has orders to ask
      for me whenever he wants to see me on any urgent matter.
      Dear me! All my cards exposed on the table and Elizabeth's
      and Major Benjy's on the floor. I am afraid we must have a
      fresh deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody made any allusion to the late panic, and Lucia dealt
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva looked in again soon, carrying a box of chocolates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any more Inspectors, dear?" asked Elizabeth acidly. "Any
      more raids? Your nerves seem rather jumpy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva was sorely tempted to retort that their nerves seemed
      pretty jumpy too, but it was bad for business to be sharp
      with patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, and I'm giving him such a nice tea," she said meekly.
      "But it was a relief, wasn't it? A box of chocolates for
      you. Very good ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rubber came to an end, with everybody eating
      chocolates, and a surcharged chat on local topics
      succeeded. It almost intoxicated Lucia, who, now for weeks,
      had not partaken of that heady beverage, and she felt more
      than ever like Catherine the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very recreative two hours," she said to Georgie as they
      went up the hill homewards, "though I still maintain that
      our game would have been just as exciting without playing
      for money. And that farcical interlude of my Inspector!
      Georgie, I don't mind confessing that just for one brief
      moment it <i>did</i> occur to me that he was raiding the
      premises--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know that," said Georgie. "Why, you asked Diva if
      there wasn't a back way out, and told us to hide our cards
      and talk. I was the only one of us who knew how absurd it
      all was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how you bundled your cards into your pocket! We were
      all a little alarmed. All. I put it down to Diva's
      terror-stricken entrance with her teapot dribbling at the
      spout--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I didn't see that," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a pool on the ground. And her lamentable outcry
      about her tea-rooms being closed. It was suggestion, dear.
      Very sensitive people like myself respond automatically to
      suggestion . . . And most interesting about Susan and her
      automatic script. She thinks, Elizabeth tells me, that Blue
      Birdie controls her when she's in trance, and is entirely
      wrapped up in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's hardly ever seen now," said Georgie. "She never
      plays Bridge, nor comes to Diva's for tea, and Algernon
      usually does her marketing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must really go to one of her <i>séances,</i> if I can
      find a free hour some time," said Lucia. "But my visit must
      be quite private. It would never do if it was known that
      the Mayor attended <i>séances</i> which do seem alien
      [ed.--akin?] to necromancy. Necromancy, as you may know, is
      divining through the medium of a corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's a human corpse, isn't it?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you can make a distinction--Oh! Take care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled Georgie back, just as he was stepping on to the
      road from the pavement. A boy on a bicycle, riding without
      lights, flew down the hill, narrowly missing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most dangerous!" said Lucia. "No lights and excessive
      speed. I must ring up my Inspector and report that boy--I
      wonder who he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how you can report him unless you know,"
      suggested Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia disregarded such irrelevancy. Her eyes followed the
      boy as he curved recklessly round the sharp corner into the
      High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really I feel more envious than indignant," she said. "It
      must be so exhilarating. Such speed! What Lawrence of
      Arabia always loved. I feel very much inclined to learn
      bicycling. Those smart ladies of the nineties use to find
      it very amusing. Bicycling-breakfasts in Battersea Park and
      all that. Our brisk walks, whenever I have time to take
      them, are so limited: in these short afternoons we can
      hardly get out into the country before it is time to turn
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea appealed to Georgie, especially when Lucia
      embellished it with mysterious and conspiratorial
      additions. No one must know that they were learning until
      they were accomplished enough to appear in the High Street
      in complete control of their machines. What a sensation
      that would cause! What envious admiration! So next day they
      motored out to a lonely stretch of road a few miles away,
      where a man from the bicycle-shop, riding a man's bicycle
      and guiding a woman's, had a clandestine assignation with
      them. He held Georgie on, while Chapman, Lucia's chauffeur,
      clung to her, and for the next few afternoons they wobbled
      about the road with incalculable swoopings. Lucia was far
      the quicker of the two in acquiring the precarious balance,
      and she talked all the time to Chapman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm beginning to feel quite secure,'' she said. "You might
      let go for one second. No: there's a cart coming. Better
      wait till it has passed. Where's Mr. Georgie? Far behind, I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am. Ever so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what a jolt!" she cried, as her front wheel went over
      a loose stone. "Enough to unseat anybody. I put on the
      brake, don't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After ringing the bell once or twice, Lucia found the
      brake. The bicycle stopped dead, and she stepped lightly
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So powerful," she said remounting. "Now both hands off for
      a moment, Chapman."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The day came when Georgie's attendant still hovered close
      to him, but when Lucia outpaced Chapman altogether. A
      little way in front of her a man near the edge of the road,
      with a saucepan of tar bubbling over a pot of red-hot
      coals, was doctoring a telegraph post. Then something
      curious happened to the co-ordination between Lucia's brain
      and muscles. The imperative need of avoiding the fire-pot
      seemed to impel her to make a bee-line for it. With her
      eyes firmly fixed on it, she felt in vain for that powerful
      brake, and rode straight into the fire-pot, upsetting the
      tar and scattering the coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm so sorry," she said to the operator. "I'm rather
      new at it. Would half-a-crown? And then would you kindly
      hold my bicycle while I mount again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The road was quite empty after that, and Lucia sped
      prosperously along, wobbling occasionally for no reason,
      but rejoicing in the comparative swiftness. Then it was
      time to turn. This was impossible without dismounting, but
      she mounted again without much difficulty, and there was a
      lovely view of Tilling rising red-roofed above the level
      land. Telegraph post after telegraph post flitted past her,
      and then she caught sight of the man with the fire-pot
      again. Lucia felt that he was observing her, and once more
      something curious occurred to her co-ordinations, and with
      it the familiar sense of exactly the same situation having
      happened before. Her machine began to swoop about the road;
      she steadied it, and with the utmost precision went
      straight into the fire-pot again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to make a practice of it," remarked the operator
      severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too awkward of me," said Lucia. "It was the very last
      thing I wanted to do. Quite the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll be another half-crown," said the victim, "and now
      I come to look at you, it was you and your pals cocked up
      on the Bench, who fined me five bob last month, for not
      being half as unsteady as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! How small the world is," said Lucia with great
      dignity and aloofness, taking out her purse. Indeed it was
      a strange coincidence that she should have disbursed to the
      culprit of last month exactly the sum that she had fined
      him for drunkenness. She thought there was something rather
      psychic about it, but she could not tell Georgie, for that
      would have disclosed to him that in the course of her
      daring, unaccompanied ride she had twice upset a fire-pot
      and scattered tar and red hot coals on the highway. Soon
      she met him still outward bound and he, too, was riding
      unsupported.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've made such strides to-day," he called out. "How have
      you got on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautifully! Miles!" said Lucia, as they passed each
      other. "But we must be getting back. Let me see you turn,
      dear, without dismounting. Not so difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      The very notion of attempting that made Georgie unsteady,
      and he got off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe she can do it herself," he muttered, as he
      turned his machine and followed her. The motor was waiting
      for them, and just as she was getting in, he observed a
      blob of tar on one of her shoes. She wiped it off on the
      grass by the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Susan had invited them both to a necromantic <i>séance</i>
      after tea that evening. She explained that she would not
      ask them to tea, because before these sittings she fasted
      and meditated in the dark for an hour. When they got home
      from their ride, Georgie went to his sitting-room to rest,
      but Lucia, fresh as a daisy, filled up time by studying a
      sort of catechism from the Board of the Southern Railway in
      answer to her suggestion of starting a Royal Fish Express
      with a refrigerating van to supply the Court. They did not
      seem very enthusiastic; they put a quantity of queries. Had
      Her Worship received a Royal command on the subject? Did
      she propose to run the R.F.E. to Balmoral when the Court
      was in Scotland, because there were Scotch fishing ports a
      little closer? Had she worked out the cost of a
      refrigerating van? Was the supply of fish at Tilling
      sufficient to furnish the Royal Table as well as the normal
      requirements of the district? Did her Worship--
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor entered. Mr. Wyse had called, and would much
      like, if quite convenient, to have a few words with Lucia
      before the <i>séance.</i> That seemed a more urgent call,
      for all these fish questions required a great deal of
      thought, and must be gone into with Mrs. Simpson next
      morning, and she told Grosvenor that she could give him ten
      minutes. He entered, carrying a small parcel wrapped up in
      brown paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So good of you to receive me," he said. "I am aware of the
      value of your time. A matter of considerable delicacy. My
      dear Susan tells me that you and your husband have
      graciously promised to attend her <i>séance</i> to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia referred to her engagement book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite correct," she said. "I found I could just fit it in.
      Five-thirty p.m. is my entry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will speak but briefly of the ritual of these
      <i>séances,"</i> said Mr. Wyse. "My Susan sits at the table
      in our little dining-room, which you have, alas too rarely,
      honoured by your presence on what I may call less moribund
      occasions. It is furnished with a copious supply of
      scribbling paper and of sharpened pencils for her automatic
      script. In front of her is a small shrine, I may term it,
      of ebony--possibly ebonite--with white satin curtains
      concealing what is within. At the commencement of the
      <i>séance,</i> the lights are put out, and my Susan draws
      the curtains aside. Within are the mortal remains--or such
      as could be hygienically preserved--of her budgerigar. She
      used to wear them in her hat or as a decoration for the
      bosom. They once fell into a dish, a red dish, at your
      hospitable table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember. Raspberry something," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bow to your superior knowledge," said Mr. Wyse. "Then
      Susan goes into a species of trance, and these
      communications through automatic script begin. Very
      voluminous sometimes, and difficult to decipher. She spends
      the greater part of the day in puzzling them out, not
      always successfully. Now, <i>adorabile Signora</i>--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Wyse," cried Lucia, slightly startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear lady, I only meant Your Worship," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Stupid of me," she said. "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appeal to you," continued he. "To put the matter in a
      nutshell, I fear my dear Susan will get unhinged, if this
      goes on. Already she is sadly changed. Her strong
      commonsense, her keen appreciation of the comforts and
      interests of life, her fur-coat, her Royce, her shopping,
      her Bridge; all these are tasteless to her. Nothing exists
      for her except these communings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can I help you?" asked Lucia . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyse tapped the brown paper parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought here," he said, "the source of all our
      trouble: Blue Birdie. I abstracted it from the shrine while
      my dear Susan was meditating in the drawing-room. I want it
      to disappear in the hope that when she discovers it has
      gone, she will have to give up the <i>séances,</i> and
      recover her balance. I would not destroy it: that would be
      going too far. Would you therefore, dear lady, harbour the
      Object in some place unknown to me, so that when Susan asks
      me, as she undoubtedly will, if I know where it is, I may
      be able to tell her that I do not? A shade jesuitical
      perhaps, but such jesuitry, I feel, is justifiable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia considered this. "I think it is, too," she said. "I
      will put it somewhere safe. Anything to prevent our Susan
      becoming unhinged. That must never happen. By the way, is
      there a slight odour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A reliable and harmless disinfectant," said Mr. Wyse.
      "There was a faint smell in the neighbourhood of the shrine
      which I put down to imperfect taxidermy. A thousand thanks,
      Worshipful Lady. One cannot tell what my Susan's reactions
      may be, but I trust that the disappearance of the Object
      may lead to a discontinuance of the <i>séances.</i> In
      fact, I do not see how they could be held without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had ordered a stack of black japanned boxes to hold
      documents connected with municipal departments. The arms of
      the Borough and her name were painted on them, with the
      subject with which they were concerned. There were several
      empty ones, and when Mr. Wyse had bowed himself out, she
      put Blue Birdie into the one labelled "Museum," which
      seemed appropriate. "Burial Board" would have been
      appropriate, too, but there was already an agenda-paper in
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she and Georgie set forth for Starling Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan and Algernon were ready for them in the dining-room.
      The shrine with drawn curtains was on the table. Susan had
      heated a shovel and was burning incense on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blue Birdie came from the Spice Islands," she explained,
      waving the shovel in front of the shrine. "Yesterday my
      hand wrote 'sweet gums' as far as I could read it, over and
      over again, and I think that's what he meant. And I've put
      up a picture of St. Francis preaching to the birds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Susan, as her husband had said, was much changed.
      She looked dotty. There was an ecstatic light in her eye,
      and a demented psychical smile on her mouth. She wore a
      wreath in her hair, a loose white gown, and reminded Lucia
      of an immense operatic Ophelia. But critical circumstances
      always developed Lucia's efficiency, and she nodded
      encouragingly to Algernon as Susan swept fragrantly about
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So good of you to let us come, dear Susan," she said. "I
      have very great experience in psychical phenomena:
      adepts--do you remember the Guru at Riseholme,
      Georgie?--adepts always tell me that I should be a
      marvellous medium if I had time to devote myself to the
      occult."
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan held up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush," she whispered. "Surely I heard 'Tweet, Tweet',
      which means Blue Birdie is here. Good afternoon, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the fire-shovel into the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very promising," she said. "Blue Birdie doesn't usually
      make himself heard so soon, and it always means I'm going
      into trance. It must be you, Lucia, who have contributed to
      the psychic force."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," said Lucia, "the Guru always said I had
      immense power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn out the lights then, Algernon, all but the little
      ruby lamp by my paper, and I will undraw the curtains of
      the shrine. Tweet, Tweet! There it is again, and that lost
      feeling is coming over me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had been thinking desperately, while Ophelia got
      ready, with that intense concentration which, so often
      before, had smoothed out the most crumpled situations. She
      gave a silvery laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard it, I heard it," she exclaimed to Algernon's great
      surprise. "<i>Buona sera,</i> Blue Birdie. Have you come to
      see Mummie and Auntie Lucia from Spicy Islands? . . . Oh,
      I'm sure I felt a little brush of soft feathers on my
      cheek."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! did you really?" asked Susan with the slightest touch
      of jealousy in her voice. "My pencil, Algernon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a swift glance at the shrine, as Susan drew the
      curtains, and was satisfied that the most spiritually
      enlightened eye could not see that it was empty. But dark
      though the room was, it was as if fresh candles were being
      profusely lit in her brain, as on some High Altar dedicated
      to Ingenuity. She kept her eyes fixed on Susan's hand
      poised over her paper. It was recording very little: an
      occasional dot or dash was all the inspiration Blue Birdie
      could give. For herself, she exclaimed now and then that
      she felt in the dark the brush of the bird's wing, or heard
      that pretty note. Each time she saw that the pencil paused.
      Then the last and the greatest candle was lit in her
      imagination, and she waited calm and composed for the
      conclusion of the <i>séance,</i> when Susan would see that
      the shrine was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in the dim ruby light for half an hour, and Susan,
      as if not quite lost, gave an annoyed exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very disappointing," she said. "Turn on the light,
      Algernon. Blue Birdie began so well and now nothing is
      coming through."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could get to the switch, Lucia, with a great gasp
      of excitement, fell back in her chair, and covered her eyes
      with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something wonderful has happened," she chanted. "Blue
      Birdie has left us altogether. What a manifestation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still not even peeping, she heard Susan's voice rise to a
      scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the shrine's empty!" she cried. "Where is Blue Birdie,
      Algernon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no idea," said the Jesuit. "What has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia still sat with covered eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you before the light was turned on that
      there had been a great manifestation?" she asked. "I
      <i>knew</i> the shrine would be empty! Let me look for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a feather!" she said. "The dematerialization is
      complete. Oh, what would not the President of the Psychical
      Research have given to be present! Only a few minutes ago,
      Susan and I--did we not, Susan?--heard his little
      salutation, and I, at any rate, felt his feathers brush my
      cheek. Now no trace! Never, in all my experience, have I
      seen anything so perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what does it mean?" asked the distraught Susan,
      pulling the wreath from her dishevelled hair. Lucia waved
      her hands in a mystical movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Susan," she said, beginning to gabble, "Listen! All
      these weeks your darling's spirit has been manifesting
      itself to you, and to me also to-night, with its pretty
      chirps and strokes of the wing, in order to convince you of
      its presence, earth-bound and attached to its mortal
      remains. Now on the astral plane Blue Birdie has been able
      so to flood them with spiritual reality that they have been
      dissolved, translated--ah, how badly I put it--into spirit.
      Blue Birdie has been helping you all these weeks to realise
      that all is spirit. Now you have this final, supreme
      demonstration. Rapt with all of him that was mortal into a
      higher sphere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But won't he ever come back?" asked Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you would not be so selfish as to wish that!" said
      Lucia. "He is free; he is earth-bound no longer, and, by
      this miracle of dematerialization, has given you proof of
      that. Let me see what his last earthly communication with
      you was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia picked up the sheet on which Susan had automatically
      recorded a few undecipherable scribbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it!" she cried. "See, there is nothing but those
      few scrawled lines. Your sweet bird's spirit was losing
      connection with the material sphere; he was rising above
      it. How it all hangs together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall miss him dreadfully," said Susan in a faltering
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you mustn't, you mustn't. You cannot grudge him his
      freedom. And, oh, what a privilege to have assisted at such
      a demonstration! Ennobling! And if my small powers added to
      yours, dear, helped toward such a beautiful result, why
      that is <i>more</i> than a privilege."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt sure that there was hocus-pocus somewhere, and
      that Lucia had had a hand in it, but his probings, as they
      walked away, only elicited from her idiotic replies such as
      "Too marvellous! What a privilege!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became known in marketing circles next morning that
      very remarkable necromancy had occurred at Starling
      Cottage, that Blue Birdie had fluttered about the darkened
      room, uttering his sharp cries, and had several times
      brushed against the cheek of the Mayor. Then, wonder of
      wonders, his mortal remains had vanished. Mr. Wyse walked
      up and down the High Street, never varying his account of
      the phenomena, but unable to explain them, and for the
      first time for some days Susan appeared in her Royce, but
      without any cockade in her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something mysterious and incredible about it all,
      but it did not usurp the entire attention of Tilling, for
      why did Elizabeth, from whom violent sarcasm might have
      been expected, seem to shun conversation? She stole rapidly
      from shop to shop, and, when cornered by Diva, coming out
      of the butcher's, she explained, scarcely opening her lips
      at all, that she had a relaxed throat, and must only
      breathe through her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should open my mouth wide," said Diva severely, "and
      have a good gargle," but Elizabeth only shook her head with
      an odd smile, and passed on. "Looks a bit hollow-cheeked,
      too," thought Diva. By contrast, Lucia was far from
      hollow-cheeked; she had a swollen face, and made no secret
      of her appointment with the dentist to have "it" out. From
      there she went home, with the expectation of receiving,
      later in the day, a denture comprising a few molars with a
      fresh attachment added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate her lunch, in the fashion of a rabbit, with her
      front teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a skilful extraction, Georgie," she said, "but a
      little sore."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had a Council meeting that afternoon, Georgie went
      off alone in the motor for his assignation with the boy
      from the bicycle shop. The <i>séance</i> last evening still
      puzzled him, but he felt more certain than ever that her
      exclamations that she heard chirpings and felt the brush of
      Birdie's wing were absolute rubbish; so, too, was her
      gabble that her psychic powers added to Susan's, had
      brought about the dematerialization. "All bosh," he said
      aloud in an annoyed voice, "and it only confirms her
      complicity. It's very unkind of her not to tell me how she
      faked it, when she knows how I would enjoy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      His bicycle was ready for him; he mounted without the
      slightest difficulty, and the boy was soon left far behind.
      Then with secret trepidation he observed not far ahead a
      man with a saucepan of tar simmering over a fire-pot. As he
      got close, he was aware of a silly feeling in his head that
      it was exercising a sort of fascination over his machine,
      but by keeping his eye on the road he got safely by it,
      though with frightful wobbles, and dismounted for a short
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a disappointment," observed the operator.
      "You ain't a patch on the lady who knocked down my fire-pot
      twice yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Georgie remembered the dab of tar on Lucia's shoe,
      and illumination flooded his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Did she indeed?" he said with great interest. "The
      same lady twice? That was bad riding!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, something shocking. Not that I'd ever seek to hinder
      her, for she gave me half-a-crown per upset. Ain't she
      coming today?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rode home Georgie again meditated on Lucia's
      secretiveness. Why could she not tell him about her
      jugglings at the <i>séance</i> yesterday and about her
      antics with the fire-pot? Even to him she had to keep up
      this incessant flow of triumphant achievement both in
      occult matters and in riding a bicycle. Now that they were
      man and wife she ought to be more open with him. "But I'll
      tickle her up about the fire-pot," he thought vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got home he found Lucia just returned from a most
      satisfactory Council meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We got through our business most expeditiously," she said,
      "for Elizabeth was absent, and so there were fewer
      irrelevant interruptions. I wonder what ailed her: nothing
      serious I hope. She was rather odd in the High Street this
      morning. No smiles: she scarcely opened her mouth when I
      spoke to her. And did you make good progress on your
      bicycle this afternoon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirable," said he. "Perfect steering. There was a man
      with a fire-pot tarring a telegraph-post--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," interrupted Lucia. "Tar keeps off insects that
      burrow into the wood. Let us go and have tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and an odd feeling came over me," he continued firmly,
      "that just because I must avoid it, I should very likely
      run into it. Have you ever felt that? I suppose not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed I have in my earlier stages," said Lucia
      cordially. "But I can give you an absolute cure for it. Fix
      your eyes straight ahead, and you'll have no bother at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I found. The man was a chatty sort of fellow. He told
      me that some learner on a bicycle had knocked over the pot
      twice yesterday. Can you imagine such awkwardness? I am
      pleased to have got past that stage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not show by the wink of an eyelid that this arrow
      had pierced her, and Georgie, in spite of his exasperation,
      could not help admiring such nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital!" she said. "I expect you've quite caught me up by
      your practice to-day. Now after my Council meeting I think
      I must relax. A little music, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A melodious half-hour followed. They were both familiar
      with Beethoven's famous Fifth Symphony, as arranged for
      four hands on the piano, and played it with ravishing
      sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Caro,</i> how it takes one out of all petty carpings
      and schemings!" said Lucia at the end. "How all our
      smallnesses are swallowed up in that broad cosmic
      splendour! And how beautifully you played, dear. Inspired!
      I almost stopped in order to listen to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie writhed under these compliments: he could hardly
      switch back to dark hints about <i>séances</i> and
      fire-pots after them. In strong rebellion against his
      kindlier feelings towards her, he made himself comfortable
      by the fire, while Lucia again tackled the catechism
      imposed on her by the Directors of the Southern Railway.
      Fatigued by his bicycle-ride, Georgie fell into a pleasant
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Grosvenor entered, carrying a small packet,
      neatly wrapped up and sealed. Lucia put her finger to her
      lip with a glance at her sleeping husband, and Grosvenor
      withdrew in tiptoe silence. Lucia knew what this packet
      must contain; she could slip the reconstituted denture into
      her mouth in a moment, and there would be no more
      rabbit-nibbling at dinner. She opened the packet and took
      out of the cotton-wool wrapping what it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to suppress a shrill exclamation, and
      Georgie awoke with a start. Beneath the light of Lucia's
      reading-lamp there gleamed in her hand something dazzling,
      something familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what <i>have</i> you got?" he cried. "Why, it's
      Elizabeth's front teeth! It's Elizabeth's widest smile
      without any of her face! But how? Why? Blue Birdie's
      nothing to this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made haste to wrap up the smile again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is," she said. "I knew it was familiar, and
      the moment you said 'smile' I recognised it. That explains
      Elizabeth's shut mouth this morning. An accident to her
      smile, and now by some extraordinary mistake the dentist
      has sent it back to me. Me of all people! What are we to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send it back to Elizabeth," suggested Georgie, "with a
      polite note saying it was addressed to you, and that you
      opened it. Serve her right, the deceitful woman! How often
      has she said that she never had any bother with her teeth,
      and hadn't been to a dentist since she was a child, and
      didn't know what toothache meant. No wonder; that kind
      doesn't ache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that would serve her right--" began Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. She began to think intensely. If Elizabeth's
      entire smile had been sent to her, where, except to
      Elizabeth, had her own more withdrawn aids to mastication
      been sent? Elizabeth could not possibly identify those four
      hinterland molars, unless she had been preternaturally
      observant, but the inference would be obvious if Lucia
      personally sent her back her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Georgie; that wouldn't be kind," she said. "Poor
      Elizabeth would never dare to smile at me again, if she
      knew I knew. I don't deny she richly deserves it for
      telling all those lies, but it would be an unworthy action.
      It is by a pure accident that we know, and we must not use
      it against her. I shall instantly send this box back to the
      dentist's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do you know who her dentist is?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Fergus," said Lucia, "who took my tooth so beautifully
      this morning; there was his card with the packet. I shall
      merely say that I am utterly at a loss to understand why
      this has been sent me, and not knowing what the intended
      destination was, I return it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor entered again. She bore a sealed packet precisely
      similar to that which now again contained Elizabeth's
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a note, ma'am," she said. "And the boy is waiting for
      a packet left here by mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do open it," said Georgie gaily. "Somebody else's
      teeth, I expect. I wonder if we shall recognise them. Quite
      a new game, and most exciting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words out of his mouth when he perceived
      what must have happened. How on earth could Lucia get out
      of such an awkward situation? But it took far more than
      that to disconcert the Mayor of Tilling. She gave Grosvenor
      the other packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sample or two of tea that I was expecting," she said in
      her most casual voice. "Yes, from Twistevant's." And she
      put the sample into a drawer of her table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could fail to admire, thought Georgie, this brazen
      composure?
    </p>
    <p>

          id="c06">CHAPTER VI</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth's relaxed throat had completely braced itself by
      next morning, and at shopping time she was profuse in her
      thanks to Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I followed your advice, dear, and gargled well when I got
      home," she said, "and not a trace of it this morning . . .
      Ah, here's Worship and Mr. Georgie. I was just telling Diva
      how quickly her prescription cured my poor throat; I simply
      couldn't speak yesterday. And I hope you're better,
      Worship. It must be a horrid thing to have a tooth out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and Georgie scrutinized her smile . . . There was no
      doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you're one of the lucky ones," said Lucia in tones of
      fervent congratulation. "How I envied you your beautiful
      teeth when Mr. Fergus said he must take one of mine out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I envy you too," said Georgie. "We all do."
    </p>
    <p>
      These felicitations seemed to speed Elizabeth's departure.
      She shut off her smile, and tripped across the street to
      tell the Padre that her throat was well again, and that she
      would be able to sing alto as usual in the choir on Sunday.
      With a slightly puzzled face he joined the group she had
      just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer doings indeed!" he said in a sarcastic voice.
      "Everything in Tilling seems to be vanishing. There's
      Mistress Mapp-Flint's relaxed throat, her as couldn't open
      her mouth yesterday. And there's Mistress Wyse's little
      bird. Dematerialized, they say. Havers! And there's Major
      Benjy's riding-whip. Very strange indeed. I canna' make
      nothing of it a'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject did not lead to much. Lucia had nothing to say
      about Blue Birdie, nor Diva about the riding-whip. She
      turned to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My tulip bulbs have just come for my garden," she said.
      "Do spare a minute and tell me where and how to plant them.
      Doing it all myself. No gardener. Going to have an open-air
      tea-place in the Spring. Want it to be a bower."
    </p>
    <p>
      The group dispersed. Lucia went to the bicycle shop to
      order machines for the afternoon. She thought it would be
      better to change the <i>venue</i> and appointed the broad,
      firm stretch of sands beyond the golf links, where she and
      Georgie could practise turning without dismounting, and
      where there would be no risk of encountering fire-pots.
      Georgie went with Diva into her back-garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things," explained Diva, "can be handed out of the kitchen
      window. So convenient. And where shall I have the tulips?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All along that bed," said Georgie. "Give me a trowel and
      the bulbs. I'll show you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva stood admiringly by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a neat hole!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Press the bulb firmly down, but without force," said
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. And then you cover it up, and put the earth back
      again--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the next about three inches away--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear, oh dear. What a quantity it will take!" said
      Diva. "And <i>do</i> you believe in Elizabeth's relaxed
      throat. I don't. I've been wondering--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open window of the kitchen came the
      unmistakable sound of a kettle boiling over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shan't be a minute," she said. "Stupid Janet. Must have
      gone to do the rooms and left it on the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      She trundled indoors. Georgie dug another hole for a bulb,
      and the trowel brought up a small cylindrical object,
      blackish of hue, but of smooth, polished surface, and
      evidently no normal product of a loamy soil. It was metal,
      and a short stub of wood projected from it. He rubbed the
      soil off it, and engraved on it were two initials, B. F.
      Memory poised like a hawk and swooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's it!" he said to himself. "Not a doubt about it.
      Benjamin Flint."
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped it into his pocket while he considered what to
      do with it. No; it would never do to tell Diva what he had
      found. Relics did not bury themselves, and who but Diva
      could have buried this one? Evidently she wanted to get rid
      of it, and it would be heartless as well as unnecessary to
      let her know that she had not succeeded. Bury it again
      then? There are feats of which human nature is incapable,
      and Georgie dug a hole for the next tulip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva whizzed out again, and went on talking exactly where
      she had left off before the kettle boiled over, but
      repeating the last word to give him the context.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--wondering if it was not teeth in some way. She often
      says they're so marvellous, but people who have really got
      marvellous teeth <i>don't</i> speak about them. They let
      them talk for themselves. Or bite. Tilling's full of
      conundrums as the Padre said. Especially since Lucia's
      become Mayor. She's more dynamic than ever and makes things
      happen all round her. What a gift! Oh, dear me, I'm talking
      to her husband. You don't mind, Mr. Georgie? She's so
      central."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie longed to tell her how central Lucia had been about
      Elizabeth's relaxed throat, but that wouldn't be wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind? Not a bit," he said. "And she would love to know
      that you feel that about her. Well, good luck to the
      tulips, and don't dig them up to see how they're getting
      on. It doesn't help them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. Won't it be a bower in the spring? And
      Irene is going to paint a signboard for me. Sure to be
      startling. But nothing nude, I said, except hands and
      faces."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was doing physical jerks on her doorstep as Georgie
      passed her house on his way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, King of my heart," she called. "Oh, Georgie,
      you're a public temptation, you are, when you've got on
      your mustard-coloured cape and your blue tam-o'-shanter.
      Come in, and let me adore you for five minutes--only
      five--or shall I show you the new design for my fresco?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like that best," said Georgie severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene had painted a large sketch in oils to take the place
      of that which the Town Surveying Department had prohibited.
      Tilling, huddling up the hill and crowned by the church
      formed the background, and in front, skimming up the river
      was a huge oyster-shell, on which was poised a substantial
      Victorian figure in shawl and bonnet and striped skirt,
      instead of the nude, putty-coloured female. It reproduced
      on a large scale the snap-shot of Elizabeth which had
      appeared in the <i>Hampshire Argus,</i> and the face,
      unmistakably Elizabeth's, wore a rapturous smile. One arm
      was advanced, and one leg hung out behind, as if she was
      skating. An equally solid gentleman, symbolizing wind,
      sprawled, in a frock-coat and top-hat, on a cloud behind
      her and with puffed cheeks propelled her upstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, most striking!" said Georgie. "But isn't it very
      like that photograph of Elizabeth in the <i>Argus?</i> And
      won't people say that it's Major Benjy in the clouds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course they will, stupid, unless they're blind,"
      cried Irene. I've never forgiven Mapp for being Mayoress
      and standing against you for the Town Council. This will
      take her down a peg, and all for the sake of Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's most devoted of you, Irene," he said, "and such fun,
      too, but do you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never think," cried Irene. "I <i>feel,</i> and that's
      how I feel. I'm the only person in this petty, scheming
      world of Tilling who acts on impulse. Even Lucia schemes
      sometimes. And as you've introduced the subject--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't introduced any subject yet," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like you. You wouldn't. But Georgie, what a glorious
      picture, isn't it? I almost think it has gained by being
      Victorianized; there a devilish reserved force about the
      Victorians which mere nudity lacks. A nude has all its
      cards on the table. I've a good mind to send it to the
      Royal Academy instead of making a fresco of it. Just to
      punish the lousy Grundys of Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would serve them right," agreed Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon bicycling along the shore was a great
      success. The tide was low, exposing a broad strip of firm,
      smooth sand. Chapman and the bicycle boy no longer ran
      behind, and, now that there was so much room for turning,
      neither of the athletes found the least difficulty in doing
      so, and their turns soon grew, as Lucia said, as sharp as a
      needle. The rocks and groins provided objects to be
      avoided, and they skimmed close by them without collision.
      They mounted and dismounted, masters of the arts of balance
      and direction; all those secret practisings suddenly
      flowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's time to get bicycles of our own," said Lucia as they
      turned homewards. "We'll order them to-day, and as soon as
      they come we'll do our morning shopping on them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very nervous," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need, dear. I pass you as being able to ride through
      any traffic, and to dismount quickly and safely. Just
      remember not to look at anything you want to avoid. The
      head turned well away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of that," said Georgie, much nettled by this
      patronage. "And about you. Remember about your brake and
      your bell. You confuse them sometimes. Ring your bell,
      dear! Now put on your brake. That's better."
    </p>
    <p>
      They joined the car and drove back along Fire-Pot Road.
      Work was still going on there, and Lucia, in a curious fit
      of absence of mind, pointed to the bubbling saucepan of
      tar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to think that only a few days ago," she said, "I
      actually--My dear, I'll confess, especially as I feel sure
      you've guessed. I upset that tar-pot. Twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I knew that," said Georgie. "But I'm glad you've
      told me at last. I'll tell you something, too. Look at
      this. Tell me what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out of his pocket the silver top of Benjy's
      riding-whip, which he had excavated this morning. Foljambe
      had polished it up. Lucia's fine eyebrows knit themselves
      in recollective agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Familiar, somehow," she mused. "Ah! Initials. B. F. Why,
      it's Benjy's! Newspaper Office! Riding-whip! Disappearance!
      Georgie, how did you come by it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's account was punctuated by comments from Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the depth of a tulip bulb . . . Not nearly deep
      enough, such want of thoroughness . . . Diva must have
      buried it herself, I think . . . So you were quite right
      not to have told her; very humiliating. But how did the top
      come to be snapped off? Do you suppose she broke it off,
      and buried the rest somewhere else, like murderers cutting
      up their victims? And look at the projecting end! It looks
      as if it had been bitten off, and why should Diva do that?
      If it had been Elizabeth with her beautiful teeth, it would
      have been easier to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very baffling," said Georgie, "but anyhow I've traced
      the disappearances a step further. I shall turn my
      attention to Blue Birdie next."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia thought she had done enough confession for one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do look into it, Georgie," she said. "Very baffling,
      too. But Mr. Wyse is most happy about the effect of my
      explanation upon Susan. She has accepted my theory that
      Blue Birdie has gone to a higher sphere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That seems to me a very bad sign," said Georgie. "It looks
      as if she was seriously deranged. And, candidly, do you
      believe it yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So difficult, isn't it," said Lucia in a philosophical
      voice, "to draw hard and fast lines between what one
      rationally believes, and what one trusts is true, and what
      seems to admit of more than one explanation. We must have a
      talk about that some day. A wonderful sunset!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The bicycles arrived a week later, nickel-plated and belled
      and braked; Lucia's had the Borough Arms of Tilling
      brilliantly painted on the tool-bag behind her saddle. They
      were brought up to Mallards after dark; and next morning,
      before breakfast, the two rode about the garden paths,
      easily passing up the narrow path into the kitchen garden,
      and making circles round the mulberry tree on the lawn
      ("Here we go round the mulberry tree" light-heartedly
      warbled Lucia) and proving themselves adepts. Lucia could
      not eat much breakfast with the first public appearance so
      close, and Georgie vainly hoped that tropical rain would
      begin. But the sun continued to shine, and at the shopping
      hour they mounted and bumped slowly down the cobbles of the
      steep street into the High Street, ready to ring their
      bells. Irene was the first to see them, and she ran by
      Lucia's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marvellous, perfect person," she cried, putting out her
      hand as if to lay it on Lucia's. "What is there you can't
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, but don't touch me," screamed Lucia in panic.
      "So rough just here." Then they turned on to the smooth
      tarmac of the High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie saw them next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, oh, dear, you'll both be killed!" she squealed.
      "There's a motor coming at such a pace. Kenneth, they're
      riding bicycles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed superbly on. Lucia dismounted at the
      post-office; Georgie, applying his brake with exquisite
      delicacy, halted at the poulterer's with one foot on the
      pavement. Elizabeth was in the shop and Diva came out of
      the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious me," she cried. "Never knew you could. And
      all this traffic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite easy, dear," said Lucia. "Order a chicken, Georgie,
      while I get some stamps."
    </p>
    <p>
      She propped her bicycle against the kerb; Georgie remained
      sitting till Mr. Rice came out of the poulterer's with
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pretty bicycle!" she said, green with jealousy.
      "Oh, there's Worship, too. Well, this is a surprise! So
      accomplished!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They sailed on again. Georgie went to the lending library,
      and found that the book Lucia wanted had come, but he
      preferred to have it sent to Mallards: hands, after all,
      were meant to take hold of handles. Lucia went on to the
      grocer's, and by the time he joined her there, the world of
      Tilling had collected: the Padre and Evie, Elizabeth and
      Benjy and Mr. Wyse, while Susan looked on from the Royce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a saving of time," said Lucia casually to the
      admiring assembly. "A little spin in the country, Georgie,
      for half an hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went unerringly down the High Street, leaving an
      amazed group behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's a leddy of pluck," said the Padre. "See, how
      she glides along. A mistress of a' she touches."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was unable to bear it, and gave an acid laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Padre!" she said. "What a fuss about nothing! When I
      was a girl I learned to ride a bicycle in ten minutes. The
      easiest thing in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did ye, indeed, me'm," said the Padre, "and that was very
      remarkable, for in those days, sure, there was only those
      great high machines, which you rode straddle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Years and years after that," said Elizabeth, moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bicycle would be a grand thing for me in getting about
      the parish," he said. "I'll step into the bicycle-shop, and
      see if they've got one on hire for to learn on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Kenneth, I should like to learn, too," said Evie.
      "Such fun!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the pioneers, rosy with success, had come to the
      end of the High Street. From there the road sloped rapidly
      downhill. "Now we can put on the pace a little, Georgie,"
      said Lucia, and she shot ahead. All her practisings had
      been on the level roads of the marsh or on the sea-shore,
      and at once she was travelling much faster than she had
      intended, and with eyes glued on the curving road, she
      fumbled for her brake. She completely lost her head. All
      she could find in her agitation was her bell, and,
      incessantly ringing it, she sped with ever increasing
      velocity down the short steep road towards the bridge over
      the railway. A policeman on point duty stepped forward,
      with the arresting arm of the law held out to stop her, but
      as she took no notice he stepped very hastily back again,
      for to commit suicide and possibly manslaughter, was a more
      serious crime than dangerous riding. Lucia's face was
      contorted with agonised apprehension, her eyes stared, her
      mouth was wide open, and all the young constable could do
      by way of identification was to notice, when the unknown
      female had whisked by him, that the bicycle was new and
      that there was the Borough coat of arms on the tool-bag.
      Lucia passed between a pedestrian and a van, just avoiding
      both: she switch-backed up and down the railway-bridge,
      still ringing her bell . . . Then in front of her lay the
      long climb of the Tilling hill, and as the pace diminished
      she found her brake. She dismounted, and waited for
      Georgie. He had lost sight of her in the traffic, and
      followed her cautiously in icy expectation of finding her
      and that beautiful new bicycle flung shattered on the road.
      Then he had one glimpse of her swift swallow-flight up the
      steep incline of the railway-bridge. Thank God she was safe
      so far! He traversed it himself and then saw her a hundred
      yards ahead up the hill. Long before he reached her his
      impetus was exhausted, and he got off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hurry, dear," she called to him in a trembling
      voice. "You were right, quite right to ride cautiously.
      Safety first <i>always."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt very anxious about you," said Georgie, panting as
      he joined her. "You oughtn't to have gone so fast. You
      deserve to be summoned for dangerous riding." A vision,
      vague and bright, shot through Lucia's brain. She could not
      conceive a more enviable piece of publicity than, at her
      age, to be summoned for so athletic a feat. It was
      punishable, no doubt, by law, but like a <i>crime
      passionel,</i> what universal admiration it would excite!
      What a dashing Mayor!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess I was going very fast," she said, "but I felt I
      had such complete control of my machine. And so
      exhilarating. I don't suppose anybody has ever ridden so
      fast down Landgate Street. Now, if you're rested, shall we
      go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a long but eminently prudent ride, and after lunch
      a well-earned siesta. Lucia, reposing on the sofa in the
      garden-room, was awakened by Grosvenor's entry from a
      frightful nightmare that she was pedalling for all she was
      worth down Beachy Head into the arms of a policeman on the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inspector Morrison, ma'am," said Grosvenor. "He'll call
      again if not convenient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightmare vanished: the vague vision grew brighter. Was it
      possible? . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, at once," she said springing up and Inspector
      Morrison entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to disturb your Worship," he said, "but one of my
      men has reported that about eleven a.m. to-day a new
      bicycle with the arms of Tilling on the tool-bag was ridden
      at a dangerous speed by a female down Landgate Street. He
      made enquiries at the bicycle shop and found that a similar
      machine was sent to your house yesterday. I therefore ask
      your permission to question your domestics--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right to apply to me, Inspector," said Lucia. "You
      did your duty. Certainly I will sign the summons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we don't know who it was yet, ma'am. I should like to
      ask your servants to account for their whereabouts at
      eleven a.m."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to ask them, Inspector," said Lucia. "I was the
      culprit. Please send the summons round here and I will sign
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, your Worship--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was desperately afraid that the Inspector might
      wriggle out of summoning the Mayor and that the case would
      never come into Court. She turned a magisterial eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not have one law for the rich and another for the
      poor in Tilling," she said. "I was riding at a dangerous
      speed. It was very thoughtless of me, and I must suffer for
      it. I ask you to proceed with the case in the ordinary
      course."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This one appearance of Lucia and Georgie doing their
      shopping on bicycles had been enough to kindle the spark of
      emulation in the breasts of the more mature ladies of
      Tilling. It looked so lissom, so gaily adolescent to weave
      your way in and out of traffic and go for a spin in the
      country, and surely if Lucia could, they could also. Her
      very casualness made it essential to show her that there
      was nothing remarkable about her unexpected feat. The
      bicycle shop was besieged with enquiries for machines on
      hire and instructors. The Padre and Evie were the first in
      the field, and he put off his weekly visit to the workhouse
      that afternoon from half-past two till half-past three, and
      they hired the two bicycles which Lucia and Georgie no
      longer needed. Diva popped in next, and was chagrined to
      find that the only lady's bicycle was already bespoken, so
      she engaged it for an hour on the following morning.
      Georgie that day did quite complicated shopping alone, for
      Lucia was at a committee meeting at the Town Hall. She rode
      there--a distance of a hundred and fifty yards--to save
      time, but the gain was not very great, for she had to
      dismount twice owing to the narrow passage between posts
      for the prevention of vehicular traffic. Georgie, having
      returned from his shopping, joined her at the Town Hall
      when her meeting was over, and, with brakes fully applied,
      they rode down into the High Street, <i>en route</i> for
      another dash into the country. Susan's Royce was drawn up
      at the bicycle-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I shan't have a moment's peace," said Lucia,
      "until I know whether Susan has ambitions too. I must just
      pop in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Wyses were there. Algernon was leaning over
      Susan's shoulder as she studied a catalogue of the newest
      types of tricycles . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayoress alone remained scornful and aloof. Looking out
      from her window one morning, she observed Diva approaching
      very slowly up the trafficless road that ran past Grebe
      buttressed up by Georgie's late instructor, who seemed to
      have some difficulty in keeping her perpendicular. She
      hurried to the garden-gate, reaching it just as Diva came
      opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear," she said. "Sorry to see that you're
      down with it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear," echoed Diva, with her eyes glued to
      the road in front of her. "I haven't the slightest idea
      what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it wise to take such strenuous exercise?" asked
      Elizabeth. "A great strain surely on both of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of a strain," called Diva over her shoulder.
      "And my instructor says I shall soon get on ever so quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bicycle gave a violent swerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, take care," cried Elizabeth in an anxious voice, "or
      you'll get off ever so quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll rest a bit," said Diva to her instructor, and she
      stepped from her machine and went back to the gate to have
      it out with her friend. "What's the matter with you," she
      said to Elizabeth, "is that you can't bear us following
      Lucia's lead. Don't deny it. Look in your own heart, and
      you'll find it's true, Elizabeth. Get over it, dear. Make
      an effort. Far more Christian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for your kind interest in my character, Diva,"
      retorted Elizabeth. "I shall know now where to come when in
      spiritual perplexity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always pleased to advise you," said Diva. "And now give me
      a treat. You told us all you learned to ride in ten minutes
      when you were a girl. I'll give you my machine for ten
      minutes. See if you can ride at the end of it! A bit coy,
      dear? Not surprised. And rapid motion might be risky for
      your relaxed throat."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause. Then both ladies were so
      pleased at their own brilliant dialectic that Elizabeth
      said she would pop in to Diva's establishment for tea, and
      Diva said that would be charming.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Elizabeth (or perhaps even because of her) this
      revival of the bicycling nineties grew most fashionable.
      Major Benjy turned traitor and was detected by his wife
      surreptitiously practising with the gardener's bicycle on
      the cinder path in the kitchen garden. Mr. Wyse suddenly
      appeared on the wheel riding in the most elegant manner.
      Figgis, his butler, he said, happened to remember that he
      had a bicycle put away in the garage and had furbished it
      up. Mr. Wyse introduced a new style: he was already an
      adept and instead of wearing a preoccupied expression, made
      no more of it than if he was strolling about on foot. He
      could take a hand off his handle-bar, to raise his hat to
      the Mayor, as if one hand was all he needed. When
      questioned about this feat, he said that it was not really
      difficult to take both hands off without instantly
      crashing, but Lucia, after several experiments in the
      garden, concluded that Mr. Wyse, though certainly a very
      skilful performer, was wrong about that. To crown all,
      Susan, after a long wait at the corner of Porpoise Street,
      where a standing motor left only eight or nine feet of the
      roadway clear, emerged majestically into the High Street on
      a brand new tricycle. "Those large motors," she complained
      to the Mayor, "ought not to be allowed in our narrow
      streets."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Town Hall was crowded to its utmost capacity on the
      morning that Lucia was summoned to appear before her own
      Court for dangerous riding. She had bicycled there, now
      negotiating the anti-vehicular posts with the utmost
      precision, and, wearing her semiofficial hat, presided on
      the Borough Bench. She and her brother magistrates had two
      cases to try before hers came on, of which one was that of
      a motor-cyclist whose brakes were out of order. The Bench,
      consulting together, took a grave view of the offence, and
      imposed a penalty of twenty shillings. Lucia in pronouncing
      sentence, addressed some severe remarks to him: he would
      have been unable to pull up, she told him, in case of an
      emergency, and was endangering the safety of his fellow
      citizens. The magistrates gave him seven days in which to
      pay. Then came the great moment. The Mayor rose, and in a
      clear unfaltering voice, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Worships, I am personally concerned in the next case,
      and will therefore quit my seat on the Bench. Would the
      senior of Your Worships kindly preside in my temporary
      absence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She descended into the body of the Town Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next case before your Worships," said the Town Clerk,
      "is one of dangerous riding of a push-bicycle on the part
      of Mrs. Lucia Pillson. Mrs. Lucia Pillson."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pleaded guilty in a voice of calm triumph, and the
      Bench heard the evidence. The first witness was a
      constable, who swore that he would speak the truth, the
      whole truth and nothing but the truth. He was on point duty
      by the railway-bridge at 11 a.m. on Tuesday the twelfth
      instant. He observed a female bicyclist approaching at a
      dangerous speed down Landgate Street, when there was a lot
      of traffic about. He put out his arm to stop her, but she
      dashed by him. He estimated her speed at twenty miles an
      hour, and she seemed to have no control over her machine.
      After she had passed, he observed a tool-bag on the back of
      the saddle emblazoned with the Borough coat-of-arms. He
      made enquiries at the bicycle-shop and ascertained that a
      machine of this description had been supplied the day
      before to Mrs. Pillson of Mallards House. He reported to
      his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any questions, your Worsh--to ask the witness?"
      asked the Town Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," said Lucia eagerly. "Not one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next witness was the pedestrian she had so nearly
      annihilated. Lucia was dismayed to see that he was the
      operator with the fire-pot. He began to talk about his
      experiences when tarring telegraph-posts some while ago,
      but, to her intense relief, was promptly checked and told
      he must confine himself to what occurred at 11 a.m. on
      Tuesday. He deposed that at that precise hour, as he was
      crossing the road by the railway-bridge, a female bicyclist
      dashed by him at a speed which he estimated at over twenty
      miles an hour. A gratified smile illuminated the Mayor's
      face, and she had no questions to ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That concluded the evidence, and the Inspector of Police
      said there were no previous convictions against the
      accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bench consulted together: there seemed to be some
      difference of opinion as to the amount of the fine. After a
      little discussion the temporary Chairman told Lucia that
      she also would be fined twenty shillings. She borrowed it
      from Georgie, who was sitting near, and so did not ask for
      time in which to pay. With a superb air she took her place
      again on the Bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie waited for her till the end of the sitting, and
      stood a little in the background, but well in focus, while
      Lucia posed on the steps of the Town Hall, in the act of
      mounting her bicycle, for the photographer of the
      <i>Hampshire Argus.</i> His colleague on the reporting
      staff had taken down every word uttered in this <i>cause
      célèbre</i> and Lucia asked him to send proofs to her,
      before it went to press. It was a slight disappointment
      that no reporters or photographers had come down from
      London, for Mrs. Simpson had been instructed to inform the
      Central News Agency of the day and hour of the trial . . .
      But the Mayor was well satisfied with the local prestige
      which her reckless athleticism had earned for her.
      Elizabeth, indeed, had attempted to make her friends view
      the incident in a different light, and she had a rather
      painful scene on the subject with the Padre and Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All too terrible," she said. "I feel that poor Worship has
      utterly disgraced herself, and brought contempt on the
      dignified office she holds. Those centuries of honourable
      men who have been Mayors here must turn in their graves.
      I've been wondering whether I ought not, in mere
      self-respect, to resign from being Mayoress. It associates
      me with her.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not such a bad notion," said the Padre, and Evie
      gave several shrill squeaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the other hand, I should hate to desert her in her
      trouble," continued the Mayoress. "So true what you said in
      your sermon last Sunday, Padre, that it's our duty as
      Christians always to stand by our friends, whenever they
      are in trouble and need us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So because she needs you, which she doesn't an atom,"
      burst out Evie, "you come and tell us that she's disgraced
      herself, and made everybody turn in their graves. Most
      friendly, Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm of wee wifie's opinion, mem," said the Padre, with
      the brilliant thought of Evie becoming Mayoress in his
      mind, "and if you feel you canna' preserve your
      self-respect unless you resign, why, it's your Christian
      duty to do so, and I warrant that won't incommode her, so
      don't let the standing by your friends deter you. And if
      you ask me what I think of Mistress Lucia's adventure,
      'twas a fine spunky thing to have gone flying down the
      Landgate Street at thirty miles an hour. You and I daurna
      do it, and peradventure we'd be finer folk if we daur. And
      she stood and said she was guilty like a God-fearing
      upstanding body and she deserves a medal, she does. Come
      awa', wifie: we'll get to our bicycle-lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre's view was reflected in the town generally, and
      his new figure of thirty miles an hour accepted. Though it
      was a very lawless and dangerous feat, Tilling felt proud
      of having so spirited a Mayor. Diva indulged in secret
      visions of record-breaking when she had learned to balance
      herself, and Susan developed such a turn of speed on her
      tricycle that Algernon called anxiously after her "Not so
      fast, Susan, I beg you. Supposing you met something." The
      Padre scudded about his parish on the wheel, and, as the
      movement grew, Lucia offered to coach anybody in her
      garden. It became fashionable to career up and down the
      High Street after dark, when traffic was diminished, and
      the whole length of it resounded with tinkling bells and
      twinkled with bicycle lamps. There were no collisions, for
      everyone was properly cautious, but on one chilly evening
      the flapping skirt of Susan's fur coat got so inextricably
      entangled in the chain of her tricycle that she had to shed
      it, and Figgis trundled coat and tricycle back to Porpoise
      Street in the manner of a wheel-barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days grew longer and the weather warmer,
      picnic-parties were arranged to points of interest within
      easy distance, a castle, a church or a Martello tower, and
      they ate sandwiches and drank from their thermos flasks in
      ruined dungeons or on tombstones or by the edge of a moat.
      The party, by reason of the various rates of progress which
      each found comfortable, could not start together, if they
      were to arrive fairly simultaneously, and Susan on her
      tricycle was always the first to leave Tilling, and Diva
      followed. There was some competition for the honour of
      being the last to leave: Lucia, with the cachet of furious
      riding to her credit, waited till she thought the Padre
      must have started, while he was sure that his normal pace
      was faster than hers. In consequence, they usually both
      arrived very late and very hot. They all wondered how they
      could ever have confined physical exercise within the
      radius of pedestrianism, and pitied Elizabeth for the pride
      that debarred her from joining in these pleasant
      excursions.

      Lucia had failed to convince the Directors of the Southern
      Railway that the Royal Fish Train was a practicable scheme.
      "Should Their Majesties" so ran the final communication
      "express Their Royal wish to be supplied with fish from
      Tilling, the Directors would see that the delivery was made
      with all expedition, but in their opinion the ordinary
      resources of the line will suffice to meet Their
      requirements, of which at present no intimation has been
      received."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sad want of enterprise, Georgie," said the Mayor as she
      read this discouraging reply. ''A failure to think
      municipally and to see the distinction of bringing an
      Elizabethan custom up to date. I shall not put the scheme
      before my Council at all." Lucia dropped this
      unenterprising ultimatum into the waste paper basket. The
      afternoon post had just arrived and the two letters which
      it brought for her followed the ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My syllabus for a series of lectures at the Literary
      Institute is not making a good start," she said. "I asked
      Mr. Desmond McCarthy to talk to us about the less known
      novelists of the time of William IV, but he has declined.
      Nor can Mr. Noel Coward speak on the technique of the
      modern stage on any of the five nights I offered him. I am
      surprised that they should not have welcomed the
      opportunity to get more widely known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tar'some of them," said Georgie sympathetically, "such a
      chance for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him a sharp glance, then mused for a while in
      silence over her scheme. Fresh ideas began to flood her
      mind so copiously that she could scarcely scribble them
      down fast enough to keep up with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I will lecture on the Shakespearian drama myself,"
      she said. "That should be the inaugural lecture, say April
      the fifteenth. I don't seem to have any engagement that
      night, and you will take the chair for me . . . Georgie, we
      might act a short scene together, without dresses or
      scenery to illustrate the simplicity of the Elizabethan
      stage. Really, on reflection I think my first series of
      lectures had much better be given by local speakers. The
      Padre would address us one night on Free Will or the Origin
      of Evil. Irene on the technique of fresco painting. Diva on
      catering for the masses. Then I ought to ask Elizabeth to
      lecture on something, though I'm sure I don't know on what
      subject she has any ideas of the slightest value. Ah!
      Instead, Major Benjy on tiger-shooting. Then a musical
      evening: the art of Beethoven, with examples. That would
      make six lectures; six would be enough. I think it would be
      expected of me to give the last as well as the first.
      Admission, a shilling, or five shillings for the series.
      Official, I think, under the patronage of the Mayor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Georgie, going back to one of the earlier
      topics. "I won't act any Shakespearian scene with you to
      illustrate Elizabethan simplicity. And if you ask me I
      don't believe people will pay a shilling to hear the Padre
      lecture on Free-Will. They can hear that sort of thing
      every Sunday morning for nothing but the offertory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will consider that," said Lucia, not listening and
      beginning to draw up a schedule of the discourses. "And if
      you won't do a scene with me, I might do the sleep-walking
      from Macbeth by myself. But you must help me with the
      Beethoven evening. Extracts from the Fifth Symphony for
      four hands on the piano. That glorious work contains, as I
      have always maintained, the Key to the Master's soul. We
      must practise hard, and get our extracts by heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt the sensation, that was now becoming odiously
      familiar, of being hunted and harried. Life for him was
      losing that quality of leisure, which gave one time to feel
      busy and ready to take so thrilled an interest in the
      minute happenings of the day. Lucia was poisoning that
      eager fount by this infusion of mayoral duties and
      responsibilities, and tedious schemes for educational
      lectures and lighting of the streets. True, the old
      pellucid spring gushed out sometimes: who, for instance,
      but she could have made Tilling bicycle-crazy, or have
      convinced Susan that Blue Birdie had gone to a higher
      sphere? That was her real <i>métier,</i> to render the
      trivialities of life intense for others. But how her
      schemes for the good of Tilling bored him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia finished sketching out her schedule, and began
      gabbling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Georgie, the dates seem to work out all right," she
      said, "though Mrs. Simpson must check them for me. April
      the fifteenth: my inaugural lecture on Shakespeare: April
      the twenty-second: the Padre on Free-Will which I am
      convinced will attract all serious people, for it is a most
      interesting subject, and I don't think any final
      explanation of it has yet been given; April the
      twenty-ninth, Irene on the technique of fresco painting:
      May the sixth: Diva on tea-shops. I expect I shall have to
      write it for her. May the thirteenth: Major Benjy on
      tigers: May the twentieth: Beethoven, me again . . . I
      should like to see these little centres of enlightenment
      established everywhere in England, and I count it a
      privilege to be able, in my position, to set an example.
      The B.B.C., I don't deny, is doing good work, but lectures
      delivered <i>viva voce</i> are so much more vivid. Personal
      magnetism. I shall always entertain the lecturer and a few
      friends to a plain supper-party here afterwards, and we can
      continue the discussion in the garden-room. I shall ask
      some distinguished expert on the subject to come down and
      stay the night after each lecture: the Bishop when the
      Padre lectures on Free-Will: Mr. Gielgud when I speak about
      Shakespearian technique: Sir Henry Wood when we have our
      Beethoven night: and perhaps the Manager of Messrs. Lyons
      after Diva's discourse. I shall send my Town Council
      complimentary seats in the first row for the inaugural
      lecture. How does that strike you for a rough sketch? You
      know how I value your judgment, and it is most important to
      get the initial steps right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was standing by her table, suppressing a yawn as he
      glanced at the schedule, and feeling in his waistcoat
      pocket for his gun-metal match-box with the turquoise
      latch. As he scooped for it, there dropped out the silver
      top of Major Benjy's riding whip, which he always kept on
      his person. It fell noiselessly on the piece of damp sponge
      which Mrs. Simpson always preferred to use for moistening
      postage-stamps, rather than the less genteel human tongue.
      Simultaneously the telephone-bell rang, and Lucia jumped
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That incessant summons!" she said. "A perfect slavery. I
      think I must take my name off the exchange, and give my
      number to just a few friends . . . Yes, yes, I am the Mayor
      of Tilling. Irene, is it? . . . My dear how colossal! I
      don't suppose anybody in Tilling has ever had a picture in
      the Royal Academy before. Is that the amended version of
      your fresco, Venus with no clothes on coming to Tilling?
      I'm sure this one is far nicer. How I wish I had seen it
      before you sent it in, but when the Academy closes you must
      show it at our picture-exhibition here. Oh, I've put you
      down to give a lecture in my Mayoral course of Culture on
      the technique of painting in fresco. And you're going up to
      London for varnishing day? Do take care. So many pictures
      have been ruined by being varnished too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accepted, is it?" said Georgie in great excitement.
      "There'll be wigs on the green if it's exhibited here. I
      believe I told you about it, but you were wrestling with
      the Royal Fish Express. Elizabeth, unmistakable, in a shawl
      and bonnet and striped skirt and button-boots, standing on
      an oyster-shell, and being blown into Tilling by Benjy in a
      top-hat among the clouds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, that sounds rather dangerously topical," said
      Lucia. "But it's time to dress. The Mapp-Flints are dining,
      aren't they? What a coincidence!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They had a most harmonious dinner, with never a mention of
      bicycles. Benjy readily consented to read a paper on
      tiger-shooting on May 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, what a joy," said Lucia. "I will book it. And some
      properties perhaps, to give vividness. The riding-whip with
      which you hit the tiger in the face. Oh, how stupid of me.
      I had forgotten about its mysterious disappearance which
      was never cleared up. Pass me the sugar, Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary pause, and Lucia grew very red in the
      face as she buried her orange in sugar. But that was soon
      over, and presently the Mayor and Mayoress went out to the
      garden-room with interlaced waists and arms. Lucia had told
      Georgie not to stop too long in the dining-room and Benjy
      made the most of his time and drank a prodigious quantity
      of a sound but inexpensive port. Elizabeth had eaten a
      dried fig for dessert, and a minute but adamantine fig-seed
      had lodged itself at the base of one of her beautiful
      teeth. She knew she would not have a tranquil moment till
      she had evicted it, and she needed only a few seconds
      unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Worship," she said. "Give me a treat, and let your
      hands just stray over the piano. Haven't heard you play for
      ever so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia never needed pressing and opened the lid of the
      instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm terribly rusty, I'm afraid," she said, "for I get no
      time for practising nowadays. Beethoven, dear, or a morsel
      of precious Mozart; whichever you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, prettioth Mothart, pleath," mumbled Elizabeth, who had
      effaced herself behind Lucia's business table. A moment
      sufficed, and her eye, as she turned round towards the
      piano again and drank in precious Mozart, fell on Mrs.
      Simpson's piece of damp sponge. Something small and bright,
      long-lost and familiar, gleamed there. Hesitation would
      have been mere weakness (besides, it belonged to her
      husband). She reached out a stealthy hand, and put it
      inside her bead-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was barely eleven when the party broke up, for Elizabeth
      was totally unable to concentrate on cards when her bag
      contained the lock, if not the key to the unsolved mystery,
      and she insisted that dear Worship looked very tired. But
      both she and Benjy were very tired before they had framed
      and been forced to reject all the hypotheses which could
      account for the reappearance in so fantastic a place of
      this fragment of the riding-whip. If the relic had come to
      light in one of Diva's jam-puffs, the quality of the
      mystery would have been less baffling, for at least it
      would have been found on the premises where it was lost,
      but how it had got to Lucia's table was as inexplicable as
      the doctrine of Freewill. They went over the ground five or
      six times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia wasn't even present when it vanished," said
      Elizabeth as the clock struck midnight. "Often, as you
      know, I think Worship is not quite as above-board as I
      should wish a colleague to be, but here I do not suspect
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjy poured himself out some whisky. Finding that
      Elizabeth was far too absorbed in speculation to notice
      anything that was going on round her, he hastily drank it,
      and poured out some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pillson then," he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I rang him up that night from Diva's, as he was going
      to his bath," said she, "and he denied knowing anything
      about it. He's fairly truthful--far more truthful than
      Worship anyhow--as far as I've observed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diva then," said Benjy, quietly strengthening his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I searched and I searched, and she had not been out of
      my sight for five minutes. And where's the rest of it? One
      could understand the valuable silver cap
      disappearing--though I don't say for a moment that Diva
      would have stolen it--but it's just that part that has
      reappeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All mos' mysterious," said Benjy. "But wo'll you do next,
      Liz? There's the cruksh. Wo'll you do next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjy had not observed that the Mayoress was trembling
      slightly, like a motor-bicycle before it starts. Otherwise
      he would not have been so surprised when she sprang up with
      a loud crow of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it," she cried. "<i>Eureka!</i> as Worship so often
      says when she's thought of nothing at all. Don't say a word
      to anybody, Benjy, about the silver cap, but have a fresh
      cane put into it, and use it as a property (isn't that the
      word?) at your tiger-talk, just as if it had never been
      lost. That'll be a bit of puzzle-work for guilty persons,
      whoever they may be. And it may lead to something in the
      way of discovery. The thief may turn pale or red or betray
      himself in some way . . . What a time of night!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzle-work began next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make out what's happened to it," said Georgie, in
      a state of fuss, as he came down very late to breakfast,
      "and Foljambe can't either."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave an annoyed glance at the clock. It was five
      minutes to ten; Georgie was getting lazier and lazier in
      the morning. She gave the special peal of silvery laughter
      in which mirth played a minor part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good afternoon, <i>caro,"</i> she said sarcastically.
      "Quite rested? Capital!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie did not like her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm rather tired still," he said. "I shall have a nap
      after breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia abandoned her banter, as he did not seem to
      appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've finished," she said. "Poor Worship has got to
      go and dictate to Mrs. Simpson. And what was it you and
      Foljambe couldn't find?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The silver top to Benjy's riding-whip. I was sure it was
      in my yesterday's waistcoat pocket, but it isn't, and
      Foljambe and I have been through all my suits. Nowhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how very queer," she said. "When did you see it
      last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some time yesterday," he said, opening a letter. A bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll turn up. Things do," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still rather vexed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem to be better at vanishing," he said. "There was
      Blue Birdie--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the second of his letters, and the thought of
      riding-whip and Blue Birdie alike were totally expunged
      from his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he cried. "You'd never guess. Olga Bracely.
      She's back from her world-tour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pretended to recall distant memories. She actually
      had the most vivid recollection of Olga Bracely, and, not
      less, of Georgie's unbounded admiration of her in his
      bachelor days. She wished the world-tour had been longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Olga Bracely?" she said vaguely. "Ah, yes. Prima donna.
      Charming voice; some notes lovely. So she's got back. How
      nice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and she's going to sing at Covent Garden next month,"
      continued Georgie, deep in her letter. "They're producing
      Cortese's opera, <i>Lucrezia,</i> on May the twentieth. Oh,
      she'll give us seats in her box. It's a gala performance.
      Isn't that too lovely? And she wants us to come and stay
      with her at Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, most kind of her," said Lucia. "The dear thing!
      But she doesn't realize how difficult it is for me to get
      away from Tilling while I am Mayor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose she has the slightest idea that you are
      Mayor," said Georgie, beginning to read the letter over
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I forgot," said Lucia. "She has been on a world tour,
      you told me. And as for going up to hear
      <i>Lucrezia</i>--though it's very kind of her--I think we
      must get out of it. Cortese brought it down to Riseholme, I
      remember, as soon as he had finished it, and dear Olga
      begged me to come and hear her sing the great scene--I
      think she called it--and, oh, that cacophonous evening! Ah!
      <i>Eureka!</i> Did you not say the date was May the
      twentieth? How providential! That's the very evening we
      have fixed for my lecture on Beethoven. Olga will
      understand how impossible it is to cancel that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's quite easily altered," said Georgie. "You made
      out just the roughest schedule, and Benjy's tiger-slaying
      is the only date fixed. And think of hearing the gala
      performance in London! <i>Lucrezia's</i> had the hugest
      success in America and Australia. And in Berlin and Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's decisive mind wavered. She saw herself sitting in a
      prominent box at Covent Garden, with all her seed-pearls
      and her Mayoral badge. Reporters would be eager to know who
      she was, and she would be careful to tell the
      box-attendant, so that they could find out without
      difficulty. And at Tilling, what <i>réclame</i> to have
      gone up to London on the prima donna's invitation to hear
      this performance of the world-famous <i>Lucrezia.</i> She
      might give an interview to the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> about
      it when she got back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course we must go," continued Georgie. "But she wants
      to know at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Lucia hesitated. It would be almost as magnificent to
      tell Tilling that she had refused Olga's invitation, except
      for the mortifying fact that Tilling would probably not
      believe her. And if she refused, what would Georgie do?
      Would he leave her to lecture on Beethoven all by herself,
      or would he loyally stand by her, and do his part in the
      four-handed pianoforte arrangement of the Fifth Symphony?
      He furnished the answer to that unspoken question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry if you find it impossible to go," he said quite
      firmly, "but I shall go anyhow. You can play bits of the
      Moonlight by yourself. You've often said it was another key
      to Beethoven's soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly struck Lucia that Georgie seemed not to care
      two hoots whether she went or not. Her sensitive ear could
      not detect the smallest regret in his voice, and the
      prospect of his going alone was strangely distasteful. She
      did not fear any temperamental disturbance; Georgie's
      passions were not volcanic, but there was glitter and
      glamour in opera houses and prima donnas which might upset
      him if he was unchaperoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try to manage it somehow, dear, for your sake," she
      said, "for I know how disappointed you would be if I didn't
      join you in Olga's welcome to London. Dear me; I've been
      keeping Mrs. Simpson waiting a terrible time. Shall I take
      Olga's letter and dictate a grateful acceptance from both
      of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother," said Georgie. "I'll do it. You're much too
      busy. And as for that bit of Benjy's riding-whip, I daresay
      it will turn up."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The prospectus of the Mayoral series of cultural lectures
      at the Literary Institute was re-cast, for the other
      lecturers, wildly excited at the prospect, found every
      night equally convenient. Mrs. Simpson was supplied with
      packets of tickets, and books of receipts and counterfoils
      for those who sent a shilling for a single lecture or five
      shillings for the whole course. She arrived now at
      half-past nine o'clock so as to be ready for the Mayor's
      dictation of official correspondence at ten, and had always
      got through this additional work by that time.
      Complimentary tickets in the front row were sent to Town
      Councillors for Lucia's inaugural lecture, with the request
      that they should be returned if the recipient found himself
      unable to attend. Apart from these, the sale was very
      sluggish. Mr. John Gielgud could not attend the lecture on
      Shakespearian technique, and previous engagements prevented
      the Bishop and Sir Henry Wood from listening to the Padre
      on Free Will and Lucia on Beethoven. But luckily the
      <i>Hampshire Argus</i> had already announced that they had
      received invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming letters from them all, Georgie," said Lucia,
      tearing them up, "and their evident disappointment at not
      being able to come really touches me. And I don't regret,
      far from it, that apparently we shall not have very large
      audiences. A small audience is more <i>intime;</i> the
      personal touch is more quickly established. And now for my
      sleep-walking scene in the first lecture. I should like to
      discuss that with you. I shall give that with Elizabethan
      realism."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not pyjamas?" asked Georgie, in an awestruck voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not: it would be a gross anachronism. But I
      shall have all the lights in the room extinguished. Night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they won't see you," said Georgie. "You would lose
      the personal touch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia puzzled over this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I have it!" she said. "An electric torch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't that be an anachronism, too?" interrupted
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather a pedantic criticism, Georgie," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An electric torch: and as soon as the room is plunged in
      darkness, I shall turn it on to my face. I shall advance
      slowly, only my face visible suspended in the air, to the
      edge of the platform. Eyes open I think: I believe
      sleep-walkers often have their eyes open. Very wide,
      something like this, and unseeing. Filled with an
      expression of internal soul-horror. Have you half an hour
      to spare? Put the lights out, dear: I have my electric
      torch. Now."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As the day for the inaugural lecture drew near and the
      bookings continued unsatisfactory except from the
      <i>intime</i> point of view, Lucia showered complimentary
      tickets right and left. Grosvenor and Foljambe received
      them and Diva's Janet. In fact, those who had purchased
      tickets felt defrauded, since so many were to be had
      without even asking for them. This discontent reached
      Lucia's ears, and in an ecstasy of fair-mindedness she paid
      Mrs. Simpson the sum of one shilling for each complimentary
      ticket she had sent out. But even that did not silence the
      carpings of Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What it really comes to, Diva," she said, "is that Worship
      is paying everybody to attend her lecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind," said Diva. "She is taking seats for
      her lecture, and giving them to her friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much the same thing," said Elizabeth, "but we won't argue.
      Of course she'll take the same number for Benjy's lecture
      and yours and all the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see why, if, as you say, she's only paying people to
      go to hers. Major Benjy can pay people to go to his."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth softened at the thought of the puzzle that would
      rack the brains of Tilling when Benjy lectured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dear boy is quite excited about it," she said. "He's
      going to have his tiger skins hung up behind the platform
      to give local jungle-colour. He's copied out his lecture
      twice already and is thinking of having it typed. I daresay
      Worship would allow Mrs. Simpson to do it for nothing to
      fill up her time a little. He read it to me: most dramatic.
      How I shuddered when he told how he had hit the man-slayer
      across the nose while he seized his rifle. Such a pity he
      can't whack that very tiger-skin with the riding-whip he
      used then. He's never quite got over its loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth eyed Diva narrowly and thought she looked very
      uncomfortable, as if she knew something about that loss.
      But she replied in the most spirited manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't be very wise of him," she said. "Might take a lot
      more of the fur off. Might hurt the dead tiger more than he
      hurt the live one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very droll," said Elizabeth. "But as the riding-whip
      vanished so mysteriously in your house, there's the end of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to Lucia's prudent distribution of complimentary
      tickets, the room was very well filled at the inaugural
      lecture. Georgie for a week past had been threatened with a
      nervous collapse at the thought of taking the chair, but he
      had staved this off by patent medicines, physical exercises
      and breakfast in bed. Wearing his ruby-coloured dinner
      suit, he told the audience in a firm and audible voice that
      any introductory words from him were quite unnecessary, as
      they all knew the lecturer so well. He then revealed the
      astonishing fact that she was their beloved Mayor of
      Tilling, the woman whom he had the honour to call wife. She
      would now address them on the Technique of the
      Shakespearian Stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia first gave them a brief and lucid definition of Drama
      as the audible and visible presentation of situations of
      human woe or weal, based on and developing from those
      dynamic individual forces which evoke the psychological
      clashes of temperament that give rise to action. This
      action (drama) being strictly dependent on the underlying
      motives which prompt it and on emotional stresses might be
      roughly summed up as Plot. It was important that her
      audience should grasp that quite clearly. She went on to
      say that anything that distracts attention from Plot or
      from the psychology of which it is the logical outcome,
      hinders rather than helps Drama, and therefore the modern
      craze for elaborate decorations and embellishments must be
      ruthlessly condemned. It was otherwise in Shakespeare's
      day. There was hardly any scenery for the setting of his
      masterpieces, and she ventured to put forward a theory
      which had hitherto escaped the acumen of more erudite
      Shakespearian scholars than she. Shakespeare was a staunch
      upholder of this simplicity and had unmistakably shewn that
      in <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i> In that glorious
      masterpiece a play was chosen for the marriage festival at
      Athens, and the setting of it clearly proved Shakespeare's
      conviction that the less distraction of scenery there was
      on the stage, the better for Drama. The moon appeared in
      this play within a play. Modern <i>decor</i> would have
      provided a luminous disk moving slowly across the sky by
      some mechanical device. Not so Shakespeare. A man came on
      with a lantern, and told them that his lantern was the moon
      and he the man in the moon. There he was static and
      undistracting. Again the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe were
      separated by a wall. Modern <i>decor</i> would have
      furnished a convincing edifice covered with climbing roses.
      Not so Shakespeare. A man came out of the wings and said "I
      am the wall." The lovers required a chink to talk through.
      The wall held up his hand and parted his fingers. Thus, in
      the guise of a jest the Master poured scorn on elaborate
      scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will now," said Lucia, "without dress or scenery of any
      sort, give you an illustration of the technique of the
      Shakespearian Stage. Lady Macbeth in the sleepwalking
      scene."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe, previously instructed, was sitting by the
      switch-board, and on a sign from Georgie, plunged the hall
      in darkness. Everybody thought that a fuse had gone. That
      fear was dispelled because Lucia, fumbling in the dark,
      could not find her electric torch, and Georgie called out
      "Turn them on again, Foljambe." Lucia found her torch and
      once more the lights went out. Then the face of the Mayor
      sprang into vivid illumination, suspended against the
      blackness, and her open, sleep-walking eyes gleamed with
      soul-horror in the focused light. A difficult moment came
      when she made the pantomimic washing of her hands for the
      beam went wobbling about all over the place and once fell
      full on Georgie's face, which much embarrassed him. He
      deftly took the torch from her and duly controlled its
      direction. At the end of the speech Foljambe restored the
      lights, and Lucia went on with her lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the absence of distinguished strangers she did not
      give a supper-party afterwards, at which her subject could
      be further discussed and illuminated, but she was in a
      state of high elation herself as she and Georgie partook of
      a plain supper alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the first moment," she said, waving a sandwich, "I
      knew that I was in touch with my audience and held them in
      my hand. A delicious sensation of power and expansion,
      Georgie; it is no use my trying to describe it to you, for
      you have to experience it to understand it. I regret that
      the <i>Hampshire Argus</i> cannot have a verbatim report in
      its issue this week. Mr. McConnell--how he enjoyed it--told
      me that it went to press to-night. I said I quite
      understood, and should not think of asking him to hold it
      up. I gave him the full typescript for next week, and
      promised to let him have a close-up photograph of Lady
      Macbeth; just my face with the background blacked out. He
      thanked me most warmly. And I thought, didn't you, that I
      did the sleep-walking scene at the right moment, just after
      I had been speaking of Shakespearian simplicity. A little
      earlier than I had meant, but I suddenly felt that it came
      there. I <i>knew</i> it came there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very place for it," said Georgie, vividly recalling
      her catechism after the Mayoral banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that little <i>contretemps</i> about the light going
      out before I had found my torch--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wasn't my fault," said he. "You told me to signal to
      Foljambe, when you said 'sleep walking scene.' That was my
      cue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, of course it wasn't your fault," said Lucia
      warmly. "You were punctuality itself. I was only thinking
      how fortunate that was. The audience knew what was coming,
      and that made the suspense greater. The rows of upturned
      faces, Georgie; the suspense; I could see the strain in
      their eyes. And in the speech, I think I got, didn't I,
      that veiled timbre in my voice suggestive of the
      unconscious physical mechanism, sinking to a strangled
      whisper at 'Out, damned spot!' That, I expect, was not
      quite original, for I now remember when I was quite a child
      being taken to see Ellen Terry in the part and she veiled
      her voice like that. A sub-conscious impression coming to
      the surface."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must tell me more of what you thought to-morrow,
      dear," she said, "for I must go to bed. The emotional
      strain has quite worn me out, though it was well worth
      while. Mere mental or physical exertion--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel very tired too," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed Lucia upstairs, waiting while she practised the
      Lady Macbeth face in front of the mirror on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Benjy's lecture took place a week later. There was a palm
      tree beside his reading desk and his three tiger-skins hung
      on the wall behind. "Very effective, Georgie," said Lucia,
      as they took their seats in the middle of the front row.
      "Quite the Shakespearian tradition. It brings the jungle to
      us, the heat of the Indian noon-day, the buzz of insects. I
      feel quite stifled." . . . He marched on to the platform,
      carrying a rifle, and wearing a pith helmet and saluted the
      audience. He described himself as a plain old campaigner,
      who had seen a good deal of shikarri in his time, and read
      them a series of exciting adventures. Then (what a climax!)
      he took up from his desk a cane riding-whip with a silver
      top and pointed to the third of the skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that old villain," he said, "nearly prevented my
      having the honour to speak to you to-night. I had just sat
      down to a bit of tiffin, putting my rifle aside, when he
      was on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He whisked round and gave the head of the tiger-skin a
      terrific whack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I slashed at him, just like that, with my riding-whip
      which I had in my hand, and that gave me the half-second I
      needed to snatch up my rifle. I fired point-blank at his
      heart, and he rolled over dead. And this, ladies and
      gentlemen, is what saved my life. It may interest you to
      see it, though it is familiar to some of you. I will pass
      it round."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the applause and drank some whisky and a little
      soda. Lucia took the riding-whip from him, and passed it to
      Georgie, Georgie passed it to Diva. They all carefully
      examined the silver-top, and the initials B. F. were
      engraved on it. There could be no doubt of its genuineness
      and they all became very still and thoughtful, forbearing
      to look at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was loud applause at the end of the lecture, and
      after making rather a long speech, thanking the lecturer,
      Lucia turned to Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to lunch to-morrow," she whispered. "Just us three. I
      am utterly puzzled . . . Ah, Major Benjy, marvellous! What
      a treat! I have never been so thrilled. Dear Elizabeth, how
      proud you must be of him. He ought to have that lecture
      printed, not a word, not a syllable altered, and read it to
      the Royal Zoological Society. They would make him an
      honorary member at once."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Next day at a secret session in the garden-room Georgie and
      Diva contributed their personal share in the strange
      history of the relic (Paddy's being taken for granted, as
      no other supposition would fit the facts of the case) and
      thus the movements of the silver cap were accounted for up
      to the moment of its disappearance from Georgie's
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always kept it in my waistcoat pocket," he concluded,
      "and one morning it couldn't be found anywhere. You
      remember that, don't you, Lucia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of intense concentration dwelt in Lucia's eyes:
      Georgie did not expect much from that, because it so often
      led to nothing at all. Then she spoke in that veiled voice
      which had become rather common with her since the
      sleep-walking scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," she murmured. "It comes back to me. And the
      evening before Elizabeth and Benjy had dined with us. Did
      it drop out of your pocket, do you think, Georgie? . . .
      She and I came into the garden-room after dinner, and . . .
      and she asked me to play to her, which is unusual. I am
      always unconscious of all else when I am playing . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia dropped the veiled voice which was hard to keep up
      and became very distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sat all by herself at my table here," she continued.
      "What if she found it on the floor or somewhere? I seem to
      sense her doing that. And she had something on her mind
      when we played Bridge. She couldn't attend at all, and she
      suggested stopping before eleven, because she said I looked
      so tired, though I was never fresher. Certainly we never
      saw the silver cap again till last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well that is ingenious," said Diva, "and then I suppose
      they had another cane fitted to it, and Benjy said it was
      the real one. I do call that deceitful. How can we serve
      them out? Let's all think."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all thought. Lucia sat with her head on one side
      contemplating the ceiling, as was her wont when listening
      to music. Then she supplied the music, too, and laughed in
      the silvery ascending scale of an octave and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Amichi,"</i> she said. "If you will leave it to me, I
      think I can arrange something that will puzzle Elizabeth.
      She and her accomplice have thought fit to try to puzzle
      us. I will contrive to puzzle them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How scrumptious!" she said. "Do be quick and tell us,
      because I must get back to help Janet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite complete yet," answered Lucia. "A few finishing
      touches. But trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva trundled away down the hill at top-speed. A party of
      clerical tourists were spending a day of pilgrimage in
      Tilling, and after being shewn round the church by the
      Padre were to refresh themselves at 'ye olde Tea-House.'
      The Padre would have his tea provided gratis as was
      customary with Couriers. She paused for a moment outside
      her house to admire the sign which quaint Irene had painted
      for her. There was nothing nude about it. Queen Anne in
      full regalia was having tea with the Archbishop of
      Canterbury, and decorum reigned. Diva plunged down the
      kitchen-stairs, and peeped into the garden where the tulips
      were now in flower. She wondered which tulip it was.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As often happened in Tilling, affairs of sensational
      interest overlapped. Georgie woke next morning to find
      Foljambe bringing in his early morning tea with the
      <i>Daily Mirror.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "A picture this morning, sir, that'll make you jump," she
      said. "Lor', what'll happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Off she went to fill his bath, and Georgie, still rather
      sleepy, began to look through the paper. On the third page
      was an article on the Royal Academy Exhibition, of which
      the Private View was to be held today.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Picture of the Year," said our Art Editor, "is already
      determined. For daring realism, for withering satire of the
      so-called Victorian age, for savage caricature of the
      simpering, guileless prettiness of such early Italian
      artists as Botticelli, Miss Irene Coles's--" Georgie read
      no more but turned to the centre-page of pictures. There it
      was. Simultaneously there came a rap on his door, and
      Grosvenor's hand, delicately inserted, in case he had got
      up, held a copy of the <i>Times.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her Worship thought you might like to see the picture-page
      of the <i>Times,"</i> she said. "And could you spare her
      the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> if it's got it in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The transfer was effected. There again was Elizabeth on her
      oyster-shell being wafted by Benjy up the river to the quay
      at Tilling, and our Art Editor gave his most serious
      attention to this arresting piece. He was not sure whether
      it was justifiable to parody a noble work of art in order
      to ridicule an age, which, in spite of its fantastic
      prudery, was distinguished for achievement and progress.
      But no one could question the vigour, the daring, the
      exuberant vitality of this amazing canvas. Technically--
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie bounded out of bed. Thoughtful and suggestive
      though this criticism was, it was also lengthy, and the
      need for discussion with Lucia as to the reactions of
      Tilling was more immediate, especially since she had a
      committee-meeting at ten. He omitted to have his bath at
      all, and nearly forgot about his <i>toupée.</i> She was
      already at breakfast when he got down, with the <i>Daily
      Mirror</i> propped up against the tea-pot in front of her,
      and seemed to continue aloud what she must have been saying
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and in my position, I must--good morning, Georgie--be
      extremely careful. She <i>is</i> my Mayoress, and
      therefore, through me, has an official position, which I am
      bound to uphold if it is brought into ridicule. I should
      equally resent any ruthless caricature of the Padre, as he
      is my chaplain. Of course you've seen the picture itself,
      Georgie, which, alas, I never did, and it's hard to form a
      reasoned judgment from a reduced reproduction. Is it really
      like poor Elizabeth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The image," said Georgie. "You could tell it a hundred
      miles off. It's the image of Benjy, too, But that thing in
      his hand, which looks so like the neck of a bottle is
      really the top of his umbrella."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I thought it was a bottle," said Lucia. "I'm glad of
      that. The other would have been a sad lack of taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's all a lack of taste," said Georgie, "though I
      don't quite feel the sadness. On the other hand it's being
      hailed as a masterpiece. That'll sweeten it for them a
      bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia held the paper up to get a longer focus, and Georgie
      got his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wonderful pose," she said. "Really, there's something
      majestic and dominant about Elizabeth, which distinctly
      flatters her. And look at Benjy with his cheeks puffed out,
      as when he's declared three no trumps, and knows he can't
      get them. A boisterous wind evidently, such as often comes
      roaring up the river. Waves tipped with foam. A slight want
      of perspective, I should have said, about the houses of
      Tilling . . . One can't tell how Elizabeth will take it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought one could make a good guess," said
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's something, as you say, to have inspired a
      masterpiece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but Irene's real object was to be thoroughly nasty.
      The critics seem to have found in the picture a lot she
      didn't intend to put there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but who can tell about the artist's mind?" asked
      Lucia, with a sudden attack of high-brow. "Did Messer
      Leonardo really see in the face of La Gioconda all that our
      wonderful Walter Pater found there? Does not the artist
      work in a sort of trance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Irene wasn't in a trance at all," insisted Georgie.
      "Anything but. And as for your feeling that because
      Elizabeth is Mayoress you ought to resent it, that's
      thoroughly inconsistent with your theory that Art's got
      nothing to do with Life. But I'll go down to the High
      Street soon, and see what the general feeling is. You'll be
      late, dear, if you don't go off to your meeting at once. In
      fact, you're late already."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia mounted her bicycle in a great hurry and set off for
      the Town Hall. With every stroke of her pedals she felt
      growing pangs of jealousy of Elizabeth. Why, oh why, had
      not Irene painted her, the Mayor, the first woman who had
      ever been Mayor of Tilling, being wafted up the river, with
      Georgie blowing on her from the clouds?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a picture would have had a far greater historical
      interest, and she would not have resented the grossest
      caricature of herself if only she could have been the
      paramount figure in the Picture of the Year. The town in
      the background would be widely recognised as Tilling, and
      Lucia imagined the eager comments of the crowd swarming
      round the masterpiece . . . "Why that's Tilling! We spent a
      week there this summer. Just like! . . ." "And who can that
      woman be? Clearly a portrait" . . . "Oh, that's the Mayor,
      Lucia Pillson: she was pointed out to me. Lives in a lovely
      family house called Mallards" . . . "And the man in the
      clouds with the Vandyck beard and the red dinner-suit (what
      a colour!) must be her husband . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What fame!" thought Lucia with aching regret. "What
      illimitable, immortal <i>réclame.</i> What publicity to be
      stared at all day by excited crowds!" At this moment the
      Private View would be going on, and Duchesses and
      Archbishops and Cabinet Ministers would soon be jostling to
      get a view of her, instead of Elizabeth and Benjy! "I must
      instantly commission Irene to paint my portrait," she said
      to herself as she dismounted at the steps of the Town Hall.
      "A picture that tells a story I think. A sort of biography.
      In my robes by the front door at Mallards with my hand on
      my bicycle. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave but scant attention to the proceedings at her
      Committee, and mounting again rang the bell all the way
      down the hill into the High Street on a secret errand to
      the haberdashery shop. By a curious coincidence she met
      Major Benjy on the threshold. He was carrying the
      reconstructed riding-whip and was in high elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, your Worship," he said. "Just come to have
      my riding-whip repaired. I gave my old man-eater such a
      swipe at my lecture two nights ago, that I cracked it, by
      Jove."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Major, what a pity!" said Lucia. "But it was almost
      worth breaking it, wasn't it? You produced such a dramatic
      sensation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's another sensation this morning," chuckled
      Benjy. "Have you seen the notice of the Royal Academy in
      the <i>Times?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia still considered that the proper public line to take
      was her sense of the insult to her Mayoress, though
      certainly Benjy seemed very cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have," she said indignantly. "Oh, Major Benjy, it is
      monstrous! I was horrified: I should not have thought it of
      Irene. And the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> too--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, really?" interrupted Benjy. "I must get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a wanton insult to dear Elizabeth," continued Lucia,
      "and, of course, to you up in the clouds. Horrified! I
      shall write to Elizabeth as soon as I get home to convey my
      sympathy and indignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you bother!" cried Benjy. "Liz hasn't been so bucked
      up with anything for years. After all, to be the principal
      feature in the Picture of the Year is a privilege that
      doesn't fall to everybody. Such a leg up for our obscure
      little Tilling, too. We're going up to town next week to
      see it. Why, here's Liz herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth kissed her hand to Lucia from the other side of
      the street, and, waiting till Susan went ponderously by,
      tripped across, and kissed her (Lucia's) face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a red-letter day, dear!" she cried. "Quaint Irene
      suddenly becoming so world-wide, and your humble little
      Mayoress almost equally so. Benjy, it's in the <i>Daily
      Telegraph,</i> too. You'd better get a copy of every
      morning paper. Pop in, and tell them to mend your
      riding-whip, while I send a telegram of congratulation to
      Irene.--I should think Burlington House, London, would find
      her now--and meet me at the paper-shop. And do persuade
      Irene, Worship, to let us have the picture for our
      exhibition here, when the Academy's over, unless the
      Chantrey Bequest buys it straight away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjy went into the haberdasher's to get the riding-whip
      repaired. This meeting with him just here made Lucia's
      errand much simpler. She followed him into the shop and
      became completely absorbed in umbrellas till he went out
      again. Then, with an eye on the door, she spoke to the
      shopman in a confidential tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you," she said, "to make me an exact copy of Major
      Mapp-Flint's pretty riding-whip. Silver top with the same
      initials on it. Quite private, you understand: it's a
      little surprise for a friend. And send it, please, to me at
      Mallards House, as soon as it's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia mounted her bicycle and rode thoughtfully homewards.
      Since Elizabeth and Benjy both took this gross insult to
      her Mayoress as the highest possible compliment, and longed
      to have quaint Irene's libel on them exhibited here, there
      was no need that she should make herself indignant or
      unhappy for their sakes. Indeed, she understood their
      elation, and her regret that Irene had not caricatured her
      instead of Elizabeth grew very bitter: she would have borne
      it with a magnanimity fully equal to their's. It was a
      slight consolation to know that the replica of the
      riding-whip was in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out into the garden-room where patient Mrs.
      Simpson was waiting for her. There were invitations to be
      sent out for an afternoon party next week to view the
      beauties of Lucia's spring-garden, for which she wanted to
      rouse the envious admiration of her friends, and the list
      must be written out. Then there was a letter to Irene of
      warm congratulation to be typed. Then the Committee of the
      Museum, of which the Mayor was Chairman was to meet on
      Friday, and she gave Mrs. Simpson the key of the tin-box
      labelled "Museum".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just look in it, Mrs. Simpson," she said, "and see if
      there are any papers I ought to glance through. A mountain
      of work, I fear, to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you see Mrs. Wyse for a moment?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia knitted her brows, and consulted her engagement-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just for ten minutes," she said. "Ask her to come out
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor went back into the house to fetch Susan, and
      simultaneously Mrs. Simpson gave a shriek of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The corpse of a blue parakeet," she cried, "and an awful
      smell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sprang from her seat. She plucked Blue Birdie,
      exhaling disinfectant and decay, from the Museum box, and
      scudding across the room thrust it into the fire. She poked
      and battered it down among the glowing embers, and even as
      she wrought she cursed herself for not having told Mrs.
      Simpson to leave it where it was and lock the Museum box
      again, but it was too late for that. In that swift journey
      to cremation Blue Birdie had dropped a plume or two, and
      from the fire came a vivid smell of burned feathers. But
      she was just in time and had resumed her seat and taken up
      her pen as Susan came ponderously up the steps into the
      garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear," said Lucia. "At my eternal tasks as
      usual, but charmed to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose in welcome, and to her horror saw a long blue
      tail-feather (slightly tinged with red) on the carpet. She
      planted her foot upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning," said Susan. "What a horrid smell of burned
      feathers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sniffed, still standing firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do smell something," she said. "Gas, surely. I thought I
      smelt it the other day. I must send for my town-surveyor.
      Do you not smell gas, Mrs. Simpson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia focused on her secretary the full power of her
      gimlet-eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, gas," said that loyal woman, locking the Museum
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most disagreeable," said Lucia, advancing on Susan. "Let
      us go into the garden and have our little talk there. I
      know what you've come about: Irene's picture. The Picture
      of the Year, they say. Elizabeth is famous at last, and is
      skipping for joy. I am so pleased for her sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should certainly have said burned feathers," repeated
      Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dire speculations flitted through Lucia's mind: would
      Susan's vague but retentive brain begin to grope after a
      connection between burned feathers and her vanished bird? A
      concentration of force and volubility was required, and
      taking another step forward on to another blue feather, she
      broke into a gabble of topics as she launched Susan, like a
      huge liner, down the slip of the garden-room stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Susan, gas," she said. "And have you seen the
      reproduction of Irene's picture in the <i>Times?</i> Mrs.
      Simpson, would you kindly bring the <i>Times</i> into the
      garden. You must stroll across the lawn and have a peep at
      my daffodils in my <i>giardino segreto.</i> Never have I
      had such a show. Those lovely lines 'dancing with the
      daffodils'. How true! I saw you in the High Street this
      morning, dear, on your tricycle. And such wallflowers; they
      will be in fullest bloom for my party next week, to which
      you and Mr. Wyse must come. And Benjy in the clouds; so
      like, but Georgie says it isn't a bottle, but his umbrella.
      Tell me <i>exactly</i> what you think of it all. So
      important that I should know what Tilling feels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to withstand such a cataract of subjects, Susan
      could hardly say 'burned feathers' again. She showed a
      tendency to drift towards the garden-room on their return,
      but Lucia, like a powerful tug, edged her away from that
      dangerous shoal and towed her out to the front door of
      Mallards, where she cast her adrift to propel her tricycle
      under her own steam. Then returning to the garden-room, she
      found that the admirable Mrs. Simpson had picked up a few
      more feathers, which she had laid on Lucia's blotting-pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia threw them into the fire and swept up some
      half-burned fragments from the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The smell of gas seems quite gone, Mrs. Simpson," she
      said. "No need, I think, to send for my town-surveyor. It
      is such a pleasure to work with anyone who understands me
      as well as you . . . Yes, the list for my garden-party."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The replica of the riding-whip was delivered, and looked
      identical. Lucia's disposition of it was singular. After
      she had retired for the night, she tied it safely up among
      the foliage of the Clematis Montana which grew thickly up
      to the sill of her bedroom window. The silver top soon grew
      tarnished in this exposure, spiders spun threads about it,
      moisture dulled its varnished shaft, and it became a
      weathered object. "About ripe," said Lucia to herself one
      morning, and rang up Elizabeth and Benjy, inviting them to
      tea at ye olde tea-house next day, with Bridge to follow.
      They had just returned from their visit to London to see
      the Picture of the Year, and accepted with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting for Diva's, Lucia took her umbrella up to
      her bedroom, and subsequently carried it to the tea-room,
      arriving there ten minutes before the others. Diva was busy
      in the kitchen, and she looked into the card-room. Yes:
      there was the heavy cupboard with claw feet standing in the
      corner; perfect. Her man&oelig;uvres then comprised opening
      her umbrella and furling it again; and hearing Diva's firm
      foot on the kitchen stairs she came softly back into the
      tea-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diva, <i>what</i> a delicious smell!" she said. "Oh, I
      want eighteen-penny teas. I came a few minutes early to
      tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckoned on that," said Diva. "The smell is waffles. I've
      been practising. Going to make waffles at my lecture, as an
      illustration, if I can do them over a spirit-lamp. Hand
      them round to the front row. Good advertisement. Here are
      the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waffles were a greater success than Diva had
      anticipated, and the compliments hardly made up for the
      consumption. Then they adjourned to the card-room, and
      Lucia, leaning her umbrella against the wall let it slip
      behind the big cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So clumsy!" she said, "but never mind it now. We shall
      have to move the cupboard afterwards. Cut? You and I,
      Georgie. Families. Happy families."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was chatty Bridge at first, rich in agreeable
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We only got back from London yesterday," said Elizabeth,
      dealing. "Such a rush, but we went to the Academy three
      times; one no trump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two spades," said Georgie. "What did you think of the
      Picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a crowd round it! We had to scriggle in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm blest if I don't believe that they recognised
      Liz," put in Major Benjy. "A couple of women looked at her
      and then at the picture and back again, and whispered
      together, by Jove."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure they recognised me at our second visit," said
      Elizabeth. "The crowd was thicker than ever, and we got
      quite wedged in. Such glances and whisperings all round.
      Most entertaining, wasn't it, Benjy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia tried to cork up her bitterness, but failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>am</i> glad you enjoyed it so much, dear," she said.
      "How I envy you your superb self-confidence. I should find
      such publicity quite insupportable. I should have scriggled
      out again at whatever cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Worship, I don't think you would if you ever found
      yourself in such a position," said Elizabeth. "You would
      face it. So brave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we're playing Bridge, two spades was what I said. Ever
      so long ago," announced Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Georgie; apologies," said Elizabeth. "I'm such a
      chatterbox. What do you bid, Benjy? Don't be so slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two no trumps," said Benjy. "We made our third visit
      during lunch-time, when there were fewer people--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three spades," said Lucia. "All I meant, dear Elizabeth,
      was that it is sufficient for me to tackle my little bit of
      public service, quietly and humbly and obscurely--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So like you, dear," retorted Elizabeth, "and I double
      three spades. That'll be a nice little bit for you to
      tackle quietly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made no reply, but the pleasant atmosphere was now
      charged with perilous stuff, for on the one side the Mayor
      was writhing with envy at the recognition of Elizabeth from
      the crowds round the Picture of the Year, while the
      Mayoress was writhing with exasperation at Lucia's pitiful
      assertion that she shunned publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia won the doubled contract and the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there's my little bit, Georgie," she said, "and you
      played it very carefully, though of course it was a sitter.
      I ought to have redoubled: forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benjy, your finesse was idiotic," said Elizabeth, palpably
      wincing. "If you had played your ace, they'd have been two
      down. Probably more.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what about your doubling?" asked Benjy. "And what
      about your original no-trump?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thoroughly justified, both of them," said Elizabeth, "if
      you hadn't finessed. Cut to me, please, Worship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you've just dealt, dear," cooed Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw, Haw. Well tried, Liz," said Benjy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked so deadly at Benjy's gentle fun that at
      the end of the hand Lucia loaded her with compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautifully played, dear!" she said. "Did you notice,
      Georgie, how Elizabeth kept putting the lead with you?
      Masterly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was not to be appeased with that sort of blarney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear," she said. "I'm sorry, Benjy: I ought to
      have put the lead with Worship, and taken another trick."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Diva came in as they were finishing the last rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a lot of teas," she said. "But they all come in so
      late now. Hungrier, I suppose. Saves them supper. No more
      waffles for shilling teas. Not if I know it. Too popular."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had won from the whole table, and with an indifferent
      air she swept silver and copper into her bag without
      troubling to count it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be off," she said. "I have pages of Borough
      expenditure to look through. Oh, my umbrella! I nearly
      forgot it."
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Dear Worship,'' asked Elizabeth. "Do tell me what that
      means! Either you forget a thing, or you don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I let it slip behind your big cupboard, Diva," said Lucia,
      not taking the slightest notice of her Mayoress. "Catch
      hold of that end, Georgie, and we'll run it out from the
      wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me," said Benjy, taking Lucia's end. "Now then,
      with a heave-ho, as they say in the sister service. One,
      two, three."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a tremendous tug. The cupboard, not so heavy as it
      looked, glided away from the wall with an interior rattle
      of crockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my things!" cried Diva. "Do be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your umbrella," said Georgie. "Covered with dust .
      . . Why, what's this? Major Benjy's riding whip, isn't it?
      Lost here ages ago. Well, that is queer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva simply snatched it from Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is!" she cried. "Initials, everything. Must have
      lain here all this time. But at your lecture the other day
      Major--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia instantly interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fortunate discovery!" she said. "How glad you will
      be, Major, to get your precious relic back. Why it's
      half-past seven! Good night everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Georgie let themselves out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you <i>must</i> tell me," said he, as they walked
      briskly up the hill. "I shall die if you don't tell me. How
      did you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? What do you mean?" asked the aggravating woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too tarsome," said Georgie crossly. "And it isn't
      fair. Diva told you how she buried the silver cap, and I
      told you how I dug it up, and you tell us nothing. Very
      miserly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was startled at the ill-humour in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I was only teasing you--" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well it doesn't amuse me to be teased," he snapped at her.
      "You're like Elizabeth sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, what a monstrous thing to say to me! Of course,
      I'll tell you, and Diva, too. Ring her up and ask her to
      pop in after dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused with her hand on the door of Mallards. "But
      never hint to the poor Mapp-Flints," she said, "as Diva did
      just now, that the riding-whip Benjy used at his lecture
      couldn't have been the real one. They knew that quite well,
      and they knew we know it. Much more excruciating for them
      <i>not</i> to rub it in."

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, followed by Georgie, and preceded by an attendant,
      swept along the corridor behind the boxes on the grand tier
      at Covent Garden Opera House. They had dined early at their
      hotel and were in good time. She wore her seed-pearls in
      her hair, her gold Mayoral badge, like an Order, on her
      breast, and her gown was of a rich, glittering russet hue
      like cloth of copper. A competent-looking lady, hovering
      about with a small note book and a pencil, hurried up to
      her as the attendant opened the door of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name, please," he said to Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Mayor of Tilling," said Lucia, raising her voice for
      the benefit of the lady with the note book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He consulted his list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No such name, ma'am," he said. "Madam has given strict
      orders--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. and Mrs. Pillson," suggested Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, sir "; and in they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was gleaming with tiaras and white shoulders, and
      loud with conversation. Lucia stood for a minute at the
      front of the box which was close to the stage, and nodded
      and smiled as she looked this way and that, as if
      recognising friends . . . But, oh, to think that she might
      have been recognised, too, if only Irene had portrayed her
      in the Picture of the Year! They had been to see it this
      afternoon, and Georgie, also, had felt pangs of regret that
      it was not he with his Vandyck beard who sprawled windily
      among the clouds. But in spite of that he was very happy
      for in a few minutes now he would hear and see his adorable
      Olga again, and they were to lunch with her to-morrow at
      her hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of applause hailed the appearance of Cortese,
      composer, librettist and, to-night, conductor of
      <i>Lucrezia.</i> Lucia waggled her hand at him. He
      certainly bowed in her direction (for he was bowing in all
      directions), and she made up her mind to scrap her previous
      verdict on the opera and be enchanted with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Royal party unfortunately invisible from Lucia's box
      arrived, and after the National Anthem the first slow notes
      of the overture wailed on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divine!" she whispered to Georgie. "How well I remember
      dear Signor Cortese playing it to me at Riseholme. I think
      he took it a shade faster . . . There! Lucrezia's motif, or
      is it the Pope's? Tragic splendour. The first composer in
      Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Georgie had not known Lucia so well, he would scarcely
      have believed his ears. On that frightful evening, three
      years ago, when Olga had asked her to come and hear "bits"
      of it, she had professed herself outraged at the hideous,
      modern stuff, but there were special circumstances on that
      occasion which conduced to pessimism. Lucia had let it be
      widely supposed that she talked Italian with ease and
      fluency, but when confronted with Cortese, it was painfully
      clear that she could not understand a word he said. An
      awful exposure . . . Now she was in a prominent box, guest
      of the prima donna, at this gala performance, she could not
      be called upon to talk to Cortese without annoying the
      audience very much, and she was fanatic in admiration. She
      pressed Georgie's hand, emotion drowning utterance; she
      rose in her place at the end of Olga's great song in the
      first act, crying "Brava! Brava!" in the most correct
      Italian, and was convinced that she led the applause that
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the course of the second act, the box was invaded by
      a large lady, clad in a magnificent tiara, but not much
      else, and a small man, who hid himself at the back. Lucia
      felt justly indignant at this interruption, but softened
      when the box-attendant appeared with another programme, and
      distinctly said "Your Grace" to the large lady. That made a
      difference, and during the interval Lucia talked very
      pleasantly to her (for when strangers were thrown together
      stiffness was ridiculous) and told her how she had heard
      her beloved Olga run through some of her part before the
      opera was produced, and that she had prophesied a huge
      success for it. She was agonising to know what the large
      lady was the Grace of, but could scarcely put so personal a
      question on such short acquaintance. She did not seem a
      brilliant conversationalist, but stared rather fixedly at
      Georgie . . . At the end of the opera there was immense
      enthusiasm: Olga and Cortese were recalled again and again,
      and during these effusions, Her unidentified Grace and her
      companion left: Lucia presumed that they were husband and
      wife as they took no notice of each other. She regretted
      their disappearance, but consoled herself with the
      reflection that their names would appear in the dazzling
      list of those who would be recorded in the press to-morrow
      as having attended the first performance of
      <i>Lucrezia.</i> The competent female in the corridor would
      surely see to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie lay long awake that night. The music had excited
      him, and, more than the music, Olga herself. What a voice,
      what an exquisite face and presence, what an infinite
      charm! He recalled his bachelor days at Riseholme, when
      Lucia had been undisputed Queen of that highly-cultured
      village and he her <i>cavaliere servente,</i> whose
      allegiance had been seriously shaken by Olga's advent. He
      really had been in love with her, he thought, and the fact
      that she had a husband alive then, to whom she was devoted,
      allowed a moral man like him to indulge his emotions in
      complete security. It had thrilled him with daring joy to
      imagine that, had Olga been free, he would have asked her
      to marry him, but even in those flights of fancy he knew
      that her acceptance of him would have put him in a panic.
      Since then, of course, he had been married himself, but his
      union with Lucia had not been formidable, as they had
      agreed that no ardent tokens of affection were to mar their
      union. Marriage, in fact, with Lucia might be regarded as a
      vow of celibacy. Now, after three years, the situation was
      reversing itself in the oddest manner. Olga's husband had
      died and she was free, while his own marriage with Lucia
      protected him. His high moral principles would never suffer
      him to be unfaithful to his wife. "I am not that sort of
      man," he said to himself. "I must go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed and turned on his bed. Visions of Olga as he had
      seen her to-night floated behind his closed eyelids. Olga
      as a mere girl at the fête of her infamous father Pope
      Alexander VI: Olga at her marriage in the Sistine Chapel to
      the Duke of Biseglia: his murder in her presence by the
      hired bravos of His Holiness and her brother. The scenery
      was fantastically gorgeous ("not Shakespearian at all,
      Georgie," Lucia had whispered to him), but when Olga was on
      the stage, he was conscious of nothing but her. She
      outshone all the splendour, and never more so than when,
      swathed in black, she followed her husband's bier, and sang
      that lament--or was it a song of triumph?--"Amore
      misterioso, celeste, profondo." . . . "I believe I've got a
      very passionate nature," thought Georgie, "but I've always
      crushed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to get to sleep, and wheeling out of bed,
      he lit a cigarette and paced up and down his room. But it
      was chilly, and putting on a smart blue knitted pullover he
      got back into bed again. Once more he jumped up; he had no
      ashtray, but the lid of his soap-dish would do, and he
      reviewed Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know Tilling is very exciting," he said to himself, "for
      extraordinary things are always happening, and I'm very
      comfortable there. But I've no independence. I'm devoted to
      Lucia, but what with breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, as
      well as a great deal in between . . . And then how
      exasperating she is as Mayor! What with her ceaseless jaw
      about her duties and position I get fed up. Those tin boxes
      with nothing in them! Mrs. Simpson every morning with
      nothing to do! I want a change. Sometimes I almost
      sympathise with Elizabeth, when Lucia goes rolling along
      like the car of Juggernaut, squish-squash, whoever comes in
      her way. And yet it's she, I really believe, who makes
      things happen, just because she is Lucia, and I don't know
      where we should be without her. Good gracious, that's the
      second cigarette I've smoked in bed, and I had my full
      allowance before. Why didn't I bring up my embroidery? That
      often makes me sleepy. I shall be fit for nothing
      to-morrow, lying awake like this, and I must go shopping in
      the morning, and then we lunch with Olga, and catch the
      afternoon train back to That Hole. Damn everything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt better in the morning after two cups of very
      hot tea brought him by Foljambe who had come up as their
      joint maid. He read his paper, breakfasting in his room, as
      in his comfortable bachelor days. There was a fervent
      notice of <i>Lucrezia,</i> but no indication, since there
      had been five Duchesses present, as to which their
      particular Grace was, who had rather embarrassed him by her
      fixed eye. But then Foljambe brought him another paper
      which Lucia wanted back. She had marked it with a blue
      pencil, and there he read that the Duke and Duchess of
      Sheffield and the Mayor of Tilling had attended the opera
      in Miss Bracely's box. That gave him great satisfaction,
      for all those folk who had looked at their box so much
      would now feel sure that he was the Mayor of Tilling . . .
      Then he went out alone for his shopping, as Lucia sent word
      that she had received some agenda for the next Council
      meeting, which she must study, and thoroughly enjoyed it.
      He found some very pretty new ties and some nice underwear,
      and he could linger by attractive windows, instead of going
      to some improving exhibition which Lucia would certainly
      have wished to do. Then in eager trepidation he went to the
      Ritz for lunch, and found that Lucia had not yet arrived.
      But there was Olga in the lounge, who hailed him on a high
      soprano note, so that everybody knew that he was Georgie,
      and might have guessed, from the <i>timbre,</i> that she
      was Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, how nice to see you," she cried. "But a beard,
      Georgie! What does it mean? Tell me all about it. Where's
      your Lucia? She hasn't divorced you already, I hope? And
      have a cocktail? I insist, because it looks so bad for an
      elderly female to be drinking alone, and I am dying for
      one. And did you like the opera last night? I thought I
      sang superbly; even Cortese didn't scold me. How I love
      being in stuffy old London again; I'm off to Riseholme
      to-night for a week, and you must--Ah, here's Lucia! We'll
      go into lunch at once. I asked Cortese, but he can't come
      in till afterwards. Only Poppy Sheffield is coming, and she
      will probably arrive about tea-time. She'll be terribly
      taken up with Georgie, because she adores beards, and says
      they are getting so rare nowadays. Don't be alarmed, my
      lamb: she doesn't want to touch them, but the sight of them
      refreshes her in some psychic manner. Oh, of course, she
      was in your box last night. She hates music, and hears it
      only as a mortification of the flesh, of which she has
      plenty. Quite gaga, but so harmless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga was a long time getting to her table, because she made
      many greetings on the way, and Lucia began to hate her
      again. She was too casual, keeping the Mayor of Tilling
      standing about like this, and Lucia, who had strong views
      about <i>maquillage,</i> was distressed to see how many
      women, Olga included, were sadly made-up. And yet how
      marvellous to thread her way through the crowded restaurant
      with the prima donna, not waiting for a Duchess: if only
      some Tillingites had been there to see! <i>Per contra,</i>
      it was rather familiar of Olga to put her hand on Georgie's
      shoulder and shove him into his place. Lucia stored up in
      separate packets resentment and the deepest gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asparagus. Cold and very buttery. Olga picked up the sticks
      with her fingers and then openly sucked them. Lucia used a
      neat little holder which was beside her plate. Perhaps Olga
      did not know what it was for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you and Georgie must come to Riseholme for the
      week-end," she said. "I get down to-night, so join me
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too sweet of you," she said, "but impossible, I'm afraid.
      So many duties. To-morrow is Friday, isn't it? Yes: a
      prize-giving to-morrow afternoon, and something in the
      evening, I fancy. Borough Bench on Monday at ten. One thing
      after another; no end to them, day after day. It was only
      by the rarest chance I was able to come up yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie knew that this was utter rubbish. Lucia had not had
      a single municipal engagement for four days, and had spent
      her time in bicycling and sketching and playing Bridge. She
      just wanted to impress Olga with the innumerable duties of
      her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too bad!" said Olga. "Georgie, you mustn't let her work
      herself to death like this. But you'll come, won't you, if
      we can't persuade her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an opportunity for independent action. He strung
      himself up to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Delighted. I should adore to," he said with
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital. That's settled then. But you must come, too,
      Lucia. How they would all love to see you again at
      Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia wanted to go, especially since Georgie would
      otherwise go without her, and she would have been much
      disconcerted if her refusal had been taken as final. She
      pressed two fingers to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me think!" she said. "I've nothing after Friday
      evening, have I, Georgie, till Monday's Council? I always
      try to keep Saturdays free. No: I don't think I have. I
      could come down with Georgie, on Saturday morning, but we
      shall have to leave again very early on Monday. Too
      tempting to refuse, dear Olga. The sweet place, and those
      busy days, or so they seemed then, but now, by comparison,
      what a holiday!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppy appeared just as they had finished lunch, and Lucia
      was astonished to find that she had not the smallest idea
      that they had ever met before. When reminded, Poppy
      explained that when she went to hear music a total oblivion
      of all else seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carried away," she said. "I don't know if I'm on my head
      or my heels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were carried away you'd be on your back," said
      Olga. "What do you want to eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dressed crab and plenty of black coffee," said Poppy
      decidedly. "That's what keeps me in perfect health." She
      had just become conscious of Georgie, and had fixed her eye
      on his beard, when Cortese plunged into the restaurant and
      came, like a bore up the River Severn, to Olga's table,
      loudly lamenting in Italian that he had not been able to
      come to lunch. He kissed her hand, he kissed Poppy's hand,
      and after a short pause for recollection, he kissed Lucia's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, si," he cried, "it is the lady who came to hear the
      first trial of <i>Lucrezia</i> at your Riseholme, and spoke
      Italian with so pure an accent. <i>Come sta, signora?"</i>
      And he continued to prattle in Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had a horrid feeling that all this had happened
      before, and that in a moment it would be rediscovered that
      she could not speak Italian. Lunch, anyhow, was over, and
      she could say a reluctant farewell. She summoned up a few
      words in that abhorred tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Cara,"</i> she said to Olga, "we must tear ourselves
      away. <i>A rivederci, non e vero, dopo domani.</i> But we
      must go to catch our train. A poor hard-worked Mayor must
      get back to the call of duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is he a Mayor?" asked Poppy with interest. "How very
      distinguished."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to explain; it was better that Georgie
      should be temporarily enthroned in Poppy's mind as Mayor,
      rather than run any further risks, and Lucia threaded her
      way through the narrow passage between the tables. After
      all she had got plenty of material to work up into noble
      narrative at Tilling. Georgie followed and slammed the door
      of the taxi quite crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't think why you were in such a hurry," he said. "I
      was enjoying myself, and we shall only be kicking our heels
      at the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better to run no risk of missing our train," she said.
      "And we have to pick up Foljambe and our luggage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Georgie. "We particularly arranged that
      she should meet us with it at Victoria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how stupid of me!" said the shameless Lucia.
      "Forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia found that she had no engagement for the next
      evening, and got up a party for dinner and Bridge in order
      casually to disseminate these magnificent experiences. Mr.
      Wyse and Diva, (Susan being indisposed) the Mapp-Flints and
      the Padre and Evie were her guests. It rather surprised her
      that nobody asked any questions at dinner, about her visit
      to London, but, had she only known it, Tilling had seen in
      the paper that she and a Duke and Duchess had been in
      Olga's box, and had entered into a fell conspiracy, for
      Lucia's good, not to show the slightest curiosity about it.
      Thus, though her guests were starving for information,
      conversation at dinner had been entirely confined to other
      topics, and whenever Lucia made a casual allusion to the
      opera, somebody spoke loudly about something else. But when
      the ladies retired into the garden-room the strain on their
      curiosity began to tell, and Lucia tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So delightful to get back to peaceful Tilling," she said,
      as if she had been away for thirty-six weeks instead of
      thirty-six hours, "though I fear it is not for long. London
      was such a terrible rush. Of course the first thing we did
      was to go to the Academy to see the Picture of the Year,
      dear Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was crafty: Elizabeth could not help being interested
      in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And could you get near it, dear?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easily. Not such a great crowd. Technically I was a wee
      bit disappointed. Very vigorous, of course, and great
      <i>bravura</i>--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How shall I say it? Dash, sensational effect, a too
      obvious dexterity," said Lucia, gesticulating like a
      painter doing bold brush-work. "I should have liked more
      time to look at it, for Irene will long to know what I
      think about it, but we had to dress and dine before the
      opera. Dear Olga had given us an excellent box, a little
      too near the stage perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than flesh and blood could stand: the
      conspiracy of silence broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw in the paper that the Duke and Duchess of Sheffield
      were there, too," said Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the paper was it?" asked Lucia with an air of great
      surprise. "How the press ferrets things out! He and Poppy
      Sheffield came in in the middle of the second act. I was
      rather cross, I'm afraid, for I hate such interruptions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was goaded into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most inconsiderate," she said. "I hope you told her so,
      Worship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia smiled indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, people who aren't <i>really</i> musical--poor Poppy
      Sheffield is not--have no idea of the pain they give. And
      what has happened here since Georgie and I left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventeen to tea yesterday," said Diva. "What was the
      opera like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Superb. Olga sang the great scene to me years ago and I
      confess I did not do it justice. A little modern for my
      classical taste, but a very great work. Very. And her voice
      is still magnificent; perhaps a little sign of forcing in
      the top register, but then I am terribly critical."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conspiracy of silence had become a cross-examination of
      questions. These admissions were being forced from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then did you go out to supper?" asked Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah no! Music takes too much out of me. Back to the hotel
      and so to bed, as Pepys says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And next morning, Worship, after such an exciting
      evening?" asked Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor me! A bundle of agenda for the Council meeting on
      Monday. I had to slave at them until nearly lunch-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Mr Georgie in your hotel?" asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: dear Olga insisted that we should lunch with her at
      the Ritz," said Lucia in the slow drawling voice which she
      adopted when her audience were on tenterhooks. No party,
      just the four of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was the fourth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess. She was very late, just as she had been at
      the opera. A positive obsession with her. So we didn't
      wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not waiting for a Duchess produced a stunning effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva recovered first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good food?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair, I should have called it. Or do you mean Poppy's
      food? How you will laugh! A dressed crab and oceans of
      black coffee. The only diet on which she feels really
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sounds most indigestible," said Diva. "What an odd sort of
      stomach. And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you all catechize me! Then Cortese came in. He is the
      composer, I must explain, of <i>Lucrezia,</i> and conducted
      it. Italian, with all the vivaciousness of the South--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you had a good talk in Italian to him, dear," said
      Elizabeth viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, no. We had to rush off almost immediately to catch
      our train. Hardly a word with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity!" said Elizabeth. "And just now you told us
      you were not going to be here long. Gadding off again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, yes; though how ungrateful of me to say 'alas',"
      said Lucia still drawling. "Dear Olga implored Georgie and
      me to spend the week-end with her at Riseholme. She would
      not take a refusal. It will be delicious to see the dear
      old place again. I shall make her sing to us. These great
      singers are always at their best with a small <i>intime</i>
      sympathetic audience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will there be some Duchesses there?" asked Elizabeth,
      unable to suppress her bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Chi lo sa?"</i> said Lucia with superb indifference.
      "Ah, here come the men. Let us get to our Bridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men, who were members of this conspiracy, had shewn a
      stronger self-control than the women, and had not asked
      Georgie a single question about high-life, but they knew
      now about his new ties. Evie could not resist saying in an
      aside to her husband:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy, Kenneth, the Duchess of Sheffield lives on dressed
      crab and black coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could resist such an alluring fragment? Certainly not
      the Padre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, that's a singular diet," he said, "and has Mistress
      Mayor been telling you a' about it? An' what does she do
      when there's no crab to be had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      From the eagerness in his voice, Lucia instantly guessed
      that the men had heard nothing, and were consumed with
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough of my silly tittle-tattle," she said. "More
      important matters lie before us. Elizabeth, will you and
      the Padre and Mr. Wyse play at my table?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while cards overrode all other interests, but it was
      evident that the men were longing to know all that their
      vow of self-control had hidden from them: first one and
      then another, during the deals, alluded to shellfish and
      Borgias. But Lucia was adamant: they had certainly
      conspired to show no interest in the great events of the
      London visit, and they must be punished. But when the party
      broke up, Mr. Wyse insisted on driving Diva back in the
      Royce, and plied her with questions, and Major Benjy and
      the Padre, by the time they got home, knew as much as their
      wives.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and Georgie, with Grosvenor as maid (for it was only
      fair that she should have her share in these magnificent
      excursions) motored to Riseholme next morning. Lucia took
      among her luggage the tin box labelled "Housing," in order
      to keep abreast of municipal work, but in the hurry of
      departure forget to put any municipal papers inside it. She
      would have liked to take Mrs. Simpson as well, but
      Grosvenor occupied the seat next her chauffeur, and three
      inside would have been uncomfortable. Olga gave a
      garden-party in her honour in the afternoon, and Lucia was
      most gracious to all her old friends, in the manner of a
      Dowager Queen who has somehow come into a far vaster
      kingdom, but who has a tender remembrance of her former
      subjects, however humble, and she had a kind word for them
      all. After the party had dispersed, she and Georgie and
      Olga sat on in the garden, and her smiles were touched with
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a joy to see all the dear, quaint folk again," she
      said, "but what a sad change has come over the place!
      Riseholme, which in old days used to be seething with every
      sort of interest, has become just like any other vegetating
      little village--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree at all," said Georgie loudly. "It's seething
      still. Daisy Quantock's got a French parlourmaid who's an
      atheist, and Mrs. Antrobus has learned the deaf and dumb
      alphabet, as she's got so deaf that the most expensive
      ear-trumpet isn't any use to her. Everybody has been
      learning it, too, and when Mrs. Boucher gave a birthday
      party for her only last week, they all talked deaf and dumb
      to each other, so that Mrs. Antrobus could understand what
      was being said. I call that marvellous manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old flame flickered for a moment in Lucia's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she cried. "What else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't finished this yet," said Georgie. "And they were
      all using their hands so much to talk, that they couldn't
      get on with their dinner, and it took an hour and a half,
      though it was only four courses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how thrilling!" said Olga. "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie turned to the more sympathetic listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, they couldn't talk fast, because they were only
      learning, but when Mrs. Antrobus replied, she was so quick,
      being an expert, that nobody except Piggie and Goosie--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia tilted her head sideways, with a sidelong glance at
      Olga, busy with a looking-glass and lipstick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah; I recollect. Her daughters," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course. They could tell you what she said if they
      were looking, but if they weren't looking you had to guess,
      like when somebody talks fast in a foreign language which
      you don't know much of, and you make a shot at what he's
      saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him a gimlet-glance. But of course, Georgie
      couldn't have been thinking of her and the Italian crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their dear, funny little ways!" she said. "But everyone I
      talked to was so eager to hear about Tilling and my mayoral
      work, that I learned nothing about what was going on here.
      How they besieged me with questions! What else, Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the people who have got your house now have made a
      swimming bath in the garden and have lovely mixed bathing
      parties."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia repressed a pang of regret that she had never thought
      of doing that, and uttered a shocked sort of noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what a sad desecration!" she said. "Where is it? In my
      pleached alley, or in Perdita's garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the pleached alley, and it's a great success. I wish
      I'd brought my bathing-suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do they keep up my tableaux and Elizabethan fêtes and
      literary circles?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't hear anything about them, but there's a great
      deal going on. Very gay, and lots of people come down for
      week-ends from town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And cocktail parties, I suppose," she said. "Well, well,
      one must expect one's traces to be removed by the hand of
      time. That wonderful sonnet of Shakespeare's about it.
      <i>Olga mia,</i> will you excuse me till dinner-time? Some
      housing plans I have got to study, or I shall never be able
      to face my Council on Monday."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia came down to dinner steeped in the supposed contents
      of her tin box and with a troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those riband-developments!" she said. "They form one of
      the greatest problems I have to tackle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga looked utterly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ribands?" she asked. "Things in hats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a bright laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stupid of me not to explain, dear," she said. "How could
      you know? Building developments: dreadful hideous dwellings
      along the sweet country roads leading into Tilling.
      Red-brick villas instead of hedges of hawthorn and
      eglantine. It seems such desecration."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sighed. Lucia had already told him what she meant
      to say to her Council on Monday afternoon, and would
      assuredly tell him what she had said on Monday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caterpillars!" she cried with a sudden inspiration. "I
      shall compare those lines of houses to caterpillars, hungry
      red caterpillars wriggling out across the marsh and
      devouring its verdant loveliness. A vivid metaphor like
      that is needed. But I know, dear Olga, that nothing I say
      to you will go any further. My Councillors have a right to
      know my views before anybody else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lips are sealed," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet we must build these new houses," said the Mayor,
      putting both her elbows on the table and disregarding her
      plate of chicken. "We must abolish the slums in Tilling,
      and that means building on the roads outside. Such a
      multiplicity of conflicting interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the work is tremendous," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think we might call it tremendous, mightn't we,
      Georgie?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was feeling fearfully annoyed with her. She was
      only putting it on in order to impress Olga, but the more
      fervently he agreed, the sooner, it might be hoped, she
      would stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Overwhelming. Incessant," he asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope was vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear, not overwhelming," she said, eating her chicken
      in a great hurry. "I am not overwhelmed by it. Working for
      others enlarges one's capacity for work. For the sake of my
      dear Tilling I can undertake without undue fatigue, what
      would otherwise render me a perfect wreck. <i>Ich Dien.</i>
      Of course I have to sacrifice other interests. My reading?
      I scarcely open a book. My painting? I have done nothing
      since I made a sketch of some gorgeous dahlias in the
      autumn, which Georgie didn't think too bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely," said Georgie in a voice of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear. My music? I have hardly played a note.
      But as you must know so well, dear Olga, music makes an
      imperishable store of memories within one: morsels of
      Mozart: bits of Beethoven all audible to the inward ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How well I remember you playing the slow movement of the
      Moonlight Sonata," said Olga, seeking, like Georgie to
      entice her away from Mayoral topics. But the effect of this
      was appalling. Lucia assumed her rapt music-face, and with
      eyes fixed on the ceiling, indicated slow triplets on the
      table cloth. Her fingers faltered, they recovered, and
      nobody could guess how long she would continue: probably to
      the end of the movement, and yet it seemed rude to
      interrupt this symbolic recital. But presently she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty fingers," she said, as if shaking the triplets
      off. "So forgetful of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow she had drained the life out of the others, but
      dinner was over, and they moved into Olga's music-room. The
      piano stood open, and Lucia, as if walking in sleep, like
      Lady Macbeth, glided on to the music stool. The naughty
      fingers became much better, indeed they became as good as
      they had ever been. She dwelt long on the last note of the
      famous slow movement, gazing wistfully up, and they all
      sighed, according to the traditional usage when Lucia
      played the Moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear," said Olga. "Perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly sprang off the music-stool with a light
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than I had feared," she said, "but far from
      perfect. And now, dear Olga, dare I? Might we? One little
      song. Shall I try to accompany you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga thought she could accompany herself and Lucia seated
      herself on a sort of throne close beside her and resumed
      her rapt expression, as Olga sang the "Ave" out of
      <i>Lucrezia.</i> That solemn strain seemed vaguely familiar
      to Lucia, but she could not place it. Was it Beethoven? Was
      it from <i>Fidelio</i> or from <i>Creation Hymn?</i>
      Perhaps it was wiser only to admire with emotion without
      committing herself to the composer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wonderful old tune!" she said. "What a treat to hear
      it again. Those great melodies are the very
      foundation-stone of music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it the prayer in <i>Lucrezia?"</i> asked
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia instantly remembered that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course it is, Georgie," she said. "But in the
      plain-song mode. I expressed myself badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She hadn't the smallest idea what it was," thought Olga,
      "but she could wriggle out of a thumb-screw." Then aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that was Cortese's intention," she said. "He will be
      pleased to know you think he has caught it. By the way, he
      rang up just before dinner to ask if he and his wife might
      come down to-morrow afternoon for the night. I sent a
      fervent 'yes'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you spoil us!" said Lucia ecstatically. "That
      will be too delightful."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her ecstasy, this was grave news, and as she
      went to bed she pondered it. There would be Cortese, whose
      English was very limited (though less circumscribed than
      her own Italian), there would be Olga, who, though she said
      she spoke Italian atrociously, was fluent and understood it
      perfectly, and possibly Cortese's wife knew no English at
      all. If she did not, conversation must be chiefly conducted
      in Italian, and Lucia's vivid imagination pictured Olga
      translating to her what they were all saying, and
      re-translating her replies to them. Then no doubt he would
      play to them, and she would have to guess whether he was
      playing Beethoven or Mozart or plain-song or Cortese. It
      would be an evening full of hazards and humiliations.
      Better perhaps, in view of a pretended engagement on Monday
      morning, to leave on Sunday afternoon, before these
      dangerous foreigners arrived. "If only I could bring myself
      to say that I can neither speak nor understand Italian, and
      know nothing about music!" thought Lucia. "But I can't
      after all these years. It's wretched to run away like this,
      but I couldn't bear it."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie came down very late to breakfast. He had had dreams
      of Olga trying through a song to his accompaniment. She
      stood behind him with her hands on his shoulders, and her
      face close to his. Then he began singing, too, and their
      voices blended exquisitely. . . . Dressing was a festival
      with his tiled bathroom next door, and he debated as to
      which of his new ties Olga would like best. Breakfast,
      Grosvenor had told him, would be on the verandah, but it
      was such a warm morning there was no need for his cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others were already down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, this will never do," said Olga, as he came out.
      ''Lucia says she must go back to Tilling this afternoon.
      Keep her in order. Tell her she shan't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's happened, Lucia?" he asked. "If we start early
      to-morrow we shall be in heaps of time for your Council
      meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia began to gabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm too wretched about it," she said, "But when I went
      upstairs last night, I looked into those papers again which
      I brought down with me, and I find there is so much I must
      talk over with my Town Clerk if I am to be equipped for my
      Council in the afternoon. You know what Monday morning is,
      Georgie. I must not neglect my duties though I have to
      sacrifice my delicious evening here. I must be adamant.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too sad," said Olga. "But there's no reason why you should
      go, Georgie. I'll drive you back tomorrow. My dear, what a
      pretty tie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall stop then," said he. "I've nothing to do at
      Tilling. I thought you'd like my tie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had never contemplated this, and she did not like it.
      But having announced herself as adamant, she could not
      instantly turn to putty. Just one chance of getting him to
      come with her remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to take Grosvenor with me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie pictured a strange maid bringing in his tea, and
      getting his bath ready, with the risk of her finding his
      <i>toupée,</i> and other aids to juvenility. He faced it:
      it was worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't matter," he replied. "I shall be able to
      manage perfectly."

    <p>
      Lucia was in for a run of bad luck, and it began that very
      afternoon. Ten minutes before she started with Grosvenor
      for Tilling, Cortese and his wife arrived. The latter was
      English and knew even less Italian than she did. And
      Cortese brought with him the first act of his new opera. It
      was too late to change her plans and she drove off after a
      most affectionate parting from Olga, whom she charged to
      come and stay at Tilling any time at a moment's notice.
      Just a telephone message to say she was coming, and she
      could start at once sure of the fondest welcome . . . But
      it was all most tiresome, for no doubt Cortese would run
      through the first act of his opera to-night, and the
      linguistic panic which had caused her to flee from
      Riseholme as from a plague-stricken village, leaving her
      nearest and dearest there, had proved to be utterly
      foundationless.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the present that was all she knew: had she known what
      was to occur half an hour after she had left, she would
      certainly have turned and gone back to the plague-stricken
      village again, trusting to her unbounded ingenuity to
      devise some reason for her reappearance. A phone-call from
      the Duchess of Sheffield came for Madame Cortese.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor mad Cousin Poppy," she said. "What on earth can she
      want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dressed crab," screamed Olga after her as she went to the
      telephone, "Cortese, you darling, let's have a go at your
      <i>Diane de Poictiers</i> after dinner. I had no idea you
      were near the end of the first act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I also. It has come as smooth as margarine," said
      Cortese, who had been enjoined by Madame to learn English
      with all speed, and never to dare to speak Italian in her
      presence. "And such an aria for you. When you hear it, you
      will jump for joy. I jump, you jumps, they jumpino. Dam'
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame returned from the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poppy asked more questions in half a minute than were ever
      asked before in that time," she said. "I took the first two
      or three and told her to wait. First, will we go to her
      awful old Castle to-morrow, to dine and stay the night.
      Second: who is here. Olga, I told her, and Cortese, and Mr.
      Pillson of Tilling. 'Why, of course I know him,' said
      Poppy. 'He's the Mayor of Tilling, and I met him at
      <i>Lucrezia,</i> and at lunch at the Ritz. Such a lovely
      beard'. Thirdly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm not the Mayor of Tilling," cried Georgie. "Lucia's
      the Mayor of Tilling, and she hasn't got a beard--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, don't be pedantic," said Olga. "Evidently she
      means you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"La Barba e mobile,"</i> chanted Cortese. "<i>Una barba
      per due. Scusi.</i> Should say 'A beard for two,' my
      Dorothea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't <i>mobile,''</i> said Georgie, thinking about his
      <i>toupée.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it isn't," said Olga. "It's a fine, natural
      beard. Well, what about Poppy? Let's all go to-morrow
      afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I must get back to Tilling," said Georgie. "Lucia
      expects me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha, you are a henpeck," cried Cortese. "And I am also a
      henpeck. Is it not so, my Dorothea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're coming with us, Georgie," said Olga. "Ring up Lucia
      in the morning and tell her so. Just like that. And tell
      Poppy that we'll all four come, Dorothy. So that's
      settled."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, for all her chagrin, was thrilled at the news, when
      Georgie rang her up next morning. He laid special stress on
      the Mayor of Tilling having been asked, for he felt sure
      she would enjoy that. Though it was agonizing to think what
      she had missed by her precipitate departure yesterday,
      Lucia cordially gave him leave to go to Sheffield Castle,
      for it was something that Georgie should stay there, though
      not she, and she sent her love and regrets to Poppy. Then
      after presiding at the Borough Bench (which lasted exactly
      twenty seconds, as there were no cases) instead of
      conferring with her Town Clerk, she hurried down to the
      High Street to release the news like a new film.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back again, dear Worship," cried Elizabeth, darting across
      the street. "Pleasant visit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious," said Lucia in the drawling voice. "Dear
      Riseholme! How pleased they all were to see me. No party at
      Olga's; just Cortese and his wife, <i>très intime,</i> but
      such music. I got back last night to be ready for my duties
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not Mr. Georgie?" asked Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I insisted that he should stop. Indeed, I don't expect
      him till to-morrow, for he has just telephoned that Duchess
      Poppy--a cousin of Madame Cortese--asked the whole lot of
      us to go over to Sheffield to-day to dine and sleep. Such
      short notice, and impossible for me, of course, with my
      Council meeting this afternoon. The dear thing cannot
      realise that one has duties which must not be thrown over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity. So disappointing for you, dear," said
      Elizabeth, writhing under a sudden spasm of colic of the
      mind. "But Sheffield's a long way to go for one night. Does
      she live in the town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia emitted the musical trill of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's Sheffield Castle," she said. "Not a long drive
      from Riseholme, in one of Olga's Daimlers. A Norman tower.
      A moat. It was in <i>Country Life</i> not long ago. . . .
      Good morning, Padre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' where's your guid man?" asked the Padre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia considered whether she should repeat the great news.
      But it was more exalted not to, especially since the
      dissemination of it, now that Elizabeth knew, was as
      certain as if she had it proclaimed by the Town Crier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He joins me to-morrow," she said. "Any news here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a lovely sermon from Reverence yesterday," said
      Elizabeth, for the relief of her colic. "All about riches
      and position in the world being only dross. I wish you
      could have heard it, Worship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia could afford to smile at this pitiable thrust, and
      proceeded with her shopping, not ordering any special
      delicacies for herself because Georgie would be dining with
      a Duchess. She felt that fate had not been very kind to her
      personally, though most thoughtful for Georgie. It was
      cruel that she had not known the nationality of Cortese's
      wife, and her rooted objection to his talking Italian,
      before she had become adamant about returning to Tilling,
      and this was doubly bitter, because in that case she would
      have still been on the spot when Poppy's invitation
      arrived, and it might have been possible (indeed, she would
      have made it possible) for the Deputy Mayor to take her
      place at the Council meeting to-day, at which her presence
      had been so imperative when she was retreating before the
      Italians.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to wonder whether she could not manage to join
      the Ducal party after all. There was actually very little
      business at the Council meeting; it would be over by
      half-past four, and if she started then she would be in
      time for dinner at Sheffield Castle. Or perhaps it would be
      safer to telephone to the Deputy Mayor, asking him to take
      her place, as she had been called away unexpectedly. The
      Deputy Mayor very willingly consented. He hoped it was not
      bad news and was reassured. All that there remained was to
      ring up Sheffield Castle, and say that the Mayor of Tilling
      was delighted to accept Her Grace's invitation to dine and
      sleep, conveyed to her Worship by Mr. Pillson. The answer
      was returned that the Mayor of Tilling was expected. "And
      just for a joke," thought Lucia, "I won't tell them at
      Riseholme that I'm coming. Such a lovely surprise for them,
      if I get there first. I can start soon after lunch, and
      take it quietly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She recollected, with a trivial pang of uneasiness, that
      she had told Elizabeth that her duties at Tilling would
      have prevented her in any case from going to Sheffield
      Castle, but that did not last long. She would live it down
      or deny having said it, and she went into the garden-room
      to release Mrs. Simpson, and, at the same time, to provide
      for the propagation of the tidings that she was going to
      her Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not attend the Council meeting this afternoon,
      Mrs. Simpson," she said, "as there's nothing of the
      slightest importance. It will be a mere formality, so I am
      playing truant. I shall be leaving Tilling after lunch, to
      dine and sleep at the Duchess of Sheffield's, at Sheffield
      Castle. A moat and I think a drawbridge. Ring me up there
      if anything occurs that I must deal with personally, and I
      will give it my attention. There seems nothing that need
      detain you any more to-day. One of our rare holidays."
    </p>
    <p>
      On her way home Mrs. Simpson met Diva's Janet, and told her
      the sumptuous news. Janet scuttled home and plunged down
      into the kitchen to tell her mistress who was making buns.
      She had already heard about Georgie from Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't believe a word of it," said Diva. "You've mixed it
      up, Janet. It's Mr. Georgie, if anybody, who's going to
      Sheffield Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg your pardon, ma'am," said Janet hotly, "but I've mixed
      nothing up. Mrs. Simpson told me direct that the Mayor was
      going, and talking of mixing you'd better mix twice that
      lot of currants, if it's going to be buns."
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone bell rang in the tea-room above, and Diva
      flew up the kitchen-stairs, scattering flour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diva, is that Diva?" said Lucia's voice. "My memory is
      shocking; did I say I would pop in for tea to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Why?" said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all right then," said Lucia. "I feared that I
      might have to put it off. I'm joining Georgie on a one
      night's visit to a friend. I couldn't get out of it. Back
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva replaced the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Janet, you're quite right," she called down the kitchen
      stairs. "Just finish the buns. Must go out and tell
      people."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's motor came round after lunch. Foljambe (it was
      Foljambe's turn, and Georgie felt more comfortable with
      her) was waiting in the hall with the jewel-case and a
      camera, and Lucia was getting the "Slum Clearance" tin box
      from the garden-room to take with her, when the
      telephone-bell rang. She had a faint presage of coming
      disaster as she said, "Who is it?" in as steady a voice as
      she could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheffield Castle speaking. Is that the Mayor of Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her Grace's maid speaking, your Worship. Her Grace partook
      of her usual luncheon to-day--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dressed crab?" asked Lucia in parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Worship, and was taken with internal pains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am terribly sorry," said Lucia. "Was it tinned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fresh, I understand, and the party is put off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a hollow moan into the receiver, and Her Grace's
      maid offered consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No anxiety at all, your Worship," she said, "but she
      thought she wouldn't feel up to a party."
    </p>
    <p>
      The disaster evoked in Lucia the exercise of her utmost
      brilliance. There was such a fearful lot at stake over this
      petty indigestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind an atom about the dislocation of my plans,"
      she said, "but I am a little anxious about her dear Grace.
      I quite understand about the party being put off; so wise
      to spare her fatigue. It would be such a relief if I might
      come just to reassure myself. I was on the point of
      starting, my maid, my luggage all ready. I would not be any
      trouble. My maid would bring me a tray instead of dinner.
      Is it possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see," said her Grace's maid, touched by this
      devotion. "Hold on."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held on; she held on, it seemed, as for life itself,
      till, after an interminable interval the reply came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her Grace would be very happy to see the Mayor of Tilling,
      but she's putting off the rest of the party," said the
      angelic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, thank you," called Lucia. "So good of her. I
      will start at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up Slum Clearance and went into the house only
      to be met by a fresh ringing of the telephone in the hall.
      A panic seized her lest Poppy should have changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it ring, Grosvenor," she said. "Don't answer it at
      all. Get in, Foljambe. Be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaped into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drive on, Chapman," she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car rocked its way down to the High Street, and Lucia
      let down the window and looked out, in case there were any
      friends about. There was Diva at the corner, and she
      stopped the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just off, Diva," she said. "Duchess Poppy not very well,
      so I've just heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Crab?" asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently, but not tinned, and there is no need for me to
      feel anxious. She insisted on my coming just the same. Such
      a lovely drive in front of me. Taking some work with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pulled up the window again and pinched her finger but
      she hardly regarded that for there was so much to think
      about. Olga at Riseholme, for instance, must have been
      informed by now that the party was off, and yet Georgie had
      not rung up to say that he would be returning to Tilling
      to-day. A disagreeable notion flitted through her mind
      that, having got leave to go to Sheffield Castle, he now
      meant to stay another night with Olga, without telling her,
      and it was with a certain relief that she remembered the
      disregarded telephone call which had hurried her departure.
      Very likely that was Georgie ringing up to tell her that he
      was coming back to Tilling to-day. It would be a sad
      surprise for him not to find her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her route lay through Riseholme, and passing along the edge
      of the village green, she kept a sharp look-out for
      familiar figures. She saw Piggie and Goosie with Mrs.
      Antrobus: they were all three gesticulating with their
      hands in a manner that seemed very odd until she remembered
      that they must be speaking in deaf and dumb alphabet: she
      saw a very slim elegant young woman whom she conjectured to
      be Daisy Quantock's atheistic French maid, but there was no
      sign of Georgie or Olga. She debated a moment as to whether
      she should call at Olga's to find out for certain that he
      had gone, but dismissed the idea as implying a groundless
      suspicion. Beyond doubt the telephone call which she had so
      narrowly evaded was to say that he had done so, and she
      steadily backed away from the familiar scene in order to
      avoid seeing him if he was still here . . . Then came less
      familiar country, a belt of woods, a stretch of heathery
      upland glowing in the afternoon sun, positively demanding
      to be sketched in water-colours, and presently a turning
      with a sign-post "To Sheffield Bottom''. Trees again, a
      small village of grey stone houses, and facing her a great
      castellated wall with a tower above a gateway and a bridge
      over a moat leading to it. Lucia stopped the car and got
      out, camera in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a noble façade," she said to herself. "I wonder if my
      room will be in that tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a couple of photographs, and getting back into the
      car, she passed over the bridge and through the gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside lay a paved courtyard in a state of indescribable
      neglect. Weeds sprouted between the stones, a jungle of
      neglected flower-beds lay below the windows, here and there
      were moss-covered stone seats. On one of these close beside
      the huge discoloured door of blistered paint sat Poppy with
      her mouth open, fast asleep. As Lucia stepped out, she
      awoke, and looked at her with a dazed expression of strong
      disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" asked Poppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Duchess, so good of you to let me come," said Lucia,
      thinking that she was only half-awake. "Lucia Pillson, the
      Mayor of Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you aren't," said Poppy. "It's a man, and he's got a
      beard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you're thinking of my husband," she said. "Such a
      vivid description of him. It fits him exactly. But I'm the
      Mayor. We met at dear Olga's opera-box, and at the Ritz
      next day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppy gave a great yawn, and sat silent, assimilating this
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid there's been a complete muddle," she said. "I
      thought it was he who was coming. You see I was much
      flattered at his eagerness to spend a quiet evening with me
      and my stomach-ache, and so I said yes. No designs on him
      of any kind I assure you. All clean as a whistle: he'd have
      been as safe with me as with his grandmother, if she's
      still alive. My husband's away, and I just wanted a
      pleasant companion. And to think that it was you all the
      while. That never entered my head. Fancy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not require a mind of Lucia's penetrative power to
      perceive that Poppy did not want her, and did not intend
      that she should stop. Her next remarks removed any
      possibility of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll have some tea first, <i>won't</i> you?" she
      asked. "Indeed I insist on your having some tea unless you
      prefer coffee. If you ring the door-bell, somebody will
      probably come. Oh, I see you've got a camera. Do take some
      photographs. Would you like to begin with me, though I'm
      not looking my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the nightmarish quality of the situation, Lucia
      kept her head, and it was something to be given tea and to
      take photographs. Perhaps there was a scoop here, if she
      handled it properly, and first she photographed Poppy and
      the dismal courtyard, and then went to Poppy's bedroom to
      tidy herself for tea and snapped her washing-stand and the
      corner of her Elizabethan bed. After tea Poppy took her to
      the dining-room and the gaunt picture gallery and through a
      series of decayed drawing-rooms, and all the time Lucia
      babbled rapturous comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magnificent tapestry," she said, "ah, and a glimpse of the
      Park from the window. Would you stand there, Duchess,
      looking out with your dog on the window-seat? What a little
      love! Perfect. And this noble hall: the panelling by that
      lovely oriel window would make a lovely picture. And that
      refectory table."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Poppy had had enough, and she walked firmly to the
      front-door and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charmed to have seen you," she said, "though I've no head
      for names. You will have a pleasant drive home on this
      lovely evening. Goodbye, or perhaps <i>au revoir."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be much nicer," said Lucia, cordial to the
      last.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She drove out of the gateway she had entered three quarters
      of an hour before, and stopped the car to think out her
      plans. Her first idea was to spend the night at the
      Ambermere Arms at Riseholme, and return to Tilling next
      morning laden with undeveloped photographs of Sheffield
      Castle and Poppy, having presumably spent the night there.
      But that was risky: it could hardly help leaking out
      through Foljambe that she had done nothing of the sort, and
      the exposure, coupled with the loss of prestige, would be
      infinitely painful. "I must think of something better that
      that," she said to herself, and suddenly a great
      illumination shone on her. "I shall tell the truth," she
      heroically determined, "in all essentials. I shall say that
      Poppy's maid told me that I, the Mayor of Tilling was
      expected. That, though the party was abandoned, she still
      wanted me to come. That I found her asleep in a weedy
      courtyard, looking ghastly. That she evidently didn't feel
      up to entertaining me, but insisted that I should have tea.
      That I took photographs all over the place. All gospel
      truth, and no necessity for saying anything about that
      incredible mistake of hers in thinking that Georgie was the
      Mayor of Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll just have dinner at the Ambermere Arms, at
      Riseholme, Chapman," she called, "and then go back to
      Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was about half-past ten when Lucia's car drew up at the
      door of Mallards. She could scarcely believe that it was
      still the same day as that on which she had awoke here,
      regretful that she had fled from Riseholme on a false
      alarm, had swanked about Georgie staying at Sheffield
      Castle, had shirked the Council meeting to which duty had
      called her, had wangled an invitation to the Castle
      herself, had stayed there for quite three quarters of an
      hour, and had dined at Riseholme. "Quite like that huge
      horrid book by Mr. James Joyce, which all happens in one
      day," she reflected, as she stepped out of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, she saw that the garden-room was lit, and
      simultaneously she heard the piano: Georgie therefore must
      have come home. Surely (this time) she recognised the tune:
      it was the prayer in <i>Lucrezia.</i> He was playing that
      stormy introduction with absolute mastery, and he must be
      playing it by heart, for he could not have the score, nor,
      if he had, could he have read it. And then that
      unmistakeable soprano voice (though a little forced in the
      top register) began to sing. The wireless? Was Olga singing
      <i>Lucrezia</i> in London to-night? Impossible; for only a
      few hours ago during this interminable day, she was engaged
      to dine and sleep at Poppy's Castle. Besides, if this was
      relayed from Covent Garden, the orchestra, not the piano,
      would be accompanying her. Olga must be singing in the
      garden-room, and Georgie must be here, and nobody else
      could be here . . . There seemed to be material for another
      huge horrid book by Mr. James Joyce before the day was
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be perfectly calm and ladylike whatever happens,"
      thought Lucia, and concentrating all her power on this
      genteel feat she passed through the hall and went out to
      the garden-room. But before entering, she paused, for in
      her reverence for Art, she felt she could not interrupt so
      superb a performance: Olga had never sung so gloriously as
      now when she was singing to Georgie all alone. . . . She
      perched on the final note pianissimo. She held it with
      gradual crescendo till she was singing fortissimo. She
      ceased, and it was as if a great white flame had been blown
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia opened the door. Georgie was sitting in the window:
      his piece of needle-work had dropped from his hand, and he
      was gazing at the singer. "Too marvellous," he began,
      thinking that Grosvenor was coming in with drinks. Then, by
      some sixth sense, he knew it wasn't Grosvenor, and turning,
      he saw his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment he went through a selection of emotions that
      fully equalled hers. The first was blank consternation. A
      sense of baffled gallantry succeeded, and was followed by
      an overwhelming thankfulness that it was baffled. All
      evening he had been imagining himself delightfully in love
      with Olga, but had been tormented by the uneasy thought
      that any man of spirit would make some slight allusion to
      her magnetic charm. That would be a most perilous
      proceeding. He revelled in the feeling that he was in love
      with her, but to inform her of that might be supposed to
      lead to some small practical demonstration of his passion,
      and the thought made him feel cold with apprehension. She
      might respond (it was not likely but it was possible, for
      he had lately been reading a book by a very clever writer,
      which showed how lightly ladies in artistic professions,
      take an adorer's caresses), and he was quite convinced that
      he was no good at that sort of thing. On the other hand she
      might snub him, and that would wound his tenderest
      sensibilities. Whatever happened, in fact, it would
      entirely mar their lovely evening. Taking it all in all, he
      had never been so glad to see Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having pierced him with her eye, she turned her head calmly
      and gracefully towards Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a surprise!" she said. "A delightful one, of course.
      And you, no doubt, are equally surprised to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was being such a perfect lady that Olga quaked and
      quivered with suppressed laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, explain at once," she said. "It's the most
      wonderful muddle that ever happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's like this," said Georgie carefully. "As I
      telephoned you this morning, we were all invited to go to
      Poppy's for the night. Then she was taken ill after lunch
      and put us off. So I rang up in order to tell you that I
      was coming back here and bringing Olga. You told her to
      propose herself whenever she felt inclined, and just
      start--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia bestowed a polite bow on Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," she said. "But I never received that message.
      Oh--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you didn't," said Georgie. "I couldn't get any
      answer. But I knew you would be delighted to see her, and
      when we got here not long before dinner, Grosvenor said
      you'd gone to dine and sleep at Poppy's. Why didn't you
      answer my telephone? And why didn't you tell us you were
      going away? In fact, what about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      During this brief but convincing narrative, the thwarted
      Muse of Tragedy picked up her skirts and fled. Lucia gave a
      little trill of happy laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too extraordinary," she said. "A comedy of errors.
      Georgie, you told me this morning, very distinctly, that
      Poppy had invited the Mayor of Tilling. Very well. I found
      that there was nothing that required my pretence at the
      Council meeting, and I rang up Sheffield Cattle to say I
      could manage to get away. I was told that I was expected.
      Then just as I was starting there came a message that poor
      Poppy was ill and the party was off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paused a moment to review her facts as already
      rehearsed, and resumed in her superior, drawling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt a little uneasy about her," she said, "and as I had
      no further engagement this afternoon, I suggested that
      though the party was off, I would run over--the motor was
      actually at the door--and stay the night. She said she
      would be so happy to see me. She gave me such a pleasant
      welcome, but evidently she was far from well, and I saw she
      was not up to entertaining me. So I just had tea; she
      insisted on that, and she took me round the Castle and made
      me snap a quantity of photographs. Herself, her bedroom,
      the gallery, that noble oriel window in the hall. I must
      remember to send her prints. A delicious hour or two, and
      then I left her. I think my visit had done her good. She
      seemed brighter. Then a snack at the Ambermere Arms; I saw
      your house was dark, dear Olga, or I should have popped in.
      And here we are. That lovely prayer from <i>Lucrezia</i> to
      welcome me. I waited entranced on the doorstep till it was
      over."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only by strong and sustained effort that Olga
      restrained herself from howling with laughter. She hadn't
      been singing the prayer from <i>Lucrezia</i> this time, but
      <i>Les feux magiques,</i> by Berlioz; Lucia seemed quite
      unable--though of course she had been an agitated
      listener--to recognise the prayer when she heard it. But
      she was really a wonderful woman. Who but she would have
      had the genius to take advantage of Poppy's delusion that
      Georgie was the Mayor of Tilling? Then what about Lucia's
      swift return from the Castle? Without doubt Poppy had sent
      her away when she saw her female, beardless guest, and the
      clever creature had made out that it was she who had
      withdrawn as Poppy was so unwell, with a gallery of
      photographs to prove she had been there. Then she recalled
      Lucia's face when she entered the garden-room a few minutes
      ago, the face of a perfect lady who, unexpectedly returns
      home to find a wanton woman, bent on seduction, alone with
      her husband. Or was Georgie's evident relief at her advent
      funnier still? Impossible to decide, but she must not laugh
      till she could bury her face in her pillow. Lucia had a few
      sandwiches to refresh her after her drive, and they went up
      to bed. The two women kissed each other affectionately.
      Nobody kissed Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tilling next morning, unaware of Lucia's return, soon began
      to sprout with a crop of conjectures which, like mushrooms,
      sprang up all over the High Street. Before doing any
      shopping at all, Elizabeth rushed into Diva's tea-shop to
      obtain confirmation that Diva had actually seen Lucia
      driving away with Foljambe and luggage on the previous
      afternoon <i>en route</i> for Sheffield Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I did," said Diva. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth contracted her brows in a spasm of moral anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could believe," she said, "that it was all a
      blind, and that Worship didn't go to Sheffield Castle at
      all, but only wanted to make us think so, and returned home
      after a short drive by another route. Deceitful though that
      would be, it would be far, far better than what I fear may
      have happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you're nosing out some false scent as usual,"
      said Diva. "Get on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth made a feint of walking towards the door at this
      rude speech, but gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too terrible, Diva," she said. "Yesterday evening, it
      might have been about half-past six, I was walking up the
      street towards Mallards. A motor passed me, laden with
      luggage, and it stopped there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I suppose you stopped, too," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and out of it got Mr. Georgie and a big, handsome--yes,
      she was very handsome--woman, though, oh, so common. She
      stood on the doorstep a minute looking round, and sang out,
      'Georgino! How <i>divino!'</i> Such a screech! I judge so
      much by voice. In they went, and the luggage was taken in
      after them, and the door shut. Bang. And Worship, you tell
      me, had gone away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious me!" said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may well say that. And you may well say that I
      stopped. I did, for I was rooted to the spot. It was enough
      to root anybody. At that moment the Padre had come round
      the corner, and he was rooted too. As I didn't know then
      for certain whether Worship had actually gone--it might
      only have been one of her grand plans of which one hears no
      more--I said nothing to him, because it is so wicked to
      start any breath of scandal, until one has one's facts. It
      looks to me very black, and I shouldn't have thought it of
      Mr. Georgie. Whatever his faults--we all have faults--I did
      think he was a man of clean life. I still hope it may be
      so, for he has always conducted himself with propriety, as
      far as I know, to the ladies of Tilling, but I don't see
      how it possibly can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva gave a hoarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much temptation," she said, "from us old hags. But it
      is queer that he brought a woman of that sort to stay at
      Mallards on the very night Lucia was away. And then there's
      another thing. She told us all that <i>he</i> was going to
      stay at Poppy's last night--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't undertake to explain all that Worship tells us,"
      said Elizabeth. "That is asking too much of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--but he was here," said Diva. "Yet I shouldn't wonder if
      you'd got hold of the wrong end of the stick somehow. Habit
      of yours, Elizabeth. After all, the woman may have been a
      friend of Lucia's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and so Mr. Georgie brought her when Lucia was away. I
      see," said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pensive gaze wandered to the window, and she stiffened
      like a pointing setter, for down the street from Mallards
      was coming Georgie with the common, handsome, screeching
      woman. Elizabeth said nothing to Diva, for something might
      be done in the way of original research, and she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very dark clouds," she said, "but we must pray that they
      will break. I've done no shopping yet. I suppose Worship
      will be back some time to-day with a basket of strawberry
      leaves, if Poppy can spare her. Otherwise, the municipal
      life of Tilling will be suspended. Not that it matters two
      straws whether she's here or not. Quite a cypher in the
      Council."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that's not fair," shouted Diva angrily after her. "You
      can't have it both ways. Why she ever made you Mayoress--"
      but Elizabeth had shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva went down to her kitchen with an involuntary glow of
      admiration for Georgie, which was a positive shock to her
      moral principles. He and his <i>petit point,</i> and his
      little cape, and his old-maidish ways--was it possible that
      these cloaked a passionate temperament? Who could this
      handsome, common female be? Where had he picked her up?
      Perhaps in the hotel when he and Lucia had stayed in
      London, for Diva seemed to have heard that voluptuous
      assignations were sometimes made in the most respectable
      places. What a rogue! And how frightful for Lucia, if she
      got to know about it. "I'm sure I hope she won't," thought
      Diva, "but it wouldn't be bad for her to be taken down a
      peg or two, though I should pity her at the same time.
      However, one mustn't rush to conclusions. But it's shocking
      that I've got a greater respect for Mr. Georgie than I ever
      had before. Can't make it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva got to work with her pastry-making, but some odd
      undercurrent of thought went trickling on. What a
      starvation diet for a man of ardent temperament, as Georgie
      now appeared, must his life in Tilling have been, where all
      the women were so very undecorative. If there had only been
      a woman with a bit of brilliance about her, whom he could
      admire and flirt with just a little, all this might have
      been averted. She left Janet to finish the shortbread, and
      went out to cull developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth meantime had sighted her prey immediately, and
      from close at hand observed the guilty pair entering the
      photographer's. Were the shameless creatures, she wondered,
      going to be photographed together? That was the sort of
      bemused folly that sinning couples often committed, and
      bitterly rued it afterwards. She glided in after them, but
      Georgie was only giving the shopman a roll of negatives to
      be developed and printed and sent up to Mallards as soon as
      possible. He took off his hat to her very politely, but
      left the shop without introducing her to his companion
      which was only natural and showed good feeling. Certainly
      she was remarkably handsome. Beautifully dressed. A row of
      pearls so large that they could not be real. Hatless with
      waved hair. Rouge. Lipstick. . . . She went in pursuit
      again. They passed the Padre and his wife, who turned
      completely round to look at them; they passed Susan in her
      Royce (she had given up tricycling in this hot weather) who
      held her head out of the window till foot passengers
      blocked her view of them, and Diva, standing on her
      doorstep with her market basket, was rooted to the spot as
      firmly as Elizabeth had been the night before. The woman
      was a dream of beauty with her brilliant colouring and her
      high, arched eyebrows. Recovering her powers of locomotion,
      Diva went into the hairdressing and toilet saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth bought some parsnips at Twistevant's, deep in
      thought. Bitter moralist though she was, she could not
      withhold her admiration for the anonymous female. Diva had
      rudely alluded to the ladies of Tilling as old hags, and
      was there not a grain of truth in it? They did not make the
      best of themselves. What brilliance that skilfully applied
      rouge and lipstick gave a face! Without it the anonymous
      might have looked ten years older and far less attractive.
      "Hair, too," thought Elizabeth, "that soft brown, so like a
      natural tint. But fingernails, dripping with bright
      arterial blood: never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went straight to the hair-dressing and toilet
      establishment. Diva was just coming out of the shop
      carrying a small packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little titivations, dear?" asked Elizabeth, reading her
      own thoughts unerringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tooth-powder," said Diva without hesitation, and scooted
      across the road to where Susan was still leaning out of the
      window of her Royce and beckoning to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen her," she said (there was no need to ask who
      'she' was). "And I recognised her at once from her picture
      in the <i>Tatler.</i> You'd never guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I know I shouldn't," said Diva impatiently. "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The great prima donna. Dear me, I've forgotten her name.
      But the one Lucia went to hear sing in London," said Susan.
      "Bracelet, wasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bracely? Olga Bracely?" cried Diva. "Are you <i>quite</i>
      sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positive. Quite lovely, and such hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough, and Diva twinkled back across the road to
      intercept Elizabeth who was just coming out of the
      hair-dressing and toilet shop with a pink packet in her
      hand, which she instantly concealed below the parsnips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a screechy voice, didn't you say, Elizabeth?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, frightful. It went right through me like a railway
      whistle. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the prima donna, Olga Bracely. That's all," said
      Diva. "Voice must have gone. Sad for her. Glad to have told
      you who she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon all Tilling knew who was the lovely
      <i>maquillée</i> woman with the pearls, who had stayed the
      night alone with Georgie at Mallards. Lucia had not been
      seen at all this morning, and it was taken for granted that
      she was still away on that snobbish expedition for which
      she had thrown over her Council meeting. Though Olga (so
      she said) was a dear friend, it would certainly be a
      surprise to her, when she returned to find her dear friend
      staying with her husband at her own house, when she had
      told Tilling that both Georgie and Olga were staying that
      night at Poppy's Castle. Or would Olga leave Tilling again
      before Lucia returned? Endless interpretations could be put
      on this absorbing incident, but Tilling was too dazzled
      with the prima donna herself, her pearls, her beauty, her
      reputation as the Queen of Song to sit in judgment on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a dream of charm and loveliness she was with her
      delicately rouged cheeks and vermilion mouth, and that air
      of joyous and unrepentant paganism! For Evie her blood-red
      nails had a peculiar attraction, and she too went to the
      hair-dressing and toilet establishment, and met Susan just
      coming out.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia meantime had spent a municipal morning in the
      garden-room without showing herself even for a moment at
      the window. Her departmental boxes were grouped round her,
      but she gave them very little attention. She was completely
      satisfied with the explanation of the strange adventures
      which had led to the staggering discovery of Olga and
      Georgie alone in her house the night before, and was
      wondering whether Tilling need ever know how very brief her
      visit to Poppy had been. It certainly was not her business
      to tell her friends that a cup of tea had been the only
      hospitality she had received. Then her photographs (if they
      came out) would be ready by to-morrow, and if she gave a
      party in the evening she would leave her scrap-book open on
      the piano. She would not call attention to it, but there it
      would be, furnishing unshakable ocular evidence of her
      visit . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, accordingly, she rang up all her more intimate
      circle, and, without definitely stating that she had this
      moment returned to Tilling from Sheffield Castle, let it be
      understood that such was the case. It had been such a
      lovely morning: she had enjoyed her drive so much: she had
      found a mass of arrears waiting for her, and she asked them
      all to dine next night at eight. She apologized for such
      short notice, but her dear friend Olga Bracely, who was
      here on a short visit, would be leaving the day after--a
      gala night at the opera--and it would give her such
      pleasure to meet them all. But, as she and Olga went up to
      dress next evening, she told Olga that dinner would be at
      eightish: say ten minutes past eight. There was a subtle
      reason for this, for the photographs of Sheffield Castle
      had arrived and she had pasted them into her scrap-book.
      Tilling would thus have time to admire and envy before Olga
      appeared: Lucia felt that her friends would not take much
      interest in them if she was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had any party in Tilling worn so brilliant and
      unexpected an appearance as that which assembled in the
      garden-room the following night. Evie and the Padre arrived
      first: Evie's finger nails looked as if she had pinched
      them all, except one, in the door, causing the blood to
      flow freely underneath each. She had forgotten about that
      one, and it looked frost-bitten. Elizabeth and Benjy came
      next: Elizabeth's cheeks were like the petals of wild
      roses, but she had not the nerve to incarnadine her mouth,
      which, by contrast, appeared to be afflicted with the
      cyanosis which precedes death. Diva, on the other hand, had
      been terrified at the aspect of blooming youth which rouge
      gave her, and she had wiped it off at the last moment,
      retaining the Cupid's bow of a vermilion mouth, and two
      thin arched eyebrows in charcoal. Susan, wearing the Order
      of the British Empire, had had her grey hair waved, and it
      resembled corrugated tin roofing: Mr. Wyse and Georgie wore
      their velvet suits. It took them all a few minutes to get
      used to each other, for they were like butterflies which
      had previously only known each other in the caterpillar or
      chrysalis stage, and they smiled and simpered like new
      acquaintances in the most polite circles, instead of old
      and censorious friends. Olga had not yet appeared, and so
      they had time to study Lucia's album of snap-shots which
      lay open on the piano, and she explained in a casual manner
      what the latest additions were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A corner of the Courtyard of Sheffield Castle," she said.
      "Not come out very well. The Norman tower. The dining hall.
      The Duchess's bedroom; wonderful Elizabethan bed. The
      picture gallery. She is standing looking out of the window
      with her Pekingese. Such a sweet. It jumped up on the
      window-seat just before I snapped. The Duchess at the
      tea-table--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a big cake!" interrupted Diva professionally.
      "Sugared, too. So she does eat something besides dressed
      crab. Hope she didn't have much cake after her
      indigestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what a shabby court-yard," said Evie. "I should have
      thought a Duke would have liked his Castle to look tidier.
      Why doesn't he tell his gardener to weed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth felt she would burst unless she put in a venomous
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Worship, when you write to thank her Grace for your
      pleasant visit, you must say, just in fun, of course, that
      you expect the court-yard to be tidied up before you come
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was perfectly capable of dealing with such clumsy
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a good idea!" she said. "You always think of the
      right thing, Elizabeth. Certainly I will. Remind me,
      Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the photographs did their work. Tilling could not doubt
      that Lucia had been wrapped in the Norman embrace of
      Sheffield Castle, and determined silently and sternly never
      again to allude to the painful subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      That suited Lucia admirably, for there were questions that
      might be asked about her visit which would involve
      regrettable admissions if she was to reply quite
      truthfully. Just as her friends were turning surfeited and
      sad from the album a step was heard outside and Olga
      appeared in the doorway. A white gown, high at the neck,
      reeking of Molyneux and simplicity. A scarlet girdle, and
      pearls as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lucia," she cried, "I see I'm late. Forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own! I always forgive you as soon as I see you, only
      there is never anything to forgive," said Lucia effusively.
      "Now I needn't say who you are, but this is Mrs. Bartlett
      and our Padre, and here are Mr. and Mrs. Wyse, and this is
      Diva Plaistow, and here's my beloved Mayoress, Elizabeth
      Mapp-Flint and Major Mapp-Flint--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga looked from Benjy to Elizabeth and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely I recognise them," she said. "That marvellous
      picture, which everybody raves about--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, little me," said the beaming Elizabeth, "and my Benjy
      in the clouds. What an eye you've got, Miss Bracely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is my husband," went on Lucia with airy humour,
      "who says he thinks he has met you before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe we did meet somewhere, but ages ago, and he
      won't remember me," said Olga. "Oh, Georgie, I mustn't
      drink sherry, but as you've poured it out for me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner," said Grosvenor rather sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hard overhead light of the dining-room, the ladies
      of Tilling, novices in <i>maquillage,</i> looked strangely
      spurious, but the consciousness in each of her rejuvenated
      appearance, combined with Olga's gay presence, made them
      feel exceptionally brilliant. All round the table
      conversation was bright and eager, and they all talked at
      her, striving to catch her attention. Benjy, sitting next
      her, began telling her one of his adventures with a tiger,
      but instantly Susan raised her voice and spoke of her
      tricycle. Her husband chipped in, and with an eye on Olga
      told Lucia that his sister the Contessa di Faraglione was a
      passionate student of the age of Lucrezia Borgia. Diva,
      longing to get Olga to come to ye olde tea-house, spoke
      loudly about her new recipe for sardine tartlets, but Lucia
      overrode so commercial a subject by the introduction of the
      Mayoral Motif coupled with slums. Olga herself chattered
      and laughed, the only person present who was not anxious to
      make a favourable impression. She lit a cigarette long
      before dinner was over, and though Elizabeth had once
      called that "a disgusting foreign habit" she lit one, too.
      Olga ate a cherry beginning with the end of the stalk and
      at once Benjy was trying to do the same, ejaculating, as it
      dropped into his finger bowl, "Not so easy, by Jove." There
      was no Bridge to-night, but by incessant harping on antique
      dances, Lucia managed to get herself asked to tread a
      minuet with Georgie. Olga accompanied them, and as she rose
      from the piano, she became aware that they were all looking
      at her with the expectant air of dogs that hope to be taken
      out for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly if you want me to," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down at the piano again. And she sang.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c10"
          id="c10">CHAPTER X</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Though Tilling remained the same at heart, Olga's brief
      visit had considerably changed the decorative aspect of its
      leading citizenesses. The use of powder on the face on very
      hot days when prominent features were apt to turn crimson,
      or on very cold ones, when prominent features were apt to
      turn mauve, had always been accepted, but that they should
      embellish themselves with rouge and lipstick and arched
      eyebrows was a revolution indeed. They had always
      considered such aids to loveliness as typical of women who
      shamelessly advertised their desire to capture the
      admiration of males, and that was still far from their
      intentions. But Diva found that arched eyebrows carefully
      drawn where there were none before gave her a look of
      high-bred surprise: Elizabeth that the rose-mantled cheeks
      she now saw in her looking-glass made her feel (not only
      appear) ten years younger: Susan that her corrugated hair
      made her look like a French <i>marquise.</i> Irene, who had
      been spending a fortnight of lionization in London, was
      amazed at the change when she returned, and expressed her
      opinion of it, by appearing in the High Street with the tip
      of her nose covered with green billiard-chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She at once got to work on the portrait which Lucia had
      commissioned. She had amplified Lucia's biographical
      suggestion, and it represented her in full Mayoral robes
      and chain and a three-cornered hat playing the piano in the
      garden-room. Departmental boxes were piled in the
      background, a pack of cards and a paint-box lay on the lid
      of the piano, and her bicycle leaned against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Symbols, beloved," said the artist, "indicating your
      marvellous many-sidedness. I know you don't ride your
      bicycle in the garden-room, nor play cards on your piano,
      nor wear your robes when you're at your music, but I group
      your completeness round you. Ah! Hold that expression of
      indulgent disdain for the follies of the world for a
      moment. Think of the Tilling hags and their rouge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like that?" asked Lucia, curling her upper lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not at all like that. Try another. Be proud and calm.
      Think of spending an evening with your Duchess--darling,
      why are you such a snob?--or just think of yourself with
      all your faults and splendours. Perfect!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene stepped back from her easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I've got it!" she cried. "There's not a living artist
      and very few dead ones who could have seized that so
      unerringly. How monstrous that my work should be hated just
      because I am a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your picture was the picture of the year," said Lucia,
      "and all the critics cracked it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I felt the undercurrent of hostility. Men are
      such self-centred brutes. Wait till I publish my memoirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But aren't you rather young for that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm twenty-five, and by that age everyone has
      experienced all that matters, or anyhow has imagined it.
      Oh, tell me the truth about what all the painted hags are
      whispering. Georgie and Olga Bracely being alone here. What
      happened really? Did you arrange it all for them? How
      perfect of you! Nobody but you would be so modern and
      open-minded. And Tilling's respect for Georgie has gone up
      enormously."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia stared at her a moment, assimilating this monstrous
      suggestion, then sprang to her feet with a gasp of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the poisonous tongues!" she cried. "Oh, the asps. And
      besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped. She found herself entangled in the web she
      herself had woven, and never had any spider known to
      natural history so completely encircled itself. She had
      told Tilling that she was going to dine and sleep at
      Poppy's Castle, and had shewn everybody those elegant
      photographs as tacit evidence that she had done so. Tilling
      therefore, had concluded that Olga and Georgie had spent
      the night alone at Mallards, and here was Irene intolerably
      commending her for her open-mindedness not only in
      condoning but in promoting this assignation. The fair fame,
      the unsullied morality of herself and Georgie, not to
      mention Olga, was at stake, and (oh, how it hurt!) she
      would be forced to give the utmost publicity to the fact
      that she had come back to Tilling the same evening. That
      would be a frightful loss of prestige, but there was no
      choice. She laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foolish of me to have been indignant for a single moment
      at such an idea!" she said. "I never heard such rubbish. I
      found poor Poppy very unwell, so I just had tea with her,
      cheered her up and took some photographs and came home at
      once. Tilling is really beyond words!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, what a disappointment!" said Irene. "It would
      have been so colossal of you. And what a comedown for poor
      Georgie. Just an old maid again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was very soon known, and Tilling felt that Lucia
      and Georgie had let them down. Everything had been so
      exciting and ducal and compromising, and there was really
      nothing left of it. Elizabeth and Diva lost no time in
      discussing it in Diva's tea-room next morning when
      marketing was done, and were severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deceitfulness of it is what disgusts me most," said
      the Mayoress. "Far worse than the snobbishness. Worship let
      it be widely known that she was staying the night with
      Poppy, and then she skulks back, doesn't appear at all next
      morning to make us think that she was still away--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And shows us all those photographs," chimed in Diva, "as a
      sort of . . . what's the word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say, dear," said Elizabeth, regarding her rose-leaf
      cheeks with high approval in the looking-glass over the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affidavit, that's it, as testifying that she had stayed
      with Poppy. Never told us she hadn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My simple brain can't follow her conjuring tricks," said
      Elizabeth, "and I should be sorry if it could. But I'm only
      too thankful she did come back. It will be a great relief
      to the Padre, I expect, to be told that. I wonder, if you
      insist on knowing what I think, whether Mr. Georgie somehow
      decoyed that lovely creature to Tilling, telling her that
      Lucia was here. That's only my guess, and if so we must try
      to forgive him, for if anything is certain in this bad
      business, it is that he's madly in love with her. I know
      myself how a man looks--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva gave a great gasp, but her eyebrows could not express
      any higher degree of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Elizabeth!" she cried. "Was a man ever madly in love
      with you? Who was it? Do tell me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are things one can't speak of even to an old friend
      like you," said Elizabeth. "Yes, he's madly in love with
      her, and I think Worship knows it. Did you notice her
      demonstrations of affection to sweet Olga? She was making
      the best of it, I believe; putting on a brazen--no, let us
      say a brave face. How worn and anxious she looked the other
      night when we were all so gay. That pitiful little minuet!
      I'm sorry for her. When she married Mr. Georgie, she
      thought life would be so safe and comfortable. A sad
      awakening, poor thing . . . Oh, another bit of news. Quaint
      Irene tells me she is doing a portrait of Worship. Quite
      marvellous, she says, and it will be ready for our summer
      exhibition. After that Lucia means to present it to the
      Borough, and have it hung in the Town Hall. And Irene's
      Academy picture of Benjy and me will be back in time for
      our exhibition, too. Interesting to compare them."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia bore her loss of prestige with characteristic
      gallantry. Indeed, she seemed to be quite unconscious that
      she had lost any, and continued to let her album of
      snapshots remain open on the piano at the Sheffield Castle
      page, and airily talked about the Florentine mirror which
      just did not come into the photograph of Poppy's bedroom.
      Occasionally a tiresome moment occurred, as when Elizabeth,
      being dummy at a Bridge-party in the garden-room, pored
      over the Castle page, and came back to her place, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "So clever of you, Worship, to take so many pretty
      photographs in so short a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was not the least disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They were all very short exposures, dear," she said. "I
      will explain that to you sometime."
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody thought that a very fit retort, for now the
      Poppy-crisis was no longer recent, and it was not the
      custom of Tilling to keep such incidents alive too long: it
      was not generous or kind, and besides, they grew stale. But
      Lucia paid her back in her own coin, for next day, when
      playing Bridge at the Mapp-Flints, she looked long and
      earnestly at Benjy's tiger-whip, which now hung in its old
      place among bead-aprons and Malayan creases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the one he broke at his interesting lecture, dear
      Elizabeth," she asked, "or the one he lost at Diva's
      tea-rooms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie continued to squeak in a disconcerting manner during
      the whole of the next hand, and the Poppy-crisis (for the
      present) was suffered to lapse.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The annual Art Exhibition moved into the foreground of
      current excitements, and the Tilling artists sent in their
      contributions: Lucia her study of dahlias, entitled
      "<i>Belli fiori</i> ", and a sketch of the courtyard of
      Sheffield Castle, which she had weeded for purposes of Art.
      She called it "From Memory", though it was really from her
      photograph, and, without specifying the Castle, she added
      the motto
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      "The splendour falls on Castle walls."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sent in "A misty morning on the Marsh". She was
      fond of misty mornings, because the climatic conditions
      absolutely prohibited defined draughtsmanship. Georgie
      (without any notion of challenging her) contributed "A
      sunny morning on the Marsh", with sheep and dykes and
      clumps of ragwort very clearly delineated: Mr. Wyse, one of
      his usual still-life studies of a silver tankard, a glass
      half-full of (probably) Capri wine, and a spray of
      nasturtiums: Diva another piece of still life, in pastel,
      of two buns and a tartlet (probably sardine) on a plate.
      This was perhaps an invasion of Mr. Wyse's right to
      reproduce still life, but Diva had to be in the kitchen so
      much, waiting for kettles to boil and buns to rise, that
      she had very little leisure for landscape. Susan Wyse sent
      a mystical picture of a budgerigar with a halo above its
      head, and rays of orange light emanating from the primary
      feathers of its spread wings: "Lost Awhile" was the
      touching title. But in spite of these gems, the exhibition
      was really Irene's show. She had been elected an honorary
      member of the hanging committee, and at their meetings she
      showed that she fully appreciated this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My birth of Venus," she stated, "must be hung quite by
      itself at one end of the room, with all the studies I made
      for it below. They are of vast interest. Opposite it, also
      by itself, must be my picture of Lucia. There were no
      studies for that; it was an inspiration, but none of your
      potty little pictures must be near it. Hang them where you
      like--oh, darling Lucia, you don't mind your dahlias and
      your Castle walls being quite out of range, do you? But
      those are my terms, and if you don't like them, I shall
      withdraw my pictures. And the walls behind them must be
      painted duck's egg green. Take it or leave it. Now I can't
      bother about settling about the rest, so I shall go away.
      Let me know what you decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no choice. To reject the picture of the year and
      that which Irene promised them should be the picture of
      next year was inconceivable. The end walls of the studio
      where the exhibition was held were painted duck's egg
      green, a hydrangea and some ferns were placed beneath each,
      and in front of them a row of chairs. Lucia, as Mayor,
      opened the show and made an inaugural speech, tracing the
      history of pictorial Art from earliest times, and, coming
      down to the present, alluded to the pictures of all her
      friends, the poetical studies of the marsh, the loving
      fidelity of the still life exhibits, the spiritual uplift
      of the budgerigar. "Of the two great works of Miss Coles,"
      she concluded, "which will make our exhibition so
      ever-memorable, I need not speak. One has already acquired
      world-wide fame, and I hope it will not be thought
      egotistic of me if I confidently prophesy that the other
      will also. I am violating no secrets if I say that it will
      remain in Tilling in some conspicuous and public place, the
      cherished possession for ever of our historic town."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, she smiled, she accepted a special copy of the
      catalogue, which Georgie had decorated with a blue riband,
      and, very tactfully, instead of looking at the picture of
      herself, sat down with him in front of that of Elizabeth
      and Benjy, audibly pointing out its beauties to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful brush-work," she said, waving her catalogue as
      if it was a paintbrush. "Such life and movement! The waves.
      Venus's button boots. Quite Dutch. But how Irene has
      developed since then! Presently we will look at the picture
      of me with this fresh in our minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth and Benjy were compelled, by the force of Lucia's
      polite example, to sit in front of her picture, and they
      talked quietly behind their catalogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't make head or tail of it," murmured Benjy. "I never
      saw such a jumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little puzzling at first," said Elizabeth, "but I'm
      beginning to grasp it. Seated at her piano you see, to show
      how divinely she plays. Scarlet robe and chain, to show
      she's Mayor. Cards littered about for her Bridge. Rather
      unkind. Bicycle leaning against the piano. Her paint-box
      because she's such a great artist. A pity the whole thing
      looks like a jumble-sale, with Worship as auctioneer. And
      such a sad falling off as a work of Art. I'm afraid success
      has gone to Irene's head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time we looked at our own picture," said Benjy. "Fancy
      this daub in the Town Hall, if that's what she meant by
      some conspicuous and public place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It hasn't got there yet," whispered Elizabeth. "As a
      Councillor, I shall have something to say to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed over to the other side of the room, passing
      Lucia and Georgie on the way, as if in some figure of the
      Lancers. Evie and the Padre were standing close in front of
      the Venus and Evie burst into a series of shrill squeaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me! Did you ever, Kenneth!" she said. "Poor
      Elizabeth. What a face and so like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well indeed!" said Kenneth. "Surely the puir oyster-shell
      canna' bear that weight, and down she'll go and get a
      ducking. An' the Major up in the clouds wi' his wee bottle
      . . . Eh, and here's Mistress Mapp-Flint herself and her
      guid man. A proud day for ye. Come along wifie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene had not been at the opening, but now she entered in
      her shorts and scarlet jersey. Her eye fell on the
      hydrangea below the Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that foul thing away," she screamed. "It kills my
      picture. What, another of them under my Lucia! Throw them
      into the street, somebody. By whose orders were they put
      there? Where's the hanging Committee? I summon the hanging
      Committee."
    </p>
    <p>
      The offending vegetables were borne away by Georgie and the
      Padre, and Irene, having cooled down, joined Benjy and
      Elizabeth by the Venus. She looked from it to them and from
      them to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, how I've improved since I did that!" she said. "I
      think I must repaint some of it, and put more character
      into your faces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't touch it, dear," said Elizabeth nervously. "It's
      perfect as it is. Genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," said Irene, "but a few touches would make it
      more scathing. There's rouge on your cheeks now, Mapp, and
      that would give your face a hungry impropriety. I'll see to
      that this afternoon when the exhibition closes for the
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not while it's on view, quaint one," argued Elizabeth.
      "The Committee accepted it as it was. Most irregular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll like it far better when I've touched it up," said
      Irene. "You'll see;" and she joined Lucia and Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, it's not unworthy of you, is it?" she asked. "And
      how noble you are to give it to the Borough for the Town
      Hall. It must hang just above the Mayor's chair. That's the
      only place for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be no difficulty about that," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She announced her gift to the Town Council at their next
      meeting, coupled with the artist's desire that it should be
      hung on the wall behind the Mayor's chair. Subdued
      respectful applause followed her gracious speech and an
      uncomfortable silence, for most of her Councillors had
      already viewed the work of Art with feelings of bewildered
      stupefaction. Then she was formally thanked for her
      generous intention and the Town-Clerk intimated that before
      the Borough accepted any gift, a small committee was always
      appointed to inspect it. Apart from Elizabeth, who said she
      would be honoured to serve on it, some diffidence was
      shown; several Councillors explained that they had no
      knowledge of the pictorial art, but eventually two of them
      said they would do their best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Committee met next morning at the exhibition, and sat
      in depressed silence in front of the picture. Then
      Elizabeth sighed wistfully and said "Tut, tut" and the two
      others looked to her for a lead. She continued to gaze at
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me to say something, gentlemen?" she asked, suddenly
      conscious of their scrutiny. "Well, if you insist. I trust
      you will disagree with what I feel I'm bound to say, for
      otherwise I fear a very painful duty lies in front of us.
      So generous of our beloved Mayor, and so like her, isn't
      it? But I don't see how it is possible for us to recommend
      the Council to accept her gift. I wouldn't for the world
      set up my opinion against yours, but that's what I feel.
      Most distressing for me, you will well understand, being so
      intimate a friend of hers, but private affection cannot
      rank against public responsibility." A slight murmur of
      sympathy followed this speech, and the committee found that
      they were of one mind in being conscientiously unable to
      recommend the Council to accept the Mayor's gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very sad," said Elizabeth, shaking her head. "Our
      proceedings, I take it, are confidential until we
      communicate them officially to the Council."
    </p>
    <p>
      When her colleagues had gone, the Mayoress strolled round
      the gallery. A misty morning on the marsh really looked
      very well: its vague pearly opalescence seemed to emphasize
      the faulty drawing in Georgie's sunny morning on the marsh
      and Diva's tartlets. Detaching herself from it, she went to
      the Venus, and a horrified exclamation burst from her.
      Quaint Irene had carried out her awful threat, had tinged
      her cheeks with unnatural colour, and had outlined her
      mouth with a thin line of vermilion, giving it a coyly
      beckoning expression. So gross a parody of her face and
      indeed of her character could not be permitted to remain
      there: something must be done, and, leaving the gallery in
      great agitation, she went straight to Mallards, for no one
      but Lucia had the smallest influence with that quaint and
      venomous young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mayor had snatched a short respite from her incessant
      work, and was engaged on a picture of some fine holly-hocks
      in her garden. She was feeling very buoyant, for the
      Poppy-crisis seemed to be quite over, and she knew that she
      had guessed correctly the purport of her Mayoress's desire
      to see her on urgent business. Invisible to mortal eye,
      there was a brazier of coals of fire on the lawn beside
      her, which she would presently pour on to the Mayoress's
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear Elizabeth," she said. "I've just
      snatched half an hour while good Mrs. Simpson is typing
      some letters for me. Susan and Mr. Wyse have implored me to
      do another little flower-study for our <i>esposizione,</i>
      to fill up the vacant place by my dahlias. I shall call it
      'Jubilant July'. As you know, I am always at your disposal.
      What good wind blows you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely of you to spare the time," said Elizabeth. "I've
      just been to the <i>esposizione,</i> and I felt it was my
      duty to see you at once. Quaint Irene has done something
      too monstrous. She's altered my face; she's given it a most
      disgusting expression. The picture can't be allowed to
      remain there in its present condition. I wondered if you
      with your great influence--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia half-closed her eyes, and regarded her sketch with
      intolerable complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: that curious picture of Irene's," she said at length.
      "What a Puck-like genius! I went with her to our gallery a
      couple of hours ago, to see what she had done to the Venus:
      she was so eager to know what I thought about her little
      alterations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An outrage, an abomination!" cried Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not put it quite as strongly as that," said
      Lucia, returning to her holly-hocks and putting in a vein
      on one of the leaves with exquisite delicacy. "But I told
      her that I could not approve of those new touches. They
      introduced, to my mind, a note of farce into her satire,
      which was out of place, though amusing in itself. She
      agreed with me after a little argument into which I need
      not go. She will remove them again during the lunch hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh thank you, dear," said Elizabeth effusively. "I always
      say what a true friend you are. I was terribly upset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all," said Lucia sucking her paint-brush.
      "Quite easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth turned her undivided attention to the
      holly-hocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lovely sketch!" she said. "How it will enrich our
      exhibition. Thank you, dear, again. I won't keep you from
      your work any longer. How you find time for all you do is a
      constant amazement to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ambled swiftly away. It would have been awkward if, at
      such a genial moment, Lucia had asked whether the artistic
      committee appointed by the Council had inspected Irene's
      other masterpiece yet.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The holiday months of August and September were at hand,
      when the ladies of Tilling were accustomed to let their
      houses and move into smaller houses themselves at a cheaper
      rent than what they received. Diva, for instance, having
      let her own house, was accustomed to move into Irene's, who
      took a remote cottage on the marsh, where she could pursue
      her art and paint nude studies of herself in a
      looking-glass. But this year Diva refused to quit ye olde
      tea-house, when, with the town full of visitors, she would
      be doing so roaring a business; the Wyses decided not to go
      to Italy to stay with the Contessa, since international
      relations were so strained, and Lucia felt it her duty as
      Mayor, to remain in Tilling. The only letting done, in
      fact, was by the Padre, who left his curate in charge,
      while he and Evie took a prolonged holiday in bonnie
      Scotland, and let the Vicarage to the Mapp-Flints who had a
      most exciting tenant. This was a Miss Susan Leg, who, so
      Tilling was thrilled to learn from an interview she gave to
      a London paper, was none other than the world-wide
      novelist, Rudolph da Vinci. Miss Leg (so she stated in this
      piece of self-revelation) never took a holiday. "I shall
      not rest," she finely observed, "till the shadows of life's
      eventide close round me," and she went on to explain that
      she would be studying, in view of a future book, this
      little centre of provincial English life. "I am well
      aware," said Miss Leg, "that my readers expect of me an
      aristocratic setting for my romances, but I intend to prove
      to them that life is as full of human interest in any
      simple, humble country village as in Belgravia and the
      country-houses of the nobility."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia read this interview aloud to Georgie. It seemed to
      suggest possibilities. She veiled these in her usual
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rudolph da Vinci," she said musingly. "I have heard her
      name now I come to think of it. She seems to expect us all
      to be yokels and bumpkins. I fancy she will have to change
      her views a little. No doubt she will get some introduction
      to me, and I shall certainly ask her to tea. If she is as
      uppish and superior as she appears to be, that would be
      enough. We don't want best-sellers to write up our cultured
      vivid life here. So cheap and vulgarising; not in
      accordance with our traditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing, Georgie knew, that would fill Lucia with
      deeper pride than that traditions should be violated and
      life vulgarised, and even while she uttered these high
      sentiments a vision rose in her mind of Rudolph da Vinci
      writing a best-seller, with the scene laid in Tilling, and
      with herself, quite undisguised, as head of its social and
      municipal activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet one must not prejudge her," she went on, as this
      vision grew brighter. "I must order a book of hers and read
      it, before I pass judgment on her work. And we may find her
      a very pleasant sort of woman. Perhaps I had better call on
      her, Georgie, for I should not like her to think that I
      slighted her, and then I will ask her to dine with us,
      <i>très intime,</i> just you and she and I. I should be
      sorry if her first impressions of Tilling were not worthy
      of us. Diva, for instance, it would be misleading if she
      saw Diva with those extraordinary eyebrows, bringing up
      teas from the kitchen, purple in the face, and thought her
      representative of our social life. Or if Elizabeth with her
      rouged cheeks asked her to dine at the Parsonage, and Benjy
      told his tiger-stories. Yes, I will call on her as soon as
      she arrives, and get hold of her. I will take her to our
      Art Exhibition, allow her to sign the Mayor's book as a
      distinguished visitor, and make her free of my house
      without ceremony. We will show her our real, inner life.
      Perhaps she plays Bridge: I will ascertain that when I
      call. I might almost meet her at the station, if I can find
      out when she arrives. Or it might be better if you met her
      at the station as representing me, and I would call on her
      at Grebe half an hour afterwards. That would be more
      regular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elizabeth told me that she arrives by the
      three-twenty-five to-day," said Georgie. "And she has hired
      a motor and is meeting her."
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not require so keen a nose as Lucia's to scent
      rivalry, but she gave no hint of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very proper," she said. "Elizabeth no doubt will drive her
      to Grebe, and show her tenant the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia bicycled to Grebe about tea-time, but found that Miss
      Leg had driven into the town, accompanied by the Mayoress,
      to have tea. She left her official card, as Mayor of
      Tilling, and went straight to the Vicarage. But Elizabeth
      was also out, and Lucia at once divined that she had taken
      Miss Leg to have tea at Diva's. She longed to follow and
      open operations at once, but decided to let the Mayoral
      card do its work. On her way home she bought a copy of the
      25th edition of the novelist's <i>Kind Hearts and
      Coronets,</i> and dipped into it. It was very sumptuous. On
      the first page there was a Marchioness who had promised to
      open a village bazaar and was just setting off to do so,
      when a telephone message arrived that a Royal Princess
      would like to visit her that afternoon. "Tell her Royal
      Highness," said that kind-hearted woman, "that I have a
      long-standing engagement, and cannot disappoint my people.
      I will hurry back as soon as the function is over. . . ."
      Lucia pictured herself coming back rather late to entertain
      Miss Leg at lunch--Georgie would be there to receive
      her--because it was her day for reading to the inmates of
      the workhouse. She would return with a copy of <i>Kind
      Hearts and Coronets</i> in her hand, explaining that the
      dear old bodies implored her to finish the chapter. The
      idea of Miss Leg writing a best-seller about Tilling became
      stupefyingly sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie came in, bringing the evening post.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter from Olga," he said, "and she's written to me
      too, so it's sure to be the same. She wants us to go to
      Riseholme to-morrow for two days, as she's got music. A
      string quartette coming down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia read her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, most kind of her," she said. "But how can I get away?
      Ah, she anticipates that, and says that if I'm too busy she
      will understand. And it would look so marked if I went away
      directly after Miss Leg had arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for you to judge," he said. "If you think she
      matters, I expect you're right, because Elizabeth's getting
      a pretty firm hold. I've been introduced to her: Elizabeth
      brought her in to tea at Diva's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I imagined that had happened," said Lucia. "What about
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A funny little round red thing, rather like Diva. Swanky.
      She's brought a butler and a footman, she told us, and her
      new Daimler will get down late to-night. And she asked if
      any of the nobility had got country seats near Tilling--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you tell her that I dined and slept--that Duchess
      Poppy asked me to dine and sleep at the Castle?"
      interrupted Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Georgie. "I thought of it, but then I judged it
      was wiser not to bring it up again. She ate a whole lot of
      buns, and she was very gracious to Diva, (which Diva didn't
      like much) and told her she would order her
      <i>chef</i>--her very words--to send her a recipe for cream
      wafers. Elizabeth's toadying her like anything. She said
      'Oh, how kind, Miss Leg. You are lucky, dear Diva.' And
      they were going on to see the church afterwards, and Leg's
      dining with the Mapp-Flints tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia reviewed this rather sinister intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate to disappoint dear Olga," she said, "but I think I
      had better stop here. What about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I shall go," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had to leave for Riseholme next morning without a
      maid, for in view of the entertainment that might be going
      on at Mallards, Lucia could not spare either Foljambe or
      Grosvenor. She spent a long time at the garden-room window
      that afternoon, and told her cook to have a good tea ready
      to be served at a moment's notice, for Miss Leg would
      surely return her call to-day. Presently a large car came
      bouncing up the street: from its size Lucia thought at
      first that it was Susan's, but there was a man in livery
      sitting next the chauffeur, and at once she guessed. The
      car stopped at Mallards, and from behind her curtain Lucia
      could see that Elizabeth and another woman were inside. A
      podgy little hand was thrust out of the window, holding a
      card, which the man-servant thrust into the letter box. He
      rang the bell, but before it was answered he mounted again,
      and the car drove on. A hundred pages of
      stream-of-consciousness fiction could not have explained
      the situation more exhaustively to Lucia than her own flash
      of insight. Elizabeth had evidently told the novelist that
      it would be quite sufficient to leave a card on the Mayor
      and have done with her. What followed at the Parsonage that
      evening when Miss Leg dined with the Mapp-Flints bore out
      the accuracy of Lucia's intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very plain simple dinner, dear Miss Leg," said Elizabeth
      as they sat down. "Just pot luck, as I warned you, so I
      hope you've got a country appetite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I have, Liz," said Benjy heartily. "A round of golf
      makes me as hungry as I used to be after a day's tiger
      shooting in the jungle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are trophies of yours at Grebe, then," said Miss
      Leg. "I consider tiger-shooting a manly pursuit. That's
      what I mean by sport, taking your life in your hand instead
      of sitting in an arm chair and firing into flocks of
      hand-reared pheasants. That kind of 'sportsman' doesn't
      even load his own gun, I believe. Butchers and poulterers;
      that's what I called them in one of my books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Withering! scathing!" cried Elizabeth. "And how
      well-deserved! Benjy gave such a wonderful lecture here the
      other day about his hair-breath escapes. You could have
      heard a pin drop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's an old story now," said Benjy. "My
      <i>shikarri</i> days are over. And there's not a man in
      Tilling who's even seen a tiger except through the bars at
      the Zoo. Georgie Pillson, for instance--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom I presented to you at tea yesterday, Miss Leg," put
      in Elizabeth. "Husband of our dear Mayor. Pointed beard.
      Sketches quite prettily, and does exquisite needlework. My
      wicked Benjy once dubbed him Miss Milliner Michael-Angelo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that was very withering too," said Miss Leg, eating
      lumps of expensive middle-cut salmon with a country
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, not very kind, I'm afraid, but I like a man to
      be a man," said Benjy. "I'll take a bit more fish, Liz. A
      nice fresh-run fish. And what are you going to give us
      next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a brace of grouse," said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes. A few old friends with Scotch moors haven't quite
      forgotten me yet, Miss Leg. Dear old General!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Miss Milliner has gone away, Benjy," said Elizabeth.
      "Staying with Miss Olga Bracely. Probably you know her,
      Miss Leg. The prima donna. Such a fascinating woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone? Without his wife?" asked Miss Leg. "I do not
      approve of that. A wife's duty, Mayor or not, is to be
      always with her husband and vice versa. If she can't leave
      her home, she ought to insist on his stopping with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lucia is a little slack in these ways," said
      Elizabeth regretfully. "But she gives us to understand that
      they're all old friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The older the better," said Miss Leg epigrammatically, and
      they all laughed very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me more about your Lucia," she ordered, when their
      mirth subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't fancy you would find very much in common with
      her," said Elizabeth thoughtfully. "Rather prone we think,
      to plot and intrigue in a way we regret. And a little
      superior at times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to have gone to her head to be Mayor," put in
      Benjy. "She'd have made a sad mess of things without you to
      steady her, Liz."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do my best," sighed Elizabeth, "though it's uphill work
      sometimes. I am her Mayoress and a Councillor, Miss Leg,
      and she does need assistance and support. Oh, her dear,
      funny little ways! She's got a curious delusion that she
      can play the piano, and she gives us a treat sometimes, and
      one doesn't know which way to look. And not long ago--how
      you'll scream, Miss Leg, she told us all, several times
      over, that she was going to stay with the Duchess of
      Sheffield, and when she came back she showed us quantities
      of photographs of the Castle to prove she had been there--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to a Charity Concert of the Duchess's in her
      mansion in Grosvenor Square not long ago," said Miss Leg.
      "Five-guinea seats. Does she live near here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, many miles away. There's the cream of it. It turned
      out that Worship only went to tea. A three hours' drive
      each way to get a cup of tea! So odd. I almost suspect that
      she was never asked at all really; some mistake. And she
      always alludes to her as Poppy; whether she calls her that
      to her face is another question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidently a snob," said Miss Leg. "If there's one thing I
      hate it's snobbishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you mustn't call her a snob," cried Elizabeth. "I
      should be so vexed with myself if I had conveyed that
      impression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that a family house of her husband's where I left
      my card to-day?" asked Miss Leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what a tragic question!" she said. "No, they're quite
      <i>parvenus</i> in Tilling; that beautiful house--such a
      garden--belonged to my family. I couldn't afford to live
      there, and I had to sell it. Lucia gave me a pitiful price
      for it, but beggars can't be choosers. A cruel moment!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a shame," said Miss Leg. "All the old homes of
      England are going to upstarts and interlopers. I hope you
      never set foot in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a struggle to do so," said Elizabeth, "but I feel
      that both as Mayoress and as a friend of Lucia, I must be
      neighbourly. Neither officially nor socially must I fail to
      stand by her."
    </p>
    <p>
      They made plans for next day. Elizabeth was very sarcastic
      and amusing about the morning shopping of her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such fun!" she said. "Quite a feature of life here, you
      must not miss it. You'll see Diva bolting in and out of
      shops like a rabbit, Benjy says, when a ferret's after it,
      and Susan Wyse perhaps on a tricycle, and Lucia and quaint
      Irene Coles who painted the picture of the year, which is
      in our exhibition here; you must see that. Then we could
      pop in at the Town Hall, and I would show you our ancient
      charters and our wonderful Elizabethan plate. And would you
      honour us by signing your name in the Mayor's book for
      distinguished visitors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, very glad," said Miss Leg, "though I don't
      often give my autograph."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is kind. I would be ready for you at ten--not too
      early?--and take you round. Must you really be going?
      Benjy, see if Miss Leg's beautiful Daimler is here. Au
      reservoir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O what?" asked Miss Leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the dear folk here say 'au reservoir' instead of
      'au revoir'," explained Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they do that?" asked Miss Leg.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, as she dined alone, had been thinking over the
      hostilities which she felt were imminent. She was quite
      determined to annex Miss Leg with a view to being the
      central figure in her next best-seller, but Elizabeth was
      determined to annex her too, and Lucia was aware that she
      and her Mayoress could not run in harness over this job;
      the feat was impossible. Her pride forbade her to get hold
      of Miss Leg through Elizabeth, and Elizabeth, somehow or
      other, must be detached. She sat long that night meditating
      in the garden-room, and when next morning the Mayoress rang
      her up as usual at breakfast time, she went to the
      telephone ready for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear Worship," said that cooing voice. "What
      a beautiful day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely!" said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing I can do for you, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, thanks," said Lucia, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm taking Miss Leg--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Susan Leg: Rudolph da Vinci: my tenant," explained
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. She left a card on me yesterday, Foljambe told
      me. So kind. I hope she will enjoy her visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm taking her to the Town Hall this morning. So would you
      be a very sweet Worship and tell the Serjeant to get out
      the Corporation plate, which she would like to see. We
      shall be there by half-past ten, so if it is ready by a
      quarter past there'll be no delay. And though she seldom
      gives her autograph, she's promised to sign her name in
      Worship's book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a happy sigh. She had not dared to hope for such
      a rash move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, how very awkward," she said. "You see, the
      Corporation plate is always on view to the public on
      Tuesdays at three p.m.--or it may be two p.m.; you had
      better make certain--and it is such a business to get it
      out. One cannot do that for any casual visitor. And the
      privilege of signing the Mayor's book is reserved for
      really distinguished strangers, whose visit it is an honour
      to record. Olga, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dear Worship," said Elizabeth. "I've already promised
      to show her the plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing simpler. At two p.m. or three p.m., whichever it
      is, on Tuesday afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Mayor's book: I've asked her to sign it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Start a Mayoress's book, dear," she said. "You can get
      anybody you like to sign that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia remained a moment in thought after ringing off. Then
      she rang up the Town Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the Serjeant?" she said. "The Mayor speaking.
      Serjeant, do not get out the Corporation plate or produce
      my visitors' book without direct orders from me. At present
      I have given none. What a lovely morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave Mrs. Simpson a holiday, as there was nothing for
      her to do, and went down to the High Street for her
      marketing. Her mind resembled a modern army attended by an
      air force and all appliances. It was ready to scout and
      skirmish, to lay an ambush, to defend or to attack an enemy
      with explosives from its aircraft or poison gas (which
      would be only a reprisal, for she was certain it had been
      used against her). Diva was watching at her window,
      evidently waiting for her, and threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen her?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one "her" just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only her hand," said Lucia. "She put it out of her
      motor--a podgy sort of hand--yesterday afternoon. She left
      a card on me, or rather her footman popped it into my
      letterbox, without asking if I was in. Elizabeth was with
      her. They drove on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do call that rude," said Diva, warmly. "High and
      lofty, that's what she is. She told me her <i>chef</i>
      would send me a recipe for cream-wafers. I tried it. Muck.
      I gave one to Paddy, and he was sick. And she rang me up
      just now to go to tea with her this afternoon. Did she
      think I was going out to Grebe, just when I was busiest, to
      eat more muck? Not I. She dined at Elizabeth's last night,
      and Janet heard from Elizabeth's parlour-maid what they
      had. Tomato soup, middle-cut of Salmon sent over from
      Hornbridge, a brace of grouse from Rice's, Melba peaches,
      but only bottled with custard instead of cream, and tinned
      caviare. And Elizabeth called it pot-luck! I never had such
      luck there, pot or unpot. Elizabeth's meaning to run her,
      that's what it is. Let 'em run! I'll come out with you and
      do my shopping. Just see how Paddy is, but I think he's got
      rid of it. Cream-wafers, indeed! Wait a sec."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Lucia waited a sec., Susan's Wyse's Royce, with her
      husband and herself inside, hooted its ponderous way into
      the High Street. As it drew up at the fishmonger's, Lucia's
      eagle eye spied Elizabeth and a round, fat little woman, of
      whose identity there could be no doubt, walking towards it.
      Mr. Wyse had got out and Elizabeth clearly introduced him
      to her companion. He stood hatless, as was his polite habit
      when he talked to ladies under God's blue sky, or even in
      the rain, and then led her towards the open door of the
      Royce, where Elizabeth was chatting to Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia strolled towards them, but the moment Elizabeth saw
      her, she wheeled round without smile or greeting, and,
      detaching Miss Leg, moved away up the street to where Irene
      in her usual shorts and scarlet pullover, had just set up
      her easel at the edge of the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear Susan," called Lucia. "Oh, Mr. Wyse,
      pray put your hat on; such a hot sun. Who was that odd
      little woman with my Mayoress, who spoke to you just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think your Mayoress said Miss Leg," observed Mr. Wyse.
      "And she told my Susan that if she asked Miss Leg to dine
      to-night she would probably accept. Did you ask her, dear?
      If so, we must order more fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I didn't," said Susan. "Who is this Leg? Why
      should Elizabeth foist her friends on me? Most unheard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leg? Leg?" said Lucia vaguely. "Ah, of course. Elizabeth's
      tenant. The novelist. Does she not call herself Rudolph da
      Vinci?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very self-satisfied little woman, whatever she calls
      herself," said Susan with unusual severity, "and she's not
      going to dine with me. She can dine with Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva had trundled up and overheard this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did. Last night," she said. "All most sumptuous and
      grand. But fancy her leaving a card on Lucia without even
      asking whether she was at home! So rude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she indeed?" asked Mr. Wyse in a shocked voice. "We
      are not accustomed to such want of manners in Tilling. You
      were very right, Susan, not to ask her to dine. Your
      intuition served you well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it strange," said Lucia, "but I daresay she's a
      very decent, homely little woman, when left to herself.
      Elizabeth was with her, when she honoured me with her
      card."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That accounts for it," interrupted Diva and Susan
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and Elizabeth rang me up at breakfast and asked to give
      orders that the Corporation plate should be ready for her
      little friend's inspection this morning at 10.30. And the
      Mayor's book for her to sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I never!" said Diva. "And the church-bells ringing,
      I suppose. And the Town Band playing the Italian National
      Anthem for Rudolph da Vinci. What did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very polite regrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene's voice from a few yards away, loud and emphatic,
      broke in on their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mapp!" she cried. "I will not come to the Exhibition
      to show you and your friend--I didn't catch her name--my
      pictures. And I can't bear being looked over when I'm
      sketching. Trot along."
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed nothing else for them to do, and Lucia walked
      on to Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear?" asked Irene. "I sent Mapp and her friend
      about their business. Who is the little guy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Miss Leg, I am told," said Lucia. "She writes novels
      under some foreign name. Elizabeth's tenant: she seems to
      have taken her up with great warmth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor wretch. Mapp-kissed, like raisins. But the most
      exciting news, beloved. The directors of the Carlton
      Gallery in Bond Street have asked me if I will let them
      have my Venus for their autumn exhibition. Also an enquiry
      from an American collector, if it's for sale. I'm asking a
      thumping price for it. But I shall show it at the Carlton
      first, and I shall certainly put back Mapp's rouge and her
      cocotte smile. May I come up presently to Mallards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do dear. I have a little leisure this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia passed on with that ever-recurring sense of regret
      that Irene had not painted her on the oyster-shell and
      Georgie in the clouds, and, having finished her shopping,
      strolled home by the Town Hall. The Serjeant was standing
      on the steps, looking a little flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Mayoress and a friend have just been here, your
      Worship," he said. "She told me to get out the Corporation
      plate and your Worship's book. I said I couldn't without
      direct orders from you. She was a bit threatening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did quite right, Serjeant," said Lucia very
      graciously. "The same reply always, please."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Elizabeth and Miss Leg, having been thwarted at
      the Town Hall, passed on to the Exhibition where Elizabeth
      demanded free admittance for her as a distinguished
      visitor. But the door-keeper was as firm as the Serjeant
      had been, and Elizabeth produced a sixpence and six
      coppers. They went first to look at the Venus, and
      Elizabeth had a most disagreeable surprise, for the eminent
      novelist highly disapproved of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An irreverent parody of that great Italian picture by
      Botticello," she said. "And look at that old hag on the
      oyster shell and that boozy navvy in a top-hat. Most
      shocking! I am astonished that you allowed it to be
      exhibited. And by that rude unsexed girl in shorts? Her
      manners and her painting are on a par."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this pronouncement Elizabeth did not feel equal to
      disclosing that she was the hag and Benjy the navvy, but
      she was pleased that Miss Leg was so severe on the art of
      the rude girl in shorts, and took her to the portrait of
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's another picture of Miss Coles's," she said, "which
      is much worse that the other. Look: it reminds me of an
      auctioneer at a jumble sale. Bicycle, piano, old packs of
      cards, paint-box--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Leg burst into loud cries of pleasure and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A magnificent work!" she said. "That's something to look
      at. Glorious colour, wonderful composition. And what an
      interesting face. Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our Mayor: our dear Lucia whom we chatted about last
      night," said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your chat misled me. That woman has great character.
      Please ask her to meet me, and the artist too. She has real
      talent in spite of her other picture. I could dine with you
      this evening: just a plain little meal as we had last
      night. I never mind what I eat. Or tea. Tea would suit me
      as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Agitated thoughts darted through the Mayoress's mind. She
      was still desperately anxious to retain her proprietary
      rights over Miss Leg, but another plain little meal could
      not be managed. Moreover it could not be expected that even
      the most exalted Christian should forgive, to the extent of
      asking Lucia to dinner, her monstrous rudeness about the
      Corporation plate and the Mayor's book, and it would take a
      very good Christian to forgive Irene. Tea was as far as she
      could go, and there was always the hope that they would
      refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, Benjy and I are both engaged to-night," she said.
      "But I'll ask them to tea as soon as I get home."
    </p>
    <p>
      They strayed round the rest of the gallery: the misty
      morning on the marsh, Elizabeth thought, looked very full
      of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The usual little local daubs," observed Miss Leg, walking
      by it without a glance. "But the hollyhocks are charming,
      and so are the dahlias. By Miss Coles, too, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth simply could not bear that she should know who
      the artist was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does exquisite flower-studies," she said.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was in the garden-room with Lucia when Elizabeth's
      call came through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just been to the Exhibition, dear Worship, with Miss Leg.
      She's so anxious to know you and quaint Irene. Would you
      pop in for a cup of tea this afternoon? She will be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So kind!" said Lucia. "I must consult my engagement book."
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered the receiver with her hand, and thought
      intensely for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Irene," she whispered. "Elizabeth asks us both to go to
      tea with her and meet Miss Leg. I think I won't. I don't
      want to get at her <i>via</i> Elizabeth. What about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to get at Leg <i>via</i> anybody" said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia uncovered the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" she said. "As I feared I am engaged. And Irene is
      with me and regrets she can't come either. Such a pity.
      Goodbye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why my regrets?" asked Irene. "And what's it all about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed. "All very tiresome," she said, "but Elizabeth
      forces me, in mere self-defence, to descend to little
      schemings and intrigues. How it bores me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, it's the breath of your life!" said Irene, "and
      you do it so beautifully!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of that day and the next Miss Leg found that
      she was not penetrating far into the life of Tilling. She
      attended shopping parade next morning by herself. Diva and
      the Wyses were talking together, but gave her no more than
      cold polite smiles, and when she had passed, Irene joined
      them and there was laughter. Further on Lucia, whom she
      recognised from Irene's portrait was walking with a tall
      man with a Vandyck beard, whom she guessed to be the truant
      husband returned. Elizabeth was approaching, all smiles;
      surely they would have a few words together, and she would
      introduce them, but Lucia and the tall man instantly
      crossed the road. It was all very odd: Lucia and Irene
      would not come to tea at the Mapp-Flints, and the Wyses had
      not asked her to dinner, and Diva had refused to go to tea
      at Grebe, and Elizabeth had not produced the Corporation
      plate and the Mayor's book. She began to wonder whether the
      Mapp-Flints were not some species of pariah whom nobody
      would know. This was a dreadful thought; perhaps she had
      got into wrong hands, and, while they clutched her, Tilling
      held aloof. She remembered quite a large percentage of
      Elizabeth's disparaging remarks about Lucia at the plain
      little meal, and of Benjy's comments on Georgie, and now
      they assumed a different aspect. Were they prompted by
      malice and jealousy and impotence to climb into Tilling
      society? "I've not got any copy at present," thought Miss
      Leg. "I must do something. Perhaps Mrs. Mapp-Flint has had
      a past, though it doesn't look likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very hot day, and Georgie and Lucia settled to go
      bicycling after tea. The garden-room, till then, was the
      coolest place and after lunch they played the piano and sat
      in the window overlooking the street. He had had two lovely
      days at Riseholme, and enlarged on them with more
      enthusiasm than tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Olga was too wonderful," he said. "Singing divinely and
      inspiring everybody. She enjoys herself simply by giving
      enjoyment to other people. A concert both evenings at
      seven, with the Spanish quartette and a few songs by Olga.
      Just an hour and a half and then a delicious supper in the
      garden, with everybody in Riseholme asked, and no Duchesses
      and things at all. Just for Riseholme: that's so like her:
      she doesn't know what the word 'snob' means. And I had the
      room I had before, with a bathroom next door, and my
      breakfast on the balcony. And none of those plots and
      intrigues we used to be always embroiled in. It <i>was</i>
      a change."
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain stoniness had come into Lucia's face, which
      Georgie, fired with his subject, did not perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she asked down a lot of the supers from Covent
      Garden," he went on, "and put them up at the Ambermere
      Arms. And her kindness to all her old friends: dull old me,
      for instance. She's taken a villa at Le Touquet now, and
      she's asked me there for a week." I shall cross from
      Seaport, and there are some wonderful anti-sick tablets--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did dearest Olga happen to mention if she was expecting me
      as well?" asked Lucia in a perfectly calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie descended, like an aeroplane with engine-trouble,
      from these sunlit spaces. He made a bumpy landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't remember her doing so," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a thing you would be likely to forget," said Lucia.
      "Your wonderful memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay she doesn't want to bother you with
      invitations," said Georgie artfully. "You see, you did rub
      it in a good deal how difficult it was for you to get away,
      and how you had to bring tin boxes full of municipal papers
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely that is it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you promised to spend Saturday till Monday with her a
      few weeks ago," continued Georgie, "and then left on Sunday
      because of your Council meeting, and then you couldn't
      leave Tilling the other day because of Miss Leg. Olga's
      beginning to realize, don't you think, how busy you
      are--What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had sprung to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leg's motor coming up the street," she said. "Georgie,
      stand at the door, and, if I waggle my thumb at you, fly
      into the house and tell Grosvenor I'm at home. If I turn it
      down--those Roman gladiators--still fly, but tell her I'm
      out. It all depends on whether Elizabeth is with her. I'll
      explain afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia slid behind the window-curtain, and Georgie stood at
      the door, ready to fly. There came a violent waggling of
      his wife's thumb, and he sped into the house. He came
      flying back again, and Lucia motioned him to the piano, on
      the music-stand of which she had already placed a familiar
      Mozart duet, "Quick! Top of the page," she said. "<i>Uno,
      due, tre.</i> Pom. Perfect!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They played half a dozen brilliant bars, and Grosvenor
      opened the door and said, "Miss Leg". Lucia took no notice
      but continued playing, till Grosvenor said "Miss Leg!" much
      louder, and then, with a musical exclamation of surprise,
      she turned and rose from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Miss Leg, so pleased!" she said, drawling frightfully.
      "How-de-do? Have you met Miss Leg, Georgie? Ah, yes, I
      think you saw her at Diva's one afternoon. Georgie, tell
      somebody that Miss Leg--you will, won't you--will stop to
      tea . . . My little garden-room, which you may have noticed
      from outside. I'm told that they call it the Star
      Chamber--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Leg looked up at the ceiling, as if expecting to see
      the hosts of heaven depicted there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed. Why do they call it that?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had, of course, just invented that name for the
      garden-room herself. She waved her hand at the pile of
      Departmental tin boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secrets of municipal business," she said lightly. "The
      Cabal, you know: Arlington, Bolingbroke . . . Shall we go
      out into the garden, until tea is ready? A tiny little
      plot, but so dear to me, the red brick walls, the modest
      little house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bought it quite lately from Mrs. Mapp-Flint, I
      understand," said Miss Leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clever Lucia at once guessed that Elizabeth had given her
      version of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, poor thing," she said. "I was so glad to be able to
      get her out of her difficulties. It used to belong to an
      aunt of hers by marriage. What a state it was in! The
      garden a jungle of weeds, but I am reclaiming it. And
      here's my little secret garden: when I am here and the door
      is shut, I am not to be disturbed by anybody. Busy folk,
      like you and me, you with your marvellous creative work,
      and me with my life so full of interruptions, must have
      some inviolable sanctuary, must we not? . . . Some rather
      fine hollyhocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming!" said Miss Leg, who was disposed to hate Lucia
      with her loftiness and her Star Chamber, but still thought
      she might be the Key to Tilling. "I have a veritable grove
      of them at my little cottage in the country. There was a
      beautiful study of hollyhocks at your little exhibition. By
      Miss Coles, I think Mrs. Mapp-Flint said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my sweet, muddle-headed Mayoress!" she cried.
      "Georgie, did you hear? Elizabeth told Miss Leg that my
      picture of hollyhocks was by Irene. So like her. Tea
      ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmony ripened. Miss Leg expressed her great admiration
      for Irene's portrait of Lucia, and her withering scorn for
      the Venus, and promised to pay another visit to study the
      features of the two principal figures: she had been so
      disgusted with the picture that one glance was enough.
      Before she had eaten her second bun, Lucia had rung up the
      Serjeant at the Town Hall, and asked him to get out the
      Corporation plate and the Mayor's book, for she would be
      bringing round a distinguished visitor very shortly: and
      before Miss Leg had admired the plate and signed the book
      ("Susan Leg" and below, "Rudolph da Vinci"), she had
      engaged herself to dine at Mallards next day. "Just a few
      friends," said Lucia, "who would be so much honoured to
      meet you." She did not ask Elizabeth and Benjy, for Miss
      Leg had seen so much of them lately, but, for fear they
      should feel neglected, she begged them to come in
      afterwards for a cup of coffee and a chat. Elizabeth
      interpreted this as an insult rather than an invitation,
      and she and Benjy had coffee and a vivacious chat by
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was very gay, and a quantity of little anecdotes
      were told about the absentees. At the end of most of them
      Lucia cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you mustn't be so ill-natured about them," and
      sometimes she told another. It was close on midnight when
      the gathering broke up, and they were all bidden to dine
      with Miss Leg the next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a pleasant evening, may I say 'Lucia?'" said she on
      the doorstep, as she put up her round red face for the
      Mayor to deal with as she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed do, dear Susan," she said. "But I think you must be
      Susanna. Will you? We have one dear Susan already."
    </p>
    <p>
      They kissed.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie continued to be tactless about Olga's manifold
      perfections, and though his chaste passion for her did not
      cause Lucia the smallest anxiety (she knew Georgie too well
      for that) she wondered what Tilling would make of his
      coming visit to Le Touquet without her. Her native
      effrontery had lived the Poppy-crisis down, but her rescue
      of Susan Leg, like some mature Andromeda, from the clutches
      of her Mayoress, had raised the deepest animosity of the
      Mapp-Flints, and she was well aware that Elizabeth would
      embrace every opportunity to be nasty. She was therefore
      prepared for trouble, but, luckily for her peace of mind,
      she had no notion what a tempest of tribulation was
      gathering . . . Georgie and Foljambe left by a very early
      train for Seaport so that he might secure a good position
      amidships on the boat, for the motion was felt less there,
      before the continental express from London arrived, and
      each of them had a tube of <i>cachets</i> preventive of
      sea-sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth popped into Diva's for a chat that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've gone," she said. "I've just met Worship. She was
      looking very much worried, poor thing, and I'm sure I don't
      wonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva had left off her eyebrows. They took too long, and she
      was tired of always looking surprised when, as on this
      occasion, she was not surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you mean about Mr. Georgie going off alone," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among other worries. Benjy and I both grieve for her. Mr.
      Georgie's infatuation is evidently increasing. First of all
      there was that night here--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: Lucia came back," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never quite cleared up, I think. And then he's been
      staying at Riseholme without her, unless you're going to
      tell me that Worship went over every evening and returned
      at cock-crow for her duties here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Olga asked them both, anyhow," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we've been told, but did she? And this time Lucia's
      certainly not been asked. It's mounting up, and it must be
      terrible for her. All that we feared at first is coming
      true, as I knew it would. And I don't believe for a moment
      that he'll come back at the end of a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be humiliating," said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far be it from me to insinuate that there's anything
      wrong," continued Elizabeth emphatically, "but if I was
      Lucia I shouldn't like it, any more than I should like it
      if you and Benjy went for a week and perhaps more to Le
      Touquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shouldn't like it either," said Diva. "But I'm sorry
      for Lucia, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daresay she'll need our sympathy before long," said
      Elizabeth darkly. "And how truly grateful I am to her for
      taking that Leg woman off my hands. Such an incubus. How
      she managed it I don't enquire. She may have poisoned Leg's
      mind about me, but I should prefer to be poisoned than see
      much more of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you're getting mixed, Elizabeth," protested Diva. "It
      was Leg's mind you suggested was poisoned, not you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a quibble, dear," said Elizabeth decidedly. "You'll
      hardly deny that Benjy and I were most civil to the woman.
      I even asked Lucia and Irene to meet her, which was going a
      long way considering Lucia's conduct about the Corporation
      plate and the Mayor's book. But I couldn't have stood Leg
      much longer, and I should have had to drop her . . . I must
      be off; so busy to-day, like Worship. A Council meeting
      this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia always enjoyed her Council meetings. She liked
      presiding, she liked being suave and gracious and deeply
      conscious of her own directing will. As she took her seat
      to-day, she glanced at the wall behind her, where before
      long Irene's portrait of her would be hanging. Minutes of
      the previous meeting were read, reports from various
      committees were received, discussed and adopted. The last
      of these was that of the Committee which had been appointed
      to make its recommendation to the Council about her
      portrait. She had thought over a well-turned sentence or
      two: she would say what a privilege it was to make this
      work of genius the permanent possession of the Borough.
      Miss Coles, she need hardly remind the Council was a
      Tillingite of whom they were all proud, and the painter
      also of the Picture of the Year, in which there figured two
      of Tilling's most prominent citizens, one being a highly
      honoured member of the Council. ("And then I shall bow to
      Elizabeth," thought Lucia, "she will appreciate that.")
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the agenda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now we come to our last business, ladies and
      gentlemen," she said. "To receive the report of the
      Committee on the Mayor's offer of a portrait of herself to
      the Council, to be hung in the Town Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As Chairman of this Committee," she said, "it is my duty
      to say that we came to the unanimous conclusion that we
      cannot recommend the Council to accept the Mayor's most
      generous gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gracious sovereignty of Lucia's demeanour did not
      suffer the smallest diminution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those in favour of accepting the findings of the
      Committee?" she asked. "Unanimous, I think."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Never, in all Lucia's triumphant career, had she suffered
      so serious a reverse, nor one out of which it seemed more
      impossible to reap some incidental advantage. She had been
      dismissed from Sheffield Castle at the shortest notice, but
      she had got a harvest of photographs. Out of her inability
      to find the brake on her bicycle, thus madly scorching
      through a crowded street, she had built herself a monument
      for dash and high athletic prowess. She always discovered
      silver linings to the blackest of clouds, but now,
      scrutinize them as she might, she could detect in them none
      but the most sombre hues. Her imagination had worked out a
      dazzling future for this portrait. It would hang on the
      wall behind her; the Corporation, at her request, would
      lend it (heavily insured) to the Royal Academy exhibition
      next May, where it would be universally acclaimed as a
      masterpiece far outshining the Venus of the year before. It
      would be lithographed or mezzotinted, and she would sign
      the first fifty pulls. Visitors would flock to the Town
      Hall to see it; they would recognise her as she flashed by
      them on her bicycle or sat sketching at some picturesque
      corner; admiring the mellow front of Mallards, the
      ancestral home of the Mayor, they would be thrilled to know
      that the pianist, whose exquisite strains floated out of
      the open window of the garden-room, was the woman whose
      portrait they just seen above her official chair. Such
      thoughts as these were not rigidly defined but floated like
      cloud-castles in the sky, forming and shifting and always
      elegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now of those fairy edifices there was nothing left. The
      Venus was to be exhibited at the Carlton Gallery and then
      perhaps to form a gem in the collection of some American
      millionaire, and Elizabeth would go out into all lands and
      Benjy to the ends of the earth, while her own rejected
      portrait would be returned to Mallards, with the best
      thanks of the Committee, like Georgie's sunny morning on
      the marsh, and Susan's budgerigar, and Diva's sardine
      tartlet. (And where on earth should she hang this perpetual
      reminder of defeated dreams?) . . . Another aspect of this
      collapse struck her. She had always thought of herself as
      the beneficent director of municipal action, but now the
      rest of her Council had expressed unanimous agreement with
      the report of a small malignant Committee, instead of
      indignantly rallying round her and expressing their
      contempt of such base ingratitude. This was a snub to which
      she saw no possible rejoinder except immediate resignation
      of her office, but that would imply that she felt the snub,
      which was not to be thought of. Besides, if her resignation
      was accepted, there would be nothing left at all.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Her pensive steps, after the Council meeting was over, had
      brought her to the garden-room, and the bright japanned
      faces of tin-boxes labelled "Museum", "Fire Brigade" or
      "Burial Board" gave her no comfort: their empty expressions
      seemed to mock her. Had Georgie been here, she could have
      confided the tragedy to him without loss of dignity. He
      would have been sympathetic in the right sort of way: he
      would have said "My dear, how tar'some! That foul
      Elizabeth: of course she was at the bottom of it. Let's
      think of some plan to serve her out." But without that
      encouragement she was too flattened out to think of
      Elizabeth at all. The only thing she could do was to
      maintain, once more, her habitual air of prosperous
      self-sufficiency. She shuddered at the thought of Tilling
      being sorry for her, because, communing with herself, she
      seemed to sense below this superficial pity, some secret
      satisfaction that she had had a knock. Irene, no doubt,
      would be wholly sincere, but though her prestige as an
      artist had suffered indignity, what difference would it
      make to her that the Town Council of Tilling had rejected
      her picture, when the Carlton Gallery in London had craved
      the loan of her Venus, and an American millionaire was
      nibbling for its purchase? Irene would treat it as a huge
      joke; perhaps she would design a Christmas card showing
      Mapp, as a nude, mature, female Cupid, transfixing Benjy's
      heart with a riding-whip. For a moment, as this pleasing
      fantasy tickled Lucia's brain, she smiled wanly. But the
      smile faded again: not the grossest insult to Elizabeth
      would mend matters. A head held high and a total
      unconsciousness that anything disagreeable had happened was
      the only course worthy of the Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council meeting had been short, for no reports from
      Committees (especially the last) had raised controversy,
      and Lucia stepped briskly down the hill to have tea in
      public at Diva's, and exhibit herself as being in cheerful
      or even exuberant spirits. Just opposite the door was drawn
      up a monstrous motor, behind which was strapped a
      dress-basket and other substantial luggage with the
      initials P.S. on them. "A big postscript," thought Lucia,
      lightening her heavy heart with humorous fancies, and she
      skirted round behind this ponderous conveyance, and so on
      to the pavement. Two women were just stepping out of ye
      olde tea-shop: one was Elizabeth dripping with unctuous
      smiles, and the other was Poppy Sheffield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here's sweet Worship herself," said Elizabeth. "Just
      in time to see you. How fortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some deadly misgiving stirred in Lucia's heart as Poppy
      turned on her a look of blank unrecognition. But she
      managed to emit a thin cry of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Duchess!" she said. "How naughty of you to come to my
      little Tilling without letting me know. It was <i>au
      revoir</i> when we parted last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppy still seemed puzzled, and then (unfortunately,
      perhaps) she began to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course!" she said. "You came to see me at the
      Castle, owing to some stupid misunderstanding. My
      abominable memory. Do tell me your name.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia Pillson," said the wretched woman. "Mayor of
      Tilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, how it all comes back," said Poppy, warmly shaking
      hands. "That was it. I thought your husband was the Mayor
      of Tilling, and I was expecting him. Quite. So stupid of
      me. And then tea and photographs, wasn't it? I trust they
      came out well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautifully. Do come up to my house--only a step--and I'll
      show you them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! not a moment to spare. I've spent such a long time
      chatting to all your friends. Somebody--somebody called
      Leg, I think--introduced them to me. She said she had been
      to my house in London which I daresay was quite true. One
      never can tell. But I'm catching, at least I hope so, the
      evening boat at Seaport on my way to stay with Olga Bracely
      at Le Touquet. Such a pleasure to have met you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia presented a brave front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then do come and dine and sleep here to break your journey
      on your return," she said. "I shall expect you to propose
      yourself at any time, like all my friends. Just a wire or a
      telephone call. Georgie and I are sure to be here.
      Impossible for me to get away in these crowded months--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That <i>would</i> be nice," said Poppy. "Good-bye: Mrs.
      Pillson, isn't it? Quite. Charmed, I'm sure: so pleasant.
      Drive straight on to the quay at Seaport," she called to
      her chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia kissed her hand after the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lucky just to have caught her for a moment," she
      drawled to Elizabeth, as they went back into ye olde
      tea-house. "Naughty of her not to have let me know. How
      dreadfully bad her memory is becoming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shocking," said Elizabeth. "You should persuade her to see
      somebody about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia turned on the full horse-power of her courage for the
      coming encounter in ye olde tea-house. The moment she saw
      the faces of her friends assembled there, Evie and Leg and
      Diva, she knew she would need it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've just missed an old friend, Lucia," said Susanna.
      (Was there in her words a touch of the irony for which
      Rudolph da Vinci was celebrated?)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too unfortunate, dear Susanna," said Lucia. "But I just
      got a word with her. Off to stay at Le Touquet, she said.
      Ah! I never told her she would find Georgie there. My
      memory is getting as bad as hers. Diva, may I have a one
      and sixpenny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva usually went down to the kitchen to see to the serving
      of a one and sixpenny, but she only called the order down
      the stairs to Janet. And her face lacked its usual
      cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've missed such a nice chat," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence pregnant with trouble. It was
      impossible, thought Lucia, that her name should not have
      figured in the nice chat, or that Poppy should not have
      exhibited that distressing ignorance about her which had
      been so evident outside. In any case Elizabeth would soon
      promulgate the news with the addition of that hideous
      detail, as yet undiscovered, that she had been asked to
      Sheffield Castle only because Poppy thought that Georgie
      was Mayor of Tilling. Brave cheerfulness was the only
      possible demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too unfortunate," she repeated, "and I could have been
      here half an hour ago, for we had quite a short Council
      meeting. Nothing controversial: all went so smoothly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of that uncontroversial rejection of her
      portrait brought her up short. Then the sight of
      Elizabeth's wistful, softly smiling face lashed her forward
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you will laugh, Susanna," she said brightly, "when I
      tell you that the Council unanimously refused to accept my
      gift of the portrait Irene painted of me which you admired
      so much. A small Committee advised them against it. And
      <i>ecco!''</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Susanna's laugh lacked the quality of scorn and contempt
      for the Council, for which Lucia had hoped. It sounded
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that was a pity," she said. "They just didn't like
      it. But you can't get people to like what they don't like
      by telling them that they ought to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The base desertion was a shock. Lucia looked without favour
      at the sumptuous one and sixpenny Janet had brought her,
      but her voice remained calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I was wrong to have offered it them at all," she
      said. "I ought to have known that they could not understand
      it. What fun Irene and I will have over it when I tell her.
      I can hear her scream 'Philistines! Vandals!' and burst
      into shrieks of laughter. And what a joy to have it back at
      Mallards again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth continued to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No place like home is there, dear?" she said. "Where will
      you hang it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave up the idea of eating her sardine-tartlet. She
      had intended to stay on, until Susanna and Elizabeth left,
      and find out from Diva what had been said about her before
      she came in. She tried a few light topics of general
      interest, evoking only short replies of paralyzing
      politeness. This atmosphere of veiled hostility was
      undermining her. She knew that if she went away first,
      Elizabeth would pour out all that Poppy had let slip on the
      doorstep, but perhaps the sooner that was known the better.
      After drinking her tea and scalding her mouth she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be off," she said. "See you again very soon,
      Susanna. One and sixpence, Diva? Such a lovely tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth continued smiling till the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such odd things happened outside," she said. Her Poppy
      didn't recognise her. She asked her who she was. And
      Worship wasn't invited to Sheffield Castle at all. Poppy
      thought that Mr. Georgie was the Mayor, and the invitation
      was for him. That was why Worship came back so soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious, what a crash!" said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It always comes in time," said Elizabeth thoughtfully.
      "Poor thing, we must be very gentle with her, but what a
      lot of things we must avoid talking about!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She enumerated them on her plump fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duchesses, Castles, photographs--I wonder if they were
      picture postcards--prima-donnas, for I'm sure she'd have
      gone to Le Touquet, if she had been asked--portraits--it
      was my duty to recommend the Council not to accept that
      daub--gad-about husbands--I havn't got enough fingers. Such
      a lot of subjects that would tear old wounds open, and
      she's brought it all on herself, which makes it so much
      more bitter for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva, who hated waste (and nothing would keep in this hot
      weather) ate Lucia's sardine-tartlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't gloat, Elizabeth!" she commanded. "You may say
      sympathetic things, but there's a nasty tone in the way you
      say them. I'm really rather sorry for her.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is just what I have been trying to express,"
      retorted Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you haven't expressed it well. Not that impression at
      all. Goodness, here's a fresh party coming in. Janet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia passed by the fishmonger's, and some stir of
      subconscious cerebration prompted her to order a dressed
      crab that she saw in the window. Then she went home and out
      into the garden-room. This second blow falling so fast on
      the heels of the first, caused her to reel. To all the
      dismal reflections occasioned by the rejection of her
      portrait there were added those appropriate to the second,
      and the composite mental picture presented by the two was
      appalling. Surely some malignant Power, specially dedicated
      to the service of her discomfiture, must have ordained the
      mishaps (and their accurate timing) of this staggering
      afternoon: the malignant Power was a master of stage-craft.
      Who could stand up against a relentless tragedian? Lucia
      could not, and two tears of self-pity rolled down her
      cheeks. She was much surprised to feel their tickling
      progress, for she had always thought herself incapable of
      such weakness, but there they were. The larger one fell on
      to her blotting-pad, and she dashed the smaller aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled herself together. Whatever humiliations were
      heaped on her, her resolve to continue sprightly and
      dominant and unsubdued was as firm as ever, and she must
      swallow pity or contempt without apparently tasting them.
      She went to her piano, and through a slightly blurred
      vision had a good practice at the difficult treble part of
      the duet Georgie and she had run through before his
      departure. She did a few bracing physical exercises, and a
      little deep breathing. "I have lost a great deal of
      prestige," she said to herself as she held her breath and
      puffed it out again, "but that shall not upset me. I shall
      recover it all. In a fortnight's time, if not less, I shall
      be unable to believe that I could ever have felt so abject
      and have behaved so weakly. <i>Sursum corda!</i> I shall--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her telephone-bell rang. It required a strong call on her
      courage to answer it, for who could tell what fresh
      calamity might not be sprung on her? When she heard the
      name of the speaker, she nearly rang off, for it seemed so
      impossible. Probably some infamous joke was being played on
      her. But she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just missed my boat," said the voice, "and sleeping
      in a hotel makes me ill for a week. Would you be
      wonderfully kind and let me dine and sleep? You were so
      good as to suggest that this afternoon. Then I can catch
      the early boat to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sob of joy rose in Lucia's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted, Duchess," she answered. "So glad you took me at
      my word and proposed yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks. I shall be with you in an hour or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia skipped to the bell, and kept her finger on it till
      Grosvenor came running out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grosvenor, the Duchess of Sheffield will be here in about
      an hour to dine and sleep," cried Lucia, still ringing.
      "What is there for dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't say, except for a dressed crab that's just come
      in--" began Grosvenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I ordered it," cried Lucia excitedly, ceasing to
      ring. "It was instinctive, Grosvenor, it was a leading.
      Things like that often happen to me. See what else, and
      plenty of strong coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor went into the house, and the music of triumphant
      meditations poured through Lucia's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I ask Benjy and Elizabeth?" she thought. "That would
      crush Elizabeth for ever, but I don't really wish her such
      a fate. Diva? No. A good little thing, but it might seem
      odd to Poppy to meet at dinner a woman to whom she had paid
      a shilling for her tea, or perhaps eighteen-pence. Susanna
      Leg? No: she was not at all kind about the picture. Shall I
      send for the Mayor's book and get Poppy to write in it?
      Again, no. It would look as if I wanted to record her visit
      officially, whereas she only just drops in. We will be
      alone, I think. Far more <i>chic."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor returned with the modest menu, and Lucia added a
      savoury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shan't dress, Grosvenor," she said. "Her Grace (rich
      words!) will be leaving very early, and she won't want to
      unpack, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Grace arrived. She seemed surprised not to find Georgie
      there, but was pleased to know that he was staying with
      Olga at Le Touquet. She went to bed very soon after dinner,
      and left at eight next morning. Never had Lucia waited so
      impatiently for the shopping hour, when casually,
      drawlingly she would diffuse the news.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The first person she met was Elizabeth herself, who hurried
      across the street with an odious smile of kindly pity on
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So lonely for you, Worship, all by yourself without Mr.
      Georgie," she said. "Pop in and dine with us to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia could have sung aloud to think how soon that kindly
      pity would be struck from the Mayoress's face. She pressed
      a finger to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me think," she said. "I'm afraid . . . No, that's
      tomorrow . . . Yes, I am free. Charmed." She paused,
      prolonging the anticipation of the wonderful disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I had such a queer little surprise last night," she
      drawled. "I went home after tea at Diva's,--of course you
      were there--and played my piano a while. Then the eternal
      telephone rang. Who do you think it was who wanted to dine
      and sleep at such short notice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth curbed her longing to say "Duchess Poppy," but
      that would have been too unkind and sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, dear," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess," said Lucia. "I begged her, do you remember,
      when we three met for a minute yesterday, just to propose
      herself . . . And an hour afterwards, she did. Dear vague
      thing! She missed her boat and can't bear hotels and
      telephoned. A pleasant quiet evening. She went off again
      very early to-day, to catch the morning boat. I wonder if
      she'll succeed this time. Eight o'clock this evening then?
      I shall look forward to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia went into a shop, leaving Elizabeth speechless on the
      pavement, with her mouth wide open. Then she closed it, and
      it assumed its grimmest aspect. She began to cross the
      street, but leaped back to the pavement again on the
      violent hooting, almost in her ear, of Susan's Royce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry if it made you jump," said Susan, putting her
      face out of the window, "but I hear that Lucia's Duchess
      was here yesterday and didn't know her from Adam. Or Eve.
      Either of them. Can it be true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was there," said Elizabeth. "She hadn't the slightest
      idea who Worship was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's odd, considering all those photographs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These's something odder yet," said Elizabeth. "Worship has
      just told me she had a visitor to dine and sleep, who left
      very early this morning. Guess who that was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never can guess, as you know," said Susan. "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She!" cried Elizabeth shrilly. "And Lucia had the face to
      tell me so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyse, concealed behind the immense bulk of his wife,
      popped his head round the corner of her shoulder. The
      Mayoress's savage countenance so terrified him that he
      popped it back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How Worship's conscience will let her tell such whoppers,
      is her concern and not mine, thank God," continued the
      Mayoress. "What I deplore is that she should think me
      idiotic enough to believe them. Does one woman ask another
      woman, whom she doesn't know by sight, to let her dine and
      sleep? <i>Does</i> she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wyse always refused to be drawn into social crises.
      "Drive on," he said in a low voice down the speaking-tube,
      and the car hooted and moved away. Elizabeth screamed
      "<i>Does</i> she," after it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news spread fast, and there was only one verdict on it.
      Obviously Lucia had invented the story to counter the
      mortification of being unrecognised by Poppy the day
      before. "So silly," said Diva, when Elizabeth plunged into
      the tea-house and told her. "Much better to have lived it
      down. We've all got to live things down sometimes. She's
      only made it much harder for herself. What's the good of
      telling lies which nobody can believe? When you and I tell
      lies, Elizabeth, it's in the hope anyhow--What is it
      Janet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please ma'am, Grosvenor's just told me there was a visitor
      at Mallards last night, and who do you think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I've heard," said Diva. "I'll be down in the kitchen
      in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And making poor Grosvenor her accomplice," said Elizabeth.
      "Come and dine to-night, Diva. I've asked Worship, and you
      must help Benjy and me to get through the evening. You must
      help us to keep her off the subject, or I shall lose my
      self-control and forget that I'm a lady and tell her she's
      a liar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia spent a wonderfully happy day. She came straight home
      after telling Elizabeth her news, for it was far more lofty
      not to spread it herself and give the impression that she
      was gratified, and devoted herself to her music and her
      reading, as there was no municipal business to occupy her.
      Long before evening everyone would know, and she would
      merely make casual allusions at dinner to her visitor, and
      inflame their curiosity. She went out wearing her
      seed-pearls in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear host and hostess," she said as she swept in. "So
      sweet of you to take compassion on my loneliness. No, Major
      Benjy, no sherry thanks, though I really deserve some after
      my long day. Breakfast at half-past seven--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy! That was early!" interrupted Elizabeth. Diva
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry," she said. "A bit late. Fearfully busy
      afternoon. Worn out. Yes, Major Benjy: just half a glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just saying that I had had a long day, too," said
      Lucia. "My guest was off at eight to catch the early boat
      at Seaport--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a good service," put in Benjy. "Liz and I went by
      that route on our honeymoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--and would get to Le Touquet in time for lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dinner, dinner," said Benjy, and in they went.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not seen Susan Leg to-day," remarked Diva. "She
      usually drops in to tea now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been writing hard," said Elizabeth. "I popped in for
      a minute. She's got some material <i>now,</i> she told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      This dark saying had a bright lining for Lucia. Her
      optimistic mind concluded that Susanna knew about her
      visitor, and she laughed gaily as dressed crab was handed
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a coincidence," she said. "Last night I had ordered
      dressed crab before--dear Elizabeth, I never get tired of
      it--before I was rung up from Seaport. Was not that lucky?
      Her favourite food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how many teas did you say you served to-day, Diva?"
      asked Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't tell you yet. Janet hadn't finished counting up.
      People still in the garden when I left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard from Georgie to-day," said Lucia. "He'll be back
      from Le Touquet on Saturday. The house was quite full
      already, he said, and he didn't know where Olga would put
      another guest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such lovely September weather," said Elizabeth. "So good
      for the crops."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was faintly puzzled. They had all been so eager to
      hear about her visit to Sheffield Castle, and now whenever
      she brought up kindred topics, Elizabeth or Diva changed
      the subject with peculiar abruptness. Very likely Elizabeth
      was a little jealous, a little resentful that Lucia had not
      asked her to dine last night. But she could explain that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was too late, alas," she said, "to get up a small
      party," she said, "as I should have so much liked to do.
      Simply no time. We didn't even dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a short visit," she said, "and breakfast at half-past
      seven. Fancy! Let us have a rubber, as we needn't get up so
      early to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia walked home in the bright moonlight, making
      benevolent plans. If Poppy broke her return journey by
      staying a night here she must certainly have a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      She vaguely regretted not having done so last night: it
      would have given pleasure, and she ought to welcome all
      opportunities of making treats for her friends . . . They
      were touchy folk; to-night they had been harsh with each
      other over Bridge, but to her they had been scrupulously
      polite, receiving all her criticisms of their play in meek
      silence. Perhaps they were beginning to perceive at last
      that she was a different class of player from them. As she
      caressed this vainglorious thought, she stopped to admire
      the chaste whiteness of the moonlight on the church-tower,
      which seemed to point skywards as if towards her own serene
      superiority among the stars. Then quite suddenly a violent
      earthquake happened in her mind, and it collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't believe that Poppy ever stayed with me at all,"
      she moaned. "They think I invented it. Infamous!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For the whole of the next day no burgess of Tilling, except
      Mrs. Simpson and the domestic staff, set eyes on the Mayor.
      By a strong effort of will Lucia took up her market-basket
      after breakfast with the intention of shopping, but looking
      out from the window of her hall, she saw Elizabeth on the
      pavement opposite, sketching the front of the ancestral
      house of her aunt by marriage. She could not face Elizabeth
      yet, for that awful mental earthquake in the churchyard
      last night had shattered her nerve. The Mayor was a
      self-ordained prisoner in her own house, as Popes had been
      at the Vatican.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put down her basket and went back into the garden-room.
      She must show Elizabeth though not by direct encounter,
      that she was happy and brilliant and busy. She went to her
      piano and began practising scales. Arpeggios and roulades
      of the most dazzling kind followed. Slightly exhausted by
      this fine display she crept behind the curtain and peered
      out. Elizabeth was still there, and, in order to continue
      the impression of strenuous artistic activity, Lucia put on
      a gramophone record of the Moonlight Sonata. At the
      conclusion of that she looked out again; Elizabeth had
      gone. It was something to have driven that baleful presence
      away from the immediate neighbourhood, but it had only
      taken its balefulness elsewhere. She remembered how Susanna
      had said with regard to the rejected portrait (which no
      longer seemed to matter an atom) "You can't get people to
      like what they don't like by telling them that they ought
      to"; and now a parallel aphorism suggested itself to
      Lucia's harassed brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't get people to believe what they won't believe by
      telling them that it's true," she whispered to herself.
      "Yet Poppy did stay here: she did, she did! And it's
      <i>too</i> unfair that I should lose more prestige over
      that, when I ought to have recovered all that I had lost .
      . . What is it, Grosvenor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor handed her a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Georgie won't be back till Monday instead of
      Saturday," said Lucia in a toneless voice. "Anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall Cook do the shopping, ma'am, if you're not going
      out? It's early closing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I shall be alone for lunch and dinner," said Lucia,
      wishing that it were possible for all human affairs to shut
      down with the shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at Georgie's telegram again, amazed at its
      light-heartedness. "Having such fun," it ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Olga insists I stop till Monday. Know you won't mind.
      Devoted Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      She longed for devoted Georgie, and fantastic ideas born of
      pure misery darted through her head. She thought of
      replying: "Come back at once and stand by me. Nobody
      believes that Poppy slept here." She thought of asking the
      B.B.C. to broadcast an S.O.S.: "Will George Pillson last
      heard of to-day at Le Touquet, return at once to Tilling
      where his wife the Mayor--" No, she could not say she was
      dangerously ill. That would alarm him; besides he would
      find on arrival that she was perfectly well. He might even
      come by air, and then the plane might crash and he would be
      burned to death. She realised that such thoughts were of
      the most morbid nature, and wondered if a glass of sherry
      would disperse them. But she resisted. "I won't risk
      becoming like Major Benjy," she said to herself, "and I've
      got to stick it alone till Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours crept dismally by: she had lunch, tea and dinner
      by herself. One fragment of news reached her through
      Grosvenor and that was not encouraging. Her cook had
      boasted to Elizabeth's parlour-maid that she had cooked
      dinner for a Duchess, and the parlour-maid with an odd
      laugh, had advised her not to be so sure about that. Cook
      had returned in a state of high indignation, which possibly
      she had expressed by saturating Lucia's soup with pepper,
      and putting so much mustard into her devilled chicken that
      it might have been used as a plaster for the parlour-maid.
      Perhaps these fiery substances helped to kindle Lucia again
      materially, and all day psychical stimulants were at work:
      pride which refused to surrender, the extreme boredom of
      being alone, and the consciousness of rectitude. So next
      morning, after making sure that Elizabeth was not lurking
      about, Lucia set forth with her market-basket. Irene was
      just coming out of her house, and met her with a grave and
      sympathetic face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, I am so sorry about it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia naturally supposed that she was referring to the
      rejection of the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't give it another thought," she said. "It will be such
      a joy to have it at Mallards. They're all Goths and Vandals
      and Elizabeths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh that!" said Irene. "Who cares? Just wait till I've
      touched up Elizabeth and Benjy for the Carlton Gallery. No,
      about this septic Duchess. Why did you do it? So unwise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia wondered if some fresh horror had ripened, and her
      mouth went dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did I do what?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say that she'd been to stay with you, when she didn't even
      know you by sight. So futile!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she did stay with me!" cried Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Irene soothingly. "Don't go on saying it. It
      wounds me. Naturally, you were vexed at her not recognising
      you. You <i>had</i> seen her before somewhere, hadn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is preposterous!" cried Lucia. "You <i>must</i>
      believe me. We had dressed crab for dinner. She went to bed
      early. She slept in the spare room. She snored. We
      breakfasted at half-past-seven--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, we won't talk about it any more," said Irene.
      "Whenever you want me, I'll come to you. Just send for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall want you," said Lucia with awful finality, "when
      you beg my pardon for not believing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene uttered a dismal cry, and went back into her house.
      Lucia with a face of stone went on to the High Street. As
      she was leaving the grocer's her basket bumped against
      Diva's, who was entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry," said Diva. "Rather in a hurry. My fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if an iceberg, straight from the North Pole, had
      apologized. Mr. Wyse was just stepping on to the pavement,
      and he stood hatless as she hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely weather, isn't it?" she said. "Georgie writes to me
      that they're having the same at Le Touquet. We must have
      some more Bridge parties when he gets back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You enjoy your Bridge so much, and play it so
      beautifully," said Mr. Wyse with a bow. "And, believe me, I
      shall never forget your kindness over Susan's budgerigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lucia's agitated state, this sounded dreadfully like an
      assurance that, in spite of all, she hadn't lost his
      friendship. Then with an accession of courage, she
      determined to stick to her guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duchess's visit to me was at such short notice," she
      said, "that there was literally not time to get a few
      friends together. She would so much have liked to see you
      and Susan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good of you to say so. I--I heard that she had spent
      the night under your hospitable roof. Ah! I see Susan
      beckoning to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's shopping had not raised her spirits, and when she
      went up the street again towards Mallards, there was
      Elizabeth on the pavement opposite, at her easel. But now
      the sight of her braced Lucia. It flashed through her mind
      that her dear Mayoress had selected this subject for her
      sketch in order to keep an eye on her, to observe, as
      through a malicious microscope, her joyless exits and
      entrances and report to her friends how sad and wan she
      looked: otherwise Elizabeth would never have attempted
      anything which required the power to draw straight lines
      and some knowledge, however elementary, of perspective. All
      the more reason, then, that Lucia should be at her very
      best and brightest and politest and most withering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth out of the corner of her eye saw her approaching
      and kissed the top end of her paint-brush to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear Worship," she said. "Been shopping and
      chatting with all your friends? Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, <i>sindaca mia,"</i> she said. "That means
      Mayoress, dear. Oh, what a promising sketch! But have you
      quite got the mellow tone of the bricks in my garden-room?
      I should suggest just a touch of brown-madder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth's paint-brush began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear," she said. "Brown-madder. I must remember
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a little rose-madder mixed with burnt sienna would do
      as well," continued Lucia. "Just stippled on. You will find
      that will give the glowing effect you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth wondered whether Lucia could have realised that
      nobody in Tilling believed that Poppy had ever stayed with
      her and yet remain so complacent and superior. She hoped to
      find an opportunity of introducing that topic. But she
      could find something to say on the subject of Art first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So lovely for quaint Irene to have had this great success
      with her picture of me," she said. "The Carlton Gallery,
      she tells me, and then perhaps an American purchaser. Such
      a pity that masterpieces have to leave the country. Luckily
      her picture of you is likely to remain here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a terrible set-back for Irene," said Lucia, as
      glibly as if she had learned this dialogue by heart, "when
      your Committee induced the Council to reject it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible to take any other view," said Elizabeth. "A
      daub. We couldn't have it in our beautiful Town Hall. And
      it didn't do you justice, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How interesting that you should say that!" said Lucia.
      "Dear Irene felt just that about her picture of you. She
      felt she had not put enough character into your face. She
      means to make some little alterations in it before she
      sends it to the Carlton Galleries."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was alarming: Elizabeth remembered the "little
      alterations" Irene had made before. But she did not allow
      that to unnerve her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I am afraid she will never rise to the level of
      her Venus again," she sighed. "Her high-water mark. Her
      picture of you, for instance. It might have been out of Mr.
      Wyse's pieces of still life: bicycle, piano, packs of
      cards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day when I can find time, I will explain to you the
      principles of symbolism," Lucia promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth saw her way to the desired topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dear," she said fervently. "That would be a
      treat. But I know how busy you are with all your duties and
      all your entertaining. Have you had any more visitors to
      dine and sleep and go away very early next morning before
      they had seen anything of our lovely Tilling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow was wholly unexpected and it shook Lucia. She
      pulled herself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me think," she said. "Such a succession of people
      dropping in. No! I think the dear Duchess was my last
      guest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lovely evening you must have had," said Elizabeth.
      "Two old friends together. How I love a <i>tête-à-tête,</i>
      just like what we're having now with nobody to interrupt.
      Roaming over all sorts of subjects, like bees sipping at
      flowers. How much you always teach me, Worship. Rose-madder
      and burnt sienna to give luminousness--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia clutched at the return of this topic, and surveyed
      Elizabeth's sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So glad to have given you that little tip," she said.
      "Immense improvement, isn't it? How the bricks glow now--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't put any madder on yet, brown or rose," cooed
      Elizabeth, "but so glad to know about it. And is poor
      Duchess's memory really as bad as it seemed? How dreadful
      for you if she had forgotten her own name as well as
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite suddenly Lucia knew that she had no more force left
      in her. She could only just manage a merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a delicious social crisis that would be!" she said.
      "You ought to send it to some comic paper. And what a
      pleasant talk we have had! I could stay here all morning
      chatting, but alas, I have a hundred arrears to get
      through. <i>Addio, cara sindaca."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked without hurrying up the steps to her door and
      tottered out into the garden-room. Presently she crept to
      the observation post behind the curtain and looked out.
      Benjy had joined the Mayoress, and something she said
      caused him to laugh very heartily . . . And even devoted
      Irene did not believe that Poppy had ever stayed here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day was Sunday. As Lucia listened to the joyful peal
      of the bells she wondered whether, without Georgie, she
      could meet the fresh ordeal that awaited her, when after
      the service Tilling society assembled outside the south
      porch of the church for the Sunday morning chat which took
      the place of the week-day shopping. To shirk that would be
      a tacit confession that she could not face her friends: she
      might just as well, from the social point of view, not go
      to church at all. But though the <i>débâcle</i> appeared so
      complete, she knew that her essential spirit was unbroken:
      it would be "given her," she felt, to make that manifest in
      some convincing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang very loud in the hymns and psalms, she winced when
      the organist had a slight misunderstanding with the choir,
      she let ecclesiastical smiles play over her face when she
      found herself in sympathy with the doctrine of the curate's
      sermon, she gave liberally to the offertory. When the
      service was over she waited outside the south porch.
      Elizabeth followed close behind, and behind Elizabeth were
      other familiar faces. Lucia felt irresistibly reminded of
      the hymn she had just been singing about the hosts of
      Midian who 'prowled and prowled around'. . . . So much the
      worse for the hosts of Midian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear," said Elizabeth. "No Mr. Georgie in
      church? Not ill I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, particularly well," said Lucia, "and enjoying himself
      so much at Le Touquet that he's staying till Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet of you to allow him," responded Elizabeth, "for you
      must be so lonely without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that precise moment there took possession of Lucia an
      emotion to which hitherto she had been a stranger, namely
      sheer red rage. In all the numerous crises of her career
      her brain had always been occupied with getting what she
      wanted and with calm triumph when she got it, or with
      devising plans to extricate herself from tight places and
      with scaring off those who had laid traps for her. Now all
      such insipidities were swept away; rage at the injustice
      done her thrilled every fibre of her being, and she found
      the sensation delicious. She began rather gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lonely?" she asked. "I don't know the word. How could I be
      lonely with my books and my music and my work, above all
      with so many loving loyal friends like yourself, dear
      Elizabeth, so close about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the stuff to give her. That made her wince," she
      thought, and opening the furnace doors she turned to the
      group of loving loyal friends, who had emerged from church,
      and were close about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm still the deserted wife, you see," she said gaily. "My
      Georgie can't tear himself away from the sirens at Le
      Touquet, Olga and Poppy and the rest. Oh, Mr. Wyse, what a
      cold you've got! You must take care of yourself: your
      sister the Contessa Amelia di Faraglione would never have
      allowed you to come out! Dear Susan! No Royce? Have you
      actually walked all the way from Porpoise Street? You
      mustn't overdo it! Diva, how is Paddy? He's not been sick
      again, I hope, after eating one of your delicious sardine
      tartlets. Yes, Georgie's not back yet. I am thinking of
      going by aeroplane to Le Touquet this afternoon, just to
      dine and sleep--like Poppy--and return with him tomorrow.
      And Susanna! I hear you've been so busy with your new story
      about Tilling. I do hope you will get someone to publish it
      when it's finished. Dear Diva, what a silly mistake I've
      made: of course it was the recipe for cream-wafers which
      Susanna's <i>chef</i> gave you which made Paddy so unwell.
      Irene? You in church? Was it not a lovely sermon, all about
      thinking evil of your friends? Good morning, Major Benjy.
      You must get poor Mr. Wyse to try your favourite cure for
      colds. A tumbler of whisky, isn't it, every two hours with
      a little boiling water according to taste. Au revoir, dear
      ones. See you all to-morrow I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and kissed her hand, and walked off without
      turning her head, a little out of breath with this
      shattering eloquence, but rejoicing and rejuvenated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That <i>was</i> a pleasure," she said to herself, "and to
      think that I was ever terrified of meeting them! What a
      coward! I don't think I left anybody out: I insulted each
      one in the presence of all the rest. That's what they get
      for not believing that Poppy stayed here, and for thinking
      that I was down and out. I've given them something else to
      think about. I've paid them back, thank God, and now we'll
      see what will happen next."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, of course, had no intention of flying to Le Touquet,
      but she drove to Seaport next morning to meet Georgie. He
      was wearing a new French yachting costume with a
      double-breasted jacket and brass buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, how delightful of you to come and meet me!" he
      said. "Quite a smooth crossing. Do you like my clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too smart for anything, Georgie, and I am so glad to see
      you again. Such a lot to tell you which I couldn't write."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elizabeth been behaving well?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fiendishly. A real crisis, Georgie, and you've come into
      the middle of it. I'll tell you all about it as we go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave an unbiassed and lucid sketch of what had
      happened, peppered by indignant and excited comments from
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poppy's imbecile--yes I call her Poppy to her face, she
      asked me to--Fancy her forgetting you: just the sort of
      thing for that foul Mapp to make capital of--And so like
      her to get the Council to reject the picture of you--My
      dear, you cried? What a shame, and how very unlike you--And
      they don't believe Poppy stayed with you? Why of course she
      did! She talked about it--Even Irene?--How utterly
      poisonous of them all!--Hurrah, I'm glad you gave it them
      hot after church. Capital! We'll do something stunning, now
      that we can put our heads together about it. I must hear it
      all over again bit by bit. And here we are in the High
      Street. There's Mapp, grinning like a Cheshire cat. We'll
      cut her anyhow, just to make a beginning: we can't go wrong
      over that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, do you know, I'm very glad to be back," he said.
      "Olga was perfectly sweet, as she always is, but there were
      other things. It would have been far better if I'd come
      home on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how thrilling!" cried Lucia, forgetting her own
      crisis for a brief second. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you afterwards. Hullo, Grosvenor, how are you?
      Yes, I think I'll have a warm bath after my journey and
      then rest till tea-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had tea in his sitting-room after he had rested, where
      he was arranging his bibelots, for Grosvenor had not put
      them back, after dusting them, exactly as he wished. This
      done, he took up his needle-work and his narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been rather upsetting," he said. "Poppy was terribly
      ill on her crossing, and I didn't see her till next day,
      after I had settled to stop at Olga's over the Sunday, as I
      telegraphed. And then she was very queer. She took hold of
      my hand under the table at dinner, and trod on my foot and
      smiled at me most oddly. She wouldn't play Bridge, but came
      and sat close up against me. One thing after another--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, what a horrid woman," said Lucia. "How could she
      dare? Did she try--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Georgie hastily. "Nothing important. Olga
      assured me she didn't mean anything of the sort, but that
      she always behaved like that to people with beards. Olga
      wasn't very sympathetic about it: in fact she came to my
      room one night, and simply went into fits of laughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your bedroom, Georgie?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She often did when we went upstairs and talked for a
      bit. But Poppy was very embarrassing. I'm not good at that
      sort of thing. And yesterday, she made me go for a walk
      with her along the beach, and wanted to paddle with me. But
      I was quite firm about that. I said I should go inland at
      once if she went on about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, dear. Just what I should have done myself,"
      said Lucia appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so those last two days weren't so pleasant. I was
      uncomfortable. I wished I'd come back on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very tiresome for you, dear," said Lucia. "But it's all
      over now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just what I'm not so sure about," said he. "She's
      leaving Olga's to-morrow, and she's going to telegraph to
      you, asking if you would let her stay here for a couple of
      nights. Apparently you begged her to propose herself. You
      must really say your house is full or that you're away.
      Though Olga says she means no harm, it's most
      disagreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sprang from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how absolutely providential!" she cried. "If only
      she came, it would kill that despicable scandal that she
      hadn't stayed here before. They would be forced to believe
      that she had. Oh! What a score!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I couldn't stop here if she came," said Georgie
      firmly. "It got on my nerves. It made me feel very jumpy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then she mightn't stop if she found you weren't here,"
      pleaded Lucia. "Besides, as Olga says, she doesn't mean
      anything, I shall be with you; surely that will be
      sufficient protection, and I won't leave you alone with her
      a minute all day. And if you're nervous, you may sleep in
      my room. Just while she's here, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't think either of us would like that," said
      Georgie, "and Foljambe would think it so odd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you could lock your door. Oh, Georgie, it isn't
      really much to ask, and it will put me on a higher pinnacle
      than ever, far, far above their base insinuations. They
      will eat their hearts out with shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A telegram for you, ma'am. Prepaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling hands Lucia tore it open, and, for
      Grosvenor's benefit, assumed her drawling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the Duchess, dear," she said. "She wants to come here
      to-morrow for two nights, on her way back from Le Touquet.
      I suppose I had better say yes, as I did ask her to propose
      herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia scribbled a cordial reply, and Grosvenor took it away
      with the tea-tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino, you're an angel," said she. "My dear, all the
      time that I was so wretched here, I knew it would all come
      right as soon as you got back, and see what has happened!
      Now let us make our plans at once. I think we'll ask nobody
      the first night she is here--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor the second either I should hope," said Georgie, "Give
      them a good lesson. Besides, after the way you talked to
      them yesterday after church, they probably wouldn't come.
      That would be a knock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia regarded an angle of the ceiling with that far away
      abstracted expression with which she listened to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About their coming, dear," she said, "I will wager my
      knowledge of human nature that they will without exception.
      As to my asking them, you know how I trust your judgment,
      but here I'm not sure that I agree. Don't you think that to
      forgive them all, and to behave as if nothing had happened,
      would be the most devastating thing I could do? There's
      nothing that stings so much as contemptuous oblivion. I
      have often found that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say that you'll ask Elizabeth Mapp-Flint
      to dine?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, Georgie, poor soul. If I don't she will feel
      that she has hurt me, that I want to pay her out. I
      shouldn't like her to feel that. I don't want to leave her
      a leg to stand on. Up till now I have never desired quite
      to crush her, but I feel I have been too lenient. If she is
      to become a better woman, I must give her a sharper lesson
      than merely ignoring her. I may remind her by some little
      impromptu touch of what she tried to do to me, but I shall
      trust to the inspiration of the moment about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie came round to Lucia's view of the value of
      vindictive forgiveness, while for himself he liked the idea
      of calling a Duchess by her Christian name before Mapp and
      Co. He would not even mind her holding his hand if there
      were plenty of people there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be a wonderful party," he said. "Even better
      than the party you gave for Olga. I'm beginning to look
      forward to it. Shall I help you with writing the
      invitations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not necessary, dear, thank you," said Lucia. "I shall ask
      them all quite casually by telephone on the afternoon of
      our dinner. Leave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Poppy arrived next evening, again prostrated by seasickness
      and far from amorous. But a good night restored her, and
      the three took a morning stroll in the High Street, so that
      everybody saw them. Lucia, absolutely certain that there
      would be a large dinner-party at Mallards that night,
      ordered appropriate provisions. In the afternoon they went
      for a motor-drive: just before starting Lucia directed
      Foljambe to ring up the whole circle of friends, asking
      them to excuse such short notice and take pot-luck with
      her, and not a word was Foljambe to say about Duchesses.
      They knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ducal party traversed the country roads, the
      telephone bells of Tilling were ringing merrily. For the
      Wyses were engaged to dine and play Bridge with the
      Mapp-Flints, and Susan, feeling certain that she would not
      meet the Mapp-Flints anyhow at Mallards, rang up Elizabeth
      to say that she was not feeling at all well and regretted
      not being able to come. Algernon, she said, did not like to
      leave her. To her surprise Elizabeth was all cordiality:
      dear Susan must not think of going out, it was no
      inconvenience at all, and they would arrange another night.
      So, with sighs of relief, they both rang up Mallards, and
      found that the line was engaged, for Susan Leg, having
      explained to Diva that she had made a stupid mistake, and
      had meant to ask her for tomorrow not for to-night, was
      telling Foljambe that she would be charmed to come. Diva
      got the line next, and fussing with this delay, Elizabeth
      sent Benjy round to Mallards to say how pleased. Then to
      make certain, they all wrote formal notes of acceptance. As
      for Irene, she was so overcome with remorse at having ever
      doubted Lucia's word, and so overwhelmed by her nobility in
      forgiving her, that she burst into tears, and forgot to
      answer at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poppy was very late for dinner, and all Lucia's guests had
      arrived before she appeared. They were full of a timid yet
      eager cordiality, as if scarcely believing that such
      magnanimity was possible, and their hostess was
      graciousness itself. She was particularly kind to Elizabeth
      and made enquiries about her sketch. Then as Poppy still
      lingered she said to Georgie: "Run up to Poppy's room,
      dear, and tell her she must be quick." She had hardly got
      that pleasant sentence out when Poppy entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty!" said Lucia, and took her arm to introduce the
      company. "Mr. and Mrs. Wyse, Miss Leg (Rudolph da Vinci,
      you know, dear), Miss Irene Coles--the picture of the
      year--and Mrs. Plaistow: didn't you have one of her
      delicious teas when you were here? And my Mayoress, Mrs.
      Mapp-Flint, I don't think you met her when you stayed with
      me last week. And Major Mapp-Flint. Now everybody knows
      everybody. Sherry, dear Poppy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie kept his hands on the table during dinner, and
      Poppy intermittently caressed the one nearest her in a
      casual manner; with so many witnesses and in so bright a
      light, Georgie liked it rather than otherwise. Her attempt
      to stroll with him alone in the garden afterwards was
      frustrated, for Lucia, as bound by her promise, instantly
      joined them, and brought them back to the garden-room. She
      was induced to play to them, and Poppy, sitting close to
      Georgie on the sofa, fell into a refreshing slumber. At the
      cessation of the music, she woke with a start and asked
      what the time was. A most distinguished suavity prevailed,
      and though the party lacked the gaiety and lightness of the
      Olga-festival, its quality was far more monumental. Then
      the guests dispersed; Lucia had a kind word for each and
      she thanked them all for having excused her giving them
      such short notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth walked home in silence with Benjy. Her exaltation
      evaporated in the night-air like the fumes of wine, leaving
      behind an irritated depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's no help for it," she said bitterly, as he
      fumbled with the latch-key of the Vicarage. "But I daresay
      before long--Do be quick."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later at Mallards, Lucia, having seen Poppy
      well on the way to bed, tapped discreetly at Georgie's
      door. That gave him a terrible fright, till he remembered
      he had locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you can't come in," he said. "Good night, Poppy. Sleep
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me, Georgie," said Lucia in a low voice. "Open the
      door: only a chink. She isn't here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie unlocked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect!" she whispered. "Such a treat for them all! They
      will remember this evening. Perfect."
    </p>
    <p>
