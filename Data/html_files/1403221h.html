  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">This special RGL/PGA edition of <i>Chronicles of Martin
  Hewitt</i> includes 42 illustrations that D. Murray Smith drew for <i>The
  Windsor Magazine</i> and six illustrations by William Kirkpatrick from the
  edition of the book published by L.C. Page Co., Boston, in 1907.</p>

  <p class="note">The L.C. Page edition prefaced the book with the following
  publisher's note:</p>

  <p class="note">"The success of Mr. Arthur Morrison's recent books, <i>The
  Green Diamond</i> and <i>The Red Triangle</i>, has made the demand for the
  reissue of the present edition of his first (<I>sic</I>) success, <i>The Chronicles
  of Martin Hewitt, Detective</i>, imperative. This book relates the earlier
  adventures of the keen-witted investigator, whose solution of the mystery of
  the Red Triangle is well remembered by the readers of that clever detective
  story. The value and interest of the new edition is enhanced by six spirited
  illustrations drawn by Mr. William Kirkpatrick."</p>

  <p class="note">The editor who wrote this seems unaware of the fact that
  Morrison's first big success in the detective genre was <i>Martin Hewitt,
  Investigator</i>. Indeed, the very title of the L.C. Page edition, <i>The
  Chronicles of Martin Hewitt, Detective</i>, appears to be a modified
  portmanteau of the titles of the first and second book in the series, for the
  original title of the present volume was simply <i>Chronicles of Martin
  Hewitt</i>. &mdash; RG.</p>

  <p class="first">I HAD been working double tides for a month: at night on my
  morning paper, as usual; and in the morning on an evening paper as <i>locum
  tenens</i> for another man who was taking a holiday. This was an exhausting
  plan of work, although it only actually involved some six hours' attendance a
  day, or less, at the two offices. I turned up at the headquarters of my own
  paper at ten in the evening, and by the time I had seen the editor, selected
  a subject, written my leader, corrected the slips, chatted, smoked, and so
  on, and cleared off, it was very usually one o'clock. This meant bed at two,
  or even three, after supper at the club.</p>

  <p>This was all very well at ordinary periods, when any time in the morning
  would do for rising, but when I had to be up again soon after seven, and
  round at the evening paper office by eight, I naturally felt a little worn
  and disgusted with things by midday, after a sharp couple of hours'
  leaderette scribbling and paragraphing, with attendant sundries.</p>

  <p>But the strain was over, and on the first day of comparative comfort I
  indulged in a midday breakfast and the first undisgusted glance at a morning
  paper for a month. I felt rather interested in an inquest, begun the day
  before, on the body of a man whom I had known very slightly before I took to
  living in chambers.</p>

  <p>His name was Gavin Kingscote, and he was an artist of a casual and
  desultory sort, having, I believe, some small private means of his own. As a
  matter of fact, he had boarded in the same house in which I had lodged myself
  for a while, but as I was at the time a late homer and a fairly early riser,
  taking no regular board in the house, we never became much acquainted. He had
  since, I understood, made some judicious Stock Exchange speculations, and had
  set up house in Finchley.</p>

  <p>Now the news was that he had been found one morning murdered in his
  smoking-room, while the room itself, with others, was in a state of
  confusion. His pockets had been rifled, and his watch and chain were gone,
  with one or two other small articles of value. On the night of the tragedy a
  friend had sat smoking with him in the room where the murder took place, and
  he had been the last person to see Mr Kingscote alive. A jobbing gardener,
  who kept the garden in order by casual work from time to time, had been
  arrested in consequence of footprints, exactly corresponding with his boots,
  having been found on the garden beds near the French window of the
  smoking-room.</p>

  <p>I finished my breakfast and my paper, and Mrs Clayton, the housekeeper,
  came to clear my table. She was sister of my late landlady of the house where
  Kingscote had lodged, and it was by this connection that I had found my
  chambers. I had not seen the housekeeper since the crime was first reported,
  so I now said:</p>

  <p>"This is shocking news of Mr Kingscote, Mrs Clayton. Did you know him
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>She had apparently only been waiting for some such remark to burst out
  with whatever information she possessed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," she exclaimed: "shocking indeed. Pore young feller! I see him
  often when I was at my sister's, and he was always a nice, quiet gentleman,
  so different from some. My sister, she's awful cut up, sir, I assure you. And
  what d'you think 'appened, sir, only last Tuesday? You remember Mr
  Kingscote's room where he painted the woodwork so beautiful with gold
  flowers, and blue, and pink? He used to tell my sister she'd always have
  something to remember him by. Well, two young fellers, gentlemen I can't call
  them, come and took that room (it being to let), and went and scratched off
  all the paint in mere wicked mischief, and then chopped up all the panels
  into sticks and bits! Nice sort o' gentlemen them! And then they bolted in
  the morning, being afraid, I s'pose, of being made to pay after treating a
  pore widder's property like that. That was only Tuesday, and the very next
  day the pore young gentleman himself's dead, murdered in his own 'ouse, and
  him goin' to be married an' all! Dear, dear! I remember once he
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs Clayton was a good soul, but once she began to talk some one else had
  to stop her. I let her run on for a reasonable time, and then rose and
  prepared to go out. I remembered very well the panels that had been so
  mischievously destroyed. They made the room the showroom of the house, which
  was an old one. They were indeed less than half finished when I came away,
  and Mrs Lamb, the landlady, had shown them to me one day when Kingscote was
  out. All the walls of the room were panelled and painted white, and Kingscote
  had put upon them an eccentric but charming decoration, obviously suggested
  by some of the work of Mr Whistler. Tendrils, flowers, and butterflies in a
  quaint convention wandered thinly from panel to panel, giving the otherwise
  rather uninteresting room an unwonted atmosphere of richness and elegance.
  The lamentable jackasses who had destroyed this had certainly selected the
  best feature of the room whereon to inflict their senseless mischief.</p>

  <p>I strolled idly downstairs, with no particular plan for the afternoon in
  my mind, and looked in at Hewitt's offices. Hewitt was reading a note, and
  after a little chat he informed me that it had been left an hour ago, in his
  absence, by the brother of the man I had just been speaking of.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1B"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"He isn't quite satisfied," Hewitt said, "with the way the police are
  investigating the case, and asks me to run down to Finchley and look round.
  Yesterday I should have refused, because I have five cases in progress
  already, but today I find that circumstances have given me a day or two.
  Didn't you say you knew the man?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely more than by sight. He was a boarder in the house at Chelsea
  where I stayed before I started chambers."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well; I think I shall look into the thing. Do you feel particularly
  interested in the case? I mean, if you've nothing better to do, would you
  come with me?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad," I said. "I was in some doubt what to do with
  myself. Shall you start at once?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. Kerrett, just call a cab. By the way, Brett, which paper has
  the fullest report of the inquest yesterday? I'll run over it as we go
  down."</p>

  <p>As I had only seen one paper that morning, I could not answer Hewitt's
  question. So we bought various papers as we went along in the cab, and I
  found the reports while Martin Hewitt studied them. Summarized, this was the
  evidence given:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>Sarah Dodson</i>, general servant, deposed that she had
  been in service at Ivy Cottage, the residence of the deceased, for five
  months, the only other regular servant being the housekeeper and cook. On the
  evening of the previous Tuesday both servants retired a little before eleven,
  leaving Mr Kingscote with a friend in the smoking or sitting room. She never
  saw her master again alive. On coining downstairs the following morning and
  going to open the smoking-room windows, she was horrified to discover the
  body of Mr Kingscote lying on the floor of the room with blood about the
  head. She at once raised an alarm, and, on the instructions of the
  housekeeper, fetched a doctor, and gave information to the police. In answer
  to questions, witness stated she had heard no noise of any sort during the
  night, nor had anything suspicious occurred.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Hannah Carr</i>, housekeeper and cook, deposed that she
  had been in the late Mr Kingscote's service since he had first taken Ivy
  Cottage&mdash;a period of rather more than a year. She had last seen the
  deceased alive on the evening of the previous Tuesday, at half-past ten, when
  she knocked at the door of the smoking-room, where Mr Kingscote was sitting
  with a friend, to ask if he would require anything more. Nothing was
  required, so witness shortly after went to bed. In the morning she was called
  by the previous witness, who had just gone downstairs, and found the body of
  deceased lying as described. Deceased's watch and chain were gone, as also
  was a ring he usually wore, and his pockets appeared to have been turned out.
  All the ground floor of the house was in confusion, and a bureau, a
  writing-table, and various drawers were open&mdash;a bunch of keys usually
  carried by deceased being left hanging at one keyhole. Deceased had drawn
  some money from the bank on the Tuesday, for current expenses; how much she
  did not know. She had not heard or seen anything suspicious during the night.
  Besides Dodson and herself, there were no regular servants; there was a
  charwoman, who came occasionally, and a jobbing gardener, living near, who
  was called in as required.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Mr James Vidler</i>, surgeon, had been called by the
  first witness between seven and eight on Wednesday morning. He found the
  deceased lying on his face on the floor of the smoking-room, his feet being
  about eighteen inches from the window, and his head lying in the direction of
  the fireplace. He found three large contused wounds on the head, any one of
  which would probably have caused death. The wounds had all been inflicted,
  apparently, with the same blunt instrument&mdash;probably a club or life
  preserver, or other similar weapon. They could not have been done with the
  poker. Death was due to concussion of the brain, and deceased had probably
  been dead seven or eight hours when witness saw him. He had since examined
  the body more closely, but found no marks at all indicative of a struggle
  having taken place; indeed, from the position of the wounds and their
  severity, he should judge that the deceased had been attacked unawares from
  behind, and had died at once. The body appeared to be perfectly
  healthy.</p><br>

  <p>Then there was police evidence, which showed that all the doors and
  windows were found shut and completely fastened, except the front door,
  which, although shut, was not bolted. There were shutters behind the French
  windows in the smoking-room, and these were found fastened. No money was
  found in the bureau, nor in any of the opened drawers, so that if any had
  been there, it had been stolen. The pockets were entirely empty, except for a
  small pair of nail scissors, and there was no watch upon the body, nor a
  ring. Certain footprints were found on the garden beds, which had led the
  police to take certain steps. No footprints were to be seen on the garden
  path, which was hard gravel.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>Mr Alexander Campbell</i>, stockbroker, stated that he
  had known deceased for some few years, and had done business for him. He and
  Mr Kingscote frequently called on one another, and on Tuesday evening they
  dined together at Ivy Cottage. They sat smoking and chatting till nearly
  twelve o'clock, when Mr Kingscote himself let him out, the servants having
  gone to bed. Here the witness proceeded rather excitedly: "That is all I know
  of this horrible business, and I can say nothing else. What the police mean
  by following and watching me&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>The Coroner</i>: "Pray be calm, Mr Campbell. The police
  must do what seems best to them in a case of this sort. I am sure you would
  not have them neglect any means of getting at the truth."</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Witness</i>: "Certainly not. But if they suspect me, why
  don't they say so? It is intolerable that I should be&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>The Coroner</i>: "Order, order, Mr Campbell. You are here
  to give evidence."</p><br>

  <p>The witness then, in answer to questions, stated that the French windows
  of the smoking-room had been left open during the evening, the weather being
  very warm. He could not recollect whether or not deceased closed them before
  he left, but he certainly did not close the shutters. Witness saw nobody near
  the house when he left.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Mr Douglas Kingscote</i>, architect, said deceased was
  his brother. He had not seen him for some months, living as he did in another
  part of the country. He believed his brother was fairly well off, and he knew
  that he had made a good amount by speculation in the last year or two. Knew
  of no person who would be likely to owe his brother a grudge, and could
  suggest no motive for the crime except ordinary robbery. His brother was to
  have been married in a few weeks. Questioned further on this point, witness
  said that the marriage was to have taken place a year ago, and it was with
  that view that Ivy Cottage, deceased's residence, was taken. The lady,
  however, sustained a domestic bereavement, and afterwards went abroad with
  her family: she was, witness believed, shortly expected back to England.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>William Bates</i>, jobbing gardener, who was brought up
  in custody, was cautioned, but elected to give evidence. Witness, who
  appeared to be much agitated, admitted having been in the garden of Ivy
  Cottage at four in the morning, but said that he had only gone to attend to
  certain plants, and knew absolutely nothing of the murder. He however
  admitted that he had no order for work beyond what he had done the day
  before. Being further pressed, witness made various contradictory statements,
  and finally said that he had gone to take certain plants away.</p><br>

  <p>The inquest was then adjourned.</p>

  <p>This was the cast as it stood&mdash;apparently not a case presenting any
  very striking feature, although there seemed to me to be doubtful
  peculiarities in many parts of it. I asked Hewitt what he thought.</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible to think anything, my boy, just yet; wait till we see
  the place. There are any number of possibilities. Kingscote's friend,
  Campbell, may have come in again, you know, by way of the window&mdash;or he
  may not. Campbell may have owed him money or something&mdash;or he may not.
  The anticipated wedding may have something to do with it&mdash;or, again,
  <i>that</i> may not. There is no limit to the possibilities, as far as we see
  from this report&mdash;a mere dry husk of the affair. When we get closer we
  shall examine the possibilities by the light of more detailed information.
  One <i>probability</i> is that the wretched gardener is innocent. It seems to
  me that his was only a comparatively blameless manoeuvre not unheard of at
  other times in his trade. He came at four in the morning to steal away the
  flowers he had planted the day before, and felt rather bashful when
  questioned on the point. Why should he trample on the beds, else? I wonder if
  the police thought to examine the beds for traces of rooting up, or
  questioned the housekeeper as to any plants being missing? But we shall
  see."</p>

  <p>We chatted at random as the train drew near Finchley, and I mentioned
  <i>inter alia</i> the wanton piece of destruction perpetrated at Kingscote's
  late lodgings. Hewitt was interested.</p>

  <p>"That was curious," he said, "very curious. Was anything else damaged?
  Furniture and so forth?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Mrs Clayton said nothing of it, and I didn't ask her. But
  it was quite bad enough as it was. The decoration was really good, and I
  can't conceive a meaner piece of tomfoolery than such an attack on a decent
  woman's property."</p>

  <p>Then Hewitt talked of other cases of similar stupid damage by creatures
  inspired by a defective sense of humour, or mere love of mischief. He had
  several curious and sometimes funny anecdotes of such affairs at museums and
  picture exhibitions, where the damage had been so great as to induce the
  authorities to call him in to discover the offender. The work was not always
  easy, chiefly from the mere absence of intelligible motive; not, indeed,
  always successful. One of the anecdotes related to a case of malicious damage
  to a picture&mdash;the outcome of blind artistic jealousy&mdash;a case which
  had been hushed up by a large expenditure in compensation. It would
  considerably startle most people, could it be printed here, with the actual
  names of the parties concerned.</p>

  <p>Ivy Cottage, Finchley, was a compact little house, standing in a compact
  little square of garden, little more than a third of an acre, or perhaps no
  more at all. The front door was but a dozen yards or so back from the road,
  but the intervening space was well treed and shrubbed. Mr Douglas Kingscote
  had not yet returned from town, but the housekeeper, an intelligent, matronly
  woman, who knew of his intention to call in Martin Hewitt, was ready to show
  us the house.</p>

  <p>"<i>First</i>," Hewitt said, when we stood in the smoking-room, "I observe
  that somebody has shut the drawers and the bureau. That is unfortunate. Also,
  the floor has been washed and the carpet taken up, which is much worse. That,
  I suppose, was because the police had finished their examination, but it
  doesn't help me to make one at all. Has <i>anything</i>&mdash;anything <i>at
  all</i>&mdash;been left as it was on Tuesday morning?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you see everything was in such a muddle," the housekeeper
  began, "and when the police had done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just so. I know. You 'set it to rights', eh? Oh, that setting to rights!
  It has lost me a fortune at one time and another. As to the other rooms, now,
  have they been set to rights?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Such as was disturbed have been put right, sir, of course."</p>

  <p>"Which were disturbed? Let me see them. But wait a moment."</p>

  <p>He opened the French windows, and closely examined the catch and bolts. He
  knelt and inspected the holes whereinto the bolts fell, and then glanced
  casually at the folding shutters. He opened a drawer or two, and tried the
  working of the locks with the keys the housekeeper carried. They were, the
  housekeeper explained, Mr Kingscote's own keys. All through the lower floors
  Hewitt examined some things attentively and closely, and others with scarcely
  a glance, on a system unaccountable to me. Presently, he asked to be shown Mr
  Kingscote's bedroom, which had not been disturbed, "set to rights," or slept
  in since the crime. Here, the housekeeper said, all drawers were kept
  unlocked but two&mdash;one in the wardrobe and one in the dressing-table,
  which Mr Kingscote had always been careful to keep locked. Hewitt immediately
  pulled both drawers open without difficulty. Within, in addition to a few
  odds and ends, were papers. All the contents of these drawers had been turned
  over confusedly, while those of the unlocked drawers were in perfect
  order.</p>

  <p>"The police," Hewitt remarked, "may not have observed these matters. Any
  more than such an ordinary thing as <i>this</i>," he added, picking up a bent
  nail lying at the edge of a rug.</p>

  <p>The housekeeper doubtless took the remark as a reference to the entire
  unimportance of a bent nail, but I noticed that Hewitt dropped the article
  quietly into his pocket.</p>

  <p>We came away. At the front gate we met Mr Douglas Kingscote, who had just
  returned from town. He introduced himself, and expressed surprise at our
  promptitude both of coming and going.</p>

  <p>"You can't have got anything like a clue in this short time, Mr Hewitt?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Hewitt replied, with a certain dryness, "perhaps not. But I
  doubt whether a month's visit would have helped me to get anything very
  striking out of a washed floor and a houseful of carefully cleaned-up and
  'set-to-rights' rooms. Candidly, I don't think you can reasonably expect much
  of me. The police have a much better chance&mdash;they had the scene of the
  crime to examine. I have seen just such a few rooms as anyone might see in
  the first well-furnished house he might enter. The trail of the housemaid has
  overlaid all the others."</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry for that; the fact was, I expected rather more of the
  police; and, indeed, I wasn't here in time entirely to prevent the clearing
  up. But still, I thought your well-known powers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, my 'well-known powers' are nothing but common sense
  assiduously applied and made quick by habit. That won't enable me to see the
  invisible."</p>

  <p>"But can't we have the rooms put back into something of the state they
  were in? The cook will remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no. That would be worse and worse: that would only be the housemaid's
  trail in turn overlaid by the cook's. You must leave things with me for a
  little, I think."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't give the case up?" Mr Kingscote asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! I don't give it up just yet. Do you know anything of your
  brother's private papers&mdash;as they were before his death?"</p>

  <p>"I never knew anything till after that. I have gone over them, but they
  are all very ordinary letters. Do you suspect a theft of papers?"</p>

  <p>Martin Hewitt, with his hands on his stick behind him, looked sharply at
  the other, and shook his head. "No," he said, "I can't quite say that."</p>

  <p>We bade Mr Douglas Kingscote good-day, and walked towards the station.
  "Great nuisance, that setting to rights," Hewitt observed, on the way. "If
  the place had been left alone, the job might have been settled one way or
  another by this time. As it is, we shall have to run over to your old
  lodgings."</p>

  <p>"My old lodgings?" I repeated, amazed. "Why my old lodgings?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt turned to me with a chuckle and a wide smile. "Because we can't see
  the broken panel-work anywhere else," he said. "Let's see&mdash;Chelsea,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Chelsea. But why&mdash;you don't suppose the people who defaced the
  panels also murdered the man who painted them?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Hewitt replied, with another smile, "that would be carrying a
  practical joke rather far, wouldn't it? Even for the ordinary picture
  damager."</p>

  <p>"You mean you <i>don't</i> think they did it, then? But what <i>do</i> you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I don't mean anything but what I say. Come now, this is
  rather an interesting case despite appearances, and it <i>has</i> interested
  me: so much, in fact, that I really think I forgot to offer Mr Douglas
  Kingscote my condolence on his bereavement. You see a problem is a problem,
  whether of theft, assassination, intrigue, or anything else, and I only think
  of it as one. The work very often makes me forget merely human sympathies.
  Now, you have often been good enough to express a very flattering interest in
  my work, and you shall have an opportunity of exercising your own common
  sense in the way I am always having to exercise mine. You shall see all my
  evidence (if I'm lucky enough to get any) as I collect it, and you shall make
  your own inferences. That will be a little exercise for you; the sort of
  exercise I should give a pupil if I had one. But I will give you what
  information I have, and you shall start fairly from this moment. You know the
  inquest evidence such as it was, and you saw everything I did in Ivy
  Cottage?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-1-3.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Yes; I think so. But I'm not much the wiser."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now I will tell you. What does the whole case look like? How
  would you class the crime?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose as the police do. An ordinary case of murder with the object of
  robbery."</p>

  <p>"It is <i>not</i> an ordinary case. If it were, I shouldn't know as much
  as I do, little as that is; the ordinary cases are always difficult. The
  assailant did not come to commit a burglary, although he was a skilled
  burglar, or one of them was, if more than one were concerned. The affair has,
  I think, nothing to do with the expected wedding, nor had Mr Campbell
  anything to do in it&mdash;at any rate, personally&mdash;nor the gardener.
  The criminal (or one of them) was known personally to the dead man, and was
  well-dressed: he (or again one of them, and I think there were two) even had
  a chat with Mr Kingscote before the murder took place. He came to ask for
  something which Mr Kingscote was unwilling to part with,&mdash;perhaps hadn't
  got. It was not a bulky thing. Now you have all my materials before you."</p>

  <p>"But all this doesn't look like the result of the blind spite that would
  ruin a man's work first and attack him bodily afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Spite isn't always blind, and there are other blind things besides spite;
  people with good eyes in their heads are blind sometimes, even
  detectives."</p>

  <p>"But where did you get all this information? What makes you suppose that
  this was a burglar who didn't want to burgle, and a well-dressed man, and so
  on?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt chuckled and smiled again.</p>

  <p>"I saw it&mdash;saw it, my boy, that's all," he said "But here comes the
  train."</p>

  <p>On the way back to town, after I had rather minutely described Kingscote's
  work on the boarding-house panels, Hewitt asked me for the names and
  professions of such fellow lodgers in that house as I might remember. "When
  did you leave yourself?" he ended.</p>

  <p>"Three years ago, or rather more. I can remember Kingscote himself;
  Turner, a medical student&mdash;James Turner, I think; Harvey Challitt,
  diamond merchant's articled pupil&mdash;he was a bad egg entirely, he's doing
  five years for forgery now; by the bye he had the room we are going to see
  till he was marched off, and Kingscote took it&mdash;a year before I left;
  there was Norton&mdash;don't know what he was 'something in the City', I
  think; and Carter Paget, in the Admiralty Office. I don't remember any more
  at this moment; there were pretty frequent changes. But you can get it all
  from Mrs Lamb, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course; and Mrs Lamb's exact address is&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>I gave him the address, and the conversation became disjointed. At
  Farringdon station, where we alighted, Hewitt called two hansoms. Preparing
  to enter one, he motioned me to the other, saying, "You get straight away to
  Mrs Lamb's at once. She may be going to burn that splintered wood, or to set
  things to rights, after the manner of her kind, and you can stop her. I must
  make one or two small inquiries, but I shall be there half an hour after
  you."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell her our object?"</p>

  <p>"Only that I may be able to catch her mischievous lodgers&mdash;nothing
  else yet." He jumped into the hansom and was gone.</p>

  <p>I found Mrs Lamb still in a state of indignant perturbation over the trick
  served her four days before. Fortunately, she had left everything in the
  panelled room exactly as she had found it, with an idea of being better able
  to demand or enforce reparation should her lodgers return. "The room's
  theirs, you see, sir," she said, "till the end of the week, since they paid
  in advance, and they may come back and offer to make amends, although I doubt
  it. As pleasant-spoken a young chap as you might wish, he seemed, him as come
  to take the rooms. 'My cousin,' says he, 'is rather an invalid, havin' only
  just got over congestion of the lungs, and he won't be in London till this
  evening late. He's comin' up from Birmingham,' he ses, 'and I hope he won't
  catch a fresh cold on the way, although of course we've got him muffled up
  plenty.' He took the rooms, sir, like a gentleman, and mentioned several
  gentlemen's names I knew well, as had lodged here before; and then he put
  down on that there very table, sir"&mdash;Mrs Lamb indicated the exact spot
  with her hand, as though that made the whole thing much more
  wonderful&mdash;"he put down on that very table a week's rent in advance, and
  ses, 'That's always the best sort of reference, Mrs Lamb, I think,' as
  kind-mannered as anything&mdash;and never 'aggled about the amount nor
  nothing. He only had a little black bag, but he said his cousin had all the
  luggage coming in the train, and as there was so much, p'r'aps they wouldn't
  get it here till next day. Then he went out and came in with his cousin at
  eleven that night&mdash;Sarah let 'em in her own self&mdash;and in the
  morning they was gone&mdash;and this!" Poor Mrs Lamb, plaintively indignant,
  stretched her arm towards the wrecked panels.</p>

  <p>"If the gentleman as you say is comin' on, sir," she pursued, "can do
  anything to find 'em, I'll prosecute 'em, that I will, if it costs me ten
  pound. I spoke to the constable on the beat, but he only looked like a fool,
  and said if I knew where they were I might charge 'em with wilful damage, or
  county court 'em. Of course I know I can do that if I knew where they were,
  but how can I find 'em? Mr Jones he said his name was; but how many Joneses
  is there in London, sir?"</p>

  <p>I couldn't imagine any answer to a question like this, but I condoled with
  Mrs Lamb as well as I could. She afterwards went on to express herself much
  as her sister had done with regard to Kingscote's death, only as the
  destruction of her panels loomed larger in her mind, she dwelt primarily on
  that. "It might almost seem," she said, "that somebody had a deadly spite on
  the pore young gentleman, and went breakin' up his paintin' one night, and
  murderin' him the next!"</p>

  <p>I examined the broken panels with some care, having half a notion to
  attempt to deduce something from them myself, if possible. But I could deduce
  nothing. The beading had been taken out, and the panels, which were thick in
  the centre but bevelled at the edges, had been removed and split up literally
  into thin firewood, which lay in a tumbled heap on the hearth and about the
  floor. Every panel in the room had been treated in the same way, and the
  result was a pretty large heap of sticks, with nothing whatever about them to
  distinguish them from other sticks, except the paint on one face, which I
  observed in many places had been scratched and scraped away. The rug was
  drawn half across the hearth, and had evidently been used to deaden the sound
  of chopping. But mischief&mdash;wanton and stupid mischief&mdash;was all I
  could deduce from it all.</p>

  <p>Mr Jones's cousin, it seemed, only Sarah had seen, as she admitted him in
  the evening, and then he was so heavily muffled that she could not
  distinguish his features, and would never be able to identify him. But as for
  the other one, Mrs Lamb was ready to swear to him anywhere.</p>

  <p>Hewitt was long in coming, and internal symptoms of the approach of
  dinner-time (we had had no lunch) had made themselves felt before a sharp
  ring at the door-bell foretold his arrival. "I have had to wait for answers
  to a telegram," he said in explanation, "but at any rate I have the
  information I wanted. And these are the mysterious panels, are they?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Lamb's true opinion of Martin Hewitt's behaviour as it proceeded would
  have been amusing to know. She watched in amazement the antics of a man who
  purposed finding out who had been splitting sticks by dint of picking up each
  separate stick and staring at it. In the end he collected a small handful of
  sticks by themselves and handed them to me, saying. "Just put these together
  on the table, Brett, and see what you make of them."</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-1-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>I turned the pieces painted side up, and fitted them together into a
  complete panel, joining up the painted design accurately. "It is an entire
  panel," I said.</p>

  <p>"Good. Now look at the sticks a little more closely, and tell me if you
  notice anything peculiar about them&mdash;any particular in which they?
  differ from all the others."</p>

  <p>I looked. "Two adjoining sticks," I said, "have each a small semi-circular
  cavity stuffed with what seems to be putty. Put together it would mean a
  small circular hole, perhaps a knot-hole, half an inch or so in diameter, in
  the panel, filled in with putty, or whatever it is."</p>

  <p>"A <i>knot-hole</i>?" Hewitt asked, with particular emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, not a knot-hole, of course, because that would go right
  through, and this doesn't. It is probably less than half an inch deep from
  the front surface."</p>

  <p>"Anything else? Look at the whole appearance of the wood itself. Colour,
  for instance."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly darker than the rest."</p>

  <p>"So it is," He took the two pieces carrying the puttied hole, threw the
  rest on the heap, and addressed the landlady. "The Mr Harvey Challitt who
  occupied this room before Mr Kingscote, and who got into trouble for forgery,
  was the Mr Harvey Challitt who was himself robbed of diamonds a few months
  before on a staircase, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," Mrs Lamb replied in some bewilderment. "He certainly was that,
  on his own office stairs, chloroformed."</p>

  <p>"Just so, and when they marched him away because of the forgery, Mr
  Kingscote changed into his rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and very glad I was. It was bad enough to have the disgrace brought
  into the house, without the trouble of trying to get people to take his very
  rooms, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, very awkward, very awkward!" Hewitt interrupted rather
  impatiently. "The man who took the rooms on Monday, now&mdash;you'd never
  seen him before, had you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then is <i>that</i> anything like him?" Hewitt held a cabinet photograph
  before her.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;law, yes, that's <i>him</i>!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt dropped the photograph back into his breast pocket with a contented
  "Um," and picked up his hat. "I think we may soon be able to find that young
  gentleman for you, Mrs Lamb. He is not a very respectable young gentleman,
  and perhaps you are well rid of him, even as it is. Come, Brett," he added,
  "the day hasn't been wasted, after all."</p>

  <p>We made towards the nearest telegraph office. On the way I said, "That
  puttied-up hole in the piece of wood seems to have influenced you. Is it an
  important link?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes," Hewitt answered, "it is. But all those other pieces are
  important, too."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because there are no holes in them." He looked quizzically at my
  wondering face, and laughed aloud. "Come," he said, "I won't puzzle you much
  longer. Here is the post-office. I'll send my wire, and then we'll go and
  dine at Luzatti's."</p>

  <p>He sent his telegram, and we cabbed it to Luzatti's. Among actors,
  journalists, and others who know town and like a good dinner, Luzatti's is
  well known. We went upstairs for the sake of quietness, and took a table
  standing alone in a recess just inside the door. We ordered our dinner, and
  then Hewitt began:</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what <i>your</i> conclusion is in this matter of the Ivy
  Cottage murder."</p>

  <p>"Mine? I haven't one. I'm sorry I'm so very dull, but I really
  haven't."</p>

  <p>"Come, I'll give you a point. Here is the newspaper account (torn
  sacrilegiously from my scrap-book for your benefit) of the robbery
  perpetrated on Harvey Challitt a few months before his forgery. Read it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I remember the circumstances very well. He was carrying two
  packets of diamonds belonging to his firm downstairs to the office of another
  firm of diamond merchants on the ground-floor. It was a quiet time in the
  day, and halfway down he was seized on a dark landing, made insensible by
  chloroform, and robbed of the diamonds&mdash;five or six thousand pounds'
  worth altogether, of stones of various smallish individual values up to
  thirty pounds or so. He lay unconscious on the landing till one of the
  partners, noticing that he had been rather long gone, followed and found him.
  That's all, I think."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all. Well, what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-1-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't quite see the connection with this case."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'll give you another point. The telegram I've just sent
  releases information to the police, in consequence of which they will
  probably apprehend Harvey Challitt and his confederate Henry Gillard,
  <i>alias</i> Jones, for the murder of Gavin Kingscote. Now, then."</p>

  <p>"Challitt! But he's in gaol already."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, consider. Five years' penal was his dose, although for the
  first offence, because the forgery was of an extremely dangerous sort. You
  left Chelsea over three years ago yourself, and you told me that his
  difficulty occurred a year before. That makes four years, at least. Good
  conduct in prison brings a man out of a five year's sentence in that time or
  a little less, and, as a matter of fact, Challitt was released rather more
  than a week ago."</p>

  <p>"Still, I'm afraid I don't see what you are driving at."</p>

  <p>"Whose story is this about the diamond robbery from Harvey Challitt?"</p>

  <p>"His own."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. His own. Does his subsequent record make him look like a person
  whose stories are to be accepted without doubt or question?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no. I think I see&mdash;no, I don't. You mean he stole them himself?
  I've a sort of dim perception of your drift now, but still I can't fix it.
  The whole thing's too complicated."</p>

  <p>"It is a little complicated for a first effort, I admit, so I will tell
  you. This is the story. Harvey Challitt is an artful young man, and decides
  on a theft of his firm's diamonds. He first prepares a hiding-place somewhere
  near the stairs of his office, and when the opportunity arrives he puts the
  stones away, spills his chloroform, and makes a smell&mdash;possibly sniffs
  some, and actually goes off on the stairs, and the whole thing's done. He is
  carried into the office&mdash;the diamonds are gone. He tells of the attack
  on the stairs, as we have heard, and he is believed. At a suitable
  opportunity he takes his plunder from the hiding-place, and goes home to his
  lodgings. What is he to do with those diamonds? He can't sell them yet,
  because the robbery is publicly notorious, and all the regular jewel buyers
  know him.</p>

  <p>"Being a criminal novice, he doesn't know any regular receiver of stolen
  goods, and if he did would prefer to wait and get full value by an ordinary
  sale. There will always be a danger of detection so long as the stones are
  not securely hidden, so he proceeds to hide them. He knows that if any
  suspicion were aroused his rooms would be searched in every likely place, so
  he looks for an unlikely place. Of course, he thinks of taking out a panel
  and hiding them behind that. But the idea is so obvious that it won't do; the
  police would certainly take those panels out to look behind them. Therefore
  he determines to hide them <i>in</i> the panels. See here"&mdash;he took the
  two pieces of wood with the filled hole from his tail pocket and opened his
  penknife&mdash;the putty near the surface is softer than that near the bottom
  of the hole; two different lots of putty, differently mixed, perhaps, have
  been used, therefore, presumably, at different times.</p>

  <p>"But to return to Challitt. He makes holes with a centre-bit in different
  places on the panels, and in each hole he places a diamond, embedding it
  carefully in putty. He smooths the surface carefully flush with the wood, and
  then very carefully paints the place over, shading off the paint at the edges
  so as to leave no signs of a patch. He doesn't do the whole job at once,
  creating a noise and a smell of paint, but keeps on steadily, a few holes at
  a time, till in a little while the whole wainscoting is set with hidden
  diamonds, and every panel is apparently sound and whole."</p>

  <p>"But, then&mdash;there was only one such hole in the whole lot."</p>

  <p>Just so, and that very circumstance tells us the whole truth. Let me tell
  the story first&mdash;I'll explain the clue after. The diamonds lie hidden
  for a few months&mdash;he grows impatient. He wants the money, and he can't
  see a way of getting it. At last he determines to make a bolt and go abroad
  to sell his plunder. He knows he will want money for expenses, and that he
  may not be able to get rid of his diamonds at once. He also expects that his
  suddenly going abroad while the robbery is still in people's minds will bring
  suspicion on him in any case, so, in for a penny in for a pound, he commits a
  bold forgery, which, had it been successful, would have put him in funds and
  enabled him to leave the country with the stones. But the forgery is
  detected, and he is haled to prison, leaving the diamonds in their wainscot
  setting.</p>

  <p>"Now we come to Gavin Kingscote. He must have been a shrewd
  fellow&mdash;the sort of man that good detectives are made of. Also he must
  have been pretty unscrupulous. He had his suspicions about the genuineness of
  the diamond robbery, and kept his eyes open. What indications he had to guide
  him we don't know, but living in the same house a sharp fellow on the
  look&mdash;out would probably see enough. At any rate, they led him to the
  belief that the diamonds were in the thief's rooms, but not among his
  movables, or they would have been found after the arrest. Here was his
  chance. Challitt was out of the way for years, and there was plenty of time
  to take the house to pieces if it were necessary. So he changed into
  Challitt's rooms.</p>

  <p>"How long it took him to find the stones we shall never know. He probably
  tried many other places first, and, I expect, found the diamonds at last by
  pricking over the panels with a needle. Then came the problem of getting them
  out without attracting attention. He decided not to trust to the needle,
  which might possibly leave a stone or two undiscovered, but to split up each
  panel carefully into splinters so as to leave no part unexamined. Therefore
  he took measurements, and had a number of panels made by a joiner of the
  exact size and pattern of those in the room, and announced to his landlady
  his intention of painting her panels with a pretty design. This to account
  for the wet paint, and even for the fact of a panel being out of the wall,
  should she chance to bounce into the room at an awkward moment. All very
  clever, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"Ah, he was a smart man, no doubt. Well, he went to work, taking out a
  panel, substituting a new one, painting it over, and chopping up the old one
  on the quiet, getting rid of the splinters out of doors when the booty had
  been extracted. The decoration progressed and the little heap of diamonds
  grew. Finally, he came to the last panel, but found that he had used all his
  new panels and hadn't one left for a substitute. It must have been at some
  time when it was difficult to get hold of the joiner&mdash;Bank Holiday,
  perhaps, or Sunday, and he was impatient. So he scraped the paint off, and
  went carefully over every part of the surface&mdash;experience had taught him
  by this that all the holes were of the same sort&mdash;and found one diamond.
  He took it out, refilled the hole with putty, painted the old panel and put
  it back. <i>These</i> are pieces of that old panel&mdash;the only old one of
  the lot.</p>

  <p>"Nine men out of ten would have got out of the house as soon as possible
  after the thing was done, but he was a cool hand and stayed. That made the
  whole thing look a deal more genuine than if he had unaccountably cleared out
  as soon as he had got his room nicely decorated. I expect the original
  capital for those Stock Exchange operations we heard of came out of those
  diamonds. He stayed as long as suited him, and left when he set up
  housekeeping with a view to his wedding. The rest of the story is pretty
  plain. You guess it, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "I think I can guess the rest, in a general sort of
  way&mdash;except as to one or two points."</p>

  <p>"It's all plain&mdash;perfectly. See here! Challitt, in gaol, determines
  to get those diamonds when he comes out. To do that without being suspected
  it will be necessary to hire the room. But he knows that he won't be able to
  do that himself, because the landlady, of course, knows him, and won't have
  an ex-convict in the house. There is no help for it; he must have a
  confederate, and share the spoil. So he makes the acquaintance of another
  convict, who seems a likely man for the job, and whose sentence expires about
  the same time as his own. When they come out, he arranges the matter with
  this confederate, who is a well-mannered (and pretty well-known)
  housebreaker, and the latter calls at Mrs Lamb's house to look for rooms. The
  very room itself happens to be to let, and of course it is taken, and
  Challitt (who is the invalid cousin) comes in at night muffled and
  unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>"The decoration on the panel does not alarm them, because, of course, they
  suppose it to have been done on the old panels and over the old paint.
  Challitt tries the spots where diamonds were left&mdash;there are
  none&mdash;there is no putty even. Perhaps, think they, the panels have been
  shifted and interchanged in the painting, so they set to work and split them
  all up as we have seen, getting more desperate as they go on. Finally they
  realize that they are done, and clear out, leaving Mrs Lamb to mourn over
  their mischief.</p>

  <p>"They know that Kingscote is the man who has forestalled them, because
  Gillard (or Jones), in his chat with the landlady, has heard all about him
  and his painting of the panels. So the next night they set off for Finchley.
  They get into Kingscote's garden and watch him let Campbell out. While he is
  gone, Challitt quietly steps through the French window into the smoking-room,
  and waits for him, Gillard remaining outside.</p>

  <p>"Kingscote returns, and Challitt accuses him of taking the stones.
  Kingscote is contemptuous&mdash;doesn't care for Challitt, because he knows
  he is powerless, being the original thief himself; besides, knows there is no
  evidence, since the diamonds are sold and dispersed long ago. Challitt offers
  to divide the plunder with him&mdash;Kingscote laughs and tells him to go;
  probably threatens to throw him out, Challitt being the smaller man. Gillard,
  at the open window, hears this, steps in behind, and quietly knocks him on
  the head. The rest follows as a matter of course. They fasten the window and
  shutters, to exclude observation; turn over all the drawers, etc., in case
  the jewels are there; go to the best bedroom and try there, and so on.
  Failing (and possibly being disturbed after a few hours' search by the noise
  of the acquisitive gardener), Gillard, with the instinct of an old thief,
  determines they shan't go away with nothing, so empties Kingscote's pockets
  and takes his watch and chain and so on. They go out by the front door and
  shut it after them. <i>Voil tout</i>."</p>

  <p>I was filled with wonder at the prompt ingenuity of the man who in these
  few hours of hurried inquiry could piece together so accurately all the
  materials of an intricate and mysterious affair such as this; but more, I
  wondered where and how he had collected those materials.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt, Hewitt," I said, "that the accurate and minute
  application of what you are pleased to call your common sense has become
  something very like an instinct with you. What did you deduce from? You told
  me your conclusions from the examination of Ivy Cottage, but not how you
  arrived at them."</p>

  <p>"They didn't leave me much material downstairs, did they? But in the
  bedroom, the two drawers which the thieves found locked were
  ransacked&mdash;opened probably with keys taken from the dead man. On the
  floor I saw a bent French nail; here it is. You see, it is twice bent at
  right angles, near the head and near the point, and there is the faint mark
  of the pliers that were used to bend it. It is a very usual burglars' tool,
  and handy in experienced hands to open ordinary drawer locks. Therefore, I
  knew that a professional burglar had been at work. He had probably fiddled at
  the drawers with the nail first, and then had thrown it down to try the dead
  man's keys.</p>

  <p>"But I knew this professional burglar didn't come for a burglary, from
  several indications. There was no attempt to take plate, the first thing a
  burglar looks for. Valuable clocks were left on mantelpieces, and other
  things that usually go in an ordinary burglary were not disturbed. Notably,
  it was to be observed that no doors or windows were broken, or had been
  forcibly opened; therefore, it was plain that the thieves had come in by the
  French window of the smoking-room, the only entrance left open at the last
  thing. <i>Therefore</i>, they came in, or one did, knowing that Mr Kingscote
  was up, and being quite willing&mdash;presumably anxious&mdash;to see him.
  Ordinary burglars would have waited till he had retired, and then could have
  got through the closed French window as easily almost as if it were open,
  notwithstanding the thin wooden shutters, which would never stop a burglar
  for more than five minutes. Being anxious to see him, they&mdash;or again,
  one of them&mdash;presumably knew him. That they had come to get something
  was plain, from the ransacking. As, in the end, they <i>did</i> steal his
  money and watch, but did not take larger valuables, it was plain that they
  had no bag with them&mdash;which proves not only that they had not come to
  burgle, for every burglar takes his bag, but that the thing they came to get
  was not bulky. Still, they could easily have removed plate or clocks by
  rolling them up in a table-cover or other wrapper, but such a bundle, carried
  by well&mdash;dressed men, would attract attention&mdash;therefore it was
  probable that they were well dressed. Do I make it clear?"</p>

  <p>"Quite&mdash;nothing seems simpler now it is explained&mdash;that's the
  way with difficult puzzles."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing more to be got at the house. I had already in my mind
  the curious coincidence that the panels at Chelsea had been broken the very
  night before that of the murder, and determined to look at them in any case.
  I got from you the name of the man who had lived in the panelled room before
  Kingscote, and at once remembered it (although I said nothing about it) as
  that of the young man who had been chloroformed for his employer's diamonds.
  I keep things of that sort in my mind, you see&mdash;and, indeed, in my
  scrap-book. You told me yourself about his imprisonment, and there I was with
  what seemed now a hopeful case getting into a promising shape.</p>

  <p>"You went on to prevent any setting to rights at Chelsea, and I made
  enquiries as to Challitt. I found he had been released only a few days before
  all this trouble arose, and I also found the name of another man who was
  released from the same establishment only a few days earlier. I knew this man
  (Gillard) well, and knew that nobody was a more likely rascal for such a
  crime as that at Finchley. On my way to Chelsea I called at my office, gave
  my clerk certain instructions, and looked up my scrap-book. I found the
  newspaper account of the chloroform business, and also a photograph of
  Gillard&mdash;I keep as many of these things as I can collect. What I did at
  Chelsea you know. I saw that one panel was of old wood and the rest new. I
  saw the hole in the old panel, and I asked one or two questions. The case was
  complete."</p>

  <p>We proceeded with our dinner. Presently I said: "It all rests with the
  police now, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I should think it very probable that Challitt and Gillard will
  be caught. Gillard, at any rate, is pretty well known. It will be rather hard
  on the surviving Kingscote, after engaging me, to have his dead brother's
  diamond transactions publicly exposed as a result, won't it? But it can't be
  helped. <i>Fiat justitia</i>, of course."</p>

  <p>"How will the police feel over this?" I asked. "You've rather cut them
  out, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the police are all right. They had not the information I had, you
  see; they knew nothing of the panel business. If Mrs Lamb had gone to
  Scotland Yard instead of to the policeman on the beat, perhaps I should never
  have been sent for."</p>

  <p>The same quality that caused Martin Hewitt to rank as mere "common-sense"
  his extraordinary power of almost instinctive deduction, kept his respect for
  the abilities of the police at perhaps a higher level than some might have
  considered justified.</p>

  <p>We sat some little while over our dessert, talking as we sat, when there
  occurred one of those curious conjunctions of circumstances that we notice
  again and again in ordinary life, and forget as often, unless the importance
  of the occasion fixes the matter in the memory. A young man had entered the
  dining-room, and had taken his seat at a corner table near the back window.
  He had been sitting there for some little time before I particularly observed
  him. At last he happened to turn his thin, pale face in my direction, and our
  eyes met. It was Challitt&mdash;the man we had been talking of!</p>

  <p>I sprang to my feet in some excitement.</p>

  <p>"That's the man!" I cried. "Challitt!"</p>

  <p>Hewitt rose at my words, and at first attempted to pull me back. Challitt,
  in guilty terror, saw that we were between him and the door, and turning,
  leaped upon the sill of the open window, and dropped out. There was a fearful
  crash of broken glass below, and everybody rushed to the window.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Hewitt drew me through the door, and we ran downstairs. "Pity you let out
  like that," he said, as he went. "If you'd kept quiet we could have sent out
  for the police with no trouble. Never mind&mdash;can't help it."</p>

  <p>Below, Challitt was lying in a broken heap in the midst of a crowd of
  waiters. He had crashed through a thick glass skylight and fallen, back
  downward, across the back of a lounge. He was taken away on a stretcher
  unconscious, and, in fact, died in a week in hospital from injuries to the
  spine.</p>

  <p>During his periods of consciousness he made a detailed statement, bearing
  out the conclusions of Martin Hewitt with the most surprising exactness, down
  to the smallest particulars. He and Gillard had parted immediately after the
  crime, judging it safer not to be seen together. He had, he affirmed, endured
  agonies of fear and remorse in the few days since the fatal night at
  Finchley, and had even once or twice thought of giving himself up. When I so
  excitedly pointed him out, he knew at once that the game was up, and took the
  one desperate chance of escape that offered. But to the end he persistently
  denied that he had himself committed the murder, or had even thought of it
  till he saw it accomplished. That had been wholly the work of Gillard, who,
  listening at the window and perceiving the drift of the conversation,
  suddenly beat down Kingscote from behind with a life-preserver.</p>

  <p>And so Harvey Challitt ended his life at the age of twenty-six.</p>

  <p>Gillard was never taken. He doubtless left the country, and has probably
  since that time become "known to the police" under another name abroad.
  Perhaps he has even been hanged, and if he has been, there was no miscarriage
  of justice, no matter what the charge against him may have been.</p>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE whole voyage was an unpleasant one, and Captain Mackrie,
  of the Anglo-Malay Company's steamship <i>Nicobar</i>, had at last some
  excuse for the ill-temper that had made him notorious and unpopular in the
  company's marine staff. Although the fourth and fifth mates in the seclusion
  of their berth ventured deeper in their search for motives, and opined that
  the "old man" had made a deal less out of this voyage than usual; the company
  having lately taken to providing its own stores; so that "makings" were gone
  clean and "cumshaw" (which means commission in the trading lingo of the China
  seas) had shrunk small indeed. In confirmation they adduced the uncommonly
  long face of the steward (the only man in the ship satisfied with the
  skipper), whom the new regulations hit with the same blow. But indeed the
  steward's dolor might well be credited to the short passenger list, and the
  unpromising aspect of the few passengers in the eyes of a man accustomed to
  gauge one's tip-yielding capacity a month in advance. For the steward it was
  altogether the wrong time of year, the wrong sort of voyage, and certainly
  the wrong sort of passengers. So that doubtless the confidential talk of the
  fourth and fifth officers was mere youthful scandal. At any rate, the captain
  had prospect of a good deal in private trade home, for he had been taking
  curiosities and Japanese oddments aboard (plainly for sale in London) in a
  way that a third steward would have been ashamed of, and which, for a
  captain, was a scandal and an ignominy; and he had taken pains to insure well
  for the lot. These things the fourth and fifth mates often spoke of, and more
  than once made a winking allusion to, in the presence of the third mate and
  the chief engineer, who laughed and winked too, and sometimes said as much to
  the second mate, who winked without laughing; for of such is the
  tittle-tattle of shipboard.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nicobar</i> was bound home with few passengers, as I have said, a
  small general cargo, and gold bullion to the value of 200,000&mdash;the
  bullion to be landed at Plymouth, as usual. The presence of this bullion was
  a source of much conspicuous worry on the part of the second officer, who had
  charge of the bullion-room. For this was his first voyage on his promotion
  from third officer, and the charge of 200,000 worth of gold bars was a thing
  he had not been accustomed to. The placid first officer pointed out to him
  that this wasn't the first shipment of bullion the world had ever known, by a
  long way, nor the largest. Also that every usual precaution was taken, and
  the keys were in the captain's cabin; so that he might reasonably be as easy
  in his mind as the few thousand other second officers who had had charge of
  hatches and special cargo since the world began. But this did not comfort
  Brasyer. He fidgeted about when off watch, considering and puzzling out the
  various means by which the bullion-room might be got at, and fidgeted more
  when on watch, lest somebody might be at that moment putting into practice
  the ingenious dodges he had thought of. And he didn't keep his fears and
  speculations to himself. He bothered the first officer with them, and when
  the first officer escaped he explained the whole thing at length to the third
  officer.</p>

  <p>"Can't think what the company's about," he said on one such occasion to
  the first mate, "calling a tin-pot bunker like that a bullion-room."</p>

  <p>"Skittles!" responded the first mate, and went on smoking.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all very well for you who aren't responsible," Brasyer went
  on, "but I'm pretty sure something will happen some day; if not on this
  voyage on some other. Talk about a strong room! Why, what's it made of?"</p>

  <p>"Three-eighths boiler plate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, three-eighths boilerplate&mdash;about as good as a sixpenny tin
  money box. Why, I'd get through that with my grandmother's scissors!"</p>

  <p>"All right; borrow 'em and get through. <i>I</i> would if I had a
  grandmother."</p>

  <p>"There it is down below there out of sight and hearing, nice and handy for
  anybody who likes to put in a quiet hour at plate cutting from the coal
  bunker next door&mdash;always empty, because it's only a seven-ton bunker,
  not worth trimming. And the other side's against the steward's pantry. What's
  to prevent a man shipping as steward, getting quietly through while he's
  supposed to be bucketing about among his slops and his crockery, and
  strolling away with the plunder at the next port? And then there's the
  carpenter. <i>He's</i> always messing about somewhere below, with a bag full
  of tools. Nothing easier than for him to make a job in a quiet corner, and
  get through the plates."</p>

  <p>"But then what's he to do with the stuff when he's got it? You can't take
  gold ashore by the hundredweight in your boots."</p>

  <p>"Do with it. Why, dump it, of course. Dump it overboard in a quiet port
  and mark the spot. Come to that, he could desert clean at Port
  Said&mdash;what easier place?&mdash;and take all he wanted. You know what
  Port Said's like. Then there are the firemen&mdash;oh, <i>anybody</i> can do
  it!" And Brasyer moved off to take another peep under the hatchway.</p>

  <p>The door of the bullion-room was fastened by one central patent lock and
  two padlocks, one above and one below the other lock. A day or two after the
  conversation recorded above, Brasyer was carefully examining and trying the
  lower of the padlocks with a key, when a voice immediately behind him asked
  sharply, "Well, sir, and what are you up to with that padlock?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic8B"
     name="pic8B"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-2-1B.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Brasyer started violently and looked round. It was Captain Mackrie.</p>

  <p>"There's&mdash;that is&mdash;I'm afraid these are the same sort of
  padlocks as those in the carpenter's stores," the second mate replied, in a
  hurry of explanation. "I&mdash;I was just trying, that's all; I'm afraid the
  keys fit."</p>

  <p>"Just you let the carpenter take care of his own stores, will you, Mr.
  Brasyer? There's a Chubb's lock there as well as the padlocks, and the key of
  that's in my cabin, and I'll take care doesn't go out of it without my
  knowledge. So perhaps you'd best leave off experiments till you're asked to
  make 'em, for your own sake. That's enough now," the captain added, as
  Brasyer appeared to be ready to reply; and he turned on his heel and made for
  the steward's quarters.</p>

  <p>Brasyer stared after him ragefully. "Wonder what <i>you</i> want down
  here," he muttered under his breath. "Seems to me one doesn't often see a
  skipper as thick with the steward as that." And he turned off growling
  towards the deck above.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I like that steward's pantry stuck against the side of the
  bullion-room," he said later in the day to the first officer. "And what does
  a steward want with a lot of boiler-maker's tools aboard? You know he's got
  them."</p>

  <p>"In the name of the prophet, rats!" answered the first mate, who was of a
  less fussy disposition. "What a fatiguing creature you are, Brasyer! Don't
  you know the man's a boiler-maker by regular trade, and has only taken to
  stewardship for the last year or two? That sort of man doesn't like parting
  with his tools, and as he's a widower, with no home ashore, of course he has
  to carry all his traps aboard. Do shut up, and take your proper rest like a
  Christian. Here, I'll give you a cigar; it's all right&mdash;Burman; stick it
  in your mouth, and keep your jaw tight on it."</p>

  <p>But there was no soothing the second officer. Still he prowled about the
  after orlop deck, and talked at large of his anxiety for the contents of the
  bullion-room. Once again, a few days later, as he approached the iron door,
  he was startled by the appearance of the captain coming, this time,
  <i>from</i> the steward's pantry. He fancied he had heard tapping, Brasyer
  explained, and had come to investigate. But the captain turned him back with
  even less ceremony than before, swearing he would give charge of the
  bullion-room to another officer if Brasyer persisted in his eccentricities.
  On the first deck the second officer was met by the carpenter, a quiet,
  sleek, soft-spoken man, who asked him for the padlock and key he had borrowed
  from the stores during the week. But Brasyer put him off, promising to send
  it back later. And the carpenter trotted away to a job he happened to have,
  singularly enough, in the hold, just under the after orlop deck, and below
  the floor of the bullion-room.</p>

  <p>As I have said, the voyage was in no way a pleasant one. Everywhere the
  weather was at its worst, and scarce was Gibraltar passed before the Lascars
  were shivering in their cotton trousers, and the Seedee boys were buttoning
  tight such old tweed jackets as they might muster from their scanty kits. It
  was January. In the Bay the weather was tremendous, and the <i>Nicobar</i>
  banged and shook and pitched distractedly across in a howling world of
  thunderous green sea, washed within and without, above and below. Then, in
  the Chops, as night fell, something went, and there was no more steerageway,
  nor, indeed, anything else but an aimless wallowing. The screw had
  broken.</p>

  <p>The high sea had abated in some degree, but it was still bad. Such sail as
  the steamer carried, inadequate enough, was set, and shift was made somehow
  to worry along to Plymouth&mdash;or to Falmouth if occasion better
  served&mdash;by that means. And so the <i>Nicobar</i> beat across the Channel
  on a rather better, though anything but smooth, sea, in a black night, made
  thicker by a storm of sleet, which turned gradually to snow as the hours
  advanced.</p>

  <p>The ship laboured slowly ahead, through a universal blackness that seemed
  to stifle. Nothing but a black void above, below, and around, and the sound
  of wind and sea; so that one coming before a deck-light was startled by the
  quiet advent of the large snowflakes that came like moths as it seemed from
  nowhere. At four bells&mdash;two in the morning&mdash;a foggy light appeared
  away on the starboard bow&mdash;it was the Eddystone light&mdash;and an hour
  or two later, the exact whereabouts of the ship being a thing of much
  uncertainty, it was judged best to lay her to till daylight. No order had yet
  been given, however, when suddenly there were dim lights over the port
  quarter, with a more solid blackness beneath them. Then a shout and a
  thunderous crash, and the whole ship shuddered, and in ten seconds had
  belched up every living soul from below. The <i>Nicobar's</i> voyage was
  over&mdash;it was a collision.</p>

  <p>The stranger backed off into the dark, and the two vessels drifted apart,
  though not till some from the <i>Nicobar</i> had jumped aboard the other.
  Captain Mackrie's presence of mind was wonderful, and never for a moment did
  he lose absolute command of every soul on board. The ship had already begun
  to settle down by the stern and list to port. Life-belts were served out
  promptly. Fortunately there were but two women among the passengers, and no
  children. The boats were lowered without a mishap, and presently two strange
  boats came as near as they dare from the ship (a large coasting steamer, it
  afterwards appeared) that had cut into the <i>Nicobar</i>. The last of the
  passengers were being got off safely, when Brayser, running anxiously to the
  captain, said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Can't do anything with that bullion, can we, sir? Perhaps a box or
  two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn the bullion!" shouted Captain Mackrie. "Look after the boat,
  sir, and get the passengers off. The insurance companies can find the bullion
  for themselves."</p>

  <p>But Brasyer had vanished at the skipper's first sentence. The skipper
  turned aside to the steward as the crew and engine-room staff made for the
  remaining boats, and the two spoke quietly together. Presently the steward
  turned away as if to execute an order, and the skipper continued in a louder
  tone:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They're the likeliest stuff, and we can but drop 'em, at worst. But be
  slippy&mdash;she won't last ten minutes."</p>

  <p>She lasted nearly a quarter of an hour. By that time, however, everybody
  was clear of her, and the captain in the last boat was only just near enough
  to see the last of her lights as she went down.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">THE day broke in a sulky grey, and there lay the
  <i>Nicobar</i>, in ten fathoms, not a mile from the shore, her topmasts
  forlornly visible above the boisterous water. The sea was rough all that day,
  but the snow had ceased, and during the night the weather calmed
  considerably. Next day Lloyd's agent was steaming about in a launch from
  Plymouth, and soon a salvage company's tug came up and lay to by the emerging
  masts. There was every chance of raising the ship as far as could be seen,
  and a diver went down from the salvage tug to measure the breach made in the
  <i>Nicobar's</i> side, in order that the necessary oak planking or sheeting
  might be got ready for covering the hole, preparatory to pumping and raising.
  This was done in a very short time, and the necessary telegrams having been
  sent, the tug remained in its place through the night, and prepared for the
  sending down of several divers on the morrow to get out the bullion as a
  commencement.</p>

  <p>Just at this time Martin Hewitt happened to be engaged on a case of some
  importance and delicacy on behalf of Lloyd's Committee, and was staying for a
  few days at Plymouth. He heard the story of the wreck, of course, and
  speaking casually with Lloyd's agent as to the salvage work just beginning,
  he was told the name of the salvage company's representative on the tug, Mr.
  Percy Merrick&mdash;a name he immediately recognised as that of an old
  acquaintance of his own. So that on the day when the divers were at work in
  the bullion-room of the sunken <i>Nicobar</i>, Hewitt gave himself a holiday,
  and went aboard the tug about noon.</p>

  <p>Here he found Merrick, a big, pleasant man of thirty-eight or so. He was
  very glad to see Hewitt, but was a great deal puzzled as to the results of
  the morning's work on the wreck. Two cases of gold bars were missing.</p>

  <p>"There was 200,000 worth of bullion on board," he said, "that's plain and
  certain. It was packed in forty cases, each of 5,000 value. But now there
  are only thirty-eight cases! Two are gone clearly. I wonder what's
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose your men don't know anything about it?" asked Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"No, they're all right. You see, it's impossible for them to bring
  anything up without its being observed, especially as they have to be
  unscrewed from their diving-dresses here on deck. Besides, bless you, I was
  down with them."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Do you dive yourself, then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I put the dress on sometimes, you know, for any such special
  occasion as this. I went down this morning. There was no difficulty in
  getting about on the vessel below, and I found the keys of the bullion-room
  just where the captain said I would, in his cabin. But the locks were
  useless, of course, after being a couple of days in salt water. So we just
  burgled the door with crowbars, and then we saw that we might have done it a
  bit more easily from outside. For that coasting-steamer cut clean into the
  bunker next the bullion-room, and ripped open the sheet of boiler-plate
  dividing them."</p>

  <p>"The two missing cases couldn't have dropped out that way, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. We looked, of course, but it would have been impossible. The
  vessel has a list the other way&mdash;to starboard&mdash;and the piled cases
  didn't reach as high as the torn part. Well, as I said, we burgled the door,
  and there they were, thirty-eight sealed bullion cases, neither more nor
  less, and they're down below in the after-cabin at this moment. Come and
  see."</p>

  <p>Thirty-eight they were; pine cases bound with hoop-iron and sealed at
  every joint, each case about eighteen inches by a foot, and six inches deep.
  They were corded together, two and two, apparently for convenience of
  transport.</p>

  <p>"Did you cord them like this yourself?" asked Hewitt.</p>

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"No, that's how we found 'em. We just hooked 'em on a block and tackle,
  the pair at a time, and they hauled 'em up here aboard the tug."</p>

  <p>"What have you done about the missing two&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"Wired off to headquarters, of course, at once. And I've sent for Captain
  Mackrie&mdash;he's still in the neighbourhood, I believe&mdash;and Brasyer,
  the second officer, who had charge of the bullion-room. They may possibly
  know something. Anyway, one thing's plain. There were forty cases at the
  beginning of the voyage, and now there are only thirty-eight."</p>

  <p>There was a pause; and then Merrick added, "By the bye, Hewitt, this is
  rather your line, isn't it? You ought to look up these two cases."</p>

  <p>Hewitt laughed. "All right," he said; "I'll begin this minute if you'll
  commission me."</p>

  <p>"Well," Merrick replied slowly, "of course I can't do that without
  authority from headquarters. But if you've nothing to do for an hour or so
  there is no harm in putting on your considering cap, is there? Although, of
  course, there's nothing to go upon as yet. But you might listen to what
  Mackrie and Brasyer have to say. Of course I don't know, but as it's a
  10,000 question probably it might pay you, and if you <i>do</i> see your way
  to anything I'd wire and get you Commissioned at once."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door and Captain Mackrie entered. "Mr. Merrick?" he
  said interrogatively, looking from one to another.</p>

  <p>"That's myself, sir," answered Merrick.</p>

  <p>"I'm Captain Mackrie, of the <i>Nicobar</i>. You sent for me, I believe.
  Something wrong with the bullion I'm told, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Merrick explained matters fully. "I thought perhaps you might be able to
  help us, Captain Mackrie. Perhaps I have been wrongly informed as to the
  number of cases that should have been there?"</p>

  <p>"No; there were forty right enough. I think though&mdash;perhaps I might
  be able to give you a sort of hint "&mdash;and Captain Mackrie looked hard at
  Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Hewitt, Captain Mackrie," Merrick interposed. "You may speak
  as freely as you please before him. In fact, he's sort of working on the
  business, so to speak."</p>

  <p>"Well," Mackrie said, "if that's so, speaking between ourselves, I should
  advise you to turn your attention to Brasyer. He was my second officer, you
  know, and had charge of the stuff."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," Hewitt asked, "that Mr. Brasyer might give us some useful
  information?"</p>

  <p>Mackrie gave an ugly grin. "Very likely he might," he said, "if he were
  fool enough. But I don't think you'd get much out of him direct. I meant you
  might watch him."</p>

  <p>"What, do you suppose he was concerned in any way with the disappearance
  of this gold?"</p>

  <p>"I should think&mdash;speaking, as I said before, in confidence and
  between ourselves&mdash;that it's very likely indeed. I didn't like his
  manner all through the voyage."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he was so eternally cracking on about his responsibility, and
  pretending to suspect the stokers and the carpenter, and one person and
  another, of trying to get at the bullion cases&mdash;that that alone was
  almost enough to make one suspicious. He protested so much, you see. He was
  so conscientious and diligent himself, and all the rest of it, and everybody
  else was such a desperate thief, and he was so sure there would be some of
  that bullion missing some day that&mdash;that&mdash;well, I don't know if I
  express his manner clearly, but I tell you I didn't like it a bit. But there
  was something more than that. He was eternally smelling about the place, and
  peeping in at the steward's pantry&mdash;which adjoins the bullion-room on
  one side, you know&mdash;and nosing about in the bunker on the other side.
  And once I actually caught him fitting keys to the padlocks&mdash;keys he'd
  borrowed from the carpenter's stores. And every time his excuse was that he
  fancied he heard somebody else trying to get in to the gold, or something of
  that sort; every time I caught him below on the orlop deck that was his
  excuse&mdash;happened to have heard something or suspected something or
  somebody every time. Whether or not I succeed in conveying my impressions to
  you, gentlemen, I can assure you that I regarded his whole manner and actions
  as very suspicious throughout the voyage, and I made up my mind I wouldn't
  forget it if by chance anything <i>did</i> turn out wrong. Well, it has, and
  now I've told you what I've observed. It's for you to see if it will lead you
  anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Just so," Hewitt answered. "But let me fully understand. Captain Mackrie.
  You say that Mr. Brasyer had charge of the bullion-room, but that he was
  trying keys on it from the carpenter's stores. Where were the legitimate keys
  then?"</p>

  <p>"In my cabin. They were only handed out when I knew what they were wanted
  for. There was a Chubb's lock between the two padlocks, but a duplicate
  wouldn't have been hard for Brasyer to get. He could easily have taken a wax
  impression of my key when he used it at the port where we took the bullion
  aboard."</p>

  <p>"Well, and suppose he had taken these boxes, where do you think he would
  keep them?"</p>

  <p>Mackrie shrugged his shoulders and smiled. "Impossible to say," he
  replied. "He might have hidden 'em somewhere on board, though I don't think
  that's likely. He'd have had a deuce of a job to land them at Plymouth, and
  would have had to leave them somewhere while he came on to London. Bullion is
  always landed at Plymouth, you know, and if any were found to be missing,
  then the ship would be overhauled at once, every inch of her; so that he'd
  have to get his plunder ashore somehow before the rest of the gold was
  unloaded&mdash;almost impossible. Of course, if he's done that it's somewhere
  below there now, but that isn't likely. He'd be much more likely to have
  'dumped' it&mdash;dropped it overboard at some well-known spot in a foreign
  port, where he could go later on and get it. So that you've a deal of scope
  for search, you see. Anywhere under water from here to Yokohama;" and Captain
  Mackrie laughed.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward he left, and as he was leaving a man knocked at the cabin
  door and looked in to say that Mr. Brasyer was on board. "You'll be able to
  have a go at him now," said the captain. "Good-day."</p>

  <p>"There's the steward of the <i>Nicobar</i> there too, sir," said the man
  after the captain had gone, "and the carpenter."</p>

  <p>"Very well, we'll see Mr. Brasyer first," said Merrick, and the man
  vanished. "It seems to have got about a bit," Merrick went on to Hewitt. "I
  only sent for Brasyer, but as these others have come, perhaps they've got
  something to tell us."</p>

  <p>Brasyer made his appearance, overflowing with information. He required
  little assurance to encourage him to speak openly before Hewitt, and he said
  again all he had so often said before on board the <i>Nicobar</i>. The
  bullion-room was a mere tin box, the whole thing was as easy to get at as
  anything could be, he didn't wonder in the least at the loss&mdash;he had
  prophesied it all along.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The men whose movements should be carefully watched, he said, were the
  captain and the steward. "Nobody ever heard of a captain and a steward being
  so thick together before," he said. "The steward's pantry was next against
  the bullion-room, you know, with nothing but that wretched bit of
  three-eighths boiler plate between. You wouldn't often expect to find the
  captain down in the steward's pantry, would you, thick as they might be.
  Well, that's where I used to find him, time and again. And the steward kept
  boiler-makers' tools there! That I can swear to. And he's been a
  boiler-maker, so that, likely as not, he could open a joint somewhere and
  patch it up again neatly so that it wouldn't be noticed. He was always
  messing about down there in his pantry, and once I distinctly heard knocking
  there, and when I went down to see, whom should I meet? Why, the skipper,
  coming away from the place himself, and he bully-ragged me for being there
  and sent me on deck. But before that he bully-ragged me because I had found
  out that there were other keys knocking about the place that fitted the
  padlocks on the bullion-room door. Why should he slang and threaten me for
  looking after these things and keeping my eye on the bullion-room, as was my
  duty? But that was the very thing that he didn't like. It was enough for him
  to see me anxious about the gold to make him furious. Of course his character
  for meanness and greed is known all through the company's service&mdash;he'll
  do anything to make a bit."</p>

  <p>"But have you any positive idea as to what has become of the gold?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Brasyer replied, with a rather knowing air, "I don't think they've
  dumped it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you think it's still in the vessel&mdash;hidden
  somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. I believe the captain and the steward took it ashore, one
  case each, when we came off in the boats."</p>

  <p>"But wouldn't that be noticed?"</p>

  <p>"It needn't be, on a black night like that. You see, the parcels are not
  so big&mdash;look at them, a foot by a foot and a half by six inches or so,
  roughly. Easily slipped under a big coat or covered up with anything. Of
  course they're a bit heavy&mdash;eighty or ninety pounds apiece
  altogether&mdash;but that's not much for a strong man to
  carry&mdash;especially in such a handy parcel, on a black night, with no end
  of confusion on. Now you just look here&mdash;I'll tell you something. The
  skipper went ashore last in a boat that was sent out by the coasting steamer
  that ran into us. That ship's put into dock for repairs and her crew are
  mostly having an easy time ashore. Now I haven't been asleep this last day or
  two, and I had a sort of notion there might be some game of this sort on,
  because when I left the ship that night I thought we might save a little at
  least of the stuff, but the skipper wouldn't let me go near the bullion-room,
  and that seemed odd. So I got hold of one of the boat's crew that fetched the
  skipper ashore, and questioned him quietly&mdash;pumped him, you
  know&mdash;and he assures me that the skipper <i>did</i> have a rather small,
  heavy sort of parcel with him. What do you think of that? Of course, in the
  circumstances, the man couldn't remember any very distinct particulars, but
  he thought it was a sort of square wooden case about the size I've mentioned.
  But there's something more." Brasyer lifted his forefinger and then brought
  it down on the table before him&mdash;"something more. I've made inquiries at
  the railway station and I find that two heavy parcels were sent off yesterday
  to London&mdash;deal boxes wrapped in brown paper, of just about the right
  size. And the paper got torn before the things were sent off, and the clerk
  could see that the boxes inside were fastened with hoop-iron&mdash;like
  those!" and the second officer pointed triumphantly to the boxes piled at one
  side of the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Well done!" said Hewitt. "You're quite a smart detective. Did you find
  out who brought the parcels, and who they were addressed to?"</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't get quite as far as that. Of course the clerk didn't know
  the names of the senders, and not knowing me, wouldn't tell me exactly where
  the parcels were going. But I got quite chummy with him after a bit, and I'm
  going to meet him presently&mdash;he has the afternoon off, and we're going
  for a stroll. I'll find something more, I'll bet you!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Hewitt, "find all you can&mdash;it may be very
  important. If you get any valuable information you'll let us know at once, of
  course. Anything else, now?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so; but I think what I've told you is pretty well
  enough for the present, eh? I'll let you know some more soon."</p>

  <p>Brasyer went, and Norton, the steward of the old ship, was brought into
  the cabin. He was a sharp-eyed, rather cadaverous-looking man, and he spoke
  with sepulchral hollowness. He had heard, he said, that there was something
  wrong with the chests of bullion, and came on board to give any information
  he could. It wasn't much, he went on to say, but the smallest thing might
  help. If he might speak strictly confidentially he would suggest that
  observation be kept on Wickens, the carpenter. He (Norton) didn't want to be
  uncharitable, but his pantry happened to be next the bullion-room, and he had
  heard Wickens at work for a very long time just below&mdash;on the under side
  of the floor of the bullion-room, it seemed to him, although, of course, he
  might have been mistaken. Still, it was very odd that the carpenter always
  seemed to have a job just at that spot. More, it had been said&mdash;and he
  (Norton) believed it to be true&mdash;that Wickens, the carpenter, had in his
  possession, and kept among his stores, keys that fitted the padlocks on the
  bullion-room door. That, it seemed to him, was a very suspicious
  circumstance. He didn't know anything more definite, but offered his ideas
  for what they were worth, and if his suspicions proved unfounded nobody would
  be more pleased than himself. But&mdash;but&mdash;and the steward shook his
  head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Norton," said Merrick, with a twinkle in his eye; "we
  won't forget what you say. Of course, if the stuff is found in consequence of
  any of your information, you won't lose by it."</p>

  <p>The steward said he hoped not, and he wouldn't fail to keep his eye on the
  carpenter. He had noticed Wickens was in the tug, and he trusted that if they
  were going to question him they would do it cautiously, so as not to put him
  on his guard. Merrick promised they would.</p>

  <p>"By the bye, Mr. Norton," asked Hewitt, "supposing your suspicions to be
  justified, what do you suppose the carpenter would do with the bullion?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," replied Norton, "I don't think he'd keep it on the ship. He'd
  probably dump it somewhere."</p>

  <p>The steward left, and Merrick lay back in his chair and guffawed aloud.
  "This grows farcical," he said, "simply farcical. What a happy family they
  must have been aboard the <i>Nicobar</i>! And now here's the captain watching
  the second officer, and the second officer watching the captain and the
  steward, and the steward watching the carpenter! It's immense. And now we're
  going to see the carpenter. Wonder whom he suspects?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt said nothing, but his eyes twinkled with intense merriment, and
  presently the carpenter was brought into the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Good-day to you, gentlemen," said the carpenter in a soft and deferential
  voice, looking from one to the other. "Might I 'ave the honour of addressin'
  the salvage gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Merrick answered, motioning him to a seat. "This is the
  salvage shop, Mr. Wickens. What can we do for you?"</p>

  <p>The carpenter coughed gently behind his hand. "I took the liberty of
  comin', gentlemen, consekins o' 'earin' as there was some bullion missin'.
  P'raps I'm wrong."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. We haven't found as much as we expected, and I suppose by
  this time nearly everybody knows it. There are two cases wanting. You can't
  tell us where they are, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, as to that&mdash;no. I fear I can't exactly go as far as that.
  But if I am able to give vallable information as may lead to recovery of
  same, I presoom I may without offence look for some reasonable small
  recognition of my services?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," answered Merrick, "that'll be all right, I promise you. The
  company will do the handsome thing, of course, and no doubt so will the
  underwriters."</p>

  <p>"Presoomin' I may take that as a promise&mdash;among gentlemen
  "&mdash;this with an emphasis&mdash;"I'm willing to tell something."</p>

  <p>"It's a promise, at any rate as far as the company's concerned," returned
  Merrick. "I'll see it's made worth your while&mdash;of course, providing it
  leads to anything."</p>

  <p>"Purvidin' that, sir, o' course. Well, gentlemen, my story ain't a long
  one. All I've to say was what I 'card on board, just before she went down.
  The passengers was off, and the crew was gettin' into the other boats when
  the skipper turns to the steward an' speaks to him quiet-like, not observin',
  gentlemen, as I was agin 'is elbow, so for to say. ''Ere, Norton,' 'e sez, or
  words to that effeck, 'why shouldn't we try gettin' them things ashore with
  us&mdash;you know, the cases&mdash;eh? I've a notion we're pretty close
  inshore,' 'e sez, 'and there's nothink of a sea now. You take one, anyway,
  and I'll try the other,' 'e says, 'but don't make a flourish.' Then he sez,
  louder, 'cos o' the steward goin' off, 'They're the likeliest stuff, and at
  worst we can but drop 'em. But look sharp,' 'e says. So then I gets into the
  nearest boat, and that's all I 'eard."</p>

  <p>"That was all?" asked Hewitt, watching the man's face sharply.</p>

  <p>"All?" the carpenter answered with some surprise. "Yes, that was all; but
  I think it's pretty well enough, don't you? It's plain enough what was
  meant&mdash;him and the steward was to take two cases, one apiece, on the
  quiet, and they was the likeliest stuff aboard, as he said himself. And now
  there's two cases o' bullion missin'. Ain't that enough?"</p>

  <p>The carpenter was not satisfied till an exact note had been made of the
  captain's words. Then after Merrick's promise on behalf of the company had
  been renewed, Wickens took himself off.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Merrick, grinning across the table at Hewitt, "this is a
  queer go, isn't it? What that man says makes the skipper's case look pretty
  fishy, doesn't it? What he says, and what Brasyer says, taken together, makes
  a pretty strong case&mdash;I should say makes the thing a certainty. But what
  a business! It's likely to be a bit serious for some one, but it's a rare
  joke in a way. Wonder if Brasyer will find out anything more? Pity the
  skipper and steward didn't agree as to whom they should pretend to suspect.
  <i>That's</i> a mistake on their part."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Hewitt replied. "<i>If</i> they are conspiring, and know
  what they're about, they will avoid seeming to be both in a tale. The bullion
  is in bars, I understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, five bars in each case; weight, I believe, sixteen pounds to a
  bar."</p>

  <p>"Let me see," Hewitt went on, as he looked at his watch; "it is now nearly
  two o'clock. I must think over these things if I am to do anything in the
  case. In the meantime, if it could be managed, I should like enormously to
  have a turn under water in a diving-dress. I have always had a curiosity to
  see under the sea. Could it be managed now?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Merrick responded, "there's not much fun in it, I can assure you;
  and it's none the pleasanter in this weather. You'd better have a try later
  in the year if you really want to&mdash;unless you think you can learn
  anything about this business by smelling about on the <i>Nicobar</i> down
  below?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I <i>might</i> spot something," he said; "one never knows. And if I do
  anything in a case I always make it a rule to see and hear everything that
  can possibly be seen or heard, important or not. Clues lie where least
  expected. But beyond that, probably I may never have another chance of a
  little experience in a diving-dress. So if it can be managed I'd be
  glad."</p>

  <p>"Very well, you shall go, if you say so. And since it's your first
  venture, I'll come down with you myself. The men are all ashore, I think, or
  most of them. Come along."</p>

  <p>Hewitt was put in woollens and then in indiarubbers. A leaden-soled boot
  of twenty pounds' weight was strapped on each foot, and weights were hung on
  his back and chest.</p>

  <p>"That's the dress that Gullen usually has," Merrick remarked. "He's a very
  smart fellow; we usually send him first to make measurements and so on. An
  excellent man, but a bit too fond of the diver's lotion."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Hewitt.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you shall try some if you like, afterwards. It's a bit too heavy for
  me; rum and gin mixed, I think."</p>

  <p>A red nightcap was placed on Martin Hewitt's head, and after that a copper
  helmet, secured by a short turn in the segmental screw joint at the neck. In
  the end he felt a vast difficulty in moving at all. Merrick had been meantime
  invested with a similar rig-out, and then each was provided with a
  communication cord and an incandescent electric lamp. Finally, the front
  window was screwed on each helmet, and all was ready.</p>

  <p>Merrick went first over the ladder at the side, and Hewitt with much
  difficulty followed. As the water closed over his head, his sensations
  altered considerably. There was less weight to carry; his arms in particular
  felt light, though slow in motion. Down, down they went slowly, and all round
  about it was fairly light, but once on the sunken vessel and among the lower
  decks, the electric lamps were necessary enough. Once or twice Merrick spoke,
  laying his helmet against Hewitt's for the purpose, and instructing him to
  keep his air-pipe, life-line, and lamp connection from fouling something at
  every step. Here and there shadowy swimming shapes came out of the gloom,
  attracted by their lamps, to dart into obscurity again with a twist of the
  tail. The fishes were exploring the <i>Nicobar</i>. The hatchway of the lower
  deck was open, and down this they passed to the orlop deck. A little way
  along this they came to a door standing open, with a broken lock hanging to
  it. It was the door of the bullion-room, which had been forced by the divers
  in the morning.</p>

  <p>Merrick indicated by signs how the cases had been found piled on the
  floor. One of the sides of the room of thin steel was torn and thrust in the
  length of its whole upper half, and when they backed out of the room and
  passed the open door they stood in the great breach made by the bow of the
  strange coasting vessel. Steel, iron, wood, and everything stood in rents and
  splinters, and through the great gap they looked out into the immeasurable
  ocean. Hewitt put up his hand and felt the edge of the bullion-room partition
  where it had been torn. It was just such a tear as might have been made in
  cardboard.</p>

  <p>They regained the upper deck, and Hewitt, placing his helmet against his
  companion's, told him that he meant to have a short walk on the ocean bed. He
  took to the ladder again, where it lay over the side, and Merrick followed
  him.</p>

  <p>The bottom was of that tough, slimy sort of clay-rock that is found in
  many places about our coasts, and was dotted here and there with lumps of
  harder rock and clumps of curious weed. The two divers turned at the bottom
  of the ladder, walked a few steps, and looked up at the great hole in the
  <i>Nicobar's</i> side. Seen from here it was a fearful chasm, laying open
  hold, orlop, and lower deck.</p>

  <p>Hewitt turned away, and began walking about. Once or twice he stood and
  looked thoughtfully at the ground he stood on, which was fairly flat. He
  turned over with his foot a whitish, clean-looking stone about as large as a
  loaf. Then he wandered on slowly, once or twice stopping to examine the rock
  beneath him, and presently stooped to look at another stone nearly as large
  as the other, weedy on one side only, standing on the edge of a cavity in the
  claystone. He pushed the stone into the hole, which it filled, and then he
  stood up.</p>

  <p>Merrick put his helmet against Hewitt's, and shouted&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Satisfied now? Seen enough of the bottom?"</p>

  <p>"In a moment!" Hewitt shouted back; and he straightway began striding out
  in the direction of the ship. Arrived at the bows, he turned back to the
  point he started from, striding off again from there to the white stone he
  had kicked over, and from there to the vessel's side again. Merrick watched
  him in intense amazement, and hurried, as well as he might, after the light
  of Hewitt's lamp. Arrived for the second time at the bows of the ship, Hewitt
  turned and made his way along the side to the ladder, and forthwith ascended,
  followed by Merrick. There was no halt at the deck this time, and the two
  made there way up and up into the lighter water above, and so to the world of
  air.</p>

  <p>On the tug, as the men were unscrewing them from there waterproof prisons,
  Merrick asked Hewitt&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Will you try the 'lotion' now?"</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt replied, "I won't go quite so far as that. But I <i>will</i>
  have a little whisky, if you've any in the cabin. And give me a pencil and a
  piece of paper."</p>

  <p>These things were brought, and on the paper Martin Hewitt immediately
  wrote a few figures and kept it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I might easily forget those figures," he observed.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"
     name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Merrick wondered, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>Once more comfortably in the cabin, and clad in his usual garments, Hewitt
  asked if Merrick could produce a chart of the parts thereabout.</p>

  <p>"Here you are," was the reply, "coast and all. Big enough, isn't it? I've
  already marked the position of the wreck on it in pencil. She lies pointing
  north by east as nearly exact as anything."</p>

  <p>"As you've begun it," said Hewitt, "I shall take the liberty of making a
  few more pencil marks on this." And with that he spread out the crumpled note
  of figures, and began much ciphering and measuring. Presently he marked
  certain points on a spare piece of paper, and drew through them two lines
  forming an angle. This angle he transferred to the chart, and, placing a
  ruler over one leg of the angle, lengthened it out till it met the
  coast-line.</p>

  <p>"There we are," he said musingly. "And the nearest village to that is
  Lostella&mdash;indeed, the only coast village in that neighbourhood." He
  rose. "Bring me the sharpest-eyed person on board," he said; "that is, if he
  were here all day yesterday."</p>

  <p>"But what's up? What's all this mathematical business over? Going to find
  that bullion by rule of three?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt laughed. "Yes, perhaps," he said, "but Where's your sharp look-out?
  I want somebody who can tell me everything that was visible from the deck of
  this tug all day yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Well, really I believe the very sharpest chap is the boy. He's most
  annoyingly observant sometimes. I'll send for him."</p>

  <p>He came&mdash;a bright, snub-nosed, impudent-looking young ruffian.</p>

  <p>"See here, my boy," said Merrick, "polish up your wits and tell this
  gentleman what he asks."</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said Hewitt, "no doubt you saw various pieces of wreckage
  floating about?"</p>

  <p>"Yessir."</p>

  <p>"What were they?"</p>

  <p>"Hatch-gratings mostly&mdash;nothin' much else. There's some knockin'
  about now."</p>

  <p>"I saw them. Now, remember. Did you set a hatch-grating floating yesterday
  that was different from the others? A painted one, for instance&mdash;those
  out there now are not painted, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yessir, I see a little white 'un painted, bobbin' about away beyond the
  foremast of the <i>Nicobar</i>."</p>

  <p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"Certain sure, sir&mdash;it was the only painted thing floatin'. And
  to-day it's washed away somewheres."</p>

  <p>"So I noticed. You're a smart lad. Here's a shilling for you&mdash;keep
  your eyes open and perhaps you'll find a good many more shillings before
  you're an old man. That's all."</p>

  <p>The boy disappeared, and Hewitt turned to Merrick and said, "I think you
  may as well send that wire you spoke of. If I get the commission I think I
  may recover that bullion. It may take some little time, or, on the other
  hand, it may not. If you'll write the telegram at once, I'll go in the same
  boat as the messenger. I'm going to take a walk down to Lostella
  now&mdash;it's only two or three miles along the coast, but it will soon be
  getting dark."</p>

  <p>"But what sort of a clue have you got? I didn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," replied Hewitt, with a chuckle. "Officially, you know, I've
  no right to a clue just yet&mdash;I'm not commissioned. When I am I'll tell
  you everything."</p>

  <p>Hewitt was scarcely ashore when he was seized by the excited Brasyer.
  "Here you are," he said. "I was coming aboard the tug again. I've got more
  news. You remember I said I was going out with that railway clerk this
  afternoon, and meant pumping him? Well, I've done it and rushed
  away&mdash;don't know what he'll think's up. As we were going along we saw
  Norton, the steward, on the other side of the way, and the clerk recognised
  him as one of the men who brought the cases to be sent off; the other was the
  skipper, I've no doubt, from his description. I played him artfully, you
  know, and then he let out that both the cases were addressed to Mackrie at
  his address in London! He looked up the entry, he said, after I left when I
  first questioned him, feeling curious. That's about enough, I think, eh? I'm
  off to London now&mdash;I believe Mackrie's going to-night. I'll have him!
  Keep it dark!" And the zealous second officer dashed off without waiting for
  a reply. Hewitt looked after him with an amused smile, and turned off towards
  Lostella.</p>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was about eleven the next morning when Merrick received
  the following note, brought by a boatman:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Merrick</span>,&mdash;Am I
  commissioned? If not, don't trouble, but if I am, be just outside Lostella,
  at the turning before you come to the Smack Inn, at two o'clock. Bring with
  you a light cart, a policeman&mdash;or two perhaps will be better&mdash;and a
  man with a spade. There will probably be a little cabbage-digging. Are you
  fond of the sport?&mdash;Yours, <span class="smcap">Martin Hewitt</span>.<br>
  <br>
  "P.S.&mdash;<i>Keep all your men aboard</i>; bring the spade artist from the
  town."</p><br>

  <p>Merrick was off in a boat at once. His principals had replied to his
  telegram after Hewitt's departure the day before, giving him a free hand to
  do whatever seemed best. With some little difficulty he got the policemen,
  and with none at all he got a light cart and a jobbing man with a spade.
  Together they drove off to the meeting-place.</p>

  <p>It was before the time, but Martin Hewitt was there, waiting. "You're
  quick," he said, "but the sooner the better. I gave you the earliest
  appointment I thought you could keep, considering what you had to do."</p>

  <p>"Have you got the stuff, then?" Merrick asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly yet. But I've got this," and Hewitt held up the point of
  his walking-stick. Protruding half an inch or so from it was the sharp end of
  a small gimlet, and in the groove thereof was a little white wood, such as
  commonly remains after a gimlet has been used.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's that?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Let us move along&mdash;I'll walk. I think we're about at the
  end of the job&mdash;it's been a fairly lucky one, and quite simple. But I'll
  explain after."</p>

  <p>Just beyond the Smack Inn, Hewitt halted the cart, and all got down. They
  looped the horse's reins round a hedge-stake and proceeded the small
  remaining distance on foot, with the policemen behind, to avoid a premature
  scare. They turned up a lane behind a few small and rather dirty cottages
  facing the sea, each with its patch of kitchen garden behind. Hewitt led the
  way to the second garden, pushed open the small wicket gate and walked boldly
  in, followed by the others.</p>

  <p>Cabbages covered most of the patch, and seemed pretty healthy in their
  situation, with the exception of half a dozen&mdash;singularly enough, all
  together in a group. These were drooping, yellow, and wilted, and towards
  these Hewitt straightway walked. "Dig up those wilted cabbages," he said to
  the jobbing man. "They're really useless now. You'll probably find something
  else six inches down or so."</p>

  <p>The man struck his spade into the soft earth, wherein it stopped suddenly
  with a thud. But at this moment a gaunt, slatternly woman, with a black eye,
  a handkerchief over her head, and her skirt pinned up in front, observing the
  invasion from the back door of the cottage, rushed out like a maniac and
  attacked the party valiantly with a broom. She upset the jobbing man over his
  spade, knocked off one policeman's helmet, lunged into the other's face with
  her broom, and was making her second attempt to hit Hewitt (who had dodged),
  when Merrick caught her firmly by the elbows from behind, pressed them
  together, and held her. She screamed, and people came from other cottages and
  looked on. "Peter! Peter!" the woman screamed, "come 'ee, come'ee here!
  Davey! They're come!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic13"
     name="pic13"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-2-6.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>A grimy child came to the cottage door, and seeing the woman thus held,
  and strangers in the garden, set up a piteous howl. Meantime the digger had
  uncovered two wooden boxes, each eighteen inches long or so, bound with
  hoop-iron and sealed. One had been torn partly open at the top, and the
  broken wood roughly replaced. When this was lifted, bars of yellow metal were
  visible within.</p>

  <p>The woman still screamed vehemently, and struggled. The grimy child
  retreated, and then there appeared at the door, staggering hazily and rubbing
  his eyes, a shaggy, unkempt man, in shirt and trousers. He looked stupidly at
  the scene before him, and his jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Take that man," cried Hewitt. "He's one!" And the policeman promptly took
  him, so that he had handcuffs on his wrists before he had collected his
  faculties sufficiently to begin swearing.</p>

  <p>Hewitt and the other policeman entered the cottage. In the lower two rooms
  there was nobody. They climbed the few narrow stairs, and in the front room
  above they found another man, younger, and fast asleep. "He's the other,"
  said Hewitt. "Take <i>him</i>." And this one was handcuffed before he
  woke.</p>

  <p>Then the recovered gold was put into the cart, and with the help of the
  village constable, who brought his own handcuffs for the benefit and
  adornment of the lady with the broom, such a procession marched out of
  Lostella as had never been dreamed of by the oldest inhabitant in his worst
  nightmare, nor recorded in the whole history of Cornwall.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Hewitt, turning to Merrick, "we must have that fellow of
  yours&mdash;what's his name&mdash;Gullen, isn't it? The one that went down to
  measure the hole in the ship. You've kept him aboard, of course?"</p>

  <p>"What, Gullen?" exclaimed Merrick. "Gullen? Well, as a matter of fact he
  went ashore last night and hasn't come back. But you don't mean to
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i>," replied Hewitt. "And now you've lost him."</p>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">"BUT tell me all about it now we've a little time to
  ourselves," asked Merrick an hour or two later, as they sat and smoked in the
  after-cabin of the salvage tug. "We've got the stuff, thanks to you, but I
  don't in the least see how they got it, nor how you found it out."</p>

  <p>"Well, there didn't seem to be a great deal either way in the tales told
  by the men from the <i>Nicobar</i>. They cancelled one another out, so to
  speak, though it seemed likely that there might be something in them in one
  or two respects. Brasyer, I could see, tried to prove too much. If the
  captain and the steward were conspiring to rob the bullion-room, why should
  the steward trouble to cut through the boiler-plate walls when the captain
  kept the keys in his cabin? And if the captain had been stealing the bullion,
  why should he stop at two cases when he had all the voyage to operate in and
  forty cases to help himself to? Of course the evidence of the carpenter gave
  some colour to the theory, but I think I can imagine a very reasonable
  explanation of that.</p>

  <p>"You told me, of course, that you were down with the men yourself when
  they opened the bullion-room door and got out the cases, so that there could
  be no suspicion of <i>them</i>. But at the same time you told me that the
  breach in the <i>Nicobar's</i> side had laid open the bullion-room partition,
  and that you might more easily have got the cases out that way. You told me,
  of course, that the cases couldn't have <i>fallen</i> out that way because of
  the list of the vessel, the position of the rent in the boiler-plate, and so
  on. But I reflected that the day before a diver had been down alone&mdash;in
  fact, that his business had been with the very hole that extended partly to
  the bullion-room: he had to measure it. That diver might easily have got at
  the cases through the breach. But then, as you told me, a diver can't bring
  things up from below unobserved. This diver would know this, and might
  therefore hide the booty below. So that I made up my mind to have a look
  under water before I jumped to any conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think it likely that he had hidden the cases, mind you. Because
  he would have had to dive again to get them, and would have been just as
  awkwardly placed in fetching them to the light of day then as ever. Besides,
  he couldn't come diving here again in the company's dress without some
  explanation. So what more likely than that he would make some ingenious
  arrangement with an accomplice, whereby he might make the gold in some way
  accessible to him?</p>

  <p>"We went under water. I kept my eyes open, and observed, among other
  things, that the vessel was one of those well-kept 'swell' ones on which all
  the hatch gratings and so on are in plain oak or teak, kept holystoned. This
  (with the other things) I put by in my mind in case it should be useful. When
  we went over the side and looked at the great gap, I saw that it would have
  been quite easy to get at the broken bullion-room partition from
  outside."</p>

  <p>"Yes," remarked Merrick, "it would be no trouble at all. The ladder goes
  down just by the side of the breach, and any one descending by that might
  just step off at one side on to the jagged plating at the level of the after
  orlop, and reach over into the bullion safe."</p>

  <p>"Just so. Well, next I turned my attention to the sea-bed, which I was
  extremely pleased to see was of soft, slimy claystone. I walked about a
  little, getting farther and farther away from the vessel as I went, till I
  came across that clean stone which I turned over with my foot. Do you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was noticeable. It was the only clean, bare stone to be seen.
  Every other was covered with a green growth, and to most clumps of weed
  clung. The obvious explanation of this was that the stone was a
  new-comer&mdash;lately brought from dry land&mdash;from the shingle on the
  sea-shore, probably, since it was washed so clean. Such a stone could not
  have come a mile out to sea by itself. Somebody had brought it in a boat and
  thrown it over, and whoever did it didn't take all that trouble for nothing.
  Then its shape told a tale; it was something of the form, rather exaggerated,
  of a loaf&mdash;the sort that is called a 'cottage'&mdash;the most convenient
  possible shape for attaching to a line and lowering. But the line had gone,
  so somebody must have been down there to detach it. Also it wasn't
  unreasonable to suppose that there might have been a hook on the end of that
  line. This, then, was a theory. Your man had gone down alone to take his
  measurement, had stepped into the broken side, as you have explained he
  could, reached into the bullion-room, and lifted the two cases. Probably he
  unfastened the cord, and brought them out one at a time for convenience in
  carrying. Then he carried the cases, one at a time, as I have said, over to
  that white stone which lay there sunk with the hook and line attached by
  previous arrangement with some confederate. He detached the rope from the
  stone&mdash;it was probably fixed by an attached piece of cord, tightened
  round the stone with what you call a timber-hitch, easily
  loosened&mdash;replaced the cord round the two cases, passed the hook under
  the cord, and left it to be pulled up from above. But then it could not have
  been pulled up there in broad daylight, under your very noses. The
  confederates would wait till night. That meant that the other end of the rope
  was attached to some floating object, so that it might be readily recovered.
  The whole arrangement was set one night to be carried away the next."</p>

  <p>"But why didn't Gullen take more than two cases?"</p>

  <p>"He couldn't afford to waste the time, in the first place. Each case
  removed meant another journey to and from the vessel, and you were waiting
  above for his measurements. Then he was probably doubtful as to weight. Too
  much at once wouldn't easily be drawn up, and might upset a small boat.</p>

  <p>"Well, so much for the white stone. But there was more; close by the stone
  I noticed (although I think you didn't) a mark in the claystone. It was a
  triangular depression or pit, sharp at the bottom&mdash;just the hole that
  would be made by the sharp impact of the square corner of a heavy box, if
  shod with iron, as the bullion cases are. This was one important thing. It
  seemed to indicate that the boxes had not been lifted directly up from the
  seabed, but had been dragged sideways&mdash;at all events at first&mdash;so
  that a sharp corner had turned over and dug into the claystone! I walked a
  little farther and found more indications&mdash;slight scratches, small
  stones displaced, and so on, that convinced me of this, and also pointed out
  the direction in which the cases had been dragged. I followed the direction,
  and presently arrived at another stone, rather smaller than the clean one.
  The cases had evidently caught against this, and it had been displaced by
  their momentum, and perhaps by a possible wrench from above. The green growth
  covered the part which had been exposed to the water, and the rest of the
  stone fitted the hole beside it, from which it had been pulled. Clearly these
  things were done recently, or the sea would have wiped out all the traces in
  the soft claystone. The rest of what I did under water of course you
  understood."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so: you took the bearings of the two stones in relation to the
  ship by pacing the distances."</p>

  <p>"That is so. I kept the figures in my head till I could make a note of
  them, as you saw, on paper. The rest was mere calculation. What I judged had
  happened was this. Gullen had arranged with somebody, identity unknown, but
  certainly somebody with a boat at his disposal, to lay the line, and take it
  up the following night. Now anything larger than a rowing boat could not have
  got up quite so close to you in the night (although your tug was at the other
  end of the wreck) without a risk of being seen. <i>But</i> no rowing boat
  could have <i>dragged</i> those cases forcibly along the bottom; they would
  act as an anchor to it. Therefore this was what had happened. The thieves had
  come in a large boat&mdash;a fishing smack, lugger, or something of that
  sort&mdash;with a small boat in tow. The sailing boat had lain to at a
  convenient distance, <i>in the direction in which it was afterwards to
  go</i>, so as to save time if observed, and a man had put off quietly in the
  small boat to pick up the float, whatever it was. There must have been a lot
  of slack line on this for the purpose, as also for the purpose of allowing
  the float to drift about fairly freely, and not attract attention by
  remaining in one place. The man pulled off to the sailing boat, and took the
  float and line aboard. Then the sailing boat swung off in the direction of
  home, and the line was hauled in with the plunder at the end of it."</p>

  <p>"One would think you had seen it all&mdash;or done it," Merrick remarked,
  with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Nothing else could have happened, you see. That chain of events is the
  only one that will explain the circumstances. A rapid grasp of the whole
  circumstances and a perfect appreciation of each is more than half the battle
  in such work as this. Well, you know I got the exact bearings of the wreck on
  the chart, worked out from that the lay of the two stones with the scratch
  marks between, and then it was obvious that a straight line drawn through
  these and carried ahead would indicate, approximately, at any rate, the
  direction the thieves' vessel had taken. The line fell on the coast close by
  the village of Lostella&mdash;indeed that was the only village for some few
  miles either way. The indication was not certain, but it was likely, and the
  only one available, therefore it must be followed up."</p>

  <p>"And what about the painted hatch? How did you guess that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I saw there were hatch-gratings belonging to the <i>Nicobar</i>
  floating about, and it seemed probable that the thieves would use for a float
  something similar to the other wreckage in the vicinity, so as not to attract
  attention. Nothing would be more likely than a hatch-grating. But then, in
  small vessels, such as fishing-luggers and so on, fittings are almost always
  painted&mdash;they can't afford to be such holystoning swells as those on the
  <i>Nicobar</i>. So I judged the grating might be painted, and this would
  possibly have been noticed by some sharp person. I made the shot, and hit.
  The boy remembered the white grating, which had gone&mdash;' washed away,' as
  he thought. That was useful to me, as you shall see.</p>

  <p>"I made off toward Lostella. The tide was low and it was getting dusk when
  I arrived. A number of boats and smacks were lying anchored on the beach, but
  there were few people to be seen. I began looking out for smacks with
  white-painted fittings in them. There are not so many of these among fishing
  vessels&mdash;brown or red is more likely, or sheer colourless dirt over
  paint unrecognisable. There were only two that I saw last night. The first
  <i>might</i> have been the one I wanted, but there was nothing to show it.
  The second <i>was</i> the one. She was half-decked and had a small
  white-painted hatch. I shifted the hatch and found a long line, attached to
  the grating at one end and carrying a hook at the other! They had neglected
  to unfasten their apparatus&mdash;perhaps had an idea that there might be a
  chance of using it again in a few days. I went to the transom and read the
  inscription, '<i>Rebecca</i>. Peter and David Garthew, Lostella.' Then my
  business was to find the Garthews.</p>

  <p>"I wandered about the village for some little time, and presently got hold
  of a boy. I made a simple excuse for asking about the Garthews&mdash;wanted
  to go for a sail to-morrow. The boy, with many grins, confided to me that
  both of the Garthews were 'on the booze.' I should find them at the Smack
  Inn, where they had been all day, drunk as fiddlers. This seemed a likely
  sort of thing after the haul they had made. I went to the Smack Inn,
  determined to claim old friendship with the Garthews, although I didn't know
  Peter from David. There they were&mdash;one sleepy drunk, and the other
  loving and crying drunk. I got as friendly as possible with them under the
  circumstances, and at closing time stood another gallon of beer and carried
  it home for them, while they carried each other. I took cafe to have a good
  look round in the cottage. I even helped Peter's 'old woman'&mdash;the lady
  with the broom&mdash;to carry them up to bed. But nowhere could I see
  anything that looked like a bullion-case or a hiding-place for one. So I came
  away, determined to renew my acquaintance in the morning, and to carry it on
  as long as might be necessary; also to look at the garden in the daylight for
  signs of burying. With that view I fixed that little gimlet in my
  walking-stick, as you saw.</p>

  <p>"This morning I was at Lostella before ten, and took a look at the
  Garthews' cabbages. It seemed odd that half a dozen, all in a clump together,
  looked withered and limp, as though they had been dug up hastily, the roots
  broken, perhaps, and then replanted. And altogether these particular cabbages
  had a dissipated, leaning-different-ways look, as though <i>they</i> had been
  on the loose with the Garthews. So, seeing a grubby child near the back door
  of the cottage, I went towards him, walking rather unsteadily, so as, if I
  were observed, to favour the delusion that I was not yet quite got over last
  night's diversions. 'Hullo, my b-boy,' I said, 'hullo, li'l b-boy, look
  here,' and I plunged my hand into my trousers' pocket and brought it out full
  of small change. Then, making a great business of selecting him a penny, I
  managed to spill it all over the dissipated cabbages. It was easy then, in
  stooping to pick up the change, to lean heavily on my stick and drive it
  through the loose earth. As I had expected, there was a box below. So I
  gouged away with my walking-stick while I collected my coppers, and finally
  swaggered off, after a few civil words with the 'old woman,' carrying with me
  evident proof that it was white wood recently buried there. The rest you saw
  for yourself. I think you and I may congratulate each other on having dodged
  that broom. It hit all the others."</p>

  <p>"What I'm wild about," said Merrick, "is having let that scoundrel Gullen
  get off. He's an artful chap, without a doubt. He saw us go over the side,
  you know, and after you had gone he came into the cabin for some
  instructions. Your pencil notes and the chart were on the table, and no doubt
  he put two and two together (which was more than I could, not knowing what
  had happened), and concluded to make himself safe for a bit. He had no leave
  that night&mdash;he just pulled away on the quiet. Why didn't you give me the
  tip to keep him?"</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't have done. In the first place, there was no legal evidence
  to warrant his arrest, and ordering him to keep aboard would have aroused his
  suspicions. I didn't know at the time how many days, or weeks, it would take
  me to find the bullion, if I ever found it, and in that time Gullen might
  have communicated in some way with his accomplices, and so spoilt the whole
  thing. Yes, certainly he seems to have been fairly smart in his way. He knew
  he would probably be sent down first, as usual, alone to make measurements,
  and conceived his plan and made his arrangements forthwith."</p>

  <p>"But now what I want to know is what about all those <i>Nicobar</i> people
  watching and suspecting one another? More especially what about the cases the
  captain and the steward are said to have fetched ashore?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt laughed. "Well," he said, "as to that, the presence of the bullion
  seems to have bred all sorts of mutual suspicion on board the ship. Brasyer
  was over-fussy, and his continual chatter started it probably, so that it
  spread like an infection. As to the captain and the steward, of course I
  don't know anything but that their rescued cases were bullion cases. Probably
  they were doing a little private trading&mdash;it's generally the case when
  captain and steward seem unduly friendly for their relative
  positions&mdash;and perhaps the cases contained something specially valuable:
  vases or bronzes from Japan, for instance; possibly the most valuable things
  of the size they had aboard. Then, if they had insured their things. Captain
  Mackrie (who has the reputation of a sharp and not very scrupulous man) might
  possibly think it rather a stroke of business to get the goods and the
  insurance money too, which would lead him to keep his parcels as quiet as
  possible. But that's as it may be."</p>

  <p>The case was much as Hewitt had surmised. The zealous Brasyer, posting to
  London in hot haste after Mackrie, spent some days in watching him. At last
  the captain and the steward with their two boxes took a cab and went to Bond
  Street, with Brasyer in another cab behind them. The two entered a shop, the
  window of which was set out with rare curiosities and much old silver and
  gold. Brasyer could restrain himself no longer. He grabbed a passing
  policeman, and rushed with him into the shop. There they found the captain
  and the steward with two small packing cases opened before them, trying to
  sell&mdash;a couple of very ancient-looking Japanese bronze figures, of that
  curious old workmanship and varied colour of metal that in genuine examples
  mean nowadays high money value.</p>

  <p>Brasyer vanished: there was too much chaff for him to live through in the
  British mercantile marine after this adventure. The fact was, the steward had
  come across the bargain, but had not sufficient spare cash to buy, so he
  called in the aid of the captain, and they speculated in the bronzes as
  partners. There was much anxious inspection of the prizes on the way home,
  and much discussion as to the proper price to ask. Finally, it was said, they
  got three hundred pounds for the pair.</p>

  <p>Now and again Hewitt meets Merrick still. Sometimes Merrick says, "Now, I
  wonder after all whether or not some of those <i>Nicobar</i> men who were
  continually dodging suspiciously about that bullion-room did mean having a
  dash at the gold if there were a chance?" And Hewitt replies, "I wonder."</p>

  <p class="first">AT one time, in common, perhaps, with most people, I took a
  sort of languid, amateur interest in questions of psychology, and was
  impelled thereby to plunge into the pages of the many curious and rather
  abstruse books which attempt to deal with phenomena of mind, soul and sense.
  Three things of the real nature of which, I am convinced, no man will ever
  learn more than we know at present&mdash;which is nothing.</p>

  <p>From these I strayed into the many volumes of <i>Transactions</i> of the
  Psychical Research Society, with an occasional by-excursion into mental
  telepathy and theosophy; the last, a thing whereof my Philistine intelligence
  obstinately refused to make head or tail.</p>

  <p>It was while these things were occupying part of my attention that I
  chanced to ask Hewitt whether, in the course of his divers odd and
  out-of-the-way experiences, he had met with any such weird adventures as were
  detailed in such profusion in the books of "authenticated" spooks,
  doppelgangers, poltergeists, clairvoyance, and so forth.</p>

  <p>"Well," Hewitt answered, with reflection, "I haven't been such a wallower
  in the uncanny as some of the worthy people who talk at large in those books
  of yours, and, as a matter of fact, my little adventures, curious as some of
  them may seem, have been on the whole of the most solid and matter-of-fact
  description. One or two things have happened that perhaps your 'psychical'
  people might be interested in, but they've mostly been found to be capable of
  a disappointingly simple explanation. One case of some genuine psychological
  interest, however, I have had; although there's nothing even in that which
  isn't a matter of well-known scientific possibility." And he proceeded to
  tell me the story that I have set down here, as well as I can, from
  recollection.</p>

  <p>I think I have already said, in another place, that Hewitt's professional
  start as a private investigator dated from his connection with the famous
  will case of Bartley v. Bartley and others, in which his then principals,
  Messrs. Crellan, Hunt &amp; Crellan, chiefly through his exertions
  established their extremely high reputation as solicitors. It was ten years
  or so after this case that Mr. Crellan senior&mdash;the head of the
  firm&mdash;retired into private life, and by an odd chance Hewitt's first
  meeting with him after that event was occasioned by another will
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>These were the terms of the telegram that brought Hewitt again into
  personal relations with his old principal:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"CAN YOU RUN DOWN AT ONCE ON A MATTER OF PRIVATE
  BUSINESS? I WILL BE AT GUILDFORD TO MEET ELEVEN THIRTY-FIVE FROM WATERLOO. IF
  LATER OR PREVENTED PLEASE WIRE. CRELLAN."</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic15B"

  </div><br>

  <p>The day and the state of Hewitt's engagements suited, and there was full
  half an hour to catch the train. Taking, therefore, the small travelling-bag
  that always stood ready packed in case of any sudden excursion that presented
  the possibility of a night from home, he got early to Waterloo, and by
  half-past twelve was alighting at Guildford Station. Mr. Crellan, a hale,
  white-haired old gentleman, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, was waiting with
  a covered carriage.</p>

  <p>"How d'ye do, Mr. Hewitt, how d'ye do?" the old gentleman exclaimed as
  soon as they met, grasping Hewitt's hand, and hurrying him toward the
  carriage. "I'm glad you've come, very glad. It isn't raining, and you might
  have preferred something more open, but I brought the brougham because I want
  to talk privately. I've been vegetating to such an extent for the last few
  years down here that any little occurrence out of the ordinary excites me,
  and I'm sure I couldn't have kept quiet till we had got indoors. It's been
  bad enough, keeping the thing to myself, already."</p>

  <p>The door shut, and the brougham started. Mr. Crellan laid his hand on
  Hewitt's knee, "I hope," he said, "I haven't dragged you away from any
  important business?"</p>

  <p>"No," Hewitt replied, "you have chosen a most excellent time. Indeed, I
  did think of making a small holiday to-day, but your telegram&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. Do you know, I was almost ashamed of having sent it after it
  had gone. Because, after all, the matter is, probably, really a very simple
  sort of affair that you can't possibly help me in. A few years ago I should
  have thought nothing of it, nothing at all. But as I have told you, I've got
  into such a dull, vegetable state of mind since I retired and have nothing to
  do that a little thing upsets me, and I haven't mental energy enough to make
  up my mind to go to dinner sometimes. But you're an old friend, and I'm sure
  you'll forgive my dragging you all down here on a matter that will, perhaps,
  seem ridiculously simple to you, a man in the thick of active business. If I
  hadn't known you so well I wouldn't have had the impudence to bother you. But
  never mind all that. I'll tell you.</p>

  <p>"Do you ever remember my speaking of an intimate friend, a Mr. Holford?
  No. Well, it's a long time ago, and perhaps I never happened to mention him.
  He was a most excellent man&mdash;old fellow, like me, you know; two or three
  years older, as a matter of fact. We were chums many years ago; in fact, we
  lodged in the same house when I was an articled clerk and he was a student at
  Guy's. He retired from the medical profession early, having come into a
  fortune, and came down here to live at the house we're going to; as a matter
  of fact, Wedbury Hall.</p>

  <p>"When I retired I came down and took up my quarters not far off, and we
  were a very excellent pair of old chums till last Monday&mdash;the day before
  yesterday&mdash;when my poor old friend died.. He was pretty well in
  years&mdash;seventy-three&mdash;and a man can't live for ever. But I assure
  you it has upset me terribly, made a greater fool of me than ever, in fact,
  just when I ought to have my wits about me.</p>

  <p>"The reason I particularly want my wits just now, and the reason I have
  requisitioned yours, is this: that I can't find poor old Holford's will. I
  drew it up for him years ago, and by it I was appointed his sole executor. I
  am perfectly convinced that he cannot have destroyed it, because he told me
  everything concerning his affairs. I have always been his only adviser, in
  fact, and I'm sure he would have consulted me as to any change in his
  testamentary intentions before he made it. Moreover, there are reasons why I
  know he could not have wished to die intestate."</p>

  <p>"Which are?" queried Hewitt as Mr. Crellan paused in his statement.</p>

  <p>"Which are these: Holford was a widower, with no children of his own. His
  wife, who has been dead nearly fifteen years now, was a most excellent woman,
  a model wife, and would have been a model mother if she had been one at all.
  As it was she adopted a little girl, a poor little soul who was left an
  orphan at two years of age. The child's father, an unsuccessful man of
  business of the name of Garth, maddened by a sudden and ruinous loss,
  committed suicide, and his wife died of the shock occasioned by the
  calamity.</p>

  <p>"The child, as I have said, was taken by Mrs. Holford and made a daughter
  of, and my old friend's daughter she has been ever since, practically
  speaking. The poor old fellow couldn't possibly have been more attached to a
  daughter of his own, and on her part she couldn't possibly have been a better
  daughter than she was. She stuck by him night and day during his last
  illness, until she became rather ill herself, although of course there was a
  regular nurse always in attendance.</p>

  <p>"Now, in his will, Mr. Holford bequeathed rather more than half of his
  very large property to this Miss Garth; that is to say, as residuary legatee,
  her interest in the will came to about that. The rest was distributed in
  various ways. Holford had largely spent the leisure of his retirement in
  scientific pursuits. So there were a few legacies to learned societies; all
  his servants were remembered; he left me a certain number of his books; and
  there was a very fair sum of money for his nephew, Mr. Cranley Mellis, the
  only near relation of Mr. Holford's still living. So that you see what the
  loss of this will may mean. Miss Garth, who was to have taken the greater
  part of her adoptive father's property, will not have one shilling's worth of
  claim on the estate and will be turned out into the world without a cent. One
  or two very old servants will be very awkwardly placed, too, with nothing to
  live on, and very little prospect of doing more work."</p>

  <p>"Everything will go to this nephew," said Hewitt, "of course?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. That is unless I attempt to prove a rough copy of the will
  which I may possibly have by me. But even if I have such a thing and find it,
  long and costly litigation would be called for, and the result would probably
  be all against us."</p>

  <p>"You say you feel sure Mr. Holford did not destroy the will himself?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure he would never have done so without telling me of it;
  indeed, I am sure he would have consulted me first. Moreover, it can never
  have been his intention to leave Miss Garth utterly unprovided for; it would
  be the same thing as disinheriting his only daughter."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him frequently?"</p>

  <p>"There's scarcely been a day when I haven't seen him since I have lived
  down here. During his illness&mdash;it lasted a month&mdash;I saw him every
  day."</p>

  <p>"And he said nothing of destroying his will?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all. On the contrary, soon after his first
  seizure&mdash;indeed, on the first visit at which I found him in bed&mdash;he
  said, after telling me how he felt, 'Everything's as I want it, you know, in
  case I go under.' That seemed to me to mean his will was still as he desired
  it to be."</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, it would seem so. But counsel on the other side (supposing
  there were another side) might quite as plausibly argue that he meant to die
  intestate, and had destroyed his will so that everything should be as he
  wanted it, in that sense. But what do you want me to do&mdash;find the
  will?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you can. It seemed to me that you, with your clever head,
  might be able to form a better judgment than I as to what has happened and
  who is responsible for it. Because if the will has been taken away, some one
  has taken it."</p>

  <p>"It seems probable. Have you told any one of your difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. I came over as soon as I could after Mr. Holford's death, and
  Miss Garth gave me all the keys, because, as executor, the case being a
  peculiar one, I wished to see that all was in order, and, as you know, the
  estate is legally vested in the executor from the death of the testator, so
  that I was responsible for everything; although, of course, if there is no
  will I'm not executor. But I thought it best to keep the difficulty to myself
  till I saw you."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. Is this Wedbury Hall?"</p>

  <p>The brougham had passed a lodge gate, and approached, by a wide drive, a
  fine old red brick mansion carrying the heavy stone dressings and copings
  distinctive of early eighteenth century domestic architecture.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Crellan, "this is the place. We will go straight to the
  study, I think, and then I can explain details."</p>

  <p>The study told the tale of the late Mr. Holford's habits and interests. It
  was half a library, half a scientific laboratory: pathological curiosities in
  spirits, a retort or two, test tubes on the writing-table, and a fossilized
  lizard mounted in a case, balanced the many shelves and cases of books
  disposed about the walls. In a recess between two book-cases stood a heavy,
  old-fashioned mahogany bureau.</p>

  <p>"Now it was in that bureau," Mr. Crellan explained, indicating it with his
  finger, "that Mr. Holford kept every document that was in the smallest degree
  important or valuable. I have seen him at it a hundred times, and he always
  maintained it was as secure as any iron safe. That may not have been
  altogether the fact, but the bureau is certainly a tremendously heavy and
  strong one. Feel it."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Hewitt took down the front and pulled out a drawer that Mr. Crellan
  unlocked for the purpose.</p>

  <p>"Solid Spanish mahogany an inch thick," was his verdict, "heavy, hard, and
  seasoned; not the sort of thing you can buy nowadays. Locks, Chubb's patent,
  early pattern, but not easily to be picked by anything short of a blast of
  gunpowder. If there are no marks on this bureau it hasn't been tampered
  with."</p>

  <p>"Well," Mr. Crellan pursued, "as I say, <i>that</i> was where Mr. Holford
  kept his will. I have often seen it when we have been here together, and this
  was the drawer, the top on the right, that he kept it in. The will was a mere
  single sheet of foolscap, and was kept, folded of course, in a blue
  envelope."</p>

  <p>"When did you yourself last actually see the will?"</p>

  <p>"I saw it in my friend's hand two days before he took to his bed. He
  merely lifted it in his hand to get at something else in the drawer, replaced
  it, and locked the drawer again."</p>

  <p>"Of course there are other drawers, bureaux, and so on, about the place.
  You have examined them carefully, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"I've turned out ever possible receptacle for that will in the house, I
  positively assure you, and there isn't a trace of it."</p>

  <p>"You've thought of secret drawers, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There are two in the bureau which I always knew of. Here they are."
  Mr. Crellan pressed his thumb against a partition of the pigeonholes at the
  back of the bureau and a strip of mahogany flew out from below, revealing two
  shallow drawers with small ivory catches in lieu of knobs. "Nothing there at
  all. And this other, as I have said, was the drawer where the will was kept.
  The other papers kept in the same drawer are here as usual."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody else know where Mr. Holford kept his will?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody in the house, I should think. He was a frank, above-board sort
  of man. His adopted daughter knew, and the butler knew, and there was
  absolutely no reason why all the other servants shouldn't know; probably they
  did."</p>

  <p>"First," said Hewitt, "we will make quite sure there are no more secret
  drawers about this bureau. Lock the door in case anybody comes."</p>

  <p>Hewitt took out every drawer of the bureau, and examined every part of
  each before he laid it aside. Then he produced a small pair of silver
  callipers and an ivory pocket-rule and went over every inch of the heavy
  framework, measuring, comparing, tapping, adding, and subtracting dimensions.
  In the end he rose to his feet satisfied. "There is most certainly nothing
  concealed there," he said.</p>

  <p>The drawers were put back, and Mr. Crellan suggested lunch. At Hewitt's
  suggestion it was brought to the study.</p>

  <p>"So far," Hewitt said, "we arrive at this: either Mr. Holford has
  destroyed his will, or he has most effectually concealed it, or somebody has
  stolen it. The first of these possibilities you don't favour."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it is a possibility for a moment. I have told you why;
  and I knew Holford so well, you know. For the same reasons I am sure he never
  concealed it."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Somebody has stolen it. The question is, who?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that every one in this house had a direct and personal
  interest in preserving that will. The servants have all something left them,
  you say, and without the will that goes, of course. Miss Garth has the
  greatest possible interest in the will. The only person I have heard of as
  yet who would benefit by its loss or destruction would be the nephew, Mr.
  Mellis. There are no other relatives, you say, who would benefit by
  intestacy?"</p>

  <p>"Not one."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think yourself, now? Have you any suspicions?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan shrugged his shoulders. "I've no more right to suspicions than
  you have, I suppose," he said. "Of course, if there are to be suspicions they
  can only point one way. Mr. Mellis is the only person who can gain by the
  disappearance of this will."</p>

  <p>"Just so. Now, what do you know of him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know much of the young man," Mr. Crellan said slowly. "I must say
  I never particularly took to him. He is rather a clever fellow, I believe. He
  was called to the bar some time ago, and afterwards studied medicine, I
  believe, with the idea of priming himself for a practice in medical
  jurisprudence. He took a good deal of interest in my old friend's researches,
  I am told&mdash;at any rate he <i>said</i> he did; he may have been thinking
  of his uncle's fortune. But they had a small tiff on some medical question. I
  don't know exactly what it was, but Mr. Holford objected to something&mdash;a
  method of research or something of that kind&mdash;as being dangerous and
  unprofessional. There was no actual rupture between them, you understand, but
  Mellis's visits slacked off, and there was a coolness."</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Mellis now?"</p>

  <p>"In London, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Has he been in this house between the day you last saw the will in that
  drawer and yesterday, when you failed to find it?"</p>

  <p>"Only once. He came to see his uncle two days before his death&mdash;last
  Saturday, in fact. He didn't stay long."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What did he do?"</p>

  <p>"Merely came into the room for a few minutes&mdash;visitors weren't
  allowed to stay long&mdash;spoke a little to his uncle, and went back to
  town."</p>

  <p>"Did he do nothing else, or see anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Garth went out of the room with him as he left, and I should think
  they talked for a little before he went away, to judge by the time she was
  gone; but I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You are sure he went then?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him in the drive as I looked from the window."</p>

  <p>"Miss Garth, you say, has kept all the keys since the beginning of Mr.
  Holford's illness?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, until she gave them up to me yesterday. Indeed, the nurse, who is
  rather a peppery customer, and was jealous of Miss Garth's presence in the
  sick room all along, made several difficulties about having to go to her for
  everything."</p>

  <p>"And there is no doubt of the bureau having been kept locked all the
  time?"</p>

  <p>"None at all. I have asked Miss Garth that&mdash;and, indeed, a good many
  other things&mdash;without saying why I wanted the information."</p>

  <p>"How are Mr. Mellis and Miss Garth affected toward one another&mdash;are
  they friendly?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Indeed, some while ago I rather fancied that Mellis was disposed
  to pay serious addresses in that quarter. He may have had a fancy that way,
  or he may have been attracted by the young lady's expectations. At any rate,
  nothing definite seems to have come of it as yet. But I must
  say&mdash;between ourselves, of course&mdash;I have more than once noticed a
  decided air of agitation, shyness perhaps, in Miss Garth when Mr. Mellis has
  been present. But, at any rate, that scarcely matters. She is twenty-four
  years of age now, and can do as she likes. Although, if I had anything to say
  in the matter&mdash;well, never mind."</p>

  <p>"You, I take it, have known Miss Garth along time?"</p>

  <p>"Bless you, yes. Danced her on my knee twenty years ago. I've been her
  'Uncle Leonard' all her life."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think we must at least let Miss Garth know of the loss of the
  will. Perhaps, when they have cleared away these plates, she will come here
  for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and ask her," Mr. Crellan answered, and having rung the bell,
  proceeded to find Miss Garth.</p>

  <p>Presently he returned with the lady. She was a slight, very pale young
  woman; no doubt rather pretty in ordinary, but now not looking her best. She
  was evidently worn and nervous from anxiety and want of sleep, and her eyes
  were sadly inflamed. As the wind slammed a loose casement behind her she
  started nervously, and placed her hand to her head.</p>

  <p>"Sit down at once, my dear," Mr. Crellan said; "sit down. This is Mr.
  Martin Hewitt, whom I have taken the liberty of inviting down here to help me
  in a very important matter. The fact is, my dear," Mr. Crellan added gravely,
  "I can't find your poor father's will."</p>

  <p>Miss Garth was not surprised. "I thought so," she said mildly, "when you
  asked me about the bureau yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Of course I need not say, my dear, what a serious thing it may be for you
  if that will cannot be found. So I hope you'll try and tell Mr. Hewitt here
  anything he wants to know as well as you can, without forgetting a single
  thing. I'm pretty sure that he will find it for us if it is to be found."</p>

  <p>"I understand, Miss Garth," Hewitt asked, "that the keys of that bureau
  never left your possession during the whole time of Mr. Holford's last
  illness, and that the bureau was kept locked?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is so."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever have occasion to go to the bureau yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have not touched it."</p>

  <p>"Then you can answer for it, I presume, that the bureau was never unlocked
  by <i>any one</i> from the time Mr. Holford placed the keys in your hands
  till you gave them to Mr. Crellan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Now is there any place on the whole premises that you can
  suggest where this will may possibly be hidden?"</p>

  <p>"There is no place that Mr. Crellan doesn't know of, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"It is an old house, I observe," Hewitt pursued. "Do you know of any place
  of concealment in the structure&mdash;any secret doors, I mean, you know, or
  sliding panels, or hollow door frames, and so forth?"</p>

  <p>Miss Garth shook her head. "There is not a single place of the sort you
  speak of in the whole building, so far as I know," she said, "and I have
  lived here almost all my life."</p>

  <p>"You knew the purport of Mr. Holford's will, I take it, and understand
  what its loss may mean to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Now I must ask you to consider carefully. Take your mind back to two or
  three days before Mr. Holford's illness began, and tell me if you can
  remember any single fact, occurrence, word, or hint from that day to this in
  any way bearing on the will, or anything connected with it?"</p>

  <p>Miss Garth shook her head thoughtfully. "I can't remember the thing being
  mentioned by anybody, except perhaps by the nurse, who is rather a touchy
  sort of woman, and once or twice took it upon herself to hint that my recent
  anxiety was chiefly about my poor father's money. And that once, when I had
  done some small thing for him, my father&mdash;I have always called him
  father, you know&mdash;said that he wouldn't forget it, or that I should be
  rewarded, or something of that sort. Nothing else that I can remember in the
  remotest degree concerned the will."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mellis said nothing about it, then?"</p>

  <p>Miss Garth changed colour slightly, but answered, "No, I only saw him to
  the door."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Miss Garth, I won't trouble you any further just now. But if
  you can remember anything more in the course of the next few hours it may
  turn out to be of great service."</p>

  <p>Miss Garth bowed and withdrew. Mr. Crellan shut the door behind her and
  returned to Hewitt. "<i>That</i> doesn't carry us much further," he said.
  "The more certain it seems that the will cannot have been got at, the more
  difficult our position is from a legal point of view. What shall we do
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Is the nurse still about the place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe so."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll speak to her."</p>

  <p>The nurse came in response to Mr. Crellan's summons: a sharp-featured,
  pragmatical woman of forty-five. She took the seat offered her, and waited
  for Hewitt's questions.</p>

  <p>"You were in attendance on Mr. Holford, I believe, Mrs. Turton, since the
  beginning of his last illness?"</p>

  <p>"Since October 24th."</p>

  <p>"Were you present when Mr. Mellis came to see his uncle last
  Saturday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me what took place?"</p>

  <p>"As to what the gentleman said to Mr. Holford," the nurse replied,
  bridling slightly, "of course I don't know anything, it not being my business
  and not intended for my ears. Mr. Crellan was there, and knows as much as I
  do, and so does Miss Garth. I only know that Mr. Mellis stayed for a few
  minutes and then went out of the room with Miss Garth."</p>

  <p>"How long was Miss Garth gone?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Now Mrs. Turton, I want you to tell me in confidence&mdash;it is very
  important&mdash;whether you, at any time, heard Mr. Holford during his
  illness say anything of his wishes as to how his property was to be left in
  case of his death?"</p>

  <p>The nurse started and looked keenly from Hewitt to Mr. Crellan and back
  again.</p>

  <p>"Is it the will you mean?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Did he mention it?"</p>

  <p>"You mean you can't find the will, isn't that it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose it is, what then?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose won't do," the nurse answered shortly; "I <i>do</i> know
  something about the will, and I believe you can't find it."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, Mrs. Turton, that if you know anything about the will you will
  tell Mr. Crellan in the interests of right and justice."</p>

  <p>"And who's to protect me against the spite of those I shall offend if I
  tell you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan interposed.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you tell us, Mrs. Turton," he said, "will be held in the
  strictest confidence, and the source of our information shall not be
  divulged. For that I give you my word of honour. And, I need scarcely add, I
  will see that you come to no harm by anything you may say."</p>

  <p>"Then the will <i>is</i> lost. I may understand that?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt's features were impassive and impenetrable. But in Mr. Crellan's
  disturbed face the nurse saw a plain answer in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I see that's the trouble. Well, I know who took it."</p>

  <p>"Then who was it?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Miss Garth</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Garth! Nonsense!" cried Mr. Crellan, starting upright.
  "Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"It may be nonsense," the nurse replied slowly, with a monotonous emphasis
  on each word. "It may be nonsense, but it's a fact. I saw her take it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan simply gasped. Hewitt drew his chair a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"If you saw her take it," he said gently, closely watching the woman's
  face the while, "then, of course, there's no doubt."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I saw her take it," the nurse repeated. "What was in it, and
  what her game was in taking it, I don't know. But it was in that bureau,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;probably."</p>

  <p>"In the right hand top drawer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"A white paper in a blue envelope?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then I saw her take it, as I said before. She unlocked that drawer before
  my eyes, took it out, and locked the drawer again."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan turned blankly to Hewitt, but Hewitt kept his eyes on the
  nurse's face.</p>

  <p>"When did this occur?" he asked, "and how?"</p>

  <p>"It was on Saturday night, rather late. Everybody was in bed but Miss
  Garth and myself, and she had been down to the dining-room for something. Mr.
  Holford was asleep, so as I wanted to re-fill the water-bottle, I took it up
  and went. As I was passing the door of this room that we are in now, I heard
  a noise, and looked in at the door, which was open. There was a candle on the
  table which had been left there earlier in the evening. Miss Garth was
  opening the top right hand drawer of <i>that</i> bureau"&mdash;Mrs. Turton
  stabbed her finger spitefully toward the piece of furniture, as though she
  owed it a personal grudge&mdash;"and I saw her take out a blue foolscap
  envelope, and as the flap was open, I could see the enclosed paper was white.
  She shut the drawer, locked it, and came out of the room with the envelope in
  her hand."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>"And what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I hurried on, and she came away without seeing me, and went in the
  opposite direction&mdash;toward the small staircase."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Mr. Crellan ventured at a blurt, "perhaps she was walking in
  her sleep?"</p>

  <p>"That she wasn't!" the nurse replied, "for she came back to Mr. Holford's
  room almost as soon as I returned there, and asked some questions about the
  medicine&mdash;which was nothing new, for I must say she was very fond of
  interfering in things that were part of my business."</p>

  <p>"That is quite certain, I suppose," Hewitt remarked&mdash;"that she could
  not have been asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Quite certain. She talked for about a quarter of an hour, and wanted to
  kiss Mr. Holford, which might have wakened him, before she went to bed. In
  fact, I may say we had a disagreement."</p>

  <p>Hewitt did not take his steady gaze from the nurse's face for some seconds
  after she had finished speaking. Then he only said, "Thank you, Mrs. Turton.
  I need scarcely assure you, after what Mr. Crellan has said, that your
  confidence shall not be betrayed. I think that is all, unless you have more
  to tell us."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Turton bowed and rose. "There is nothing more," she said, and left
  the room.</p>

  <p>As soon as she had gone, "Is Mrs. Turton at all interested in the will,"
  Hewitt asked.</p>

  <p>"No, there is nothing for her. She is a newcomer, you see. Perhaps," Mr.
  Crellan went on, struck by an idea, "she may be jealous, or something. She
  seems a spiteful woman&mdash;and really, I can't believe her story for a
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it's absurd. Why should Miss Garth go to all this secret
  trouble to do herself an injury&mdash;to make a beggar of herself? And
  besides, she's not in the habit of telling barefaced lies. She distinctly
  assured us, you remember, that she had never been to the bureau for any
  purpose whatever."</p>

  <p>"But the nurse has an honest character, hasn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, her character is excellent. Indeed, from all accounts, she is a very
  excellent woman, except for a desire to govern everybody, and a habit of
  spite if she is thwarted. But, of course, that sort of thing sometimes leads
  people rather far."</p>

  <p>"So it does," Hewitt replied. "But consider now. Is it not possible that
  Miss Garth, completely infatuated with Mr. Mellis, thinks she is doing a
  noble thing for him by destroying the will and giving up her whole claim to
  his uncle's property? Devoted women do just such things, you know."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan stared, bent his head to his hand, and considered. "So they
  do, so they do," he said. "Insane foolery. Really, it's the sort of thing I
  can imagine her doing&mdash;she's honour and generosity itself. But then
  those lies," he resumed, sitting up and slapping his leg; "I can't believe
  she'd tell such tremendous lies as that for anybody. And with such a calm
  face, too&mdash;I'm sure she couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's as it may be. You can scarcely set a limit to the lengths a
  woman will go on behalf of a man she loves. I suppose, by the bye, Miss Garth
  is not exactly what you would call a 'strong-minded' woman?"</p>

  <p>"No, she's not that. She'd never get on in the world by herself. She's a
  good little soul, but nervous&mdash;very; and her month of anxiety, grief,
  and want of sleep seems to have broken her up."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mellis knows of the death, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I telegraphed to him at his chambers in London the first thing
  yesterday&mdash;Tuesday&mdash;morning, as soon as the telegraph office was
  open. He came here (as I've forgotten to tell you as yet) the first thing
  this morning&mdash;before I was over here myself, in fact. He had been
  staying not far off&mdash;at Ockham, I think&mdash;and the telegram had been
  sent on. He saw Miss Garth, but couldn't stay, having to get back to London.
  I met him going away as I came, about eleven o'clock. Of course I said
  nothing about the fact that I couldn't find the will, but he will probably be
  down again soon, and may ask questions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Hewitt replied. "And speaking of that matter, you can no doubt talk
  with Miss Garth on very intimate and familiar terms?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;yes; I've told you what old friends we are."</p>

  <p>"I wish you could manage, at some favourable opportunity to-day, to speak
  to her alone, and without referring to the will in any way, get to know, as
  circumspectly and delicately as you can, how she stands in regard to Mr.
  Mellis. Whether he is an accepted lover, or likely to be one, you know.
  Whatever answer you may get, you may judge, I expect, by her manner how
  things really are."</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;I'll seize the first chance. Meanwhile what to do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I'm afraid, except perhaps to examine other pieces of furniture
  as closely as we have examined this bureau."</p>

  <p>Other bureaux, desks, tables, and chests were examined fruitlessly. It was
  not until after dinner that Mr. Crellan saw a favourable opportunity of
  sounding Miss Garth as he had promised. Half an hour later he came to Hewitt
  in the study, more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>"There's no engagement between them,"'he reported, "secret or open, nor
  ever has been. It seems, from what I can make out, going to work as
  diplomatically as possible, that Mellis <i>did</i> propose to her, or
  something very near it, a time ago, and was point-blank refused. Altogether,
  Miss Garth's sentiment for him appears to be rather dislike than
  otherwise."</p>

  <p>"That rather knocks a hole in the theory of self-sacrifice, doesn't it?"
  Hewitt remarked. "I shall have to think over this, and sleep on it. It's
  possible that it may be necessary to-morrow for you to tax Miss Garth,
  point-blank, with having taken away the will. Still, I hope not."</p>

  <p>"I hope not, too," Mr. Crellan said, rather dubious as to the result of
  such an experiment. "She has been quite upset enough already. And, by the
  bye, she didn't seem any the better or more composed after Mellis' visit this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Still, <i>then</i> the will was gone."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>And so Hewitt and Mr. Crellan talked on late into the evening, turning
  over every apparent possibility and finding reason in none. The household
  went to bed at ten, and, soon after, Miss Garth came to bid Mr. Crellan
  good-night. It had been settled that both Martin Hewitt and Mr. Crellan
  should stay the night at Wedbury Hall.</p>

  <p>Soon all was still, and the ticking of the tall clock in the hall below
  could be heard as distinctly as though it were in the study, while the rain
  without dropped from eaves and sills in regular splashes. Twelve o'clock
  struck, and Mr. Crellan was about to suggest retirement, when the sound of a
  light footstep startled Hewitt's alert ear. He raised his hand to enjoin
  silence, and stepped to the door of the room, Mr. Crellan following him.</p>

  <p>There was a light over the staircase, seven or eight yards away, and down
  the stairs came Miss Garth in dressing gown and slippers; she turned at the
  landing and vanished in a passage leading to the right.</p>

  <p><a id="pic19"
     name="pic19"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Where does that lead to?" Hewitt whispered hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Toward the small staircase&mdash;other end of house," Mr. Crellan replied
  in the same tones.</p>

  <p>"Come quietly," said Hewitt, and stepped lightly after Miss Garth, Mr.
  Crellan at his heels.</p>

  <p>She was nearing the opposite end of the passage, walking at a fair pace
  and looking neither to right nor left. There was another light over the
  smaller staircase at the end. Without hesitation Miss Garth turned down the
  stairs till about half down the flight, and then stopped and pressed her hand
  against the oak wainscot.</p>

  <p>Immediately the vertical piece of framing against which she had placed her
  hand turned on central pivots top and bottom, revealing a small recess, three
  feet high and little more than six inches wide. Miss Garth stooped and felt
  about at the bottom of this recess for several seconds. Then with every sign
  of extreme agitation and horror she withdrew her hand empty, and sank on the
  stairs. Her head rolled from side to side on her shoulders, and beads of
  perspiration stood on her forehead. Hewitt with difficulty restrained Mr.
  Crellan from going to her assistance.</p>

  <p>Presently, with a sort of shuddering sigh, Miss Garth rose, and after
  standing irresolute for a moment, descended the flight of stairs to the
  bottom. There she stopped again, and pressing her hand to her forehead,
  turned and began to re-ascend the stairs.</p>

  <p>Hewitt touched his companion's arm, and the two hastily but noiselessly
  made their way back along the passage to the study. Miss Garth left the open
  framing as it was, reached the top of the landing, and without stopping
  proceeded along the passage and turned up the main staircase, while Hewitt
  and Mr. Crellan still watched her from the study door.</p>

  <p>At the top of the flight she turned to the right, and up three or four
  more steps toward her own room. There she stopped, and leaned thoughtfully on
  the handrail.</p>

  <p>"Go up," whispered Hewitt to Mr. Crellan, "as though you were going to
  bed. Appear surprised to see her; ask if she isn't well, and, if you can,
  manage to repeat that question of mine about secret hiding-places in the
  house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan nodded and started quickly up the stairs. Half-way up he
  turned his head, and, as he went on, "Why, Nelly, my dear," he said, "what's
  the matter? Aren't you well?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan acted his part well, and waiting below, Hewitt heard this
  dialogue:</p>

  <p>"No, uncle, I don't feel very well, but it's nothing. I think my room
  seems close. I can scarcely breathe."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it isn't close to-night. You'll be catching cold, my dear. Go and
  have a good sleep; you mustn't worry that wise little head of yours, you
  know. Mr. Hewitt and I have been making quite a night of it, but I'm off to
  bed now."</p>

  <p>"I hope they've made you both quite comfortable, uncle?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; capital, capital. We've been talking over business, and, no
  doubt, we shall put that matter all in order soon. By the bye, I suppose
  since you saw Mr. Hewitt you haven't happened to remember anything more to
  tell him?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You still can't remember any hiding-places or panels, or that sort of
  thing in the wainscot or anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm sure I don't know of any, and I don't believe for a moment that
  any exist."</p>

  <p>"Quite sure of that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>"All right. Now go to bed. You'll catch such a cold in these draughty
  landings. Come, I won't move a step till I see your door shut behind you.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, uncle."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan came downstairs again with a face of blank puzzlement.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have believed it," he assured Martin Hewitt; "positively I
  wouldn't have believed she'd have told such a lie, and with such confidence,
  too. There's something deep and horrible here, I'm afraid. What does it
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"We'll talk of that afterwards," Hewitt replied. "Come now and take a look
  at that recess."</p>

  <p>They went, quietly still, to the small staircase and there, with a candle,
  closely examined the recess. It was a mere box, three feet high, a foot or a
  little more deep, and six or seven inches wide. The piece of oak framing,
  pivoted to the stair at the bottom and to a horizontal piece of framing at
  the top, stood edge forward, dividing the opening down the centre. There was
  nothing whatever in the recess.</p>

  <p>Hewitt ascertained that there was no catch, the plank simply remaining
  shut by virtue of fitting tightly, so that nothing but pressure on the proper
  part was requisite to open it. He had closed the plank and turned to speak to
  Mr. Crellan, when another interruption occurred.</p>

  <p>On each floor the two staircases were joined by passages, and the
  ground-floor passage, from the foot of the flight they were on, led to the
  entrance hall. Distinct amid the loud clicking of the hall clock, Hewitt now
  heard a sound, as of a person's foot shifting on a stone step.</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan heard it too, and each glanced at the other. Then Hewitt,
  shading the candle with his hand, led the way to the hall. There they
  listened for several seconds&mdash;almost an hour&mdash;it seemed&mdash;and
  then the noise was repeated. There was no doubt of it. It was at the other
  side of the front door.</p>

  <p>In answer to Hewitt's hurried whispers, Mr. Crellan assured him that there
  was no window from which, in the dark, a view could be got of a person
  standing outside the door. Also that any other way out would be equally
  noisy, and would entail the circuit of the house. The front door was fastened
  by three heavy bolts, an immense old-fashioned lock, and a bar. It would take
  nearly a minute to open at least, even if everything went easily. But, as
  there was no other way, Hewitt determined to try it. Handing the candle to
  his companion, he first lifted the bar, conceiving that it might be done with
  the least noise. It went easily, and, handling it carefully, Hewitt let it
  hang from its rivet without a sound. Just then, glancing at Mr. Crellan, he
  saw that he was forgetting to shade the candle, whose rays extended through
  the fanlight above the door, and probably through the wide crack under it.
  But it was too late. At the same moment the light was evidently perceived
  from outside; there was a hurried jump from the steps, and for an instant a
  sound of running on gravel. Hewitt tore back the bolts, flung the door open,
  and dashed out into the darkness, leaving Mr. Crellan on the doorstep with
  the candle.</p>

  <p><a id="pic20"

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Hewitt was gone, perhaps, five or ten minutes, although to Mr.
  Crellan&mdash;standing there at the open door in a state of high nervous
  tension, and with no notion of what was happening or what it all
  meant&mdash;the time seemed an eternity. When at last Hewitt reached the door
  again, "What was it?" asked Mr. Crellan, much agitated. "Did you see? Have
  you caught them?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't a chance," he said. "The wall is low over there, and there's a
  plantation of trees at the other side. But I think&mdash;yes, I begin to
  think&mdash;that I may possibly be able to see my way through this business
  in a little while. See this?"</p>

  <p>On the top step in the sheltered porch there remained the wet prints of
  two feet. Hewitt took a letter from his pocket, opened it out, spread it
  carefully over the more perfect of the two marks, pressed it lightly and
  lifted it. Then, when the door was shut, he produced his pocket scissors, and
  with great care cut away the paper round the wet part, leaving a piece, of
  course, the shape of a boot sole.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Hewitt, "we may get at something after all. Don't ask me to
  tell you anything now; I don't know anything, as a matter of fact. I hope
  this is the end of the night's entertainment, but I'm afraid the case is
  rather an unpleasant business. There is nothing for us to do now but to go to
  bed, I think. I suppose there's a handy man kept about the place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's gardener and carpenter and carpetbeater, and so on."</p>

  <p>"Good! Where's his sanctum? Where does he keep his shovels and carpet
  sticks?"</p>

  <p>"In the shed by the coach house, I believe. I think it's generally
  unlocked."</p>

  <p>"Very good. We've earned a night's rest, and now we'll have it."</p>

  <p>The next morning, after breakfast, Hewitt took Mr. Crellan into the
  study.</p>

  <p>"Can you manage," he said, "to send Miss Garth out for a walk this
  morning&mdash;with somebody?"</p>

  <p>"I can send her out for a ride with the groom&mdash;unless she thinks it
  wouldn't be the thing to go riding so soon after her bereavement."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, that will do. Send her at once, and see that she goes. Call
  it doctor's orders; say she must go for her health's
  sake&mdash;anything."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan departed, used his influence, and in half an hour Miss Garth
  had gone.</p>

  <p>"I was up pretty early this morning," Hewitt remarked on Mr. Crellan's
  return to the study, "and, among other things, I sent a telegram to London.
  Unless my eyes deceive me, a boy with a peaked cap&mdash;a telegraph boy, in
  fact&mdash;is coming up the drive this moment. Yes, he is. It is probably my
  answer."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes a telegram was brought in. Hewitt read it and then
  asked,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Your friend Mr. Mellis, I understand, was going straight to town
  yesterday morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Read that, then."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan took the telegram and read:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"MELLIS DID NOT SLEEP AT CHAMBERS LAST NIGHT. BEEN OUT OF
  TOWN FOR SOME DAYS PAST. KERRETT."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan looked up.</p>

  <p>"Who's Kerrett?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lad in my office; sharp fellow. You see, Mellis didn't go to town after
  all. As a matter of fact, I believe he was nearer this place than we thought.
  You said he had a disagreement with his uncle because of scientific practices
  which the old gentleman considered 'dangerous and unprofessional,' I
  think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was the case."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then the key to all the mystery of the will is in this room."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"There." Hewitt pointed to the book-cases. "Read Bernheim's <i>Suggestive
  Therapeutics</i>, and one or two books of Heidenhain's and Bjornstrom's and
  you'll see the thing more clearly than you can without them; but that would
  be rather a long sort of job, so&mdash;but why, who's this? Somebody coming
  up the drive in a fly, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Crellan replied, looking out of the window. Presently he added,
  "It's Cranley Mellis."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Hewitt, "he won't trouble us for a little. I'll bet you a penny
  cake he goes first by himself to the small staircase and tries that secret
  recess. If you get a little way along the passage you will be able to see
  him; but that will scarcely matter&mdash;I can see you don't guess now what I
  am driving at."</p>

  <p>"I don't in the least."</p>

  <p>"I told you the names of the books in which you could read the matter up;
  but that would be too long for the present purpose. The thing is fairly well
  summarised, I see, in that encyclopaedia there in the corner. I have put a
  marker in volume seven. Do you mind opening it at that place and seeing for
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan, doubtful and bewildered, reached the volume. It opened
  readily, and in the place where it opened lay a blue foolscap envelope. The
  old gentleman took the envelope, drew from it a white paper, stared first at
  the paper, then at Hewitt, then at the paper again, let the volume slide from
  his lap, and gasped,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;it's the will!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, so I thought," said Hewitt, catching the book as it fell. "But don't
  lose this place in the encyclopaedia. Read the name of the article. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan looked absent-mindedly at the title, holding the will before
  him all the time. Then, mechanically, he read aloud the word,
  "Hypnotism."</p>

  <p>"Hypnotism it is," Hewitt answered. "A dangerous and terrible power in the
  hands of an unscrupulous man."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but how? I don't understand it. This&mdash;this is the real
  will, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Look at it; you know best."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan looked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "this certainly is the will. But where did it come from?
  It hasn't been in this book all the time, has it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Didn't I tell you I put it there myself as a marker? But come, you'll
  understand my explanation better if I first read you a few lines from this
  article. See here now:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"'Although hypnotism has power for good when properly
  used by medical men, it is an exceedingly dangerous weapon in the hands of
  the unskilful or unscrupulous. Crimes have been committed by persons who have
  been hypnotised. Just as a person when hypnotised is rendered extremely
  impressionable, and therefore capable of receiving beneficial suggestions, so
  he is nearly as liable to receive suggestions for evil; and it is quite
  possible for an hypnotic subject, while under hypnotic influence, to be
  impressed with the belief that he is to commit some act after the influence
  is removed, and that act he is safe to commit, acting at the time as an
  automaton. Suggestions may be thus made of which the subject, in his
  subsequent uninfluenced moments, has no idea, but which he will proceed to
  carry out automatically at the time appointed. In the case of a complete
  state of hypnotism the subject has subsequently no recollection whatever of
  what has happened. Persons whose will or nerve power has been weakened by
  fear or other similar causes can be hypnotised without consent on their
  part.'</p><br>

  <p>"There now, what do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, do you mean that Miss Garth has been hypnotised
  by&mdash;by&mdash;Cranley Mellis?"</p>

  <p>"I think that is the case; indeed, I am pretty sure of it. Notice, on the
  occasion of each of his last two visits, he was alone with Miss Garth for
  some little time. On the evening following each of those visits she does
  something which she afterwards knows nothing about&mdash;something connected
  with the disappearance of this will, the only thing standing between Mr.
  Mellis and the whole of his uncle's property. Who could have been in a weaker
  nervous state than Miss Garth has been lately? Remember, too, on the visit of
  last Saturday, while Miss Garth says she only showed Mellis to the door, both
  you and the nurse speak of their being gone some little time. Miss Garth must
  have forgotten what took place then, when Mellis hypnotised her, and
  impressed on her the suggestion that she should take Mr. Holford's will that
  night, long after he&mdash;Mellis&mdash;had gone, and when he could not be
  suspected of knowing anything of it. Further, that she should, at that time
  when her movements would be less likely to be observed, secrete that will in
  a place of hiding known only to himself."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear, what a rascal! Do you really think he did that?"</p>

  <p>"Not only that, but I believe he came here yesterday morning while you
  were out to get the will from the recess. The recess, by the bye, I expect he
  discovered by accident on one of his visits (he has been here pretty often, I
  suppose, altogether), and kept the secret in case it might be useful.
  Yesterday, not finding the will there, he hypnotised Miss Garth once again,
  and conveyed the suggestion that, at midnight last night, she should take the
  will from wherever she had put it and pass it to him under the front
  door."</p>

  <p>"What, do you mean it was he you chased across the grounds last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"That is a thing I am pretty certain of. If we had Mr. Mellis's boot here
  we could make sure by comparing it with the piece of paper I cut out, as you
  will remember, in the entrance hall. As we have the will, though, that will
  scarcely be necessary. What he will do now, I expect, will be to go to the
  recess again on the vague chance of the will being there now, after all,
  assuming that his second dose of mesmerism has somehow miscarried. If Miss
  Garth were here he might try his tricks again, and that is why I got you to
  send her out."</p>

  <p>"And where did you find the will?"</p>

  <p>"Now you come to practical details. You will remember that I asked about
  the handyman's toolhouse? Well, I paid it a visit at six o'clock this
  morning, and found therein some very excellent carpenter's tools in a chest.
  I took a selection of them to the small staircase, and took out the tread of
  a stair&mdash;the one that the pivoted framing-plank rested on."</p>

  <p>"And you found the will there?"</p>

  <p>"The will, as I rather expected when I examined the recess last night, had
  slipped down a rather wide crack at the end of the stair timber, which, you
  know, formed, so to speak, the floor of the recess. The fact was, the
  stair-tread didn't quite reach as far as the back of the recess. The opening
  wasn't very distinct to see, but I soon felt it with my fingers. When Miss
  Garth, in her hypnotic condition on Saturday night, dropped the will into the
  recess, it shot straight to the back corner and fell down the slit. That was
  why Mellis found it empty, and why Miss Garth also found it empty on
  returning there last night under hypnotic influence. You observed her
  terrible state of nervous agitation when she failed to carry out the command
  that haunted her. It was frightful. Something like what happens to a suddenly
  awakened somnambulist, perhaps. Anyway, that is all over. I found the will
  under the end of the stair-tread, and here it is. If you will come to the
  small staircase now you shall see where the paper slipped out of sight.
  Perhaps we shall meet Mr. Mellis."</p>

  <p>"He's a scoundrel," said Mr. Crellan. "It's a pity we can't punish
  him."</p>

  <p>"That's impossible, of course. Where's your proof? And if you had any I'm
  not sure that a hypnotist is responsible at law for what his subject does.
  Even if he were, moving a will from one part of the house to another is
  scarcely a legal crime. The explanation I have given you accounts entirely
  for the disturbed manner of Miss Garth in the presence of Mellis. She merely
  felt an indefinite sense of his power over her. Indeed, there is all the
  possibility that, finding her an easy subject, he had already practised his
  influence by way of experiment. A hypnotist, as you will see in the books,
  has always an easier task with a person he has hypnotised before."</p>

  <p>As Hewitt had guessed, in the corridor they met Mr. Mellis. He was a thin,
  dark man of about thirty-five, with large, bony features, and a slight stoop.
  Mr. Crellan glared at him ferociously.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, and what do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mellis looked surprised. "Really, that's a very extraordinary remark,
  Mr. Crellan," he said. "This is my late uncle's house. I might, with at least
  as much reason, ask you what you want."</p>

  <p>"I'm here, sir, as Mr. Holford's executor."</p>

  <p>"Appointed by will?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And is the will in existence?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the fact is&mdash;we couldn't find it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then, what do you mean, sir, by calling yourself an executor with no will
  to warrant you?" interrupted Mellis. "Get out of this house. If there's no
  will, I administrate."</p>

  <p>"But there <i>is</i> a will," roared Mr. Crellan, shaking it in his face.
  "There is a will. I didn't say we hadn't found it yet, did I? There <i>is</i>
  a will, and here it is in spite of all your diabolical tricks, with your
  scoundrelly hypnotism and secret holes, and the rest of it! Get out of this
  place, sir, or I'll have you thrown out of the window!"</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Mr. Mellis shrugged his shoulders with an appearance of perfect
  indifference. "If you've a will appointing you executor it's all right, I
  suppose, although I shall take care to hold you responsible for any
  irregularities. As I don't in the least understand your conduct, unless it is
  due to drink, I'll leave you." And with that he went.</p>

  <p>Mr. Crellan boiled with indignation for a minute, and then turning to
  Hewitt, "I say, I hope it's all right," he said, "connecting him with all
  this queer business?"</p>

  <p>"We shall soon see," replied Hewitt, "if you'll come and look at the
  pivoted plank."</p>

  <p>They went to the small staircase, and Hewitt once again opened the recess.
  Within lay a blue foolscap envelope, which Hewitt picked up. "See," he said,
  "it is torn at the corner. He has been here and opened it. It's a fresh
  envelope, and I left it for him this morning, with the corner gummed down a
  little so that he would have to tear it in opening. This is what was inside,"
  Hewitt added, and laughed aloud as he drew forth a rather crumpled piece of
  white paper. "It was only a childish trick after all," he concluded, "but I
  always liked a small practical joke on occasion." He held out the crumpled
  paper, on which was inscribed in large capital letters the single
  word&mdash;"SOLD."</p>

  <p class="first">I THINK I have recorded in another place Hewitt's frequent
  aphorism that "there is nothing in this world that is at all possible that
  has not happened or is not happening in London." But there are many strange
  happenings in this matter-of-fact country and in these matter-of-fact times
  that occur far enough from London. Fantastic crimes, savage revenges,
  mediaeval superstitions, horrible cruelty, though less in sight, have been no
  more extinguished by the advent of the nineteenth century than have the
  ancient races who practised them in the dark ages. Some of the races have
  become civilized, and some of the savageries are heard of no more. But there
  are survivals in both cases. I say these things having in my mind a
  particular case that came under the personal notice of both Hewitt and
  myself&mdash;an affair that brought one up standing with a gasp and a doubt
  of one's era.</p>

  <p>My good uncle, the Colonel, was not in the habit of gathering large house
  parties at his place at Ratherby, partly because the place was not a great
  one, and partly because the Colonel's gout was. But there was an excellent
  bit of shooting for two or three guns, and even when he was unable to leave
  the house himself, my uncle was always pleased if some good friend were
  enjoying a good day's sport in his territory. As to myself, the good old soul
  was in a perpetual state of offence because I visited him so seldom, though
  whenever my scant holidays fell in a convenient time of the year I was never
  insensible to the attractions of the Ratherby stubble. More than once had I
  sat by the old gentleman when his foot was exceptionally troublesome, amusing
  him with accounts of some of the doings of Martin Hewitt, and more than once
  had my uncle expressed his desire to meet Hewitt himself, and commissioned me
  with an invitation to be presented to Hewitt at the first likely opportunity,
  for a joint excursion to Ratherby. At length I persuaded Hewitt to take a
  fortnight's rest, coincident with a little vacation of my own, and we got
  down to Ratherby within a few days past September the 1st, and before a gun
  had been fired at the Colonel's bit of shooting. The Colonel himself we found
  confined to the house with his foot on the familiar rest, and though
  ourselves were the only guests, we managed to do pretty well together. It was
  during this short holiday that the case I have mentioned arose.</p>

  <p><a id="pic22B"

  </div><br>

  <p>When first I began to record some of the more interesting of Hewitt's
  operations, I think I explained that such cases as I myself had not witnessed
  I should set down in impersonal narrative form, without intruding myself. The
  present case, so far as Hewitt's work was concerned, I saw, but there were
  circumstances which led up to it that we only fully learned afterwards. These
  circumstances, however, I shall put in their proper place&mdash;at the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>The Fosters were a fairly old Ratherby family, of whom Mr. John Foster had
  died by an accident at the age of about forty, leaving a wife twelve years
  younger than himself and three children, two boys and one girl, who was the
  youngest. The boys grew up strong, healthy, out-of-door young ruffians, with
  all the tastes of sportsmen, and all the qualities, good and bad, natural to
  lads of fairly well-disposed character allowed a great deal too much of their
  own way from the beginning.</p>

  <p>Their only real bad quality was an unfortunate knack of bearing malice,
  and a certain savage vindictiveness towards such persons as they chose to
  consider their enemies. With the louts of the village they were at unceasing
  war, and, indeed, once got into serious trouble for peppering the butcher's
  son (who certainly was a great blackguard) with sparrow-shot. At the usual
  time they went to Oxford together, and were fraternally sent down together in
  their second year, after enjoying a spell of rustication in their first. The
  offence was never specifically mentioned about Ratherby, but was rumoured of
  as something particularly outrageous.</p>

  <p>It was at this time, sixteen years or thereabout after the death of their
  father, that Henry and Robert Foster first saw and disliked Mr. Jonas
  Sneathy, a director of penny banks and small insurance offices. He visited
  Ranworth (the Fosters' home) a great deal more than the brothers thought
  necessary, and, indeed, it was not for lack of rudeness on their part that
  Mr. Sneathy failed to understand, as far as they were concerned, his room was
  preferred to his company.</p>

  <p>But their mother welcomed him, and in the end it was announced that Mrs.
  Foster was to marry again, and that after that her name would be Mrs.
  Sneathy.</p>

  <p>Hereupon there were violent scenes at Ranworth. Henry and Robert Foster
  denounced their prospective father-in-law as a fortune-hunter, a snuffler, a
  hypocrite. They did not stop at broad hints as to the honesty of his penny
  banks and insurance offices, and the house straightway became a house of
  bitter strife. The marriage took place, and it was not long before Mr.
  Sneathy's real character became generally obvious. For months he was a model,
  if somewhat sanctimonious husband, and his influence over his wife was
  complete. Then he discovered that her property had been strictly secured by
  her first husband's will, and that, willing as she might be, she was unable
  to raise money for her new husband's benefit, and was quite powerless to pass
  to him any of her property by deed of gift. Hereupon the man's nature showed
  itself. Foolish woman as Mrs. Sneathy might be, she was a loving, indeed, an
  infatuated wife; but Sneathy repaid her devotion by vulgar derision, never
  hesitating to state plainly that he had married her for his own profit, and
  that he considered himself swindled in the result. More, he even proceeded to
  blows and other practical brutality of a sort only devisable by a mean and
  ugly nature. This treatment, at first secret, became open, and in the midst
  of it Mr. Sneathy's penny banks and insurance offices came to a grievous
  smash all at once, and everybody wondered how Mr. Sneathy kept out of
  gaol.</p>

  <p>Keep out of gaol he did, however, for he had taken care to remain on the
  safe side of the law, though some of his co-directors learnt the taste of
  penal servitude. But he was beggared, and lived, as it were, a mere pensioner
  in his wife's house. Here his brutality increased to a frightful extent, till
  his wife, already broken in health in consequence, went in constant fear of
  her life, and Miss Foster passed a life of weeping misery. All her friends'
  entreaties, however, could not persuade Mrs. Sneathy to obtain a legal
  separation from her husband. She clung to him with the excuse&mdash;for it
  was no more&mdash;that she hoped to win him to kindness by submission, and
  with a pathetic infatuation that seemed to increase as her bodily strength
  diminished.</p>

  <p>Henry and Robert, as may be supposed, were anything but silent in these
  circumstances. Indeed, they broke out violently again and again, and more
  than once went near permanently injuring their worthy father-in-law. Once
  especially, when Sneathy, absolutely without provocation, made a motion to
  strike his wife in their presence, there was a fearful scene. The two sprang
  at him like wild beasts, knocked him down and dragged him to the balcony with
  the intention of throwing him out of the window. But Mrs. Sneathy impeded
  them, hysterically imploring them to desist.</p>

  <p>"If you lift your hand to my mother," roared Henry, gripping Sneathy by
  the throat till his fat face turned blue, and banging his head against the
  wall, "if you lift your hand to my mother again I'll chop it off&mdash;I
  will! I'll chop it off and drive it down your throat!"</p>

  <p><a id="pic23A"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"We'll do worse," said Robert, white and frantic with passion, "we'll hang
  you&mdash;hang you to the door! You're a proved liar and thief, and you're
  worse than a common murderer. I'd hang you to the front door for
  twopence!"</p>

  <p>For a few days Sneathy was comparatively quiet, cowed by their violence.
  Then he took to venting redoubled spite on his unfortunate wife, always in
  the absence of her sons, well aware that she would never inform them. On
  their part, finding him apparently better behaved in consequence of their
  attack, they thought to maintain his wholesome terror, and scarcely passed
  him without a menace, taking a fiendish delight in repeating the threats they
  had used during the scene, by way of keeping it present to his mind.</p>

  <p>"Take care of your hands, sir," they would say. "Keep them to yourself,
  or, by George, we'll take 'em off with a billhook!"</p>

  <p>But his revenge for all this Sneathy took unobserved on their mother.
  Truly a miserable household.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, the brothers left home, and went to London by way of
  looking for a profession. Henry began a belated study of medicine, and Robert
  made a pretence of reading for the bar. Indeed, their departure was as much
  as anything a consequence of the earnest entreaty of their sister, who saw
  that their presence at home was an exasperation to Sneathy, and aggravated
  her mother's secret sufferings. They went, therefore; but at Ranworth things
  became worse.</p>

  <p>Little was allowed to be known outside the house, but it was broadly said
  that Mr. Sneathy's behaviour had now become outrageous beyond description.
  Servants left faster than new ones could be found, and gave their late
  employer the character of a raving maniac. Once, indeed, he committed himself
  in the village, attacking with his walking-stick an inoffensive tradesman who
  had accidentally brushed against him, and immediately running home. This
  assault had to be compounded for by a payment of fifty pounds. And then Henry
  and Robert Foster received a most urgent letter from their sister requesting
  their immediate presence at home.</p>

  <p><a id="pic23B"
     name="pic23B"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>They went at once, of course, and the servants' account of what occurred
  was this. When the brothers arrived Mr. Sneathy had just left the house. The
  brothers were shut up with their mother and sister for about a quarter of an
  hour, and then left them and came out to the stable yard together. The
  coachman (he was a new man, who had only arrived the day before) overheard a
  little of their talk as they stood by the door.</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry said that "the thing must be done, and at once. There are two of
  us, so that it ought to be easy enough." And afterwards Mr. Robert said,
  "You'll know best how to go about it, as a doctor." After which Mr. Henry
  came towards the coachman and asked in what direction Mr. Sneathy had gone.
  The coachman replied that it was in the direction of Ratherby Wood, by the
  winding footpath that led through it. But as he spoke he distinctly with the
  corner of his eye saw the other brother take a halter from a hook by the
  stable door and put it into his coat pocket.</p>

  <p>So far for the earlier events, whereof I learned later bit by bit. It was
  on the day of the arrival of the brothers Foster at their old home, and,
  indeed, little more than two hours after the incident last set down, that
  news of Mr. Sneathy came to Colonel Brett's place, where Hewitt and I were
  sitting and chatting with the Colonel. The news was that Mr. Sneathy had
  committed suicide&mdash;had been found hanging, in fact, to a tree in
  Ratherby Wood, just by the side of the footpath.</p>

  <p>Hewitt and I had of course at this time never heard of Sneathy, and the
  Colonel told us what little he knew. He had never spoken to the man, he
  said&mdash;indeed, nobody in the place outside Ranworth would have anything
  to do with him. "He's certainly been an unholy scoundrel over those poor
  people's banks," said my uncle, "and if what they say's true, he's been about
  as bad as possible to his wretched wife. He must have been pretty miserable,
  too, with all his scoundrelism, for he was a completely ruined man, without a
  chance of retrieving his position, and detested by everybody. Indeed, some of
  his recent doings, if what I have heard is to be relied on, have been very
  much those of a madman. So that, on the whole, I'm not much surprised.
  Suicide's about the only crime, I suppose, that he has never experimented
  with till now, and, indeed, it's rather a service to the world at
  large&mdash;his only service, I expect."</p>

  <p>The Colonel sent a man to make further inquiries, and presently this man
  returned with the news that now it was said that Mr. Sneathy had not
  committed suicide, but had been murdered. And hard on the man's heels came
  Mr. Hardwick, a neighbour of my uncle's and a fellow J. P. He had had the
  case reported to him, it seemed, as soon as the body had been found, and had
  at once gone to the spot. He had found the body hanging&mdash;<i>and with the
  right hand cut off</i>.</p>

  <p>"It's a murder, Brett," he said, "without doubt&mdash;a most horrible case
  of murder and mutilation. The hand is cut off and taken away, but whether the
  atrocity was committed before or after the hanging of course I can't say. But
  the missing hand makes it plainly a case of murder, and not suicide. I've
  come to consult you about issuing a warrant, for I think there's no doubt as
  to the identity of the murderers."</p>

  <p>"That's a good job," said the Colonel, "else we should have had some work
  for Mr. Martin' Hewitt here, which wouldn't be fair, as he's taking a rest.
  Whom do you think of having arrested?"</p>

  <p>"The two young Fosters. It's plain as it can be&mdash;and a most revolting
  crime too, bad as Sneathy may have been. They came down from London to-day
  and went out deliberately to it, it's clear. They were heard talking of it,
  asked as to the direction in which he had gone, and followed him&mdash;and
  with a rope."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather an unusual form of murder&mdash;hanging?" Hewitt
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is," Mr. Hardwick replied; "but it's the case here plain
  enough. It seems, in fact, that they had a way of threatening to hang him and
  even to cut off his hand if he used it to strike their mother. So that they
  appear to have carried out what might have seemed mere idle threats in a
  diabolically savage way. Of course they <i>may</i> have strangled him first
  and hanged him after, by way of carrying out their threat and venting their
  spite on the mutilated body. But that they did it is plain enough for me.
  I've spent an hour or two over it, and feel I am certainly more than
  justified in ordering their apprehension. Indeed, they were with him at the
  time, as I have found by their tracks on the footpath through the wood."</p>

  <p>The Colonel turned to Martin Hewitt. "Mr. Hardwick, you must know," he
  said, "is by way of being an amateur in your particular line&mdash;and a very
  good amateur, too, I should say, judging by a case or two I have known in
  this county."</p>

  <p>Hewitt bowed, and laughingly expressed a fear lest Mr. Hardwick should
  come to London and supplant him altogether. "This seems a curious case," he
  added. "If you don't mind, I think I should like to take a glance at the
  tracks and whatever other traces there may be, just by way of keeping my hand
  in."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mr. Hardwick replied, brightening. "I should of all things
  like to have Mr. Hewitt's opinions on the observations I have made&mdash;just
  for my own gratification. As to his opinion&mdash;there can be no room for
  doubt; the thing is plain."</p>

  <p>With many promises not to be late for dinner, we left my uncle and walked
  with Mr. Hardwick in the direction of Ratherby Wood. It was an unfrequented
  part, he told us, and by particular care he had managed, he hoped, to prevent
  the rumour spreading to the village yet, so that we might hope to find the
  trails not yet overlaid. It was a man of his own, he said, who, making a
  short cut through the wood, had come upon the body hanging, and had run
  immediately to inform him. With this man he had gone back, cut down the body,
  and made his observations. He had followed the trail backward to Ranworth,
  and there had found the new coachman, who had once been in his own service.
  From him he had learned the doings of the brothers Foster as they left the
  place, and from him he had ascertained that they had not then returned. Then,
  leaving his man by the body, he had come straight to my uncle's.</p>

  <p>Presently we came on the footpath leading from Ranworth across the field
  to Ratherby Wood. It was a mere trail of bare earth worn by successive feet
  amid the grass. It was damp, and we all stooped and examined the footmarks
  that were to be seen on it. They all pointed one way&mdash;towards the wood
  in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately it's not a greatly frequented path," Mr. Hardwick&mdash;said.
  "You see, there are the marks of three pairs of feet only, and as first
  Sneathy and then both of the brothers came this way, these footmarks must be
  theirs. Which are Sneathy's is plain&mdash;they are these large flat ones. If
  you notice, they are all distinctly visible in the centre of the track,
  showing plainly that they belong to the man who walked alone, which was
  Sneathy. Of the others, the marks of the <i>outside</i> feet&mdash;the left
  on the left side and the right on the right&mdash;are often not visible.
  Clearly they belong to two men walking side by side, and more often than not
  treading, with their outer feet, on the grass at the side. And where these
  happen to drop on the same spot as the marks in the middle they cover them.
  Plainly they are the footmarks of Henry and Robert Foster, made as they
  followed Sneathy. Don't you agree with me Mr. Hewitt?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, that's very plain. You have a better pair of eyes than most
  people, Mr. Hardwick, and a good idea of using them, too. We will go into the
  wood now. As a matter of fact I can pretty clearly distinguish most of the
  other foot-marks&mdash;those on the grass; but that's a matter of much
  training."</p>

  <p>We followed the footpath, keeping on the grass at its side, in case it
  should be desirable to refer again to the foot-tracks. For some little
  distance into the wood the tracks continued as before, those of the brothers
  overlaying those of Sneathy. Then there was a difference. The path here was
  broader and muddy, because of the proximity of trees, and suddenly the outer
  footprints separated, and no more overlay the larger ones in the centre, but
  proceeded at an equal distance on either side of them.</p>

  <p>"See there!" cried Mr. Hardwick, pointing triumphantly to the spot, "this
  is where they overtook him, and walked on either side. The body was found
  only a little farther on&mdash;you could see the place now if the path didn't
  zigzag about so."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Hewitt said nothing, but stooped and examined the tracks at the sides with
  great care and evident thought, spanning the distances between them
  comparatively with his arms. Then he rose and stepped lightly from one mark
  to another, taking care not to tread on the mark itself. "Very good," he said
  shortly on finishing his examination. "We'll go on."</p>

  <p>We went on, and presently came to the place where the body lay. Here the
  ground sloped from the left down towards the right, and a tiny streamlet, a
  mere trickle of a foot or two wide, ran across the path. In rainy seasons it
  was probably wider, for all the earth and clay had been washed away for some
  feet on each side, leaving fiat, bare and very coarse gravel, on which the
  trail was lost. Just beyond this, and to the left, the body lay on a grassy
  knoll under the limb of a tree, from which still depended a part of the cut
  rope. It was not a pleasant sight. The man was a soft, fleshy creature,
  probably rather under than over the medium height, and he lay there, with his
  stretched neck and protruding tongue, a revolting object. His right arm lay
  by his side, and the stump of the wrist was clotted with black blood. Mr.
  Hardwick's man was still in charge, seemingly little pleased with his job,
  and a few yards off stood a couple of countrymen looking on.</p>

  <p>Hewitt asked from which direction these men had come, and having
  ascertained and noticed their footmarks, he asked them to stay exactly where
  they were, to avoid confusing such other tracks as might be seen. Then he
  addressed himself to his examination. "<i>First</i>," he said, glancing up at
  the branch, that was scarce a yard above his head, "this rope has been here
  for some time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Mr. Hardwick replied, "it's an old swing rope. Some children used
  it in the summer, but it got partly cut away, and the odd couple of yards has
  been hanging since."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Hewitt, "then if the Fosters did this they were saved some
  trouble by the chance, and were able to take their halter back with
  them&mdash;and so avoid one chance of detection." He very closely scrutinised
  the top of a tree stump, probably the relic of a tree that had been cut down
  long before, and then addressed himself to the body.</p>

  <p>"When you cut it down," he said, "did it fall in a heap?"</p>

  <p>"No, my man eased it down to some extent."</p>

  <p>"Not on to its face?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. On to its back, just as it is now." Mr Hardwick saw that Hewitt
  was looking at muddy marks on each of the corpse's knees, to one of which a
  small leaf clung, and at one or two other marks of the same sort on the fore
  part of the dress. "That seems to show pretty plainly," he said, "that he
  must have struggled with them and was thrown forward, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt did not reply, but gingerly lifted the right arm by its sleeve. "Is
  either of the brothers Foster left-handed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I think not. Here, Bennett, you have seen plenty of their
  doings&mdash;cricket, shooting, and so on&mdash;do you remember if either is
  left-handed?"</p>

  <p>"Nayther, sir," Mr. Hardwick's man answered. "Both on 'em's
  right-handed."</p>

  <p>Hewitt lifted the lapel of the coat and attentively regarded a small rent
  in it. The dead man's hat lay near, and after a few glances at that, Hewitt
  dropped it and turned his attention to the hair. This was coarse and dark and
  long, and brushed straight back with no parting.</p>

  <p>"This doesn't look very symmetrical, does it?" Hewitt remarked, pointing
  to the locks over the right ear. They were shorter just there than on the
  other side, and apparently very clumsily cut, whereas in every other part the
  hair appeared to be rather well and carefully trimmed. Mr. Hardwick said
  nothing, but fidgeted a little, as though he considered that valuable time
  was being wasted over irrelevant trivialities.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, he spoke. "There's very little to be learned from the
  body, is there?" he said. "I think I'm quite justified in ordering their
  arrest, eh?&mdash;indeed, I've wasted too much time already."</p>

  <p>Hewitt was groping about among some bushes behind the tree from which the
  corpse had been taken. When he answered, he said, "I don't think I should do
  anything of the sort just now, Mr. Hardwick. As a matter of fact, I
  <i>fancy</i>"&mdash;this word with an emphasis&mdash;"that the brothers
  Foster may not have seen this man Sneathy at all to-day."</p>

  <p>"Not seen him? Why, my dear sir, there's no question of it. It's certain,
  absolutely. The evidence is positive. The fact of the threats and of the body
  being found treated so is pretty well enough, I should think. But that's
  nothing&mdash;look at those footmarks. They've walked along with him, one
  each side, without a possible doubt; plainly they were the last people with
  him, in any case. And you don't mean to ask anybody to believe that the dead
  man, even if he hanged himself, cut off his own hand first. Even if you do,
  where's the hand? And even putting aside all these considerations, each a
  complete case in itself, the Fosters <i>must</i> at least have seen the body
  as they came past, and yet nothing has been heard of them yet.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they spread the alarm? They went Straight away in the opposite
  direction from home&mdash;there are their footmarks, which you've not seen
  yet, beyond the gravel."</p>

  <p>Hewitt stepped over to where the patch of clean gravel ceased, at the
  opposite side to that from which we had approached the brook, and there, sure
  enough, were the now familiar footmarks of the brothers leading away from the
  scene of Sneathy's end. "Yes," Hewitt said, "I see them. Of course, Mr.
  Hardwick, you'll do what seems right in your own eyes, and in any case not
  much harm will be done by the arrest beyond a terrible fright for that
  unfortunate family. Nevertheless, if you care for my impression, it is, as I
  have said, that the Fosters have not seen Sneathy to-day."</p>

  <p>"But what about the hand?"</p>

  <p>"As to that I have a conjecture, but as yet it is only a conjecture, and
  if I told it you would probably call it absurd&mdash;certainly you'd
  disregard it, and perhaps quite excusably. The case is a complicated one,
  and, if there is anything at all in my conjecture, one of the most remarkable
  I have ever had to do with. It interests me intensely, and I shall devote a
  little time now to following up the theory I have formed. You have, I
  suppose, already communicated with the police?"</p>

  <p>"I wired to Shopperton at once, as soon as I heard of the matter. It's a
  twelve miles drive, but I wonder the police have not arrived yet. They can't
  be long; I don't know where the village constable has got to, but in any case
  <i>he</i> wouldn't be much good. But as to your idea that the Fosters can't
  be suspected&mdash;well, nobody could respect your opinion, Mr. Hewitt, more
  than myself, but really, just think. The notion's impossible&mdash;fifty-fold
  impossible. As soon as the police arrive I shall have that trail followed and
  the Fosters apprehended. I should be a fool if I didn't."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Hardwick," Hewitt replied; "you'll do what you consider
  your duty, of course, and quite properly, though I <i>would</i> recommend you
  to take another glance at those three trails in the path. I shall take a look
  in this direction." And he turned up by the side of the streamlet, keeping on
  the gravel at its side.</p>

  <p>I followed. We climbed the rising ground, and presently, among the trees,
  came to the place where the little rill emerged from the broken ground in the
  highest part of the wood. Here the clean ground ceased, and there was a large
  patch of wet clayey earth. Several marks left by the feet of cattle were
  there, and one or two human footmarks. Two of these (a pair), the newest and
  the most distinct, Hewitt studied carefully, and measured each direction.</p>

  <p>"Notice these marks," he said. "They may be of importance or they may
  not&mdash;that we shall see. Fortunately they are very distinctive&mdash;the
  right boot is a badly worn one, and a small tag of leather, where the soul is
  damaged, is doubled over and trodden into the soft earth. Nothing could be
  luckier. Clearly they are the most recent footsteps in this
  direction&mdash;from the main road, which lies right ahead, through the rest
  of the wood."</p>

  <p>"Then you think somebody else has been on the scene of the tragedy, beside
  the victim and the brothers?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. But hark; there is a vehicle in the road. Can you see between
  the trees? Yes, it is the police cart. We shall be able to report its arrival
  to Mr. Hardwick as we go down."</p>

  <p><a id="pic25"

  <div align="center">

  </div><br>

  <p>We turned and walked rapidly down the incline to where we had come from.
  Mr. Hardwick and his man were still there, and another rustic had arrived to
  gape. We told Mr. Hardwick that he might expect the police presently, and
  proceeded along the gravel skirting the stream, toward the lower part of the
  wood.</p>

  <p>Here Hewitt proceeded very cautiously, keeping a sharp look-out on either
  side for footprints on the neighbouring soft ground. There were none,
  however, for the gravel margin of the stream made a sort of footpath of
  itself, and the trees and undergrowth were close and thick on each side. At
  the bottom we emerged from the wood on a small piece of open ground skirting
  a lane, and here, just by the side of the lane, where the stream fell into a
  trench, Hewitt suddenly pounced on another footmark. He was unusually
  excited.</p>

  <p>"See," he said, "here it is&mdash;the right foot with its broken leather,
  and the corresponding left foot on the damp edge of the lane itself.
  He&mdash;the man with the broken shoe&mdash;has walked on the hard gravel all
  the way down from the source of the stream, and his is the only trail
  unaccounted for near the body. Come, Brett, we've an adventure on foot. Do
  you care to let your uncle's dinner go by the board, and follow?"</p>

  <p>"Can't we go back and tell him?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;there's no time to lose; we must follow up this man&mdash;or at
  least I must. You go or stay, of course, as you think best."</p>

  <p>I hesitated a moment, picturing to myself the excellent Colonel as he
  would appear after waiting dinner an hour or two for us, but decided to go.
  "At any rate," I said, "if the way lies along the roads we shall probably
  meet somebody going in the direction of Ratherby who will take a message. But
  what is your theory? I don't understand at all. I must say everything
  Hardwick said seemed to me to be beyond question. There were the tracks to
  prove that the three had walked together to the spot, and that the brothers
  had gone on alone; and every other circumstance pointed the same way. Then,
  what possible motive could anybody else about here have for such a crime?
  Unless, indeed, it were one of the people defrauded by Sneathy's late
  companies."</p>

  <p>"The motive," said Hewitt, "is, I fancy, a most
  extraordinary&mdash;indeed, a weird one. A thing as of centuries ago. Ask me
  no questions&mdash;I think you will be a little surprised before very long.
  But come, we must move." And we mended our pace along the lane.</p>

  <p>The lane, by the bye, was hard and firm, with scarcely a spot where a
  track might be left, except in places at the sides; and at these places
  Hewitt never gave a glance. At the end the lane turned into a by-road, and at
  the turning Hewitt stopped and scrutinised the ground closely. There was
  nothing like a recognisable footmark to be seen; but almost immediately
  Hewitt turned off to the right, and we continued our brisk march without a
  glance at the road.</p>

  <p>"How did you judge which way to turn then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you see?" replied Hewitt; "I'll show you at the next turning."</p>

  <p>Half a mile farther on the road forked, and here Hewitt stooped and
  pointed silently to a couple of small twigs, placed crosswise, with the
  longer twig of the two pointing down the branch of the road to the left. We
  took the branch to the left, and went on.</p>

  <p>"Our man's making a mistake," Hewitt observed. "He leaves his friends'
  messages lying about for his enemies to read."</p>

  <p>We hurried forward with scarcely a word. I was almost too bewildered by
  what Hewitt had said and done to formulate anything like a reasonable guess
  as to what our expedition tended, or even to make an effective
  inquiry&mdash;though, after what Hewitt had said, I knew that would be
  useless. Who was this mysterious man with the broken shoe? what had he to do
  with the murder of Sneathy? what did the mutilation mean? and who were his
  friends who left him signs and messages by means of crossed twigs?</p>

  <p>We met a man, by whom I sent a short note to my uncle, and soon after we
  turned into a main road. Here again, at the corner, was the curious message
  of twigs. A cart-wheel had passed over and crushed them, but it had not so
  far displaced them as to cause any doubt that the direction to take was to
  the right. At an inn a little farther along we entered, and Hewitt bought a
  pint of Irish whisky and a flat bottle to hold it in, as well as a loaf of
  bread and some cheese, which we carried away wrapped in paper.</p>

  <p>"This will have to do for our dinner," Hewitt said as we emerged.</p>

  <p>"But we're not going to drink a pint of common whisky between us?" I asked
  in some astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Hewitt answered with a smile. "Perhaps we'll find somebody
  to help us&mdash;somebody not so fastidious as yourself as to quality."</p>

  <p>Now we hurried&mdash;hurried more than ever, for it was beginning to get
  dusk, and Hewitt feared a difficulty in finding and reading the twig signs in
  the dark. Two more turnings we made, each with its silent direction&mdash;the
  crossed twigs. To me there was something almost weird and creepy in this
  curious hunt for the invisible and incomprehensible, guided faithfully and
  persistently at every turn by this now unmistakable signal. After the second
  turning we broke into a trot along a long, winding lane, but presently
  Hewitt's hand fell on my shoulder, and we stopped. He pointed ahead, where
  some large object, round a bend of the hedge was illuminated as though by a
  light from below.</p>

  <p>"We will walk now," Hewitt said. "Remember that we are on a walking tour,
  and have come along here entirely by accident."</p>

  <p>We proceeded at a swinging walk, Hewitt whistling gaily. Soon we turned
  the bend, and saw that the large object was a travelling van drawn up with
  two others on a space of grass by the side of the lane. It was a gipsy
  encampment, the caravan having apparently only lately stopped, for a man was
  still engaged in tugging at the rope of a tent that stood near the vans. Two
  or three sullen-looking ruffians lay about a fire which burned in the space
  left in the middle of the encampment. A woman stood at the door of one van
  with a large kettle in her hand, and at the foot of the steps below her a
  more pleasant-looking old man sat on an inverted pail. Hewitt swung towards
  the fire from the road, and with an indescribable mixture of slouch, bow, and
  smile addressed the company generally with "<i>Kooshto bock, pals</i>!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Good luck, brothers!"]</p>

  <p><a id="pic26"
     name="pic26"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-4-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The men on the ground took no notice, but continued to stare doggedly
  before them. The man working at the tent looked round quickly for a moment,
  and the old man on the bucket looked up and nodded.</p>

  <p>Quick to see the most likely friend, Hewitt at once went up to the old
  man, extending his hand, "<i>Sarshin, daddo</i>!" he said; "<i>Dell mandy
  tooty's varst.</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "How do you do, father? Give me your hand."]</p>

  <p>The old man smiled and shook hands, though without speaking. Then Hewitt
  proceeded, producing the flat bottle of whisky, <i>"Tatty for pawny, chals.
  Dell mandy the pawny, and lell posh the tatty."</i>*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Spirits for water, lads. Give me the water and take
  your share of the spirits."]</p>

  <p>The whisky did it. We were Romany ryes in twenty minutes or less, and had
  already been taking tea with the gipsies for half the time. The two or three
  we had found about the fire were still reserved, but these, I found, were
  only half-gipsies, and understood very little Romany. One or two others,
  however, including the old man, were of purer breed, and talked freely, as
  did one of the women. They were Lees, they said, and expected to be on
  Wirksby racecourse in three days' time. We, too, were <i>pirimengroes</i>, or
  travellers, Hewitt explained, and might look to see them on the course.</p>

  <p>Then he fell to telling gipsy stories, and they to telling others back, to
  my intense mystification. Hewitt explained afterwards that they were mostly
  stories of poaching, with now and again a horse-coping anecdote thrown in.
  Since then I have learned enough of Romany to take my part in such a
  conversation, but at the time a word or two here and there was all I could
  understand. In all this talk the man we had first noticed stretching the
  tent-rope took very little interest, but lay, with his head away from the
  fire, smoking his pipe. He was a much darker man than any other
  present&mdash;had, in fact, the appearance of a man of even a swarthier race
  than that of the others about us.</p>

  <p>Presently, in the middle of a long and, of course, to me unintelligible
  story by the old man, I caught Hewitt's eye. He lifted one eyebrow almost
  imperceptibly, and glanced for a single moment at his walking-stick. Then I
  saw that it was pointed toward the feet of the very dark man, who had not yet
  spoken. One leg was thrown over the others as he lay, with the soles of his
  shoes presented toward the fire, and in its glare I saw&mdash;that the right
  sole was worn and broken, and that a small triangular tag of leather was
  doubled over beneath in just the place we knew of from the prints in Ratherby
  Wood.</p>

  <p>I could not take my eyes off that man with his broken shoe. There lay the
  secret, the whole mystery of the fantastic crime in Ratherby Wood centred in
  that shabby ruffian. What was it?</p>

  <p>But Hewitt went on, talking and joking furiously. The men who were not
  speaking mostly smoked gloomily, but whenever one spoke, he became animated
  and lively. I had attempted once or twice to join in, though my efforts were
  not particularly successful, except in inducing one man to offer me tobacco
  from his box&mdash;tobacco that almost made me giddy in the smell. He tried
  some of mine in exchange, and though he praised it with native politeness,
  and smoked the pipe through, I could see that my Hignett mixture was poor
  stuff in his estimation, compared with the awful tobacco in his own box.</p>

  <p>Presently the man with the broken shoe got up, slouched over to his tent,
  and disappeared. Then said Hewitt (I translate):</p>

  <p>"You're not all Lees here, I see?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, <i>pal</i>, all Lees."</p>

  <p>"But <i>he's</i> not a Lee?" and Hewitt jerked his head towards the
  tent.</p>

  <p>"Why not a Lee, <i>pal</i>? We be Lees, and he is with us. Thus he is a
  Lee."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course. But I know he is from over the <i>pawny</i>. Come,
  I'll guess the <i>tem</i>* he comes from&mdash;it's from Roumania, eh?
  Perhaps the Wallachian part?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Country.]</p>

  <p>The men looked at one another, and then the old Lee said:</p>

  <p>"You're right, <i>pal</i>. You're cleverer than we took you for. That is
  what they calls his <i>tem</i>. He is a <i>petulengro</i>*, and he comes with
  us to shoe the <i>gries</i>** and mend the <i>vardoes</i>***. But he is with
  us, and so he is a Lee."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Smith.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[** Horses.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*** Vans.]</p>

  <p>The talk and the smoke went on, and presently the man with the broken shoe
  returned, and lay down again. Then, when the whisky had all gone, and Hewitt,
  with some excuse that I did not understand, had begged a piece of cord from
  one of the men, we left in a chorus of <i>kooshto rardies</i>*.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Good-night.]</p>

  <p>By this time it was nearly ten o'clock. We walked briskly till we came
  back again to the inn where we had bought the whisky. Here Hewitt, after some
  little trouble, succeeded in hiring a village cart, and while the driver was
  harnessing the horse, cut a couple of short sticks from the hedge. These,
  being each divided into two, made four short, stout pieces of something less
  than six inches long apiece. Then Hewitt joined them together in pairs, each
  pair being connected from centre to centre by about nine or ten inches of the
  cord he had brought from the gipsies' camp. These done, he handed one pair to
  me. "Handcuffs," he explained, "and no bad ones either. See&mdash;you use
  them so." And he passed the cord round my wrist, gripping the two handles,
  and giving them a slight twist that sufficiently convinced me of the
  excruciating pain that might be inflicted by a vigorous turn, and the utter
  helplessness of a prisoner thus secured in the hands of captors prepared to
  use their instruments.</p>

  <p>"Whom are these for?" I asked. "The man with the broken shoe?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I expect we shall find him out alone about midnight. You
  know how to use these now."</p>

  <p>It was fully eleven before the cart was ready and we started. A quarter of
  a mile or so from the gipsy encampment Hewitt stopped the cart and gave the
  driver instructions to wait. We got through the hedge, and made our way on
  the soft ground behind it in the direction of the vans and the tent.</p>

  <p>"Roll up your handkerchief," Hewitt whispered, "into a tight pad. The
  moment I grab him, ram it into his mouth&mdash;<i>well</i> in, mind, so that
  it doesn't easily fall out. Probably he will be stooping&mdash;that will make
  it easier; we can pull him suddenly backward. Now be quiet."</p>

  <p>We kept on till nothing but the hedge divided us from the space whereon
  stood the encampment. It was now nearer twelve o'clock than eleven, but the
  time we waited seemed endless. But time is not eternity after all, and at
  last we heard a move in the tent. A minute after, the man we sought was
  standing before us. He made straight for a gap in the hedge which we had
  passed on our way, and we crouched low and waited. He emerged on our side of
  the hedge with his back towards us, and began walking, as we had walked,
  behind the hedge, but in the opposite direction. We followed.</p>

  <p>He carried something in his hand that looked like a large bundle of sticks
  and twigs, and he appeared to be as anxious to be secret as we ourselves.
  From time to time he stopped and listened; fortunately there was no moon, or
  in turning about, as he did once or twice, he would probably have observed
  us. The field sloped downward just before us, and there was another hedge at
  right angles, leading down to a slight hollow. To this hollow the man made
  his way, and in the shade of the new hedge we followed. Presently he stopped
  suddenly, stooped, and deposited his bundle on the ground before him.
  Crouching before it, he produced matches from his pocket, struck one, and in
  a moment had a fire of twigs and small branches, that sent up a heavy white
  smoke. What all this portended I could not imagine, but a sense of the
  weirdness of the whole adventure came upon me unchecked. The horrible corpse
  in the wood, with its severed wrist, Hewitt's enigmatical forebodings, the
  mysterious tracking of the man with the broken shoe, the scene round the
  gipsies' fire, and now the strange behaviour of this man, whose connection
  with the tragedy was so intimate and yet so inexplicable&mdash;all these
  things contributed to make up a tale of but a few hours' duration, but of an
  inscrutable impressiveness that I began to feel in my nerves.</p>

  <p>The man bent a thin stick double, and using it as a pair of tongs, held
  some indistinguishable object over the flames before him. Excited as I was, I
  could not help noticing that he bent and held the stick with his left hand.
  We crept stealthily nearer, and as I stood scarcely three yards behind him
  and looked over his shoulder, the form of the object stood out clear and
  black against the dull red of the flame. It was a <i>human hand</i>.</p>

  <p>I suppose I may have somehow betrayed my amazement and horror to my
  companion's sharp eyes, for suddenly I felt his hand tightly grip my arm just
  above the elbow. I turned, and found his face close by mine and his finger
  raised warningly. Then I saw him produce his wrist-grip and make a motion
  with his palm toward his mouth, which I understood to be intended to remind
  me of the gag. We stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The man turned his horrible cookery over and over above the crackling
  sticks, as though to smoke and dry it in every part. I saw Hewitt's hand
  reach out toward him, and in a flash we had pulled him back over his heels
  and I had driven the gag between his teeth as he opened his mouth. We seized
  his wrists in the cords at once, and I shall never forget the man's look of
  ghastly, frantic terror as he lay on the ground. When I knew more I
  understood the reason of this.</p>

  <p>Hewitt took both wristholds in one hand and drove the gag entirely into
  the man's mouth, so that he almost choked. A piece of sacking lay near the
  fire, and by Hewitt's request I dropped that awful hand from the wooden twigs
  upon it and rolled it up in a parcel&mdash;it was, no doubt, what the sacking
  had been brought for. Then we lifted the man to his feet and hurried him in
  the direction of the cart. The whole capture could not have occupied thirty
  seconds, and as I stumbled over the rough field at the man's left elbow I
  could only think of the thing as one thinks of a dream that one knows all the
  time <i>is</i> a dream.</p>

  <p>But presently the man, who had been walking quietly, though gasping,
  sniffing and choking because of the tightly rolled handkerchief in his
  mouth&mdash;presently he made a sudden dive, thinking doubtless to get his
  wrists free by surprise. But Hewitt was alert, and gave them a twist that
  made him roll his head with a dismal, stifled yell, and with the opening of
  his mouth, by some chance the gag fell away. Immediately the man roared aloud
  for help.</p>

  <p>"Quick," said Hewitt, "drag him along&mdash;they'll hear in the vans.
  Bring the hand!"</p>

  <p>I seized the fallen handkerchief and crammed it over the man's mouth as
  well as I might, and together we made as much of a trot as we could, dragging
  the man between us, while Hewitt checked any reluctance on his part by a
  timely wrench of the wristholds. It was a hard two hundred and fifty yards to
  the lane even for us&mdash;for the gipsy it must have been a bad minute and a
  half indeed. Once more as we went over the uneven ground he managed to get
  out a shout, and we thought we heard a distinct reply from somewhere in the
  direction of the encampment.</p>

  <p>We pulled him over a stile in a tangle, and dragged and pushed him through
  a small hedge-gap all in a heap. Here we were but a short distance from the
  cart, and into that we flung him without wasting time or tenderness, to the
  intense consternation of the driver, who, I believe, very nearly set up a cry
  for help on his own account. Once in the cart, however, I seized the reins
  and the whip myself and, leaving Hewitt to take care of the prisoner, put the
  turn-out along toward Ratherby at as near ten miles an hour as it could
  go.</p>

  <p>We made first for Mr. Hardwick's, but he, we found, was with my uncle, so
  we followed him. The arrest of the Fosters had been effected, we learned, not
  very long after we had left the wood, as they returned by another route to
  Ranworth. We brought our prisoner into the Colonel's library, where he and
  Mr. Hardwick were sitting.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure what we can charge him with unless it's anatomical
  robbery," Hewitt remarked, "but here's the criminal."</p>

  <p>The man only looked down, with a sulkily impenetrable countenance. Hewitt
  spoke to him once or twice, and at last he said, in a strange accent,
  something that sounded like "<i>kekin jinnavvy</i>."</p>

  <p>"<i>Keck jin</i>?"* asked Hewitt, in the loud, clear tone one
  instinctively adopts in talking to a foreigner, "<i>Keckeno jinny</i>?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Not understand?"]</p>

  <p>The man understood and shook his head, but not another word would he say
  or another question answer.</p>

  <p>"He's a foreign gipsy," Hewitt explained, "just as I thought&mdash;a
  Wallachian, in fact. Theirs is an older and purer dialect than that of the
  English gipsies, and only some of the root-words are alike. But I think we
  can make him explain to-morrow that the Fosters at least had nothing to do
  with, at any rate, cutting off Sneathy's hand. Here it is, I think." And he
  gingerly lifted the folds of sacking from the ghastly object as it lay on the
  table, and then covered it up again.</p>

  <p>"But what&mdash;what does it all mean?" Mr. Hardwick said in bewildered
  astonishment. "Do you mean this man was an accomplice?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all&mdash;the case was one of suicide, as I think you'll agree,
  when I've explained. This man simply found the body hanging and stole the
  hand."</p>

  <p>"But what in the world for?"</p>

  <p>"For the HAND OF GLORY. Eh?" He turned to the gipsy and pointed to the
  hand on the table: "<i>Yag-varst</i>* eh?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Fire-hand.]</p>

  <p>There was a quick gleam of intelligence in the man's eye, but he said
  nothing. As for myself I was more than astounded. Could it be possible that
  the old superstition of the Hand of Glory remained alive in a practical shape
  at this day?</p>

  <p>"You know the superstition, of course," Hewitt said. "It did exist in this
  country in the last century, when there were plenty of dead men hanging at
  cross-roads, and so on. On the Continent, in some places, it has survived
  later. Among the Wallachian gipsies it has always been a great article of
  belief, and the superstition is quite active still. The belief is that the
  right hand of a hanged man, cut off and dried over the smoke of certain wood
  and herbs, and then provided with wicks at each finger made of the dead man's
  hair, becomes, when lighted at each wick (the wicks are greased, of course),
  a charm, whereby a thief may walk without hinderance where he pleases in a
  strange house, push open all doors and take what he likes. Nobody can stop
  him, for everybody the Hand of Glory approaches is made helpless, and can
  neither move nor speak. You may remember there was some talk of 'thieves'
  candles' in connection with the horrible series of Whitechapel murders not
  long ago. That is only one form of the cult of the Hand of Glory."</p>

  <p>"Yes," my uncle said; "I remember reading so. There is a story about it in
  the Ingoldsby Legends, too, I believe."</p>

  <p>"There is&mdash;it is called 'The Hand of Glory,' in fact. You remember
  the spell, 'Open lock to the dead man's knock,' and so on. But I think you'd
  better have the constable up and get this man into safe quarters for the
  night. He should be searched, of course. I expect they will find on him the
  hair I noticed to have been cut from Sneathy's head."</p>

  <p>The village constable arrived with his iron handcuffs in substitution for
  those of cord which had so sorely vexed the wrists of our prisoner, and
  marched him away to the little lock-up on the green.</p>

  <p>Then my uncle and Mr. Hardwick turned on Martin Hewitt with doubts and
  many questions:</p>

  <p>"Why do you call it suicide?" Mr. Hardwick asked. "It is plain the Fosters
  were with him at the time from the tracks. Do you mean to say that they stood
  there and watched Sneathy hang himself without interfering?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Hewitt replied, lighting a cigar. "I think I told you that
  they never saw Sneathy."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you did, and of course that's what they said themselves when they
  were arrested. But the thing's impossible. Look at the tracks!"</p>

  <p>"The tracks are exactly what revealed to me that it was <i>not</i>
  impossible," Hewitt returned. "I'll tell you how the case unfolded itself to
  me from the beginning. As to the information you gathered from the Ranworth
  coachman, to begin with. The conversation between the Fosters which he
  overheard might well mean something less serious than murder. What did they
  say? They had been sent for in a hurry and had just had a short consultation
  with their mother and sister. Henry said that 'the thing must be done at
  once'; also that as there were two of them it should be easy. Robert said
  that Henry, as a doctor, would know best what to do.</p>

  <p>"Now you, Colonel Brett, had been saying&mdash;before we learned these
  things from Mr. Hardwick&mdash;that Sneathy's behaviour of late had become so
  bad as to seem that of a madman. Then there was the story of his sudden
  attack on a tradesman in the village, and equally sudden running
  away&mdash;exactly the sort of impulsive, wild thing that madmen do. Why then
  might it not be reasonable to suppose that Sneathy <i>had</i> become
  mad&mdash;more especially considering all the circumstances of the case, his
  commercial ruin and disgrace and his horrible life with his wife and her
  family?&mdash;had become suddenly much worse and quite uncontrollable, so
  that the two wretched women left alone with him were driven to send in haste
  for Henry and Robert to help them? That would account for all.</p>

  <p>"The brothers arrive just after Sneathy had gone out. They are told in a
  hurried interview how affairs stand, and it is decided that Sneathy must be
  at once secured and confined in an asylum before something serious happens.
  He has just gone out&mdash;something terrible may be happening at this
  moment. The brothers determine to follow at once and secure him wherever he
  may be. Then the meaning of their conversation is plain. The thing that 'must
  be done, and at once,' is the capture of Sneathy and his confinement in an
  asylum. Henry, as a doctor, would 'know what to do' in regard to the
  necessary formalities. And they took a halter in case a struggle should ensue
  and it were found necessary to bind him. Very likely, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Mr. Hardwick replied, "it certainly is. It never struck me in
  that light at all."</p>

  <p>"That was because you believed, to begin with, that a murder had been
  committed, and looked at the preliminary circumstances which you learned
  after in the light of your conviction. But now, to come to my actual
  observations. I saw the footmarks across the fields, and agreed with you (it
  was indeed obvious) that Sneathy had gone that way first, and that the
  brothers had followed, walking over his tracks. This state of the tracks
  continued until well into the wood, when suddenly the tracks of the brothers
  opened out and proceeded on each side of Sneathy's. The simple inference
  would seem to be, of course, the one you made&mdash;that the Fosters had here
  overtaken Sneathy, and walked one at each side of him.</p>

  <p>"But of this I felt by&mdash;no means certain. Another very simple
  explanation was available, which might chance to be the true one. It was just
  at the spot where the brothers' tracks separated that the path became
  suddenly much muddier, because of the closer overhanging of the trees at the
  spot. The path was, as was to be expected, wettest in the middle. It would be
  the most natural thing in the world for two well-dressed young men, on
  arriving here, to separate so as to walk one on each side of the mud in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, a man in Sneathy's state (assuming him, for the
  moment, to be mad and contemplating suicide) would walk straight along the
  centre of the path, taking no note of mud or anything else. I examined all
  the tracks very carefully, and my theory was confirmed. The feet of the
  brothers had everywhere alighted in the driest spots, and the steps were of
  irregular lengths&mdash;which meant, of course, that they were picking their
  way; while Sneathy's footmarks had never turned aside even for the dirtiest
  puddle. Here, then, were the rudiments of a theory.</p>

  <p>"At the watercourse, of course, the footmarks ceased, because of the hard
  gravel. The body lay on a knoll at the left&mdash;a knoll covered with grass.
  On this the signs of footmarks were almost undiscoverable, although I am
  often able to discover tracks in grass that are invisible to others. Here,
  however, it was almost useless to spend much time in examination, for you and
  your man had been there, and what slight marks there might be would be
  indistinguishable one from another.</p>

  <p>"Under the branch from which the man had hung there was an old tree stump,
  with a flat top, where the tree had been sawn off. I examined this, and it
  became fairly apparent that Sneathy had stood on it when the rope was about
  his neck&mdash;his muddy footprint was plain to see; the mud was not smeared
  about, you see, as it probably would have been if he had been stood there
  forcibly and pushed off. It was a simple, clear footprint&mdash;another hint
  at suicide.</p>

  <p>"But then arose the objection that you mentioned yourself. Plainly the
  brothers Foster were following Sneathy, and came this way. Therefore, if he
  hanged himself before they arrived, it would seem that they must have come
  across the body. But now I examined the body itself. There was mud on the
  knees, and clinging to one knee was a small leaf. It was a leaf corresponding
  to those on the bush behind the tree, and it was not a dead leaf, so must
  have been just detached.</p>

  <p>"After my examination of the body I went to the bush, and there, in the
  thick of it, were, for me, sufficiently distinct knee-marks, in one of which
  the knee had crushed a spray of the bush against the ground, and from that
  spray a leaf was missing. Behind the knee-marks were the indentations of
  boot-toes in the soft, bare earth under the bush, and thus the thing was
  plain. The poor lunatic had come in sight of the dangling rope, and the
  temptation to suicide was irresistible. To people in a deranged state of mind
  the mere sight of the means of self-destruction is often a temptation
  impossible to withstand. But at that moment he must have heard the
  steps&mdash;probably the voices&mdash;of the brothers behind him on the
  winding path. He immediately hid in the bush till they had passed. It is
  probable that seeing who the men were, and conjecturing that they were
  following him&mdash;thinking also, perhaps, of things that had occurred
  between them and himself&mdash;his inclination to self-destruction became
  completely ungovernable, with the result that you saw.</p>

  <p><a id="pic28"
     name="pic28"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"But before I inspected the bush I noticed one or two more things about
  the body. You remember I inquired if either of the brothers Foster was
  left-handed, and was assured that neither was. But clearly the hand had been
  cut off by a left-handed man, with a large, sharply pointed knife. For well
  away to the <i>right</i> of where the wrist had hung the knife-point had made
  a tiny triangular rent in the coat, so that the hand must have been held in
  the mutilator's right hand, while he used the knife with his
  left&mdash;clearly a left-handed man.</p>

  <p>"But most important of all about the body was the jagged hair over the
  right ear. Everywhere else the hair was well cut and orderly&mdash;here it
  seemed as though a good piece had been, so to speak, <i>sawn</i> off. What
  could anybody want with a dead man's right hand and certain locks of his
  hair? Then it struck me suddenly&mdash;the man was hanged; it was the Hand of
  Glory!</p>

  <p>"Then you will remember I went, at your request, to see the footprints of
  the Fosters on the part of the path <i>past</i> the watercourse. Here again
  it was muddy in the middle, and the two brothers had walked as far apart as
  before, although nobody had walked between them. A final proof, if one were
  needed, of my theory as to the three lines of footprints.</p>

  <p>"Now I was to consider how to get at the man who had taken his hand. He
  should be punished for the mutilation, but beyond that he would be required
  as a witness. Now all the foot-tracks in the vicinity had been accounted for.
  There were those of the brothers and of Sneathy, which we have been speaking
  of; those of the rustics looking on, which, however, stopped a little way
  off, and did not interfere with our sphere of observation; those of your man,
  who had cut straight through the wood when he first saw the body, and had
  come back the same way with you; and our own, which we had been careful to
  keep away from the others. Consequently there was <i>no</i> track of the man
  who had cut off the hand; therefore it was certain that he must have come
  along the hard gravel by the watercourse, for that was the only possible path
  which would not tell the tale. Indeed, it seemed quite a likely path through
  the wood for a passenger to take, coming from the high ground by the
  Shopperton road.</p>

  <p>"Brett and I left you and traversed the watercourse, both up and down. We
  found a footprint at the top, left lately by a man with a broken shoe. Right
  down to the bottom of the watercourse where it emerged from the wood there
  was no sign on either side of this man having left the gravel. (Where the
  body was, as you will remember, he would simply have stepped off the gravel
  on to the grass, which I thought it useless to examine, as I have explained.)
  But at the bottom, by the lane, the footprint appeared again.</p>

  <p>"This then was the direction in which I was to search for a left-handed
  man with a broken-soled shoe, probably a gipsy&mdash;and most probably a
  foreign gipsy&mdash;because a foreign gipsy would be the most likely still to
  hold the belief in the Hand of Glory. I conjectured the man to be a straggler
  from a band of gipsies&mdash;one who probably had got behind the caravan and
  had made a short cut across the wood after it; so at the end of the lane I
  looked for a <i>patrin</i>. This is a sign that gipsies leave to guide
  stragglers following up. Sometimes it is a heap of dead leaves, sometimes a
  few stones, sometimes a mark on the ground, but more usually a couple of
  twigs crossed, with the longer twig pointing the road.</p>

  <p>"Guided by these <i>patrins</i> we came in the end on the gipsy camp just
  as it was settling down for the night. We made ourselves agreeable (as Brett
  will probably describe to you better than I can), we left them, and after
  they had got to sleep we came back and watched for the gentleman who is now
  in the lock-up. He would, of course, seize the first opportunity of treating
  his ghastly trophy in the prescribed way, and I guessed he would choose
  midnight, for that is the time the superstition teaches that the hand should
  be prepared. We made a few small preparations, collared him, and now you've
  got him. And I should think the sooner you let the brothers Foster go the
  better."</p>

  <p>"But why didn't you tell me all the conclusions you had arrived at at the
  time?" asked Mr. Hardwick.</p>

  <p>"Well, really," Hewitt replied, with a quiet smile, "you were so positive,
  and some of the traces I relied on were so small, that it would probably have
  meant a long argument and a loss of time. But more than that, confess, if I
  had told you bluntly that Sneathy's hand had been taken away to make a
  mediaeval charm to enable a thief to pass through a locked door and steal
  plate calmly under the owner's nose, what would you have said?"</p>

  <p>"Well, well, perhaps I <i>should</i> have been a little sceptical.
  Appearances combined so completely to point to the Fosters as murderers that
  any other explanation almost would have seemed unlikely to me, and
  <i>that</i>&mdash;well no, I confess, I shouldn't have believed in it. But it
  is a startling thing to find such superstitions alive now-a-days."</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps it is. Yet we find survivals of the sort very frequently.
  The Wallachians, however, are horribly superstitious still&mdash;the gipsies
  among them are, of course, worse. Don't you remember the case reported a few
  months ago, in which a child was drowned as a sacrifice in Wallachia in order
  to bring rain? And that was not done by gipsies either. Even in England, as
  late as 1865, a poor paralysed Frenchman was killed by being 'swum' for
  witchcraft&mdash;that was in Essex. And less atrocious cases of belief in
  wizardry occur again and again even now."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Hardwick and my uncle fell into a discussion as to how the gipsy
  in the lock-up could be legally punished. Mr. Hardwick thought it should be
  treated as a theft of a portion of a dead body, but my uncle fancied there
  was a penalty for mutilation of a dead body <i>per se</i>, though he could
  not point to the statute. As it happened, however, they were saved the
  trouble of arriving at a decision, for in the morning he was discovered to
  have escaped. He had been left, of course, with free hands, and had occupied
  the night in wrenching out the bars at the top of the back wall of the little
  prison-shed (it had stood on the green for a hundred and fifty years) and
  climbing out. He was not found again, and a month or two later the Foster
  family left the district entirely.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story5"
     id="story5"></a>V. &mdash; THE CASE OF LAKER, ABSCONDED</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, May 1895</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE were several of the larger London banks and insurance
  offices from which Hewitt held a sort of general retainer as detective
  adviser, in fulfilment of which he was regularly consulted as to the measures
  to be taken in different cases of fraud, forgery, theft, and so forth, which
  it might be the misfortune of the particular firms to encounter. The more
  important and intricate of these cases were placed in his hands entirely,
  with separate commissions, in the usual way. One of the most important
  companies of the sort was the General Guarantee Society, an insurance
  corporation which, among other risks, took those of the integrity of
  secretaries, clerks, and cashiers. In the case of a cash-box elopement on the
  part of any person guaranteed by the society, the directors were naturally
  anxious for a speedy capture of the culprit, and more especially of the
  booty, before too much of it was spent, in order to lighten the claim upon
  their funds, and in work of this sort Hewitt was at times engaged, either in
  general advice and direction or in the actual pursuit of the plunder and the
  plunderer.</p>

  <p>Arriving at his office a little later than usual one morning, Hewitt found
  an urgent message awaiting him from the General Guarantee Society, requesting
  his attention to a robbery which had taken place on the previous day. He had
  gleaned some hint of the case from the morning paper, wherein appeared a
  short paragraph, which ran thus:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">SERIOUS BANK ROBBERY.&mdash;In the course of yesterday a
  clerk employed by Messrs Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle, the well-known bankers,
  disappeared, having in his possession a large sum of money, the property of
  his employers&mdash;a sum reported to be rather over 15,000. It would seem
  that he had been entrusted to collect the money in his capacity of
  'walk-clerk' from various other banks and trading concerns during the
  morning, but failed to return at the usual time. A large number of the notes
  which he received had been cashed at the Bank of England before suspicion was
  aroused. We understand that Detective-Inspector Plummer, of Scotland Yard,
  has the case in hand.</p><br>

  <p>The clerk, whose name was Charles William Laker, had, it appeared from the
  message, been guaranteed in the usual way by the General Guarantee Society,
  and Hewitt's presence at the office was at once desired in order that steps
  might quickly be taken for the man's apprehension and in the recovery, at any
  rate, of as much of the booty as possible.</p>

  <p>A smart hansom brought Hewitt to Threadneedle Street in a bare quarter of
  an hour, and there a few minutes' talk with the manager, Mr Lyster, put him
  in possession of the main facts of the case, which appeared to be simple.
  Charles William Laker was twenty-five years of age, and had been in the
  employ of Messrs Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle for something more than seven
  years&mdash;since he left school, in fact&mdash;and until the previous day
  there had been nothing in his conduct to complain of. His duties as
  walk-clerk consisted in making a certain round, beginning at about half-past
  ten each morning. There were a certain number of the more important banks
  between which and Messrs Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle there were daily
  transactions, and a few smaller semi-private banks and merchant firms acting
  as financial agents with whom there was business intercourse of less
  importance and regularity; and each of these, as necessary, he visited in
  turn, collecting cash due on bills and other instruments of a like nature. He
  carried a wallet, fastened securely to his person by a chain, and this wallet
  contained the bills and the cash. Usually at the end of his round, when all
  his bills had been converted into cash, the wallet held very large sums. His
  work and responsibilities, in fine, were those common to walk-clerks in all
  banks.</p>

  <p>On the day of the robbery he had started out as usual&mdash;possibly a
  little earlier than was customary&mdash;and the bills and other securities in
  his possession represented considerably more than 15,000.</p>

  <p><a id="pic29"
     name="pic29"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-5-1.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>It had been ascertained that he had called in the usual way at each
  establishment on the round, and had transacted his business at the last place
  by about a quarter-past one, being then, without doubt, in possession of cash
  to the full value of the bills negotiated. After that, Mr Lyster said,
  yesterday's report was that nothing more had been heard of him. But this
  morning there had been a message to the effect that he had been traced out of
  the country&mdash;to Calais, at least, it was thought. The directors of the
  society wished Hewitt to take the case in hand personally and at once, with a
  view of recovering what was possible from the plunder by way of salvage;
  also, of course, of finding Laker, for it is an important moral gain to
  guarantee societies, as an example, if a thief is caught and punished.
  Therefore Hewitt and Mr Lyster, as soon as might be, made for Messrs Liddle,
  Neal &amp; Liddle's, that the investigation might be begun.</p>

  <p>The bank premises were quite near&mdash;in Leadenhall Street. Having
  arrived there, Hewitt and Mr Lyster made their way to the firm's private
  rooms. As they were passing an outer waiting-room, Hewitt noticed two women.
  One, the elder, in widow's weeds, was sitting with her head bowed in her hand
  over a small writing-table. Her face was not visible, but her whole attitude
  was that of a person overcome with unbearable grief; and she sobbed quietly.
  The other was a young woman of twenty-two or twenty-three. Her thick black
  veil revealed no more than that her features were small and regular and that
  her face was pale and drawn. She stood with a hand on the elder woman's
  shoulder, and she quickly turned her head away as the two men entered.</p>

  <p>Mr Neal, one of the partners, received them in his own room.
  'Good-morning, Mr Hewitt,' he said, when Mr Lyster had introduced the
  detective. 'This is a serious business&mdash;very. I think I am sorrier for
  Laker himself than for anybody else, ourselves included&mdash;or, at any
  rate, I am sorrier for his mother. She is waiting now to see Mr Liddle, as
  soon as he arrives&mdash;Mr Liddle has known the family for a long time. Miss
  Shaw is with her, too, poor girl. She is a governess, or something of that
  sort, and I believe she and Laker were engaged to be married. It's all very
  sad.'</p>

  <p>'Inspector Plummer, I understand,' Hewitt remarked, 'has the affair in
  hand, on behalf of the police?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Mr Neal replied; 'in fact, he's here now, going through the
  contents of Laker's desk, and so forth; he thinks it possible Laker may have
  had accomplices. Will you see him?'</p>

  <p>'Presently. Inspector Plummer and I are old friends. We met last, I think,
  in the case of the Stanway cameo, some months ago. But, first, will you tell
  me how long Laker has been a walk-clerk?'</p>

  <p>'Barely four months, although he has been with us altogether seven years.
  He was promoted to the walk soon after the beginning of the year.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know anything of his habits&mdash;what he used to do in his spare
  time, and so forth?'</p>

  <p>'Not a great deal. He went in for boating, I believe, though I have heard
  it whispered that he had one or two more expensive tastes&mdash;expensive,
  that is, for a young man in his position,' Mr Neal explained, with a
  dignified wave of the hand that he peculiarly affected. He was a stout old
  gentleman, and the gesture suited him.</p>

  <p>'You have had no reason to suspect him of dishonesty before, I take
  it?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. He made a wrong return once, I believe, that went for some time
  undetected, but it turned out, after all, to be a clerical error&mdash;a mere
  clerical error.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know anything of his associates out of the office?'</p>

  <p>'No, how should I? I believe Inspector Plummer has been making inquiries
  as to that, however, of the other clerks. Here he is, by the bye, I expect.
  Come in!'</p>

  <p>It was Plummer who had knocked, and he came in at Mr Neal's call. He was a
  middle-sized, small-eyed, impenetrable-looking man, as yet of no great
  reputation in the force. Some of my readers may remember his connection with
  that case, so long a public mystery, that I have elsewhere fully set forth
  and explained under the title of 'The Stanway Cameo Mystery'. Plummer carried
  his billy-cock hat in one hand and a few papers in the other. He gave Hewitt
  good-morning, placed his hat on a chair, and spread the papers on the
  table.</p>

  <p>'There's not a great deal here,' he said, 'but one thing's
  plain&mdash;Laker had been betting. See here, and here, and here'&mdash;he
  took a few letters from the bundle in his hand&mdash;'two letters from a
  bookmaker about settling&mdash;wonder he trusted a clerk&mdash;several
  telegrams from tipsters, and a letter from some friend&mdash;only signed by
  initials&mdash;asking Laker to put a sovereign on a horse for the friend
  "with his own." I'll keep these, I think. It may be worth while to see that
  friend, if we can find him. Ah, we often find it's betting, don't we, Mr
  Hewitt? Meanwhile, there's no news from France yet.'</p>

  <p>'You are sure that is where he is gone?' asked Hewitt.</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll tell you what we've done as yet. First, of course, I went
  round to all the banks. There was nothing to be got from that. The cashiers
  all knew him by sight, and one was a personal friend of his. He had called as
  usual, said nothing in particular, cashed his bills in the ordinary way, and
  finished up at the Eastern Consolidated Bank at about a quarter-past one. So
  far there was nothing whatever. But I had started two or three men meanwhile
  making inquiries at the railway stations, and so on. I had scarcely left the
  Eastern Consolidated when one of them came after me with news. He had tried
  Palmer's Tourist Office, although that seemed an unlikely place, and there
  struck the track.'</p>

  <p>'Had he been there?'</p>

  <p>'Not only had he been there, but he had taken a tourist ticket for France.
  It was quite a smart move, in a way. You see it was the sort of ticket that
  lets you do pretty well what you like; you have the choice of two or three
  different routes to begin with, and you can break your journey where you
  please, and make all sorts of variations. So that a man with a ticket like
  that, and a few hours' start, could twist about on some remote branch route,
  and strike off in another direction altogether, with a new ticket, from some
  out-of-the-way place, while we were carefully sorting out and inquiring along
  the different routes he <i>might</i> have taken. Not half a bad move for a
  new hand; but he made one bad mistake, as new hands always do&mdash;as old
  hands do, in fact, very often. He was fool enough to give his own name, C.
  Laker! Although that didn't matter much, as the description was enough to fix
  him.</p>

  <p>There he was, wallet and all, just as he had come from the Eastern
  Consolidated Bank. He went straight from there to Palmer's, by the bye, and
  probably in a cab. We judge that by the time. He left the Eastern
  Consolidated at a quarter-past one, and was at Palmer's by
  twenty-five-past&mdash;ten minutes. The clerk at Palmer's remembered the time
  because he was anxious to get out to his lunch, and kept looking at the
  clock, expecting another clerk in to relieve him. Laker didn't take much in
  the way of luggage, I fancy. We inquired carefully at the stations, and got
  the porters to remember the passengers for whom they had been carrying
  luggage, but none appeared to have had any dealings with our man. That, of
  course, is as one would expect. He'd take as little as possible with him, and
  buy what he wanted on the way, or when he'd reached his hiding-place. Of
  course, I wired to Calais (it was a Dover to Calais route ticket) and sent a
  couple of smart men off by the 8.15 mail from Charing Cross. I expect we
  shall hear from them in the course of the day. I am being kept in London in
  view of something expected at headquarters, or I should have been off
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'That is all, then, up to the present? Have you anything else in
  view?'</p>

  <p>'That', all I've absolutely ascertained at present. As for what I'm going
  to do'&mdash;a slight smile curled Plummer's lip&mdash;' well, I shall see.
  I've a thing or two in my mind.'</p>

  <p>Hewitt smiled slightly himself; he recognized Plummer's touch of
  professional jealousy. 'Very well,' he said, rising, 'I'll make an inquiry or
  two for myself at once. Perhaps, Mr Neal, you'll allow one of your clerks to
  show me the banks, in their regular order, at which Laker called yesterday. I
  think I'll begin at the beginning.'</p>

  <p>Mr Neal offered to place at Hewitt's disposal anything or anybody the bank
  contained, and the conference broke up. As Hewitt, with the clerk, came
  through the rooms separating Mr Neal's sanctum from the outer office, lie
  fancied he saw the two veiled women leaving by a side door.</p>

  <p>The first bank was quite close to Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle's. There the
  cashier who had dealt with Laker the day before remembered nothing in
  particular about the interview. Many other walk-clerks had called during the
  morning, as they did every morning, and the only circumstances of the visit
  that he could say anything definite about were those recorded in figures in
  the books. He did not know Laker's name till Plummer had mentioned it in
  making inquiries on the previous afternoon. As far as he could remember,
  Laker behaved much as usual, though really he did not notice much; he looked
  chiefly at the bills. He described Laker in a way that corresponded with the
  photograph that Hewitt had borrowed from the bank; a young man with a brown
  moustache and ordinary-looking fairly regular face, dressing much as other
  clerks dressed&mdash;tall hat, black cutaway coat, and so on. The numbers of
  the notes handed over had already been given to Inspector Plummer, and these
  Hewitt did not trouble about.</p>

  <p>The next bank was in Cornhill, and here the cashier was a personal friend
  of Laker's&mdash;at any rate, an acquaintance&mdash;and he remembered a
  little more. Laker's manner had been quite as usual, he said; certainly he
  did not seem preoccupied or excited in his manner. He spoke for a moment or
  two&mdash;of being on the river on Sunday, and so on&mdash;and left in his
  usual way.</p>

  <p>'Can you remember <i>everything</i> he said?' Hewitt asked. 'If you can
  tell me, I should like to know exactly what he did and said to the smallest
  particular.'</p>

  <p>'Well, he saw me a little distance off&mdash;I was behind there, at one of
  the desks&mdash;and raised his hand to me, and said, "How d'ye do?" I came
  across and took his bills, and dealt with them in the usual way. He had a new
  umbrella lying on the counter&mdash;rather a handsome umbrella&mdash;and I
  made a remark about the handle. He took it up to show me, and told me it was
  a present he had just received from a friend. It was a gorse-root handle,
  with two silver bands, one with his monogram, C.W.L. I said it was a very
  nice handle, and asked him whether it was fine in his district on Sunday. He
  said he had been up the river, and it was very fine there. And I think that
  was all.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you. Now about this umbrella. Did he carry it rolled? Can you
  describe it in detail?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've told you about the handle, and the rest was much as usual, I
  think; it wasn't rolled&mdash;just napping loosely, you know. It was rather
  an odd-shaped handle, though. I'll try and sketch it, if you like, as well as
  I can remember.' He did so, and Hewitt saw in the result rough indications of
  a gnarled crook, with one silver band near the end, and another, with the
  monogram, a few inches down the handle. Hewitt put the sketch in his pocket,
  and bade the cashier good-day.</p>

  <p>At the next bank the story was the same as at the first&mdash;there was
  nothing remembered but the usual routine. Hewitt and the clerk turned down a
  narrow paved court, and through into Lombard Street for the next visit. The
  bank&mdash;that of Buller, Clayton, Ladds &amp; Co.&mdash;was just at the
  corner at the end of the court, and the imposing stone entrance-porch was
  being made larger and more imposing still, the way being almost blocked by
  ladders and scaffold-poles. Here there was only the usual tale, and so on
  through the whole walk. The cashiers knew Laker only by sight, and that not
  always very distinctly. The calls of walk-clerks were such matters of routine
  that little note was taken of the persons of the clerks themselves, who were
  called by the names of their firms, if they were called by any names at all.
  Laker had behaved much as usual, so far as the cashiers could remember, and
  when finally the Eastern Consolidated was left behind, nothing more had been
  learnt than the chat about Laker's new umbrella.</p>

  <p>Hewitt had taken leave of Mr Neal's clerk, and was stepping into a hansom,
  when he noticed a veiled woman in widow's weeds hailing another hansom a
  little way behind. He recognized the figure again, and said to the driver:
  'Drive fast to Palmer's Tourist Office, but keep your eye on that cab behind,
  and tell me presently if it is following us.'</p>

  <p><a id="pic31"
     name="pic31"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-5-3.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The cabman drove off, and after passing one or two turnings, opened the
  lid above Hewitt's head, and said: 'That there other keb <i>is</i>
  a-follerin' us, sir, an' keepin' about even distance all along.'</p>

  <p>'All right; that's what I wanted to know. Palmer's now.' At Palmer's the
  clerk who had attended to Laker remembered him very well and described him.
  He also remembered the wallet, and <i>thought</i> he remembered the
  umbrella&mdash;was practically sure of it, in fact, upon reflection. He had
  no record of the name given, but remembered it distinctly to be Laker. As a
  matter of fact, names were never asked in such a transaction, but in this
  case Laker appeared to be ignorant of the usual procedure, as well as in a
  great hurry, and asked for the ticket and gave his name all in one breath,
  probably assuming that the name would be required.</p>

  <p>Hewitt got back to his cab, and started for Charing Cross. The cabman once
  more lifted the lid and informed him that the hansom with the veiled woman in
  it was again following, having waited while Hewitt had visited Palmer's. At
  Charing Cross Hewitt discharged his cab and walked straight to the lost
  property office. The man in charge knew him very well, for his business had
  carried him there frequently before.</p>

  <p>'I fancy an umbrella was lost in the station yesterday,' Hewitt said. 'It
  was a new umbrella, silk, with a gnarled gorse-root handle and two silver
  bands, something like this sketch. There was a monogram on the lower
  band&mdash;"C. W. L." were the letters. Has it been brought here?'</p>

  <p>'There was two or three yesterday,' the man said; 'let's see.' He took the
  sketch and retired to a corner of his room. 'Oh, yes&mdash;here it is, I
  think; isn't this it? Do you claim it?' 'Well, not exactly that, but I think
  I'll take a look at it, if you'll let me. By the way, I see it's rolled up.
  Was it found like that?'</p>

  <p>'No; the chap rolled it up what found it&mdash;porter he was. It's a fad
  of his, rolling up umbrellas close and neat, and he's rather proud of it. He
  often looks as though he'd like to take a man's umbrella away and roll it up
  for him when it's a bit clumsy done. Rum fad, eh?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; everybody has his little fad, though. Where was this
  found&mdash;close by here?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir; just there, almost opposite this window, in the little
  corner.'</p>

  <p>'About two o'clock?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, about that time, more or less.'</p>

  <p>Hewitt took the umbrella up, unfastened the band, and shook the silk out
  loose. Then he opened it, and as he did so a small scrap of paper fell from
  inside it. Hewitt pounced on it like lightning. Then, after examining the
  umbrella thoroughly, inside and out, he handed it back to the man, who had
  not observed the incident of the scrap of paper.</p>

  <p>'That will do, thanks,' he said. 'I only wanted to take a peep at
  it&mdash;just a small matter connected with a little case of mine.
  Good-morning.'</p>

  <p>He turned suddenly and saw, gazing at him with a terrified expression from
  a door behind, the face of the woman who had followed him in the cab. The
  veil was lifted, and he caught but a mere glance of the face ere it was
  suddenly withdrawn. He stood for a moment to allow the woman time to retreat,
  and then left the station and walked toward his office, close by.</p>

  <p>Scarcely thirty yards along the Strand he met Plummer. 'I'm going to make
  some much closer inquiries all down the line as far as Dover,' Plummer said.
  'They wire from Calais that they have no clue as yet, and I mean to make
  quite sure, if I can, that Laker hasn't quietly slipped off the line
  somewhere between here and Dover. There's one very peculiar thing,' Plummer
  added confidentially. 'Did you see the two women who were waiting to see a
  member of the firm at Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle's?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Laker's mother and his <i>fiance</i>, I was told.'</p>

  <p>'That's right. Well, do you know that girl&mdash;Shaw her name
  is&mdash;has been shadowing me ever since I left the Bank. Of course I
  spotted it from the beginning&mdash;these amateurs don't know how to follow
  anybody&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, she's just inside that jeweller's
  shop door behind me now, pretending to look at the things in the window. But
  it's odd, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' Hewitt replied, 'of course it's not a thing to be neglected. If
  you'll look very carefully at the corner of Villiers Street, without
  appearing to stare, I think you will possibly observe some signs of Laker's
  mother. She's shadowing <i>me</i>.'</p>

  <p>Plummer looked casually in the direction indicated, and then immediately
  turned his eyes in another direction.</p>

  <p>'I see her,' he said; 'she's just taking a look round the corner. That's a
  thing not to be be ignored. Of course, the Lakers' house is being
  watched&mdash;we set a man on it at once, yesterday. But I'll put some one on
  now to watch Miss Shaw's place too. I'll telephone through to
  Liddle's&mdash;probably they'll be able to say where it is. And the women
  themselves must be watched, too. As a matter of fact, I had a notion that
  Laker wasn't alone in it. And it's just possible, you know, that he has sent
  an accomplice off with his tourist ticket to lead us a dance while he looks
  after himself in another direction. Have you done anything?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' Hewitt replied, with a faint reproduction of the secretive smile
  with which Plummer had met an inquiry of his earlier in the morning, 'I've
  been to the station here, and I've found Laker's umbrella in the lost
  property office.'</p>

  <p>'Oh! Then probably he <i>has</i> gone. I'll bear that in mind, and perhaps
  have a word with the lost property man.'</p>

  <p>Plummer made for the station and Hewitt for his office. He mounted the
  stairs and reached his door just as I myself, who had been disappointed in
  not finding him in, was leaving. I had called with the idea of taking Hewitt
  to lunch with me at my club, but he declined lunch. 'I have an important case
  in hand,' he said. 'Look here, Brett. See this scrap of paper. You know the
  types of the different newspapers&mdash;which is this?'</p>

  <p>He handed me a small piece of paper. It was part of a cutting containing
  an advertisement, which had been torn in half.</p>

  <p><a id="pic32"
     name="pic32"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-5-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'I <i>think</i>,' I said, 'this is from the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>,
  judging by the paper. It is plainly from the "agony column", but all the
  papers use pretty much the same type for these advertisements, except the
  <i>Times</i>. If it were not torn I could tell you at once, because the
  <i>Chronicle</i> columns are rather narrow.'</p>

  <p>'Never mind&mdash;I'll send for them all.' He rang, and sent Kerrett for a
  copy of each morning paper of the previous day. Then he took from a large
  wardrobe cupboard a decent but well-worn and rather roughened tall hat. Also
  a coat a little worn and shiny on the collar. He exchanged these for his own
  hat and coat, and then substituted an old necktie for his own clean white
  one, and encased his legs in mud-spotted leggings. This done, he produced a
  very large and thick pocket-book, fastened by a broad elastic band, and said,
  'Well, what do you think of this? Will it do for Queen's taxes, or sanitary
  inspection, or the gas, or the water-supply?'</p>

  <p><a id="pic33"
     name="pic33"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-5-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'Very well indeed, I should say,' I replied. 'What's the case?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'll tell you all about that when it's over&mdash;no time now. Oh,
  here you are, Kerrett. By the bye, Kerrett, I'm going out presently by the
  back way. Wait for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I am gone,
  and then just go across the road and speak to that lady in black, with the
  veil, who is waiting in that little foot-passage opposite. Say Mr Martin
  Hewitt sends his compliments, and he advises her not to wait, as he has
  already left his office by another door, and has been gone some little time.
  That's all; it would be a pity to keep the poor woman waiting all day for
  nothing. Now the papers. <i>Daily News, Standard, Telegraph,
  Chronicle</i>&mdash;yes, here it is, in the <i>Chronicle</i>.'</p>

  <p>The whole advertisement read thus:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">YOB.&mdash;H.R. Shop roast. You 1st. Then<br>
  to-night. O2. 2nd top 3rd L. No.197<br>
  red bl. straight mon. One at a time.</p><br>

  <p>'What's this,' I asked, 'a cryptogram?'</p>

  <p>'I'll see,' Hewitt answered. 'But I won't tell you anything about it till
  afterwards, so you get your lunch. Kerrett, bring the directory.'</p>

  <p>This was all I actually saw of this case myself, and I have written the
  rest in its proper order from Hewitt's information, as I have written some
  other cases entirely.</p>

  <p>To resume at the point where, for the time, I lost sight of the matter.
  Hewitt left by the back way and stopped an empty cab as it passed. 'Abney
  Park Cemetery' was his direction to the driver. In little more than twenty
  minutes the cab was branching off down the Essex Road on its way to Stoke
  Newington, and in twenty minutes more Hewitt stopped it in Church Street,
  Stoke Newington. He walked through a street or two, and then down another,
  the houses of which he scanned carefully as he passed. Opposite one which
  stood by itself he stopped, and, making a pretence of consulting and
  arranging his large pocket-book, he took a good look at the house. It was
  rather larger, neater, and more pretentious than the others in the street,
  and it had a natty little coach-house just visible up the side entrance.
  There were red blinds hung with heavy lace in the front windows, and behind
  one of these blinds Hewitt was able to catch the glint of a heavy gas
  chandelier.</p>

  <p>He stepped briskly up the front steps and knocked sharply at the door. 'Mr
  Merston?' he asked, pocket-book in hand, when a neat parlourmaid opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' Hewitt stepped into the hall and pulled off his hat; 'it's only the
  meter. There's been a deal of gas running away somewhere here, and I'm just
  looking to see if the meters are right. Where is it?'</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated. 'I'll&mdash;I'll ask master,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Very well. I don't want to take it away, you know&mdash;only to give it a
  tap or two, and so on.'</p>

  <p>The girl retired to the back of the hall, and without taking her eyes off
  Martin Hewitt, gave his message to some invisible person in a back room,
  whence came a growling reply of 'All right'.</p>

  <p>Hewitt followed the girl to the basement, apparently looking straight
  before him, but in reality taking in every detail of the place. The gas meter
  was in a very large lumber cupboard under the kitchen stairs. The girl opened
  the door and lit a candle. The meter stood on the floor, which was littered
  with hampers and boxes and odd sheets of brown paper. But a thing that at
  once arrested Hewitt's attention was a garment of some sort of bright blue
  cloth, with large brass buttons, which was lying in a tumbled heap in a
  corner, and appeared to be the only thing in the place that was not covered
  with dust. Nevertheless, Hewitt took no apparent notice of it, but stooped
  down and solemnly tapped the meter three times with his pencil, and listened
  with great gravity, placing his ear to the top. Then he shook his head and
  tapped again. At length he said:</p>

  <p>'It's a bit doubtful. I'll just get you to light the gas in the kitchen a
  moment. Keep your hand to the burner, and when I call out shut it off <i>at
  once</i>; see?'</p>

  <p>The girl turned and entered the kitchen, and Hewitt immediately seized the
  blue coat&mdash;for a coat it was. It had a dull red piping in the seams, and
  was of the swallowtail pattern&mdash;livery coat, in fact. He held it for a
  moment before him, examining its pattern and colour, and then rolled it up
  and flung it again into the corner.</p>

  <p><a id="pic34"
     name="pic34"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-5-6.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'Right!' he called to the servant. 'Shut off!'</p>

  <p>The girl emerged from the kitchen as he left the cupboard.</p>

  <p>'Well,' she asked, 'are you satisfied now?'</p>

  <p>'Quite satisfied, thank you,' Hewitt replied.</p>

  <p>'Is it all right?' she continued, jerking her hand toward the
  cupboard.</p>

  <p>'Well, no, it isn't; there's something wrong there, and I'm glad I came.
  You can tell Mr Merston, if you like, that I expect his gas bill will be a
  good deal less next quarter.' And there was a suspicion of a chuckle in
  Hewitt's voice as he crossed the hall to leave. For a gas inspector is
  pleased when he finds at length what he has been searching for.</p>

  <p>Things had fallen out better than Hewitt had dared to expect. He saw the
  key of the whole mystery in that blue coat; for it was the uniform coat of
  the hall porters at one of the banks that he had visited in the morning,
  though which one he could not for the moment remember. He entered the nearest
  post-office and despatched a telegram to Plummer, giving certain directions
  and asking the inspector to meet him; then he hailed the first available cab
  and hurried toward the City.</p>

  <p>At Lombard Street he alighted, and looked in at the door of each bank till
  he came to Buller, Clayton, Ladds &amp; Co.'s. This was the bank he wanted.
  In the other banks the hall porters wore mulberry coats, brick-dust coats,
  brown coats, and what not, but here, behind the ladders and scaffold poles
  which obscured the entrance, he could see a man in a blue coat, with dull red
  piping and brass buttons. He sprang up the steps, pushed open the inner swing
  door, and finally satisfied himself by a closer view of the coat, to the
  wearer's astonishment. Then he regained the pavement and walked the whole
  length of the bank premises in front, afterwards turning up the paved passage
  at the side, deep in thought. The bank had no windows or doors on the side
  next the court, and the two adjoining houses were old and supported in place
  by wooden shores. Both were empty, and a great board announced that tenders
  would be received in a month's time for the purchase of the old materials of
  which they were constructed; also that some part of the site would be let on
  a long building lease.</p>

  <p>Hewitt looked up at the grimy fronts of the old buildings. The windows
  were crusted thick with dirt&mdash;all except the bottom window of the house
  nearer the bank, which was fairly clean, and seemed to have been quite lately
  washed. The door, too, of this house was cleaner than that of the other,
  though the paint was worn. Hewitt reached and fingered a hook driven into the
  left-hand doorpost about six feet from the ground. It was new, and not at all
  rusted; also a tiny splinter had been displaced when the hook was driven in,
  and clean wood showed at the spot.</p>

  <p>Having observed these things, Hewitt stepped back and read at the bottom
  of the big board the name, 'Winsor &amp; Weekes, Surveyors and Auctioneers,
  Abchurch Lane'. Then he stepped into Lombard Street.</p>

  <p>Two hansoms pulled up near the post-office, and out of the first stepped
  Inspector Plummer and another man. This man and the two who alighted from the
  second hansom were unmistakably plain-clothes constables&mdash;their air,
  gait, and boots proclaimed it.</p>

  <p>'What's all this?' demanded Plummer, as Hewitt approached.</p>

  <p>'You'll soon see, I think. But, first, have you put the watch on No. 197,
  Hackworth Road?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; nobody will get away from there alone.'</p>

  <p>'Very good. I am going into Abchurch Lane for a few minutes. Leave your
  men out here, but just go round into the court by Buller, Clayton &amp;
  Ladds's, and keep your eye on the first door on the left. I think we'll find
  something soon. Did you get rid of Miss Shaw?'</p>

  <p>'No, she's behind now, and Mrs Laker's with her. They met in the Strand,
  and came after us in another cab. Rare fun, eh! They think we're pretty
  green! It's quite handy, too. So long as they keep behind me it saves all
  trouble of watching <i>them</i>.' And Inspector Plummer chuckled and
  winked.</p>

  <p>'Very good. You don't mind keeping your eye on that door, do you? I'll be
  back very soon,' and with that Hewitt turned off into Abchurch Lane.</p>

  <p>At Winsor &amp; Weekes's information was not difficult to obtain. The
  houses were destined to come down very shortly, but a week or so ago an
  office and a cellar in one of them was let temporarily to a Mr Westley. He
  brought no references; indeed, as he paid a fortnight's rent in advance, he
  was not asked for any, considering the circumstances of the case. He was
  opening a London branch for a large firm of cider merchants, he said, and
  just wanted a rough office and a cool cellar to store samples in for a few
  weeks till the permanent premises were ready. There was another key, and no
  doubt the premises might be entered if there were any special need for such a
  course. Martin Hewitt gave such excellent reasons that Winsor &amp; Weekes's
  managing clerk immediately produced the key and accompanied Hewitt to the
  spot.</p>

  <p>'I think you'd better have your men handy,' Hewitt remarked to Plummer
  when they reached the door, and a whistle quickly brought the men over.</p>

  <p>The key was inserted in the lock and turned, but the door would not open;
  the bolt was fastened at the bottom. Hewitt stooped and looked under the
  door.</p>

  <p>'It's a drop bolt,' he said. 'Probably the man who left last let it fall
  loose, and then banged the door, so that it fell into its place. I must try
  my best with a wire or a piece of string.'</p>

  <p>A wire was brought, and with some manoeuvring Hewitt contrived to pass it
  round the bolt, and lift it little by little, steadying it with the blade of
  a pocket-knife. When at length the bolt was raised out of the hole, the
  knife-blade was slipped under it, and the door swung open.</p>

  <p>They entered. The door of the little office just inside stood open, but in
  the office there was nothing, except a board a couple of feet long in a
  corner. Hewitt stepped across and lifted this, turning it downward face
  toward Plummer. On it, in fresh white paint on a black ground, were painted
  the words&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign">"Buller, Clayton, Ladds &amp; Co.,<br>
  Temporary Entrance."</p><br>

  <p>Hewitt turned to Winsor &amp; Weekes's clerk and asked, 'The man who took
  this room called himself Westley, didn't he?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Youngish man, clean-shaven, and well-dressed?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he was.'</p>

  <p>'I fancy,' Hewitt said, turning to Plummer, 'I <i>fancy</i> an old friend
  of yours is in this&mdash;Mr Sam Gunter.'</p>

  <p>'What, the "Hoxton Yob"?'</p>

  <p>'I think it's possible he's been Mr Westley for a bit, and somebody else
  for another bit. But let's come to the cellar.'</p>

  <p>Winsor &amp; Weekes's clerk led the way down a steep flight of steps into
  a dark underground corridor, wherein they lighted their way with many
  successive matches. Soon the cellar corridor made a turn to the right, and as
  the party passed the turn, there came from the end of the passage before them
  a fearful yell.</p>

  <p>'Help! help! Open the door! I'm going mad&mdash;mad! O my God!'</p>

  <p>And there was a sound of desperate beating from the inside of the cellar
  door at the extreme end. The men stopped, startled.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>'Come,' said Hewitt, 'more matches!' and he rushed to the door. It was
  fastened with a bar and padlock.</p>

  <p>'Let me out, for God's sake!' came the voice, sick and hoarse, from the
  inside. 'Let me out!'</p>

  <p>'All right!' Hewitt shouted. 'We have come for you. Wait a moment.'</p>

  <p>The voice sank into a sort of sobbing croon, and Hewitt tried several keys
  from his own bunch on the padlock. None fitted. He drew from his pocket the
  wire he had used for the bolt of the front door, straightened it out, and
  made a sharp bend at the end.</p>

  <p>'Hold a match close,' he ordered shortly, and one of the men obeyed. Three
  or four attempts were necessary, and several different bendings of the wire
  were effected, but in the end Hewitt picked the lock, and flung open the
  door.</p>

  <p>From within a ghastly figure fell forward among them fainting, and knocked
  out the matches.</p>

  <p>'Hullo!' cried Plummer. 'Hold up! Who are you?'</p>

  <p>'Let's get him up into the open,' said Hewitt. 'He can't tell you who he
  is for a bit, but I believe he's Laker.'</p>

  <p>'Laker! What, here?'</p>

  <p>'I think so. Steady up the steps. Don't bump him. He's pretty sore
  already, I expect.'</p>

  <p>Truly the man was a pitiable sight. His hair and face were caked in dust
  and blood, and his finger-nails were torn and bleeding. Water was sent for at
  once, and brandy.</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Plummer hazily, looking first at the unconscious prisoner and
  then at Hewitt, 'but what about the swag?'</p>

  <p>'You'll have to find that yourself,' Hewitt replied. 'I think my share of
  the case is about finished. I only act for the Guarantee Society, you know,
  and if Laker's proved innocent&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Innocent! How?'</p>

  <p>'Well, this is what took place, as near as I can figure it. You'd better
  undo his collar, I think'&mdash;this to the men. 'What I believe has happened
  is this. There has been a very clever and carefully prepared conspiracy here,
  and Laker has not been the criminal, but the victim.'</p>

  <p>'Been robbed himself, you mean? But how? Where?'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday morning, before he had been to more than three
  banks&mdash;here, in fact.'</p>

  <p>'<i>But then how</i>? You're all wrong. We know he made the whole round,
  and did all the collection. And then Palmer's office, and all, and the
  umbrella; why&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The man lay still unconscious. 'Don't raise his head,' Hewitt said. 'And
  one of you had best fetch a doctor. He's had a terrible shock.' Then turning
  to Plummer he went on, 'As to <i>how</i> they managed the job, I'll tell you
  what I think. First it struck some very clever person that a deal of money
  might be got by robbing a walk-clerk from a bank. This clever person was one
  of a clever gang of thieves&mdash;perhaps the Hoxton Row gang, as I think I
  hinted. Now you know quite as well as I do that such a gang will spend any
  amount of time over a job that promises a big haul, and that for such a job
  they can always command the necessary capital. There are many most
  respectable persons living in good style in the suburbs whose chief business
  lies in financing such ventures, and taking the chief share of the proceeds.
  Well, this is their plan, carefully and intelligently carried out. They watch
  Laker, observe the round he takes, and his habits. They find that there is
  only one of the clerks with whom he does business that he is much acquainted
  with, and that this clerk is in a bank which is commonly second in Laker's
  round. The sharpest man among them&mdash;and I don't think there's a man in
  London could do this as well as young Sam Gunter&mdash;studies Laker's dress
  and habits just as an actor studies a character. They take this office and
  cellar, as we have seen, <i>because it is next door to a bank whose front
  entrance is being altered</i>&mdash;a fact which Laker must know from his
  daily visits. The smart man&mdash;Gunter, let us say, and I have other
  reasons for believing it to be he&mdash;makes up precisely like Laker, false
  moustache, dress, and everything, and waits here with the rest of the gang.
  One of the gang is dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons, like a
  hall-porter in Buller's bank. Do you see?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I think so. It's pretty clear now.'</p>

  <p>'A confederate watches at the top of the court, and the moment Laker turns
  in from Cornhill&mdash;having already been, mind, at the only bank where he
  was so well known that the disguised thief would not have passed
  muster&mdash;as soon as he turns in from Cornhill, I say, a signal is given,
  and that board'&mdash;pointing to that with the white letters&mdash;'is hung
  on the hook in the doorpost. The sham porter stands beside it, and as Laker
  approaches says, "This way in, sir, this morning. The front way's shut for
  the alterations." Laker suspecting nothing, and supposing that the firm have
  made a temporary entrance through the empty house, enters. He is seized when
  well along the corridor, the board is taken down and the door shut. Probably
  he is stunned by a blow on the head&mdash;see the blood now. They take his
  wallet and all the cash he has already collected. Gunter takes the wallet and
  also the umbrella, since it has Laker's initials, and is therefore
  distinctive. He simply completes the walk in the character of Laker,
  beginning with Buller, Clayton &amp; Ladds's just round the corner. It is
  nothing but routine work, which is quickly done, and nobody notices him
  particularly&mdash;it is the bills they examine. Meanwhile this unfortunate
  fellow is locked up in the cellar here, right at the end of the underground
  corridor, where he can never make himself heard in the street, and where next
  him are only the empty cellars of the deserted house next door. The thieves
  shut the front door and vanish. The rest is plain. Gunter, having completed
  the round, and bagged some 15,000 or more, spends a few pounds in a tourist
  ticket at Palmer's as a blind, being careful to give Laker's name. He leaves
  the umbrella at Charing Cross in a conspicuous place right opposite the lost
  property office, where it is sure to be seen, and so completes his false
  trail.'</p>

  <p>'Then who are the people at 197, Hackworth Road?'</p>

  <p>'The capitalist lives there&mdash;the financier, and probably the
  directing spirit of the whole thing. Merston's the name he goes by there, and
  I've no doubt he cuts a very imposing figure in chapel every Sunday. He'll be
  worth picking up&mdash;this isn't the first thing he's been in, I'll
  warrant.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;but what about Laker's mother and Miss Shaw?'</p>

  <p>'Well, what? The poor women are nearly out of their minds with terror and
  shame, that's all, but though they may think Laker a criminal, they'll never
  desert him. They've been following us about with a feeble, vague sort of hope
  of being able to baffle us in some way or help him if we caught him, or
  something, poor things. Did you ever hear of a real woman who'd desert a son
  or a lover merely because he was a criminal? But here's the doctor. When he's
  attended to him will you let your men take Laker home? I must hurry and
  report to the Guarantee Society, I think.'</p>

  <p>'But,' said the perplexed Plummer, 'where did you get your clue? You must
  have had a tip from some one, you know&mdash;you can't have done it by
  clairvoyance. What gave you the tip?'</p>

  <p>'The <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.'</p>

  <p>'The <i>what</i>?'</p>

  <p>'The <i>Daily Chronicle</i>. Just take a look at the "agony column" in
  yesterday morning's issue, and read the message to "Yob"&mdash;to Gunter, in
  fact. That's all.'</p>

  <p>By this time a cab was waiting in Lombard Street, and two of Plummer's
  men, under the doctor's directions, carried Laker to it. No sooner, however,
  were they in the court than the two watching women threw themselves
  hysterically upon Laker, and it was long before they could be persuaded that
  he was not being taken to gaol. The mother shrieked aloud, 'My boy&mdash;my
  boy! Don't take him! Oh, don't take him! They've killed my boy! Look at his
  head&mdash;oh, his head!' and wrestled desperately with the men, while Hewitt
  attempted to soothe her, and promised to allow her to go in the cab with her
  son if she would only be quiet. The younger woman made no noise, but she held
  one of Laker's limp hands in both hers.</p>

  <p>Hewitt and I dined together that evening, and he gave me a full account of
  the occurrences which I have here set down. Still, when he was finished I was
  not able to see clearly by what process of reasoning he had arrived at the
  conclusions that gave him the key to the mystery, nor did I understand the
  'agony column' message, and I said so.</p>

  <p><a id="pic36"

  </div><br>

  <p>'In the beginning,' Hewitt explained, 'the thing that struck me as curious
  was the fact that Laker was said to have given his own name at Palmer's in
  buying his ticket. Now, the first thing the greenest and newest criminal
  thinks of is changing his name, so that the giving of his own name seemed
  unlikely to begin with. Still, he <i>might</i> have made such a mistake, as
  Plummer suggested when he said that criminals usually make a mistake
  somewhere&mdash;as they do, in fact. Still, it was the least likely mistake I
  could think of&mdash;especially as he actually didn't wait to be asked for
  his name, but blurted it out when it wasn't really wanted. And it was
  conjoined with another rather curious mistake, or what would have been a
  mistake, if the thief were Laker. Why should he conspicuously display his
  wallet&mdash;such a distinctive article&mdash;for the clerk to see and note?
  Why rather had he not got rid of it before showing himself? Suppose it should
  be somebody personating Laker? In any case I determined not to be prejudiced
  by what I had heard of Laker's betting. A man may bet without being a
  thief.</p>

  <p>'But, again, supposing it <i>were</i> Laker? Might he not have given his
  name, and displayed his wallet, and so on, while buying a ticket for France,
  in order to draw pursuit after himself in that direction while he made off in
  another, in another name, and disguised? Each supposition was plausible. And,
  in either case, it might happen that whoever was laying this trail would
  probably lay it a little farther. Charing Cross was the next point, and there
  I went. I already had it from Plummer that Laker had not been recognized
  there. Perhaps the trail had been laid in some other manner. Something left
  behind with Laker's name on it, perhaps? I at once thought of the umbrella
  with his monogram, and, making a long shot, asked for it at the lost property
  office, as you know. The guess was lucky: In the umbrella, as you know, I
  found the scrap of paper. That, I judged, had fallen in from the hand of the
  man carrying the umbrella. He had torn the paper in half in order to fling it
  away, and one piece had fallen into the loosely flapping umbrella. It is a
  thing that will often happen with an omnibus ticket, as you may have noticed.
  Also, it was proved that the umbrella <i>was</i> unrolled when found, and
  rolled immediately after. So here was a piece of paper dropped by the person
  who had brought the umbrella to Charing Cross and left it. I got the whole
  advertisement, as you remember, and I studied it. "Yob" is back-slang for
  "boy", and is often used in nicknames to denote a young smooth-faced thief.
  Gunter, the man I suspect, as a matter of fact, is known as the "Hoxton Yob".
  The message, then, was addressed to some one known by such a nickname. Next,
  "H.R. shop roast". Now, in thieves' slang, to "roast" a thing or a person is
  to watch it or him. They call any place a shop&mdash;notably, a thieves' den.
  So that this meant that some resort&mdash;perhaps the "Hoxton Row
  shop"&mdash;was watched. "You 1st then to-night" would be clearer, perhaps,
  when the rest was understood. I thought a little over the rest, and it struck
  me that it must be a direction to some other house, since one was warned of
  as being watched. Besides, there was the number, 197, and "red bl.", which
  would be extremely likely to mean "red blinds ", by way of clearly
  distinguishing the house. And then the plan of the thing was plain. You have
  noticed, probably, that the map of London which accompanies the Post Office
  Directory is divided, for convenience of reference, into numbered
  squares?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The squares are denoted by letters along the top margin and figures
  down the side. So that if you consult the directory, and find a place marked
  as being in D 5, for instance, you find vertical divisions D, and run your
  finger down it till it intersects horizontal division 5, and there you
  are.'</p>

  <p>'Precisely. I got my Post Office Directory, and looked for "O 2". It was
  in North London, and took in parts of Abney Park Cemetery and Clissold Park;
  "2nd top" was the next sign. Very well, I counted the second street
  intersecting the top of the square&mdash;counting, in the usual way, from the
  left. That was Lordship Road. Then "3rd L". From the point where Lordship
  Road crossed the top of the square, I ran my finger down the road till it
  came to "3rd L", or, in other words, the third turning on the
  left&mdash;Hackworth Road. So there we were, unless my guesses were
  altogether wrong. "Straight mon" probably meant "straight moniker"&mdash;that
  is to say, the proper name, a thief's <i>real</i> name, in contradistinction
  to that he may assume. I turned over the directory till I found Hackworth
  Road, and found that No. 197 was inhabited by a Mr Merston. From the whole
  thing I judged this. There was to have been a meeting at the "H.R. shop", but
  that was found, at the last moment, to be watched by the police for some
  purpose, so that another appointment was made for this house in the suburbs.
  "You 1st. Then to-night"&mdash;the person addressed was to come first, and
  the others in the evening. They were to ask for the householder's "straight
  moniker"&mdash;Mr Merston. And they were to come one at a time.</p>

  <p>'Now, then, what was this? What theory would fit it? Suppose this were a
  robbery, directed from afar by the advertiser. Suppose, on the day before the
  robbery, it was found that the place fixed for division of spoils were
  watched. Suppose that the principal thereupon advertised (as had already been
  agreed in case of emergency) in these terms. The principal in the actual
  robbery&mdash;the "Yob" addressed&mdash;was to go first with the booty. The
  others were to come after, one at a time. Anyway, the thing was good enough
  to follow a little further, and I determined to try No. 197 Hackworth Road. I
  have told you what I found there, and how it opened my eyes. I went, of
  course, merely on chance, to see what I might chance to see. But luck
  favoured, and I happened on that coat&mdash;brought back rolled up, on the
  evening after the robbery, doubtless by the thief who had used it, and flung
  carelessly into the handiest cupboard. <i>That</i> was this gang's
  mistake.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I congratulate you,' I said. 'I hope they'll catch the
  rascals.'</p>

  <p>'I rather think they will, now they know where to look. They can scarcely
  miss Merston, anyway. There has been very little to go upon in this case, but
  I stuck to the thread, however slight, and it brought me through. The rest of
  the case, of course, is Plummer's. It was a peculiarity of my commission that
  I could equally well fulfil it by catching the man with all the plunder, or
  by proving him innocent. Having done the latter, my work was at an end, but I
  left it where Plummer will be able to finish the job handsomely.'</p>

  <p>Plummer did. Sam Gunter, Merston, and one accomplice were taken&mdash;the
  first and last were well known to the police&mdash;and were identified by
  Laker. Merston, as Hewitt had suspected, had kept the lion's share for
  himself, so that altogether, with what was recovered from him and the other
  two, nearly 11,000 was saved for Messrs Liddle, Neal &amp; Liddle. Merston,
  when taken, was in the act of packing up to take a holiday abroad, and there
  cash his notes, which were found, neatly packed in separate thousands, in his
  portmanteau. As Hewitt had predicted, his gas bill <i>was</i> considerably
  less next quarter, for less than half-way through it he began a term in
  gaol.</p>

  <p>As for Laker, he was reinstated, of course, with an increase of salary by
  way of compensation for his broken head. He had passed a terrible twenty-six
  hours in the cellar, unfed and unheard. Several times he had become
  insensible, and again and again he had thrown himself madly against the door,
  shouting and tearing at it, till he fell back exhausted, with broken nails
  and bleeding fingers. For some hours before the arrival of his rescuers he
  had been sitting in a sort of stupor, from which he was suddenly aroused by
  the sound of voices and footsteps. He was in bed for a week, and required a
  rest of a month in addition before he could resume his duties. Then he was
  quietly lectured by Mr Neal as to betting, and, I believe, dropped that
  practice in consequence. I am told that he is 'at the counter' now&mdash;a
  considerable promotion.</p>

  <p class="first">I HAVE already said in more than one place that Hewitt's
  personal relations with the members of the London police force were of a
  cordial character. In the course of his work it has frequently been Hewitt's
  hap to learn of matters on which the police were glad of information, and
  that information was always passed on at once; and so long as no infringement
  of regulations or damage to public service were involved, Hewitt could always
  rely on a return in kind.</p>

  <p>It was with a message of a useful sort that Hewitt one day dropped into
  Vine Street police station and asked for a particular inspector, who was not
  in. Hewitt sat and wrote a note, and by way of making conversation said to
  the inspector on duty, "Anything very startling this way to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing <i>very</i> startling, perhaps, as yet," the inspector replied.
  "But one of our chaps picked up rather an odd customer a little while ago.
  Lunatic of some sort, I should think&mdash;in fact, I've sent for the doctor
  to see him. He's a foreigner&mdash;a Frenchman, I believe. He seemed horribly
  weak and faint; but the oddest thing occurred when one of the men, thinking
  he might be hungry, brought in some bread. He went into fits of terror at the
  sight of it, and wouldn't be pacified till they took it away again."</p>

  <p>"That was strange."</p>

  <p>"Odd, wasn't it? And he was hungry too. They brought him some more a
  little while after, and he didn't funk it a bit,&mdash;pitched into it, in
  fact, like anything, and ate it all with some cold beef. It's the way with
  some lunatics&mdash;never the same five minutes together. He keeps crying
  like a baby, and saying things we can't understand. As it happens, there's
  nobody in just now who speaks French."</p>

  <p>"I speak French," Hewitt replied. "Shall I try him?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you will. He's in the men's room below. They've been making
  him as comfortable as possible by the fire until the doctor comes. He's a
  long time. I expect he's got a case on."</p>

  <p>Hewitt found his way to the large mess-room, where three or four policemen
  in their shirt-sleeves were curiously regarding a young man of very
  disordered appearance who sat on a chair by the fire. He was pale, and
  exhibited marks of bruises on his face, while over one eye was a scarcely
  healed cut. His figure was small and slight, his coat was torn, and he sat
  with a certain indefinite air of shivering suffering. He started and looked
  round apprehensively as Hewitt entered. Hewitt bowed smilingly, wished him
  good-day, speaking in French, and asked him if he spoke the language.</p>

  <p>The man looked up with a dull expression, and after an effort or two, as
  of one who stutters, burst out with, "<i>Je le nie</i>!"</p>

  <p>"That's strange," Hewitt observed to the men. "I ask him if he speaks
  French, and he says he denies it&mdash;speaking <i>in</i> French."</p>

  <p>"He's been saying that very often, sir," one of the men answered, "as well
  as other things we can't make anything of."</p>

  <p>Hewitt placed his hand kindly on the man's shoulder and asked his name.
  The reply was for a little while an inarticulate gurgle, presently merging
  into a meaningless medley of words and syllables&mdash;"<i>Qu'est ce
  qu'&mdash;il n'a</i>&mdash;Leystar Squarr&mdash;<i>sacr nom</i>&mdash;not
  spik it&mdash;<i>quel chemin</i>&mdash;sank you ver' mosh&mdash;<i>je le nie!
  je le nie!</i>" He paused, stared, and then, as though realizing his
  helplessness, he burst into tears.</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"He's been a-cryin' two or three times," said the man who had spoken
  before. "He was a-cryin' when we found him."</p>

  <p>Several more attempts Hewitt made to communicate with the man, but though
  he seemed to comprehend what was meant, he replied with nothing but
  meaningless gibber, and finally gave up the attempt, and, leaning against the
  side of the fireplace, buried his head in the bend of his arm.</p>

  <p>Then the doctor arrived and made <i>his</i> examination. While it was in
  progress Hewitt took aside the policeman who had been speaking before and
  questioned him further. He had himself found the Frenchman in a dull back
  street by Golden Square, where the man was standing helpless and trembling,
  apparently quite bewildered and very weak. He had brought him in, without
  having been able to learn anything about him. One or two shopkeepers in the
  street where he was found were asked, but knew nothing of him&mdash;indeed,
  had never seen him before.</p>

  <p>"But the curiousest thing," the policeman proceeded, "was in this 'ere
  room, when I brought him a loaf to give him a bit of a snack, seein' he
  looked so weak an' 'ungry. You'd 'a thought we was a-goin' to poison 'im. He
  fair screamed at the very sight o' the bread, an' he scrouged hisself up in
  that corner an' put his hands in front of his face. I couldn't make out what
  was up at first&mdash;didn't tumble to it's bein' the bread he was frightened
  of, seein' as he looked like a man as 'ud be frightened at anything else
  afore <i>that</i>. But the nearer I came with it the more he yelled, so I
  took it away an' left it outside, an' then he calmed down. An' s'elp me, when
  I cut some bits off that there very loaf an' brought 'em in, with a bit o'
  beef, he just went for 'em like one o'clock. <i>He</i> wasn't frightened o'
  no bread then, you bet. Rum thing, how the fancies takes 'em when they're a
  bit touched, ain't it? All one way one minute, all the other the next."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. By the way, have you another uncut loaf in the place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Half a dozen if you like."</p>

  <p>"One will be enough. I am going over to speak to the doctor. Wait awhile
  until he seems very quiet and fairly comfortable; then bring a loaf in
  quietly and put it on the table, not far from his elbow. Don't attract his
  attention to what you are doing."</p>

  <p>The doctor stood looking thoughtfully down on the Frenchman, who, for his
  part, stared gloomily, but tranquilly, at the fire-place. Hewitt stepped
  quietly over to the doctor and, without disturbing the man by the fire, said
  interrogatively, "Aphasia?"</p>

  <p>The doctor tightened his lips, frowned, and nodded significantly. "Motor,"
  he murmured, just loudly enough for Hewitt to hear; "and there's a general
  nervous break-down as well, I should say. By the way, perhaps there's no
  agraphia. Have you tried him with pen and paper?"</p>

  <p>Pen and paper were brought and set before the man. He was told, slowly and
  distinctly, that he was among friends, whose only object was to restore him
  to his proper health. Would he write his name and address, and any other
  information he might care to give about himself, on the paper before him?</p>

  <p>The Frenchman took the pen and stared at the paper; then slowly, and with
  much hesitation, he traced these marks:&mdash;</p>

  </div>

  <p>The man paused after the last of these futile characters, and his pen
  stabbed into the paper with a blot, as he dazedly regarded his work. Then
  with a groan he dropped it, and his face sank again into the bend of his
  arm.</p>

  <p>The doctor took the paper and handed it to Hewitt. "Complete agraphia, you
  see," he said. "He can't write a word. He begins to write 'Monsieur' from
  sheer habit in beginning letters thus; but the word tails off into a scrawl.
  Then his attempts become mere scribble, with just a trace of some familiar
  word here and there&mdash;but quite meaningless all."</p>

  <p>Although he had never before chanced to come across a case of aphasia
  (happily a rare disease), Hewitt was acquainted with its general nature. He
  knew that it might arise either from some physical injury to the brain, or
  from a break-down consequent on some terrible nervous strain. He knew that in
  the case of motor aphasia the sufferer, though fully conscious of all that
  goes on about him, and though quite understanding what is said to him is
  entirely powerless to put his own thoughts into spoken words&mdash;has lost,
  in fact, the connection between words and their spoken symbols. Also that in
  most bad cases agraphia&mdash;the loss of ability to write words with any
  reference to their meaning&mdash;is commonly an accompaniment.</p>

  <p>"You will have him taken to the infirmary, I suppose?" Hewitt asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the doctor replied. "I shall go and see about it at once."</p>

  <p>The man looked up again as they spoke. The policeman had, in accordance
  with Hewitt's request, placed a loaf of bread on the table near him, and now
  as he looked up he caught sight of it. He started visibly and paled, but gave
  no such signs of abject terror as the policeman had previously observed. He
  appeared nervous and uneasy, however, and presently reached stealthily toward
  the loaf. Hewitt continued to talk to the doctor, while closely watching the
  Frenchman's behaviour from the corner of his eye.</p>

  <p>The loaf was what is called a "plain cottage," of solid and regular shape.
  The man reached it and immediately turned it bottom up on the table. Then he
  sank back in his chair with a more contented expression, though his gaze was
  still directed toward the loaf. The policeman grinned silently at this
  curious manoeuvre.</p>

  <p>The doctor left, and Hewitt accompanied him to the door of the room. "He
  will not be moved just yet, I take it?" Hewitt asked as they parted.</p>

  <p><a id="pic39"
     name="pic39"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"It may take an hour or two," the doctor replied. "Are you anxious to keep
  him here?"</p>

  <p>"Not for long; but I think there's a curious inside to the case, and I may
  perhaps learn something of it by a little watching. But I can't spare very
  long."</p>

  <p>At a sign from Hewitt the loaf was removed.</p>

  <p>Then Hewitt pulled the small table closer to the Frenchman and pushed the
  pen and sheets of paper toward him. The manoeuvre had its result. The man
  looked up and down the room vacantly once or twice and then began to turn the
  papers over.</p>

  <p>From that he went to dipping the pen in the inkpot, and presently he was
  scribbling at random on the loose sheets. Hewitt affected to leave him
  entirely alone, and seemed to be absorbed in a contemplation of a photograph
  of a police-division brass band that hung on the wall, but he saw every
  scratch the man made.</p>

  <p>At first there was nothing but meaningless scrawls and attempted words.
  Then rough sketches appeared, of a man's head, a chair or what not. On the
  mantelpiece stood a small clock&mdash;apparently a sort of humble
  presentation piece, the body of the clock being set in a horse-shoe frame,
  with crossed whips behind it. After a time the Frenchman's eyes fell on this,
  and he began a crude sketch of it. That he relinquished, and went on with
  other random sketches and scribblings on the same piece of paper, sketching
  and scribbling over the sketches in a half mechanical sort of way, as of one
  who trifles with a pen during a brown study. Beginning at the top left-hand
  corner of the paper, he travelled all round it till he arrived at the
  left-hand bottom corner. Then dashing his pen hastily across his last sketch
  he dropped it, and with a great shudder turned away again and hid his face by
  the fireplace.</p>

  <p>Hewitt turned at once and seized the papers on the table. He stuffed them
  all into his coat-pocket, with the exception of the last which the man had
  been engaged on, and this, a facsimile of which is subjoined, he studied
  earnestly for several minutes.</p>

  <p>Hewitt wished the men good-day, and made his way to the inspector.</p>

  <p>"Well," the inspector said, "not much to be got out of him, is there? The
  doctor will be sending for him presently."</p>

  <p>"I fancy," said Hewitt, "that this may turn out a very important case.
  Possibly&mdash;quite possibly&mdash;I may not have guessed correctly, and so
  I won't tell you anything of it till I know a little more. But what I want
  now is a messenger. Can I send somebody at once in a cab to my friend Brett
  at his chambers?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I'll find somebody. Want to write a note?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt wrote and despatched a note, which reached me in less than ten
  minutes. Then he asked the inspector, "Have you searched the Frenchman?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. We went all over him, when we found he couldn't explain himself,
  to see if we could trace his friends or his address. He didn't seem to mind.
  But there wasn't a single thing in his pocket&mdash;not a single thing,
  barring a rag of a pocket-handkerchief with no marking on it."</p>

  <p>"You noticed that somebody had stolen his watch, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he hadn't got one."</p>

  <p>"But he had one of those little vertical buttonholes in his waistcoat,
  used to fasten a watchguard to, and it was much worn and frayed, so that he
  must be in the habit of carrying a watch; and it is gone."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and everything else too, eh? Looks like robbery. He's had a knock or
  two in the face&mdash;notice that?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the bruises and the cut, of course; and his collar has been broken
  away, with the back button; somebody has taken him by the collar or throat.
  Was he wearing a hat when he was found?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"That would imply that he had only just left a house. What street was he
  found in?"</p>

  <p>"Henry Street&mdash;a little off Golden Square. Low street, you know."</p>

  <p>"Did the constable notice a door open near by?"</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head. "Half the doors in the street are open," he
  said, "pretty nearly all day."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then there's nothing in that. I don't think he lives there, by the
  bye. I fancy he comes from more in the Seven Dials or Drury Lane direction.
  Did you notice anything about the man that gave you a clue to his
  occupation&mdash;or at any rate to his habits?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, just take a look at the back of his coat before he goes
  away&mdash;just over the loins. Good-day."</p>

  <p>As I have said, Hewitt's messenger was quick. I happened to be
  in&mdash;having lately returned from a latish lunch&mdash;when he arrived
  with this note:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"My dear B.,&mdash;I meant to have lunched with you to-day,
  but have been kept. I expect you are idle this afternoon, and I have a case
  that will interest you&mdash;perhaps be useful to you from a journalistic
  point of view. If you care to see anything of it, cab away <i>at once</i> to
  Fitzroy Square, south side, where I'll meet you. I will wait no later than
  3.30. Yours, M. H."</p>

  <p>I had scarce a quarter of an hour, so I seized my hat and left my chambers
  at once. As it happened, my cab and Hewitt's burst into Fitzroy Square from
  opposite sides almost at the same moment, so that we lost no time.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Hewitt, taking my arm and marching me out, "we are going to
  look for some stabling. Try to feel as though you'd just set up a brougham
  and had come out to look for a place to put it in. I fear we may have to
  delude some person with that belief presently."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;what do you want stables for? And why make me your excuse?"</p>

  <p>"As to what I want the stables for&mdash;really I'm not altogether sure
  myself. As to making you an excuse&mdash;well, even the humblest excuse is
  better than none. But come, here are some stables. Not good enough, though,
  even if any of them were empty. Come on."</p>

  <p>We had stopped for an instant at the entrance to a small alley of rather
  dirty stables, and Hewitt, paying apparently but small attention to the
  stables themselves, had looked sharply about him with his gaze in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"I know this part of London pretty well," Hewitt observed, "and I can only
  remember one other range of stabling near by; we must try that. As a matter
  of fact, I'm coming here on little more than conjecture, though I shall be
  surprised if there isn't something in it. Do you know anything of
  aphasia?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of it, of course, though I can't say I remember ever knowing
  a case."</p>

  <p>"I've seen one to-day&mdash;very curious case. The man's a Frenchman,
  discovered helpless in the street by a policeman. The only thing he can say
  that has any meaning in it at all is '<i>je le nie</i>,' and that he says
  mechanically, without in the least knowing what he is saying. And he can't
  write. But he got sketching and scrawling various things on some paper, and
  his scrawls&mdash;together with another thing or two&mdash;have given me an
  idea. We're following it up now. When we are less busy, and in a quiet place,
  I'll show you the sketches and explain things generally; there's no time now,
  and I <i>may</i> want your help for a bit, in which case ignorance may
  prevent you spoiling things, you clumsy ruffian. Hullo! here we are, I
  think!"</p>

  <p>We had stopped at the end of another stableyard, rather dirtier than the
  first. The stables were sound but inelegant sheds, and one or two appeared to
  be devoted to other purposes, having low chimneys, on one of which an old
  basket was rakishly set by way of cowl. Beside the entrance a worn-out old
  board was nailed, with the legend, "Stabling to Let," in letters formerly
  white on a ground formerly black.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Hewitt, "we'll explore."</p>

  <p>We picked our way over the greasy cobble-stones and looked about us. On
  the left was the wall enclosing certain back-yards, and on the right the
  stables. Two doors in the middle of these were open, and a butcher's young
  man, who with his shiny bullet head would have been known for a butcher's
  young man anywhere, was wiping over the new-washed wheel of a smart butcher's
  cart.</p>

  <p>"Good-day," Hewitt said pleasantly to the young man. "I notice there's
  some stabling to let here. Now, where should I inquire about it?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic41"
     name="pic41"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-6-5.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"Jones, Whitfield Street," the young man answered, giving the wheel a
  final spin. "But there's only one little place to let now, I think, and it
  ain't very grand."</p>

  <p>"Oh, which is that?"</p>

  <p>"Next but one to the street there. A chap 'ad it for wood-choppin', but 'e
  chucked it. There ain't room for more'n a donkey an' a barrow."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's a pity. We're not particular, but want something big enough,
  and we don't mind paying a fair price. Perhaps we might make an arrangement
  with somebody here who has a stable?"</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think so," he said doubtfully; "they're mostly shop-people as
  wants all the room theirselves. My guv'nor couldn't do nothink, I know. These
  'ere two stables ain't scarcely enough for all 'e wants as it is. Then
  there's Barkett the greengrocer 'ere next door. <i>That</i> ain't no good.
  Then, next to that, there's the little place as is to let, and at the end
  there's Griffith's at the buttershop."</p>

  <p>"And those the other way?"</p>

  <p>"Well, this 'ere first one's Curtis's, Euston Road&mdash;that's a
  butter-shop, too, an' 'e 'as the next after that. The last one, up at the
  end&mdash;I dunno quite whose that is. It ain't been long took, but I b'lieve
  it's some foreign baker's. I ain't ever see anythink come out of it, though;
  but there's a 'orse there, I know&mdash;I seen the feed took in."</p>

  <p>Hewitt turned thoughtfully away.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said. "I suppose we can't manage it, then. Good-day."</p>

  <p>We walked to the street as the butcher's young man wheeled in his cart and
  flung away his pail of water.</p>

  <p>"Will you just hang about here, Brett," he asked, "while I hurry round to
  the nearest ironmonger's? I shan't be gone long. We're going to work a little
  burglary. Take note if anybody comes to that stable at the farther end."</p>

  <p>He hurried away and I waited. In a few moments the butcher's young man
  shut his doors and went whistling down the street, and in a few moments more
  Hewitt appeared.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "there's nobody about now; we'll lose no time. I've
  bought a pair of pliers and a few nails."</p>

  <p>We re-entered the yard at the door of the last stable. Hewitt stooped and
  examined the padlock. Taking a nail in his pliers he bent it carefully
  against the brick wall. Then using the nail as a key, still held by the
  pliers, and working the padlock gently in his left hand, in an astonishingly
  few seconds he had released the hasp and taken off the padlock. "I'm not
  altogether a bad burglar," he remarked. "Not so bad, really."</p>

  <p>The padlock fastened a bar which, when removed, allowed the door to be
  opened. Opening it, Hewitt immediately seized a candle stuck in a bottle
  which stood on a shelf, pulled me in, and closed the door behind us.</p>

  <p>"We'll do this by candle-light," he said, as he struck a match. "If the
  door were left open it would be seen from the street. Keep your ears open in
  case anybody comes down the yard."</p>

  <p>The part of the shed that we stood in was used as a coach-house, and was
  occupied by a rather shabby tradesman's cart, the shafts of which rested on
  the ground. From the stall adjoining came the sound of the shuffling and
  trampling of an impatient horse.</p>

  <p>We turned to the cart. On the name-board at the side were painted in worn
  letters the words, "Schuyler, Baker." The address, which had been below, was
  painted out.</p>

  <p>Hewitt took out the pins and let down the tailboard. Within the cart was a
  new bed-mattress which covered the whole surface at the bottom. I felt it,
  pressed it from the top, and saw that it was an ordinary spring
  mattress&mdash;perhaps rather unusually soft in the springs. It seemed a
  curious thing to keep in a baker's cart.</p>

  <p>Hewitt, who had set the candle on a convenient shelf, plunged his arm into
  the farthermost recesses of the cart and brought forth a very long French
  loaf, and then another. Diving again he produced certain loaves of the sort
  known as the "plain cottage "&mdash;two sets of four each, each set baked
  together in a row. "Feel this bread," said Hewitt, and I felt it. It was
  stale&mdash;almost as hard as wood.</p>

  <p>Hewitt produced a large pocket-knife, and with what seemed to me to be
  superfluous care and elaboration, cut into the top of one of the cottage
  loaves. Then he inserted his fingers in the gap he had made and firmly but
  slowly tore the hard bread into two pieces. He pulled away the crumb from
  within till there was nothing left but a rather thick outer shell.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, rather to himself than to me, "there's nothing in
  <i>that</i>." He lifted one of the very long French loaves and measured it
  against the interior of the cart. It had before been propped diagonally, and
  now it was noticeable that it was just a shade longer than the inside of the
  cart was wide. Jammed in, in fact, it held firmly. Hewitt produced his knife
  again, and divided this long loaf in the centre; there was nothing but bread
  in <i>that</i>. The horse in the stall fidgeted more than ever.</p>

  <p>"That horse hasn't been fed lately, I fancy," Hewitt said. "We'll give the
  poor chap a bit of this hay in the corner."</p>

  <p>"But," I said, "what about this bread? What did you expect to find in it?
  I can't see what you're driving at."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," Hewitt replied, "I'm driving after something I expect to
  find; and close at hand here, too. How are your nerves to-day&mdash;pretty
  steady? The thing may try them."</p>

  <p>Before I could reply there was a sound of footsteps in the yard outside,
  approaching. Hewitt lifted his finger instantly for silence and whispered
  hurriedly, "There's only one. If he comes <i>here</i>, we grab him."</p>

  <p>The steps came nearer and stopped outside the door. There was a pause, and
  then a slight drawing in of breath, as of a person suddenly surprised. At
  that moment the door was slightly shifted ajar and an eye peeped in.</p>

  <p>"Catch him!" said Hewitt aloud, as we sprang to the door. "He mustn't get
  away!"</p>

  <p>I had been nearer the doorway, and was first through it. The stranger ran
  down the yard at his best, but my legs were the longer, and half-way to the
  street I caught him by the shoulder and swung him round. Like lightning he
  whipped out a knife, and I flung in my left instantly on the chance of
  flooring him. It barely checked him, however, and the knife swung short of my
  chest by no more than two inches; but Hewitt had him by the wrist and tripped
  him forward on his face. He struggled like a wild beast, and Hewitt had to
  stand on his forearm and force up his wrist till the bones were near breaking
  before he dropped his knife. But throughout the struggle the man never
  shouted, called for help, nor, indeed, made the slightest sound, and we on
  our part were equally silent.</p>

  <p>It was quickly over, of course, for he was on his face, and we were two.
  We dragged our prisoner into the stable and closed the door behind us. So far
  as we had seen, nobody had witnessed the capture from the street, though, of
  course, we had been too busy to be certain.</p>

  <p>"There's a set of harness hanging over at the back," said Hewitt; "I think
  we'll tie him up with the traces and reins&mdash;nothing like leather. We
  don't need a gag; I know he won't shout."</p>

  <p>While I got the straps Hewitt held the prisoner by a peculiar
  neck-and-wrist grip that forbade him to move except at the peril of a snapped
  arm. He had probably never been a person of pleasant aspect, being short,
  strongly and squatly built, large and ugly of feature, and wild and dirty of
  hair and beard. And now, his face flushed with struggling and smeared with
  mud from the stableyard, his nose bleeding and his forehead exhibiting a
  growing bump, he looked particularly repellent. We strapped his elbows
  together behind, and as he sullenly ignored a demand for the contents of his
  pockets Hewitt unceremoniously turned them out. Helpless as he was, the man
  struggled to prevent this, though, of course, ineffectually. There were
  papers, tobacco, a bunch of keys, and various odds and ends. Hewitt was
  glancing hastily at the papers when, suddenly dropping them, he caught the
  prisoner by the shoulder and pulled him away from a partly-consumed hay-truss
  which stood in a corner, and toward which he had quietly sidled.</p>

  <p><a id="pic42"
     name="pic42"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1403221h-images/Chronicles-6-6.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Keep him still," said Hewitt; "we haven't examined this place yet." And
  he commenced to pull away the hay from the corner.</p>

  <p>Presently a large piece of sackcloth was revealed, and this being lifted
  left visible below it another batch of loaves of the same sort as we had seen
  in the cart. There were a dozen of them in one square batch, and the only
  thing about them that differed them from those in the cart was their
  position, for the batch lay bottom side up.</p>

  <p>"That's enough, I think," Hewitt said. "Don't touch them, for Heaven's
  sake!" He picked up the papers he had dropped. "That has saved us a little
  search," he continued. "See here, Brett; I was in the act of telling you my
  suspicions when this little affair interrupted me. If you care to look at one
  or two of these letters you'll see what I should have told you. It's
  Anarchism and bombs, of course. I'm about as certain as I can be that there's
  a reversible dynamite bomb inside each of those innocent loaves, though I
  assure you I don't mean meddling with them now. But see here. Will you go and
  bring in a four-wheeler? Bring it right down the yard. There's more to do,
  and we mustn't attract attention."</p>

  <p>I hurried away and found the cab. The meaning of the loaves, the cart, and
  the spring-mattress was now plain. There was an Anarchist plot to carry out a
  number of explosions probably simul' taneously, in different parts of the
  city. I had, of course, heard much of the terrible "reversing"
  bombs&mdash;those bombs which, containing a tube of acid plugged by wadding,
  required no fuse, and only needed to be inverted to be set going to explode
  in a few minutes. The loaves containing these bombs would form an effectual
  "blind," and they were to be distributed, probably in broad daylight, in the
  most natural manner possible, in a baker's cart. A man would be waiting near
  the scene of each contemplated explosion. He would be given a loaf taken from
  the inverted batch. He would take it&mdash;perhaps wrapped in paper, but
  still inverted, and apparently the most innocent object possible&mdash;to the
  spot selected, deposit it, right side up&mdash;which would reverse the inner
  tube and set up the action&mdash;in some quiet corner, behind a door or what
  not, and make his own escape, while the explosion tore down walls
  and&mdash;if the experiment were lucky&mdash;scattered the flesh and bones of
  unsuspecting people.</p>

  <p>The infernal loaves were made and kept reversed, to begin with, in order
  to stand more firmly, and&mdash;if observed&mdash;more naturally, when turned
  over to explode. Even if a child picked up the loaf and carried it off, that
  child at least would be blown to atoms, which at any rate would have been
  something for the conspirators to congratulate themselves upon. The
  spring-mattress, of course, was to ease the jolting to the bombs, and obviate
  any random jerking loose of the acid, which might have had the deplorable
  result of sacrificing the valuable life of the conspirator who drove the
  cart. The other loaves, too, with no explosive contents, had their use. The
  two long ones, which fitted across the inside of the cart, would be jammed
  across so as to hold the bombs in the centre, and the others would be used to
  pack the batch on the other sides and prevent any dangerous slipping about.
  The thing seemed pretty plain, except that as yet I had no idea of how Hewitt
  learned anything of the business.</p>

  <p>I brought the four-wheeler up to the door of the stable and we thrust the
  man into it, and Hewitt locked the stable door with its proper key. Then we
  drove off to Tottenham Court Road police-station, and, by Hewitt's order,
  straight into the yard.</p>

  <p>In less than ten minutes from our departure from the stable our prisoner
  was finally secured, and Hewitt was deep in consultation with police
  officials. Messengers were sent and telegrams despatched, and presently
  Hewitt came to me with information.</p>

  <p>"The name of the helpless Frenchman the police found this morning," he
  said, "appears to be Grard&mdash;at least I am almost certain of it. Among
  the papers found on the prisoner&mdash;whose full name doesn't appear, but
  who seems to be spoken of as Luigi (he is Italian)&mdash;among the papers, I
  say, is a sort of notice convening a meeting for this evening to decide as to
  the 'final punishment' to be awarded the 'traitor Grard, now in charge of
  comrade Pingard.'</p>

  <p>"The place of meeting is not mentioned, but it seems more than probable
  that it will be at the Bakunin Club, not five minutes' walk from this place.
  The police have all these places under quiet observation, of course, and that
  is the club at which apparently important Anarchist meetings have been held
  lately. It is the only club that has never been raided as yet, and, it would
  seem, the only one they would feel at all safe in using for anything
  important.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, Luigi just now simply declined to open his mouth when asked
  where the meeting was to be, and said nothing when the names of several other
  places were suggested, but suddenly found his tongue at the mention of the
  Bakunin Club, and denied vehemently that the meeting was to be there&mdash;it
  was the only thing he uttered. So that it seems pretty safe to assume that it
  <i>is</i> to be there. Now, of course, the matter's very serious. Men have
  been despatched to take charge of the stable very quietly, and the club is to
  be taken possession of at once&mdash;also very quietly. It must be done
  without a moment's delay, and as there is a chance that the only detective
  officers within reach at the moment may be known by sight, I have undertaken
  to get in first. Perhaps you'll come? We may have to take the door with a
  rush."</p>

  <p>Of course I meant to miss nothing if I could help it, and said so.</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied Hewitt, "we'll get ourselves up a bit." He began
  taking off his collar and tie. "It is getting dusk," he proceeded, "and we
  shan't want old clothes to make ourselves look sufficiently shabby. We're
  both wearing bowler hats, which is lucky. Make a dent in yours&mdash;if you
  can do so without permanently damaging it."</p>

  <p>We got rid of our collars and made chokers of our ties. We turned our
  coat-collars up at one side only, and then, with dented hats worn raffishly,
  and our hands in our pockets, we looked disreputable enough for all practical
  purposes in twilight. A cordon of plain-clothes police had already been
  forming round the club, we were told, and so we sallied forth. We turned into
  Windmill Street, crossed Whitfield Street, and in a turning or two we came to
  the Bakunin Club. I could see no sign of anything like a ring of policemen,
  and said so. Hewitt chuckled. "Of course not," he said; "they don't go about
  a job of this sort with drums beating and flags flying. But they are all
  there, and some are watching us. There is the house. I'll negotiate."</p>

  <p>The house was one of the very shabby <i>pass</i> sort that abound in that
  quarter. The very narrow area was railed over, and almost choked with
  rubbish. Visible above it were three floors, the lowest indicated by the door
  and one window, and the other two by two windows each&mdash;mean and dirty
  all. A faint light appeared in the top floor, and another from somewhere
  behind the refuse-heaped area. Everywhere else was in darkness. Hewitt looked
  intently into the area, but it was impossible to discern anything behind the
  sole grimy patch of window that was visible. Then we stepped lightly up the
  three or four steps to the door and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>We could hear slippered feet mounting a stair and approaching. A latch was
  shifted, a door opened six inches, an indistinct face appeared, and a female
  voice asked, "<i>Qui est l?</i>"</p>

  <p>"<i>Deux camarades</i>," Hewitt grunted testily. "<i>Ouvrez vite</i>."</p>

  <p>I had noticed that the door was kept from opening further by a short
  chain. This chain the woman unhooked from the door, but still kept the latter
  merely ajar, as though intending to assure herself still further. But Hewitt
  immediately pushed the door back, planted his foot against it, and entered,
  asking carelessly as he did so, "<i>O se trouve Luigi?</i>"</p>

  <p>I followed on his heels, and in the dark could just distinguish that
  Hewitt pushed the woman instantly against the wall and clapped his hand to
  her mouth. At the same moment a file of quiet men were suddenly visible
  ascending the steps at my heels. They were the police.</p>

  <p><a id="pic44"

  <p>The door was closed behind us almost noiselessly, and a match was struck.
  Two men stood at the bottom of the stairs, and the others searched the house.
  Only two men were found&mdash;both in a top room. They were secured and
  brought down.</p>

  <p>The woman was now ungagged, and she used her tongue at a great rate. One
  of the men was a small, meek-looking slip of a fellow, and he appeared to be
  the woman's husband. "Eh, messieurs le police," she exclaimed vehemently, "it
  ees not of 'im, mon pauvre Pierre, zat you sail rrun in. 'Im and me&mdash;we
  are not of the clob&mdash;we work only&mdash;we housekeep."</p>

  <p>Hewitt whispered to an officer, and the two men were taken below. Then
  Hewitt spoke to the woman, whose protests had not ceased. "You say you are
  not of the club," he said, "but what is there to prove that? If you are but
  housekeepers, as you say, you have nothing to fear. But you can only prove it
  by giving the police information. For instance, now, about Grard. What have
  they done with him?"</p>

  <p>"Jean Pingard&mdash;'im you 'ave take downstairs&mdash;'e 'ave lose 'im.
  Jean Pingard get last night all a-boosa&mdash;all dronk like zis "&mdash;she
  rolled her head and shoulders to express intoxication&mdash;"and he sleep too
  much to-day, when mile go out, and Grard, he go too, and nobody know. I
  will tell you anysing. We are not of the clob&mdash;we housekeep, me and
  Pierre."</p>

  <p>"But what did they do to Grard before he went away?"</p>

  <p>The woman was ready and anxious to tell anything. Grard had been selected
  to do something&mdash;what it was exactly she did not know, but there was a
  horse and cart, and he was to drive it. Where the horse and cart was also she
  did not know, but Grard had driven a cart before in his work for a baker,
  and he was to drive one in connection with some scheme among the members of
  the club. But <i>le pauvre Grard</i> at the last minute disliked to drive
  the cart; he had fear. He did not say he had fear, but he prepared a
  letter&mdash;a letter that was not signed. The letter was to be sent to the
  police, and it told them the whereabouts of the horse and cart, so that the
  police might seize these things, and then there would be nothing for Grard,
  who had fear, to do in the way of driving. No, he did not betray the names of
  the comrades, but he told the place of the horse and the cart.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the letter was never sent. There was suspicion, and the
  letter was found in a pocket and read. Then there was a meeting, and Grard
  was confronted with his letter. He could say nothing but "<i>Je le
  nie!</i>"&mdash;found no explanation but that. There was much noise, and she
  had observed from a staircase, from which one might see through a ventilating
  hole, Grard had much fear&mdash;very much fear. His face was white, and it
  moved; he prayed for mercy, and they talked of killing him. It was discussed
  how he should be killed, and the poor Grard was more terrified. He was made
  to take off his collar, and a razor was drawn across his throat, though
  without cutting him, till he fainted.</p>

  <p>Then water was flung over him, and he was struck in the face till he
  revived. He again repeated, "<i>je le nie! je le nie!</i>" and nothing more.
  Then one struck him with a bottle, and another with a stick; the point of a
  knife was put against his throat and held there, but this time he did not
  faint, but cried softly, as a man who is drunk, "<i>je le nie! je le
  nie!</i>" So they tied a handkerchief about his neck, and twisted it till his
  face grew purple and black, and his eyes were round and terrible, and then
  they struck his face, and he fainted again. But they took away the
  handkerchief, having fear that they could not easily get rid of the body if
  he were killed, for there was no preparation. So they decided to meet again
  and discuss when there would be preparation. Wherefore they took him away to
  the rooms of Jean Pingard&mdash;of Jean and mile Pingard&mdash;in Henry
  Street, Golden Square. But mile Pingard had gone out, and Jean was drunk and
  slept, and they lost him. Jean Pingard was he downstairs&mdash;the taller of
  the two; the other was but <i>le pauvre Pierre</i>, who, with herself, was
  not of the club. They worked only; they were the keepers of the house. There
  was nothing for which they should be arrested, and she would give the police
  any information they might ask.</p>

  <p>"As I thought, you see," Hewitt said to me, "the man's nerves have broken
  down under the terror and the strain, and aphasia is the result. I think I
  told you that the only articulate thing he could say was '<i>Je le nie!</i>'
  and now we know how those words were impressed on him till he now pronounces
  them mechanically, with no idea of their meaning. Come, we can do no more
  here now. But wait a moment."</p>

  <p>There were footsteps outside. The light was removed, and a policeman went
  to the door and opened it as soon as the bell rang. Three men stepped in one
  after another, and the door was immediately shut behind them&mdash;they were
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>We left quietly, and although we, of course, expected it, it was not till
  the next morning that we learned absolutely that the largest arrest of
  Anarchists ever made in this country was made at the Bakunin Club that night.
  Each man as he came was admitted&mdash;and collared.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We made our way to Luzatti's, and it was over our dinner
  that Hewitt put me in full possession of the earlier facts of this case,
  which I have set down as impersonal narrative in their proper place at the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>"But," I said, "what of that aimless scribble you spoke of that Grard
  made in the police station? Can I see it?"</p>

  <p>Hewitt turned to where his coat hung behind him and took a handful of
  papers from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Most of these," he said, "mean nothing at all. <i>That</i> is what he
  wrote at first," and he handed me the first of the two papers which were
  presented in facsimile in the earlier part of this narrative.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "he has begun mechanically from long use to write
  'monsieur'&mdash;the usual beginning of a letter. But he scarcely makes three
  letters before tailing off into sheer scribble. He tries again and again, and
  although once there is something very like 'que,' and once something like a
  word preceded by a negative 'n,' the whole thing is meaningless.</p>

  <p>"This," (he handed me the other paper which has been printed in facsimile)
  "<i>does</i> mean something, though Grard never intended it. Can you spot
  the meaning? Really, I think it's pretty plain&mdash;especially now that you
  know as much as I about the day's adventures. The thing at the top left-hand
  corner, I may tell you, Grard intended for a sketch of a clock on the
  mantelpiece in the police station."</p>

  <p>I stared hard at the paper, but could make nothing whatever of it. "I only
  see the horse-shoe clock," I said, "and a sort of second, unsuccessful
  attempt to draw it again. Then there is a horseshoe dotted, but scribbled
  over, and then a sort of kite or balloon on a string, a Highlander,
  and&mdash;well, I don't understand it, I confess. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I'll explain what I learned from that," Hewitt said, "and also what led
  me to look for it. From what the inspector told me, I judged the man to be in
  a very curious state, and I took a fancy to see him. Most I was curious to
  know why he should have a terror of bread at one moment and eat it ravenously
  at another. When I saw him I felt pretty sure that he was not mad, in the
  common sense of the term. As far as I could judge it seemed to be a case of
  aphasia.</p>

  <p>"Then when the doctor came I had a chat (as I have already told you) with
  the policeman who found the man. He told me about the incident of the bread
  with rather more detail than I had had from the inspector. Thus it was plain
  that the man was terrified at the bread only when it was in the form of a
  loaf, and ate it eagerly when it was cut into pieces. That was <i>one</i>
  thing to bear in mind. He was not afraid of bread, but only of a
  <i>loaf</i>.</p>

  <p>"Very well. I asked the policeman to find another uncut loaf, and to put
  it near the man when his attention was diverted. Meantime the doctor reported
  that my suspicion as to aphasia was right. The man grew more comfortable, and
  was assured that he was among friends and had nothing to fear, so that when
  at length he found the loaf near his elbow he was not so violently terrified,
  only very uneasy. I watched him and saw him turn it bottom up&mdash;a very
  curious thing to do; he immediately became less uneasy&mdash;the turning over
  of the loaf seemed to have set his mind at, rest in some way. This was more
  curious still. I thought for some little while before accepting the bomb
  theory as the most probable.</p>

  <p>"The doctor left, and I determined to give the man another chance with pen
  and paper. I felt pretty certain that if he were allowed to scribble and
  sketch as he pleased, sooner or later he would do something that would give
  me some sort of a hint. I left him entirely alone and let him do as he
  pleased, but I watched.</p>

  <p>"After all the futile scribble which you have seen, he began to sketch,
  first a man's head, then a chair&mdash;just what he might happen to see in
  the room. Presently he took to the piece of paper you have before you. He
  observed that clock and began to sketch it, then went on to other things,
  such as you see, scribbling idly over most of them when finished. When he had
  made the last of the sketches he made a hasty scrawl of his pen over it and
  broke down. It had brought his terror to his mind again somehow.</p>

  <p>"I seized the paper and examined it closely. Now just see. Ignore the
  clock, which was merely a sketch of a thing before him, and look at the three
  things following. What are they? A horseshoe, a captive balloon, and a
  Highlander. Now, can't you think of something those three things in that
  order suggest?"</p>

  <p>I could think of nothing whatever, and I confessed as much.</p>

  <p>"Think, now. Tottenham Court Road!"</p>

  <p>I started. "Of course," I said. "That never struck me. There's the
  Horse-shoe Hotel, with the sign outside, there's the large toy and fancy shop
  half-way up, where they have a captive balloon moored to the roof as an
  advertisement, and there's the tobacco and snuff shop on the left, toward the
  other end, where they have a life-size wooden Highlander at the door&mdash;an
  uncommon thing, indeed, nowadays."</p>

  <p>"You are right. The curious conjunction struck me at once. There they are,
  all three, and just in the order in which one meets them going up from Oxford
  Street. Also, as if to confirm the conjecture, note the <i>dotted</i>
  horse-shoe. Don't you remember that at night the Horse-shoe Hotel sign is
  illuminated by two rows of gas lights?</p>

  <p>"Now here was my clue at last. Plainly, this man, in his mechanical
  sketching, was following a regular train of thought, and unconsciously
  illustrating it as he went along. Many people in perfect health and mental
  soundness do the same thing if a pen and a piece of waste paper be near. The
  man's train of thought led him, in memory, up Tottenham Court Road, and
  further, to where some disagreeable recollection upset him. It was my
  business to trace this train of thought. Do you remember the feat of Dupin in
  Poe's story, 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue'&mdash;how he walks by his
  friend's side in silence for some distance, and then suddenly breaks out with
  a divination of his thoughts, having silently traced them from a fruiterer
  with a basket, through paving-stones, Epicurus, Dr. Nichols, the
  constellation Orion, and a Latin poem, to a cobbler lately turned actor?</p>

  <p>"Well, it was some such task as this (but infinitely simpler, as a matter
  of fact) that was set me. This man begins by drawing the horse-shoe clock.
  Having done with that, and with the horse-shoe still in his mind, he starts
  to draw a horse-shoe simply. It is a failure, and he scribbles it out. His
  mind at once turns to the Horse-shoe Hotel, which he knows from frequently
  passing it, and its sign of gas-jets. He sketches <i>that</i>, making dots
  for the gas lights. Once started in Tottenham Court Road, his mind naturally
  follows his usual route along it. He remembers the advertising captive
  balloon halfway up, and down <i>that</i> goes on his paper. In imagination he
  crosses the road, and keeps on till he comes to the very noticeable
  Highlander outside the tobacconist's. <i>That</i> is sketched. Thus it is
  plain that a familiar route with him was from New Oxford Street up Tottenham
  Court Road.</p>

  <p>"At the police-station I ventured to guess from this that he lived
  somewhere near Seven Dials. Perhaps before long we shall know if this was
  right. But to return to the sketches. After the Highlander there is something
  at first not very distinct. A little examination, however, shows it to be
  intended for a chimney-pot partly covered with a basket. Now an old basket,
  stuck sideways on a chimney by way of cowl, is not an uncommon thing in parts
  of the country, but it is very unusual in London. Probably, then, it would be
  in some bystreet or alley. Next and last, there is a horse's head, and it was
  at this that the man's trouble returned to him.</p>

  <p>"Now, when one goes to a place and finds a horse there, that place is not
  uncommonly a stable; and, as a matter of fact, the basket-cowl would be much
  more likely to be found in use in a range of back stabling than anywhere
  else. Suppose, then, that after taking the direction indicated in the
  sketches&mdash;the direction of Fitzroy Square, in fact&mdash;one were to
  find a range of stabling with a basket-cowl visible about it? I know my
  London pretty well, as you are aware, and I could remember but two likely
  stable-yards in that particular part&mdash;the two we looked at, in the
  second of which you may possibly have noticed just such a basket-cowl as I
  have been speaking of.</p>

  <p>"Well, what we did you know, and that we found confirmation of my
  conjecture about the loaves you also know. It was the recollection of the
  horse and cart, and what they were to transport, and what the end of it all
  had been, that upset Grard as he drew the horse's head. You will notice that
  the sketches have not been done in separate rows, left to right&mdash;they
  have simply followed one another all round the paper, which means
  preoccupation and unconsciousness on the part of the man who made them."</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "supposing those loaves to contain bombs, how were the
  bombs put there? Baking the bread round them would have been risky, wouldn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. What they did was to cut the loaves, each row, down the
  centre. Then most of the crumb was scooped out, the explosive inserted, and
  the sides joined up and glued. I thought you had spotted the joins, though
  they certainly were neat."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't examine closely. Luigi, of course, had been told off for a
  daily visit to feed the horse, and that is how we caught him."</p>

  <p>"One supposes so. They hadn't rearranged their plans as to going on with
  the outrages after Grard's defection. By the way, I noticed that he was
  accustomed to driving when I first saw him. There was an unmistakable mark on
  his coat, just at the small of the back, that drivers get who lean against a
  rail in a cart."</p>

  <p>The loaves were examined by official experts, and, as everybody now knows,
  were found to contain, as Hewitt had supposed, large charges of dynamite.
  What became of some half-dozen of the men captured is also well known: their
  sentences were exemplary.</p>
