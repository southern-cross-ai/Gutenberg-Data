ADMIRAL SIR GUY GAUNT</b><br>
<br>
I dedicate this book, with grateful thanks for the trouble he has
taken with it. Had he not sailed the <i>Bounty's</i> boat from
Tahiti to the Great Barrier, had he not told me what the Great
Barrier was like, I could never have written it. I hope he will
take it as a remembrance of the pleasant time we two spent in
Polperro together many years ago.<br>
<br>
Also I would warmly thank Sir Robert Roden, the late Chief Justice
of Honduras, who helped me with his legal knowledge, and my friend
Mrs. Lang, whose drastic criticism is always a godsend to me.<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'They that go down to the sea in
ships,<br>
That do business in great waters. . . .'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>'A fine evening, skipper,' said Lieutenant Thomas Quested.</p>

<p>The setting sun shone on all the bravery of his blue and gold,
for men wore their uniforms habitually at the end of the eighteenth
century, even as they did later in the days of the Great War.</p>

<p>The naval officer would hardly have thought of addressing the
skipper of the <i>Reaper,</i> even though she was a fine brig and
he was her owner and a man of property besides, but Daniel Reynell
had on his arm a very pretty girl in a red cloak. He knew now, to
his own dismay, did Thomas Quested, he would do a great deal for
Loveday Corthew. And Loveday Corthew was to wed the sailor man at
the New Year.</p>

<p>'It's not going to last,' said Reynell looking round. 'There's a
body of rain coming up from the south soon. If we get it at the
spring tide the town is like to be flooded again.'</p>

<p>A careless speech made in an idle moment!</p>

<p>Years after Daniel Reynell, looking back, remembering that
December night, knew it was that prophecy which altered the whole
course of his life. It was the gentle thoughtless push which set
the overwhelming avalanche in motion.</p>

<p>To many of us in our lives come such moments. It is only
afterwards that we recognise them&mdash;only when, for weal or for
woe, the deed is done, the passing years have set their seal upon
it, and it is too late to alter.</p>

<p>'Is the town often flooded?' asked Quested curiously. It was as
if a devil were crying, 'Here is your opportunity!' 'It must make a
lot of confusion, I should think.'</p>

<p>'It does,' said the skipper of the <i>Reaper</i>.</p>

<p>The wind was coming up in little puffs from the south-west, a
warm, wet wind. At the foot of the Peak the white water was showing
on the Rocks. There was a mist over the sea, too, the clouds hung
low and the sea birds swept down with a piteous wail in their
cries.</p>

<p>The pilchard boats, one after the other, were slipping out of
the harbour, making long stretches first to the east and then away
to the west because of the head wind. Presently he would have to go
and do a kindly act; but he hesitated about leaving Loveday Corthew
with the navy man, who spoke to him indeed, but whose eyes never
left the face of the fair-haired girl beside him.</p>

<p>'But it doesn't often happen,' he went on. 'It wants a high wind
from the south, a spring tide and a heavy fall of rain to fill up
the stream.'</p>

<p>'It's near the new moon now,' said Quested thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Friday,' said Reynell, 'but we don't always flood the town with
a spring tide. I hope for the housewives' sakes we won't this time.
Good evening to you.'</p>

<p>'Good evening.'</p>

<p>Quested saw the roses in Loveday's cheeks deepen as she dropped
her laughing hazel eyes before the look in his dark ones. They
glowed dangerously though he did not know it. She found it
necessary to remind herself she was to wed Daniel Reynell at the
New Year, and Lieutenant Quested was nothing at all to her.</p>

<p>He looked back at Chaple Rock. It was the usual thing at
Polperro to sit on Chaple Rock and smoke in the evening. He might
as well watch the fishing boats. Then he caught sight of a girl
leaning over the half-door of the Pilchard, a girl with a mop of
hair dark as the raven's wing, deep sad eyes blue as the sea, red
lips, teeth like pearls, and skin that had the delicate cream of
the magnolia, the makings of a lovely woman, thought the man who
knew the world. The fisher folk of Polperro did not recognise the
beauty in their midst. It was too uncanny for their simple taste.
They only saw in Joan of the Pilchard an alien. They laughed even
when she claimed her father's name. Oh they remembered him well
enough. He had been wrecked on the cruel Cornish coast, and had
taken away with him the daughter of old Tom Olivier, the poorest,
most feckless fisherman in the little town.</p>

<p>When she came back thirteen years after, with what, to Polperro,
was plenty of money in her pocket, and a tall lanky girl of twelve
by her side, Polperro shook its head over her. It did not believe,
what Joan knew was the simple truth, that José d'Ath had honestly
married the girl and done his very best to make a good husband and
father.</p>

<p>The fisher girl had wearied of the gentleman long before he had
thoroughly wakened to the awful mistake he had made. When he died
she had joyfully and thankfully taken her inheritance and her
child&mdash;because she was only a girl her father's people had let
her go&mdash;and gone back to the place of her birth.</p>

<p>The money in her pocket took the sting out of scornful looks.
She bought the Pilchard, and married a man who was much more to her
taste. Husband and wife were cheerful, if not boisterous, on their
own ale by noon; by four o'clock they were stupid.</p>

<p>To Joan had come the bitterness.</p>

<p>She had been torn away from the class to which she belonged,
from the comfort and refinement of her Spanish home, and set down
in a little low fishermen's tavern. She resented the tavern,
resented the coarse stepfather, resented the tone the fisherfolk in
their unco righteousness took towards herself, resented her lot
with a dumb child's resentment, never fitted into the new
environment.</p>

<p>The environment scorned and treated her, the girl who had the
blood of proud Spanish nobles in her veins, simply as the drudge of
the Pilchard.</p>

<p>She <i>was</i> the drudge. Gradually, as her mother and
stepfather gave way to their besetting sin, all the burden of the
inn fell on her young shoulders. She took it up and worked, from
dawn till dark worked sullenly, hopelessly, with that smouldering
bitterness in her heart behind all she did.</p>

<p>As she leaned over the half door this December day she looked
the ill-tempered slave she was. Her feet were bare; her short
winsey skirt of a dark dull red was dirty and torn, the jacket open
at the round young throat was not set off by a kerchief. The deep
sea-blue eyes watched the young couple go down the street, then
they wandered to the young man in uniform who was also
watching.</p>

<p>He did not look in silence. He cursed aloud.</p>

<p>Why, she wondered idly, should Lieutenant Quested swear. If she,
Joan, had cursed&#8212;&#8212;But she was inarticulate. Reynell was
the light of her eyes and the desire of her heart.</p>

<p>She was under no delusion with regard to him. Joan always saw
things clearly. He had chucked her under the chin, turned her face
up to his, said she had eyes like the sea on a summer's day and
kissed her. Once even, when the <i>Reaper</i> had come back from
France, he had brought her an orange scarf which he said would set
off her dark hair. It didn't suit her. She knew it, but that scarf
was her greatest treasure, folded away as too precious to wear save
on great occasions that never came into her poor starved, drab
life.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell never looked at her now. He was going to marry
Loveday Corthew, whom he had known ever since she was a baby, and
whom he had courted ever since she had blossomed into the belle of
the district round. Joan's sorrow was beyond all tears, a dull
aching, hopelessness that could never be put into words.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Quested was vehement in the language he used. He was
a fine-looking fellow, not as tall or as handsome or as broad
shouldered as Daniel Reynell; but then the fisherman's jersey could
not compare with the blue and gold of the navy, and his powdered
hair made his eyes look dark.</p>

<p>He saw Joan looking at him and sombrely crossed the street.</p>

<p>'What's offended you, my maid?' he asked, seeing his own chagrin
reflected on her face. He put his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Naught,' said Joan sullenly, 'an' a'll thank 'ee to keep hands
to 'eeself.'</p>

<p>Joan's Spanish was that of a lady. Her English that of the
fisher class to which she belonged.</p>

<p>'He's a pretty lad, eh, Joan?' the King's man went on, though it
was of the maid he was thinking. Because he could do nothing, there
was some easement to be got out of talking to this girl whom he
thought could not understand his feelings.</p>

<p>There Lieutenant Quested made a mistake. The maid of the inn
read him through and through.</p>

<p>'She's a winsome maid,' he went on.</p>

<p>Joan said nothing. The matter did not seem to call for
remark.</p>

<p>'He ought to be in his Majesty's navy.'</p>

<p>'Her's skipper and owner of <i>Reaper</i> in harbour there.
Her's not for Navy,' said Joan. 'Her hath a permit.'</p>

<p>'And the pretty maid? What about her?'</p>

<p>'Her'll wed she at New Year,' said Joan as if every word were
wrung from her. She noticed that the other flinched. The New Year
was so close.</p>

<p>'He'd make a good King's man, wouldn't he, Joan?' said Quested
again, because having plunged into the conversation he was not
minded to leave it just as the words he hated had been said.</p>

<p>'Her hath a permit,' said Joan again.</p>

<p>'Oh her hath a hermit, hath her?' mimicked Quested, showing Joan
the fault in her own speech, 'but if her were serving the King her
couldn't marry that other pretty maid, eh my wench, what think you
of that?' and he scorned himself for saying it, scorned himself for
so nearly putting his desire into words.</p>

<p>Joan raised to him a pair of blue eyes into which something
flashed that let a light into his own soul.</p>

<p>He turned away silent and sullen as Joan herself.</p>

<p>If Daniel Reynell, who had a permit, were serving in his
Majesty's Navy he could not wed Loveday Corthew on New Year's Day,
and if Loveday were not wed on New Year's Day who knew but
that&mdash;and Lieutenant Quested cursed again. Why did he think of
Loveday Corthew? Suppose she were free to wed him&mdash;suppose he
could win her&mdash;suppose he married her. That would end his
career in the Navy. And he did not want to leave the Navy. He was
quite sure of that.</p>

<p>But Loveday had bonny curling hair, she had dancing hazel eyes,
and laughing lips. She would stick in a man's mind. Did she love
Daniel Reynell? Did she know what love meant? He was sure she did
not. He was sure, too, that the only man who could teach her
properly was not Daniel Reynell, but the man who was vowing to
himself he would think of her no more.</p>

<p>He would not take Daniel Reynell. He meant to have Polperro men
though. Men the King's ships must have. He had a very special order
for four, and what better men than these capable Cornish fishermen?
By fair means or foul he intended to have them. That hint about the
spring tide was well worth considering.</p>

<p>To do him all justice, Thomas Quested firmly believed it was a
step up in the social scale to join the Navy. Since they were not
willing, of course, it must be managed. The men who resisted most
were content enough before the year was out. There was plenty of
excitement, plenty of prize money. Ordinarily I am afraid he would
not have hesitated one moment to disregard even a permit. Now the
fact of Reynell's permit only troubled him because he stood in the
position of a rival, and it was his instinct to give him fair play.
If Loveday Corthew really loved him best&mdash;he was the last
man&mdash;the very last man. But did she love him best?</p>

<p>She did not know what love meant! And if her wedding day had not
been fixed&#8212;&#8212;Not for a moment did he think any ill of
Loveday Corthew. She was dear and sweet and good, but she had seen
nothing of the world. She had known the master of the <i>Reaper</i>
all her life. He was backed by the approval of her father, an
excellent match. It was a family affair. But she would never love
Daniel Reynell, whereas she was his born mate. He had known it from
the moment he had looked into her winsome face. This man stood in
the way. It was bitter&mdash;bitter.</p>

<p>If he had only known it Loveday's thoughts were straying in much
the same direction though she had not realized it herself. Her
trousseau was ready, even the cake was baked, and she knew she had
been the happiest girl in the world when Daniel Reynell had asked
her. It was a triumph that had echoed along the coast, had reached
Looe, and even, it was whispered, was talked about in Plymouth
itself. No wonder she had been pleased and proud.</p>

<p>Was she fickle for thinking now what might have been?</p>

<p>Loveday considered a fickle woman something mean and despicable.
She ought not to think of Lieutenant Quested who had come longing
too late. In fact, of course, she did not think about him.</p>

<p>But she shivered in spite of herself, and her lover would have
drawn her closer. She held back gently. She was in no mood for
lovemaking.</p>

<p>'Not here&mdash;in the street,' she said. She was so
wise&mdash;so kind, but Reynell was repelled. Did not this girl he
loved and longed for, take things a little too calmly? Would she
ever waken and respond to his passion? Just for a moment it flashed
through his mind that she never had. She had always been the dear
little girl, the dearest little girl in the world ever since he had
known her. Of course things would be different when they were
married.</p>

<p>'I rather mistrust a King's man in a fishing town,' he said,
tearing his thoughts away from his doubts and fears.</p>

<p>'Why?' she asked. 'He will not harm you. He is Parson
Trevenick's friend.'</p>

<p>'Parson's friend or not,' said Reynell a little savagely, 'when
a navy man comes poking round he generally wants recruits, and when
he wants recruits he's not over particular how he gets them.'</p>

<p>'Oh but Lieutenant Quested,' began Loveday. She felt she could
explain easily enough why Lieutenant Quested lingered in Polperro.
She hardly thought he was thinking of recruits. Then she stopped.
The explanation might not please her lover.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was lucky that a fisher boy running up interrupted
them at that moment.</p>

<p>'Cap'en Toms sent I along, Skipper. Hers already.'</p>

<p>Reynell caught the girl's arm and held it so tightly he hurt
her.</p>

<p>'I must go,' he said, 'I promised old Cap'en Toms to go out with
him to-night. There aren't likely to be many more nights when he
can go out. His son has a catarrh and he can't cast the net alone.
You will not let Lieutenant Quested walk back with you, will
you?'</p>

<p>'But, Dan,' she protested, 'how can I help it if you are not
there. And,' she added with spirit, 'if he offers to carry my fish
'tis only courtesy on his part.'</p>

<p>'I'll not go with Toms,' said Reynell jealously.</p>

<p>'Fie on you,' she laughed, 'and we to wed on New Year's Day!
What sort of life shall I have with a man who is jealous of a
shadow! If you can't trust him, can't you trust me?'</p>

<p>She looked at him smiling roguishly. How winsome she was! Of
course he ought to trust her he thought miserably. She was right
too about the kiss. The place was too public for such kisses as he
wanted.</p>

<p>She stood a moment watching his stalwart figure clad in
fisherman's jersey and high sea boots as he strode away reluctantly
to the little quay where the fishing boats lay.</p>

<p>His handsome face was tanned with sun and wind; those blue eyes
that looked so straight into hers were honest and true; his fair
hair curled in tight little rings all over his uncovered head. Of
course, she loved him, this great stalwart man, was he not the man
of her childish dreams?</p>

<p>Because she was so sure that she loved him she felt she might
allow herself a little latitude. To reward herself for her own good
intentions, she smiled at Lieutenant Quested when he joined
her.</p>

<p>Looking back Daniel Reynell saw them both at the fish scales and
cursed the good nature that had pledged him to a night at sea.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Quested not only helped her buy mackerel but carried
it for her all the way to Raphiel Farm a good half hour's walk
away.</p>

<p>By way of keeping his thoughts from straying to another man's
promised bride, Lieutenant Quested talked of Polperro, and gained a
great deal of information that was likely to be useful to him. By
the time he had reached the farm he knew all about the behaviour of
the fisherfolk when the town was flooded. That, he told himself,
was so strictly business, that when the farmer invited him to stay
to supper, he allowed himself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>By the end of the evening the farmer had supplied him with a
great deal more information.</p>

<p>So Lieutenant Quested spent an evening that was not only
pleasant to himself but was likely to be profitable to his
King.</p>

<p>As for Loveday she was well content. She saw her father's pride
in her&mdash;felt it was deserved. Was she not going to wed the
handsomest, most sought-after man along all the Cornish coast, and
here was the King's officer looking at her with&mdash;well she was
a good girl. But even a good girl could not fail to know he was
looking at her with eyes of desire. She was flattered.</p>

<p>She went to bed deliriously happy. Quested had wakened in her
that which Reynell had failed to stir. She had known nothing of a
woman's passion and longing. It was Thomas Quested who was teaching
her, not her affianced lover.</p>

<p>As yet it was only intoxicating, not disquieting.</p>

<p>She fell asleep at last happy, and without a thought of fear for
the future.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'What hath man of all his labour, and
of the vexation of his heart,<br>
wherein he had laboured under the sun?</i>'</p>
<br>

<p>The body of rain Reynell prophesied came in torrents the next
day. The hills that made the Coombe were hidden in mist. A wild
wind tore up the gully, driving before it the spring tide. In the
harbour the men gave all their attention to the fastening of their
boats. In the town the women slipped in the boards at the front
doors to keep out the water. The waves were tumbling in great green
seas over the quay, and the stout stone wall that ran round the
harbour on the west threatened every moment to give way. For the
sea was as high as the Peak itself. There seemed no chance that it
would go down.</p>

<p>Reynell, with young Quiller and Robert Trevenick, the parson's
son, stood at the fish scales watching the rising water. From the
half-door of the Pilchard, Joan, with a shawl thrown over her head,
watched them. Seen by the dim light on the fish scales, she only
recognized Reynell by his height. But the others were nothing to
her.</p>

<p>She had just made a discovery, a discovery of vital import.
There was a band of navy men, how many she was not quite sure,
crouching on the slope of the hill just behind the tavern. They
could rush it when they pleased, break through the doors, and be in
the street in a moment. That, she was fairly sure, was what they
intended to do. Even half a dozen men, catching the fishermen
unawares, might take heavy toll in the storm.</p>

<p>She knew well enough what she ought to do. She had only to raise
the alarm from the half-door where she stood and all would be well.
However many there were, and of course there were others besides
those she had seen, once the fishermen were warned they could look
after themselves.</p>

<p>But Polperro had not been kind to Joan. Let them be pressed.
Only that stalwart figure, blurred by the driving rain, pulled at
her heart strings. At any time she would have given much for an
opportunity of speech with Daniel Reynell, and here was such an
opportunity made right to her hand. She would tell him, and tell
him only. For once in her starved life she would be looked upon by
the man she loved with all the strength of her passionate repressed
nature as of some account, as the woman who kept her eyes open and
helped the town.</p>

<p>The thought of his commendation sent the hot blood racing
through her veins. She pulled the shawl tighter over her head,
opened the half-door and stepped out on to the cobble stones of the
roadway, where already the water was washing a foot deep. It was a
very turmoil outside, dark as pitch but for the evil-smelling
pilchard oil lamps that hung, one on the fish scales, and one in
the doorway of the tavern. Not a star was to be seen. The clouds,
driven before the south-west wind, hid all the heavens, only the
white water on top of the waves that broke over the quay showed a
line like cruel teeth. The roar of it rushing down the Peak,
mingling with the shriek of the wind tearing up the gully, drowned
all other sounds.</p>

<p>It took strength, Joan found, to keep her feet even on the
cobble stones in front of the inn where she was, in a measure,
sheltered. What faint light there was fell on Reynell's face under
his sou'wester. She made her way to him, and in her tense
excitement laid her hand on his arm. Never before had she done such
a thing. Now it seemed to her the occasion warranted what she had
only dared think of before with bated breath. He would understand.
He would praise&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why, Joan,' he said smiling, 'the very lass I'm looking for.
Canst send a message for me?'</p>

<p>His eyes looked straight down into hers. She felt for a moment a
sense of companionship and friendliness that warmed her heart and
steadied her nerves.</p>

<p>'Iss, that a' can,' she said eagerly, and the delight of
pleasing him made her hesitate just one moment before giving him
the warning. Those men on the hillside would not act just yet. She
would prolong the delight of this proximity. Perhaps she could
persuade him to come into the tavern. How could she say the words
that would send him racing from her to organise Polperro. Just a
moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>With a careless hand he smashed her poor little dream of
bliss.</p>

<p>'Get me someone, my lass, will run up to Raphiel Farm and tell
them I cannot be there to-night. It's going to be a dirty night and
I must stay near the harbour.'</p>

<p>The words choked in Joan's throat. She literally could not
answer.</p>

<p>There was no need.</p>

<p>A small boy ran past. Reynell caught him and promised him a
penny if he delivered his message. Then he put his hand to his face
and looked out to sea again.</p>

<p>The very devils of hell raged in the girl's heart. He had
forgotten her very existence. He had looked kindly at her just
because he wanted to send a message to his sweetheart, just
that&mdash;&mdash;And Loveday Corthew would be as happy with
Lieutenant Quested, or Robert Trevenick, or with young Quiller
there for that matter. She was a good girl. She would make any
decent man a good wife.</p>

<p>Joan lingered a moment. Perhaps he would look round.</p>

<p>But his head was full of the business of the town. If he thought
of any woman at all it was of Loveday Corthew waiting for him at
Raphiel Farm. Joan was less than nothing to him. He had sent his
message. He turned to Bob Trevenick as if she had never been.</p>

<p>'What about the lamps at the head of the quay?'</p>

<p>So he sealed his own fate, and hers too, though he did not know
it. Not from her should he hear of the cutter's crew on the
hillside.</p>

<p>'They be knocked about proper,' said young Quiller. 'It's no
good thinking of they. There be no boats out to-night. If so be's
they's out, out they'll have to stay. How long to high water?'</p>

<p>'Not for a couple of hours yet,' said Reynell anxiously.</p>

<p>'Then by all that's holy the town had better clear to the hills
in double quick time,' said Trevenick as a swirl of water came
racing round their knees. 'It'll take some of the women all they
know to fetch it.'</p>

<p>Not one of them gave a second thought to the girl standing
swaying beside them. She could not see their faces, only the light
of the little lamp on the fish scales shone on the gleaming
sou'-westers of the two tall men and Bob Trevenick, sturdy but
hardly up to their shoulders. She looked down the street. It was
black as a wolf's maw; the driving rain blotted out everything, and
the light from the pilchard oil lamps in the windows, which was all
the lighting Polperro got in the ninth decade of the eighteenth
century, came out as a dim gleam here and there fitful and
uncertain. Another gust and out went the lamp over the door of the
tavern.</p>

<p>The only one that counted now was the one at the fish
scales.</p>

<p>Another swirl of water came; another; and another.</p>

<p>The three young men shouted at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>'The water! The water is in! The water is in!'</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. This was no stray wave. The water
was in. The town was flooding fast.</p>

<p>'Rouse out! Lee! Garrett! Ross! Look alive there! Rouse out,
men. You can't hold the houses against the sea! Best take the women
and children to the upper town. Rouse out! Rouse out!'</p>

<p>Not one of them remembered Joan. They rushed to the nearest
house and pounded on the door.</p>

<p>'Take the houses up Chaple Rock way, Quiller. Some of them are
in danger,' ordered Reynell. 'Bob, you take the houses on the right
of the street up to the Green. I'll take those on the left.'</p>

<p>Above the roaring of the storm Joan heard him shout. Never one
word for her, never one thought though she had stood beside him a
moment ago. She was a capable girl, quick to think and quick to
act. Had she not been hampered by her love she could have called
attention to herself as equal in this emergency as any man to help.
But that love somehow bound her hands. She could think of nothing
but that she was naught to him.</p>

<p>The storm was growing. It was difficult to hear each other's
voices. But it was self-evident they must warn the town, for this
was no ordinary gale, that might merely flood out the kitchens of
the housewives till the tide turned. This would drown children and
women and men too, for that matter, unless they cleared out
quickly.</p>

<p>The people were loath to leave their possessions. They might be
small, but they were all they had. Reynell, standing still,
sheltering one moment at the tavern door where Joan had relighted
the lamp, knew there was a good night's work before him. Then Joan
made her last bid for happiness for many a long day.</p>

<p>'Dan'el Reynell! Dan'el Reynell. Come an' help I.'</p>

<p>'What, Joan! A strapping wench like you!'</p>

<p>With a laugh he stepped back into the swirling water, knowing
nothing of the raging anger in the girl's heart.</p>

<p>She would never tell him now of the men hidden up on the hill
behind the tavern. If they liked to rush down through the bar they
might for all she cared. The other women were being helped; no one
was giving thought to her difficulties. Yet all Polperro might have
known them. Her mother and stepfather were half drunk as usual.
Betsey, the girl who helped her, was not all there. And yet she
could have grappled with them if only Daniel Reynell had seen fit
to give her one kindly word of encouragement. She was no weakling.
But it was hard he should not even care what became of her when he
was ready to help every other woman in the town.</p>

<p>The door of the next house was open. By a little lamp hung on a
bracket on the wall high above the flood Reynell saw a man with a
woman in his arms step out into the street which was running like a
river now. Two little crying children were looking helplessly at
the water running in and out among the chairs and tables,
threatening every moment to upset the form on which they stood. He
remembered then that Hugh Ross's wife had been very sick indeed. He
stepped inside and picked up the babies in his arms.</p>

<p>'Any more, Hugh Ross?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, thank God,' said the man, and they toiled up the street
among a confused crowd of shrieking women, cursing men and wailing
children, across the Green, feeling their way in the dark and
driving rain till the hill rose. A door opened, a light streamed
out, and, what was much more to the purpose, showed a room
comfortable and dry. A woman's voice begged them to come
inside.</p>

<p>Reynell, with a cheering word, put down the children and raced
back. There were probably others needing help.</p>

<p>The street, knee deep in water, was alive with people. The rain
driven before the howling wind was like a dark sheet; the forms
huddled against the wet and cold showed as darker bulks in the
gloom, now crushed together, an indistinguishable mass, now in
single figures, blurred and indistinct. None could say who was
who.</p>

<p>From the disorderly crowd struggling up the hillside came
shrieks and curses and the shrill wail of terrified children, for
such a night had not been known in Polperro in the memory of any
living.</p>

<p>As the storm waxed the turmoil grew worse. The wind took charge
the moment a door was opened, and blew out the lamps fixed against
the walls. Only occasionally from a sheltered corner a man's face,
set and strenuous, showed up as he crossed; a woman bent before the
storm, her shawl held close; a chair floated along; a broken table;
a bundle of clothing. But it would hardly have been possible for
anyone who was watching&mdash;and no one was watching&mdash;to say
who were the figures that drifted past, indefinite, shadowy,
mysterious as figures in a dream.</p>

<p>When first the men of Polperro were aware that strangers were
helping them they could hardly have said. Glad enough were they of
that help, they were not stopping to ask questions. A strong arm
picked up a girl who had slipped and fallen; another rescued a good
dame's precious feather bed; and yet again a pair of stout arms
helped a young woman carry her possessions up the hill, and when a
light showed her comeliness, snatched a kiss as payment. No one
said aught, least of all the lady herself.</p>

<p>But the disaster had come upon them so suddenly there was no
method in the work. The driving rain, the howling wind, the rising
water and the roaring of the sea took charge, deadening and
belittling all other sounds. Rescuers and rescued could not see
each other's faces save by chance; shouts and shrieks and wails
were feeble things before the roaring of the storm; every man could
only do what seemed best in his own eyes. The obvious thing was to
get the helpless and such furniture as they could lay hands on to
the higher houses in the upper town.</p>

<p>Confusion there was bound to be.</p>

<p>But it seemed to Reynell, as the night wore on, that the
confusion, instead of settling itself, grew worse. He raced along
from house to house and satisfied himself that they were empty;
there was no danger of anyone being drowned even if the houses
fell.</p>

<p>There came a sudden lull, as if sea and wind had hushed for a
moment. The worst had passed?</p>

<p>Then to his surprise a cry arose out of the darkness that the
chains had broken, and the boats were adrift.</p>

<p>Down came the wind again with a wild shriek. But even above it
was the cry.</p>

<p>'The boats! The boats! The boats are adrift!'</p>

<p>It was an ominous cry, for by the boats the little fishing town
lived. If the boats were lost then starvation stared Polperro in
the face.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell was close to the upper town when it reached his
ears. He raced for the harbour. The cry of alarm rang louder and
louder. He could hear it above the howl of the storm.</p>

<p>'The boats! The boats! The boats! Look to the boats!'</p>

<p>'The boats are all right!' he shouted. 'The boats are all right!
I saw to them myself. Ross, Trevenick, Quiller, the chains are
fast, I tell you. The chains are fast. Garrett,' he shouted to the
man next him, 'what is the meaning of this? Tell them the boats are
all right. Yell, man, yell. You don't know what may happen if they
lose their heads.'</p>

<p>They passed the long pencil of light that came through an open
door. Just for a moment it fell on the face of the man beside him.
It was not Amos Garrett, as he had supposed, but a total stranger.
They plunged into darkness again. The rain beat cutting on his
face. He put out his hand and laid it on the stranger's
shoulder.</p>

<p>'And who the devil&mdash;&mdash;' he began, for he knew every
creature in the town, where he had lived all his days, and he was
surprised to see a stranger on a night like this.</p>

<p>'All right, Skipper,' said the man with a laugh. 'Any port in a
storm. I'll help if I am a stranger. They boats are adrift they
say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The boats are not adrift,' said Reynell, still racing towards
the harbour and glancing at his other side.</p>

<p>There was another man there. Of course it was&mdash;&mdash;But
no, a light streamed from another door, a comparatively bright
light this time, for someone had made a flare with a rope soaked in
pitch. This man too was a stranger.</p>

<p>Something was wrong. Conviction came. Something was very wrong.
It was from the group round him the alarm about the boats was
coming. But what in heaven's name was their object? The women were
safe as far as he knew, and to send the men racing back to the
quay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In a flash he knew&mdash;he knew.</p>

<p>'The press gang!' he yelled. 'The press gang! Look to it there!
The press gang.'</p>

<p>He did not fear for himself. He had a permit, but his sympathies
were with these fishermen who would be rudely torn from their
homes. He raced on with the men beside him till the street opened
out at the head of the harbour. There he paused, for the water rose
to his waist. Unless he swam he could go no farther. Besides, there
was no object in going farther. He turned. And found a man still on
either side.</p>

<p>'Clear out!' he swore angrily, 'and be damned to you!'</p>

<p>He ran back to the fish scales still shouting, 'The press gang!
The press gang!'</p>

<p>The night was ideal for their purpose.</p>

<p>He would warn all he could. He heard above the tumult the man
beside him laugh derisively and fear just touched him with his cold
breath. These two strangers, sailor men by the cut of their jib,
were after his stalwart proportions. Once taken could he convince
any one he was skipper and owner of the <i>Reaper,</i> a man with a
permit? It would take time. Such men had been taken
before&mdash;had been killed before the mistake had been rectified.
And he was to be married on New Year's Day! Lieutenant Quested had
not lingered in the little town for nothing.</p>

<p>He grew hot with anger and wild with anxiety.</p>

<p>Not a fortnight to his wedding day! But surely it was simple
enough to get away!</p>

<p>He made for the narrow lane that ran by the Pilchard. Once there
he reckoned on the steep slippery steps that led uphill to baffle
his pursuers. He was familiar with them. They were not. He turned
and hit out furiously. The thought of Loveday's bright eyes lent
strength to his arms. One man dodged him. The other slipped and
stumbled on the cobble stones. He took advantage of the momentary
hold up to put on a spurt that brought him right into the narrow
passage between the Pilchard and the house opposite.</p>

<p>Now was his chance. He was fresh still, for all his hard work.
Once on the hillside of which he knew every inch, every stick and
stone and turn&mdash;&mdash;He could have shouted with laughter at
the thought of the dance he would lead the poor beggars, saving
some poor fishermen from their unwelcome attentions too. They had
put their money on the wrong horse when they thought to take the
owner of the <i>Reaper</i> under cover of the night. There would be
some sick and sorry sailor men&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>If Joan had arranged things on purpose to vent her spite on him
she could not have arranged it better. The door of the little
tavern opened, and there tumbled out into the narrow street the
landlord and landlady of the inn, both somewhat dazed with sleep
and drink, followed by Betsey, the stupid serving maid. Between
them they bore a great feather bed, with, heaped among its folds,
pillows and blankets and various other odds and ends. Joan stood
just above.</p>

<p>By the lamp which flickered and died down and rose again in the
wind he saw her face, and saw too, to his dismay that the whole way
was blocked. Turn he could not. It would be running right into the
arms of his pursuers. His only hope now was that he might slip
through into the inn. He looked back.</p>

<p>Against the white water tumbling over the sea wall loomed the
bulk of men, friend or foe he was not sure which. He dared not
chance anything. If only the first comers were enemies they were
more than he could tackle.</p>

<p>'Gangway there,' he cried. 'Gangway! Joan, clear them for God's
sake or there'll be no wedding for me at the New Year!'</p>

<p>A simple soul was Daniel Reynell!</p>

<p>He looked forward to his wedding. To him it seemed the very
strongest reason why he should preserve his freedom. He felt the
girl would recognise it as such. It was an appeal not to be
gainsaid.</p>

<p>Joan stood like a block of wood looking down on the three people
struggling so futilely with the great smothering bed. Her
stepfather was cursing as usual; her mother was whining; while
Betsey was giggling and groaning alternately.</p>

<p>But Reynell's voice dominated all the rest.</p>

<p>'Gangway there! Gangway there!' The sodden landlord stood
staring stupidly. As Reynell ran he stepped out of his way but he
still clung to the bed, brought it right across the fugitive's
path, and before he could stop himself he was on top of it. The
three people clinging to it collapsed on top of him, and on top of
them came the men who were racing up the street.</p>

<p>For a brief second the human wails were smothered by the
water.</p>

<p>Joan, looking on, knew she would have helped if he had not
mentioned his wedding day. She did not want him wed. That stayed
her hand.</p>

<p>The men on top were up, cursing and laughing and spitting out
water; Betsey, shrieking, made a grab at her mistress, and Reynell,
scrambling up half drowned out of the knee-deep water, hit out
wildly and, catching the landlord one on the mouth, turned him into
an active enemy.</p>

<p>For a moment it was pandemonium. The light from the inn fell
directly on the struggling crowd. The girl, looking on, saw legs
and arms and heads bobbing up in the water in the midst of the
smothering feather bed that kept coming up in unexpected places.
Every head that rose up swore aloud. She could hear the angry
voices even above the howling of the gale. For a moment she thought
Reynell was going to fight his way free. She was prepared to help
him; to shut the tavern door and hold it in the face of all comers.
Unluckily, as she stepped forward Reynell saw her and guessed her
intention.</p>

<p>'Good girl, Joan! For my girl's sake&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>One of the men caught his legs and pulled him under water again.
When he got his head up four men had him in their grasp.</p>

<p>'Got un at last,' said one with an oath. 'My word, Bill! But
he's a dandy to fight! Look out, Bill!'</p>

<p>But Bill wasn't quick enough. Their victim managed to wrench an
arm free, clenched his fist and hit Bill a clout between the eyes
that sent him reeling under water.</p>

<p>Now was Joan's opportunity.</p>

<p>But instead of flinging herself upon his captors as she might
well have done, as he fully expected her to do&mdash;she and Betsey
might easily have made a diversion in his favour&mdash;she stood
there looking down idly in the flaring lamplight as if it were no
business of hers.</p>

<p>'Oh, curse the girl! Why was she such a fool when so much was at
stake! If these four people at the Pilchard would only fight for
him&mdash;Joan standing there must see how little it would
take&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Joan! Joan! Give a helping hand for Loveday Corthew's sake!
Rouse the lads! If I can't get away&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The thought that he might after all be carried away overwhelmed
him. Such things had been. Such things would be again. With set
teeth he wrestled with these men who were cursing him with all the
fervour and fluency of which the lower deck of the navy of those
days was capable. Their remarks were torrid and to the point. They
were using their fists. He was getting the worst of it.</p>

<p>And the woman to whom he was all the world looked on dully. Why
should she save him for another woman? They had his arms. They had
his legs. He turned his face to the girl standing there.</p>

<p>'Tell them up at Raphiel Farm&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>As he mentioned the farm that held all he cared for, he gave
another last struggle. His captors, with an oath that rang above
the storm, dragged him down under water again. His message ended in
a sobbing gurgle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'I made me great works; I builded me
houses; I planted me vineyards;<br>
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all
kinds of fruit;<br>
I made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth
forth trees;<br>
and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no
profit under the sun.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Daniel Reynell came to himself on the narrow track that led
round the cliff in the direction of Talland. Through the pelting
rain the wind off the sea drove in his face, but dimly by the light
of a ship's lantern he saw three men bending over him. The rough,
sea-worn, sun-tanned faces did not look unkindly, though the mouth
of one man was bleeding and another had a huge bruise over his
eye.</p>

<p>Half dazed as he was, he guessed he had fought hard for his
liberty.</p>

<p>'He's all right, Bill,' said the leader, with an oath of
satisfaction. 'Damned if I didn't think you'd finished un. Come on,
mate. You's a weighty parcel. Dost think 'ee could walk a bit.'</p>

<p>'I can walk my own way,' said Reynell. 'Let me up like good
chaps.'</p>

<p>'Aha, mate, but it's our way you must walk,' and Bill, as if to
impress on him his helplessness, turned the lantern
slowly&mdash;its light all blurred by the rain&mdash;first on one
and then on another of the party.</p>

<p>They were four stalwart men young and strong. The rain dripped
in great drops from the edges of their sou'-westers, and ran down
their oilskins in little rivers.</p>

<p>'I am skipper and owner of the <i>Reaper</i>,' said their
captive struggling into a sitting position, 'with a protection.
When I am found missing there will be a great shindy.'</p>

<p>'I reckon we'll take that risk,' said the leader serenely. 'Come
along quiet now.'</p>

<p>Quiet in the clutches of the merciless press gang! And his
wedding day fixed!</p>

<p>The thought drove him frantic! With clenched fists he rose to
his knees only to realise he was a child in their hands.</p>

<p>He had worked hard all the evening; he had run; he had fought;
now he was done. If he could walk it was all he could do. They were
four to one. It was no good attempting to defy them.</p>

<p>Bill of the black eye looked down at him with a twinkle in the
other as if he understood all about it. Probably he did.</p>

<p>'You come along 'o us mate and to-morrow you can put that there
protection to the Lootenant.'</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet. It was lonely here on the hillside.
There was absolutely no hope of help. The sea was beating on the
cliffs below; the gale shrieked as it rushed inland. No sound of
life was there. But they were breasting the steep hill that led up
to old Talland church. His hopes rose again when he made sure which
way they were taking him. Once he spoke to Parson Trevenick all
would be well. These men were regarding the parson as Quested's
friend&mdash;doubtless he was. But he knew Daniel Reynell, the son
of his lifelong friend; he had christened him; prepared him for
confirmation; was going to marry him next Wednesday week. He would
not see him wronged.</p>

<p>He could have shouted aloud so relieved was he. Already he was
seeing this night as but an incident for memory and laughter.</p>

<p>It was a stiff pull, but with a mind almost at rest his strength
was coming back to him. By the time they reached the church porch
he felt equal to making a bolt of it with some hopes of
success.</p>

<p>As they turned into shelter he looked back into the wild night.
Doubtless one of them would go for the key and the parson would
come out himself. He knew Parson Trevenick was not the man to let
anyone shelter in his church. Now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;Oh it
would be worth it all when he sat in the parson's study over a pipe
and a glass of grog. Or no, he would go straight to Polperro. What
did he care about the wild night so long as he was free?</p>

<p>Then, like a puff of cold wind, came the first breath of doubt.
Bill held up the lantern so that its light&mdash;the water on the
horn made it nebulous&mdash;fell on the stone wall to the right.
There, on a little hook, hung the church key.</p>

<p>The leader took it and opened the door. Reynell, almost
mechanically hung back and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'None of yer little games now,' said the man beside him, giving
him a shove forward which sent him stumbling into the church.</p>

<p>He put a curb upon his temper.</p>

<p>'I must speak to the parson.'</p>

<p>'Oh you must, must you? Wantin' the banns put up, I presume.
Well, the <i>Bounty's</i> bound for the South Seas, an' then for
Jaimacy, an' then&mdash;an' then&mdash;we'll call it three
year.'</p>

<p>And only this afternoon he had looked into Loveday's dancing
hazel eyes.</p>

<p>'God! Man! It's not much to ask. I want to see the parson.'</p>

<p>He had come up the hill happily believing he should. If they
prevented him now&mdash;&mdash;He felt as if a band were drawn
tightly round his chest cramping his breathing.</p>

<p>The leader turned round.</p>

<p>'Well, Parson's away to Looe on some jinks. How d'ye think we
got the key else? We squared the wench, a right smart wench she is.
I guess you'll have to wait for the Lootenant.'</p>

<p>And he laughed. It was nothing to him.</p>

<p>These sailor men, friendly enough, had not the slightest
intention of allowing him to escape. Laughing, they hustled him to
the end of the church, set their little lantern on the big square
knight's tomb, and&mdash;despite his struggles, and he struggled
all he knew, they succeeded in binding his legs and arms with good
stout rope which was coiled up there ready for that very purpose.
Then he was helpless and he knew it.</p>

<p>'Us can't afford to take no risks,' said Bill half
apologetically. 'There's others acomin' along. Bless you, mate, in
a week you won't mind. It ain't three months since I was pressed
meself.'</p>

<p>'But I have a permit, and I'm to be married Wednesday week!'</p>

<p>'Married!' It was a great joke. They were doubled up with
merriment.</p>

<p>'Then I guess,' put in the leader, 'we're adoin' you a service,
mate. Lord! You'll be sayin' hallelujahs in six months' time. I
wisht some kind friend had a pressed me a fortnight afore I was
tied up.'</p>

<p>The others guffawed. The jokes they made were unprintable.</p>

<p>At last Bill said soothingly, 'You put it to the Lootenant,
mate.'</p>

<p>Reynell suppressed a groan.</p>

<p>It was a jest to them, a trifling thing.</p>

<p>The bitter part was he was but two miles from Polperro. The
whole town would turn out to his help did they know his
predicament. But if they missed him in the town they would think he
was at Raphiel Farm. At Raphiel Farm they would not come down to
the harbour so long as the bad weather lasted. No one knew.</p>

<p>Then, with a glow of thankfulness, he thought of Joan of the
Pilchard. It was no good counting on Bet or the landlord or his
wife. They would only know a man had been taken. But Joan had
recognised him. She not only knew he had been taken but the way he
had gone&mdash;of that he felt sure. She would give the alarm. An
important man like him&mdash;the whole town would be simmering. He
only wondered he had not been found before. He was sure the
Polperro men were scouring the country looking for him. The moment
they saw the light in the church they would come to find out the
reason. Any moment they might be here now.</p>

<p>He strained his ears to listen for their coming.</p>

<p>They would come&mdash;they must come&mdash;not a fortnight to
his wedding&mdash;the Fates would surely never be so cruel. He must
be rescued.</p>

<p>Presently there came trampling of feet. His heart beat high.</p>

<p>His captors took it too coolly. Other men came in, bringing in
two prisoners, three in fact, but one was a dead man. They flung
the body down in a heap.</p>

<p>The chief of the men who had captured him turned on them
angrily.</p>

<p>'What did you bring him for? Much use he is to the King! The
orders was not to hurt any one, damn you.'</p>

<p>'That's all very well,' grumbled one of the culprits, 'but it
were just a scrappin' match an' Job here has stout fistes of his
own.'</p>

<p>One of the prisoners seized the lantern and flashed it on the
dead man's face. Reynell saw that it was young Amos Garrett, who
had married pretty Lavinia Curtis only this autumn and had been
repenting the deed ever since.</p>

<p>'Good Lord! Poor Garrett!' he said. 'Well that settles his
matrimonial difficulties anyhow.'</p>

<p>'Why, Dan!'</p>

<p>'Why, Bob Trevenick! You don't mean to say they've taken
you!'</p>

<p>'Went to a deal of trouble about it too,' laughed Trevenick, a
little ruefully. 'And a nice mess I've made of my friend's face
here. All for nothing, for the King might have had me for the
asking. Who's the other unfortunate?'</p>

<p>The other man was a fisherman from Polruan, who, unluckily for
himself, was spending the night in Polperro. He had fought
desperately for his liberty, and was now nursing a bruised shoulder
tenderly.</p>

<p>'The skipper here has a protection,' went on Trevenick, 'I'd
have come if the King had asked me nicely without all this
scrapping. My father'll be glad to get rid of me for a bit. The old
gentleman finds my presence upsetting in a quiet parsonage, and as
for this poor chap&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The Polruan man turned to his friend in affliction.</p>

<p>'An' Kitty wi the twinses,' he groaned, 'how'll her do wi'out I?
'A lost the boat last week&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, did you,' said cheerful Bob Trevenick, whom even the sight
of death could not damp for long. 'Well, his Majesty's not
unfeeling. If you'll sign on quiet I've no doubt he'll send half
your pay home to Kitty, and when you come back the twins'll be over
their teething. It'll be a power of trouble saved.'</p>

<p>'Will her? Will her?' The Polruan man cheered up at once.</p>

<p>Trevenick clapped the leader of the press gang on the back.</p>

<p>'By my soul, mate,' he begun.</p>

<p>'I'm a bos'un,' said that worthy gruffly. 'You'll call me "Mr.
Thompson," and you'll keep your paws to yourself.'</p>

<p>Evidently he was not too pleased with his night's work.</p>

<p>'Well; Mr. Thompson,' went on Trevenick unabashed, 'I don't
wonder you feel it. You've gone to a great deal of trouble for
nothing, and you've done for poor Amos Garrett. Why the poor
fellow'd have gone cheerful if you'd only explained the matter to
him. The wench he married had a tongue and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For heaven's sake quit fooling, Bob,' said Reynell anxiously.
He could hear no sound of the rescue party. They could not take
him. Yet such things had happened. 'What are they planning to do
with us?'</p>

<p>'Do with us? Don't you know? Here's the <i>Bounty</i> put in at
Spithead bound for the South Seas. Four of her men had the bad
taste to desert, so Captain Bligh, recalling the gallant men of
Cornwall, suggests that Captain Quested should pick him out four
men of Polperro and&mdash;why, bless you, it's as easy as falling
down a hatchway. Clap us on board the <i>Alert,</i> and if this
wind holds ten hours we ought to have the Nab behind us&mdash;and
once on board the <i>Bounty</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have a protection,' said Reynell again. He had said it so
often this evening. Trevenick shrugged his shoulders. 'Reckon a
captain short of men and in blue water
practically&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>One of the sailors interrupted. 'Mr. Thompson,' he said,
'there's some un at the door.'</p>

<p>'If it's one man let un in,' said the bos'un. 'We're short. And
take that', pointing to poor Garrett, 'out, and if Job don't want
to get into trouble over it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>They opened the door, and there came in, not a man, but a woman
muffled to the eyes in a dripping red shawl. She stood looking
round her in a dazed sort of way.</p>

<p>For one wild moment Reynell thought it might be Loveday Corthew.
Only for a moment though. She was much too tall for Loveday.</p>

<p>Dropping her shawl she came straight towards him. By the feeble
light of the lantern he saw it was Joan of the Pilchard. Thank
God!</p>

<p>'Why Joan, my pretty maid!' said Trevenick, who was still
excited.</p>

<p>'Joan! Joan!' cried Reynell, too anxious to pay compliments,
besides he didn't think Joan exactly pretty, 'did you raise the
town?'</p>

<p>But, of course, his mind went on arguing, she wouldn't own to it
if she had. That would be sheer foolishness. Still she might give
some sign, some look&mdash;something to let him understand instead
of standing there like a stuck pig&mdash;surely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'A' followed 'ee,' said Joan. 'A' was afeared a' might miss
'ee.'</p>

<p>His heart sank. But of course, what else could she say? She had
followed him. That was something. It was a line thrown to the wreck
on which men were drowning. Now to make use of that line.</p>

<p>'An' here she stops,' said the bo'sun, 'till we've gone. We're
not going to have the Polperro men down on us. Please God they've
plenty on hand to-night, an' they won't be troubling over much for
a day or two about a missing man. But Joan won't sell us, will you,
my wench?'</p>

<p>Joan turned round gravely and looked at him in silence.</p>

<p>Reynell, commending her, felt it was policy on her part to keep
on friendly terms with their captors. They were not bad-hearted.
Evidently they thought these two were lovers.</p>

<p>'Here, Bill, Tom, let 'un alone,' said the bo'sun. ''Tis a three
year voyage, an' the wench has followed un. Let be, on'y see as he
don't give us leg bail.'</p>

<p>He drew off the men towards the door. Light-hearted Bob
Trevenick burst out laughing.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know if Mistress Loveday Corthew be jealous,' he
began, 'but upon my word&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Reynell could not chaff. Things were too serious.</p>

<p>'Joan,' he asked, 'are you sure the Polperro men don't know
what's happened?'</p>

<p>'It was powerful dark,' hesitated Joan. She had begun to be
painfully conscious of her slipshod English. She wished this man
could hear her Spanish. But he had no tongue but his own, 'a', had
all a' cud do to follow 'ee.'</p>

<p>'Follow me!' And he swore an oath he would have gulped down in
Loveday's presence. 'It would have been much more to the purpose if
you'd got someone else to follow me.'</p>

<p>Poor Joan! Dumbly she had faced the storm because she liked to
be near him&mdash;because she had some vague idea that the sight of
a friendly face might soften him towards her. But his voice sounded
as she had felt when she let the men surround
him&mdash;bitter&mdash;yes, bitter. Then he had given no thought at
all to her. Now he was thinking of her&mdash;reviling
her&mdash;feeling she had failed in doing all she might. She
<i>had</i> failed too. She was no fool. It would have been much
better for him if she had sent the Polperro men.</p>

<p>Of course then she would have stepped aside&mdash;for ever.</p>

<p>A careless word of thanks tossed to her as he prepared for his
wedding would have been all her reward.</p>

<p>She would rather it was this way. Of course she wanted to be
first with him. To be the one to whom he should turn as his only
help. Oh, delicious thought&mdash;this grand man&mdash;this one man
out of all the world should turn to her for help&mdash;to her, the
despised drudge of the tavern. But he was angry&mdash;and his anger
hurt.</p>

<p>'A' mocht help,' she said, sullenly twisting her fingers in and
out of the fringe of her dripping shawl.</p>

<p>Reynell laughed, but there was no mirth in his laughter.</p>

<p>'You might,' he said, 'and my friend the bo'sun might let me
go.'</p>

<p>Trevenick, the carefree, laughed too, laughed lightly.</p>

<p>'Come, Dan, old chap, don't be so damnably bitter. I daresay
there's ways and means of turning the bo'sun's heart if we only
knew them. Twenty pounds down now and he'd see your protection
written all over you.'</p>

<p>In a moment Reynell had hitched himself into a sitting position
despite his bonds.</p>

<p>'Twenty pounds! Well, of course&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it would have to be cash down,' said Trevenick,
extinguishing the hope as soon as he'd raised it, 'for lieutenants
ain't too pleased with bo'suns who see protections too
quickly.'</p>

<p>'I haven't five shillings in my pocket,' said Reynell, sinking
back again, 'but when the bank opens to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid,' said Trevenick, 'you'll be in blue water before
the bank opens. But we could get it from my dad. Or, better still,
he'll point out the iniquity of taking you, and you'll be twenty
pounds to the good.'</p>

<p>'And how am I to get at your dad?'</p>

<p>'Why not send a message by Joan? He's in Looe. He'll swear to
you, and Bligh himself wouldn't dare to keep you.'</p>

<p>'Joan, will you? Joan, will you?'</p>

<p>Reynell's voice was eager and full of hope again. The eagerness
went straight to her heart.</p>

<p>'Iss, surely, that a' will,' she said. 'Deed, 'an 'deed a'
will.'</p>

<p>'There now,' said Trevenick. 'Can you ride?'</p>

<p>There was a little twinkle in his eyes, for he had seen Joan
helping to run contraband. He knew that at any rate she was at home
on a quiet horse.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'Well you beg, borrow, or steal a nag and off to the parsonage
at Looe, the church close by the harbour, any one'll tell you. Put
the whole thing to my dad, and tell him he must catch the
<i>Alert</i> before she sails. Think you're up to the job?'</p>

<p>He looked the dripping girl up and down with eyes that seemed to
condemn her as a useless drudge.</p>

<p>Her soul rose up in revolt. She would save this man.</p>

<p>She crept closer to Reynell. The thought that she might count
for something in his life transfigured her face for a moment.</p>

<p>By the dim horn lantern on the Knight's tomb Reynell saw, and
wondered a passing wonder&mdash;that he had not done full justice
to her good looks before.</p>

<p>'A'll do all a' can for 'ee.'</p>

<p>'Penrhyn's got the bay mare,' said Reynell seeing how simply it
might be done. 'You must borrow Kitty. Tell him I sent you for her,
and if he isn't there just take her. The main thing is to get to
Looe. I'll make it all right with Penrhyn afterwards. Ride, like a
good wench, the moment you get the chance.'</p>

<p>'A'd do a deal for 'ee.'</p>

<p>'Good girl.' His eyes looked kind, and his voice softened, for
he was thinking of another woman. 'If, by the worst of luck, you
don't catch the parson, and I'm carried off, you'll tell Mistress
Loveday Corthew at Raphiel Farm&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;tell
her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>It is not very easy when you come to think of it to send a
message of love by the drudge of a fisherman's tavern. Reynell felt
the difficulty. In those days paper and pencil came not readily to
every man's hand. He had neither. Neither had Trevenick.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't worry. Joan'll get the mare.'</p>

<p>'Mind, if Dick Penrhyn isn't there just take her, Joan,'
insisted Reynell. 'The great thing is not to waste time.'</p>

<p>'Don't be afraid. The skipper here'll see you through,' declared
Trevenick. 'He's a good friend of Penrhyn's.'</p>

<p>'You understand?' said Reynell anxiously.</p>

<p>'Iss,' said the girl, dragging her shawl over her face. He was
glad, for he felt all his love and longing must be written on his
face. Yet that it had any interest for her never occurred to
him.</p>

<p>'And if you don't get me free in time&mdash;if I'm taken you'll
tell Mistress Corthew&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A'd a deal rather free 'ee.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if you could do that!' and his face lighted.</p>

<p>'That's the ticket,' said Trevenick cheerfully. 'Once you set
eyes on that mare, Joan, you stick to her till you've told the
sorrowful story to my governor. Get the mare and ride her for all
you're worth. Have you got that clear, Joan?'</p>

<p>Joan nodded.</p>

<p>Trevenick was not particularly anxious to be freed. Things were
likely to be troublous at home. There was a certain bill falling
due&mdash;want of the necessary suggested that absence&mdash;that
top'sle sheets in fact, would settle it better than any other way
he could think of. Reynell's freedom was another matter. That Joan
should be able to manage. He curled himself up and went to sleep.
The Polruan man, comforted by the thought that his Kitty would get
half his wages, and that the teething of the twins would not bother
him, followed his example. Most of their captors were already
snoring.</p>

<p>Joan sank down on the stones at Reynell's feet, drew her shawl
over her face, and, though he did not know it, feasted her eyes on
him. Never before in all her starved, miserable life had she been
so close to the man she loved. She had only to put out her hand and
she could lay it on his feet. She was cold; she was weary; but she
would have been more than content if the night had stretched itself
out to twice its normal length.</p>

<p>Reynell lay on his back, with his head resting on a step; gazed
at the lantern; thought of Loveday; and feared. The light was so
dim he could not see the beams in the roof of the old
church&mdash;everything was nebulous like his future. Yet Joan
should be able to get the parson on board the <i>Alert</i> before
they sailed. It all seemed quite simple. Why fear? Surely Fate
could not deal a man such a cruel blow!</p>

<p>The thought of what he might lose filled his whole mind, to the
exclusion of everything else.</p>

<p>'There is no sorrow, like unto my sorrow.' We have all said it
once we have left our childhood behind, nay even children feel it,
and always it seems to us it is we alone who suffer.</p>

<p>Reynell would have been amazed could he have known that his
trouble was but a small thing beside the agony of the girl
crouching there on the floor. She was nothing to him&mdash;nothing
but a dull, stupid lass who had not done all she might to save him.
He felt impatient at having to trust her. But there was no one
else.</p>

<p>And she knew&mdash;knew with gladness&mdash;there was no one
else.</p>

<p>At last the bo'sun rose up, pushed the girl aside, and began to
unfasten the ropes that bound the prisoner.</p>

<p>'Now then,' he said roughly, 'we're goin' to start. You'd better
come along quiet like, or it'll be so much the worse for you. Here,
you wench, out of the way. I guess you can't bring help till we're
safe on board the <i>Alert</i>. If the Polperro men come there
we'll know what to do with them. Stir yourselves now. Come along,
mates, stir yourselves. Look lively now, Amos Garrett, up with
you,' and he caught Reynell by the shoulder.</p>

<p>'I am not Amos Garrett,' said Reynell. 'My name is Daniel
Reynell, skipper of the <i>Reaper.</i> I have a protection.'</p>

<p>'Reynell, is it? Well, I guess now, we have just buried Daniel
Reynell and his protection in the churchyard here. A mighty handy
thing is a churchyard. But if you don't like your own name you're
perfectly at liberty to take another. Get a move on you, mates.
March!'</p>

I have made my bed in the darkness.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Joan, left behind, stood watching the lantern bobbing down the
steep path in the direction of Looe. The wind, carrying great
spurts of rain, was still coming up in sighing gusts, but a star or
two peeped out from among the flying clouds. Whenever the wind died
down in a momentary lull she could hear the rain falling on the
sodden dead leaves that lay round the porch door. A long trail of
ivy had been torn away. It swayed up and down in the wind,
thrashing against the wall. Already it was
battered&mdash;crushed.</p>

<p>All her life she remembered that night. The scent of wet autumn
leaves pressed into the earth and decaying, the acrid odour of ivy,
torn and broken, always spelled to her hopeless despair.</p>

<p>Nowadays, when a woman has some standing, at least in the
British Empire, it is somewhat difficult for us to realize the
position of a girl of the labouring classes in the end of the
eighteenth century. She counted for absolutely nothing in the
cosmogony. Had she beauty&mdash;beauty that attracted&mdash;she
might possibly have some standing in her own little circle as long
as it lasted; but if she had none she was of no importance at all
save to those who loved her.</p>

<p>No one saw Joan's beauty, and she was aware that no one loved
her. Her mother had insisted on bringing her away from the
comfort&mdash;nay the luxury&mdash;of her Spanish home: for love
she said.</p>

<p>That was six long years ago. If she had loved her then that love
had long since died.</p>

<p>She was alone in the world. The wind that stormed round the
church mournfully wailed it. The cold rain pattering on the brown
leaves drove the fact home. No one wanted her, no one cared for
her. Daniel Reynell was willing to use her simply because he could
get no one else. He only wanted some one to take a message. She
could not deceive herself. The most worthless little scamp of a boy
hanging round the boats on the lookout for odd jobs would have been
more to his mind.</p>

<p>Well, she would show him that she could do better for him than
most, better than pretty Loveday Corthew, who would love any man
who was good to her.</p>

<p>Joan, though she did not even know it herself, was extremely
capable. She had an orderly mind. Given a fair chance&mdash;no,
less than a fair chance, given some little opportunity, she would
certainly make the most of it.</p>

<p>As she stood watching the departing lantern, she might mourn,
but she was arranging things in her own mind, deciding what she
should do. She could not bear to think that Daniel Reynell should
go right out of her life&mdash;three years in the South Seas was
certainly a life-time to the girl not yet nineteen. If she saved
him he would certainly marry Loveday Corthew&mdash;but&mdash;if
she, Joan, could save him&mdash;the glory of it&mdash;Joan the
despised drudge of the Pilchard!</p>

<p>And she would! Her mind refused to go any further. She
would.</p>

<p>It is wise to take short views. If we give our minds wholly to
the thing we have in hand it is generally the best policy. There
are the far-seeing, of course, but often those peering for
possibilities in the future are apt to neglect the means for good
that lie ready to their hand.</p>

<p>Joan crossed the churchyard; made her way through the wild
parsonage garden and, emerged close to Penrhyn's farm. She decided
definitely she would not appeal to the Corthews or to Polperro. She
could manage this thing alone.</p>

<p>For her own glory she chose. She did not realize&mdash;she was
not to realize for many a long day&mdash;that she was altering the
lives of four people. Only one of them gave her a passing thought.
For Reynell she was a means to an end, and a very inadequate means
at that.</p>

<p>At Penrhyn's farm she paused at the broken gate that led into a
muddy yard in the middle of which was a great midden. Penrhyn was a
hopeless farmer, untidy, drunken. His whole interests lay in the
free traders, and the tiny woodland that attached to the farm gave
him a bit of shooting occasionally. He cheerfully broke the law
with regard to smuggling, and, like many of his betters, upheld it
with regard to poaching. The only difference was that he was so
active a free trader that when he came into Looe to seek the help
of the law, because he had evidence his pheasants and rabbits were
in danger, and he wanted to take the culprits red-handed, the
coast-guard indulged in ribald merriment and declared they might
sleep peacefully in their beds that night at least.</p>

<p>His only really valuable possession was the bay mare. It was an
open secret that Kitty was on the forlorn farm because she was
useful when there was a cargo to be run. She was a well known horse
in the countryside was Kitty Penrhyn. She was quiet too. Joan knew
she could manage her. The only question was would Penrhyn lend. She
thought he would, because Reynell stood high in his esteem, but
there were times when he was abominably surly.</p>

<p>If he would not, there would still be time to make her way
either to Raphiel Farm or to Polperro. There she would find those
who would make it their business to reach the <i>Alert</i> before
it was too late.</p>

<p>But she wanted to go herself.</p>

<p>She ran splashing across the yard and beat against the door.</p>

<p>Rap! Rap! Rap! No sound but the wind in the eaves and the rain
beating against the walls. Rap! Rap! Rap! Joan was painfully
conscious of the passing of time. It was ages since she had watched
the lantern go down the steep hillside; Daniel Reynell must be half
way to Looe by now. He would think she had forgotten.</p>

<p>She must get a message through before dawn. Oh God! Where was
Dick Penrhyn? It would be cruel if she had to walk to Raphiel Farm
and then drop out of the picture.</p>

<p>Why didn't Dick Penrhyn answer? There was no cargo to be run
to-night. She could hear the mare moving uneasily in her ramshackle
stable. She knew where the key was kept. It would be the simplest
thing in the world to do as Reynell had told her to do&mdash;just
take the mare. Horse stealing had been rife round Polperro of late,
in spite of the fact that the penalty was death. Still, Looe once
reached, not only would it be all right but she would be covered
with glory.</p>

<p>'Mr. Penrhyn! Mr. Penrhyn!'</p>

<p>There came over her that eerie feeling that does come over us if
we raise our voice alone in the night and no one answers. For the
first time this evening she was terrified. She pulled herself
together. Mrs. Penrhyn might easily have gone to her sister's, and
quite likely her husband was dead drunk, lost to the world. She
leaned against the door. It gave.</p>

<p>She went inside, and found herself in the dark kitchen with the
last embers of the fire glowing red on the hearth. Her dire need
gave her courage. She felt about for some wood, and stirred the
glowing coals into a blaze.</p>

<p>No one here.</p>

<p>She found a candle; lighted it and held it above her head.</p>

<p>No sign of the farmer. His boots were not there. No sign of Mrs.
Penrhyn. Should she go upstairs in search of them?</p>

<p>But the need of haste kept pressing on her.</p>

<p>She found the key of the stable in its accustomed place. It
would be quite simple to return the mare when she had found Parson
Trevenick. Penrhyn would never go to the stable again to-night. She
would have loads of time to do the job she had on hand and be back
before daybreak. In that case the farmer need never know&mdash;or
if he must&mdash;oh, glorious thought, Daniel Reynell would stand
by her side, knowing he owed his freedom to her pluck and
promptitude.</p>

<p>That settled it. Guarding the candle, she went to the stable. To
her dismay there was neither saddle nor bridle. It struck her as
curious.</p>

<p>Looking round she found the bridle of the old plough horse, and
slipped that over the mare's head. The plough horse was not there.
Penrhyn was a careless man; he must have forgotten poor old Dobbin,
and left him in the field.</p>

<p>She looked about carefully. Not a sign of a saddle.</p>

<p>These little hitches worried her, and made her hot over. The
<i>Alert</i> would not sail before dawn. Dawn was late in December,
but she knew well enough the <i>Alert</i> would not lose a moment.
Even when she found the parson he had to be got on board.</p>

<p>A saddle&mdash;&mdash;Well she must manage without a saddle. She
threw a sack across the mare and mounted, gathering her petticoats
about her and sitting astride.</p>

<p>The stars were peeping fitfully now and then between the storm
clouds. She found the gate again, and got into the wet road that
dipped down between the hawthorn hedges.</p>

<p>Kitty picked her way strangely soberly for Kitty. But Joan could
only be thankful for that. Her seat was precarious, and the rain
had worn this side road into ruts and holes. She would be able to
go more quickly once she reached the high road.</p>

<p>She was desperately impatient, but her sound common sense told
her that any accident to herself or the mare would wreck her
project. She tried to calculate what time she had. It seemed like
years and years since she had seen Reynell struggling with the
press-gang outside the Pilchard, but it could not yet be
midnight.</p>

<p>Her eyes were accustomed to the gloom by the time she reached
the turning into the high road. She could see the wet road and the
dripping hedges quite plainly.</p>

<p>She expected an empty road at this time of the night, but to her
surprise there were two men riding towards her. She was suddenly
conscious of her petticoats huddled round her waist for
convenience. She drew rein instinctively, and, as if divining her
discomfort, the rain came down again heavily. Joan sighed a sigh of
relief. She could see the two riders as dark masses on the roadway.
If they had not moved they would have been indistinguishable from
the hedges on either hand. She could not make up her mind whether
to call to them for help or whether to wait where she was.</p>

<p>After all she could manage by herself.</p>

<p>She drew a little into the hedge. For a moment it seemed they
would pass her. The rain stopped again, and just as they drew
abreast the mare moved uneasily. One of the passing horses whinnied
loudly. Both the men came to a full stop.</p>

<p>Kitty replied.</p>

<p>Concealment was useless now. Time pressed. She dug her heels
into the mare's flank.</p>

<p>'Kitty!' An oath! It was Penrhyn's voice, 'The devil! Stolen by
Gom! Out in the wet! It'll be the death o' she! Ater un
Clayton!'</p>

<p>The two men wheeled.</p>

<p>Before Joan, slow of speech, could make up her mind what she was
to say they were one on each side of her. She felt the fiery fumes
of the farmer's breath.</p>

<p>'Mr. Penrhyn! Mr. Penrhyn! 'Tis Joan of the Pilchard! You know
I.' She had wit enough to know she must make her excuses as quickly
as possible. 'The press gang ha' taken the Polperro
men&mdash;Daniel Reynell, and I mun ride to Parson Trevenick at
Looe!'</p>

<p>'It'll be the death o' thiccy mare,' roared the farmer. 'Her'n
had a narrer squeak of it. We's gotten this un red-handed. Grab un,
Clayton.'</p>

<p>Clayton, being evidently a man slow at the uptake, he himself
lugged Joan so roughly from the mare's back she fell on her face in
the muddy roadway. Her long black hair came down and was dabbled in
the mud and water.</p>

<p>She scrambled up, the one thought uppermost that she must not be
stopped.</p>

<p>'Mr. Penrhyn! Mr. Penrhyn!' she begged wildly, 'if 'ee' wunnot
let I go, go 'ee 'ee'self. The press gang got 'em, an' they be off
to the South Seas 'less Parson Trevenick be there to speak for un.
Oh, Mr. Penrhyn! A'm Joan of the Pilchard!'</p>

<p>'A' niver heerd no good o' the Pilchard,' said the other man
with portentous solemnity. Joan began to realize that these two
were far gone in liquor, but not drunk enough, unluckily, to be
helpless; yet seeing they were two strapping big Cornish-men in the
pride of their manhood quite drunk enough to stupidly hinder her.
They paid no attention to her prayer.</p>

<p>Penrhyn shook her again and again, pouring out a torrent of
angry words, which ended on a triumphant note.</p>

<p>She gathered that the mare had been sick; that accounted for her
sluggishness. Mrs. Penrhyn was away, and Penrhyn had ridden the old
plough horse to fetch his neighbour, Clayton, who was skilled in
all things veterinary, to help him. Now they had taken a horse
thief red-handed. Clayton could swear to it. Not for a moment did
they listen to Joan's wild prayers.</p>

<p>'Be 'est goin' to give she in charge, varmer?' asked Clayton,
putting his great hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Dom'd if I ain't. It's a bit of good luck you's along o' I.
Fair caught red-handed!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr. Penrhyn,' prayed Joan, 'for God's sake,' and then she
did what she had never thought to do. 'If so be 'ee won't let I go,
send word to Raphiel Farm. 'Tis for Skipper Daniel Reynell.'</p>

<p>'I'll Raphiel Farm 'ee,' roared the farmer. 'An' maybe thiccy
mare done to death, eh, Clayton?'</p>

<p>'Likely as not from what you'm tellin',' said Clayton
sombrely.</p>

<p>At the thought of his worst fears being confirmed, the farmer
waxed more wrath. Letting go Dobbin he laid both hands on Joan.</p>

<p>'Ee'll just come along o' we, ee' limb o' Satan,' he said.
'Ee'll hang for this.'</p>

<p>Not yet did fear for herself come to Joan. The only thing that
she could think of was that she was failing Daniel Reynell. If they
would not let her ride then she must get to Polperro and let
someone else save him. There was time enough yet if she could get
quit of these men. She must not fail him.</p>

<p>With that thought uppermost she fought&mdash;fought with all her
strength. She kicked, she bit, she cursed, she used her hands; she
was just such a wild termagant as any sensible man would have
expected to come out of the little low pot-house.</p>

<p>There were two angry men before three minutes had passed.</p>

<p>In another three minutes they had her down; had tied her hands,
and were cursing her for a wild cat. They made her walk back to the
farm.</p>

<p>Once there, paying no heed to her passionate pleading, they tied
her up to the great four poster in an alcove in the kitchen and,
lighting a lantern, they both went out to attend to the mare.</p>

<p>That night stretched itself into years.</p>

<p>She was firmly tied. She had no more chance of escaping than
Reynell himself. Less, for he had right on his side when all was
said and done, while, look at it what way she would, she had to
admit, with the sound common sense that was at the back of all Joan
did that she was in the wrong. If the farmer were not inclined to
mercy, she might very easily be very much in the wrong.</p>

<p>Yet her intentions were so good she could not bring herself to
believe that either he or Ted Clayton would really think she had
intended to steal the mare.</p>

<p>They came in and out; mixed what seemed to her messes in
saucepans; warmed them at the fire; burnt them and cursed. Each
time the farmer came in he was an angrier man. For things were
going badly with the mare.</p>

<p>Joan was cramped, sick, wet, heartbroken and hopeless. She was
so young. And she had failed in the only great thing that it had
ever come her way to do. She tried again and again to put the case
to the men as they came in. They paid no heed. Their minds were
concentrated on the fact that she had stolen the sick mare; she had
taken her out of her warm stable; she had actually ridden her. They
would not listen to what she said. They told her, angrily, what
they would do to her if the mare died.</p>

<p>They came in at last, stamping, and shaking the rain from their
clothes. Threatening her with their fists, they said the mare was
dead. She should swing for the night's work. They steamed in the
warmth. They refreshed themselves from the great barrel that stood
in the corner. When it was finished they were only a little more
muddled.</p>

<p>The dawn broke sullen and grey.</p>

<p>Joan knew the <i>Alert</i> must be sailing from Looe. Her heart
sank. But not for herself. She did not mind being cursed. She was
accustomed to discomfort and misery of all sorts, and the blazing
fire made the room warm.</p>

<p>Her real grief was that she had failed. The thought that Daniel
Reynell would go away cursing her crushed the very heart out of
her. There was nothing to live for&mdash;nothing. He would hate
her&mdash;hate her. Her utter misery was greater than she could
bear, even death could bring her no comfort. And she had to live
on, live a life in which she could see not a ray of light breaking
through the darkness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'Oh that my grief were thoroughly
weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together.<br>
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>The press gang went straight to Looe to the coast-guard station,
turned their prisoners into a room with heavily barred windows,
and, making sure there was no possibility of escape, locked the
door and left them. No officer came near them. In truth that
gentleman felt that the less he knew about the capture of the press
gang the simpler for him.</p>

<p>All the livelong night Reynell hoped and Trevenick, being a
kindly soul, roused himself from his slumbers again and again to
speak a word of comfort.</p>

<p>'But if Joan had seen your father,' said Reynell gloomily, 'he'd
have been here by now.'</p>

<p>'Not he,' said Bob cheerfully, against his own convictions. 'The
old boy'll spend the night comfortably in the parsonage. No good
routing out a naval captain till he has to. It'll be simpler to
interview him as he's interviewing us.'</p>

<p>'But if he spoke to the officer of the coast-guard
here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And how the dickens is he to know we're at the coast-guard?
Joan would tell him Talland Church and he'd know better than to go
there.'</p>

<p>Reynell dropped into an uneasy sleep at last, for he was very
weary. Hardly had his eyes closed it seemed to him when Thompson
the bos'un roused them out again. They were embarked in the
pinnace, and just as the sullen winter's dawn was breaking, they
were passed on board the <i>Alert</i>.</p>

<p>Reynell looked round eagerly. Where was Parson Trevenick? The
ship's lanterns struggled with the gloomy daylight. One glance
showed no one there who had not business on board.</p>

<p>'He's below,' said Trevenick, hopeful to the last.</p>

<p>But Reynell knew he was not below. Joan had failed him. He had
known she would. He cursed&mdash;not her&mdash;she was too slight a
thing in his mind to curse&mdash;but his own evil fate.</p>

<p>His comrade, seeing in the dim light his strained face, knew he
was taking it worse than even he had expected. Truly he was in the
depths of despair.</p>

<p>But Trevenick was wrong. Reynell still hoped. There lay the
pain. It is when we have nothing to hope for that turmoil
ceases.</p>

<p>'See the captain,' urged Bob. 'Quested knows all about you, and
he's a very decent chap, though you've never done him justice?'</p>

<p>He might have been a decent chap&mdash;he was in fact&mdash;but
he had no mind to see the Polperro men in the toils. He was making
the most of an attack of fever. His senior officer&mdash;on
leave&mdash;very obligingly undertook to take the <i>Alert</i>
round to Portsmouth. It was he&mdash;roused out from his
sleep&mdash;who received the pressed men.</p>

<p>Nothing was said about the dead man, dead and buried in Talland
churchyard. He looked at the three stalwart young men, in the prime
of their manhood, with satisfied eyes.</p>

<p>'Only three,' he said. 'Bligh wanted another man. However, we
must manage. Now, my lads, you've got to obey orders, serve the
King and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Reynell angrily, 'I protest. I am Daniel Reynell,
skipper and owner of the <i>Reaper.</i> I must
protest&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh you protest, do you?' Captain Maitland pushed back his wig
and rubbed his forehead to assist thought. It didn't help him much
so he turned to the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>'Robert Trevenick, resigned and willing, George Simpson, the
same wants his pay sent to Kitty Simpson, opposite the town pump,
Polruan. All right, George Simpson. We'll make a man of you. Amos
Garrett, discontented, very troublesome and anxious to escape. All
right, Amos Garrett, we will curb that little desire on your part
and see if we cannot induce a serene content. Take Amos Garrett to
the fo'c'sle, lash him in his hammock there and keep him there till
he's in a more reasonable frame of mind&mdash;or, hold on, shove
him in the forepeak and put him one leg in irons. He'll have time
to cool there, and we'll let Captain Bligh settle his little
difficulties for him. I guess it'll interest both him and Amos
Garrett more than it does me. I'll put his name on the list, and
his wife shall have half his pay. The King is ever considerate to
his servants&mdash;willing or unwilling.'</p>

<p>'I am Daniel Reynell,' shouted the unlucky captive, struggling
with might and main, and dragging four sailors across the bulwarks
in a wild struggle to throw himself overboard, 'you have no more
right to take me than you have to take the King himself. Let go, I
say, damn you, let go. I would rather be dead than go now.'</p>

<p>'The young cock's mighty anxious to part with his life,' panted
the bos'un, 'an' ater all we yerd about this wife of his, too. Come
quiet, my lad, come quiet now, for come you must. There ain't no
gainsaying the skipper when he gives an order. Into the forepeak
you're goin' an' ironed you'll be. Speak to Trevenick and get him
to send a message.'</p>

<p>It was wisdom. All he could hope for now was to send a message
to Raphiel Farm. His heart was sick and cold within him. Since he
must stay&mdash;and he knew he must&mdash;it was no good incensing
these men against him. The thought stayed his hand as he was about
to hit a sailor in the face.</p>

<p>'Bob,' he called, 'Bob, send a message for me. If you don't care
yourself at least remember&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The light was growing. Through the pouring rain they could see a
boat approaching. It might, thought Reynell, be Quested.</p>

<p>'Bos'un,' came the angry order, 'remove the prisoner. Take the
others to the fo'c'sle.'</p>

<p>Maitland knew well enough if this man's story was true he had no
right to take him. But pressed men told all sorts of lies. They all
settled down in the end. To do him justice, he did not think he was
doing him any particular harm. And he was just the sort of man
Bligh would be glad of. A merchant skipper and owner! He was
dressed as a fisherman! Let Bligh do the investigating. When Amos
Garrett came back from the West Indies three years hence Amos
Garrett would have quietly settled into his place&mdash;risen to be
a warrant officer probably&mdash;he knew a good seamen when he saw
him&mdash;and would have forgotten any unpleasantness at the
beginning of his career. As for the girl he wanted to
marry&mdash;well, Captain Maitland was married himself to the best
little woman in the world but&mdash;if any one had had the
foresight to send him to sea on a three years' cruise a fortnight
before his wedding day he knew very well he would have had a better
chance of&mdash;&mdash;Oh well, he wasn't doing this man any great
harm even if his story was true. And having seen his recruits
disposed of so that no messages could possibly be sent, he, with
the comfortable feeling that he had nobly done his duty, turned to
meet the newcomer.</p>

<p>'Let me stay on deck,' pleaded Reynell, feeling keenly the
mistake he had made. Had he come quietly he had had a better chance
to get a message off&mdash;to speak to this man who was coming on
board. 'I'll stay quiet on deck.'</p>

<p>'You should have thought on that afore, me lad,' said the bo'sun
laughing. ''Tis three dozen for disobeying of orders, an' no
questions asted. Come along.'</p>

<p>There was nothing else for it. He went. They pushed him into a
small dark forepeak on to a pile of spare rope and canvas, dragged
him along and soon had his leg secured to the bar.</p>

<p>'Remind Trevenick, for God's sake, remind Trevenick,' pleaded
Reynell, and he was not accustomed to plead, 'to send a message for
me.'</p>

<p>'I will, my lad, I will that,' said the bo'sun, relieved to find
his unruly prisoner quiet at last. Then they shoved on the hatch
and he was in darkness.</p>

<p>For a moment he was tempted to shout for assistance, to shout to
whoever was this man coming on board, Quested perhaps, that he
would be taking a mean advantage of him if he left him to be
carried to sea there against his will. But resistance had not
served him well as yet, so he reversed his policy just when
shouting and calling attention to his wrongs would have brought an
investigation. Truly the Fates were against the union of Daniel
Reynell and Loveday Corthew.</p>

<p>He sat down on a corner of rope, putting strong pressure upon
himself and waited. It could not be long. They were putting to sea
at once. Some one would come for him in a moment. When the man he
had seen coming on board heard the story he would surely send for
him and ask a few pertinent questions. All naval officers were not
as callous as Captain Maitland.</p>

<p>The time was not really long&mdash;it only seemed long to him
because he was so desperately anxious, because he was here in the
dark, and so very much depended on his getting away.</p>

<p>It was pitchy dark. He could not see a gleam of light. He could
hear the vague sea noises; the grinding of a boat against the
cutter's side; the rattle of ropes; the tramp of bare feet
overhead, and the inevitable bustle and confusion attendant on a
ship just about to go to sea.</p>

<p>But no one came to him. He waited. Then he fell into a panic.
Suppose this last chance should fail. And he was tied by the
leg&mdash;literally.</p>

<p>'Lieutenant Quested!' he shouted, raising his voice to the
utmost, 'Lieutenant Quested!' It must be Quested. But his voice
died away. It was lost among other sounds. He paused for a moment
listening painfully. Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;&mdash;Trevenick
would get a message through and that officer&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;would send for him. It was his last chance&mdash;his very
last chance. He grew hot and cold and sick with anxiety as he found
himself here helpless and it slipping away from him.</p>

<p>'Shove off, for'ard.'</p>

<p>The order rang out clear. He heard the rattle of the boat-hooks
along the cutter's side, and knew that the other naval man,
Quested, or not Quested, was gone&mdash;gone without seeing him. He
shouted aloud and dashed himself against the side. This thing could
not happen&mdash;it could not&mdash;it could not. But it was
happening. He felt the <i>Alert</i> moving, slipping along through
the water. His last hope died.</p>

<p>All now depended on the captain of the <i>Bounty</i>. And what
consideration could he expect from a man already short handed and
anxious to get to sea?</p>

<p>Oh, Loveday! Loveday! He went over their time together. He had
known her as a little child. He had slipped into being her lover,
when he could hardly have told. Had he ever made her understand how
much she was to him? There were a thousand things he might have
said, a thousand things he had left unsaid. He had always
thought&mdash;I can tell her when we are wed.</p>

<p>His house was ready. The <i>Reaper</i> was all prepared. There
were the bunks in the cabin&mdash;the little fireplace in the
cuddy&mdash;the carpet that her dainty feet might not be cold. His
wife would come to sea with him oftener than not.</p>

<p>He could not bear it. It was more than mortal man could stand.
The unshed tears burned hot beneath his eyelids. And three long
dreary years at the very least must pass before he saw her
again.</p>

<p>Oh, Loveday! Loveday!</p>

<p>By and by a man brought him some dinner. He hung up a little
horn lantern on a nail so that he might have some light by which to
eat it. But he knew nothing, or pretended to know nothing, save
that they expected to be alongside the <i>Bounty</i> a little after
six, and that the prisoners were to be handed over then. He came
back for the light after a time.</p>

<p>In darkness the wretched man spent the rest of the afternoon
calculating his chances of making Captain Bligh understand the
situation and, because there was just still the slenderest chance,
it was agonizing work.</p>

<p>It seemed as if he had been there years when the hatch was
lifted off, a light was flashed in his face, and, while he sat
there blinking, the padlock was taken off the irons and he was told
to follow his guide to the upper deck. It was pouring with rain,
pitch dark, icy cold. The lanterns gleamed on the black sides of a
ship, the <i>Bounty</i> of course. He saw Trevenick and the Polruan
man ahead of him. But when he would have spoken the sailors held
him back. He watched them clamber up the dangling rope ladder. Then
his turn came. Every precaution was taken that he should not throw
himself overboard.</p>

<p>Once on the <i>Bounty's</i> deck he was painfully aware that his
character had preceded him. He was received by the master-at-arms
and three bluejackets. Not an officer was in sight. He was hustled
forward into the fo'c'sle.</p>

<p>'I want to see the captain,' protested Reynell.</p>

<p>'Captain!' said the ship's corporal, grinning, 'Not so much of
your chin music, mate. The captain sees request men on Fridays,
same as all other ships. The forepeak's your slinging billet for a
bit, matey.'</p>

<p>He gave up hope then. Gave it up utterly. Nothing short of a
miracle could save him now. No good fighting them. The end was a
foregone conclusion. He was done. He had toiled; he had fought; and
then he had hoped. Perhaps the vain hoping had been the most
wearing.</p>

<p>He was replaced in irons. It might have been the <i>Alert</i>
over again. They put on the hatch and left him to his own
reflections.</p>

<p>It seemed to him he had been thinking for ages, going over and
over again all his chances, and now there were no chances save the
possibility of the <i>Bounty</i> being wrecked on the Cornish
coast. It did not want a fortnight to his wedding day. Loveday had
said nothing could happen in a fortnight. Loveday would wait, he
knew she would wait, he never doubted that for a moment, but was it
fair to ask a girl to wait for him for three long years. Besides,
when she had waited the years he might never come back, none knew
that better than he. He knew the dangers of the seas round the
English coast, and he was bound to unknown parts where the dangers
were trebled.</p>

<p>A letter&mdash;well he had small chance of posting a letter, and
if it were posted there was no trusting the mails in these unknown
parts.</p>

<p>No; there was nothing to depend on but the message he had sent
through Joan of the Pilchard. It added to his torment that he could
not remember exactly what he had said; that he could only think how
much better he might have said it. If only the time were to come
over again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There came the sound of the working of the cables right over his
head.</p>

<p>He had expected no less; yet it was like executing the
sentence.</p>

<p>Now there really was no hope.</p>

<p>The bustle on deck increased. He heard the sobbing of a woman,
and guessed one of the wives had transgressed orders and come down
in the miserable cold December darkness to bid her husband
farewell. If he might only have had a last word!</p>

<p>Commands came thick and fast. At last he heard the order given
to man the capstan. That meant they were just about to start. He
heard the capstan manned and the song of the men as they put their
weight on the bars. They didn't usually sing chanties in the navy,
but the <i>Bounty</i> was an exception. Bligh felt his men required
all the cheering they could get.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">'Come rise up Jack, let John sit
down,<br>
For you're outward bound, you're outward bound.'</p>
<br>

<p>Possibly the only man on board who really wanted to go was the
captain, that is among the regular seamen. There was no enthusiasm
among the sailors, and their mournful chanty floated drearily over
the water of the harbour, telling the watching wives they must be
widows for three long years.</p>

<p>To the prisoner in the forepeak it sounded a death knell. The
good ship Bounty was fairly on her way. She had made many starts,
but this was not likely to be a false one. He heard the sharp
orders to the helmsman, and then again the chanty of the men as
they manned the yards and loosened the sails. There is always a sad
ring about a sailors' chanty, and these were going into unknown
lands and might never return. Very hopeless it sounded in the ears
of the unwilling member of the crew, a prisoner in the forepeak.
His very life was going from him. It was no good then, it was no
good. He must resign himself to his fate.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt that he was very weary. He had compressed the
emotions of a life-time into the last thirty-six hours. It was no
good trying to keep up any longer. It was all over. There was
nothing left for which to hope. He felt he should never see Loveday
again.</p>

<p>All he wanted now was a little air&mdash;a little air. He was
suffocating down here in this cold and darkness.</p>

<p>A little air!</p>

<p>The ship gave a sudden lurch as the wind caught her sails.
Falling forward, he remembered no more.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the ship's corporal came to release him. He
found his prisoner insensible on the deck.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'The sorrows of hell compassed me
about,<br>

</p>
<br>

<p>Everything was against Joan of the Pilchard that night. The
farmer had just drunk enough to want to get very drunk. Had he been
able to do that all might have been well. But unluckily the barrel
was low. It was soon empty, and, dismayed at the loss of the mare,
short of his usual cheerer, it was an angry man that hitched poor
Dobbin to the cart, put the barrel in it, Joan beside
it&mdash;Clayton, after a feeble protest, helped&mdash;and drove
straight to Looe.</p>

<p>Joan was as miserable as he, though she did not at first grasp
the full meaning of her tragedy. Her cheek was bleeding from a gash
where a stone had cut it, but that was a mere trifle beside the
fact that she had utterly failed Daniel Reynell; that he had gone
out of her life; that she had lost even the little glory that might
have come to her had she helped him. There was nothing now to look
forward to but the weary drudgery at the Pilchard. As for stealing
Kitty, she was so conscious of her innocence that she felt she had
only to explain the circumstances to someone who was not fuddled
with drink to be instantly released.</p>

<p>Dick Penrhyn might take her to Looe if it pleased him. She
wanted to go to Looe. That she sat at the bottom of a cart with her
hands tied was a mere detail. She wanted to see if the <i>Alert</i>
was there. What she proposed to do if she were she hardly knew
herself.</p>

<p>All the way into Looe, in the dim breaking of the unwilling
winter's day, she wondered&mdash;wondered&mdash;had the
<i>Alert</i> sailed? She had.</p>

<p>The wind was driving before it the heavy rain, and everything,
houses, trees, hedges, the grey sea with the white topped waves,
the fishing boats drawn up on the foreshore, Joan saw through the
misty blurr. But the King's cutter was gone.</p>

<p>She huddled back then under the sacking Clayton had thrown over
her, and noticed nothing till the cart drew up at a little
dirty-looking stone house. Out came the old man who was the town
constable. Penrhyn gave her in charge. Then, indeed, she raised a
protest against the ways of men in general and drunken Dick Penrhyn
in particular.</p>

<p>'Dost think a'd touch mare? A'd other things on mind! An' Dick
Penrhyn be'est&mdash;&mdash;' She let herself go pouring out the
vials of her wrath in the language learned in the fishermen's
tavern.</p>

<p>It was not pretty. But perhaps in the end it made no difference.
The grim old constable, who was accustomed to wildly incoherent
women loudly proclaiming a stainless innocence, cut the ropes that
bound her hands and thrust her into a grimy little cell. Next day
they took her to the house of the nearest Justice of the Peace, the
most important man in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He had made a night of it the night before, had drank too much
smuggled brandy, and lost more than he could afford at cards to a
man cleverer than himself. The little party was ushered into the
cavernous kitchen where was an appetizing smell of cooking
bacon.</p>

<p>There the great man interviewed them, his aching head tied up in
a large silk handkerchief. The odours of the breakfast he had no
mind for he found extremely upsetting. Naturally they deepened his
conviction that the growing criminality of the lower classes must
be checked as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>He gave scant attention to the accuser. He suspected he had been
drinking, which was unpardonable in a man in his position, and he
did not feel called upon to listen to Joan. She was an ugly, dirty,
lowering wench. Anyway he saw no beauty in a dark woman. He pinned
his faith on the constable. A decent man, who never gave any
trouble.</p>

<p>The constable had the story pat.</p>

<p>The farmer and his friend had caught the girl riding away with
the horse. Penrhyn was an honest man. He knew him well. He did.
Dick Penrhyn never forgot the constable when he had a successful
run and was even good for an occasional rabbit. It was well to be
in with the representative of the law even if he were an old man.
The girl's excuse was she had borrowed the mare to let the people
of Polperro know that the press gang had taken Daniel Reynell. They
were to raise a rescue party.</p>

<p>The Justice was scandalised. How dare she try and interfere with
the just working of the law, the policy of her betters. The navy
must have men. Kidneys were grilling now. The odour seemed
appetising, specially to those who had no chance of partaking. But
the master of the proceedings felt it nauseating. It increased his
disapprobation of the criminally inclined.</p>

<p>The constable went on calmly.</p>

<p>They all knew the skipper of the <i>Reaper</i>. He had a permit.
The press gang would not have taken him. He had seen the men taken
off to the <i>Alert</i>. Two went willingly; the third was bound.
The coast guard officer who was just coming in would give their
names. He had asked the lieutenant to come because of the fuss the
wench was making.</p>

<p>'Quite right, quite right,' said his worship. 'It is the policy
of the age, a right one, to give the criminal every chance.'</p>

<p>The lieutenant in charge of the coast-guard station was a young
man who was courting the daughter the Justice. He was always
anxious to make things go smoothly for that gentleman.</p>

<p>Here he was precise in his information. Three men had been taken
by the press gang in the execution of their duty. Amos Garrett and
Robert Trevenick were the names of the two Polperro men. They had
not taken Daniel Reynell. He had heard no mention of him. He had
their names from the bo'sun. Presumably they knew their own names.
He had heard no mention of Daniel Reynell. If by chance they had
taken a man with a permit he would be instantly released.</p>

<p>He never said he had not personally interviewed the prisoners.
To do him justice, he did not think it a matter of any consequence.
The bo'sun was a man to be trusted. Besides, he couldn't know their
names by intuition. He himself had interviewed Captain Maitland
before the <i>Alert</i> sailed. The pressed men could have asked to
see him if they had wanted to. Captain Maitland would have had a
great deal to say if they had brought him a man with a permit.</p>

<p>'So what is all this fuss about?' asked the Justice, who felt
himself a much tried man.</p>

<p>'Her sneaked mare and killed her,' said Dick Penrhyn, who also
felt himself aggrieved, and with more reason.</p>

<p>No one gave a thought to Joan's feelings.</p>

<p>'I suspect,' said the lieutenant, who hoped to be asked to
breakfast, 'the girl took the mare and, being caught, fetched in
Daniel Reynell as a good excuse. We all know the skipper of the
<i>Reaper,</i> an honest man. But a pretty hopeless excuse, doesn't
your worship think so?'</p>

<p>His worship's sense of scandal deepened the more he enquired
into the case. Squire Polsett had lost two horses only last week.
Evidently a gang of thieves operating in the neighbourhood. The
girl was probably a member. Not only had she stolen the mare but
she must needs bring a slur upon a decent man's name. Declaring she
wanted to obstruct the press gang too! There was only one thing for
such hardened villainy.</p>

<p>The Justice sent for his clerk, and in all due form committed
Juana d'Ath&mdash;that, she said, was her name, and they all
smiled&mdash;to trial at the Plymouth Assizes; treated the
constable to beer; asked the naval man to the breakfast he could
not eat himself; and retired to his own room with the warm feeling
at his heart that he had nobly done his duty at no little cost to
himself.</p>

<p>Afterwards Joan thought of those weeks in jail as a ghastly
dream.</p>

<p>Life at the Pilchard had been hard, but at least there was much
work she must do. Work is the best of anodynes. Here there was
nothing&mdash;nothing to break the monotony. The place was
overcrowded, fetid, horrible; the women, who were her companions,
rankly gave their opinion of what her sentence would be.</p>

<p>In the dark, cold, sleepless nights, in the overcrowded room,
she lay staring up at the ceiling, feeling already the hard rope
round her neck and the cruel choking that should end her life. She
spent days and nights of torture. She gave no heed to her personal
appearance. She was unwashed, unkempt, a mockery and an object of
derision to the hardened women round her.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;curious are the ways of God&mdash;one day something
happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treherne, the jailer's wife, who had charge of these women,
was helping one of them who was very sick. Taking her out of the
ward she stumbled. The woman caught at her dress and loosened a
little turquoise brooch. It fell upon Joan's ragged skirt, making
no noise. It was not missed by its owner.</p>

<p>Joan picked it up. Those who saw her looked to see her hide
it.</p>

<p>'Ma'am,' said Joan quickly, 'ee's lost a jewel pin.'</p>

<p>A jewel indeed! A poor little thing! But the woman valued it.
Her man, who had been a sailor, had brought it to her from India in
his courting days. She took it back with an impatient oath. When
she was gone the other women jeered Joan. Why had she been such a
fool? The woman did not know she had dropped it. There were ways
and means of making a little on that pin and judging by her
looks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Joan sank back drearily. She would not steal. The daughter
of old Spain had not fallen as low as all that. But she
couldn't&mdash;and wouldn't&mdash;explain to these women whom she
despised.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Treherne came back a couple of hours later she sought
out Joan, looking her up and down with critical eyes. She saw a
tall girl with a mop of untidy dusky hair, who stood up with a
slouch. There was a half-healed wound on her cheek; there were
shadows round her eyes, and a world of hopeless weariness in their
depths. She was ragged, dirty, unkempt, as bad as any woman there,
and God knows they were a disgrace to civilization.</p>

<p>''Ee didn't pinch the pin?'</p>

<p>Joan only looked at her, and made a little impatient movement
with her fingers. These people would never understand that her
father's daughter did not steal. What was the good of explaining?
Perhaps something of her thoughts was written on her face, for the
jailer went on in a kindlier tone.</p>

<p>'An' yet 'ee wunt wash they face an' comb thy hair.'</p>

<p>It was a truth put before Joan in an unexpected manner. Her
father&mdash;who would have been shocked at her
stealing&mdash;would have been equally shocked at her dirt. The
startled look on her face told the woman the shaft had gone right
home.</p>

<p>There was a trough for washing in the yard. But the inmates of
the women's portion of the prison were only allowed out there at
certain times.</p>

<p>'I'll let 'ee out an' 'ee can wash.'</p>

<p>She unlocked the door, and Joan followed her out into the cold
stony yard, where a bitter wind was blowing. The woman gave her a
piece of soap and an old towel.</p>

<p>There the girl, without any conveniences whatever, in the icy
cold water of the trough by the pump, washed herself well. Not only
herself, but her stockings and her ragged petticoat and
underclothes. How she was to get them dry she did not know. But it
was Joan's nature to do a thing whole-heartedly. She tied her
clothes to a line the woman had there. They flapped forlornly in
the bitter wind. The girl herself took such shelter as she could in
the angle of the door and combed out her wet hair.</p>

<p>There the jailer found her with white face and chattering teeth.
But the little kindness had comforted her. The woman saw at once an
improvement in this forlorn object.</p>

<p>'Why, Joan,' she said wondering,' 'ee's been a handsome
lass!'</p>

<p>'Has been!' At eighteen! But Joan did not see the irony of
it.</p>

<p>'A'm proper clean,' she said and tried to smile though she
shivered.</p>

<p>'Get 'ee inside, lass. 'Ee's perisht.'</p>

<p>Joan indicated her wet things. They were not much, but they were
nearly all that she possessed.</p>

<p>'I'll see as they're safe. Get in.'</p>

<p>The freezing girl was thankful enough for the fetid ward. It was
cold but it was warmer than outside. She wrapped herself in the
rough blanket that was her bedding.</p>

<p>The trifling kindness&mdash;for her life had been very bare of
kindness since her father's death&mdash;warmed Joan's heart. She
held herself more upright; she combed out her long dark hair;
always had it neatly wound round her head; and always she had a
smile for the jailer's wife.</p>

<p>The woman began to take a queer interest in her, and, seeing how
forlorn and bedraggled were her clothes in spite of all her efforts
at cleanliness, she one day gave her a blue dress. It was a linen
of a hard, bright colour that its former owner found most
unbecoming. It appealed to Joan.</p>

<p>It was with a funny little feeling of pleasure that was
pathetic, seeing she was in prison on a capital charge, that she
put on that dress. The gift made her feel as if a warm, friendly
hand had been stretched out to her in the cold darkness of her
life. She made the very best of herself. With the optimism of
youth, she began to hope for better things. If Daniel Reynell were
gone away he could not marry Loveday Corthew&mdash;not for three
years. And if Loveday Corthew married somebody
else&mdash;&mdash;She would&mdash;of course, she would. If Daniel
Reynell could only see her in this dress.</p>

<p>The next time Mrs. Treherne visited her charges Joan held
herself straight and smiling shyly&mdash;Joan was not accustomed to
smiling&mdash;thanked her warmly for her gift.</p>

<p>The metamorphosis in the girl astonished the woman. The weird
beauty that she had dimly seen before took her breath away. The
despised blue exactly set off Joan's dusky hair and vivid red lips;
it toned with the sea blue of long lashed eyes that looked out from
under dark level brows; it made a proper setting for clean-cut nose
and chin. When the red lips parted in a smile that showed the
milk-white teeth, the woman looking at her, the hardened jailer,
was fain to confess the girl was lovely beyond words. The cut in
her cheek had healed; but it had left behind a scar that
masqueraded as a dimple, and gave to her smile a curiously haunting
effect.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treherne felt there was something uncanny in the change in
her, and never guessed that the only sorcery was the magic of her
own kindness.</p>

<p>Joan's mother came to see her. She brought her some clothes, the
forlornest rags, and reviled her for bringing disgrace on the
tavern. She had drunk too much as usual, and would not listen to
Joan's eager questions about the press gang, and swept aside
carelessly her struggles to send a belated message to Raphiel Farm.
'Everyone knew,' she said, 'that Skipper Reynell was dead.' On that
she went away, leaving the girl sunk in the blackest woe.</p>

<p>For the moment.</p>

<p>But only for the moment. Had not she herself seen Daniel Reynell
in the hands of the press gang. He would be away for three long
years if no one rescued him. Of course no one would stop him
writing. At Raphiel Farm they probably knew all about it by now.
But if Loveday Corthew should think him dead&mdash;if only she
thought he had gone away for three long years&mdash;Loveday was not
the sort to wait. So Joan read her. She was a pretty girl with many
admirers. She would marry somebody else long before Daniel
Reynell's three long years were up. Joan was almost happy again in
the thought.</p>

<p>Her mother never came again. No one else came near her. She did
not know she had any rights and did not expect any one. Probably
the whole fishing village thought her guilty.</p>

<p>It did as a matter of fact. But it gave less attention to the
matter than would usually have been the case because it was taken
up with the disappearance of Daniel Reynell and the carrying off of
Bob Trevenick and Amos Garrett. It occurred to no one to connect
Joan with the matter.</p>

<p>'Have you no friends?' asked Mrs. Treherne.</p>

<p>Joan thought a moment. She was not sullen to this woman who had
been kind. Polperro would not have known her gentle. She wanted to
have friends because Mrs. Treherne seemed to expect it.</p>

<p>'No,' she said sadly.</p>

<p>'But the others?'</p>

<p>Joan looked at her puzzled.</p>

<p>'My mother'll be drunk when a' ain't home an' stepfather her'll
be drunk too. 'Sides her'll be main glad to be shut o' I.'</p>

<p>'But I meant,' said the woman gently; and, like Joan, she was
unaccustomed to being gentle, 'the others of the gang.'</p>

<p>Joan did not know she was reckoned a member of a clever gang of
clever horse thieves, taken red-handed, certain to be condemned to
death.</p>

<p>'What gang?' she asked in all innocence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Treherne thought she was shielding her mates, and thought
no worse of her for that.</p>

<p>'But they ought to get counsel for you,' she said.</p>

<p>'There's no money for counsel,' said Joan dispiritedly, thinking
how difficult she had always found it to meet the calls of quarter
day; knowing that her mother and stepfather would find it still
harder.</p>

<p>So the days went on to the Assizes.</p>

<p>The Judge and Sheriff came to the port with all pomp and
circumstance, with a band to welcome them, a company of soldiers to
guard them, and a chaplain to pray for them. They went to church,
and the next day in solemn array to the Courthouse, for the trial
of some miserable wretches who had never had a chance in life, and
were really much better men and women than might have been expected
considering their surroundings.</p>

<p>There was just a hint of the coming spring in the day. But the
Law Courts were cold and dark, so built that only here and there
could a ray of watery sunshine find its way through the long narrow
windows. One lighted up the coat of arms of England behind the
bench just over the Judge's head. The heraldic lion and unicorn and
the crown they upheld were in gold against a background of scarlet.
The craftsman who had fashioned them had made weird beasts. They
were very elongated with very long waists. In order to be quite
fair he had given the lion as well as the unicorn a horn in his
forehead. At the end of each horn was a little star, the facets of
which caught the sun's rays and twinkled like diamonds. There was a
collar of stars round each beast's neck, so that it seemed all the
lights in the court were focussed over the Judge's long grey
wig.</p>

<p>He, in his scarlet and ermine, looked gravely down into the well
of the Court crowded with people, mostly unwashed. He saw no way of
remedying the reek that rose from them. He did not look on it from
the point of view of the sufferers, but as one of the penalties
attached to his high estate. And he was human enough to fear jail
fever. In front of him was a bunch of herbs in a pot, while he had
hidden in his hand a small gold box that, beneath a chased cover,
held a piece of cloth steeped in aromatic vinegar.</p>

<p>The bar sat below at their table. There, too, were a couple of
bunches of sweet herbs.</p>

<p>Two men had been sentenced to death before Joan's case came on,
one for having wounded a man in a poaching fray, and the other for
having stuck up a man and taken from him 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> He
had pleaded he was starving, but that was no excuse in the eyes of
outraged law.</p>

<p>The jailer's wife, to her own amazement, had been good to Joan.
She had given her the chance to wash and iron the blue dress,
provided her with a neat mob cap of white muslin and a kerchief to
fold across her breast.</p>

<p>It had a curiously heartening effect upon the girl. The woman
spoke to her abruptly because she was afraid of her own
impulses.</p>

<p>But it is the thought that really matters. Joan felt the
kindliness, and was wildly, passionately grateful. It cheered and
comforted her on the way to the Courthouse.</p>

<p>She caused a little sensation there, though she did not know it.
Even Dick Penrhyn, strictly sober, and with his black hair neatly
plastered down with soap and water, looked at the stately young
woman behind the bars of the dock with some amazement. He had to
look again. Was this the wild cat whose hands he had tied and whom
he had flung into the cart?</p>

<p>She gave her name as Juana d'Ath. Polperro would have guffawed.
But so potent is the effect of a good appearance that the court did
not smile. The name suited this dignified young woman.</p>

<p>'Had she no friends?' asked the Judge.</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'No counsel?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>The Judge looked round the court and spoke very gravely in his
dignified voice.</p>

<p>'I sit here to administer justice. It is the earnest wish of
this Court that every man or woman accused here, however deeply
they may have sunk in iniquity, may have every facility to put
their case before the jury. I therefore call upon my learned friend
Mr. James Henniker Hilton to defend Juana d'Ath.'</p>

<p>Now it is the usual routine for the Judge to call upon the
junior member of the Bar present to defend a prisoner who has no
counsel. But one hundred and forty years ago they were not so
particular. It was the prisoner's affair to see to his own defence.
This Judge, however, was broad minded. He was anxious, too, to help
his young friend just called to the Bar.</p>

<p>James Henniker Hilton, pleased at the judge's notice, glad to be
concerned in the defence of so good-looking a girl, moved over to
consult the prisoner. Joan, leaning over the bars of the dock, told
him as quickly as possible how she had indeed taken the mare
feeling sure of Penrhyn's consent because it was for the rescue of
Daniel Reynell.</p>

<p>The young man, listening to the low voice, very musical if it
did speak in patois, saw himself making a great success of his
first case, glorified in the sight of the judge who had appointed
him. He was an ardent believer in truth. In his cross-examination
he would bring everything out.</p>

<p>But alas!&mdash;and alas! He was unused to the ways of Courts.
He made a shocking bungle of things.</p>

<p>Prosecution for the Crown provided two respectable farmers who
swore to taking the girl red-handed.</p>

<p>Counsel for the defence, questioning in search of Daniel
Reynell, found that he had not been taken by the press gang; that
the press gang had no right to take him; if they had by chance they
would immediately have released him. All the men taken had been
recognised; Robert Trevenick, the parson's son; George Simpson,
from Polruan; and Amos Garrett, a fisherman from Polperro. The
wives of these last were already drawing their pay, and Parson
Trevenick had no doubt about his son having been taken; he had
received notice from the Admiralty. No one had seen or heard of
Daniel Reynell in connection with the press gang; nor was there any
reason why this girl should be interested in him. He was
missing.</p>

<p>Counsel for the prosecution felt sure that was why she had used
his name. His hint threatened darker possibilities.</p>

<p>Counsel for the defence, in his efforts to improve matters,
succeeded in proving that his client had a bad reputation in
Polperro. This he rammed home by calling her mother and
stepfather.</p>

<p>Counsel for the prosecution called attention to the fact that
horse-stealing had been rife in the district; but it was the
defence that successfully brought to the notice of the court the
fact that the suspected leaders of the gang were known to meet at
the Pilchard, and that very low class fishermen's tavern was run,
in spite of her youth, by Joan. It was due to her that it had paid
better of late because these suspected people had made their
headquarters there.</p>

<p>This was all news to the listening girl. Never had she known so
much about herself before.</p>

<p>She had welcomed those strange men gladly&mdash;that was true
enough. Because of their coming she had been able to look forward
to quarter day for the first time since she had taken over the
tavern with a comparatively quiet mind.</p>

<p>The Judge asked her what reply she had to make to these
accusations. Pathetically she turned towards her counsel. His eyes
were kind, and she did not know how much he had already damaged her
case.</p>

<p>He looked at the Judge eagerly, for he was an eloquent young
man; the girl's beauty had moved him, and here he could have helped
her.</p>

<p>But the law of England in those days did not allow anyone
accused of felony to employ counsel to make his defence in court.
All counsel could do was to examine and cross-examine
witnesses.</p>

<p>The Judge was a not unkindly man in his own way. But he was
there to administer the law, not to question it. And he was a
stickler for the dignity of the court.</p>

<p>'The prisoner,' he said, his tones were leisurely, precise,
cultivated, impartial, cold, 'must answer counsel herself. My
learned friend,' he looked at the defending counsel tolerantly, he
knew a good man, and knew he would do well when he had had a little
more experience 'has done all he can. The law does not allow him to
speak for the prisoner. Juana d'Ath, what have you to say?'</p>

<p>Could even a girl of modern times under such circumstances have
defended herself? Joan certainly could not. She was terrified; she
was illiterate; she was at the best of times slow of speech, and
she was utterly ignorant. She looked from her counsel to the Judge;
back at Dick Penrhyn pleadingly and finally stammered out,</p>

<p>'A' never took mare.'</p>

<p>And that in the face of her having been caught on the mare's
back at dead of night!</p>

<p>The Court laughed.</p>

<p>The usher called threateningly for silence.</p>

<p>The Judge felt impatient. But, being a conscientious man, he was
prepared to give the criminal classes every chance.</p>

<p>'Prisoner at the Bar that is all you have to say.'</p>

<p>It was all unless she burst into a torrent of abuse such as she
had been wont to indulge in.</p>

<p>But Joan was never to do that again. Prison had subdued her. And
to-day she had come in contact with men and manners such as she had
not met since her father died. The young man who had tried to
defend her was a gentleman; the Judge was a gentleman. Something in
their manner so impressed the girl that wild ungoverned speeches
froze on her lips. She bowed her head in dignified, stately
fashion, and stood there with eyelids cast down. Her counsel noted
how beautiful were the long dark lashes that lay on her white
cheeks. She was trembling, but nothing in her demeanour showed her
terror.</p>

<p>The Judge charged the jury. She heard herself painted in the
blackest colours, yet realized that this man thought she was of
some account; she might be a danger to society. It was a new
thought to Joan that she might be of weight even if it were only
for evil.</p>

<p>They led her away to await the verdict in one of the low dark
cells below the Court. No one thought of giving her anything to eat
or drink; was she not a criminal bound to be sentenced to death? It
seemed to the Judge and to almost every one else including counsel
for the defence that there could be no need for discussion. Had she
not been taken actually riding the horse away.</p>

<p>But one of the jury was contrary, a man who was always making
excuses for the people. He thought that there might have been more
inquiries made about this Daniel Reynell. The girl was young. It
was hardly possible she could have made up the whole story. Perhaps
it was true this Daniel Reynell had told her she could safely
borrow the mare in his name. She might have done it in all
innocence.</p>

<p>The eleven good men and true laughed him to scorn, though it was
dark before they succeeded in convincing him they were only asked
to say whether she had taken the horse or not. Clearly she had.
There was really only one verdict to be given, and it was no good
staying there all night.</p>

<p>The Courthouse was dimly lighted by candles and evil-smelling
lamps when Judge and jury, prisoner and counsel, all came filing
back for the last scene. All the lights from the candles seemed to
be caught by the golden stars on the weird beasts of the coat of
arms of England. There was a coruscation of light above the head of
the dispenser of English justice, the handsome, clean-shaven Judge
in his great wig and his scarlet and ermine.</p>

<p>Joan fixed her eyes on his face. The well-cut thin lips were
pressed closely together.</p>

<p>'How say you?' asked the Associate turning to the jury, and his
tones rang through the Court, 'Guilty or not Guilty?'</p>

<p>Joan, listening intently, answered in her own mind. Of course,
'Not Guilty.' How could she be guilty? Why even Dick Penrhyn had
said he was surprised when he had got her into the light. Of course
she was not guilty. The Judge looked calm and self-possessed, but
not stern or angry.</p>

<p>Such a child we should think her nowadays, an irresponsible
child, needing care and training. But most of that Court saw a
good-looking young woman with handsome, regular features under her
big mob cap, a woman whose feet were set on a dangerous path, who
quite easily might be a peril to the community. There was not much
pity in the realm of Christian England in the end of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>'Guilty, my lord,' said the foreman.</p>

<p>Joan clutched tight at the bars to prevent herself from
shrieking aloud.</p>

<p>But this was only the jury. The Judge looked like a man who
would know better.</p>

<p>She could not guess that he placed all such as she in one
category, 'The Lower Orders.' The Lower Orders would be a danger to
the well-being of the community unless they were kept in their
proper place. A good-looking girl like this would be doubly a
danger. He was in the place where it was required of him to do his
duty by society. He did it to the very best of his ability.</p>

<p>Joan watched him put a black cap on the top of his grey wig. The
sparkling lights crowned it with a halo. They seemed to her to
speak of hope. She heard him saying something in his gravely
musical voice.</p>

<p>The first words made no impression so stunned was she by the
verdict. Then it seemed they boomed out, roaring in her ears,
filling the whole court.</p>

<p>'Hanged by the neck till you be dead. And the Lord have mercy
upon your soul.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'In all labour there is profit.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>'So, Amos Garrett, they have manhandled you.'</p>

<p>A strongly-made young fellow, in the uniform of a master's mate,
dark-eyed and brown-faced, was looking down at the sick man with
not unkindly eyes.</p>

<p>'I am not Amos Garrett,' said Reynell a little wearily. He was
tired of repeating it.</p>

<p>Fletcher Christian took him up sharply.</p>

<p>'And if you are not Amos Garrett who the devil are you
then?'</p>

<p>That little spark of interest was better than the cordial the
master's mate held in his hand. Reynell struggled up to a sitting
position and told his story. Christian listened with interest.</p>

<p>'So that's the way the cat jumps,' said he. 'Bligh's got this
expedition on the brain. He'd kidnap his own father if it brought
him a mite nearer his blessed breadfruit trees. The Lord knows if
they'll ever be worth the trouble he's taking.'</p>

<p>If Christian could only see the mountain sides of Jamaica now!
Perhaps he does.</p>

<p>'We've had the devil's own luck,' he went on, 'first one thing
and then another delaying us. Then these four beggars to run. Well,
even if Maitland didn't give him a hint&mdash;and I'd not put it
past him&mdash;Bligh would be sure not to inquire into anything
till we are in blue water. All he'd want to know is that the men
are sound.'</p>

<p>Reynell looked at him gloomily under his frowning brows. Black
before him stretched the years&mdash;years&mdash;and he had been
counting the hours to his wedding on Wednesday week.</p>

<p>'Here, drink this,' went on Christian. 'The surgeon sent it when
he had you carried into the fo'c'sle. Not a chance for you, I'm
afraid.' His voice was friendly. 'Here we are in the Chops of the
Channel with no possibility of seeing old England for three long
years to come. Suppose you write from the Canaries or Rio.'</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear of a letter fetching from those Dago
countries?' asked the unwilling recruit.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know. You might be lucky.'</p>

<p>Reynell flipped his fingers. He had no faith. And as a matter of
fact though he did write both from Teneriffe and Rio no letter from
him or any telling of his whereabouts ever reached Polperro.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> was bowling along before a keen east wind.
Though she was only under courses and tops'les Reynell knew that
every moment was taking him farther and farther from his home and
all that he held dear.</p>

<p>'See here, mate,' said Christian when they had spoken of the
hopelessness of letters, 'the only advice I can give you is to make
the best of it.'</p>

<p>'Would you? Would you? If your wedding day was fixed, the ring
bought, the house and the ship ready and the maid waiting for
you?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;' laughed the other, 'I'd like to see
the lass 'ud bother me. Man, there's an old salt of Cook's aboard
here tells me the wenches at our final port of call are all bronze
nymphs&mdash;he didn't put it in those words exactly&mdash;and,
bless you, they're waiting with open arms.'</p>

<p>Reynell turned away disgusted. The thought that another woman
might smile on him did not stir his blood. He wanted the fair face,
with laughing hazel eyes and golden curls; he wanted only the
decent, ordered life he had always worked for; that one woman
sitting by his fireside, his honoured wife, her children at his
knee.</p>

<p>'Cheer up, mate,' went on Christian kindly enough. 'Nothing so
bad but it might be worse. I see Bligh's booked you as leading
seaman already. Next step will make you a petty officer. I don't
think you'll have much difficulty in getting there by what I see.
What? The prospect doesn't allure you? Look here, man, don't throw
away your chances. Make a friend of Bligh. He's a jolly good friend
once you get him, but, by the living Jingo, he's a damned ruthless
enemy.'</p>

<p>'I shall do him a bad turn,' said Reynell sombrely.</p>

<p>'Well, don't tell me,' said Christian laughing, 'because it's
rank mutiny. I can't afford that, not being prepared to cut myself
off from old England yet awhile. Besides, Bligh's on top now. You
make the best of it. That's my advice,' and he strolled away
humming a tune.</p>

<p>It is a great thing to see but one path ahead. Reynell could not
lie moaning in the fo'c'sle like a sick girl. Presently, cheered in
spite of himself by Fletcher Christian's sympathy, he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>He was young, strong and worn out. He slept profoundly.</p>

<p>When he wakened, because he so thoroughly realised his own
helplessness, he bowed to his fate and went quietly to his
work.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> was 250 tons burden, ship rigged, a quaintly
unwieldy vessel. Also, because internally she had been prepared to
receive fruit trees, all the comfort of the ship's
company&mdash;and heaven knows it was not much considered long
after the <i>Bounty's</i> time&mdash;was disregarded. Reynell,
thinking of his own dainty <i>Reaper,</i> disliked her from the
first. He was a silent, embittered, disappointed man. Still he
worked, did his duty and more than his duty. He had not handled the
<i>Reaper</i> in wild winter weather in the Channel and all round
the stormy British coast without thoroughly understanding his
business.</p>

<p>Bligh, a critical man, had his eyes upon all his crew, but he
took no personal notice of his new leading seaman till the day a
wild easterly gale drove before it a sea that stove in part of the
stern of the labouring ship and tore all the planks from the large
cutter's bows. But for Reynell's promptness and skill the boat
would have been washed overboard.</p>

<p>When all had been made taut again, and the gale had passed,
Bligh called him out on the quarter-deck and publicly praised
him.</p>

<p>'You are a thorough seaman, Amos Garrett,' he ended on a note of
commendation.</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir.'</p>

<p>Though many of the men hated Bligh, and Reynell thought he hated
him worst of all, yet they all felt his praise was worth
having.</p>

<p>'But I am not Amos Garrett.'</p>

<p>'Not Amos Garrett?' Bligh's steely eyes snapped and his thin
lips shut closely together, 'then who the dickens are you?'</p>

<p>'Daniel Reynell, skipper and owner of the <i>Reaper</i> with a
protection.' He drew himself up, and stood before his captain a
tall, fair, bronzed young giant.</p>

<p>'So,' said Bligh, 'so,' and he looked him up and down as if
appraising at their full worth his inches and his brawn, 'then we
stole you and had no right to you?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, you had no right.'</p>

<p>'And you made no protest? There, there,' he put out his hand. 'I
remember now, you did protest. I know about how much good it would
be protesting to the bo'sun of the <i>Alert</i>.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.' Reynell spoke dully. The memory of those hours was
bitter still.</p>

<p>'Then, Daniel Reynell, since it has happened I am glad the
<i>Bounty</i> has the good fortune to have you on her books.'</p>

<p>Reynell was pleased in spite of himself. It is always something
to earn praise when the standard set is high. He remembered the
fight; the long vigil in the church; the weary day on the
<i>Alert</i>; the hopeless, feverish night that followed; the
morning when the clank of the anchor chains had beaten in on his
brain; the wedding day that was long past now; and instead of
bursting into angry execration now that he had the ear of
authority&mdash;and authority was sympathetic&mdash;he merely
saluted.</p>

<p>'I have tried to do my best, sir, though God knows I have wanted
to sink the ship and drown the lot of you.' But he spoke quite
respectfully.</p>

<p>Bligh smiled.</p>

<p>'I understand. I should have felt the same.'</p>

<p>'You're getting on, man, you're getting on,' said Christian
cheerfully. Reynell was in his watch, and they had many
opportunities of speech. Reynell was an educated man whom Christian
liked. Bligh, with extraordinary wisdom, had divided his crew into
three watches instead of the ordinary two. The master's mate was
head of one of them.</p>

<p>They went southward, ever southward, through the seas that have
been known since the days when the Ph&#339;nicians wandered south
and came back to tell an unbelieving world they had found the sun
in the north. The weather grew warmer and warmer; the wild winds
died away; the sun overhead was overpowering; below decks it was
like an oven; the men went languidly about their work and the very
pitch in the seams was melting.</p>

<p>It was calms and little puffs of wind, and contrary winds; but
still they went on little by little southward. They called at Rio;
they failed to round the Horn; they went back by the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p>The weather grew cool once more, and the days were sunny and
pleasant.</p>

<p>Then again it was cold, bitter cold. The gallant west wind came
strong astern of them, driving them into unknown seas. Lonely,
lonely seas, grey and empty seas, with a sky grey and lowering
above and great grey birds, swooping on outstretched wings
following the ship day after day. The albatross cried to them they
were intruders into these far places; they were straying beyond the
edge of the world and might go sailing on and on
till&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But that was a question the men leaning over the quarters
looking into the empty world of sea and sky could not answer. They
hushed their voices as they watched the racing seas and the
towering white topped waves, greater waves than any one of them had
ever seen before.</p>

<p>A puny thing was the good ship <i>Bounty</i> as she sank into
the trough, and they towered above her, taking the wind out of her
sails, punier still when she rose to the crest and they looked down
over a waste of grey water with never a sail; where they could not
expect a sail; where it would have been a phenomenon, perhaps, to
fear; never a sign of land; only the strange birds, graceful but
uncanny, beings from another
plane&mdash;following&mdash;following&mdash;waiting&mdash;some of
the men said with a shiver.</p>

<p>For the unknown had them in its thrall, and some
feared&mdash;all, perhaps, feared a little, they had hardly been
human else, but the spell was upon them. They accepted the fear
because of the wonder. And they told tales of the Flying Dutchman
who came out of the mists, sailing against the wind and brought
misfortune; of lovely maidens who dwelt at the bottom of the sea,
coming up to tempt men to their destruction&mdash;of bishop fish
that could swallow a greater fish than the <i>Bounty</i> at one
gulp&mdash;of the kraken&mdash;and the sea serpent only less to be
feared than the bishop fish.</p>

<p>They were staunch, brave men, as have always been British
seamen, but one thing was certain, the empty horizon voiced it, if
anything befell there was no hope of succour but in themselves.
They must face it alone.</p>

<p>The wonder was not that Bligh had been delayed because four men
had run, but that he had any crew at all with which to work his
ship.</p>

<p>All his life Reynell had lived and worked within the narrow
seas. He was an educated man, but once he had left school he had
had small use for books. He had been content; he had been more than
content. He thought every day how thankfully he would go back and
yet, though he did not know it himself, the witchery that holds the
explorer was upon him.</p>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%">'Something lost and something calling .
. .<br>
Come and find me.'</p>
<br>

<p>He looked out into the emptiness round, up to the heavy grey
clouds that hung threatening overhead. He listened to the wild
tales of the men. He thought of the girl who was waiting for him.
He began to count&mdash;hopefully now. So many weeks behind him,
and what a tale he would have to tell her when he came back!</p>

<p>Never for one moment did it occur to him that Loveday Corthew
would never understand that tale. From beginning to end the glamour
of this voyage, the glamour that held him, would be a sealed book
to her. She would think of these men ploughing the seas,
seeking&mdash;seeking&mdash;as men pining for their firesides and
for the loving arms that should enfold them. She would be tender
and sweet and true and roguish and merry, all almost that a dear
woman should be, but&mdash;she would never understand.</p>

<p>That, luckily, perhaps, Reynell did not know.</p>

<p>What he did, he did for her sake. She was the star to which he
had hitched his wagon. He felt he would come back to her, not the
narrow-minded ship master, skipper of the <i>Reaper,</i> satisfied
with his successful trading in the well-known tracks, but a man who
had been to the ends of the earth, who had indeed seen the glory of
God in the deep.</p>

<p>He hardly realized himself on what broader lines he was now
planning his life. He felt that if he pleased Bligh, a man who was
bound to rise to greater things, he would rise with him.</p>

<p>And he was pleasing Bligh&mdash;it delighted him to please such
a man.</p>

<p>He took to reading the books that Bligh lent gladly. He realized
for the first time in his life, how books might help and come into
the scheme of things. He worked to improve himself in his spare
time. He dreamed his dreams, and was happy, though he would have
laughed at any one who had told him so. For contentment is not
stagnation as so many would have us believe. It is the knowledge
that we are certainly on the right road to still better things.</p>

<p>Christian was his good friend. A wild, dare-devil young fellow
he was. Strangely enough, considering how their friendship had
begun before they reached Van Diemen's Land, it was Reynell who was
preaching patience to him, showing him how much wiser it would be
to keep in Bligh's good graces. It was Reynell who was pointing out
the wonder of the business on which they were bound; the glory that
would be theirs down to the smallest cabin boy if they succeeded in
transplanting the breadfruit, the fruit of which Cook had spoken so
highly, to the West Indies.</p>

<p>'Damn the breadfruit!' said Christian heartily, as he thrust his
hands well down into his pockets. 'Damn the <i>Bounty,</i> damn all
the beastly South Seas! Why the devil you take such an interest in
it all, Reynell, I'm blest if I know. What a damned fool I was not
to run like the others when I had the chance.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say you're not glad to be in it?' asked Reynell
astonished.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to tell me you are?' asked Christian in his
turn.</p>

<p>Reynell stopped short in his march up and down the deck.</p>

<p>'Of course I wanted to be married,' he said. 'No man likes to be
haled away leaving his woman on the altar steps. But hang it all!
It's a great business! It's a proud man I shall be when we come
sailing into Plymouth Sound.'</p>

<p>'The devil! The devil!' said Christian. 'I shall be finding you
loving Bligh next.'</p>

<p>'Well, he's wonderful!' with conviction. 'Wonderful!'</p>

<p>'You've forgotten how you cursed him?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Reynell, looking out over the sea and speaking
slowly, as if he were groping in his own mind for something which
he could not exactly lay hold of, 'it gives me a pain to think of
the old life and all it promised. But this is a great thing this
man is doing, that we are all doing. If I can only hold out and
wait,' he drew a long breath, 'it seems to me I shall have the old
life back with&mdash;with, hang it all&mdash;I'm not much of a
scholar, but with the wider horizon, sir, what all this will
give.'</p>

<p>Christian stared at him.</p>

<p>'Give me a good mug of wine in a nice little seaport town, with
my mates all round me, a buxom wench to bring it, a fresh one every
evening for choice&mdash;to hell with your faithfulness, it's
boring&mdash;and your wider horizon may go to pot for all I
care.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid we'll find neither the wine nor the buxom wench in
Van Diemen's Land.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Reynell was the first to acknowledge they found a
lovely land there.</p>

<p>Their water was fetid. They wanted wood and fresh meat
badly.</p>

<p>But Bligh would only give them one day. Time pressed. However,
he gave leave freely, for he knew quite well no man would stay
behind.</p>

<p>It was a park-like land, lying there beneath a sky of Italian
blue. The grass was fresh and green; there was a sound of murmuring
waters; the soft wind bore on its breath the fresh aromatic scent
of the untouched bush vibrant with the coming of spring. Oh, a
lovely land!</p>

<p>The sea-worn men wandered about for that whole day; rejoiced in
it; wished the captain would stay a week at least.</p>

<p>But Bligh was adamant. They had a great business on hand. Soon,
not so very long now, they would come to a still more enticing
land. There they would stay for a spell.</p>

<p>Reynell, looking at his stern face, felt there was not another
man in England could have managed this voyage as this man was
managing it. He vowed that he would follow him to the mouth of
hell.</p>

<p>He said so to Christian as they watched the shores of Van
Diemen's Land grow dim in the haze of the early morning.</p>

<p>Christian saw the sparkle of enthusiasm in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>'So that's what you've come to,' said he moodily, looking at the
fast receding land. 'Well, for my part, I'm ready to swear an oath,
so help me God, I'll never sail with Bligh again. Think of the
stinking water we've had the last few days. Faugh!'</p>

<p>'That was but a passing incident and not Bligh's fault.'</p>

<p>'It belongs to him. Mark you, the man who follows Bligh will
have to drink stinking water without a murmur sometime or other in
the course of his following.'</p>

<p>'That is a tribute to a great leader.'</p>

<p>The steady west wind swept them onwards. Van Diemen's Land saw
the last of the bad water for many a long day. They were in summer
seas now. The going was delightful. Once they cleared the southern
point of Australia they sailed north-east. It was neither too hot
nor too cold. There was a cloudless blue sky, and a pleasant
following breeze. Soon they began passing islands set like jewels
in a sapphire sea.</p>

<p>'The men say the Garden of Eden is hereabout,' reported Reynell
to his friend the next time he got the chance, 'or they think
possibly we're getting to heaven unawares.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know what drawbacks there are to heaven, but I
reckon we'll find a serpent in Eden somewhere before we're done,
specially with Bligh at the helm.'</p>

<p>But no one could complain of Bligh's harshness now. Eager as he
was to push on, whenever they approached an island he hove to and
traded with the natives, who looked upon the white men with awe and
wonder and bartered eagerly fruit and vegetables and fish for the
precious things they brought them; beads and axe heads and knives,
and very occasionally an old musket with a small store of powder
and shot for a very important chief.</p>

<p>Whatever came on board Bligh shared out equally, so that they
were in clover. Great content reigned. For, very naturally perhaps,
a large portion of a sailor's heart is in his stomach. These men
were living better now than most of them had ever lived in their
lives.</p>

<p>At length, one bright, fine tropical morning, when the scent of
the land came strong and good to the men's nostrils, and the hills,
clothed in feathery palms, stood clean cut against a deep blue
cloudless sky, the <i>Bounty</i> reached her port in Tahiti. There
came the clang of the anchor chains running out; the anchor fell
with an air of finality. They had arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>When that anchor came up, thought Reynell, they would be
homeward bound. He had taken a great step forward.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'I have come into my garden, my
sister, my spouse;<br>
I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;<br>
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;<br>
I have drunk my wine with my milk.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>The Garden of Eden the men thought Tahiti. Truly it is a
glorious land now, when steam has brought the Tropics within a day
or two of our shores, and we are more or less accustomed to them;
then, naturally, to these men, fresh from the rigours of the seas
further south, it was a very Paradise.</p>

<p>Bligh, too, relaxed the iron discipline in which he had held
them for the last ten months. As far as the working of the ship
allowed&mdash;a ship at anchor in a safe harbour does not ask for
much labour&mdash;his crew were free to do pretty much as they
pleased. Their leader had now shifted his point of view. Instead of
the stickler for naval discipline they found, no little to their
surprise, a man absorbed in the problem of how best to plant and
stow young breadfruit trees for their long journey down into the
icy south and back into warmer seas again.</p>

<p>All honour to Bligh.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever seen the tall, spreading, broad-leaved
breadfruit trees that grow in thousands on every mountain side and
round every little cabin in Jamaica, can but respect the man who,
at tremendous cost to himself, provided the West Indies, not only
with one of its handsomest trees, but with an almost inexhaustible
food supply.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> carried a botanist and a gardener. But their
keenness was as nothing to the keenness of the <i>Bounty's</i>
commander. These three, aided by Reynell, worked
assiduously&mdash;anybody under Bligh was bound to work&mdash;but
for most of the crew this was the land of the Lotus Eaters, a land
of plenty. The brown, lithe-limbed islanders were the friendliest
people in the world. There was no need to ask. Everything they had
was freely offered. The houses, clean, palm-thatched, nestling
among the greenery, fragrant with the scent of the sea and the
scent of the bush, were theirs to command. Heaped on the decks were
always shining, silvery fish fresh from the sea, yams that, boiled
and mashed, heaped up snowy white, rivalled the best potatoes,
scented, delicious bananas, yellow and pink, coconuts that, green,
gave a cooling drink, and ripe, a crisp, firm nut, better in that
climate than any flesh. There were all manner of fruits, such as
these men from the north had never heard of before. Every brown man
picked out one of the crew for special attention. Nothing was
denied his 'brother.'</p>

<p>The Englishmen accepted the homage calmly, for such is the
custom of the English.</p>

<p>They sail into some strange place. If the inhabitants are not
agreeable they accept it as all in the day's work, 'the blighters
know no better,' and fight for all they want, wood, or water, or
food. But if the inhabitants do all in their power to make them
welcome, they are also calm about it. They graciously allow
themselves to be welcomed, feeling that, somehow, they are not
quite clear why, it is only their due.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty's</i> men felt the Tahitians had evidently
realized, what they had always dimly felt themselves, their
superior worth.</p>

<p>Graceful girls, with softly-rounded limbs, clear golden skins,
tantalizingly half-hidden in wreaths of flowers and leaves, long
dark hair garlanded with hibiscus, languishing dark eyes and pearly
teeth, whispered in soft, liquid voices words that required no
translating.</p>

<p>Who could resist such houris?</p>

<p>With wives and sweethearts very far in the background, and a
long stretch of sea between, the crew of the <i>Bounty</i> found
them irresistible. The gardener, so absorbed in the heart of his
garden, was allowing just outside its walls the little weed to grow
apace that presently was to come to such proportions as to smother
the whole enterprise.</p>

<p>Like true sailors, careless of the future so long as the present
is good, the majority of the men set up housekeeping. Daniel
Reynell, looking at the homes of his shipmates, set in the shade of
handsome, spreading breadfruit trees, with every broad green leaf
glittering in the tropical sunlight, with stately coconut palms and
clumps of plantains and bananas offering bounteous plenty, was fain
to confess that these homes in their own way compared most
favourably with those from which these men had come; these wives of
an idle hour were as loving as ever English wives could have been.
Nay, more, no English wife would have been so submissive to her
husband, so open in her devotion, as these half-savage girls of the
South Seas. Whether they expected these strangers who had come
among them to remain he did not know. Probably they were like the
sailors; they, too, were living only for the present, taking no
heed for the future.</p>

<p>Bligh seemed to see nothing&mdash;or when he saw merely laughed
his grim laugh.</p>

<p>Reynell, because he had not succumbed to the general
fascination, seemed to be drawn closer to his commander. He was a
quartermaster now. The distance between a quartermaster and the
commander of a ship was great even in those days, when ratings were
not so clearly defined. But the one thing these two had in common
in a measure bridged it.</p>

<p>'Look at that, Reynell,' said Bligh, thrusting out a long spear
he carried, 'what d'ye think of that?'</p>

<p>Bob Trevenick scrambled to his feet shamefacedly. He had been
caught stretched out on the warm sands in the shade of a group of
coconut palms. A golden-skinned girl bent over him and gave him
coconut milk to drink.</p>

<p>'It's no business of mine,' said Reynell soberly, 'but I assure
you, sir, it is worrying me not a little.'</p>

<p>Bligh laughed.</p>

<p>'The exuberance of youth. I am not entirely without insides as I
believe the men think.' He knew everything, did Bligh. 'We must
relax a little after a voyage like ours. It's only skin deep with
most of them. Tops'le sheets'll cure it.'</p>

<p>'Do you think so, sir? Sometimes I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Damn you, Reynell!' Reynell knew he was highly favoured. 'There
are always two sides to a thing. I prefer to look at the one I like
best. A sailor's expected to have a wife in every port. You and I
have not succumbed.'</p>

<p>'You took me,' said Reynell with sudden sombreness, 'when my
woman was waiting for me on the altar steps. I know she's waiting
there still, and I'm going back to her.'</p>

<p>'So,' Bligh laid his hand on his quartermaster's shoulder. Bligh
was a man whose touch gave honour, 'my friend, she will get back a
man far better worth having.'</p>

<p>A light sprang into Reynell's eyes.</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir. I do believe, strange as it
seems&mdash;&mdash;' he hesitated for the right word. 'You've made
a man of me, as the bos'un of the <i>Alert</i> said you would.'</p>

<p>'Ah, the man was none of my making. He was there before. But we
have shown the man something of the world worth seeing. This voyage
will mark an epoch in your life.'</p>

<p>'A step upward,' said Reynell. He hardly knew how earnest were
his own words.</p>

<p>'Well we are not going to stop there,' said Bligh, 'make your
mind easy as to that. I think the quartermaster will share and
share largely in the <i>Bounty's</i> honours.'</p>

<p>His listener was more than content. It seemed to him that all
the weariness of the struggle was behind him; before him lay a
future alluring in its vagueness. All, all was to be laid at the
feet of a girl with laughing hazel eyes and golden hair. Even the
one little misgiving was but a thing of the moment. It would
pass.</p>

<p>Christian brought it back again. On another occasion he, too,
pointed out Bob Trevenick, Bob lazily in the shade, with his head
on a flower-wreathed girl's lap.</p>

<p>'How would that girl look, d'ye think, dressed just as she is in
green leaves and scarlet hibiscus in the old Talland Church
parsonage?'</p>

<p>He laughed aloud at the picture he had conjured up.</p>

<p>''Tis all very well to laugh,' said Reynell gravely, 'but it's a
serious matter. What are you going to do with Lola when we sail?
The breadfruit trees are nearly all collected. We must sail
soon.'</p>

<p>He expected some laughing answer about Jack returning to the
true love of his heart. Trevenick had given him that answer a dozen
times. But he had never before ventured the question with his
superior officer.</p>

<p>To his surprise no such answer came. Glancing round, he saw
Fletcher Christian, with very tender eyes, was looking across to
where he could just see his own little palm-leaf hut.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian! Sir!'</p>

<p>'That's the question, Reynell. That's the question. We have put
down roots here. How are we ever going to tear them up
again&mdash;ruthlessly&mdash;ruthlessly?'</p>

<p>'It is not as bad as that surely?' said Reynell, speaking
lightly, for there was that in Christian's face that made him turn
his eyes away.</p>

<p>'It is as bad as can be,' said Christian, sombre as Reynell
himself had been many a time. 'Sometimes I feel, quartermaster,
that I can't go back.'</p>

<p>Reynell was amazed.</p>

<p>He turned it off lightly.</p>

<p>'Who's talking rank mutiny now, sir?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Mutiny,' repeated Christian. 'Oh, no! It needn't come to that.
They could do without me. Why, you could take my place easily.'</p>

<p>'You wouldn't ruin your whole career for a dark-skinned girl,
surely?'</p>

<p>'Damn it all, Reynell,' said Christian fiercely, 'do you think I
want to ruin my career? Do you think I don't lie awake at nights
counting the cost, seeking a way out? But what other way is there?
I can't take her, that's clear enough. And how can I leave her? My
God! How can I leave her! Think of the loving trust in those soft
eyes! She believes in me, man! She thinks there's no one in the
world like me! Why, her eyes would haunt me all the days of my
life! I should never see a little child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>Reynell whistled a little in his dismay.</p>

<p>'Would you take everything given so trustfully&mdash;so
freely&mdash;would you use the woman who loved you for your own
convenience, then sail away without the faintest prospect of ever
coming back again? Is that a nice thing for a decent man to
contemplate doing?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Reynell slowly and reluctantly. He thought of Loveday
Corthew. Was it possible this man loved this dark girl, Lola, as he
loved Loveday Corthew? He dared not say to this fierce young man,
who was taking the matter so seriously, that he had considered
these connections as something purely temporary. The others were
not half as much in earnest he was sure. He had scented danger,
because he felt they were entranced with the sensuous life, that
contrasted so wonderfully with the hard life of a sailor; but he
was sure they did not love those who ministered to their delights.
This was putting the matter on an entirely different plane. This
man was desperately troubled. He tried to bring him back to
normal.</p>

<p>'You'll come on board to-night, sir, won't you?'</p>

<p>'Why should I? Bligh has never asked for me. Reynell, Reynell,
the days are flying so quickly. I count them. I lie awake counting
them.'</p>

<p>'He asked for you last night.'</p>

<p>'Well, he said nothing when he found I wasn't there.'</p>

<p>Christian turned away in the direction of his native home, and
the quartermaster returned on board the <i>Bounty</i> very troubled
indeed.</p>

<p>That night Bligh, strolling along the deck, stopped opposite
Reynell. The tropic moon was at its full, and high overhead; the
waters of the harbour were golden; the great feathery tops of the
palms leaning over the sea were shimmering in her light; every rope
and yard was outlined in inky black on the snowy decks. The faint
land wind, so faint as hardly to ruffle the surface of the sea, yet
brought with it a nameless fragrance, balmy, enticing. Reynell,
leaning idly over the quarter, was drawing in long breaths,
thinking of Loveday. How she would love this. Because he was
counting the days till they should be homeward bound his thoughts
ran on to Christian and his predicament.</p>

<p>But a brown girl&mdash;a brown girl!</p>

<p>Across his thoughts came cutting Bligh's voice; hardly friendly
now, somewhat harsh and metallic, with just perhaps a touch of
anxiety in it.</p>

<p>'Quartermaster, where is Mr. Christian?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' Reynell started, 'in his bunk.'</p>

<p>'You know very well he is not. Go and fetch him.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' in protest.</p>

<p>'That'll do, Reynell. You know and I know he isn't on board. Go
and fetch him.'</p>

<p>Bligh was not a man to be trifled with, still Reynell dared to
linger a moment. He sought vainly some excuse for Christian.</p>

<p>'Fetch him in double quick time,' thundered Bligh, and Reynell
knew that the misgivings that had assailed him had taken firm hold
of his commander also.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to fetch him. With a sinking heart
he went ashore and made his way to Christian's hut. He stood
outside in the scented moonlight and looked at the little place
covered in a smother of hibiscus and starry passion-flowers. The
purple cross in the centre of the blossoms stood out black against
the waxen white wide-open petals.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian!'</p>

<p>The stillness was not broken for a moment. He could hear the
roar of the breakers on the outer reef; the faint rustic of the
fronds of the coconut palms; but here all was still; not a sound;
not a breath. His heart was heavy. He had never enjoyed these
gorgeous tropics to their full, always he had counted them but as a
means to an end. Now some presentiment of evil had hold of him.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end. Success was as vital to
Daniel Reynell as it was to Bligh himself. As he stood there in the
moonlight he feared he knew not what.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian!'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' came the answer at last. 'What is it?'</p>

<p>'Sir, the captain has sent me for you.'</p>

<p>'The devil! At this time of night! What's his little game?'</p>

<p>'He sent me to fetch you,' repeated Reynell.</p>

<p>He heard a few words in the soft language of Tahiti; then
Christian joined him, evidently troubled. His anxiety showed itself
in a display of temper.</p>

<p>'What does the brute mean by sending for me at this hour of the
night, eh, Reynell?'</p>

<p>'I suspect,' said Reynell soberly, 'he's beginning to gather
things in ready for departure. The breadfruit trees are nearly all
on board you know. He wants to get his officers and men accustomed
to being on board again. It is very necessary,' he added
significantly.</p>

<p>'My God!' groaned Christian, half to himself. 'What is a man to
do?'</p>

<p>Bligh was not a man who could ever wait quietly, even though, as
now, he had expected to wait. Besides, he had been employing his
time in going over the situation, and he didn't like the look of
it. There was not a man on board who by any excuse could be on
shore. There was not an officer on watch.</p>

<p>They found him marching up and down the little poop deck.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this, Mr. Christian?' he said. 'How is
it I have to send ashore when I want an officer? A son of a sea
cook you are. A damned lazy, skulking hound&mdash;&mdash;' and for
the next two minutes he poured on the astonished young man's head a
torrent of wild sea epithets.</p>

<p>Christian stood still a moment too utterly astonished to speak.
Indeed he had no apology to offer. He had no right to be absent
from his ship without leave. His only excuse was that Bligh had
seemed to wink at it.</p>

<p>Reynell slipped away out of sight, but not out of earshot. He
was quite aware that he, as an onlooker, an impartial man,
understood the feelings of these two better than they, at the
moment, did themselves. Bligh, now that he began to think of
departure, was appalled at the state of affairs his own slackness
had brought about.</p>

<p>He checked himself by the time he had thoroughly roused
Christian to wrath.</p>

<p>'Where were you, Mr. Christian?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I was with my wife, sir.'</p>

<p>'Your what? Your what?' Bligh asked significantly.</p>

<p>'With my wife, sir,' said Christian, a note of defiance in his
respectful voice.</p>

<p>Bligh looked at him, standing there in the golden moonlight, as
if he were inspecting some rare and extraordinary thing he had this
moment seen for the first time. There was really more insult in his
attitude than in his angry and abusive words of a moment
before.</p>

<p>'Pardon me, Mr. Christian.' There was no one could be so rude as
Bligh when occasion offered. 'Pardon me, I didn't quite catch what
you said. Doubtless you have some good excuse to offer. Where did
you say you were?'</p>

<p>Christian's anger was rising.</p>

<p>'I said I was with my wife.' He laid a slight emphasis on the
'wife'.</p>

<p>'Do I hear aright?'</p>

<p>'You did, sir.'</p>

<p>'Your wife. Come, I like that.' Bligh laughed disagreeably. In
the bright moonlight the young man could see he was not in the
least amused. 'Your wife! A dark-skinned girl, whose best gown is
merely a wreath of hibiscus, the wife of an officer in his
Majesty's navy! It's the best joke I've heard for a long time. What
do you propose to do with the lady when your duties call you to sea
once more? It strikes me the Admiralty will have some little
difficulty in sending her share of your pay. Have you thought of
any little arrangement that might be made?'</p>

<p>Christian had been thinking of nothing else, day and
night&mdash;since&mdash;since&mdash;well, it seemed to him since he
had held Lola in his arms, felt her yielding to his embrace. He
loved her with all the fervour of hot-blooded five-and-twenty. The
thought of parting made him sick with misery. And Bligh was making
a joke of the matter.</p>

<p>'She is my wife, sir,' he said as soberly as his passion would
allow. 'She is as certainly my wife as if we had been wed by the
priest. I cannot help it that there is none here to do it. We have
been married by the rites of her own people.'</p>

<p>'Faith, those need never trouble you nor anybody else,' laughed
Bligh. He felt a little relief in getting the matter aired. His
temper was passing. 'They hold such bonds lightly hereabouts. Now,
Mr. Christian, I choose to have my officers on board at night, so,
unless by my express leave, you will be on board by sundown every
night for the future. Do you hear?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Christian as if his thoughts were miles
away.</p>

<p>'Your wife,' with a little emphasis on the word, 'will easily
find some one to console her, and will&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But he did not finish the sentence. Christian was on him in a
moment. Lithe and strong and sinewy, he was shaking him as a
terrier shakes a rat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'The heart knoweth his own
bitterness;<br>
and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy?'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Loveday Corthew was a good girl, a sweet, loving girl, who would
make any man, who did not look for enterprise in a woman, an
excellent wife. Very naturally, seeing she was a woman, she liked
attention from men.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell had been her willing slave ever since she had
budded into womanhood. She had been proud at the thought of
marrying him. To disquiet and excite her came Thomas Quested, in
all the glory of his blue and gold. He said nothing with his lips,
but his eyes told his story.</p>

<p>They moved her, shamed her a little, because they had power to
move her, and yet filled her with a certain curious pride in
herself, because she barely responded and firmly intended to be
true to Daniel Reynell.</p>

<p>Then came the day of the storm, the high tide and the raid of
the press gang. She had spent that night safe in the farmhouse,
listening to the shriek of the wind, not guessing at the
destruction that was going on below; rising with the pleasant
thought that she would meet one lover, perhaps two that day.</p>

<p>No lover came&mdash;not even the one she had a right to
expect.</p>

<p>'My maid,' comforted her father, 'look at the weather.'</p>

<p>It took a day or two to discover that Daniel Reynell was not
there to come. Another day or two, and it was plain he had vanished
from the district.</p>

<p>Uncertainty is a very hard cross to bear.</p>

<p>Loveday's face grew white and worn, for if she did not yet
realize how desperately a woman might love, this man she was to wed
had been her playmate and friend ever since she could remember, and
she had a deep affection for him.</p>

<p>Where was he?</p>

<p>He was not on board the <i>Reaper</i>. His two mates were
looking for him. His housekeeper had seen nothing of him since the
storm. He was nowhere in Polperro. He had not been pressed, they
were sure of that. Loveday falteringly suggested they should ask
Lieutenant Quested.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Quested had left the town. Men had been pressed.
Their names had been sent in. They knew them all. Three had gone to
the <i>Bounty</i> and three to the fleet at Plymouth. It was a
serious loss to the town. But Daniel Reynell was not among them.
Anyhow they would not take him. He had a protection. Taken, he
would have been instantly released.</p>

<p>Joan of the Pilchard had been taken for horse-stealing that same
night. But no one gave more than a passing thought to the drudge of
the little low fishermen's tavern. Her mother was drinking worse
than ever now she was gone. Some one said she had taken Joan
clothes, but that was simple waste, for Joan was sure to be hanged.
No one connected her with Daniel Reynell, not even her mother and
stepfather, who, if they had used their wits, might have remembered
they had seen him taken.</p>

<p>'Where, in God's name, can he be?' asked the farmer. 'There's my
maid well nigh crazy with the uncertainty of it, and the day fixed
for next week!'</p>

<p>There the curtain dropped. At one fell swoop Loveday had lost
both her lovers.</p>

<p>The farmer was sorry.</p>

<p>But he was mortal. His house was a dreary place with only a
mourning daughter for company. He hastened his wooing of Mistress
Treluan, the buxom widow of his neighbour, and brought her home to
the farm on the pretext that it would be good for his little maid
to have the company of another woman.</p>

<p>Loveday had ruled in her father's house ever since she was a
small child. The new Mrs. Corthew, a woman of the world, knew it
would be bitter for her to take second place. She meant very well
by her husband's daughter. She had married her own very
satisfactorily and did not doubt she could do the same for his.
Since Daniel Reynell was, if not dead, apparently gone out of the
girl's life, she felt it well that Lieutenant Quested should be
encouraged. All Polperro knew how he had looked at Loveday Corthew.
The girl was very sweet, and should be easily won.</p>

<p>But not too easily. Her kindly stepmother meant to take care of
that. She set about the business of matchmaking skilfully, and with
right good will.</p>

<p>Poor Loveday. She had lost her lover, and her father no longer
had need of her. She, who had been the head of the household, was
displaced, loved most dearly, but the third person. That was a
trouble she could not put into words. Where she had given orders
she had now to take them. She had lost everything. Even the dignity
that comes from great grief she found but a passing thing.</p>

<p>That was a truth Mrs. Corthew let sink in. She had every
intention of mending things, but she must have the soil ready.
Midsummer came, and a white-faced little girl sat beneath the trees
idly sewing for the baby that was coming, the baby that would set
her still farther from her father, who had been hers only. Harvest
and the heat tired her, and nothing had come to fill the blank in
her life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corthew felt the time was ripe. She suggested to the son
she had left at Treluan that he should invite Lieutenant Quested
down for the shooting. Reuben Treluan fell into line right
heartily.</p>

<p>His invitation was accepted with alacrity. The sailor had not
forgotten the girl he had found so charming. Of course a lieutenant
in the navy was better without a wife.</p>

<p>But possibly he was going to the ends of the earth. He would
like to take with him the remembrance of a sweet rosebud of an
English girl. He felt pathetic about it.</p>

<p>In fact, Lieutenant Thomas Quested was a good deal more in love
than he himself realized. Certainly Reuben Treluan was a little
surprised at the insistence of his guest that it was his bounden
duty to pay his respects to Mrs. Corthew at once.</p>

<p>Afterwards the thing explained itself to Mr. Treluan's laughing
eyes.</p>

<p>At first Loveday accepted his attentions languidly. But she did
accept. He made her feel she was first with him, and that was a
position Loveday had not held since Daniel Reynell had disappeared.
She would be of less account than ever on the farm if the baby were
the son the farmer was counting on, an heir to carry on the old
name.</p>

<p>What is the position of a sister more than eighteen years older
than her brother? All her life she must stand aside.</p>

<p>A woman need not be very selfish if such an outlook does not
appeal to her.</p>

<p>So Lieutenant Quested was comforting because he undoubtedly
thought a great deal of her, and was much more anxious to sit under
she trees with Mrs. Corthew's stepdaughter than to go shooting
pheasants with Mrs. Corthew's son.</p>

<p>Indeed, he found himself a great deal more in love than he had
ever intended to be. Day and night he thought of nothing but those
hazel eyes with the wistful, pathetic look in them. If he could
make her laugh he counted the day a red-letter one.</p>

<p>Before his visit was over he had spoken. He was quite convinced
in his own mind now, that a naval officer was better married. It
steadied him. He planned he would come back during his Christmas
leave and put the momentous question.</p>

<p>He didn't.</p>

<p>He couldn't wait.</p>

<p>He asked her, stammering and stuttering like a schoolboy, the
day before he intended to post to Plymouth.</p>

<p>'Loveday&mdash;Loveday&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;won't&mdash;won't
you&mdash;will you&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Oh what need of words!</p>

<p>The sun fell full on the opposite bank of the lane, on the
trailing blackberry wreathed with white convolvulus and
honeysuckle, on meadowsweet and blue corn cobs and on a tuft of oak
just touched by the finger of autumn. A bee droned drowsily in the
air, and a big black beetle tried vainly to climb over the handle
of Loveday's basket. They supposed themselves to be
blackberrying.</p>

<p>'Loveday! Loveday!' She felt his breath on her cheek; saw the
eagerness in his eyes. She turned away, and buried her face in the
bank at her side, crushing the wild thyme against her cheek.</p>

<p>'Oh don't! Oh don't!'</p>

<p>'I can't help it,' he said desperately, and his voice broke. 'I
love you. Whether you love me or not I shall always love you.'</p>

<p>It was the break in his voice that did it.</p>

<p>'Oh!' She frankly broke down sobbing. 'But there is Daniel
Reynell. How could I be so mean!'</p>

<p>Thomas Quested could have sung a pæan of joy. Only a dead man
stood in the way now, and, spite of a twinge of jealousy, a dead
man is not a tangible rival.</p>

<p>'He is dead, my dear,' he said very, very tenderly. What woman
is not won by tenderness. 'If he were alive could he have stayed
away from you? I want to take care of you, my darling. Loveday, I
will not ask more at first&mdash;just let me take care of you.'</p>

<p>A modest man! He might have asked more.</p>

<p>He held her in his arms, and she clung to him, just a little
ashamed. A little over nine months since Daniel Reynell had gone
out of her life and she was in another man's arms. All the
convention of the time was against it, and convention, whether we
will or no, does, in a way, guide our lives.</p>

<p>He soothed her.</p>

<p>'I am only asking to take care of you. You cannot mourn all your
days.'</p>

<p>Had she not always loved him best? The thought was in his mind
and in hers. A comforting thought to them both though neither spoke
it aloud.</p>

<p>'But if he should come back,' she breathed.</p>

<p>The thought came to Quested that she did not want him back. The
poor dead! Their place is filled. No, it was not that. He knew he
could always have won Loveday Corthew.</p>

<p>Loveday cried on then, cried away all the grief, all the
discomfort, all the vague, unexplainable tribulations of the last
nine months, with her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Before night they had confided in a sympathetic and kindly
stepmother, who approved highly, and understood so thoroughly that
she succeeded in putting the girl on very good terms with herself.
The farmer was pleased, and even Quested got a word of comfort.</p>

<p>'She thinks of Reynell still,' he had said as a man states a
fact he hopes will be denied.</p>

<p>'My dear boy,' said the wise stepmother, 'never grudge her such
thoughts as she gives the man who first came courting her. I saw
her with him and I know. The day you two are wed Daniel Reynell
will be but a dim shadow.'</p>

<p>He went away a glad and happy man. He was to come back at
Christmas and they would fix the wedding day.</p>

<p>He came before that. He marched into the sitting-room one stormy
day early in December, when the farmer was bending happily over the
wooden cradle where lay the son of his old age. His daughter was
looking on a little forlornly.</p>

<p>The farmer wanted to talk about his son. His wife was wiser.</p>

<p>'We are very glad to see Lieutenant Thomas Quested,' said she,
'but we do wonder what gives us the pleasure so soon.'</p>

<p>'I am Captain Quested, at last,' he said proudly, and his eyes
danced, for he had seen the light come into Loveday's face as he
entered, 'I, a man without a spark of influence.'</p>

<p>'Congratulations, my boy. Loveday, give him a kiss for
that.'</p>

<p>The sailor slipped his arm round her waist lightly.</p>

<p>'Will you let her come across the sea with me?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Nay, nay,' said the farmer, 'we cannot part with our little
maid. You will get you a house in Plymouth. Then she can come
across, and see how the boy and the old folks are getting on.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Quested, 'they are fitting out ships to take the
convicts to New Holland. The captain of the <i>Venus</i> has died,
and they have offered his place to me.'</p>

<p>'New Holland!' said the farmer vaguely. 'New Holland!'</p>

<p>Farmers in Cornwall knew little about Australia in those
days.</p>

<p>'The plantations are to be there now we've lost Virginia.'</p>

<p>'But 'tis the other side of the world!' He felt much as we
should feel if some enterprising young lover were to speak of
taking his bride to Mars.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Quested with a motion of his hand, 'away in the
South Seas. Captain Cook says it is a goodly land.'</p>

<p>'But you cannot take our little maid there!'</p>

<p>There was a finality about the farmer. For a moment Quested
looked cast down.</p>

<p>'We might come back in two years,' he said.</p>

<p>'Two years!' said the farmer. 'No, no. When you come back we'll
think about it. Loveday is needed at home.'</p>

<p>Loveday thought, was she? They were good to her. They loved her,
but was she needed now? Did not the farmer and his wife and the
little son make a perfect trio? Thomas Quested gave her dignity,
put purpose into her life. She would be first with him. How could
she decline to go? The future looked dark without Captain Quested.
Two long years playing second fiddle to the baby.</p>

<p>She was a loyal little soul, and would not for the world have
put her thoughts into such words. But that idea lay behind. She
wanted Captain Quested. She had not before realized how much she
wanted him.</p>

<p>'Oh, father,' she said, 'I want to go!'</p>

<p>After a night's discussion the farmer gave in, and there went to
bed that night a wildly, deliriously happy sailor man.</p>

<p>The <i>Venus</i> was to sail in two months' time, and Mr.
Corthew had promised that he should wed his daughter and take her
out with him.</p>

<p>Best of all! The moving spirit in the decision had been that
daughter herself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'He that soweth iniquity shall reap
vanity;<br>
and the rod of his anger shall fail.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Just for one moment Christian held his superior officer by the
throat, as if he would do murder. Then he let him go, and, with a
sweeping bow, apologized.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, sir. I am sure you will forgive a man who
cannot allow even his commanding officer to speak ill of his
wife.'</p>

<p>Bligh's face worked. He seized the young man by the
shoulders.</p>

<p>Then he looked round. There had been no witnesses.</p>

<p>He stepped back and shook his clenched fists. A set look came
over his face. In the clear moonlight the man before him saw it
like a mask, and guessed the meaning of it.</p>

<p>In truth, he was remembering that most of the other men had
formed ties just as this young fellow had done. If they chose to
insist upon the permanence of those ties his expedition was ruined.
Here he was, at their mercy. True, he could come back with a
cruiser and teach them that there was no limit to the reach of
England's power. But that could only be for the future. His
breadfruit trees, collected with so much care and trouble, would be
lost by a quarrel with his officers. Already he was not on good
terms with his master. He must try more subtle means.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian,' he said coldly, 'I am surprised at you. You
surely remember it is rank mutiny to lay hands on your superior
officer?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.' Christian was shaking with anger, and spoke rarely
above his breath. Even Bligh could see he was putting a bridle upon
his passion. 'I could murder the man who spoke ill of my wife.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Bligh. 'Some allowance must be made for a lad's
foolish infatuation. You will know better as you grow older. Go
below, Mr. Christian, and consider yourself under arrest till
to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>Christian hesitated. Looked round over the moonlit sea; then
obeyed quietly.</p>

<p>As for Bligh, he walked up and down the poop half the night
before he, too, went below.</p>

<p>Next morning he had decided on the course he should take. As
soon as he had breakfasted he sent for Christian.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian,' as if he had entirely forgotten the painful
incident of the night before, 'you will be glad to hear we are
pretty near homeward bound at last. You will take the longboat and
sail along outside the reef to the village where we got those last
breadfruit trees'&mdash;it was a good twelve hours away&mdash;'and
see about laying in a store of vegetables for the voyage. We've
eaten the country out round here.'</p>

<p>It was a perfectly reasonable request. Christian knew he was
getting off very lightly. But he looked moody as he came on deck
and gave the necessary orders. Reynell saw him and begged to be
taken.</p>

<p>For a moment Christian hesitated.</p>

<p>'No, Reynell, I won't take you. I don't trust him somehow. He's
got something up his sleeve for me. Stay here and look after my
little wife, will you? If aught ill should come to
her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You will have to leave her, sir, next week.' Reynell did not
look at him.</p>

<p>'Ay, but how I'm to do it I do not know.'</p>

<p>Reynell laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>'We manage to do a good many things we do not like.' Then he
smiled, for homeward bound meant to him the green hills round
Polperro and the laughing eyes of Loveday Corthew.</p>

<p>When Christian was gone Bligh went ashore and wandered up to the
hut Christian had called his home.</p>

<p>They lay close in. Plainly from the <i>Bounty's</i> deck Reynell
could see him standing there talking to Christian's wife, who had
come out and stood shyly before him. He took her by the chin and
looked down into her face critically.</p>

<p>Peter Heywood, a midshipman of seventeen, a dare-devil young
scamp from the Isle of Man, speaking broad Manx, laughed openly. It
was odd to see their Captain with a girl's face between his hands.
But Charles Stewart, an older man though still a midshipman, shook
his head.</p>

<p>'Christian would half kill him if he could see. The girl is
right enough. She thinks it's her duty to be civil to Christian's
captain. I wonder what she dare refuse him. They've different
standards from us. If I catch him so much as looking at my Tolea,
by the nine gods, I'll skin him alive.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' said Peter Heywood, 'we'd best be givin' her a hint
to be hidin' in the bush till her man's back.'</p>

<p>'Upon my word,' said Stewart, 'I believe it'ud save
bloodshed.'</p>

<p>Reynell, listening, decided if they did not he would.</p>

<p>When Bligh left the girl and strolled away to the village he
turned to Stewart who was the officer of the watch in Christian's
absence. For six months no watches had been kept. This morning
Bligh had set them again. He was tightening things up. The men
chafed, but it was very necessary, seeing how soon they would be at
sea again.</p>

<p>'May I go ashore for a moment, sir?'</p>

<p>'What d'ye want to go ashore for, Reynell? Strict orders none of
the watches to be allowed ashore unless they're sent.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't you send me, sir?'</p>

<p>'Well, I like that. I could, of course. What do you want
ashore?'</p>

<p>'To&mdash;&mdash;' Reynell checked himself. 'No harm, sir,' he
said earnestly. He knew very well the other two knew he had heard
their conversation. As a superior man, in the general relaxation of
discipline he was on very friendly terms with the young officers,
'only maybe it's as well you shouldn't know aught about it.'</p>

<p>'Mysterious,' said Stewart. 'Well, really&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's as well,' said Reynell, looking at Christian's little hut,
'to avoid all causes of quarrel.'</p>

<p>Peter Heywood grinned. Stewart, smiling, said,</p>

<p>'Perhaps it would be as well if I kept an eye seaward when I
send you ashore to tell Trevenick, whom I see doing himself very
well over there, that the brasswork about the capstan head demands
his immediate attention.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir.'</p>

<p>Promptly Reynell was ashore delivering the message to Trevenick,
who swore he intended to cut such a dog's life at the first
opportunity. Reynell did not stay to listen, but made for
Christian's hut. Not standing on ceremony, he stepped inside, for
he did not want Bligh to catch him.</p>

<p>Lola, Christian had called his wife, because he swore she was a
Spanish beauty. She was a pretty girl of sixteen, with a golden
brown skin, soft, melting brown eyes, streaming dark hair, and
softly rounded limbs. Her manner was gentle and confiding. For the
moment Reynell fully entered into Christian's feelings. How was he
to leave this young thing who loved him?</p>

<p>'Lola, what did the Captain say when he spoke to you just now?
Quick, my child, quick.'</p>

<p>He spoke in the soft Tahitian tongue. She answered, looking at
him with frank innocent eyes.</p>

<p>'He said I was pretty. He said I had lovely eyes and I must come
on board the <i>Bounty.</i> He will send a boat for me to-night.
Fletcher will be there?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Lola,' said Reynell quickly. Bligh might be acting with the
best intentions, but he suspected him of wanting to show Christian
his wife as a frail thing. 'You must get away to the bush and stay
there, Lola; stay there till Christian comes back. You must not do
what the captain tells you. Christian will be miserable if you
spend a night on board the <i>Bounty</i> and he not there.'</p>

<p>'He will be there,' said the girl, her eyes lighting up. 'He
cannot come ashore at night now.'</p>

<p>'He will not be there. He has gone along the reef. You must see
for yourself it is an utter impossibility that he should be
there.'</p>

<p>The girl's face grew piteous.</p>

<p>'Fletcher'&mdash;he had taken such trouble to make her learn how
to pronounce his harsh name&mdash;'told me I must never go aboard
without him.'</p>

<p>'Certainly not. And you must not disobey the captain. Hide
yourself, Lola. Trust some one to tell you when Christian returns.
Mind, I am his friend, and I tell you for his good. The captain is
not his friend. Hide, Lola, hide,' and, afraid of lingering,
Reynell returned on board, wondering whether he had made the simple
little girl understand his meaning.</p>

<p>Towards evening Bligh gave an order to Heywood.</p>

<p>'Go to that little hut there, Mr. Heywood, and bring me off the
girl you will find there. I promised to send for her this
evening.'</p>

<p>'Is it Mr. Christian's girl you're invitin', sir?' asked
Heywood, in his broad Manx, which was so like Irish.</p>

<p>'I did not ask you who the girl was, Mr. Heywood. I told you to
bring her.'</p>

<p>Heywood's dismay was comical.</p>

<p>'Upon my word, sir,' said he, 'there isn't a sign of her,' and
he gently insinuated that, if his captain's mind was set in that
direction, he could find a dozen girls who would be deeply honoured
by his notice. That particular one, however, was away to the bush.
Her husband was the only person who could wile her back.</p>

<p>'Her husband?' questioned Bligh, as if surprised.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian, sir.' There was a little twinkle in Heywood's
eye. Bligh caught him by the shoulder and shook him angrily.</p>

<p>'You are all mad, crew and officers alike! You'll be telling me
you have a wife next.'</p>

<p>'Sure, sir,' said Heywood coolly, 'I'm a general lover. But
there's some of the lads have fixed thimselves up pretty
tight.'</p>

<p>Bligh looked furious.</p>

<p>'Bless you, sir, tops'le sheets'll work a wondrous cure.'</p>

<p>'You be hanged for an impudent young scamp,' said Bligh
recovering himself, 'blessing your betters. Come now, has this girl
any relations?'</p>

<p>'Lashings of 'em. There's her brother, that gossoon on the rock
there.'</p>

<p>A boy of fourteen was sitting idly fishing.</p>

<p>'Fetch him here.'</p>

<p>Heywood was glad to be given something he really could do.</p>

<p>In a very short time the lad was on deck, smiling all over his
face, for he had never been here before that some good had not come
to him.</p>

<p>This time Bligh frowned at him.</p>

<p>'Where is your sister?' he asked harshly.</p>

<p>'Master of men,' said the boy softly, 'I don't know. She has
doubtless gone to the bush till her husband returns.'</p>

<p>'But where is she?'</p>

<p>'Leader of men, I do not know.' The boy held out a deprecating
hand.</p>

<p>'Oh, you don't know, don't you? We'll arrange that. McKoy, bring
a lashing here.'</p>

<p>'Sir, sir,' protested the master, the only man who dared to
speak, 'in all probability the lad speaks the truth. If you will
pardon me reminding you, yourself taught us the necessity for being
on friendly terms with the natives.'</p>

<p>'The necessity is nearly over,' said Bligh curtly. 'The
breadfruit is all on board. I will not be defied. McKoy, trice me
up this lad and use the rope's-end on him when I tell you. Now, my
lad,' he said again in Tahitian, 'where is your sister?'</p>

<p>The boy cast an imploring glance round. He wrestled with the
bonds that bound his wrists.</p>

<p>'Leader of men,' he wailed, 'I do not know.'</p>

<p>Bligh made a sign.</p>

<p>McKoy stood with the rope's-end raised in the air. At his sign
down it came on the brown young back, raising a broad weal.</p>

<p>Frankly, the South Sea Islanders are pleasure lovers, basking in
eternal sunshine. The boy was no Stoic. He gave a long wailing
cry.</p>

<p>There was dismay among the onlookers, for the great majority had
allied themselves with these people.</p>

<p>But it takes a good deal to make men oppose a man who holds the
power of life and death, from whose decision only open rebellion
can save them.</p>

<p>Reynell sought the surgeon, whom, unluckily, he could not find
at first.</p>

<p>'Where is your sister?' asked Bligh again, calm and
judicial.</p>

<p>The lad writhed.</p>

<p>'Leader of men, I do not know. She has gone to the bush.'</p>

<p>Bligh lifted his hand. Down came the rope's end again. Another
weal. The boy screamed.</p>

<p>The same question brought the same answer mingled with wild
prayer for mercy.</p>

<p>So the little tragedy went on till the boy's wails sank to low
moans.</p>

<p>Bligh looked on calmly. It was nothing to him that the crew were
wrathful. He was pleased to show his authority.</p>

<p>The boy's back was all raw before Reynell came back with the
surgeon, Mr. Ledward.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the boy and caught McKoy's arm upraised for
another blow.</p>

<p>'If you do not wish to kill him, sir, he has had enough.'</p>

<p>Bligh laughed.</p>

<p>'See he's put ashore, Mr. Stewart. His sister will have
something to do making a salve for a sore back. They will all learn
it is not well to defy William Bligh.'</p>

<p>He went below to his own cabin.</p>

<p>With his going tongues were loosened. Officers and men, even the
staid old master, joined in the universal disapprobation. The
surgeon had the boy cut free and called for some one to run to his
cabin for restoratives. McKoy, who had delivered the lashes,
scratched his head ruefully.</p>

<p>'A' give it un mild, a' did. A' sutinly laid it on mild.'</p>

<p>'If you hadn't, man,' said the surgeon, 'he certainly would be
dead. These islanders can't stand much. Carry him below, and we'll
see what can be done.'</p>

<p>When the surgeon had done what he could for him, Reynell put the
boy in his own hammock. The crew came and sympathized, making
little offerings, and disclaiming, each for himself, all part and
parcel in the captain's cruelty.</p>

<p>The boy looked round him with wide, wondering eyes. His back
pained him; he felt sick and ill; this was the work of the white
man whom he had trusted. Yet these others were kind. It was more
than his simple, untutored mind could understand. He closed his
eyes wearily.</p>

<p>Charles Stewart, looking at him, shook his head.</p>

<p>'Is he much hurt, Reynell? Will he get over it?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Ledward says he will, sir.'</p>

<p>'It's a bad business. Upon my word it's a bad business. How the
devil Bligh comes to be such a fool passes me! Why, more than three
quarters of us are only too anxious to stop here as it is. If it
comes to a row&mdash;or if they depart for the
woods&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They can't do much without a leader, sir,' said Reynell, daring
since Stewart spoke so openly. 'I'm afraid, though, of what Mr.
Christian will say. And do. He will imagine all sorts of insults
were intended for his wife, and if any one insults his
wife&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He really thought Christian would kill Bligh.</p>

<p>'Oh, Christian!' Stewart gave a long whistle. 'Christian will
raise Cain. And he will be back to-morrow night.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'Boast not thyself of to-morrow for
thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Bligh was excited in his dour way. The last hundred breadfruit
trees were being brought aboard. He had sacrificed the comfort of
the whole ship's company, but not another one could he have stowed.
Still fifteen hundred! He might count surely on at least half
surviving. If only a quarter got through&mdash;&mdash;Once he got
them to Jamaica he had little doubt but all would be well.</p>

<p>Now the great thing was speed. He was hustling the men. He felt
they, too, should understand the importance of the matter in
hand.</p>

<p>'Gardener,' he said, 'we want a few stays.'</p>

<p>'A few more sticks wouldn't come amiss&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The gardener stopped as the master came down the companionway.
He was a middle-aged man, older than Bligh, whom he held in some
awe.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he reported a little anxiously, 'a couple of men,
Muspratt and Churchill, got away with the cutter.'</p>

<p>Bligh looked thunder. The pacific master quailed.</p>

<p>'And what was the master doing, may I ask, to permit such a
thing?'</p>

<p>'I was arranging a place for the trees,' he said deprecatingly.
'By your orders the chest of arms was left in the gangway there to
make room. They took it.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you can send after them,' very curtly.</p>

<p>'Mr. Stewart has just brought them in, sir. I felt it my duty to
report to you.'</p>

<p>'You did get as far as that, did you? Well, I'll attend to
Messrs Muspratt and Churchill to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Bligh went on deck. He was troubled. But he did not say so. He
had been too lax with the men. This should be mended.</p>

<p>On deck Reynell was coiling down a rope end.</p>

<p>'Tell Mr. Heywood I want him.'</p>

<p>Heywood appeared.</p>

<p>'Mr. Heywood, take a boat's crew ashore and fetch me a few stout
sticks for stays. There's an empty hut over there. Just pull that
down and bring me the timber.'</p>

<p>Heywood rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian's hut, sir?'</p>

<p>Bligh laughed and his laugh was not pleasant.</p>

<p>'You yourself assured me it was empty last night.'</p>

<p>Heywood still looked troubled.</p>

<p>'We are off in less than a week,' Bligh explained elaborately,
and when Bligh explained there was trouble in the air, 'Mr.
Christian will not be wanting a hut any longer. No more shore
leave. Mr. Heywood,' he rapped out sharply, 'do you intend to obey
me? If I choose to pull down an empty hut I shall.'</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>'Quartermaster,' called Heywood to Reynell.</p>

<p>They got together a crew and made for the hut. Heywood stepped
inside and told the men to take out anything that seemed of
value.</p>

<p>Before they were half through their work of salvage there came a
hail from the ship telling them not to be all night over the
job.</p>

<p>Heywood looked ruefully at his quartermaster.</p>

<p>''Tisn't any fault of yours, sir,' Reynell comforted him. 'Mr.
Christian'll know you did your best. Look lively now, men.'</p>

<p>They levelled the little house to the ground in less than five
minutes.</p>

<p>It was dark when Christian got aboard from his trip. His request
to go ashore was curtly refused, so it was not till morning that he
saw the destruction of his property. He turned angrily and went
straight for Bligh's cabin. Reynell made bold to stop him.</p>

<p>'Sir, sir, is it your hut you're thinking about?'</p>

<p>'My hut! My home, you mean, Reynell! I must go ashore at once.
Where&mdash;&mdash;! How&mdash;&mdash;!'</p>

<p>'Your wife is all right, sir. Upon my honour I believe she is
all right. She's away to the bush. The hut was empty and the
captain had it pulled down for stays.'</p>

<p>'He knew it was mine,' said Christian. 'The whole ship knew it
was mine. It is a piece of wanton destruction to spite me.'</p>

<p>'Never mind,' said Charles Stewart's soothing voice, 'you'll be
even with him before you're done. Let it go now, old man, let it
go.'</p>

<p>He took Christian by the arm and walked him below, evidently
putting as good a face upon things as he could. But there was yet
the beating of the boy and the driving away of Christian's wife to
be explained.</p>

<p>The ship seemed to be in a state of suppressed ferment.</p>

<p>Bligh had been anxious at first that his crew should be on
friendly relations, should even form ties with the islanders; now
he seemed as anxious to show his scorn for those ties. Reynell
would have given a great deal to have the <i>Bounty</i> a week away
from Tahiti and all well with her.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Christian got ashore.</p>

<p>The whole ship waited for his coming back. But the sun went down
and it was well on into the night before he came.</p>

<p>The deck was in darkness, the moon had not yet risen, only the
lantern at the companion showed a dim light. As its rays fell on
Fletcher Christian's face, Reynell, lounging on deck, saw that it
was dark with passion.</p>

<p>Straight to Bligh's cabin he went. Reynell heard voices raised
in anger. He expected next a call for a file of marines to put Mr.
Christian under arrest. Would it be the signal for a general
mutiny, for all the ship sympathized with Christian?</p>

<p>Perhaps Bligh understood that, for the order never came.</p>

<p>Christian came out, went down the ship's side without a word to
any one, into a native canoe that was waiting, and back to the
shore again. Reynell wondered if he were gone for good.</p>

<p>But no. Next day he came aboard and resumed his duties. Stewart
patted him on the back.</p>

<p>'By Jingo! I thought you'd turned nigger and the <i>Bounty</i>
had lost you!'</p>

<p>'I'm not so sure,' said Christian grimly, 'that she hasn't. It
wouldn't be a bad life here, and Bligh is enough to harry the life
out of a man.'</p>

<p>'You appear to have got the better of him. He don't allow any
one else ashore at night.'</p>

<p>'I told him I'd wreck the whole expedition in revenge for my
wrecked hut unless he let me go my own way.'</p>

<p>'And he didn't send for the jaundy?' asked Stewart amazed.</p>

<p>'He didn't,' said Christian. 'Muspratt and Churchill did me a
good turn, poor beggars. If he's to land those breadfruit trees
safely in Jamaica he'd better go a bit easy.'</p>

<p>Charles Stewart shook his head over things.</p>

<p>'Will we get away, sir?' asked Reynell voicing his anxiety. 'I'd
give ten years of my life to be sure of seeing old England
again.'</p>

<p>'And why shouldn't you see it?'</p>

<p>'I hope I shall, sir. But there's something unrestful in the
air. I wish the Captain had let Mr. Christian's wife alone.'</p>

<p>'And her brother. And her hut. He's not over kind, but as a rule
he's not wanton.'</p>

<p>'He had to show his power,' hazarded Reynell. It was to his mind
the only explanation of Bligh's conduct.</p>

<p>'He must have been possessed to meddle with Christian,' opined
Stewart.</p>

<p>'I assure you it isn't wise to meddle with Christian,' said that
gentleman laughing grimly. 'The meddler generally comes off
worst.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Stewart, 'I'd as soon touch a hedgehog with his
prickles out.'</p>

<p>Christian smiled. He was grave as a man who has made up his mind
to a momentous step. But he was not unhappy about it.</p>

<p>'I shall tell you, Stewart,' he went on, 'and you, too, Reynell,
because you have both been sympathetic and friendly. I shall give
messages to you both to deliver in England. I have a brother and
sister there. I don't want them to think I've forgotten them.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;&mdash;' Stewart and Reynell spoke in a breath.</p>

<p>Christian held up his hand.</p>

<p>'No, I shan't be there as soon as you will. I had it out with
Bligh the other night. It was very nearly all over with him. I let
him off on one condition.'</p>

<p>Stewart stared at him. Reynell was not so very much surprised.
He had seen Christian come up that night.</p>

<p>'That you should stay behind,' he asked. 'You'd surely never be
so foolish. Your prospects&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My prospects pretty well wrecked themselves, I should say, when
I held that knife to Bligh's throat. He takes it coolly here
because he's bound to, but once in English waters I wouldn't give
much for my prospects in the navy. The
alternative&mdash;is&mdash;ah well, it's worth it.'</p>

<p>'Don't,' implored Stewart, 'don't. You are ruining your
life.'</p>

<p>'Gaining it! Gaining it! Stewart, I've never in my life been so
happy as I've been the last six months.'</p>

<p>'It won't last. You're like a god to these people now, but by
and by&mdash;when the ship is gone&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'll chance it,' said Christian, leaning over the side and
hailing a canoe that had been waiting for that hail, for he meant
to spend the night ashore as usual.</p>

<p>'Reynell, keep a quiet tongue in your head,' warned Stewart
anxiously. 'It won't do to let the rest of the men get wind of
this. I don't know what'll be the end of it.'</p>

<p>'The mischief is,' said Reynell, 'that half the crew would give
their eyes to do the same.'</p>

<p>There was no way to alter things.</p>

<p>The preparation for departure went on apace. The men were sullen
and discontented. Bligh, noticing it, said to his officers that
that was to be expected after so long a spell of freedom ashore.
Blue water would cure it.</p>

<p>At last the fateful 4th of April dawned, bright and sunny. They
expected nothing else of the weather in that part of the world.
Little by little, Christian had taken most of his things ashore,
until now his little cabin was bare and empty. He wrote two
letters, and gave one to Stewart and one to Reynell.</p>

<p>'So if one don't reach old England, the other will,' he said.
'I'm keen on them getting those letters.'</p>

<p>'And you're going to-day,'said Stewart. 'You're really sure
you're going to-day. It's so unlike Bligh.'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said Christian, 'but I had my knife at his
throat.'</p>

<p>'Still he has something up his sleeve for you, I warrant.'</p>

<p>'Ah, man, you're thinking of the navy and promotion. I have cut
all that. I am going to be a naked savage. Perhaps he thinks I will
find that punishment enough.'</p>

<p>'So you will,' said Reynell sombrely.</p>

<p>Christian laughed, and beckoned to a canoe that was close in
shore in which was the girl Lola, his wife.</p>

<p>On board all was bustle. The men were shortening in. Round the
ship was a fleet of canoes filled with weeping women. They might
not mourn long, these light-hearted islanders, but they were
mourning most sincerely. Only the stern commands of Bligh and his
officers kept the men from running every moment to the ship's side
to look over and shout tender words in answer to the loving ones
that in a soft language were shouted at them.</p>

<p>'Sail loosers 'way aloft,' came the order. The pipes of the
bo'sun's mate sounded shrilly across the harbour.</p>

<p>'The anchor's away, sir,' came the cry from for'ard.</p>

<p>Slowly the ship paid off, heading towards the passage in the
reef. As the men tramped round the capstan their shanty rose sadly
on the air for all they were homeward bound and it should have been
a cheerful song.</p>

<p><i>'For, oh I never will forget ye.'</i>
</p>

<p><i>'Tofa my phalangi, tofa so e tua,'</i> responded the people
in the canoes, setting their own words to the air, words that said
that the strangers, the white men whom they loved, were leaving
them, and they were desolate.</p>

<p>As the anchor rose Christian stepped forward and prepared to
slip over the side. It had been agreed he should not leave till the
very last moment. He would just drop down quietly into the canoe
that was waiting for him; Lola's canoe. In the bustle he reckoned
that no one would notice him, or if they did, it would be too late
to follow his example.</p>

<p>He had his hand on the rail when the master-at-arms and a couple
of sailors appeared beside him.</p>

<p>'Cap'en's orders, sir. He says you'm agoin' to desert.'</p>

<p>For one moment Christian was speechless with dismay. Bligh had
had the last word, as Stewart had said he would. It was checkmate.
He was losing everything.</p>

<p>Then he fought madly.</p>

<p>But the master-at-arms called another man to his aid. It took
but a moment to overpower him.</p>

<p>The anchor was up. The breeze had filled the sails. The
<i>Bounty</i> was forging ahead through the water at a rate that
threatened quickly to leave all the canoes behind. They would have
dragged Christian below but he, remembering that Lola would think
he had purposely deceived her, begged and prayed them to let him
stay on deck. Gladly enough would they have deserted themselves,
but they saw no reason why he should have what they were denied, so
they held him, a sailor on each arm, the master-at-arms behind him.
He could look over at the receding land, while those in the canoes
must see he was a prisoner.</p>

<p>He saw only the little brown canoe with the outrigger, and the
girl in it, with her frightened, anxious face turned towards the
ship that was fast going out to sea.</p>

<p>'My love, my dear, my wife,' he cried, 'they are taking me by
force. I will come back. Fear not, I will come back. Trust me I
will come!'</p>

<p>'Master-at-arms,' called Bligh, a curious note of triumph in his
voice, 'take the prisoner below, and set a sentry at his door.'</p>

<p>The sails were full now, the <i>Bounty</i> looked like a great
white bird tearing her way through the water. Daniel Reynell's
heart swelled with thankfulness. Half his probation was over. He
was homeward bound. Loveday Corthew would be waiting for him.</p>

<p>They dragged Fletcher Christian past him.</p>

<p>'I told you, I told you,' said Stewart. 'I knew that Bligh would
never let him stop. Now he has lost promotion and everything.'</p>

<p>'I have not lost everything,' shouted Christian, as if he
guessed what they were thinking, 'not yet. I am not the only one
that wants to stay behind.'</p>

<p>Bligh broke in angrily, asking if they were going to be all day
over the job. The little party reached the gangway and disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'For to him that is joined to all the

for a living dog is better than a dead lion.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>It was the custom, I believe, at the end of the eighteenth
century, or, at any rate, it was a very general practice after a
prisoner had been declared guilty, for the judge to inflict the
very highest penalty allowed by the law. Afterwards they might
consider a little mercy.</p>

<p>The law in those days was a fierce thing. Since the death
penalty could be, and was, inflicted for stealing from the person
anything over a shilling in value, the woman who stole a valuable
horse might be considered to have well earned it. Perhaps, in any
case, it would not have been carried out.</p>

<p>Luckily for Joan, the young barrister who had defended her and
the older man who had prosecuted for the Crown, were both so struck
by her beauty that they came together and talked the case over.</p>

<p>Dick Penrhyn's wife, too, was properly shocked. She was a pious
woman, and, though she thought it very wicked indeed to have killed
the mare, she could not bear to think that the blood of a girl she
had known would be on her husband's head.</p>

<p>She stopped the two men as they were walking down the
street.</p>

<p>'You'uns,' and she looked pointedly at the junior, 'done she to
death. Her ah had a mortal fright. Couldn't you 'uns beg she
off?'</p>

<p>'That's an idea,' said the junior with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'Years of imprisonment, that's the alternative,' mused the
elder, 'her youth and that strange beauty gone. 'Pon my word I'd
rather be dead.'</p>

<p>But then, of course, it wasn't he who was sentenced to be hanged
by the neck till he was dead. He might have held a different
opinion if it had been.</p>

<p>'There's transportation,' said the junior thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'I dunno,' said Mrs. Penrhyn, 'as it ud be a bad thing for Joan
to put the world atween she an' that good for naught mother of
hers.'</p>

<p>The two men laughed.</p>

<p>'Well, if we get her off,' said the Crown Prosecutor, 'will you
get her a few little comforts for the voyage?'</p>

<p>'Iss, iss, sure,' then more cautiously, 'a'm a poor woman an' my
man, he's a bit tight fisted, but a'll do best a' can.'</p>

<p>'Get her off,' said the junior counsel looking at his elder,
'and I'll gladly provide her with some clothes and necessaries
myself.'</p>

<p>So it came that after long days in the condemned cell that made
her feel she had died a thousand deaths, and left her numb and
broken, Mrs. Treherne came to Joan at last.</p>

<p>She was lying on her pallet staring at a faint ray of watery
sunshine that found its way through the Judas hole in the door, and
she was saying to herself that she supposed she would not see many
more rays of sunshine. It behoved her to make the most of it. Yet
how could she when day and night she was thinking that she would be
choked to death&mdash;for a crime of which she felt herself
entirely innocent. Just because Dick Penrhyn had not been
reasonable she must die&mdash;and die horribly.</p>

<p>'Get up, Joan. I've good news for 'ee. Well,
maybe&mdash;&mdash;' the woman hesitated.</p>

<p>Joan got up wearily. She was a brave woman, ashamed to be found
bewailing herself.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she asked. 'Will they shoot I? 'Twould be
easier.'</p>

<p>'A' has na to die,' said Mrs. Treherne, sitting down on the
pallet and letting herself go with a sob. It was no little thing,
she found, to tell a girl she was reprieved. Joan put out her hands
blindly and caught the woman's. She could not speak and she would
not cry out.</p>

<p>'There! There! Poor maid! Poor maid! An' long years of jail
afore ye.'</p>

<p>But Joan did not think of that for the moment. The
rope&mdash;the horror she had dreaded so unspeakably had been taken
away! She looked at the woman, afraid to believe so great a good
had come to her. Then, seeing her jailer's face, she slipped to her
knees and sobbed out her gratitude in that dirty lap. Mrs. Treherne
had had naught to do with the reprieve, but she liked the
gratitude. It made her take an interest in the girl though, to her,
her future looked terribly dark.</p>

<p>Then there came a present for Joan, money to buy a dress,
underclothes, everything a girl could need, with a request that the
dress should be blue.</p>

<p>It was the sentimental junior who desired to see the girl he had
been instrumental in saving, and who did not wish the picture to be
spoiled by the sight of her bedraggled and dirty as he knew only
too well weeks of jail in those days was bound to make her.</p>

<p>The jailer's wife did her best, though she shook her head over
what she thought Joan's future was likely to be. After all, her own
life had been no bed of roses, who was she to deprive the girl of
any scrap of pleasure that was likely to come her way. Besides,
things might be made profitable for Susan Treherne.</p>

<p>When a fortnight later, the junior counsel, after a little
struggle with himself, and quite against his better judgment, made
a special journey to Plymouth just to see her, Mrs. Treherne smiled
a knowing smile, and saw that the girl was clean and neat, and
dressed in the new clothes when she was sent in to see him.</p>

<p>Joan counted him her saviour. A fortnight's freedom from the
shadow of the gallows had brought back the clear pallor to her
cheeks, the colour to her lips, and the brightness to her eyes. It
was a stately, good-looking young woman who stood before him,
thanking him gravely and with desperate gratitude for all he had
done for her.</p>

<p>The grace and charm of this daughter of the people took his
breath away. Her voice, though she spoke broadest dialect, was
rich, low and melodious. He could not know that it was his own
manner and that of the judge who had condemned her, that reminded
her of the dignity that was her father's, and that, she realised,
was so much better a thing than the noisy manners of the tavern
where she had spent the last six years of her life. Not that she
had ever been noisy except when she let herself go in furious
anger. She had taken refuge in a sullen silence.</p>

<p>'It is long years for you,' said the junior counsel regretfully,
'unless&mdash;&mdash;' he paused.</p>

<p>''Tis better than hangin',' said Joan with a shudder, 'an' when
a' had no mind to steal mare&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There's no good going into that,' he said hastily. What a sin
it was this stately young woman should be soiled and smirched by a
life in jail. Was it possible&mdash;transportation&mdash;&mdash;But
the American colonies had been lost to England; Jamaica and
Barbadoes no longer needed white bond-women, having their wants in
that direction supplied by West Africa. They were sending convicts
to Captain Cook's land in the South Seas. It was a sin to send so
handsome a girl so far away. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He conquered his own desires, like the decent fellow he was. He
knew very well he would never marry a woman of the people and a
jailbird at that. Some other man would take her, he supposed, but
the sin should not be on his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Joan, you would not like to go to the South Seas?'</p>

<p>He was amazed at the light that sprang into the girl's sea blue
eyes. Her whole face glowed with hope and delight. He felt for a
moment he could not let this lovely woman go out of his life. There
were ways&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'A'd be main glad&mdash;I would like to go to the South Seas,'
she said, trying to model her speech on his.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell had gone to the South Seas!</p>

<p>In these days of swift communication, when the world is open to
every one, many speak of Australia as if it were all comprised in a
ring fence, and people bound to Port Darwin and Hobart are within
visiting distance. What wonder, then, if an ignorant girl whose
only ideas of geography had been imparted by the nuns at the
convent school at Cadiz, should think that here would lie her
chance of meeting the one man in the world for her. The one man
still! This good-looking young fellow, before whom she was willing
to abase herself in gratitude, could never be anything but a means
to an end. Hope was born again. If this man would help her to go to
the South Seas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Away from all your friends? Never to see them again perhaps?
Wouldn't you rather stay in England, Joan? I think
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have no friends,' said Joan speaking deliberately, to try and
get her words right, just as this man spoke them. 'None had been
good to me but you and Mistress Treherne.'</p>

<p>'So you think I have been good to you?'</p>

<p>'You have been very good to me,' said Joan gravely, 'I ha' no
words to thank 'ee.' She made a little curtsey, and the deep grave
eyes looked straight into his.</p>

<p>He sighed because he thought he was being a fool.</p>

<p>'Well, Joan, we must try and make it as easy for you as
possible. Now be a good girl, don't despair, and I'll do all I can
to make the voyage smooth and the landing comfortable for you. If
you're grateful, to me you may put up a little prayer occasionally
that I find a wife as beautiful as you.'</p>

<p>He drew her towards him, looked gravely into her face&mdash;she
was tall as he&mdash;and he, though no giant, was above the medium
height&mdash;and drew her towards him. He stood so a moment, his
hands on her shoulders. And it was his heart that beat to
suffocation. He put a very grave kiss on her forehead and let her
go.</p>

<p>Joan walked on air back to the fetid ward. So&mdash;he thought
her beautiful, this good-looking young man&mdash;he had treated her
with courtesy&mdash;he had kissed her. She was to go to the South
Seas&mdash;to begin a new life&mdash;and&mdash;hope whispered
it&mdash;she did not know how utterly improbable it was&mdash;she
might meet Daniel Reynell there.</p>

<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'All things come alike to all:<br>
there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked;<br>
to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;<br>
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not;<br>
as is the good, so is the sinner.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Not till they were well out of Tahitian waters and the islands,
and the lotus-eating life was becoming, it seemed, a mere memory,
did Bligh release Christian and send for him to his cabin.</p>

<p>Christian, entering, found his captain sitting at the table with
a pistol beside him.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Christian, are you prepared to admit I have won in
the little game?'</p>

<p>Christian hesitated.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' he spoke coldly, bitterly&mdash;'but you will also
admit, I suppose, you hardly played fair. I was to desert at the
last moment, you will remember.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. You were good enough to inform me of your intention
with your knife at my throat, you will remember. We also agreed to
let things take their natural course. The natural course was for me
to have all ready to insure proper discipline on board my ship.
Checkmate, Mr. Christian, checkmate.'</p>

<p>Christian manifestly only kept himself under control with an
effort.</p>

<p>Bligh went on.</p>

<p>'Now, Mr. Christian, you are a good officer, an excellent
officer. I need excellent officers. We will let bygones be bygones.
You must admit you assaulted me in a manner which,&mdash;well, upon
my word, I have seen men hanged for much less. On my part I will
admit that possibly I was a little hard on you. That was for your
own good, Mr. Christian, entirely for your own good. Six months
hence you will thank me for my conduct. Long before you are my age
you will feel that you cannot be grateful enough. Now, Mr.
Christian, you may go back to your duty.'</p>

<p>'And a lucky dog you may think yourself,' was Stewart's comment.
'He's got some guts, Bligh, after all.'</p>

<p>'Do you think he means it?' asked Christian.</p>

<p>'Why, yes. Why shouldn't he?'</p>

<p>'Because he is not the man to forgive that knife. Oh, no, he
will not log it because it won't read well if he tells the truth.
But he will never forgive me all the same.'</p>

<p>Still, he seemed not only to have forgiven but to have entirely
forgotten. He allowed Christian to resume his position as head of
the third watch. He even asked him to dinner, and as a man who had
lived for the past six months under their shadow, he consulted him
about the precious breadfruit trees. The unfortunate episodes of
the last days at Tahiti seemed to be entirely blotted out.</p>

<p>The change was in Christian.</p>

<p>Reynell, of whom from the very first he had made something of a
friend, could not but notice it. He was irritable and bad tempered.
That might be set down to his grief for the girl he had left behind
him. It was only natural. But in another way he had changed too. He
had made a friend of Reynell when he was only a leading seaman. But
then Reynell was a man of some education. So far out of the world
as they were, it was excusable that a man should take a companion
where he could find him. With the rest of the crew he had preserved
the distance expected from an officer.</p>

<p>Now that was changed.</p>

<p>Reynell noted, uneasily, that Christian seemed to be on the
friendliest and most intimate terms with Muspratt and all the
discontented spirits on board. So troubled was he, he even went so
far as to point it out to Stewart.</p>

<p>That young man laughed.</p>

<p>'Poor beggar! He's got it bad, very bad! We all of us felt the
parting a wrench, but on the whole I shouldn't, myself, fly to
William Muspratt for distraction and consolation. Still we all of
us take things differently. And time cures all things we're told.
We're getting on. More than three weeks out, Reynell. Some of us
are beginning to wonder what the Jamaican girls are like.'</p>

<p>As a matter of miles, they were really not so very far from
Tahiti. Calms and contrary winds had delayed them.</p>

<p>The work of the ship went on quietly. The iron discipline of a
man of war was never for a moment relaxed, though the cabin was
full of young breadfruit trees. The men seemed to be settling down
far better than Reynell had dared hope, seeing the freedom they had
enjoyed for the last six months.</p>

<p>As the 27th April drew to a close, and the light breeze was
dying with the daylight, Bligh beckoned Reynell.</p>

<p>'Quartermaster, give my compliments to Mr. Christian, and tell
him I expect him to sup with me.'</p>

<p>'Tell him to go to hell,' was Christian's comment when the
message was delivered.</p>

<p>'I can't very well take that for an answer,' said Reynell
uneasily, 'can I, sir?'</p>

<p>'Say what you please. I'm not going. I'm turning in.' Christian
moodily shut the door of his cabin.</p>

<p>So he was still mourning the girl in Tahiti. Because they were
well on their way home Reynell felt a certain measure of
sympathy.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian's compliments,' he reported to Bligh, 'he regrets
very much he is too unwell to come to supper.'</p>

<p>'What! Sick! What are these young men coming to! I'd have had to
be dying when I was a youngster before I refused an invitation from
my captain.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian has turned in, sir,' ventured Reynell. 'He looked
very sick,' was the way he translated Christian's moody face.</p>

<p>'Lovesick, I suppose, you mean, eh, Reynell?' said Bligh with a
little twinkle in his eyes. 'Hasn't he got over that yet?' Bligh
liked Reynell, and when they were entirely alone sometimes relaxed
with him. Reynell, in his turn, liked Bligh, in spite of his
brutality on occasion. He was so capable a man, so efficient, he
felt he could forgive him his many sins.</p>

<p>'It was a bad case, sir. But top s'le sheets, they
say&mdash;and&mdash;every day&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not quite as far as I could wish, Reynell,' said the commander.
'Still we are getting on. That young man will live to know I'm
right. But he isn't taking his medicine quite as I'd like.'</p>

<p>The wind was light, and died away altogether as, in purple and
gold, the sun sank into the sea. It was still and calm. There
wasn't a ripple on the waters. A long line of golden light
stretched up to the moon in her first quarter. She hung, a golden
crescent, in the Western sky. Reynell lay in the shadow of the
cook-house. It was his watch below, but the fo'c'sle was a
stifling, noisome place, unbearable in the tropics. In the pleasant
warmth he could sleep quite comfortably on deck.</p>

<p>The gunner had charge of the watch. Reynell, turning over
sleepily, saw him walking up and down the poop. The moonlight
showed him the clean white deck still encumbered with some of the
yams and other produce brought from Tahiti, for there was no room
below. He heard voices, someone talking in the cook-house; but he
did not hear what they were saying, he did not want to hear; only
the subdued voices mingled pleasantly with the sob of the waters
against the ship's sides, and the sound of the sails idly flapping
against the masts.</p>

<p>Then a voice was raised emphatically. The words fell distinctly
on his ears.</p>

<p>'We must do it to-night, Muspratt. Once we get a strong wind
she'll walk. Then every hour'll take us farther and farther
away.'</p>

<p>The voice was the voice of Fletcher Christian. Reynell had
supposed Christian in his berth. Not ill, of course, but a man does
not openly flaunt his disrespect for his commanding officer
whatever he may feel. Yet here he was talking to Muspratt, one of
the most notoriously discontented spirits on board.</p>

<p>'It's a ticklish job, a mighty ticklish job,' said the man
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'It's quite easy once we make up our minds to go through with
it. I tell you we're not far off as the crow flies. Is there a
sentry at Bligh's door?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'And Churchill understands he's to be ready the moment eight
bells strike?'</p>

<p>He was listening to some conspiracy. And Christian was in it.
For the moment that was the only thing Reynell grasped. Christian
was in it! If he had only given himself a moment to think he would
have kept quiet and gone on sleeping as the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p>If this was a conspiracy that would be the simplest way to
thwart it. But Christian had always been his friend. It seemed only
natural to remonstrate with him. In a moment he was in the
cook-house.</p>

<p>'Good Lord!' cried Christian startled.</p>

<p>The other man with an oath drew a knife.</p>

<p>'Dead cocks can't crow,' said he.</p>

<p>Christian pushed it aside.</p>

<p>'Why, man, Reynell's a pressed man! Bligh's only just given him
back his name and they're stealing half his pay. He's much more
likely to be with us than against us.'</p>

<p>'What are you up to?' asked Reynell, only half mollified. Was it
mutiny? Christian hated Bligh. He would stick at nothing.</p>

<p>'Well, it's a treasonable matter,' said Christian. 'If I didn't
count you a friend, Reynell, I'd be like Muspratt here, looking for
some way to stop your mouth.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm your friend. You ought to know that. But we're homeward
bound now, and half my time's worked off. I wouldn't for the
world,' he added, afraid of he hardly knew what, 'join you in
anything that would delay for a moment my home-coming.'</p>

<p>'I told you,' grumbled Muspratt, 'he'll wreck it.'</p>

<p>Still Christian checked him.</p>

<p>'You reckon that Bligh'll get you home quicker than any man. I'm
not saying he won't. But you must know that the same thing that
makes you want to go makes me and my mates want to stay here.'
Reynell felt it strangely unnatural that Christian should speak of
Muspratt and his lot as 'my mates.' 'Bligh broke his word and
baulked me. By heaven he shan't have the chance again. Now, Reynell
if you're thinking about betraying us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Reynell felt that in that case his friendship with Christian
would be a thing of naught. Still there were limits.</p>

<p>'You're not thinking about destroying the seaworthiness of the
ship?' he asked. Why had he barged in? He could not make up his
mind what he ought to do now. It was almost his duty to have lain
still and listened.</p>

<p>'Good Lord! No. The last thing I'd dream of. Ships like this are
mighty useful in these seas, and not over plentiful.' He laughed,
but there was something uncomfortable in his laughter. 'Half a
dozen of us, you can guess who, can't stand the life. We're going
to steal the long boat and clear to-night. We've squared the
gunner. You'd better sleep and know nothing about it. We're going,
if we die for it.'</p>

<p>'It's the maddest thing I ever heard of,' remonstrated Reynell.
'If you'd done it three weeks ago there might have been some sense
in it. Why, you'll never fetch Tahiti!'</p>

<p>'You bet we know what we're about! Now, Reynell, go quietly to
your hammock, unless you like to join us.'</p>

<p>'You know I won't join you,' said Reynell roughly. 'I ought to
tell the Captain.'</p>

<p>In truth he was troubled. For he liked his first friend on
board, owed him much and had no mind to embroil him further with
Bligh.</p>

<p>'If you've got another weasand you may,' threatened
Muspratt.</p>

<p>Christian laid a not unkindly hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Now, like a good fellow, go down and turn in. There'll be row
enough by and by. Best let things take their course. I've sworn
back to England Bligh shall not take me, and I'm keeping my
word.'</p>

<p>'Will you leave enough men to man the ship?'</p>

<p>'Oh, sure! Most of the ship's company, I'll swear.'</p>

<p>'I should think so. It's a mad venture.'</p>

<p>Christian laughed. 'Not so mad, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'If I sleep like the dead will you promise to do things quietly?
Muspratt is too ready with his knife. He'll be a drawback in your
Eden, I'm thinking.'</p>

<p>Christian was suddenly gloomy.</p>

<p>'We can't have all we want in this world. Bligh should have let
me go when he promised. I'm bound to go back. I promised Lola, and
I keep my promises, whatever Bligh may do.'</p>

<p>'Pray God you don't repent,' said Reynell. 'But I feel that
Bligh was right. Give it up, man, give it up. The worst is over
now.'</p>

<p>'The worst isn't over. Good-bye, Reynell, sleep like the
dead.'</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell saw that remonstrance was useless. Here was a
young man wrecking his life. Even if he betrayed him to
Bligh&mdash;if he could betray him which would not be
easy&mdash;matters would not be mended. He held out his hand to
Christian. Christian apparently did not see it.</p>

<p>'Get on, man, to your hammock,' he said somewhat roughly, 'and
good luck to you. Remember I gave you the chance to join us.'</p>

<p>Reynell tumbled into his hammock in the hot and fetid
fo'c'sle.</p>

<p>But he could not sleep, much as he desired to do so. There was a
dim light swinging from the deck above. He could see John Norton,
one of the quartermasters, snoring in the next hammock, and the
light fell full on Robert Tinkler's sleeping face. Several of the
hammocks were empty. Quite likely their owners, as he himself had
done, thought the fo'c'sle too stifling on a night like this.</p>

<p>As eight bells struck he saw the master-at-arms go to the
hammock of a gunner's mate. He roused out John Mills. The pair went
quietly on deck. It was Christian's watch now. Reynell listened
intently.</p>

<p>How were they to launch the boat? Who was going to keep Bligh in
his cabin while they brought the ship to?</p>

<p>He was half minded to go to the cockpit and see what Charles
Stewart thought of the situation. But that would be risky. Perhaps
it was best to know nothing. Asleep in his hammock he could know
nothing. He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>He was desperately anxious. So little would wreck all his hopes.
So long as Christian, with his wild longing after the brown girl,
and Muspratt and Churchill, with their longing for freedom of any
sort, were on board, he felt there was no security that the ship
would ever arrive at her destination. Bligh elected to behave as if
his crew were one contented family. He must know better in his
heart. Something was going to happen. Reynell lay and looked at the
lamp and wondered what.</p>

<p>Time went on. Regularly the good ship rose; regularly she
slipped down again into the trough of the waves; the lamp swayed
backwards and forwards as if it had been worked by machinery; the
hammock swayed, too. It was Reynell's watch on deck. He would have
to plead illness, and Christian's express permission. But the fact
made him uneasy, though the gentle swaying of the ship was like the
rocking of a cradle.</p>

<p>It was so important to him to keep in with Bligh. Should he slip
on deck, disregarding Muspratt's threats?</p>

<p>His doubts were settled by a wild hullabaloo; the sound of many
voices; the grounding of arms; the rush of feet across the deck.
One voice above others rose in protest.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>So he had caught and stopped them. Poor beggars! Reynell went up
the companion ladder. He had to risk things now. It was better
Bligh should find him on deck.</p>

<p>There, instead of confusion reigning, apparently the greatest
order prevailed. The dawn had broken; in the east, lines of gold
were heralding the sunrise. Reynell looked to see Christian between
a couple of seamen with the master-at-arms in charge of him.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on Bligh behind the mizzen, bound, and in his
shirt, with two men armed with muskets standing over him.
Christian, a drawn cutlass in his hand, was shouting orders to
bring the ship to.</p>

<p>For a moment Reynell rubbed his eyes. Surely Christian couldn't
have deceived him. Instinctively he made a step towards Bligh. In a
moment Muspratt's musket was at his breast.</p>

<p>'You move and you're dead meat.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;Mr. Christian&mdash;sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's all right, Reynell,' said Christian kindly enough. 'That
little arrangement I told you of wasn't practicable. We're going
take the ship back. That's best.'</p>

<p>'But,' blurted out Reynell, 'I don't want to go back!'</p>

<p>'Well, that's a little unlucky for you. It's impossible to
please everybody. The majority of us do. However there's an
alternative. Bos'un,' he shouted, 'pipe all hands to get out the
launch.'</p>

<p>The bos'un hesitated. He was an old man with a good record.</p>

<p>'We're not standing on ceremony here,' said Christian bitterly.
'If you don't jump to it, bos'un, you can jump overboard.'</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and a seaman presented his musket ready
cocked at the old man's head.</p>

<p>The bos'un raised his whistle to his lips. Half a dozen seamen
jumped into the boat to clear her away.</p>

<p>The ship came to quietly; the ropes rattled through the blocks;
the launch touched the water.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Christian quietly, 'where are those three lads? Have
you got them?'</p>

<p>Three seamen, with muskets and cutlasses, pushed forward a
couple of the youngest midshipmen and the ship's clerk, Mr.
Samuels. They seemed dazed, as if they did not quite understand
what had happened. Indeed, it was only natural, roused as they had
been from their slumbers in the grey of the morning.</p>

<p>'Will you go back with us, lads?' asked Christian. 'We are going
back to Tahiti. Or will you go with your commander in the boat
there?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian,' remonstrated Bligh, 'this is mutiny. This is a
hanging matter. Samuels, Mr. Hallett, rouse out the master. We will
not give in like this.'</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, sir,' said Christian angrily, 'or you are a
dead man this minute. Men, if he so much as opens his lips you know
what to do. I have warned him twice. I shan't warn him again. Some
of you jump below and fetch up the master and the gunner.'</p>

<p>The master was an old man; the gunner a man in the prime of
life.</p>

<p>The sun had risen now. His golden beams lighted up the decks,
white as holystoning could make them; the masts cast long shadows
for'ard, the air began to be warmed a little, for even in the
tropics here it was a little fresh at night.</p>

<p>'I take it,' said Christian very politely, looking at Mr. Fryer,
the master, 'you prefer to go with your commander.'</p>

<p>The old man said nothing. The gunner said scornfully,</p>

<p>'You don't take it that we want to keep company with gallows
birds, do you?'</p>

<p>Christian waved his hand.</p>

<p>'Into the boat with you. We've made our choice. We none of us
can have exactly what we want in this world. Now then, who else is
below?'</p>

<p>One by one they fetched them up; the surgeon and the botanist,
the cooks and the butcher, Elphinstone, the other master's mate,
and the rest of the crew who would not join the mutineers.</p>

<p>Reynell saw, with a sinking heart, that the best of the men were
staying behind, the old men and the boys kept straight, and those
they had been in the habit of regarding as weaklings. He looked
down at the little launch already crowded and shockingly low in the
water. What chance, what possible chance could that little boat
have of reaching safety? Why, he would not have put out in her so
heavily laden from Polperro to go for Fowey; he would certainly
never have attempted to cross to France in her! Yet here they were
thousands of miles from any place, far, far from all the tracks of
shipping&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Christian,' he burst out, 'this is rank murder!'</p>

<p>Christian frowned.</p>

<p>'The fault is that of those who brought me here. I have wished
myself far enough away, God knows. Now will you join us,
Reynell?'</p>

<p>'Join you,' said Reynell hotly, and he felt as he had felt when
first the <i>Bounty</i> rose to the swell of the Channel and all
hope of rescue was gone, 'join you! When all I want is to get to
England!'</p>

<p>'Step down then,' said Christian pointing to the boat, ''tis the
only craft I know likely to be bound in that direction.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian! It is murder!'</p>

<p>For a moment there came into Christian's eyes a look that made
Reynell think he repented. But, surely, if ever a man had gone too
far he had. He turned away with a sigh.</p>

<p>'I've offered you the alternative. You may stay, Reynell.'</p>

<p>'And turn savage? And never hold up my head again?'</p>

<p>'I have told you you may stay,' said Christian, with a curious
little wistful ring in his voice, 'I've always been friendly to
you, Reynell,' he added.</p>

<p>Reynell looked again at the boat. Should he go below for his few
possessions? But she was gunwale deep already. Everything they
could do without must be left behind. That was evident.</p>

<p>'The first gale,' said Reynell like a man speaking his thoughts
aloud&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>'I have told you you may stay,' but Christian's voice was cold
now. Perhaps he, too, was regretting.</p>

<p>'I'm no mutineer,' said Reynell, and slipped down the rope
without another word.</p>

<p>Trevenick leaned over the side.</p>

<p>'Come on,' said Reynell.</p>

<p>'Old man,' said that laughing young gentleman, grave for once,
'I'm no mutineer either. But it's too big a contract. Since it's a
choice between the girls of Tahiti and a watery
grave&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Christian pushed him away.</p>

<p>'Now, Mr. Bligh,' he said, 'your officers are all in the boat,
will you join them?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian, men,' said Bligh earnestly, 'don't do this
thing. I don't ask you because it is practically murder. How do you
suppose we can all live in a little boat like that, but even for
your own sakes you couldn't do a worse thing. Believe me, there is
no happiness in a life of licence. None. None. Now you have begun
there is no knowing where you will stop. You have deposed me. How
long will you obey Mr. Christian? Whose life will be safe? Men,
come back to your duty, not for my sake but for your own. It is the
best thing you can do. England never forgets. She will seek you out
in the ends of the earth!'</p>

<p>'I tell you,' growled Muspratt, 'the yardarm's the place for a
cock like him. Too spry altogether. We'll never be safe with him
above ground.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian,' said Reynell reproachfully, 'is this the man
you take for a mate? For your wife's
sake&mdash;think&mdash;think&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>For a moment Christian seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>'I've been in hell, Daniel Reynell, in hell the last three
weeks. I promised her I'd come back. This is the only way to keep
my word.'</p>

<p>He raised his hand and brought down his cutlass on the deck with
a clash.</p>

<p>Bligh would have spoken again, but Muspratt caught him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>'Come now, we've had enough of your chin music. Slip there,
lively now.'</p>

<p>The others laughed. It was an exquisite joke to see their
commander, the man who had ruled them with a rod of iron on
occasion, slip down the rope into the boat in his night shirt just
as he had been aroused from his sleep.</p>

<p>Christian, half shamefacedly, gave an order. His clothes were
flung after him and some small possessions. His pocket book, a
pencil, his watch.</p>

<p>Now the boat hung by a single rope and they drifted astern.</p>

<p>The forlorn men settled themselves drearily.</p>

<p>Bligh sent his keen eyes searching round the boat. Reynell was
lost in admiration at the way he pulled himself together.</p>

<p>'Are there any provisions in the boat? They'd surely never be
such brutes as to set us adrift without? Mr. Hallett, what's that
bag by you?'</p>

<p>'Bread, sir,' said Hallett.</p>

<p>'The breakers are full of water,' said Reynell, 'and those four
little barricoes, if it rains, or if we land anywhere, would hold a
little. But we want meat Christian. Mr. Christian? You will not be
inhuman? You are going back to plenty.'</p>

<p>He caught Bligh's eye. There was approval in it. It said plainer
than words, 'Go ahead. He's more likely to pay attention to
you.'</p>

<p>Christian put his head over the ship's side and spoke drearily,
like a man sunk in the deepest melancholy.</p>

<p>'There's wine and rum there,' he said. 'You'll find it under the
thwarts. Here, Smith,' to the man afterwards known as Adams, 'bring
along that pork.'</p>

<p>The pork was in pieces weighing about a couple of pounds apiece.
It was flung at them loose. Reynell caught it, and stowed it in one
of the empty barricoes.</p>

<p>The men were leaning over the sides of the ship now, making a
great display of the cutlasses and muskets with which they were
armed. Already there was no discipline on board. It seemed to
Reynell they had taken on a piratical cut-throat air.</p>

<p>But nothing was to be gained by defying them. He could only
speak them fair.</p>

<p>'Mates,' he said, making the best of it, 'if you're bound for
Tahiti and we for London town ours is bound to be the longer
voyage. You couldn't in decency part the carpenter from his
chest.'</p>

<p>There was a roar of laughter from the men above.</p>

<p>'Oh, come, I say,' protested Muspratt, 'you forget you've got
Bligh on board. I'll be damned if he doesn't find his way home if
he gets nothing more with him.'</p>

<p>Bligh seemed about to reply in kind, but Reynell's eyes implored
him to let him take charge.</p>

<p>'Well, mates, I really can't see it will matter to you,' he
said. 'Tahiti's a long way off. Come now, we've all been decent
shipmates, never a quarrel. Though we don't happen to want to go
back to Tahiti, give us a chance for our lives. It's murder to turn
us out without a tool.'</p>

<p>There was a storm of argument above. It was clear that had Bligh
alone been considered, he would have had nothing.</p>

<p>'Damn my eyes,' said Muspratt, 'but he'll have a vessel built in
a month.'</p>

<p>Reynell was meditating on his own folly. Why hadn't he betrayed
them the moment Christian had left him? A deliberate crime Bligh
would have considered his conduct. He was sure now that Bligh was
right. As he came to that conclusion the carpenter's chest was
lowered.</p>

<p>'Thank you, mates,' said he, 'that lifts a load from my mind.
Now what about arms? You'll give us some arms. I see you've plenty
and to spare.'</p>

<p>They hauled themselves in a little on the rope. The sea was dead
calm or their position would have been fraught with danger. The
sunlight shone on the anxious faces of the men who looked up, at
the fierce bearded faces of the seamen who looked down. They
laughed, most of them. But it was pitiless laughter. Only
Christian's stern face promised to Reynell a measure of mercy.</p>

<p>'Mr. Christian,' began Bligh again.</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, sir,' said Christian. 'You have brought it on
yourself.'</p>

<p>Reynell's look again implored his commander not to provoke this
man further.</p>

<p>'Well, the rest of us haven't harmed you,' said he bitterly.
'Why are you sending us to our deaths merely because we've been
law-abiding. I thought Mr. Stewart and Mr. Heywood might at least
have been trusted to join us.'</p>

<p>A grim smile broke over Christian's face.</p>

<p>'They're not very happy just at present,' said he. 'But they'll
thank us by and by. You may hear Mr. Heywood protesting, if you
listen.'</p>

<p>'I'll remember,' said Bligh with deliberation.</p>

<p>Reynell wished he wouldn't interfere. He felt it was not well
for them that these men should think the future of those left on
board could be affected one way or another by any man in the boat
there.</p>

<p>Perhaps Bligh thought the same. He glanced from the helpless
people in the little boat to the bristling array of muskets and
cutlasses above. Nineteen unarmed men against at least twenty
heavily armed there in the ship. He understood the hopelessness of
angering them. Diplomacy was the only thing. He smiled at Reynell,
as much as to say he left it in his capable hands.</p>

<p>'Come, man, a couple of cutlasses won't be missed, and may make
all the difference to us.'</p>

<p>'I'll be hanged if I don't go wid 'em,' said an Irish voice.
''Tis they have the pluck, me bhoys, goin' so quiet.' Michael Byrne
made as if he would have climbed down the ropes. A dozen pairs of
hands held him back.</p>

<p>Opposition made him still more determined.</p>

<p>'Ye'll remimber, Captain Bligh, ye'll remimber, I wanted to join
ye.'</p>

<p>'I'll remember,' said Bligh.</p>

<p>Again Reynell's eyes implored him not to behave as if what he
did or thought was likely to make any difference to these men.</p>

<p>'A couple of cutlasses,' begged Reynell. 'I think you owe me
that, Christian.'</p>

<p>'Upon my word I think I do,' said Christian. 'Here, Muspratt.'
He seized his cutlass and that of Milward, who stood beside
him.</p>

<p>'He'll be back in Tahiti before you can turn round,'
remonstrated Muspratt.</p>

<p>Christian paid no attention.</p>

<p>The men in the boat, without any orders, hauled on the rope till
they were close alongside again. Christian handed down the
cutlasses. Churchill threw in a couple more.</p>

<p>'There you are,' said Christian. 'Cast them off. A pleasant
voyage to you. Reynell, you can still come aboard if you like.'</p>

<p>Reynell shook his head.</p>

<p>'Be a little more pitiful. We've nothing to navigate by.'</p>

<p>'You're asking a good deal,' said Christian.</p>

<p>He left the deck for a moment. Returning, he handed down a book
of nautical tables and his own sextant.</p>

<p>'That book is sufficient for every purpose,' he said. 'And you
know,' and he looked at Bligh, 'my sextant is a good one.'</p>

<p>'Thank you. Now&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Cast off,' said Christian curtly. He did not wait for his order
to be obeyed. With his own hands he cast loose the rope, and they
were adrift.</p>

<p>There came a jeering yell from the ship.</p>

<p>'Lay along there, men,' shouted Christian. 'Hands to stations.
'Ware ship.'</p>

<p>In a moment the <i>Bounty</i> was a thing of life. The soft
breeze filled her sails, snowy white in the brilliant sunshine. She
swept round, and, nodding and curtseying as she met the waves, she
started on her course to Tahiti.</p>

<p>Fletcher Christian was keeping his word, ruining his life for a
girl of the wilds. Those who had stood in his path were adrift in
an open boat, with provisions that, in the ordinary course of
events, would last them five days at the very most.</p>

<p>The nearest civilized land was thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>A long sigh, like a moan, went up from the forlorn boat's
company.</p>

<p>'Upon my word,' said Reynell, 'we're better away from such a
piratical company. A pack of ruffians. They'll be cutting each
other's throats next. I bet you the captain gets us through.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Reynell. I'll remember that to you. Yes, I generally
do what I want. We'll get through if you all back me. They had need
to be afraid. That lot haven't done with us yet.'</p>

<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'Counsel is mine and sound
wisdom:<br>
I am understanding; I have strength.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>'Don't look after the ship,' said Reynell as cheerfully as he
could. 'No good looking back. We, thank God, are bound for old
England, aren't we, sir?'</p>

<p>'We are, Reynell,' said Bligh, huddling on his clothes, 'and
we'll get there if the rest of them take it as you are doing.'</p>

<p>Looking round, Reynell could not help knowing&mdash;and he felt
that Bligh was thinking the same thing&mdash;they had got the old
men and the weaklings.</p>

<p>'The older men have knowledge.' He put his thoughts in the most
favourable shape. He had never before known himself as a diplomat,
'and the younger ones will have the common sense to obey them. I've
been skipper of a ship in the stormy north seas, and I know how
necessary it is one man should have supreme command if we're to get
through. Now, who amongst us has most sea sense and can judge
best?'</p>

<p>'You,' said a voice.</p>

<p>Reynell laughed, and purposely laughed loud.</p>

<p>'Leading seaman and quartermaster,' said he. 'It's just taught
me how much the quartermaster does not know. Now, if I, a pressed
man, believe in the captain, have been proud to please
him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He half turned to Bligh respectfully, as coolly as if they had
been on the deck of the <i>Bounty</i> instead of all crowded
together in a little boat thousands of miles from their
destination.</p>

<p>Bligh acknowledged his courtesy with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>'Men,' said he, 'I need not tell you we are in desperate
straits. You can see that for yourselves. But there is one thing I
must impress upon you, the only way we can get out of this is by
the maintenance of a perfect discipline. You must give implicit
obedience to the man who can judge best, and can carry out his
judgments. Naturally I should be that man. But I see now that some
of you have been very discontented with my authority. If any of you
know a better man you had best make him your leader.'</p>

<p>His eyes for a moment wandered to the master, John Fryer.</p>

<p>There had always from the very first been friction between him
and the master.</p>

<p>'Only, mark you this, whoever is leader must be obeyed even to
death.'</p>

<p>He paused, looking round at the wide expanse of sea, the ship so
rapidly drawing away, then brought his eyes back to the eighteen
faces, all grave, some very troubled, that were looking at him.</p>

<p>'I think I am the best man.' His voice was incisive. 'Will you
have me for a leader?'</p>

<p>Reynell waited for the master to speak. But there was
silence.</p>

<p>'Most surely we will,' he said without undue haste, but as one
who thoroughly realized and weighed up the gravity of the
situation.</p>

<p>'We will,' said the master, 'I speak for the officers.'</p>

<p>'And I have spoken for the men,' said Reynell. 'Ay, men.'</p>

<p>'Ay! Ay! Ay!' The response came willingly, gladly.</p>

<p>The men hardly knew how desperate was the situation. Bligh's
confidence and that of Daniel Reynell, a fo'c'sle hand, and one of
themselves, but an educated man and a good seaman, cheered
them.</p>

<p>Reynell knew Bligh, with all his harshness, perhaps because of
his harshness, was the man to hold them together. He repeated again
firmly and loudly,</p>

<p>'We will have you for a leader.'</p>

<p>'Very well then,' said Bligh with his own air of authority, 'I
shall be a hard leader, but it will be for your own good. Be sure I
shall not spare myself. Now we must divide ourselves into watches.
Mr. Fryer, I shall pick my watch. You will take what I leave. But I
shall pick fair, so that our strength is evenly divided. I am going
to give you Daniel Reynell, who is a good man.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Fryer dully.</p>

<p>Bligh's look at Reynell seemed to be saying he would be virtual
head of the master's watch.</p>

<p>'Now,' he ordered when the choice was made, 'you and your watch,
Mr. Fryer, will lie down on the bottom boards of the boat, it is
the only way to secure that she be properly worked.'</p>

<p>Reynell laid himself down. The boat was leaking a little, and
the water came washing around him. They were desperately crowded.
His knees were drawn up. He could turn over on his side, but,
without inconveniencing the man next him, he could do nothing else
but stare up at the sky overhead. At first it had been bright with
sunshine, but the clouds were gathering, and the blue growing less
and less. It was a relief; a tropical sun pouring down on them was
unbearable. Yet it was bound to come.</p>

<p>From this position he saw the faces of the men above him from a
new angle. His head rested against Bligh's feet. His pointed chin
seemed to be emphasized. Hallett's tired little face looked girlish
in its prettiness.</p>

<p>The sea was almost smooth, yet the boat moved up and clown on
the swell so the faces above moved up and down. First there was a
background of blue sky; then a background of cloud; then came the
sky again. Every now and again the swell rose so high it was a
background of sea that seemed about to overwhelm them. They could
not escape. They were right down at the bottom of a great
depression. The sea must come in.</p>

<p>'Shut your eyes,' said Bligh, 'you will soon get accustomed to
it.'</p>

<p>He understood. He was a marvellous man, this man who had such a
capacity for making men hate him. If any one could bring them
through he could. How he had hated him, when first he was dragged
on board. Now&mdash;did he hate Christian? It was cruel, it was
bitter, but Christian's motives were human and understandable.
Lying there cramped and weary, Reynell still felt he could spare a
certain amount of sympathy for Christian, torn from the woman he
loved, made to seem forsworn in her eyes. If that woman had been
Loveday&mdash;&mdash;He moved uneasily. He dared not think of
Loveday. It was too cruel, baulked a second time.</p>

<p>Bligh gave the order to take stock of the provisions. They found
they had 16 pieces of pork, each weighing about 2 lbs., 150 lbs. of
bread, 6 quarts of rum, 6 bottles of wine and 28 gallons of
water.</p>

<p>'We must keep our stock intact,' said Bligh. 'If possible we
must not break in on those provisions while we are among the
islands. We will want them when we get a long stretch of sea. We
must land somewhere and see if we cannot get coconuts and
fish.'</p>

<p>'Whereabouts are we?' asked a dozen voices.</p>

<p>'East of the Friendly Isles,' said Bligh, 'Tofoa should be
hereabouts.'</p>

<p>'It's a long while since supper last night,' suggested Hallett,
with a quiver in his voice.</p>

<p>'It is, my lad, it is, so the sooner we reach Tofoa the better,
but it is nothing to fast for a day.'</p>

<p>Poor little Hallett's face fell. Reynell, opening his eyes,
looked at him pityingly. He was glad he was not leader. He would
have felt sorely tempted to give the child a piece of bread. Bligh
would not be tempted that way, he knew. In his heart he was
thankful. It would want a strong man to carry them through.</p>

<p>'Where shall you make for?' asked the master.</p>

<p>'Tofoa, Mr. Fryer.'</p>

<p>'And after, sir. You will not stay at Tofoa,' said Reynell.</p>

<p>'No, Reynell,' said Bligh, slowly, as if he were weighing his
words, 'If the people are friendly, and if it is a fertile land, it
is possible I may leave half of us there. The rest of us will go on
to the Dutch East Indies.'</p>

<p>'God Almighty!' the master swore, 'it's thousands of miles
away.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless it is the nearest civilised land. There is nothing
else to be done.'</p>

<p>'It can never be done,' said Fryer despairingly.</p>

<p>A moan went round the crew. Reynell opened his eyes again, and
watched to see what Bligh would say next.</p>

<p>'Men,'&mdash;he raised his voice a little&mdash;'It can be done.
More than one hundred years ago it was done. By men who had not the
conveniences we have nowadays. Listen to me. About one hundred and
fifty years ago a ship called the <i>Batavia</i> was wrecked on the
coast of New Holland, on a reef known as Houtman's Abrolhos. Her
crew escaped to the surrounding islands. You do not know the west
coast of New Holland. It is a barren desert, incapable of
supporting life. The captain, Francis Pelsart, in the longboat
sailed to Batavia, brought help to the crew, and took the survivors
back to Holland. Now what Dutchmen can do Englishmen need not
fear.'</p>

<p>That voyage of the Dutchman, dead long ago, gave them something
to think about. Reynell felt his admiration deepen. It was
discussed in all its points by the men lying down and the men who
were working the boat. They debated whether the Dutchman had sailed
farther or whether they would have the farthest to sail; and
whether the chances were in their favour.</p>

<p>Bligh settled that point promptly.</p>

<p>'It is easier done this side of New Holland,' he said. 'There is
some chance of falling in with land where we may get food. The west
of New Holland, all men are agreed, is a barren desert.'</p>

<p>The discussion went on. Each man added some little information,
or told some tale of suffering and endurance from his own
knowledge.</p>

<p>But the time was terribly long. Thinking it over afterwards,
Reynell decided that of all the long and weary days they spent in
that boat that first was perhaps the hardest to bear.</p>

<p>As the day wore on the watches were changed. The men grew
hungrier&mdash;thirstier. They reviled their shipmates bitterly,
calling down curses on men who could wantonly abandon messmates
with whom they had not the shadow of a quarrel.</p>

<p>'You need not curse,' said Bligh grimly. 'Believe me,
lawlessness is its own punishment. Not one of those
men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You are going to say "will die in his bed,"' said Fryer
laughing forlornly, 'but at present we don't care much how they
die; what we are concerned with is how to keep alive
ourselves.'</p>

<p>'That we will manage, I doubt not for a moment,' said Bligh.</p>

<p>The watch was changed again. Reynell watched the sun till he
sank beneath Lebogue's back, making a halo of glorious rays round
the old sail-maker's head. The light vanished suddenly. It was all
dark. Presently he was watching the stars, trying to think of the
old home in Cornwall; the house he had furnished with such care on
the heights above Polperro; the <i>Reaper,</i> swept before a
northerly gale&mdash;anything&mdash;everything&mdash;to try and
deaden the hunger that was gnawing at his vitals&mdash;the thirst
that was making his throat dry and his tongue parched. Only he did
not let his thoughts dwell on Loveday Corthew's hazel eyes. He did
not dare do that yet. By and by, when he felt sure they had a
chance of getting through, the thought of her would comfort him.
But that was not yet.</p>

<p>All through the night they sailed steadily, changing watches as
regularly as if they had been on board the <i>Bounty.</i></p>

<p>At dawn of day there went up a great cry of rejoicing. There was
land, rugged and mountainous, a great high peak three points on the
starboard bow.</p>

<p>The men shouted as if they were sighting the Lizard itself. Then
came Bligh's voice, cool, and calm.</p>

<p>'Steady, men, steady. Shake another reef out of the sail,
bo'sun. She'll stand it.'</p>

<p>In a couple of hours they had run into a little rocky cove. A
safe enough harbour, but the rocks round the beach were steep and
high. There was not a sign of human habitation, unless some rough
ladders, made of the natural vines, were signs.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Bligh, 'yes, the Indians have certainly been here.
But the country inland looks poor. Now, Norton, and you, Hallett,
and you, Lebogue, must stay by the boat. The rest of us will go
look for water and food, and at least some sign of human
habitation. There are coconuts at least.'</p>

<p>There were about thirty trees on the top of a cliff, steep as
the wall of a house. Hallett looked imploringly at Bligh.</p>

<p>'If we might have a drink of water, sir.'</p>

<p>Bligh pointed to the palms.</p>

<p>'There is meat and drink, Mr Hallett. Let me remind you again,
if we are to be saved we must keep all our food and water intact
till we have left the islands.'</p>

<p>At the foot of that cliff the surf roared. The only way to reach
those coconuts was a long climb round.</p>

<p>'Come,' said Reynell kindly, his hand on the boy's shoulder, 'I
believe we can get them.'</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<p>Reynell felt he might think of Loveday Corthew again when he
helped young Elphinstone gather and throw them into the surf whence
they dragged them into the boat.</p>

<p>There were only twenty. But at least it was meat and drink, the
first they had had since the <i>Bounty</i> had cast them adrift.
All the hungry faces looked a little more hopeful.</p>

<p>Bligh was a stern taskmaster.</p>

<p>'We must save them,' he said, when the men looked to have one
apiece, 'just a little to each.'</p>

<p>They acquiesced.</p>

<p>So quietly they took it these starving men that Reynell could
only wonder again that any one could have been found to oppose
Bligh. If Christian had not been there&mdash;had not had such a
strong motive&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But what was the good of going over it all again. Christian had
been there, at first, Reynell admitted it, a justly incensed man.
His guile opposed to Bligh's will had worked their destruction. He
ate the fragment of coconut and drank the very small drop of milk
that fell to his share, and wondered if he did not feel more hungry
after it had gone.</p>

<p>'We must certainly not break in on our bread till we are
absolutely obliged. We are thousands of miles from help,' said
Bligh quietly, as if he felt there might be discontent.</p>

<p>There was wisdom in what he said.</p>

<p>But it was very hard.</p>

<p>That night it blew a gale from the east-south-east.</p>

<p>They dare not venture to sea. When at last the wind died down
they had to row along the coast. The keen air and the exercise
increased their hunger. The wind got up again, and there was
nothing for it but to return to the cove.</p>

<p>Hallett was moaning pitifully with hunger. No one took any
notice. Every now and again he apologized.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help it. I can only think of the
scones my mother bakes and the butter in the dairy.'</p>

<p>'Hush, lad,' said Reynell sharply, though the lad was his
officer. 'We can't stand talk like that.'</p>

<p>'We're fair clemmed,' said the boy.</p>

<p>Bligh was lying on the bottom of the boat. He rose, and slowly
and gravely as if they were in the midst of abundance, doled out to
each person a morsel of bread and a spoonful of rum. Though they
were in the tropics, the wind blew keen and cold, and they were wet
through, so that the rum sent a little glow through their bodies.
Some of them for the moment took more hopeful views. Poor little
Hallett, leaned up against Reynell and dropped into an uneasy
sleep.</p>

<p>Reynell tried to follow his example. But he had more on his mind
than hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>Presently the sea calmed a little.</p>

<p>'Now, men,' said Bligh, 'up with you and see if some one's sharp
eyes can't find water.'</p>

<p>But it was a desolate country, covered with lava. Away in the
distance they could see smoke and flame. A wild yell broke from the
little company.</p>

<p>'May I be forgiven,' said the master, 'but I believe we have
found the entrance to the bottomless pit.'</p>

<p>Ledward, the surgeon, was a man of knowledge and education. In
his desire to see the unknown world, he had shipped before the
mast. Bligh had raised him to his present position when his
original surgeon fell ill.</p>

<p>''Tis a burning mountain, man,' he said. 'A thing mighty curious
to see. And there&mdash;there's a hut for you at last.'</p>

<p>'And a plantain walk,' said Reynell with a shout.</p>

<p>'Be careful, be careful now, Reynell,' warned Bligh. 'It'll
never do to offend the Indians.'</p>

<p>'Those huts are deserted,' said Reynell taking a good look
around. 'And there are only three little bunches of plantains left,
I reckon, because they aren't worth taking.'</p>

<p>'I think we may be glad of them,' said Bligh with a sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Reynell could not but admire how faithfully the men kept their
promise to this leader. Those plantains were carried off and
carefully lowered down the cliff, no man touching them.</p>

<p>They found a cave with a pleasant sandy bottom.</p>

<p>'My watch will go ashore and sleep there,' said Bligh.</p>

<p>'Why not all of us?' asked the master.</p>

<p>'Because, Mr. Fryer, it is necessary,' said Bligh, 'to be
watchful. If the Indians come upon us unawares they may be
friendly, or it may be we have been putting ourselves to
unnecessary pain. If they knock us on the head that bread and pork
will have been wasted as far as we are concerned.'</p>

<p>The grim pleasantry set them laughing. That night all rested
comfortably. Hallett hoped that Bligh would let them eat all the
bananas.</p>

<p>'I could eat the whole blooming lot myself,' he whispered to
Reynell.</p>

<p>'One will keep life in you, lad. And I fear it's all you will
get.'</p>

<p>'I'm beginning to doubt if it's worth keeping,' said the boy
with a sad little laugh.</p>

<p>He felt better next morning when the natives found them out,
just as Bligh was doling out that wretched plantain apiece.</p>

<p>Remembering the kindly people of Tahiti, the men hailed them
with delight. But these people were not like the Tahitians. They
were a shade darker in colour and rougher in their manners.</p>

<p>They brought breadfruit and coconuts to trade. The men parted
with their own scanty possessions; their clothes; their pocket
knives; their buttons. Even stern Bligh could only see wisdom in
eating their fill.</p>

<p>They bought provisions for the voyage, too: breadfruit and
coconuts, perishable, certainly, but it would save their bread and
pork.</p>

<p>'By Jove, we are in luck,' said the surgeon as he lay back and
drank luxuriously of coconut milk.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't be too sure,' said Bligh. 'I don't quite like the
look of them. If they get wind we're shipwrecked I wouldn't give
much for our lives. Get up, Mr. Ledward, you must go, a party of
you, and get water, if you have to carry it in coconut shells.
Eight of you will stop with me to guard the boat. See, for your own
sakes, you don't get separated one from another. I warn you, these
men are not Tahitians or anything like them.'</p>

<p>The dark men and women, in their petticoats of yellow grass and
their necklaces of shell and sharks' teeth, kept bringing
breadfruit, coconuts, and plantains, till a goodly heap lay on the
floor of the cave. The men grew more and more cheerful. Young
Hallett began shouting a gay chanty.</p>

<p>Then the women did not come any more.</p>

<p>Reynell cast an anxious glance round. Where was Mr. Fryer and
his party. He saw two men knocking stones together, a little
surreptitiously it was true. But it was a certain sign of
hostility.</p>

<p>'Sir, did you see that?'</p>

<p>'I did. Where is Mr. Fryer? At sunset we must be off. They are
coming in crowds. Not a woman amongst them. Close up, men. Don't
let them get behind you. Where the devil is Mr. Fryer?'</p>

<p>Reynell gave more than one hail before it was answered. Down the
vines they came, hand over hand, each man guarding carefully a
coconut-shell full of water.</p>

<p>'And of all the darned cussed ways of cartin' water,' said John
Norton as, with a sigh of relief, he emptied his into one of the
little casks.</p>

<p>'Are you all here?' came Bligh's voice. To Reynell there sounded
a note of anxiety in it.</p>

<p>'All here, sir,' said Reynell. 'Shall we make a break for
it?'</p>

<p>'The sooner we get away the better. Quietly, now, men, quietly.
Each man take something and put it in the boat.'</p>

<p>The natives were crowding round them, chattering and
gesticulating.</p>

<p>There was a clash.</p>

<p>Stones beating one against the other.</p>

<p>Like an electric flash it went through the little band they were
in danger. They were outnumbered two to one. If the enemy made a
rush, unarmed as the sailors were, they were undone. The boat was a
very little way off. Four of the crew were already in her. They had
been stowing the stuff brought by the others.</p>

<p>'Steadily, men, steadily.' Bligh's voice was quite calm.</p>

<p>He approached the chief, after the fashion they had all used in
Tahiti. He slipped his arm through his, and, taking his hand, began
leading him towards the boat, talking all the while suavely, saying
the politest things in Tahitian&mdash;which he hoped the other
might dimly understand. He regretted the necessity for departure;
thanked the chief for his courtesy; said he would come again.</p>

<p>If he had not held the chief's brown hand fast in his neither he
nor any one else would have reached that boat unmolested.</p>

<p>'Get in quietly, men,' he said. 'I can't hold this beggar long.
He's getting restive.'</p>

<p>'All in, sir,' reported Reynell, jumping in himself.</p>

<p>Bligh bid the chief a fervent farewell, perhaps a little
hurriedly and followed him.</p>

<p>'Haul off,' said Reynell, taking upon himself to give the order,
for the master had said nothing. 'Haul off.'</p>

<p>The others were all watching Bligh in silent horror. If the
chief had not been beside him they knew he would never have reached
the boat in safety.</p>

<p>They were still attached by a stern rope to a rock.</p>

<p>'Pull, men, pull; we can't afford to lose the rope,' said the
master.</p>

<p>'Damn it,' said John Norton, 'I know a trick worth two of that.'
He was overboard and running up the beach.</p>

<p>It might almost have been the signal for attack. Like a flash
three savages were upon him. While his startled cry of 'Mates' was
ringing in their ears they had beaten him to the ground with their
clubs. His blood was dyeing the wet sand. He was surely dead. Not
that they could have rescued him if he had not been.</p>

<p>The natives got the stern rope and pulled at it.</p>

<p>Without waiting for orders, Reynell bent over and cut it with
his seaman's knife.</p>

<p>'Promptly done,' came Bligh's rare praise.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was not a moment too soon. Heavy stones came
showering among them like so many shot. The men who had been
providing them with provisions so short a time before were yelling
like demons, greeting each successful shot with a howl that showed
them the savages they were.</p>

<p>Down went Mr. Ledward. The blood was streaming from Mr.
Elphinstone's face; young Hallett had a cut in his shoulder.
Reynell, hauling off to the grapnel, got one on the back of his
hand that covered it with blood.</p>

<p>That grapnel stuck.</p>

<p>All the canoes the natives had come in lay along the beach. The
white men saw them filling them with stones. Before they were
clear, round and round them those canoes were paddling, bombarding
them with stones.</p>

<p>They had nothing to return the fire with but the stones that
fell in the boat. And they were no match at the game. The fierce,
brown-skinned men, now thirsting for their blood, could run rings
round them.</p>

<p>Still that grapnel held.</p>

<p>With the veins on his forehead bursting, Reynell pulled. Three
men behind him were putting their weight on to it. Savage shouts of
triumph were ringing in his ears. He had little doubt what their
fate would be were they taken.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fluke broke.</p>

<p>Back they fell in a heap in the boat. But she was free at
last.</p>

<p>'Out oars,' cried Bligh. 'Out oars and close with them. It's our
only chance!'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'They are fainthearted;<br>

</p>
<br>

<p>The boat was deep in the water&mdash;lumbered. The men of Tofoa,
nimble adversaries, rowed yelling round it, raining stones upon
such an excellent mark. If this went on the white men had small
chance of their lives.</p>

<p>'It's like to be short and sharp,' muttered Elphinstone, wiping
the blood from his eyes. 'My faith! But I wish we hadn't wasted
that bread.'</p>

<p>Reynell snatched the cap from his head and a coat of Bligh's
that lay on the thwart and tossed them overboard.</p>

<p>The first canoe came to a full stop.</p>

<p>'That's right,' shouted Bligh. 'Anything you can spare. Quick
men. Heave them overboard. It'll be dark in a few moments. We can
get away to sea.'</p>

<p>Every man contributed a garment, flinging them all round the
boat.</p>

<p>They bent to the oars and shot out to sea. To their relief the
canoes made no effort to follow.</p>

<p>'Make the best of the respite,' urged Bligh. 'They'll be after
us before you can say knife.'</p>

<p>The light was dying fast; the canoes were but dim shadows on the
water; the land behind was becoming just a darker mass against the
dark sky. For ten minutes they pulled with every ounce of strength
they possessed, men fleeing for their lives. Then Reynell drew a
long breath. There was no sign of pursuit.</p>

<p>'I think we're safe. I hope we are, for I'm done.'</p>

<p>'In oars,' said Bligh. 'We'll set sail. It is evident,' he added
thoughtfully, 'we must exercise extreme caution before we mingle
with the natives again. It is all very well to trust them when we
are heavily armed, and have a ship at our back, but as it
is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What can we do, then?' asked the Master.</p>

<p>That was the question. Here they were, eighteen men adrift in an
open boat, twenty-three feet long, without even a chart to guide
them. Bligh had been in these seas before, once with Cook; but all
that meant was he could give very general directions. Their
stoppage at Tofoa had cost them one man's life, had gained them a
little, a very little, water, a few coconuts and some breadfruit,
all trampled now in the heat of the fight.</p>

<p>It was coming on a dirty night.</p>

<p>'It'll swamp the canoes, thank heaven, if they attempt to follow
us up,' said the surgeon with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'It might be more of a consolation,' said Elphinstone, 'if we
could be sure it wouldn't swamp us too.'</p>

<p>'She ought to stand the foresail with a reef in it,' said Bligh.
'Anyhow, we must risk it.'</p>

<p>It might have been other reasons than greed for European clothes
had prevented the savages from following them.</p>

<p>The moment they were out from under the shelter of the land they
got the full force of the storm. The wind strengthened. First it
came in puffs; presently it was a wild hurricane.</p>

<p>The sea rose and rose.</p>

<p>The wind came with a rush that carried them on to the top of the
wave.</p>

<p>Reynell sat at the sheet and Bligh held the tiller; the rest
were soon crouching in the boat watching, awestruck, the waves. Up,
up, up the racing sea carried them.</p>

<p>'Ease your sheet a bit,' yelled Bligh, 'ease your sheet. For
God's sake, don't let her jibe!'</p>

<p>High above the sea they looked down a precipice of inky-black
water, which the faint moonbeams touched here and there. Down that
precipice they rushed. It seemed impossible they could ever rise
again. Down, down till the seas towered over them on either side,
and the sail hung slack, becalmed, for the wind that shrieked
overhead could not reach them.</p>

<p>'Bale! Bale! For your lives bale!' urged Reynell, as the
following sea curled up over their stern and more than half filled
the boat.</p>

<p>'Hayward, Simpson, Linkletter,' called Bligh, calm still.
'Everything must go overboard except the provisions. Ropes, sails,
spare clothes. Everything but the carpenter's chest. We'll hold on
to that as long as we can. The rest of you bale! Bale! Ease the
sheet, Reynell. For your life don't let her jibe!'</p>

<p>Overboard went all the men's treasures, little things precious
to men in such straits. It lightened the boat somewhat, gave them a
little more room to bale.</p>

<p>'Half of us had better go overboard too,' said Linkletter
grimly. 'It's the only chance of safety.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Bligh quietly. 'We'll see it through together.'</p>

<p>They rose on the wave again. The gale was shrieking in their
ears, drowning every other sound.</p>

<p>Not till half the night was through did that storm blow itself
out. Even when the wind had gone down there was the great sea to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>The master took the tiller, and Bligh served out all round a
teaspoonful of rum to each man. It put heart into them, and helped
the time to pass.</p>

<p>At long last the day broke, grim and unwilling, more like a dawn
in cold, northern latitudes than anything they had been accustomed
to in those Southern seas. It showed the faces of the men weary and
worn, like those of men who have come through a great trial.</p>

<p>'But we are through,' said Bligh, as if voicing their thoughts,
'we are through. If this launch can weather a sea like last
night's, she can weather anything. I am proud of you, men. You
behaved like Englishmen. Reynell, you managed that sail well, we
owe you thanks,' and though their chances were so miserably small
Reynell felt himself honoured.</p>

<p>Bligh went through the provisions. Taking out his pocket book
sodden with wet, he began making some calculations.</p>

<p>'We must make those provisions last eight weeks,' he
announced.</p>

<p>The master laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>'God!' he said, 'what sort of scarecrows'll we be at the end of
it?'</p>

<p>'What else have you to suggest, Mr. Fryer? We dare not land at
any islands. We are less able to defend ourselves than we were at
Tofoa. We may get a little fish or a bird or two, but what we have
here will keep life in us. We are not doing any hard work.'</p>

<p>'We can't even stretch our legs properly,' said Fryer.</p>

<p>'But you all agree there is nothing else to be done.'</p>

<p>'There is nothing else to be done,' said the men wearily.</p>

<p>'Reynell, take the tiller. Keep her nor' west by west. 'Twill
take us somewhere by the Fijis, I think.'</p>

<p>He dropped down into the bottom of the boat and began busily
making a pair of scales with a piece of twine and a couple of
halves of coconut-shell.</p>

<p>When it was completed he held up a pistol bullet. Pistol bullets
in those days were fairly large things. Twenty-five went to the
pound.</p>

<p>'Do you see that, men? I propose that each of us shall have the
weight of that pistol bullet in bread, breakfast and dinner, and we
will make the pork and damaged breadfruit go as far as we can. You
understand. It cannot possibly last long.'</p>

<p>They understood, and assented without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'As for the water, we will have a quarter of a pint each three
times a day; but the coconuts should last, I think, with care, at
least three days.'</p>

<p>Then the long, weary voyage began.</p>

<p>They were cold; they were wet; they were parched with thirst;
their limbs were cramped; the sea water raised sores on their
flesh; their faces grew hollow, pinched, wolfish.</p>

<p>But no one murmured. They did not even curse the shipmates who
had driven them to this. They were past all that.</p>

<p>The days were cloudy. Luckily perhaps. The nights were actually
cold. As each man waked in the morning from his troubled sleep he
painfully made such efforts as he could in the crowded boat to
stretch his cramped limbs. Bligh served to each one a spoonful of
rum before giving them their breakfast of broken breadfruit, and
afterwards the fragment of bread&mdash;that is hard ship's
biscuit&mdash;that was represented by one pistol bullet.</p>

<p>That teaspoonful of rum was the one treat they had in the long
dreary round of hours. It added to their thirst afterwards, but for
the moment it sent a warm glow through their numbed, aching bodies.
Some thanked God for it. Some cursed aloud at their fate. But to
all it was the one thing in the day worth having.</p>

<p>Always one half sat up, and always the other half lay on the
bottom of the boat, crouched together, not only for warmth but
because there was so little room.</p>

<p>Once Reynell hooked a fish, a great fish. Then even those lying
in the bottom of the boat were obliged, in their excitement, to
kneel up and watch, for a great fish like that would have supplied
them with food for a day or more&mdash;would have allayed, in no
small measure, the cravings of hunger. Closer and closer he came.
Reynell played with him steadily.</p>

<p>'He's too big for the tackle, I fear,' he said.</p>

<p>They could see him now, a great, long-finned angelfish. Reynell
pulled steadily. Up. Nearer. Nearer. He was almost within reach of
the hands outstretched to catch him.</p>

<p>Then the tackle broke! He was gone!</p>

<p>There went up a moan from the eager men. Reynell dropped back to
his seat and covered his face. He wondered if he had felt anything
so much since they had ironed him in the fore peak of the
<i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>The bitterness of it was that they were in a world of islands.
Hungry, thirsty, weary, and again and again a bright green island,
whereon they could see the coconut palms that meant life to them,
rose up out of the sea.</p>

<p>'Land oh! Land oh!' was the cry more than once in the course of
a day.</p>

<p>Eager faces turned to Bligh. But he always shook his head.</p>

<p>'We daren't. We daren't. After Tofoa we daren't.'</p>

<p>There was sound common sense in what he said. The eagerness died
out of their faces.</p>

<p>All differences of rank had disappeared now. They were comrades
in misfortune, only Bligh was their leader, the man to whom they
looked for orders and suggestions.</p>

<p>Once they were chased by two sailing canoes full of armed men.
It was close to a mountainous island that seemed to invite the
sea-weary men to land and rest. The brown men made signs to them
that they were friends. But they dare not risk it, and they pushed
on for the open sea.</p>

<p>'I know the water is trickling down those hillsides,' said Fryer
wistfully.</p>

<p>'Don't, man,' said Reynell sharply, for the thirst was
unbearable.</p>

<p>When they had reached breaking point, and want of water was
driving them to risk their lives by landing, there came on a storm
of rain. The heavens opened and it came down in sheets that beat
the sea flat. Sea and sky were blotted out by the falling water;
there was no sound in their ears but the roar of the rain. It took
their breath away. They were wet to the skin in a moment. But for
the first time since they had been adrift they quenched their
thirst.</p>

<p>'Spread the sail thwarts,' cried Bligh. 'Reynell, Fryer,
Elphinstone, Linkletter, spread the sail. We ought to catch enough
to last us to the coast of New Holland.'</p>

<p>Hardly had they the sail spread before it was full to
overflowing with water. They emptied it into one of the little
baricoes and spread it again. And again. And again.</p>

<p>Before the rain stopped, as suddenly as it had come down, they
had added thirty-four gallons of good, sweet rainwater to their
store, and every man had thoroughly quenched his thirst.</p>

<p>Now for a space the weather was calmer. They fitted a pair of
shrouds to each mast, and contrived, from one of the sails, a
canvas weather cloth round the boat, nailed on the gun'als round
the seats; thus raising the quarters about nine inches.</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Reynell with a sigh of satisfaction, as he held the
canvass while the carpenter knocked in the last nail, 'I don't
think we'll have such a time baling next time we have a storm. But
maybe we won't have another storm. We ought to be getting into
warmer waters.'</p>

<p>'It don't feel much like warm waters,' said the carpenter. 'I'm
friz to the marrer, and there ain't a pound weight's blow in me
arms.'</p>

<p>It was cold, dark and gloomy. The rain came so often that their
clothes were drenched with water that felt icy to their ill-fed
bodies.</p>

<p>Bligh put his hand in the sea and dabbled.</p>

<p>'The sea is warmer men,' he said. 'Take off your shirts and dip
them. They're wet anyway.'</p>

<p>The sea was warmer. With their clothes soaked in sea water they
were not so cold. But the garments were harder to dry again when
the sun did appear.</p>

<p>'But the gloomy weather is a blessing, a blessing,' repeated
Bligh over and over again. 'See the rain that has fallen.
Thirty-four gallons one day, twenty another. I assure you, men, we
could not have lived had the sun blazed in the sky as he did the
last time I was in these seas.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there were no more ardent sunworshippers than
those poor, starving castaways. They greeted the reappearance of
the Lord of light with frantic joy. Not unnaturally, seeing that
such broken rest as they could get must be taken lying in the
water, for even continuous baling could not keep the boat dry.</p>

<p>Presently all extra provisions had given out. They were reduced
to one twenty-fifth of a pound of bread and an ounce of salt pork
apiece twice a day. It kept life in them. But that was all.</p>

<p>Reynell, looking at the worn and weary faces, haggard and thin
and half dead, noticing the painfully slow movements&mdash;to move
a hand or a foot seemed agony&mdash;thought that never in his life
had he seen such a horrible boatload of creatures masquerading in
wet rags as human beings.</p>

<p>Judging by himself, active hunger seemed to have passed; the
weather was so wet the thirst had gone completely; but there
remained a restless gnawing that refused to let him rest. He did
not feel as if he wanted meat. He wondered what he did want.</p>

<p>'How much more can we stand?' he asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>'Faith 'tis impossible to say. 'Tis wonderful how long a man,
given water, can hold out. You can't call this living, it's bare
existing, and if it wasn't for a certain little daughter I have in
Portsmouth there&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If it weren't for the girl in Cornwall waiting for
me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, I suppose we all have something. I suppose it's worth it. I
know my little maid is.'</p>

<p>'Some of us, I'm afraid, won't see it through.' Reynell spoke
for the surgeon's ear alone. 'This boy is dying.'</p>

<p>Little Hallett was leaning against his knees, apparently only
about half conscious. His white face was turned up to the sky. His
eyes were half shut.</p>

<p>The surgeon looked at him curiously, not unkindly, but with a
remote sort of manner, as if the case were entirely beyond him. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>'I shall ask the skipper for a scrap of pork for him.'</p>

<p>'You might as well ask the nether millstone.'</p>

<p>Fryer was steering. Bligh was in the bottom of the boat. His
eyes had sunken; his mouth had fallen in; his beard had grown, but
it could not hide the deep lines that ran down from his nose to his
mouth. Reynell bent forward.</p>

<p>'Sir. Sir. A little bit of pork for the lad. He is dying of
hunger.'</p>

<p>Bligh hardly looked at the boy.</p>

<p>'He has had his allowance for to-day,' he said.</p>

<p>'But, sir&mdash;but, sir&mdash;he is dying. No one would grudge
him a small piece to put a little life in him.'</p>

<p>'If I gave in to you, Reynell,' said Bligh quietly, so quietly
they could not tell whether he felt any pity for the boy or not,
'the same plea could be put forth by sixteen others in less than
half an hour,' and he dropped his chin on his breast again as if
there the discussion ended.</p>

<p>'I told you he had no bowels,' said Ledward.</p>

<p>'He'd never have got us so far if he had,' said Reynell
justly.</p>

<p>Cruel as it was, he felt that Bligh was right. In the interest
of the majority the boy must take his chance with the rest.</p>

<p>Still, Hallett did not die. During his watch below Reynell took
him in his arms and held him close, trying to put a little of his
own warmth into him.</p>

<p>The night was a bad one. They were obliged to run before the
sea, watching the helm with care, for the least error would have
been disastrous. When morning dawned, dull and lowering, Hallett
was still alive. Boobies and noddies were breasting the waves round
the boat.</p>

<p>Bligh looked round on the heaving, lead-coloured sea.</p>

<p>'Land,' said he tersely. He looked so near death's door Reynell
thought the land would be only useful as a burial place.</p>

<p>The master gave a sobbing sigh.</p>

<p>'If we could land,' he said, 'I don't believe I could lift a leg
to get out of the boat. I'm that crippled with rheumatism.'</p>

<p>'There's an open sore on me leg,' said Lebogue, 'you could put
your fist in.'</p>

<p>They were all crippled with aching pains, stiff joints and open
sores. They spoke about it dully, the pains inside and out, the
unbearable aching that allowed no rest. Perhaps it was the thought
of land so near and yet so unattainable that opened their lips.</p>

<p>'What's the good,' asked Elphinstone, 'of tantalizing us with
the thought of land. We daren't go ashore.'</p>

<p>Bligh roused himself with an effort.</p>

<p>'I think,' said he, slowly and deliberately, 'we must be
approaching the great reefs off the coast of New Holland.'</p>

<p>To most of the men it meant much the same as if he had mentioned
the coasts of Laputa or the Delectable Mountains. It was something
in his tone that gave them hope.</p>

<p>'Could we land there?' It came like one shout.</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Bligh. 'We might land there. In safety.'</p>

<p>'My God!' said Reynell. There was something in his leader's face
that sent his own poor starved blood racing through his veins. All
his future spread out once more fair before him. The worst was
over. Was it possible the worst was over? Had he fairly covered the
cruel first stage of the road that led straight to the arms of the
woman he loved? To the girl who had been his star and his hope? She
seemed quite near now.</p>

<p>'I take it,' went on Bligh with deliberation, 'we may not only
land there in safety but we shall find there some sort of
food&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>His voice was drowned in jubilation, thin and hectic; the men
were sobbing like children, but it was jubilation for all that.
They caught a glimpse of the end of the long, weary voyage.</p>

<p>'My God, sir!' cried Reynell, and his voice was shaking, 'if we
get there we get home!'</p>

<p>'I thought you understood,' said Bligh, harshly perhaps to hide
his own emotion, 'we are bound for England.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'Now men see not the bright light

but the wind passeth and cleanseth them.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Mistress Corthew did her duty by her husband's daughter. It
seemed to the farmer she laid in clothes to last a life-time.</p>

<p>But the last stitch was put in the last garment; linen; dresses;
house-linen, and many a thing the far-seeing woman imagined might
be useful in a land where nothing could be bought, were all laid
away in lavender in stout oak chests, which were carried down to
Polperro and there shipped aboard the <i>Reaper</i> which was bound
for Wapping. It was surely the irony of fate that Reynell's old
ship should carry those boxes, all neatly labelled, 'Captain
Quested, R.N., H.M.S. <i>Venus,</i> Deptford.'</p>

<p>On the 1st February, 1789, when all the paths were like glass,
and the bare hedges were white and heavy with snow that had fallen
the night before, they went across to Lansallos Church and married
Loveday Corthew to Thomas Quested.</p>

<p>The bride's face was white as the snow itself, but the winter
sunshine streamed through the leaded windows and fell on her golden
curls. Polperro said it was a good sign.</p>

<p>'If it rest with me,' said Quested fervently, 'if it rest with
me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>To Loveday it was all like a dream&mdash;a happy dream, though
she would not have said so. It was the convention of the time to be
sentimental. She was not regarded as a child. She was a
woman&mdash;a woman who should have mourned her lost lover longer.
Or&mdash;since it would have been folly to let such a good offer of
marriage go by, she was expected to be pensive about it&mdash;to
marry Captain Quested because&mdash;her heart being dead&mdash;she
might as well be kind and save him from misery. As for enjoying
it&mdash;no; she was not supposed to enjoy her wedding, and a
wedding under such circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So in a dream she was wed; in a dream she cut the cake and sat
out the feasting; in a dream she kissed her father and her baby
brother, and the stepmother to whom she owed far more than she
realized; in a dream she went horseback behind her husband to
Fowey, there to take ship in the <i>Lottery</i> to London. Her new
life had begun.</p>

<p>There she saw the ship that was to be her home for the long,
long voyage. The <i>Venus</i> was only three hundred tons burden,
but she was a great ship to the girl whose husband was as proud of
his new command as he was of his bride. Her quarters were astern,
cramped and small Loveday thought them at first, palatial she felt
they were when she saw how narrowly the rest of the company were
stowed.</p>

<p>They were women, sixty of them, so ten marines and a sergeant in
charge were considered ample to insure good order. Gloomy and
dreary looked their quarters to the carefree girl peeping in. On
either side of the deck were small cells to be used either for
refractory prisoners or as rewards for good conduct, which the
sergeant had not yet decided. Otherwise there was just the deck, at
each end doors with iron bars like those to a wild beast's cage.
That deck was bare and clean as stout sailor arms and holystoning
could make it. Other preparations for the passengers there were
none. Beyond the convicts' quarters for'ard, and before those of
the crew were reached, there was a galley, where sundry tin pots
and messkids hung.</p>

<p>'But where will they sleep?' asked Loveday.</p>

<p>'There, there on the deck, my darling,' said Quested.</p>

<p>'On the bare boards?' The girl thought of the feather bed and
other comforts that had been provided for her.</p>

<p>'Well we have been told to provide nothing but pannikins,
messkids and a few tin plates and spoons. They are convicts, you
know.'</p>

<p>He did not like his dainty wife to see any blemishes in his new
command.</p>

<p>'Oh poor, poor things,' said the country girl.</p>

<p>She said, 'Poor things' again, when, on a dull dark February
day, their unwilling passengers came aboard. A bitter north wind
drove before it an icy sleet; the river looked grey and forbidding;
the thermometer was down just below freezing point; it seemed as if
the sun would never shine again.</p>

<p>Down through the mist, chained together, two and two, came a
line of figures, each bearing some sort of bundle. They were the
women whom England was sending away from her shores to start life
in a new land. Not that England was in the least concerned about
their starting a new life, all she wanted was to get rid of them.
Not six had any pretensions to youth&mdash;most of the sixty were
decrepit.</p>

<p>In those hard old days a woman of their class aged very quickly.
There was no decent, happy, contented middle-age for her, when she
was comely as became her years. She was young&mdash;then presently
she was old&mdash;that was all the difference. The wiseacres who
chose the convicts for New South Wales sent out old women. Possibly
they thought it well that the future nation should be born of free
women. Most of them were toothless: their mouths had fallen in;
their unkempt grey hair straggled across their dirty faces; their
clothes were torn and soiled, mere rags most of them, soaked with
the cold February rain. Each woman had a rough blanket, but
otherwise their bundles seemed woefully small. And the voyage would
take at least nine months, perhaps a year.</p>

<p>On the wharf stood ten or a dozen onlookers. One or two seemed
to recognize acquaintances among the convicts. They made little
offerings&mdash;of tobacco mostly. It was received, sometimes with
a jeer, sometimes with tears. The women seem too despairing to
speak, but now and again one would call to another some derisive
word respecting their miserable condition.</p>

<p>A well-dressed young man stood a little apart, watching them.
The jailers were hustling them, anxious to get the business of
embarkation over and to get out of the wet. It was a pitiable
sight.</p>

<p>Quested looked at his wife's face and then, with a little
dismay, at his passengers. The two foremost were at the bottom of
the gangway which was too narrow to admit of the passage of the two
chained women and their belongings.</p>

<p>'Dump those bundles! Dump those bundles!' called Quested. 'Here,
Quartermaster, send along a couple of men to hand up that
dunnage.'</p>

<p>But the women objected to parting with their poor possessions.
They trusted no one. The sergeant of Marines came forward angrily.
Quested was more merciful.</p>

<p>'Oh, my God! Poor wretches. It isn't much they've got. Let us
see that each gets her own. Send along half a dozen more hands,
Quartermaster. When's the rest of their baggage coming?' he
asked.</p>

<p>The head jailer hitched his head at the miserable women.</p>

<p>'They've got all their traps there,' he said.</p>

<p>Quested swore an impatient oath. He was a kindly man, old enough
to be pitiful, and he did not like to think of the unfortunate
wretches shut up on that cold, bleak deck, wet and uncomfortable,
and likely to remain so till they got into warmer waters. He saw,
too, that his wife was looking troubled.</p>

<p>'Go below, my darling, and get warm.'</p>

<p>'There's a gentleman wants to come on board to speak to you,'
reported the quartermaster.</p>

<p>'I thought we'd done with England for a bit,' said Quested,
smiling at the wife who stood beside him so proudly. It was
wonderful to be wife to the man who ruled this great ship. 'Ask him
to come on board.'</p>

<p>It was the junior counsel who had defended Joan, come to take a
last look at the girl who had interested him so deeply. He was even
a little ashamed of his own interest.</p>

<p>He came up that gangway after the convict women and stood before
the ship's captain, a goodly young man in a three-cornered hat and
a neat wig. He made a bow to Captain Quested, a deeper bow with his
hand on his heart before the pretty little lady who stood beside
him.</p>

<p>'And what can I do for you, sir? My time is short. We go in less
than half an hour.'</p>

<p>'I have not much to say, sir,' said the other young man, a
little stiffly. 'I take an interest in one of your unfortunate
passengers. Oh, nothing that your lady may not hear,' he added
quickly with a glance and another little bow to Loveday, 'but I
defended Juana d'Ath at the Plymouth Assizes. She was convicted of
horse-stealing and sentenced to death, but reprieved. Now I have
reason to think that there has been&mdash;hardly a miscarriage of
justice&mdash;but some misunderstanding. I believe, though
unfortunately I could get neither the judge nor the jury to agree
with me, that she took the horse under some misapprehension. She
felt she was doing the right thing. She wanted to rescue&mdash;her
lover, I suppose, from the press gang.'</p>

<p>Quested laughed. He knew all about the press gang, and the name
Juana d'Ath conveyed nothing to him.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'I could understand the situation.'</p>

<p>'Well, that being so, I want to give the girl a chance. I have
ventured to order a few comforts to be sent,' he glanced over the
side to where a porter was standing with a bundle, 'that might be
useful for the voyage, and I thought if I gave you £5 perhaps you
would take charge and might lay it out in the new country. It would
give the girl a chance to start a fresh life.'</p>

<p>'Why, you are goodness itself,' said Quested. 'Where is this
Juana d'Ath? She shall come and thank you herself.'</p>

<p>'It is hardly necessary,' said the junior counsel smiling. 'I
have only met her in the Court and the jail. But to tell you the
truth,' he said deprecatingly, as a man apologizes for a great
folly, 'she was so beautiful her face haunted me. I felt it was a
shame she had not a better chance, and I thought I'd like, with
your aid, to help her. By your leave, sir.'</p>

<p>He beckoned the porter to come on board.</p>

<p>On the main deck they were knocking off the women's fetters.
They could hear plainly the clank of the irons as they fell on the
boards, and a confused murmur, the women raising their voices, the
marines trying to keep them in order and yet not make them heard
above by authority.</p>

<p>'Quartermaster,' ordered Quested, 'tell the Sergeant of Marines
to take off her irons and send Juana d'Ath along to the cuddy. You
will come below, sir, will you not, and drink to our good fortune
on our long voyage. My wife will be honoured.'</p>

<p>They bowed to each other, and Loveday happily felt herself a
very great lady indeed, the simple maid of the farm was left very
far behind. It was all pure delight, touched, but not to hurt her,
with pity for the women who were to be their passengers.</p>

<p>Into the cuddy, quite a comfortable place in the stern of the
ship, with walls panelled in carved teak, came Joan. Her dress was
wet round the skirts, but her shoes, thanks to the junior counsel,
were stout, and she had been wrapped in a shawl, also thanks to
him. As the cuddy was warm she slipped it off and stood before
them, tall and stately and silent.</p>

<p>She knew them all.</p>

<p>There came to her a moment of exquisite joy. This Captain
Quested was the captain of the ship, and beside him was Loveday
Corthew!</p>

<p>So she had been right. Loveday Corthew had married&mdash;had
married the man who had been virtually courting her in those days
that seemed so long ago at Polperro. Joan had said she would marry.
But to be sure of it! The joy of it!</p>

<p>The look on her face was misinterpreted. The junior counsel felt
his own heart miss a throb, for she was very good to look upon, and
he thought it was for him, as indeed&mdash;not
unnaturally&mdash;did the other two.</p>

<p>Then Loveday recognized her.</p>

<p>'Why, 'tis Joan,' she cried wonderingly, 'Joan of the
Pilchard!'</p>

<p>She had heard indeed that Joan of the Pilchard had been
condemned for horse stealing; but the drudge of the fishermen's
tavern had had small place in her thoughts among her own
sorrows&mdash;and joys. She did not even know whether she was alive
or dead.</p>

<p>This was Joan truly, but Joan with a difference.</p>

<p>How should a simple little soul like kindly Loveday Quested even
dimly grasp what had gone to the making of a handsome woman out of
the sullen girl. She would have wilted and shrivelled before the
storm that had effected such a change for the better in Joan. Very
naturally, too, in addition to the gladness of seeing Loveday
married, came the flattering thought that the junior counsel had
found it worth while to come and see her, to bring her gifts at
this her parting with the old life. Never, surely, had a convict
had such a good send-off. No wonder Joan held up her head and felt
as few convicts can have felt that the world was at her feet.</p>

<p>'But Joan, Joan,' said Loveday, quite glad to see a face from
Polperro, 'surely you never stole a horse.'</p>

<p>Joan spoke deliberately, remembering the decent speech that this
man before her, the man who had defended her, had first brought to
her notice.</p>

<p>'I took Dick Penrhyn's mare to let you know they had pressed
Daniel Reynell!'</p>

<p>'Daniel Reynell!' It was Quested who winced.</p>

<p>'Daniel Reynell!' cried Loveday, brought back to earth from her
heaven. She had forgotten Daniel Reynell. He was far, far away. She
was realizing it.</p>

<p>'Dost mean to say,' for the moment Joan forgot her efforts at
culture, 'hast forgot Daniel Reynell!'</p>

<p>Mr. Henniker Hilton looked at these people in amazement. It
seemed to him he had dropped a bomb amongst them. Then he took
charge.</p>

<p>'Joan was sentenced,' he said, 'because a farmer accused her of
stealing his horse. She admitted she took it, but her plea that
this man Reynell had told her she might safely take it was not
admitted, because it was proved that Daniel Reynell was not
pressed.'</p>

<p>'He was,' said Joan, looking at them all gravely, and speaking
slowly and impressively. 'He was. I saw him in Talland Church
myself. He told me to take the mare. He was sure Dick Penrhyn would
lend when he knew how keen he was to get a message'&mdash;she
turned to Loveday&mdash;'to the parson to get him off and to
Raphiel Farm&mdash;to you.'</p>

<p>Loveday crumpled up and burst out crying.</p>

<p>'He sent a message to me&mdash;to me. He is dead&mdash;drowned
dead.'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' said Joan, still thinking of her speech, 'he has gone
to the South Seas in the <i>Bounty.</i> Dick Penrhyn,' she drifted
into colloquialism, 'her give I in charge, and if Parson did na
speak for her her a gone for sure.'</p>

<p>'Impossible!' said Quested.</p>

<p>''A saw men take her,' went on Joan, implacable as fate, 'in
lane by Pilchard. 'A followed she.'</p>

<p>Loveday had covered her face now.</p>

<p>'So it seems there was truth in her story.'</p>

<p>Quested stood silent for a moment. 'I cannot understand it.
Three men from Polperro were taken to Talland Church.'</p>

<p>'Four,' said Joan, thinking of her speech again. 'But Amos
Garrett was dead.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Quested, and the thing was clear to him. 'I
understand now. But it was no doing of mine.'</p>

<p>He looked from Joan to Mr. Henniker Hilton and then to his
wife.</p>

<p>But he was captain of this ship. Whatever his private feelings
there was much to do. He was starting for a new world in twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>'It may be true, or it may not. Sir, we will do our best for
your protégée, but I fear we must be sailing. You will bid her
good-bye now.'</p>

<p>The junior counsel turned to Joan.</p>

<p>'I have done my best for you, Juana d'Ath,' he said. 'I am
leaving with the captain's lady a little money and a parcel of
clothes to help you on your journey and when you land. There is
nothing to be done now, but in a year or so the <i>Bounty</i> will
be back. Then I shall make inquiries for Daniel Reynell, and if
your story be true&mdash;but'&mdash;he finished up
hurriedly&mdash;'unfortunately you did take the mare.'</p>

<p>Joan smiled. For a moment she was a very happy woman.</p>

<p>'I thank you with all my heart,' said she. 'I did take the mare
and I'd do it again.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come, come. You are incorrigible.'</p>

<p>He did not understand what Joan had said that had so upset the
captain of the ship and his wife, and he was at a loss to explain
the joy that was written so plainly on this girl's face. It was not
for him&mdash;or was it? Well, his own behaviour gave him a
comfortable glow. He took her hand.</p>

<p>'A happy ending to all your tribulations,' said he. 'The captain
here has my card and if at any time I can help&mdash;&mdash;A
pleasant voyage, sir, to you and your lady,' and he bowed low,
ignoring the tear-stained face that Loveday raised. No, he thought,
whatever it was that had disturbed her, it was not a tragedy, only
a summer storm.</p>

<p>When he was gone Quested curtly dismissed Joan.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Quested will speak to you again,' he said.</p>

<p>The girl walked on air to be locked in her wretched
quarters.</p>

<p>Quested turned to his wife and spoke to her constrainedly.</p>

<p>'We are just casting off,' said he. His voice sounded strange in
her ears, 'you'll understand I must be at my post.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Captain Quested!'</p>

<p>They were formal days. My own grandmother, a generation after
that, never called that gallant sailor man, her husband, anything
but 'Mr. Palmer' all her married life. Loveday still thought of and
called her husband 'Captain Quested.'</p>

<p>'Are you&mdash;are you angry with me?'</p>

<p>'Angry with you! My darling! My darling!' He gathered her up in
his arms and held her close, and looked down at her passionately
out of his dark eyes.</p>

<p>'You will despise me, and think me fickle that I love you so,'
she whispered with a sob.</p>

<p>'Love me! Did you say you love me!'</p>

<p>She did not answer, only clung to him closer, hiding her face
against his rough peajacket.</p>

<p>'Oh, Loveday! Loveday! I must go!'</p>

<p>He put her gently down on to the cushioned locker, and went
about his business of leaving old England behind, up on the deck
there, glad and happy and triumphant as Joan was in her miserable
quarters below.</p>

</p>
<br>

<p>At first even Reynell had looked at the birds with dull
half-interested eyes. It seemed mere waste of labour to try and
catch them. Labour of any sort was a thing to be avoided when it
took so great an effort even to move when movement was absolutely
necessary. Now, with hope re-born, he felt he must try for one of
those noddies that were swooping around them.</p>

<p>'A thread from your coat,' he begged of Ledward. The surgeon had
on a wreck of a coat that had once been red.</p>

<p>'Oh, help yourself,' said he hopelessly. 'I'm not ungenerous
with England in the offing.'</p>

<p>Reynell leaned over and cut away a fragment of the cloth where
the colour was brightest. He fastened it to his line and threw it
overboard as he had done a hundred times already.</p>

<p>He cast again.</p>

<p>And again.</p>

<p>With no result. Why weary himself?</p>

<p>Once more.</p>

<p>With almost hysterical joy he found he had caught a noddy, a
bird about the size of a pigeon.</p>

<p>'Elphinstone!' he shouted.</p>

<p>But there was no need to shout. The weary, half-dead men roused
themselves eagerly. Elphinstone caught the poor fluttering thing
and wrung its neck.</p>

<p>Bligh sat up alert and stern as ever.</p>

<p>'We must divide it,' said he.</p>

<p>'Only the blood for the boy,' pleaded the captor. 'It may put
life in poor little Hallett.'</p>

<p>'I was going to suggest it was your due,' said Bligh dryly.</p>

<p>'I will give it to him,' said Reynell. He paused a moment,
'gladly.'</p>

<p>This was but a small thing to do. If the boy improved it would
surely add glory to the day, a day that would stand out above all
others; the day that marked the turning point in a long, weary
lane.</p>

<p>So he cut a slit in the neck of the bird, put it to the boy's
lips, and told him to suck.</p>

<p>Mechanically he obeyed.</p>

<p>Reynell was rewarded by a faint brightening on the haggard young
face. He handed the noddy over to Lebogue who divided it into
eighteen small portions. Very small they were. The eyes that looked
at them were wolfish for each man knew he could have eaten three or
four birds such as that.</p>

<p>He turned his back on it and Bligh asked,</p>

<p>'Who shall have this?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Ledward.'</p>

<p>'And this?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Fryer.'</p>

<p>So it went on. As each man's name was mentioned he snatched at
the tiny fragment of flesh and crammed it in his mouth.</p>

<p>It was horrible; it was terrible; yet, if there had been any one
there to see, there was a certain dignity about it. These famishing
men had control over themselves; they could wait. If they were to
be saved surely such self-control should save them. There was a
little half-remorseful titter when the feet and beak fell to
Reynell himself.</p>

<p>He laughed ruefully.</p>

<p>'After all, anything the rest of you got don't count.'</p>

<p>'It has saved the boy's life,' said Ledward.</p>

<p>'We must get another.'</p>

<p>Now, men who had been thinking only of the severe racking pains
in their bones forgot those pains to watch the birds, and speculate
on the chances of getting another. Next day they did get another, a
booby, the size of a large duck.</p>

<p>It came in the nick of time. Lebogue, the old sail-maker,
Hallett, the midshipman, and Nelson, the botanist, were sinking
fast. The blood revived them, while the meat they divided as they
had done the day before.</p>

<p>Now the birds began to be more numerous. They caught four.</p>

<p>Branches of trees were seen in the sea, and they passed much
other drift wood. Certainly, Bligh declared, they were approaching
the reefs round New Holland.</p>

<p>Next day, when they saw white water&mdash;the breakers that beat
ceaselessly on the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;the forlorn,
hollowed-eyed little band raised a heartbreaking cheer for the
first stage of the journey thus safely behind them.</p>

<p>The anxiety with which they sought an opening was piteous.</p>

<p>They found it at last, and by noon were sailing through to water
that lay smooth as some great blue lake beyond. Straight for the
first island that lay in their course they went.</p>

<p>Round the island grew mangroves, their glossy leaves bright in
the sunshine. In their branches, sheltering in the heat of noonday,
they saw the brilliant gleam of parrots' gay plumage and numerous
great pigeons. But they were too weary to hunt.</p>

<p>'I see no coconut palms,' said Ledward anxiously.</p>

<p>'And I see no native huts or canoes, which is a matter of quite
as much importance,' said Bligh.</p>

<p>They drew closer and closer, seeking a place among the mangrove
to land. At last they came on a strip of sandy beach. As the water
shallowed Reynell slipped overboard.</p>

<p>So weak was he that it was all that he could do to keep from
falling face forward in the water. As for pulling up the boat, he
had not the strength of a baby in his arms.</p>

<p>But the wind and the water took her on.</p>

<p>She grounded.</p>

<p>One by one those weak, weary wrecks of humanity fell overboard,
and, crawling out of the water, lay stretched at full length on the
warm sand.</p>

<p>'The boat,' said Bligh, 'we must safeguard the boat.'</p>

<p>But all they could find strength to do was to take ashore a rope
and wind it round a tree trunk. Then they fell back on the sand
again.</p>

<p>Young Hallett was Reynell's chief concern. He lay there, a
little apart, like a dead thing. There must be food here surely. If
there were not then they must all perish. But if there were, then
it was a shame to let the lad die without some attempt to succour
him. So cramped was he, he felt that he could not go in search of
that food.</p>

<p>He crawled to Bligh's side. Like the rest, he was lying spread
out on the warm sand, as if rejoicing at being able to stretch his
limbs to their full length after a month in the cramped space of
the boat.</p>

<p>'Sir, sir, the lad will die if you do not give him something. A
morsel of bread, a scrap of pork! We must surely find something
here to make up for it.'</p>

<p>Bligh shut up his mouth as if it had been a trap.</p>

<p>'Reynell, I explained to you before, we all share alike. It is
waste of breath to ask me.'</p>

<p>'I will give him my share gladly.'</p>

<p>'To-morrow morning then. You have had your share for
to-day.'</p>

<p>'Sir, sir! He is dying!'</p>

<p>'So are we all. Fast I think. If he were my son I should say the
same.' He closed his eyes. The discussion was at an end.</p>

<p>Reynell crawled back to the lad. Lying there he looked at the
point of death. Even the warmth of the sand did not seem to help
him. He was not dozing as the others were doing. The excitement of
landing had been more than the weakened frame could bear. He was
sinking&mdash;sinking from starvation. Yet could he have had some
strong broth&mdash;some blood even&mdash;Reynell felt sure he would
revive.</p>

<p>But till he himself was rested he had no strength to seek out a
bird. Presently&mdash;&mdash;He looked again at the lad.</p>

<p>Presently would be too late for him. And, he, Reynell, was going
back to the woman he loved, to Loveday of the laughing hazel eyes
and sunny hair. Surely there would be a cloud over their meeting if
he let this lad die now that he knew so little would save him.</p>

<p>The bread was in the carpenter's chest along with the bottles of
wine. Bligh had the key. The only thing he could get at was the
pork.</p>

<p>Should he steal some?</p>

<p>The crime was terrible. To steal from starving men! A pigeon
cooed in the manchineel tree above, and was answered by its mate in
the pandanus palm opposite. Once these men were rested they would
not be starving long. But the boy would be dead and his
death&mdash;it seemed to him now he had thought of it&mdash;would
be at his door.</p>

<p>He crawled back to the boat and cut off a large slice of the
pork.</p>

<p>He was a starving man. It cost him a great effort to refrain
from putting it in his own mouth. He looked at his companions
sleeping, or at least drowsily resting in the shade, for the sun
was hot now, and they were dry for the first time since they had
left the <i>Bounty</i>. Not for himself would he have robbed them.
But Hallett was in extremity.</p>

<p>He went back to the boy lying moaning under a pandanus palm.</p>

<p>'Mr. Hallett! Mr. Hallett! See here, lad.'</p>

<p>He put the pork to his lips. The boy opened his eyes.</p>

<p>'It's no good, Quartermaster,' he whispered. 'I can't hold out
any longer.'</p>

<p>'Eat this, lad. For God's sake eat it quick!'</p>

<p>It was cruel to keep him in such temptation.</p>

<p>'What? Where?'</p>

<p>'Eat this. It will pull you together.'</p>

<p>The boy took the meat languidly. Heaven knows the fat salt pork
was an untempting morsel enough, but to see the boy eating slowly
made the mouth of the starving man, looking on, water. He had to
repress the strong temptation that came to him to snatch it away
from the nerveless fingers and crowd it into his own greedy mouth.
When it was all gone he turned away, shaking and trembling, for the
effort had been terrible.</p>

<p>He made his way to Bligh's side.</p>

<p>'Captain Bligh, sir. I have stolen some of your pork.'</p>

<p>'I did not think,' Bligh looked at him reproachfully. 'Daniel
Reynell capable of so mean a theft.'</p>

<p>His voice was hollow and cold, and cutting.</p>

<p>'Before God I have not touched a scrap. It was to save the boy's
life.'</p>

<p>Reynell's voice was shaking.</p>

<p>There came a light into Bligh's eyes for a moment that almost
made Reynell feel that his sin had been worth while. But others
were listening, and the voice that answered him was colder than
ever.</p>

<p>'I trust you will find it has been worth your while, for most
certainly I shall find a punishment to fit the crime. It is a
terrible thing to steal from starving men.' The words rang sad and
bitter.</p>

<p>Reynell's heart sank. Had he lost a friend, a friend he
valued?</p>

<p>Bligh closed his tired eyes. Reynell went back and stretched
himself out alongside young Hallett. In the pleasant warmth he grew
drowsy and dozed till the chattering birds overhead awoke him. He
watched for a moment the bright-hued parrots, red and blue and
green and yellow, flashing in and out among the bushes
opposite.</p>

<p>He sat up.</p>

<p>They were eating berries that grew plentifully on a vine, yellow
berries streaked with red, something like a gooseberry.</p>

<p>What birds could eat could surely not be harmful to men! He
crept across and tasted. They were pleasant and agreeable. He
gathered a handful and ate eagerly. Here was food that was better
than raw pork! Fool that he had been to commit a crime before
looking round.</p>

<p>But if there were plenty of food here it was not such a terrible
crime. He took some berries to young Hallett.</p>

<p>The boy ate, then struggled to his feet and joined him. He
shouted to the others. The wrecks and shadows of humanity rose up
and picked too.</p>

<p>The birds were flitting in and out, parrots and wild pigeons
half as large again as an ordinary pigeon. They were so tame they
hardly troubled to get out of the men's way.</p>

<p>But they had no firearms, and the weak hands had no skill with a
stick or a stone.</p>

<p>''Tis a pity,' said Ledward ruefully as he missed a red and
green parrot that flew shrieking from the branch he had hit, 'for
what we want is meat.'</p>

<p>'Let us look along the rocks,' suggested Reynell, 'maybe we
shall come across some shell fish. If we could make a fire then we
might find a use for that copper pot Linkletter has stuck to for so
long.'</p>

<p>Along the rocks, growing even on the branches of the trees that
overhung the water, to their great joy, they found oysters in
plenty. Could there be anything better for starving men? There went
up a great cry. One by one the men came hastening to join in the
search. There was plenty for all. No need to stint or divide! At
last they might eat their fill. The men fairly sobbed with
delight.</p>

<p>Even Bligh was stirred.</p>

<p>'Get a little brushwood together,' he said. 'I think I can start
a fire with this little magnifying glass.'</p>

<p>Cheerfully the fire crackled. They built it in a hollow, where
there were plenty of shrubs round to act as a screen, for they had
no mind to call attention to their whereabouts if there should be
any inhabitants to see.</p>

<p>Bligh brought out the pork. There was about two pounds left.</p>

<p>'Someone has pilfered,' he said, looking meaningly at Reynell.
Hallett had apparently quite forgotten that he had had any, 'we
will put the remainder into the stew. Then there will be no further
temptation.'</p>

<p>Reynell's heart lightened. He took that to mean that Bligh, in
view of their present plenty, was going to overlook the past, and
let bygones be bygones.</p>

<p>That night they fed well. It was wonderful how the lines
smoothed out of hollow faces, and the colour crept back to
deathlike cheeks. They cracked jokes and laughed light-heartedly,
as sailors will, sailors who are like so many children, living only
in the present, forgetting the miserable past, never looking
forward into the future.</p>

<p>'The worst is past, men,' said Bligh, 'the very worst. I
congratulate you. It will be a trifle to reach Timor since we have
come so far,' and the sailors agreed with him and talked as if it
might be a day's journey off.</p>

<p>That night Reynell slept comforted.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of plenty: oysters, clams, dogfish,
turtle, pigeons, parrots, and plenty of berries. What more was
there to be feared? Bligh spoke to him gaily. The worst had passed
for him indeed. The long weary voyage that began when they carried
him to the chapel at Talland was over; he was homeward bound, a man
with his mind broadened by suffering and travel; with his foot on
the rungs of a ladder that was to lead upward, right upward; that
would be so much easier to mount because he had just a little money
behind him and Bligh's good will to aid him.</p>

<p>Then the blow fell.</p>

<p>The men, who had been so patient and obedient when death was
ever at their elbow, leaning over their shoulder, now became
careless and disobedient, ripe for mutiny. Purcell, the carpenter,
was the leader.</p>

<p>'Me,' said he, 'I'm as good as Bligh any day.'</p>

<p>'No,' Reynell discouraged him. 'No one but Bligh could have
brought us here.'</p>

<p>Purcell jeered.</p>

<p>'Much you care for Bligh. Think we don't tumble to it t'was you
sneaked the blooming pork. An' he just said nuthin'. Dassent, I
guess.'</p>

<p>His sin to find him out now! Reynell quailed.</p>

<p>'I had to do it,' he said quietly. 'I swear I never touched any
for myself. I'm afraid Bligh will find a punishment. He said he
would.'</p>

<p>'Dassent, my bloke, dassent,' said Purcell. 'If he does you call
on me.'</p>

<p>'What for?' asked a quiet voice that cut like a knife.</p>

<p>'I was just mentioning,' but the carpenter's voice was not quite
so confident, 'as you'd be the fudst to say one man's as good as
another now.'</p>

<p>Without one word Bligh took a step forward, shot out a fist and
struck the carpenter a blow in the face. He was weak from long
starvation, so Purcell only staggered back.</p>

<p>'Mates,' he whined, 'he's killin' me!'</p>

<p>'Not at all.' Bligh snatched a cutlass from Mr. Fryer and thrust
it into the carpenter's hand. 'Now, if one man's as good as another
and you feel aggrieved you just defend yourself.'</p>

<p>'He knows I ain't no hand agin a trained man,' whined the
unlucky carpenter. 'He'll kill me an' let off the man as sucks up
to him, the quartermaster. We mun clem, but he may scoff the
pork.'</p>

<p>'Come on, you dog.' Bligh raised his sword threateningly.</p>

<p>The carpenter gave in at once, and dropped to his knees.</p>

<p>Bligh looked at him contemptuously, then turned away.</p>

<p>'You see, Reynell, the necessity for a stern discipline.' His
voice rang sadly. 'If I'm to get to Timor I must keep my word.'</p>

<p>Reynell said nothing. What could he say?</p>

<p>Death was to have been the punishment for any man tampering with
the provisions.</p>

<p>That night Reynell lay and looked into the glowing coals and
wondered how Bligh would punish him.</p>

<p>Punished he would be, he knew it now. But, surely, in the midst
of plenty, it could not be death.</p>

<p>Next morning he knew.</p>

<p>They were all awake with the dawn, cheerful and light-hearted.
Bligh set them gathering oysters and berries for the voyage.</p>

<p>'For we start to-day, men. We start to-day. We must not
linger.'</p>

<p>'Shall we land on the mainland, sir?' asked Reynell, for the
mainland of Australia was so close they could see the shore quite
plainly. It was apparently about half a mile away.</p>

<p>Reynell was desperately uneasy. What was his punishment to be?
He would bear anything, anything, so long as he was taken on to
England. Surely Bligh would not kill him. But would he take him in
irons? Not that they had any irons in the boat&mdash;but he might
use some humiliating form of restraint. The uncertainty nearly
drove him mad.</p>

<p>Bligh looked at him. Reynell saw great pity in that look. Then
he was again the man who had held them together through that cruel
month in the cramped boat. He spoke harshly.</p>

<p>'<i>We</i> shall not land on the mainland, Quartermaster,' he
said giving him his official rating again, 'I do not know what you
may do.'</p>

<p>Reynell's heart grew heavy as lead. Why should his doings be
separated from those of the others?</p>

<p>By noon they were ready to start.</p>

<p>They had been well fed. They had a goodly collection of clams,
oysters and birds all cooked ready for the voyage, and a great
quantity of berries. The men were grumbling good-humouredly at
having to resume their cramped quarters again.</p>

<p>Bligh took a turn up and down the sand. Reynell watched him
feverishly. Now. Now. What was his punishment to be?</p>

<p>Three times he marched up and down. Then he stopped in front of
them and spoke with deliberation and without a note of regret or
pity in his voice. Knowing the man, Reynell had not expected pity.
But what&mdash;what was his decision?</p>

<p>'Men,' began Bligh, 'could anyone have led you as I have led
you, brought you out of the very jaws of death?'</p>

<p>'No, sir. No, no, sir.'</p>

<p>'And do you remember when you chose me for a leader you invested
me with the powers of life and death?'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, sir.'</p>

<p>'You have no desire that I should abrogate that authority? You
would not, for instance, prefer Mr. Purcell here for your
leader?'</p>

<p>'No, sir. No, no, sir.' The response was unanimous.</p>

<p>'You remember we have still a long and weary voyage to go? Not
so bad as that we have come through, but possibly bad enough,
though it will not be so long, please God.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, sir.' The men were getting a little impatient. Where
was all this leading to?</p>

<p>'And now we come to the point. Do you not think that the man who
pilfers from a starving community, for whatever purpose, is worthy
of death?'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, indeed yes.'</p>

<p>And there had been berries within reach. All the while there had
been berries within reach. Reynell felt as if he had been looking
into the bottomless pit. He held his breath. Life was sweet! He
would make a fight for it, if he had to kill Bligh and take the
leadership himself.</p>

<p>'The quartermaster, by his own confession, has pilfered the
pork.'</p>

<p>Bligh's voice was cold, a little harsh, entirely devoid of
emotion.</p>

<p>For a moment there was dead silence.</p>

<p>'Not for myself,' Reynell heard his own voice speaking in
strangled tones, 'not for myself.' He did not want his shipmates to
think him guilty of a mean action.</p>

<p>The silence was profound.</p>

<p>He could hear the slop of the little wavelets on the shore, the
soft cooing of a great pigeon overhead, the raucous screech of a
parrot as it flew from one tree to another; even the long-drawn
breaths of the listening men.</p>

<p>'Now for that,' went on Bligh relentlessly, 'he should surely
die. But, I put it to you, great mercy has been extended to us. We
are here safe, we have every chance of reaching Timor, do you not
think we can afford to be merciful?'</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>A great load was lifted from Reynell's heart. He raised his head
and a sob burst from his lips. To be allowed to go on&mdash;to
Loveday. The men gave a shout. Purcell, the rebel, snapped a
contemptuous finger and thumb. Bligh saw it. Reynell saw it. The
seed of the spirit of rebellion! If this went on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Reynell's head fell forward again. Bligh would never overlook
that. He could not. But surely&mdash;surely he would not order his
death.</p>

<p>'I am glad you agree with me.' Bligh went on calmly as if he had
noticed nothing. 'We will give this man his life.' Reynell drew a
long sobbing breath. 'You understand men are often reprieved at the
foot of the gallows, and they are transported. Once they were sent
to the plantations in America. Now I hear they are making
preparations to send such men to plantations in New South Wales.
This New Holland,' he waved his hand to the mainland, 'is part of
New South Wales. Somewhere here, Captain Phillip, in the
<i>Sirius,</i> is making a settlement, probably about a thousand
miles to the south. Now you understand we cannot take this man with
us lest the evil spread. But we can afford to be merciful, we can
afford to make a thank-offering of his life to the great God who
has brought us so far in safety. We will maroon him here. Here we
have found food in plenty, his plight will not be much worse than
ours, and he may perhaps make his way down to the convict
settlement at Botany Bay. He has earned death by our own decree.
But we will be merciful. Launch the boat, men.'</p>

<p>For a moment Reynell stood stunned. He hardly knew what he had
expected, but not a living death like this. To be left alone on an
island off the coast of a land where, as far as he knew, only one
ship had ever been since the world was created. Should he protest?
Would Bligh, since he was obviously only condemning him to uphold
his own authority, be open to a plea for mercy?</p>

<p>He looked at his leader.</p>

<p>His face was dark and shadowed.</p>

<p>Should he try and raise the men against him?</p>

<p>Perhaps Bligh, looking at him, read his thoughts.</p>

<p>'Let me remind you, men!' came his incisive voice, 'once we have
dissension we are wrecked.'</p>

<p>The men moved slowly toward the boat.</p>

<p>'What is this, Quartermaster?' Ledward touched his arm.</p>

<p>'It is true,' gasped Reynell. 'I took the pork . . . for the
boy. ... He was dying. . . . I swear I never touched a fragment. .
. . I told Bligh myself. . . . I asked him first, and when he would
not give it I stole it. And there were the berries. . . . God,
there were the berries . . . better than the stinking pork. . . .
But I was too done.'</p>

<p>Ledward turned to Bligh.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he began.</p>

<p>But Purcell, beside him, was listening eagerly. Reynell knew
there was to be no lightening of his sentence.</p>

<p>'It is expedient,' came Bligh's harsh voice, with a ring of pain
in it, 'that one man should die for the people. Only he will not
die. There is plenty here for a hundred men. He can make his way
along the coast to the new colony. He has as good a chance as we
have. It will be no greater feat than we have accomplished
already.'</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>'Listen to that,' said Ledward, 'he could do it. So can
you.'</p>

<p>'Alone?' Reynell's voice was hopeless.</p>

<p>The surgeon held out his hand.</p>

<p>'Can I take any message for you, Daniel Reynell, though I would
not give much for either of our chances?'</p>

<p>'If you get back,' said the lonely man, and he felt as if his
tongue could never, in the time at his command, give all the last
messages of which his heart was full; he was dying&mdash;dying,
'send to Polperro, in Cornwall, to a maid called Loveday Corthew. .
. . She will be waiting . . . waiting . . . and tell her I never
for one moment forgot&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr. Ledward, we are waiting for you,' said Bligh.</p>

<p>Young Hallett ran back sobbing.</p>

<p>'It was for me,' he sobbed. 'I ate the pork. I will stay,
too!'</p>

<p>Reynell started. Two men together they might manage it. It would
be no greater feat, as Ledward said, than they had already
accomplished.</p>

<p>But he put the temptation from him. It would ruin the boy to
come with him. Surely he had not saved him for that. He was dying.
He would die with dignity. The bitterness was the parting with
Loveday Corthew&mdash;he was giving her up again. That could not be
altered by ruining a boy's life.</p>

<p>'No, lad, no. You mustn't. I won't forget your offer, but your
staying would be the death of me. You aren't strong enough. Go you
and rise in the Navy, and think of the men sometimes, and don't let
them say I stole meanly. I swear I never touched a bit of pork
myself. Good-bye, lad, good-bye. I'm glad I did it.'</p>

<p>'Here is my knife,' sobbed the boy, 'and Linkletter is leaving
his copper pot and Mr. Fryer sends his coat and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr. Hallett! Mr. Ledward!' called Bligh, who understood the
danger of delay, 'are we to understand that you, too, desire to
remain on this key. Mr. Ledward, you will cast off the rope.'</p>

<p>Reynell pulled himself together.</p>

<p>'I will cast off the rope,' he said, and his voice rang firm.
There was not a quiver in it.</p>

<p>Bligh looked at him.</p>

<p>He was heartened, for he saw admiration in that look.</p>

<p>Ledward and Hallett shook hands again and got into the boat.</p>

<p>Reynell stood till they were safe in her. Then he cast off the
rope.</p>

<p>Bligh took the tiller.</p>

<p>'Up jib. Keep the sheet to win'ard.'</p>

<p>The boat went astern, and as her head slowly paid off, 'Hoist
the foresail,' he ordered.</p>

<p>Reynell fancied that his voice was thick and uncertain.</p>

<p>For the only time on that long and weary voyage his men
disregarded him.</p>

<p>'Three cheers for Daniel Reynell,' shouted Ledward.</p>

<p>They stood up in the boat and faced him, even Bligh himself, and
sent up a feeble cheer. The sun shone down on the sparkling waters
as he stood, his back to a fan palm, looking at them yearningly; a
lonely, abandoned man, with all his hopes destroyed, and hardly a
chance of seeing his fellows again.</p>

<p>'Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!' they shouted. The tones were feeble
enough, but their earnestness brought the tears to his eyes. These
his messmates, were doing him all the honour they could, 'Hip, hip,
hurrah!'</p>

<p>The wind caught their sails. They steered northward.</p>

<p>He dropped down on the sand, covering his face, and felt that he
had tasted the very bitterness of death.</p>

<br>

<p>Eleven long months the <i>Venus</i> took to reach Port Jackson.
She stopped at the Canaries; she slanted across to Rio; she came
back again and spent a fortnight at the Cape, taking in stock and
plants, and preparing for the struggle in the roaring forties; then
down&mdash;down south, to round the southernmost point of Van
Diemen's Land, which they thought was part of Australia.</p>

<p>And at last, north again, with hope in their hearts, for were
they not nearing their destination?</p>

<p>Many were sick; four of the old women died, and two of the
sailors. The poor little bride was so prostrate with sea-sickness
for the first month that Quested was thankful to find he could
safely trust her to Joan of the Pilchard when he could not be with
her himself&mdash;and he could not most of the time. But Juana
d'Ath, who had been condemned to death for horse stealing, was a
very pillar of strength.</p>

<p>Loveday forgot her crime soon. Loveday always lived in the
present. When she found Joan was more capable of making her
comfortable than the husband who loved her so dearly, she insisted
on having her with her always. Quested had a small store-room
opening out of the cuddy cleared; Joan took up her quarters there,
and was recognised as one of the afterguard.</p>

<p>Her conviction, extraordinary as it seemed, terrible as it was,
had opened the door for her to better things.</p>

<p>Her childhood had been spent in luxury in her Spanish home, so
she appreciated the comfort that her association with Quested's
beloved young wife brought her. Such comfort she knew well enough
she never could have attained to in Polperro.</p>

<p>Her stately beauty brought the men of the ship to her feet.
Possibly but for those terrible days in jail under sentence of
death, her head might have been turned. But she knew that in the
eyes of the law she was a convict, no better than the miserable old
women on the main deck there; only the partiality of Loveday
Quested had rescued her from their lot. She was sure that not one
of those ship's officials who tried to make love to her&mdash;her
life had early brought her knowledge&mdash;would have married
her.</p>

<p>Yet the hopeless bitterness that had been hers as the drudge of
the Pilchard had passed. She was comfortably lodged, thanks to
Quested; thanks to the junior counsel she was well dressed; and,
perhaps, best of all, her trial had given her a good opinion of
herself.</p>

<p>The Judge who condemned her had thought she might be a power for
evil; her counsel, and she blessed him every day for it, had had a
higher opinion of her. She was determined, if she could, to justify
that good opinion.</p>

<p>They both, Judge and counsel, had spoken a different English to
that to which she had been accustomed. So did Quested. Loveday's
speech emphasized this. It smacked of her native Cornwall. Quested
thought it quaint in a pretty girl. Joan, seeing the difference,
modelled her speech on Quested's.</p>

<p>She was far older than her nineteen years. It was as if the
cruel experience she had gone through had crushed all the youth out
of her. She knew too much. She knew that this wonderful beauty that
attracted all men was a gift to rejoice over; but a gift that
compelled her in all things to walk warily. The universal
admiration steadied her, and neutralized itself. Not one of these
men was a match for Daniel Reynell, the man she had given her heart
to, the man who had never looked at her. She could not forget. She
was not the sort that forgets. Vaguely, she hoped to meet him
again, for were they not all bound to the South Seas! A very
shadowy hope, but worlds have been conquered on hopes as
shadowy!</p>

<p>One great consolation she had. Quested told her he had heard
there were no jails in the new land. The convicts were 'assigned'
for service to the settlers. He hoped to keep her as part of his
household, for she was necessary to Loveday's comfort, more
necessary than ever now, for a baby was coming.</p>

<p>Loveday was a kind mistress, indeed she, a friendly little soul,
made of her a companion and confidante, pouring into her patient
ears all the tale of her woes. She was proud of her husband and her
position as the wife of the captain of a big ship, but she was
wretchedly sea-sick&mdash;only happy those weeks, all too short,
they spent in port. She was miserable down in the forties, between
Africa and Australia. The seas towering above what, to her, was a
great ship, sent her shuddering to her cabin to hide her face in
her pillows wailing with terror. She was despairing, as despairing
as any of the convict women, when at last Quested came to her with
the glad tidings that they had sighted the Australian coast, and
that the days of their voyage were nearly numbered.</p>

<p>She cried a little then, and to Joan she confided.</p>

<p>'I shall never be able to go back, never, never. I shall never
see Daddy and the boy again.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, you will,' said Joan comforting. 'You know well enough
why you have been so sick and miserably frightened. You will stay
till your baby is born and then you will gladly&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Joan stopped. The gladness that was to be this woman's might
never be hers. She could not look forward to going back to England,
the man she loved beside her, his child in her arms.</p>

<p>'Do you think it is that?'</p>

<p>'Why, what else? Of course. Come on deck and look at the land.
Captain Quested will be pleased. It is lovely.'</p>

<p>It was not exactly lovely. There are those who have been heard
to say that there is a great monotony in the Australian shores seen
from the sea. But the bright blue sky overhead, the deep blue sea
below, these people of the <i>Venus</i> had been accustomed to for
so long that they hailed with joy the long line of blue grey coast
to the west.</p>

<p>After all these long months here was the land. Somewhere here
was their harbour.</p>

<p>Quested took his wife's hand. Joan brought up cushions and rugs;
a quartermaster came behind with more; Loveday was a very great
lady.</p>

<p>'Oh, this is really New Holland,' she sighed.</p>

<p>'New South Wales, they are calling it.'</p>

<p>The foolish name has stuck.</p>

<p>'And when shall we land?'</p>

<p>That is what Quested was asking himself. Here or hereabouts must
be Botany Bay. But there was no sign of a settlement.</p>

<p>'Nowadays, with wireless, cables, aeroplanes and swift steamers,
we can hardly realize what coming to the journey's end after an
eleven months' voyage was like. Suppose the settlement had been
attacked and destroyed by a superior power, or even wiped out by
savages? It was quite a possible contingency. No one knew what
manner of inhabitants dwelt in the interior of New Holland.</p>

<p>All the ship's company, from Quested himself to the feeblest old
crone on the main deck, and the smallest ship's boy in the
fo'c'sle, was on the look out for the settlement.</p>

<p>Quested's anxiety was sickening. He was heartened by a cry from
aloft, but presently his heart was in his boots again.</p>

<p>High on a cliff he saw a flagstaff with the Union Jack flying,
and on the shore a tiny hut. Two men were launching a boat.</p>

<p>Was this all that was left of the new plantation?</p>

<p>He turned away so that his wife could not see his face. He would
know presently. They were coming quickly.</p>

<p>'Boat ahoy!' yelled Quested between his hands.</p>

<p>'Ship ahoy!' came back the answer in regular nautical tones.
'What ship's that?'</p>

<p>'Brig <i>Venus</i>. With convicts. Captain Quested. Bound for
Botany Bay. Where's the settlement?'</p>

<p>They had flung the boat a rope now. The two men scrambled aboard
and prepared to tow the boat.</p>

<p>'Settlement? The settlement's all snug, only a bit hungry. Have
you brought any provisions? Any salt meat?'</p>

<p>'A little,' said Quested. 'But where is the settlement?' for he
only saw what, save for the flagstaff and the hut, looked like
untouched woods.</p>

<p>'Inside Port Jackson there. It's a glorious harbour, the finest
in the world,' declared the man in a ragged seaman's frock, with
all the pride of possession, the very first of Sydney's inhabitants
to dilate on the beauties of her harbour. 'Two of us are always on
watch to look out for passing ships.'</p>

<p>Quested laughed.</p>

<p>'We have not seen a ship since we left Table Bay. Can you pilot
us in? Can so big a ship get in?'</p>

<p>The newcomer looked the little sea-worn <i>Venus</i> up and down
from stem to stern.</p>

<p>'The biggest battle-ship that ever was built, the biggest that
ever was thought of, could lie right along side the wharf, that is
when there is a wharf.'</p>

<p>'Then for heaven's sake pilot us in for we are weary of the
sea.'</p>

<p>He turned to his wife.</p>

<p>'Darling! Darling!' he said incoherently, and kissed her and
left her to Joan.</p>

<p>Joan's own heart was beating madly. What was this new life
holding for her?</p>

<p>'Oh, Joan! Joan! Joan!' Loveday was sobbing unrestrainedly,
'thank God we have arrived! And you mustn't leave me, Joan. We'll
like it. We'll surely like it very much. And I couldn't get on
without you now.'</p>

<p>'How do I know what they'll do with me?' said Joan with a little
shiver. No one was likely to take thought for her.</p>

<p>So they sailed through the frowning heads of Port Jackson, and
the harbour full of wooded islands and points of land set in a
sparkling sea lay stretched before them in all the glory of the
golden summer sunshine. There was mercifully a cool breeze from the
south; the very smell of the earth was a delight; the fresh scent
of the bush was entrancing.</p>

<p>At last they saw the settlement.</p>

<p>Rough little houses built of any odd planks and of grass trees
plastered with mud, roofs that might have been thatched in Devon; a
bigger house, slightly bigger, a little apart for the Governor,
Captain Phillip; another building for a store house; occasional
tents here and there. There were strange trees growing in the
irregular unmade streets; there were stumps left where the trees
had been cut down; there was a field of wheat white to the harvest,
because the hot dry sunshine of Australia bleaches the ears. Behind
all was park-like land that rose in gentle undulations, and right
down between the houses trickled a stream that fell into the Cove
right opposite them.</p>

<p>A lovely land! A land of promise it seemed to the tired
voyagers.</p>

<p>'I shall love it!' cried Loveday, happy as she had not been
since first the <i>Venus</i> rose to the swell of the Channel.</p>

<p>'I may hope,' thought Joan to herself.</p>

<p>At the landing-place were red-coated marines; sailors and ragged
prisoners, some one or two chained to heavy planks; there were just
a sprinkling of women; there were some better-dressed men, the
officials; and way was made for Captain Phillip, who, in spite of
the heat, was in his naval uniform and cocked hat.</p>

<p>All the white population of New South Wales was crowding down to
see the ship that had come from 'home,' that brought
news&mdash;eleven months' old news&mdash;from the dear old
land.</p>

<p>His Honour the Governor was first aboard.</p>

<p>'Welcome to you, Captain Quested and your lady. A brave woman!
You are to be envied, and I am pleased indeed to see her.'</p>

<p>The Governor, addressing Mrs. Quested, let his eyes wander to
the tall young woman in a striking blue gown standing a little
behind her.</p>

<p>Joan was excited. Her eyes were bright, her lips red, there was
even a trace of delicate colour in her cheeks. In truth, her beauty
was such as to take a man's breath away, though Quested, with eyes
only for his wife, never saw it. As she was not introduced to him,
the Governor guessed she was not of any importance, and went
on,</p>

<p>'I am glad to see you have brought us some young women. We need
young women if this colony is to succeed.'</p>

<p>'But I am afraid we haven't,' said Quested. 'My passengers are
shockingly old; only a few young ones amongst them, and they are
not of much account.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I should have thought&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, you are thinking of Joan, my wife's maid. I am hoping they
will let her stay with my wife. She has been most useful, and I am
inclined to think she has been wrongly condemned.'</p>

<p>'They all have&mdash;they all have. I never met a convict yet
who was justly condemned,' laughed the Governor. 'But some, I
admit, promise well. I shall have all the place wanting to marry
that girl. Have you brought any salt meat?'</p>

<p>'You, too, sir! That was our salutation!'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' said Phillip, half apologetically.</p>

<p>'We have about twenty casks,' said Quested, a little damped.</p>

<p>'Any stock?'</p>

<p>'Two cows we have. One died, I'm sorry to say. We brought them
from the Cape. They are in rather poor condition. And that
ewe&mdash;she may be useful if you have a ram.'</p>

<p>Phillip shook his head.</p>

<p>'Sheep don't seem to thrive here. Nor will things grow well. I
cannot help thinking Sir Joseph Banks was mistaken in thinking so
much of this country. There is no soil like we have in the West of
England. Have you any poultry?'</p>

<p>'Ten ducks, three turkeys, two geese, about a score of hens, all
from the Cape. Nice work I have had to get them so far. If it
hadn't been for my wife I should have eaten them and thrown the
coops overboard.'</p>

<p>'My thanks to Mrs. Quested. I am glad you didn't.'</p>

<p>It was Joan's forethought, but no one thought of giving her
credit in those days.</p>

<p>'Could that pretty girl actually contemplate settling?' thought
the Governor astonished, and dismissed the thought.</p>

<p>He regarded this lovely land as a prison&mdash;a prison from
which there was no escaping. Though he strove to hide his feelings,
for he had the welfare of the colony at heart, his opinion
impressed itself upon every one he came in contact with.</p>

<p>'We can land the convicts?' asked Quested, a little damped.</p>

<p>'There are three huts down by the brickfields we can clear out
for them.' Phillip turned to the Judge Advocate who had followed
him on board, 'We can serve them out a ration of flour and salt
meat, and they must make shift to gather their own sticks for their
fires. By and bye we'll get some of them drafted out as hutkeepers.
But at present that is all we can do.'</p>

<p>'All!' said Quested. 'Why it's freedom! They'll be more than
content.'</p>

<p>'They'll be a marked contrast to the rest of the colony then.
Wait till they're hungry!'</p>

<p>'They won't be hungry surely?'</p>

<p>'Won't they? We're all hungry here. You'll be hungry yourself if
you stay here long enough. Come to Government House and dine this
afternoon. I am sorry to say I shall have to ask you to bring your
own bread. We are obliged to ration ourselves very strictly. And if
Madam will honour me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Loveday excused herself, blushing.</p>

<p>'Well you must allow me to place the hospitality of the house at
your service when you land to-morrow. You must stay until we can
find you a place of your own. Or perhaps you'd rather not leave
your comfortable quarters here. We can give you nothing approaching
this at Government House.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I never want to see a ship again,' declared Loveday
fervently.</p>

<p>At five that evening, when the heat was still great, Quested,
having put all things in train for the landing on the morrow, went
to Government House to dine.</p>

<p>He found himself at the right hand of the Governor, with
Lieutenant King opposite and the Judge Advocate at the other end of
the table.</p>

<p>The walls of the dining-room were made of rough slabs,
unpolished and unpapered, the floors were bare save for an
occasional kangaroo's skin. Quested was soon to learn that to have
a floor at all was to live in the lap of luxury; the heavy oak
chairs and tables brought from England were solid and good; the
napery was dainty and white; the silver was exquisite.</p>

<p>The house stood on a bit of ground from which all the timber had
been cleared. Through the open windows was a lovely view of the
cove, sparkling in the sunshine. There was not much of a garden,
only clumps of geranium blossomed, a brilliant scarlet, and a white
convolvulus had climbed up the wall and was peeping through the
window.</p>

<p>Quested was charmed with everything. He said so in the somewhat
stilted and flowery language of the time.</p>

<p>'And my wife is delighted. She loves a farmyard, and thought if
we could have a few acres here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>It did not seem to require this modest way of putting it, since
here were some millions of acres lying untilled and unwanted, but
Quested approached the matter delicately.</p>

<p>'You would settle?' asked Phillip. His surprise was
apparent.</p>

<p>'Well, it would require a little thinking about. I don't want to
decide hastily&mdash;with your Honour's permission. But I was
country bred, my wife comes of farming stock, we cannot see why
things should not grow here.'</p>

<p>'It is too far away&mdash;too far away,' sighed Phillip, as if
that had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>'I was to place myself at your Honour's disposal when I
arrived,' said Quested.</p>

<p>'And I am minded to send the <i>Venus</i> to Timor for
provisions,' said Phillip, 'but if you would settle&mdash;&mdash;'
He paused.</p>

<p>It seemed to him so unlikely that this nice-looking young couple
would actually consent to stay in this land which had brought him
nothing but disappointment. His sad eyes looked him up and
down.</p>

<p>'Your Honour will understand,' said Quested, flushing, 'I would
gladly have a billet ashore, at least for a while. I would like to
be with my wife till her baby is born. She is so young and in a
strange land&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I understand,' said Phillip. 'Of course it rests with the
people at home, but I cannot see why you should not have land, and
I can assure you you shall both have the warmest welcome.'</p>

<p>But he did not really think a man who was free to go would
actually elect to stay in New South Wales.</p>

<p>'My wife is enchanted with the look of the place, and detests
and fears the sea,' said Quested, fearing lest he should take the
offer and then repent.</p>

<p>'It is a lovely land,' said the Judge Advocate, speaking rather
apologetically. 'We have had nine months of gorgeous weather, and
three too hot. Even then, when we make up our minds to sleep
outside, the nights are divine. As for farms not flourishing, I
have sometimes wondered whether we do not lack skill and want of
farming knowledge. Besides, conditions are different. Once we
understand the conditions&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Phillip's sad eyes looked at him a little amused. How could any
place be good where conditions differed from those that prevailed
in the dear homeland so far away?</p>

<p>'It should be something to begin in a new land,' said Quested,
also a little apologetically, for men do not differ from a Governor
easily.</p>

<p>He knew now the command of a convict ship was not likely to lead
him anywhere. Without influence his advancement in the Navy was
very problematical. It seemed to him there should be more
possibilities here for a family man than in England. Even if he
elected to take his chance in the Navy it would be a miserable life
for him, with Loveday always tugging at his heart strings. She
wanted caring for. What had these men found wrong with this
country?</p>

<p>Nothing apparently.</p>

<p>The response to his last remark was cordial.</p>

<p>'You shall try it, man. King shall take the <i>Venus</i> to
Timor. You shall stay here, and if you don't make good you shall be
free to take her back to England. You and your wife and that
good-looking girl you have as maid are exactly the people the
country wants as settlers. If this country does succeed, as once I
hoped it would, you should rise to wealth, as the early settlers
did in Virginia. Look at Mr. Washington. The grandson of a settler
no better placed than you are.'</p>

<p>'I am not thinking of my grandsons,' said Quested, a little
damped.</p>

<p>'Ah, man, but you'll care for the son who'll be here presently.
If you choose to stay I'll get you a grant of land, and do my best
to help you.'</p>

<p>Quested asked if he might put it before his wife. But he knew
very well what she would say. There was a light in his eyes that
made the Governor feel he was sure of his new settler. King, too,
was well content. He wanted to go to Timor.</p>

<p>That night Loveday and he made their decision.</p>

<p>The next day, in all the dewy freshness of the early morning,
she and Joan landed. Loveday vowed she could not wait a moment
longer.</p>

<p>To these sea-weary women the solid feel of the land beneath
their feet was a delight. The cloudless sky above, far, far away,
seemed to show them ethereal depths, there were trees and the sound
of trickling water where the Tank stream found its way to the sea.
The faint breeze that came from the west bore on its breath an
aromatic scent from the mighty forests that lay away in the unknown
beyond there.</p>

<p>The two young women drew it into their lungs, hoped for great
things and saw nothing pitiful in the two little streets of mean
wooden houses with thatched roofs, and window holes protected with
a lattice work of twigs in lieu of leaded glass. They never noticed
the trampled grass and the broken stumps of trees, marking man's
sordid possession. They only saw the park-like land beyond; the
harbour full of islands crowned with green; they only listened to
the rich, haunting song of the magpies, and the ringing laughter of
the kookaburras, that spoke to them of hope.</p>

<p>'Lovely! Lovely!' cried Joan in a burst of enthusiasm. 'It is
surely a great thing to be able to begin.'</p>

<p>It was more than two years since she had stood a free woman
greeting the midsummer morning. True, she was a convict, but she
was happier than she had been since her father had died and left
her a lonely little girl at the mercy of a selfish peasant mother.
The freedom of the new life and the new land gripped her. She was
wise beyond her years. She forgot for a moment her servitude and
the lowly position which made any exhibition of feeling out of
place.</p>

<p>But the other two hailed with delight an enthusiasm that marched
with their own. For them a new life was beginning. They were not to
be parted.</p>

<p>'Right, right, my girl,' said Quested, seeing the colour in his
wife's pale checks. 'We are going to make a success of it. This is
only the beginning. Now, think you, you can take Madam up to the
Governor's house there. There it is, the greatest house, you cannot
miss it. He said she would be welcome any time. It was better to
come in the early morning, before the heat of the day. I am taking
him at his word. Say I will send a man up with her traps
presently.'</p>

<p>They went together to the Governor's house, a house where there
were actually windows, a house where dwelt the man who governed
from Cape York, in Torres Straits, to the southernmost point of
land in Van Diemen's Land; from the Pacific Ocean to the 135 deg.
of longitude, though most of those places knew just about as much
about their new Governor as he knew about them&mdash;which was
nothing at all.</p>

<p>There Mrs. Quested, being young in a land where young women were
at a premium, was received with such a welcome as overflowed, and
left Juana d'Ath with a feeling that it was a very good thing to be
alive.</p>

<br>

<p>For a brief space Reynell lay on the sand, then he scrambled to
his feet.</p>

<p>The boat was going! He was missing her!</p>

<p>Already she was a good bit from the shore. He could not
distinguish the faces of the men, the friendly faces that had been
his close companions through the long weary days.</p>

<p>In the end they had deserted him. For such a trifle. Foremast
hands should have stood by a comrade better!</p>

<p>But even as he blamed he understood.</p>

<p>Half of them were not foremast hands. They were men of
education. They thoroughly realized that there must be no
dissension amongst them. He could not even blame Bligh. Gladly
would that stern disciplinarian have reprieved him, but, had he
shown himself tender with the falling away of the man he had always
favoured, how was he to make sure of other men's obedience in the
next crisis?</p>

<p>It was the foremast hand who had done him to death.</p>

<p>Other crises there would be. That, Daniel Reynell, even in his
unutterable misery, knew well. Why had he confessed to pilfering
the pork? Once they found themselves in the midst of plenty a
trifle like that might have been overlooked. He had done what
seemed to be right. Now he must take the consequences.</p>

<p>He stood there straining his eyes across the empty sea, which
the little boat made more empty.</p>

<p>He spoke aloud the names of his mates, as if he already feared
he should forget them, should forget perhaps how to speak. First
low&mdash;lest they should hear him repining&mdash;then louder and
louder as the fear of loneliness grew upon him, and he cared not
what any one thought. Perhaps Bligh would feel he had shown his
authority, and would take him aboard. He lost all control of
himself. He ran along the beach shouting for the boat come
back.</p>

<p>His voice was swallowed up by the sighing of the sea.</p>

<p>The boat grew smaller and smaller, till she was but a tiny speck
on the horizon. She was lost to him behind a great clump of
pandanus palm that grew on another key.</p>

<p>He flung himself down on the ground again. Life had surely ended
for him now. He was broken. He lay cold and dead in the shadow. The
warm sun was beyond. But he only beat his hands on the ground.
There was no one to hear him, no one to see him, there never would
be anyone again. It was not worth while to move. He was outcast,
abandoned, forgotten.</p>

<p>His emotion wore him out.</p>

<p>He had been well fed. The sun coming round the bushes comforted
him with his pleasant warmth. At last, soothed, he slept&mdash;so
soundly that when he wakened darkness had fallen. He could only see
the loom of the bush round him, and the white crests of the surf
breaking on the reef. Overhead the bright stars of the Australian
tropics were twinkling. He noted mechanically, as a sailor would,
the glittering belt of Orion, and the upper stars of the Bear
lifting above the horizon. Another thought came to him as he looked
at the stars. The fire! The fire they had lighted this morning! If
he did not look to it, it would be black out.</p>

<p>He realized, with dismay, that he had left it so long it would
be the merest chance if there were a live ember left.</p>

<p>He gave himself no time to wonder at his sudden interest in
life, but ran to the little hollow.</p>

<p>It was all black. He could not see even a spark.</p>

<p>He cursed his own folly, for he had made life harder than it
need have been. He thought with horror of the way he had eaten raw
flesh in the boat, yet that must be his fate unless he could get a
fire going.</p>

<p>Then he laughed grimly.</p>

<p>So after all hope was not quite dead. He still thought how he
could make life bearable. He was walking about feverishly in the
darkness, moving circumspectly, trying with his feet to find out if
there were not a spark of fire lingering.</p>

<p>He found the place where the fire had been, black but not cold.
He could feel warmth yet.</p>

<p>He dropped on his knees, and as he knelt he felt the sharp
stinging pain of a burn! Never was pain more welcome. The fire was
not dead then! Hurrah! Hurrah! He found an ember with a tiny spark
of life in it still! Again hurrah! The hands that gathered cinders
and half-charred sticks round that ember trembled with excitement.
The cinders were hot to his hands; once or twice too hot to
hold.</p>

<p>He did not waste time wondering at his own thankfulness. He
searched for the dried frond of a pandanus and split it into long
straws. Delicately he built a lightly enlaced structure with the
live coal for its heart. Then he added a dry leaf or two and blew
softly upon his handiwork. The core glowed and deepened, a straw or
two caught.</p>

<p>He held his breath and blew again. The little flame grew. He
threw upon it leaves so dry they crumpled at his touch. The whole
thing went like gunpowder. A little sheet of flame!</p>

<p>He gave a shout of triumph that sounded weird on this lonely
key. Another leaf caught! The sticks caught!</p>

<p>There was no fear now. The fire was burning brightly, a jewel on
the darkness of the night. The first bitterness of loneliness was
conquered!</p>

<p>He fed that fire till it was burning bravely as if it knew it
was the only comfort of a desolate man. He lay looking into the
glowing coals, that danced and beckoned to him in such friendly
fashion. He fed them till he began to fear lest the fire should be
too bright and attract those who might take advantage of his
unprotected position.</p>

<p>He went out into the darkness and made the circuit of the little
hollow.</p>

<p>From a little distance away the fire could not be seen; the
bushes and the contour of the ground hid it completely. Re-assured,
he filled his handkerchief with oysters. The bright little fire
welcomed him back as a friend. He baked the shellfish in their own
shells. He would like to have gathered some berries, but it was too
dark. After all, to the man who but a short time before had been
only too grateful for a morsel of sea bird's flesh, raw, leathery
and fishy, the baked oysters were a dish for a king. He ate till
his teeth gritted on something hard.</p>

<p>He was about to spit out the offending scrap. A sudden thought
stopped him. He caught it in his palm. Something round and
smooth.</p>

<p>What&mdash;&mdash;? He held it in the dancing firelight.</p>

<p>A man in his position knew little enough about jewels&mdash;only
he did associate pearls with oysters. He had even seen small pink
pearls got on the Scottish coast. But here, in the palm of his
hand, lay such a gem as he had never before dreamed of. The
firelight gleamed on its softly polished surface. His excellent
teeth had made no mark upon it. Such a pearl might surely be worth
a king's ransom.</p>

<p>To him!</p>

<p>He might as well throw it away!</p>

<p>He lifted his hand to fling.</p>

<p>Then he paused.</p>

<p>Why throw away a good thing that had been given him? Perhaps
this was a sign and a token that all should be well with him.</p>

<p>Of course he was alone. Fear stalked behind there in the dark.
If he but stumbled and hurt his foot he must die a miserable death.
Even if no harm came to him, he might linger out a dreary
existence, day after day, day after day, till, an old man, he died
alone in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Why then had this pearl of price been sent?</p>

<p>He thought of Loveday Corthew&mdash;mistily as a man might think
of the joys of his childhood. She was so far away. Yet this pearl
seemed to bring her nearer. Here, surely, would be a competency for
her&mdash;and&mdash;he thought softly&mdash;her children, their
children. He lay back and held the pearl close. They said pearls
were tears. But this spoke of hope. A promise for the future!</p>

<p>All the way out on the long, long voyage he had thought of her.
How sweet&mdash;and kind&mdash;and dear she was. In the islands for
her sweet sake he had been deaf to the seductions of the island
women. He always remembered&mdash;sometimes a little
ruefully&mdash;how she had never seemed to understand his passion,
had shrunk from it indeed, had gently put it aside. When she was
older&mdash;&mdash;When he returned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then in the struggle for life in the boat&mdash;he thought of it
now&mdash;he had not thought much of her, save as a creature apart,
one who should always be sheltered from the roughness and
bitterness of life.</p>

<p>He would never be able to tell her the sordid horror of it.
Never. Never.</p>

<p>He would think of her&mdash;a little&mdash;not too much&mdash;as
a beacon light to which he was struggling. He was cut off from all
his fellows. He must face life as it presented itself to him. He
lay and looked into the glowing red embers, the dancing flames,
blue and purple and orange, the friendly flames.</p>

<p>He began to calculate as a seaman calculates.</p>

<p>Where was he?</p>

<p>Bligh himself had said coldly but with meaning&mdash;he might
reach the new plantations in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Would it be possible?</p>

<p>He remembered the last observation Bligh had taken. Botany Bay
was about latitude 32 deg. He was sure of that to a degree or two;
17 deg. of latitude away or perhaps 18 deg., with the coast of New
Holland, trending&mdash;from here&mdash;south with something of
easterly in it.</p>

<p>Yes, he was sure of that. He nodded to the flames. What was 17
deg. of latitude? 1,000 miles. A little more. Say 1,500. Could he
do 1,500 miles alone&mdash;on foot? They had done 1,000 in the
boat, cramped and starved, and always in danger of swamping in
stormy seas. Say he had to traverse double that distance, for he
could not go in a straight line! Say it took him a year?</p>

<p>Hopeless!</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. The laugh sounded weird and unearthly in the
stillness of the night.</p>

<p>He was dismayed because he found he had reduced things to a
year! He was evidently making very sure of striking the new
settlement some time or other.</p>

<p>He tore a rag from his ragged shirt, put the pearl in it
carefully, plaited a string from some of the vines round by which
to sling it about his neck. There it should stay till he reached
civilization. An emblem of hope! A dowry for the woman he
loved!</p>

<p>When a man has been starved; when he has been wet and sore, and
cramped in every limb; when he has snatched a broken sleep,
wakening always with the still unsatisfied craving gnawing at his
vitals; when this has gone on for days and days&mdash;for
interminable weeks, till he has almost reached breaking
point&mdash;then one day he wakes to find himself by a glowing
fire, well fed, comfortable, the cramp gone from his limbs,
thoroughly at ease. The horror of loneliness may be very great, but
the mere sensation of well-being, of comfort, will tell.</p>

<p>Before long Reynell was sleepily wondering if he were not better
off than those who had gone in the boat. If only he had allowed
Hallett to stay!</p>

<p>A drowsiness stole over him.</p>

<p>He could surely do that land journey even if he were alone.</p>

<p>Trying to calculate how best to arrange things, he fell asleep.
He slept soundly&mdash;dreamlessly.</p>

<p>Once he wakened to put wood on the fire. Then, carefree for the
moment, slept again till the bird chorus of the dawn wove itself
into his waking, and the sunbeam's golden path on the calm blue sea
brought him a message of hope.</p>

<p>A glorious tropical morning!</p>

<p>His eye caught sight of something white, or something that had
once been white, stuck in one of the shrubs, something that had not
been there the night before. Something that had been left for him
by one of the men, for even rags were too precious to be lightly
discarded.</p>

<p>He went across and unrolled a shirt, ragged and much worn, but
still a shirt. It was wrapped round a tool, perhaps in those days
the most precious a seaman could have, an adze.</p>

<p>Then Reynell knew that Bligh himself must have left it, for they
only had two adzes, both locked in the carpenter's chest, of which
Bligh had the key. He had given his shirt, too, the only shirt he
had.</p>

<p>Reynell lifted it up with the deepest gratitude, seeking some
scrap of writing.</p>

<p>There was something hard in paper in the sleeve. It was the
glass of Bligh's watch.</p>

<p>On the paper was written, evidently very hurriedly.</p>

<p>'With an adze and a burning glass a seaman may go anywhere. You
should rise to honourable rank in the Navy. Call on me at the
Admiralty and we will see what can be done.'</p>

<p>It was signed 'William Bligh.'</p>

<p>Not one word of pity, not one word in justification of his own
harshness, merely the assumption that they two would meet again in
England and that he, Bligh, would not only help, but thought him
well worthy of helping.</p>

<p>With an adze and his knife&mdash;why he could make a canoe, not
as good as those he had seen in the South Seas, but a perfectly
useful craft on this smooth water. And Bligh had thought of this
for him.</p>

<p>He felt the tears burning behind his eyeballs, but for the
moment he no longer felt outcast and abandoned.</p>

<p>Such an awakening he had not had for weeks.</p>

<p>The sunshine was everywhere. A little soft breeze, a very baby
breeze, rippled the calm waters into tiny wavelets that broke on
the sand at his feet, a miniature of the surf that thundered on the
weather side of the reef.</p>

<p>Innumerable birds, beings of rare beauty, greeted the new-born
day. With the dawn came flocks of white cockatoos, with sulphur
crests, screaming from the mainland; in the manchineel trees and
the pandanus palms great pigeons, black and white, stirred; others
joined them, clad in shimmering green, with crests like gay
flowers; he saw a hawk in the blue above and two kookaburras,
solemn grey birds with heavy heads laughed at him gaily in human
fashion. There were birds scuttering in the scrub that reminded him
of the housewives' chickens in Polperro; and numberless smaller
birds that flitted in the trees like brilliant jewels. There were
great graceful black swans with coral feet and coral beaks sailing
in and out along the seashore; there were sea birds beyond count;
and teal in plenty; he even saw a great sea eagle questing for his
prey. And he saw two turtle. Truly a goodly land. He had awakened
to a glorious day in the land of plenty.</p>

<p>And he had awakened to such awful days of long drawn out
misery.</p>

<p>He certainly was not physically miserable now. Bligh considered
he might hope.</p>

<p>Why should he not? All nature seemed to be saying it was good to
be alive. The pigeons overhead were murmuring it softly; the magpie
wove it into his haunting melody; the little birds, more impudent,
chirped it cheerfully. A right royal day. A day on which to begin a
new life.</p>

<p>He walked along the reef looking for oysters and other
shellfish. The pools in the rocks were gorgeous sea gardens,
brilliant in colours, red and purple, gold and green. The fish that
swam in those pools glittered in all the colours of the rainbow.
They could not escape now the tide was out. He tried to catch
them.</p>

<p>But it is no easy thing to take a fish with one's hands. More
than once the fish slipped away and went swimming down a narrow
channel, so shallow that half the fish was out of the water. This
gave Reynell an idea, he blocked the channel where the water raced
swiftly, and with a piece of stick carefully guided his fish into
it.</p>

<p>When it reached his barrier and found itself unable to turn in
the narrow channel he caught it, a long narrow, scaleless fish,
like an eel, weighing at least three pounds, he knew now that at
low tide he had an ample larder ready to his hand so long as he
stayed here.</p>

<p>That fish, with berries, made an excellent breakfast. His drink
was water fresh from the tiny creek that trickled to the sea down
from the thick bush covering the heart of the island. There was
plenty&mdash;plenty of everything for a sea-weary man.</p>

<p>The mainland was only half a mile off. He could swim it easily
if he were put to it. But he decided, since he was so far from all
civilization, to stay here and recruit. Not till he had recovered
from the hardships of the last month&mdash;not till he was
thoroughly strong, would he set forth to face the unknown dangers
that must await him on his journey through unknown lands.</p>

<p>After his breakfast, cutting himself a stout stick, he explored
the key. He judged it to be about three square miles in extent, and
well watered. He found no less than three running creeks, as future
Australians were to call all smaller streams. A goodly place. He
did not wonder the birds loved it.</p>

<p>Just as he was getting back to his camping place he made another
discovery&mdash;a bark canoe. It was very badly made originally,
and so damaged it had probably been left derelict because it was
useless. Still, its presence disquieted him a little.</p>

<p>He marched away from it very cautiously.</p>

<p>Then he went back again.</p>

<p>Clearly no one had been near that canoe for a long time. He
examined it carefully. He had meditated making a canoe, why not
patch up this one for the time being? It would certainly carry him
on the smooth waters inside the reef. Afterwards he might improve
on it.</p>

<p>He did not know how far south the smooth waters extended; he
thought Bligh had said about 600 miles, but whether it was 600
altogether or 600 miles south of this point he could not remember.
At any rate, he would go from here to the next key, which he could
see about a couple of miles off. The water was smooth as an inland
lake.</p>

<p>He went back and carried the canoe nearer his camp. Then he set
to work to make himself a stout club, ornamenting the end with
jagged pieces of oyster-shell and coral. It took him two days, and
when it was done it was something of a formidable weapon. All this
time he had not seen a human being. Now he felt more prepared to
meet them.</p>

<p>He mended the canoe, stripping for the purpose the largest tree
on the island of its bark, and sewing it together with the fibres
from the pandanus palm. He could not have been prouder if he had
built a cruiser. Though it was not equal to the graceful boats of
the South Sea Islanders, at least it would float. And it would
serve.</p>

<p>It took him a week to fashion the paddles.</p>

<p>Full of pride, he launched himself in his canoe, and found he
had still much to learn. Paddling and directing a canoe does not
come by nature, to a white man at least. It was only with infinite
labour he paddled himself the length of his own island.</p>

<p>Still he did it.</p>

<p>He was in the wildest spirits when he had accomplished so much.
He began to dream again of Loveday Corthew&mdash;of home and
happiness far away at the other side of the world. He might be back
even before Bligh and his men in the launch, at least he might
reach the modified civilization of the plantations of New South
Wales. Why not?</p>

<p>He felt strong and well, capable of anything now. He had filled
out the last few days. The strength had come back to his arms, and
the lightness to his heart. In truth, though he did not know it
himself&mdash;did not think about such things&mdash;he was leading
an ideally healthy life. The sun, that great physician, bathed him
in his life-giving rays. He had plenty to occupy his mind in the
present; something to hope for in the future; and he spent
comfortable, peaceful nights in the balmy, perfumed air, with the
little fire dancing and gleaming beside him. Plenty to eat he had;
oysters and shellfish, and fish; berries and pigeons and bush fowl.
The pigeons were so tame he felt it a shame to take advantage of
their trustfulness. But luckily for them, feeding as they did, on
the pandanus, they were tough, and stringy. The grey bush fowl, on
the contrary, were like tender chickens. They built great mounds,
too, and in colonies laid there their very large eggs. When he got
them fresh they were excellent.</p>

<p>So well, indeed, was the island provided with all that a
castaway needed to live that he felt some compunction about leaving
it.</p>

<p>But he could not stay here for ever. There were moments when he
was desperate for the sound of a human voice.</p>

<p>At last the day arrived when he built up the fire so that it
would last many hours in case he might have to return and put a
patch of hard clay surrounded by sand in the stern of his canoe for
his fire-stick. Then with his heart in his mouth he left his first
shelter to paddle to the next key.</p>

<p>His arrival there was a veritable triumph.</p>

<p>It was not unlike the first one, only a little smaller&mdash;two
miles to the south. He was fairly on his way. The great adventure
had begun.</p>

<p>Looking back, he saw that voyage in a series of pictures, vivid
pictures, where every little action, every hope and fear, stood out
sharp cut as the scenery&mdash;the sea and the land&mdash;the
pandanus and the tea tree and the bird life, stood with outlines
defined in this clear Australian atmosphere.</p>

<p>He guarded his fire carefully. To be sure he had successfully
started a fire with the help of the watch glass, but he was always
a little afraid lest that means should fail him. The glass was a
frail thing, easily broken. Besides he knew very well that even in
this land of sunshine he could not always count on the lord of day.
He always carried a fire stick. When he left a key he left a good
fire behind him. Landed on another his first care was to start a
fresh one.</p>

<p>He was hardly unhappy, for he was so occupied during the day he
had not time to think. At night he was so healthily tired that once
he had eaten and made up his fire he fell into a dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>There came a day when he struck an islet upon which he found no
water. His precious copper pot was empty. The only island he could
see was the one he had left on the far horizon to the north.
Without water he could not stay. He must go back.</p>

<p>But his canoe leaked. Feverishly he worked upon her. While he
worked a wind arose&mdash;a strong wind. He dare not put to sea.
His heart sank as he saw the sea rising and the blue sky overspread
with clouds. He could not face the voyage back in the frail canoe.
It might be the wind would go down. But suppose it lasted a
week!</p>

<p>The heavenly blue of the Australian sky&mdash;than which there
is none more lovely in the world&mdash;was overcast. Blacker it
grew and blacker. The wind dropped and&mdash;almost to his
surprise&mdash;it began to rain.</p>

<p>He had not expected that solution to his difficulty.</p>

<p>Mercifully it rained. How it rained! Straight down tropical
rain! He was thankful to see it. Yet it depressed him.</p>

<p>He scooped a hole in the rocks, watched it fill, filled his
copper pot and gave way to melancholy.</p>

<p>He would never see the plantations. There were no plantations.
He could never hope to see England again. Looking out through the
rain he could see the long line of breakers, their tops white and
threatening against the grey of the sea.</p>

<p>He found a place sheltered and dry for the fire among the dense
scrub and sand. He watched it anxiously, and as the hours passed
and he grew drowsy, he piled it with brushwood and heavy logs,
taking care that it should not spread, for he feared it might do so
though it was raining.</p>

<p>His depression grew.</p>

<p>He found himself conjuring up all the terrors he might meet.</p>

<p>He had heard of men with their eyes between their shoulders and
no heads. Bligh had laughed at the idea as a phantasy. Reynell was
not a well read man, but he had a certain seaman's wisdom, and he
thought that a score of savages armed with bows and arrows would be
much more dangerous. He was not quite sure whether the dragon was a
fabulous beast, and whether its haunts might extend to New Holland.
He wished he did know. It would not be pleasant to see a dragon
coming out of the sea in the driving rain. It would not be pleasant
in the sunshine either for that matter. But he had given it no
thought in the sunshine.</p>

<p>It rained for two days. Then it cleared as suddenly as it had
begun. The sun came out in all his glory. All nature was
revived.</p>

<p>But there were no more islands dotting the edge of the reef.</p>

<p>He must have made 150 miles southing. Reynell put his trust in
Bligh, and determined to go on seeking the settlement.</p>

<p>He broke into a new world when for the first time he landed on
the Australian coast.</p>

<p>Very troubled he was when he paddled his fragile little canoe
into a creek the mouth of which was set about with blue grey
mangrove, that curious tree that delights in the saline mud, a
condition which would kill other vegetation. It began to rain
again, and he went a couple of miles up the stream till he could
land on a little sandy beach. Forlorn it looked in the driving
rain.</p>

<p>It was warm rain, but the terror of loneliness seized on him
again. He trembled at every sound. An alligator rose up out of the
water like a great muddy log.</p>

<p>Another danger. Men who had traded to West Africa had told him
of such things, but this was the first he had ever seen. He grasped
his club for he did not want to leave his canoe; but it turned off
and left him untouched.</p>

<p>His fire-stick was only a spark by now, and there was no sun. He
gave his mind to finding dry tinder and lighting a fire, for he was
wet and aching in every limb. Never before had he paddled so far.
He was too weary to seek other food than the oysters he had brought
with him. He feared lest the fire he had set going might prove a
false friend, betraying him to the savages. The duck he saw on the
creek were wild. He argued they had been hunted. The thought made
him anxious and troubled.</p>

<p>But he had to sleep.</p>

<p>The dawn broke gloriously.</p>

<p>He had to rest that day. He was too weary to paddle. He had a
hook in the collar of his seaman's frock that he had been carefully
guarding. But now there was no reef with the friendly holes in it
where he might catch his fish by hand. He baited the hook with a
mussel and found he could catch as many fish as he wanted.</p>

<p>The land rose up from the seashore heavily timbered with trees
that were unknown to him; mighty trees, tall and straight, and
bound together with many a trailing creeper. The heat was damp and
steamy, but there was a pleasant scent of warm and growing things,
an aromatic scent and a smell of musk, with across it a sharp tang
of the sea.</p>

<p>A magpie, a pied crow, sat on a dead branch of a tree and poured
out liquid notes that made a song more delicious than anything he
had ever heard before.</p>

<p>A wholesome place, he thought, if he had not been afraid. How
should he not fear?</p>

<p>He rose up to listen, and suddenly there stood in his path a
tall, naked black man, with great wheals across his chest. He held
a threatening spear; his bushy beard was out-thrust. He peered out
at the first white man he had ever seen with little bloodshot eyes,
from under the overhanging brows of a man of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>For the moment Reynell's fears left him. If this were an enemy
he was a very ordinary one. He tore down a branch in sign of amity,
and with that in one hand and his club in the other, advanced on
the stranger.</p>

<p>The black fellow threw the spear, half-heartedly he knew
afterwards. It whizzed past his head. With a howl the thrower
turned and fled.</p>

<p>He picked up the spear. It was barbed, and made of stout
hard-wood. He returned to his canoe, and slept that
night&mdash;because he must.</p>

<p>When he wakened the ache had gone from his bones, and the chorus
of birds from the trees spoke to him again of hope. Still he was
more downhearted than ever, for if savages, like his friend of
yesterday, came after him in any numbers how was he to stand up
against them!</p>

<p>What was the good of saving his pearl? Loveday Corthew was
remote&mdash;far, far away.</p>

<p>But an unexpected pleasure awaited him. He found, to his
delight, he had thoroughly mastered the art of paddling. The little
canoe shot ahead easily, and went the way he wished her to go.
Greatly elated he went down the creek and out into the open sea
again, paddling on till presently the outer reef was once more
dotted with islands.</p>

<p>He began again what, for him, was the old life now, paddling
along easily from island to island. Sometimes he saw canoe-loads of
savages but he always avoided them. Apparently they were not
curious, or possibly they were afraid, for they never approached
him.</p>

<p>His days were wonderfully alike. It was generally fair, bright,
warm weather, with occasional tropical squalls of rain that came
with such force they compelled him to bale the little canoe.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he hunted for food. As the sun dropped to
the west, away over the unknown land, he began to look out for some
place where he might sleep. Having found it, he made a fire and
hunted for food before he lay down to rest.</p>

<p>There was not much difficulty about the food.</p>

<p>For vegetable food, if he could find nothing else, there were
always the cones of the pandanus. Not that he liked it, but beggars
may not be choosers. Fish and sea slugs he liked. Snakes and
lizards he ate for the same reason that he ate the pandanus cones.
He could not afford to be particular. On the reef he often found
sea birds' eggs, very palatable when they were fresh. And there was
a never ending supply of oysters, different varieties, some mud,
large and coarse, and some rock, a delicacy fit for an epicure.</p>

<p>Never again did he find any pearls. Indeed he had done well.
Though he did not know it, the pearls that are plentiful further
north are seldom found as far south as was that that Reynell
treasured round his neck.</p>

<p>His canoe was old when it came into his possession. With his
useful adze he had mended it and mended it, but the day came at
last when he felt it was beyond mending.</p>

<p>He made his way to the mainland in search of materials to make
another.</p>

<p>He was spared the trouble.</p>

<p>The fates were good to him, or perhaps they were unkind to some
one else. As he sought a suitable tree for his purpose he came
across, dragged high and dry on the sandy beach, a new canoe, sound
and whole, not as good, certainly, as those made by the South Sea
Islanders, but good enough for his purpose. Better than the one he
had made shift with for so long.</p>

<p>It was too much for a desperate man's probity.</p>

<p>He looked round. No owner seemed in sight.</p>

<p>Hurriedly he transferred his belongings, launched the new canoe
and paddled away as quickly as he could, fearing every moment lest
the owner should overtake him and claim his property.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>He paddled on till darkness fell, and landed on an islet by
moonlight with a fire-stick black out. Not till midday did he get a
fire going again. But the day was warm and pleasant. He breakfasted
on oysters, and put in time paddling to the next key, pleased
indeed with his find. It steered much more easily than his old
canoe.</p>

<p>He pushed on that day, anxious to put the miles between himself
and the late owner of his new canoe.</p>

<p>Indeed he was always anxious to push on. He had lost count of
the days. But what matter? If he arrived at the plantations they
would know the day. If he didn't what matter what day he died?</p>

<p>Strangely, he found he was growing accustomed to the life. Fear
was not ever at his right hand. The wheeling sea birds were his
friends. Sea and sky he had been accustomed to all his life, but
this was a sea and sky more gorgeous than anything he had ever
before known. Even the rain, when it came, was warm and
life-giving.</p>

<p>There is truly no more fascinating place in all the world than
the Great Barrier Reef on the Queensland coast.</p>

<p>Still, naturally there came to Reynell sometimes qualms. It was
so long since he had spoken to a living creature, and the new
colony of New South Wales&mdash;the plantations&mdash;seemed as far
off as ever.</p>

<p>Was it a myth? Was it a dream?</p>

<p>Only his faith in Bligh kept him with his face turned south.</p>

<p>He was a mighty man now, a great tall man of powerful frame,
sound in mind and body. No wonder the savages who saw him
propelling his canoe through the calm waters within the reef kept
out of his way.</p>

<p>When he had almost given up hope of a change, the change
came.</p>

<p>One afternoon he landed on a sandy island; not that he
particularly wanted to land, only it came right in his way. He drew
up his canoe, and with a lively recollection of how he himself had
stolen her, took care not to leave her in too conspicuous a place.
Then he walked across the island. The open ocean was on the other
side. The surf was beating in in great rollers. No canoe could live
in such a sea, at least not with him at the paddles.</p>

<p>He came back and paddled along the coast all the afternoon. He
camped for the night; sought his supper and slept. The next day he
resumed his voyage. The island was still there. When at last he saw
the end of it he knew that his pleasant voyage or his dreary voyage
or at any rate his easy-going voyage, had come to an end.</p>

<p>For the reef that goes up north for 1,250 miles of the
Queensland coast ended here.</p>

<p>If he would go further south he must take to the bush and
walk.</p>

<p>His heart sank at the prospect. The sea was a familiar danger
now, but what terrors might not lie behind that fringe of
greenery.</p>

<p>From very fear of the unknown future he spent all that day on
the island, gathering half idly a large store of sea slugs,
oysters, crayfish and other shellfish. But when he waked next
morning to another day he remembered he was not twenty miles nearer
his goal, that Loveday Corthew was just as far off as she had been
yesterday.</p>

<p>It was curious that a man, cast away as he was, should feel this
a matter of great moment, but he did so feel it. Immediately he
paddled to the mainland, gave himself no time to think, took from
his canoe all he felt he really needed; made a pack, and slung it
on his paddle, secreted the canoe in case he should need her
again&mdash;afterwards he realized there was no hiding from the
sharp eyes that were likely to look for her&mdash;and started to
walk along the coast.</p>

<p>Reynell found tramping a far, far harder mode of progression
than paddling. The soil was loose and rough, untrodden by foot of
man, or hoof of beast; the vegetation was dense, tropical in its
luxuriance. He knew so little of the real danger of the Australian
bush&mdash;woods&mdash;was the word he used&mdash;that he did not
know he should have been thankful for the damp weather that gave
him plenty of water.</p>

<p>He grumbled, for he was often cold and wet at night, and when a
wide river mouth turned him far inland he was still more
injured.</p>

<p>But he soon learned that most of these rivers of New South Wales
had a bar at their mouths; only for the larger streams had he to go
inland; very often, waiting for low tide, he could actually jump
across the narrow stream that broke through the bar.</p>

<p>There came a day when, with a creepy, eerie feeling, he knew
himself watched&mdash;followed without being able to see who was
stalking him. When the darkness fell he lighted with many
misgivings, a fire, and kept himself well beyond the range of the
firelight. He had set a snare in the darkness without much hope of
catching anything, but his larder was low.</p>

<p>In the morning, waking from an uneasy doze, he heard something
struggling and looked to his snare. He found he had caught an
animal new to him. It was only a wallaby, a small kangaroo, a
little beast with pathetic eyes in its deer's head.</p>

<p>He put it out of its misery swiftly with his knife.</p>

<p>Then up round him rose five or six black fellows, lithe savages,
with beetling brows, bearded chins, touzly heads, bodies ornamented
with cicatrices, bits of bone in their noses, and long spears in
their hands. They looked at him out of little bloodshot eyes, but
they did not attempt to harm him.</p>

<p>By way of being friendly he offered them the wallaby, though he
wanted its skin to make moccasins, for his boots were done.</p>

<p>They took it casually, as if it were not a matter of great
moment. Indeed they considered it theirs, for he was trespassing on
their hunting grounds. They broiled steaks on his fire, laughing
and jabbering to each other.</p>

<p>When the rough meal was finished they made signs to him to come
with them. Gathering up his belongings, for he was afraid to leave
them, he followed.</p>

<p>The blacks' camp was by a waterhole. To Reynell, remembering the
flower-clad homes of the South Sea Islands, these rough shelters of
bark, leaning casually against a tree trunk, looked most miserable.
Nomads were these people, he was to find out presently, with no
need of a home. Their possessions were a few spears and throwing
sticks, woomeras, while the very repulsive-looking women, whom he
was not allowed to approach, counted as their own the neatly-made
grass baskets so closely woven they would carry water.</p>

<p>There were some skins of animals about, some quite large.</p>

<p>Reynell looked at them with interest. He thought they were,
perhaps, dangerous though, save the alligator he had seen further
north, he had never in his life met a dangerous animal. But surely
there must be dangerous animals in this vast land. He might learn
of these people. Indeed he might learn many things of them. He
would stay with them a day or two.</p>

<p>The first night he was anxious.</p>

<p>But no one molested him. Each unit, almost each individual, had
a little fire for himself; only the children snuggled up to their
mothers. When the darkness fell in the hills behind, he heard, as
he had heard at other times, a quavering cry, weird, threatening,
long drawn out, and he wondered&mdash;as he had wondered
before&mdash;could it be wolves? Were the little fires protection
against them. He had so considered this.</p>

<p>He followed the custom, only he made rather a larger fire, and
made it a little apart. Yes, in view of that cry from the ranges he
must certainly stay a day or two.</p>

<p>At the end of a day or two he had found out several things. That
quavering cry, that sounded so terrifying, came from the dingo, the
native dog. He did not hunt in packs but singly, and though he
might be dangerous to a sick man alone, or a child if he were
hungry, they did not fear him. They feared something intangible at
night. He was rather inclined to think it was something not of this
world. In that case he thought it did not concern him. He had
plenty to trouble him without worrying about a ghostly enemy.</p>

<p>One trouble&mdash;and a pressing one&mdash;was that the blacks
would not let him go. The moment he made a move away from them one
or two of the bucks gently shepherded him back.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking their action. They intended he should
say.</p>

<p>The Australian savage has always been the most improvident
creature on earth, with scarcely an idea of personal property.
Reynell might have rugs, skins, baskets; they gave him the best of
everything they had to offer, eggs and meat and fish; they
introduced him to the delights of wild honey&mdash;almost anything
they had he was welcome to take save only a woman or a spear.</p>

<p>They wandered, hunting and fishing, along the coast, exactly the
way he wished to go. The trouble was they went too slowly.</p>

<p>But he knew now, a valuable knowledge&mdash;exactly what would
be most useful to him to know in this life, and he set himself
diligently to learn their woodcraft. If they would not let him go,
he would at least profit by his captivity.</p>

<p>Keen as he was to get on, he found much to interest him in this
enforced companionship. Never had he dreamed it possible men could
track as these men tracked. They could tell the movements of a man
or beast, by the mere bending of a blade of grass. A hair, a broken
leaf, a bent twig, a displaced stone, were as the opening of an
encyclopaedia to them. His heart sank as he felt the impossibility
of getting away from such experts. Still he persevered, learning,
because each day brought its new lesson&mdash;but sometimes
learning hopelessly.</p>

<p>Only not entirely despairing because he was in such rude
health.</p>

<p>The weeks stretched into a month&mdash;two months. It seemed to
him the last vestiges of civilization were dropping away from him.
He was a savage of the savages. He could understand and make
himself understood. He told them stories of the white men just like
him they would find further south if they would only go on a little
faster.</p>

<p>They listened. They shook their dirty heads, adorned with fish
guts and other abominations to keep off the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>There was a river they told him they would arrive at presently.
Across that they dare not go because it was the hunting ground of a
fierce and strong tribe who objected to trespassers&mdash;forcibly.
Arrived there they would turn north again. There would be a great
feast and he, Daniel Reynell, should be initiated into the tribe.
Then he might take a wife and be one of them.</p>

<p>That initiation, besides the loss of one of his excellent front
teeth, included various unpleasant, not to say dangerous
proceedings.</p>

<p>Reynell decided that he would not, with his own consent, take
any part in that feast. Whatever happened he had to cross that
river and risk the fierce strong tribe who objected to
trespassers.</p>

<p>He was nearly mad with impatience and anxiety before they
arrived at a great wide estuary. The tribe turned inland, skirting
the shores. His heart sank when he found himself facing west going
towards the heart of this great empty land. Suppose&mdash;suppose
it was impossible to get further south.</p>

<p>Greatly to his content the estuary became a river.</p>

<p>He made his preparations. Every night he lay down with his gear
ready for flight. At last, after a week's waiting, when the river
had narrowed considerably, he decided that the time had come. In
the morning his place should be vacant.</p>

<p>It was a still, warm night, without a moon. He made his camp, as
usual, apart.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours he rose up softly. The glittering
constellations of the southern heavens were, he felt, almost too
bright for his purpose. He looked out over the camp. Each little
dark humpy had a tiny fire in front of it, not because it was
cold&mdash;it was pleasantly warm&mdash;but in all probability the
inhabitants were sleeping soundly. It would be no darker.</p>

<p>Now was the time.</p>

<p>He only hoped that what they had told him was true, and they
dared not cross the river. If they could he knew well enough he
could not elude their vigilance for a moment. Also&mdash;it was a
disquieting thought&mdash;he might easily come upon savages who
would not be so amiably disposed to him.</p>

<p>But he had to risk something. Here he could stay no longer.</p>

<p>The night was full of sound. He could hear the river singing to
itself. Occasionally there would be a splash, some nocturnal beast
or fish, possibly an alligator. The thought made him shudder. But
it did not turn him from his purpose. An owl hooted softly.</p>

<p>'M-o-r-e p-o-r-k! M-o-r-e-p-o-r-k!' cried another night bird
again and again.</p>

<p>'Q-u-a-r-t p-o-t! Q-u-a-r-t p-o-t!' croaked the leader of the
frog's chorus on a deep, low note. His call was taken up by the
others in a higher key. He heard the pigeons sleepily murmuring to
each other in the trees, and the quavering cry of the dingoes in
the ranges behind. It was eerie in the extreme. Familiarity with
conditions made him feel safe this side. Now, once more he was
daring the unknown.</p>

<p>A branch broke in the bush behind, falling with a great
crash.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell gathered together all his possessions, for he
knew that would keep his too exacting hosts closer in their
lairs.</p>

<p>He slipped into the river, breaking up the dark mirror that
reflected the shining stars on high. The water was not cold. He got
across without any difficulty, and, clambering up on the other
bank, the air that was soft and balmy caressed his naked body.</p>

<p>Now he was his own man again, better equipped, after his weeks
of detention, to tackle the difficulties of a life in the wilds.
Far better equipped. It had been a hard school, but he had learned
much. If there were a settlement&mdash;plantations&mdash;and there
must be&mdash;there must be&mdash;he would find it.</p>

<p>He thrust the thought of other savages aside. For the moment he
was triumphant. He was freed from the unutterable dullness of
savage life. Now once more he could progress swiftly. He had a
strong sense of well-being. He set his face towards the east again,
and made for the sea.</p>

<p>In a couple of days he was once more looking out over the
Pacific. A little saddened, a little depressed. Then he cheered.
The sparkling sea held a welcome for him. He was well to the south,
and more capable of journeying in the bush than ever he had dreamed
possible. He set out with high hopes. He must reach that
plantation&mdash;that settlement, even if it were as far south as
that pleasant land where the <i>Bounty</i> had lingered a
day&mdash;ages ago it seemed to him&mdash;in another world.</p>

</p>
<br>

<p>'The brute has gone!' Quested spoke sharply. 'Corporal what a
devil possessed you to strike him.'</p>

<p>The corporal of Marines scratched his head.</p>

<p>'Sir, t'was the littlest tap,' he said perplexedly 'There's
never a man in the regiment 'ud have heeded it. An' they're the
cussedest, contrariest varmints&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But they do know their way through these woods, and I'm blest
if any of the rest of us do.'</p>

<p>Quested was taken with the colony. Under Loveday's loving care,
the vegetables, the wheat, the peach trees, the apricots and the
vines he had brought from the Cape were prospering. She declared
herself more than content with the little four-roomed cottage, with
walls of grass trees plastered with mud, a roof of thatch, and
windows guarded with the lattice of twigs. She knew now that
Government House held the only floor in the colony, but she was
satisfied with the skins her husband laid over the beaten earth.
When her baby came, in March, she urged him to leave the Navy for
good and throw in his lot in the new land.</p>

<p>She laughed very much at a sailor man on a farm, and made very
merry indeed&mdash;privately&mdash;over the well-meant efforts of
the Governor and his staff. The land was a good land. Her sailor
man should not make the like mistakes if she could help it.</p>

<p>Joan followed in her footsteps at first. But she was a cleverer
woman, more observant, so that she soon knew more than her
teacher.</p>

<p>Presently, so well were they doing that the Governor allowed
them, tentatively, and subject to the approval of the home
authorities, to take up land at Rose Hill as a farm. Loveday, much
as she hated to part with her, put Joan in the two-roomed hut to
run the place, going there herself whenever occasion offered.
Success to them was vital, and whom could they trust as they could
trust Joan. She was better than any man, and she could manage men.
Beautiful as she was, these two forgot to see her beauty. She had
impressed upon them that she was capable and trustworthy. And
Loveday loved her. When she found herself alone she always took the
boy and had herself rowed up to Rose Hill to be with Joan. Besides
the companionship she felt safer with her when her husband was
away.</p>

<p>It was a happy man who went out with the Governor seeking some
trace of the cattle lost by a careless herd soon after they were
landed. Cows in this place would be a godsend. Quested, a family
man now, had been urging this expedition ever since there had
arrived the most precious of children in a land where every child
was an asset.</p>

<p>With two black fellows as guides, they had gone on and on
through the tall gum trees and feathery wattle and black currajong,
wondering&mdash;wondering, for this was a new land and what might
they not meet?</p>

<p>There was the Governor, gracious, kindly Phillip, a slim young
Irish officer, Devereux by name; Quested, as a most interested
settler, and a corporal's guard of marines.</p>

<p>They had seen no sign of the lost cattle, but the country was
fair; lovely the man who had given up the Navy to settle was glad
to think it. They were trusting the aborigines, taking but scant
note of the way they had passed.</p>

<p>As the future Australians were to do through the years, they
were travelling light, with besides the Governor's just one
pack-horse for the equipment. Now the corporal had struck one of
the guides, and these irresponsible people had incontinently
departed, leaving the little expedition to shift for itself.</p>

<p>'Well, that settles it,' said the Governor. 'After all we have
gone far enough. We must go back.'</p>

<p>It seemed simple enough. Just turn back in their tracks.</p>

<p>'And we must keep a bright look out,' opined Quested. 'Those
Indians are treacherous brutes.'</p>

<p>'We'll follow the tracks of the horses.'</p>

<p>'Better get back to the waterhole where we spent last night,'
said Governor Phillip, as so many, many men in the bush have said
since.</p>

<p>'South by west, I think.' Quested looked up at the sky where the
clouds were gathering. 'We can't be more than thirty miles from
Rose Hill, at the very most.'</p>

<p>They none of them as yet were bushmen. Not one had grasped the
difficulties of the country. Though the soil was loose, and here
and there the horses had left traces, hoof marks and droppings,
they soon lost all sign of them. By nightfall they were still
seeking that waterhole, seeking it somewhat feverishly. They were
weary, but they were also very thirsty. It was impossible to camp
without water. Already their mouths were dry.</p>

<p>Here was the darkness upon them.</p>

<p>The grass grew in little tufts and tussocks, scanty beneath the
great trees, whose spreading roots made walking a penance even when
they could see the way.</p>

<p>They camped because they must. Phillip tried to cheer them with
promise of what to-morrow would bring. But his words had little
weight. This was the fourth night they had been out, and they had
not intended to be away more than two at the very most.</p>

<p>By dawn the thirst was bad. Not a sign of their passing
anywhere. Everyone was suffering, but the leaders had no remedy to
suggest. They must make for the sea and follow down the coast.
Eventually this must bring them to the settlement&mdash;if they
could find water, and the country did not claim them as victims
first.</p>

<p>The dawn came sullen&mdash;unlike a February dawn. It was as if
some malicious devil were tormenting them, for it was unusual that
the sky should be so overcast, the clouds so heavy, as to show no
sign of the sun. Whichever way they looked aisles of giant trees,
with their curious, long, blue-green scythe-shaped leaves, seemed
to radiate from them. They were the centre of a circle from which
they could not escape.</p>

<p>Monotonous! Terrifying! The air was heavy. The birds were
silent. A magpie began his liquid note, and let it die into silence
as if afraid; far in the distance a bell-bird called. It might have
cheered them with hopes of civilization, but they had been taken in
before; the parrots, blue and red and green, flew away into the
bush and hushed their usual screaming; one or two lizards scuttered
lazily out of their path; but nowhere could they see traces of
their own passing yesterday. Their eyes were the blind eyes of
civilization.</p>

<p>'We must go on,' said the Governor. 'It is no good sitting
still.'</p>

<p>It would have been better than going, as they were, right out
into the wilderness.</p>

<p>It was park-like country, with here and there a little
undergrowth. Every now and again they came on a hollow where were
tree ferns that rose out of a dense jungle of undergrowth;
tea-tree, and supplejack, and hart's tongue, and dainty maidenhair.
Everything was growing riotously; there was a damp smell of
fragrant musk in the air that promised water. But they could find
no water.</p>

<p>Again and again they came to such hollows. The sight of their
freshness aggravated their thirst. 'Faith,' said Devereux, 'here's
a patch of fern again. 'Tis good to look at, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We've passed that place before,' said Quested.</p>

<p>'No. Impossible!'</p>

<p>'We have. Now I come to think of it this is the fourth time
we've passed it. See, here where the corporal sat down in this
clump of maidenhair.'</p>

<p>'But that was this morning,' said the Governor.</p>

<p>'Yes. This morning. I'm afraid it was the first time we passed.
I can only blame myself for being a fool.'</p>

<p>'We're witched,' cried the corporal. 'I've hearn on it afore.
Black Davy, when he bolted, lost hisself, an' he said as he went
round and round like a squirrel on a cage. He only tumbled to it
when he come on his breeches he'd taken off an' left, being a bit
off his head like. He'd a died only the Captain here comes across
him. The country's bewitched.'</p>

<p>The Governor looked at Quested.</p>

<p>'It's true, sir.' He spoke reluctantly, for Black Davy had not
been six miles from his own farm at Rose Hill. Incidentally he had
started to go to China.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' said Phillip, dismounting, 'sit down. Let's take
counsel together. Of course we are not bewitched.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' echoed Quested, 'only careless. We
must&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped. For he was not careless. He was incompetent to deal
with such a country. Whichever way he looked he seemed to be
looking down an aisle among the great trees. This to the
right&mdash;this to the left&mdash;straight in front of
him&mdash;they all looked equally possible. They couldn't be
lost.</p>

<p>Yet all points of the compass couldn't be the right way.</p>

<p>The thirst was maddening.</p>

<p>He was chewing the astringent leaves, but his mouth was parched
and dry. He stood there looking up at the heavy clouds overhead.
Perhaps it would rain. That would save them for the moment.</p>

<p>But those clouds prevented him from knowing north from south; or
from east or west for that matter.</p>

<p>The air was very heavy&mdash;and very still. Only the shrill
stridulation of the cicadas seemed to emphasize the heat and the
dryness.</p>

<p>'We will unload the pack-horse,' said Phillip's voice, carefully
modulated, featureless like the country. He, like Quested, was
afraid, for he, too, had those dear to him and dependent on him,
though they were not in this country. 'We will put a halter round
his neck and tie a note to his mane. He will go back to his
stable.'</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>But there was no need to finish. It seemed to Quested as if he
were emphasizing their desperate plight. Even if the horse went
home and they raised a search party with black fellows as guides,
what chance of their arriving in time? And their situation did not
admit of delay. Men could not live long without water in this
heat.</p>

<p>Fear clutched at Quested's heart. He had been in danger more
than once, but this was a danger he felt himself incapable of
grappling with. He was a child&mdash;they were all children in the
grip of the wilds. The whole country was resenting the effort to
fix on it the chains of civilization.</p>

<p>'Whatever we do must be done quickly,' said Phillip, taking out
his pocket book and beginning to write in it.</p>

<p>They stripped the horse of all but a rope halter which they
loosely knotted round his neck so that it could be easily grasped.
They tied the white note in his mane so that it stood out markedly,
not to be missed; they led him out and smacked him on the rump and
so set him off. They cheered as they saw him disappearing into the
trees.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would have better luck than they had.</p>

<p>How long would they have to wait? Should they still try and push
on?</p>

<p>In half an hour that horse was back with them whinnying and
rubbing his muzzle against his mate.</p>

<p>They looked at one another with something like consternation in
their faces. What sort of a country was this? A horse that must be
thirsty, given his freedom, and he would not go back to his stable,
where his wants would be supplied. Men more conversant with the
ways of beasts would have seen that this horse was no longer
thirsty, and would have known how to make use of the fact.</p>

<p>'The darned place bewitches the bosses too,' said the corporal
gloomily.</p>

<p>'Lead him out a little way, Quested,' suggested the Governor.
'Once he gets right away&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Quested took the halter in his hand.</p>

<p>'Call to me,' he said, 'call to me.'</p>

<p>He did not understand how he could have gone in a circle and
done it more than once&mdash;he who had a seaman's sense of
direction. This bush was getting on his nerves. There was all this
great wild land&mdash;and that little settlement that they could
not find&mdash;set somewhere&mdash;somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They called. Down through the echoing aisles of great tree
trunks came their voices,</p>

<p>'Quested! Mr. Quested! Captain Quested!'</p>

<p>Fainter.</p>

<p>And fainter.</p>

<p>And fainter.</p>

<p>Now so low that if he was to have any hope of finding his
companions again he must turn back. He turned the horse's head the
way he thought he ought to go; wound the halter round his neck; hit
him a sounding blow; saw him jump forward.</p>

<p>Then he turned back and was glad and thankful when the calling
voices, hoarse with thirst, rose loud on the air again.</p>

<p>'I have done the best I can,' he told them. 'The nag certainly
started at a good pace. What next? Still for the sea?'</p>

<p>'It is all I can think of,' said Phillip.</p>

<p>They staggered on.</p>

<p>It was purposeless walking. Men who walked like that, thought
Quested, were never likely to get anywhere. Chance could not favour
them.</p>

<p>Then they heard behind them a rustling, the tramp of a
horse.</p>

<p>It brought them to a full stop. All turned, facing the danger.
Slack they were because they did not understand, but no
cowards.</p>

<p>There, coming through the aisles of tree trunks, was the horse
Quested had driven from him so short a time before.</p>

<p>But this time he did not come alone.</p>

<p>He was being led by a tall man with an opossum-skin rug slung
round him. He walked as if the world belonged to him.</p>

<p>'He has brought the horse,' said Governor Phillip. 'Perhaps we
can persuade him to take us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The man was advancing, a great broad-shouldered fellow, with a
shock of fair curling hair and a beard that covered his chest.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the lost men.</p>

<p>On came Daniel Reynell.</p>

<p>At last! At last! At long last! He had arrived! These were men
from the plantations! After all the toil&mdash;all the
weariness&mdash;all the hope long deferred he had struck men from
the tiny spot that lay in a vast waste of lonely land. His heart
was beating to suffocation. His head was in a whirl. His knees
trembled. He could not find his voice.</p>

<p>How long had he been alone? Six months? Seven months? More than
seven months, surely, since he had seen a white face, heard a voice
that spoke to him in the clear tones of his own people. It must be
a dream. Or he must be going off his head, imagining the whole
thing. For it seemed to him the man who was addressing him was
Quested, the naval lieutenant whom he had last seen standing
besides the scales with Loveday Corthew, long, long ago in
Polperro, at the other end of the world!</p>

<p>Was he mad? Had loneliness reduced him to this?</p>

<p>He tried to speak to reassure himself. But so much was at stake
his voice broke, and died away in something like a sob.</p>

<p>'A white savage!' cried the Governor in surprise, and broke the
spell.</p>

<p>'The devil!' cried Quested.</p>

<p>Reynell's heart missed a beat. It was not a dream then. He was
not mad. This was Quested!</p>

<p>'Bejabers!' said Devereux, 'it wouldn't be meself 'ud like to be
meetin' the likes av him by me lonesome.'</p>

<p>Then Reynell found his tongue.</p>

<p>'I'm no savage,' said he, 'only a castaway at your service. The
real savages have been following you for a couple of days. They
sent and let me know you were here.' His voice was shaking. 'Is
this the settlement at Botany Bay Bligh told me to make for?'</p>

<p>Discipline was forgotten. All the little company broke into
comment. One of Bligh's men! A castaway! He wanted help then more
than they did! The disappointment was intense.</p>

<p>'The nearest house is at Rose Hill,' said the Governor, and he
took credit to himself that he spoke calmly, and explained things
courteously to this man who was putting off their only hope of
rescue by bringing back the horse, 'all of thirty miles away. But
we are lost. We hoped the horse would find his way to his stable
and there they would see the note tied to his
mane&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What note?'</p>

<p>Reynell looked at the horse. There was a red wound ploughed
along his crest. It was only skin deep, but that white note had
made an excellent target for a spear.</p>

<p>'The Indians have been watching you,' said Reynell. He drew a
long sigh of relief. It would have been so very easy to have come
upon the scene after the frightened savages had worked their will
on these white strangers who were invading their hunting grounds.
'He never would have reached his stable. They would have speared
him long before. Is the settlement really only thirty miles away? I
have been hearing rumours of strangers&mdash;but I have been
disappointed so often&mdash;I have hoped for so
long&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He could have flung himself on the ground and cried and sobbed
like a child. And Quested&mdash;&mdash;Was this Quested? He must
put it to the test?</p>

<p>'Are you Lieutenant Quested?'</p>

<p>Quested stared at him, startled.</p>

<p>'Yes, of course. But how do you&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'And I am not dreaming! Do you remember the fish scales at
Polperro? And the night when the wind came up from the south with a
spring tide? Oh, but you were not there that night?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;Polperro&mdash;&mdash;We are dying of thirst and I am
going off my head,' cried Quested.</p>

<p>'No. I can mend the thirst though, and I am Daniel Reynell, from
Polperro. Didn't you hear of me? And now I come from the Great
Barrier Reef, and before that from Bligh's ship, the <i>Bounty</i>.
But how are you lost?'</p>

<p>'Get us to water,' came the Governor's eager voice, 'then we can
explain things.'</p>

<p>'In twenty minutes,' said Reynell, 'less if you walk fast.
Follow me, but don't meddle with the Indians. I don't think they
will harm you now. They could have killed you any time they pleased
these last two days. Your only chance would be to slip away in the
dark.'</p>

<p>'Faith, it's far we'd get in the dark,' said Devereux. 'With all
the daylight we could get we've tangled ourselves up nicely. And
not so much as a hair have we seen of the Indians. It's scared we'd
have been if we'd known they were on the watch without showing
up.'</p>

<p>Quite simply and easily Reynell led them to a waterhole set in
the midst of great blue gums. There were the waxen cups of
waterlilies, blue and white, floating on its surface; there was
fresh green maidenhair fern growing among the reeds and tall rushes
on its banks. The parched men flung themselves face downwards and
drank and drank.</p>

<p>Daniel Reynell come to life! What would Loveday say! But Quested
did not doubt his wife's feelings.</p>

<p>'And now we can eat,' said Devereux. 'And then perhaps our
preserver can show us the nearest way home.'</p>

<p>'Can you?' asked the Governor. 'But how should you, when we
don't know the way ourselves?'</p>

<p>'But your tracks should be easily followed. I've been following
them for half a day.'</p>

<p>'Impossible! We've lost them, or we didn't make any.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you made them. I've wasted some months of my life if I
can't take you home.'</p>

<p>'Tell us how you came here,' suggested the Governor, as the
corporal directed by young Devereux, spread out the scanty remnant
of their food before them.</p>

<p>So Reynell, watching them eat, and eating when he was offered
civilized food, told them the tale of his pressing; of the long
voyage of the <i>Bounty;</i> of the shipping of the breadfruit: of
the mutiny; of the long, long voyage in the boat, and then of his
crime and its punishment. In proof of the truth of his statement he
produced Bligh's letter.</p>

<p>Nothing he hid. He told the story to Phillip, but his eyes kept
wandering to Quested; Quested who knew Polperro, who knew Loveday;
Quested of whom he had been jealous.</p>

<p>He felt like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>He kept saying to himself, so far have I got. The very worst is
over. I am on the home stretch. I am reaching the last port of
call, and Loveday&mdash;Loveday&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, Loveday filled all his thoughts. He wanted to ask Quested
about her. But he had wanted so much he was shy now at mentioning
her name. Besides, he had waited so long now he could wait a little
longer for the opportunity that was sure to come.</p>

<p>She filled all Quested's thoughts, too. He could not but
remember that unlucky engagement. Surely Reynell was not thinking
of Loveday now, after all these years. Whatever he was thinking he
could not rush at him and say,</p>

<p>'I have married the girl to whom you were engaged. She thought
you were dead.'</p>

<p>He might have said that all Polperro had mourned him as dead,
but somehow he didn't. He only felt uncomfortable and guilty. Yet
he was thankful. This man said he could take them back. He
remembered that day in Polperro when he had looked at his stalwart
proportions and wanted him for the King's ships. So the King's ship
had got him. And if he had not turned up in the very nick of time
Loveday would surely have been a widow and her child&mdash;his
child&mdash;fatherless.</p>

<p>'But how can you tell north from south when there is no sun, as
there was none all yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Even you can tell on which side of the trees the sun falls once
you think about it. See here. And here.'</p>

<p>So simple as that! Well, every thing is simple once you know the
way. The way to tell this man he had married Loveday Corthew would
perhaps come as simply if he waited. Possibly he, too, had
forgotten. So strenuous a time must have driven all other desires
from a man's heart. Those South Sea women were seductive. Reynell
had acknowledged that.</p>

<p>But Loveday was charming, thought her loyal husband, thankful
and feeling guilty at the same time.</p>

<p>'Be the powers,' said Devereux, 'I beg to suggest that we get
this gentleman to display the tracking ability he talks of so
lightly. It's meself is just wearying to be sure of seeing the
farms at Rose Hill. Not that I'm doubting him,' he laughed,
saluting Reynell, 'but it's trying time we've put in, an' I'd like
to be sure.'</p>

<p>Reynell echoed his laugh. Now he came to think of it, he had not
laughed aloud for a very long time.</p>

<p>'If you only knew,' he said, 'I'd like to be sure myself. I have
hoped so long I can't help being afraid this may be all a dream.
I'll wake to find myself by a black fellow's fire, or paddling
along the Great Barrier. To meet Captain Quested here! And I saw
him last in Polperro!'</p>

<p>Quested waved his hand.</p>

<p>'Will you lead then? We will follow.'</p>

<p>Could he have said, 'And Captain Quested has married your
sweetheart?'</p>

<p>No. He couldn't. Alone, he would have found it difficult. Before
these others it was distinctly impossible. All sorts of things
stood in the way. Reynell was a lower deck hand, too. He did not
like putting himself in the position of rival to a lower deck
hand.</p>

<p>But he was so uncomfortable that he found himself managing that
Reynell could not have speech alone with him.</p>

<p>The Governor marvelled at this man's skill. He showed them their
own tracks when they doubted. Next day they found themselves in
country that they, unobservant as they were, remembered. Towards
late afternoon it was quite familiar. Reynell's own heart was
beating high, for he saw at last signs he had looked for in vain
ever since he had landed on Australian shores, the signs of the
white man's presence, of his destroying hand. Never had such signs
been so welcome.</p>

<p>'Rose Hill,' they cried with one voice.</p>

<p>Reynell sat clown, for he felt the earth rising up to hit his
face.</p>

<p>He had come through. At last he had come through. It was no
dream.</p>

<p>'You have tracked like an Indian himself,' said the Governor,
much moved. 'How are we to thank you!'</p>

<p>'You need not thank me at all, sir. It is you who have done me a
far greater service than ever I have done you. Any of the black
fellows could have done the same had you asked them.'</p>

<p>'You must remember we didn't even know the Indians were there.
I'm inclined to think we might have been somewhat alarmed if we had
known it. To be watched without being able to get a glimpse of the
watchers.'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. Governor Phillip had hoped great
things for this colony. But more than once he had found himself up
against circumstances that were too much for him.</p>

<p>'Faith,' said cheerful young Devereux, 'your lady'll be thanking
this gentleman for bringing her husband back to her. Did you say
she'd be waiting for us at Rose Hill?'</p>

<p>'And very anxious and troubled I'm afraid she'll be,' said
Quested, carefully keeping his eyes from Reynell. 'I never thought
to be away so long.'</p>

<p>So Quested was married! Good luck to him! And he had actually
been jealous of him!</p>

<p>'I'd like,' said Reynell, smiling and turning to Quested, 'to
get hold of some garments before you present me to your lady.'</p>

<p>'And where are we to get hold of anything to cover so fine a
specimen of manhood in this poor colony,' mused the Governor.
'We'll have to appeal to Joan, I suppose, as usual.'</p>

<p>Yes, they really had arrived. These men were at their ease at
last, making the little jokes that grow up in a family, that only
please when men's minds are at rest.</p>

<p>And Quested said nothing. How could he indeed? It was an
impossible situation. He was uneasy. Had this man forgotten? He was
quite sure about Loveday. Only what would she say?</p>

<p>Reynell was walking on air.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a>
</h2>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:10%"><i>'Many pastors have destroyed my
vineyard,<br>
they have trodden my portion underfoot,<br>
they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.'</i>
</p>
<br>

<p>Just as the sun was declining to his setting, from a little rise
Daniel Reynell&mdash;thankfully&mdash;caught his first glimpse of
the beginnings of the civilization from which he had been parted
for so long.</p>

<p>It was a very humble beginning, really just a spoiling of a
beautiful picture. The Parramatta River was at the very head of
Port Jackson and there&mdash;just where the fresh water
began&mdash;close down to it&mdash;for water was the great
necessity of the settler&mdash;was a hut of slabs with a bark roof
that Quested considered was a great advance on the ordinary roof of
thatch. It was quite a large hut, as huts went in those days, ten
feet by twenty, two rooms, with a little lean-to behind for a
kitchen, and window places with shutters of wood, to be closed when
it rained.</p>

<p>Some of the 'native trees' as they called the eucalyptus and
wattle, had been cut down to build the hut and clear the place for
a garden. About a couple of acres were surrounded by a rough bush
fence of logs and odd roots and branches. It was February, and
spite of all Joan's care some of the garden was a little parched
though the part she managed to keep watered grew riotously.</p>

<p>There was the rich dark green of half-a-dozen little orange
trees; the scent of their white bridal blossom was in the air; the
little apricot and peach trees were in full leaf, with a fruit or
two nestling among the greenery; there were some spikes of maize
ready for cutting, and about an acre of wheat was already in stooks
waiting to be stacked. It was a late harvest, but they were late
with things for many a long day after the early pioneers, for they
had a habit of regarding this country as the Antipodes, where
things must be exactly opposite to what they were in England.
Therefore had they arranged for their harvest to be in February
which they considered the same as an English August. Even a sailor
knows that August is the month for harvest.</p>

<p>Stock had not been forgotten. There was a black and white nanny
goat tethered in one corner, and in another, carefully fenced off,
some chickens were scratching. There were turkeys too, and tame
ducks, and some geese on the river. A settler's home.</p>

<p>Reynell's heart beat high.</p>

<p>How thankful he was to see these crude beginnings, so thankful
he had no words. But most of all did that little house appeal to
him, the little house where Quested, the lucky beggar, had a wife.
A geranium from the Cape climbed up the wall; one corner was
smothered to the roof with its scented green leaves and scarlet
flowers, while on the other side the close-growing vivid green of a
dolichos creeper was even covering the bark roof itself with its
mat of triangular pale green leaves.</p>

<p>'Ah!' cried the Governor, as they came on at a run, 'why, I
declare there are ladies to welcome us! Mrs.
Quested&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The door had opened, and there came out into the evening
sunlight a little woman, dainty in white muslin with
cherry-coloured ribbons, and a tall and stately woman with a child
in her arms. The little woman ran towards them with arms
outstretched. There were traces of tears on her cheeks. But she
looked glad and happy now.</p>

<p>'Oh, I have been so frightened, Captain Quested,' she called,
'but Joan said&mdash;Joan said&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Reynell stopped still. Loveday! Loveday! Impossible! What should
Loveday be doing here! He had dreamed of her so long that he saw
her in the first white woman he had seen in three long years. He
was thankful it was not Loveday. He would not meet her like a wild
man of the woods.</p>

<p>Yet the girlish voice was ringing in his ears, prattling on.</p>

<p>The voice he knew so well.</p>

<p>'Oh I am thankful to see you! And his honour, too! We will do
our best for him! And here is little Tom wearying to see his Daddy.
And you so late! We thought it was going to rain and spoil your
jaunt! And what a great Indian you have brought back with you! Oh,
don't let him come near little Tom! Joan! Joan! have a care of my
baby!'</p>

<p>So she thought he was one of the Indians! Her baby!</p>

<p>Could it possibly be Loveday? Her baby? Yes, surely it was
Loveday. There could not be two people in the world so much alike.
He knew all those little tricks with her hands, and the very toss
of her head. That other tall and stately woman was surely Mrs.
Quested. Lucky beggar Quested! If only he had not been such a
scarecrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But how can a man clad in skins&mdash;inadequately clad, for the
weather was hot, rush forward and claim a dainty little lady who
apparently is unconscious of his existence, not only unconscious
but quite content and happy, and very much taken up with another
man?</p>

<p>The tall woman she called Joan must be Quested's wife. She must
be. He would not let himself think anything else was possible.</p>

<p>But it was Loveday who flew across to him, caught his arm in
both her hands, looked up at him with adoring eyes. The man looking
on could not help seeing that. There was no other man in the world
for the girl Daniel Reynell had been treasuring in his heart but
Thomas Quested, some time captain in his Majesty's Navy, now, for
love of her sweet face, settler in his Majesty's new colony of New
South Wales.</p>

<p>Quested was utterly thankful. There would be no need of words,
awkward explanations. His wife's attitude explained the situation.
He never raised his eyes to Reynell, only bent over his wife,
murmuring a little incoherently words of endearment such as seemed
natural to the other men, seeing he had come back to her from the
Gates of Death.</p>

<p>The Governor and young Devereux turned quite naturally to
Joan.</p>

<p>It was she who saw; she who realized; she who knew.</p>

<p>The man she had loved dumbly and hopelessly in Cornwall had come
here&mdash;here&mdash;was standing bewildered&mdash;looking on
while his old love greeted her husband, telling him
plainly&mdash;plainly that he held no place in her heart.</p>

<p>Joan did not know how it came about that he was there or what
had happened. But she did grasp the important facts. And she was no
longer the dumb, sullen, frightened girl who had stood by the fish
scales afraid to assert herself, unable to help herself or anyone
else&mdash;three years ago in Polperro.</p>

<p>She was a convict certainly. But she was a very beautiful young
woman in a land where any woman was a precious possession. She was
accustomed to make decisions and command. Even the Governor thought
much of her. It never occurred to her to be shy now, to wait for
someone else to act.</p>

<p>She put the baby in his mother's arms.</p>

<p>'Madam there is much to be done. Will you take little Tom?'</p>

<p>Loveday was very proud of her boy.</p>

<p>'Come to his mother, then, darling.' She held him up to the
Governor, sure he would be admired.</p>

<p>'Here's my little Tom to welcome your honour, and to thank you
for bringing his Daddy safe home again.'</p>

<p>Reynell, dumb, stunned, was listening.</p>

<p>He had been saved for this. To see Loveday holding up a
child&mdash;her child&mdash;to a man she called his Daddy. Loveday
happy, joyous even.</p>

<p>He heard a soft, rich voice addressing him, and looked into a
pair of sea-blue eyes. A tall woman, a match for his own stature, a
lovely woman, even in the midst of his stinging pain he thought her
beautiful, this woman with masses of dusky hair growing a little
low on her forehead, a clear creamy complexion, like a magnolia,
and ripe red lips, who was addressing him.</p>

<p>'Daniel Reynell,' she said, and her voice shook.</p>

<p>For her pain was great, too. This was the man she had loved so
faithfully, come to her out of the sea after three long years. She
had come to the South Seas to meet him; deliberately chosen when
she had not realized how shadowy was the hope she was building
upon&mdash;and here he was looking with miserable eyes at the woman
who had forgotten him long, long ago&mdash;the woman who had never
really loved him.</p>

<p>She, Joan, was bound to remember she was a convict who had been
sentenced to death.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said dully, 'yes.'</p>

<p>That was Loveday there with the child in her arms. Surely the
Loveday he had known had been more beautiful. This
Loveday&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'You don't remember Joan, Joan of the Pilchard, Daniel Reynell.
Your honour,' she curtseyed to the Governor, 'I knew Skipper Daniel
Reynell in Polperro&mdash;in another world.'</p>

<p>Joan of the Pilchard talking like that! Joan of the Pilchard! He
remembered her, but he could not connect her with this young
woman!</p>

<p>He swore an astonished oath.</p>

<p>'I am mad, I think. It must be a dream!'</p>

<p>Whatever happened Joan was sure of herself.</p>

<p>'You remember you told me to take Dick Penrhyn's mare. I
couldn't find him to ask so I took her. He caught me and gave me in
charge for horse stealing. No one heeded what I said. No one would
take my message. I was naught. She thought,' she dropped her voice,
and the Governor turned away, 'you were dead, and she married
Captain Quested. Come with me. I am sure I can find you some
clothes.'</p>

<p>Well, clothes the Governor understood.</p>

<p>'That's right, Joan,' he said, 'we'll trust you to look after
our preserver.'</p>

<p>'He couldn't be in better hands,' came Quested's cordial voice,
warmer and more contented than it had yet been. Matters were
explaining themselves very comfortably. 'Rout in the store, Joan.
I'm sure you'll find something for our friend.'</p>

<p>He would not say his name&mdash;not yet. He did not want to
startle his wife. He would tell her when he got her all to
himself.</p>

<p>Once Joan had laid her hand on Reynell's feet and thrilled at
the touch. She thrilled, as of old, as she laid her hand on his
arm. She was shy but not at a loss.</p>

<p>'Do come,' she said. 'I can help you a little here, though I
failed you that time.'</p>

<p>He was at a disadvantage, she was feeling keenly, standing there
like a savage.</p>

<p>He followed her meekly. He was worn out. He had fought and
struggled and endured, upheld by his one high hope. He had come
through and it was dust and ashes in his mouth. The clouds
gathered. The setting sun was hidden; there came a breath of wind
from the south, and drops of rain fell on his head.</p>

<p>'It is going to rain,' said Joan, 'and, oh, the wheat is not in
yet. Come in, come in. Captain Quested, sir. Can't the marines help
stack the wheat? Job and Michael will never get it done in time,
and 'tis a sin to let it spoil.'</p>

<p>'Forgive me,' she turned to Reynell, 'but the wheat is vital in
this new country.'</p>

<p>'Of course. I can help.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' came Quested's courteous voice. 'There are plenty
of us. You have earned a little rest. Joan will find you a razor
and cut your hair for you. She always cuts mine. And, Joan, there
are some blue serge slops you might&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'In the cedar chest,' said Loveday. 'Oh, Joan can manage all
right.' She was looking at Reynell, and smiling kindly at him.
'Little Tom and I will give his Honour and Mr. Devereaux some rum
to cheer them after their long journeying.'</p>

<p>Joan drew Reynell into the little lean-to she used as a
kitchen.</p>

<p>'I know,' she spoke very tenderly. She did not know how
tenderly. 'We come through things. I do not know how, but we do.
There, sit down. I will trim your hair and your beard. Then there
is hot water. You can wash and shave.'</p>

<p>Such a soft, soothing voice. She was kind&mdash;she was
beautiful&mdash;this woman, Joan&mdash;Joan of the Pilchard. He had
not thought of her for years save as a vehicle for carrying a
message and doing it badly. To her own hurt apparently. But she had
not been much hurt surely. He remembered a rough, surly, peasant
girl. This woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was very quick.</p>

<p>She got out the serge slops, very ordinary garments, but they
seemed wonderful to him. She was deftly fitting,
ripping&mdash;letting out and sewing, doing it&mdash;though he did
not know it&mdash;with a great gladness in her heart. For
this&mdash;for this&mdash;to serve this man had she been sent to
the South Seas. For this she had improved herself, remembered her
birth and early training&mdash;for this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No. She would not look ahead, nor back in the past. What was the
good of remembering far-off unhappy things.</p>

<p>She cut his hair and brought him her own brush and comb and
little glass.</p>

<p>'Rather short,' she said, keeping a strong hand on herself, 'but
it is so much more handy in this country. Now, there is a good
lather, and I'll go out while you shave. Presently I'll bring you
this jacket. It will serve. To-night I will make it better.'</p>

<p>He came out of that kitchen a different man. Joan drew in a
quick breath and her heart stopped a beat. She had been right to
love this man. If it never came to anything&mdash;if she walked
lonely all her days&mdash;she had honoured herself by loving
him.</p>

<p>Reynell held up his head. It was raining a little. But many
hands had made light work. The marines with Quested, Job and the
other assigned man had stacked that precious wheat, and were now
drawing over the little stack the canvas that Quested had stored up
so carefully against his first harvest home.</p>

<p>Because it was hot inside Loveday had put the rough table under
the overhanging roof that made a sort of veranda and a protection
from the falling rain. The lamp shed its yellow light on her happy
face with the matronly white cap on her pretty curls. She had got
over her emotion and was important, entertaining the Governor.
Reynell stood and looked at her.</p>

<p>Then he looked at Joan, whom he could hardly see in the
gathering darkness.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. Not so had he thought to meet his love
again. It seemed to him his life was in ruins round him. Yet this
was not the woman he had dreamed of.</p>

<p>'Get it over,' suggested Joan's quiet voice. 'Why not go and
report yourself? If it had not been for you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stepped forward into the lamplight, and, raising his hand to
his forehead, saluted the Governor.</p>

<p>'Come on board, sir,' he said because he really could not think
of what a man should say under the circumstances.</p>

<p>'Well done, Reynell,' said Phillip kindly, 'Joan has
metamorphosed you. I knew she would.'</p>

<p>'Reynell!' cried Loveday.</p>

<p>He found himself being sorry for her. Surely he had done wrong
to startle her like this.</p>

<p>'Daniel Reynell!'</p>

<p>But no. It had never gone deep enough to hurt her. In a moment
she had recovered herself. She remembered she was a lady, the wife
of a man who had been a captain in the Royal Navy. She must think
for him her husband, the man she loved. She must bring no slur,
even a passing one, on his name. But Daniel Reynell had been her
childhood's friend. She could not remember when she had not known
him.</p>

<p>'Oh, Daniel Reynell,' she cried again, 'where have you been? And
we have mourned you for dead! And to think I thought you a savage!
Forgive me!' She was half laughing, half crying. 'I cannot remember
when I did not know Daniel Reynell, your honour. When I was a tiny
child he made dolls for me.'</p>

<p>So that was the way she elected to take it! Not a word of their
plighted faith; not a thought, apparently, of the wedding that was
to have been on New Year's Day, 1788. All his longing, all his
waiting, all his agony, were so much waste. They might never have
been. Better for him if they had not been.</p>

<p>Quested was looking at his wife with tender eyes. A wife after
his own heart! Not only a dear, loving little girl, but one who was
capable of saving his face in what might have been an awkward
situation.</p>

<p>Against his breast Reynell felt the pearl he had saved for her;
to make life smooth and easy for her.</p>

<p>She wanted nothing from him.</p>

<p>Yes, she did. He saw in her eyes the fear that he would give her
away, tell the Governor of the Colony, a man she wanted to stand
well with, of their former relations. That was all that was left of
the thing that had been his life. She was begging him to
forget.</p>

<p>He took her outstretched hand lightly in his own and, stooping,
laid a kiss upon it such as any gallant of the time might have
done.</p>

<p>'I never thought to meet my little playmate grown into a great
lady at this end of the world,' he said quite simply. 'They tell me
I have given your husband back to you. Indeed I am glad that my
long and dreary voyage was of so great a service to my old
friend.'</p>

<p>Then she broke down, sobbing and clasping his hand in both
hers.</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed, I can't thank you enough! If Captain Quested had
never come back&mdash;and his honour says&mdash;Oh, Daniel
Reynell&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Was she not a pearl of a wife? Quested put his arm round
her.</p>

<p>She turned and hid her face quite naturally on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'There, there, my dear. There is no need to cry now. Daniel
Reynell, your honour, as I have already told you, was an important
man in Polperro, skipper and owner of a fine brig. They had no
right to press him. I had no hand in it. If I had
known&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He looked at Reynell and spoke very earnestly.</p>

<p>'All to get me out of a terrible mess apparently,' said the
Governor genially. 'It was no ordinary man who could do that. By
your leave, Captain Quested. We drink to you, Daniel Reynell, and
you will drink with us. You must tell me what we can do to make
your stay in this colony pleasant, for I fear there is no ship as
yet to take you home.'</p>

<p>'I've been so long away,' said Reynell, stumbling a little in
his speech, for he felt that the ship had lost her rudder, 'that it
really seems as if a year more or less&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, youth,' said the Governor a little enviously. But he should
have known better. It is age that feels like that. 'Well, here are
our grateful thanks to you, Daniel Reynell.'</p>

<p>Very gravely he stood up and drank a toast.</p>

<p>'You have saved the lives of eight men. If you want anything
that it is in my power to give you I can assure you I am at your
service.'</p>

<p>What he wanted was the years he had wasted longing for the woman
who was leaning her head on her husband's shoulder, looking at him
contentedly from that vantage point.</p>

<p>'I thank your honour,' he said, lifting the glass the Governor
had filled to his lips. 'For the moment I feel I have had as much
as any man could want.'</p>
