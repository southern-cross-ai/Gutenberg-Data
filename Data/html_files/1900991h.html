<h3>FIRST MOVEMENT. LENTO DOLOROSO E LAMENTOSO</h3>

<p class="first">
"WHEN I was a child," said the Princess Sophia Magdalena
thoughtfully, "I used to dream of escaping into the woods and of
living there for ever. I thought that I could exist on wild
strawberries, that the moss would make a very pleasant bed at
night, that the dew, caught in the cups of the lily leaves, would
make a delicious drink. You perceive that I imagined that it
would be always summer. Such was my plan to escape from the
world."</p>

<p>"But now," smiled her friend uneasily, "you know that you
cannot evade your responsibilities and that the world from which
you would escape needs you."</p>

<p>The Princess Sophia Magdalena was too courteous to remark on
this obvious flattery. She smiled civilly, and leaning over the
elaborate ironwork of the balcony, glanced down the sunny
street.</p>

<p>"How gay the city looks to-day," she remarked. "All those
flags! How bright their colours are and how brilliantly the sun
gleams on all the spires and weathercocks."</p>

<p>"It is my son's birthday," smiled the Princess Hedwig, with a
slight emphasis of her uneasiness. "He is very popular, more for
his vices, I fear, than for his virtues. Between you and me, my
dear, he is a rather thoughtless, worthless fellow."</p>

<p>Sophia Magdalena knew that her friend and hostess did not mean
this deprecation of her son to be taken seriously, but she
appreciated the spirit in which it was made, for Prince Chlodwig
had everything that she, Sophia Magdalena, had not and the
contrast, even in the eyes of this shining young hero's mother,
must have been a painful one.</p>

<p>As she continued to gaze down the long, brightly-lit street
where the little figures of citizens in their best clothes moved
busily to and fro setting up garlands, pennants and loyal mottoes
above their doors and in front of their windows, the Princess
Sophia Magdalena said sincerely:</p>

<p>"If I had known&mdash;I mean, if I had remembered, that this
was your son's birthday festival I should not have paused here on
my way to Gandersheim."</p>

<p>"But how absurd!" exclaimed the Princess Hedwig in hasty
kindliness. "We rejoice to have you, my dear child. I only hope
that these rather tiresome ceremonies will not seem to you
childish and tedious."</p>

<p>"It is not that," replied the other gently, "but you know,
Madame, that I am not made for festivals."</p>

<p>She said this without either reproach or sadness, but the
Princess Hedwig was silent; she did not know in what manner to
comfort and console one whose destiny indeed permitted of neither
comfort nor consolation.</p>

<p>The Princess Sophia Magdalena was the sixth daughter of a
Prince-Bishop who was extremely poor and extremely proud. To be
thus placed was, in itself; no great good fortune, but, to add
bitterness to this dubious destiny the Princess Sophia Magdalena
was the plainest high-born lady within the Empire. Indeed, some
had said, within the frontiers of Europe.</p>

<p>She was good, she was accomplished, she had plenty of common
sense, she had early learned resignation, but her portrait had
been in vain hawked round all the Courts of Germany. Envoys,
tactful and insinuating, had endeavoured to put forward her
claims anywhere where there was a prince, however stupid, plain,
poor or ill-tempered, desiring a wife. But always in vain.
Painters might flatter and make a passable miniature of those
pinched features, those thin lips, that large nose, that thin
neck and bony shoulders, but rumour spoke truer than the artist's
pencil&mdash;the lady's fame always preceded her, and it had been
impossible to dispose of the ugly princess even among princes
uglier than she was and infinitely her inferior in every other
respect. Even if she had had a large dowry it would have been
difficult to find her a husband, but as she was penniless the
task had become hopeless and her father and his ministers had
thrown up their hands in despair and, when she was twenty-seven
years old, had secured for her, by extraordinary good luck and
from the compassion of an Emperor who knew her patience and her
good temper, the envied post of Abbess of the old Abbey of
Gandersheim.</p>

<p>She was on her way to take up this position and had made, in
her slow and stately travel, a pause at the Court of the Princess
Hedwig, who was a distant relation of her mother.</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig had been everything that was kind and
considerate, but her guest would rather have proceeded on her way
than have remained to partake at the festivals of that spoilt
darling of the Fortune, the goddess who had never smiled on her.
The Prince Chlodwig was not, she considered, even for her distant
contemplation.</p>

<p>"When one is about to leave the world," she remarked, leaning
awkwardly on the balcony ('Everything she does is awkward,'
thought the Princess Hedwig miserably), "the less one sees of it
the better. And do you know, Madame, though I have so well learnt
resignation, I still long for my summer woods, my diet of
strawberries, my drink of lily dew."</p>

<p>"But you are going into a great position," said the other
woman eagerly and with real admiration. "Do not forget your
accomplishments&mdash;how well you know Greek and Latin, how
excellently you can make verses, how delicate a hand you have
with a needle, yes, and even with the engraver's burin! You will
have a position of great power, everybody will admire you and
applaud your prudence and piety and good behaviour! Think, my
dear, what it is to have reached your age and never to have had
anyone say an unkind word about you, not to have a single blemish
on your character!"</p>

<p>This compliment was, perhaps, unfortunately phrased. The
Princess Sophia Magdalena Sybilla smiled over her shoulder and
said gently:</p>

<p>"No blemish on my character perhaps, but is not that because
there are several blemishes in my person? If I had been beautiful
I might have been as wanton as&mdash;" She paused, for she did
not know the names of many careless, beautiful ladies, and was
too kind to have named them if she had had so much knowledge, but
the Princess Hedwig supplied, with a sigh, the end of the
sentence:</p>

<p>"As Roszianka, perhaps," she said, "as Rozsika."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Magdalena Sybilla without much interest,
for her attention was strangely attracted by the movements in the
sunny street below.</p>

<p>She had lived much secluded in her desolate, gaunt palace,
which was all that her father could afford as a residence for his
daughter. She had read a great deal, but experienced very little
and all along her journey&mdash;she had to cross the Empire to
reach Gandersheim&mdash;she had been aware of an increasing sense
of intoxication produced by the strange sights and sounds around
her, by all the evidences of a busy, active life in which she had
never had, and now never could have, any part. And this sense of
excitement, of anticipation, of a poignant longing, had been
intensified since she had been in the elegant city where
sumptuous preparations for the festival of a beloved prince were
being made.</p>

<p>"Rozsika," sighed the Princess Hedwig, with a gesture and
glance of dismay, "means, I think, to marry my son, and a
marriage with her! That would be in every way a dreadful thing to
occur! Of course, it would only be a morganatic affair&mdash;she
is not of royal birth, but it would be quite sufficient to
prevent him from making the match which is in view
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I suppose," sighed the Princess Magdalena Sybilla slowly,
"she is very lovely."</p>

<p>"My son thinks so," sighed the elder woman shortly. "She uses
every possible device to entrap him, she assumes virtue, and her
father, who is a cunning old rogue, watches her diligently. What
is the use of speaking of them?" The Princess Hedwig shrugged her
plump shoulders. "I, of course, can do nothing. The truth is,
Rozsika is behaving very badly."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps if I were pretty I also might behave badly. I
rather wish I had missed your festival. You see, Madame, I have
never seen anything of this kind before, we are as poor as church
mice, there have been times when we have hardly had a party dress
between us."</p>

<p>"I ought to have asked you and your sisters here before,"
confessed the other lady uncomfortably, "but
somehow&mdash;somehow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, Madame," interrupted Magdalena Sybilla pleasantly,
"you would never think of such a thing, and why should you? With
all the women there are in the world why should you trouble
yourself with the plainest and most ungainly of their sex?
Besides," she added with a sigh, "it would have been of no
use."</p>

<p>Princess Hedwig, looking at her with deep sympathy, thought so
too.</p>

<p>"The poor creature certainly deserves her title of 'The Ugly
Princess.' What maid, however skilful, could do anything with
those irregular features, with that yellow complexion, with those
small eyes and that long nose, with the harsh dark hair? What
dressmaker, however cunning, could do anything with that angular
figure, those clumsy movements, with those large hands and
feet?"</p>

<p>She had fine white teeth and a most agreeable voice, her smile
was ready and humorous. One could well believe that there was no
evil in her; nay, that she had never had as much as an unworthy
thought. But this was all, and it was not very much, to be said
in favour of "The Ugly Princess."</p>

<p>"Let us go into the palace," said the Princess Hedwig hastily,
"the sun is really much too hot here."</p>

<p>But she spoke too late and the Princess Sophia Magdalena had
lingered on the balcony a little too long. Around the corner of
the street came the Prince Chlodwig, returning from the hunt with
his retinue. He flashed unexpectedly on to the brilliant scene.
This was no formal entry nor ceremonial occasion but the
townsfolk, though taken by surprise, cheered him lustily,
standing, with their flags and garlands in their hands, to shout
for one who had never increased taxes, who spent a great deal of
money, who continually provided amusement and scandal and was, in
addition, most agreeable to look at, and always had a good-
humoured smile on his face and a pleasant word on his lips.</p>

<p>He raised his white-plumed hat in gay return of these loyal
salutations; the July sun shone on his hair which was as gold and
as pale and gleaming as his mother's wedding ring.</p>

<p>"Is that your son?" asked the Princess Magdalena Sybilla, and
the other lady said "Yes," almost as if she were ashamed, and she
made a nervous and perhaps cowardly movement to draw the ugly
Princess away from the balcony. But Princess Magdalena Sybilla
lingered and he looked up and she saw on the handsomest face that
she had yet beheld the expression that she had seen on too many
other faces&mdash;surprise, incredulity, quickly controlled pity.
Ah, well she knew that look! No man, especially no young man,
expected a woman, especially a young woman, to look like she
looked. But his mother was quickly beside her, masking her,
protecting her, and he bowed low in the saddle in an exaggeration
of courtesy.</p>

<p>But she had seen the glance. She was, however, a
philosopher&mdash;how would the unhappy and the unfortunate exist
without philosophy? She said to herself: "I was certain to meet
him, sooner or later, therefore I was certain to see such a
glance." Aloud she said:</p>

<p>"I think, after all, I did stand too long in the sun. I have a
little headache, I will go and lie down until dinner-time, if you
please, Madame. I have, besides, some letters to write home."</p>

<p>And as she went on with her courteous excuses, which were very
sensibly and even prettily given, the Princess Hedwig, who was
very good-natured, was thinking most unhappily:</p>

<p>"It was very stupid for her to come here just now. It ought to
have been arranged differently. It would seem so inhospitable to
send her away, but I wish I could think of some excuse for her to
avoid the festival. What a figure, poor child, will she cut at
the supper and the ball and the carnival masquerade! She has no
clothes, either, and no jewels and even were I to find the
courage to offer to lend her any and she were to accept, why,
finery would only make her look grotesque."</p>

<p>In the very handsome chamber that was assigned to her in the
Residentzschloss the ugly Princess communed with her own soul.
She, also, wished she had not come to the gay city in this time
of festival. Her father had arranged the matter with the best
intentions, but thought-lessly. She did not blame him nor the
Princess Hedwig. "It is I," she said to herself, "who am wrong. I
have no right to be ugly. People cannot be always remembering it
and making allowances and wondering how they can avoid hurting my
feelings. It will be a good thing for me and for everyone else
when I am safely in the Abbey of Gandersheim."</p>

<p>So she tried to fix her thoughts on that, on what her future
life would be in the Abbey, that large building with a small town
around it where she would be mistress, nay, almost queen. It was
a Protestant establishment in name, but one modelled on pre-
Reformation lines. It was very old&mdash;there had been an abbey
at Gandersheim even in the time of legends, of silver knights,
black dragons and blonde princesses. Sophia Magdalena had heard
of white cloisters, of ancient lime trees, of grass plots, of
vines growing in the open air (for Gandersheim was far south),
and she had pictured, in her sad mind, a place of peace and
solitude where she might be, if not happy, at least free to
indulge her favourite virtue of resignation.</p>

<p>She had thought that such a life might not be wholly
distasteful. It would have some power, some dignity, some scope
for those qualities which she knew she possessed. She would be an
Abbess, she would rule a community, she would not be one of six
plain women whom no one wanted. There had been moments at her
father's poverty-stricken Court when she had longed for
Gandersheim and had implored him to hurry on the negotiations
which would secure for her the post of Abbess. But all of this
had been before she had seen the Prince Chlodwig, before she had
travelled the broad highways, seen the children playing, the
maidens working in the fields, the students with hood and gown,
and schoolchildren with satchels, pretty women with their
cavaliers, middle-aged and old women comfortable with their
families around them, all the busy bustling life, all the eager
coming and going of the public highways.</p>

<p>For several days during her slow progress she had marked these
things. She had seen much at the inn where they had been put up
with ceremony and received with respect. Although her apartments
had always been separated from those of the common people, she
had had glimpses of inn yards, she had seen men and women on the
stairs, in the public parlour and dining-room, and she had
realised that she had missed much more than she had ever known
before.</p>

<p>She took out her Bible, her prayer-book and the volume which
contained the History of Gandersheim and the rules for the Abbess
of the Sisters. She tried to fix her mind again on this placid,
tranquil future which lay before her, the prospect which had
seemed not uninviting when viewed from the arid poverty of her
father's house, was now marred by a thousand memories&mdash;the
incidents of the last few days, and, most of all, by the thought
of Prince Chlodwig whom she had just seen riding round the corner
of the street on his fine bay horse with all his gold and scarlet
trappings, the sun bright on his pale uncovered head.</p>

<p>She looked at herself steadily in the mirror which hung above
the large dressing-table. She had never shrunk before from gazing
at herself in a mirror, she had never used any formula of
reproach towards any destiny or providence that might be
responsible for her misfortune, but now she did murmur "Cruel!"
as she looked at those crooked features, at that sallow
complexion, at that thin dark hair, at that lean figure which no
garment of festival could disguise.</p>

<p>"I should not have come here. There is to be a ball to-night
and I have nothing to wear. I should need to blaze with jewels to
disguise how ugly I am. But then, that would be no use, either.
They would merely say 'Poor creature, how hopeless it is!' And
yet if I go in my green velvet, which is all I have, with the
tarnished braid, they will say 'She looks like a goblin and
spoils the feast.'"</p>

<p>So, staring at herself in the mirror the ugly Princess
resolved that she would not attend the ball. She was quite sure
that the kind Princess Hedwig would understand her when she
pleaded a headache, a sudden indisposition from the sun. Yes, she
was quite sure that that understanding woman would allow her to
remain in peace in her handsome suite of apartments and depart
quietly in two or three days' time, perhaps early in the morning
before anyone was astir, when all the festival, if not over, was
at least, in abeyance.</p>

<p>But, even as she stared at her unhappy reflection her courage
rose. She was well-bred and had been finely trained.</p>

<p>"I must not be a coward. I am about to take up a position
which will require a certain force of character, I must not allow
myself to be despised. What does it matter to me whether these
people find me ugly, whether they scorn me or pity me. I do not
belong to them or their world, I am merely passing through to
another sphere where I shall, at least, be at peace, where I
shall, at least, reign, where it will not matter that my features
are crooked and my skin yellow, where I shall be respected for my
integrity, for my purity of purpose, for my piety and
resignation. Let me then, keep this dignity which is going to be
so necessary to me in the future. If I am cowardly now I shall
lose so much in my own estimation that perhaps I shall never be
able to hold up my head again."</p>

<p>So it came about that on the evening of the great ball to
celebrate the twenty-first birthday of Prince Chlodwig in the
Residentzschloss, the ugly Princess was there in the green velvet
gown with the slightly tarnished silver braid which had belonged
to her mother, with a string of garnets round her throat and
about her shoulders, to disguise their ungainly slope, a little
cape of rubbed fox-skin.</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig showed her much kind attention, but,
tactfully, not sufficient to make her conspicuous. She was
treated as an honoured guest whose precedence is taken for
granted and seated, by her own wish, near the orchestra, on a
gilt stool in a corner where the light was not too strong, where
there were no flowers to flaunt their frail loveliness, and where
a dark tapestry of sombre blues and greens could not shame her
modest attire.</p>

<p>It was a very splendid ball, excellently arranged, and after
quite a little while the ugly Princess forgot her personal
discomforts and disappointments and began, as a spectator, to
enjoy the lively scene.</p>

<p>Never before had she seen such dresses, such jewellery, such
elegant men and charming women. She admired everything as
wholeheartedly as if she had been at a play, and when Baron
Hagemann, the Chancellor, spoke to her out of compassion and duty
combined, he was quite enchanted by her ingenuous and unenvious
delight in a spectacle in which she had no part.</p>

<p>A pool had been made in the middle of the room and from this
rose a fountain. On the top of the jet of water shone tiny balls
of coloured glass. The ugly Princess thought she had never seen
anything so exquisite in her life&mdash;she could hardly take her
eyes away from the incessant rise and fall of the water, from the
endless dance of the coloured balls.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;the music!</p>

<p>She was passionately fond of music, though no one had ever
written any for her, and her father could not afford to keep an
orchestra. She had learnt to play a little on the violin, and she
was an adept at the harpsichord, but never had she heard anything
like this. The twenty-four musicians in their purple and white
livery played such enchanting melodies that the ugly Princess
thrilled with rapture. Her cheeks were quite flushed and her eyes
quite sparkling for the first time in her life as the Princess
Hedwig found a way to her side and endeavoured delicately to
deprecate the festival and to say how conventional and noisy and
foolish it all was.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Madame," cried the ugly Princess eagerly, "I think it
is very beautiful: I am enjoying it&mdash;every moment, the
voices, and the music and those dresses and those garlands of
flowers from one pillar to another and the wax lights in the
crystal chandeliers! Oh, yes, indeed, Madame, it is very
beautiful."</p>

<p>She smiled in such touching and such forgetful admiration of
pleasures not dedicated to her that the elder woman turned her
head aside in a sudden shame.</p>

<p>"Where is Rozsika? Show her to me I implore you, Madame. You
said she was lovely and I have been looking for her, but all the
ladies here seem so lovely that I cannot understand which is
she."</p>

<p>"She is over there," replied the Princess Hedwig, "talking to
the man in the saffron-coloured coat. She has a bunch of green
ribbons on her shoulders, but you see how insolent she is and how
loudly she laughs! She is, I suppose, quite sure of him."</p>

<p>The last bitter words escaped the notice of the ugly Princess
who was looking with a wholehearted admiration at the fair
Rozsika.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, she is certainly exquisite&mdash;it looks as if the
whole festival had been planned for her. What grace, what poise!
Those diamonds on her hair and her breast, how perfectly they set
off her colouring of white and gold!"</p>

<p>"She is talking too loudly," said the Princess Hedwig, "she is
not as happy as she looks nor as confident as she would make us
think. If you observe her closely you will see that she is really
very uneasy and, after all, my dear, I must tell you that this
festival is not the success that it seems. My son, in whose
honour it is given, has not yet arrived."</p>

<p>"I had not seen him," replied the ugly Princess timidly, "but
then, I thought that he was in another part of the room or in one
of the ante-chambers or the gallery."</p>

<p>"He has not arrived," repeated the Princess Hedwig sternly.
"Three separate messengers have been sent and <i>they</i> cannot
find him. I have now ordered the Baron Hagemann to discover him
at any cost. If he does not come soon there will be a great many
people offended. One cannot afford that nor an open scandal."</p>

<p>"Scandal?" repeated the Princess faintly.</p>

<p>"I suppose," thought the Princess Hedwig, "she already admires
him very much, even after that glimpse this morning." Aloud she
remarked: "One can never be sure of him. He is impudent and must
always have his own way. No doubt I spoilt him when he was a
child and now he forgets that he is no longer a boy. Nothing
would suit him to-day but that he must go and celebrate his
birthday with some students who invited him to a dinner at a Club
near the University."</p>

<p>"Surely, it is quite fitting that he should go?"</p>

<p>"It were quite fitting, my dear, he should go if he would
return in time. But he delays, he delays! No doubt he is
roystering, perhaps taking too much to drink, and who knows but
that," added the anxious mother with a sigh, "when he is in his
cups he might commit himself to someone far worse even than
Rozsika!"</p>

<p>"Look, Madame," whispered Magdalena Sybilla eagerly, "I think
that is he entering now. See, Baron Hagemann has him by the
elbow, everyone is flocking round him." The Princess Hedwig beat
her hand upon her knees.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is he," she said impatiently, "and he <i>has</i>
had too much to drink. See, he is quite unsteady in his walk. He
has done this just to defy us all because we gave him some good
advice. He wants to show that he is without leading-strings and
only proves that he is a fool."</p>

<p>She rose and curtly directed the leader of the orchestra to
strike up his loudest march with which to cover some possible
indiscretion of Prince Chlodwig. Then she resumed her seat in the
shadowy corner by Princess Sophia Magdalena.</p>

<p>"I will stay here. If he sees me it will only inflame him.
See! he is asking Rozsika to dance. How she has changed!"</p>

<p>"Like a flower opening!" murmured the ugly Princess.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, he has taken her in his arms, he is looking at her
lovingly. Perhaps, before the whole Court, he will ask her to be
his wife," and with an angry glance the Princess Hedwig rose.
"See, his coarse manner, and I have taken such trouble with him!
It is you whom he should ask to dance. You are the woman of the
highest rank here, you are his relation and his guest."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Madame, I implore you! I do not know how to dance; I
would not wish to stand up before all these people. Indeed, leave
me as I am."</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig gave her a steady look.</p>

<p>"One must not shirk one's duty, it is not right for you to sit
here. You should lead the dance with my son."</p>

<p>The victim of this etiquette remembered the resolution she had
made before the mirror in her chamber&mdash;not to be cowardly,
not to shirk anything, to consider always what was due to her
rank and breeding. So she rose and dropped a very low curtsey to
her hostess and said:</p>

<p>"If your son asks me, Madame, I shall be pleased to lead the
dance with him."</p>

<p>But though she both despised and disavowed her own cowardice,
the truth was that she was in her heart very much afraid. She did
not want to dance with the handsome prince before the roomful of
strangers, all of them no doubt scornful and hostile; she did not
want to go through the movements of the gavotte under the bright
jeering eyes of Rozsika. Only his entire tender courtesy would
have made such an ordeal tolerable, and of that she fered she
would receive none. It was clear that his mother had instructed
him to open the ball with her, but that he had forgotten.</p>

<p>He had Rozsika on his arm, he was bending towards her, playing
with a flower in her corsage, everyone was looking, raising their
eyebrows, even their shoulders, smiling, whispering behind fans.
It seemed clear that he was to commit himself openly and for ever
to Baron Lubomirsky's daughter and this seemed to the ugly
Princess right and fitting. They made such a splendid
pair&mdash;he, so handsome and so gorgeous, she, so lovely and so
elegant, both in their rich festival attire, in love one with the
other&mdash;she in love with his rank and splendour, he in love
with her youth and gaiety!</p>

<p>The ugly Princess would have liked to have fled; she would
liked to have gone up to her room where her old servant would be
nodding in the candle light waiting to make her a hot posset
before she crept into bed, but this cowardly flight could not be
contemplated. She must accept the suffering that was ordained for
her to endure.</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig, moving tactfully, easily, with a word
here, a smile there, contrived to cross the room to her son's
side without appearing to do so. The blood burnt in the ugly
Princess' thin cheeks as she saw her hostess speak to her son, as
she saw him, still with Rozsika on his arm, move towards her
where she sat by the orchestra.</p>

<p>The march had come to an end and it was in silence that Prince
Chlodwig approached the guest in her shadowed tapestried corner.
The musicians were busy with their music, fixing on the stands
the pages on which were written the gavotte that was to open the
ball.</p>

<p>He came towards her and she fluttered like a cornered dove at
his approach. Rozsika insolently and reluctantly had left his arm
but she stood her ground beside the Princess Hedwig.</p>

<p>"How lovely she is!" thought Magdalena Sybilla. "How exquisite
is her gown!&mdash;all those sequins like icicles, like water!
Yes, she is like the fountain rising in the middle of the room,
as white, as sparkling, as serene!"</p>

<p>She ventured to look at the young prince; she saw that he was
making an effort over himself; his walk, his movements, his
speech, his dignity, all was exaggerated, his carriage was that
of a boy, drunk for the first time in public. His beauty, his
fine clothes, his splendid carriage, his jewels, could not
entirely disguise the degradation of his condition.</p>

<p>His mother touched his elbow. He stood in front of the ugly
Princess and bowed. The Court, slowly moving, like a flight of
swans behind their leader, in the wake of their master, was but a
hand's stretch behind him as he bowed before his guest.</p>

<p>She rose, she trembled into a curtsey; her downcast eyes saw
the billows of her old green velvet with the tarnished silver
braid about her feet. She glanced up at him, pleading for mercy;
she saw his flushed gaze staring down into hers, she heard him
laugh, she saw him thrust his hand on his hip and exclaim in a
loud, unnatural voice:</p>

<p>"The ugly Princess! My God! what a disaster!"</p>

<p>The insult was underlined by the shrill laughter of
Rozsika.</p>

<p>They continued to stare at each other and no one had the
courage to say anything. The silence seemed as if it would be
impossible to break when the first violin dropping his instrument
directly at their feet and sprawling clumsily after it caused a
diversion&mdash;a hubbub, a relief from the excitement, the
dismay, the horror. The musician apologised, he was blamed,
everyone talked at once and of nothing save the clumsiness of the
fellow with the violin.</p>

<br>

<h3>SECOND MOVEMENT. ALLEGRO VIVACE E SEMPRE SHERZANDO</h3>

<p class="first">
PRINCESS MAGDALENA SYBILLA of Marienburg lay in bed late on
the day following the ball.</p>

<p>"It will be difficult," she thought, "after the events of last
night, to begin life again. It will never be quite, of course, on
the old footing."</p>

<p>She had been far too excited to sleep and through the short
hours between her retirement to her room and her ancient maid
bringing in her chocolate she had reviewed again and again the
circumstances of the ball.</p>

<p>She was gratified by the recollection of the part she had
played under conditions which might have been, but had not been,
disastrous. It had been an occasion to reveal good breeding and
she had revealed it; it had been an occasion to display courage
and nerve, and she had shown that she had possessed both these
admirable qualities. What had inspired her had been an intense
pity both for the young man, who was, she was sure, honest and
honourable when sober, and for his mother who had tried all along
to be so kind to her, the Princess Magdalena Sybilla of
Marienburg, to whom it was not so easy to be kind.</p>

<p>This pity for them had made her forget herself Instead of
running from the room and bursting into tears, of pointing the
catastrophe by some collapse on her own part, she had ignored the
insult of the drunken youth and the silence that had followed.
She had laughed quite gaily over the episode of the broken violin
and the musician sprawling after it along the beeswaxed
floor.</p>

<p>"It was curious," she reflected, sitting up in bed and drawing
about her shoulders her old-fashioned tippet of white wool, "that
no one else among all those sophisticated well-trained people
could think of anything to cause a diversion&mdash;not one of
them, they all stood dumbfounded until that poor player, a plain
fellow like myself, I remember, must do something ludicrous like
that&mdash;throwing down his violin and then himself!"</p>

<p>She had laughed in genuine amusement. There had been something
so forlorn about the action, something so desperate in the
musician's face as he had looked up at her, a glance, she
flattered herself, of real devotion, as if he had said: "A little
thing, but all I could do."</p>

<p>After that everything had been a confusion, but not a
disagreeable chaos. Everyone had moved about together. She had
seen the young Prince's face with an expression on it which was,
she thought, like that of a drowning man who, before he sinks,
suddenly realises his end is near&mdash;such an expression of
emphatic horror and incredulity had been on the fair young
countenance of Prince Chlodwig of Luneburg Hohenheim as his
friends had closed round him and led him away. Rozsika, the ugly
Princess had noticed, was not in that protecting, friendly group.
After her thin and insolent laugh, which had maliciously pointed
the discomfiture of the other woman, she was left rather alone.
The Princess Hedwig had deliberately turned her back on her as
she had drawn the lean arm of Magdalena Sybilla round her own
plump waist.</p>

<p>Rozsika had pouted, frowned, then laughed again and raised her
brows. One or two flatterers had fluttered near her, then
hesitated and fluttered away. She had, of course, received a good
deal of homage of late but on this occasion her sycophants seemed
to find other objects of admiration. It was the ugly Princess who
had been the centre of all attention. The Graf von Böhmlau had
suggested showing her the fireworks; Baron Baps, bowing still
lower, had talked of a visit to the aviary so sweetly lit by
coloured fairy lamps. One charming lady, with a tenderness not to
be mistaken for mockery, had admired the regal cut of the green
gown and the elegant festooning of the tarnished silver lace, the
victim was so sorry for all of them that she had taken their
tributes in good part. She had laughed and jested, done her
utmost to set them all at their ease, to show that she did not
remember, that she had not been offended, that nothing ugly had
happened. In her heart, she took all the blame on herself.</p>

<p>"I should not have been here, I was like a challenge. He is
spoilt, fortune's coxcomb, and was very intoxicated. When he is
sober some fool, or more likely some malicious
woman&mdash;Rozsika, no doubt&mdash;will tell him what he said
and then he will suffer horribly."</p>

<p>Thinking of what Prince Chlodwig must suffer, the ugly
Princess had suffered also and so became more easy and gay and
animated. She had talked with this one and jested with that one,
made dry and amusing remarks, until the glances of admiration
turned in her direction became no longer feigned but genuine.
These people discovered that she was a real wit, that she had
humour and charm and a gracious pleasant way. For their own sakes
they tried to make themselves worthy of her intelligence and her
graciousness.</p>

<p>When she had been escorted through the formal grounds of the
Residentzschloss from one aspect of the spectacle to another, she
returned to the ballroom.</p>

<p>The Prince was no longer there; he had tacitly withdrawn from
his own feast and no one mentioned him.</p>

<p>The ugly Princess, remarking his absence, cried in her tender
heart: "How long it will be before he regains his reputation as a
gallant man! Indeed, I fear that socially he is ruined. What can
he do to redeem himself?"</p>

<p>Rozsika also had disappeared. Her father, seeing her in a
petulant isolation, had tactfully borne her away.</p>

<p>"Alas!" thought Magdalena Sybilla sorrowfully, "have I, by my
inopportune ugliness ruined a sweet and tender romance? If she
laughed she could not help it, it was not meant in unkindness.
No, it was mere nervous hysteria. Or perhaps she did it to cover
up his disgrace!"</p>

<p>She sipped the froth on her chocolate. She decided to be on
her way to Gandersheim that morning; she could do no more to help
these people. For herself she no longer suffered, she had the
reward of courage. Last night she had endured and triumphed. She
believed that a great many people knew her a little better,
liked, and possibly even admired her, and this was a pleasant
sensation.</p>

<p>"I may even," she thought with a glow, "be admired and beloved
in Gandersheim."</p>

<p>She told the maid to bid her lackey get ready her modest
baggage. She could not, she was sure, endure to <i>see</i> Prince
Chlodwig again, and though she must, perforce, see his mother,
she hoped to make her interview as brief and formal as possible.
It would be intolerable if she had to endure the unfortunate
lady's apologies, tears, and lamentations.</p>

<p>So she got from bed with great energy and began to busily put
on her clothes. She had always attended to her own service; it
mattered so little what she wore or how it was put on. When she
had laced herself into her habit of serviceable grey Kersey, she
ran to the window and pulled wide the pink damask curtains which
were so much finer than any curtains she had ever had before, and
looked out into the garden.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day and her spirits rose just because of that.
The pure sunshine, the glistening leaves and the opening flowers,
the smooth green in the parterres and the flight of two pink
doves in the sky, who seemed to be tumbling in the heavens in a
sheer ecstasy of joy, all these things raised the spirits of the
ugly Princess.</p>

<p>But she was almost immediately sad and even humbled again, for
the Princess Hedwig entered her room and began what Magdalena
Sybilla had so dreaded&mdash;trembling apologies and bitter
regrets for the hideous circumstance of the ball the night
before.</p>

<p>Her guest besought her earnestly to be silent.</p>

<p>"Madame, I heard nothing...and if I did hear something it was
only the truth. I <i>am</i> ugly, and it <i>is</i> a disaster,
and let it go. Do you know, I enjoyed myself tremendously last
night! Everyone was so kind, and, not only because they were
sorry for me, but because even they liked me a little. I felt
that."</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig said:</p>

<p>"My dear child, you are too generous," then could say no more
for tears.</p>

<p>While she sobbed into her handkerchief, Magdalena Sybilla
patted her on the shoulder and added in a voice that was almost
gay:</p>

<p>"It was good for me, too, Madame, I have been too sheltered.
Everything has been too shielded from me, my life has been very
strange and very dull. Last night! why, it was like a glass of
wine! I learnt, too, that I can do things, that I can be,
perhaps, courageous and well-mannered under difficulties."</p>

<p>"I make no excuses," sobbed the Princess Hedwig. "Do me that
justice to observe that I make no excuses. There is nothing to be
said for him&mdash;nothing at all."</p>

<p>"No," replied the other lady gravely and reflectively, "I will
not do you that injustice to suppose that you would come here to
make excuses, but I, I may do so. I may say that he is very
young, that it was his twenty-first birthday, that he had been
with his wild companions, that he had drunk so much wine that he
had forgotten it was your house and did not remember who I
was."</p>

<p>"We must not talk any more of it!" exclaimed the Princess
Hedwig. Suddenly she stifled her sobs and drew herself up with a
resolute air. "He will make amends. He has thought himself of how
to do this."</p>

<p>The other Princess frowned, though there was a smile on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, are we never to have the end of this bad business? I
am going away this morning and I do not want to see him again. I
do not say that in unkindness, you know, but I do not think that
I could endure him to come and apologise."</p>

<p>"You must not think him so base as that," murmured Prince
Chlodwig's mother, "he would not wish to inflict on you an
apology. It is an offence he feels can only be effaced one
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>Magdalena Sybilla interrupted with an impatient little wave of
her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame, what a pity this has to be referred to! Who told
him? He would never by himself have remembered."</p>

<p>"There were not lacking those who told him, and if there had
been none I myself should have done so."</p>

<p>Princess Magdalena Sybilla was now a little curious. She was
still immensely sorry for these people; she wondered how they
were ever going to put themselves right with themselves. She
thought: "Perhaps still something more is required of me. Perhaps
I ought not to run away but stay and face him and help them."</p>

<p>"Madame, have you seen your son this morning already, early as
it is."</p>

<p>"I have not left him all night. As soon as the ball was over I
went to his rooms. He and I&mdash;we have been together."</p>

<p>Still curious, still compassionate, the other Princess said
delicately:</p>

<p>"I hope that Prince Chlodwig is not angry with Rozsika?"</p>

<p>"He never wishes to see her again. When he recalls that he was
ever attracted by such a creature he loathes himself."</p>

<p>Magdalena Sybilla raised her sensitive brows.</p>

<p>"He could not then have been fond of her," she murmured, "or
he would have passed her faults."</p>

<p>"He knows her now as she really is, that laugh can never be
pardoned. I have sent to her father already and advised him to
take his daughter away from the Court&mdash;away, if possible,
from Luneburg Hohenheim."</p>

<p>"A pity!" murmured the ugly Princess with a sigh. "They made
such an exquisite couple."</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig caressed her pomaded locks which had
become somewhat dishevelled during her night's vigil. She looked
fatigued but not downcast as in a firm voice she said:</p>

<p>"There is now only one woman in the world whom my son can
marry&mdash;only one woman whom he wishes to marry."</p>

<p>The other Princess rather wondered what this had to do with
herself and with the incidents of last night, but she said
politely:</p>

<p>"Who is she? Have I seen her? Was she at the ball last
night?"</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig gave her a glance which seemed to comment
on her innocence.</p>

<p>"It is yourself, my dear Magdalena Sybilla. My son can marry
no one but yourself."</p>

<p>A deep flush stained the sallow cheeks of the Princess
Magdalena Sybilla. She sank down into the high-backed chair by
the window and said nothing. The sunlight fell on her crooked
features and her hands worked nervously in her lap. The Princess
Hedwig continued to speak eagerly with infinite energy.</p>

<p>"Do not you see this is the only possible action for him to
take? He suggested it and I agreed at once. You will marry him,
won't you, Magdalena? He can offer you a better position than
that of Abbess of Gandersheim. I am very, very fond of you
already and I do believe you like me a little. You are brilliant,
clever, so intelligent! Everybody remarked on it last night. I
daresay you will be his salvation. Underneath his gallant
exterior he really is a young fool. You will be able to save him
by your tact, wit and kindness from a hundred disasters." She
glanced sideways at the other Princess who did not speak or move.
"Think what services you have done him already! You have set him
free from a woman like Rozsika, you have made him ashamed of
himself for the first time in his life&mdash;and consider how
good that is for him&mdash;you have humbled his pride and his
self-confidence, you have made him take a vow never to touch a
drop of wine again&mdash;and think what a rarity that is in a
gentleman and how much it will be to his advantage in dealing
with others! And now," she hurried on nervously after another
glance at the immobile young woman by the window, "you will do
him yet another service if you accept his hand which he offers so
humbly to you.</p>

<p>"You will restore him his sense of self-respect, you will have
allowed him to do the only thing that is possible to save him
from his self-disdain, from his profound humiliation."</p>

<p>A little smile hovered at the corners of the pale lips of the
ugly Princess.</p>

<p>"All this for him," she thought, "but what of me? What is any
of it going to mean to me? But I must not forget that it is his
mother who speaks."</p>

<p>"Madame, you offer me a very brilliant destiny." She inclined
her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, no nothing beyond your birth and your merit. You will be
very popular, everyone will love you." And the Princess Hedwig
continued, in her mellow, pleasant and anxious voice, to dilate
on the advantages to Prince Chlodwig and to Luneburg Hohenheim on
seeing this Princess on the throne. How her tact would soothe
away difficulties for the headstrong young man, how her kindness
would win him popularity, how her wisdom would guide his
policies, how her penetration would choose his friends!</p>

<p>"But I," thought the other wistfully, "might be happier in
Gandersheim."</p>

<p>Aloud she said, rising and dropping a low curtsey, so that her
plain grey dress billowed gracefully around her ungraceful
limbs:</p>

<p>"Madame, you do me a very great honour. The amends you propose
to make for the unfortunate incidents of last night are
fantastic, extravagant, not to be thought of! I perceive that you
have a very delicate sense of honour with which you have taught
to your son and that neither of you can be at ease, until, by
undertaking the most frightful penitence you can think of, you
have put yourselves right in your own estimation." She paused,
then added in another and shorter tone: "But for me it is a worse
than loveless marriage."</p>

<p>"Had you been wed in the ordinary way," the Princess Hedwig
reminded her gently, "it had been to some man whom you had never
seen."</p>

<p>"He would have known nothing of me save a flattering portrait,
and your son has seen me, and&mdash;your pardon, Madame, but he
spoke what was in his heart when he said 'What a disaster.'"</p>

<p>"If you refuse him," cried the Princess Hedwig in despair, "he
will never hold up his head again! I do not know what I should do
with him. He considers himself lost, ruined, dishonoured."</p>

<p>The younger Princess sighed and smiled together.</p>

<p>"They still must think of themselves," she thought, of their
honour, their disgrace, their disaster! "They are doing this
through their own pride and neither of them think of me."</p>

<p>Yet she felt sorry for them. They were generous, honest
people, both of them. She thought of her father, of her mother
and sisters, of the good friends she had at home. They would
regard this fantastic chance as a piece of astonishing good luck,
her father would look happier than he had looked for years when
he heard of her betrothal to the most brilliant prince in the
Empire&mdash;she could see the kindly face alight with
triumph!</p>

<p>One of her sisters could have the Abbey of
Gandersheim&mdash;poor Louisa Maria perhaps, who was only two
years younger than she was and nearly as plain. What rejoicings
there would be in Marienburg, everyone would feel that they had
been personally complimented by the splendid marriage of their
Princess!</p>

<p>This was a prospect hardly to be foregone, a temptation hardly
to be resisted. While, for herself, could she deny it would be
like an enchantment to be betrothed to Prince Chlodwig? Could she
refuse to admit in her secret heart that it would be like
entering again into that realm of dreams on which she had long
since closed the door? It could not last, of course, it would be
but a fairy interlude, a masque on a summer lawn, or a snatch of
music heard as a procession passed. Might it not be, however,
even for a transient space, enjoyed? He would be tender, he would
be courteous, even grateful to her for the chance she gave him to
re-establish himself in his dignity, through her he would again
be a hero in his own eyes.</p>

<p>Should she deny him this supreme satisfaction and go away
peevishly, petulantly to her Abbey?</p>

<p>Her smile deepened to a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame, tell your son that I will receive his
addresses."</p>

<br>

<h3>THIRD MOVEMENT. ALLEGRETTO TRANQUILLO CON GRAZIA</h3>

<p class="first">
PRINCE CHLODWIG rose phoenix-like from the ashes of his own
humiliation, with a re-burnished grandeur he shone in the eyes of
his admirers re-established as the <i>preux</i> cavalier that he
had always affected to be, his pose of sensitive nobility
returned, the bright glitter of his much-vaunted honour was
untarnished.</p>

<p>He had always, from his cradle, been popular but never so
popular as when his betrothal to the slighted Princess was
announced. He was extolled from the farthest corners of his
little kingdom. Everyone commented on his generosity, on his
nobility, and the splendour of the reparation he had made for
what was, after all, but a trivial and insignificant fault.</p>

<p>"They do not seem to think, they do not seem to consider,"
mused the betrothed Princess, "that by this flamboyant amend,
they call attention to my humiliation. Everyone now, the whole
Empire, knows that he said: 'The ugly Princess! What a disaster!'
whereas if I had gone to Gandersheim and he had married Rozsika
there would not have been more than perhaps a score who would
have been ever aware of what happened."</p>

<p>Her situation was outwardly, indeed, enviable. As she had
supposed her family was delighted, transported by her good news.
She was popular too in the Capital of Luneburg Hohenheim; she had
expensive clothes, well-tailored, and wide hats with plumes, and
when she rode abroad she made, in the saddle, not such an ill
figure. The people both at the Court and in the city admired her
good temper, her pleasant voice, her gentle humour, and she was
wise enough never to challenge her insecure happiness. She never
expected much attention from him, she never asked him if, after
all, he found her so abhorrent. She never demanded his time nor
his attention, she never strained his courtesy.</p>

<p>Then he was all that a grateful, that a humble duty could
inspire him to be&mdash;her most obedient cavalier, her most
submissive escort.</p>

<p>His character seemed to have changed since the banishment of
Rozsika&mdash;he had abandoned his frivolous and wanton
companions, he devoted several hours a day to business, his dress
became less fantastic. He dismissed his coloured pages and his
Italian lute players, he did not spend so many hours at tennis
and at billiards. People murmured that the gentle Princess had a
good influence on her future husband...</p>

<p>The Princess Hedwig and Baron Hagemann, who had been for long
the anxious guardians of the headstrong young man, were most
joyful.</p>

<p>They were seldom alone together, she was careful to avoid a
solitude that might have proved embarrassing to him, but he often
sent her presents, an often asked her advice. Magdalena would lay
awake through the most part of the brief summer night saying to
herself like a prayer: "I must not come to love him! I must not
come to love him!"</p>

<p>They were to be married in September, there was nothing to
wait for, no negotiations to be put through. She had no dowry;
her father's blessing was eagerly sent. It was the Princess
Hedwig who bought her clothes, who lent her jewels and
horses.</p>

<p>Gandersheim waited for an Abbess. Louisa Maria would not,
after all, accept that post. She had not entirely forgotten her
hopes of an earthly felicity. Sometimes the Princess Magdalena
Sybilla thought with regret of that vision of white cloisters and
green grass plots and ancient lime trees surrounding a long
church, a pleasant dwelling in which quiet souls serene in
abnegation might dwell on philosophy, on the arts, on the
goodness of God.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have, for all the outward show, abandoned the
substance for the shadow. My position here is wholly false and
hollow. I do not understand this man&mdash;who is six years
younger than I am and that's a deal of difference. Can I ever
make him know me? Could I ever make him love me? If we marry
should we have children who would bring us together, would he
come to dislike and even hate me? He has betrothed himself to me
to please his pride and in one moment of self-disgust. That mood
will not go on for ever, and then, even if I were his bride,
Rozsika might creep back, not to the Palace this time, perhaps,
but to some villa outside the city walls. While I should be
lonely, waiting, day after day, night after night, pitying while
I waited. If it were not Rozsika, it would be another. He is so
young and what have I, who have never pleased him at all, what
have I to hold him?"</p>

<p>She walked alone in the lofty avenues of the garden where the
first leaves began to fall. It was a day when milk and pearls
seemed blended in the air, veils of gold were swathed about the
golden foliage of the beech trees. The Residentzschloss, white,
clean, and many-turreted, rose from terrace after terrace with
gilded balustrades.</p>

<p>It was the most beautiful place she had ever seen, or she was
sure, she was ever likely to see. On a lake, flat and bright as a
lady's mirror, swans floated; she saw that a man, whose ungainly
figure and dark habit was in melancholy contrast with the serene
gaiety of the scene, was feeding the white birds. There was
something in his dejected and resigned attitude as he tossed the
scraps from his basket on to the surface of the lake that moved
the ready tenderness of the Princess.</p>

<p>She approached him along the straight gravel path; there was
something about him that seemed familiar and yet she could not
place where she had seen him before. As he heard her approaching
step he looked round timidly, and when she saw him full in the
face she recognised him&mdash;it was the violinist who had
dropped his instrument on the night of the ball. She paused in
her walk; she noted that he no longer wore the palace livery of
white and purple, that his clothes were shabby, his hair
ragged&mdash;he had the air of an under-gardener.</p>

<p>"But surely," she said impulsively, "it is you!"</p>

<p>He bowed very low, with a flush on his unhappy and embarrassed
face.</p>

<p>"I am Johann Böhm."</p>

<p>"The violinist?"</p>

<p>"I was the violinist, madame." He added hastily: "Would Your
Highness care to see the swans fed? It is really very charming to
observe how they glide over the water with their wings arched
up."</p>

<p>Magdalena Sybilla looked at the swans, but she was not
thinking of them but rather thus: "He was the only one who made a
diversion to save me&mdash;clumsy and stupid, no doubt, but he
made it and it served its purpose. How ridiculous he looked, poor
fellow, sprawling after his instrument! That made people laugh,
gave them an excuse to pretend it was a jest. But I have never
thought of him since. How ungrateful one is when one is self-
absorbed!"</p>

<p>"I remember you very well," she said shyly and gravely. "You
do not wear your musician's coat? Is it part of your duty to feed
the swans?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am no longer in the orchestra, Highness."</p>

<p>"No? And why?"</p>

<p>"I was dismissed. That was quite just, you know. I was
extremely clumsy and I smashed the violin&mdash;it was a very
valuable Italian instrument."</p>

<p>Magdalena Sybilla coloured painfully and stammered in her
reply:</p>

<p>"There has been some mistake. Oh, but this is impossible!
Everyone knows, everyone understood. You were not clumsy."</p>

<p>"I was ridiculous, Highness."</p>

<p>"No, nor ridiculous, either. It is absurd! I must tell Prince
Chlodwig."</p>

<p>He did not reply. She had expected eager thanks for her
promised intervention, but the tall, clumsy fellow stood silent.
His hands (and they, although his frame was gaunt and bony, were
finely made&mdash;a musician's hands) were busy and trembling in
the basket of scraps that he had set on the marble verge of the
lake; he was on one knee beside it and threw the succulent
morsels one after another on to the shining surface where, before
the swans darted at them, they made ever-growing ripples.</p>

<p>"Is this your employment now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Highness, and I am glad to have it. The gardener is fond
of music&mdash;I mean the head gardener, Von Handersheim, you
know." A smile quivered for a second on his coarse lips; he gave
her an appealing glance. "I am not very clever at any
work&mdash;I could find none, and so I was forced to come back
here, though I was not very willing to return to the palace. Von
Handersheim was kind&mdash;he has me on trial for a week."</p>

<p>This sounded incoherent to her strained attention.</p>

<p>"But you have been to the Prince?" she asked. "He&mdash;he
would&mdash;" She could not speak the words. What she had meant,
what she wished to say was: "He would reward you for helping me,
for trying, however foolishly and clumsily, to cover up his
disgrace."</p>

<p>The young musician replied reluctantly:</p>

<p>"It was His Highness who dismissed me."</p>

<p>She could hardly believe that. She stood
incredulous&mdash;staring.</p>

<p>"Dismissed you! And when?"</p>

<p>"The day after the ball, Highness."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"For my great clumsiness, Highness, in breaking the violin."
And he added hastily: "I make no complaint, it was quite just. I
knew when I did it what would happen."</p>

<p>"Did you? And why?"</p>

<p>"I know the Prince, Highness," he replied simply.</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;you know the Prince!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Highness. I have been in the palace since we were both
boys, children, indeed."</p>

<p>"So! you know him like that&mdash;intimately, and you expected
that he would behave as in fact he has behaved? His mother, the
Princess Hedwig, does she know?"</p>

<p>"I could not tell you, Highness. I do not think she would
greatly care one way or another as long as His Highness was
pleased. She would not, one understands, interfere with him or
his wishes, anyway."</p>

<p>The sallow pinched face of the Princess was very pale.</p>

<p>"He uses people, Johann Böhm, is that so? He must shine in his
own eyes, no one else must share in his applause?"</p>

<p>The musician did not reply, but continued with a mournful air
to throw the morsels to the swans.</p>

<p>"You are fond of music?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Highness. I compose a little. But it is
difficult&mdash;people do not pay any attention. It cannot be
expected that they should."</p>

<p>She perceived that here was a spirit, as meek, as resigned as
her own.</p>

<p>"Are you married?" she asked. "Have you parents, or any tie in
this city?"</p>

<p>He replied: "None;" and he named the town a long way off from
which he had wandered as an orphan child many years ago, playing
on a willow whistle made of pith by the roadside, for his food.
He repeated that he had always loved music however made.</p>

<p>"I shall soon be on my travels again," he added. "Your
Highness has a very kind heart, but it must not be troubled for
me. When I have saved up a few crowns to buy a little instrument
I shall begin to take the road again. By playing outside the inns
I can soon earn my food and, when the weather is rough, a bed.
The winter is coming on and one must think of these things," he
added with a smile. "Then, perhaps at some other Court, I may
find my fortune again."</p>

<p>"Or your misfortune," she smiled. "How pure those swans keep
their plumage, Herr Böhm! We are, few of us, so diligent or so
lucky&mdash;only too easily we become soiled."</p>

<p>She returned to the Residentzschloss and she put off at once
the expensive clothes for which the Princess Hedwig had so
generously and so tactfully paid. She put aside the jewels and
ornaments that that kind hostess had lent her and she took from
her drawers and caskets all the lavish presents which had been
given her by Prince Chlodwig, and she bade her ancient servant
pack up the modest baggage in which she had come to Luneburg
Hohenheim.</p>

<p>Then, when she was attired in her plain travelling dress in
which a few weeks before she had arrived at the charming city,
she went to the cabinet where Prince Chlodwig at this hour always
worked diligently by himself.</p>

<p>She paused a little before she tapped on the door. She did not
want to discover that he was asleep or smoking or idling over a
frivolous book, for she did not want to find out that he was
wholly deceitful. But she need not have alarmed herself; he
answered at once to her timid tap and he was really employed at
his bureau with piles of documents and maps before him.</p>

<p>He was startled that she should thus wait on him, and rose,
embarrassed, protesting. And then when he saw her attire he
exclaimed at that.</p>

<p>"It is what I wore when you first saw me on the balcony." She
smiled and held out her hand in a friendly fashion. "Do not let
us pretend any more, Chlodwig. I hope you will be very fortunate.
The appointment at Gandersheim is still open; I am going there
to-morrow. Wish me luck, too."</p>

<p>He would have protested, he would have expressed amaze,
chagrin, an outraged wonderment, but her sincerity broke down his
protests. He stared at her, coloured, and stammered.</p>

<p>"It has been," she said kindly, "a delicious make-belief. I
never meant it to continue."</p>

<p>"I wish it could, Magdalena; it meant a great deal to me."</p>

<p>She smiled wistfully as she thought to herself: "He never
thinks what <i>he</i> may have meant to <i>me.</i> How impossible
for me to tell him I have discovered he is not the man I thought
he was."</p>

<p>She looked at him very keenly and saw under his bewilderment a
certain relief. It had been, then, a strain, this maintenance of
a heroic pose. She could not avoid seeing on his desk a paper
with the name "Rozsika" written across. Well, it was only
natural! How could she have supposed that such as he could
breathe in such an atmosphere of rarefied virtue and abnegation?
He made another effort to maintain his chivalry. It was not so
difficult, for he really admired her. He was used to relying on
his mother and on Baron Hagemann, and lately of relying a little
on her. He did not wish to lose any of this support. With some
sincerity he began to plead with her determination.</p>

<p>"Are you not giving up something after all, Magdalena? An
Abbess!&mdash;what is that? Do you dislike me?" Vanity
pathetically strove for reassurances on this point, she saw an
offended pride in his glance. It was, of course, incredible to
him that any woman could forgo him and all he offered. She gave
him all that was in her power to offer at his shrine; she could
afford to do so.</p>

<p>"I am not good enough," she said meekly. Behind his protests
she sensed the serenity of one who is appeased.</p>

<br>

<h3>FOURTH MOVEMENT. Adagio Maestoso (VARIAZIONE FINALE E
CODA)</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Princess sighed when she thought of the disappointment of
her father and her family.</p>

<p>"However," she consoled herself; though a little wistfully,
"one cannot satisfy everyone. And he has the satisfaction of
knowing that his daughter has refused the most brilliant prince
in the Empire."</p>

<p>They had overwhelmed her with every courtesy, the Prince and
his mother, but after a little while they had not striven to
break her resolution. She was sure they were very glad that she
had not insisted on a prolongation of the sacrifice. They had
accomplished their purpose, re-instated themselves in their own
esteem and in that of their subjects and neighbours. The glow of
a generous deed would remain with them, though the price of that
deed would not be exacted.</p>

<p>She had had the good sense to see how abominable it was to
expect a man like Prince Chlodwig really to marry her, but that
did not, in the eyes of his contemporaries, lessen his chivalry
and generosity.</p>

<p>If Rozsika or another like her came to the Court once more,
well, it would only be natural, and who would there be to blame?
He would forget that she had laughed, he would only remember how
lovely she had looked.</p>

<p>She, Magdalena Sybilla, had served her turn. She had helped
him to redeem himself, he was once again the brilliant hero, the
gilded cavalier, the resplendent young Prince. She had not been,
she flattered herself, without a certain effect on his character.
She had not observed him drink during their brief betrothal,
though there had been a certain affectation in the ostentation of
his abstinence. Well, let that pass, too. He was but one-and-
twenty, in time he would outgrow his whims and fancies and no
doubt become a steadfast and an honourable man and perhaps she
would be the only one who would ever be aware of the real
weakness of his character, and even she would never have known of
it if she had not come upon Johann Böhm feeding the swans on a
lake which was like a lady's mirror in the garden where the first
leaves of autumn began to fall. He was a man who could not endure
to lose, who could not suffer that an inferior should excel him.
Where he had behaved ill no other must behave well.</p>

<p>He honoured her departure with very great courtesy. An escort
was placed at her disposal; gifts she was not allowed to refuse
were placed in her baggage-waggon. Standing there before all his
people he kissed her hand as she sat in her carriage and
regretted once more, with many vows and protestations, that she
had felt herself unable to carry out that marriage contract.</p>

<p>He promised himself a visit some day, perhaps soon, perhaps
immediately, to Gandersheim, that noblest of Abbeys that would
now have the noblest of Abbesses...</p>

<p>He played his part perfectly and she admired him with a
certain compassion and she was sorry that his eye should chance
to rest upon a humble figure among her servants. As he recognised
that gaunt form, those spare, harsh features, he forgot his
dignity and his equanimity and exclaimed harshly:</p>

<p>"Johann Böhm goes with you?"</p>

<p>She replied with a meekness that was not assumed:</p>

<p>"The Abbess of Gandersheim is allowed an orchestra, and Herr
Böhm plays the violin very well."</p>

<p>The young Prince opened his lips as if about to speak, but was
silent. He seemed entirely withdrawn into himself, hostile not
only to her, but to all the world. He bowed again with stiff
military precision; behind this salutation she sensed an abrupt,
a disdainful dismissal.</p>

<p>She had not meant to say any more, but his obvious hardening,
his antagonistic glance, though it did not provoke her, decided
her to add gently, bowing from the window of the gilded coach
which his noble generosity had provided:</p>

<p>"Herr Böhm and I promised ourselves some <i>duettos</i> at
Gandersheim. He has now a new violin, of a finer tone than that
he broke. And I brought from home my spinet which is painted with
a charming landscape of Love."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. THE HYACINTH BLOOM</h2>

<p class="first">
THEY had always disliked each other with a firm, unchangeable
dislike; often expressed in words on the part of the master and
glances and gestures on the part of the servant. They had
remained together for nearly forty years, from expediency or
custom. De Ravignac paid well and was just in his dealings;
Jacques was a good and honest servant.</p>

<p>De Ravignac aged first; he was suddenly an old man: his
beautiful youth, his superb manhood seemed stolen from him as
suddenly as the gold watch and sapphire seal that had been
snatched out of his pocket one dusky blue evening as he entered
the Opera. He also had lost most of his money, his estates, his
credit; partly through his own extravagant vices, partly because
his class, which had so long battened on the labours of the
plebeians, was in turn plucked and stripped. He had never cared
about politics&mdash;nor, indeed, about anything save himself;
but a revolution he was forced to notice. His friends, his
mistresses, his property disappeared; he was too old to fight in
the press, too feeble to raise his voice in the tumult; too old,
he declared, to be able to die a violent death with decency. With
a sneer he retired to a little <i>château</i> he owned in the
Limousin. All his servants had been dismissed or had left; only
Jacques remained. De Ravignac kept him, he said, because he was
cheap, and Jacques said he stayed because he was too old to find
work or even a home elsewhere. They lived alone, save for a
village woman or two, in the pleasant little country house, and
regarded each other with contempt.</p>

<p>De Ravignac had his books, his comforts, his flower-beds. He
had discovered a passion for horticulture: even when gout held
him in his room, he received a pleasure that was almost violent
from contemplating the parterres beneath his windows. Jacques
waited on him precisely, efficiently. He gave that one chamber
the air of an apartment in a palace; his service hinted at many
lackeys beyond the door; but the other parts of the
<i>château</i> were unfurnished. Everything had been stolen or
sold, and Jacques mended his own livery and gave a
<i>gourmet's</i> touch to the rough cooking of <i>Mère</i>
Bonnot.</p>

<p>De Ravignac had never condescended to ask the opinions of
Jacques, who had been born a peasant and had become a servant;
but Jacques was a liberal, a progressive. Whenever he was with
his own class he proclaimed his eager sympathy with the people,
his delight in the "Age of Reason" and the "Rights of man." Many
times he had been asked: "Why do you stay with an aristocrat? Why
do you perform these menial services for an enemy of France? You
should have seen he was put out of the way long ago..." And the
reply of Jacques was always the same: he was saving his master
for a tit-bit of revenge; he had so much stored up against de
Ravignac; so many insults, neglects, quietly borne; such a long
tale of endless service accepted without a shade of thanks or
even recognition; such a long-garnered hatred against a man in
whom not even his friends nor his lovers had found a single
virtue. Yes, yes, that was it: he was staying by de Ravignac till
the moment should be quite ripe&mdash;and he would strike with
all the force of accumulated years of patient waiting. Oh, yes!
he was still strong, vigorous&mdash;how different from <i>cet
animal-là</i> worn out by his sins!</p>

<p>This attitude on the part of Jacques had been the means of
saving, several times, the life of de Ravignac. His servant's
friends declared that it was but just that Jacques should have
the handling of the affair; and when the shabby carriage passed
the Paris barriers, some <i>sans-culottes</i> on the outlook for
prey had whispered: "Let them go&mdash;his executioner is on the
box!"</p>

<p>The Limousin was quiet with the peace of devastation, but even
there some keen prying peasants remained who questioned sharply
the seeming devotion of Jacques to his hateful old master&mdash;a
cruel landlord, a man of whom no good was ever said; a fine
specimen of the vermin from whom France was to be cleansed! Why
was Jacques, himself one of the people, serving, even petting and
coddling, the villainous old dog? Even <i>Mère</i> Bonnot wanted
to know that: "You wait on him like a slave; he lacks for
nothing; you even fuss about his cooking, keeping a bit of silver
for him to eat off&mdash;wearing his livery&mdash;even looking
after his flowers!"</p>

<p>"I'm waiting," Jacques would answer, showing his long teeth.
"He's mine. I'm to do what I like with him." Then even
<i>Mère</i> Bonnot refused to come any more; the temper of the
times was more fierce; it wasn't safe to work at the
<i>château,</i> she declared.</p>

<p>"What more do the people want?" grinned Jacques, polishing his
buttons, which bore the de Ravignac crest. "They don't pay any
rent; they've stripped the <i>château</i> and the park."</p>

<p>"They don't think he should be allowed to live."</p>

<p>"Tell them to leave that to me."</p>

<p>Early in the lovely gay April mornings, while de Ravignac
slept, Jacques worked silently in the flower-beds beneath his
window. De Ravignac, peering out, could not know that all other
portions of the garden were a tangle of neglect: failing eyesight
had brought his horizon very close; he affected to believe that
there were several gardeners, several indoor servants remaining,
that Jacques was still merely his own body-servant; and often,
with cold elegance, he complained of Jacques, as he had
complained all his life.</p>

<p>"You rascal, you are not worth what I pay you&mdash;how
fortunate for you to be in my service! You are past work, that is
what's the matter&mdash;old and incapable, Jacques."</p>

<p>His fine hands would pass the wages of Jacques across the
marquetry table. He had brought a small hoard of coin from Paris;
as he never counted this, he did not know that while he slept
Jacques frequently replenished it from his own savings.</p>

<p>"I shall have to dismiss you, Jacques, you become every day
more clumsy and stupid."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monseigneur le Marquis."</p>

<p>It was a delicious spring, like the youth of the world; strong
green leaves thrust up through the carefully kept soil beneath
the window of de Ravignac as the lusty plants forced up to the
sunshine, which was thick and sweet like Narbonne honey. "It will
be agreeable," remarked de Ravignac, "when the flowers
appear."</p>

<p>Though his physical powers failed so rapidly, his spirit was
not clouded; he was still arrogant, alert, malicious. Though his
eyes were sunk in their sockets, they still turned glances of
amused contempt, of wicked raillery, on Jacques. He scorned to
think of the possibility of a changed world; his lofty cynical
intelligence appeared to be satisfied with his books, his game of
solitaire, his hyacinth border. He was like an aged bird of prey,
gaunt, still magnificent, in his dying moments gazing at a few
bright feathers from the gorgeous affrays of the past.</p>

<p>Jacques (who kept him exquisitely&mdash;linen, food, lace, and
napery) wondered if the bright green leaves, the rich promise of
blossom, reminded him of those bold, joyous sins of his which the
servant had witnessed for so many years.</p>

<p>"That white flower will be the first, Jacques. I wish it
potted and brought in here when the blossoms appear."</p>

<p>"Very good, Monseigneur le Marquis."</p>

<p>The morning that de Ravignac gave these orders, a threatening
group appeared before the <i>château</i> where the two old men
dwelt alone: a straggle of soldiers of the Republic passing
through the village had been informed of the continued existence
of the <i>ci-devant</i> Marquis. They battered on the door; a
moment after, the silver bell of de Ravignac rang. Jacques, who
had seen the soldiers from the window, went first to his master's
room. He believed that de Ravignac knew everything; perhaps he
was going to ask for mercy&mdash;he, Louis Anne de Ravignac!</p>

<p>De Ravignac said: "I intend to reduce your wages. It is
regrettable that I have not been able to train you better. You
are still very clumsy and incompetent. Why doesn't someone answer
those knocks?"</p>

<p>When Jacques went to the door, opened it, and showed his large
powerful hands glistening with blood, the citizen soldiers
grinned approvingly; <i>Mère</i> Bonnot had told them already the
story of the patient old servant hoarding his revenge.</p>

<p>"Too late!" he snarled. "Why, what do you suppose? Just now he
told me he was going to reduce my wages..."</p>

<p>They went away; they agreed that if there was any plunder left
in the <i>château</i> it belonged to Jacques, who had waited so
long for his reward. With them went the remaining villagers; the
whole countryside was deserted; it had become the kingdom of
Jacques, where he was not likely to be again disturbed.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and very carefully washed his hands,
while he considered what sauce would most successfully make the
rabbit taste like chicken. On the shelf was a freshly-potted
white flower; the purity of the clustered bells was as intense as
light incarnate. Jacques carried this to de Ravignac's elegant
chamber. Arrogant and cool, the haughty old man waited. Jacques
was sure that he understood everything; why, his glance, guarded
under his full-folded lids, even fell to a speck of the rabbit's
blood under the thick nails of Jacques' scrubbed fingers.</p>

<p>"This is the first hyacinth to blossom, Monseigneur le
Marquis."</p>

<p>Their gaze met for a quick second across the radiancy of the
perfect bloom; Jacques felt an inexpressible joy as de Ravignac
serenely remarked: "It is a fine blossom. Thank you,
Jacques."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. ELEGY AT DAWN</h2>

<p class="first">
THE carriage bearing the wounded man from the defeat hurried
through the ravine. The jagged rocks were so high, the gorge was
so narrow that only when the sun was at its zenith, did the rays
strike into the dark defile which cut for miles through the
mountains.</p>

<p>Veils of water gushed down the clefts of sombre granite;
clusters of fern, trails of ivy and clumps of moss freshly green,
glittered with drops of moisture; high above the ravine, tall
pines showed blue black plumes.</p>

<p>The loose stone rattled under the vehicle, and some crushed
beneath its wheels; the two frightened white horses plunged
forward as if they had the bit between their teeth.</p>

<p>"For God's sake not so fast! We shall overturn!" cried the
corporal who was beside the coachman. "You will lose a
wheel!"</p>

<p>"We shall go more slowly when the frontier is reached,"
shouted the other, sending his long whip curling round the
sweating flanks of the straining beasts.</p>

<p>"We may have crossed it already for all I know," muttered the
other. "It is a pity we have lost the escort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those fellows following us? Who were they?"</p>

<p>The corporal dryly grinned.</p>

<p>"I saw one or two generals&mdash;that was Lichenstein who was
down&mdash;his animal rolled on him. Well, we have distanced them
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By now they are in the hands of the enemy. It's firing that I
still hear?"</p>

<p>"It is not possible that we still make a stand," muttered the
corporal, trying to distinguish some sound beyond the clatter of
the carriage&mdash;cannon, surely&mdash;no&mdash;thunder. A storm
was coming up over the mountains.</p>

<p>Clinging to the gold braided cloth of the seat the soldier
looked up at the strip of sky visible above the dark sides of the
ravine; purple clouds were closing over the azure; the thunder
rolled again.</p>

<p>"Shall we not stop to see if he be dead or alive?" suggested
the corporal; the coachman made no answer and the soldier
resigned himself to his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Phew! What a defeat! Trapped on that barren plateau, the
Imperialists had withstood the fire of the Allies for hours. A
massacre. What a confusion! of movements, of orders, of mingled
disasters. Generals and their staffs galloping aimlessly across
the field in and out of the wood where the artillery smoked, the
trees were suddenly fired and the maddened horses rushed from the
flaming forest...</p>

<p>The standards wavering, down, up again, then down to rise no
more...the pitiful groans of the wounded, men who, a moment
before had seemed the bravest of the brave, incapable of
fear.</p>

<p>"Difficult," thought the corporal, "to be a hero with a bullet
in your entrails or a sabre-cut across the face."</p>

<p>And where had the wine carts been, the waggons with barrels of
water? Not a drop of anything to wash the taste of all this out
of one's mouth.</p>

<p>A hideous defeat. Odd to be rattling away from it, without a
scratch, hastening through this dark, cool ravine.</p>

<p>The road became rougher. The storm darkened down overhead.</p>

<p>"At this pace," grumbled the corporal, "the animals will drop
exhausted and where shall we be then?"</p>

<p>The thunder crashed nearer; a sharp bend in the rocks brought
them in full sight of a water break, dropping sheer, white, tall
as a spectre; maddened by this ghostly menace and the thunder the
wet frightened animals reared and plunged in the taut traces.</p>

<p>"Rein 'em up!" shouted the soldier. "Stop 'ern!" Straining
back all his weight the coachman shouted his last words:</p>

<p>"They've bolted!"</p>

<p>The carriage rocked from side to side, then overturned. The
corporal was flung against the cold surface of the rock and for a
moment stunned.</p>

<p>When he recovered, he thrust his hand into some dropping water
and drank greedily; then, feeling that no bones were broken, he
thought: I must be under the protection of the Devil,' and made
the sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>He looked round for his companions.</p>

<p>The coachman lay sprawling on the stones with a broken neck,
his whip, surmounted by the heavy gold coronet, still in his
hand, his ornate livery spotted by the oncoming rush of rain.</p>

<p>The carriage was smashed, one wheel of; the fine side
panelling, exquisitely painted with a grandiose coat of arms, had
been shattered against the rock; the white horses were struggling
together amid the snapped shaft and entangled reins.</p>

<p>"Gently, my friends, gently," muttered the corporal; he gave a
practised glance at the dead man, then cautiously and after some
difficulty released the scared animals, freeing the leathers with
his bayonet that he had still in his frog.</p>

<p>The thunder rolled above the ravine in a sky completely dark,
the water foamed down the blackness of the rock. The loneliness
was complete. But the soldier was absorbed in his task&mdash;he
was fond of animals.</p>

<p>"They must be under the protection of the Devil, too," he
remarked to himself as he urged the horses to struggle to their
hoofs. Save for some cuts they were unhurt; all strength and
spirit had left them; they stood steaming, with drooping heads,
their flanks rising and falling desperately.</p>

<p>The rain slanted down heavily; the soldier was reflecting in
his slow mind on what he should do, when he suddenly remembered
the occupant of the carriage.</p>

<p>The most important personage to save, and for whom this
desperate flight had been undertaken.</p>

<p>The soldier grinned stupidly. Only yesterday he had stood, a
most insignificant unit of a pompous array of foot, and watched
this man (infinitely far away, it had seemed) move across the
parade ground, stately on his costly charger which kept slow pace
to the Imperial march of the drums and trumpets playing proudly
in the sun. His staff had followed him, glittering with stars and
crosses, with diamonds on their sword hilts and in their
hats&mdash;now the poor corporal had forgotten even the existence
of this mighty man. He did not seem so great in the solitude of
the ravine. Even if he was still alive he had lost
everything.</p>

<p>But the corporal was slightly ill at ease as he peered through
the broken window of the smashed upturned carriage; the occupant,
covered by a travelling cloak, lay huddled and unconscious. And a
curious miscellany of articles were scattered about him; objects
flung in with the indiscriminate haste of panic.</p>

<p>The soldier wrenched open the jammed door and dragged out a
satin pelisse lined with fur, a gorget scrolled with gold, a
travelling toilet-case with all the engraved glass smashed, a
porcelain pipe with crimson tassels, several stars of diamonds
and enamel, a copy of <i>Cortelius</i> and a gilt and crystal
Eucharist wrapped in a tinsel fringed altar cloth.</p>

<p>The interior being freed of these the corporal, who was a
tall, stout fellow, was, after great difficulty, able to lift out
the unfortunate occupant and place him by the roadside with his
head on a wet stone, and the scatter of rich articles (useless in
this place) about him among the green antlers of the ferns.</p>

<p>Scratching his chin, the soldier gazed inquisitively at the
defeated general, who, but a few hours ago had been as far away
from him as the stars, and who now lay so quietly at his
feet.</p>

<p>A queer predicament.</p>

<p>The corporal's curiosity so absorbed him that he made no
attempt to help the other, but continued to stare at him as if he
had been a strange trapped animal.</p>

<p>The general was about his own age and a great deal less than
his strength&mdash;to judge by the look of him; his face was
smooth and pale above the rich cravat, his nose aquiline, his
eyebrows startlingly dark; his thick hair, still heavy with
pomade, hung in loose thick tresses over the shining granite; his
cloak was twisted about his disordered uniform&mdash;the white,
gold and scarlet of the highest Imperial rank.</p>

<p>Slowly he opened his eyes, and as if there was nothing
horrific or even uncommon in the circumstances said:</p>

<p>"I knew that fool was driving too fast."</p>

<p>The soldier withdrew his booby stare.</p>

<p>"He's broken his neck, my prince."</p>

<p>"Then that leaves just you and I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my prince."</p>

<p>The general got to his feet gracefully; to the other's
surprise he did not seem to be hurt at all; he leant against the
rock, however, as if giddy, and held his hand against his
side.</p>

<p>"Who are you, my friend?"</p>

<p>The soldier gave his name and that of his regiment; one that
had been almost wiped out in the day's engagement.</p>

<p>"We both seem to have been unlucky," smiled the general;
despite the composure due to his breeding and position, he turned
even more unnaturally pale as the remembrance of his frightful
defeat rushed into his anguished mind. "Bring me water," he
added. And as the soldier was looking for a drinking cup in the
debris among the stones: "You are a Pomeranian, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my prince." He was surprised that his accent had been
recognised.</p>

<p>He found a flask, filled it and brought it awkwardly to the
general who thanked him gravely.</p>

<p>"Where are the others? Were not some following?"</p>

<p>"We left them behind, sir."</p>

<p>"How did you come to be with me?"</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know, sir. There was a
confusion&mdash;like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hell. I recall. And you were flying for your life, like the
rest of us. But do me the justice to observe that I was
unconscious."</p>

<p>"I saw them lift you in, my prince. They turned your
horse&mdash;you wanted to go back. And then you were hit in the
shoulder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! What does it matter? But it was an ill turn to drive me
away. If I had died then I might have achieved a little glory. As
it is I have completely lost my reputation and shall have to die
just the same."</p>

<p>He rested his head in his hand and seemed to speak to
himself.</p>

<p>"Die? How?" demanded the soldier stupidly.</p>

<p>The other laughed coldly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. This is an unlikely place, is it not?"</p>

<p>He glanced round the dark, still, ravine; the rain had ceased,
only a thin violet haze of cloud blotted the pure blue overhead;
only the lonely sound of the falling water broke the sombre
stillness.</p>

<p>"The horses are alive and fairly sound," suggested the
soldier.</p>

<p>"The carriage horses? But we have no equipment for them. What
is there here that is of any use?"</p>

<p>"Very little, my prince. Neither money, nor food&mdash;all
those things were thrown in&mdash;a panic&mdash;I suppose we
ought to keep the Eucharist."</p>

<p>"Who put that in?"</p>

<p>"Prince Lichenstein, sir."</p>

<p>"An odd thing to do. Was he not with us?"</p>

<p>"I saw him thrown. I think he was killed."</p>

<p>The young General winced; he had refused to take Lichenstein's
advice yesterday; at the final Council of War he had overruled
everyone; with confident audacity he had dared to carry out a
plan of his own. And had failed completely. What could one do in
such circumstances? He hated the well-meaning friends who had
huddled him into his carriage and forced him off the field of
battle. A tattered impression of smoke and flame, of falling men,
of dipping flags rushed across his inner vision as he stared at
the narrow ravine, the water break, the ferns. He moved stiffly,
bruised by two falls, disabled by the flesh wound in his
shoulder. The pure air, the draught of cold water had revived
him, however, and he wondered that he should, on such slight
occasion, have fainted twice; emotion, not the bullet in his
shoulder must have caused him to fall from his horse...he cursed
quietly inwardly his destiny, remaining outwardly so calm that
the corporal thought him without feeling.</p>

<p>"We must leave this place, my poor fellow. Are we over the
frontier yet?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, my prince; this is the wilderness to me."</p>

<p>"And to me also, assuredly."</p>

<p>He inspected the horses with mechanical precision, thinking
the while: "A defeat like that! No excuse whatever. And I fled in
a carriage like a sick girl."</p>

<p>Before his mind floated lines of the dispatches that would be
penned by the victorious generals to their respective Kings:
"Sire, we captured so many cannon, flags, baggage,
prisoners&mdash;a stupendous victory, one that will change the
history, the map of Europe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take one of these horses, and follow me."</p>

<p>"Shall I bring any of these things, sir?" The soldier looked
greedily at the gold and jewels and the scattered objects strewn
in the ravine.</p>

<p>"Bring any weapons or powder. Cover up poor Jacques&mdash;his
business is done."</p>

<p>"Shall we not take, my prince, some of these valuables?" A
returning roll of thunder accompanied the other's answer.</p>

<p>"I shall not need them. And you should not. If you wish to be
of my company you must share in what I seek. Shall I ride
alone?"</p>

<p>The corporal touched nothing of the treasure save the
Eucharist. And that he took with him; he understood little of
what the other remark meant save that it was a rebuke; the
officer added:</p>

<p>"Keep all, and look after yourself if you will."</p>

<p>But the corporal replied doggedly:</p>

<p>"I would rather come with you, sir." And he mounted the other
horse without another look at the valuables scattered on the wet
ground.</p>

<p>These strange companions rode slowly along the ravine on the
weary scared animals, without saddle or stirrups; each thought
how peculiar it was he should be with the other&mdash;the two of
them, the highest and one of the least, thrown together out of
the hideous debris of the fearful defeat; the general, absorbed
in his own frightful thoughts, soon forgot the soldier, but the
soldier remained uneasily aware of the presence of the great,
though fallen gentleman.</p>

<p>Neither spoke until the cleft in the mountains ended sharply
and they emerged on a sloping side of rock through which the road
wound down into the valley which was full of late sunshine that
sparkled in the heavy moisture left by the storm. After so long
in the darkness of the narrow gorge, these wide, luminous
prospects, these far off horizons were bewildering.</p>

<p>Neither of the fugitives knew where he was. The rays of the
sun lay level across the vast open country and a diminishing
glory behind the retreating tempest clouds showed that it would
soon be dark.</p>

<p>The General was wondering how he should employ the few hours
that were all he allowed himself of life; the corporal puzzled
how he should save himself, and, somehow, get back to his home
which was so far away. Both needed shelter, the gentleman a place
in which to think, the peasant a place in which to sleep.</p>

<p>Where the mountain broke into the plain appeared a small but
fine house rising from a terraced garden and shaded by the light
boughs of a group of fernlike swamp cedars; a small open
<i>belvedere</i> was pierced by the translucent scarlet gold of
the sunset; in the <i>parterres</i> bright petalled flowers lay
bent beneath the onslaught of the recent rain; all the doors and
windows seemed closed.</p>

<p>"We will go there," said the General.</p>

<p>"It is certainly deserted, sir."</p>

<p>"It will serve us better if it is."</p>

<p>The light iron gates opened easily; they rode along a path
between high banked laurel and oleanders; a rough-looking servant
thrust his head out of the house door and rudely demanded their
business.</p>

<p>"A little hospitality," said the General; he was incurably
romantic and at once imagined that the lonely house held some
beautiful woman whose graces and favours might gild his farewell
to life; the corporal was ashamed of his humble personality and
would have turned away, but the General, whom the servant
instinctively recognised as master, detained him by a
gesture.</p>

<p>The man who had spied their uniforms, began a tirade against
all soldiers...his gutteral accents were raucous.</p>

<p>"I think we have not got across the frontier," said the
General. "On which side is your master&mdash;or&mdash;is it your
mistress?"</p>

<p>"My master doesn't care a damn for either side. Be off, only a
day ago he filled some rascals like you full of shot&mdash;"</p>

<p>An upper window was thrown open and a young man in an untidy
chamber robe looked out; he gripped a pistol and began to shout
angrily.</p>

<p>The General interrupted.</p>

<p>"We are a couple of fugitives from the battle&mdash;we want a
few hours' repose."</p>

<p>"You and your battles are an infernal nuisance," grumbled the
young man. "This is the second time I've been
interrupted&mdash;however, if you behave yourself; I suppose that
you may come in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An eccentric," smiled the General.</p>

<p>The gruff servant opened reluctantly the door wider, and,
descending the few steps, led away the horses; the young man left
the window and came down to the hall; he dispelled quickly the
general's romantic hopes.</p>

<p>"I live here alone. I am a musician. This house was given me
by a patron that I might work in quiet. And now nothing but
hellish interruptions!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir, with a war raging&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that. What has the war to do with me? I
am a citizen of Venice. You, I suppose, a German?"</p>

<p>"Austrian. My name is Charles Ferdinand."</p>

<p>He had thought that his face, his uniform, his name would be
instantly recognised, but he perceived that none of them meant
anything to the musician who regarded him blankly.</p>

<p>"And your man?"</p>

<p>"A Pomeranian corporal. We were both unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Why? You seem to have whole skins."</p>

<p>"We ought to have died in the battle."</p>

<p>"What rubbish!"</p>

<p>"It was a most frightful defeat."</p>

<p>"For whom?"</p>

<p>"For us."</p>

<p>"I see. Excuse me, but I don't really know anything about it
What is the war about, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I had the misfortune to command on the
losing side&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A general of division?"</p>

<p>"Call it that, if you will. I see none of this means anything
to you."</p>

<p>"It doesn't. Why can't I be left in peace? All this fighting
is damned folly. Still, you look good company." The general
bowed.</p>

<p>"I am credited with some social gifts."</p>

<p>"Come in and have supper."</p>

<p>"And my companion?"</p>

<p>"Hermann, who is a useful fellow, will give him
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>The General commanded:</p>

<p>"Guard your tongue, await my orders," and dismissed the
corporal.</p>

<p>The musician conducted his guest into an agreeable room where
the lamp had just been lit and a cold supper stood ready; walls
and furniture were encumbered by musical instruments, bursting
portfolios held manuscripts, albums and scores; the windows stood
open on to the terrace, the drenched gardens, the violet
twilight.</p>

<p>The General glanced round; he felt inclined to laugh; the
thought of himself being hurtled away from the defeat through the
ravine, of the accident, of the huge Pomeranian dragging him from
the carriage ("how the devil did he do it?") seemed now
amusing.</p>

<p>Stiff, bruised and shaken, he flung himself into the best
chair as he had been used to do all his life, and graciously told
his host to be seated.</p>

<p>The musician was inclined to take this as an impertinence; he
glowered doubtfully at the unfinished piece of music scattered
over a clavecin.</p>

<p>"I have interrupted a composition?"</p>

<p>The other thrust his fingers through his untidy hair.</p>

<p>"Yes. I should have finished it after supper."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"An <i>Elegy</i>&gt;."</p>

<p>"It is very appropriate. Why do you write an
<i>Elegy</i>?"</p>

<p>Exasperated, the musician broke out angrily:</p>

<p>"How the devil should I know? How can I tell where these
things come from that I hear in my head?"</p>

<p>"I perceive you live in a world of fantasy. What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Jacopo."</p>

<p>"No other?"</p>

<p>"I am like you, I have Christian names only&mdash;"</p>

<p>Confused for a moment the guest replied:</p>

<p>"Ah, my name&mdash;it would sound strange here&mdash;" Making
an effort over his frightful melancholy he exclaimed: "Let us at
least pass a pleasant evening."</p>

<p>They seated themselves at the table. The musician soon found
his guest very much to his taste; he liked his grace and energy,
his vigour and his youth; he admired that long, smooth face,
those intensely black brows, the clearly outlined mouth with the
full lower lip, he was childishly pleased by the soiled
splendours of the brilliant uniform covered by braid and
tassels.</p>

<p>He was himself a fine young man, frank and lively, much
neglected in his person and living entirely in the phantasmagoria
he created for himself out of his art. Of the great world in
which the other had lived since his cradle, he knew nothing. Even
the vast war was to him only a hideous stupid nightmare. He did
not know what had become of his patron. He spoke German very
well, but now and then, as he drank more and more, broke into a
Venetian <i>patois</i> unintelligible to his companion.</p>

<p>They got on very well together; Jacopo did most of the
talking. With naive candour he related his love affairs, his
triumphs with Operas and Masses, the difficulty of securing
appreciation for excellent work&mdash;the disgusting jealousy of
puny rivals&mdash;his luck at finding this retreat away from all
the vile stupidities of the world.</p>

<p>The soldier sympathised. He was himself a musical amateur. He
played the flute.</p>

<p>As he listened to the frank boastings of the musician that
were full of inspiration and nobility he felt his own tragedy
sink into the background of his mind.</p>

<p>The untidy room, his loquacious companion, the dark night
beyond the terrace were alone real; the ghastly scenes of
yesterday, the results of his blunders, his obstinacy, became
like a drop cloth in a theatre. He ate little and drinking on top
of his fatigue and bruises, his mind became at once exhilarated
and clouded.</p>

<p>He knew, however, through all this curious hallucination of
peace and hope, that with the dawn would come another tale.</p>

<p>Excited by his own talk and the grace and sympathy of his
companion, Jacopo went to the clavecin and played over the
opening of his <i>Elegy.</i></p>

<p>"I believe I could finish it now."</p>

<p>"Pray do not allow me to disarrange you. I shall sit very
quietly here."</p>

<p>The musician grinned good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"It is strange how often I have been interrupted! Yesterday
those fellows broke into the garden and sent every idea out of my
head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What fellows?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they were soldiers. Confounded devils! They kicked up a
fine noise. I soon put them to flight. Cannot you understand that
I came here for quiet?" I cried, and as they still refused to go
away, I fired out of the window. I hit two of them. That silenced
them. They went away&mdash;quick enough.</p>

<p>Instantly alert the General demanded:</p>

<p>"Who were they? What did they want?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"What was their uniform?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they had scarlet and yellow fools' caps and little
bells&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hanoverian!" exclaimed the other. "The enemy&mdash;how was it
you were so stupid as to fire on them?"</p>

<p>"Because they were making such a row just when I was in the
midst of my <i>Elegy</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have acted like an imbecile. A civilian firing on a
soldier signs his own death warrant."</p>

<p>Jacopo, surprised at the energy of this statement, swung round
on his stool.</p>

<p>"But they went away!"</p>

<p>"They thought, of course, that some of our men were concealed
here. They will return&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, they shouted out something about returning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;with reinforcements. They will burn the house about
your ears and shoot you and your servant. While we have been
idling over our supper with open windows, they, no doubt, are on
their way&mdash;very likely they would wait till dark."</p>

<p>"Bah! Why should they trouble about me? No doubt something
has, by now, occurred to distract them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied the other dryly. "But if you wish to finish
your <i>Elegy</i> I should advise you to begin at once."</p>

<p>"That is all very well, but you have contrived to distract my
thoughts with your infernal suggestion of those rogues
returning&mdash;"</p>

<p>The General laughed, rose and looked out of the window; the
dark night was peaceful, silent; perhaps by some chance of war
this fool might escape the consequences of his folly. He was to
the soldier a new type, eccentric, half crazy, totally absorbed
in his own emotions, his own music, which did not matter to
anyone, but full of a fierce attractive energy.</p>

<p>"He has not done the harm that I have," thought the fugitive
thinking of the hundreds of dead on yesterday's battlefield. "He
has made me forget what I must do. If the house should be
attacked would that not be a good way out of it all?"</p>

<p>Straining his ears he fancied that he heard sinister noises
without. Instantly he closed and shuttered the windows.</p>

<p>"Who is with you besides your servant?"</p>

<p>"No one!" roared the musician from the clavecin. "Cannot you
let me be in peace?"</p>

<p>The General left the room; behind him sounded the repetition
of a mournful melody. He shouted up the corporal, the servant,
from the kitchen.</p>

<p>They came at once and he ordered them into the room opposite
that where he had supped, and himself lit a few candles. This
apartment was in wretched disorder; a packet of love letters
savagely torn across was flung down beside a bouquet of dead
flowers thrust into a vase of Persian porcelain.</p>

<p>The General threw some carnival clothes off a sofa and
demanded from Hermann the story of the attack on the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Both this fellow and the Pomeranian had been drinking heavily.
The noble patron of the musician had by no means intended to give
his <i>protégé</i> the keys of his cellars; but Hermann,
exasperated by boredom and the vagaries of his master, hoping
besides that the owner of the villa had been killed in battle by
now, had broken into the wine vaults.</p>

<p>Fortified by drink the corporal had lost all his awkward
timidity; carrying his huge bulk proudly he eyed the General
without awe as a mere puny fellow whose life he had saved by his
own address and strength.</p>

<p>Hermann, taciturn and sullen, admitted to the firing&mdash;had
he not already boasted of it when the two of them had arrived at
the house?</p>

<p>Yes, the cursed rogues had threatened to return&mdash;yes,
there was an officer with them, his language had been very
violent. No, there was not much powder and shot in the house, nor
any means of defending it that he knew of&mdash;yes, he believed
two of the scoundrels had been hit, one at least, badly, he had
seen him being carried away. That was queer, too, for, as far as
he knew, the musician, who was undoubtedly mad, had never fired a
shot before.</p>

<p>"Beginner's luck," remarked the General; his spirits rose, he
saw a chance to fill the last hours of his life with movement,
action, excitement. He hoped that the enemy would return to
revenge themselves and quickly&mdash;no doubt they would proceed
cautiously, believing the place full of armed men...there might
be a pretty diversion of several hours.</p>

<p>When, however, he put before the other two his certainty of an
attack and his scheme of defence they both roundly declared their
intention of abandoning the place and taking to the open
country.</p>

<p>The extravagant plans of the General, intoxicated by despair,
desire of glory, grandeur and heroism, meant nothing to these
two; they decided to pillage the house and fly.</p>

<p>Weary, with his thoughts in frightful disarray, the other
remained silent, and took his head in his hands; then, with a
dreadful effort, recovered his empire over himself and rose.</p>

<p>"You will do as I order you. I speak to men not to dogs or
rats. If the house is attacked you will help me defend it."</p>

<p>He dominated them; encouraged by the thought of the well-
plenished cellar, they consented to remain; the General bade them
close all the doors and windows with lock and bolt and bring up
such weapons as the place afforded.</p>

<p>He then returned to the room where he had left his host; as he
paused outside the door he heard the most heavenly melodies
arising from the clavecin; he was moved, startled by such beauty
which accorded very well with his exalted mood.</p>

<p>"The fellow has talent. He would be a success in Vienna. Is it
possible that I shall never see Vienna again?"</p>

<p>He entered, half enchanted by the slow harmonies.</p>

<p>"I believe, Herr Jacopo, that the house is being
surrounded&mdash;they intend, no doubt, to surprise us&mdash;but
I am ready to receive them."</p>

<p>The musician's broad white hands came to rest on the keys.</p>

<p>"Why? What is it to you?" he asked impatiently.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the music he had heard, the young soldier leant
on the clavecin, eagerly bending forward.</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;I was in command yesterday. Do you understand? I
refused all advice and was horribly defeated. I fled. I must, in
face of this frightful disgrace, die, before I hear what is said
of me. I can tell by your music that you will comprehend this
attitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand very well. It is grand, it is noble!
But why not fall on your sword as the Romans did?"</p>

<p>"Times have changed. Heroic virtue, alas, is no longer the
fashion. One must not attract attention to oneself. I have
already made myself sufficiently ridiculous&mdash;thrust into a
carriage, jolted along a ravine, dragged out of a stupid accident
by a great boor of a Pomeranian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, no doubt you know your own affairs and the house is at
your disposal. I suppose I may finish my <i>Elegy</i> which I
think will be very noble?"</p>

<p>"I will do my best to assure that you are not disturbed. Will
you allow me to write the dedication of your <i>Elegy</i> which
is much to my taste?"</p>

<p>He took the pen from the music rest and wrote on the top of
the first sheet of music&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">
"By special Permission dedicated to His Imperial
Highness the Archduke Charles Ferdinand Leopold
Christian&mdash;Generalissimo of the Forces of His Caesarean
Majesty."</p>
<br>

<p>"Very well," replied the musician impatiently; he had
completely forgotten the name the young man had given him earlier
in the evening. "But who is this fellow? Could he get my Opera
<i>Amphion</i> performed at Vienna?"</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;he would have been honoured&mdash;but now he is
useless."</p>

<p>"Bah!" interrupted Jacopo furiously. "Why, then, do you
interrupt me to dedicate my beautiful <i>Elegy</i> to him? Is it
not enough that I must compose on this wretched, tinkling
instrument when I require a whole orchestra to express my
inspiration without being plagued by your impertinence?"</p>

<p>The soldier laughed; for him the moment had become relentless,
feverish; he listened at the closed windows and was sure he could
hear the furtive sounds of men creeping round the house; leaving
the musician to his work he returned to Hermann and the
Pomeranian who quietly awaited his orders.</p>

<p>To keep up their courage they had opened some more bottles of
wine; in an ironic humour Charles Ferdinand surveyed them.</p>

<p>"Two of us are crazy and two are drunk," he thought; "we
should make a fine conclusion to our affairs."</p>

<p>With professional and mechanical accuracy he began detailing
his plans for the defence of the house; the two men looked at
each other doubtfully; neither of them had heard anything; they
had cautiously loosened the shutter and peered out into the
night; it had seemed as quiet as dark.</p>

<p>When the General had gone upstairs, a taper in his hand, to
examine, he said, the upper rooms, the Pomeranian tapped his
forehead and winked at his companion.</p>

<p>"It is true that he must have had a bruise or two on the head.
No one is attacking the house."</p>

<p>"Therefore we can easily humour him," replied Hermann. "We are
comfortable enough here with two lunatics who do not interfere
with us at all."</p>

<p>And they continued to drink and exchange contemptuous opinions
about life. The impatient, interrupted, repeated melody of the
<i>Elegy,</i> unheard by them, broke in the passage without.</p>

<p>"What is <i>he</i> doing upstairs?" wondered the Pomeranian at
length.</p>

<p>"No doubt he thinks he can see, even in the dark, the enemies
surrounding us&mdash;leave him to his ideas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It seems a pity I dragged him out of the carriage. His defeat
has turned his head&mdash;what was that?" The big man shuddered,
for a voice that sounded unearthly, rang without.</p>

<p>Hermann opened the door and the two peered up the narrow
stairway which was lit by a high lamp set in a niche.</p>

<p>They drew back, silenced.</p>

<p>Charles Ferdinand was descending the stairs, his bare sword in
his hand, his uniform further disordered as if he had been in a
struggle, his shirt open on his bare bosom, his hair straggling
on his shoulders. He held his head high, as if he carried, and
looked up to, a flag.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said on seeing the two below, "the house is
completely surrounded&mdash;they are crowding on the javelins,
demi-lunes&mdash;they fill the covered ways&mdash;they are near
enough to throw bombs. We will, of course, die negligently,
fighting to the last&mdash;you understand my metaphor? The
Hanoverians, believing this an ambush, are cautiously advancing
to the attack&mdash;listen, what do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Rats and owls, as usual," replied Hermann, "and my poor
master at his music&mdash;"</p>

<p>Charles Ferdinand entered the room with the torn love letters,
the dead flowers, the empty bottles of wine and the guttering
candles; he flung down his sword and seized a handsome inlaid
fowling piece which lay among the weapons the two men had
carelessly collected and flung down.</p>

<p>"They approach this window! The rascals little know the prey
they will miss." Turning abruptly to the Pomeranian he added:
"This is a good opportunity to discover what they really thought
of me in the army&mdash;what did fellows like you used to say of
me?"</p>

<p>"That you were too young, my prince. And would never have had
your post but for your rank," grinned the drunken corporal. "That
you would be governed by your mistresses in your youth and your
priests in old age&mdash;and several other things not to be
repeated in good company&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, was there not one of you willing to die for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we were paid to do that. And we bore you no ill
will."</p>

<p>"And my plans, my orders, my marches and
countermarches&mdash;were these not thought to show as remarkable
a genius as that of Eugene or Marlborough?"</p>

<p>The Pomeranian laughed stupidly.</p>

<p>"We excused everything&mdash;knowing that there was madness in
your illustrious family, my prince."</p>

<p>"So one is judged by base fellows," smiled the General sadly;
then, with a sudden fury that startled them both, he flung open
the shutters and fired into the dark, muttering: "I may have been
defeated&mdash;I may have fled&mdash;but you shall never take me
alive&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inflamed by his fierce energy the two men caught up weapons
and pressed behind him; they thought that they could see
ferocious forms shaping out of the blackness of the clouded night
and sparks of fire twinkling in the garden, and with shouts of
defiance they also loaded and fired.</p>

<p>Exasperated beyond endurance by this fracas the musician broke
into the room, abusing them all heartily.</p>

<p>"Cannot you kill each other without all this
noise?"&mdash;seeing them crouching at the window, firing as fast
as they could reload, his mood changed to one of martial fury. He
began to yell outrageous taunts at the unseen enemy and in a
delirium of wrath looked about for a weapon; as he did so,
blundering in his anger, he knocked over one of the candles on to
the untidy pile of old love letters that immediately flared
up.</p>

<p>"Ah, that confounded Marietta was always a tiresome woman!" he
yelled, endeavouring to beat out the flames with his hands.</p>

<p>The young General looked round severely; his aristocratic face
was flushed.</p>

<p>"This is not a <i>burla</i> or an <i>operetta</i> at Venice,"
he said. "Extinguish that fire at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are some barrels of water in the cellars," added
Hermann who was absorbed in tracing the progress of a gigantic
grenadier in yellow and red who was creeping under the dense
laurel bushes; to all three defenders of the lonely house the
midnight dark palpitated with monstrous foes; air and earth
belched enemies.</p>

<p>Behind them the flames, catching the dry damask, the crisp
silk of the sofa, sprang clear and high.</p>

<p>The musician ran to the cellar, stumbling, cursing in the half
dark smeared by the dubious rays of a wall lamp; the rhythms of
his <i>Elegy</i> ran in his head; these hideous interruptions
appeared to him like so many demons sent to plague him; he had no
longer any sense of reality&mdash;he wished for peace, for
silence only. Pausing on the cellar steps he beat the air with
grandiose gestures as if he conducted a vast orchestra of
rebellious angels.</p>

<p>As he fell half over a barrel he was reminded of his
detestable errand; with a cry of rage he seized the cask and ran
upstairs&mdash;"<i>tempo di marcia&mdash;presto</i>&mdash;why
should it not end like that?"</p>

<p>When he returned to the room it was half enveloped in flames;
indifferent to this fierce illumination behind them, the three
men at the open window continued to fire; the orders of the young
General sounded sharply through the crackle of the muskets.</p>

<p>"Ah, the rascals, the scoundrels, the devils, they have dared
to come back!" shouted Jacopo, looking round for something with
which to smash in the cask. "Give them a lesson, my friends, give
them a lesson!"</p>

<p>"Master, the dead are already nearly as high as the balcony,"
grinned Hermann. "It is good to kill."</p>

<p>"But we shall be vanquished in the end," said the General,
leaning, exhausted from his own violent mood, against the window
frame, "and there is no priest to give us supreme
absolution&mdash;" In a terrible voice he added, making the sign
of the Cross:</p>

<p>"<i>&mdash;Vitae aeterne</i>. Amen."</p>

<p>Seizing a candelabrum of Florentine copper the young musician,
in a frenzy, stove in the barrel and hurled the contents that at
once gushed out, on to the already victorious flames.</p>

<p>It was not however water, but brandy, that he had cast on the
conflagration, and the alcohol, bursting into pure fire,
instantly enveloped the room and the four men in an apogee of
glory, light, colour, consuming heat, and ignited the powder
horns ready for their defence.</p>

<p>The house did not burn out until the pure melancholy of the
dawn which broke with pale serenity above the mountains beyond
the valley.</p>

<p>At that hour a vedette of Hanoverians passed by and gazed
curiously at the blackened walls of the mansion from which smoke
rose in slow puffs, issuing sullenly from empty windows.</p>

<p>"That is the house where that fellow shot at us the other
day," remarked the officer thoughtfully. "Evidently there was
some mystery about the place and I did well to withdraw."</p>

<p>Cautiously they examined the distant out-building. They found
nothing of interest, save two fine white carriage horses, well
worth taking away.</p>

<p>"If there was anyone here they have been consumed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there was a night attack?"</p>

<p>"Bah! Who would trouble themselves with this?&mdash;after
yesterday no need to concern ourselves with small matters! But we
ought really to have punished that idiot for his insolence in
firing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without enthusiasm the Hanoverians examined the garden; it was
too dangerous to enter the smouldering house.</p>

<p>The lieutenant perceived a fragment of half-burnt paper blown
against one of the scorched oleander bushes; on it was
written:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"By special Permission dedicated to His Imperial Highness the Archduke Charles Ferdinand&mdash;"</p>
<br>

<p>"Bah!" smiled the German complacently. "That is a little out
of date! Charles Ferdinand is the egregious young fool who was
beaten so completely yesterday&mdash;what a disaster for
him!"</p>

<p>"I wonder where he has hidden himself?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. He is no longer of importance."</p>

<p>Turning on his heel, the Hanoverian ground the little fragment
of the <i>Elegy</i> into the soft earth.</p>

<p>When the vedette had ridden away the silence was unbroken save
for the monotonous chirping of the birds in the swamp cedars. The
valley was full of luminous shadows, the mountain-tops, like
gigantic funeral pyres lit at the top, flamed with the first
fires of the day.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. CRAB-APPLE HARVEST</h2>

<p class="first">
THE old woman pushed her truck through the soldiers gathered
on the outskirts of the ruined village. Corded to the truck was a
large rudely-made box in the shape of a coffin. The soldiers were
amazed, for it was amusing that anyone should think of burying
their dead when corpses were as common in Silesia as hedgerow
berries. They began to gather round the rude bier, offering to
challenge, to interfere. The beldame was plainly glad to pause at
her task. She stopped, rested on the hand-cart and wiped with the
ragged ends of her tattered shawl the dirty sweat from her face.
She was greatly fatigued; had she not been as strong as a
draught-mare she would have been dead of starvation, plague or
fright, long since.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers jeered.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, <i>ma belle?</i> Where did you get the
coffin? Crazy hag, did you see the bonfire in the churchyard last
night after the bomb had made a hole? Plenty of coffins there,
<i>ma foi!</i> And fine yellow skulls inside. <i>Mon Dieu!</i>
they seemed glad of a little warmth by the way they grinned at
us."</p>

<p>Swinging his arms across his chest a cuirassier added through
blue lips: "You have a damned early winter in this infernal
country!"</p>

<p>The old woman had a little recovered her breath, only a slight
trembling of her strong jaw showed her age and her
exhaustion.</p>

<p>"It is my husband&mdash;my man&mdash;he is dead of famine; I
am taking him to the little cemetery which the nuns keep on the
hill. He used to work for them and they always promised to give
him a burying."</p>

<p>"How did you make the coffin?" asked a slim cornet. He was
young enough to be depressed by the devastated country, the
constant massacres. His fine eyes were inflamed by smoke and
wine, but his complexion, despite the rigors of military life,
was clear and smooth above his blue uniform.</p>

<p>"My husband was a carpenter, he made his own coffin when wood
was cheap."</p>

<p>The soldiers, yawning, heavy-headed, stared; there was
something monstrous about the old hag, so powerful, so gaunt,
with great worn hands, lean chaps rough with silver hairs, dried
saliva at the corners of her lips, and a glance direct, vigorous,
perhaps crazy.</p>

<p>"Very likely," suggested a sergeant, embittered by a shattered
hand roughly bandaged (even the victors lacked almost
everything), "the harridan has some concealed money or good stuff
in that box; I have heard of such dirty tricks, <i>vielle
folle!"</i></p>

<p>The cornet again languidly approached the hand-cart; he
sneered at the thought of any booty being left in Klatz; why, it
was a wonder that the old woman was alive herself. The loungers
grinned to see him retreat, for the loathsome odour of decay had
struck disgust into even his nostrils no longer sensitive.</p>

<p>"Parbleu, you have kept the carrion long enough, <i>ma
fille,</i>" he said, holding his nose.</p>

<p>"May His Holy Name be blessed," murmured the ancient creature.
"Had I not to get up strength in my old body to do all as it
should be done? It is not easy in these times."</p>

<p>"Get on!" shrugged the cornet.</p>

<p>As the old woman bent to her task he threw a late loosened
wild rose that he had been tormenting in his fingers on to the
massive deal box; the others thought he mocked, but his face
expressed only weariness; it was near the end of the campaign,
everything pleasant had long since been destroyed, all supplies
were wanting...When had anyone last tasted a glass of good wine,
or a plate of fresh meat? And a pretty, lively girl would have
been worth her weight in gold.</p>

<p>Along the road to Cracow by the side of the Vistula the old
woman trudged, pushing and pulling her burden.</p>

<p>The sky was milky blue, the clouds curdled into heavy flower-
like forms; half-rotted rushes bent in the flow of the river. The
old creature was nearing the end of her endurance. She was so
old, so ill-fed, and then the anxiety, eh, it was nearly too much
for a miserable ancient woman.</p>

<p>"Surely she would never reach the convent on the hill...Eh,
but she would; after all these weeks was she to fail now? And
getting away from those ruffians, too, that was luck...God must
be looking after a wretched old woman. May His Holy Name be
blessed!" She crossed herself.</p>

<p>But her body and limbs ached, a bitter fluid soured her mouth,
an acrid film dimmed her eyes, her heart beat heavily, with
reluctance, in a bosom which felt empty...She leant straining
against the hand-cart.</p>

<p>She proceeded with great pain along the road to Cracow. She
reached the small orchard below the cemetery, she looked up at
the lonely chapel of the convent (the soldiers had respected the
nuns, it was difficult to know why), and she thought: "I cannot
go any further."</p>

<p>Her rough hands untied the knotted cords of the rude coffin on
the truck, and slowly she lifted the lid after glancing round
furtively, and a sprightly young girl, white and plump as a pet
rabbit, sat up; she held a cloth soaked in vinegar to her dainty
nostrils to deaden the smell of the dead rats at her feet. She
got out stiffly and yawned. The fresh air was delicious. Ever
since the soldiers had entered Klatz she had lived in a cupboard,
hidden from greedy and covetous eyes, fed on tit-bits, it is
true, but still in a cupboard.</p>

<p>The old woman cast away the rats and sank down on her
haunches, gazing at her granddaughter with looks of pride, with
the timidity of love.</p>

<p>"Listen, my Lisbeth, I have saved you, God be praised; the
soldiers do not know you exist, but I can do no more, I am very
tired&mdash;no one can see us here for the bend in the
road&mdash;Now you must run quickly up to the convent, my
darling."</p>

<p>The girl gazed about her. It was an exquisite evening, pure,
cold, azure; in all the landscape only the convent was dark,
sombre.</p>

<p>The old woman's senses began to fail, she had spent her last
forces in pushing her heavy burden.</p>

<p>"Run quickly, my love, my dear, you will be safe with the holy
sisters. Kiss me good-bye, Lisbeth...God be praised I have saved
you from the soldiers and their desires!"</p>

<p>The girl glanced at the old woman, no need to kiss her since
she was already dead...How ugly she was, sprawling in the frost-
bitten grass! Lisbeth fingered her own soft unblemished bosom and
eyed the convent on the hill. She was hungry, she greedily
snatched up a fallen apple and lustfully set her little pointed
teeth in it. A crab apple! She pitched it away with disgust; as
if her mouth were not already twisted with the vinegar! The
disappointment confirmed her decision; everything was so dull and
quiet, the convent so morosely silent, her grandame so repulsive
in her sudden twisted death&mdash;and the orchard was of crab
apples! She picked up from the truck the overblown rose, licked
her red lips slyly and turned back along the Cracow road in
search of the fine young cornet whom she had observed through the
joints of the roughly-made coffin.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. MINION OF THE MOON</h2>

<p class="first">
GIAN FRANCESCO leant against the great Horse in Venice, which,
save for the slim green chargers against the rich blue of the San
Marco portico, is the only beast of its kind in the streetless
city.</p>

<p>Close beside him was Filipo, who regarded him with a watchful
air; they both, in fine dark cloaks and slouch hats, looked very
much the same, but Gian Francesco was a very important personage
indeed and Filipo was only his valet.</p>

<p>It was a June night and the air was melancholy with the
haunted song of the caged nightingales who mourned unseen from
the dark fronts of the palaces.</p>

<p>Gian Francesco was well used to the splendid and the lovely
but very sensitive to their appeal, and he leant against the
statue in indolent enjoyment of the passionate night, so soft, so
dark, so sparkling with stars, so permeated with music, so
deliciously full of the possibility of adventure.</p>

<p>He was a well-made man who wore his simple attire with a
rather exaggerated grace; he was, at most, five and twenty.</p>

<p>It has been said that it was June in Venice and that the
nightingales were singing pressed against the gilt wires of their
cages, so perhaps the nature of his musings may be better
imagined than described.</p>

<p>But Filipo, the valet, was an older man, also one with no such
leisure for dreams, and one whose credit and livelihood depended
on his care of Gian Francesco.</p>

<p>Therefore he looked with disfavour on these public musings,
and suggested, with due humility, a return to the discreet
chambers in Il Capello Nero where Gian Francesco lodged his
incognito grandeur.</p>

<p>Gian Francesco reminded him:</p>

<p>"Did I not come here to taste some such hours as these? What
poetry is there in sitting in an inn parlour that breathes garlic
and wood smoke?"</p>

<p>"Discretion," murmured Filipo, "craves some consideration. You
are here surrounded by enemies who may at any moment penetrate
your disguise with sharp eyes and your body with sharp
swords."</p>

<p>"It is beneath me," replied the other in the grand manner in
which he had been so carefully trained, "to consider such things.
Besides," he added, on a more human note, "I do not think that
even if my identity were discovered any violence would be offered
to my person."</p>

<p>"I would not trust the Venetians," said Filipo anxiously. "And
consider the bad terms the Republic is on with
Tuscany&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fie," interrupted his master, "introducing politics on such a
night as this!"</p>

<p>"I hope, Serenity, that something worse does not introduce
itself."</p>

<p>"Could there be anything worse? I doubt it," replied Gian
Francesco lazily.</p>

<p>"Surely," said the valet, still all anxiety, "it is near the
hour of the rendezvous?"</p>

<p>"You think that to scale into one of these palaces is safer
than meditating here?" asked his master. "It is certainly not
time yet&mdash;the lady particularly warned me not to be too
soon&mdash;when the clock strikes&mdash;"</p>

<p>This sentence was never completed, for, most unfortunately,
the valet absorbed in his trepidation and the master in his
romantic dreaming had both failed to notice four figures that had
crept from the purple shadows in front of the palaces, slipped
across the tiny piazzetta and concealed themselves behind the
huge plinth that supported Il Cavallo, and as Gian Francesco was
dwelling languidly on his amorous expectations he was most
dexterously seized from behind, his arms nipped together, a cloth
flung over his head and drawn tightly round his throat.</p>

<p>Two of the men had served for this turn and the other two had
similarly disposed of Filipo.</p>

<p>The master's sword and the valet's pistol rang together on the
pavement as they were neatly disarmed.</p>

<p>Two lengths of fine whipcord served to bind their arms and
feet, and thus muffled and helpless they were borne swiftly to a
gondola that waited by the edge of the piazzetta and disposed
carefully in the <i>felzi;</i> the gondolier shot the boat with
the four men and their two victims out into the sombre
<i>rio,</i> and the monstrous horse and ferocious rider pranced
and stared immobile over the deserted piazzetta, lit by a moon
glow that began to slowly illuminate the sky as the crescent rose
above the Lido.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Gian Francesco felt himself being carried upstairs; from the
first he had not struggled, feeling it both useless and
undignified, and he had been, besides, very gently handled.</p>

<p>The cloth had been loosened so that he could breathe, and it
would have been possible for him to have shouted as the gondola
sped along the dark canals, but it had not needed the gleam of a
stiletto in one of his companion's hands to keep him silent.</p>

<p>The fear of the scandal of being found in such a position was
sufficient for that; he still ventured to hope that his identity
was unknown and that he might get out of this adventure without
revealing it, and he strove, though agitated by wrath, shame, and
apprehension, to maintain (even against such odds) the dignity
and tranquillity of his demeanour.</p>

<p>Finally he was released, the bonds and cloth removed, and he
himself placed on his feet.</p>

<p>He looked about him with more eagerness than he often
displayed, or, indeed, felt.</p>

<p>He was in a small, gloomy room that appeared to be usually
uninhabited; the one window had a heavy double grille, the one
door was bolted; there were five chairs, a table on which stood a
lantern, and nothing else.</p>

<p>His four captors stood in front of Gian Francesco. They were
(as he had known they would be) masked, and in the Venetian
fashion, with lace fall and cloak over the head, so that it was
impossible to distinguish a single trait in any one of them.</p>

<p>Gian Francesco shook out his disordered clothes; his powdered
locks were tumbled, his cravat twisted. The four bowed and
afforded him leisure in which to adjust his toilet, by which he
perceived that he had at least fallen into the hands of
gentlemen.</p>

<p>As his plain cloak had been removed with his bonds it now
became obvious that Gian Francesco was in something of gala
array.</p>

<p>His peach-coloured silk, finely embroidered with silver
threads, his waistcoat, richly flowered and blazing with diamond
buttons, his long cravat and wrist ruffles of Mechlin lace, his
scarlet heels and paste buckles all proclaimed that he was no
ordinary man on no ordinary errand.</p>

<p>The four masks glanced at each other, and one remarked in
Venetian dialect:</p>

<p>"It is quite likely to be true&mdash;for he is certainly very
attractive&mdash;a minion of the moon, up to any mischief."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco, having now recovered his complete composure,
seated himself; he also glanced round for his hat and would have
put it on&mdash;but it had been lost in the scuffle.</p>

<p>These habits were stronger than his sincere desire to preserve
his incognito.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," he said grandly, "for your explanation."</p>

<p>"It is most simple," replied one of the masks. "When the Grand
Duke of Tuscany comes in disguise to Venice&mdash;he must expect
the Serene Republic to take advantage of the fact."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco blushed.</p>

<p>"How on earth did you know me?" he demanded testily.</p>

<p>"It is the business of the Serene Republic to find out
everything that happens within her territory."</p>

<p>"But my passport was so skilfully faked," complained Gian
Francesco, "I have been so extremely careful."</p>

<p>"So," observed the mask, "have we."</p>

<p>"And now," asked another, "I suppose Your Serenity will not
deny that you are the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Archduke of
Austria&mdash;and a few other titles besides?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gian Francesco haughtily, "I will not deny it."</p>

<p>"Good. Then we have only to proceed to our business, which is
very quickly dispatched. First I must inform you that we are
representatives of the Senate and Republic of Venice and
empowered to perform justice in her name."</p>

<p>The Grand Duke did not like the sound of that word
"justice."</p>

<p>"I am not in Venice for any political ends," he remarked. "One
understands. Unfortunately, Highness, our business is politics,
always."</p>

<p>"How does that concern me?" asked the victim, with more
<i>insouciance</i> than he felt.</p>

<p>"Your Highness is the enemy of the republic, you influence
both Tuscany and the empire against us&mdash;our special delegate
sent to you recently was most coldly received."</p>

<p>"And would be again. I found his demands both insolent and
provocative&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I entreat Your Highness not to flourish so much. Let us leave
personalities and come directly to the matter in hand. Can Your
Highness give us any reason for coming to Venice in
disguise?"</p>

<p>His Serenity remained obstinately silent.</p>

<p>Another of the masks took up the conversation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there was not one reason, but four."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco blushed again; it was a tiresome habit that not
even his most rigid training had been able to cure.</p>

<p>"When that envoy came from Venice to Florence," continued the
other, "he took with him his wife, and she, the noble Costanza di
Bertoli, had in her train four ladies, to whom Your Highness was
observed to pay great attention&mdash;is it possible that your
secret visit to Venice&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Since your concern is with politics," returned Gian Francesco
coolly, "why drag in anything else?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. Your Highness has admirable business capacity. We
will drag in nothing else. We have then, signor, only to inform
you that the Senate, sitting to-day in secret conclave,
unanimously decreed your death, and we are here to put that
resolve into execution."</p>

<p>"I see," said Gian Francesco, who had, during this speech,
become rather pale. "And have you reflected on the consequences
of this murder?"</p>

<p>"We have reflected on how to avoid them."</p>

<p>"You cannot avoid them. You will bring not only Tuscany but
the empire about your ears. Venice will be blown into her own
marshes by the fury of the wrath of my family and people."</p>

<p>"That might be," replied the mask, "if anyone knew of the fate
of Your Highness, but no one will."</p>

<p>"No one will?" The Grand Duke felt distinctly chilled.
"Precisely. You will simply disappear. Your body will be disposed
of in one of the secret prisons under the Ducal Palazzo and there
will be not the slightest clue to the whereabouts of your
bones."</p>

<p>"But it will be known that I disappeared in Venice."</p>

<p>"Will it? Did Your Highness tell anyone that you were coming
to Venice? I think not, for everyone would have condemned such an
escapade. No, you are supposed to be hunting in the Pratolino and
when you are missed Venice will be the last place where anyone
will look for you, Serenity."</p>

<p>"You seem marvellously well informed," remarked Gian Francesco
grimly.</p>

<p>The mask bowed.</p>

<p>"Your Highness has half an hour. You may see a priest if you
will."</p>

<p>"Where is my valet?" demanded the Grand Duke. If Filipo had
escaped he might have been able to summon help from the
Florentine envoy or the Austrian Embassy.</p>

<p>The answer dispelled these faint hopes.</p>

<p>"The fellow is neatly trussed up below; when Your Serenity is
safely in Heaven you will find him waiting for you&mdash;God
forbid that we should send a man of quality on so long a journey
without a body servant."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco sat thoughtfully gazing into the lantern; he
had always been taught that prudence is the chief virtue for a
prince and he knew that there was no one to blame but himself for
his present predicament, which was foolish as well as fatal.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said at length. "Words are wasted when one is
dealing with assassins&mdash;send along your priest."</p>

<p>"We are willing to grant you one other favour," said the
spokesman of the masks, "and that is permission to write a
farewell letter&mdash;provided there is nothing political, but a
letter to some person you hold dear&mdash;the person perhaps for
whose sake you are in Venice."</p>

<p>"You are trying to find out who it is knows I am in Venice,"
replied the Grand Duke. "Of course I shall write no such
letter."</p>

<p>"Indeed you are wrong," the mask assured him. "Whoever the
lady is who knows you are in Venice, she will be quiet about it
for obvious reasons. All the four ladies who went to Tuscany have
extremely jealous husbands."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco saw the reason of this; it was certainly not
likely that the lady would make any disclosures of her
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested another of the masks, "you were about to
go to an appointment when we interrupted you&mdash;it would be
only gallant to explain your failure to keep so important a
rendezvous."</p>

<p>Gian Francesco rose.</p>

<p>"Will you swear, as gentlemen, that this letter will not be
used for any political purpose?"</p>

<p>They all swore with what seemed to him unmistakable
sincerity.</p>

<p>One produced writing materials from his pocket and Gian
Francesco sat down by the lantern light to write his letter.</p>

<p>"Naturally," they warned him, "you will make no allusion to
the manner of your fate."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the Grand Duke dryly.</p>

<p>Without more ado he began to write:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Beloved Lady,<br> <br> The only thing that
could have occurred to keep me from you to-night has occurred. I
must leave you to conjecture what that is.<br> <br> This letter
is, alas! not only an apology, but a farewell. Do not expect to
see me more, and believe that in bidding farewell to you I have
bidden farewell to all that is life.</p>

<br>

<p>The Grand Duke, who was rather sentimental, felt a certain
pleasure in writing this. He signed with a flourish:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Yours far beyond the slight incident that now
divides us,<br> <br> Gian Francesco.</p>
<br>

<p>He gazed a little pensively at the signature; it occurred to
him that this was the last time that he would sign his august
name.</p>

<p>A pity!</p>

<p>The masks took the paper and each read it with approval.</p>

<p>"Discreet certainly," the leader conceded. "Now, to whom are
we to deliver this farewell?"</p>

<p>The Grand Duke looked at them thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"It is clearly impossible for me to give you the name of the
lady."</p>

<p>"It is clearly impossible for us to deliver the message
without it."</p>

<p>"Not at all. At midnight&mdash;in a little inn towards
Chioggia, which is always full of sailors and onions&mdash;will
appear a small, dwarfish black woman&mdash;give her the letter
saying that it is from Gian Francesco, and she will know where to
deliver it."</p>

<p>"She is your usual messenger?"</p>

<p>"Precisely&mdash;but it will be no use to ask her the name of
the lady for she does not know it herself:"</p>

<p>"We do not," said the mask gallantly, "wish to pry into the
secrets of Your Highness&mdash;the letter shall be delivered.
What is the name of the inn?"</p>

<p>Gian Francesco answered:</p>

<p>"La Corona del Piombo."</p>

<p>The masks all bowed again.</p>

<p>"We will now leave you to your meditations&mdash;the priest
will shortly be with you."</p>

<p>They left him, taking the lantern with them, and Gian
Francesco, alone in the dark, heard the bolting of the door.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The four masks, for political agents, showed a vast interest
in the farewell letter written by their victim.</p>

<p>Leaving him secured in the attic and the valet secured in the
cellar, they proceeded, not to fetch a priest or an executioner,
but direct to the little inn near Chioggia full of sailors and
onions, and known by the name of La Corona del Piombo.</p>

<p>By the time that they reached this queer resort it was
midnight, but there was no negress among the medley of people
drinking thin wine, eating cheese and rye bread, or sleeping on
the long benches.</p>

<p>The masks had now removed their disguise and appeared as four
ordinary Venetian gentlemen, therefore their appearance caused no
comment though they lingered on well into the night, idling over
the soiled tables and eyeing the door.</p>

<p>"We have been fooled," they decided at length, "or some
accident or suspicion has overtaken the messenger."</p>

<p>They looked at one another and considered if they should
return to Gian Francesco and endeavour to wring from him the name
of the lady.</p>

<p>They decided, however, that this would be useless and also
that that part of the jest had gone far enough.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>These four masks were, as you may have perceived, the four
husbands of the ladies who had come to Florence in the train of
the noble Lady Costanza di Bertoli, and no agents of the Serene
Republic; and their sole object had been to discover which of the
ladies the Grand Duke was pursuing&mdash;or being pursued
by&mdash;and on their spies informing them of the presence of His
Highness in Venice they had concocted this plan for coming at the
truth.</p>

<p>One had suggested that it would have been more simple to have
shadowed him to the scene of his assignation; but though you may
catch even a wary man with sudden violence in Venice it is next
to impossible to shadow <i>even</i> an unwary one, by reason of
the quick waterways and dark canals; and the four ladies were as
subtle as they were fair.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for them to long keep the Grand Duke
and his valet a prisoner without the trick being discovered, and
they meant to escort him across the frontier while he was still
under the impression that he was in the power of the
republic.</p>

<p>So, having no time to lose, the four husbands agreed on this
expedient.</p>

<p>They took the letter to a scribe they knew, knocked him up and
obliged him to make three fair copies of the letter; then, each
with a farewell in his pocket, they proceeded home. They
considered that the matter would soon be settled, as it would be
impossible for the guilty lady to disguise her knowledge of the
letter and the writer.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The noble Lady Orsola Schiavoni was yawning in a pink chemise,
stretched on a little bed of ivory, when her husband entered the
room.</p>

<p>Her dense black hair was plaited with thousands of little
pearls and hundreds of little braids of silver; she blew her
husband a kiss and sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"I have," said he, "a letter for you."</p>

<p>"From my mother?" asked she sweetly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"From my brother or sister?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It is a riddle! How delightful!"</p>

<p>"It is from a gallant."</p>

<p>"Then it is not for me," she smiled. "Am I not the only lady
in Venice without a gallant?"</p>

<p>"So I always believed," he returned. "Still, this letter! It
is from one called Gian Francesco and seems to be a farewell,
written when on the point of death."</p>

<p>He waited for this thunderbolt to take effect, but the noble
Lady Orsola gazed at him with candid eyes and her colour neither
rose nor fell.</p>

<p>"Poor soul," she said, "it must be for one of my women. Where
did you find it?"</p>

<p>He gave her the letter, which she looked at with languid
curiosity.</p>

<p>"I intercepted a messenger," he said, "a dwarfish
negress&mdash;who waits in an inn near Chioggia, full of onions
and and sailors."</p>

<p>Orsola yawned and handed him back the letter.</p>

<p>"What a queer story," she remarked. "I am really too sleepy to
try to understand it all&mdash;"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The noble Lady Mafalda Capello was an early riser; when her
husband reached home she was already on the roof with her fair
hair drawn through a crownless hat and spread on the brim that
the morning sun (the only one now supportable) might bleach the
thick locks.</p>

<p>Her lord had a different method with his copy of the
letter.</p>

<p>He gave it to her hairdresser who was busy with a mess of
camomile flowers.</p>

<p>"Present this," he said, "to your mistress, saying it was
given you by a dwarfish negress who fetched it from an inn near
Chioggia which is full of sailors and onions and goes by the name
of La Corona del Piombo, and give it her as I come forward with
my eyes on her."</p>

<p>With the letter he put a gold <i>bezant</i> into the hand of
the hairdresser, who was an adept at this kind of affair and did
not fail to carry out his instructions very well.</p>

<p>So the message was delivered to the noble Lady Mafalda just as
her husband had directed it should be, and the note put into her
hand just as he was turning back from the roof parapet towards
her. She read it without the least sign of motion, shrugged her
shoulders, and remarking: "Thou hast mistaken the direction, this
is for some other lady," handed it back to the hairdresser.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The third husband was even more cunning; he folded up the note
and flung it on the balcony of his wife's room where she always
went to feed her doves early in the morning.</p>

<p>And there Madonna Bonaventura found it lying on the pink
marble as she began to scatter the orange grain. While her
husband watched from behind a curtain.</p>

<p>The lady picked up the note, read it, and then, with an air of
indifferency, tore it into shreds and cast it into the canal.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And the fourth lady?</p>

<p>The letter she received happened to be the original
one&mdash;that which Gian Francesco had really penned when he
believed himself under sentence of death.</p>

<p>This lady was Carola Visdomini, sweet, idle, and luscious as a
summer day, and when her husband found her she was doing nothing
better than twist flowers into her auburn locks while she gazed
at herself in a mirror set in a shell.</p>

<p>Her husband dropped the letter into her lap.</p>

<p>"As the man is dying or dead," he said grimly, "I will deliver
you his message."</p>

<p>Her smile was most innocent, like that of a child listening to
a fairy tale, and when she had read the note it was sweeter and
more innocent still.</p>

<p>"Dear love," she murmured, "what is this subtle jest?" She
gave him back the note and returned to braiding flowers into her
hair.</p>

<p>The four husbands met at the appointed rendezvous; each was
pleased with himself and felt a secret pity for the others, for
each was convinced of the innocence of his own lady and sure of
the guilt of one of the wives of his companions.</p>

<p>And they related their experiences, one after the other, with
pride and delight in the virtue of each separate lady. And they
concluded with something the same words:</p>

<p>"Suspicious as I am, and cautious as you know me to be, I
certainly could not have been deceived&mdash;truth was in her
eyes, on her cheeks and brow, candour on her lips and innocence
in her smile!"</p>

<p>Only Prince Schiavoni, who was the most cynical minded,
asked:</p>

<p>"Then why did the Grand Duke risk his person in Venice?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps for some lady of whom we know nothing."</p>

<p>"Ah, perhaps." Prince Schiavoni smiled up his sleeve,
thinking: "One of you is a credulous fool to be twisted round a
woman's finger."</p>

<p>And each of the others thought:</p>

<p>"Strange that Schiavoni should be so easily gulled&mdash;it
must have been his Orsola."</p>

<p>While they were thus congratulating themselves on the success
of their plot they remembered suddenly Gian Francesco.</p>

<p>The poor devil must be still in expectation of death and
sorely in need of food and drink, and the conspirators who had
been so absorbed in their own domestic affairs as to forget their
prisoner, glanced at each other with some consternation.</p>

<p>After all, it was the person of the Grand Duke of Tuscany they
dealt with and their lives and estates might answer for it if
their stratagem was discovered.</p>

<p>It was clearly impossible to smuggle His Serenity across the
frontier until dark, therefore he must be kept a prisoner until
nightfall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they might (now none of them had a special grievance
against him) put him out of his fear of death, give him
refreshments and repose.</p>

<p>They decided to tell him that the Serene Republic had been
graciously pleased to spare his life on condition he allowed
himself to be put over the frontier and swore never to return to
Venice save in an official capacity.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan the four, severally, and as it
appeared, casually, gathered in the dark little piazzetta where
stood the house where the Grand Duke was confined; there they
slipped their masks out of their pockets, threw their cloaks
about their persons and proceeded to enter the dismal-looking
dwelling that sheltered the unfortunate Grand Duke.</p>

<p>What was the consternation upon discovering that the door,
which they had left so carefully locked and bolted was open and
had swung ajar!</p>

<p>They crowded into the narrow passage and nearly fell over the
body of their guard and watch which was lying prone, gagged and
bound on the stained&mdash;yes, blood-stained&mdash;black and
white flags.</p>

<p>They dragged him into a sitting posture, took off his bonds
and gag, and were selfishly relieved to find that, though
seriously wounded, he was conscious and still had breath enough,
to speak.</p>

<p>"The prisoners!" they demanded. "The prisoners!"</p>

<p>"Both released," gasped the man, "and by the foul fiend, as I
do think!"</p>

<p>One rushed upstairs to see if this was true&mdash;and sure
enough he found the room empty where they had left Gian
Francesco&mdash;another dashed into the basement and found that
the valet had followed the master.</p>

<p>All four stood close to hear the tale of the wretched watch
who had now the cut on his head hastily bound up and had been
given a drink of the wine they had brought for Gian
Francesco.</p>

<p>The poor man's tale was short.</p>

<p>"The door was burst open, by the powers of Hell, for all I
know. I was knocked on the head and disarmed; one held me down
while the others rushed upstairs, and bound and gagged me, as you
found me. I saw them go past again with the prisoners&mdash;the
one from the attic and the one from the cellar."</p>

<p>"Who were these people?" cried Prince Schiavoni bitterly.</p>

<p>"Four bravos, in masks, of course, signor, and a diabolical,
dwarfish negress leading them."</p>

<p>"A dwarfish negress!"</p>

<p>"No higher than my waist, with a face to rebuke sin, and
peacocked out in orange brocade under her mantle." There was
silence.</p>

<p>Each of the four husbands debated a curious thought. At length
one spoke, voicing the general feeling: "At what hour did this
occur?"</p>

<p>"Soon after Your Excellencies left me," groaned the man,
nursing his head. "A good half-hour could not have passed before
the door was thrust in."</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Then, while we were waiting in that wine shop at Chioggia,
Gian Francesco was free to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do what he pleased," finished another.</p>

<p>"Visit any lady he desired to visit," added a third. And the
fourth added:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that we have been properly fooled."</p>

<p>"Yes, but by whom?"</p>

<p>It was indeed difficult to tell. Many theories at once
presented themselves, and one thing at least was clear. They had
been watched when they arrested their men (probably by the
diabolical negress) and shadowed in a gondola to their
destination, the house being marked, help had been summoned.</p>

<p>Gian Francesco's safety was guarded either by his own prudence
or by that of someone else. Had he fooled them when he sent them
to watch for the negress? Had he known of his own approaching
rescue?&mdash;or was it all the work of the lady with whom he had
the appointment?</p>

<p>Had the negress, the go-between, been spying on the Grand Duke
to watch over his safety? or was she herself in the employ of
that Prince?</p>

<p>And what of the bravos?</p>

<p>Who had employed them?</p>

<p>And how had Gian Francesco employed his time while the four
husbands were waiting in the inn at Chioggia? All the night
before him&mdash;and all the ways clear.</p>

<p>How easy for the guilty lady to have aped innocence if she had
already heard the whole story from Gian Francesco a few hours
previously...</p>

<p>The four husbands gazed grimly at each other.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Late, late the next night, as the dawn light was beginning to
drown the stars in a vapour of pearly light, Gian Francesco and
Filipo his valet rode safely over the Venetian frontier. Gian
Francesco was singing gaily and there were four red roses in his
cravat. Filipo looked relieved to be across the frontier, yet not
wholly dissatisfied with his past adventures.</p>

<p>Neither the Chronicles of Venice nor those of Tuscany mention
the manner in which His Serene Highness spent the hours after his
release from his imprisonment, where he was hiding the following
day, nor to whom he bade farewell that night before he rode
across the frontier.</p>

<p>It is equally obscure who employed the bravos who rescued him
and which of the ladies (if any) was lying.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be guessed&mdash;perhaps not.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Four farewells, four husbands, four bravos&mdash;four red
roses in Gian Francesco's cravat, Minion of the Moon, equal to
any mischief.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. HURRY! HURRY!</h2>

<p class="first">
EUGEN TÖLLONG offered money in vain; none of the boatmen would
row him across the lake; the ice was breaking and the dark water
choked by cracking floes.</p>

<p>He was desperate enough to risk an accident.</p>

<p>"A matter of life or death?" they asked.</p>

<p>Töllong smiled behind his high fur collar; quick riding
through the wind had flayed his cheeks a burning red; his eyes,
under the heavy cloth cap, showed a hard, bright blue that seemed
as unnaturally vivid as coloured glass.</p>

<p>"Certainly it is a matter of life and death&mdash;my motto,
since I began my journey, has been&mdash;hurry!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, if you go a little further up the lake,
where the ice is firmer, you can hire a sledge, and if you care
to drive it yourself; with your own horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong turned, waiting to hear no more, and rode along the
edge of the vast lake that stretched between him and the capital,
the objective of his swift journey; to have gone round by the
road would have meant a delay that he could not afford.</p>

<p>The landscape was bare as a bleached bone; even the distant
line of pines on the further shore appeared frozen in stark
immobility; ash-grey geese flew across a cold, pallid sky; in
subdued, menacing tumult the water strove against the ice; as he
hastened, Töllong heard this crack, saw, in the deep splits, the
dark, bitter wavelets.</p>

<p>He procured a sledge by paying the value of it in advance; the
people at the lonely post house were amazed at his lavishness, at
his recklessness.</p>

<p>"The ice will scarcely bear&mdash;this must be very important
business!"</p>

<p>"I have but one word in my ears and that is&mdash;'hurry!'"
replied Töllong; he reflected that he was making himself
conspicuous, that these inquisitive people would remember
him&mdash;afterwards.</p>

<p>But that would not matter; it was not as if he had reckoned on
escape; still it was a pity that the affair had been left so late
and that the spring had chanced so early this year.</p>

<p>He leaped into the sledge to which his stout, fresh horse had
been harnessed, placed his case, the only luggage he carried,
beside him, drew closely round his limbs the reindeer rugs and
started off across the ice which there lay smooth enough; now and
then he heard a crack beneath him which startled the horse, and
urged the frightened beast on as fiercely as if the wolves were
behind; as he neared the further shore he felt the heave of the
ice crust beneath him; it was breaking. Töllong stood up,
loosened the reins, yelled at the plunging horse, trying to guide
him to the block of ice ahead&mdash;the foreshore was so close,
failure seemed impossible, he could discern a wooden house at the
verge of the black wood, a man, a boat among the frozen
reeds.</p>

<p>Töllong's horse missed the ice floe, and plunged into the
lake, dragging the sledge after him; Töllong struggled in the
sharp cold water, was sucked under and lost his senses; the
hideous sensation of swimming in blackness gave way to one of
drowsy warmth; he felt something hot in his mouth and sat up
suddenly, spilling the liquid on his chest. "Hurry!" he muttered,
making an effort to rise; but he was held back and answered by a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;hurry, indeed. Fool's haste!&mdash;and fool's luck
too&mdash;you're all right."</p>

<p>Töllong lay quiet as his senses, his memories flowed back to
him; he was on a rough bed by a huge stove that warmed a plain
wooden room; before this his own clothes and those of another
were drying; on the top of it, coffee was heating and a pan of
food cooking; Töllong stretched and looked round for the man who
had spoken.</p>

<p>"You rescued me?" he asked, stupidly.</p>

<p>"Well, I had to pull you out of the lake&mdash;why did they
let you attempt the crossing?"</p>

<p>"I insisted&mdash;my business is very important."</p>

<p>Töllong sat up; he was covered in rugs and skins and wore a
shirt not his own; he felt foolish and vexed as he tried to
express to his rescuer some gratitude, some appreciation.</p>

<p>This young man was about his own age, of a fine physique; he
had changed into a linen shirt, that hung open carelessly on his
broad white chest, and blue cloth breeches; his wide, comely face
expressed great vitality and vivacity; he was obviously full of
gaiety and daring; his thick fair hair, roughly dried, hung on to
his shoulders, giving him an uncouth appearance; but for all
that, Töllong noted at once his elegance and distinction.</p>

<p>"You are not a farmer or a peasant," he said&mdash;"who are
you?"</p>

<p>The other answered this blunt question candidly.</p>

<p>"I am an officer in the garrison in Stockholm&mdash;and I came
out here for a little duck shooting. I love the winter
quiet."</p>

<p>"It was not for me to be questioning you," replied Töllong
awkwardly. "I am hardly in my right senses yet. Forgive
me&mdash;it was only that you are so different from the people
one expects to meet&mdash;no doubt you will be wondering about
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know one thing. You are a Smälander&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My accent betrays me?&mdash;yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong was uneasy; he remembered his case and what he had in
the pocket of the coat drying before the stove, also his need for
haste; then he recalled with pleasure that he <i>had</i> crossed
the lake; he would, after all, be in time.</p>

<p>"&mdash;as long as I am in the city by to-night," he
continued.</p>

<p>"That is easy&mdash;we are an hour's ride from the suburbs.
Your horse struggled ashore&mdash;like yourself he is none the
worse. The sledge is lost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My case?"</p>

<p>"I fear that has also gone."</p>

<p>Töllong was vexed; but the best place for his papers if they
must leave his own possession was the bottom of the lake; again
he tried to express his thanks, asked his rescuer's
name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gustaf Erikson. I suppose you would have done as much for
me." The genial young man seemed amused. "But it was lucky for
you I was there. Now you must share my dinner and we will go to
the town together. Your clothes will not be dry, but I can lend
you others&mdash;a servant keeps this place for me, I will send
him to you."</p>

<p>As his host left the room Töllong sprang to his furred
overcoat, steaming before the stove, and searched nervously in
the inner pocket&mdash;yes, there was his thick leather wallet
almost untouched by the water; on opening it quickly he found, to
his great relief, the horn badge of peculiar shape with "Hurry!"
cut on it in small letters, his money, and a handsomely engraved
ticket for the masquerade at the palace that evening.</p>

<p>His host returned.</p>

<p>"I hope you find your possessions all right?"</p>

<p>Töllong, taken by surprise, laughed awkwardly, vexed at being
caught searching in his coat.</p>

<p>"I was anxious, about my money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that, too, I suppose," added Captain Erikson pointing to
the large card embellished with flowers and cupidons that Töllong
held. "Forgive me, my friend, but admission to the royal
masquerade is not so easily procured&mdash;you must be a person
of some consequence!</p>

<p>"I owe it to the kindness of friends," replied Töllong. "Now
you understand my reasons for haste&mdash;to have gone by the
road would have meant missing the ball."</p>

<p>"Which is, however, really not worth risking one's life for,"
smiled Gustaf Erikson with his strong glance of vivid hazel eyes
turned on Töllong. "Though I admit that many of my fellow-
officers would have given a great deal&mdash;which they don't
possess&mdash;for a chance to go to such an exclusive
affair&mdash;at which the King himself will be present."</p>

<p>"Will he, indeed?" replied Töllong, carefully putting away the
wallet. "Then I am luckier than I thought."</p>

<p>Captain Erikson's servant entered and opened one of the large
pinewood cupboards that lined the wall opposite the stove; this
was full of a sufficient variety of garments to prove the soldier
to be wealthy and whimsical; for the place was lonely and
desolate indeed, yet the wooden house well equipped for a long
residence.</p>

<p>As Töllong dressed himself (the two men were much of a size)
his host asked him his name and where he should send his own
clothes when dry?</p>

<p>"My name is Olaf Brandt and I am staying at The Silver
Antlers&mdash;but I will not disoblige you any further&mdash;I
can send for the things to-morrow," he grinned, thinking that to-
morrow he would have little need of trifles.</p>

<p>The two men sat down to a meal that Kristian, the servant,
prepared and served; with his badge and ticket safe against his
heart Töllong felt at ease and even sanguine as to the success of
his mission; it was vexatious, of course, that he had roused the
curiosity of this amiable stranger who expressed a frank
amazement at the young provincial's wild journey to the capital
to attend the royal ball&mdash;</p>

<p>Töllong also affected to be frank.</p>

<p>"I am under such an obligation to you that it seems pleasure
that he <i>had</i> crossed the lake; he would, after all, be in
time.</p>

<p>"&mdash;as long as I am in the city by to-night," he
continued.</p>

<p>"That is easy&mdash;we are an hour's ride from the suburbs.
Your horse struggled ashore&mdash;like yourself he is none the
worse. The sledge is lost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My case?"</p>

<p>"I fear that has also gone."</p>

<p>Töllong was vexed; but the best place for his papers if they
must leave his own possession was the bottom of the lake; again
he tried to express his thanks, asked his rescuer's
name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gustaf Erikson. I suppose you would have done as much for
me." The genial young man seemed amused. "But it was lucky for
you I was there. Now you must share my dinner and we will go to
the town together. Your clothes will not be dry, but I can lend
you others&mdash;a servant keeps this place for me, I will send
him to you."</p>

<p>As his host left the room Töllong sprang to his furred
overcoat, steaming before the stove, and searched nervously in
the inner pocket&mdash;yes, there was his thick leather wallet
almost untouched by the water; on opening it quickly he found, to
his great relief, the horn badge of peculiar shape with "Hurry!"
cut on it in small letters, his money, and a handsomely engraved
ticket for the masquerade at the palace that evening.</p>

<p>His host returned.</p>

<p>"I hope you find your possessions all right?"</p>

<p>Töllong, taken by surprise, laughed awkwardly, vexed at being
caught searching in his coat.</p>

<p>"I was anxious, about my money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that, too, I suppose," added Captain Erikson pointing to
the large card embellished with flowers and cupidons that Töllong
held. "Forgive me, my friend, but churlish to keep
secrets&mdash;but the friend who has procured me this ticket has
done it at some risk&mdash;you understand? I must not mention his
name."</p>

<p>"A court official?"</p>

<p>Töllong nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, it wouldn't mean much to me! I don't move in those
circles&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong, feeling pressed, admitted:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the secret isn't mine&mdash;forgive me, my friend,
the affair is rather delicate!"</p>

<p>"A lady?"</p>

<p>"Precisely! You perceive that my lips are sealed&mdash;"</p>

<p>He smiled, knowing that the other thought he insinuated a hint
of a love affair, but there was no love in his errand and the
lady concerned was long past tenderness or gallantry. When
Töllong smiled he was agreeable to look at, for his teeth were
even and white and his too vivid blue eyes half closed in a
pleasant manner; his features were harsh, his cheek-bones high
and his hair rough and stiff, of the colour of burnt flax; he was
splendidly made and had an attractive air of health.</p>

<p>"You ought to be in the army," commented Captain Erikson,
probing, Töllong felt, for information.</p>

<p>"I would, maybe, under a different government&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, a revolutionary! A republican, what a number there are
about!"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;but one can't have much respect for the present
<i>régime&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"You blame the King, no doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you can't call him popular, even in the
army&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak freely before me," smiled Gustaf Erikson. "I agree with
you that the King is a sad fellow&mdash;as much abused in the
provinces as in the capital, no doubt."</p>

<p>But Töllong's frankness was nicely calculated, he refused to
be drawn further.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't thought much about it," he replied.</p>

<p>"I live too remote from politics, I've other things to think
of&mdash;I'm still a student at Uppsala for one thing and then I
help my father with the estates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you students are dangerous! It is you who write all these
wild pamphlets against God and the King&mdash;when you have not
as much as seen either&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I have never written a line in my life&mdash;and under
your favour, sir, I ought to be getting on."</p>

<p>"I'll swear," smiled the officer, rising, "you are a red-hot
'<i>sans culotte</i>' or Jacobin&mdash;full of advanced ideas and
eager to practise 'em!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Töllong, "surely a man of your age isn't
satisfied to dry rot in a garrison supporting all the old
traditions and conventions and amusing yourself duck shooting in
a place like this!"</p>

<p>"I divert myself one way and another, it isn't a bad life, I
assure you!" Gustaf Erikson laughed joyously as he slipped into
his heavy fur coat; there was something about him, an active
grace, a subtle distinction, that was very charming; his easy,
friendly manner and an air of generous nobility in his mien
tempted Töllong to confidences that he knew he must by no means
give. He delighted in the sense of speed given by the swift
sledge drive; the young officer had a pair of fine horses and
drove at a brisk pace along the level road; as they sped along he
talked with great vivacity, smiling over his shoulder above the
grey fur of his collar.</p>

<p>Tölling's accident, his brief unconsciousness, his meeting
with this charming stranger, had altered his mood; he put his
hand over the hidden badge and grinned with excitement; his blue
eyes shone with the heartless fervour of the fanatic and his
lips, stiff from the cold, formed the word&mdash;"hurry!"</p>

<p>Before he crossed the lake he had not paused to think; he had
been blindly intent on his errand, almost like an automaton.</p>

<p>Now his mission assumed a sharp importance, because at once
richly fantastic, with all the glamour of high adventure, and
intensely real, making commonplace incidents appear trivial and
intolerably futile.</p>

<p>His blood raced with a keen exhilaration as he saw the towers
of the city rise against the cold sky; he, Eügen Töllong,
unknown, obscure, with little hope, to the casual observer, of
ever being anything else, was entering the capital of his country
for the first time utterly unnoticed&mdash;but, to-morrow, ah,
to-morrow there would be no one in the whole of Sweden who had
not heard his name&mdash;</p>

<p>"You seem pleased, my friend," remarked Captain Erikson as
they drove through the suburbs. "It is true that it is a fine,
frosty day, and that you are going to the royal masquerade to-
night!"</p>

<p>"But you seem to think there must be a deeper cause for my
satisfaction!" smiled Töllong. "Well, I have told you that there
is a secret&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which I will not probe&mdash;perhaps to-morrow you would like
me to show you some of the sights of the city?"</p>

<p>Töllong echoed&mdash;"to-morrow!" then added quickly, "To-
morrow I shall have to return."</p>

<p>"So soon! You are indeed a mysterious person! This
evening&mdash;the masquerade does not begin till
midnight&mdash;come with me to a little cabaret first&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong reflected&mdash;"I shall have to pass the time
somehow&mdash;why not with this harmless fellow, who clearly has
not a thought beyond his pleasures?" And he agreed to meet the
young officer at The Silver Antlers at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"I have an appointment first, you understand!"</p>

<p>"Ah, with the fair dame, no doubt!"</p>

<p>Töllong nodded; he felt very friendly towards his rescuer
though warm feelings were contrary to his nature; but this man
had saved his life at risk of his own and at a most opportune
moment&mdash;if he, Töllong, had gone to the bottom of the lake,
how much more than his own life would have been lost!</p>

<p>They parted at the door of Töllong's inn; as the young officer
drove gaily away Töllong half regretted that he had made that
appointment with him for later in the evening; had he not been
warned to beware of all strangers?&mdash;"anyone, the most
unlikely person, might be a police or government agent in
disguise&mdash;"; but Töllong reassured himself&mdash;the
circumstances of his meeting with Gustaf Erikson had been so
peculiar&mdash;it would have been the oddest coincidence in the
world if he had been rescued by an emissary of the
government&mdash;besides, Erikson was so obviously what he said
he was, a careless young officer.</p>

<p>But&mdash;no time for reflection&mdash;hurry!</p>

<p>The city seemed very gay to him as he started out on his first
errand; the fashionable shops, the well-dressed crowds, the
tinkle of sledge bells, the darkening blue sky sparkling with
clear frost-bright stars all absurdly stimulated Eügen Töllong,
the studious provincial.</p>

<p>As he searched for the address he had so carefully committed
to memory he came upon a vast building that could be no other
than the palace; Töllong stopped dead to stare while passers-by
glanced with vexation at his large bulk and rustic obstruction of
the pavement.</p>

<p>The lamps of festival were already being hung in the windows
of the palace, the last light of day showed the evening wind
lifting the folds of the royal standard on the topmost
tower...Töllong felt himself part of great events. He found his
destination to be an old timber house in a quiet square; there
were gooseberry bushes in the patch of garden, he noticed the
tiny first leaves among the long thorns.</p>

<p>The door opened at once to his five carefully spaced knocks;
he showed his horn badge and was admitted by a fellow who might
have been any servant in any service.</p>

<p>Töllong followed him up the narrow stairs into a plain room
shuttered against the twilight. Three men, all strangers to
Töllong, sat round a deal table lit by a cheap lamp; one was
corpulent and slovenly in his person, one a dandy, gaunt and high
shouldered, the third elderly, withered and bowed; their faces
Töllong could not see, for they wore masks.</p>

<p>He stood before them, his badge in his hand; knowing that he
was being keenly scrutinised; with an effort at ease he said:</p>

<p>"You are the members of the Committee to whom I was to
report?"</p>

<p>"We are," replied the stout man. "And you are Eügen Töllong
whom we were to expect?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;is there any need for mystery, gentlemen? Surely I
have proved that I am to be trusted?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," answered the other dryly, "or you would not be
here. But why wish to burden yourself with the knowledge of our
identities? What you do not know you cannot reveal."</p>

<p>Without waiting for any possible comment he continued:</p>

<p>"We have examined your <i>dossier,</i> you seem in all
suitable. You have no regrets, fears or scruples?"</p>

<p>"None," Töllong declared vehemently. "When I was told that the
lot had fallen to me, I prepared to put myself absolutely at your
disposal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know what you risk?"</p>

<p>"Of course." Töllong's wrought-up fanaticism was scornful of
this prosy talk; the masks glanced at each other, approving his
resolute carriage; the oldest handed him a packet.</p>

<p>"Very well, no need for further talk when we all understand
each other perfectly. Here are your instructions, your costume
and domino will be delivered at your inn."</p>

<p>To this the stout man added:</p>

<p>"Madame wishes to see you first&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong bowed; the third man, who had not yet spoken, offered
him a glass of brandy which he drank&mdash;"to the health of our
enterprise ". The cold had been so intense on his journey that he
had not touched alcohol since he left home, the spirit therefore
sent his blood racing and made his mood even more buoyant; he
felt a hero and a martyr; his face, frostbitten on the nose arch
and cheek bones, set in an expression of cold ferocity, the
relentless grimace of the fanatic.</p>

<p>The three conspirators, looking at him, were satisfied with
the skilful jugglery that had made the name of Eügen Töllong
appear on the ticket drawn from so many others, the man was made
for his purpose&mdash;no need to fear that he would not carry it
through.</p>

<p>They questioned him about his journey&mdash;he had had a long
way to travel since he had received the message that his had been
the name drawn.</p>

<p>Töllong said nothing about that adventure at the lake; it now
seemed a rather ridiculous kind of miracle; he would not waste
time recounting such futilities&mdash;besides, he did not wish to
admit that his papers were at the bottom of the ice-bound
waters.</p>

<p>"At twelve o'clock someone will call for you," remarked the
most elegant of the masks; he rose, as if dismissing Töllong, but
added:</p>

<p>"One formality&mdash;you will take the customary oath that
nothing whatever will turn you from your purpose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Easily&mdash;what could turn me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, as we hope. Remember, <i>nothing,</i> not the most
unforeseen, most fantastic circumstance&mdash;swear." Raising his
right hand to heaven, Töllong swore.</p>

<p>"You are the saviour of your country!" exclaimed the stout
man, embracing him.</p>

<p>Töllong was outside in the cold night, in the obscure little
garden; a sharp subtle fragrance came from the gooseberry bushes,
the moon, nearly at the full, was rising above the dark lines of
the roofs.</p>

<p>He hastened back to his inn; his domino had arrived; a
lavender-blue Venetian cloak with a white mask and black hat;
with it was a suit of violet velvet.</p>

<p>Töllong laid all ready in his room, locked the door and went
down to dinner in the public ordinary.</p>

<p>The place was full and he heard a good deal of revolutionary
talk; how quickly these new ideas spread, how free they were in
the capital! In the provinces one had to be circumspect, but here
every topic was openly criticised, every public personage abused,
the example of France, of America, freely admired; "<i>A bas les
tyrants!</i>"; everyone seemed full of intoxicating hope, of
relentless vigour; what a marvellous new world was to rise from
the ruins of the old!</p>

<p>Töllong with difficulty restrained himself from joining in
this patriotic hubbub, especially when the King was abused, ah,
he, too, knew something of that evil monarch.</p>

<p>Slightly lowering their voices the two men at the nearest
table gloated over the vices, the extravagances, the insolences
of the King; all the faults of a corrupt government were laid at
his door; so headstrong, too, and infatuate.</p>

<p>"Can't he see when he is going too far?"</p>

<p>"We want another Brutus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The old Queen-mother now, she knows what she is
about&mdash;she has up-to-date ideas."</p>

<p>Töllong drank another glass of brandy, but no more; he must,
of all things, be sober to-night; but sober was what he could not
be, for the strange events through which he was passing
intoxicated him without the help of spirits.</p>

<p>Boisterously he hailed Captain Erikson, who drove up his
spanking greys exact to the minute.</p>

<p>"You city folk are pretty cool! The people here talk boldly of
the most delicate subjects&mdash;even railing against the
King&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing! One hears that kind of conversation at
any mess table&mdash;it is rather the fashion. Rousseau,
Voltaire, Danton! Come along, I will take you to a cabaret where
you will hear some fine spouting!"</p>

<p>"Do you, an officer of the garrison, dare to frequent such
haunts?" asked Töllong, springing in beside the other as the
sledge took the street again, sending the powdered snow
flying.</p>

<p>"Oh, the city is very badly policed, one does what one likes!
It is easy to see that everything goes to pieces!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Töllong, settling under the warm fur
rugs, "that the King must be not only a scoundrel, but an
imbecile!"</p>

<p>"Very likely&mdash;they say he is certain to be assassinated
one of these days."</p>

<p>Töllong, startled:</p>

<p>"He takes no precautions?"</p>

<p>"Eh, how do I know!" replied the young officer, who seemed
indeed a wild, reckless fellow. "But why do you call him a
scoundrel? Has he <i>ruined</i> your sister, seduced your wife,
or cast your old father into prison?"</p>

<p>"Bah, he has never heard of my existence&mdash;but everyone
knows he is a scoundrel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have heard him sometimes called a reformer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, he is a contemptible tyrant." Töllong spoke
casually.</p>

<p>"Why should we concern ourselves with him! Perhaps the old
Queen is more to your mind&mdash;she is always quarrelling with
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her," lied Töllong.</p>

<p>The sledge drew up at an obscure cabaret; the windows sent
long rays of yellow light on to the piled snow without; a porter
sprang out to seize the reins, Töllong followed his friend into
noise, warmth, a close atmosphere of food and wine odours, then
into a crowded inner room where the company greeted Gustaf
Erikson with lusty pleasure.</p>

<p>"I must be cautious," Töllong told himself, "or these half-
drunken fools will delay me."</p>

<p>Seizing him by the arm Erikson shouted:</p>

<p>"Here is Olaf Brandt whom I fished out of the lake this
morning&mdash;he was frozen as stiff as a radish! A fine
introduction to Stockholm! But&mdash;what do you think, this
lucky devil has a ticket for the masquerade to-night!"</p>

<p>"I have a friend at court," Töllong hastened to explain. "No
names, gentlemen, you understand!"</p>

<p>He sat down in the chair pulled out for him; he had a pleasant
feeling of dominating them all, that there was something in his
air, his glance that betrayed his full and magnificent life, his
powerful purpose which was soon to sweep up to a dramatic climax
that would startle the whole of Europe, yes, soon the whole world
would hear of Eügen Tölling!</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Erikson. "What is the subject for debate to-
night! Was it not to be that man should live to his full
capacity&mdash;regardless of commendation and convention?"</p>

<p>By this Töllong learned that he had been introduced into some
manner of club and one which, despite the presence of several
officers, was of a revolutionary tendency; many of those crowded
round the table began to talk together; how full of eagerness and
vivacity they were, how they clamoured for youth, youth! Away
with the old men, away with the middle-aged men, away with all
mouldering tradition, sentiment, and rules!</p>

<p>There were several pretty women present; and they were loudest
of all in their enthusiastic outcry; one, of a flamboyant beauty,
sat next Töllong, crowded up to him in the press; her bosom was
bare, a fur hat was tied under her chin, she continually offered
to touch glasses with Töllong, inviting him to drink, but he
remembered the badge on his breast&mdash;"hurry!"</p>

<p>Through the tobacco smoke showed a clock painted with pale,
sickly sentimental wreaths of blue and pink flowers; Töllong
watched the minutes tick away on the bland face of this
timepiece; he must be wary, sober, quick.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, overwhelmed by a spasm of giddiness; he
seemed to be floundering in the black, icy water again, being
sucked under the dark blue ice floes; he heard Erikson
vehemently, with reckless gaiety, talking this wild modern
talk&mdash;he, Eügen Töllong, ought to love that man who had
saved him for such a glorious destiny&mdash;</p>

<p>"Man's utmost capabilities!" cried Erikson; "who knows if he
is not a potential hero or murderer!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the same thing," said Töllong's neighbour,
nudging him.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes; the heated faces crowded round the table
looked grotesque&mdash;some seemed even to assume animal shapes,
foxes, wolves, ferrets&mdash;only the amiable countenance of
Gustaf Erikson remained charming, ingenuous amid the hurly-
burly.</p>

<p>Töllong struggled to his feet amid burst of laughter; there
were shouts of "Speech! Speech!"</p>

<p>Was it possible, he wondered, that he was becoming light-
headed, or even a little drunk, or that the submersion in the
lake had left a fever in his blood?</p>

<p>"I must get away," he declared&mdash;"this is all very
amusing, but while you are all talking I have work to
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fair woman at his side tried to detain him.</p>

<p>"What work, tell us; we are all friends here!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to the masquerade!" cried
another.</p>

<p>They all laughed again; insanely, Töllong thought; the circle
of faces began to dip and reel before him, the insipid dial of
the clock seemed to simper through that idiotic wreath of pallid
flowers.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" said Töllong under his breath, and broke through the
room; laughter followed him; he hurried across the outer parlour;
a drunkard, still clasping a pewter pot, was being thrown out;
Töllong broke into the open air; ah, that was better!</p>

<p>The fresh, clear cold after the stale heat of the stove, the
sting of the frosty wind on one's face, the icy sparkle of the
stars overhead&mdash;now the high heroic purpose showed definite
again.</p>

<p>The snow was beautiful in the light from the tavern window,
the pure white drifts flushed with amber gold; Töllong hurried;
the city was splendid about him, rich, darkling; he saw nothing
squalid nor vile.</p>

<p>Back again in his room at The Silver Antlers he changed into
the carnival suit and cloak; at midnight precisely a stranger, a
sober sad-looking man, called for him; another sledge was at the
door, two impatient horses&mdash;ah, that was it, movement,
perpetual movement!&mdash;hurry, hurry, towards the great
climax!</p>

<p>"You have your ticket?" asked the muffled man beside him as
they drove to the palace.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You will be admitted to the ball by a side entrance&mdash;but
the police are very watchful just now&mdash;every mask may be
asked to show his ticket&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am in every way prepared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No hesitancies, no regrets of any kind, no tremors, Eügen
Töllong?"</p>

<p>"None," he replied, thinking how famous that name would be to-
morrow.</p>

<p>The palace suddenly towered over them, blocking out the stars;
a figure sprang out from the shadows to seize the reins, the two
jumped out, skirted the wall, entered by a small door, crossed
the garden and were in the grandiose building.</p>

<p>A narrow dark staircase led to a plainly furnished room
overheated by a white porcelain stove; a parrot slept in an ebony
ring, a length of linen embroidered in gold sequins trailed over
a hooded chair.</p>

<p>Töllong struggled against a sense of unreality; too many
varied scenes had he been hurried through in the last few hours;
he could scarcely control his exalted mood. His companion,
looking at him sharply, demanded: "Are you ill? Do your spirits,
after all, fail?"</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>"Follow me, then&mdash;and be circumspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another room hung with grey serge in sign of mourning, a huge
bed with black posts and tufts of sable plumes above the crape
canopy on which the dust lay heavily; a stove of dark glaze with
the grate pulled open showing the fire as red as hell&mdash;an
old woman in a great chair wearing the monstrous headdress of
twenty years before.</p>

<p>Töllong went on one knee and the lady held out a withered hand
covered with ugly jewellery.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;you are he!" she exclaimed eagerly, "and the moment
has come at last!"</p>

<p>"I am, Madame, ready."</p>

<p>Töllong gazed with veneration at the repulsive old hag; she
had reigned beside Sweden's greatest King during the golden age
of splendid victory, of freedom and progress; for years she had
been a prisoner in the hands of the brood descended from her
husband's disastrous first marriage with the false intriguing
Latin; her own children had been exiled or slain.</p>

<p>But even in her great age she preserved the spirit and energy
of her youth and was the linch-pin of numerous conspiracies; all
had been unsuccessful and followed by bloody reprisals, all save
this last skilful plot, long in maturing.</p>

<p>The ancient Queen, who had been for so long an historic
figure, a relic of the gorgeous past, an inspiration for an even
more gorgeous future, was a hideous enough figure in her painted
decrepitude, her lean head nodding with palsy, her lips drawn up
like a purse with a string, her whistling voice.</p>

<p>But Töllong bowed before her courage, her race, her
patriotism.</p>

<p>"Odd," she grinned, "that this great work should come into the
hands of a raw young provincial like you&mdash;hold up your head
and let me look at you!"</p>

<p>"The lot fell to me, Madame."</p>

<p>Töllong raised his gaunt face, so hard in outline for all his
youth; the harsh blue eyes over-vivid with the blaze of
fanaticism.</p>

<p>"You'll do," chuckled the Queen. "Though they say he has the
devil's luck, it should desert him this time!"</p>

<p>"I do not see how I can possibly fail."</p>

<p>The old woman nodded with approval; she had great dignity; it
was astonishing to reflect how many tragedies she had seen, how
many delusions and disappointments she had survived.</p>

<p>"You will be the liberator of your country," she said, "but
very likely you will never hear anyone call you that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong on one knee before her, in his fantastic garb, felt
love of life well into his heart; he suddenly recalled, with
intense regret, the fleshly young woman who had sat next him in
the cabaret; again he seemed to be beneath the lake, in blackness
under the ice; the old voice came from a distance.</p>

<p>"Some women would not have avowed themselves to you&mdash;but
my House has never lacked courage. I wished to thank you, to
assure you that you will rid the country of a tyrant, a vicious,
cruel, blasphemous wretch."</p>

<p>Töllong opened his eyes; this sounded like the talk in the
cabaret; the old creature was sunk into her hooded chair; there
was something disgusting about her intense vitality; why should
she any longer care about the disposition of kingdoms?</p>

<p>Töllong wished that he had not seen her; she gave him her
blessing; God, she was sure, would give His benison to the deed
that would put her son on the throne.</p>

<p>A widow for forty years, she had lived shut away in deepest
mourning&mdash;the day that her husband's grandson was no more
her dismal rooms would be hung with ruddy brocade.</p>

<p>She babbled on; Töllong's companion whispered the
password&mdash;"Hurry!" in his ear; he rose, thinking that she
had forgotten his presence, but, as he was departing, she said
clearly:</p>

<p>"If you <i>can</i> escape&mdash;remember your way here, I
would hide you&mdash;perhaps, after all, you may live to be a
hero!"</p>

<p>Töllong was conducted down long, dim corridors; on one side
were large circular windows wreathed with massive alabaster
fruit; Töllong peered through one of these into the ballroom
below.</p>

<p>The masquerade, which was to continue until seven in the
morning, had begun.</p>

<p>A low delicate fountain cast glittering drops into a pool lit
by faint coloured lamps; on the strong jets little scarlet balls
danced; round this, in the centre of the great ballroom moved the
masks in elaborate disguises.</p>

<p>Invisible musicians provided delicious music, at once rich and
fine; buffets placed against the walls of blue-veined alabaster
were heaped with sweetmeats and <i>corbeilles</i> of hot-house
peaches, nectarines, muscat grapes and gnarled melons, wreathed
by garlands of jasmine and orange blossoms.</p>

<p>The crowd perpetually moved to and fro, and perpetually
laughed.</p>

<p>Töllong peered from behind the carvings of the circular window
at which no one thought to glance up.</p>

<p>His companion, gazing over his shoulder, whispered: "That is
he, in the purple red domino with the white lining&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you be absolutely sure?"</p>

<p>"I am his valet," replied the sad-faced man. "I put it on him
myself."</p>

<p>Töllong startled.</p>

<p>"Is he as much hated as that?"</p>

<p>He thought it an ugly thing that a man's own body-servant
should betray him.</p>

<p>"And to make everything quite certain," continued the servant
in an even lower whisper, "I put a little ruby brooch, that he is
quite unaware of himself, in the back of the collar of his
cloak."</p>

<p>"I shall make no mistake," grinned Töllong.</p>

<p>"Now I must go, lest I am found missing from my post."</p>

<p>He crept away, down the corridor, and Eügen Töllong's gaze
followed through the shifting, brilliant crowd the man whom he
had hastened across the country to assassinate.</p>

<p>Everything had gone smoothly; so much intelligence, care and
skilful organisation had gone to make it possible for him to be
here, in the royal palace with a long, sharp, fine knife under
his cloak ready to rid Sweden of the tyrant who flaunted so
securely below.</p>

<p>So many plots had been discovered, but this would not be; so
many attempts on the King's life had been foiled, but this would
not be&mdash;</p>

<p>The man sauntering among his guests below was as surely doomed
as if steel was already next his ribs.</p>

<p>Töllong leant his head against the rich window frame; queer
waves of giddiness swept over him, he was now hot, now cold; he
shivered though the palace was luxuriously warm.</p>

<p>He refused to admit that he was excited; it must be a touch of
fever following his accident; but he could not deny that he
began, for the first time, to realise that he intended to murder
a fellow creature. Yes, he had considered himself utterly without
heart or conscience in this affair, but now&mdash;bah! he must be
ill!</p>

<p>Grimly controlling himself, he deliberately noted the way he
had come from the old Queen's apartments&mdash;she had said she
would hide him&mdash;that would be his one chance of
escape&mdash;but he must not think of himself.</p>

<p>It was easy to reach the ballroom; as he descended the stairs
where several revellers had strayed, he saw, through a window of
clear glass, fireworks rising and falling across the park; the
beauty, the gaiety of these artificial suns and stars in green,
violet, gold and ruby added to his excitement, which was
increased by the gorgeous spectacle in which he found himself
when he entered the ballroom&mdash;never had he seen anything so
splendid.</p>

<p>Here, opulent, insolent and still supreme was the world which
men like himself had sworn to destroy&mdash;here was what all the
people in The Silver Antlers, in the cabaret, had raved
against&mdash;how imposing it was, how august, how, in some
subtle way, different from that gross luxury, that wasteful
extravagance that Töllong had so often heard so ferociously
denounced; now it seemed impossible that there could be anything
sinful in what was so rich, so exquisite&mdash;</p>

<p>He was touched on the arm; the password "Hurry!" was whispered
in his ear under cover of the sweet incessant music; he followed
the scarlet domino who had spoken into an alcove where gilded
alabaster statues of the Three Graces poured scented water into a
silver basin.</p>

<p>The mask, whose voice Töllong recognised as the stout member
of the Committee, said:</p>

<p>"You have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," whispered Töllong. "I have never lost sight of
him&mdash;but there is no chance of a mistake? He has not changed
dominoes with anyone? I have heard of such things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be at ease&mdash;to make all certain&mdash;I will call him
aside and tell him something so startling that he will raise his
vizard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do not know him!"</p>

<p>"I do," the corpulent man chuckled; evidently he was a great
personage about the court&mdash;"if it is he I will say the one
word&mdash;'hurry!'&mdash;and you will strike&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well." Töllong was shuddering to his heart. "But what
can you tell him to so move him!"</p>

<p>The other laughed grossly.</p>

<p>"I shall tell him I have discovered a plot to assassinate him!
That's a good joke, eh? You have all ready? A firm blow,
remember, though his cloak is only light silk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Töllong felt sunk in waves of perfume, of music that blended
into the icy waters of the lake; he saw a woman unmask in the
recess behind the alabaster statues; she laughed into the hidden
visage of her companion; there were big diamonds round her
throat.</p>

<p>"That is the Princess Ulrica, the King's sister&mdash;she does
as much evil as he; afterwards&mdash;she must be disposed
of."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," muttered Töllong. "I thought I saw her in a
cabaret to-night among a party of revolutionaries&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must keep your wits about you better&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scarlet domino moved away; Eügen Töllong thought that the
Princess was looking at him; he put up a prayer both for himself
and the man he was about to kill, and again he had the sensation
of water closing over him; icy currents that were yet perfumed,
cracking floes that gave out the music of violins, a cruel ice
maiden lurking in the depths who had the features of the woman in
the cabaret, of the Princess Ulrica...of his evil spirit.</p>

<p>The scarlet and the purple-red domino entered the alcove
together; Töllong fixed his gaze on the brooch of rubies on the
deep silk collar&mdash;how many inches below that must he
strike?</p>

<p>He slipped behind the simpering statues; the woman had moved
away; he was distracted by the sight of her gauzy fan she had
left behind; he heard the conspirator say:</p>

<p>"Sire&mdash;this is deeply important&mdash;a plot against your
life&mdash;I must be assured that it is His Majesty to whom I
speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely you cannot mistake me, my dear councillor, even in a
mask!" But as he uttered these words the speaker raised his
vizard and his companion at once ejaculated: "Hurry!"</p>

<p>Töllong sprang forward, his knife in his hand; it did not seem
possible then that any miracle could have saved the King.</p>

<p>But Töllong's raised arm fell to his side, the knife dropped
at his feet, with a horrid exclamation he turned and stumbled
away.</p>

<p>In the face the King turned on him he had recognised the
candid, amiable countenance of Gustaf Erikson.</p>

<p>He was conscious of a hubbub, a shrieking behind him; he
groaned in the hysterical anguish of the realisation of his own
deception as he fled through the silken crowd, pushing aside
garlands from porticoes.</p>

<p>It was he, not the tyrant, who was doomed to die to-
night&mdash;ah, he understood how that wicked man had fooled
him&mdash;stolen his papers, looked through his pockets&mdash;led
him on, wickedly disguised, with his evil sister, knowing that at
the supreme moment he, Eügen Töllong, would be unable to strike
the man who had saved his life.</p>

<p>He dare not think of the hundreds he had betrayed by his
cowardice, of the heroic old Queen impatient to proclaim him
"hero," of all those waiting for a signal that now would never be
given&mdash;"Hurry!" not to another's end but to his own; he and
not the King had been doomed when the lot was drawn.</p>

<p>He flung aside his mask, his domino&mdash;all disguise was
useless&mdash;and fled down the frozen path, embracing the
imaginary waters that closed over his head; the hubbub was behind
him; before him the fireworks soared and scattered; he saw them
beneath his feet, he was near water then; without pause he flung
himself headlong; his plunge broke the reflected glories of the
sham stars; a panting crowd with lanterns gathered round the
stone edge of the artificial lake, jostling each other in the
bewildering light and shade.</p>

<p>Councillor &mdash;&mdash;, panting behind the King, who seemed
to regard the whole affair as a jest, thought, very bitterly:</p>

<p>"How is it that they all fail when it comes to the scratch! He
seemed such a likely fellow&mdash;and to lose his head so
desperately! It is true that I am not able to do it
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eügen Tölling was dragged out of the pretty little pond and
laid at the feet of the King; his teeth were showing, his harsh
hair stuck out in spikes; he looked like a drowned wolf; the
Princess Ulrica shrieked, but gazed greedily.</p>

<p>"Conscience makes cowards of us all," quoted a pedant
solemnly; the King said:</p>

<p>"Bah! the fellow was mad!"</p>

<p>Both were right; the King never knew that he owed his life to
a slight likeness he bore to one Gustaf Erikson who at that
moment was enjoying himself in a cabaret where revolutionary
doctrines were discussed.</p>

<p>The festival crowd dispersed from about the corpse which was
fast becoming frozen; all shuddered back to the warmth, the
music, the perfumes; even his fellow-conspirators were glad to
forsake Eügen Töllong.</p>

<p>"How quickly he died!" one whispered with horror. But Töllong
had been dying since he had received the command to murder.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. THE CELADON VASE</h2>

<p class="first">
VON BRÜHL governed a kingdom and found life going stale and
sour about him; he could not understand how those whose work was
obviously even duller than his own found the fortitude to resist
suicide; if he, handling what people called "big affairs," could
find it scarcely worth while, how could those little wretches,
with no excitement, no prospects, endure it?</p>

<p>Yet some of them seemed happy.</p>

<p>"If I could only find a man to turn it all over to, I would
grow melons and read philosophy."</p>

<p>Von Brühl was so bored that he indulged in the courtier's
dream of a careless country life with exotic fruits ripening
under glass, windows wide on a lawn in eternal summer shade,
volumes of the sophists easy to the hand, and perfect meals
prepared by invisible cooks.</p>

<p>But Von Brühl was a patriot; he would not seriously think of
leaving his place until he could find someone as able as himself
to fill it; by that he meant someone as shrewd, as hard, as
unscrupulous; the first Minister would have to be everything, for
the King was the most stupid man alive.</p>

<p>Every morning Von Brühl would find himself in the royal
cabinet with an empty portfolio under his arm; always he would
find the King deep in a low chair, smoking a tasselled pipe,
experimenting in different tobaccos. Always there would be a
respectful pause of five minutes as if one statesman waited for
another's matured opinion; then His Majesty would say:</p>

<p>"Von Brühl, how much money have we got?"</p>

<p>And the Minister, inclining a little lower, would answer:
"Sufficient for Your Majesty's needs."</p>

<p>And that would be an end of the audience. A faint shade of
satisfaction would pass over the moonlike countenance of His
Majesty, blurred by the tobacco smoke, and Von Brühl would go
about his business of the Kingdom, which he ran very efficiently
and very profitably to himself He found that the more wearied he
became with his successful routine, the more interest he took in
little things; small objects of compact beauty like jewelled
watches from Nürnberg, carpets with black cypress trees on a blue
ground from Ispahan, rosy pastels from France and cups of
flamecoloured-egg shell enamel from China.</p>

<p>"These," said Von Brühl, contemptuous of himself, "are the
toys of my second childhood."</p>

<p>He possessed a pair of vases in celadon green ware, lustrous
as polished gold, delicate as a hot-house-grown leaf, flawless as
a youth's dream of love.</p>

<p>To Von Brühl they were like living creatures; he caressed them
with his tired fingers and lingered over their perfection in his
tired mind.</p>

<p>He kept them on a shelf above his bureau; a mirror behind
duplicated their beauty; he would look up from reports,
dispatches, protocols, petitions, all, to his disillusioned mind,
revealing human futility or human frustration, and his spirit
would feed eagerly, like a traveller sucking ripe dates in the
desert, on the matchless grace of the celadon green vases.</p>

<p>Bertheim was the one man whom Von Brühl believed capable of
succeeding him; but Bertheim was too young, had too much heart,
might possibly be swayed by women, was altogether not
sufficiently disenchanted; yet he was enthusiastic, adroit,
artful. Von Brühl thought, some day, of suggesting him to the
King; he would certainly be able to make a good appearance in the
royal closet with the empty portfolio, under his arm, and would
be capable of answering His Majesty's one question with the
correct air.</p>

<p>But the Minister regretted the moment of utter <i>ennui</i> in
which he had held out this hope to Bertheim, for that gentleman
became gracefully importunate, a little weary of waiting.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," declared Von Brühl, "I'd give up my post to-
morrow if I thought you were capable of filling it; believe me, I
am as tired as a pack-horse. If you knew my experiences you'd
hardly be so eager&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to know your experiences, Baron, I want to
have some of my own. I suppose I've earned the right to activity
as you have earned the right to rest."</p>

<p>Von Brühl reflected.</p>

<p>"If you were a cleverer man than I you would be able to
deceive me. As it is I can read you like a text-book."</p>

<p>"I've never tried to deceive you. Besides, what need of the
'cleverer,' my dear Baron? If I was as clever as you, would it
not be sufficient?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. But are you?"</p>

<p>Bertheim replied modestly:</p>

<p>"I hope to be&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without boasting Von Brühl declared:</p>

<p>"If you could, only once, completely outwit me I'd step
down&mdash;but no, I fear I am altogether too <i>ruse,</i> my
dear Count."</p>

<p>That day one of the celadon vases was broken; of course, no
one would take the responsibility for such a catastrophe; the
fine fragments, glistening like a wet lily leaf and delicate as
the shell of a thrush's egg lay scattered on Von Brühl's bureau;
possibly the lackey searching for that very choice tobacco the
Minister kept hidden in his desk?</p>

<p>It was the definite loss of an enchantment to the Minister,
though he had believed himself completely disillusioned; the
single vase irritated him; it was symbolical of frustration, of
incompletion, even of disaster, for he could never glance at it
without experiencing again the horrid sensation he had felt on
seeing those shattered shards on his writing table.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to match the vase; agents in Europe and the
East discreetly sought for the exact replica of the forlorn piece
on Von Brühl's shelf; but in vain. This quest for the seemingly
unattainable began to be identified in the Minister's mind with
the length of his term of office&mdash;"when I've found the vase
I'll hand everything over to Bertheim."</p>

<p>This possible successor, himself a <i>dilettante,</i> did not
know of this whimsical decision, but he tried to find the
companion to the vase so stupidly broken: "to oblige you, my dear
Baron." But the perfect celadon porcelain, exact in shape and
colour, in glaze, lustre and fragility, could not be found.</p>

<p>It was Bertheim who suggested:</p>

<p>"Is it not rather a mistake to endeavour to replace a lost
dream?"</p>

<p>"A dream&mdash;at my age!" Von Brühl's smile was a little
bitter; he gave away his capricious decision. "It is purely a
practical matter&mdash;if you could find the vase I would give
you my post."</p>

<p>That winter the Minister had business with the <i>Signoria</i>
and met Ferdinand Bertheim at the carnival in Venice; the young
man waited on him in his amber-coloured marble palace on the
Grand Canal; Von Brühl was surprised; he did not know Bertheim
had left Dresden.</p>

<p>"I am preparing myself, with a little diversion, for the cares
of office," explained Bertheim; he wore a russet silk domino, a
buff satin coat; never before had Von Brühl noticed that his neat
triangle-shaped face, so alert and healthy under the abundant
chestnut hair, was very like the elegant mask of a handsome young
fox; the Minister felt in comparison exceptionally old and tired;
the fireworks beyond the dark water fatigued him with flares and
crackles. Bertheim's page brought in a case; opened, the padded
interior revealed another celadon vase. Von Brühl knew at once
that it was exact to that which he had left forlorn in his
cabinet in the <i>Residenzschloss</i> in Dresden; a minute
scrutiny proved it to be perfect in every detail. Thankful to be
relieved of the cares of office Von Brühl embraced Bertheim.</p>

<p>"The office is yours, if you have not been able to outwit me,
at least you have been able to oblige me. And certainly you have
proved yourself both able and fortunate in finding the celadon
vase."</p>

<p>Bertheim departed immediately for Dresden, but Von Brühl
lingered a little in Venice to complete, as his last gesture of
service to his country, the agreement with the
<i>Signoria.</i></p>

<p>On his return he found Bertheim respectfully waiting to take
over the seals of office; but his lackey was also reluctantly
waiting to tell him that the other celadon vase had been
mysteriously broken during his absence...this time not a fragment
remained; the pieces of porcelain had entirely gone.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," condoled Bertheim, "you are lucky, Baron, to have
even the one vase I procured for you as a reminder of a shattered
delight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Von Brühl looked at him keenly; he was a shade too
impassive.</p>

<p>"Ah! I know. You stole my vase!" cried the Minister with
satisfaction, glad to find his successor so clever, "and brought
it to me in Venice&mdash;"</p>

<p>Quickly Bertheim saw his cue&mdash;his eyes turned suddenly on
Von Brühl.</p>

<p>"You challenged me to a trick, my dear Baron. But I am not
confessing."</p>

<p>"No," returned Von Brühl, yet more delighted, "that is always
in the worst of taste. I believe you will take my place quite
well. I shall content myself with one vase, which will always
remind me of the capabilities of my successor&mdash;and your
little saw, Count, about not trying to replace a dream."</p>

<p>The next morning it was Bertheim who stood bowing in the royal
cabinet; the King was silent for ten minutes instead of five
before he asked:</p>

<p>"Where is Von Brühl?"</p>

<p>"Retired to his estates, Sire. At last."</p>

<p>After smoking thoughtfully for awhile, His Majesty, with a
slight indication of relief, remarked:</p>

<p>"Then he need never know that I smashed both his green vases
looking for that Turkish tobacco he keeps hidden in his
bureau&mdash;the last whilst you were in Venice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Sire."</p>

<p>Bertheim no longer regretted the time and money spent on
finding the vase Von Brühl had taken into the country. His
Majesty settled comfortably into his chair and asked: "Well,
Bertheim, how much money have we got?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. LALLY OF DILLON'S</h2>

<p class="first"><br>
"SEND me," said the Cardinal, "Lally of Dillon's." M. Anelot
permitted himself a smile. For years His Eminence, agreeably but
definitely, had been avoiding Lally of Dillon's, all his schemes
and all his importunities.</p>

<p>"You see," said the Cardinal, noting the discreet amusement on
his secretary's face, "I have found some business for the
gentleman at last. Belleisle and Chauvigny have spoken to me of
him, lately."</p>

<p>"He has," suggested the secretary slily, "another scheme in
hand, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"He has always schemes in hand."</p>

<p>"Do you," asked the secretary, "altogether trust him, Your
Eminence? He is very seductive, but, do you altogether put much
faith in him for a serious piece of work?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said the Cardinal, "but, all the same, I believe
that he may be useful."</p>

<p>That afternoon Lally of Dillon's found himself where for years
he had striven to be&mdash;in the private apartments of His
Eminence Cardinal Fleury, master of France&mdash;sole guardian
and minister of the young King, and the supreme disposer of that
immense power that Lally of Dillon's had, since he was a youth,
striven to enlist in the cause of the Stewart King and the Irish
nation.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Lally of Dillon's Brigade, who was a bold,
ambitious, restless and brilliant soldier, had been as
strenuously and continuously endeavouring to obtain an audience
of the Cardinal as the astute, cautious, and tactful priest had
been endeavouring to avoid him.</p>

<p>Captain Lally remarked on these facts with a frankness that
was one of his most engaging qualities.</p>

<p>"I never believed that Your Eminence would ever see me or
listen to any scheme of mine."</p>

<p>"I scarcely believed so myself; Captain Lally," replied the
Cardinal in a sweet and amiable manner. "But I may be able, it
seems, to take some advantage of your loyalty to your house and
country, and your devotion"&mdash;he lightly stressed
this&mdash;"to the interests of France."</p>

<p>"Neither can be doubted," said the Irishman firmly. And they
looked at each other a little, in silence.</p>

<p>Each was, in his different way, a notable man. Andre Hercule
de Fleury, Bishop of Frejus, and Cardinal, was then eighty-five
years old, possessed of an exact delicate and spiritual beauty,
and the most perfect of manners. He was, perhaps, not often
sincere in either his words or his actions; like most men of
intelligence and experience, he occupied himself in finding
diversion for that internal dissatisfaction and amazement that
consumes most human beings who are not distracted by the heats of
passions. The finest distraction that Cardinal Fleury had
discovered was governing France; though not of brilliant
abilities, he had shown a negative cleverness in never committing
himself to any definite policy. His tact was as unlimited as his
power, he offended no one, not even those he disliked; amiable,
fastidious, serene, he surveyed the young soldier who humorously
awaited the result of this scrutiny.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Arthur Lally, of Dillon's Brigade of the Irish
troops, in the service of the King of France, had a fine person
and a fine record. He was the son of Sir Gerard Lally and the
nephew of Lord Dillon. His mother was a De Brissac, and in his
true titles he was one of the O'Mullaghs of Tuam or Tullaghdalie,
who had been princes in Ireland before Strongbow came to Ireland.
Cardinal Fleury had the highest opinion of the Irish exiles as
accomplished soldiers and high-spirited martial gentlemen. He had
found them extremely useful in the late war and he knew all about
Captain Lally's record during the conquest of Lorraine; his
behaviour in the trenches before Kehl, at the siege of
Phillipsburg; and the act of audacious bravery by which he had
saved his father's life in the lines of Ettlingen. So far the
Cardinal had had nothing but approval for the behaviour of
Captain Lally in particular and the Irish Brigade in general,
though he had been slow to promote these brilliant officers,
because of his quiet but firm understanding with Walpole's
cabinet at St. James's; for all his exceptional services Lally
was nothing more than a captain of brigadiers, and this final
promotion had come as the reward for a most daring exploit. He
had landed secretly on the English coast, visited all the
Jacobite centres in England, Scotland and Ireland, drawn maps,
surveyed lines of advance, and returned to Fleury's cabinet with
all the details mapped out for a possible campaign.</p>

<p>Cardinal Fleury had not moved in the matter; Lally hardly
dared to hope that he was going to move now.</p>

<p>"What is your last scheme, Captain Lally?" asked the prelate
smoothly, with his insinuating and deceptive air of guileless
patience.</p>

<p>"I wish to serve my king," replied Captain Lally, simply and
directly, "and the plan I have now in hand&mdash;on which I
believe Belleisle and Chauvigny have already broached Your
Eminence&mdash;is an alliance between France and Russia, aimed at
the English and particularly at their maritime and commercial
power."</p>

<p>"A large, bold conception, Captain Lally."</p>

<p>"A sound one," said the Irishman, "not founded on mere
boastings and vapourings round camp-fires, nor the slight and
unstable talk of exiles, Your Eminence, but well planned."</p>

<p>"And how do you propose to set about this?" asked the
Cardinal, very amiably.</p>

<p>"I have an uncle, sir&mdash;Peter Lacy of Ballingarry, who is
a Russian Marshal, and I could get an appointment on his staff
and conduct the affair under cover of that."</p>

<p>The handsome soldier looked with a flashing yet wistful glance
at the old man, whom he hardly hoped to find sympathetic. He had
tasted deeply of the studied delays, unfulfilled promises, and
adroit evasions of the French Court; but there was a natural
buoyancy, ardour and fire about him which no disappointment could
quell.</p>

<p>"You'd go anywhere, do anything, risk all?" queried the
Cardinal, delicately putting his finger-tips together.</p>

<p>"In the way of honour and if it might serve my
prince&mdash;yes!" replied Lally.</p>

<p>"Russia," mused the Cardinal, his voice tired, and his words
sunk to a murmur, "Russia is an enigma; I should certainly very
much like to sound that obscure government. In Russia we have an
enormous potential force; I certainly should not care to see it
enlisted on the side of our enemies. And you are perfectly right,
my dear Captain, in suggesting that in the Germanic confederation
and in Great Britain, France sees the most dangerous and
inveterate of her foes."</p>

<p>"Send me to Petersburg."</p>

<p>"I'll send you," replied the Cardinal, "upon terms. You are,
monsieur, a very accomplished gentleman, a very able soldier; you
carried off that English business as if you were a very able
diplomat&mdash;and yet, I am not entirely sure of you. Eh, do not
be offended. I have had no opportunity of testing you on every
point. But I will send you to Russia upon terms."</p>

<p>"I will go," cried Lally, "on any terms!"</p>

<p>"These, then." The Cardinal leaned easily forward, drew a
small paper from between the pages of a book which rested on his
desk. "You will go to St. Petersburg without credentials, without
a passport. You will sound the Empress and her favourites; you
will broach your scheme and see how it is received. You will
represent France, but unofficially; you may do what you can in
your leisure for your prince and your friends, but you will never
forget, Captain Lally, that you are an officer in the army of His
Most Christian Majesty."</p>

<p>"That's twice you have reminded me of that," said Captain
Lally. "Now, I wonder why?"</p>

<p>"I wish," said the priest suavely, "to be assured of your
loyalty under every possible test. I do not suggest anything so
crude as betrayal or negligence; but it is possible that you
might be tempted away from the service of France."</p>

<p>"It is not possible," said Lally, "while I'm in Dillon's
Brigade&mdash;and Dillon's Brigade fights for France."</p>

<p>The Cardinal slightly inclined his head as if he courteously
accepted this statement.</p>

<p>"Do you take my terms?" he asked. "They are not very good. You
will go as a volunteer diplomat. The King will know how to
recompense your devotion."</p>

<p>"There's only one recompense I want," flashed Lally, "help for
King James."</p>

<p>With a courteous smile the prelate proceeded: "In the event of
failure, you may be disowned. You will write to me the most
detailed despatches of your progress and of your affairs in
Russia in general; and I, if you are successful, will send to you
credentials and authority to form an alliance."</p>

<p>"I'll start to-morrow," said Captain Lally eagerly.</p>

<p>"You take considerable risks, you know?" smiled the Cardinal.
"Russia is an unknown country&mdash;I believe the Empress and her
favourites are little more than barbarians."</p>

<p>"The easier for that," said Lally confidently.</p>

<p>"You think so? Well, if you can manage an imperious woman,
possessed of unlimited power, and the savages whom she has
elevated into her confidence, you will be indeed a most useful
person, my dear Captain Lally; there are not," he added
thoughtfully, "many men would undertake such a commission."</p>

<p>"I have waited for years," replied the impetuous soldier, "for
any chance. I have not the least doubt of a complete
success."</p>

<p>Cardinal Fleury smiled: adroit and astute as he was, he could
not judge how much merit might lie beneath this superb self-
confidence. Of the Irishman's reckless courage, brilliant
personality, seductive good-looks, attractive accomplishments and
swift intelligence there could be no doubt, but for the
Cardinal's ultimate purpose he required more solid qualities than
these.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, fingering his little paper, "you depend
entirely upon your own wits; you will have no more instructions
than those I have already given you."</p>

<p>"But if," asked Captain Lally, "I am successful, if I bring
them to the point of an alliance, then you will acknowledge me
and send me authority?"</p>

<p>The Cardinal bowed:</p>

<p>"You must trust me, my dear Captain Lally, even as I trust
you."</p>

<p>He carefully sealed with his signet the little paper which he
had now folded across.</p>

<p>"All that I shall give you is this," he added; "you will put
it somewhere secure&mdash;screwed into the hollow of your sword-
hilt, stitched inside your boot&mdash;and if there should arise,
as there may arise, in Russia, a moment of emergency, you will
open it and find therein my instructions and advice. On your
honour, Captain Lally, you will not open that paper until you are
in such grave and perilous crisis."</p>

<p>"On my honour," agreed Lally, eagerly and gaily. He put the
paper into a small note-book which he carried in his breast-
pocket, already swollen with many love-letters (each of which
bore a different signature), a relic rescued from the family
chapel by his grandfather before he took part in "the flight of
the wild geese," and several papers covered with lists of
possible Jacobites, and diagrams of landing-places in England and
Ireland.</p>

<p>The old man, sitting motionless in his glittering silk and
fine lawn, watched the young man as he put away his pocket-book,
noted the fine athletic figure in the showy regimentals of
Dillon's Brigade, the handsome dark face, rich black hair so
carefully curled, powdered and pomaded, the air of ardour, power
and pride.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he murmured to himself, "I wonder..." Aloud, he
said:</p>

<p>"You cut a very fine figure on a captain's pay&mdash;how do
you contrive, you Irish?"</p>

<p>"Debts and the cards," smiled Captain Lally briefly.</p>

<p>"It's a queer life," mused the Cardinal; "you're everywhere
but in your own country. You can do everything, but you couldn't
keep your own estates and titles. A strange people!"</p>

<p>"We don't ask for pity, Your Eminence; we give service for
what we get. My father was forty-four years with the
colours&mdash;and only a colonel. And I'm not over-advanced in
being a captain of brigadiers. We've learnt what it is to be
exiled&mdash;we're none of us nice, or difficult, or fastidious,
save where our prince or our honour is concerned."</p>

<p>"You're loyal," said the Cardinal; "remember, when you open
that paper, that I have staked on your loyalty."</p>

<p>"You know the family I come of," said Captain Lally.</p>

<p>The Cardinal reflected that it was odd this young man's
ancestors had been princes of Ireland when those of the present
King of France had been no more than gentlemen...the Cardinal was
surprised by Captain Lally's next action.</p>

<p>The young man crossed to his chair and, with a sudden
impetuous grace, knelt before him.</p>

<p>"Will Your Eminence forget," he asked, "that you are a
Cardinal and I but a poor soldier, and remember only that you are
a priest and I a penitent, and give me your blessing before I
go."</p>

<p>It was not often that Cardinal Fleury was reminded that he was
a priest, and it was still less often that he was asked for his
blessing. His delicate cheek was flushed with the faint, cold
flush of old age, but he gave the blessing with a gracious
dignity, peering out of his dim eyes at the ardent and passionate
beauty of the dark young face looking up at him with such
ingenuous trust; and again, as the Captain rose and left him,
after warmly kissing his withered hand, the Cardinal said to
himself: "I wonder&mdash;I wonder..."</p>

<p>Belleisle, Chauvigny, and all the officers of Dillon's and
Clare's tried to dissuade Lally from undertaking the Cardinal's
secret mission. Belleisle doubted if he would return from
Muscovy, dead or alive; some of the Jacobites who had, during
their adventurous period of exile, penetrated as far as St.
Petersburg, assured him that nothing whatever was to be done at
the barbaric northern court.</p>

<p>"It's a chance," said Captain Lally, "and I'll take it. I've
never asked any more from mortals but chances."</p>

<p>He said good-bye to his many friends and to a certain lady,
who took his departure most lamentably, and who insisted on
presenting him with a dressing-case of which every bottle had a
diamond in the stopper. She knew the poverty concealed behind the
flashing bravado of his appearance, and hoped that these jewels
might serve him in an emergency. Lally accepted the gift and
returned the worth of it in a pair of rose-coloured shoes with
pearl knots for buckles. The lady was in despair, and importuned
heaven for vengeance on Cardinal Fleury&mdash;old, cold, crafty
man!&mdash;for sending out of Paris, in the gay season of the
winter, the most charming of all the Irish officers. Lally cared
nothing either for the dubious encouragements of his friends, the
tears and regrets of the lady, or the discouraging prophecies
that accompanied him on his peculiar journey.</p>

<p>He had never&mdash;since the time when, as a boy of seven, his
father had taken him to serve beside him in the trenches, to
learn something (as Sir Gerald said, grimly) of the look and
smell of war&mdash;asked for a better fortune than to struggle
face to face and to the utmost of his ability with his hereditary
foe, the English, either on the battlefield or in the council
cabinet.</p>

<p>Accompanied by no one save an Irish body-servant, Captain
Lally proceeded as far as Riga; there, as he could show no
passport, he was immediately thrown into prison, but Admiral
Gordon&mdash;a Stewart agent&mdash;procured his release, and
Captain Lally, his baggage and servant restored, continued on his
journey and, arriving at St. Petersburg in the gloom of a Russian
winter, attached himself at once to the staff of his uncle,
Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry, who received him with
affection for his person, but no enthusiasm for his errand.</p>

<p>"Why, it's easier than taking a trench full of dead men," said
Lally cheerfully, and entreated his uncle to carry him to wait
upon the Empress.</p>

<p>"It's not she with whom you'll have to deal, Tom," said
Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry, "but the man Buren, whom she
has made Courland&mdash;who is her master."</p>

<p>"I'll deal with both of them," smiled Captain Lally.</p>

<p>Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry remarked: "It's a queer life
we Irish have, eh?"</p>

<p>"But you seem to flourish here, sir, and the country is well
enough?"</p>

<p>"But I'd sooner be in Paris, Tom," sighed the Marshal.
"They're not civilised here, to my thinking."</p>

<p>"They make a fine show," said Captain Lally, "but here or
there, it's an exile's life."</p>

<p>Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry had no hope of any success
for his nephew's mission, but on an early occasion he presented
his new staff officer to the Empress Anna Ivanowna, niece of the
great Peter, formerly Duchess of Courland, a widow, and Empress
of All the Russias.</p>

<p>This formidable lady had already heard something of Captain
Lally. She knew of his arrest at Riga, and also of the rumours
which said the young soldier was a French agent in disguise, the
fully-accredited ambassador of Cardinal Fleury; she was flattered
by so much attention from the greatest nation in the world.</p>

<p>Lally of Dillon's made a very fine figure. He considered
himself infinitely superior in birth and breeding to any of the
Russians, and this gave a certain lustre of pride to his
seductive manners, and supplied him with a natural pomp which
took the place of a retinue or credentials. The mistress of All
the Russias was of an exuberant beauty, coarse and heavy, with a
look at once capricious and sullen. There was a shade of savagery
in her flat Tartar features, a wilful and passionate
<i>abandon</i> in her manners, a violence in her speech&mdash;all
new to Captain Lally.</p>

<p>He awaited her pleasure with a manly composure, while she
looked him up and down as if he were a new toy. Satisfied with
the result of her insolent scrutiny, she smiled with a voluptuous
grace which made her appear handsome in a barbaric fashion.</p>

<p>Captain Lally only returned the smile in the most formal
fashion, for he had observed standing behind the Empress's chair,
the favourite of whom his uncle had told him&mdash;the Duke of
Courland, who was as definitely master of the Empress as the
Empress was mistress of All the Russias. This person was
regarding the Irishman with a scowl and a sneer.</p>

<p>The Empress asked if it were true that he had been sent by
Cardinal Fleury?</p>

<p>Captain Lally, with dexterous boldness, plunged immediately
into his mission, for he saw that, with Anna Ivanowna, delays and
subtleties would only irritate. With knowledge, with enthusiasm,
Captain Lally sketched his scheme&mdash;the alliance between
France and Russia for the immediate overthrow of England and the
Empire...As he spoke, Anna smiled.</p>

<p>Lally returned the bold encouragement of the Empress with a
cautious grace, not only because she was not greatly to his
taste&mdash;he could, if need were, have assumed that she
was&mdash;but because he was conscious of Courland's lowering
glance in the background. He, therefore, adroitly disengaged
himself from the attention of the Empress and addressed himself
to Buren.</p>

<p>Ivan Ernest Buren, Duke of Courland, was of lowly birth
and&mdash;as his enemies often reminded each other and, when they
dare, the favourite himself&mdash;the grandson of a groom. He was
handsome, able, splendid and unscrupulous.</p>

<p>Captain Lally, to whom he was far more important than the
Empress, regarded him with a secret and impartial anxiety,
wondering how far he could bring this man into his designs.
Courland, who was accustomed to the bitter and scarcely-disguised
disdain and contempt of the Russian nobles, responded instantly
to these flattering attentions from the elegant young foreigner,
and invited Lally to a private conference in his cabinet. Anna
Ivanowna sulked and flounced, but a sombre glance from her
formidable favourite reduced her to a sullen submission.</p>

<p>Courland, with an unsmiling face and folded arms, awaited
Captain Lally's disclosures.</p>

<p>In spite of his superficial French graces, lace and powder,
brocades and ribbands and stars, Courland was very much to the
Irishman's mind like the dark, gloomy and savage bear which has
been taken as an emblem of his incomprehensible country, but
Captain Lally was too elated at his opportunity to consider the
hopelessness of his task.</p>

<p>With easy assurance and deferential civility he proceeded to
lay before the Minister his plan. He spoke to Courland as if he
spoke to the Emperor of all the Russias, caressing him with many
artfully-turned assurances of the great Cardinal's regard and the
estimation in which he, the great Duke of Courland, was held at
Paris. Humiliated, thwarted and slighted on every hand by his
countrymen, who regarded him as an upstart, Courland was
entranced by the subtle flatteries of the Irishman. But he showed
more shrewdness and more self-command than Captain Lally had
altogether expected.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked. "Where are your credentials, and why
is not the French Ambassador in Petersburg entrusted with this
mission?"</p>

<p>"Because," smiled the Irishman, "it's altogether too
confidential, perilous, and nice. As for my credentials, the
first <i>express</i> will bring them, together with the articles
of our alliance ready engrossed, the moment that Your Highness is
prepared to sign."</p>

<p>"You come to me with this," said Courland, staring at
him&mdash;"not to the Empress? And yet she regarded you
favourably enough."</p>

<p>Captain Lally spoke as one man of the world to another. "It is
easy to see," he remarked, "that Your Highness can do what you
please with Her Majesty."</p>

<p>Courland appeared satisfied, though his manner was sombre.
When Lally left the Peterhof he sent at once an exultant despatch
to Cardinal Fleury and begged that his credentials and the
articles of the treaty and all further instructions in the matter
might be sent immediately to him in St. Petersburg. He urged the
need for haste lest the Courlander change his mind, or Anna
Ivanowna discover another favourite. "<i>At present he is her
ears, her eyes, her mouth."</i> At the end of his letter,
significantly underlined, he wrote: "<i>Russia can put into the
field a hundred and thirty thousand regulars and sixty thousand
Cossacks: Your Eminence would surely desire to see these ranged
on the side of France."</i></p>

<p>Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry was a little taken aback by
his nephew's audacity, yet could not withhold applause for what
appeared to be a brilliant success. Courland and the Empress
alike caressed and flattered him, nay, they seemed to compete for
his favours.</p>

<p>Captain Lally, steering his way delicately between their
perilous yet gratifying advances, never forgot the cause he had
in hand. Not only did he continue to press the French alliance,
but he roused up a party for the Jacobites, and pushed his
master's cause with restless and ardent energy. He found,
however, both time and occasion to grace the festivities of the
Peterhof, to soothe the Empress and flatter Courland. He had
observed that Anna Ivanowna was not only infatuated with
Courland, but was afraid of him. The powerful, passionate and
violent woman was silent before the least glance from under those
scowling brows; the least word of reproof that fell from the
groom's grandson. Lally knew that Courland watched him, spied on
him, and he by no means underrated the Russian's ability, while
daily he glowed with a deep and ardent expectancy of success.</p>

<p>But as the weeks went on he heard nothing from Cardinal
Fleury, although the ordinary accredited Ambassador in St.
Petersburg received his usual letters and instructions.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," advised Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry, "I'm
not denying that you've had the luck. But you would be wise to
bring your business to a conclusion while the wind blows fair; it
all seems very smooth and glittering at the Peterhof, but it's
like a bog beneath."</p>

<p>"And I'm walking as if it were a bog," smiled Captain Lally.
"And how can I bring the business to a conclusion if Cardinal
Fleury does not write?"</p>

<p>"It may be he doesn't intend to write," said Marshal Peter
Lacy suspiciously; "maybe your hopes flew too high and you
misunderstood His Eminence, Tom."</p>

<p>"Nay, his instructions were clear enough. He said he trusted
me and I said I trusted him," said the Irishman simply, "and he
gave me his blessing."</p>

<p>"However prudent you are," added the Marshal, as a further
warning, "I should be yet more prudent. I've known those who have
been loaded with honours and ribbands and stars one day poked out
of their beds by bayonets and driven through the snow to Siberia
the next."</p>

<p>Captain Lally was, however, confident in himself; he was
convinced that he could bring the Russians into an agreement and
convinced that Cardinal Fleury would write.</p>

<p>At balls, suppers and banquets, at sledging parties on the
Neva and private conferences with Courland, he pressed his
points, one after one, and lost not the finest or the slightest
opportunity of furthering the cause of his King and of France.
His success was rapid to a point, and there Courland stuck;
although he appeared convinced by the Irishman's arguments he
refused to give the final sanction to the scheme of the alliance
with Fleury. Lally, whose easy brilliance concealed a violent
impatience of delay and opposition, the sluggishness of fools and
the trickery of knaves, suddenly put into execution what his
uncle conceived the most reckless plan of ignoring the favourite
and dealing direct with the Empress.</p>

<p>"I like your schemes, Captain Lally," responded Anna, with a
sleepy, smiling air, "but, as you know, my minister, the Duke of
Courland, deals with affairs; he advises me in everything."</p>

<p>"Does he always," insinuated the audacious Irishman, "advise
Your Majesty to your own advantage?"</p>

<p>The Empress stared at him, a smouldering light in her slanting
Slavonic eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you seek to undermine Courland?" she asked in a thick,
drowsy voice.</p>

<p>She put her hand on her brocaded skirts at the hip and gazed
at Captain Lally with an expression that he could not read.</p>

<p>The Irishman took bold measures and leaped preliminaries as he
had leapt the trenches at Phillipsburg:</p>

<p>"Where one man has got another may get, and the man who has
climbed up can always be pulled down."</p>

<p>Anna Ivanowna leaned forward and patted Captain Lally's hand
where it rested on the malachite table.</p>

<p>"I like brave fellows," she said slowly, "and what you say is,
of course, quite true. Courland exists only by my favour, and
that might be won any day by another."</p>

<p>Captain Lally kept his head in the face of these amazing
advances. He thought that the Empress was like a sulky, heartless
and slumbrous tigress; but he contrived to look as if he
considered her a goddess.</p>

<p>Anna Ivanowna continued to pat his hand.</p>

<p>"Courland," she grumbled, "is the worst tempered man in the
world. If you can get rid of him without any trouble to me you
may have his place."</p>

<p>Captain Lally now understood what his uncle had meant when he
had warned him that, despite the gay splendour and the opulent
luxury of St. Petersburg, the Russians were really savages. He
contrived to extricate himself from the perilous interview by
falling on his knee and covering the Empress's plump hand with
kisses, while he made meaningless and non-committal terms and
expressions of devotion, withdrawing finally under the pretence
of being too moved to continue any longer in the dazzling
presence of the Romanoff.</p>

<p>He went direct to Courland and was received with the usual
impassive, impersonal and inscrutable courtesy that the Russian
always showed.</p>

<p>"I'll give you something," thought the reckless Irishman, "to
quicken up your slow ways."</p>

<p>Aloud, he said: "Courland, you cannot keep the representative
of a great King waiting about like a supplicant in ante-chambers.
Will you or will you not have this alliance on the terms which I
have suggested?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait&mdash;I'll consider," replied the Russian, with
sullen calm.</p>

<p>"No, you will do neither," replied Captain Lally. "If you,
sir, do not care to sign, the Empress will."</p>

<p>"Never," smiled Courland contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Easily," said Captain Lally. "She may be afraid of you, but I
am not. I am inured to intrigue and the lady is fickle; it may be
if it came to a push&mdash;we are both adventurers and ought to
be able to understand each other," he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>The Russian considered this without hostility or malice.</p>

<p>"I never threaten," added Lally steadily, "but I might give
you a warning. Fallen favourites have ugly treatment in this
country. From what I can hear, it is either Siberia or the
Fortress of Peter and Paul."</p>

<p>Courland looked at his rival, with a keen, steady
interest.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he asked without resentment, "that you could
supplant me in the favour of the Empress?"</p>

<p>"Without betraying a lady's confidence," replied the Irishman,
"I can assure you, my dear Duke, that I am certain I could. I can
also assure you," he added, with that air of engaging candour
which he usually found so successful, "that I have not the least
desire to do so. Not only are you better fitted to rule the
Russias than I, but my duties and affections are engaged at
another shrine."</p>

<p>"Still," said Courland, "I suppose you would do it for the
sake of your country and your King?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I would, and needs must, if you keep me dallying
any longer."</p>

<p>Captain Lally stood over the Russian with his terms, exactly
as if he stood over him with a pistol at his forehead. Courland
seemed so fully to appreciate the situation that Captain Lally
had even a higher opinion of his intelligence than before.</p>

<p>"If you undermine me you destroy a friend, Captain Lally. I'll
sign your articles, and immediately. Bring them with you to-
night."</p>

<p>And, with an amiable look and a civil withdrawal, he dismissed
the elated Irishman, who hastened to his uncle with the story of
his triumph.</p>

<p>Certainly his victory had been brilliant, rapid and decisive.
But Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry was able to point out a
fatal flaw in his success. "Where are the articles that Courland
is to sign? Fleury has not written."</p>

<p>Fleury did not write. Even Captain Lally came to the end of
his excuses. He had sent off despatch after despatch, telling of
his success, and demanding the promised support from Cardinal
Fleury. But no answer came.</p>

<p>"You're in it, Tom," sighed Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry.
"Don't I know what it is serving foreigners?"</p>

<p>Captain Lally himself began to lose heart. Not all his ardour
could suffice any longer to hold the scales between the Empress
and Courland. Nor could his utmost caresses, insinuations and
flatteries, frankness and plain-speaking, avail him any further
with the Russian, who every day demanded, in a more peremptory
tone, his credentials and papers.</p>

<p>Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry advised him to leave the
country before the frontiers were closed to him, but Captain
Lally scorned a retreat...even when Courland haughtily summoned
him to the Peterhof and, breaking into a violent fury, threatened
him with arrest as an impostor.</p>

<p>"You've fooled me!" roared the Russian. "Cardinal Fleury never
sent you! You have no power to offer me an alliance with
France!"</p>

<p>"You've the word of an Irish gentleman for your assurance,"
replied Captain Lally calmly; "and as for Cardinal Fleury's
despatches being slow on the way, if you kept your roads in
better condition, maybe they would have been here by now."</p>

<p>"The road to Siberia," shouted Courland, "is in excellent
condition, as you can soon test for yourself!"</p>

<p>"It's been worn smooth by the feet of all the exiles who
you've sent there, I suppose," smiled Captain Lally. "It must be
very diverting to have so much authority. But, as for me, I'd
have you remember that I am in Dillon's Brigade and serve the
King of France."</p>

<p>"The king of hell!" roared the Russian, who had flared from a
long sombre smiling patience to a savage fury. "I'll not believe
you serve any other master! Your Government disowns you!"</p>

<p>Captain Lally escaped from this interview and endeavoured to
obtain one with the Empress, but she refused this favour, and
when he chanced to meet her in the corridors of the Peterhof,
scowled upon him; it was evident that her patience also was
exhausted and that she regarded Lally as a discredited
adventurer.</p>

<p>"I warned you, Tom," sighed Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry;
"now get out of the country while you can."</p>

<p>Lally was obdurate; his bravery was reckless to the point of
foolhardiness. He would not leave St. Petersburg while there was
a chance that the Cardinal might write; he could not endure to
forgo his success&mdash;so quick, so unexpected. But he did not
deny to his uncle that he was in a confounded difficulty and he
bethought him of the little <i>billet</i> which Cardinal Fleury
had given him, and which was only to be opened in a moment of
emergency. This moment had surely now arrived, and Captain Lally
broke the seal and read these lines:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">As you should be in considerable danger before
you read this I think it just to inform you that your mission was
a mere sham. I never intended to support you. I merely sent you
to St. Petersburg as a last expedient to rid myself of one whose
importunities I could not otherwise silence. No one but an
Irishman would have undertaken so forlorn a hope. Adieu, my dear
Captain, I fear for ever!<br> <br> With a thousand regrets,<br><br>
<span class="smcap">Fleury</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>Captain Lally clapped the paper down in front of his uncle.
"That's the way they treat us," he said, with
bitterness&mdash;"fools, dupes and catspaws, eh?"</p>

<p>"The mean old viper!" cried Marshal Peter Lacy of Ballingarry.
"I warned you, Tom, there's not one of them that you can trust
the length of your nose."</p>

<p>"He never thought I'd be successful," said Lally grimly; "had
he known that he would have treated me differently. Now, how to
get out of Russia as quickly as I came in, and get back to Paris
and tell the old, lying cowardly priest this is no way to treat a
gentleman who risks everything for his King."</p>

<p>With that he flung off to the Peterhof to face the matter out;
he was never a man to slink away or leave his work unfinished. He
haughtily demanded an interview with Courland, pointed out in
smooth and impressive sentences the difficulties of conducting
any negotiations behind the backs of the Ambassadors of the
Powers concerned, of the necessity of maintaining a strict
secrecy in the affair, declared his intention to return to Paris
and finally arrange matters personally with the Cardinal, and, as
a final throw, with unfaltering audacity he suggested to Courland
that a Russian envoy should be sent with him to Paris, there to
conclude the negotiations on the spot. The Russian's furies were
overborne; he was baffled, impressed, and dazzled by the splendid
advantages to himself which the Irishman eloquently depicted as
the result of the proposed treaty. He at length gave a reluctant
and sullen consent to Captain Lally's departure for Paris.</p>

<p>But the Irishman was not to leave St. Petersburg without
further obstacles to overcome. The Empress sent for him. Marshal
Peter Lacy of Ballingarry groaned at the summons, but Lally's
headstrong and reckless spirit did not falter.</p>

<p>"I've managed Courland and I'll manage the woman." The Empress
received him favourably.</p>

<p>She had an unexpected and astounding proposal to make&mdash;no
less than that Captain Lally should leave the French service and
enter her own. "She cared nothing," she said, with sleepy
frankness, "for either alliances with France or any other power,
but she very much liked to see handsome and spirited young men
wearing her splendid uniform; and she was sure that Captain
Lally, to whom she would give the command of a regiment of
Cossacks with the title of Brigadier-General, would make himself
both agreeable and useful."</p>

<p>Captain Lally considered the glittering temptation&mdash;only
one thing held him back: Cardinal Fleury's words&mdash;"<i>I
trust you to remember your sworn loyalty to France."</i> He could
rule the Empress, he could oust Courland, he could govern the
Russias, he could make himself a prince in name as he was in
blood, nay, possibly an emperor&mdash;for Courland had the
disadvantage of being a married man, but he&mdash;he was
free...and, against all this, the obscure rank of captain of
brigadiers, in the service of a country which had never rewarded
him for his exertions, and a man who had duped him miserably.</p>

<p>But Captain Lally's loyalty was to Dillon's and to France. He
gave the Empress fair words and evasion and, without even taking
leave of his uncle, escaped across the frontier. Travelling
rapidly, with fury in his heart, he reached Paris in a passion of
rage, and presented himself before the Cardinal.</p>

<p>"Diplomacy goes slowly," smiled the old man; "it may be, if
you had waited until I had sent."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," replied the outraged soldier, "a captain of
brigadiers goes straight to the breach; one who, in his zeal for
the King, courts inglorious danger, ought not to be left to the
mercy of strangers little better than savages, with the result
that, having entered Russia as a lion, I regard myself fortunate
in escaping like a fox."</p>

<p>The old Cardinal smiled.</p>

<p>"The anger of the Captain strikes terror into the priest," he
rejoined meekly. "When we have read your reports we shall
doubtless have occasion to praise your wit, if we may not your
patience."</p>

<p>"And what of your little paper, Monseigneur?" asked Captain
Lally, with a heaving breast and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"That," said Fleury, "can be explained when I have read your
reports." And he laughed a little: "So you came back, after all!
You know, my dear Captain, I hardly expected to see you; those
barbarians are very dangerous when roused."</p>

<p>"I came back," said Captain Lally, "because I had promised to
do so. My service is with Dillon's&mdash;but I'm not sure that I
won't ask to be released of that, and go back to St.
Petersburg."</p>

<p>He told the Cardinal, with contemptuous brevity, of the
Empress's offer.</p>

<p>"Which you refused?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps now, Monseigneur, Your Eminence knows how unnecessary
it was, twice, to remind me where my duty lay."</p>

<p>Cardinal Fleury read the despatches which Captain Lally had
sent from Russia and those which he had brought with him.
Accurate, able, concise, and just in their conclusions, they
contained a complete survey of the court and country of Russia;
their conditions and potential forces&mdash;how France might
utilise these towards the accomplishment of the great aim of the
Irishman's life, the defeat and overthrow of England and the
English. The Cardinal had sufficient ability and clear-
sightedness to appreciate this brilliant work. He summoned the
Captain to a second interview, and this time received him in his
bed, for a chill had taken the Cardinal and he lay shivering in
an aguish fit. He gave Captain Lally his white, feeble hand to
kiss.</p>

<p>"This is all very bold and audacious," he smiled, "but I am
not at all sure that it wouldn't be successful. Aye, Captain
Lally, I have almost made up my mind to send you as Envoy-
Extraordinary to Russia with full credentials, and escort, and
complete power to make this alliance."</p>

<p>"And why," exclaimed Captain Lally, "did you not do that
before?"</p>

<p>"That is perfectly easy to understand. I was not sure of you.
You had not been tempted."</p>

<p>"And the paper?" asked Lally. "Why did you give me that? Many
a man, Your Eminence, would have been driven to despair or some
desperate action on discovering that paper disowning him in a
moment of peril."</p>

<p>"Many a man," murmured the Cardinal, "but not the man I was
looking for. It was a frightful test, no doubt, Captain Lally;
but I believed you would survive it."</p>

<p>Lally gazed at the frail, sick old man in the great ornate
bed.</p>

<p>"You remained loyal," smiled the Cardinal, "you did not leave
the French service, and you extricated yourself from a situation
of appalling difficulty. All this proves that you are exactly the
person for whom I was looking. Rest assured, my dear Captain,
that Russia and France will march together to fight the battles
of your Chevalier St. George."</p>

<p>For three days a golden light of intoxicating hope and glory
surrounded the valiant captain of brigadiers. On the fourth day
Cardinal Fleury died and his successor repudiated the Russian
scheme.</p>

<p>It was Irish luck&mdash;Lally's luck, and taken with a laugh.
The captain of brigadiers returned to his regiment to build
another house of cards&mdash;to shelter a Lost Cause.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. THE EYE OF WAR (OCULUS
BELLI)</h2>

<p class="first">
MATTHIAS MARIASSY wagered Ferdinand Horvath that he would
flourish, before the war was out, the yellow jewel named the Eye
of War, which glowed in the turban of the Grand Signor.</p>

<p>After all, one must do something, have some end in view. The
war was so long, so many of their companions had been shattered
on the battlefield, their ears were tired of the sound of
muskets, culverins and cannon, even of the slap of the sappers'
spades on the earth as they dug trenches, and the songs of the
drunken soldiers at night where they gathered by the glare of the
blazing pitch knots. All had become very boring in the camp at
Zenta.</p>

<p>The supper given by Field-Marshal Mocsary was becoming dull.
Angry with their lowness of spirit the two young men made the mad
wager while Mariassy rolled pellets of bread on the cloth and
Horvath drank wine that made him flushed, but not excited.</p>

<p>"That means, my dear Matthias," he smiled, "that you must
<i>kill</i> the Grand Signor, for I suppose you will hardly get
the thing otherwise."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I have made the wager." Mariassy spoke
sullenly.</p>

<p>He was in love with Marie Batthyany and had not seen her for
three months. He felt weary of the tedious war and of being
fooled by destiny.</p>

<p>The weather was of an intolerable heat, they were too far East
for Christian comfort and they cursed heathendom for being on the
frontiers of their wretched country. All very well for the
Emperor who is safe in Vienna, but day after day of this! They
did not miss their dead companions much, but they could not
forget how they had looked, besmirched, fly-blown, rotting in the
sultry haze of August.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Mocsary, voluble and heated, was vaunting of
great heaven-storming glories, of huge tumultuous victories like
Belgrade&mdash;Peterwaradin. The young men did not listen. At
their end of the table they gossiped of the impoverished Empire,
the malcontent soldiers, the waning fame of the generals...when
the pavilion flap was lifted for some possible air they could see
the pinkish mist, hard as metal over the sullen marshes in the
distance, nearer were tents and men soiled and tattered. Baggage
wagons passed, creaking under loads of coffins, fever and plague
could be smelled on every sick breeze.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal Mocsary continued to boast, his raucous voice
was like the buzz of the flies which circled over the wine stains
on the laced cloth.</p>

<p>Matthias thought of Marie Batthyany in her flesh-coloured
dress of thick satin falling from her lovely shoulders, her
saffron-coloured hair bound with a lace of gold filigree, her
face ardent and innocent, which seemed, in a glance, to entreat
and deny. She had been promised to him when the campaign was
over, he longed to present her with some magnificent exploit as a
marriage gift, he feared some sidelong look of disdain if he did
not impossibly distinguish himself. He swore again that he would
win the "Eye of War."</p>

<p>Horvath asked him cunningly if this unattainable jewel was for
the Countess Marie.</p>

<p>"No, God forbid that she should even touch such a godless,
heathen ornament." And Mariassy frowned, angry that the high-
placed lady should have been mentioned at the camp supper.
Horvath smiled, knowing him lovesick, smiled a little enviously,
too.</p>

<p>She was very lovely, rare and fine. She had that chaste
distinction which would make any favoured lover feel honoured.
She was wealthy, of an ancient house thrice noble and yet, with
all her niceness and high-breeding, there was a voluptuous
softness in all she did and said that fired unbounded passion,
and in her bearing a very extravagance of grace.</p>

<p>Horvath entered the wager on his tablets&mdash;five hundred
rix dollars against the "Eye of War" being in the possession of
Count Matthias Mariassy before the campaign was over.</p>

<p>It would not be the first Turkish trophy to fall into
Christian hands. The Horse Tails of Pashas, the jewelled ring
armour, white jade daggers and pink diamond agraffes of Grand
Viziers glittered in the treasuries at Vienna, Dresden, Hesse-
Cassel, Munich. After a rout of the infidel, rings, buttons,
scimitars and belts of great value could be picked up on the
battlefield or torn from the dead and dying.</p>

<p>"But this stone," Horvath reminded his friend, "never leaves
the Grand Signor's brow save when he sleeps, and then it is
guarded by his janizaries, so thou hast set thyself, my dear sir,
a tedious task."</p>

<p>Mariassy's dark, heavy-lashed eyes were dreamy. He was slim,
black-haired, of a noble outline, he had that impalpable air of
the heroic which charms beyond all other qualities. In his
scarlet, white and bullion-trimmed uniform he appeared a fitting
lieutenant of a courtly Mars, and there was a fiery impatience in
his stately face.</p>

<p>Casting the last of his pellets across the disordered table,
he gazed at the coffin-carts rumbling without and asked, "Who
will some day be called to answer for all this misery?"</p>

<p>The supper was over, the officers went to their quarters,
behind a little wood of stunted trees the moon was up, a
smouldering sultry red, like a dying ember.</p>

<p>A foul miasma hovered above the fens that had sucked in so
many corpses of late, the Imperialists and the mercenaries of all
nations moved among the pavilions, hoping to find a fresher air
with the evening.</p>

<p>Above a half-ruined <i>château</i> turret hung sullenly the
standard of Lorraine, the Commander-in-Chief of this great army.
He lay ill of a quinsy and Prince Eugene of Savoy had taken over
the command. Here and there the drums hurried, concealing the
groans of sick men.</p>

<p>Mariassy's weary mind dwelt on Marie Batthyany&mdash;like a
green lily, like a dove-tinted pearl veiled in the freshet of a
virgin spring, all that was pure, untouched, richly innocent,
lovely, chaste, was Marie Batthyany.</p>

<p>He pictured her at her harp in the low shadows of her gold-
adorned chamber, singing her delicate ballads celebrating an
impossible heroism, the mellifluous songs of Hungary...Blasphemy
even to think of Marie Batthyany in this wild waste of war.</p>

<p>With the night, murky clouds closed over the fiery moon,
through the commotion of the camp sounded the incessant drums,
the thudding hoofs of horses, the shouts of the sentries, of
commands. The young Hungarian officers gambled in their pavilion,
the rix dollars flickered in the gross light of the oil lamp.
After all one must do something, boredom was over them like a
pall. Mariassy still thought of Marie Batthyany, it was like an
aching, gnawing wound in his heart.</p>

<p>A trumpeter summoned him to the sick Commanderin-Chief's
quarters; as he crossed the camp he saw a ruddy glow in the East,
like the "Eye of War" itself, peeping from the frowning
clouds.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lorraine reclined on an embroidered chair by the
open window, a medicated plaster was on his neck, his splendid
face looked small and death-like, he was wrapped in a silk
bedgown and, close to his hand, among the drug bottles was the
<i>bâton</i> of command, embossed with golden eagles. Some
officers and priests stood behind him; a Pandour who had brought
dispatches, furtively wiped the sweat from his brow.</p>

<p>"Colonel Mariassy," said Lorraine, very hoarse and low, "I
have news here of a sudden raid by the Grand Signor, they have
broken through our outposts and besiege Titul."</p>

<p>Mariassy waited eagerly while the Duke struggled with his
failing voice. Was it possible that after weeks of monotonous
duties, of stupid inaction, he was to be given some notable duty
to perform?</p>

<p>"I think," whispered Lorraine, "it is fitting that you, sir,
undertake to regain this fort, for it seems that on an alarm of
this raid several Hungarian ladies fled to Titul and among them
was the Countess Marie Batthyany."</p>

<p>When the Hungarian officer had received these orders and left
the room, the sick General smiled at one of his adjutants.</p>

<p>"I think I shall save my fort of Titul, eh?"</p>

<p>Over the plains of Zenta the Hungarian regiment passed at a
gallop. Stammering with excitement, Mariassy had given his
orders. Unchecked, his great warrior horse leapt forward, like
the steady flow of a great wave the Imperialists surged towards
Titul.</p>

<p>The blaze of distant fireballs lit an airless dawn, the first
rays of the sun fell on the Hungarians riding slowly for fear of
bursting their horses' hearts. The light glinted along their
scabbards, the gold-wreathed breastplates, the knots of bullion
in their cockades.</p>

<p>Before them rose the fort of Titul, guarding desolation.</p>

<p>Horvath, leaning from his leopard-skin saddle towards
Mariassy, reminded him of his wager.</p>

<p>"Since the Grand Signor in person made this foray, maybe thou
wilt have thy chance of the <i>oculus belli."</i></p>

<p>Mariassy did not reply. No word had he spoken of this since
Lorraine had given him this charge. It seemed as if he had been
aware of nothing but the sound of his five hundred horse behind
him. Horvath shrugged, respecting one who gambled deep with
destiny. After all Matthias Mariassy had excuse for his wild
silence, the very thought of the women being taken by the Turks
was Hell open at the feet of Christian men, and Marie
Batthyany...</p>

<p>The Imperialists halted beneath the citadel. It was clear that
this had been taken by assault, the covered way had been mined,
an explosion had shattered the redoubts, those of the garrison
who had endeavoured to make a <i>sortie</i> lay huddled on the
upthrown heaps of fresh earth. Here and there a turban showed
among the Christian uniforms. Mariassy made the sign of the Cross
on his breast, Horvath feared that he would drop from his horse
and flung out a hand to steady him, but it was Mariassy who was
the first to spring out of the saddle and mount the ruined
<i>glacis.</i></p>

<p>The Turks had taken Titul, massacred the garrison, dismantled
the fort and prudently withdrawn into Bosnia.</p>

<p>Their fireballs, cast contemptuously behind in their march,
yet smirched the distance with flame, and their drums beat in
far-off fury.</p>

<p>"It was only what was to be expected," grumbled Horvath,
picking his way among the dead bodies. "Why did the women remain
so near the seat of war?"</p>

<p>He sent up two of his hussars to pull down the cursed Crescent
that drooped upon the highest tower and trample it in the mud.
The sunlight poured unmercifully down through the apertures of
the fort and showed the heaped corpses of the Christian
women&mdash;some strangled, some with arrows in their
breasts.</p>

<p>Horvath felt his limbs tremble, the dust sting his eyes and a
rising sickness in his heart. He dared not turn to Mariassy, but
presently saw him, stumbling up a twist of steps and
followed.</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear Mariassy, this were best left to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mariassy did not hear, he continued to mount the stairs, his
drawn sword in his hand, his face inhuman. Horvath did not doubt
that he was already insane. Controlling his own nausea, Horvath
helped in the search for Marie Batthyany, but among the dead,
overtaken in corners, struck down behind doors, flung from
windows, was none so lovely as she...</p>

<p>"Look up," said Horvath, "maybe she has escaped, maybe she was
not here, but in good keeping."</p>

<p>A young officer came running after them, panting up the
stairs. He had found a woman, alive, hidden in one of the
closets, alive and uninjured, shut away from all the carnage. He
spoke as if he had beheld a miracle, his eyes were
frightened.</p>

<p>Mariassy reeled against the wall, his scabbard jangled on the
ground.</p>

<p>From every part of the fort rose the groans and blasphemies of
the Hungarians as they turned over the dead women and children.
Already graves were being dug in the earth upheaved by the
explosion. The sun seemed to stride forward into the centre of
the heavens, so suddenly bright it became.</p>

<p>As if he conducted a blind man Horvath led Mariassy, to where
the young Captain guided them.</p>

<p>The small closet had belonged to the Governor of Titul. It was
untouched, the tapestry hung precise, the furniture was in order.
On the bureau was the Governor's inkhorn and standish, even his
lorgnette, there were jasmine and carnations in a glass; an inner
door stood open on to the small bedchamber of the murdered
General&mdash;he had been one of the first they had found, shot
in the dark ditch. On a low chair sat Marie Batthyany, her long
tresses of saffron yellow were disordered, her fingers
intertwined in an attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>At sight of her Mariassy moved from Horvath's support like one
newly restored to life, incapable of speech. He cast himself on
his knees beside her and pressed his tears and his kisses on her
clasped hands.</p>

<p>She stared down at his fallen black locks, she too seemed to
find it impossible to say a word.</p>

<p>Horvath, as an excuse not to break in on this meeting, so
touching and terrible, inspected the two rooms, the young Captain
accompanying him, and pointed out that these apartments alone had
been spared of the entire fort. The bed had been slept in though
the coverlet was drawn over the disorder; in a corner of the
room, as if hastily pushed out of sight, were table appointments,
glasses, dishes, fruit, bread, sweetmeats, hidden under a
napkin.</p>

<p>"So, the Governor slept and supped here," remarked Horvath,
"but I thought the fort had fallen last night."</p>

<p>"'Tis clear," shuddered the Captain, "from the bodies already
cold and stiffening, that it was so."</p>

<p>To wash his soul of horror Horvath leaned from the window. The
sky was pellucid blue and simple as a faery tale, the heavy
vapours of the night hung low and purple on the horizon, it was
good to gaze from the fort of Titul at the passive purity of
those meek heavens.</p>

<p>When he returned to the closet he found the lovers had risen.
Marie Batthyany lay in the arms of Mariassy.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that she could give an account of
her escape, but Horvath, pricked by curiosity, asked how she had
contrived so extraordinary a deliverance.</p>

<p>"Are all gone?" she murmured. Her eyes were closed, but her
cheeks were neither sunk nor pale.</p>

<p>"The Turks are gone," said Horvath, "and the Christians...Put
a veil over her face, Matthias, and let us carry her out of this
accursed place so that she may not see what she passes."</p>

<p>But Marie Batthyany clung to her lover, she had no courage to
leave the closet where all was clean and fresh, even perfumed by
the fine flowers in the glass, she was afraid of smelling blood,
of hearing perhaps a groan. She began to kiss his dark cheek
softly, his beautiful mouth, begging him to spare her this
pain.</p>

<p>"When did these dogs leave?" demanded Horvath.</p>

<p>"Last night," whispered Marie Batthyany. "I have been here so
long, crouching in the dark."</p>

<p>Mariassy soothed her with passionate solicitude. Horvath
remembered the fireballs and the drums, not an hour's march away
when they had come up. He looked at the young Captain who glanced
aside. Horvath told him to go and see if some litter could be
contrived for Marie Batthyany.</p>

<p>"Shall we take her to Zenta, Matthias?"</p>

<p>The young woman declared that she could ride, if a horse could
be found, or even mount behind Mariassy, so that she got to
safety. She had left her lover's arms and stood, slim and
vigorous, in the sunlight by the window, a sudden breeze, quick
as a hunted bird, troubled her hair, lifted the heavy locks. She
looked at Horvath with a deeper attention than she had given her
lover.</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever, Major Horvath, of what happened.
When the assault began I fled here, I rushed to the bed and hid
myself under the coverlets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Horvath, "that is why it was pulled about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and then, as I suppose, I must have fainted, the noise
was so horrible, the expectation so fearful&mdash;I prayed to
God, and I think He struck me senseless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need, Countess," interrupted Horvath, "to justify yourself
to me."</p>

<p>"Justify?" cried Mariassy, fiercely and bewildered.</p>

<p>"He thinks," put in Marie Batthyany swiftly, "that I should
not be the one Christian alive, but I cannot help my cowardice,
if I had not been senseless I had run out to die with them."</p>

<p>"Madame," asked Horvath, "how do you know all are slain? We
never said so. But it is true, even the little children..." He
turned to the young Captain. "Give me what lies beneath the
bureau."</p>

<p>This was a crucifix of silver-gilt, it had been defaced and
twisted; it seemed stamped on by a heavy heel. Above the bureau
still showed the nail from which it had been wrenched.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Mariassy, looking at the ruined symbol
in the fine steady hand of Horvath. "If no one entered here, how
was this done?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Marie Batthyany, "I have never seen it
before."</p>

<p>"Colonel," Horvath spoke formally, "I will make what order I
can before you bring out your lady."</p>

<p>He left, followed by the young Captain; both of them looked
sombrely on the ground as they descended the twist of stairs.</p>

<p>"Mariassy is the unluckiest of men," said Horvath gloomily.
"That one woman&mdash;of all&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Captain protested at the hinted suggestion, his frightened
voice was very low.</p>

<p>"'Tis not possible for a Christian woman, and all these dead
without her very door. Besides, who would have had the power
to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Only one&mdash;he whom we call the Grand Signor&mdash;Kara
Mustapha."</p>

<p>The young Captain straightened himself against the wall like
one bedazzled and sick to retching.</p>

<p>"If a woman," he stammered, "had the misfortune to please a
dog like Mustapha, would he not take her with him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Horvath, "he would despise her too much."</p>

<p>He touched his sword, the lines were deep round his arched
upper lip, the fatigue of the long night ride seemed to have
suddenly affected him, he moved slowly.</p>

<p>"If she in any way belonged to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matthias Mariassy brought out of Titul the only survivor of
the Turkish massacre, she had wrapped a square of lawn over her
face, her shoulders were covered by the great-coat of the late
governor, her silk dress showed beneath in pale gleams, she
leaned heavily on her lover's arm.</p>

<p>There was silence among the Hungarians, all looked away; those
burying the dead crossed themselves, the air seemed full of
menace. Mariassy, with the woman on his arm, peered about him
with narrowed, tired eyes.</p>

<p>"No one," he said, "seems to rejoice with me in my good
fortune."</p>

<p>His glance fell on a group of officers standing near; despite
the heat of the day they were sipping brandy from their metal
flasks. He addressed them.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, by the grace of God, the Countess Marie Batthyany
is safe."</p>

<p>The officers saluted, their faces were expressionless. One of
them, an engineer, said:</p>

<p>"My Colonel, it will be impossible to cleanse or repair the
fort, shall we not blow it up?"</p>

<p>"Do so at once," said Mariassy.</p>

<p>Marie Batthyany took off her lawn veil and stared about her.
She was, without dispute, a most beautiful woman, no one ever
denied that, and all the silent men who looked at her felt
something pressing on their hearts.</p>

<p>Mariassy seemed to wonder at the stillness. Horvath had his
<i>vinaigrette</i> to his distended nostrils as if overcome by
the fumes of death.</p>

<p>"Shall I take the Countess to safety, my Colonel," he
demanded, "while you pursue the Grand Signor?" He tried to smile.
"Remember your wager&mdash;the 'Eye of War' from his turban,
well, here is your chance to obtain it."</p>

<p>The woman startled against her betrothed as if she had been
menaced; she would not be parted from him, she declared, he and
only he should take her to Zenta. Mariassy conceded to her
fears.</p>

<p>The Hungarians laid the mine beneath the ruined fort. Nothing
but fire could purge Titul, and they had found it impossible to
bury all the dead.</p>

<p>While the Italian engineers worked the Hungarians rested
themselves and their horses, all were silent.</p>

<p>The Countess Marie Batthyany waited under a tree by a dry
well. She appeared to be absorbed in the attentions of her
betrothed, but often she cast a sidelong, furtive glance at
Horvath.</p>

<p>By noon all was ready for departure. A quiet soft-paced Arab
was brought for Marie Batthyany, it belonged to a young ensign
who would lead him gently through the heat. The horse snorted and
trampled.</p>

<p>Horvath helped her to mount and, as she sprang into the
saddle, a flash of coloured light fell from her bosom laces to
the well-trodden ground, Horvath put his foot on it, when
Mariassy's head was turned he picked it up. In his palm
scintillated the famous yellow diamond, the "Eye of War" from the
front of Kara Mustapha's turban.</p>

<p>In this he saw the needed proof of his suspicions and he was
immediately resolved.</p>

<p>"Colonel, the Countess says she left some papers on the
Governor's bureau. I have offered to send for them, but she will
have no hand but yours touch them&mdash;likely they are your
letters to her."</p>

<p>The woman swung round in the saddle with a denial of this lie
on her lips, but the dark soldier glanced at her, then at his
loosely-closed fingers through which shot a baleful gleam. And
she was terribly silent.</p>

<p>"Did I not so understand your meaning, Countess?"</p>

<p>Rigid with fear she obeyed his unspoken commands. She
entreated Mariassy to return to the fort for her love-letters.
Never before had she been parted from them, only he must touch
them; he was pleased to obey so delicate a whim.</p>

<p>Horvath swung into the saddle and sat his horse beside the
Countess Marie Batthyany. All the soldiers watched Mariassy going
slowly over the rough ground towards the ruined fort; a freshet
of air stirred his black locks and his white plumes, he held
himself very erect and easy, yet like a man who is tired; once he
passed his hand across his eyes, they could hear the sound of his
spurs and his sword on the <i>debris.</i> He disappeared into the
distant fort.</p>

<p>Horvath called up the captain of engineers.</p>

<p>"Now spring the mine!" he said.</p>

<p>The two men looked into each other's eyes, they understood
each other perfectly.</p>

<p>The engineer turned away to give his orders, the woman would
have fallen forward on her horse had not Horvath supported her
firmly.</p>

<p>"Why this?" she stammered stupidly.</p>

<p>"Because he was my friend, Madame."</p>

<p>With a 'deep roar and a bursting flash Titul blazed into the
air, a shower of dust and splinters descended on the Hungarians.
Many of them prayed.</p>

<p>When the veil of smoke and dust had passed Horvath still sat
erect amongst his men. He was now in command of the regiment. In
gouts of fire Titul was consumed.</p>

<p>"Have the goodness, Madame, to descend and stand by that
tree."</p>

<p>She slipped out of the saddle and was on her knees beside his
horse.</p>

<p>"I was frightened. I did it to save my life."</p>

<p>"You took something besides your life." He showed her the gem,
dancing with light on his palm. "You take payment, you, a
Christian, a Batthyany, betrothed to Matthias Mariassy. There's
only one thing possible, but I do not wish you to suffer."</p>

<p>There was no truer shot or one who had a steadier hand than
himself. He brought out his petronel, she suddenly fell from her
knees prone on to her side insensible on the ground.</p>

<p>It seemed a blasphemy to destroy anything so beautiful, but
the silence about him urged it, the sound of the pistol was like
a salvo fired for Mariassy devoured in the storming flames of
Titul which, with heat and glare, seemed to absorb the whole
landscape and the rich sweetness of the summer.</p>

<p>Again the lawn veil was laid over the face of Marie Batthyany;
it did not take long for them to hide her for ever in a grave by
the gaunt tree, the rough mound would soon be covered with weeds
and thistles.</p>

<p>Horvath addressed his men.</p>

<p>"It is to be regretted that we did not find one Christian
woman left alive in Titul. Not one. It is to be regretted that
Colonel Mariassy was slain by a chance grenade left in the fort.
No one will imagine anything else. Gentlemen, I commend to you
the honour of Hungary."</p>

<p>They rode slowly back to Zenta through the August warmth, the
"Eye of War" burned in the war glove of Ferdinand Horvath; he
remembered his wager. He felt the hard gem there while he gave
his report to Lorraine, anguished in his yellow-leather chair,
dying, choking with his quinsy.</p>

<p>"It is to be regretted, my General."</p>

<p>"It is greatly to be regretted, Colonel Horvath. But I hope to
have my revenge. Prince Eugene is preparing to meet the Grand
Signor when he crosses the Danube&mdash;all the Christian
women!"...Lorraine moved his sick head on the pillows and
fainted.</p>

<p>When the Turks passed the Teisse Colonel Howarth and his
Hungarians were among the first troops to oppose them. That day
twenty thousand of the Infidel were left dead on the field, ten
thousand were drowned. This was not enough for Horvath. Hacking
his way through the Spahis he tore down the green Ottoman flag
and dragged the Grand Signor from his litter; the Turks shrieking
"Aman! Aman!" abandoned their general; the Hungarian hussars,
their smoked faces rigid, galloped up round their colonel.</p>

<p>With cries of delight the Christian slew the Mussulman.</p>

<p>Before he cast the bloody head of the Grand Signor into the
waters of the Teisse, Horvath thrust the yellow diamond into the
torn turban that was twisted round the gashed forehead. He
watched the tormented waters close over the glaring face, and the
<i>oculus belli</i> flash for the last time among the drowned
men.</p>

<p>He believed that Matthias Mariassy would be well content with
him. His pleasing face wore a satisfied expression as he galloped
away from the river banks into the active clamour of the
battle.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. A GROUP IN PORCELAIN<br>
(HUSBAND, WIFE, AND LOVER)</h2>

<p class="first">
THE gilt crook knotted with silver ribbons fell from the satin
chair as M. de Penthièvre moved and sighed. Mlle. de Alexandre,
in the silk extravagances of a toy shepherdess, gazing at herself
in the mirror wreathed with roses and cupidons, did not notice
the sigh nor the glance of profound disillusion that M. de
Penthièvre gave her languishing charms of fashionable ballet
dancer. When she did look at him his perfect courtesy had
concealed his weariness. Though he was only twenty-five his
handsome face was already a mask that smilingly concealed his
infinite boredom with his luxurious existence.</p>

<p>The age was cynic and exhausted, voluptuous frivolities barely
disguised a universal languor and decay; those, who, like M. de
Penthièvre, had some intelligence, could see no object in
life.</p>

<p>Mlle. de Alexandre caressed him in vain; she asked him to
admire her <i>gauze gown</i> and he admired it as he would have
admired a <i>porcelain de saxe,</i> without enthusiasm or
interest; he was so tired of porcelains and ballet dancers, of
ribbons and pearls and perfumes of lilies and roses set in rococo
vases or placed, in stiff rosettes, in powdered curls.</p>

<p>He was, above all, tired of Mlle. de Alexandre.</p>

<p>Yet he but exchanged one boudoir for another, and leaving the
dancer went to that great lady, Madame de Sourdeau, whose lover
he had been for five years.</p>

<p>And there, icily, he watched her idleness; eh, but life was
stale!</p>

<p>Madame de Sourdeau was at her <i>toilette;</i> while her
pomaded curls were dressed a black page amused her by teasing a
scarlet parakeet, an abbe read some love verses, and the chamber
woman unpacked slippers and feathers from boxes with elegant
stripes.</p>

<p>"Are you coming to the Opera, Andre?" asked Madame de
Sourdeau. Oddly enough, she still loved him, and his profound
indifference to their intrigue was like a chill miasma in the
warm extravagance of the boudoir.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre said, No, that night he would not go to the
Opera.</p>

<p>The lady adjusted, with bleached fingers, a patch on her
powdered face.</p>

<p>"What, then, are you going to do?"</p>

<p>It was a question that she should never have asked; it showed
that she was losing her lightness of touch, a fatal error.</p>

<p>"How can one answer?" he replied. He could not avoid his own
reflection in the cool mirror opposite, his pale face, his dark
eyes, his powdered curls, his diamonds and satins in pastel
tints, his elegance of aristocrat and courtier; this image seemed
to him the epitome of ineptitude, but he had not the energy to
move from the delicate <i>bergère</i> where he sat.</p>

<p>Madame de Sourdeau was ten years older than her lover and had
always held him tightly despite, or perhaps because of, his
profound indifference. She regarded him coolly and wondered if
Mlle. de Alexandre was a serious rival; she reminded him that
this dancer was performing at the Opera to-night.</p>

<p>"You should come to see her, Andre, you who admire her so
much," and Madame de Sourdeau clasped a cascade of diamonds round
her throat. This made a glitter in the candles, a glitter that
was reflected in all the wanton mirrors.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre smiled, seeing her meaning and not deigning
to argue with it. He had noticed of late that she was jealous;
with languid compliments he excused himself and left her and went
out into the streets of Paris where an autumn wind blew the
rotting leaves from the tall trees in the gardens of the dark
houses.</p>

<p>Having broken all his engagements and avoided all his
acquaintances, he had nothing to do and could think of nothing
that he wished to do. He sauntered along the chill streets in a
deep melancholy and a dangerous idleness, despising himself and
finding all the world odious.</p>

<p>By force of habit he turned towards the Palais Royal and the
doors of a gambling club where he was sure to find some
companions of his own rank and age; cards were less wearisome
than women, and here one could drink, a pretence of excitement, a
pretence of oblivion, at least.</p>

<p>As he was about to enter these doors someone timidly plucked
at his cloak.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Monseigneur, but if I could speak to you?" He thought
it a beggar, and drew haughtily away, but the man continued
earnestly:</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Duc, just a word or two, on a serious
matter?"</p>

<p>"You know me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur le Duc&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it is surprising that you wish to speak to me on a
serious matter."</p>

<p>"It is true, however, that I do wish to do so,
Monseigneur."</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre paused; in the twilight he could just discern
the speaker to be an elderly man, decently dressed.</p>

<p>"I have been," continued this person very respectfully, "to
Monseigneur's house at Auteuil, I have waited in the ante-chamber
of Mlle. Alexandre, and at last I have come here in the hope of
finding Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"You have taken some trouble at least," smiled M. de
Penthièvre, rather amused by this distraction just when he was in
need of distraction. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur does not know me, but I am in the service of
Monseigneur&mdash;I am Fayard, the major-domo of the Hotel de
Penthièvre."</p>

<p>"The devil you are; well, my good Fayard, of course I remember
you perfectly. I believe your family was always very devoted to
mine."</p>

<p>"That is precisely why I am here, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Come inside," said the young Duke indifferently, "and tell me
what you have to say."</p>

<p>He led the way into the bright corridors of the club and into
a private room where a fire burnt and the candles were lit. He
recalled Fayard, when he was a boy, a child, in the
<i>chateau</i> in Touraine, in Paris, in his father's service.
Yes, he had been fond of Fayard, though of course he had
forgotten him, as one did forget&mdash;everything.</p>

<p>He seated himself and took off his gauntlets, his hat, his
cloak, while Fayard stood humbly and bare-headed before him; an
elderly man, Fayard, with a shrewd, kindly face, that seemed now
distressed and pallid. Odd for him to come after his master like
this, but the Duke was too disinterested to be astonished.</p>

<p>"If it is to do with my business affairs, M. de Mailly would
have seen you," he remarked, naming the man who administered his
great wealth and his vast estates.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, it has nothing to do with business. Monsieur
l'Intendant conducts the affairs of Monseigneur perfectly."</p>

<p><i>"Eh bien,</i> then?"</p>

<p>Some beautiful apples were in a dish on the side-table and M.
de Penthièvre took one idly up in his long fine fingers.</p>

<p>The old servant wiped his forehead furtively and gave an
agonised glance at the beautiful face of his master, a face so
young and yet so impassive.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur is never at his hotel."</p>

<p>"No. There is no occasion, Fayard."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur has been married two years."</p>

<p>"Is it as long as that, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"Precisely two years, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre smiled.</p>

<p>"You have a good memory, Fayard."</p>

<p>"During those two years Madame la Duchesse has lived alone in
the Hotel de Penthièvre&mdash;save when Monseigneur has taken her
to the Tuileries or Versailles."</p>

<p>"It is correct, Fayard, to say that I have allowed Madame la
Duchesse the enjoyment of my hotel without troubling her with my
presence&mdash;but alone? My domestics are in adequate numbers.
Madame has her friends." The young man was amused; he smiled
again.</p>

<p>"My meaning, Monseigneur, was that Madame has
lived&mdash;since her marriage&mdash;without her husband."</p>

<p>"Eh, <i>mon Dieu,</i> a husband!"</p>

<p>Fayard trembled before this light laugh, but bowed.</p>

<p>"Precisely, Monseigneur. What I have to say is so
extraordinarily difficult&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It shall be pardoned, Fayard. You are a good fellow. I
remember you quite well&mdash;you served my father
diligently."</p>

<p>"I wish also to serve Monseigneur diligently. I am an old man,
an old servant. Will what I have to say indeed be pardoned?"</p>

<p>"Speak," smiled the Duke.</p>

<p>Fayard, still standing respectfully, seemed to consider a
second, as if gathering together his forces, then said earnestly,
even desperately:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur has not perhaps thought much of Madame la
Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"Why should I, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"I have lived with her for two years, Monsieur le Duc, I know
her very well. I beg Monseigneur to condescend to remember that
she is only seventeen in this November, that he married her when
she left the convent, that when she came to Paris she knew
nothing whatever of the world."</p>

<p>"But in two years she has learnt something, eh, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I fear she has learnt too much."</p>

<p>After the slightest pause M. de Penthièvre replied
negligently:</p>

<p>"I do not think that possible; Madame must learn&mdash;all
there is to know&mdash;of the world in which she must live. She
is charming and pretty&mdash;a little provincial, no doubt, but
that fault can be repaired and it is my wish that she should
enjoy herself while she has the capacity to do so."</p>

<p>He then paused again for the fraction of a second, and looking
at his servant with slightly narrowed eyes, added:</p>

<p>"I think it very strange that you should have told me
this&mdash;you, Fayard, must know the usual progress of a
<i>mariage de convenance."</i></p>

<p>"It is because of that I am here, Monseigneur. I talk of a
child&mdash;and a child entrusted to you, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>The accents of the servant were gone; it was a man talking to
a man, an old man talking to a young man; but M. de Penthièvre
did not seem to resent this. He answered quietly:</p>

<p>"You have become attached to Madame la Duchesse, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monseigneur, I have even, if Monsieur le Duc will pardon
me, presumed to forget the differences in our positions and to
pity, to pity very greatly, Madame la Duchesse."</p>

<p>Even at this M. de Penthièvre continued to smile as if he
considered any impertinence from his servant to himself
impossible, as if this was all amusing and rather foolish. There
was no change in his fine, cool face; yet he did not dismiss
Fayard nor even glance at the clock, and Fayard took courage from
this and from the recollection of the days when this grand
gentleman had been a little boy riding on his shoulders through
the <i>allies</i> of the park on the banks of the Loire.</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse is much admired, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"So one would suppose, Fayard."</p>

<p>"Very young, very ignorant,
admired&mdash;alone&mdash;Monseigneur has thought about it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur will think about it now?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>Fayard was silent. The young Duke looked into the fire, his
brows slightly raised, his lips faintly smiling, his whole figure
languid.</p>

<p>"My poor Fayard, you waste your time."</p>

<p>"It is possible, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"And mine, Fayard."</p>

<p>The servant bowed.</p>

<p>"But Monseigneur has wasted so much already&mdash;and yet not
much on Madame la Duchesse."</p>

<p>"That is true, Fayard. But what can I do for Madame la
Duchesse? She has my name, my estate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if she should&mdash;slight&mdash;one and squander the
other, Monsieur le Duc?"</p>

<p><i>"Eh bien,</i> it is all in the <i>mode!"</i></p>

<p>He laughed, with intense disillusion. The servant eyed him,
and said dryly:</p>

<p>"Her lover is M. Saint Mexme."</p>

<p>The apple slid out of the Duke's fingers and rolled across the
floor, but he answered, without a change of tone:</p>

<p>"She has shown good taste."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, he is also very young."</p>

<p>"And charming, don't you think, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"They are very much in earnest, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"That is a pity, Fayard."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, it is all so much a pity."</p>

<p>"The conclusion of all the philosophers, Fayard!"</p>

<p>"What I had to say did not surprise Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"Surprise? I suppose I could have found it out for myself had
I wished, Fayard. But it did not occur to me to inquire into the
affairs of Madame la Duchesse." He smiled, looking into the pale,
distressed face of the servant. "My good Fayard, I am afraid that
the air of Paris does not agree with you, you appear quite
discomposed and ill."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Monseigneur will consider that I have been, and my
father before me, greatly attached to his illustrious house, of
which he is the last&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The last, <i>Dieu merci!"</i></p>

<p>"It has been a very noble house, a great house of soldiers,
statesmen, Monsieur le Duc, of brave men and pure women&mdash;all
for France."</p>

<p>"Those days are past, Fayard. For war and statecraft we have
peace and politics. One amuses oneself&mdash;if one can."</p>

<p>"But there is still France."</p>

<p>"Why do you remind me of France, Fayard?" M. de Penthièvre
turned in his seat slightly.</p>

<p>"When I said France, Monseigneur, I meant chivalry."</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien,</i> Fayard?"</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse has not come to this easily, Monseigneur,
there have been tears and prayers, and torments and bewilderments
and great misery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"My daughter, Margot, has the honour to be <i>femme de
chambre</i> to Madame la Duchesse, and to love her,
Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"She seems lacking in discretion&mdash;your Margot."</p>

<p>"Only to me. Monseigneur will perhaps forgive our great
presumption when he considers that Madame la Duchesse had no one
to care for her&mdash;in all Paris. Madame came from the convent
not knowing what marriage meant, expecting to live with
Monseigneur, anxious to please him, timid and sensitive, not
knowing of Madame de Sourdeau, not knowing anything."</p>

<p>"But now," remarked the young Duke quietly, "she knows a
little more. Nor is she quite alone&mdash;there is M. de Saint
Mexme to instruct her in Paris manners."</p>

<p>At this a fine thin colour overspread the servant's pale face.
He advanced a step and said firmly:</p>

<p>"Not being a great noble, Monseigneur, nor even a gentleman, I
could not help pitying this young girl, sacrificed to a mockery
of marriage, abandoned to the corruptions of Paris, left without
defence in this intolerable position&mdash;I could not help
feeling remorse and shame&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre looked at him with the faintest shade of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Did you, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, remorse and shame for you, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"You're not afraid of me, Fayard?"</p>

<p>"No, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"That's odd, Fayard," mused the young Duke. "It's all odd, is
it not? And quite useless."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Monsieur le Duc."</p>

<p>"Pray do not be. By to-morrow I shall have forgotten
everything."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur has asked if I am afraid of him and I have said
no. With all respect, a time is coming when men like myself will
never be afraid of men like you, Monsieur le Duc; things are
changing, on all sides one hears that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have thought so too."</p>

<p>"You have power of life and death over me and mine now,
Monseigneur," continued the servant quietly, "but that will not
long be so&mdash;but always some power you will have, for I have
always loved your house."</p>

<p>"Have you, Fayard&mdash;loved?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre looked at him with curiosity. The servant
bowed and added:</p>

<p>"I will leave Monseigneur to his amusements."</p>

<p>"Good night, Fayard."</p>

<p>Fayard buttoned his cloak, moved to the door and bowed
again.</p>

<p>"M. de Saint Mexme is received to-night at the Hotel de
Penthièvre by Madame la Duchesse&mdash;alone&mdash;" The young
Duke rose.</p>

<p>"For the first time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are well informed of the progress of this affair."</p>

<p>"Monseigneur wears a sword."</p>

<p>"But not to annoy children at their play&mdash;let them enjoy
themselves, Fayard, since we are so near this <i>débâcle</i> of
which you speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They will not enjoy themselves to-night."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked M. de Penthièvre slowly.</p>

<p>"Because I have not relied only on Monsieur le Duc to protect
the honour of Madame la Duchesse."</p>

<p>At this the young man was more roused than he had been since
the beginning of the interview.</p>

<p>"What have you done?" he demanded haughtily.</p>

<p>"I have asked M. de Lavardin, the brother of Madame, to come
to the Hotel de Penthièvre to-night. M. de Lavardin is of the
<i>noblesse de province,</i> is he not, Monsieur le Duc? He has
ideas different from those of Monseigneur."</p>

<p>"Fayard, you are a villain."</p>

<p>"M. de Lavardin hoped his sister would be what she has never
been&mdash;your wife, Monseigneur, with children to inherit your
honours, which she will never have&mdash;when he sees what he
will see to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre interrupted:</p>

<p>"What will he do? Eh?"</p>

<p>"He will make a scandal, an open scandal. He will very likely
kill M. de Saint Mexme."</p>

<p>The young Duke was silent a second, then said coolly:</p>

<p>"He certainly has no tact nor finesse&mdash;you are a rogue,
Fayard, to have done this. I shall have you severely
punished."</p>

<p>"Anything else, Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else. The affair is between M. de Lavardin and M. de
Saint Mexme. I am not interested in either."</p>

<p>"Nor in Madame la Duchesse?"</p>

<p>"Madame la Duchesse, like everyone else, Fayard, must pay for
her experiences. I shall give her the satisfaction of seeing you
thrashed, at least&mdash;and the hint to be more discreet with
her <i>femme de chambre</i><i>&mdash;</i><i>she</i> shall learn
in time to conduct an affair without a <i>fracas."</i></p>

<p>The servant, very pale now, answered simply "Yes, she will
learn, that is what is so bad, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre picked up his cloak and hat; the servant had
one more thing to say:</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Duc will remember his toast at the betrothal
fête?&mdash;to Madelon&mdash;and all the Graces '? She did
possess them once, Monseigneur."</p>

<p>Then he was gone.</p>

<p>Now M. de Penthièvre looked at the clock. Seven. The fellow
had talked a long time, yet still there was a great deal of the
evening to get through. Lavardin would go to-night, he was in
Paris on one of his brief visits, and that manner of man; he had
quarrelled with him, he believed, but one forgot; at least he
disliked him, a provincial and a bore. Really it had been a
<i>misalliance,</i> but then the dowry had been tempting; Madame
de Sourdeau had been expensive. De Saint Mexme was a fool, too,
fresh from Saint Cyr; neither would know how to manage the
situation. But what did it matter?</p>

<p>It was odd, all of it. Fayard, now, how intelligently he had
spoken, with what courage and feeling. Very likely, if the
<i>débâcle</i> came, Fayard would rise in the new order; he had
spoken of that, everyone did now, even at Court, even nobles like
M. Lafayette talked of a coming change, perhaps of a revolution
like those savages in America were indulging in. Eh, Fayard, with
these ideas, it was amusing!</p>

<p>Of course, something must be done with Fayard, a <i>lettre de
cachet,</i> the Bastille, or merely a flogging and a
dismissal?</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre went into the large room where some other
young men were gambling and yawning, oh, la, everywhere yawning!
M. de Hauterive lost his snuff-box set with brilliants to M. de
Penthièvre; inside the lid was the miniature of a pretty young
woman with the legend, "<i>Souviens-toi</i>." M. de Penthièvre
tossed the box back, he felt slightly nauseated; he thought it a
physical feeling and blamed the wine, which was horribly new; and
the air, which was unutterably stale.</p>

<p>At last the clock struck midnight&mdash;at last.</p>

<p>"<i>Souviens-toi</i>"&mdash;why had Fayard reminded him of the
betrothal toast&mdash;"Madelon&mdash;and all the Graces?"</p>

<p>He remembered her, so shy and forlorn, fifteen years old, in
her huge brocade skirts and bodice laced with diamonds. "It
weighs more than a cuirass, that dress," her brother had said,
"and she has worn it for hours."</p>

<p>All the Graces&mdash;grace of youth, grace of loveliness,
grace of innocence&mdash;</p>

<p>But after to-night?</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre left the gambling hell and came into the
streets; cold, dull weather with a fine rain falling on the
litter of the deserted streets.</p>

<p>He turned to the Hotel de Penthièvre; dark and large and grim
the black bulk of his house rose into the cloudy night.</p>

<p>He rang the bell at the gates and the porter came, sleepy,
alarmed, and would have refused him admission.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?" M. de Penthièvre lifted his hat. "Is it
so long since I was here?"</p>

<p>"Eh, no, Monseigneur," stammered the terrified porter, "only a
year&mdash;"</p>

<p>A year, and then only for a few hours when he had come to
fetch her to Versailles.</p>

<p>The porter scrambled across the courtyard to open the doors of
the mansion; clangour of bells and shouting and running of
domestics; M. de Penthièvre hushed all this clamour.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,</i> may a man not come into his own house
without this?" He mounted the vast stairs followed by a page with
a girandole of candles. "Where are the apartments of Madame la
Duchesse?"</p>

<p>He was amused to see that all the servants looked frightened,
pale and frightened; the page took him to his wife's apartments,
and he entered the ante-chamber.</p>

<p>Here he glanced round curiously; he had never entered these
rooms since they had been furnished for his bride. He was not
impressed; they were exactly like the rooms of any other
woman&mdash;satin, <i>porcelain de saxe,</i> gilded cupidons,
crystal lustres...</p>

<p>He dismissed the page; he told him to send all the servants to
bed. Fayard had not appeared; he wondered a little about
Fayard.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre knocked on the inner door after carefully
taking off his cloak, hat and gloves, that were slightly wet, and
mechanically adjusting his cravat, ruffles, and hair in one of
the tiresome little mirrors he detested.</p>

<p>He had to knock several times before the <i>femme de
chambre,</i> who appeared to have hastily dressed, opened
cautiously the door. This would be Margot, Fayard's daughter, not
quite the type of <i>soubrette</i> he knew so well, a serious
girl&mdash;for Paris.</p>

<p>She appeared terrified beyond measure, but he gently put her
aside and entered the sparkling little boudoir like that of Mlle.
Alexandre, of Madame de Sourdeau.</p>

<p>"Is your mistress awake?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, she has been asleep&mdash;for hours."</p>

<p>"Will you wake her, please? I want to speak to her."</p>

<p>"But, Monseigneur, at this hour of the night! Madame will be
terrified&mdash;oh, but Monsieur le Duc will wait till the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Such," he replied, "is not my custom. It is Margot, Fayard's
daughter, is it not? Will you announce me to Madame?"</p>

<p>She had no choice, but quite pallid with alarm knocked on the
door of the bedchamber. Immediately a frightened voice
answered:</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Not, I think, asleep, Madame la Duchesse," remarked M. de
Penthièvre. "Take in some candles, Margot."</p>

<p>The girl opened the door, holding a cluster of wax lights,
hastily lit, in her left hand, and announced in sinking
tones:</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Duc, Madame."</p>

<p>"Leave the candles," said he, entering; then, as Margot placed
these on the console, "Now you may return to bed."</p>

<p>The young Duchess sat up in bed under a grand imperial of
straw-coloured silk, and when she saw who it was who entered she
instinctively gathered the elegant rosy quilt and the fine lawn
sheets up to her chin with a cry of complete dismay.</p>

<p>"It is permitted&mdash;before one's husband," smiled M. de
Penthièvre, "to appear in <i>déshabillé."</i> He looked with a
faint curiosity about the room. "Is this to your taste? For
me&mdash;a little ordinary."</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre could not reply. She sat huddled under
the coquettish canopy, holding the bedclothes to her chin, her
curls escaping from her muslin cap and her small round face
distorted with alarm. He had never seen her save in a <i>robe de
parade,</i> and had not realised how very delicate and slight she
was, nor how pretty without her rouge and pomade; prettier, he
thought idly, than Mlle. Alexandre, but still extremely
unsophisticated.</p>

<p>He went round the room, lighting the candles, hoping she would
recover her composure. Finding a nég<i>ligé</i> of swansdown and
lace and a pair of slippers, he brought these to the bed and
suggested she should rise and put them on.</p>

<p>"But why?" she stammered, quivering with fright. "Why are you
here, Monseigneur? Have pity on me, I implore you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked her with cool serenity.</p>

<p>"Eh, one does not talk like that, Madame, that is for the
theatre! Will you please rise? If I embarrass you I will remain
here till you are ready."</p>

<p>He seated himself on the brocade stool at the foot of the bed
so that he could not see her. Her trembling voice came from
behind him:</p>

<p>"If Monseigneur would explain? I am so bewildered, so
alarmed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Occasionally one likes to see one's wife," he answered. "My
dear&mdash;" he wanted to use her name and had forgotten it, then
it came into his mind with the memory of the toast,
"Madelon&mdash;and all the Graces"&mdash;"my dear Madelon, it
occurred to me to inquire if everything was to your liking here;
if the air of Paris agreed with you, if the house was run to your
taste."</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre came round the bed; she was dressed in
robe and slippers, and had put over the light lace and gauze a
white cashmere Andalusian shawl which concealed her effectively
from throat to ankles&mdash;at which detail he smiled, and
rising, invited her to a chair. They sat facing each other, at
the end of the bed, she quite rigid with fright.</p>

<p>"You have found Paris agreeable?" he asked pleasantly. "You
have diverted yourself? At first, perhaps, you felt a
little&mdash;rustic&mdash;but that, by now, should have worn
off."</p>

<p>He wondered if she had Saint Mexme concealed anywhere in the
room. Personally, he had always been too adroit to be involved in
any of these comedy situations, but he knew they did occur, and
young Saint Mexme was the type of youth to find himself in some
<i>opera bouffe</i> position, thrust cramped into a wardrobe or
stifling behind curtains. There were both wardrobes and curtains
well in view; M. de Penthièvre glanced at all with a languid
interest.</p>

<p>"If I were you," he remarked, "I should change these
furnishings, they seem to me very insipid&mdash;a fair woman
should have more brilliant colours&mdash;rose or
turquoise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The room is very well," she replied faintly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think so because you have not seen many others.
Believe me, a gayer decoration would set off your beauty better
and raise your spirits&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am," she murmured, "well enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You appear, on the contrary, Madame," he smiled, "to be
extremely discomposed and languid&mdash;please do me the honour
to believe that I should never put you in a false
position&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Monseigneur; ah, you alarm me so!"</p>

<p>"I mean that you may trust me not to cause you any agitation.
And pray do not be alarmed, Madame, at anything&mdash;it really
is not worth while."</p>

<p>But she could not command herself. He was as surprised and
amused at her fear of him as he had been surprised and amused at
Fayard's lack of fear of him. Was it possible that, after two
years of Paris, she had learnt so little?</p>

<p>Fayard had spoken of prayers and tears, and there was a holy
statue in a corner of the frivolous room, a <i>dévote</i>
perhaps, after all? He casually asked her the name of her
confessor.</p>

<p>At this her terror redoubled. He thought she was about to
faint, and said with some sternness:</p>

<p>"Madame, control these vapours, there is nothing in the world
more wearisome."</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre appeared stung by this; she replied with
some dignity:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur must excuse me, I have been taken greatly by
surprise at this visit. My confessor is Père Duchène."</p>

<p>"You must learn, Madame, never to be taken by surprise. Père
Duchène is, I dare say, very suitable."</p>

<p>"He is a holy, good man&mdash;and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is, then, astonishing that he remains in Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is because his ministrations are so needed here."</p>

<p>"And so ineffectual, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, Monseigneur, even in Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you have learnt to say&mdash;<i>even</i> in Paris! You
progress."</p>

<p>Madame bit her lip and was silent. Her cheeks were now
flushed, her dark eyes sparkling. She was very pretty indeed; why
had no one told him she had bright gold hair under the powder?
Madame de Sourdeau had been jealous of his marriage and he had
wondered why; now he knew that his mistress had noticed what he
had missed&mdash;a beauty in the bud.</p>

<p>What of Fayard's <i>coup de
théâtre?</i><i>&mdash;</i><i>it</i> was the middle of the night.
Lavardin had not risen to the occasion perhaps. M. de Penthièvre
glanced round the room again; if the lover was hidden somewhere
he must be getting very stiff and feeling very foolish by now,
poor devil!</p>

<p>But was he yet her lover?</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre began to feel a faint interest in that
question. Fayard had said "To-night&mdash;for the first time."
One trusted Fayard.</p>

<p>He looked reflectively at his wife and suggested a game of
tric-trac. "I see you have a board there&mdash;"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in terror.</p>

<p>"But, Monseigneur, you are not remaining&mdash;I implore you
not to remain&mdash;in the morning, anything in the
morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is Andre," said M. de Penthièvre gently. "It will
have escaped your memory, perhaps&mdash;if we were interrupted it
would be tactful for you to use the familiar address&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If we are interrupted?" she cried in an extremity of
terror.</p>

<p>"I spoke of possibilities."</p>

<p>He had fetched the tric-trac board and set it between them;
while his back had been turned to her he had observed in a mirror
that she had given a glance and gesture of panic terror towards
the window. M. Saint Mexme had, then, not come, but was
expected.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre placed himself facing the window and set the
pieces on the board. He saw the long satin curtains waving
slightly in the night breeze; surely the window was unlocked.</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre called out:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I implore you to go away!"</p>

<p>And it seemed to her husband that she did not speak to him,
but to someone beyond him; but, if this was so, her warning was
unsuccessful, for round the curtains came a bare hand and a
cascade of ruffles, the gleam of a brocade coat-cuff.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre moved his piece on the board. The lady had
her back to the window and dare not turn her head; there was
silence for a moment and in that moment M. Saint Mexme had
stepped lightly into the room.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said M. de Penthièvre agreeably. "Will you
close the window, please? There is a draught."</p>

<p>No one could have been more amazed and shocked than M. Saint
Mexme; he had two considerable disadvantages in this encounter;
he was twenty years old and rapt in an idealistic love; he was
quite prepared to die, but first he cried, in tones of faltering
reproach:</p>

<p>"You said that I might come if there was a light in the
window!"</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre was also quite ready to die; she
perceived that she had been betrayed. She felt more courage than
she had felt since her husband had entered; she contrived to
answer.</p>

<p>"I did not put this light!"</p>

<p>"No," said M. de Penthièvre, "it was I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," she added, "the signal I promised was to have been in
my oratory&mdash;this&mdash;" and she covered her face with her
hands, "is my bedchamber&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre saw by the youth's horrified glance round the
room that he was here for the first time. Fayard was right, one
could trust Fayard.</p>

<p>"I have been betrayed," murmured M. Saint Mexme. "Not by me,"
said the lady, looking up. "My husband is here without my
invitation."</p>

<p>"That is true," confirmed M. de Penthièvre. He was interested;
he looked from one to another of the two half-swooning young
creatures. They made him feel quite old.</p>

<p>Madelon continued speaking:</p>

<p>"I did not intend to put the light, I meant you to
go&mdash;without a further farewell, but now we are undone."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is always a farewell," remarked the young Duke,
"when a midnight assignation is discovered."</p>

<p>M. Saint Mexme replied, like one rapt above the world. "To-
morrow I was to have gone to Rennes with Pere Duchène, to enter
the monastery of the Dominicans."</p>

<p>"So Père Duchène is in this intrigue?"</p>

<p>"He persuaded us to&mdash;say farewell," said M. Saint Mexme.
"I would have gone with the dawn, to Rennes."</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien,</i> Monsieur," asked M. de Penthièvre, "what
prevents you?"</p>

<p>"You, Monsieur le Duc. You will certainly kill me. I am
useless at sword-play&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre eyed the graceful, handsome youth who had
such a studious, serious air, with amusement. He wanted to say,
"Then you should keep out of these situations," but refrained,
out of charity, and smiled, considering them both. His tolerant
philosophy told him that even if what they said seemed to him
highly improbable, it might nevertheless be true; the bizarre was
not inevitably impossible.</p>

<p>And as he paused, master of their immediate fate,</p>

<p>Madame de Penthièvre, unable any longer to endure this
terrible suspense, rose and flung herself at his feet.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I know that you cannot forgive, <i>me</i> for
loving Claude! But if you could forgive <i>him!</i> We were both
so young and so lonely! Perhaps," she added in despair, "I might
take the veil, only, Monseigneur, have the generosity not to kill
Claude!"</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre rose.</p>

<p>"Do not kneel to me, Madame; rise up, Madame la
Duchesse&mdash;I forbid you to kneel, Madame de
Penthièvre&mdash;"</p>

<p>And M. Saint Mexme cried:</p>

<p>"Why do you plead for me, Madelon, when I would sooner be
dead?"</p>

<p>Through this came sharp raps on the door and a harsh voice
crying without:</p>

<p>"Madelon! Madelon!"</p>

<p>"Ah," remarked M. de Penthièvre, "I fear, after all,
chevalier, you will have to step behind those curtains&mdash;I
regret the inconvenience, which I trust will be brief."</p>

<p>And he gently led the astonished and half-fainting youth to
the alcove and dropped in front of him the lengths of soft
'brocade; then M. de Penthièvre turned to his wife and spoke more
seriously than he had yet done, more seriously than, indeed, he
had spoken to anyone for a long while.</p>

<p>"Madame, I implore you to command yourself&mdash;this is no
moment for rustic breeding."</p>

<p>Now the door opened and M. de Lavardin entered angrily and
hastily; he had seen a man's cloak and gloves and hat in the
ante-room, and no protests of Margot could keep him from his
sister's room.</p>

<p>"My dear Marquis," said M. de Penthièvre, "you look quite
discomposed&mdash;and this agitated entry! No ill-fortune, I
trust&mdash;one of your favourite dogs killed in the chase?"</p>

<p>"You here!" exclaimed M. de Lavardin stupidly.</p>

<p>"Your astonishment," remarked the young Duke, "is a poor
compliment to your sister, my dear Lavardin." He eyed him coldly.
"An explanation, don't you think? The time and manner of your
visit are both distinctly unusual."</p>

<p>M. de Lavardin was utterly nonplussed; he gazed at his sister,
who met his glance with dignity, and then round the room; he felt
that he was being fooled, but it was impossible to discover how,
or by whom. He could hardly voice his suspicions of Madelon in
the presence of Madelon's husband, who gazed at him with such
haughty indifference.</p>

<p>He thought with fury of Fayard.</p>

<p>"I have been misinformed or deceived," he muttered.</p>

<p>"That may happen to the most intelligent," remarked M. de
Penthièvre; he turned to his wife, addressing her in the familiar
style. "You have, perhaps, Madelon, something to say to your
brother?"</p>

<p>She replied with ease and spirit.</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear Andre, what should I have to say, I am as
utterly at a loss as you&mdash;"</p>

<p>M. de Lavardin strode up to them.</p>

<p>"You will not venture to tell me, Madelon, that you are
happily married?" he exclaimed, looking with hate at the young
Duke, "when I know you have been pining and neglected by the
fashionable <i>roué</i> I was so mad as to give you to? You will
not deny, that, weary of his infidelities, you were about to take
a lover? No, I think you are not likely to deny it. I have come
to take you home, Madelon, while our honour is untarnished; to
remove you from temptation and scorn."</p>

<p>"How admirably you speak!" remarked the young Duke pleasantly.
"I had no idea, Lavardin, that you were so eloquent. And now, my
dear Madelon, I believe it rests with you."</p>

<p>"What rests with me?" She looked from one to the other
apprehensively.</p>

<p>M. de PenPenthièvreplained.</p>

<p>"Your brother believes you unhappy&mdash;he has chosen this
odd moment to say so&mdash;he has generously offered to take you
back to the amenities of the Château Lavardin&mdash;while, I
presume, a divorce is arranged?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Marquis harshly. "I have come, in brief,
to rescue my sister&mdash;I have stood by too long."</p>

<p>M. de PenPenthiè looked at his wife and his eyes were serious
though his words were light.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear Madelon, a chance of escape&mdash;if you are
bored with Paris, with me&mdash;if you have felt dull or sad." He
paused a second, and added: "If you have, by any chance, seen
someone whom you would prefer as a husband&mdash;some noble,
virtuous youth, entirely devoted to you, for instance&mdash;here
is your chance, so elegantly offered by your brother."</p>

<p>"And by you?" she asked.</p>

<p>M. de PenPenthiè bowed.</p>

<p>"And by me, certainly."</p>

<p>Madame de PenPenthiè fluttered her long lashes from one man to
another and did not fail of a glance at the brocade curtain where
the third man was concealed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have entirely misunderstood me," she said to
her brother. "I am perfectly content."</p>

<p>"Content?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"You do not wish," demanded M. de Lavardin, incredulous, "for
a separation&mdash;for a divorce?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Madame de PenPenthiè faintly. "I am happy with
my husband."</p>

<p>The young Duke was moving the pieces on the tric-trac board;
he seemed absorbed in that.</p>

<p>M. de Lavardin bowed bitterly to his sister.</p>

<p>"I shall, then," he remarked, "cease to interest myself in
your affairs slisinceu assure me that you are happy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Charles, I am indeed happy."</p>

<p>M. de PenPenthiè looked up.</p>

<p>"Fayard admitted you, I believe. Fayard, my dear Marquis, will
let you out."</p>

<p>"It is Fayard, then, who has betrayed me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fayard is in my service&mdash;and my confidence. I knew that
he was about to play a little jest on your austerity,
Marquis."</p>

<p>"A jest?"</p>

<p>"Did he not say&mdash;to-night Madame will receive a
lover?"</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you behold us!"</p>

<p>"I behold a husband!"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," remarked M. de PenPenthiè reflectively, "they are
the same person&mdash;you have never, perhaps, heard of it,
Marquis?"</p>

<p>At this M. de Lavardin turned angrily on his sister.</p>

<p>"This is an insolent and indelicate jest," he declared, "and I
wash my hands of your affairs!" Then, to the young Duke, "De
Penthièvre, I ought to call you out for this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you won't, will you? Au revoir, my dear Marquis." M. de
Lavardin flounced out of the room. M. de Penthièvre looked at his
wife.</p>

<p>"Madame, you did that quite well, I see you have learnt some
discretion."</p>

<p>He locked the door while she stood motionless by the bed,
looking down.</p>

<p>"Why did you save me, Monseigneur?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you save yourself; Madame? Your brother would have
taken you away and in time you could have married M. Saint Mexme,
who will be getting very stiff behind that curtain."</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew the brocade aside and the young chevalier
came slowly into the room.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said M. de Penthièvre pleasantly, "that you must
leave the way you came, Monsieur, but it is not, I believe,
difficult. Do not miss your foothold on the sculptures, or the
door in the garden wall." He pulled the curtains aside from the
window. "Ah, the dawn, you will have plenty of light!"</p>

<p>The pearly lustre of the rising sun was indeed illuminating
Paris; in this light they all looked pale.</p>

<p>"I may say farewell to Madame?" murmured M. Saint Mexme.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I will, if you wish, withdraw to the
antechamber."</p>

<p>But Madame de Penthièvre cried out:</p>

<p>"No! Claude, I have nothing to say&mdash;we have been
extricated from disaster&mdash;" She turned aside.</p>

<p>"I fear, Madame, you are very fickle," said poor M. Saint
Mexme reproachfully. "You appear to take no further interest in
me."</p>

<p>"Don't grieve for that, my dear child," remarked M. de
Penthièvre. "You must absolutely steel yourself against feminine
caprice. And do not, I beg," he added, taking the youth kindly by
the arm, "go to that dull monastery, you would be very wretched.
Rennes is a <i>ville de province</i>&mdash;eh, have more
sense!"</p>

<p>"But, Madelon," lamented the youth, "appears to no longer care
for me!"</p>

<p>"I am very fond of you," faltered Madame de Penthièvre; "I
have for you, I believe, a sisterly affection; forgive me if,
till now, I have not known my own feelings."</p>

<p>"I am quite bewildered!" cried M. Saint Mexme.</p>

<p>"You are inexperienced," consoled the young Duke, "but you
will, I trust, my dear chevalier, be none the worse for this
little adventure&mdash;if you ever get into similar difficulties
I shall be delighted to give you the benefit of my advice."</p>

<p>"You are not, then, going to kill me?"</p>

<p>"No. You will probably do that for yourself, my poor friend,
if you continue to take life so seriously."</p>

<p>"You have been most generous, I will go," said the youth
heavily; he bowed to the lady with what grace he could muster and
stepped on to the balcony.</p>

<p>"I hope that he does not break his neck," said M. de
Penthièvre, drawing the curtains over the dawn light.</p>

<p>"He is very silly," murmured Madelon. "I am disappointed that
he behaved no better&mdash;you, Monseigneur, must have found us
so foolish, so indiscreet! I am entirely ashamed!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary I thought that you displayed admirable
presence of mind."</p>

<p>"I did my best to second your efforts, Monseigneur, to save me
from my terrible predicament. <i>Mon Dieu,</i> what should I have
done if Charles had discovered Claude here? But you,
Monseigneur," she added, flushing with emotion, "have behaved
with a generosity, a magnanimity!"</p>

<p>She sank down on to the chair beside the tric-trac board; she
forgot the Andalusian shawl; under the gauze robe her bosom
heaved with agitation. She was really extremely pretty and by no
means lacking in sensibility.</p>

<p>M. de Penthièvre took the chair the other side of the tric-
trac board and glanced at her with approval.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he remarked, "that you have lost the
championship of your brother."</p>

<p>"I am not sorry&mdash;Charles I never wish to see again! But
for you he would have ruined me to-night!"</p>

<p>"But this leaves you, Madame, entirely under my
protection&mdash;you have dismissed your lover and your
brother&mdash;" He smiled. "I fear, Madelon, you are rather
fickle."</p>

<p>"No," said Madame de Penthièvre, on a quick breath,
"sometimes&mdash;when one cannot get what one wants&mdash;one
amuses oneself with&mdash;second best."</p>

<p>"Second best?"</p>

<p>"Claude."</p>

<p>They were silent; the room was very still; little rays of the
dawn filtered under the curtains, the candlelight dying in the
acanthus cups of the girandole gave a flickering glow in the rich
chamber and flashed in the lustre of M. de Penthièvre's diamonds,
which rose rather hurriedly on his breast.</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Shall we," said she, blushing and timid, "finish the game of
tric-trac?"</p>

<p>"Unless you think, my dear love, that we could find something
better to do?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. A MATRIMONIAL
ENTANGLEMENT</h2>

<p class="first"><br>
LUCIEN confessed, with blushes, that he was in the toils of
Madame de la Morilière, and that the description of her, as
furnished by the ladies of his acquaintance, "as a minx, a
designing piece," was true enough.</p>

<p>"But I must marry her," he concluded dolefully, "for she has
so tangled me in her net that there is no escape."</p>

<p>"Fie, upon such weakness and ungallantry," protested his
friend, the Cavalier Lebeuf. "Putting the blame on the lady will
not help you to ease your situation!"</p>

<p>"You do not know her tricks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is their manner to have tricks&mdash;what else is there
for them but tricks, after all, poor creatures?"</p>

<p>Lucien was, however, neither consoled nor rebuked.</p>

<p>"You," he declared, "have not to face an angry guardian who
has other designs for you, who controls your fortune and has an
austere temper!"</p>

<p>"What designs has M. Delaruelle for you, my poor Lucien?"</p>

<p>"Nothing less than a rich heiress," groaned the unhappy youth.
"I have seen her and she is the sweetest creature in the world,
she makes Madame de la Morilière look like a gypsy, she is
submissive to a glance, and with enough money, Adrien, to pay all
my debts and yours too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then marry her and receive the blessing of M.
Delaruelle."</p>

<p>"But I am promised to Madame de la Morilière. Cannot you
understand? And she will by no means let me go."</p>

<p>"I <i>see</i> no reason for the lady's tenacity," smiled the
candid friend. "Nay, on reflection, I see three excellent
reasons&mdash;your titles, honours, and estates."</p>

<p>Lucien flounced, like the pampered, idle, effeminate and vain
youth that he was, and declared that the other had neither
feeling nor understanding.</p>

<p>But neither his flouncings nor his complaints would help him;
he had come up from his <i>chdteau</i> with the purpose of seeing
his uncle and guardian, and <i>see</i> him he must, though with
such a sorry story on his lips, the more sorry that he had been
rescued from an unapproved charmer in Paris and sent to the
country to learn wisdom in seclusion, while M. Delaruelle
prepared for him an establishment, "worthy," as the phrase went,
"of his rank." Lucien was considerably in awe of his uncle who
had been rendered, by a disappointment in his youth, harsh and
difficult on the subject of feminine allurements, and who, early
discovering the pleasures of life to be dusty to his taste, had
devoted himself to business and was now a portentous figure in
State affairs.</p>

<p>This was another reason for the dislike of Lucien, who thought
anything serious tedious and anything difficult boring; keenly
did he look forward to the happy day when he should be of age and
at liberty to squander his estates, his health, and his
reputation as he pleased; meanwhile there was this disagreeable
moment to be faced, and sulk as he would Lucien must face his
uncle.</p>

<p>So he set off in his dove-coloured cabriolet with the glasses
up to keep off the November winds, and two lusty hounds to run in
front and clear the way, and a coachman with a long whip to lash
the stray pedestrians from coming too close, and so arrived at
the Hotel Delaruelle at that very unpleasant time, the twilight
of a wet autumn day, but with some state, as befitting his rank
as a <i>pair de France,</i> or so he thought.</p>

<p>His uncle, who from a window had watched his equipage sweep
into the forecourt, did not hesitate to express a contrary
opinion.</p>

<p>"That coach is absurd for anyone but an opera dancer&mdash;and
you are most ridiculously over-dressed. With all that powder,
silk, lace, and fal-lal you look more like a pet monkey than a
man!"</p>

<p>Lucien was not impressed; he never had any respect for the
taste of those who disagreed with him and he knew that he was
arrayed in the latest fashion and to the admiration of his tailor
and barber; in other words, of the people he had paid (or might
pay) to set him out like he was.</p>

<p>So he bowed ironically and answered coolly:</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, we cannot all be so immersed in great matters as
to be regardless of our appearance, or so intellectual as to be
ignorant of the <i>mode. Dieu merci,"</i> he added, impertinently
putting up his quizzing glass, "for I declare, my dear uncle,
that you cut a very old-fashioned figure."</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle disdained this sally, but it did not improve his
temper towards his nephew, whom he had disliked ever since he was
an odious, spoilt child in a satin frock and silk leading
strings, cracking pages on the head with a silver spoon.</p>

<p>"Please do not answer my rebukes till you have the wit to
understand them," he replied dryly.</p>

<p>"By that time," said Lucien, making another bow, "I shall be
my own master and not need to hear them."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," answered M. Delaruelle, "that you will ruin
yourself, my dear Lucien, just as soon as you are at liberty to
do so; then, as you insinuate, it will be no affair of mine. At
present it is, and I, as your guardian, must do my duty by
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, pray, Monseigneur," asked the frivolous youth, "let
that same duty be done as briefly as possible. I find nothing so
boring as a grumbling virtue which does good for five minutes and
preaches about it for an hour."</p>

<p>"And I," replied his uncle, "find nothing so boring as a
mincing young ape who reaches for wit and falls on folly."</p>

<p>After which hopeful beginning the two gentlemen settled to
business, the elder bringing out papers and account books and
rent rolls, and the younger fetching yawns and sighs and deriving
his only consolation from his own sparkling reflection in the
only mirror the sober room afforded, near to which he had
contrived to place himself. The room and the person of M.
Delaruelle had indeed rather an affectation of plainness; he had
been so absorbed in being of service to his country that he had
neglected the graces of life, often observing that to be an
honest statesman is a full occupation for any man.</p>

<p>What leisure he had over after his scrupulous labours was
engaged in securing applause for them; for, as he remarked, it
was not for the advantage of the country to have the great and
good obscured and the wicked and paltry pushed to the front.</p>

<p>In short, M. Delaruelle had acquired a modicum of that boring
quality which has, alas, too frequently given virtue a bad name,
and, despite his earnest desire to do good to the unworthy, found
that these usually fled his company, leaving him to that of those
as dull and as useful as himself.</p>

<p>Having therefore his nephew and (unfortunately) the future
head of his house before him, he did not neglect the opportunity
to deliver a homily, under various heads, on all the vices,
follies and shortcomings of that disappointing young man.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was thus well in for it, Lucien made a dramatic
diversion by relating his entanglement with Madame de la
Morilière, even deriving a certain pleasure in the lengthening
and blanching of his uncle's face.</p>

<p>"An entanglement! With a widow! Impossible!" cried that
gentleman.</p>

<p>"I wish," replied Lucien pettishly, "that it were; but it is
not, and you, my dear uncle, must make the worst of
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>This M. Delaruelle at once proceeded to do, sparing no
epithets in his denunciation of Lucien's idiocy.</p>

<p>"And how did this creature find you out?" he concluded. "Where
was your tutor and your confessor and your steward that they did
not protect you?"</p>

<p>"They were all courting her themselves," replied Lucien, "save
M. l'Abbé, and he was occupied in writing a treatise on 'The
Perils of Worldly Temptation to the Devout,' which you, no doubt,
my dear uncle, will find very edifying."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried M. Delaruelle, "who is this snake in the grass,
and how did she come to be at Château Mailly?"</p>

<p>"She appeared, in a night, in a little farm on the estate; she
was attired in mourning and sought, she said, to fly worldly
pleasures."</p>

<p>"And you had nothing better to do than to bring them to her
notice, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing. And that, Monseigneur, was your
fault&mdash;you should have allowed me to remain in Paris."</p>

<p>"And you have promised to marry her?"</p>

<p>"Before witnesses."</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle groaned.</p>

<p>"And I had obtained for you an heiress with a fortune!"</p>

<p>"I regret that myself," admitted Lucien. "I have seen the
young lady and approve her&mdash;but Madame de la Morilière will
be by no means put off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," cried M. Delaruelle. "You will return at once to
Mailly, seek out this cunning adventuress and repudiate all your
engagements to her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucien smiled.</p>

<p>"You don't know her&mdash;to see her is to consider her the
most fascinating creature in the world. Only at a distance can I
regard her calmly. If I was to see her again I should probably
marry her immediately."</p>

<p>"Then," said M. Delaruelle grimly, "I must go." Lucien was
delighted.</p>

<p>"That, of course, would be most suitable; everyone knows how
impervious you are, Monseigneur, to female charms. And everyone
can see," he added in an aside, "how unlikely you are to inspire
a tender passion&mdash;you are doubly safe."</p>

<p>This was a mere malicious sally, however, for M. Delaruelle
was in the prime of life and a handsome man had it not been for a
certain cast of rigidity in his face, due to condemning others,
and a certain priggishness in his expression, due to a
consciousness of his own good qualities. He did not catch the
last part of Lucien's speech and the first flattered him.</p>

<p>"I have had my lesson," he remarked. "As you know, my youth
was blighted by the faithlessness of woman."</p>

<p>"And your character soured, most unfortunate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Soured, my dear Lucien! My feet were turned from the way of
folly, my eyes were opened, from a useless fop I became a not
unworthy member of the Government. Yes, I really owe a great deal
to Terèse. It was," he added reflectively, "a curious case. She
was, I may say, in every way my inferior, birth, fortune, talent,
character, and yet she jilted me, actually jilted me for a
grinning fool with twopence a year!"</p>

<p>"I've heard the tale," said Lucien hastily, fearful of further
reminiscences. "Yes, indeed, she must have had no taste whatever.
No doubt she has by now heartily repented of her error."</p>

<p>"I believe that she has," replied M. Delaruelle with stern
satisfaction. "The last I heard of her, she was living in
indigence in Spain."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucien, rising, "I take it that you, my dear
uncle, will settle matters with Madame de la Mori-lière and leave
me free to marry the delicious little heiress."</p>

<p>"I hope," answered his uncle grimly, "that this will be the
last trouble that I shall have to take for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is unlikely," remarked Lucien with resignation, "for you
have, unhappily, a penchant for interfering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your impertinence is scarcely amusing. I am bound to endure
you, Lucien, but do not make my task more disagreeable than it
need be. Perhaps, after all, I need not go to Mailly; what could
this wretched woman do if we ignored her?"</p>

<p>"Come to Paris and make an <i>esdandre;</i> she would relish
doing that. She has, also, some notes of mine that I fear you
would not call very sensible."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I must sacrifice myself; my ease, my
leisure, my duty to my country, must all, Lucien, be sacrificed
to you!"</p>

<p>"That," said the ungrateful youth, "is a sad thought, but
consider the virtuous glow that will be your reward!"</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle then, in the heaviest of greatcoats and the
worst of tempers, set out for Mailly, his nephew's estate; it was
that season of the year when the roads were as vile as the
weather and the humour of those forced to travel worse than
either.</p>

<p>The cold triumphed over fur capes and foot-warmers, over sips
of old cognac and pious thoughts; when M. Delaruelle pressed his
reddened nose to the carriage window he saw a landscape that
appeared to be traced in ashes and vinegar, a sky that looked
like iron, and a varied collection of those filthy hovels in
which Divine decree had placed the poor.</p>

<p>The inns, expecting no one at this time of the winter, were
ill provided with everything save draughts and smoky fires, and
M. Delaruelle was obliged to reflect that, plainly as he had
lived, he had been a great deal more comfortable than he had
supposed.</p>

<p>Water masquerading as soup, an ancient foul masquerading as
capon, wine that turned the stomach instead of raising the
spirits, did little to change the mood of M. Delaruelle.</p>

<p>The second day being one of perpetual wind, sleet, and
floundering of the horses in the mud, was a constant (and
unnecessary) trial of the stoic patience that M. Delaruelle under
different circumstances had found so easy to employ.</p>

<p>Worse than this, as the darkness came on the postillion, with
the stupidity of his kind, declared that he had lost his way; the
road that he had been confidently following had proved to be no
road at all, but had run into a track that turned into a gaunt
and dreary wood. It was raining heavily and the cold was of a
singularly penetrating order; to crown all, M. Delaruelle, on
asking for the cognac, discovered that this, by some singular
oversight, had been left behind at the last stopping place.</p>

<p>It was an excellent occasion for the exercise of that
philosophy that M. Delaruelle had always advocated, but he felt
oddly disinclined to profit by it. Dismounting from the carriage
into the icy slush he viewed with dismay the barren woods, the
rain-slashed prospect, the growing dark, the complete loneliness,
and all his intelligence could bring him to no better conclusion
than that already arrived at by the postillions, i.e., that they
must turn back and endeavour to discover the road to Mailly.</p>

<p>Even this course, however, was far from proving successful;
the tempest increased, the lamps flickered in the wind, and the
end of the business was the coach in a ditch with a broken
wheel.</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle therefore had now to emerge from the comparative
shelter of the carriage and survey by the gusty light of the
surviving lantern the extent of the damage. This was not
considerable, but it was sufficient; it would be quite impossible
to proceed further.</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle therefore took one postillion with him, together
with the light, and, leaving the other two men reluctantly in
charge of the broken equipage, set out to discover if some
shelter might be found.</p>

<p>They were not indeed long before they came upon a neat little
house, which, though it was not the kind of dwelling that the
statesman usually honoured with his presence, he was,
nevertheless, extremely glad to see.</p>

<p>A vigorous knocking brought a pretty little maid to the door;
M. Delaruelle, conscious of his draggled appearance, asked
pompously if they were on the estates of Monseigneur le Duc de
Mailly, adding that he was no less a person than the Marquis
Delaruelle, that nobleman's uncle.</p>

<p>The servant replied respectfully that this was a long way from
the Chateau Mailly, but that she was sure that her mistress, the
Baronne, would desire them to take refuge against the inclemency
of the weather.</p>

<p>The traveller jumped at the suggestion, explained the accident
to the coach, and begged that assistance might be sent to his men
and horses.</p>

<p>He was assured that the case would be put before the mistress
of the house, and was shown (after being relieved of his dripping
coat) into a snug, cosy parlour, where a huge fire burned on the
hearth, a rosy lamp glowed on the table, and a cushioned chair
stood invitingly empty. M. Delaruelle did not hesitate to make
use of this, and stretched himself luxuriously before the warm
blaze; his returning good humour was helped by the entry of the
maid with a tray of cordials and the news that supper was in
preparation.</p>

<p>"Evil fortune," remarked M. Delaruelle, who, left alone with
the cordials, had carelessly drunk rather more glasses of these
excellent liqueurs than he was aware of, "seldom resists the
steady fortitude of the lofty minded." And he smiled at the row
of bottles with a smile slightly fatuous.</p>

<p>The entry of his hostess brought him in some confusion to his
feet.</p>

<p>The lady, who was attired with a nunlike sobriety, a mourning
cap with lappets and a housewifely apron, regarded him
expectantly.</p>

<p>"Terèse!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Exactly. How nice of you to remember the name!" And she sat
down beside him as he sank, astonished, into the great chair.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary meeting!" he stammered.
"I&mdash;er&mdash;thought you were in Spain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I was," she said demurely, "but I have returned, a
chastened, and, I trust, a better woman."</p>

<p>"Alphonse?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>"He would be," said M. Delaruelle. "He was that sort of
man."</p>

<p>"A sad error," the widow admitted frankly. "I assure you that
if I have wept it was not for his demise, but for my wasted
youth."</p>

<p>"That I can believe&mdash;and he left you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"A pittance and the memory of a mistake," she sighed. M.
Delaruelle smiled the smile of one justified of himself. "My dear
Terèse! Now I hope that you will confess that you were foolish to
cast me of Terèse threw up her charming eyes.</p>

<p>"Is there need to confess? And you, Armand, have become a
great man!"</p>

<p>"I trust that I have been of some service to my country, and
there I will allow you some merit. Had you not early shown me the
vanity of earthly affections I might not have been the man I am
now."</p>

<p>"I was never," sighed Terèse humbly, "good enough for you,
Armand, a little, silly, vain thing!"</p>

<p>"Well, well," he replied generously, "we will not dwell on
that. You, no doubt, have paid for your foolishness. Now tell me
what you are doing here and how you employ your time."</p>

<p>"I live in this secluded spot in the retirement suitable to my
estate," she said. "I work for the poor and add to my scanty
income by fine needlework."</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle approved.</p>

<p>"I am glad that you are of such a turn of mind," he remarked,
thinking how plump and comely and neat she still was. "And now
perhaps you can help me in a very disagreeable business. Are we
near the Château Mailly?"</p>

<p>"No, we are not."</p>

<p>"Dear me, how that fool must have mistaken the road! Well,
that simpleton, Lucien, my nephew, has actually entangled himself
with a designing female, one Terèse, a widow like yourself, but
in character far different."</p>

<p>"Fie, Monsieur," protested the lady, casting down her eyes. "I
hope that this is a tale that the strictest decorum would permit
to be unfolded?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, though I admire your caution. Have you heard of a
certain Madame de la Morilière?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have. Let my blushes complete my answer."</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"She is. Pray pursue the subject no further."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" cried M. Delaruelle, pouring out another
glass of cordial. "Is it as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"It is. This reproach to her sex has allured, by the basest of
means, all the youths of the neighbourhood, among them your
nephew. Let us avert our eyes, Armand, from the degrading
spectacle."</p>

<p>"I can't. I've got to rescue the young fool. His marriage is
arranged for him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In heaven?"</p>

<p>"No, in Paris, a more definite, if a less reputable locality.
I do not remember, Terèse, that you used to be so pious and
proper."</p>

<p>"Armand! Have you forgotten my years, my situation? What is
there for a woman blighted in her affections, deceived in her
marriage, but a retirement given to good works and the most
circumspect behaviour?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," he agreed hastily. "Now, as for this
Madame de la Morilière&mdash;where does she live?"</p>

<p>"At the very gates of Château Mailly, which she regards as her
future residence."</p>

<p>"I must buy her off;" sighed M. Delaruelle. "She is, of
course, unscrupulous, rapacious, heartless?"</p>

<p>"To the last degree."</p>

<p>"What the devil could Lucien have seen in her?"</p>

<p>"That, Armand, you should be able to answer better than I,"
replied Terèse demurely. "It is useless to ask a virtuous female
of what consist the attractions of the&mdash;er&mdash;other
sort."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But you will have noticed if she is pretty?"</p>

<p>"I always drop my veil when we chance to meet," said Terèse
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said M. Delaruelle, resigned, "I must see her
myself; that is all. I shall not spare her, I assure you."</p>

<p>"How was it that you left Lucien unprotected so long? I have
often wondered."</p>

<p>"How could I guess that in a spot so secluded there would be
danger? And you, Terèse, might have warned me!"</p>

<p>"I dare not bring myself to your notice&mdash;nor was it an
affair in which a female of delicacy could with propriety
interfere."</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle regarded his long-lost love with an approval
that was not unmingled with amazement. Never, surely, since the
days of Luther had there been such a reformation!</p>

<p>Gone were all her wild, roguish tricks, her indiscreet talk,
her flightly airs, her careless laugh, the hundred fripperies of
her dress, her rouge and powder, her trinkets and laces; she was
as demure a piece as the soberest of men could desire.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," thought her former lover, "that this change
is due to my precepts? To remorse and regret at my loss?"</p>

<p>Never, surely, had a man ever received such a compliment; and
the meek creature seemed to expect no reward; though he observed
her glances of shy adoration they were not tempered by hope; she
was content to worship from afar the rich prize she had, in her
flippant youth, so wantonly flung away.</p>

<p>"I am glad, my dear Terèse," he said, feeling outwardly and
inwardly warmed and comforted, "that any recollection of me or of
my admonitions should have had this gratifying effect of making
you change the mode of life to which I so strongly took
exception. I commend your efforts, and you may be comforted in
your seclusion by the knowledge that your, er&mdash;penitence has
been appreciated, yes, my dear Terèse, appreciated!"</p>

<p>"How beautifully you speak," she cried, her eyes swimming in
tears of gratitude. "Believe me, Armand, never shall I again
transgress those rules of decorum the breaking of which cost me,
alas, my life's happiness!"</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle had begun by now to forget that it was the lady
who had jilted him, and to believe that it was he who had left
the lady; this added to his state of spiritual comfort, and when
he heard supper announced he smiled with greater amiability than
he had shown for years.</p>

<p>The supper was excellent; Terèse had evidently not included
the pleasures of the table among the vanities she had renounced,
and M. Delaruelle relaxed to that cosy state of sleepy repletion
when there is a positive delight in sitting in a warm room with a
good meal on the table and listening to the winter wind howling
without.</p>

<p>He was beginning to think, with delicious anticipation, of a
soft bed, a warming pan, and a tempting breakfast in the
distance, when Terèse rose and said:</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Armand, I hope that you are sufficiently
refreshed to continue your journey."</p>

<p>"Continue my journey!"</p>

<p>"I do not know if you can find the Château Mailly, for it is
very dark and stormy, and I have no guide to send with you, also
I fear you must go on foot as your coach had to be left in the
ditch and I have no carriage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why? Surely I may trespass on your hospitality to the
extent of a bed?"</p>

<p>"Fie, Armand, what are you suggesting? Consider my
reputation."</p>

<p>"Consider the night, Terèse&mdash;why, there is a storm fit to
blow one away&mdash;icy cold, torrents of rain," cried M.
Delaruelle in dismay.</p>

<p>"Armand, you forget yourself&mdash;surely it is better that
you should expose yourself to&mdash;and even perish in&mdash;the
tempest, than that the rules of decorum should be offended!"</p>

<p>"Rules of decorum!" answered the exasperated gentleman. "You
overdo it, Terèse&mdash;your good name&mdash;and mine&mdash;are
now above slander&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not," said the lady firmly. "I am an unprotected
female, living alone. What have I if I lose my fair name?"</p>

<p>"And what have I, if I break my neck in a ditch, or catch a
mortal chill?"</p>

<p>"A clear conscience," she replied modestly. "Oh, can I believe
it possible that he for whose sake I reformed my whole mode of
life is now tempting me to a gross indiscretion?"</p>

<p>"Fudge," cried M. Delaruelle, almost rudely. "There is no
indiscretion, the storm covers all. Besides, who need be the
wiser?"</p>

<p>"A dozen people know you are here&mdash;your men, my maids.
They have heard us address each other, I fear very
imprudently&mdash;in the familiar mode&mdash;and would it be so
difficult for gossip to discover that once we cherished a tender
passion for each other?"</p>

<p>These arguments left M. Delaruelle cold.</p>

<p>"It is an indecency," he exclaimed, "to turn a man out a night
like this."</p>

<p>"Then what is it," she retorted, "to rob a poor widow of her
one possession, her good name? Armand, I will not be compromised
because you fear to face a little rain."</p>

<p>"A little rain! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> You are altogether too high
flown and fantastical, Terèse&mdash;I swear I never compromised
anyone."</p>

<p>"That I can believe, Armand, but the argument is unaltered.
Fie, would you have me spoken of as another Madame de la
Morilière?"</p>

<p>"There can be no danger. My hair is grey and yours ought to
be," he replied snappishly. "Surely that is our defence?"</p>

<p>"'Twill but add a touch of ridicule to the <i>esclandre,"</i>
she sighed. "And you may be grey, Armand, though I vow I thought
you were powdered, but I, alas, am not yet counted past the
period of feminine weakness!"</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle pulled the curtains and tried to look out, but
saw only blackness, opened the window and was met by a blast that
nearly sent him backwards; a filthy night, there was no doubt of
that.</p>

<p>"You will feel odd if my corpse is discovered frozen or
drowned or broken by the way," he said morosely.</p>

<p>"I shall feel that you have died in a good cause," she
replied. "As one should die whose principal occupation was
observing the proprieties. Come, Armand, I will send for your
coat, which must be nearly dry, and you will take your staff and
set out, trusting in that God who is the sure protector of
innocence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never boasted that manner of innocence," retorted M.
Delaruelle, exasperated, "nor was I so presumptuous as to expect
Heaven to provide me with a guardian angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray, Monsieur," replied the lady primly, "begin then, to-
night, to solicit for one, for I doubt whether, without that
Divine protection, you will get as far as the Château
Mailly."</p>

<p>As she rang the bell to summon the maid, M. Delaruelle
groaned; plainly she was inexorable, too rigidly had she learned
the lesson that in their mutual youth he had tried in vain to
teach her, and he heartily wished that he had left the
matrimonial affairs of Lucien to disentangle themselves, as
indeed they would now probably have to, for he greatly doubted if
he should survive the rigours of the winter storm.</p>

<p>Bitterly he watched while a lantern, his greatcoat and hat
(still far from dry) were fetched, and sourly he asked if his men
had fared any better than himself.</p>

<p>"They are housed in the stables, long since disused, and, I
fear, rat-ridden, but naturally my maids, all chosen for their
impeccable characters, refuse to allow them to remain in the
house."</p>

<p>When M. Delaruelle reached the door and heard the wind and the
rain, felt the cold and saw the dark, he nearly decided to beg
permission to share the stables with the postillions, great as
that sacrifice to his dignity would be.</p>

<p>Terèse was meanwhile giving him directions as to his road;
confused they sounded, nor was the adventure rendered more
enticing by her warning that banditti were known to lurk in the
woods between her house and the Château Mailly.</p>

<p>At the last moment, however, the lady relented, or rather
conceived a brilliant compromise. There was, she said, a summer-
house at the end of the garden, known, from the statue of Eros it
contained, as the "Temple d'Amour", and there the uninvited guest
might spend the night; stone certainly, and damp possibly, was
this refuge, but better perhaps than a journey through the
storm.</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle agreed; a straight-faced abigail, whose virtue
was obviously unassailable by the influence of any god, or temple
of love, muffled herself up and, with a martyred air, conducted
M. Delaruelle through the wet and cold to the summer-house and
there left him with a lantern and the coy deity, who, for the
moment, surveyed a barren kingdom.</p>

<p>As soon as he was left alone M. Delaruelle discovered that he
had forgotten to ask for pillows or blankets; there was nothing
for it but to wrap himself in his damp greatcoat and lie on one
of the damp stone seats; wind and rain blew in through the
elegant pillars of the open entrance, and shift his position as
he would he could by no means become either dry or comfortable;
after some hours of this a stiffness and numbness overcame his
limbs that made him fear he was seized by a creeping palsy; this
was followed by shooting pains that showed he was in the grip of
his old enemy&mdash;rheumatism.</p>

<p>Sheer fatigue brought him some snatches of uneasy sleep,
disturbed by nightmares, and when at last the late winter
daylight penetrated into the summer-house, it was with a cold and
sour eye that the shivering M. Delaruelle glanced at the frozen
figure of the jaunty Cupid, and with a leer of disgust that he
thanked him for his icy hospitality.</p>

<p>The storm had abated, but even by the light of day the
prospect looked desolate; the only cheerful thing in sight was a
rosy light in the windows of the house at the end of the garden,
the glow of fires that were dissipating the gloom of the winter
morning.</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle wished to hide his disordered and discomfited
person in retreat, to hasten away to the nearest inn for rest,
refreshment, and a wheelwright, but the lure of that sparkling
rosy light was too strong; a breakfast and a fire proved
irresistible temptations; he moved stiffly towards the house.</p>

<p>The tempting perfume of frothing chocolate came to his
nostrils as he approached the parlour window, and, as he passed,
he looked in greedily.</p>

<p>There was the breakfast of his desires, the most elegant of
equipages set by the most cosy of fires and there was Terèse
presiding at the table in a charming undress, all knots of pink
ribbon and falls of blonde lace, in a coquettish cap that made
her appear not a day more than twenty-five. So far so good, and a
pretty enough picture&mdash;but Terèse was not alone.</p>

<p>Who was that lounging in the comfortable chair opposite with
his toes to the blaze and a smile of lazy self-satisfaction on
his face?</p>

<p>No one in the world but Lucien, that miserable
"scapegrace."</p>

<p>M. Delaruelle tapped on the window in blind, bewildered
fury.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" cried Lucien, "it is a ghost!"</p>

<p>"Of a good man," murmured Terèse, daintily serving sugar,
"even though he did die in the Temple of Love!"</p>

<p>Again M. Delaruelle violently rattled at the pane. Lucien rose
languidly and opened the window an inch or so.</p>

<p>"It is not a ghost, but uncle," he remarked. "We thought you
must be dead. You really can't come in, you're far too damp and
dirty, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Terèse," cried M. Delaruelle, his eyes glaring.</p>

<p>"Oh, fie, is she Terèse to you?" exclaimed Lucien. "Occupying
a lady's summer-house hardly gives you the right to use her so
familiarly."</p>

<p>"Fool," said M. Delaruelle furiously. "What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Arguing with you. I was so moped in Paris that I came down
here yesterday morning to pay a little visit to
Terèse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Terèse," groaned M. Delaruelle.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Lucien, bored, "you never thought to ask her
other name? It is Madame de la Morilière. And now I must close
the window. There is a plaguey draught."</p>

<p>He slipped the bolt and drew the curtains, from behind which
floated the perfume of chocolate and of laughter.</p>

<p>It was a drab consolation for the man outside to vow that both
belonged to a wicked woman.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. RED CHAMPAGNE</h2>

<p class="first"><br>
WHEN Marco Gherardi pledged his troth to Geva Gradenigo at her
villa on the Brenta the oranges showed jade-green beneath the
dark, glossy leaves and the July grapes, hard and bloomless,
spilled from the plates of gleaming lustre ware.</p>

<p>Geva leant on the table with chequered light and shade of vine
leaves moving over the smooth chestnut locks into which a last
white rose was negligently pinned; her face was pallid as a sea-
water pearl, and her two long hands lay in the warm clasp of her
dark lover.</p>

<p>Her dress gleamed the colour of moonlight; in her heavy-lidded
eyes lay tears for the beauty of the purple haze and the air
drowsy with the scent of ripening fruit.</p>

<p>"Pledge me till death," she said, "and past death?"</p>

<p>"Till death and past death," he whispered, and kissed her
frail fingers with long kisses, like a bee lingering by a
flower.</p>

<p>Geva drew away her right hand and took a silver bodkin from
her hair; the drooping rose fell from her locks to the table of
pale marble. Delicately she raised the slim, amber-hued bottle of
white wine and poured the clear drink into the two glasses of
milky lines that stood beside the platters of piled grapes, then
she pricked her arm and let the blood run into the glasses, drop
by drop, sliding into the fragrant liquid.</p>

<p>Marco also lightly stabbed his wrist veins, and the mingled
blood floated together as they drank the flushed wine, swearing
eternal fidelity in the warm, sleepy hot, hot afternoon; yea,
eternal, for their vows reached beyond death into the still blue
distances of the unknown.</p>

<p>That night a poisonous fly from the marshes stung Geva on the
opened skin and the burning malaria ran through all her limbs.
After another day and night of palpitating heat Geva died in the
great bed of chestnut wood with the Gradenigo coat of arms on the
head-board and Marco along the bedstep with buried face; till
they took away the four painted candles and the long, narrow,
gilt coffin.</p>

<p>Then Marco wandered through the mellow autumn wooing
melancholy in leafless groves, till October found him in Venice
amid the first glare and clatter of Carnival.</p>

<p>He was caught into the stream of gaiety, of riot, of licence;
beneath yellow moon and yellow lanterns, Arlequino whispered his
immortal jests, Spavento rattled his sword and Tartaglia grinned.
Columbina shook her gauzy plumes, and lisping murmurs from the
folds of black and white <i>beauta</i> asked when the Duca
Gherardi was likely to wed.</p>

<p>Men who had forgotten Geva Gradenigo, and women who had never
known her, mocked him for his sad face and sullen movements, till
the music and the light balloons, the pennons against the autumn
sky, the fantastic crowd on the Piazza, the languorous couples
passing in the cushioned gondolas, the doves flying above the
bronze horses of San Marco into the wine-purple air filled with
the powdered gold of Carnival dust, worked their way with him.
When the first shuddering chill of winter sent the freezing waves
over the sun-withered seaweed of the palace steps Marco was
betrothed to Camilla Andreini, and in Carnival time the marriage
feasts began.</p>

<p>Scaramouche, with his guitar, danced behind the wedding
procession, and the music of Furlanetto was played in the rococo
ballroom, where the Murano candelabra glanced with rainbow
colours and the masquers ran in and mingled with the guests.</p>

<p>Brilliant as a pearl in cloth of silver, with flowing veils of
black lace and a bouquet of diamonds, the bride danced a gavotte
with the bridegroom; the violins played the "Devil's Sonata,"
that inhuman music that Tartini heard in a dream; the blonde and
happy light illuminated a company gay as sunshine on a stream,
only Camilla whispered to her husband during the measures of the
dance: "Who is the mask clothed like me in cloth of silver and
priceless lace?"</p>

<p>Marco glanced where this lady sat alone and did not know who
she might be.</p>

<p>"See," added Camilla, "she, too, has a bouquet of diamonds,
and I did not know that there was another in Venice!"</p>

<p>Marco was also amazed to see the second bouquet of diamonds
lying before the masked lady on her table, but when the dance was
over he drew from his saffron waistcoat a single eight-sided
sapphire.</p>

<p>"This is unique," he said, "the heirloom of our house. Ask her
who she is!" he cried; but before they could reach the mask she
had disappeared, and in the voluptuous melodies of the violins,
in the tender smiles of the women, the murmurs of the men, the
feast danced through the limpid, frosty hours of night.</p>

<p>Now the bride was led to the doors of the nuptial chamber, and
guests and masks alike charged their glasses with bubbling
champagne of France. The doors closed behind the bridal couple
and the glasses were raised...</p>

<p>"But my wine is red!" cried one. "And mine!" another. "And
mine!" a third. "The colour of blood!" screamed a woman.</p>

<p>And as they gazed Camilla ran in from the balcony.</p>

<p>"Did you not go with Marco into the bridal chamber?" asked the
pale mother.</p>

<p>"Nay, I was on the balcony listening to the concert over the
water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who went into the bedchamber with the Duca Gherardi?" asked
the guests, and pale as snow they looked at each other above the
goblets of red champagne.</p>

<p>The air blew very chill from the sea and they all were silent
as if something passed through the room and out by the grand
entrance, then they rushed and broke open the bedchamber door;
there was no bride, but on the bridal couch lay Marco Gherardi
dead, and staining the white velvet coverlet was blood, for all
his wrist veins had been opened by a silver bodkin, such as women
use to pin their hair.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. HEROIC LANDSCAPE<br>
(RAINBOW ON THE BRENNER)</h2>

<p class="first">
THE letter was fumigated in the thick, pungent vapour arising
from the brazier; a lackey held it carefully by a long pair of
brass tongs; the scarlet wax of the seal began to soften and
slip.</p>

<p>The Margraf waited impatiently, his hands in the pockets of
his wide-skirted coat; behind him through the high arch of the
window showed thick pale clouds curdling in a heaven of intense
blue; against the swanlike soft whiteness of these pure vapours
darkened the purplish green of the pines, appearing as solid as
fine jade up the almost perpendicular sides of the mountain
ravines.</p>

<p>Schloss Stertzingen stood higher than even the highest pine,
and it stood beneath the loftiest peak of the Bavarian Alps.
Sabrina, curled up in the yellow-cushioned window-place waiting
for the Margraf to read his letter, felt dizzy when she looked
through the window at the deep precipice. The violet lake, the
dusty high road, the forest and pastures below, all appeared so
small that she could hide them with her extended thumb.</p>

<p>The huge upward sweep of the clouds increased her dizziness.
She was too light and easy a creature for the sombre and stately
solitude of Schloss Stertzingen; she yawned and raged inwardly
against the plague that kept her a prisoner in this high-set
loneliness. She watched the Margraf tear open impetuously the
fumigated letter.</p>

<p>Of course it was from Olympe von Hohenaschen, the woman he
loved; but she, Sabrina, and the plague held him prisoner in the
mountains.</p>

<p>Her triumph, however, did not compensate for her own
imprisonment or that chill, secret terror of the plague; almost
Olympe might have this rich, famous, powerful lover, if she,
Sabrina, could be free&mdash;free of Stertzingenof fear.</p>

<p>"News from Munich?" she asked teasingly. Since they had been
shut up together so long they frequently tormented one another,
she slily, he brutally. 'Soon there will be hate between us,' she
thought with dismal distaste.</p>

<p>The Margraf angrily threw the letter on the brazier, the
coarse red flame mounted above the compact glowing pastilles.</p>

<p>"Is she still unkind?" mocked Sabrina, turning her back on the
surge of the white clouds, the rigid darkness of the pines, the
long drop of the precipice.</p>

<p>The Margraf von Ohnspach disdained to rebuke her. Olympe had
written:</p>

<p>"Cease to importune me for paper avowals, if I should ever
think of you with favour I will apprise you of it when we meet.
I'll write no more."</p>

<p>A heavy bitter impatience weighed the spirits of Maximilian
von Ohnspach. This was the first woman to refuse him, the first
woman he had ever sincerely desired; rare, choice and difficult,
the Grafin von Hohenaschen was indifferent to any bribes he could
give, even to that of marriage, which he had been reduced to
offer; her wealth, her inaccessibility, her rank added to his
passion. The proud man who had disdained so many found himself
proudly disdained. He loathed to think that he must content
himself with such an easy piece as Sabrina, while the distant
Olympe repulsed him; yet if Sabrina had not chanced to be with
him in Stertzingen, how even more intolerably dull would his
imprisonment have been...</p>

<p>He sent for Johan Appenzel his bailiff; and demanded of him an
account of the progress of the epidemic. Castle and village were
beleaguered by death; on the plain, in the valley, in the city
the black plague was master.</p>

<p>Johan Appenzel had a grim answer:</p>

<p>"The post that brought Your Lordship's letters&mdash;and we
made him fling down his bag and stand ten yards away&mdash;says
the dead begin to lie unburied, only the monks go about freely,
as he saw them busy at a farm outside Brixen."</p>

<p>"So near as that," frowned the Margraf. He had been in duels,
in battles, in sudden perils, never before had he been
afraid.</p>

<p>Shut up in Stertzingen he lurked like a coward.</p>

<p>Johan Appenzel could read the grim expression on his master's
handsome face, he judged it the moment to urge his point:</p>

<p>"Sir, we await your orders, but it would be a sorry thing
after all our precaution, if we were to get the plague in
Stertzingen."</p>

<p>"Damn you, Appenzel, are we not entirely safe, cut off from
the world&mdash;perched up above it all?"</p>

<p>"Sir, you still receive letters. Yesterday, Kurt, the woodman,
tried to get his son, who has been working at Brixen, to return.
But the villages would not have him."</p>

<p>"All the roads, all the passes are to be closed," declared the
Margraf violently. "Put men with carbines at every entry to
Stertzingen, ay, along the high road, too. If anyone offers to
stop, warn them; if they endeavour to force an entrance, shoot
them. Ay, if it be a son returned to see a dying mother,
shoot!"</p>

<p>Johan Appenzel was pleased with these orders which he knew
would be well liked by the villagers; it was the wish of all to
keep themselves from the contagion of the plague. Did not even
the priest, praying near all day in his mountain church, applaud
this resolution?</p>

<p>"Your Lordship may be sure," he grinned, "that I shall attend
to your commands."</p>

<p>"Attend to them. As for letters, I will take none&mdash;let
the post pass to Brixen."</p>

<p>What interest had he in letters since Olympe had said she
would write no more?</p>

<p>He knew her for a woman who would keep her word&mdash;<i>"when
we meet"</i> she had written&mdash;was that flung as a taunt,
because she knew that he would not venture from the mountains
while the plague stalked the plains!...Well, was she not safe
herself in her elegant château, high as an eagle's eyrie on the
slopes of the Brenner?</p>

<p>"Johan Appenzel, we have plenty of everything&mdash;stores,
ammunition, fodder, wine?"</p>

<p>"In all Your Lordship may be abundantly furnished for months
to come."</p>

<p>"Months to come!" Sabrina laughed nervously, "this is like a
siege."</p>

<p>And she thought that never at any time since she began to
market her charms, had she been for so long in the possession of
one man; this idea of her forced fidelity made her laugh
again.</p>

<p>The Margraf scowled down at her, his arms akimbo.</p>

<p>"What have you to complain of? Well-housed, well-fed, pampered
beyond your value. Eh, if I had been free I had been rid of you
months ago."</p>

<p>"But not being free, why don't you love me?" The foolishness
of this made her laugh once more. "I mean, let us make the best
of it&mdash;shut your eyes and make believe that I am&mdash;" she
did not dare name the Grafin von Hohenaschen&mdash;"whoever you
choose."</p>

<p>"'Twere better if you said your prayers."</p>

<p>"Well, I would," said Sabrina, clasping her hands against her
rosy tender cheeks, "if it would be of any use. But do you think
that even prayers would avert an approaching doom?"</p>

<p>He did not like that and flung away; but she was after him,
clamouring and wailing.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me! In God's name! Don't you see that I am
horribly frightened? That I'm going mad through idleness and
waiting?"</p>

<p>These were his own sensations but he kept calm.</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Sabrina. I have taken every precaution. You
heard what I told Appenzel just now. Believe me, he will see
those orders are attended to. Everyone is as frightened as you
are."</p>

<p>"Except yourself," she whined. "You, of course, are afraid of
nothing."</p>

<p>He glanced at her savagely; did she dare to mock him, knowing
that no gentleman could admit cowardice?...but her shallow blue
eyes were candid.</p>

<p>She added cunningly:</p>

<p>"That is why I want you to stay with me. You are the only one
who has no fear. It gives me strength to be with you."</p>

<p>He put her by; he was appeased, not flattered; he saw he would
have to take a strong hand with her or she would become
intolerable.</p>

<p>He went out on to the terrace and gazed at the majestic,
sombre expanse of the spacious landscape, sweep of mighty cloud,
gigantic mountain, imposing forest.</p>

<p>In the distance sounded the steady rush of a water-break,
roaring in the blackness of the pines on the ravine.</p>

<p>The Margraf Max stood staunch and vigorous as the landscape,
which he suited very well. He too was dark and stately, erect and
graceful as becomes a man of war. He appeared able to affront any
calamity with equanimity. As he felt the strong wind blow on his
face and gazed at the tranquil splendour of the mountains on
which the clouds cast changing shadows of purple he was himself
astonished at that biting fear in his breast.</p>

<p>He who had dared bullet, fire, shot and mine without a tremor,
to have this timor because of the plague...</p>

<p>"'Tis an unclean death," he argued, to excuse himself, "but I
will keep it at bay, there is nothing to fear in Stertzingen,
nay, nothing to fear."</p>

<p>He left his castle that seemed a continuation of the living
rock and wound down a little to the church that stood on a
jutting crag above the mountain village.</p>

<p>Johan Appenzel had not been idle. The Margraf could see the
men with carbines ready guarding the pass down from the castle.
Half-concealed by the boulders they stared gloomily down at the
high road winding near the base of the mountain.</p>

<p>The priest was in his church with the bulbous cupola and thin
spire which looked like a dried metal lily-root. The graves
seemed crowded together, there was barely room for a tuft of lush
grass between each headstone. The Margraf had not noticed this
huddling of the dead before, yet there were no new inhabitants of
the churchyard.</p>

<p>The first shadow of the gloaming had fallen over the
mountains, slow gliding glooms of purple passed over the peaks,
the valley was deep in violet obscurity, the clouds were tinged
with a sulphurous bronze, the wind dropped, a closeness in the
air presaged a storm.</p>

<p>The priest welcomed the Margraf with due respect; as an army
chaplain he had, in his earlier years, come at some knowledge of
most men, and a great deal of men like Max of Ohnspach who was
now thirty-four years of age and at the height of his violent
passions, his power and his beauty.</p>

<p>They spoke about the plague and all the fearful tales that had
floated like a miasma up from the smitten plains.</p>

<p>"But after to-day," said the Margraf, "we shall hear nothing
more."</p>

<p>He told the priest of the measures he had taken to cut of
Stertzingen from the polluted world; the old man nodded
approvingly. They sat at the window of the living-room in the
priest's poor house and stared out at the landscape. Neither had
anything to do.</p>

<p>The priest thought of the soldier:</p>

<p>"'Tis odd to think he is afraid, a man like that, but, after
all, no doubt he has a good deal to lose."</p>

<p>And the soldier thought of the priest:</p>

<p>"He seems a wretched intermediary with heaven. Why should God
listen to a man like that, who has never in his life refused a
glass of good liquor?"</p>

<p>A few large drops of rain fell on the graves and glanced, like
thin frail lances, across the hollows and abysses of the darkling
mountains. A distant range that seemed infinitely far away was
edged with light. Neither of the men had anything to say, but
they were glad of each other's company, for neither dared show
the fear openly displayed by everyone else in the village and the
castle.</p>

<p>It was no comfort to be with one who had to affect
equanimity.</p>

<p>The Margraf drank some of the priest's wine which, being his
own gift, was excellent.</p>

<p>Leaning across the table, so that the last ragged light
gleamed in the bullion on his wide cuffs, he almost shouted: "How
the devil could the plague get into Stertzingen?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed the priest, swallowing another cup of fiery
Falernian. "How the devil&mdash;" then recollecting
himself&mdash;"I am sure it is God's intention to protect
us."</p>

<p>"You know nothing about it," declared the Margraf. "But my
carbines will see that we are not molested."</p>

<p>Beyond the graveyard was a crucifix under a penthouse, at the
base were offerings of mountain and beckside flowers, drooping in
withered garlands. A first flash of lightning showed the livid
feet of the Christ, streaming with blood, gleaming from the
twilight.</p>

<p>The priest seeing this, crossed himself; a despairing gloom
darkened his bloated face.</p>

<p>"After all, it is God's will," he stammered.</p>

<p>The Margraf rose violently, blasphemy trembled on his tongue.
He snatched up his cloak, his hat, and went out into the storm
which was yet far distant and seemed to thunder round the awful
summit of the Brenner.</p>

<p>Max of Ohnspach plunged into the lofty pine forest which
climbed the crest of the mountain, the rain spattered through the
blackish green of the flat boughs, the dashing plunge of the
waterfall sounded nearer, the red, tawny, pine needles were thick
beneath his feet. In the glimpses of the sky between the sombre
trees he could see sullenly advancing clouds which seemed but an
extravagant exaggeration of the grim outline of the
mountains.</p>

<p>The distant thunder grumbled, ringing him round like the
menace of advancing foes.</p>

<p>Scowling, he ascended through the wood to a little amber-
coloured alabaster temple built for summer, for music, for
dreaming; fluted pillars supported a circular roof, within was a
seat of violet-dark marble, onto this the first dry leaves of
summer had drifted like a discarded wreath.</p>

<p>The empty temple, on the verge of the empty wood and on the
edge of a wide ravine, was a solitude within a solitude.</p>

<p>The Margraf flung himself along the bench and stared across
the loneliness of the dark cleft in the mountain which was half-
lost in a sullen driftage of dense cloud.</p>

<p>He thought of Olympe...if she could have loved him, if she
could have been with him then, high in the intense isolation of
the mountain storm he believed that he would have died very
willingly on the morrow...this temple was dedicated to Venus
Anadyomene, but the goddess had fled.</p>

<p>Lying prone and biting his wrist above the cambric ruffles he
compared her perfections to the noble richness of the
landscape.</p>

<p>Her hair was glowing dark like the pines, her gait had the
majestic grace of the clouds passing over the abyss, her eyes
could flash with the brilliancy of the very fires of heaven, yet
withal, she was white, and small, and fragrant as the little
secret flowers the children found modestly concealed in the
mosses and ravished to weave into chaplets for the Virgin.</p>

<p>"If things go amiss between she and I, why should I make an
ado of living? One must have something besides meat and drink!
Why is the one delight most desired always impossible?"</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow, bit his nether lip to pallor
and frowned at the lightning-shot cloud drifting over the
blackness of the ravine.</p>

<p>"If one cannot be a demi-god, what is the use of any of it? To
miss the only woman one wants and to be afraid of the
plague&mdash;that is certainly very humiliating."</p>

<p>And anger, sharp as the shafts from heaven, blazed across his
face.</p>

<p>Sabrina was in her fine bed of chestnut wood when he returned
to the Schloss. She shrieked with joy to see him again, she had
believed him lost in the storm. Her room was softly bright with
fifty wax candles and the shutters were closed fast. The air was
hazed with the vapours from aromatics burning to keep off the
plague. Sabrina had her vinaigrette in her hand, and her pale
hair was stiffened with medicinal unguents.</p>

<p>"Why have you left me so long alone?" she lamented. "Is this
weather to be abroad on the mountain-side? Wandering in the
darkness of the storm you may even catch the plague from some
lurking wretch who tries to reach Stertzingen."</p>

<p>The Margraf Max sat on the bedstep and changed the theme. He
was angry with her for such a display of candles, coming in from
the fresh dark they bedazzled his eyes; besides, if she was
reckless, they might find themselves short of wax lights.</p>

<p>Then he sat tongue-tied while she glided from the bed, not
reluctant to show her figure rosy pink through the gauze shift,
and put out the lights in the girandoles.</p>

<p>He did not look at her. His face, clear-skinned from the pure
air, bore traces of a long-endured solitude; even Sabrina, as she
extinguished the last candle, stole a glance at him and thought:
"How lonely he is!"</p>

<p>Already it was late in the evening; Sabrina huddled into the
silken bedclothes and pressed her delicate head into the
swansdown pillows.</p>

<p>But the Margraf Max remained on the bedstep, awake in a
sitting posture. Presently she put out her hand timidly and felt
his thick locks on the coverlet. Fatigue had overcome him and his
head had sunk aside; sighing, she let him sleep; her own dreams
were not agreeable.</p>

<p>When she awoke in the early morning he had gone. She opened
the shutters herself, the prospect was pure azure sparkling with
light, a glittering brilliancy lay over everything. It was
impossible to believe that the plague was abroad in the plains,
the valleys, and the city.</p>

<p>Sabrina felt her empty heart fill with the joy of living. She
laced herself into a poppy-red silk.</p>

<p>"He is really more afraid of the plague than I am; how absurd
to think that he is in love with that stiff Olympe and will not
risk crossing the plains to get to her! While I, yes, I would
almost dare the infection to go to Munich for some new
clothes."</p>

<p>She sighed as she looked at herself twice seen in the double
mirrors surrounded by silver-gilt dolphins.</p>

<p>"What is the use of anything here? He cares nothing for me,
never notices what I wear, and even money is useless here.
Another long day! What on earth shall I do?"</p>

<p>She put her hand on the red satin smoothness of her waist and
swung round, displaying her trim figure.</p>

<p>"I am much prettier than Olympe, a man ought to be punished
for having such whims. He tried to tell me once there was a great
deal of difference between passion and love&mdash;what nonsense!
Even if there were Max would not know it."</p>

<p>Her pleasure in the bright day vanished, she sulked herself
into discontent.</p>

<p>When she came out onto the terrace, spreading her skirts like
a peacock's fan on the warm pavement, she looked in vain for the
Margraf.</p>

<p>He had gone early to one of the ravines that overlooked the
high road. His fear of the plague had increased, like a burden
growing hourly heavier it had become almost more than he could
endure. There were rumours that the horror was coming closer.
Last night, during the storm, a man had tried to get through the
cordon. But even during the sweeping rain the watchers had
crouched with lanterns in the shelter of ledges of rock, and the
man had fled before their threats.</p>

<p>"If anyone else tries you must shoot," said the Margraf. His
face was wan and his eyes were aching and swollen, he could not
see very clearly; the dazzle of the storm was still in the bright
air, the sky was of unbearable brilliancy, the whole firmament
glittered with points of light, the foliage on the mountain
slopes sparkled with large water drops from the rains of last
night, broken boughs cumbered the paths, all but the smallest
plants were prostrate.</p>

<p>Max of Ohnspach almost conquered his degrading fear which had
been so insupportable; he believed that he would, after all,
escape from this ridiculous position and live to enjoy the love
of Olympe, violently, if briefly.</p>

<p>Olympe was full of caprices and sudden passions, any day she
might decide to accept him, even to make a crazy obsession of the
affair. If only the plague would cease, or he was not too
cowardly to go to her.</p>

<p>He began to dream of the winter, when the foul disease would
be quenched beneath the pure weight of snow, when corruption
would be frozen, when the might of the cold would disperse the
miasma of the plague. He would be glad when the sun was hidden,
even for weeks together.</p>

<p>The landscape now lay as if exhausted under the steadily-
diffused blaze of noonday, the moisture from the storm was soon
evaporated and the air seemed opaque, it was hardly possible to
breathe. Behind the distant Brenner the tempest clouds were
sullenly advancing again, at present no more than a distant
oppression on the senses.</p>

<p>There were sounds of a tumult on the high road from Brixen to
Innspruck below, the Margraf and his men hurried down the ravine;
some desperate, impertinent fellow was endeavouring to enter
Stertzingen.</p>

<p>The sound of a shot made the Margraf hasten; his relaxed,
jangled nerves became taut, a frantic vexation of pain consumed
him. If someone should, despite all his precautions, bring the
plague into Stertzingen and cheat him of his future with
Olympe...</p>

<p>When he swung into view of the road he saw below his men
driving back two horsemen and a group of peasants throwing sticks
and stones. The impudent cavaliers were endeavouring to reach the
path that wound up to the Schloss, with their whips they made an
effort to defend themselves. Johan Appenzel was shouting abuse at
them. The Margraf called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, there, hullo!"</p>

<p>With savage curses Johan Appenzel yelled back that the
strangers were from Brixen where half the people were dead of the
plague and the other half dying&mdash;"And these two pretend they
want a shelter in the mountains and one of them looks already
ill."</p>

<p>The Margraf was profoundly moved with rage and hate. He
snatched the carbine from the man beside him and sprang lightly
down the rocks. The actors in the altercation on the road were
yet small shapes like figurines, like puppets, they did not seem
human. One of the cavaliers had fled, perhaps against his will;
his horse, struck with a stone, plunged along the Brixen road.
The peasants gave a yell of half-frightened elation as the
horseman disappeared in the golden purple distance towards the
abysses of violent shadow. But there remained the other, around
him the turbulence surged. He appeared as resolute to force his
way into Stertzingen as they to keep him out; even, the Margraf
thought, he laughed.</p>

<p>The priest had come panting down the slopes, he was uneasy and
dejected because of the storm and a sense of the futility of
prayers; the church had seemed to him as empty as the temple of
Venus Anadyomene had seemed to the Margraf.</p>

<p>"It may be the Devil," he stammered, "and we had better look
after ourselves, for I don't really think that God&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Margraf fired, he had taken very careful aim. The horseman
rolled from the saddle into the road made muddy by the storm.
Exultant, cruel shouts rose from the Stertzingeners. The
frightened horse galloped away towards Brixen. Max of Ohnspach
grinned up at the priest who sucked his lips nervously.</p>

<p>"Well done, well done! Now, if those rascals were just to tip
the body over the edge on the further side Your Excellency would
never hear any more of the matter."...</p>

<p>The Margraf lowered himself to the road. The horseman was on
his face, there were some gouts of blood on the road. The
peasants all stood back, no one would approach the corpse even to
push it over the black ravine which dropped the far side of the
highway.</p>

<p>"With a long pole," suggested the priest nervously, but the
keepers, woodmen and peasants, fearful of being asked to handle
the dead stranger, had slunk away.</p>

<p>"Let us leave the body," commanded the Margraf, eyeing the
priest maliciously, "unless you wish to say a few prayers. It
will serve as a warning to the next intruder."</p>

<p>At this moment the cavalier they had supposed dead heaved over
on his back in a last convulsion and expired.</p>

<p>The Margraf then saw that it was Olympe von Hohenaschen whom
he had murdered. The wilful, passionate woman, bored by her
monotonous confinement on the Brenner, had decided to disguise
herself as a cavalier and visit her lover. The Devil must surely
have guided his hand; he had not had time to ask her pardon...the
silence of his despair was almost ludicrous, the priest, terribly
upset, began to giggle.</p>

<p>There was something absurd in such a tragedy; besides it was
probably an error...</p>

<p>"Certainly the lad has a likeness to the Margravine of
Hohenaschen, but let Your Excellency consider that it cannot
possibly be she. I beseech you, sir," added the man of God who
felt that he was launching into a sermon, "to control yourself
and put black fancies out of your mind, and to think of the dear
little rosy golden love-bird waiting for you in the Schloss. As
for this body, how do you know that it is not infected with
plague? I should advise a long, stout pole&mdash;Good God! the
Margraf is taken ill!"</p>

<p>But instead of springing forward to help he retreated, for Max
of Ohnspach had thrown himself across the corpse, he was pallid-
grey and his brows were wrinkled; as he began to fumble open the
cravat of the dead cavalier the priest waddled yet farther away
up the mountain path. He was sure that beneath the ruffled curls,
under the small ears were the livid spots of the plague. Self-
possession deserted him, his hands hung powerless, he felt sick
as if he had touched a rat, he babbled prayers, but not for
long.</p>

<p>"You are a fool," he stammered. "What does it matter if that
is a woman or not, Olympe von Hohenaschen or not, as long as it
has the plague?"</p>

<p>The Margraf took no heed, he was prone on the body.</p>

<p>"He will be killed by his own fear," thought the priest,
climbing up to the church. "I wonder who, after all, it is! Just
the sort of amazing thing that woman would do, especially if she
felt ill."</p>

<p>To keep off any possible infection he drank a whole bottle of
Falernian when he reached his house, then he was so drunk that he
called in the sexton and they played dice on the communion
table.</p>

<p>The huge clouds advanced with an amazing suddenness over
Stertzingen, but only partially obscured the glare of the sun.
The priest and the sexton could see the swift violence of
unexpected rain through the narrow window of the little church,
and the pine wood, dark and wet, and beyond, the shining chaos of
lighter, higher clouds, lashed with the sheen of sunshine that
slanted through the rain. A perfume of fragrant dampness
dispelled the acid staleness of the incense odour in the church.
When the rain first fell on the hot gravestones there was a
stinging hiss and vapour rose.</p>

<p>They saw a man pass upwards through this storm, he walked with
vigour among the pines, yet slowly and with pauses, for he
carried someone on his back.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't so drunk," whispered the sexton, "I should have
thought that was our gracious lord the Margraf."</p>

<p>"You saw," the priest assured him, "nothing." But he himself
talked of the two figures going up the mountain.</p>

<p>How could it be the Margraf? Was he not of supernatural size,
gigantic? Could a mortal man have carried another up those
heights? Even carried a woman&mdash;a small woman?</p>

<p>"I hope," said the sexton, "you are not suggesting that they
are daemons? I never liked that temple up there to a heathen
witch and, between you and me "&mdash;he winked and
sniggered&mdash;"I pushed that naked figure over the ravine."</p>

<p>"Venus Anadyomene," whispered the priest regretfully.</p>

<p>"Who was she, reverent father?"</p>

<p>"Let her not be named," the priest sighed. "At the same time,
if things were only simpler, it might be very delicious up there,
in the storm, above the ravine."...</p>

<p>The sexton lumbered to the window. There certainly was a man
bearing another on his back, labouring up to the temple on the
summit; or perhaps he only thought so, for the incessant rain
hazed everything, like the fumes of the wine in his brain fused
good and evil.</p>

<p>Sabrina waited hopelessly for the Margraf. What was the use of
spreading one's skirts like a peacock's fan when there was no one
to admire? She was really utterly bored.</p>

<p>No one told her of the incident on the high road nor of the
disappearance of her master; some things were best ignored. God
be with us! all muttered to themselves.</p>

<p>Biting hot sunshine poured through the transparent rain as the
storm passed; green and purple, gold and azure, the monstrous
landscape, ravine and forest, peak and plain, gleamed through
fire and water.</p>

<p>Washed in every corner by rain the temple of Venus Anadyomene
remained empty. There were footprints round the edge of the
ravine, slipping smears in the wet grass and mud. After a while
the priest would put a wooden cross there, to keep off the evil
spirits. At the bottom of the crevasse the swollen waters roared
and foamed over the sharp rocks.</p>

<p>Sabrina could endure no more. She ordered out the carriage and
took the road to Munich. She found two servants quite willing to
go with her. After all, things could never be as they were once
at Schloss Stertzingen, one might as well try one's luck
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was flushed with an emerald-azure brilliance,
the unearthly white of the higher clouds swelled behind the smoky
tawny purple of the nearer vapours, beyond all was the piercing
blue of the sky.</p>

<p>Why had Sabrina fled so fast from Stertzingen that she had
forgotten to take any plunder with her?</p>

<p>As the light chariot sped, as if in a panic, down the way of
escape, a mighty rainbow leapt, in a sudden shining span, across
the Brenner.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. GRAF MAARTEN AND THE
IDIOT</h2>

<p><br>
THE packet from Calais was delayed by the storm. The December
night was dark when two passengers knocked at the door of The
Warden of the Channel and demanded supper, two horses, and a man
to bring their baggage to town.</p>

<p>The host had occasion afterwards to remember every detail of
this incident, which was peculiar enough to impress him
keenly.</p>

<p>"Sirs," said he, "you'll stay the night? It is dark, bad
weather, and the London coach starts to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"If you look at the calendar," replied the elder traveller
pleasantly, "you will see that the moon rises in an hour's time,
the storm is over, it will be a clear night&mdash;and it is our
wish," he added with great authority, "to proceed at once to
London."</p>

<p>As they sat in the parlour where the huge fire glowed and a
plentiful meal was served immediately, the landlord, while he
presided at the service, studied these two impatient
travellers.</p>

<p>They were foreigners and of high rank (so the landlord
thought) and were very handsomely attired in broad cloth, fur and
braid-trimmed coats; each kept with him a costly-looking
travelling case that contained, no doubt, valuables, and in the
hall were their saddlebags filled with valises.</p>

<p>The elder man was a man in middle life, of a very noble and
notable appearance, with a fiery energy in all he said and did,
yet with the control of perfect breeding; he showed the greatest
concern for his companion, who was still pale, sick, and uneasy
from the rough sea voyage, and who spoke very little but left
everything to the other.</p>

<p>He was very young, dark, slender, and, but for his air of
extreme languor, of attractive appearance. He sank on the settle
in the chimney corner, warming his hands and shivering, while his
companion supped heartily and now and then affectionately offered
him wine, coffee, and biscuits.</p>

<p>When he had satisfied a lusty appetite, the elder traveller
went to the window and pulled aside the thick curtains.</p>

<p>"There, you see," he exclaimed in English that had only a
slight accent. "It is a clear, still night."</p>

<p>It was true that the wind had dropped, the moon was rising,
and her rays sparkling in the snow drifts on the roofs of
Dover.</p>

<p>"You'll not get to London by the morning, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you will tell us the name of a post-house where we can
breakfast and get fresh horses? There is a reason in this speed,
my friend. I journey to see someone who is ill."</p>

<p>And with his eager, impatient, yet wholly agreeable air the
traveller went to inspect the mounts as they were brought into
the cold lamplit courtyard.</p>

<p>"And you have a packhorse and a groom?" he asked. "We travel,
in our great haste, without servants."</p>

<p>"I'm not well provided in that way, sir, not expecting
anything of the kind&mdash;there's only Joe, Moleskin Joe, as we
call him; he's dull, but stout and honest&mdash;I've had him here
ten years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt that he will do very well&mdash;I suppose that
your highways are safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it's a long time since there was a robbery on the
Dover Road."</p>

<p>"Good! But let your man be armed, as we are."</p>

<p>The gentleman returned to the parlour where his companion,
soothed by the wine and the warmth had fallen asleep on the
cushioned settle. The landlord, helping with the valises in the
hall, heard the two talking, the voice of the elder high above
that of the younger. Then they came out into the passage and the
dark young man was yawning and walking unsteadily, while the
other affectionately guided his steps.</p>

<p>Moleskin Joe was ready with the packhorse in the yard and the
elder traveller took the lantern from the landlord and looked
keenly at the servant whom he had engaged.</p>

<p>The ostler was a small, wiry man, with a stupid but candid,
good-natured face; he wore a cap and waistcoat of moleskins, sewn
by himself, and blinked a little in the frosty air for he had
just been roused from sleep.</p>

<p>"You'll do, fellow." The traveller turned away and took a
purse from his case. "How much for your fee?" And he displayed
English gold in neat rouleaux that sparkled in the lamplight.
Moleskin Joe stared at more money than he had ever seen before,
and the owner of this wealth laughed good-humouredly at his
amazement.</p>

<p>The clock in the courtyard struck ten as the traveller
mounted, the two gentlemen well wrapped against the cold, with
their pistols in their holsters, and Joe behind on a stout
roadster with the old-fashioned weapon his master had given him
in his belt.</p>

<p>The cold was intense, the blue moon clear as ice in the
bleached heavens, the snow on the roof of The Warden of the
Channel sparkled with millions of vivid crystals.</p>

<p>"We shall have a pleasant journey after all," smiled the elder
traveller. He seemed in high good spirits and the landlord
thought that he made a fine figure on Bessie, the big bay mare,
with the moonlight showing in clear light and shade his square-
cut face and rich appointments.</p>

<p>"You do not know who we are," he said suddenly, checking the
mare. "I am from Wurtemberg," and he gave a name that the
landlord tried in vain to understand or repeat. "Never mind! I
have a soubriquet&mdash;you translate it so&mdash;Idler&mdash;Mr.
Maarten Idler, then, if you please&mdash;" Laughing, he glanced
ahead at his companion who was already riding under the arch that
led to the street. "He is an Englishman, Mr. Peter Burnley, I met
him on the packet."</p>

<p>The landlord was surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, Your Honour, I must say that I thought he was a
foreigner, too, and you old friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! An utter stranger to me! I was sorry for him, he was so
ill&mdash;and seems in some trouble, and oddly, he has the same
need of haste as I&mdash;but for what reason I do not know."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that it is very good natured in you, sir, to look
after him, he seems very down."</p>

<p>At this the traveller laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I give you these explanations in case anyone inquires after
me&mdash;my servants will follow in a day or so, your horses and
your man will be returned to you from London. I shall be lodging
in Cork Street&mdash;good night, and thank you."</p>

<p>The landlord, hat in hand, watched the heavy horseman also
ride away under the shadow of the arch. The night was quiet,
unnaturally so, it seemed, after the late fury of the storm; the
waves, not having spent their tumult, were yet lashing at the
foot of the high cliffs. And from this disturbed ocean there
suddenly blew a breath so icy that the landlord shivered to the
heart, vowing that such a freezing still air was worse than any
biting wind.</p>

<p>As he turned gladly into the warm house he could faintly hear
the sound of the hoofs on the cobbles as the three riders took
their way into the clear, cold night&mdash;the handsome foreigner
who had given the odd name of Maarten Idler, the sick Englishman,
and Moleskin Joe with the luggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ransome, wife of the owner of Three Ashes farm, was
sitting up that night over a low fire in her comfortable kitchen;
she had an aching tooth that kept her awake and she continually
poulticed her face from a pot of simmering mess on the hob. A
small lamp stood on the high mantelshelf. This left the room in
shadow. The house was silent, and Mrs. Ransome, her pain eased,
was dozing off in her cosy chintz-covered chair when she was
roused by a thundering rat-a-tat on the front door which sent her
to her feet with an unpleasant start.</p>

<p>She glanced instinctively at the tall clock with the wreath of
faded blue flowers on the face, that stood in the corner; through
the shadows she could just make out the time&mdash;nearly
midnight.</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" she exclaimed as the knock was repeated, for
Three Ashes stood back from the road in a lonely stretch of the
Dover highway. So, before she went to the door she called out for
her husband, and despite the repeated knocks, waited till he
appeared. Then the man and wife looked cautiously over the chain
into the bare moonlit lane. They saw a tall figure, dark against
the pure light of the brilliant moon, anger and despair were in
his face and gesture as he chid them for their delay; he was
hatless and his black hair hung tangled on his brow.</p>

<p>"There's been murder!" he cried, pointing to the direction of
the road. "Help! Quickly! It may be possible to save the life of
my friend."</p>

<p>While the farmer, trembling with excitement and some fear,
flung on his clothes and shouted up his farm-hands, the stranger,
with an accent of agony, told his story.</p>

<p>He and his friend had been riding from Dover to London with a
hired man, proceeding slowly, for the roads were hard with frost,
when, on this lonely stretch, the servant had suddenly turned on
them with intent to murder and to rob. He had pulled out his
pistol, and without warning, shot one of the travellers through
the back and had been about to grapple with the other when he,
the narrator, had struck him with the butt end of his pistol and
left him for dead.</p>

<p>"If I've killed the rogue it is no matter&mdash;I only hope
that we can save that poor young man&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the little party from Three Ashes reached the long, bare
road, white beneath the lustrous, serene moon, they found the
baggage horse standing drowsy beside the sprawling bodies. One
was that of the young Englishman who had been so ill on crossing
from Calais the day before, the other was Moleskin Joe.</p>

<p>The first was a fearful sight; not only had he been shot, but,
as his companion explained, in falling from the saddle he had
been kicked by the frightened horse, which had then plunged away
towards Dover.</p>

<p>"He's not only dead, you can't see what he was like, poor
soul," whispered Mr. Ransome; and he was glad to leave that
shattered head, that slim body, in the rich clothes with the
outstretched arms to attend to the servant, who lay face
downwards near the ditch.</p>

<p>But the surviving traveller stood for a full minute gazing at
that mutilated face, a horrible clot of battered flesh flung back
in the long dark hair, through which the blood soaked on to the
hard road. And as he did so a contortion between a grin and a
frown passed over his own sombre features and he muttered some
passionate sentences that the others took to be a prayer in a
foreign tongue.</p>

<p>"I should not," he added in English, "have let the wretch see
the gold&mdash;my carelessness has cost this poor fellow his
life!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ransome and his men were looking with alarmed curiosity at
the body of the other man.</p>

<p>"He'll live to answer for it, sir, he's coming
round&mdash;we'd better take him to the farm&mdash;I'll send
someone to the village for the constable&mdash;better cover that
one up, sir, he's an ugly sight, poor gentleman."</p>

<p>"He lives? The villain lives? See that he does not
escape&mdash;" The foreigner took his fine linen handkerchief
from his pocket and laid it over what had been the face of the
dead man. An icy stir of air began to freeze the blood on the
trampled road.</p>

<p>When Moleskin Joe stood his trial for murder a curious
circumstance connected with the case came to light. It was
impossible to identify the murdered man. His companion could give
no information about him; he had met him on the Dover packet and
a certain friendliness had grown up between them during the
storm, and he had been interested in the young man because he was
travelling alone, and though of obvious rank, seemed sick and
distressed, and said that his errand was one of great
urgency.</p>

<p>Beyond that he had said he was an Englishman and his name was
Peter Burnley, he had given no clue as to his identity, nor did
an examination of his body and his effects provide any hint as to
who he might be or what his errand was. No one claimed him, no
man of his rank was missing, no one of the name of Burnley (and
several such were found) had any knowledge of the murdered
stranger. No papers, passport, or letters were discovered in his
case (it was supposed that he had cast all such documents into
the fire of the parlour of The Warden of the Channel), there was
no name in his hat or clothes. It had to be assumed that he was
some adventurer, travelling under an assumed name on some dubious
errand. It was his travelling companion who paid for the grave
where he was laid in a Maidstone churchyard.</p>

<p>About this personage, the handsome German who good-humouredly
allowed himself to be known as Maarten Idler, there was no
mystery whatever. The Graf Maarten von I was well known both in
his own country and in England; his credentials were
unimpeachable, all his life known, his name illustrious, his
fortune considerable. If he were credited with a certain
wildness, an adventurous youth, a flamboyant war service against
the Turks, nothing had ever been said of him that did not add a
lustre to the brilliant reputation of a great gentleman.</p>

<p>His splendid appearance, his candid manner, his generous
horror at the tragedy of the Dover Road, greatly impressed the
jury at the Assizes.</p>

<p>Robust, richly dressed, with his air at once noble and
charming, he was a complete contrast to the wretched figure of
the prisoner who, in his moleskin waistcoat and shabby coat,
bandaged head and pallid face, stood, without hope, in the
dock.</p>

<p>He had always been dull, and the blow he had received seemed
to have further confused his faculties so that he made no great
show of defending himself, but stupidly repeated that he had not
killed the gentleman, but what had happened he could not say.</p>

<p>"I don't remember, sir," he answered to all the questions that
were asked of him. Patiently, with neither protest nor complaint,
he awaited his fate. Now and then his vacant eyes glimmered with
a faint intelligence, and that was when they turned a glance on
the superb gentleman whose evidence was sending him to the
gallows, a baffled glance, full of a puzzled curiosity.</p>

<p>On one point only was the Graf Maarten reserved&mdash;that was
the reason for his hasty visit to England, his travelling without
servants, his setting forth so strangely late on a winter's
night. He would admit no more than:</p>

<p>"Someone very dear to me fell ill in London. When I heard the
news I could not restrain myself&mdash;must I give the name? It
is that of a lady."</p>

<p>His chivalry was respected, the more so as it became generally
known who the lady was&mdash;Emily Dennison, daughter of the late
Resident at Wurtemberg, then lying ill at her father's house in
Golden Square, and believed to be secretly betrothed to the Graf
Maarten.</p>

<p>On a dull winter afternoon, when the thick twilight that
invaded the court was only scattered by the yellow rays of the
oil-lamp above the Judge's head, Moleskin Joe was sentenced to
death.</p>

<p>He made no protest, there was no one to speak for him, since
he was without relations, friends, or means, and none felt any
pity for the man who, out of brutal cupidity, had tried to murder
two strangers, and had succeeded in murdering one of them, a man
whose youth, rank, mysterious personality, and hideous end
aroused the keenest interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>For one second Moleskin Joe, when asked what he had to say
after the death sentence, became animated, as if about to speak
violently; he clasped tightly the dirty rail of the dock, and
stared, not at the Judge, but at Graf Maarten, who returned this
look with the indifference of utter contempt.</p>

<p>But the condemned man did not speak, the tension of his
attitude relaxed, an expression of imbecility veiled his face as
the warders seized him, and a little sigh of relief went up from
the people in the court because of an ugly business ended.</p>

<p>A common lodging-house faced the prison before which Moleskin
Joe was to be hanged. On the snowy morning of his punishment a
group of curious people gathered in the upper room of this house
and peered through the soiled window panes. The snow was falling
slowly, in large flakes that showed white against the grey sky,
the dark outline of the prison, and the darker outline of the
gallows.</p>

<p>In lowered voices (they knew not why) the squalid company
discussed the mystery of the murdered man, and the stupid
obstinacy of the murderer. Something terrible, mysterious, and
alarming about this useless crime held even these coarse and
callous sightseers in awe; the women thought of the new grave
where the lonely stranger lay with his secret buried, as it
seemed, for ever with him, and the men thought of Moleskin Joe
who had lived nearly forty years obscure and harmless, and now
was about to be damned for a cowardly deed of blood.</p>

<p>As the prisoner appeared at the prison gates the door of the
upper room in the lodging-house opened and Maarten Idler (as he
was known to all English people) entered with a gold piece in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I will pay this for a chance to see this rogue turned
off."</p>

<p>They made way for him, his broadcloth brushed their shabby
suits as the landlady clutched the fee. All looked at him with
some embarrassment, he was so splendid, had such an air of
command; they believed that he was, in his own country, a
prince.</p>

<p>As Moleskin Joe mounted stiffly he ladder to the gallows, Graf
Maarten explained why he wished to be present at so ghastly a
ceremony.</p>

<p>"I can't get the fellow out of my mind. I fear that scene on
the Dover Road is printed for ever on my heart. I wake up at
night, sweating, thinking I see poor M. Peter Burnley stretched
out in his blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>Moleskin Joe paused on the ladder, and bending down, spoke
vehemently to the hangman, as if a sudden desperate thought had
come into his mind.</p>

<p>Observing this, Graf Maarten pushed open the casement,
regardless of the driving snowflakes, and thrust out his head and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is going to confess."</p>

<p>"They often do, sir, at the last minute."</p>

<p>The shivering, excited people pressed close behind the German
who, resting his hands on the sill, watched Moleskin Joe turn
again and mount the gallows step, the hangman behind him.</p>

<p>The condemned man was facing the window from which Graf
Maarten leant, and, as the noose was adjusted round his neck, and
the hangman descended from the ladder, he tore the handkerchief
from his eyes and stared directly across at the German, who
returned his awful look with an unwavering stare.</p>

<p>Before even the ladder was taken away and he began to kick and
struggle amid the softly falling snow, the face of the ostler was
terrible to see, yellow and contorted beneath the dirty bandages
on his brow, with a coarse growth of greying beard and eyes
injected with blood.</p>

<p>The women shrank back from the window, some of the men lowered
their gaze, but Graf Maarten stared until his sight was confused
by the snowflakes passing, hesitating, floating downwards, and
the face of the dying man seemed to swing forward until he was
grinning at the window-sill, face to face with his accuser.</p>

<p>Graf Maarten spoke to the hangman.</p>

<p>"Did the fellow confess?"</p>

<p>"Not he, your honour&mdash;nor would he say a word to the
chaplain. He was dumb to the last, and then it was only a
foolishness."</p>

<p>"What foolishness?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, he said that he had a sister, a maid-servant in
London, and that she looked to him for all."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"He asked me if I'd see that some charitable soul took his
place towards her&mdash;she knows nothing of his horrid end, he
said."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;' there was someone here would do it&mdash;and
that it was his legacy, all he left'. And then, as he went up the
ladder&mdash;' that the hand of God was in it '."</p>

<p>Graf Maarten knelt by Emily Dennison's couch; her thin hands
rested lightly on his thick dark ringlets. She was much touched
by the devotion with which, when he had heard of her illness, he
had hastened across Europe and much moved by the horrible crime
in which he, entirely through his imprudent haste on her account,
had nearly lost his life.</p>

<p>"Will you marry me, Emily? You know that never have I desired
anything so much."</p>

<p>She was flattered by the intense, almost bitter sincerity (as
if the man resented his own bondage to this need for her) that
lay behind these ordinary words, and she was minded to yield to
him, at last; her illness had exhausted her and there seemed all
she had lacked, health, strength, passion, in his eager love, so
ardently offered.</p>

<p>"There seemed some barrier between us in Germany," she mused,
"but that, I think, has gone now."</p>

<p>He answered, with a strength that made her shrink as before a
menace:</p>

<p>"You should have loved me before&mdash;what was wrong with me
that I could not have amended? Before you all my life
paused."</p>

<p>She tried to laugh away his dark earnestness. Laughing or
languishing she was as fair as a water lily, and something even
more lovely than herself was about her like an aroma&mdash;a
memory, a perfume, a promise, unearthly sweet...</p>

<p>"Maarten, you cannot blame me for hesitating&mdash;all my
friends advised me against you! Idler! Is not that your name! You
have done so much, been so brilliant&mdash;yet, unstable
always!"</p>

<p>"I had not found you, my lode star."</p>

<p>The English girl smiled, looking at him kindly, yet not with
complete surrender. He rose and his great height blotted out the
light from her silver fairness, which became ghostly in the
shadow.</p>

<p>"Was it young Adalbrecht who stood between us?" he asked, and
she pitied the difficulty he had with the name. "I do not know.
Perhaps&mdash;but he has gone, has he not?"</p>

<p>"He went to Persia with the last Embassy. A good post. He was
always ambitious."</p>

<p>"Stand a little aside, Maarten. I want to see the light."</p>

<p>"There is so little, only snow flakes against the
pane&mdash;come away with me to Provence, to Italy."</p>

<p>"Maarten&mdash;you did not contrive for Adalbrecht to go to
the East?"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, no. I can swear it."</p>

<p>She sighed, and her slim fingers twined in the long, pale
curls on the muslins about her bosom.</p>

<p>"I will be frank with you, Maarten. When I was in Wurtemberg I
did not, at first, know my own mind&mdash;first it was you, then
it was Adalbrecht&mdash;and then, at last, when we had to return
to England&mdash;I thought that it was he." With a charming
innocent frankness she added thoughtfully, "He asked me before I
left if I cared for him&mdash;I could not be sure, but I
thought&mdash;surely, 'tis he&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off with another sigh, yet smiled too, though
wistfully.</p>

<p>"He has gone, my darling; he did not wait for your answer. And
I have heard that his father makes a match for him with the
Margraf von P 's daughter. I always thought him light."</p>

<p>"So did not I!" her voice quivered. "But let it go&mdash;as he
has gone. I wish him happiness."</p>

<p>"But what for me, my darling, what for me?"</p>

<p>"My father should ask you this, but I will do it
myself&mdash;Maarten, I heard that you and Adalbrecht's young
sister were promised before ever I came to Wurtemberg&mdash;and
that upon your leaving of her, she died."</p>

<p>"It is a lie; what evil will not gossips do with their evil
tongues!"</p>

<p>"I will take your word, Maarten. It was but a hint I heard,
and I could never believe it."</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing between us? No doubt, no shadow?"</p>

<p>He bent towards her as he spoke, and before her gentle face
came the vision of a drift of snowflakes and the grimacing visage
of Moleskin Joe swinging close to his own as he had seen it swing
from the gallows when he leant from the window in Maidstone.</p>

<p>"Save me, my darling, from myself, from this useless, this
futile life that I lead&mdash;from this no man's land where my
soul seems to wander stark, so lonely, so lonely&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was shuddering on his knees beside her again and she
regarded him with trust and compassion; she thought that if her
own life were to be absorbed into this other life so tumultuous,
brilliant, and strange, it would be a sweet fulfilment of her
vague dreams and half unconfessed longings.</p>

<p>"I, too, am lonely, Maarten. But wait awhile. I am very tired.
Leave me in quiet for a few more days."</p>

<p>Graf Maarten kissed her hands humbly, promising obedience to
her least whims. It was as he was about to leave that he spoke of
a subject that Miss Dennison had hoped never to hear mentioned
again.</p>

<p>"That man who was hanged for the Dover Road murder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Maarten, need we think of that?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask your advice. This wretch was quite poor and
friendless. He had one sister. When he was on the&mdash;at the
last, he asked if anyone would look to her. He said that the hand
of God was in it."</p>

<p>"There is no one else? And you think that you should do
this?"</p>

<p>"How quickly you catch my thought&mdash;she is a maidservant
in London. I have her address from the Dover landlord. Remember
that she is quite innocent&mdash;a little foolish in her
intellect, and alone."</p>

<p>The whole subject filled Miss Dennison with unutterable
horror, she wished to forget it for ever, but mastering her
repugnance she said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I think that you&mdash;that we&mdash;should do
something at least, see that she is comfortable."</p>

<p>Bella, the sister of Moleskin Joe, lived in Mrs. Curie's house
at Uxbridge; she had been there for many years, a patient but
taciturn and stupid servant, who gave no trouble and whose wage
was very low.</p>

<p>Mrs. Curle did not read the news-sheets, and when Bella asked
her if she could guess the reason why her brother had not come to
London that Christmas the lady could not answer. She was
surprised, for she had noted the affection between brother and
sister. Neither could read nor write, but Joe came to Uxbridge
twice a year, and sent little presents and messages by the Dover
mail. When Mrs. Curie inquired from The Warden of the Channel she
soon learned the cause of Moleskin Joe's silence, and she was so
profoundly shocked that she could not, for a while, bring herself
to say a word to Bella.</p>

<p>But at last, being a religious woman, she felt it her duty to
do so. She summoned Bella into the parlour that looked on to the
large garden with the high brick wall; above this the bare boughs
of a plane tree tossed against the scudding clouds, rooks cawed
amid the interlacing twigs and large drops of rain fell heavily
on the frost-bitten grass. The room where Mrs. Curie sat with her
Bible on her knees was full of a cold, grey light, more gloomy
than any shadow.</p>

<p>The lady's mind was uneasily occupied by the tale of the
murder on the lonely midnight winter road; there was something
horrifying and mysterious in all the circumstances of the crime,
and Mrs. Curie wondered very much, as so many others had
wondered, as to the identity of the richly dressed stranger who
lay in a Maidstone churchyard with "Peter Burnley" and one date
on his flat stone.</p>

<p>When Bella came in, Mrs. Curie told her, with much compassion,
the dreadful story.</p>

<p>The girl seemed (and this was horrible to her mistress) to be
neither surprised nor shocked, she stood twisting her hands in
her apron and repeating that she had seen her brother in a dream,
and that he had told her "That he had never done it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Curie looked sadly at the poor creature who had always
been almost half-witted, and feared that this disaster had
completely turned her feeble brain, for she seemed to show
neither sorrow nor dismay, but rather a sly, lunatic and
malignant self-communing. So that Mrs. Curle, for the first time,
felt a horrid distrust of one who was, after all, sister to a
brutal murderer, and resolved to be quickly rid of her. The rain
began to slash steadily on the glass Bella had polished that
morning; the bare boughs made a deep soughing and the grey clouds
darkened down to a storm. Sharply Mrs. Curie bade the girl
withdraw to the kitchen and keep her story from the other
servants.</p>

<p>"He never did it," muttered Bella. She was much younger than
her brother, and had an unwholesome beauty, white, smooth
features, and harsh red hair that showed in broken ruddy gold
through her cambric cap; her eyes were like her brother's, their
expression was of a bewildered resignation, a patient submission
to inscrutable tyrannies.</p>

<p>As she left her mistress the bell rang and she went
mechanically to the front door; Graf Maarten was on the step and
the wind and rain made havoc in his cloak and hair. He knew her
at once, and asked her if she would step into the garden and
speak with him, which she did without question and despite the
weather.</p>

<p>Mrs. Curie from the window, watched curiously her servant and
this splendid stranger, walking up and down under this tumult of
grey clouds, the rooks and bare boughs of the plane tree behind
them, the rain slanting on their faces, which were turned one to
the other.</p>

<p>The Graf von I told the girl who he was, and of his desire to
help her since he respected a dying man's last wish, even if that
man were a murderer.</p>

<p>"He never did it, sir."</p>

<p>"I was there and saw it. But he has been punished and I would
not have you suffer, who are innocent."</p>

<p>"As he was, sir, innocent."</p>

<p>"To say so is to flout all sense and prove yourself witless.
Come, as I have you on my conscience, as a Christian, what can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I am very well with Madame Curle."</p>

<p>"Why, good-bye, then, and I'll think no more of it."</p>

<p>They parted at the tall iron gates in the high wall; the
clouds were flying so low that it seemed as if, any second, they
would swoop down and encompass those two windblown figures. He
hastened to his carriage and was driven to the house of Sir
Arthur Dennison and she returned to tell her dull tale to her
mistress, who much commended the generous chivalry of the wealthy
foreigner, the more so as she found it highly convenient. For she
had decided, after the strangeness of Bella's late behaviour,
that she could not possibly live with her any longer in the
lonely house in Uxbridge.</p>

<p>Moleskin Joe's sister came in a scurry of snow and waited at
the area door of the Graf Maarten's opulent house in Cork Street.
Mrs. Curle, she said to the servant who opened to her, would keep
her no longer, could she have a place in the establishment of the
gentleman who, alone of all the world, had promised her
kindness?</p>

<p>The other woman allowed her to sit by the kitchen fire, but,
when she had heard her story, rebuked her sharply.</p>

<p>"How can you come here? Your brother tried to murder this
gentleman, too, and it was <i>his</i> evidence hanged
him&mdash;I'd go elsewhere if I were you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've nowhere to go. I was bound to come here."</p>

<p>Graf von I was with the lady to whom he had just been
betrothed, as the public prints announced that day, and it was
late before he returned to his expensive hired house.</p>

<p>He found Bella, with her patient resigned look and her red
hair falling from under her bonnet, waiting at the foot of the
stairs, the other servants not being very willing to have her
company.</p>

<p>He had never expected to see her again, yet she was so
insignificant that his start and exclaim at the sight of her
amazed even himself.</p>

<p>"I have nowhere to go, sir, might I stay here? I work very
well, Mrs. Curle will speak for me."</p>

<p>He stood looking at her across the dim light of the hall lamp;
he thought as of a refuge and a haven of the woman whom he had
just left with joy, love and comfort in their farewells.</p>

<p>"This is but a hired establishment," he said, "I shall send
you to Sir Arthur Dennison&mdash;he will find a place for you.
Miss Emily will be kind to you."</p>

<p>"What have I to do with her? You'll let me stay here,
sir?"</p>

<p>The Graf Maarten muttered:</p>

<p>"What matter is any of this?" He went aside to his room and
rang for the housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Find that poor girl a bed and a place in the house. I am
bound to help her."</p>

<p>"Your honour is too generous&mdash;you don't know what you're
taking in."</p>

<p>"What could I be taking in but a miserable wretch who has no
other refuge!"</p>

<p>"God guard us, sir, it is the sister of a murderer, and a
queer creature herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden fury disturbed the calm of Maarten Idler's good
manners.</p>

<p>"Are you not here to do my bidding? Why do you dare to
question me? Look after the girl."</p>

<p>That night a tumult of wind and rain broke over London.
Maarten Idler could not sleep in his well-appointed bedchamber.
He turned and tossed, restless, fevered, but it was not of his
sweet beloved from whom he had parted so kindly a little before
that he thought; a great chaos of snowflakes seemed to fill the
firelit chamber and through them swung the dying face of Moleskin
Joe, gasping on the gallows.</p>

<p>Neither could Emily Dennison sleep that dreadful night of
tempest, twice she sprang out of bed, confused by evil dreams in
which someone whom she could not reach had passionately implored
her help.</p>

<p>"Maarten! Maarten! Is it you?"</p>

<p>When no answer came out of the turmoil of the storm she wept
for fear.</p>

<p>"You have changed, Maarten, you are ill, something is
troubling you."</p>

<p>He denied this, but with a weary impatience that startled her;
she seemed to have lost her power over him, he was no longer
engrossed by his love for her, nor was she able easily to soothe
him; Emily Dennison felt unhappiness creeping over her in slow
tide of misery. This man's passion had been all of reality she
had had in a world where she felt herself out of harmony with
common events.</p>

<p>"A man may be forgiven for being uneasy," he replied sullenly.
"When he has been party to an ugly murder."</p>

<p>She was surprised that he should still think of that and
mention it to her; he was not young, he had had many adventures,
he had been in fierce battles and witnessed, she was sure, many
scenes of blood and horror.</p>

<p>"It is over," she replied gently.</p>

<p>"No! It is only just beginning."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the effect of it&mdash;on me&mdash;is only just
beginning&mdash;I dream of it, at night, as soon as I fall asleep
I see again that bare road, the sparkling frost on the hedges,
the cold sky&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Maarten, do not dwell on it." Miss Dennison shuddered,
thinking of the night of the monstrous storm, when she had heard,
she thought, a voice crying to her for help&mdash;was it the
voice of Maarten or that of another, one far away, who had
forsaken her?</p>

<p>"You have done what you could, Maarten, for that poor
girl?"</p>

<p>"She has her brother's eyes." He turned to Emily Dennison
impetuously. "Will you not marry me at once and go with me to
Italy?"</p>

<p>"We are to be married in June, Maarten, I cannot be ready
before." She could not, a few days past, have given this answer,
but she was estranged from him by his late abstracted coldness;
she was, too, profoundly disappointed by the flaring out&mdash;as
it seemed&mdash;of that passion that had held her enthralled by
its heat and light. She saw that he needed her, but
intermittently, as if she were a shield that he snatched at now
and then in some dark desperation, as a defence against some
terror unknown to her. So she refused him, and not without
pain.</p>

<p>He took this rebuff with a resignation that stung her; where,
she wondered, was the ardour which had flung him across Europe on
the news of her illness?</p>

<p>"You must have your wish," he answered, and then added,
strangely, "June will be too late."</p>

<p>"For what, Maarten?"</p>

<p>"For my salvation," he replied, smiling, but not with an air
of gallantry.</p>

<p>He always met her, sitting at the foot of the stairs when he
came home&mdash;later and later every night, for daily he more
avoided that house in Cork Street that he had hired with such
pleasure. As he could not bring himself to mention her he could
not complain of her conduct, and she took no heed of his angry
commands to keep "out of his sight." Indeed, she never said
anything to him at all, save, occasionally, "He never did it,"
with a look from those resigned eyes that were so like the eyes
of Moleskin Joe, swinging forward, staring, in the contorted,
snow-swept face that dangled from the gallows.</p>

<p>Once, when he came in late, not radiant from the kisses of
Emily Dennison, but drunk from a gambling hell, he found her
polishing with a dirty cloth the newel post of the handsome
stairway. She peered at him over her shoulder and gave a giggling
laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't you begin to see them, sir?" Then she answered his dark
frown of horror: "Who? Them two, Joe and the young
gentleman&mdash;at first they were no bigger than my hand, but
every day they grow larger. What will happen when they are life
size, sir?"</p>

<p>Graf Maarten turned into his private room; whatever time he
spent in the house he now passed locked into this chamber. He had
brandy in his desk and he drank heavily to dull further his
fuddled senses, but he could not shut out from his mind what she
had said, nor from his ears the sound of her slow steps going up
and down the passage outside his door.</p>

<p>"If I ignore her," he whispered to himself in the silent
shadows, "surely in time she will cease to exist and I shall be
free. Can I ever undo my mistake? Why did I ever meddle with the
girl? Oh, God, am I a haunted man?"</p>

<p>But he could not believe that all his cleverness, boldness,
and great daring had failed&mdash;because of what? An act of
kindness.</p>

<p>The storms were fearful that year; the winter was prolonged
unduly, and impatient tempests, destroying as they passed, shook
the faith of man in God. Maarten Idler began to disappear from
among his usual companions and even Sir Arthur Dennison was
forced to rebuke him for his neglect of Emily. The reply of the
German was at once so sullen and so careless that the other began
to ponder whether or no he were wise to give his daughter to this
man whose devotion seemed to have so capriciously flagged. It
was, no doubt, a brilliant match for a simple English
gentlewoman, but Sir Arthur Dennison began to turn over rather
uneasily in his mind reports of the reckless wildness of the
youth of Graf Maarten&mdash;and tales&mdash;tales.</p>

<p>The girl herself had no comment to make on her lover's
behaviour; she became, thus deprived of the support of that
passion which she had timidly stretched out to reach, intensely
self-centred; the voices of the living came to her from a great
distance and seemed muffled, and among them she heard, every day
more frequently, that cry of a spirit that appealed to her for
help. And she became absorbed in endeavouring to discover if it
were the voice of Maarten Idler.</p>

<p>In a few weeks he was defeated. He himself scarcely knew the
ravaged features that he beheld in his mirror as those of the
confident, handsome man who had ridden out of Dover with Moleskin
Joe behind him; his hands trembled in whatever task they
undertook and he drank much strong coffee to keep him awake at
night.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, when the church bells were sounding
through the wind and rain, he heard a knock on the door of his
private room, where he sat locked in alone.</p>

<p>"Very well, my girl, very well," he answered, grinning. "I am
coming."</p>

<p>He lit a candle, for he had been in the dark since the
daylight had failed, and drew out a sheet of paper from his
portfolio. As the candle flamed, spluttered up on the cold wax he
began to write:</p>

<p>"He should not have dogged me. As soon as he did that he knew
that I was bound to kill him. I sent him to the East to be out of
the way, but he must come slinking back. He was sure that Emily
preferred him, and he threatened to tell her of the business with
his sister. I knew that she would think that I had behaved very
badly there. Women cannot understand how all the rules of society
fret a man of spirit. Why did I stake so much on the love of
Emily? I think of her now with indifference. He would come with
me to England. I, knowing what was before us both if he insisted,
tried to shake him off. But, even when he fell sick, he was
obstinate. It was during the storm at sea that the idea came to
me. When I saw the groom I knew that I was safe. No one would be
concerned to vindicate him. I killed Adalbrecht on the loneliest
stretch of road that I could find, I thought that I had killed
the servant also, I had plenty of time to mutilate <i>his</i>
face, take all his papers and take his name out of his clothes.
No one thought of searching me, of questioning me, I was above
suspicion from the first. I had prepared the way at Dover, when I
told the landlord that lie about his being an Englishman of the
name of Peter Burnley&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Graf Maarten had been writing very quickly, now and then
he paused to listen to the repeated knocking, very low and
steady, on the door.</p>

<p>"Why should I write any more?" he muttered. "They would never
have thought of looking for Adalbrecht in an English grave. They
believe that he has disappeared in the East. If I had never gone
to the execution&mdash;if I had left the girl alone!"</p>

<p>He sighed, rose, and went to the door. Bella was there,
waiting patiently, as he had known she would be, with a service
of coffee on a lacquer tray.</p>

<p>"Come in and put that down," then, as she obeyed, "I shall not
need it to-night. I am going on a long journey.</p>

<p>"To Maidstone? Isn't it Maidstone?"</p>

<p>"They are both buried there, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you seen them lately?"</p>

<p>"You know what it would mean when they grow to full height,
sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he noticed that she wore a moleskin waistcoat over
her calico dress, under her neat apron.</p>

<p>"Did that belong to your brother?"</p>

<p>"The hangman sent it to me. Joe was innocent."</p>

<p>"Take this paper. I am going."</p>

<p>"I cannot read, sir."</p>

<p>"Give it to the police. Wait, I have not signed it." He wrote
his strange name over the confession, and took up his hat. Bella
regarded him stupidly.</p>

<p>"Have you got your pistols, sir?"</p>

<p>"You do well to remind me. I must be far away before anyone
reads that paper. Farewell, Emily Dennison!" he added, without
regret.</p>

<p>He went quietly out of the house. The rain had ceased, and
high above the narrow house the spectral glimmer of the moon
showed in a curdle of dead white cloud.</p>

<p>With his pistol primed, Maarten Idler rode towards Maidstone.
He rejoiced at the thought of the liberty before him. When,
kneeling on the stone incised with the false name of "Peter
Burnley," he should put the cold muzzle of the weapon that had
murdered the man lying beneath, on to his own forehead, he could
escape from the girl with her brother's eyes and from that face
of Moleskin Joe swinging out into the snowflakes.</p>

<p>Emily Dennison did not know if it were the murdered or the
murderer who had cried out to her for help. She turned her face
from the world and lived upon memories. People thought it strange
that this tragic crime should come to light through the means of
an idiot girl. It was the hangman who remembered that Moleskin
Joe had said "There was the hand of God in it."</p>

<h3>A Fragment from the Memoirs of a Lacquey in Noble
Employment</h3>

<p class="first"><br>
MY LORDS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:&mdash;</p>

<p>I once heard a fat fellow in a play exclaim&mdash;"Oh, the
brave things I've seen! But death is certain;" a cowardly
sentiment. I have seen many brave things but without being
troubled by the thought of the certainty of death, which event I
was prudently careful to postpone to a period when extreme old
age would make me indifferent to all the allurements of the
world.</p>

<p>My master, that great and glorious hero, Prince François
Eugéne, often used to say: "Neither God nor Politicks is any
business of a soldier; it is the <i>métier</i> of the Deity to
reward us according to our merits, and of the Politicians to
provide the broils which give us our opportunities, let us leave
it at that."</p>

<p>It was one of the principles of this noble Conqueror never to
inquire into the causes, ethics, rights or wrongs of any quarrel
in which he was engaged. "Our business," he would declare, "is to
beat our enemies and make as much money as possible out of our
friends, and I would take it as a kind of baseness to inquire
into what any War is about."</p>

<p>But this Prince, wise as he was brave, put on another tone
when he was addressing his men, and then was careful to adopt
sentiments suited to their low, brutish and dull intellects,
always telling them how truth, honour and justice lay on their
side, that they fought for the noblest cause in the world for
which they should be cheerfully willing to lay down their lives
(or even forgo their pay) and such was his eloquence that you
would see his dragoons, wounded, starved, diseased, rejoicing
after a victory as lustily as if the rewards had been in their
pockets instead of in his&mdash;a <i>great man!</i></p>

<p>Great, too, was the magnificent Duke of Marlborough. I made
his career my peculiar study and contrived to discover many
astounding particulars of his early life which illustrate his
extraordinary genius, the world fitted him like a hand to a
glove; nothing ever annoyed or disgusted him and he found an
opportunity in everything; he was besides the most civil man
alive and could flatter the most obstinate stiffneck or the most
awkward fool into complacency and self-satisfaction&mdash;what
gifts! I ventured once, when he did me the honour to speak with
me (as he often did, when coming into my master's tent to save
the expense of an entertainment in his own) to suggest to him
that part of his success lay in a just estimate of the weaknesses
of mankind. "Nay, my dear Sfacciato," His Grace was pleased to
reply, "a man's weaknesses can take care of themselves, leave his
vices alone and make an attack on his virtues, and then you'll
discover he has none, and so all is clear between you, and you
may be very good friends."</p>

<p>His Grace had better natural advantages than my master; his
person was in the first degree handsome and he was as fearless in
the cabinet or the ball-room as in the field; never did he even
contemplate the possibility of making a false step; whereas my
noble master, Prince Eugène, was a little dry and stiff save
during a campaign, and would often, at meal-times, have the
kettle-drums beaten to avoid conversation.</p>

<p>His Grace also showed better parts in his dealings with women;
cursed with a plain sister he yet contrived for her to fall down
before the Duke of York and display a fine pair of ankles in
modish green stockings, these same stockings being his gift and a
fine investment, for the lady, having thus attracted the
attention of the Royal Prince (whose wits and taste were none of
the best) managed to get so close into his regards as to
influence him to promote her brother in the Guards.</p>

<p>My master would not have been adroit enough to make a conquest
of a King's mistress, arrange that His Majesty interrupted a
conversation in the lady's bedroom, jump from the window and so
win five hundred pounds as an expression of her gratitude, which
would go towards his rise in the Army, for His Grace of Marlboro'
plainly perceived that as Europe was like to be in a perpetual
ferment, many glorious laurels might be culled by a man of his
address and ability.</p>

<p>I had, too, the honour of the acquaintance of his noble
friend, the Duke of Chandos who, having nothing to start with
(like His Grace of Marlborough) but natural genius rose to be
Paymaster to Her Majesty's forces and had sufficient talents to
amass three million sterling beyond his due, and this after
paying a handsome percentage to His Grace of Marlborough who, by
representing him to the Queen (a simple creature) as a patriot as
honest as himself, kept him in a post that many would have paid
high to have gotten into.</p>

<p>The two of them, like the dauntless noble heroes they were,
contrived to weather even a <i>Parliamentary Inquiry into the
National Accounts,</i> which some dull, envious pedant set on
foot, and by a serene air of conscious virtue and a steady
refusal to answer questions (injurious, so they declared, to the
nicety of their honour) escaped a direct censure. If they
incurred the cloudy suspicions of the narrow-minded, they
certainly received the plaudits of the vulgar, for whom they had
obtained such glorious brilliant victories in a war that was no
concern of England but in which thousands of Englishmen had had
the wonderful chance of being cut to pieces in the service of
these two mighty Dukes (one a Caesar, one a Maecenas) who were
assuredly the brightest ornaments (always excepting my master)
known to this or any other Age.</p>

<p>The Prince of Savoy moved in a freer ambient; I have often
heard him congratulate himself, that not being in the service of
his own country he was not obliged to assume an air of
patriotism, and because the Court of Vienna, which employed him,
was in no position to ask for his accounts.</p>

<p>He too became vastly rich and built the most wonderful palaces
in the world, fit for the most considerable hero in Europe; the
Duke of Chandos also cut a figure but not to the same extent
owing to the petulant jealousy of the foggy islanders among whom
it was his misfortune to live and who would peevishly question as
to the source of so much wealth.</p>

<p>But nothing hampered my master; he would sign away provinces
as other men would farms, give away diamond necklaces as freely
(and for the same end) as an ensign gives promises of marriage;
distribute halters and ribbons with the greatest impartiality,
dictate to the Emperor and sup with a circle of reigning princes
about his table. He was very liberal to those who pleased him and
very extravagant in pleasing himself; in this he differed
considerably from His Grace of Marlborough, who had two strange
qualities for a great man; firstly, he was avaricious, secondly,
he was faithful to his wife.</p>

<p>My master, a loyal friend, would make no comment on these
failings, save "'Tis a pity," but I had the honour to be present
when His Grace showed my master, in a tobacco box, the very first
guineas he had ever earned, relating how he had left 'em
untouched even when short of coach hire, or the price of a bottle
of wine. I saw that my master, though civil, thought such boasts
ill-bred and secretly recalled the difference between Jack
Churchill, a country esquire, and François Eugène, a Prince of
the House of Savoy (or possibly of even a more illustrious
family).</p>

<p>But I must leave these reflections which the splendour of my
subject inspires and proceed to commit to paper some of the
episodes of these brilliant careers which led directly to the
Pavilion of Honour; how fortunate have I (Arlequino Sfacciato,
son of the meanest barber in Mantua) been in my association with
such great heroes who had given the world such shining examples
of the lustre human genius can attain!</p>

<p>But, let me restrain these encomiums and give proof that they
are based on truth; I will begin by setting down my first
acquaintance with my glorious master, Prince Eugène of Savoy and,
craving my patrons' patience, I will relate how Olympia Mancini,
Comtesse de Soissons, poisoned the Queen of Spain in a dish of
oysters, and the encouraging effect of this on the career of my
young Prince.</p>

<p>I will not here burden a reader (eager to be presented to my
heroes) with any personal details of my ignoble self, but will
merely state that in the year 1679 I was a cook-boy in the
kitchens of the Alcazà in Madrid, which was then the residence of
His Most Christian Majesty Don Carlos II of Spain.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy court; the King was an imbecile and the Queen
was a saint; the sole exercise of the courtiers was yawning so
that their jaws became developed at the expense of the rest of
their persons. His Majesty would play spillikens for hours, and
food was so scarce that the cooks were forced to lock the silver
tureen covers for fear the pages should steal the meat on the
stairs.</p>

<p>I despise the Spaniards, they appear to think there is no way
of living but work or poverty and so, preferring poverty, sink
into abject misery. What ignorance!</p>

<p>I soon saw that this was no place for one of my activity.</p>

<p>"My career," I said to myself, abstracting the succulent
portions of the <i>O11a Podrida</i> while the cook was watering
the Royal soup, "will never be made in the Alcazà."</p>

<p>How mistaken even the wisest can be!</p>

<p>Fortune was then hurrying towards me with outstretched hands;
I make bold to say I deserved her favours, for though (I take no
shame to relate) a mere scullion, I had two virtues&mdash;I kept
myself clean and I never lost heart.</p>

<p>To add to our miseries that year there was a glut of melons
and the quantity of these gross vegetables coming to His
Majesty's notice, he must insist on a great preserve-making
(though sugar was scarce and dear, the last consignment from the
New World having been run into Amsterdam and sold there by the
Admiral in charge of the convoy) and all the kitchens were aswim
with sticky liquor, and slices and parings of melons, and
courtiers coming down (having nothing worse to do) to try new
flavours, such as sassafras, cinnamon, calomel and suchlike
outlandish herbs, "to tempt," as they said, "His Majesty's
palate." But well they knew that he had been born without one;
this tincturing and doctoring of melons was but an excuse for a
cheap amusement (but none to me, who had the scraping, scouring
and polishing of pans and ladles as my share of the
diversion).</p>

<p>However, God be praised, all comes well in the end to a man of
spirit (as my father used to say) and if you miss the beard you
spare the pimples (this on a complaint of a tufted hairiness left
on a customer's chin), and this foolery with conserves led to a
direct change in the course of my life.</p>

<p>The Spaniards are not a talkative race, being aware that their
thoughts are not worth the labour of speech, but whenever they
did speak I was listening.</p>

<p>And so I heard of the arrival of the Comtesse de Soissons (a
noble French lady on her travels) at the Alcazà.</p>

<p>If you live among servants you have a vast amount of
information about ladies like Madame de Soissons, whose bad
health or bad luck force them to be perpetually travelling.</p>

<p>The Comtesse (I knew) was born Olympia Mancini, niece to the
great Cardinal Mazarin; she had the loveliest face, the worst
temper and the most obliging husband in the world, yet hardly the
wit to make the best of these great advantages (as had Her Grace
of Marlborough who was equally blessed).</p>

<p>She was married to Eugène Maurice, Comte de Soissons, General
of the Swiss and Grisons, son of the Prince de Carignan; she had
nothing to complain of in the conduct of this gentleman who gave
his name (if nothing else) to a family about as numerous as his
wife's lovers, and only once allowing himself the remark: "that
his wife's loyalty to the throne was such that she had contrived
to give her son François Eugène an extraordinary likeness to His
Majesty."</p>

<p>My honoured master had indeed the Bourbon outline, but far be
it from me to defile these pages with mere scandal.</p>

<p>Therefore I shall write nothing of the reasons for the
withdrawal of Madame de Soissons (her lord being insignificantly
dead) from the Court where she was esteemed by all who had the
honour of her conversation; she took with her François Eugène,
who so little favoured the House of Savoy.</p>

<p>The vulgar must have their nose in the affair and talk of this
noble lady's implication in the poisoning mystery of "La Voisin,"
suggesting she had been involved in an attempt (in some jealous
fit) to doctor His Majesty's posset&mdash;what nonsense! How
absurd the rumours the credulous believe!</p>

<p>Never shall I forget my first sight of Madame de Soissons; she
came sauntering into the kitchens and spoke to the Duque de
L&mdash;&mdash; (the kind of man of whom no one hears until he
commits suicide out of boredom at being so ignored, even by the
Devil) accompanied by my dear future master. Eagerly I sought in
his person traces of his Jovian origin; he certainly bore no
outward likeness at least to the House of Savoy, nor did the most
spiteful ever accuse Madame de Soissons' husband of being the
father of any of her children, and I at once detected something
regal in that long countenance, that arched nose, that blue gaze
so impressively blank, that Austrian lower lip and jaw, those
ringlets of chestnut-black hair. At once this young Prince
excited my liveliest admiration, though he was penniless, in a
manner discredited and not above seventeen years old.</p>

<p>Which admiration was further increased when I (only by the
closest scrutiny) observed him abstract, with a technique that
bespoke the future great tactician, a large portion of the supper
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>"Here, Sfacciato," said I to myself, "is thy future
master!"</p>

<p>What a beautiful woman was his mother! What a shape, a wrist,
an ankle, what a snowy skin, what glossy curls of raven black!
Withal there was something perilous in her eyes; one felt that it
would be dangerous to gaze too long at these dazzling charms.</p>

<p>"What," I asked myself, "is this magnificent creature doing at
this gloomy, pauper, miserable Court?"</p>

<p>I was soon to know and that in a lucky hour for myself.</p>

<p>Don Carlos II (the last of his line and hopeless of heirs) was
extremely plagued as to the disposition of his kingdoms; France
working for a Bourbon Prince and the rest of Europe for anyone
else, by preference an Austrian Archduke.</p>

<p>Now His Majesty, though detesting France and naturally
inclined to the Emperor, was held completely to the Bourbons by
his wife, the lovely Maria Luisa; what a saint! If there be no
Heaven she for one will have just cause of complaint, for no one
ever worked harder for celestial bliss; the games of spillikens
that angelic woman played with her husband!</p>

<p>Olympia Mancini, glancing about the kitchens, spied me, and
asked in our native tongue if I was Italian?</p>

<p>She was then pleased to add that I was too clean and agile for
a scullion and should be a page.</p>

<p>"But I perceive," she sighed, "that merit is no passport to
promotion in Spain."</p>

<p>As I held the pan of sugar for her (she was affecting to make
conserves) I ventured to assure her that I had no hope of fortune
in the Alcazà.</p>

<p>"And you, Madame," I insinuated, "are surely wasting your
opportunities by lingering here?"</p>

<p>"I have never, child, wasted anything, but there are those who
have wasted me," she added with a thoughtful cast. "I have the
fortunes of my poor boy to make. I wish to obtain for him a
commission in the Imperial service, and that without influence is
difficult."</p>

<p>I realised then how ruined she was and my heart went out to
the widow and the orphan. I also realised that she was probably
an Austrian spy and had some good reason for this graciousness to
a cook-boy.</p>

<p>"I daresay you are bold and unscrupulous," she smiled as I
sliced the melon for her (I flushed with pleasure, surely my good
angel was hovering very near!); "and not above taking a
chance&mdash;a risk?"</p>

<p>"The first, yes, Madame. The second, no."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said she, delighted, "one must never take risks, all
must be a certainty."</p>

<p>Upon this the young Eugène remarked, in a melancholy fashion
"that he wished she had always been so prudent, and that she
seemed to have taken risks enough in the past."</p>

<p>"I was very inexperienced and lacked good advice, but if I
don't get you a commission in the Imperial Army in a few days you
have my leave to upbraid me."</p>

<p>But the boy seemed to make very little of his hopes: he was
the younger son of a younger son, "and all the Princes of the
Empire clamouring for the only posts worth a gentleman's
acceptance," as he remarked with a shrewdness admirable for his
tender years.</p>

<p>"My son," replied Madame de Soissons, "was destined for the
Church and applied himself to all that is requisite to be known
by a person of that profession, but he is fired with too noble
and generous an ambition for such a career and hopes to do some
good in the world."</p>

<p>I bowed at this confidence, but the young hero, who perfectly
understood the Italian tongue, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"To be sure, my dear mother, you are a little too intriguing,
and have even," he added with a laugh, "been accused of
witchcraft by those who are no great conjurers themselves," (for
this compliment she gave him a tap with her fan); "but as for
you, my lad," he addressed me with this gracious familiarity,
though some years younger and a head shorter than myself, "I
believe you are such a fellow as I am looking for as a body
servant. You appear (said he) lively, clean and adroit."</p>

<p>"Necessary qualities," added Madame de Soissons. "Since we can
pay no wages we must have one who can recompense himself by the
exercise of his own wits."</p>

<p>"Such a post," said I with enthusiasm, "would suit me to
perfection."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" smiled my new master. And his mother questioned with
a look I did not greatly care to encounter: "We may count on your
fidelity?"</p>

<p>"Madame," replied I, with a bow copied from the stiffest of
the Hidalgos, "I have always passionately devoted myself to my
own best interests, and I feel sure, were I in the service of a
lady of your wit, these would coincide with an absolute fidelity
to you."</p>

<p>Her smile showed me her famous dimples.</p>

<p>"You require neither menaces nor warning," she remarked.
"Courage, my child, you may yet live to keep the back stairs in a
noble establishment. I shall beg that you wait on us to-night,
when I sup privately with the Queen."</p>

<p>His Majesty's establishment, tho' rigorous, was poverty-
stricken, and the favour of Madame de Soissons gained me rapid
promotion to an unpaid post, and I was allowed to help serve the
dishes in the apartments of the Queen of Spain on that evening,
an evening I shall always remember. For how can a man forget that
spin of fortune which whirls him to the top of his desires?</p>

<p>The visit of Madame de Soissons was the most exciting event
that had ever happened to the Queen since she had come to Spain.
She had gossiped for hours with the French lady about the
delicious world she had left behind, and about Monseigneur the
Dauphin, whom she had loved and hoped to marry before she was
sacrificed to an ambitious politick, how my heart had always bled
at the thought of this poor pretty creature!</p>

<p>I had never seen her before; she was not allowed to show
herself even at a window, and never went abroad.</p>

<p>As I brought in the first covers I felt decidedly nervous, but
a glance from Madame de Soissons encouraged me; I felt I had a
protectress in that lady.</p>

<p>Although we were all unpaid and starving and neither the King
nor the grandees had a <i>maravedi</i> in their pockets, the
Alcazà contained half the wealth of the Indies and the New World;
this room was lit by a candelabra of rock crystal, the dining
table was of gold and malachite, the Queen sat on blue satin
cushions in a chair of massy silver.</p>

<p>I contrived to glance at her; tho' she was of an active,
lively disposition, she had not been permitted to do anything
(because of Spanish etiquette) since her marriage, and so had
become plump through lying in bed and eating sweetmeats in a
shuttered room.</p>

<p>She remained lovely, however, and her magnificent chestnut
hair (a gift from her Stewart mother) hung to her waist braided
with the purest of pearls; never had I seen such gems as
glittered on her <i>corsage</i> and on her snowy arms.</p>

<p>Madame de Soissons was seated beside her; their gold-
embroidered skirts made one glitter of billowing folds and they
talked in French, which His Majesty had never learnt.</p>

<p>This personage was playing spillikens with my master (as I
already named him) and it was admirable to see how the youth,
full of ambition and flaming ardours, constrained himself to flip
the ivory counters to and fro His Majesty.</p>

<p>What a figure Don Carlos cut in his outmoded clothes, his
pallid hair tucked behind his ears, his huge starched collar
sticking out like a platter, his long face with eyes that were
never quite open and a mouth that was never quite shut!</p>

<p>I looked with admiration at the Queen; what a saint! What a
patriot! She had endured this imbecile for years merely to secure
the Spanish succession for France: I observed how fond a husband
he was, he continually stared at her with a gaping affection,
like a dog for his master; it was plain to see he was an
idiot.</p>

<p>Madame de Soissons was admiring the Queen's pearls as I handed
the covers; such lustre, such colour!</p>

<p>"But has Your Majesty perceived the glancing hues in
oystershell mother o' pearl? An even brighter rainbow glory, I
swear!" Then, turning to me, "Arlequino, bid them fetch up a dish
of oysters!"</p>

<p>The Queen smiled; she was always agreeable and she liked
oysters; I noted, in the dark tapestry behind her, the figure of
a giant with a raised club; he seemed exactly as if he were about
to strike her pretty head.</p>

<p>I fetched the oysters with my own hands and, as I came up the
private stairway with them, I met Madame de Soissons.</p>

<p>"Boy," she whispered, "I want to prove to the Queen how vivid
are the tints in these shells, and I have a lotion here will make
them more brilliant."</p>

<p>I found it cold in that chill private way but contrived not to
shiver as she brought a phial from her bosom and inserted the
rosy drops into the finest of the oysters.</p>

<p>"How fortunate," she murmured, "that the Queen is young and
strong, for if she were to die, King Louis would lose the Spanish
succession."</p>

<p>Her glance met mine; I endeavoured to look resolute. "The
Emperor," she added, "is poor. But for some services he would pay
very well."</p>

<p>"Even a miserable cook-boy, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Even my son's <i>valet-de-chambre,</i> child. See to it that
Her Majesty hath the finest oyster."</p>

<p>I was awed; my elevation into the great world had been so
sudden as to afflict me with giddiness; when I bore that dish
into the royal presence, when I glanced at the fair young Queen
and the adoration in her husband's gaze I felt a sinking of the
spirits.</p>

<p>I was considering what would be my fate if my part in this
brilliant <i>coup d'état</i> was discovered.</p>

<p>Madame de Soissons and the Queen were laughing over the
oysters, comparing the gleaming lining of the shells with the
pearls; the Queen was so happy to be with a Frenchwoman that she
was talking a great deal of nonsense.</p>

<p>The King, absently flicking the spillikens, still gazed at his
wife with a touching devotion, and my young master looked more
and more impatient, but kept his temper admirably.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was oppressive; the crystal candelabra
glittered too much and those figures in the tapestry appeared of
alarming proportions. I kept my eyes on the covers I was serving.
I heard Madame de Soissons reading to the Queen out of the
<i>Gazette de France</i> she had been (she said) to fetch, and
then Her Majesty say:</p>

<p>"He strangled a parrot of mine because it spoke French."</p>

<p>The King began to yawn; François Eugène looked at his mother;
I looked at the dish of oysters; the two largest shells were
empty, their colours were certainly beautiful, the Spanish make
furniture of mother o' pearl but I have always had a distaste for
this material.</p>

<p>Through an open door I could see the Duennas asleep, their
yellow faces daubed with rouge; my fellow-page, a knock-kneed
youth, was staring at the beauty of Madame de Soissons, who was
dressed in the French fashion, very outrageous to the formal
taste and prejudices of these wretched Spaniards. The sound of
the spillikens was the only noise, for everyone seemed to become
drowsy in that warm, shadowed room; I felt my own heart beating
fast, I am ashamed to say, but then this was my first taste of
<i>la haute monde,</i> and I was very young.</p>

<p>Sinking back on her cushions the Queen whispered dreamily:</p>

<p>"Madame, tell me more of Paris, of Versailles, of
Marli&mdash;of civilisation!"</p>

<p>The King stammered suddenly, with a green look of jealousy:
"Speak Spanish!"</p>

<p>A draught (what a place the Alcazà was for draughts!) bellied
out the tapestry, so that the snarling giants, black warriors and
ferocious beasts seemed to come right into the room.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed Her Majesty in her own tongue, "I
have such a pain at my heart!"</p>

<p>"'Tis home-sickness for France, Madame," smiled Madame de
Soissons, "'twould be a charity to relieve you from this terrible
life&mdash;what boredom!"</p>

<p>The King rose, stumbling; he loathed everything French; the
Queen had not been allowed to speak that language for years, he
suspected all manner of insults from Madame de Soissons'
smile.</p>

<p>The spillikens board clattered to the ground and with an
adroit secret contempt, my young master pushed it with his toe
into the fire, whilst he glowered at me with all the scorn of the
man of action for a dull evening.</p>

<p>How all my devotion went out to him! Everything was to be
expected from such composure, such a carriage and the Bourbon
outline.</p>

<p>The Queen said hysterically:</p>

<p>"He threw my little dog To-To downstairs and broke his neck
because he came from Paris, but I have always, even under
torment, been true to France; yes, tell His Majesty King Louis
that I have worked for France."</p>

<p>Don Carlos approached her, slobbering in imbecile rage: "Speak
Spanish!"</p>

<p>Her Majesty began to scream; though I was expecting it, I
confess I was a little startled at the rapid change in her; poor
woman! She had certainly done her best for her country and lived
the life of a saint, but such must not expect rewards on earth
for these things.</p>

<p>Everyone ran to support her, she wrenched and writhed in their
arms, some of her pearl chains broke in her struggles, I gathered
them up, no one took any notice of me.</p>

<p>Don Carlos was on his knees, whimpering like a beaten monkey;
even in her agony she gave him a kind look and patted his sleek
flaxen head.</p>

<p>"When I am dead," she murmured, "keep true to France."</p>

<p>His grief and her courage were quite affecting; I was glad
when she was carried to her chamber, he wailing by her side; I
was always soft-hearted.</p>

<p>"Pick up those oyster shells," Madame de Soissons commanded
me, "and throw them on the fire."</p>

<p>She frightened me, she seemed to have grown a head taller, her
air was one of swelling majesty; there could no longer be any
doubt that it would be perilous to admire or even to serve her; I
resolved to persuade my young master to have very little to do
with his mother.</p>

<p>He was now, I observed, a little pale, and I offered him a
glass of Tokai.</p>

<p>"The Queen being taken so ill," he observed, "had we not,
Madame, better withdraw from the Alcazà?"</p>

<p>"We will go to the Imperial Embassy, my child, and inform the
Envoy that he may select an Austrian wife for this imbecile. And
that the power of France in Spain is extinct."</p>

<p>"And my commission, Madame?" asked the young hero, avid for
future glories.</p>

<p>"We are assured of that, my child, and a few rewards besides."
She gathered up Her Majesty's blue velvet cloak which had fallen
during the struggles of the dying woman, and put it round her
shoulders. "Swear to me one thing," the handsome termagant
snatched her son by his slim shoulder, "do all the mischief you
ever can to King Louis&mdash;remember, he refused you even a
miserable captaincy, offered to make you an Abbé, and allowed me
to be banished as a poisoner! What stupid stuff!"</p>

<p>"Stupid, indeed, Madame," replied the bold youth, "and I will
see it is avenged. Meanwhile had we better not leave the
Alcazà?"</p>

<p>"Your advice is good," said she. "Come, cook-boy, you have
been quite useful."</p>

<p>"And may be of further service." I showed them a napkin full
of gold spoons, <i>bonbon</i> dishes and the Queen's pearls which
I had gathered up since we had been left alone; they commended
me, she hid the booty under her stolen cloak: "And now run!" said
she.</p>

<p>We ran; never had the dark, monstrous corridors of the Alcazà
seemed so long, we had to keep slipping aside into black alcoves
and deserted chambers to avoid a jostle of monks, priests,
doctors, with lights, relics and medicines.</p>

<p>What a confusion! Everyone seemed to have lost their
heads.</p>

<p>I knew of a private door; we escaped into the gardens where an
arid wind rustled the dry trees. The palace looked bleak as a
bone in the bitter moonlight.</p>

<p>"What a climate!" shuddered Madame de Soissons. We found the
Imperial coach waiting, the Imperial Envoy, yellow with
expectancy, within.</p>

<p>"'Tis done," remarked Madame de Soissons. She certainly was
dangerous, in the moonlight her face seemed shaped like an
antique busto of a Fury. "King Louis will have cause to regret
having vexed Olympia Mancini."</p>

<p>The Envoy rubbed his beak of a nose and seemed scared; he kept
opening his mouth without speaking.</p>

<p>"She's dead, you fool," said the Frenchwoman, "let me in and
tell them to drive like Hell."</p>

<p>That roused him, he pulled wide the door, the Soissons swept
into the coach with my napkin of plunder, her son followed with
the expressionless stare of the truly great, I leaped on to the
outboard behind, the Envoy shouted directions.</p>

<p>We certainly drove <i>le tombeau ouvert</i> and the streets
were most ill-paved; I, clinging to the straps, was confoundedly
uncomfortable, with the wind whistling round my thin borrowed
stockings and my limbs bruised with every jerk of the carriage;
but I consoled myself with the reflection that (if I were
prudent) my fortune was made.</p>
