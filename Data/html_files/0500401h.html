  <h2><a name="Prologue"
     id="prol">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">George Hare (of Hare, Briggs, Burton, and Kurtnitz) met
  Carey Arundel for the first time at the annual Critics' Dinner at Verino's.
  She was to receive a plaque for the best actress performance of the year,
  Greg Wilson was to get the actor's, and Paul Saffron the director's. These
  dinners were rather stuffy affairs, but the awards were worth getting; this
  year Morning Journey was the picture that had swept the board, all the
  winners having scored in it. George had seen the picture and thought it good,
  if a trifle tricky. He was far more concerned with his luck in being next to
  Carey at the dinner, for his own well-concealed importance in the movie world
  did not always receive such rewards. George had an eye for beauty which,
  combined with a somewhat cynical nose for fame, made him take special notice
  of her. Of course he had seen her on the stage as well as on the screen, but
  he thought she looked best of all in real life&mdash;which meant, even more
  remarkably, that she looked really alive at a party such as this, not merely
  brought to life by ambition or liquor.</p>

  <p>George left her to her other neighbour for a while; he was lazy socially,
  content often to talk with those who would seek him out, which many people
  did, liking him personally and eager for any titbit of scandal that might
  slip from his legally acquired store. He never spilled anything worth much,
  but always seemed about to, and nobody realized that he picked up far more
  than he let drop. He was so shrewd in business that people thought his air of
  innocence could not possibly be real, but there was a sense in which it was,
  and thus he often fooled and foiled his adversaries. It was this innocence
  that had made him say, when introduced to Carey at the table: "You played in
  Boston once when I was at Harvard&mdash;I can't remember the play, but I
  couldn't forget YOU." She had laughed, and somebody who had overheard said
  later that nobody had ever pinned an age on an actress more securely (though
  that had not been George's intention at all). But now, turning to him again
  more than half-way through the meal, she said: "I think it must have been
  Quality Street you saw me in, Mr. Hare."</p>

  <p>George was surprised she had even caught his name, and this was not
  modesty so much as an awareness that in a community where big names are a
  dime a dozen, some of the higher price tags are on the big nameless.</p>

  <p>He said: "That's right, so it was."</p>

  <p>"Because I don't believe I ever played in Boston in anything else. Not in
  those days."</p>

  <p>"Not so very long ago," he commented gallantly.</p>

  <p>"Twenty years."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "What does it feel like to be a well-known actress all that
  time and then have people behave out here as if they'd discovered you?"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "It's funny."</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll tell them that in your speech."</p>

  <p>She seemed a little perturbed. "Oh, do I have to make a speech?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we all hope you will. But it needn't be a long one. Do speeches
  make you nervous?"</p>

  <p>"Other people's do, occasionally." He thought it was just a witticism till
  she added: "Paul's especially, Paul Saffron&mdash;the director. He can be so
  tactless." She went on hastily: "No, I'm not exactly scared to speak in
  public, but I find it much harder than acting. Perhaps that only means I find
  it hard to act the part of myself."</p>

  <p>"Ethel Barrymore once told me practically the same thing." He proceeded to
  compliment her on Morning Journey, her first picture and such a success, and
  she thanked him with a genuine pleasure that lit her face like a girl's, but
  with life rather than mere youthfulness. George wondered (as one always must
  with an actress) whether the transfigurement was natural or a practised
  artifice; frankly he could not judge, and admiringly he did not care&mdash;
  it was quite remarkable either way.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you won't go back to the stage again," he said, and continued:
  "I say that because I hope you will."</p>

  <p>"I might."</p>

  <p>"But first, I suppose, another picture?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've no plans for that. I've no definite plans for anything, except
  perhaps a vacation in Ireland... By the way, Mr. Hare, you're the lawyer,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"THE lawyer? Let's settle for A lawyer."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you could help me."</p>

  <p>"Of course. Trouble of some kind?"</p>

  <p>He guessed she must have some other lawyer or lawyers somewhere, together
  with the usual outfit of agents, business managers, tax-consultants, and so
  on; he knew also how impulsively actors get themselves into a mess and how
  capriciously they can turn on those whom they pay to get them out. Maybe she
  was in a mood for such a change. He himself had tried to winnow down his
  clientele into those who were his personal friends and who, if they did get
  into trouble, would give him the pleasure as well as the task of extrication.
  He wondered if he would want Carey Arundel as such a client, even if she
  asked him. Possibly.</p>

  <p>She was answering his question: "Oh, nothing very important. I just
  thought of sub-letting my apartment while I go to Ireland, but the lease says
  I can't."</p>

  <p>George might well have replied that if the lease said she couldn't, then
  very probably she couldn't; or he might have tactfully conveyed that he was a
  busy and expensive lawyer and that any financial advantage of sub-tenancy
  could easily turn out to be less than his fees if she got into trouble over
  it. But simply because he continued to like the look of her, and also the
  sound of her voice, he said instead: "Be glad to help you. Send&mdash;or
  better still&mdash;bring the lease along to my office and I'll see if
  anything can be done." The chairman was pounding his gavel for silence, so he
  hastened to add: "Any time. Tomorrow morning if you like."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Tomorrow morning, then," she said hurriedly, fixing her face for
  the degree of attention that was appropriate in one about to be honoured.</p>

  <p>The chairman made a very dull speech about the significance of motion
  pictures in the national life, and during the applause that followed George
  said: "Are you by any chance going on to the Fulton-Griffins' when this thing
  is over?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think so. I was asked, but I understand there's such a crowd
  always there, and I hate crowds."</p>

  <p>"So do I, but a Fulton-Griffin party is something you ought to see if you
  haven't been to one before. I thought if you were going I'd have a chance to
  talk to you without all these interruptions."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'd like that, but I really think I ought to go home. I've been
  rather tired since the picture finished and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The chairman was introducing the next speaker, a local politician who
  would present the awards. He was her neighbour on the other side, so the
  mechanics of it would be simple. But he talked too long, though he was easier
  to listen to and told a few mildly amusing stories. Presently he veered his
  remarks in her direction and announced her as the winner of the actress
  award.</p>

  <p>George applauded with more than his usual fervour when she accepted the
  plaque. Then she made a short but charming speech in which there was no
  discernible trace of nervousness at all. He wondered if it were concealed, or
  whether she had made a habit of telling people about it in advance and then
  surprising them. George, however, was not surprised. He had seen tricks like
  that before, and had sometimes practised them in court with much success. But
  he admired the total effect of her performance and was more than sincere in
  his whispered "Bravo" when she sat down. "You did very well," he
  commented.</p>

  <p>"Did I? Who's next? Is it Greg?"</p>

  <p>It was Greg. He was a handsome fellow, invariably cast for heroic parts;
  not a great actor, not even in his own estimation. Sufficient that in a few
  ill-chosen sentences he could mumble thanks and work off a laboured gag about
  golf, which was his passion and pastime; any eloquence, even too much
  coherence, would have been almost disconcerting from such a source.</p>

  <p>Then the director's award to Paul Saffron. For some reason Saffron was
  seated far down the table, and had to come forward to a microphone; as he did
  so George studied him with curiosity, chiefly because of Carey's remark that
  his speeches were apt to make her nervous. George wondered how many of them
  she had been forced to hear. Saffron was certainly a personality; his face
  large and jowly, the expression that of a man facing limitless challenge;
  there was a certain splendour, though, in the contour of cheeks and forehead,
  caprice in the waving wispy hair, something of a Pan-like sparkle in the
  small blue-grey eyes. George wondered if he had drunk too much; a few minutes
  later he was beginning to wonder what else could be the matter with the
  man.</p>

  <p>For it was, by and large, the most deplorable exhibition George could
  remember. Saffron, in a strident staccato that would have been loud enough
  even without a microphone, began by telling the donors of the award that he
  considered their choice a bad one. At first some of the audience thought this
  must be a joke, but he glared them down and went on to state categorically
  that Morning Journey was the worst picture he had ever made. "Of course an
  artist gets used to being praised for all the wrong reasons&mdash;he's lucky
  to be praised at all&mdash;and in my own case I can boast that my best work
  was <i>never</i> praised, it was never even finished&mdash;they wouldn't
allow me to
  finish it." (He didn't say who 'they' were, but by this time it was
  abundantly clear that he was not cracking jokes.) "As for Morning Journey, I
  have this to say, and as an artist I must say it, that the picture you have
  so extravagantly praised and undeservedly honoured is a product of the
  gigantic factory that does for entertainment what Henry Ford has done for
  automobiles. A <i>competent</i> picture&mdash;oh yes. A <i>clever</i>
picture&mdash;
  perhaps. But a <i>great</i> picture?... Oh dear no, let us save that word
for some
  occasion when it might possibly be needed&mdash;even here. Because it
<i>has</i>
  been needed here&mdash;in earlier days. Griffith could have claimed the
  word&mdash;and Chaplin&mdash;perhaps a few others whose names are less well
  known, perhaps a few whose names are by now completely forgotten..."</p>

  <p>George shared the general discomfort with which all this was received. It
  was not that he specially disagreed; he had no great opinion of Hollywood and
  all it stood for; to him it was a place to earn a living, a place also in
  which he had found friends. A few of Saffron's remarks he would not have
  disputed at all&mdash;for instance&mdash;"This place is full of craftsmen who
  might have been artists if only they'd stayed away." That, in a magazine
  article, might have been worth saying and quotable; on an occasion such as
  this it seemed merely graceless. There was, indeed, an appalling disregard of
  the feelings of others in the whole spectacle, and George, who considered
  manners more important than sincerity on many of the occasions of life, felt
  as if his mental well-being were being sandpapered. When, he speculated, does
  such an irritant make one get up and punch somebody on the nose? Then he
  chanced to catch Carey's face and saw in it a disturbance so extreme that his
  own indignation sharpened. By that time Saffron had abruptly finished; with
  the plaque in his hand, he had not even said thank-you.</p>

  <p>There was perhaps as little applause as a speaker could ever receive
  without being actually booed or hissed; the chairman rose and, bore though he
  was, eased the situation and won a grateful laugh by saying: "I think, Mr.
  Saffron, we must all feel that you are a better maker of pictures than a
  judge of them."</p>

  <p>The affair broke up very quickly after that, many showing an embarrassed
  eagerness to escape. Held in conversation with his other neighbour, George
  was presently aware that Carey had left the table without a sign or a
  good-night. As he mingled with the departing crowd, he caught sight of
  Randolph, the producer of Morning Journey. Randolph, whom he knew fairly
  well, was in consternation; all he could mutter was: "What got into that guy?
  Is he crazy? You saw the press taking it all down&mdash;they loved it
  &mdash;I suppose that's what he's after&mdash;what ELSE could he be
  after?"</p>

  <p>George thought it pathetic that Randolph should not even contemplate the
  possibility that Saffron, however nastily, had been actuated by a desire to
  tell what he believed to be the truth. One need not, of course, think of such
  a thing nine times out of ten, but it was foolish to deny that it could
  conceivably happen. All of which, however, George wisely kept to himself.</p>

  <p>Suddenly voices upraised near the exit revealed the by now unmistakable
  element of Saffron's, his high-pitched tenor involved in an argument. "Of
  course she's an artist," he was shouting. "Not a supreme artist, I grant you,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?" someone interrupted. "Are you talking like God, or just
  jealous of her success?"</p>

  <p>"I'm proud of her success. It was always my ambition&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you take all the credit?"</p>

  <p>George was near enough now to recognize the other man as a young
  journalist named Hazelton who wrote movie criticism for one of the local
  papers.</p>

  <p>"I take much of the credit," Saffron was retorting, "because I know she
  needs someone else to bring out what she has, which is quite enchanting in
  its own way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then how can you say she isn't a great artist?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Supreme</i> was the word I used."</p>

  <p>"All right. <i>Supreme</i>. Maybe she isn't. Maybe she isn't even great.
After
  your speech tonight we know how you feel about the word. But she's <i>good</i>
  &mdash;or do you deny that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't, but <i>you</i> don't know <i>how</i> good she is. How
could you? Are
  you an actor? Have you directed plays? Do you know anything about acting and
  the theatre?"</p>

  <p>This was so brazen that it had to lead to either a fight or laughter.
  Hazelton chose to laugh. "I won't argue that, Saffron, except to tell you
  I've seen her act when you had nothing to do with it."</p>

  <p>"In what, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>Hazelton mentioned a Broadway comedy that had enjoyed a long run during
  the later years of the second world war.</p>

  <p>Saffron snorted. "Rubbish."</p>

  <p>"But <i>she</i> was good in it."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you see her?"</p>

  <p>"My friend, I had the misfortune to spend that period of my life in an
  internment camp in France while you were gadding about to New York theatres
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hazelton laughed again. "I happened to be on leave from the Pacific, but
  let that pass. The point is&mdash;and take my word for it&mdash;she was
<i>good</i>
  in that play."</p>

  <p>"And take my word for it she was best of all as Desdemona, before you were
  born, and as Candida in the Shaw play, and as Mrs. Vincent in a play called
  The Widow in the Forest which was a great hit when you must have been in knee
  pants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All of which, Saffron, by sheer coincidence you directed yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No coincidence at all. She's always best when I direct her."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;so now we know. She has to have you."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And she knows it. She knows it better than anybody."</p>

  <p>Hazelton moved away still laughing and Saffron completed his exit to the
  corridor. When he had gone, Hazelton spotted George, whom he knew, and walked
  over to him. "You heard all that? What a guy! What an evening! Well, it's
  something to write about, anyhow. The most exciting thing at a show like this
  since DeMille called the Chinese Ambassador a Jap&mdash;remember that?"</p>

  <p>Randolph said: "I suppose it's no good asking you boys to play it down. A
  packet of bad publicity for the whole industry..."</p>

  <p>Of course it was no use. One might be able to buy a certain amount of good
  publicity space-wise, but the real news nuggets, the mishaps and misfires of
  the celebrated, were so precious that no paper could afford to let them go.
  By that reckoning a table brawl at Ciro's was always more important than the
  Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">George went on to the Fulton-Griffins', where the party was
already in
  full swing and where every new arrival from the Critics' Dinner was being
  asked what had really happened. George took pleasure in lowering the
  temperature. "No," he kept on saying, "there were NO blows traded&mdash;
  NOBODY got hurt&mdash;it wasn't half as exciting as you think. Saffron made a
  silly speech, that's all."</p>

  <p>"But he insulted Miss Arundel, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"No. All he said was that Morning Journey was the worst picture he'd ever
  made, which by implication of course wasn't so very kind to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But didn't he say she was a bad actress and couldn't do a thing without
  him as director?"</p>

  <p>"That was afterwards&mdash;and anyhow, that wasn't what he said at all. As
  a matter of fact he defended her&mdash;he said she was enchanting
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>But George knew that rumour could never be overtaken by fact. He broke off
  with a shrug: "Ask someone else. I wasn't the only one there."</p>

  <p>But he also knew that others who had been asked, or would be before the
  evening was out, were less trained than he in the reporting of evidence, as
  well as possibly less ethical. He edged away from the crowd and found his
  usual comfortable corner with a drink which he could make last a long time,
  and with enough people to enjoy talking to among those who would look for
  him. He kept thinking of Carey and wondering how soon the twists and
  exaggerations of what had happened would get to her ears. Several people he
  talked to mentioned her sympathetically; during the short time she had been
  on the Coast she seemed to have made herself generally liked. Saffron, by
  contrast, was in the special dog-house reserved for those whose unpopularity
  has somehow not deprived them of stature. Diagnosis of him veered from the
  surly genius to the psychopathic charlatan; anecdotes in proof or disproof
  were in steady supply as argument grew livelier. An actor who had had a small
  part in Morning Journey remembered that Miss Arundel had once quarrelled
  bitterly with Saffron in one of the studio dressing-rooms during the making
  of the picture.</p>

  <p>George acquired for a moment his court-room air. "You heard this quarrel
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"One of the prop men told me&mdash;seems it was the lunch time when nobody
  else was around. He said Saffron had a gun and was threatening her with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't the prop man do something?"</p>

  <p>"Aw, why should he get mixed up in what wasn't his business? That's what
  he said."</p>

  <p>"Even if a man's threatening a woman with a gun?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently she wasn't hurt."</p>

  <p>"And she didn't complain?"</p>

  <p>"I guess not."</p>

  <p>"And they both went on with the picture after lunch as if nothing had
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;it's hard to believe. But so was tonight hard to believe
  &mdash;unless you were there."</p>

  <p>"But I WAS there. And already the whole thing's inflated out of all
  relation to the truth."</p>

  <p>But again it was no use. George settled down to enjoying himself as a
  guest at a party; why work for nothing?</p>

  <p>Towards midnight someone brought him news which at first he could only
  think was another rumour&mdash;that Carey Arundel had actually arrived at the
  party. At that stage of the evening, with two or three hundred persons
  overflowing from a large house into flood-lit gardens, the presence or
  absence of any individual was not easy to determine outside the range of
  sight, and George recollected that he was probably the only person to whom
  Carey's intention of not coming to the Fulton-Griffin party had been
  definitely stated only a few hours before. So he doubted the report until he
  saw her approaching him.</p>

  <p>The first thing he noticed was an almost astonishing radiance about her,
  as if she had given herself some central glow to match the exterior lighting
  of beauty. She had also changed into another dress much more startling than
  the one she had worn at the dinner; it had an austere simplicity of line that
  permitted a special drama of colour and texture. George would say afterwards
  "a sort of crimson velvet" and leave it at that.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mr. Hare," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Arundel, this IS a surprise. You changed your mind?"</p>

  <p>"I often do."</p>

  <p>"So we CAN finish our talk. That's good."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but let's go outside. The gardens are lovely."</p>

  <p>He led her through the French windows on to a terrace that stepped down to
  the swimming-pool where a fair-sized crowd had congregated. He found a
  side-path leading through a grove of eucalyptus trees.</p>

  <p>"I felt I had to come," she said, "just to show I don't feel all the
  things people are thinking I feel."</p>

  <p>"You're very wise," he answered, taking her arm. "What Saffron did say, as
  opposed to all the talk of what he said, wasn't really against YOU. Therefore
  there's nothing for you to be hurt or humiliated about."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you think that."</p>

  <p>"Just stupid of him and in bad taste."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, oh yes, I know it was."</p>

  <p>"Rather odd&mdash;coming just after you'd told me his speeches sometimes
  made you nervous."</p>

  <p>"Yes, wasn't it odd?"</p>

  <p>"You must have had a lot of experience of him."</p>

  <p>She said quietly: "Well, we were married, once."</p>

  <p>He could not conceal the measure of his surprise. "You WERE?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?'</p>

  <p>"I didn't, and as everybody else here must, it's rather astonishing nobody
  happened to mention it to me. I suppose they assumed I knew."</p>

  <p>"So you've been talking about me to people?"</p>

  <p>"A few people have been talking about you to me."</p>

  <p>"What do they say?"</p>

  <p>"They like you&mdash;and they don't like him."</p>

  <p>"They don't have to couple us together any more."</p>

  <p>"Except that you were in the picture together."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;for a special reason, but that's a long story&mdash;I might
  tell you some time, if you're interested."</p>

  <p>Some men and girls were approaching.</p>

  <p>"Maybe tomorrow? Don't forget you have a date at my office. Make it
  eleven-thirty and I'll take you to lunch."</p>

  <p>"Fine." And she added as they walked back towards the house: "He didn't
  show up here tonight, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm sure I'd have known if he had. Did you think he might?"</p>

  <p>"He's capable of it. If he'd been here I'd have wanted to leave&mdash;I
  couldn't stand any more."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you."</p>

  <p>"I'm just about at the limit of what I can stand, to be frank."</p>

  <p>"You probably need that holiday in Ireland you talked about. But why
  Ireland?"</p>

  <p>"I was born there. Where were you born?"</p>

  <p>"Vermont... on a farm."</p>

  <p>"So was I. In County Kildare. The greenest fields, and my father rode the
  wildest and most beautiful horses..." She paused as if some secret
  recollection had stolen her away; George watched her, till she caught his
  look. She smiled embarrassedly. "Oh, I guess we all feel that about where we
  were born. Vermont is beautiful too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, very..." The people who were approaching had voices he recognized;
  he said hastily: "There's just time for one more question before the mob
  finds you again... a rather personal question, so don't be startled... Did
  Saffron ever&mdash;in a dressing-room at the studio while the picture was
  being made&mdash;did he ever quarrel with you and threaten you with a
  gun?"</p>

  <p>She looked amazed, then laughed. "Good heavens, no. Who on earth made that
  one up?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They separated inside the house, and soon afterwards George
left; it was
  already long past his usual bedtime. A few hours later (nine, to be exact) he
  was telling his secretary he would see Miss Arundel as soon as she arrived.
  But she did not arrive, and about noon he found out where she lived and
  telephoned. It was a fashionable apartment hotel and the desk informed him
  she was out. He thought she was probably on her way, but after a late lunch
  alone he was concerned enough to telephone Randolph at the studio. Randolph
  said she had not only not been there, but they had been trying for hours to
  find where she was and why she had broken an appointment to see some
  publicity people. It was not like her, Randolph said, to be either forgetful
  or unco-operative and already he was a little worried. "The hotel people were
  cagey at first about what time she got home, but finally they said it was
  about one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Sounds reasonable. I left the Fulton-Griffins' soon after midnight and
  she was still there. She had a date to see me at eleven-thirty this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know she was one of your clients."</p>

  <p>"She wasn't&mdash;till last night."</p>

  <p>"Was it important business&mdash;or I suppose you can't tell me that?"</p>

  <p>George Hare was a highly successful lawyer for a number of reasons, one of
  which was that he never kept a secret that didn't matter.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll tell you&mdash;she wanted to know if she could sub-let her
  apartment while she takes a vacation in Ireland. Hardly headline news, is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Talking of headlines, what do you think of the Saffron thing?"</p>

  <p>"Been too busy to see the papers yet. Do they make much of it?"</p>

  <p>"You bet they do, and in some ways I'm glad they could tie it all into one
  story. Sort of takes the edge off what he said when the police found him
  drunk."</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;quite&mdash;get you, Randolph. How do the police come into
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You mean you don't know what happened after he left the dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I told you I hadn't seen the papers."</p>

  <p>"Well, read 'em, they'll give you the details. Not that there's much to it
  if it hadn't been him, but he was a fool to talk back to the cops. That's
  probably why they took him along. Of course as a studio we're not interested
  &mdash;so far as he's concerned, we're through. But we don't like him
  upsetting HER."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. And from what she told me last night she's had enough of him
  to last a lifetime. By the way, how much of a lifetime DID it last? Her
  marriage, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"To Saffron? Oh, that was all years ago."</p>

  <p>"Did she never marry again?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, she's got a husband now&mdash;but they're supposed to be separating
  or separated. Millionaire banker, broker, something like that. New York...
  The latest gossip links her with Greg Wilson."</p>

  <p>Oh no, George thought in protest&mdash;not Greg Wilson. But then he
  realized what was behind the protest, and being skilled in self-diagnosis, he
  was astonished. For already he was aware of something quite unexampled in his
  experience. He liked women and had frequently thought he loved them, but
  never before had he been able to contemplate marriage. Now, quite suddenly,
  he was able. Not a desire, of course, just a pleasure in abstract thought.
  And it was absurd&mdash;after an hour or so of acquaintance and a few scraps
  of conversation. Yet it did not SEEM absurd, and that was what made it such
  an astonishment to him. He had not known he was capable of it.</p>

  <p>Randolph was waiting, so he said lightly: "Sounds a little confusing,
  Randy."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever know the life of an actress that wasn't? Not that Greg
  Wilson seems to me her type."</p>

  <p>"Maybe she doesn't have a type. She isn't one, why should she have one?
  Well, call me up later if you get more news."</p>

  <p>George then sent out for the morning papers, and while they were coming he
  brushed aside the work on his desk and indulged in a daydream. He wondered if
  what she really sought from him was advice on matters more important than
  sub-letting an apartment&mdash;her marriage problem, maybe? Perhaps she
  wanted a divorce from the millionaire? George was an expert in getting
  divorces from (and for) millionaires. It would be exciting to be able to help
  her, to show off a little in doing so, to say in that calm, casual way that
  had reassured so many clients during their first professional interview:
  "Sure, we'll get what you want. Not a doubt of it. Just relax and don't
  worry..."</p>

  <p>The papers then arrived and he found the Saffron affair two-columned on
  the front page under the caption: "Abuses Hollywood, then Cops; Noted
  Director makes Morning Journey to Jail". There was the usual photograph
  through prison bars, and the story had been written up in that style of
  deadpan glee which, by long experience, has proved most effective in making
  the fall of the mighty pleasurable to the masses.</p>

  <p>"Paul Saffron, director of the hit picture Morning Journey, gave Hollywood
  a straight punch to the jaw in his speech at the Critics' Dinner last night."
  (Then a technically indisputable but thoroughly tendentious summary of what
  Saffron had said.) "Unfortunately Mr. Saffron was just as mad with the police
  an hour later when they asked why he had bashed in the fenders of a parked
  car outside his apartment..." Etc. etc.</p>

  <p>George telephoned a few people who would know and found that the case,
  though trivial, would make further headlines if only because of Saffron's
  emphatic denials and generally truculent behaviour in court that morning. But
  as he had admitted a few drinks at the dinner and been unable to pass a
  sobriety test, he might just as well have pleaded guilty from the outset. On
  the whole he was lucky to get off with a fifty-dollar fine.</p>

  <p>George was working late at the office that evening and about ten o'clock
  Randolph called him again. "Still missing, George, but a scrap more news. We
  finally got the hotel clerk to admit that she went out again about half an
  hour after checking in. She'd changed to street clothes and drove off in her
  car. Now where could she go alone at half-past one in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said George, beginning to chuckle because of the twinge of jealousy
  that made him catch his breath.</p>

  <p>Randolph ignored the frivolity. "Well, it so happens we do know where she
  went, because the clerk eavesdropped on a phone call. You'd never guess."</p>

  <p>"I probably wouldn't. Where was it?"</p>

  <p>"The Observatory on Mount Wilson. She called up somebody there and asked
  if she could look at the stars."</p>

  <p>"Any proof that she did?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, but someone's on his way there to find out. Have to tread
  carefully, we don't want the papers to make another sensation."</p>

  <p>After Randolph hung up, George telephoned the Observatory. He wouldn't
  have been a good lawyer if he hadn't been able to ask a straight question
  without making it seem important. Within five minutes he was talking to a
  quiet-spoken man who said he was Professor Lingard and readily confirmed that
  Miss Arundel had indeed visited the Observatory the previous night. "Anything
  wrong?" asked the Professor.</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," answered George. "She just didn't keep an appointment for
  lunch, but she often does things like that&mdash;she's a little haywire about
  times and places. We just wondered what she was up to during the small hours,
  that's all. 'We' is her studio and I'm her lawyer." And he laughed as if the
  whole thing was just part of some good-hearted fun he was having.</p>

  <p>The Professor did not attempt to share the fun, but he explained with
  great seriousness how it had all come about. He said that about 1 A.M. Miss
  Arundel had telephoned to ask if it were a right time for coming up to look
  at the sky. No, he didn't know her well, he had met her only once before, but
  they had talked about astronomy and he had invited her to visit the
  Observatory some suitable night. That night being one of the best, he had
  answered sure, come by all means. He himself was at work with his assistant,
  as always when weather conditions were thus favourable. She had reached the
  Observatory about two-thirty and he had been slightly surprised that she was
  alone&mdash;she hadn't mentioned anyone else, but somehow he had assumed she
  would have company on the rather lonely drive to the mountain-top. They had
  spent perhaps an hour at the big telescope; she had then said she must go. He
  and his assistant had taken her to her car about a quarter to four.</p>

  <p>"Did she say she was going straight home?"</p>

  <p>"I imagined she was. We talked about it being sunrise before she'd get
  there."</p>

  <p>"So she's probably asleep still... Well, thanks, Professor, it's been very
  kind of you."</p>

  <p>He was just about to hang up when the Professor added, with a blandness
  that George thought remarkable: "I suppose she never arrived home at all and
  you're looking for her? I'm afraid I can't help you much about that. She was
  wide awake when she left and certainly able to drive a car. I myself drove
  down the mountain about half an hour later and there was no sign of any
  accident."</p>

  <p>"Did you expect one?" George asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"There's a dangerous part of the road where several cars have gone over in
  recent months."</p>

  <p>"And you wondered about it enough to follow her and make sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... for some reason I can't quite explain... I did."</p>

  <p>"That's a strange thing."</p>

  <p>"It is, isn't it? But she was rather strange too. Behind a surface
  cheerfulness I'd have guessed her in acute distress of some kind."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Professor, I think we ought to meet personally to talk about
  all this..."</p>

  <p>The Professor agreed, but before George could fix an appointment his
  secretary had entered with a typewritten message: "Randolph's been trying to
  phone you again. He said it's important&mdash;about Miss Arundel."</p>

  <p>George got rid of the Professor as best he could and then called Randolph,
  who said simply: "She's gone off with Saffron. It'll be in the morning papers
  along with the drunk case. The real topper of toppers. Some paper up the
  Coast just spotted them together in a hotel. Calls it an elopement. I dare
  say this means we're through with her as well&mdash;I don't know what else we
  can do. If only these people would realize we don't give a damn what their
  morals are, provided they don't make trouble for US with 'em... Personally, I
  can't understand it. Not only throwing away a career but for God's sake what
  on earth can she see in Saffron? What on earth DID she see? Don't suppose
  we'll ever get the whole truth about that."</p>

  <p>"Do you ever expect to get the whole truth about anything?" George asked,
  with all his lawyer's experience. But behind the hardboiledness he felt a
  little sad. He was rather sure he would never meet another woman who would
  make him&mdash;even fleetingly&mdash;question the validity of his
  bachelorhood. He added: "She must have had an interesting life, Randy. Born
  in Ireland, she told me&mdash;on a farm... I wonder how she ever..." But
  there were so many things he wondered.</p>

  <h2><a name="part1"
     id="part1">PART ONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the convent school just outside Dublin, Carey had
  nourished ambitions to be either a nun or an actress; the nuns dissuaded her
  from the former, and her mother was equally against the latter. Mrs. Arundel,
  however, died when Carey was fifteen, and a year later, after a period of
  idleness at home, the girl managed to get a small part at the Abbey Theatre.
  It was in a bad play that lasted a week, and the sole press report that
  noticed her at all called her 'an interesting newcomer'. But whatever she had
  or lacked, she was both eager and popular, so that during later seasons she
  was given a number of even smaller parts in other plays. She read all the
  books she could get hold of about acting and theatrecraft, she studied plays
  and actors and tried to copy their tricks (some of which, at the Abbey, were
  among the neatest in the world), and occasionally she put into her lines a
  curious quality that riveted an audience's attention in the wrong place and
  made the director wrinkle his forehead in dismay.</p>

  <p>She was a small girl, delicately featured, with a generous expressive
  mouth that twisted a little when she smiled, as if (a doctor admirer once
  said) she had once had a very slight attack of Bell's palsy and had only
  ninety-nine per cent recovered. Dark hair and grey-blue eyes added to a total
  that might have taken no first prize in a beauty contest, yet might well have
  drawn more glances than the winner. Her figure, slow to develop, was still
  boyish at a time when her voice had already acquired a richness rare even in
  a mature woman; it was the most striking thing about her, this voice&mdash;
  low pitched, never shrill, yet capable of catching the random ear as colour
  catches the eye. (Much later, a critic said: "Whenever she speaks, her voice
  gives a command performance", but 'command' was not quite the word for a
  compulsion yielded to so happily. And another critic said, also much later:
  "She has a quality of womanhood so ample, and in a peculiar way so
  purposeless, that the nerves of the critic unclench and even his judgment is
  off guard; for this reason she can often be over-praised, but never
  under-enjoyed".) At school she had been a bright, gay, normal pupil, cleverer
  than the average, but no bluestocking. She liked horses, games, picnics. A
  ribald sense of humour had sometimes got her into scrapes, but never
  seriously; she had many friends and no enemies, and when she recited Portia's
  speech at the school's annual concert the nuns applauded affectionately, not
  thinking she was specially good (and she wasn't), but beguiled by her voice
  into a vision they found vicariously satisfying&mdash;that of wifehood and
  motherhood in the well-tempered Catholic life.</p>

  <p>Those years culminated in the period of the Sinn Fein 'troubles'; by the
  time she made her first stage appearance the treaty with England had been
  signed and the Free State, precariously born, was already fighting for its
  life against the Republican Army. At the height of the fratricide Rory
  O'Connor and his men were shelled in the Four Courts (within a few streets of
  the Abbey Theatre), and many a night the city echoed to sporadic roof-top
  shooting. One of the lively areas was the neighbourhood of the Portobello
  Bridge, which lay on a direct route between the theatre and the southern
  suburb of Terenure, where Carey lived with her stepfather. Several times,
  along with other passengers, she flattened herself on the floor of a tram as
  it crossed the bridge during a fusillade, and whenever she could arrange it
  she drove home with an actress friend named Ursula, who had a very ancient
  car; they could then make long detours through safer districts. Sometimes,
  also, if there were shooting near the theatre, she would spend the night with
  another friend named Mona who lived in an apartment approachable by a
  sheltered route from the stage-door itself. Since the Terenure house had no
  telephone, her stepfather could not be notified, but she had always urged him
  not to worry or stay up for her return.</p>

  <p>Often, though, when she got home late at night she found him still hard at
  work in the room which he called his study. He was learning Gaelic as an apt
  expression of his enthusiasm for the new Ireland, and perhaps as an aid to
  promotion in his job&mdash;he was an official in the Tax Department of the
  Dublin City Corporation. "How was it out tonight?" he would ask, as about the
  weather.</p>

  <p>"Ursula heard there was something going on in Rathmines, so we drove
  around by Donnybrook. It wasn't so bad that way."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I THOUGHT I heard something&mdash;I wouldn't have been surprised if
  you'd stayed all night with Mona again... Rathmines, eh? Well, well, that's
  getting pretty close." His casualness was part of an English manner that many
  years in Ireland had not effaced and which, combined with short stature and a
  strutting walk, gave him an appearance which to Irish eyes was sometimes a
  little ridiculous. But he was a kindly man. "You know, Carey, you can always
  give it up if the journeys make you nervous."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I love the work&mdash;I wouldn't know what to do with my life if
  I didn't have it to think about."</p>

  <p>"Well, well, so long as it doesn't get you down. These are certainly great
  days in the history of our country. And of course there's not much real
  danger&mdash;to you girls, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Oh no." Which was true&mdash;statistically. "It's fun, in a way."</p>

  <p>But this was not quite so true, for after the strain of a theatre
  performance all one wanted to do was to go home quickly and get to bed; the
  effort to find a quiet route and the perhaps ten-thousand-to-one chance of
  stopping a stray bullet added no pleasurable thrills. "At least I'm getting
  to know much more about Dublin, finding all these different ways home." It
  was a cheerful way to look at it, and the colourful topography of Dublin and
  suburbs&mdash;such names as Crumlin, Dolphin's Barn, Harold's Cross,
  Beggarsbush, Drumnagh, Rathfarnham&mdash;became the symbols of her almost
  nightly ordeals.</p>

  <p>One rainy morning about two o'clock, as she and Ursula detoured through
  Ballsbridge, a man, hatless and trench-coated and pointing a gun, stepped
  into the dark street in front of the car. When Ursula braked hard, he jumped
  into the back seat and gave curt orders. "Drive through Palmerston Park and
  towards Dundrum. Not too fast but don't slow down. Keep in the middle of the
  road. I'll tell you when to stop. And for your own sakes, no tricks."</p>

  <p>Ursula panicked into silence, concentrated on the driving, but Carey was
  panicked into just the opposite. She began chattering and giggling for a
  reason she could not at first discover, but soon her nerves propelled her
  more and more surely into a pattern of behaviour; she felt the kind of
  unspeakable terror she sometimes felt on the stage, but which she could
  always with an effort control, and which sometimes seemed to help rather than
  hinder her performance; and this too, she decided, must be a performance. So
  she fell into a rather broad and bawdy impersonation of a girl who had had
  too many drinks and was not particularly distressed at being kidnapped in the
  middle of the night by a forceful and handsome male. The man made no
  response. After a few miles there was a stretch of lonely country, and here
  he gave the order to stop; he then changed places with Ursula and took the
  wheel. Carey, sitting now beside him, kept her eyes on his stern profile and
  prayed that somehow, during the short interval of the drive to wherever they
  were bound for, she could talk herself and Ursula out of being raped, or even
  into being raped as a substitute for being murdered; maybe if she played up
  to him with all she had she could win him over. So she played. Actually the
  man was an exceptionally high-minded member of the Republican Army, burning
  with political zeal and puritanical to the point of primness. He had never
  even had a woman, much less raped one, and his only murders had been
  cold-blooded ones of men; on this occasion all he wanted was the car. Amidst
  empty moorland, where the climb began towards the Sally Gap, he brusquely
  ordered the two girls into the road, gave them a receipt for the commandeered
  vehicle (correct I.R.A. procedure), and drove off with scarcely concealed
  contempt for a couple of prostitutes.</p>

  <p>Carey, indeed, had proved herself an effective actress, but her judgment
  had not been shrewd in her choice of the play. It was a combination that was
  to happen again in her life. The more immediate result, however, was a near
  collapse from the strain of the whole incident, for the two girls had to walk
  miles in the rain before they were picked up; they both caught bad chills.
  Furthermore, the theft of the car meant that from then on the problem of
  getting home from the theatre would be much more burdensome. "It's Ursula I'm
  really sorry for," Carey told her stepfather. "The car wasn't insured and she
  hadn't finished paying for it."</p>

  <p>"She should keep the receipt," he answered judicially. "A truly
  independent Ireland has a responsibility in all such cases&mdash;I'm sure
  eventually it will realize that."</p>

  <p>During her next non-acting spell Carey visited her great-uncle in
  Kingstown. He had been her childhood hero, and as he lived in a district
  where there had never been any 'trouble' she could expect to relax more
  easily than at home. Captain Halloran (retired from the British Navy after a
  somewhat eccentric career) lived in a hillside house overlooking the harbour;
  he was seventy-odd, keen-eyed, loganberry red in countenance, with endearing
  qualities; he liked youngsters and animals, gave generously to the
  undeserving, and was a cheerful loser at Leopardstown races. Comfortably off,
  he kept a couple of horses which he galloped over the local countryside, or
  else hitched to a variety of two-wheeled vehicles that might well have been
  in a museum. Carey was driving one of these things on an August afternoon
  when she met Paul Saffron.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Paul was then twenty-nine, attractive in a slightly
mannered way that
  sometimes suggested the feminine but never the effeminate; a little plump,
  with wavy black hair, intense blue-grey eyes, and a long strong nose, he was
  striking enough to be noticed in a crowd, and much more so on a quiet Irish
  road. Carey stared at him from some way off, and with growing apprehension,
  for he was hatless and wore a raincoat whose pockets bulged.</p>

  <p>In truth the bulge on one side was from cigars, the other was from a
  rather conspicuous copy of the New York Times. The reason for this was that
  he wanted to be taken for an American before anyone could shoot him, and the
  reason he thought such a thing possible was that, being the kind of
  journalist as well as the kind of person he was, he thought anything
  possible. He had, in fact, just lately stepped down the gangway on to Irish
  soil with an almost conditioned reflex of navet, for he knew his job was to
  write something about Ireland that would be readable by those who were not
  really interested in Ireland at all. Somewhat to his carefully nurtured
  surprise there had been no ambush on the pier as the boat from Holyhead put
  in, so he had ignored the waiting train to Dublin and strolled inland through
  the first Irish streets he came to. It was often his luck to find things to
  write about thus casually&mdash;a dog or a child or a shop window or anything
  that met his eye. (One of his most successful pieces had been about a cat
  playing with a skein of wool in the ruins of an earthquake.) This time it was
  a girl, a girl driving a horse and some sort of a buggy along the road
  towards him, and he first noticed her because she was sitting on one leg in a
  way that looked uncomfortable. Now why? Or WAS it uncomfortable? Good enough
  for a start... Then he glanced at her face, which did not seem to him
  beautiful so much as appealing and piquant; it had a look that somehow
  complemented the question-mark of the posture. Maybe a talk with such a
  chance-met native would save him the effort of walking further, for he
  disliked walking; so he stepped to the middle of the road in front of the
  cantering horse.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said, before he could speak a word, and he caught then a
  quality in her voice that stirred him far more than anything in her looks. He
  did not guess that it was fear, and that she had not yet noticed his
  Times.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me where this road leads to?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just up in the hills."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then I've lost my way. Are you driving into town? Could you give me a
  lift back?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Jump up."</p>

  <p>She had been too scared not to invite him, and he took her readiness for
  affability. This made him pleased with her, for he liked people to like him,
  and when he thought they specially did so he paid them the supreme compliment
  of talking about himself. He did this then, as they clop-clopped through the
  peaceful downhill streets; he told her who he was, of his recent arrival in
  Ireland, his mission to report on that disturbed country for an American
  magazine, his real ambition, which was quite different, and the extreme
  likelihood that he would one day be famous. He talked to her, indeed, as he
  could always do to anyone (whether celebrity or bell-hop) when he felt in the
  mood or thought it worth while&mdash;as if he had known and would continue to
  know them all his life, and as if neither his nor theirs could possibly have
  been complete before the meeting. It was a technique that had won him both
  friends and enemies, and would have perhaps worked out all right on balance
  if he had ever felt a need to discover who were which.</p>

  <p>Carey, on her part, was warming to the relief of finding him not another
  gunman, and the warmth put her at odds with herself for having been so
  mistaken. She listened to his chatter in a daze, unwilling to try her voice
  lest there might still be too much tremor in it. By the time they reached the
  centre of the town she had said scarcely a word, and was already chagrined to
  find him so content with her silence. The looks she gave him were
  increasingly quizzical. "Well, here we are," she said at length, pulling up
  at a corner.</p>

  <p>"Already? This is as far as you go? Well, thanks. Very good of you. Can I
  get a street car from here into Dublin?"</p>

  <p>STREET CAR? "Oh yes, of course. They stop over there." She pointed.</p>

  <p>"Much obliged for the lift," he said, climbing down with caution. She
  noticed he was not very agile. "It's a hot day," he added, mopping his
  forehead. "How about having a cup of tea somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"And what would I do with the horse?" She half smiled, not so much to him
  as to herself about him. Maybe he thought a two-year-old would wait at the
  kerb like a car&mdash;a city fellow, evidently (she was wrong about that, for
  he came from Iowa, but she was basically right, since he had always been
  peculiarly inept at country ways). Paul Saffron. He had told her his name but
  had shown no curiosity about hers, and that too had rankled, giving her a
  sudden defensive pride in being Irish, and in the duality of Irish life that
  made nobody either countrified or citified to an absurd extent.</p>

  <p>He was still mopping his forehead. "I wonder, then, is there a place I
  could get some ice-cold beer?"</p>

  <p>"Ice in Dunleary in the month of August?" She shook her head at a rueful
  angle... PAUL SAFFRON. "And besides, the pubs aren't open yet."</p>

  <p>"I see. Like the English. I thought you were free of them now."</p>

  <p>"Sure, but they had us so long we learned all their bad habits."</p>

  <p>He grinned. (More for his article. Irish counterpart of the New York
  taxi-driver&mdash;never at a loss for an answer.) "You said some name just
  then that I didn't quite catch?"</p>

  <p>"Dunleary? It's the new name for Kingstown. Or rather the old name before
  our oppressors changed it. So we changed it back. It's spelt Dun Laoghaire...
  And Dublin is Baile Atha Cleath."</p>

  <p>"Tell me that again. How must I say it?"</p>

  <p>"Better not say it at all, or nobody'll know what you're talking about.
  It's a craze they have these days for turning everything into Gaelic.
  Dublin's still good enough for most people." She gave 'Dublin' this time the
  caressing, almost Brooklynese vowels of the patois.</p>

  <p>He looked as if the whole subject of place names and pronunciations were
  infinitely beyond his comprehension, for he had heard again that peculiar
  note in her voice that set him listening without taking in the words. It made
  him, from the sidewalk, give her a slow upward scrutiny and then put the
  question that had been in his mind from the first. "What's the matter with
  your leg?" For she was still sitting on it.</p>

  <p>"'Tis broke," she answered.</p>

  <p>Her voice was so much in his ears that he didn't immediately show that he
  caught the joke; and this, it seemed, was an extra joke at his expense, for
  after a few full seconds of relish she drove off laughing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When she got back to the house on the hill, she could not
stop thinking
  about the American, for he had told her, amongst so much else, that though
  his current task was journalism, he had directed plays in New York and the
  real love of his life was the theatre. Which would have been a natural cue
  for her to tell him about herself, but she had failed to do so, partly
  because she was still recovering from the initial shock of the meeting, but
  chiefly because his complete absorption in his own affairs had teased her to
  a more and more deliberate concealment of hers. She would not disclose
  anything that would interest him so much. Or would it? As soon as the doubt
  prevailed she wished she had told him. Fortunately, it would be easy to let
  him know, since there were only three Dublin hotels at which he would be
  likely to stay.</p>

  <p>Neither could Paul, on the tram, stop thinking of her, and for a reason
  that flattered them both: he had already diagnosed what he called a
  histrionic personality. Not, of course, that it was specially rare; many
  types in all walks of life were apt to be so equipped (auctioneers, athletes,
  and the clergy, for instance); besides which, one often met the unlikeliest
  people who made their personal or professional world a stage and their own
  lives a continuous play. To be an actor, a real actor, much more was needed
  than any kind of personality; nevertheless, to have the right kind was a good
  start.</p>

  <p>By midnight of that August evening he was already blaming himself for the
  incredible stupidity of not having enquired even the girl's name&mdash;how on
  earth could he trace her, even if he should want to? For it might well become
  a whim to do so, as casual as her own voice answering him about her leg.
  "'Tis broke." It was the way he would have liked her to say it if it had been
  a line in a play.</p>

  <p>By that same late evening Carey was writing three identical notes
  addressed to Mr. Paul Saffron at the Gresham, the Shelbourne, and the
  Hibernian hotels. She wrote that since he had stressed so much his interest
  in the theatre, doubtless he would like to visit the famous one in Dublin, so
  she would leave a couple of tickets for next week's opening night for him to
  pick up at the box office in Middle Abbey Street. She signed herself 'Carey
  Arundel', but she still left it to him to discover, if and when he cared to,
  WHAT she was.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He was not, as it happened, staying at any of the three
hotels, but at a
  private house called Venton League, the home of a rich brewer whom he had met
  at a party in London, and who had promptly extended the invitation on
  learning of his Irish visit. Brewing, one of the more historic trades, has
  almost escaped the stigma of being a trade at all, and its distinguished
  dynasties rank high and are considerably international; Michael Rowden, in
  his late fifties, was a fine fleur of the culture, a Rothschild of his line,
  with family connections well scattered across England, Europe, and America,
  and financial interlockings from Milwaukee to Dortmund. Had he been a younger
  son he might have made an excellent diplomat, bishop, or even cardinal (for
  he was both a Catholic and a bachelor); as it was, he sold beer (with an
  inverted snobbery that made him thus describe his business), drank wine,
  collected French impressionist paintings, and found ample time to cultivate
  the habits of a gentleman-savant. Temperament and wealth insulated him from
  most of the troubles of life, even from the Irish 'troubles', for neither
  side wished to drive into exile a man so eminently taxable. The hotheads had
  once put Venton League on their list of large houses to be burned, but Rowden
  had let it be known that he didn't much care; its destruction would spare him
  the eventual problem of whether to demolish it for villa development or
  bequeath it to Holy Church for some institutional use. And there really was a
  sense in which he did not care; he would be quite happy, if he had to be, in
  London or Palm Beach or Capri. Yet Venton League did, for all that, give him
  a special sort of satisfaction; it was the house of his ancestors, as far
  back as four generations, and family pride, well tempered with cynicism about
  it, was strong in him. Moreover, since this was Dublin and not any other
  place in the world, there was a uniqueness in the kind of life he could live
  there&mdash;an eighteenth-century quality marvellously and miraculously
  preserved into the fabric of the twentieth. Leisurely elegance, half urban
  and half arcadian, part scholarly, part merely sophisticated, gave a ripeness
  even to anachronism; the kitchens were monstrous and old-fashioned, yet the
  bathrooms combined the luxuries of ancient Rome and modern America; the
  library windows offered a view of formal gardens backgrounded by green
  mountains, yet at the end of the half-mile carriage drive, and just outside
  the lodge gates, the threepenny tram started for the Pillar in O'Connell
  Street. All this suited him and immensely intrigued his constant succession
  of house guests. For as a suave Maecenas to young men of promise he performed
  a function all the more admirable because he took so much pleasure in it; at
  Venton League there was always apt to be some visiting painter, writer,
  musician, or even tennis champion, and the language at dinner was almost as
  often French or Italian as English. Rowden had not needed much acquaintance
  with Paul at that London party to decide that he would make an apt recruit,
  both culturally and racially, to the Venton League mnage&mdash;a young
  American with literary and theatrical connections... good... he could stay as
  long as he liked.</p>

  <p>Paul, compared with all this, was brash; he had met American millionaires,
  and even American millionaire brewers, but they had not been in the least
  like Rowden. To that extent he was secretly baffled, but he gave Rowden the
  usual treatment of brilliant talk and affable self-display, hopeful though by
  no means sure that the man was being impressed. One evening wine unleashed
  his tongue to such vainglory that Rowden smiled and put his hand under the
  youth's arm as they walked into the library for coffee and cognac; Paul by
  that time was in the midst of a survey of all the grandiose theatrical ideas
  that had ever effervesced in his mind, one of which he had just thought of
  suddenly at the dining-table and which lifted him to a peak of excitement the
  more he enlarged upon it&mdash;Othello with an all-Negro cast, except for
  Othello himself, who should be white. Into a rare and breathless silence
  Rowden then managed to interject: "My dear young man, I admire your
  enthusiasms and I think it quite possible you are almost as wonderful as you
  say. But tell me... how are you going to LIVE in this world?"</p>

  <p>"LIVE?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Make a living."</p>

  <p>"You mean money? Oh, I manage. I pick up a bit from journalism, and then I
  have a travelling fellowship&mdash;rather a juicy one&mdash;it's supposed to
  enable me to do 'creative writing', whatever that means, but there's no
  problem, because if the worst comes to the worst I'll bundle some of my
  articles together and call 'em creative&mdash;who the hell can swear they
  aren't?"</p>

  <p>"You, of course, KNOW that they aren't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure. I'm not really a writer. I've got creativeness in me, but it's
  not that kind... But don't worry&mdash;I'll get by. The fellowship's a
  racket, but it helps me around&mdash;they might renew it for another year.
  And sometimes I meet rich people who save me hotel bills."</p>

  <p>Rowden was at first antagonized by what he took to be boorishness; but
  then, beneath it, he caught other notes&mdash;frustration, ambition, cool
  self-criticism, and a sort of celestial you-be-damnedness. On the whole he
  was beginning to like Paul very much indeed.</p>

  <p>Paul added, with a grin: "I'm only kidding. If you think I'd stay here
  just for that you don't know me. I'm really grateful to you. But it isn't all
  on one side, is it? I'd have been worth my keep in the old days when artists
  had patrons. Then you could have built a theatre for me and I'd have made you
  famous."</p>

  <p>"Quite a proposition."</p>

  <p>"I'm still kidding. You must think I have a nerve."</p>

  <p>"I do." Rowden smiled and continued: "Do you write as you talk?"</p>

  <p>"God, no. I wouldn't sell much if I did. I'm a sort of actor in print.
  I've created a fictional character that I call Myself, so I never write what
  _I_ think, but what I think this character would think. The novelist does
  that all the time, but he does it honestly&mdash;he LABELS it fiction, but I
  pretend I really am the slightly ridiculous fellow I've invented."</p>

  <p>Rowden eyed him critically, as if wondering how much of all this to
  suspect or discount. "Isn't it rather confusing at times?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, though of course it's nothing new&mdash;the public always tend to
  identify an actor with his part."</p>

  <p>"Not the educated public?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to some extent. Or else why would the man who plays Jesus in the
  Oberammergau Passion Play have to quit smoking and drinking?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that he did. Tell me, how did you launch yourself into this
  rather strange journalistic career?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's a story in itself."</p>

  <p>He told it, but he didn't tell the whole truth about it, which was as
  follows. He had been in England just after the 1918 Armistice, awaiting the
  voyage home and demobilization. His war service had comprised a year in an
  Army office in London. The reason he had not been sent to fight was a
  pituitary condition which made him put on weight with alarming ease; without
  proper dieting or treatment, he was at that time in danger of becoming almost
  comically fat. (Back home as a civilian, a year later, he took medical
  advice, lost most of the excess poundage, and managed after that to remain
  merely stoutish.) It happened that during the early days of 1919 Mr. Lloyd
  George was to leave for the opening of the Peace Conference in Paris, and
  reporters were badgering him in vain for a scoop. In such circumstances one
  would have thought it sheerly ridiculous for Paul to seek an interview with
  the great man for an American small-town paper; and so it was, yet he
  succeeded. He simply sent a letter on U.S. Army notepaper and enclosed a
  photograph. "You will see from this ", he wrote, "the sort of fellow I am
  &mdash;I certainly carry a lot of weight around here, but it isn't the kind
  that helps. In fact, Mr. Lloyd George, I'm just a Yank without rank who'd be
  proud indeed to shake hands with you before I go home to Reedsville, Iowa."
  Perhaps the P.M. was seduced, or amused, or merely obliging; it is even
  possible that he practised the same mixture of innocence and guile, for he
  had never been unmindful of the value of American publicity. At any rate,
  Private Paul Saffron was invited to call at Number Ten Downing Street at
  four-thirty one January afternoon. Of course there was no political scoop,
  they didn't talk about politics or the war at all, but they did discuss
  America, England, Wales, tea, coffee, the beauties of nature, and choral
  singing; moreover Paul, who had a rather pleasing bel canto tenor, was able
  to demonstrate that a lament of the Seminole Indians was remarkably similar
  to a hymn tune popular among the slate miners of Blaenau Ffestiniog. Amidst
  these amenities half an hour passed, and then an hour, whereupon Mrs. Lloyd
  George joined them and Paul had to sing again. It was all very neighbourly,
  more like Iowa than London's West End&mdash;which, of course, was exactly the
  point that Paul made in the two-column piece he wrote. And the whole article,
  which was picked up by some of the big newspapers after its dbut in the
  Reedsville Clarion, proved something else too&mdash; that America was much
  more interested in a number of other things than in war and politics.</p>

  <p>After this flash-in-the-pan success, Paul felt he had it in him to earn a
  living from journalism if he had to, though he hoped he wouldn't, for his
  passionate leanings had already centred themselves elsewhere. But an editor
  named Merryweather had become interested in him and was shrewd enough to
  realize that while magazines and newspapers were full of stuff emanating from
  INFORMED sources, the UNINFORMED source, the fall guy who steps in where
  experts fear to tread, could be equally readable in a small corner of his
  own. (Later the technique was developed into one of the humaner and more
  profitable arts by Will Rogers and later still by Ernie Pyle.) It was the
  pose of having no pose&mdash;the trick of telling the public, in reporting a
  war, how scared one was, or of an international conference, how bored.</p>

  <p>"I'm the Little Man," Paul said, gulping Rowden's brandy to give himself
  the right feeling about it. "I'm the world's hero because I'm not a hero
  &mdash;I'm Constant Reader, Pro Bono Publico, Worried Taxpayer, Average
  Citizen&mdash;I write as if writing's easy, unprofessional, no particular
  talent required, just a few pipes of tobacco and a sort of cute way of
  looking at things... I'm Lowbrow and I'm human&mdash;my God, how human I am
  &mdash;when I did a piece about my dog's birthday I got over five hundred
  letters and a truckload of dog-food from readers... Did that ever happen to
  Shakespeare?... And I haven't got a dog, I don't smoke a pipe, and I think
  I'd loathe the fellow I pretend to be if ever I met him. One of these days,
  when I've made a big hit with a play, I'm going to lose all my public in one
  grand gesture&mdash;I shall confess that all the time I've been secretly
  enjoying Beethoven Quartets... Only I'm afraid the editor wouldn't publish
  it, he wouldn't let me destroy my humble little Frankenstein midget, always
  on the watch for the Funny Side of Things, bless his tiny guts... And finding
  it, too. My first article on Ireland&mdash;you'd never guess how I'll start
  it&mdash;nothing about the Free State, or Cosgrave, or the shooting&mdash;
  leave that to the regular writers. I'll do a piece about a girl&mdash;I met
  her just after I came ashore at Kingstown, Dunleary, whatever you call the
  place. I took a walk in the town and saw this girl driving a horse and buggy
  and she was sitting with one leg bent under her... the oddest thing... like
  this..." He got up from the chair and reseated himself with his own leg
  clumsily imitating the posture. He was aware by then that he had drunk too
  much.</p>

  <p>Rowden said: "Charming, I'm sure. Some more brandy? No?... But coming back
  to the stage... of course, you know about our own Abbey Theatre? Maybe we
  should go one evening while you're here..."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They went to the Abbey to see a new play called Moon of the
Galtees, by a
  new Irish writer whom some of the critics had praised. It was typical of
  Rowden that he did not choose the opening night, that he bought seats in the
  third row, and that he took Paul to the city by tram. The chauffeur and
  Rolls-Royce would pick them up afterwards.</p>

  <p>Paul was naturally astonished when he recognized Carey on the stage, as of
  course he did immediately, despite her part as a rather minor leprechaun. (It
  was that kind of play.) His desire to see her again revived and expanded,
  during the first act, into all kinds of agreeable expectations. At the
  interval he told Rowden excitedly that here was an amazing coincidence: that
  leprechaun was actually the girl at Kingstown, the one he intended to write
  about! Perhaps they could go back-stage after the show? But Rowden, at first
  vaguely assenting, then demurred. "I'm afraid it'll be rather hot and noisy
  &mdash;if you'd like to meet Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields I can have
  them to dinner at the house some evening. I know them fairly well. Yes,
  that's quite an idea. Yeats, too&mdash;you MUST meet him&mdash;he's usually
  here, but I don't see him tonight. And perhaps Lennox Robinson and Dr.
  Starkie and A.E... We have a genuine intelligentsia&mdash;just the people
  you'll enjoy meeting."</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to see that girl."</p>

  <p>"The LITTLE girl?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. The leprechaun. After meeting her the way I did it would be amusing
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'd preserve my illusions, if I were you. The article might work out
  better."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of the article."</p>

  <p>"You like her acting, then?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no." He added hastily: "I mean, she's not good for the part, the
  part's not good, she seems to be untrained, or else badly trained, or
  something."</p>

  <p>Rowden smiled. "It would be hard to make conversation then. Why don't you
  write your little friend a note? And I'll try to fix our party for next
  Sunday&mdash;that's always a good day."</p>

  <p>So they didn't go backstage, but Paul left a scribbled message for
  delivery to her after the show, and the next day he sent flowers. He wasn't
  the kind of person who sent flowers to girls and he was rather surprised at
  himself for thinking of it.</p>

  <p>She wrote back: "Thank you for the roses. I love roses, and everybody
  wondered who they were from. I didn't see you in the audience, but I'd half
  expected you on opening night, because I'd left tickets for you at the
  box-office. I'd written to you about that at three hotels. I never thought
  you'd be staying anywhere else. All this sounds complicated, I'll explain
  when we meet. You don't say if you liked the play. Tomorrow will do fine
  &mdash;say two-thirty at the Pillar."</p>

  <p>The Pillar was the Nelson Pillar, stuck squarely and squatly astride the
  great width of O'Connell Street. Buildings on both sides had been destroyed
  in the 'sixteen rebellion, but the Pillar had escaped except for bullet
  nicks; it dominated the scene, providing a terminal point for tram routes,
  and a lofty monument to an Englishman whose public and private life made his
  memory a constantly delightful anachronism in the streets of Dublin. So
  Rowden had remarked to Paul, and it proved a good way to start a conversation
  when he met the girl, for he was unaccountably nervous at first. He had been
  late at the rendezvous owing to delay in getting away from Venton League
  after lunch, for he had not told Rowden he was going to meet the girl. He had
  even wondered if she would wait when he did not arrive; the first thing he
  must do was to apologize. But he forgot all about that when he saw her, and
  as she did not mention it, the fact that she had been standing for half an
  hour amidst the scurrying crowd vanished for both of them as if it had never
  existed. She wore a blue dress and the kind of pert cloche hat that was in
  style in those days and happened to suit her; she came towards him smiling,
  having seen him first, a few anxious seconds first, for after leaving a taxi
  to cross the road he had nearly been run down by a tram whose driver gave him
  some picturesque language in passing. "I keep forgetting you keep to the left
  in this country," were his first breathless words of greeting.</p>

  <p>"I know, I saw it," she said. "But there's terrible traffic here all the
  time. The Pillar gets in the way of everything."</p>

  <p>Which led him to repeat Rowden's remark about it, and she too found the
  subject helpful to begin with; she told him how the City Corporation had
  considered moving the Pillar (as a traffic hazard, so as to dodge the
  political issue), but so far nothing had been done because it would cost too
  much.</p>

  <p>"At least they could change the statue on the top," Paul said. "Why not
  some Irish hero?"</p>

  <p>"Ach, there mightn't be time. Before we could hoist him up there, somebody
  would have shot him as a traitor and half the country wouldn't think him a
  hero at all. That's what happened to Michael Collins."</p>

  <p>"That's almost what happened to Lincoln."</p>

  <p>"It's a curse on all of us, then. The English don't do things like
  that."</p>

  <p>"They do as bad." He laughed. "Come now, don't say you're on THEIR
  side."</p>

  <p>"My stepfather's English. I wish there weren't any sides."</p>

  <p>"Ah, then that accounts for it. He's the one that keeps you broad-
  minded."</p>

  <p>"Not him&mdash;he's more Irish than some of the Irish. Spells his name
  S-e-a-n instead of John and it's pronounced 'Shawn'."</p>

  <p>"Then I give up. This is a strange country."</p>

  <p>"You can't give up if you've got to write about us."</p>

  <p>"I shan't touch on politics much."</p>

  <p>"No?... Perhaps that's sensible. But don't romanticize, whatever you do
  &mdash;none of the Killarney-blarney, broth of a boy, top o' the marnin' to
  ye&mdash;that's the stuff we can't stand."</p>

  <p>When he reflected that this was the kind of article Merryweather would
  probably like, he almost blushed. "Maybe you'd rather be laughed at? I could
  do an amusing piece about those Gaelic changes you talked about."</p>

  <p>"Why not, then? It's a good subject. The ancient tongue of Ireland that
  nobody speaks any more except a handful of peasants in the far west, so there
  have to be a handful of professors in Dublin to decide what the ancient Irish
  would have called a telephone if they'd ever seen one."</p>

  <p>"If I wrote that way it would seem like an attack."</p>

  <p>"And why not? 'Tis time someone attacked us in fun instead of seriously."
  She showed him the book under her arm. It was Martin Chuzzlewit, a library
  copy. "I've just been reading this. Dickens certainly didn't spare the
  Americans. And it wasn't all fun either."</p>

  <p>"D'you know, I've never read Chuzzlewit."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you? I'll lend you this&mdash;I've finished it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks."</p>

  <p>"It'll probably make you angry."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it won't. My family hadn't come to America when it was written,
  so why would I feel insulted? I'll tell you what I think when I've read
  it."</p>

  <p>They went on talking, as vagrantly as that, while they skirted the quays
  past the burned-out Four Courts and entered Phoenix Park. It was windy on the
  upland there, with fast scudding clouds and a hint of rain. The view of
  mountains reminded him of a backdrop, grey-blue shapes as if cut in
  cardboard. He told her this, and it gave her the cue to remark that he still
  hadn't said how he liked the play.</p>

  <p>"Oh, THAT? Well, it wasn't bad. In some ways it wasn't bad enough. You
  know when a play is really bad, anything good in it shows like a sort of
  outcropping. Take Twelfth Night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He wondered if the notion that a Shakespeare play could be called bad
  would shock her, and he had used the example chiefly to find out. But she
  seemed unconcerned. Or perhaps she had read Shaw. Or more likely still, her
  mind was anchored to the main issue, for she went on: "So you didn't like
  Moon of the Galtees? Ach, nor did anybody. They're taking it off... And I
  don't suppose you liked me in it either."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't much of a part for you, was it?"</p>

  <p>She grimaced. "As good as I generally get. I try to believe it's because
  they think I'm too young."</p>

  <p>"How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"Seventeen. Nearly eighteen."</p>

  <p>"I'd have guessed you nearer twenty."</p>

  <p>"I FEEL like twenty. And I dress to look older, but none of it seems to
  work. There's a fourteen-year-old part in a new play they're considering
  &mdash;I'll bet they offer it to me."</p>

  <p>"Juliet was fourteen."</p>

  <p>"Ah, now, if only I could have a chance like that!"</p>

  <p>"Would you take it?"</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't? Or is it absurd of me to be so ambitious? Maybe I should
  stick to leprechauns?"</p>

  <p>"Leprechauns or Juliet&mdash;it's all acting."</p>

  <p>"I know. And you haven't yet told me how&mdash;if&mdash;you LIKED my
  acting."</p>

  <p>"You really want me to?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I can bear it."</p>

  <p>He said judicially after a pause: "I don't think you know HOW to act, but
  I think you have SOMETHING&mdash;I don't quite know what&mdash;but it's
  something you'd be lucky to have as well, even if you did know how to
  act."</p>

  <p>"All I have to do, then, is to learn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And UN-learn."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see."</p>

  <p>The inflection he caught in her voice made him continue quickly:
  "Remember, that's only my opinion." The words didn't sound like his, and he
  wondered how far the impulse to speak them could be identified as humility,
  truculence, or a simple desire to spare her feelings.</p>

  <p>"It's what I asked for. Thank you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?"</p>

  <p>"Well, what I mean is, don't let ANYBODY'S opinion worry you. Because
  worrying wouldn't help. And unless the person who criticizes has something
  constructive to say&mdash;" He checked himself, aware of immense
  pitfalls.</p>

  <p>She said musingly after a pause: "I expect you're right&mdash;that I've
  everything to learn and unlearn."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say EVERYTHING. You weren't at a dramatic school?"</p>

  <p>"No. Is that what I need?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I rather thought you HAD been to some school." He
  laughed. "They teach a lot of the wrong things."</p>

  <p>"Ah, now, Mr. Saffron, am I as bad as that?"</p>

  <p>"My name's Paul, by the way. I wish you'd call me Paul."</p>

  <p>"All right. PAUL. And I don't know how to act, according to you. Maybe you
  think you could teach me?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no. I'm not a teacher. I can't act myself&mdash;I haven't the
  vaguest idea how it's done." Again he knew that this was an attitude-clich,
  with just enough truth in it for guile. "All I do &mdash;all I hope to
  do&mdash;is to... if I had to put it into a sentence... to... to communicate
  a sort of excitement." Well, that was true &mdash;fairly true, anyhow. "If
  you challenge me to say I could do that with you, then I'll say it&mdash;I'd
  try to, anyhow... I mean, if I were directing a play you were in."</p>

  <p>"Excitement?"</p>

  <p>"Of course there's much more to it than just that&mdash;there's style and
  technique and a hundred other things. But the essential thing is the kindling
  of emotion in the actor&mdash;in his mind, in his voice, in his
  movements."</p>

  <p>"Emotional excitement?"</p>

  <p>"Call it anything you like. Perhaps it's what Oscar Wilde meant when he
  said he felt in a mood to pick his teeth with the spire of a cathedral."</p>

  <p>"HE said that?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, amused at what he guessed&mdash;that to her Catholic mind the
  name was necessarily a symbol of wickedness. "Are you surprised?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. But I'd never heard it before. It's a wonderful phrase."</p>

  <p>"Wilde was one of the wittiest men who ever lived."</p>

  <p>"I know. I've read his plays. Under the bedclothes with a flashlight." She
  caught his look and added: "That was at school. They were strict about the
  books we got, but we used to smuggle them in. I also read De Profundis and
  The Ballad of Reading Gaol."</p>

  <p>"You were interested in Wilde at that age?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;and my great-uncle often talked about him&mdash;still does.
  He knew him. They were at T.C.D. together." Again she intercepted the look.
  "That's Trinity College, Dublin."</p>

  <p>He gaped, a little enchanted by this strange Irish world in which there
  could be so much intimacy and innocence combined; for of all the reasons for
  being concerned about Wilde, surely the fact that one's great-uncle had been
  at college with him was unmatchable.</p>

  <p>She broke into his reverie by saying: "Did YOU ever have that feeling
  &mdash;that you could pick your teeth with the spire of a cathedral?"</p>

  <p>The answer that came to his mind (that he was enjoying such a sensation
  there and then) was too simple and astonishing to confess, so he said: "Well,
  on a first night when you know the play's a hit you feel pretty good." (He
  had never had this experience.)</p>

  <p>She nodded, more with encouragement than assent, and he went on
  feverishly: "And sometimes also it happens at quieter moments&mdash;when
  you're alone or with just one other person... the heart suddenly beating a
  little faster, putting its private exclamation mark at the end of every
  thought."</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad phrase either." (It was his own, but he had used it
  before in some article.) "You could be Irish, the way the words come."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "A real playboy of the western world, with an American
  accent."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you ought to visit the West, by the way&mdash;OUR West&mdash;
  Kerry, Clare, Connemara..."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I will when I've straightened out a few ideas about Ireland in
  general."</p>

  <p>"Not too straight or they'll surely not be right. Remember we're a twisted
  people."</p>

  <p>"And I'm a twisted man."</p>

  <p>She said quietly: "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing. A joke. Can't I joke too? But I AM getting a feeling of
  this country and I think I DO know what you mean when you call it
  twisted."</p>

  <p>It was true that he was already aware of Ireland as an atmosphere&mdash;
  something at once garrulous and secretive, warm-hearted yet slightly mocking,
  as if after a thousand years of insolubility a problem could become itself a
  kind of dark inscrutable answer. So far he had been in Dublin a week and had
  written not a line; all he had done was to sightsee, read newspapers, talk to
  everyone he met, hear a few shots in the distance, and go to the theatre. Yet
  deeper than such surface contacts was something that came to him by the same
  channel that it could pass from him to others&mdash;a communication of
  excitement, as he had called it, so that, had Dublin been a play, he would
  have been aching to put it on the stage. There was a symmetry in the emotion
  that the city gave him, and his meeting with Carey seemed part of it.</p>

  <p>She on her side was equally aware that she had never met anyone who
  interested her so much as Paul. As he went on talking she was sure he must
  realize how comparatively ignorant she was, yet at the same time she knew how
  little it mattered; she had wits to match his in the profound escapade which,
  at first, is every human relationship of consequence. Nor had she been really
  hurt by his telling her that she didn't know how to act, because she felt he
  would have been more polite if he had been less interested in her (though in
  that she was wrong); and, as the hours progressed till it was time to return
  to the streets, she passionately wanted to retain his interest, not only for
  its own sake, but for the strength she already felt she could draw from such
  a new thing in her life. For she alone knew how events during recent months
  had strained her nerve, had set up tensions that had kept her sleepless often
  till dawn, weakening even ambition, so that from the original 'I want to be a
  great actress' that had kept her emotionally alive as a schoolgirl, she had
  caught herself lately in half-wistful clingings, as if the dream were
  becoming a prop instead of an urge. But suddenly, talking to Paul, she had
  felt the urge again.</p>

  <p>When he took her hand outside the theatre he said he hoped it wasn't the
  last time they would see each other.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I hope so too. When are you leaving?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know exactly. Depends on how soon I finish the job I'm here for."
  He smiled. "Maybe I won't hurry."</p>

  <p>"Fine. So we really ought to meet again."</p>

  <p>They waited, each for the other; then he said, taking the plunge: "What
  about tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, there's a matine on Saturdays. But you could come for tea at
  Mona's afterwards. She has a little flat just round the corner&mdash; I
  always go there between shows on matine days."</p>

  <p>"Who's Mona?"</p>

  <p>"My best friend. She was Pegeen in the play, if you remember... Can you
  come?"</p>

  <p>There wouldn't be much time, between the end of a theatre matine and
  dinner at Venton League, but he made a note of the address and said he would
  be there.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">All evening and the next morning and afternoon he had the
recurrent
  feeling that to have made such an appointment was a mistake; he wanted to see
  Carey again, but only alone; to meet her with her friend was pointless, for
  he so often did not get along with strangers, especially girls, and he had a
  gloomy foreboding that Mona would prove to be one or another kind of bore. Up
  to five o'clock he was in mind not to go, but then it began to rain, the soft
  Irish rain that seemed to caress the air even more than sunshine. The rooms
  of Venton League darkened as the clouds rolled over, yet only the house was
  melancholy; the rain tempted one out of doors into a luminous grey
  cheerfulness. He put on a mackintosh and walked down the drive, relishing the
  fragrance of lawns and shrubs. A tram was at the terminus outside the lodge
  gates; boarding it he climbed to the upper deck where the rain lashed the
  windows soundlessly. He rubbed a clear space on the pane and stared down at
  the glistening pavements and bobbing umbrella-tops as the journey began. He
  tried to think what it was in Carey that so attracted him, something in her
  like a magnet to a compass needle, luring him into behaviour that was out of
  character&mdash;or perhaps only out of the character he had hitherto decided
  was his own. In this sense his discovery of her was a discovery of himself,
  and he was puzzled as well as fascinated. Was it merely her voice that did
  such things to him, or her slight, slanting smile, Mona Lisa among the
  leprechauns, or her face in quiet profile that was like the figurehead of a
  ship on a calm day? An actress? Yes, she had the makings of one in her. But
  the act that enticed him was that of her simple existence.</p>

  <p>He left the tram at the Pillar and explored through the rain till he found
  the flat. A tall Regency house had been subdivided; the flat was on the third
  floor. He climbed with his heart pounding only partly from the physical
  exertion, but when Carey opened the door all his tension vanished as if a
  switch had been pulled. The first exchange of looks confirmed the ease she
  could give him, instantly, so that he even forgot about Mona. Then when she
  was taking his dripping hat and mackintosh she mentioned that Mona was
  out.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," he said wryly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you'll find her interesting&mdash;you could get at least an
  article out of her."</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"Irish legends&mdash;antiquities&mdash;old Dublin&mdash;she knows it all.
  This house, for instance, had quite a history before it came down in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"I'd say that with you here it hasn't come down in the world at all."</p>

  <p>He wasn't good at compliments, and this one sounded stilted and
  artificial. But she warmed it to life with her laughter. "Oh, what a sweet
  thing to say! But it really was a grand house in the old days&mdash;it
  belonged to Lord Fitzhugh&mdash;the Catholic Fitzhughs. They were a wild,
  eccentric family&mdash;one of them fought with Wolfe Tone, and another was
  always called the holy man because he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are YOU a Catholic?" he interrupted, brushing aside the Fitzhughs.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I'm not very holy."</p>

  <p>"You mean religion doesn't matter much to you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, it matters a lot, but I'm just not conscious of it all the time.
  Like when you have a good digestion and you don't worry about what you
  eat."</p>

  <p>"So you'd call a saint a fellow with a touch of spiritual
  indigestion?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, now, you're laughing at me."</p>

  <p>"I'm never quite sure when you're joking."</p>

  <p>"Neither am I. That's the trouble sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Oh? What trouble? When?"</p>

  <p>"Well... during the worst of the street fighting recently nobody would
  believe how scared I really was."</p>

  <p>"I think I'd be scared too."</p>

  <p>"But you probably wouldn't laugh about it as I did."</p>

  <p>"No, I'd just run&mdash;very seriously."</p>

  <p>"But you can't, when you're in a panic. It transfixes you. Perhaps you've
  never known panic."</p>

  <p>So the subject was panic, he thought, with the kind of acceptance that
  comes in a dream. He had a wild idea to tell her about the panic he had
  indeed known, the secret panic that sprang from his ambition whenever he
  realized how time was passing and he was no nearer accomplishment, the rage
  that sometimes followed the panic, so that he said stupid, brutal things that
  were often held against him for ever. Panic&mdash;yes, he had felt it every
  birthday when he looked back on the year and reckoned his lack of
  advancement. Would she understand that if he tried to explain it? Would her
  own ambitions give her any inkling? He said gruffly: "I've never been shot at
  except by life, and that goes on all the time."</p>

  <p>"Because you find battles everywhere, Paul... don't you?"</p>

  <p>"They ARE everywhere, except... a few moments... a few people... you, for
  instance." And saying that, in words so simple, even banal, gave him a
  comfort that was partly an immense laziness, so that he could relax the
  sinews of his spirit in her company and let come what might in either words
  or actions.</p>

  <p>She exclaimed: "Oh, I'm so glad about that. I wondered if you'd ever want
  to see me again after yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not as clever as you. I don't know very much. I thought you were just
  trying to get material out of me for an article."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, do you think I'm always using people?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't blame you if you were. You're a writer&mdash;an artist. It's
  justified by the results."</p>

  <p>"You really think it is, in my case?"</p>

  <p>And again the impulse overwhelmed him to tell her, of all things, the
  truth; to confess it as she would doubtless confess to a priest. He could
  begin, at least, by admitting that all his boasts and brashness were to cover
  an almost complete lack of success in anything he had really wanted to do so
  far; he could say that the articles he had the trick of writing were always
  trivial and sometimes contemptible, that he had had long spells of fruitless
  striving and agonized self-disgust, that he was still practically unknown on
  Broadway despite his poses and pretensions abroad, that he had directed only
  two plays in his entire life, both of them at an experimental theatre in a
  New York suburb; that neither had attracted attention or been popular; and
  that even these meagre achievements had taken place several years before,
  since when he had been unable to persuade anyone else to give him a third
  chance. All this he could tell her, and then, perhaps, could follow even
  other truths...</p>

  <p>He said: "Listen... you've been so kind, so... so friendly and... and
  sympathetic... I don't want you to get any wrong ideas about me... Oh God,
  don't answer it&mdash;they'll call again if it's anything important... let it
  ring, let it ring..."</p>

  <p>But it wasn't the telephone, for the flat possessed none. Carey hesitated,
  but there was clearly nothing else she could do but admit Mona. Nervously
  effusive, devoured by curiosity, Mona was also maddeningly discreet in the
  way she had forborne to use her key.</p>

  <p>Paul froze instantly, became glum, and soon got up to go. The fact that it
  was Mona's flat did not prevent him from regarding her as a complete
  intruder. Carey took him downstairs. They said nothing till they were in the
  hallway and could see out into the street. The rain had stopped and a watery
  sunlight glinted on the wet pavements. They were both aware of things unsaid
  that might never be said on any other occasion. She touched his arm and
  whispered: "Oh, Paul, I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry too, if I was rude, but I was just getting in a mood to talk
  &mdash;I mean, REALLY talk."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you do know."</p>

  <p>She made no answer to that, but presently said: "We can meet again. Do you
  like the country&mdash;I mean, getting out of the city&mdash;mountains
  &mdash;scenery?"</p>

  <p>He didn't, but he rallied himself to give a grudging assent.</p>

  <p>"We might go to Glendalough, if you have a day to spare, or even half a
  day. I could borrow Mona's car&mdash;it's terribly old and shabby, but it
  runs. There's the lake and the famous Round Tower&mdash;might be something
  else for one of your articles."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn the articles. I'd like to go, though, but when?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know how busy you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sunday's <i>your</i> best day, isn't it? What about <i>this</i>
Sunday?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow? <i>Again</i> tomorrow? Oh yes, if I can get the car. Do you
mind if it
  rains? It probably will... this kind of weather... oh, it doesn't matter,
  does it? Would ten o'clock be too early to start? I could pick you up where
  you're staying..."</p>

  <p>"Venton League? You know where that is?"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;everyone knows Mr. Rowden's house. It's less than a mile
  from where I live, and directly on our way... Tomorrow, then."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But they never did go to Glendalough. Late that evening,
when he mentioned
  the planned excursion, Rowden said suavely: "But, my dear Paul, aren't you
  forgetting the party <i>we</i> had planned? A. E.'s coming, and even Yeats
promised
  &mdash;besides the Abbey crowd..."</p>

  <p>Paul had forgotten, but recovered himself enough, he hoped, to conceal the
  fact. "I know&mdash;I'm looking forward to it immensely, but if I start early
  I'll be back in plenty of time for dinner."</p>

  <p>"It happens to be a lunch party."</p>

  <p>"LUNCH? I thought you said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Several of them couldn't come in the evening&mdash;Yeats in particular
  &mdash;and as I was anxious to have you meet our leading lights&mdash;good
  material for a journalist apart from the fun you might have."</p>

  <p>Paul felt a sharp concern, realizing it wasn't Rowden's fault, yet
  unwilling to accept at any price the cancellation of his appointment with
  Carey.</p>

  <p>"And you can go to Glendalough some other time," Rowden was continuing. "I
  won't accompany you, I've been there so often, the place bores me a little.
  But YOU should go&mdash;it's worth seeing, touristically. You can have
  Roberts for the day." And after a pause: "Or had you other plans? Perhaps
  you'd arranged to go with someone else?"</p>

  <p>"Well yes, I had, to be frank..."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you, then, by all means, take this&mdash;this someone else?
  Roberts can drive you both&mdash;any time except tomorrow."</p>

  <p>It seemed reasonable, even generous, though the thought of driving in
  state with a uniformed chauffeur at the wheel of Rowden's Rolls-Royce was
  completely unenticing. Besides, how did he know he would stay at Venton
  League as long as the following Sunday, and of course Sunday was her best
  day. He already wished he had been truculent enough to say at the outset: I'm
  sorry, I must go to Glendalough tomorrow, party or no party. But Rowden's
  conciliatoriness had outmanoeuvred him, so that now he could only mutter:
  "Okay, I suppose that's what it'll have to be." Deprived of power to be
  adamant, he could only take refuge in ungraciousness.</p>

  <p>It was too late to communicate with Carey that night to explain matters;
  she would already have left the theatre and he did not know her home address.
  He would have to tell her when she arrived at Venton League in the morning,
  and though he guessed that she too would be disappointed, somehow that
  bothered him less than the thought of any possible meeting between her and
  Rowden, or even the chance that Rowden might see her driving up to the house
  in that 'terribly old and shabby' car. A half-realized awkwardness in the
  whole situation kept him awake to wonder how he could circumvent it; and in
  the morning, just before ten, he walked down the drive and past the lodge
  gates with the idea of intercepting her in the roadway outside. She was
  punctual, and immediately he told her what had happened. Because he was so
  chagrined he was rather testy and offhand, making almost no effort to seem
  blameless. She was not reproachful, assuring him that she fully understood
  and that naturally it would be impossible for him to miss the lunch party.
  They did not talk long, and after separating (with no plans for any future
  meeting) he began to wonder whether she had been too disappointed or not
  disappointed enough. Whichever it was had put him in no mood for meeting
  celebrities.</p>

  <p>They came, a little later, some by tram, others in cars far more ancient
  and battered than the one Carey had been driving. Dublin in those days was
  like that. And Paul, unhappy at first, was soon swept into a livelier mood by
  such exciting contacts; once or twice during the lunch he felt a stab of
  regret that he was not where he had planned to be, but he killed it by
  self-derision&mdash;was it possible that he preferred nave chatter with a
  girl of seventeen to an exchange of ideas with some of the brightest minds in
  such a captivating country? If so, then what on earth had happened to him?
  And all the discomforts of a long drive in a rattle-trap car with nothing but
  scenery at the end of it? For Paul did not enjoy travel for its own sake; art
  he loved, and a long way off and by no means next to it, nature. Moreover, he
  shared Dr. Johnson's attitude towards mountains, partly because of an
  aversion to most physical effort; even the mountain view from Phoenix Park
  had impressed him only because he had seen it momentarily as a backdrop.</p>

  <p>All this while he was listening to a very eminent poet recite some lines
  from one of his poems. Candidly, Paul did not think he recited very well, but
  since it was actually himself reciting himself, what more could one ask? And
  then the almost equally famous Mr. So-and-so, who was opposite Paul, engaged
  him in talk that soon veered to a subject that was one of the few on which
  Paul had no ideas of his own&mdash;that of co-operative creameries, and for
  the next ten minutes there ensued a fascinating monologue to which Paul
  listened in growing wonderment coupled with the ghost of a feeling that he
  was missing something more interesting elsewhere. But presently Rowden
  suggested an adjournment to the garden, and once out there it was possible to
  escape from co-operative creameries and switch to another group who were
  discussing the theatre.</p>

  <p>Paul was capricious in conversation; his rare silences might indicate that
  he was either bored or entranced; but so might his talkativeness, for if he
  were bored he would take quick refuge in the pleasure of his own voice, and
  if entranced, there would be generated in him sooner or later a terrific
  desire to entrance the entrancer. This latter occurred during the talk in the
  garden when Paul, having silently worshipped a well-known literary critic
  during the latter's eloquent opinion about the proper way to produce the
  plays of Synge, suddenly interrupted with an opinion of his own. It began
  modestly, soon acquired an eloquence fully equal to the critic's, and grew to
  a quite brilliant exegesis that attracted several listeners from another
  group.</p>

  <p>And in the thick of it, without a nod or a word, the well-known literary
  critic walked off.</p>

  <p>Paul finished his sentence and stopped. He felt himself flushing to the
  roots of his hair, and the aboriginal in him responded with a mental and
  almost muttered: Why, the son of a bitch... He knew he had been snubbed, and
  though it was not the first time, the identity of the snubber made it perhaps
  the most devastating in his experience.</p>

  <p>One of the group around him, an actor later to become world-famous,
  laughed and said: "Don't mind him, boy. He's just not used to being
  contradicted."</p>

  <p>"But I wasn't contradicting him! I was merely explaining&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They all laughed then as if the whole incident had been a supreme joke
  climaxed by his own declaration of innocence. A tall, thin, youngish
  playwright whose white hair made effective contrast with his bead-black eyes,
  remarked: "I imagine you must have found Moscow very interesting, Mr.
  Saffron."</p>

  <p>"Moscow? I've never been to Moscow."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? I thought you must be a disciple of Stanislavski."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>The playwright looked as if the question could be damnation either way:
  the revelation of Paul as an ignoramus, or cover for his appropriation of
  another person's ideas.</p>

  <p>Actually Paul had not caught the name, but the wine he had drunk increased
  the dismay he felt at having been snubbed by a man he admired and laughed at
  for a joke he couldn't share. He exclaimed hotly: "So I never heard of
  somebody?... So what? You guys never heard of me till today, did you?"</p>

  <p>Later it occurred to him that the name had been Stanislavski, and that he
  had behaved as if it were unknown to him. The gaucherie completed his
  mortification.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The party dispersed soon after that, and Paul, still
troubled, found
  himself a couple of hours later in the library, staring at the Czannes with
  his mind half elsewhere on a road that wandered disconcertingly between
  Moscow and Glendalough. The butler brought in a tray of tea-things, and
  Rowden entered soon afterwards. Paul noticed idly that he wore different
  clothes; must have an enormous wardrobe, changed for every meal, a fad
  maybe... and he recollected something that Roberts had told him with evident
  pride during one of their drives: "Mr. Rowden, sir, is very particular. Clean
  sheets and pillow-slips every time he goes to bed&mdash; even when he takes
  his little nap in the afternoon. Very particular, he is." So he's probably
  been taking his little nap, Paul reflected.</p>

  <p>Rowden attended to the tea-making, a ritual he always performed himself,
  because it involved bringing the water exactly to a boil over the spirit
  kettle, mixing the leaves from separate caddies, heating the silver pot with
  a swill of boiling water and then rinsing it into a bowl; the result, no
  doubt, was an excellent brew, but Paul didn't like tea anyway and only drank
  it from politeness.</p>

  <p>Rowden said, handing Paul a cup: "What on earth did you do to our
  latter-day Coleridge? He went off in a considerable huff and somebody told me
  you'd insulted him."</p>

  <p>"_I_ insulted HIM? All I did was to beg to differ from a few things he
  said. He'd been laying the law down&mdash;it was time someone else put in a
  word."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you upset him."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry if I did&mdash;I didn't mean to. But he was talking about the
  function of the stage director and I'm just as entitled to an opinion about
  that as he is about books."</p>

  <p>"He directs plays too."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't think he can be very good at it."</p>

  <p>Rowden laughed. "Confidentially, I rather agree."</p>

  <p>"Why confidentially?"</p>

  <p>"Because if you criticize him in this town it means you're agin the
  government, and as I'm not agin any government, provided it governs, I keep
  my mouth shut. I'm afraid you're too politically nave to understand our
  local situation."</p>

  <p>"Probably. That's why I was sent here to write about it."</p>

  <p>"It might interest you, though, to note what happens to a writer when some
  accident of history makes him a cultural pontiff over a nationalist
  literature. The first result is that he ceases to produce any literature
  himself. The next thing is a tremendous inflation of his ego."</p>

  <p>"I can see you don't like him much."</p>

  <p>"Did you?"</p>

  <p>Paul hadn't liked him at all, yet he stirred uneasily at any sign of
  agreement with Rowden on such an issue. The important fact was that the
  literary critic, likeable or not, was indisputably an inhabitant of the world
  that Paul claimed as his own. He said: "I certainly didn't intend any
  disrespect and I'd hate to think he was so put out by anything I said that he
  wouldn't visit your house again. Maybe I should write him a note?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't bother. He'll be here again, don't worry. He's on so many
  committees he couldn't leave me alone for long. Whenever there's money to be
  raised for one thing or another these people change their tune."</p>

  <p>Again Paul felt the uneasiness; he could not allow Rowden to have that
  kind of last word. "If they do," he retorted, "maybe it's because they know
  so many tunes and changing them's so easy. Don't forget they have their
  opinion of you just as you have of them, and like you, they're smart enough
  to keep it to themselves. When they ask for money you think they're humbling
  themselves, and they let you think it because they figure they get more that
  way, but actually there's something in them that your cheque-book couldn't
  buy, and secretly you resent that, so you give it a nasty name&mdash;you call
  it an inflated ego." Paul laughed to take away some of the sting. "Excuse me
  for being so personal. It's all because I enjoyed meeting the people you had
  here today. They're among the really important people in the world&mdash;a
  thousand times more so than all the politicians and gunmen &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you add 'and millionaires'?"</p>

  <p>Paul laughed again. "That would be TOO personal, but it's not a bad idea
  for my article."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was going to be about the little girl."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I start with her, that's all. Then I work around to art and
  artists."</p>

  <p>"From what you said about her acting I shouldn't have thought there was
  much connection."</p>

  <p>Paul felt that in a rather dangerous way a core of antagonism between them
  had been found and now needed only to be exploited. He said lightly: "The way
  I write, there don't have to be connections. That's the trick&mdash;
  anything'll do that comes into my head."</p>

  <p>"So long as you keep a COOL head. Something I said just now seemed to rub
  you the wrong way."</p>

  <p>"No, but it made me realize what side I'm on."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, Paul, aren't you rather deliberately misunderstanding me?
  You must know I'm not a philistine. I appreciate art and I respect artists as
  much as you do. If I don't take them quite as seriously as some of them take
  themselves, that's because I have a sense of humour."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, that's because you have a million in the bank, or ten million,
  or whatever it is."</p>

  <p>Rowden flushed. "Please don't call me 'sir'. And believe me when I say I
  was far more amused than shocked by your gaffe this afternoon. It WAS funny
  &mdash;one of the really important people in the world&mdash;by your own
  estimate, not mine&mdash;and you send him scurrying off like a&mdash;like a
  spanked puppy!"</p>

  <p>"I've said I'm sorry. What else can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing&mdash;or you'd probably make it worse... Some more tea?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks."</p>

  <p>"When are you going to write the article?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, I think."</p>

  <p>"Fine. You can have the library here to yourself and I'll tell Briggs you
  aren't to be interrupted. Would you like a secretary for the typing?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no&mdash;I do all that myself. What sort of life do you think
  I'm used to?"</p>

  <p>"I was really only trying to be of service."</p>

  <p>Paul found himself suddenly touched. He was always sensitive to the hidden
  note in a voice, and in Rowden's last sentence there had been such a note, of
  humility, almost of self-abasement. But after being touched, he was
  disturbed; the note came too uneasily from a man like Rowden and after such
  an argument. He knew then that what was happening between him and Rowden was
  a repetition of what had happened before in his life&mdash;the progress of a
  relationship to the point of chafing, as if there were something
  fundamentally raw in his personality that made friendship difficult and
  hostility almost welcome as a relief. He felt ashamed of his rudeness, yet at
  the same time he slightly resented having been out-generalled by Rowden's
  better manners, and he silently upbraided himself in words he remembered
  because he had once spoken them aloud, after a similar incident with someone
  else: "I shouldn't ever argue about art with people who aren't artists
  &mdash;I really ought to keep off the subject&mdash;I get a chip on my
  shoulder, I don't know why, I guess it's the way I'm made."</p>

  <p>"Might I read the article before you send it off?" Rowden was asking.</p>

  <p>"Why, sure, but it won't be much in your line."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, but I'm interested... You see, I've done a little writing
  myself from time to time&mdash;though not commercially." He went to one of
  the library shelves and took down a small morocco-bound volume; Paul was
  moving to inspect it when Rowden hastily put it back. "No, no&mdash;not now.
  There's another copy on the shelf by your bed&mdash;I thought you might have
  noticed it."</p>

  <p>Paul said he hadn't. "If I'd known it was something of yours... but I
  haven't done much reading in bed while I've been here, I've been too
  sleepy... I certainly won't miss it tonight, though." And then, with an
  effect of release from stress, he remembered the copy of Martin Chuzzlewit he
  had borrowed from Carey. He hadn't had time to look at that either.</p>

  <p>Rowden's uneasiness had now reached a point of evident urgency. "Please
  don't take any trouble about it. I've inscribed the book to you&mdash;I would
  be happy for you to have it. Just a few verses I wrote years ago
  &mdash;trivial, one reviewer said&mdash;the only reviewer, in fact. Another
  word he used was 'unpleasant'."</p>

  <p>"Unpleasant? How did he make that out?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was a little prim. Today that kind of attitude is rare among
  sophisticated people&mdash;almost as rare as scholarship. Some of the verses,
  by the way, are in Latin and Greek."</p>

  <p>"Without a translation? Not much good to me, then. I know Latin slightly,
  but no Greek at all."</p>

  <p>"They have their uses, the classical tongues. One can sometimes put
  thoughts into them that are&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;appropriately hidden
  from the casual reader. Gibbon, no doubt, did the same with his footnotes...
  You've read Gibbon? You should... a great stylist... but to get back to my
  own small foray into the literary arena&mdash;you've no idea how completely
  it was ignored&mdash;even by the few&mdash;the very few&mdash;who might have
  been expected to catch the mood of it."</p>

  <p>"Classical scholars, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Not entirely... But I bear no grudge. The book's utter failure may have
  been merited. Certainly that one word 'unpleasant' was the only ripple it
  stirred."</p>

  <p>Paul was uncomfortable again; he felt that Rowden was trying to make some
  tortuous amends, to heal a rift that had developed between them, yet that in
  so doing he might soon be creating other stresses even less endurable.</p>

  <p>Rowden went on: "I suppose you're surprised I should confess all
  this?"</p>

  <p>Paul laughed nervously. "No, because I think you're as proud of it in your
  own way as other people are proud of success."</p>

  <p>"You're very shrewd. I&mdash;I admire your intelligence, Paul&mdash;in
  fact, I hope you'll always remember me as one of your earliest admirers."</p>

  <p>"Well, thanks. I appreciate that. I'm sure you're a pretty good judge.
  I'll bet all those Picassos and Czannes you have were bought at the
  beginning, before the prices went up."</p>

  <p>"Some of them were, though I don't brag about it."</p>

  <p>"I know you don't. I just guessed. And I also guess if you admire me it
  means I'll go sky-high too one of these days."</p>

  <p>"I think you will, and you'll enjoy it, because you worship success far
  more than you should... But tell me, Paul, what IS the barrier between us? I
  think there must be one&mdash;you seem unwilling to become as close a friend
  to me as I could be to you. To take a trivial example&mdash;absurdly
  trivial&mdash;I call you Paul, my own name's Michael, but you've never called
  me that... it's true you don't call me Mister Rowden&mdash;you never give me
  any name at all, I've noticed. I think it symbolizes that barrier... And
  another thing&mdash;also absurdly trivial. You never told me you'd seen that
  little actress, had MET her, I mean&mdash;the child who was the leprechaun in
  that rather dreadful play."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did meet her one afternoon. We took a walk in Phoenix Park. How
  did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Pure chance&mdash;Roberts happened to be driving through and saw you
  together. It's of no importance at all&mdash;except that it seems strange you
  didn't mention it."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you were interested in her."</p>

  <p>"I'm not. But YOU evidently were... Are you still?"</p>

  <p>Paul answered musingly: "Yes, in a sort of way. She's my kind if I had a
  kind."</p>

  <p>"You mean if you were to have a girl?"</p>

  <p>"No... not exactly."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't quite know what you mean by saying she's your kind if you
  had a kind."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know either... And she's not a child, by the way. She's
  seventeen."</p>

  <p>There followed a considerable silence which was broken (and Paul was glad
  of it) by the entrance of Briggs, carrying an envelope on a tray. "For you,
  Mr. Saffron. It just came."</p>

  <p>Paul opened it: a cablegram from Boston as follows:</p>

  <p>"PLEASE DROP IRISH ASSIGNMENT AND PROCEED LONDON AND ROME IMMEDIATELY STOP
  WOULD LIKE YOU TO INTERVIEW ITALIAN POLITICIAN NAMED BENITO MUSSOLINI SAID TO
  BE COMING MAN STOP AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS BY CABLE AT LONDON OFFICE
  (SIGNED) MERRYWEATHER."</p>

  <p>Paul read this with utter astonishment, then re-read it while a sharp
  pinpoint of relief transfixed him.</p>

  <p>"Not bad news, I hope?" Rowden was saying.</p>

  <p>Paul called his thoughts to order. Now that he knew he could leave Venton
  League so soon and with such a valid excuse he felt at ease; the pinpoint of
  relief expanded inside him rapidly. "Did I look as if it was bad news? I'm
  sorry... It'll seem pretty exciting when I've got over the first shock... I
  expect the real reason I never called you Michael is the difference in our
  ages, but I will do from now on." He smiled and passed the cable over. "I
  never heard of this Mussolini fellow&mdash;he's probably a tough nut to
  crack, and since I don't speak Italian... It beats me why I'm picked on for
  this kind of job. Just because I once had luck with Lloyd George is no
  guarantee I'll manage it again."</p>

  <p>Rowden handed back the cable. "IMMEDIATELY too."</p>

  <p>"That's what it says. A hell of a life, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"And just when you were beginning to feel at home here."</p>

  <p>"Yes... Too bad."</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;you don't think&mdash;you could ignore the
  instructions&mdash;and stay on a while?"</p>

  <p>"WHAT?" Paul laughed. "Ignore an editor? That's not exactly the way to
  keep one's job."</p>

  <p>"But you said you didn't like the job&mdash;that it was only a stopgap
  till you found a new play to direct?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Paul wondered if Rowden would give or lend him a few thousand
  pounds to stage a play, say a Shakespeare production, in London or New York.
  Perhaps Rowden would enjoy a flutter of that kind, with all the patronly
  contacts it would involve. Certainly Paul had no qualms about taking money
  from a rich man and probably losing most of it. The idea tempted, fascinated,
  then grew suddenly sour; and he heard his own voice, speaking as much to
  himself as to Rowden: "You bet I'd give up journalism if I could make a
  living in the theatre, but till I can&mdash;and I WILL&mdash;I have to do
  what the boss says."</p>

  <p>"I see. The boss. This man Merryweather."</p>

  <p>"Well, he pays me for writing the stuff."</p>

  <p>Rowden nodded, lit a cigarette, and pressed the bell. "Then we must tell
  Briggs about your packing. You haven't time to catch the night boat, but
  there's another sails at eight in the morning. Leave here about seven&mdash;
  Roberts will drive you to Kingstown. If you'll excuse me, I won't get up to
  see you off, but we must certainly drink a good wine this evening&mdash;to
  celebrate your Roman holiday. Not champagne, I think&mdash;that is for
  cocottes... but I have a rather special Burgundy..."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Dinner was gay; Rowden could be the most gracious of hosts,
and Paul liked
  him almost feverishly now they were so soon to separate. Naturally much of
  their talk was of Rome and Italy. "I wish I were coming with you, Paul. To be
  with anyone when he first crosses the Alps, but you especially&mdash;a young
  American&mdash;tabula rasa... Who IS this man Merryweather? An editor, yes, I
  know that&mdash;but what sort of person&mdash;is he simpatico&mdash;does he
  have any idea of his power&mdash;to whisk you about the
  world&mdash;London&mdash;Dublin&mdash;Rome&mdash;to offer you, at the
  impressionable age, such unrivalled chances of experience&mdash; some
  lifetime friendship, maybe, or fate itself, in one guise or another? Or is it
  merely that he wants those little articles that you write with such
  deplorable skill?"</p>

  <p>"Probably only that."</p>

  <p>"How unimaginative!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he knows what he wants and he doesn't care what _I_ want. I once
  asked him if I could do the drama criticism, but he said no&mdash;I knew too
  much, he was afraid I'd be highbrow."</p>

  <p>"Surely a strain, though, as it becomes harder for you to find subjects
  you know nothing about. Or perhaps it doesn't?"</p>

  <p>"That's where travel helps. Widens the circle of ignorance. The
  unsophisticated viewpoint on Rome&mdash;I'll get it, you see."</p>

  <p>"Rome might even make you FEEL unsophisticated. It has a unique society
  &mdash;or rather two societies, one based on the aristocracy and the other on
  the Vatican. I must give you some introductions."</p>

  <p>"Thanks&mdash;I'll be the Iowa farm-boy amongst all that&mdash;it'll suit
  Merryweather fine. Because in spite of Emily Post, America loves the guy who
  isn't sure what knife and fork to use."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I try not to be TOO sure. And where finger-bowls are concerned I guard
  all my innocence. Haven't you caught me at it?"</p>

  <p>"No, but it fits well with your somewhat complex behaviour. You're an
  exceedingly complex character&mdash;did you ever realize that? A certain
  charm, when you care to use it, hides your arrogance, and your arrogance
  hides your humility, and your humility hides... what, I wonder?... I don't
  know, and nor do you&mdash;you can't know&mdash;YET. Meanwhile if I can help
  you... I shall write a few letters you can take to Italy&mdash;Briggs will
  give them to you before you leave in the morning. They'll be to quite
  influential people&mdash;but Mussolini isn't among them, unfortunately. He's
  something new in the Roman firmament since my day."</p>

  <p>"You know Rome well?"</p>

  <p>"As a youth I lived there several years&mdash;-till soon after my father
  died. I was being trained for the priesthood."</p>

  <p>"And then you found you had no vocation?"</p>

  <p>"To be less dramatic I found I had a brewery. My father had left it to my
  elder brother, but when HE died suddenly I got it... Of course you're quite
  right&mdash;I couldn't have had any real vocation."</p>

  <p>Paul thought this over and then said: "I suppose what you did proved it.
  And yet, isn't it a bit too neat&mdash;that everything's all for the best,
  whether you give up something or not? I'm lucky&mdash;I know what I'll never
  give up, and anyone can put me to any test they like." He checked himself,
  realizing that there was in all this an implied condemnation of the other,
  anxious also to avoid an exchange of confessions. He had a curious feeling
  that he and Rowden could understand each other if they tried, but he did not
  want to try; on the contrary, he felt embarrassed and evasive, as if he were
  discovered without a passport at a frontier. He said: "I wouldn't be
  surprised if I've been talking a lot of nonsense... Of course I'll be glad to
  meet your friends, it's very kind of you to suggest it, though I don't know
  how long I'll be in Rome. It all depends on Mussolini&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May I give you a word of advice?" Rowden leaned towards Paul across the
  table. "Just this. Let the big man talk. Don't tell him what a fool he is if
  you can possibly avoid it."</p>

  <p>Paul was almost ready to resent this as a second return to an issue that
  had already been terminated, but with relief inside him now rising to
  enthusiasm, he found it possible to laugh heartily.</p>

  <p>Rowden laughed too. "You know, Paul, I've been searching for a word to
  describe what's the real trouble with you, and I think I've got it... you're
  not WORLD-BROKEN."</p>

  <p>"WORLD-BROKEN? What's that?... On the analogy of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's it. You don't care what you do&mdash;or where. And to continue the
  metaphor, you'll end up shivering in an outdoor kennel instead of basking on
  the hearthrug in front of a warm fire."</p>

  <p>"Okay, Michael... So long as I have even the kennel, to hell with the
  hearthrug." (It was the first and last time he ever called him Michael.)</p>

  <p>"You're probably still young enough to be able to make the choice. How
  lucky you are, indeed!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Paul said his goodbyes in the corridor outside their
bedrooms, and Rowden
  left him with a cordial invitation to visit Venton League again. Paul
  promised he would, though with a premonition that it would never happen.
  There was so much in the man that he liked and admired, and much too that he
  felt he could make use of&mdash;not in any sense of exploitation, but rather
  as part of the process of self-enlightenment. He wondered whether Rowden
  guessed that Venton League was the first house he had ever visited where
  dressing for dinner was routine and not show-off, where vintage wines were
  drunk ritually but not snobbishly, and where servants shined shoes and packed
  for guests. His own packed bag faced him now, and on top, where Briggs must
  have placed it as a reminder, lay the Martin Chuzzlewit from the city
  library. With that as a goad, the thought of Carey leapt at him unleashed and
  with extra strength because all day, it seemed, he had been holding it at
  bay. Now that he was alone the enormity of having cancelled the planned
  excursion sank in his mind with an effect of sickness. He contemplated the
  possibility that he would never see her again, that Rowden and Merryweather
  had between them set an end to the relationship, the one with a touch of
  forethought and the other unwittingly, while he himself had weakly
  acquiesced.</p>

  <p>He knew he could not sleep with such thoughts in his mind. He paced the
  room, staring at the furniture, the pictures, anything that might stir some
  feeble counter-interest. Suddenly he saw the volume of Rowden's verses on his
  bedside shelf, hard to miss if he had ever before given the books any
  attention. He sat on the edge of the bed and read a few pages. The title was
  "Leaves", it had been privately printed, and there was no publication date.
  He soon decided that Rowden's low estimate of its worth (however insincere)
  was the plain truth. It was interesting, though, as a clue to the man's
  tastes and personality. Somewhat in the style of Swinburne or Baudelaire
  &mdash;perhaps written as long ago as that, when their kind of writing was in
  vogue. Paul re-read a few of the poems and tried to decide on an adjective
  for them. 'Unpleasant' would never have entered his mind had not Rowden laid
  such stress on the word; as it was, with an idea thus implanted, Paul
  diagnosed here and there a sort of strained morbidity, perhaps considered
  decadent at one time, but nowadays merely outmoded. Of course the items in
  Latin and Greek were beyond him. Having skimmed the book through (it was very
  short) he put it aside and forgot it was his own property, Rowden having
  inscribed it for him; so that the next day, after he had gone, its presence
  still at the bedside conveyed a far more crushing verdict than any he had
  formulated. Though he never knew this, it was the reason why Rowden did not
  reply to several letters Paul sent him during the next few weeks; and,
  indeed, it was the end of their fleeting contact.</p>

  <p>Next, and in some sense as an antidote, he picked up Chuzzlewit and turned
  to the American section; its sheer readableness diverted him for a few
  moments, but all the time he was imagining what Carey might have thought of
  America and Americans whilst reading it. Perhaps he should write her a letter
  to go back with the book; Briggs could mail them to the theatre the next day.
  He went to a desk and filled several sheets of notepaper, chiefly about
  Chuzzlewit; it was his first letter to her, indeed, except for the mere note
  he had sent with the roses. Then he noticed that the inside of the book-cover
  contained a library card with her address in Terenure, and an idea was born
  in him that speedily rose to huge dimensions. For he knew now where she
  lived, where she was at that moment&mdash;and she had said it was less than a
  mile away. Why shouldn't he walk over to her house before going to bed and
  make his own delivery of the book and the letter? Of course she would be
  asleep at such an hour, but he could come close to her for a moment, perhaps
  for the last time, and she would later know that he had been there. It was
  odd how satisfying that was to him as he contemplated it.</p>

  <p>Venton League was locked and bolted, but the garden door had a simple
  latch, and he knew there was a side gate several hundred yards from the house
  that led through unused stables and another gate into a road. He also knew
  the general direction of Terenure, but that was all. Fortunately he soon met
  a late-homing tram-driver who directed him to the address. As he approached
  it he heard, in the very far distance, the crackle of rifle shots. It spurred
  him, matching his own feeling of excitement in what he was doing&mdash;
  walking at this late hour (and he disliked walking at any hour) through the
  unknown streets of an unknown city. A mysterious schizophrenic city, he
  reflected, passing the suburban villas one after the other, each one dark and
  silent, while a few miles away on roof-tops a handful of zealots risked their
  lives to make history. He could not help thinking of it theatrically&mdash;
  the vast populous inertia of the sleeping suburbs as a background to the
  silhouette of the lone man wide awake with a gun. The idea fascinated, then
  grew larger as he tried to imagine the play whose staging he had already
  pictured with the eye of his mind. He had no political intelligence, but for
  that reason he sometimes caught a whiff of events that the analysts and
  short-range tipsters missed.</p>

  <p>When he reached the house he was surprised to see lights in several of the
  windows, both upstairs and down. He walked up the short path to the porch and
  dropped both book and note in the letter-box as quietly as he could. But
  someone must have heard, for before he reached the street again the front
  door opened and Carey's voice called out: "Who is it?" Her voice sounded
  curious rather than startled. He turned back a few paces into the zone of
  light from the doorway; then she came rushing out to him with an eagerness
  equally curious. "PAUL!... Won't you come in?" That startled HIM. She almost
  dragged him into the house, leading the way to a small room opening off the
  narrow lobby&mdash;a den, it could have been called, with an old fashioned
  roll-top desk, shabby chairs, and of all things, a complicated gymnastic
  apparatus of ropes and pulleys. He felt again the overmastering physical ease
  of being in her presence, the relief of finding her eager to see him despite
  the fiasco of the cancelled trip; but in addition there was a strangeness he
  was just faintly aware of, a tension in her face and attitude that he had not
  seen before.</p>

  <p>He began rapidly: "You must think me crazy to be here this time of night,
  but the fact is, I'm leaving for London early tomorrow and I wanted to return
  the book... I wrote this note too&mdash;never thought I'd see you... nothing
  important in it&mdash;mostly about the book."</p>

  <p>"The book?"</p>

  <p>"Martin Chuzzlewit... don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>She answered, almost dreamily: "I didn't know you knew where I lived."</p>

  <p>"That was in the book, too&mdash;on a library card."</p>

  <p>"A LIBRARY book? Oh yes, I do remember... Would you&mdash;would you care
  for a drink?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, no&mdash;I'll have to be going in a minute. Must have some sleep.
  The boat sails at eight."</p>

  <p>"Why are you going away so soon?"</p>

  <p>"My editor cabled me. I've got to do a job for him in Italy."</p>

  <p>"Italy? And before you've finished all you wanted to do here?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it. I certainly haven't done much, have I? And I'm specially
  sorry about Glendalough."</p>

  <p>"That couldn't be helped&mdash;you had the party instead. Was it
  interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Very&mdash;but I was missing Glendalough all the time." How untrue that
  was, and yet how revealing, even to himself, of the truth; for it was now,
  with her in that small room, that he was acutely missing something, of which
  Glendalough could well stand as a name and symbol. "If I'd guessed it would
  be my last chance, I don't know but what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, you couldn't possibly. And it was just as well."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because..." She hesitated, then chattered on: "You'll probably get to
  hear about it... no, you wouldn't, though, if you're leaving so soon. Anyhow,
  it's nothing that affects you, but if we HAD gone to Glendalough it would
  have been worse... for me."</p>

  <p>"For YOU?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;it's my fault for not getting to the point..." She seemed
  to steady herself as if for the repetition of a lesson, then said in a level
  voice: "My stepfather died this morning."</p>

  <p>"WHAT?" He stared at her, disturbed by her look and manner as much as by
  what she had said. "Carey! Oh, I'm sorry... Had he been ill? You didn't tell
  me... was it sudden?... But if you'd rather not talk about it..."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind... He was all right, early this morning&mdash;I saw him
  before he left for eight-o'clock mass at St. Peter's&mdash;that's the long
  mass. I went to the nine o'clock at St. Columba's&mdash;that's the short one.
  I was back here by half-past ten after meeting you, and I could see he was
  back, too, and had had his breakfast&mdash;then I heard the water running in
  the bath upstairs. The water's never hot enough early in the morning, so on
  Sundays..."</p>

  <p>She hesitated as if the details were becoming too trivial, and he made a
  murmur of encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Well, it became a sort of Sunday treat&mdash;he always stayed in the bath
  a long time and had his grammar books with him&mdash;he was learning
  Gaelic... After the water stopped running I heard him saying over the
  words... but he was there so long I began to wonder if anything was the
  matter, so I called out and knocked at the door, but there was no reply. Mrs.
  Kennedy&mdash;she's the housekeeper we've had since my mother died&mdash; she
  said he'd been all right at breakfast&mdash;quite chatty and cheerful with
  her. But after a time I told her I was nervous, so we broke the lock and
  found him... in the bath... he was dead by then."</p>

  <p>She paused breathlessly and he made haste to offer the only comfort he
  could think of. "Carey, I know there's nothing I can say that can really
  help, but of all the ways to die, it might have been the easiest&mdash;a
  fainting fit&mdash;suddenly&mdash;the hot bath on top of a meal&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think it was that."</p>

  <p>"Why... why not?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't LIKE that." She gave him a strained look.</p>

  <p>"What did the doctor say?"</p>

  <p>"He said what you said&mdash;more or less. But I still don't think
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him you didn't?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't told anybody that&mdash;till now."</p>

  <p>"Carey, what's on your mind?"</p>

  <p>She said in a level voice again: "I think he killed himself."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how&mdash;why&mdash;what on earth makes you... Look here, you'd
  better tell me what really IS on your mind."</p>

  <p>She went on: "He had asthma sometimes. He took pills for it with opium in
  them, and the doctor told him never to take more than two at a time, no
  matter how bad the attack was. They were in a little bottle that he carried
  in his vest pocket. Today, when I looked, it was empty. He must have taken at
  least a dozen."</p>

  <p>"But how can you possibly know that? Didn't the doctor ask about the
  pills?"</p>

  <p>"No. It wasn't the same doctor that gave him the prescription&mdash;that
  one left the district, and this is a new man who hadn't seen him before."</p>

  <p>"So what DID he say?"</p>

  <p>"He thought it was a heart attack. I told him he had been warned by the
  other doctor about his heart."</p>

  <p>"Had he?"</p>

  <p>The strain touched her lips now, making them veer and tremble. "I told the
  doctor he had."</p>

  <p>Paul didn't speak for a moment; he was pondering. Presently he said: "I'm
  still puzzled&mdash;I can't see that you've any reason to draw the conclusion
  you do. When and where did you last see the bottle with pills in it?"</p>

  <p>"On his bedside table. It was nearly full. I was taking him a cup of tea
  before breakfast. A few days ago&mdash;perhaps a week."</p>

  <p>"Then how can you be certain about what happened this morning? Any time
  during the past week he could have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't, unless he had an attack, and he hadn't had one since
  &mdash;oh, months."</p>

  <p>"How do you know THAT?"</p>

  <p>"He'd have told me, or else I'd have noticed. He always coughed so much
  and it left him weak afterwards. It's not something you can hide from people
  in the same house."</p>

  <p>"That may be, but I still say there's no proof that he took all those
  pills this morning."</p>

  <p>"I think he MUST have."</p>

  <p>"But WHY? Surely you don't WANT to think so? And if the doctor was
  satisfied&mdash;he was, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;after I talked to him. He wrote out a certificate, but I don't
  think he would have if he'd seen the empty bottle."</p>

  <p>He said sharply: "What did you do with the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"That's why I'm glad we didn't go to Glendalough. I broke it into little
  pieces and buried them in the garden."</p>

  <p>"You DID? Let's hope you were lucky and nobody saw you... And don't you
  ever tell anyone else about all this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I won't. But there's something I haven't told even you&mdash;yet."
  She went over to the roll-top desk and opened it. "This was the Irish grammar
  he worked from, and the pencil and exercise-book he used. They were on the
  chair by the side of the bath, and there was a note clipped to the book,
  written on a torn page. Here it is. Nobody else has seen it."</p>

  <p>She took it out of the pocket of her skirt and unfolded it. Paul read the
  carefully pencilled script:</p>

  <p>"DEAR CAREY&mdash;I know now it was a mistake ever to come to Ireland but
  I did it to please your mother and I pretended to be happy here, but I'm not,
  and actually I never have been. It's a terrible thing when all at once you
  realize you're learning a language that bores you and going to a church you
  don't really believe in. I turned Catholic too, you know, to please her. They
  don't like me at the office, they don't like my English accent, they have a
  nickname for me&mdash;they call me Fitzpomp. It's odd how all sorts of things
  can go on and on for years and you can stand them, and then suddenly you feel
  you can't stand a single one of them for another minute. Well, why should
  you? There's a line in some Latin writer&mdash;Seneca, I think&mdash;that
  says: 'We cannot complain of life, for it keeps no one against his will'. So
  I don't complain, and this letter, though it may tell you more about me than
  you have ever suspected, is really no more than a... "</p>

  <p>The letter ended at that, and had no signature; it was as if the writer
  had been seized with illness in mid-sentence.</p>

  <p>Paul was wondering why she had not shown him the letter at the beginning;
  it would have saved so much argument. The detached part of his mind caused
  him to pick up the exercise-book and compare the writing in it with the note;
  they were the same, there was no doubt of that. He saw her watching him make
  the test, but he could not guess what she was thinking.</p>

  <p>He said at length: "How old were you when your mother married again?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve."</p>

  <p>"And your real father... you remember him?"</p>

  <p>"I was ten when he died... We lived in Kildare near the Curragh. He used
  to hunt with the cavalrymen&mdash;oh, you should have seen him on a horse. We
  had a farm, but it never paid... such wonderful times, though&mdash;and every
  Christmas he took me to the Theatre Royal to see the pantomime. That's when I
  first decided I wanted to be an actress."</p>

  <p>"You didn't have such good times with your stepfather?"</p>

  <p>"No... but he was all right&mdash;we got along quite well."</p>

  <p>He handed the letter back. "You were lucky to find this too, before anyone
  else did. Are you going to keep it?"</p>

  <p>"You think... you think I'd better not?" She hesitated a moment, then
  struck a match and held the paper to it. When the flame was down to the last
  corner she crumpled the charred pieces into an ash-tray.</p>

  <p>He said: "Perhaps that's wise."</p>

  <p>"You don't blame me, do you?"</p>

  <p>"BLAME you? Blame YOU? What on earth for? Did you ever guess he was so
  unhappy?"</p>

  <p>"I never guessed anything he said in the letter. That's what makes it all
  such a shock. How could he not love Ireland, the poor little man?... though
  dear knows it's had its troubles. And I never heard that they called him
  Fitzpomp at the office. FITZPOMP..." She spoke the word as if sampling it.
  "He seemed so keen on learning the Gaelic&mdash;he didn't have to do that if
  he didn't want to&mdash;he'd been looking forward to taking an
  examination&mdash;it must have been on his mind at the end because he was
  saying over the words&mdash;I HEARD him... and the last thing&mdash; almost
  the last thing he did was so normal&mdash;so tidy... just as he always was...
  so tidy..."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"He screwed on the top of the empty bottle and put it back in his vest
  pocket. That's where I found it."</p>

  <p>Her voice had a note that made him exclaim: "Carey, you must pull yourself
  together&mdash;isn't there anyone else here in the house to help you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right. My aunt and uncle came over from Sandymount&mdash; they'll
  stay till&mdash;oh, till afterwards. And there's Mrs. Kennedy too. I'm all
  right now&mdash;really I am. I'm glad I told somebody the truth and I'm glad
  it was you. I expect I told you because you're a stranger and leaving so
  soon. And I'm glad you made me destroy the letter."</p>

  <p>"I didn't make you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know, and you were right. Ah God, he wasn't a bad man. He was
  kind to my mother&mdash;she bossed him a lot&mdash;it's true he did
  everything to please her. He was lonely after she died, but he seemed to
  manage. He took up all sorts of things&mdash;hobbies&mdash;studies
  &mdash;memory-training&mdash;those things in correspondence lessons to help
  with the Gaelic. Every evening he'd put in a couple of hours. And the machine
  over there&mdash;he bought that&mdash;it's supposed to develop muscles... I
  got so used to him, I don't know yet how much I shall miss him. I'm watching
  myself, in a sort of way, to find out. It's like when you're on the
  stage&mdash;you don't exactly FEEL, you FEEL yourself FEEL. I suppose that's
  the trouble with me now&mdash;I'm really ACTING&mdash;I can't stop
  it&mdash;I've been doing it all day, more or less&mdash;I had to with the
  doctor&mdash;and then with all the others since... Are you shocked? Is there
  something wrong with me to be like that?"</p>

  <p>He wasn't shocked, of course; he had already diagnosed that she was
  acting; the problem, to him, was in the fact that he himself was not
  directing. If their conversation since he entered the house had really been
  stage dialogue, he would have known exactly what the 'playing attitude'
  should be, but because it was all happening in life he was uncertain how to
  behave. He knew that his compassion was one of the warmest excitements he had
  ever felt, but he could find no words for it. Fortunately she had now given
  him the kind of cue he could pick up. He said, taking her arm a little
  roughly: "There's nothing wrong with you at all. Don't you know how natural
  it is for any artist to come to terms with an emotion through the medium of
  his own art? It's the great thing that compensates him&mdash;whatever he
  suffers, he has that outlet that nobody else has&mdash;he can use up what he
  feels, he can DO something with it, create something out of it, so that even
  pain, in a sort of way, seems worth while. If, for instance, he's a writer,
  he can make personal sorrow work for him in a book&mdash;a musician can put
  it into his music&mdash;a painter can see it on canvas. And all that never
  surprises anyone. But with the actor, the art is ACTING&mdash;so that
  whenever something happens to you that matters enough, that's just what you
  do. Most people wouldn't understand it, because they think of acting as a
  kind of pretence or sham&mdash;anyhow, they don't often notice it in a good
  actor, because it's his art not to seem to be acting at all. But he is, and
  he knows he is, and&mdash;as you say&mdash;he can't stop it. It's really the
  highest form of sincerity&mdash;and since you liked your stepfather, it's a
  tribute to him that you should be doing it... as you are now... SO WELL."</p>

  <p>"AM I?" She was moved almost to tears, and he did not tell her that his
  long speech had been a repetition, personalized and slightly adapted, of a
  paragraph in an article on acting which he had submitted to various magazines
  so far without success.</p>

  <p>She added: "Paul, since you say that, is there&mdash;do you think
  &mdash;any chance for me?"</p>

  <p>"As an actress?" Trying to assemble his judgment, he was excited by her
  emotion; it was intoxicating to think that she must assume his eloquence to
  have been improvised.</p>

  <p>"I know it's the most awful time to ask," she went on, noticing his
  hesitation. "But I HAVE asked, so won't you answer? Is there the merest
  outside chance? You're leaving so soon and you can help me either way. If you
  say no, I'll give up the whole idea, because I don't want to waste my time.
  But if you say yes, then..."</p>

  <p>His judgment still balked, and he could only remember what he had realized
  from the first&mdash;that she possessed the genuine histrionic personality
  plus a quality of her own that the stage might either destroy or magnify,
  depending of course on how she was trained and directed. What was it? Talent?
  Some half-physical attribute? He answered: "Yes, I think you might have a
  chance." His words had the kind of delayed sincerity that made him feel, a
  few seconds after speaking them, that he hadn't been insincere at all. (For
  presumably she did have a chance, at the Abbey, of being properly directed.)
  He went on, gathering confidence: "Why, sure&mdash;of course you have."</p>

  <p>"You REALLY think so?"</p>

  <p>"I do... I do..."</p>

  <p>The answer made the thing seem like some sort of ceremony involving them
  in vows and pledges; I do, I do, his mind kept echoing, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, bless you, Paul&mdash;even if you don't mean it... no, don't argue
  &mdash;not another word&mdash;I know you have to go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Actually he didn't want to go now at all; he wanted to explore a
  relationship that had begun to fascinate.</p>

  <p>"But Carey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear, no, I've talked too long already&mdash;I'll bet my aunt and uncle
  are wondering who that man is. Thank you, Paul&mdash;you've helped me so
  much&mdash;in so many ways&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you do something for me, then? As soon as I've gone, go to bed and
  try to sleep."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I promise that. I promise."</p>

  <p>In her changed mood she was almost shooing him out of the house.</p>

  <p>"And I'll write to you from Rome&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you have time&mdash;but you'll be so busy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll find time, Carey... because I..."</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, Paul&mdash;goodbye." They shook hands in the lobby as she opened
  the door. All the way back to Venton League he wondered why he had not kissed
  her. It did not seem important till he himself was in bed and trying to
  sleep. Then, with the mail-boat to catch in a few hours, he felt hemmed in by
  timings and mistimings.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Paul wrote to her from the Holyhead boat the next
day&mdash;a constrained
  letter, oddly aloof, because there was a battle going on in his own mind. He
  was fated, it seemed, to fight too late, when the issue could not be affected
  and the victory of second thoughts could only bring regrets and remorse. This
  time it was the fact that he had left Carey in such trouble, deserting her
  when she might most need him. Actually he doubted whether he could have
  helped her more than he already had by his advice and encouragement; but this
  prompt physical departure from the scene had an air of callousness which
  shocked him when now he contemplated it. Surely it would seem to her that he
  could cancel anything except business, and for anyone except her. If she
  mattered to him, he ought to have stayed in Dublin for at least a few days,
  even if he had left Venton League and taken a room at a hotel. But perhaps,
  he reflected, the fact that he was now on his way elsewhere proved that she
  DIDN'T matter to him. It was an argument that made him uneasy, as if, in his
  bones, he WISHED her to matter to him and would suffer if it were proved
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>He wrote to her again from London, but there was no time for her to reply
  before he was off to Rome; he gave her an address there. If she didn't reply,
  it might mean that she too had sized up the situation as one calling for
  caution, or at least for a meditative pause. During his first week in Rome he
  glanced many times across the hotel desk to the pigeon-hole where his mail
  was put when he had any; he was curious, but not too anxious yet. No letter
  came from her; and then, as if to make that a bad start in retrospect, other
  things began to go wrong too. Mussolini was neither in Rome nor willing to
  see him, and from a succession of urgent cables it was clear how confidently
  and absurdly Merryweather had been counting on a repetition of the Lloyd
  George fluke. Paul almost wished he could share the editor's concern; as it
  was, he felt only increasing distaste for the kind of fraud he was beginning
  to think he was. Perhaps the sooner he failed as a journalist the better, but
  it must be quick and catastrophic, before he could rescue himself by another
  fluke. Because he so nearly HAD pulled off that interview with Mussolini, and
  the reason for missing at the last moment had been nothing but his own
  caprice, if one could let it go at that; he had neglected to exploit one of
  Rowden's letters of introduction to an Italian of wealth and influence. The
  man had evidently liked Paul on sight and been ready to pull some final
  string, but Paul, after one short meeting, had fought shy of him from a
  personal squeamishness as hard to admit as to ignore.</p>

  <p>So having fluffed, he left Italy and travelled to Paris to await further
  word from Merryweather; if none came he could take it that there were no more
  assignments for the time being. He certainly did not feel he could return to
  Dublin to face Rowden's curiosity, whetted by some likely communication from
  the Italian friend. The one thing that tempted was the chance to see Carey
  again, but even this did not preponderate till after a certain evening in
  Paris. He had gone alone to a performance of the Magic Flute; he did not as a
  rule care for operas, because he found their dramatic foolishness hard to
  take, but this was a superlative blend of music and spectacle that made
  everything else forgettable and therefore tolerable; he sat entranced, and
  later, strolling along a boulevard, suddenly realized that not to see Carey
  again, not to follow up their relationship, would be like avoiding Mozart
  because one had once been bored by Bizet. At a sidewalk caf he stopped for a
  drink, the goggle-eyed American in Paris to all misleading appearance; for in
  truth he was lost in abstractions that soon became self-incredulous&mdash;how
  UNLIKELY that a seventeen-year-old Irish girl whom he had talked to for no
  more than a few hours could not only have occupied his mind since then, but
  could now reach out to touch the troubled parts of it! It occurred to him
  also, and as an afterthought, that no one before had so attracted him by
  sheerly feminine qualities&mdash;the lilt of her voice from the first word of
  that first encounter, her lips twisting when she smiled, even the piquantly
  all-wrong quality she had given to a small stage part (the director's fault,
  not hers). But most of all, and never an afterthought, was the mystery she
  shared with all (and how few they were) who had it in them to make a
  finger-point of contact with life through art &mdash;a feminine, creative
  mystery, the secret nerve that could break down every withholding in himself,
  whether from man or woman.</p>

  <p>He wrote again that night, telling her whimsically that Mussolini had
  refused to have anything to do with him, so he would soon have to return to
  America, his travel fellowship year being almost over; but he would like to
  see her again before that. He didn't think he would revisit Dublin, but if by
  any chance she could travel part of the way&mdash;to Holyhead, perhaps, or
  Liverpool... of course he could well imagine there might be circumstances to
  prevent that, and he would fully understand, but still, if it were at all
  possible to arrange a rendezvous...</p>

  <p>Even while he was writing he knew that part of him was counting on a
  negative answer or none at all, a rock-ribbed alibi for the rest of his life,
  so that he could always tell himself he had done his best, he had asked her
  anyway, it was fate and not he that had foreclosed. But at this the battle
  was joined again, the feeling in his bones against the arguments of his
  brain. Eventually he tore up the letter and wrote another, shorter and much
  more urgent; he told her he MUST see her again; he would come to Dublin if
  necessary and if she were still there, but if not, then somehow, somewhere,
  ANYWHERE...</p>

  <p>By return came a note as short as his own. Legal matters, she said, had
  cropped up in connection with her stepfather's small estate; there was a
  lawyer in London she had to visit almost immediately&mdash;wouldn't London be
  as convenient for a meeting as Dublin?</p>

  <p>More so, of course. He left Paris the next morning, having wired her to
  reach him at the Ellesmere Hotel, Euston Road. It was a cheap but respectable
  place, all he could afford, and he remembered it because during the war he
  had worked in an office of the U.S. Army just across from Euston Station.
  That part of London he knew as well as New York, or Reedsville, Iowa, and for
  the same reason: he had been lonely there.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The battle continued during his cross-Channel journey;
first he was
  buoyant at the thought of seeing her so soon, then he half regretted having
  planned the meeting at all. As he entered the gloomy lobby of the Ellesmere
  Hotel he even hoped for some unavoidable hitch (but it would HAVE to be
  unavoidable)&mdash;perhaps his wire had never been delivered, perhaps her own
  London trip had been cancelled. Yet when, at the desk, he asked if there had
  been any enquiries for him and was told no, he felt acutely dismayed. The
  dismay increased during the next few hours; he couldn't think what he would
  do with himself in London if she did not come; perhaps he ought to wire her
  in Dublin again. He unpacked in the comfortless third-floor bedroom; once the
  telephone rang, but it was the manager asking if he were a British subject
  &mdash;"I shouldn't have bothered you, sir, but I noticed you gave an address
  in New York&mdash;we have to keep a record, you know, sir." Paul had sprung
  to the instrument with such eagerness that he hardly knew how to reply
  through the deflation he felt; he stammered: "What's that? Yes&mdash; I mean
  no&mdash;not British... American... By the way, I'm expecting a call
  &mdash;you're sure there hasn't been one so far?"</p>

  <p>It came much later, about nine o'clock, and he had waited in the bedroom
  all the time, not caring to go out for dinner&mdash;having no appetite, he
  discovered, and as time passed, not even the inclination to read. He lay on
  the bed and wondered what was still happening to him&mdash;a new experience,
  and he had always thought he would welcome one, whatever it was; yes, he DID
  welcome it; all over the world there must be millions of young men concerned,
  as he was, about a girl; reassuring to find himself like so many others... or
  WAS he? Suppose someone were to offer him there and then a play to direct, a
  great play, wouldn't that have power to preoccupy, to excite, to thrust
  everything else out of his mind? Wouldn't it? Or would it? After her first
  words&mdash;"Paul, is that you?"&mdash;he knew the answer; by God yes, it's
  I, it's me, bring on the play, bring on a thousand plays, here I am, Paul
  Saffron, you haven't heard of me yet, but you will, you WILL...</p>

  <p>"Carey... Where are you?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know when you'd arrive&mdash;I've only just got here myself
  &mdash;the train was late... Oh, darling, it's so good to hear your voice
  again."</p>

  <p>"It IS? YOU feel like that too?... Carey, I... I've so many things to
  ask... Where're you staying? How long will you be in London? I want to see a
  lot of you... I do hope you won't be busy all the time..."</p>

  <p>"As much as you want&mdash;it'll be several days at least. I'm staying
  with an aunt at Putney."</p>

  <p>"PUTNEY?"</p>

  <p>"That's not far out. About an hour... Oh no, I'm not there yet&mdash;I'm
  at the station&mdash;Euston&mdash;I told you&mdash;I've only just
  arrived&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"EUSTON?... Then what are we wasting time like this for? Just across the
  street! Listen, Carey&mdash;under the clock in the station hall... got
  that?... A couple of minutes..."</p>

  <p>He hung up, raced down the stairs rather than ring for the crawling lift,
  and on his way across the lobby called out to the clerk in sheer exuberance:
  "Yes, I'm American&mdash;what do I have to do&mdash;register with the police
  or something?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;just for our records. Was that the call you were
  expecting?"</p>

  <p>He snapped out a "You bet" that was lost in the segments of the revolving
  door.</p>

  <p>Crossing the Euston Road (and it was drizzling with rain as it had been so
  many times before), he thought of Dante's saying that the bitterest of all
  pangs was to remember happier days; put that in reverse and it was equally
  true, for there was actual relish now in thinking of the war year that he had
  spent so safely and drearily in London. Not that it had been London's fault;
  he had liked the people and the city too, so far as it belonged to them in
  his mind and not to the associations of army life. That he had hated, utterly
  and absolutely, more probably than he would or could hate anything else in
  life. The little square where the hut had been was now just a square again,
  rain-drenched lawns covering so much drab and unrecorded experience; he could
  still call back the smell of that interior, its mixture of stale smoke, gas
  heaters, chewing gum, human sweat. Men had swarmed in continuously from the
  great near-by terminals&mdash;Euston, St. Paneras, King's Cross; and it had
  been his job (the snob job, given him because of his better education,
  forsooth!) to handle the officers, telling them where they had been allotted
  rooms, what to see in London during a few days' leave, the best shows, where
  to find the best women. (Much joking about that, especially from an angle
  neither flattering to him nor true about him&mdash;but what could he do, or
  say? So he had joined in the laughs, Pagliacci-style.) It was all so 'cushy',
  to use the overworked British adjective then current&mdash;'cushy' to sit out
  the war in London with a telephone in one hand and filing cabinets within
  reach of the other&mdash;practically a hotel clerk in uniform, humorously
  servile, falsely jocular. He and a dozen other clerks took turns at the job,
  day and night; they fed at a canteen and slept on army cots in a commandeered
  boarding-house in Southampton Row. They had varicose veins, weak hearts,
  hernias; he had his pituitary trouble. They were decent fellows, and he tried
  to conceal from them his passionate hope that when the war was over he would
  never see any of them again. Once or twice there were air raids, spicing the
  routine with excitement rather than danger&mdash;Zeppelins like silver cigars
  in the blue-black sky. On his time off he wandered all over London, visiting
  museums and art galleries, but his secret contempt for the who, what, and
  when of military life made him fumble into all kinds of trouble about dress
  and saluting. He got to know a few girls, one of whom, chance-met in the next
  seat at a concert, became a friend until she had waited for him once outside
  the army office and been shocked by overheard badinage. Neither of them had
  had enough importance to the other to be able to think it merely funny. He
  had made one man friend also, an English policeman who sometimes idled into
  the office at nights for a chat over the stove. The policeman had a sister in
  Alberta and a romantic feeling about America as a whole. He took Paul several
  times to supper at his little house near the Angel, Islington. Paul liked him
  from the moment he had said: "If I 'ad your job, mate, I'd shoot meself.
  'Avin' to put up with all them jokes from them officers and no chawnce to
  answer back&mdash;it's worse'n bein' a bloody bar-tender. Specially when they
  all think you've got it so cushy." It was true; he knew how he was envied by
  some of the men on their way to the Front, and how little they guessed there
  could be any way in which he envied them. Yet he did, and then he didn't, so
  many times; there had been conflict, even in those days, between physical
  distaste (fear, too, but no more than anyone else had) and a mental longing
  to put himself to the test, to find out if he could face what other men
  faced.</p>

  <p>And now, four years later, he entered Euston Station, happily remembering
  how miserable he had been.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As soon as he saw her he knew that their relationship was
on a different
  level, established at the house in Terenure that night, but since fortified
  by time, absence, and&mdash;who could say?&mdash;perhaps by a telepathy of
  awareness between them. She rushed up to him in the station hall and laughed
  her first words above the din of porters and luggage trucks. "Oh,
  Paul&mdash;Paul&mdash;I never dreamed I'd see you so soon&mdash;I didn't know
  how to answer your letters at first&mdash;they sounded so cold, as if you
  didn't want to see me again, but then when you said you did&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Carey, I did&mdash;I do&mdash;I've missed you&mdash;in such an
  extraordinary way. Carey, you look unbelievable... Had dinner? No? Nor have
  I. This aunt of yours in Putney can wait... Where's your luggage? Just the
  one bag? We'll take it along, then."</p>

  <p>They drove to a small French restaurant in Lisle Street that he knew of
  &mdash;quiet, informal, expensive. He had economized by staying at the
  Ellesmere, but now he would be extravagant&mdash;he would ask Merryweather
  for more work, would write a hundred articles, would interview Lenin, Gandhi,
  Bernard Shaw, Suzanne Lenglen&mdash;the whole who's who of the world. That
  was his mood as he consulted the menu. Normally he was no gourmet, and his
  appetite was voracious rather than fastidious. But now he suddenly hankered
  after delicacies&mdash;terrapin, caviare, frogs' legs&mdash;careless of how
  they mixed or what they cost; and it was she, in tune with his emotion yet
  thinking of his pocket-book, who talked him out of the wilder whims.
  Eventually he compromised on smoked salmon, poulet en casserole, and a bottle
  of Heidsieck&mdash;forgetting that Rowden had called champagne a wine for
  cocottes. And meanwhile they talked almost antiphonally, as if their
  respective concerns matched each other&mdash;his failure in Rome, her own
  bereavement in Dublin; the Magic Flute in Paris, a new play at the Abbey in
  which (sure enough) she had been offered the fourteen-year-old part. But she
  had had to turn it down in order to come to London. She didn't care&mdash;
  any more than he cared about Merryweather's disappointment. It was one of the
  few times in his life he had found anyone who could talk as much as he did
  without seeming to interrupt or to wait anxiously for chances to butt in; a
  musical simile again occurred to him&mdash;that they were somehow improvising
  on a keyboard of speech while their underlying thoughts made deeper harmony
  in what was left unsaid.</p>

  <p>Over the coffee he remembered that aunt of hers. "Carey, hadn't you better
  telephone you'll be late?"</p>

  <p>"She doesn't know I'm coming at all till I do telephone."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't? Oh, fine. Then we don't have to worry, except that if the
  old lady goes to bed early&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She's not old. She's not much older than I am."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"My mother was the eldest of fifteen and Sylvia's the youngest. She's
  married to a landscape gardener. They have three children and I don't know
  how many dogs&mdash;they breed them&mdash;wire-haired terriers all over the
  place. It's good for children to live in an atmosphere like that. They've won
  any amount of prizes. The dogs, I mean." She made a grimace. "All this must
  be so enthralling to you. Now tell me things like that about your own
  life&mdash;I wish you would&mdash;I hardly know anything about you."</p>

  <p>"You know all that matters."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, but tell me something that doesn't matter for a change."</p>

  <p>"You mean I'm too serious? I talk too much about my ambitions?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, no&mdash;how could you&mdash;to me? Our ambitions are so
  alike&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong. Acting's a completely different function from
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I dare say it is." She began to giggle. "I wouldn't argue about it for
  the world. Oh, Paul, you've got to humour me&mdash;I want some personal
  thing&mdash;about your childhood, schooldays, family&mdash;any little
  detail&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked at her, stern at first because of the note of raillery in her
  voice, as if she were daring to be amused by him. Then he softened, as one
  who can indulge a whim out of some deeper geniality of the spirit; he didn't
  really mind her laughing at him; his tolerance of that had been set at their
  first meeting.</p>

  <p>He said: "Not much to tell, Carey. I was born in Reedsville, Iowa. Small
  town. I went to grade school there. Then to high school and Iowa State
  University. My father was a farmer. He came from Pennsylvania&mdash;
  Pennsylvania-Dutch stock&mdash;Germany before that. My mother's still
  living&mdash;she's in Milwaukee with my brother and his wife. That's about
  all there is. I have no other brothers and sisters."</p>

  <p>"And no girl? You don't have a girl in America? I don't know why I never
  asked that before."</p>

  <p>"I don't have a girl anywhere."</p>

  <p>"You say that either forlornly or proudly. Which is it?"</p>

  <p>"Neither. Just a fact. To tell you the truth, I&mdash;I don't seem to
  score very heavily with the other sex&mdash;as a rule&mdash;except as
  friends. At least I haven't so far."</p>

  <p>"So far," she echoed. "That's not very far."</p>

  <p>He went on hurriedly: "How about you? I expect you're popular enough with
  all kinds of men."</p>

  <p>"Some kinds. But I don't know many&mdash;even as friends. You can't, when
  you're only free one evening a week. They won't put up with that."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! If a man were to fall in love with you&mdash;hasn't that ever
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, did he object?"</p>

  <p>"OBJECT?"</p>

  <p>"To your work&mdash;to seeing you only one night a week?"</p>

  <p>"He saw me every night. He was acting with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then it was simple for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it didn't work."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Didn't you love him?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I did at the time. Perhaps I did. But it wasn't a success."</p>

  <p>He asked sharply: "Why not? What happened? Which of you broke it off?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Paul..." She began to laugh. "You suddenly get so&mdash;so pouncy
  &mdash;like a prosecuting counsel&mdash;as if I were on trial&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm curious. You were curious about me&mdash;you asked for
  something personal. What went wrong in this affair you had with this
  man?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't an affair&mdash;at least not THAT kind of affair. Perhaps
  that's why it went wrong. He wanted it to be."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why? Moral reasons?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. Maybe."</p>

  <p>"Because you're a Catholic?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe."</p>

  <p>"But you're not sure?"</p>

  <p>"The way you're cross-examining me I don't feel too sure of anything.
  You'd make a terrifying lawyer."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. And I think you were quite right to refuse&mdash;at
  seventeen... Though it's none of my business."</p>

  <p>"It isn't really, is it? And I was sixteen then... But it's my fault, I
  admit&mdash;I began all this questioning..."</p>

  <p>"No, MY fault&mdash;I'm much too inquisitive. SIXTEEN! Good God!"</p>

  <p>"Now tell me if YOU'VE ever been in love."</p>

  <p>"ME? Why... Why, yes... hundreds of times."</p>

  <p>"That's like saying never."</p>

  <p>"Carey, I assure you, I fall for every clever or beautiful woman I meet
  &mdash;you mustn't think because I'm not a Casanova that there's anything
  about me that's&mdash;that's AGAINST women. It's just that&mdash;well, I
  suppose I'm not quite the type for these headlong passions, though no doubt
  one of them will come along some day and bowl me over completely&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"How convenient to have it come along like that! Nothing for you to do but
  just wait."</p>

  <p>"No, that's not my attitude, because&mdash;really&mdash;I should like
  &mdash;very much&mdash;to&mdash;to..." He began to colour, then looked at his
  watch and laughed. "NOW who's cross-examining?"</p>

  <p>"It's my turn again&mdash;isn't that fair? Besides, it's good for both of
  us. Wouldn't you like us to get to know each other really well?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I would." He signalled the waiter and asked for more coffee.
  She said relaxingly: "Oh, I'm so glad you did that. When you looked at your
  watch I thought you were going to say it was time we were leaving."</p>

  <p>"It is, but I don't mind."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I, though I haven't an idea how to get to Putney if I miss the
  last train."</p>

  <p>"We'll take a taxi."</p>

  <p>"WE? But you needn't bother to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I certainly wouldn't dream of letting you go alone at this time of night
  &mdash;I don't know how far the place is or what it's like&mdash;it's absurd
  for you to think of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;all right&mdash;I give in."</p>

  <p>The waiter refilled their cups. She said after a little silence: "I'm
  finding you unbelievable too. When do you have to go back to America?"</p>

  <p>"When the cash runs out. Not that I have any there except what I earn, so
  perhaps I could starve in London just as well... I'm kidding&mdash;I know I
  won't starve. I can always write something. I'm not a bad writer. Not REALLY
  good, but not bad either."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were going to direct a play here."</p>

  <p>"I wish I were going to direct a play ANYWHERE."</p>

  <p>"But here especially, then you could give ME a chance."</p>

  <p>She had said that jauntily, so he answered in the same vein: "And you're
  quite positive I'd do that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, because you said just now you were curious about me, and I think
  you'd be curious to find out what you could make of me."</p>

  <p>"I KNOW what I could make of you." The boast startled him by its
  promptness, then appalled him a little when he gave it a second thought.</p>

  <p>"I half believe you, Paul."</p>

  <p>He said, continuing the joke: "And the other half I resent. Still it's
  good to know you'd even be willing to stay in London if you were offered
  enough inducement&mdash;say Candida or Desdemona, with your name in lights
  and a thumping salary."</p>

  <p>"You don't really think I'm as arrogant as you, do you?"</p>

  <p>"So you think _I_ am?"</p>

  <p>"You have to be. You couldn't make anything of me&mdash;or even of
  yourself&mdash;unless you were... See, I do understand you a bit. Will the
  cash last a week&mdash;or ten days perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Could YOU stay too? How soon will your business with the lawyer be
  finished?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, there isn't any lawyer. I didn't really have to come to London
  at all. Now you know."</p>

  <p>He felt an unclassifiable emotion for a second, sharp and intense; then he
  diagnosed it as sheer pleasure and took extra pleasure in so doing. "So you
  wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see you? That makes us quits. But why
  invent an excuse?"</p>

  <p>"In case you felt burdened with responsibility for bringing me here. In
  case you'd changed your mind about me again. You do change your mind. First
  you like me&mdash;then you think because I'm a girl you can't like me. Or
  else you don't want to dare to like me, or don't dare to want to like me, or
  something. So I thought if that were to happen you might feel better if I had
  another reason for coming."</p>

  <p>He said seriously: "That was very considerate of you."</p>

  <p>Because in a way he knew it was, and he was impressed; he was also aware
  that their whole conversation since meeting had been a succession of moods on
  both sides, never clashing but never identical, as if they were both
  breathlessly sparring for position in some game that had as yet scarcely
  begun and might turn out to be not entirely a game.</p>

  <p>He added: "But you've told me now. You've burned your boats. Or burned
  mine. Which is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But I promise you this&mdash;if you do change your mind
  again I'll go back to Dublin without any fuss."</p>

  <p>"That's a threat, not a promise. And all this about changing my mind
  &mdash;I'm not so fickle&mdash;it's only that I'm a bit scared when I
  remember other times I've tried..." What he really meant but would not
  exactly say, was that his few previous affairs had disappointed him as
  aesthetic experiences while at the same time they had satisfied him as
  biological demonstrations. "And that's why... with you... the closer I get to
  knowing you the more I like you, and therefore the more... the more I want to
  take care not to have anything spoil the relationship. Like betting on the
  same number&mdash;the oftener you win, the more amazing it is, and the more
  nervous you get about doubling the stakes." He stirred restlessly, then
  forced a laugh. "Far too subtle, all this. The really worst fate for any
  human relationship is to be analysed to death."</p>

  <p>"Paul, perhaps the mistake you made was to try too hard&mdash;those other
  times."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean TRY in the sense of MAKE AN EFFORT. I meant TRY like
  &mdash;like SAMPLING something."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. To DISCOVER how you felt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. An experiment that wasn't too successful. But with you I almost know
  how I feel."</p>

  <p>"In advance? Without the&mdash;the sampling?"</p>

  <p>"That's how it seems. Remember the Oscar Wilde remark&mdash;about the
  spire of a cathedral? It's THAT kind of moment for me now&mdash;meeting you
  like this... here. It's&mdash;it's superb. In fact the real danger is if I
  were to develop one of those headstrong passions&mdash;I never have before,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, darling&mdash;for ME? If only you would."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;WISH&mdash;that?"</p>

  <p>"It would be fun. Maybe that's what you never had before&mdash;fun. And
  I'm quite enough in love with you&mdash;I dare say you guessed&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;WHAT? Carey, you're joking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm serious too. Did you never guess how _I_ felt?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wondered&mdash;sometimes&mdash;if&mdash;if such a thing were
  possible."</p>

  <p>She touched his arm across the table. "Oh, Paul... don't... don't be so
  humble." Her eyes brimmed over. "I expect it's the first time anyone ever
  said that to you&mdash;and a few minutes ago I was calling you arrogant. But
  where's the danger? I don't see any. Because I'm too young?"</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly&mdash;though that's a reason why it would be specially
  unfair to you if it didn't work out."</p>

  <p>"But it might. At least it MIGHT."</p>

  <p>"It didn't between you and that actor."</p>

  <p>"I told you why that was."</p>

  <p>"I know, and an excellent reason, as I said."</p>

  <p>"But I don't think it could apply to us&mdash;to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, and why not? Why are you so sure I wouldn't want what he wanted?"</p>

  <p>"Paul, don't pounce on me like that&mdash;of course I'm not sure at all
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then why couldn't it apply to me?"</p>

  <p>"Only because of my answer if you did ask. I'm different now&mdash;not
  only a year older... but&mdash;well, I told you&mdash;I'm in love with you
  enough."</p>

  <p>He was so touched he felt shocked, as by the revelation of some hitherto
  unsuspected compound of guilt and innocence inside himself. He muttered:
  "Carey, what the hell are we talking about? Let's get the bill."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They didn't go to Putney, but to a hotel in South
Kensington. On a very
  few previous occasions when Paul had embarked on an adventure like this, the
  moment when he first knew there would be no refusal had been one of dismay,
  even dejection, as if his sufficient pleasure had been in the mere pursuit of
  an uncertainty. But now there was no dismay, and its absence would alone have
  made the experience unique. There was, however, between Carey and himself a
  more positive novelty, and this he discovered gradually and with delight; it
  was a tenderness that flowed over the raw edges of rapture and gave to all
  functioning an aspect of inevitability. Till then he had sometimes thought
  that if all forms of sexual behaviour could only be energized artistically in
  terms of theatre or ballet, then his problem would be solved, since
  directorially he could be the spectator or participant in any proportion he
  chose, and nobody would question or deny his credit. But now, with Carey, the
  problem was non-existent; and with this perfect outcome the quality that had
  attracted him first of all in her voice was able to entrance over the whole
  range of sensibility. It was as if, he told himself at the time and later
  told her, it was as if her body had BRAINS. Naturally from him this was the
  supreme tribute, causing him to add another to his short list of ambitions:
  it was to marry her.</p>

  <p>So they were married, after the necessary period of waiting, at a register
  office in the Strand. A Catholic priest had previously declined to solemnize
  a mixed marriage except on conditions, but later, on learning that a civil
  ceremony had already taken place, he complied. The service, at a church in
  Putney, was attended by Aunt Sylvia and her husband; after which the couple
  enjoyed a gay wedding breakfast among the wire-haired terriers. Paul was, for
  the first time in his life, superlatively happy; a cloud that had seemed to
  overshadow him was lifted, and in the unimagined radiance he realized how
  dark it had sometimes been. He wrote exultant letters to his mother, to
  Rowden, to Merryweather, and to half a dozen others. All sent their
  congratulations except Rowden, and Merryweather was generous besides; he
  suggested some articles about England and enclosed a cheque on account.</p>

  <p>They spent a week at a seaside hotel by way of honeymoon; then one
  afternoon Paul took Carey to Hampstead, a part of London he especially liked.
  Careful search yielded nothing they could afford except a small second-floor
  flat (first floor, as the English called it), but it was conveniently close
  to the Tube station as well as to an old-fashioned public-house where, of an
  evening, writers and artists mingled with artisans and clerks in mutual
  unawareness of any trick successfully performed. Paul fitted easily into this
  society, and it was soon known who he was; he made friends and enemies as
  promptly as always, but fewer enemies than usual, since much was forgiven a
  stranger and a good talker, and it was also possible that his private
  happiness surrounded him with a visible aura of fellowship. Anyhow, it was in
  this pub that he met a man named Henry Foy who owned and subsidized a theatre
  in the neighbourhood&mdash;an old barn of a place, full of dry rot,
  moth-eaten scenery, and other drawbacks, but not too far from the Tube, and
  therefore accessible to a London West End theatre audience. Comfortably off,
  unmarried, and in his fifties, Foy was something of a dilettante; he had
  produced and directed plays himself, but so poorly that critics had generally
  ignored him except by attending his parties, which were frequent and
  colourful. He was a likeably gregarious personality, and there was no doubt
  that if he ever did anything remotely worth while everyone would jump to
  praise him. Besides a passion for the theatre which did not quite amount to
  devotion, he had a certain flair for new ideas and a willingness to try them
  which a more balanced mind or a more restricted pocket-book might well have
  checked. He had put on such plays as Brieux's Les Hannetons, Hauptmann's
  Hannele and Ibsen's Little Eyolf, but none of these had done well, or
  attracted much comment. Not till he tried Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore did
  fortune smile; certain local groups objected to the title in lights over the
  theatre entrance, a newspaper controversy was stirred up, and many Londoners
  thereby discovered the existence (and even more important) the whereabouts of
  the Nonesuch Theatre. It was just after this succs de scandale that Foy met
  Paul and was instantly captured by the idea of an all-Negro Othello except
  for a white Othello (that random product of good wine and good talk at the
  Venton League dinner-table). Foy wanted to stage it immediately, for it was
  the sort of thing he had always been happy to lose money over, like The
  Duchess of Malfi in modern dress, or Hauton Timorumenos as a musical comedy.
  They left the pub arm in arm, Carey between the two men; at Foy's big house
  in Well Walk they talked till long past midnight, electrically conscious that
  something important had happened in their lives. Unfortunately, as they found
  no later than the next morning, there were not enough Negro actors then in
  London to make the project feasible; but by that time Foy was keen on the
  play even if it were to be produced normally; or rather, he was hypnotized
  into a belief that anything with Paul in control would be better than
  anything else. It was luck indeed for Paul to have met such a man. Within a
  few hours Foy had engaged him to direct and choose a cast, and what had once
  been a joke became suddenly and fatefully true&mdash;Carey Arundel as
  Desdemona. A great chance for her, undoubtedly, and in grabbing it she was to
  learn much about acting and Shakespeare and herself, but even more about the
  man she had married.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The first thing she discovered was that his work made him a
changed
  person. He was possessed, and by something that could excusably be called a
  devil, since angelic possession exacts no price in sweat and fury. It had one
  curious and immediate effect; he was only in his late twenties, yet as soon
  as he took the stage he seemed old enough for no one to think of him
  disparagingly as young&mdash;at least ten years were added in appearance,
  plus an indefinable quality that made Foy once remark to Carey: "Is he aiming
  to be a maestro, or does it come naturally? It's a continental trick&mdash;
  English and Americans as a rule don't pick it up." Carey was more surprised
  than Foy, because her own limited theatre experience had prepared her so
  little for the effort that Paul demanded from everyone around him, including
  herself. It was a demand outrageous enough to stifle the protest that
  anything more reasonable might have drawn. For he had made it clear from the
  outset that he must be taken as he was or not at all; that being established,
  the situation left no opening for lukewarmness or compromise. Very soon she
  came to know what he had meant by defining a director's role as the
  communication of excitement. Hour after hour were spent, not in speaking or
  memorizing lines (which, in the beginning, he made light of) but in
  discussing the play from every angle until a law of diminishing returns
  seemed to operate and arguments became sharper without being more helpful. Up
  to that point, however, he had incited controversy; one dispute over the
  precise motivation of Iago's behaviour grew so heated that the actor taking
  that part walked off the stage in a huff. Paul dragged him back, exclaiming
  loudly enough to be heard by all the rest: "D'you realize what you've been
  doing? Here's a complex academic point in the interpretation of a character
  in a play written three hundred years ago&mdash;yet today on this stage you
  were almost coming to blows about it!"</p>

  <p>Iago began to stammer apologies.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Paul interrupted. "It's wonderful! Because it shows we've taken
  the first step&mdash;we're beginning to think the characters matter to us
  &mdash;we're shouting about them as if they were people we know. That's what
  I hoped for. But now comes the next step. Understanding is a BASIS for
  emotion, but no substitute. From now on we must begin to FEEL. The mind has
  had its feast&mdash;now comes the turn of the heart."</p>

  <p>Paul had a store of such gaudy sayings about acting and theatrecraft
  &mdash;"Just as the stage is larger than life, so words about it can afford
  to be bigger and more extravagant," was another of them. They did not always
  probe deeply, but they decorated his instruction and were apt to seem
  talismanic towards the end of a gruelling rehearsal. He got along well with
  the cast; he was thoughtful of them as artists, and the excitement he
  generated helped them to endure his occasional tantrums. As usual, there was
  no one at the Nonesuch Theatre shrewd enough to find out exactly how little
  Paul had done in New York, so he could magnify that achievement, not only for
  personal vainglory but because he knew that the greater they thought he was
  the luckier they would think themselves. In all this he was sustained by his
  own passionate belief in himself as a child of destiny in the theatre; he was
  like a poor man writing post-dated cheques for large sums but with complete
  assurance that he was honest.</p>

  <p>During this time his private happiness with Carey was equally sustaining,
  though he spent few daytime hours alone with her, and there was no moment of
  their lives, however intimate, which he was incapable of turning into a
  lecture or a lesson or some fragment of a rehearsal. In a half-amused way she
  relished this, for her own ambition had been rejuvenated and she was
  beginning to realize, not yet how much she was learning, but how little she
  had ever known before. She found she could help him too by her own greater
  tact in handling countless small situations&mdash;a stage-carpenter he had
  unwisely yelled at, the landlady of their flat who objected to Mozart on the
  gramophone at 2 A.M. He was usually inconsiderate about such matters. One
  thing, however, seemed large enough for her real concern&mdash;his attitude
  towards Henry Foy. Paul had become cool to the man, treating him offhandedly
  at rehearsals, sometimes omitting to consult him on points that were clearly
  in a theatre-owner's and play-backer's province. Carey rather liked Foy, who
  was always genial, conciliatory, and generous alike with hospitality and
  advice. But Paul declined to weigh all this. "Look, Carey, let's face it
  &mdash;at bottom he's an amateur, a dabbler&mdash;he's actually a nuisance at
  rehearsals&mdash;if I can make him stop attending them so much the
  better."</p>

  <p>"But surely the man has a right to potter about his own theatre."</p>

  <p>"No, not if he gets in the way. When he signed me to direct he delegated
  his rights&mdash;it's like a ship that carries the president of the line
  &mdash;the captain still gives the orders even though the other man owns the
  outfit."</p>

  <p>"But I'm sure a tactful captain tries to say a few polite words to the
  president now and again."</p>

  <p>"I've never been impolite. I'm just too busy to go to his parties and sit
  up half the night listening to pseudo-artistic claptrap."</p>

  <p>"I thought you enjoyed his parties. That first night we went to his house
  and stayed for hours&mdash;you were so enthusiastic."</p>

  <p>"Only because I knew I'd talked him into engaging me. I thought most of
  his ideas were half-baked, but it was worth while to let him believe I was
  impressed."</p>

  <p>"You know, Paul, you scare me sometimes&mdash;you're so utterly shameless.
  Don't you ever feel that Harry's giving you a big chance?"</p>

  <p>"I'm giving him a chance too. So far he's done nothing but lose money and
  fool around, but now he's due for a huge success and his precious little
  flea-bitten theatre will become famous all over London."</p>

  <p>"You really are quite sure of that, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, of course."</p>

  <p>He went on, scrutinizing her: "I think I can read your mind. You're
  wondering if I was equally sure in New York. You WERE wondering that, weren't
  you?" (It was true, she had been.) "Well, the answer's yes. And the plays
  flopped. I don't admit that to others, but you probably guessed anyhow... And
  what does it prove? That I can be wrong? Does that NEED proving?... All I can
  say is, count on me this time. Carey, it's terribly important that you should
  feel about it as I do. You HAVE to."</p>

  <p>She smiled and told him she did. She knew by now the rich support he took
  from her, and her satisfaction in that was almost enough to create the faith
  he asked for.</p>

  <p>With her own performance in the play he was both patient and severe. After
  the first week she said unhappily: "You don't seem to like anything I do. I'd
  hate to spoil the play, and from the way you criticize&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I criticize the others just as much, only you don't hear me. I never
  criticize anyone in the presence of anyone else."</p>

  <p>She was a little relieved by that, but still troubled. "I can't help
  wondering, though, if I'm equal to a part like this. Perhaps some actress
  with more experience in Shakespeare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Carey, you're not losing your ambition! You wouldn't give up NOW?"</p>

  <p>"Not if I can satisfy you, but if I can't&mdash;I couldn't bear not to
  &mdash;and there'll be some other play later on&mdash;something easier
  maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh?" He assumed the attitude which she called his 'pounce'. "And what
  makes you think you'd be any better in anything easier? I suppose you're
  hankering after some frothy little comedy where you have to light cigarettes
  and mix cocktails all the time! Don't kid yourself&mdash;you'd be just as bad
  in that if you're bad at all. But you AREN'T bad, and you're going to be
  good&mdash;you're going to be VERY good! Don't you believe in yourself
  yet?"</p>

  <p>There was no answering this sort of thing. Logical or not, it had rallying
  power. But she could not help marking the contrast between his first cautious
  opinion of her in Dublin and his unbounded optimism now; surely the change
  which that represented was in HIM far more than could possibly have happened
  in the quality of her acting. Yet she felt also that there was no conscious
  insincerity in his enthusiasm&mdash;that his own mind, under the hypnosis of
  the task, swung continually between the same poles&mdash;never satisfied,
  always confident. But what really tickled her was the way this attitude
  extended itself even to the play and the author; in Dublin he had often
  criticized Shakespeare, but now, as the rehearsals progressed, Shakespeare
  became faultless and Othello the greatest play ever written in the history of
  the world.</p>

  <p>One afternoon she met Foy in the street near his house. He asked her to
  come inside and see some designs for scenery that had just arrived. "Oppeler
  should have sent them to Paul, not to me&mdash;try to convince your husband
  this is no plot against his authority." His eyes twinkled as he said this,
  and she liked him for sharing with her an understanding of Paul that the
  latter would have vehemently denied.</p>

  <p>The designs she thought excellent, though she knew she was no judge. They
  had been suggested in a general way by Paul himself after long sessions with
  the artist; Foy's willingness to spend freely and his almost nave pleasure
  in giving Paul anything he wanted, touched her as it always did. She stayed
  for a while, enjoying conversation that was comfortable and, for a change,
  unexciting. Then, with the designs under her arm, she returned to the
  flat.</p>

  <p>Paul was sitting hunched over the living-room fire. He had taken a chill
  and had been dosing himself unsatisfactorily since early morning. He was
  inclined to baby himself over such things, and she thought there were signs
  in his posture, as if he had assumed it too quickly on hearing her footsteps
  on the stairs. She was beginning to find out these things about him now, and
  to love him all the more generously for most of them. He was a bad actor, as
  he often said; indeed, he said it so often that she wondered if he hoped that
  some day he would be contradicted. But she was willing enough to humour him,
  to fit herself into whatever drama could compensate for him for a bad cold.
  She put her arm affectionately round his shoulder and felt him pretend (she
  was sure it was that) to be startled. "Hello, darling&mdash;still feeling
  rotten?... Look at these&mdash;Harry sent them over." She gave him the folio
  of drawings, watching his face for a verdict. To her surprise he glanced at
  only a few of them, casually, then let them slip to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think they're good? Or would you rather not bother about them
  now? They can wait... How about some coffee, or a stiff drink, maybe?"</p>

  <p>He said sharply, looking up: "Why did Oppeler send them to Foy?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, and neither does Harry&mdash;he particularly asked me to
  tell you it wasn't his fault they didn't come direct to you. They should
  have, he knows it."</p>

  <p>"That relieves my mind enormously."</p>

  <p>"Oh, now, Paul, don't talk like that. How could he help it if the artist
  made a mistake?"</p>

  <p>"These drawings seem to be another of his mistakes."</p>

  <p>"You really haven't looked at them yet."</p>

  <p>"Enough to know that I'd rather do without scenery altogether. He'll have
  to try again."</p>

  <p>"They're as bad as that?"</p>

  <p>"How bad do they have to be? If they aren't good enough, they're bad."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure Oppeler's the right man? Perhaps someone else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course he's the right man. He's the best set designer in London if he
  ever gets a chance to prove it."</p>

  <p>"Tell him that, then he'll WANT to try again." She wondered how far his
  obduracy was loyalty to the artist or to his own judgment in choosing him,
  but whatever it was, the switch from attack to defence was characteristic.
  While she was thinking of this he turned on her suddenly. "How did it happen
  you got these from Foy?"</p>

  <p>"I met him in the street and he told me they'd just come."</p>

  <p>"He had them with him?"</p>

  <p>"No. They were at his house."</p>

  <p>"So you went to his house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What time did you meet him?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;about two o'clock. Or soon after."</p>

  <p>"It's four now. How long did you stay at his house?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps an hour. Does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"How COULD you spend a whole hour there? He's such a bore&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't bore me. We just talked."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"The theatre, of course&mdash;the play&mdash;you&mdash;me&mdash;
  him&mdash;he likes you so much." She said that because he always liked to
  hear that people liked him, even if he didn't like them, but this time there
  was no response except the sort of sarcasm that might have come from a
  bookish schoolboy; he said: "Again my mind is infinitely relieved."</p>

  <p>She faced him with dawning astonishment. "Paul... what's happened? Why are
  you talking about Harry like this?"</p>

  <p>"HARRY?... So you call him HARRY?"</p>

  <p>"So do you. So does everybody&mdash;we did from our first meeting, didn't
  we? Paul... PLEASE... it can't be that you&mdash;oh no, that would be too
  ridiculous."</p>

  <p>He stood up with his back to the fire, his face flushed, eyes glinting.
  "Carey, I'm not a fool&mdash;do you suppose I haven't noticed the way you
  look at that man every time he comes to the theatre? And his manner to you
  &mdash;he knows he attracts you&mdash;no wonder he won't miss a rehearsal.
  And the other day when he made all that fuss about something in his eye
  &mdash;a childish man&oelig;uvre&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But there was something, a little fly, and I got it out."</p>

  <p>"He didn't have to ask YOU! Any excuse, though&mdash;these drawings are
  another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Paul! This is really funny... almost... you think a man puts a fly in his
  eye just for the pleasure of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Carey, tell me this, why SHOULD he ask you to his house? Why not send
  over the drawings by messenger&mdash;he has servants and it's only a few
  blocks away! And an hour&mdash;with HIM&mdash;just for talk. How much do you
  expect me to swallow?"</p>

  <p>She was speechless for a moment; it was now beyond a joke, and as full
  awareness of what was happening took possession of her, she found she had no
  voice for anything but a few scattered sentences. "Paul, you know I love you.
  Are we actually quarrelling&mdash;and about something so utterly beyond
  reason?... I don't know what to say, except that... your suspicion... any
  suspicion you can possibly have... about anything... is just plain silly. You
  believe me, Paul, don't you?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her with hard eyes. "I believe you're becoming a very good
  actress."</p>

  <p>That changed her mood abruptly; she stepped away from him in a cold rage
  that made her feel physically sick. "All right. What more can I say?... It
  would be wasted time. I'm going out for a walk... Take your temperature and
  see if you still have a fever. Maybe that's what's driving you crazy."</p>

  <p>She dashed out of the room, snatching hat and coat on the way to the door.
  In the street a car just missed her as she ran across. She knew people were
  staring; she heard the man who had nearly run her down calling after her in
  anger. She checked her pace and turned into the first side-street. A few
  yards along this she heard footsteps overtaking her; Paul, dishevelled and
  panting, seized her arm and pulled her roughly to a standstill. "Come back
  &mdash;come back&mdash;" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Even at such a moment there was faint comedy in the thought that he who
  hated to run had actually been forced into a chase. She might have begun to
  smile had not she seen that his own gasps and chokings were partly of
  laughter. That made her more furious than ever. "No&mdash;leave me alone
  &mdash;I don't want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Carey&mdash;come back&mdash;I'll explain everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please let me take my walk."</p>

  <p>"But I want to explain&mdash;I can't talk to you while you're walking
  &mdash;Carey, darling&mdash;come back... I've got a temperature&mdash;I
  oughtn't to be out here in the cold air&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Two things leapt to her mind&mdash;first, that he had called her
  'darling'. He never had before&mdash;it was a word that did not come easily
  to him, except ironically or extravagantly when he addressed others. The
  second thing was his temperature. A gust of anxiety shook her about that. She
  let him lead her back to the flat without further protest and went straight
  to the bathroom for the thermometer.</p>

  <p>"Only just over ninety-nine," he said, following her and waving the
  instrument aside. "I took it just now&mdash;nothing to worry about. Let's
  have that drink."</p>

  <p>By this time her own emotions were too confused to seek expression. She
  felt weak and empty of concern, one way or another. "I must rest for a
  minute, Paul. This kind of thing upsets me."</p>

  <p>He came beside her, kneeling on the floor by the chair and pressing her
  hand to his face.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Carey&mdash;no need to be upset... just let me explain...
  don't interrupt..."</p>

  <p>"I'm too tired to interrupt."</p>

  <p>"Carey, I want to talk to you&mdash;about jealousy. Sexual jealousy. It's
  a terrible thing. It destroys the mind, it warps the judgment&mdash;it can
  make clever people stupid and stupid people murderous&mdash;it infects
  &mdash;it poisons&mdash;and when the victim's innocent the others become
  innocent too, but in a horrible kind of way... Do you remember how you first
  reacted&mdash;the feeling you had when I told you my suspicion? You were
  STUPEFIED. Not indignant, at first&mdash;not angry&mdash;not even
  protesting... but BEWILDERED. The look on your face&mdash;blank&mdash;
  expressionless&mdash;uncomprehending. Then later you told me very simply how
  much you loved me, how wrong I was... Only after that, when I said I still
  didn't believe you&mdash;only THEN you got mad and lost your temper... for
  which I don't blame you a bit... Did you ever notice the eyes of a dog that
  hasn't done what he's accused of, but because master is master his only
  reaction is innocence itself&mdash;the sheer acceptance of limitless
  injustice from the limitlessly beloved? You have to think of animals nowadays
  to visualize that&mdash;a modern heroine isn't capable of it. But Desdemona
  WAS, the poor sucker, and it's the key to the whole interpretation&mdash;you
  have to play the first two attitudes&mdash; bewilderment and pure
  heartbreaking innocence&mdash;without ever touching the third
  one&mdash;anger! See?... And by the way, there was one true thing I
  said&mdash;that you were becoming a good actress. That's what struck me as
  funny&mdash;to pay you my first real compliment and have you stalk out of the
  room as if you'd been insulted!... But those two things&mdash;hang on to
  them, won't you?&mdash;first the bewilderment, then the simple statement of
  innocence... Why, what's wrong? What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I think I'm beginning to find out&mdash;what's the matter&mdash;with
  you."</p>

  <p>He laughed again, but comfortably now&mdash;a chuckle, as at a practical
  joke so comic that the victim should at least be sporting enough to smile.
  "Carey, don't you see?&mdash;I wanted you to learn from the heart, not from
  the mind! And you did&mdash;even my bad acting took you in completely. Good
  God, it must have done, for you to think THAT... and Harry of all people!...
  But I believe it'll help you to feel the character&mdash;she's a difficult
  dame, probably the hardest of all Shakespeare's heroines, because the way she
  takes a beating isn't really meekness, it's a sort of strength in disguise
  &mdash;fascinating the way it builds up during the course of the play
  &mdash;if you'd like us both to go over it again&mdash;the handkerchief
  scene, begin with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no. It isn't so much the part that's troubling me now."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'm glad you feel more confident."</p>

  <p>She couldn't control her tears, of pity for him as well as of fading anger
  and growing relief, but there was a glimpse of horror in his ready assumption
  that all was well, that his explanation, once made, could instantly undo all
  the mischief.</p>

  <p>He continued jauntily: "Remember in Dublin I said that when an actor feels
  an emotion intensely it's natural for him to act? Here's the corollary
  &mdash;that to make him act you must sometimes make him feel intensely...
  shock treatment... to get the final rightness&mdash;to pin it down once and
  for all. We'll know tomorrow if that's happened to you."</p>

  <p>"Something else may have happened too. Isn't it a bit dreadful, Paul, to
  be willing to risk so much? Supposing you hadn't caught up with me in the
  street&mdash;suppose I'd had hours to walk and think and worry... wouldn't it
  have mattered to you at all? Perhaps you'd have laughed all the more... And I
  nearly got run over." She began to laugh herself at last, though with a touch
  of hysteria. "Quite a joke, on every score. And all those things you said
  about Harry&mdash;the nonsense you invented&mdash;how CAN you use your
  friends like that?"</p>

  <p>"Now look, Carey, I only called him a bore&mdash;and I think he is, but if
  you don't, that's fine&mdash;he's not a bad fellow, we both know that..."
  Then he caught a note behind her laughter that made him add, in simple
  wonderment: "You aren't REALLY upset, are you?... Oh, if you are, I'm sorry.
  I'm a son of a bitch at times like this&mdash;I have the damned play on my
  mind&mdash;I don't think of anything else. But if you ever leave me I don't
  know what I'll do... that's what I was thinking all the time I was talking
  the nonsense&mdash;I was thinking, suppose it WAS true, suppose you WERE
  carrying on with Harry or some other man... what WOULD I do?"</p>

  <p>She was laughing now in the sheer pleasure of hearing him confess so much.
  "Stifle me, perhaps, as in the play?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'd think you were lucky and I deserved what I got, because I know
  I'm not good enough for you. I mean that, Carey."</p>

  <p>They made love, then had drinks, then looked over the drawings to decide
  what had to be changed. By that time it was dusk and he declared his cold so
  much better that he would enjoy a good dinner in town, so they went to the
  restaurant in Lisle Street in a mood of celebration. After the bizarre events
  of the day she was very happy.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary thing was that when she rehearsed in the morning there
  was such a marked improvement in her performance that she startled herself as
  well as the others. For the first time in her life she enjoyed an experience
  that was later to become the thing aimed for&mdash;a sudden swimming bliss in
  which her own self split effortlessly into two identities, the one Desdemona,
  the other a calm observer of herself acting. When she finished there was no
  need for Paul to tell her she had been excellent. She knew it in her bones,
  with a warm satisfaction that made it pleasant to reply quietly: "You said I
  would be, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Paul, of course, enjoyed no such serenities. Nor, she was sure, did there
  ever come to him a sense of incredibility in the contrast between this
  terrific emotional and creative effort on the part of a dedicated few and the
  apathy of the multitude which, if the play were to succeed, it must conquer
  and divert. She had an idea that Paul regarded audiences too arrogantly even
  to think of this, much less to be appalled by it; he would give people not
  what THEY wanted, but what HE wanted, thus involving him in the further task
  of making them WANT what he wanted. No one could essay this without an
  eagerness to be consumed, and it was true that, as opening night approached,
  Paul reached flashpoint; his whole being clenched into a total effect of
  alertness, so that it could be said that he neither saw nor heard, but
  constantly watched and listened. She wondered how he could keep it up, but
  she guessed that some of the physical energy he forbore to expend was somehow
  transmuted into these more combustible channels. Yet there was nothing of the
  conventional ascetic about him; he ate prodigiously (he could do this without
  gaining weight during such stressful days), drank quite enough, smoked cigars
  all the time, sat up half the night and fell into dreamless sleep from about
  4 A.M. till 10. While he was asleep his breathing was often imperceptible, he
  rarely turned or stirred, and his face, usually pale because he spent so
  little time out of doors, became paler still; there was only one word that
  occurred to her, though she tried never to think of it&mdash;he looked DEAD,
  as if he had switched off the waking turbine by some act of deliberation.
  Physically he grew lazier as the ultimate ordeal approached; he would call a
  taxi for the short distance to the theatre, and during later rehearsals he
  would sit in one of the back-row seats for hours on end, summoning actors
  next to him for private talk. Or else Foy would arrive with news about
  programmes, posters, advertisements, box-office arrangements, and be regally
  motioned to another adjacent seat to wait his turn. Paul had a lively finger
  in every pie, and was quite capable of making the size of the ticket-stubs an
  issue for first-class bickering. It was against his nature to delegate
  authority, he much preferred to enlist willing slaves; and perhaps Carey's
  appeal to him to treat Foy more generously did have some effect, for during
  the final weeks of preparation Paul received him back to favour in the role
  of an overburdened but unfailingly cheerful office-boy.</p>

  <p>To Carey the kind of man she had married became a source of increasing
  wonderment. She was aware of his separateness in a world she could not invade
  with him, and when he returned to her, as from this world, it was often to
  talk of its glories in a way that might have bored her had she not loved him.
  She knew him too well now to expect him to share so many simple things that
  she enjoyed&mdash;a few hours taking pot-luck at a local cinema, fun with the
  landlady's cat, a walk on Hampstead Heath in the morning, with the yellow
  autumn sun peering through mists above London's roof-tops. Yet she remembered
  that their first real acquaintance had been during a long walk in Phoenix
  Park, and that on the night before he left Dublin he had actually walked the
  mile or so from Rowden's house to her own in Terenure. Walking thus became a
  symbol of what he had once done, for her and with her, but would no longer
  do. Was it because, as with his first cordiality to Foy, he could always
  bring himself to do things if he thought them worth while for some personal
  end? She did not much care. If he had been so keen to know her that he had
  paid a price of any kind, it only proved how keen he had been. And he still
  was, she knew that, because he had explored so much more of the ways in which
  she could help him. She sometimes thought that after the crisis of
  love-making came a second and perhaps to him a deeper one that had grown up
  out of her own subconscious desire to play whatever part he cast her for; in
  this she would cradle him in an embrace that was almost sexless, yet as close
  to him (she felt instinctively) as she could ever get.</p>

  <p>Once he talked about his mother in Milwaukee. "She doesn't get on too well
  with my brother and his wife. The first thing I'll do when I've made some
  money is to take her away somewhere else&mdash;New York, London, anywhere
  &mdash;she wouldn't mind, so long as it's near me... I suppose you're
  surprised to find I have an ambition in life that isn't connected with the
  theatre?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "But I'm rather glad. It seems to give me a
  chance."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It would be an exaggeration to say that Paul Saffron's
Othello
  (Shakespeare's being a name too well known to be worth mentioning) at the
  Nonesuch Theatre, Hampstead, on December Twenty-Seventh, Nineteen-Twenty-Two,
  made theatrical history; it was, however, a big event in the lives of both
  Paul and Carey, because it was their first success together, so they could
  both feel they were lucky for each other. The London press was favourable,
  and since praise for a Shakespeare play is primarily for the production, Paul
  could not have found a better vehicle to advertise himself. Carey was praised
  too, her performance being hailed by one important reviewer as "the only
  Desdemona I ever saw who didn't seem more dumb than innocent".</p>

  <p>In other respects Paul's optimistic prophecies proved wrong. Foy did not
  make any fortune, nor did his theatre achieve the fame that would establish
  it in the regular West End firmament (indeed, the controversy about 'Tis Pity
  She's a Whore had given it far more spectacular publicity). The truth was
  that only a limited number of people wished to see Othello, however well
  done, and only a limited number of these would make the journey by Tube to
  Hampstead. The play, moreover, had been staged so expensively, to meet Paul's
  every whim, that it could yield only a moderate profit if the house were
  always full, and after the first few weeks there were enough empty seats to
  whittle down any accumulated surplus. All of which might have been called a
  disappointment by those who remembered Paul's extravagant forecasts. Paul was
  not one of them. He seemed unperturbed, even bored by the box-office returns,
  and once he casually remarked that he had never expected financial success at
  all, and that the excellent critical notices were a complete satisfaction of
  his aim. Whether or not this was true, Carey reached a tentative conclusion
  that in the larger sense he was indifferent to money; what he did want were
  plaudits, power, prestige, and the satisfaction of a boundless artistic ego
  &mdash;plus, of course, enough of someone else's money to spend and, if
  necessary, to lose. There remained, however, a question she could not answer
  either then or whenever afterwards it recurred&mdash;was his tremendous
  all-embracing optimism before the opening night of any of his plays
  authentic, or part of an enthusiasm deliberately generated as part of the
  basic strategy of stage-direction? Or, to put it another way, did he always
  fool himself when he fooled others?</p>

  <p>Something else emerged as an insight into his make-up; the play being now
  launched, he clearly suffered a kind of spiritual anti-climax. He idled and
  became restless, flinging himself into occasional re-rehearsals as if in
  desperate intent to recapture something. During the nightly performances he
  would watch from the wings in a state of excitement mainly self-induced
  because he felt it his continuing duty to inspire and encourage, but the
  effort wore thin at times, and on the way home afterwards he was often morose
  until she had cheered him, as she always could and did.</p>

  <p>Othello lasted twelve weeks and then ended not because of Foy's insistence
  on a profit (as Paul wrote years later in a book of reminiscences, though it
  would not have been too unreasonable even if true), but because Paul himself
  had by that time received several offers to direct plays in the real West End
  and had already chosen one of them&mdash;with a part for Carey, of course.
  Foy sized up the situation shrewdly and was amiable enough to do so without
  resentment. It had been all right while it lasted, he told Carey, though he
  added: "You probably think Paul and I have got along pretty well, but
  actually there've been a few times when I'd have punched his nose if I hadn't
  remembered that hitting a genius is like hitting a woman&mdash;except that
  they deserve it oftener."</p>

  <p>"So you'd call Paul a genius?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dare deny it if someone else challenged me. Just watching him
  taught me more about the theatre in four months than I'd learned before in
  twenty years. He made me feel an amateur."</p>

  <p>She knew him almost well enough to reply: "That's what he said you were",
  but it would have been too much the sort of riposte that Paul himself could
  never have resisted. Yet there was, between her and Foy, and later between
  her and many other people, an awareness of Paul as a phenomenon to be
  discussed in a spirit of detached investigation, with no sense of personal
  disloyalty and little capacity to be startled or even hurt by what was
  revealed.</p>

  <p>"So you see," Foy added, "it's been an experience for me and a
  stepping-stone for him&mdash;now he can push ahead and discover the facts of
  life, such as how many seats in the house, how much per seat, how much on the
  weekly salary sheet&mdash;that kind of thing. He's so wonderful at everything
  else, he really ought to learn arithmetic... Anyway, I wish him well and I
  hope he scores a real hit with the new play."</p>

  <p>Paul didn't. It was a flop&mdash;so instant and ignominious that he
  crossed the Atlantic immediately.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="part2"
     id="part2">PART TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One day about six years later she was driving with Paul to
  the Pocono Mountains. Their play had closed down for the summer and it was a
  relief to escape from the heat of New York to the scarcely cooler but much
  more endurable countryside. They had a house near Stroudsburg and would spend
  July and August there; Carey loved the place, and if Paul treated it as a
  necessary boredom to be lived through from time to time, she was sure it did
  him good in many ways he would have strenuously denied. The servants from the
  apartment had gone on ahead and everything would be in order when they
  arrived&mdash;much more so, doubtless, than ever again during their stay, for
  Paul had a habit of disrupting household arrangements in town and country
  alike.</p>

  <p>She had made this journey often enough for the Delaware Water Gap to have
  become a symbol of holiday, the mental border-line of work and relaxation.
  Now, as she saw it again, she could not restrain her delight. "Paul, it's so
  good to be here at last&mdash;it makes me know how much I needed this." The
  words and the way she spoke them sounded older than her looks, which were at
  the full radiance of twenty-four; but early success and early marriage had
  built in her an illusion of maturity that was at least as real as a part well
  played. She sometimes thought that the ways in which Paul had never grown up
  were compensated for by those in which she herself had done so fast and
  far.</p>

  <p>Paul did not answer because he had fallen asleep. He was a little
  overweight (a long run always did that to him), and the drive had combined
  with a rather dull play script to make him drowsy. She gave him the warm yet
  wry scrutiny of a woman who had been married a number of years to a
  celebrity; that is, she enjoyed the spectacle of the hero unheroic&mdash; the
  large lolling head, papers crumpled under a finicky hand, the face dubiously
  sombre and far too pale. Enough of the world conceded now that Paul was a
  great stage director, including those who also thought she herself was a
  pretty good actress. She treasured that tottering compliment; it seemed to
  suit her private thesis that if she were even near good it was because she
  was near Paul.</p>

  <p>As always when he was asleep he had that look of absence that sometimes
  scared her, making him ageless, so that it was odd, rather than hard, to
  realize he was only thirty-six. Probably he had only escaped being called a
  boy-wonder because in public he had never looked like a boy. But in this, as
  in so many other things, he ran to extremes&mdash;babyishness at moments,
  usually for her alone to witness and indulge; at other moments the air of
  being biblically, almost Mosaically old. Yet at all times in his work he wore
  the authority of one whose years had had no real meaning in his life. She
  often wondered what their children would have been&mdash;either geniuses or
  idiots, she told people, glossing over with a joke the fact that they could
  have no children.</p>

  <p>She watched the familiar road as it curved alongside the river. Their
  house was half-way up a hillside a few miles ahead; fat maples surrounded it,
  which could have been why it was called Mapledurham, though there was a place
  in England of the same name that might have some connection. It was a
  pleasant house, old enough to have been worth an expensive modernizing; the
  rooms were large and cool to the eye; the gardens not too formal. And on
  their arrival there would be tea waiting, English style (coffee for Paul);
  Walter would have put on a white jacket and transformed himself from a
  caretaker to a butler of sorts, and his Airedale would break established
  rules by nibbling from her plate. All this to look forward to as the Packard
  covered the miles on a summer afternoon.</p>

  <p>In sheer exuberance she chatted with Jerry during the last lap of the
  journey. He was a good-looking southern boy whom they had employed as
  chauffeur for several years and who had developed an affectionate tolerance
  for the habits of theatre people. He said now, offhand as usual: "Mr. Paul
  got another play in mind?"</p>

  <p>She said no; the one they had been in all the year would be resumed in
  September.</p>

  <p>"I just figgered he might have, though&mdash;he's bin acting like he
  wanted one, these last few weeks."</p>

  <p>This alarmed her a little, for she had caught a whiff of the same
  misgiving herself. But she answered decisively, as if saying so could make it
  final: "He needs a rest, Jerry, and so do I. That's what we've come here for.
  I don't care how bored he is, he's got to rest."</p>

  <p>It had happened before, and doubtless would do so again&mdash;that Paul,
  having launched a highly successful play, had tired of it after the first few
  months and was secretly longing for it to end, so that he could give his
  undivided attention to something else. Whereas Carey was always happy
  throughout a long run, because it meant comparative ease and assured
  prosperity&mdash;things she was human enough to enjoy as long as they would
  last. Of course Paul was comfortably off; they had both had luck during
  recent years, and a flop now and again could not harass them financially. But
  there was more than money in her reckoning. A new play was an ordeal,
  increasingly so as both Paul and the critics expected more of her; the weeks
  of rehearsal could become a nightmare of hard work and high tension&mdash;
  thrilling if it all ended in triumph, but no experience to be sought
  wantonly. And this wantonness was in Paul. It was not that he did not enjoy
  success himself&mdash;he worshipped it; but he was like a mountaineer who
  cannot relax on a summit to enjoy a smoke and the view, but must itch
  immediately to descend and climb another.</p>

  <p>At Mapledurham not only the tea and the Airedale were duly waiting, but
  also, standing up as they entered the drawing-room, there was a tall slim
  young man who introduced himself as Malcolm Beringer. The name was unknown to
  her, and the elegant way he pronounced it did not remove her suspicion that
  he had no business there, or at least that his business was of a kind they
  didn't want to be bothered with on their first day in the country. "I hope
  you'll excuse this intrusion..." he began smoothly, whereupon Paul looked him
  up and down and snapped: "You're damned right it's an intrusion. I don't know
  you, and I don't care who you are or what you've come for, you can't see me
  or my wife without an appointment."</p>

  <p>Carey turned back into the hall where Jerry was dumping bags from the car.
  She hated scenes, and this was a type she could never get used to. She was
  usually torn between solicitude for Paul, who needed protection from all
  kinds of crackpots and time-wasters, and sympathy with the adventurers who
  wanted him to read their plays or give them acting jobs. But today she had no
  such sympathy; it seemed intolerable that a stranger should actually stalk
  them to their retreat. She sought out Walter. "Why on earth did you let that
  man in? What does he want? How long has he been here?"</p>

  <p>"'Bout an hour. I didn't know whether to let him in or not, but he said he
  knew Mr. Paul would want to see him. Something about a play, he said."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Walter, how COULD you be so easily handled?... Well, we can expect to
  see him thrown out on his ear any moment now... you know what Paul's like."
  It was natural for her to speak of him as Paul to those within the household;
  they called him MR. Paul, with the Mister somehow a mark of deference to her
  rather than to him.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed, and Paul's voice from the adjoining room, at first
  upraised, had become mysteriously inaudible. Carey felt she must investigate;
  once a similar silence had been due to a young man fainting. She re-entered
  the drawing-room with the upset feeling that Paul's behaviour so often caused
  her. Surprisingly, however, she found a quiet, almost a cosy conversation in
  progress, and when Paul turned to her there was the beam on his face that was
  usually reserved for a good performance at a final dress rehearsal. It
  disconcerted her now, and still more so when he called out briskly: "Oh,
  Carey, I've asked Mr. Beringer to stay to dinner. Will you tell Walter? And
  by the way... you remember I once said Wagner might have done Everyman as an
  opera, but he didn't... Well, now, here's this Mr. Beringer with another
  idea..."</p>

  <p>Carey smiled wanly, murmuring something, and was glad of an excuse to get
  away. Oh God, she thought, OH GOD... For this sort of thing, too, had
  happened before.</p>

  <p>She did not conceal her ill-humour when she joined them at the table a
  couple of hours later. It was maddening that this first evening at
  Mapledurham, which she had hoped to spend alone with Paul, chatting
  unimportantly, strolling in the garden with the dog and going to bed early,
  should be taken up by an outsider. During the meal the subject of Everyman
  did not crop up again, and she was heartily glad of that; she was in no mood
  for any kind of shop talk. She wondered if Mr. Beringer were canny enough to
  sense this, for once or twice he seemed to steer conversation away from the
  theatre when Paul was inching towards it. He was certainly an entertaining
  young man, if one had wanted to be entertained. As it was, she treated him
  with a minimum of warmth and excused herself as soon after the coffee as she
  decently could. Paul and he would doubtless discuss their precious Everyman
  when she had gone. Hours later, while she was still reading in bed, she heard
  the front door bang but no sound of a car starting. Then Paul came in. He was
  in the condition she often called 'basking'; it occurred whenever contact
  with some new idea or personality swept the accumulated dust of boredom out
  of his mind.</p>

  <p>"I told you, Carey, this fellow Beringer has an idea for Everyman."</p>

  <p>"Has he? Who is he, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"A neighbour&mdash;he's staying at Moat Farm. He walked over. Pity it was
  tonight when you were tired, but I suppose he was anxious to break the ice of
  a first meeting. You certainly gave him that... the ice, I mean."</p>

  <p>"And you bawled him out at the top of your voice."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I did at first, didn't I?" He laughed as if it were already a
  reminiscence of long ago, to be savoured with amazement. "Well, we'll be
  seeing him again and you'll probably like him better."</p>

  <p>There was no use opposing the inevitable. She said, summoning
  cheerfulness: "Darling, I'm sure I will, and if he's going to be a friend of
  yours I'll be specially nice to him next time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't have to put on any act. It's me he wants to impress."</p>

  <p>He had the look in his eyes she knew so well and was afraid of, because it
  was both shrewd and guileless, so that in recognizing that the young man had
  sought to impress him he did not debar himself from a willingness to be
  impressed.</p>

  <p>"What is it he wants you to do?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"He has an idea, that's all. He thinks Everyman would make a motion
  picture."</p>

  <p>"And of course he wants to interest YOU in the project?"</p>

  <p>"There is no project, but I AM interested in Everyman&mdash;you know that.
  Seems he read some piece I wrote about it years ago. That's why he came to me
  rather than any of the picture people. He wanted my advice."</p>

  <p>"Only advice?"</p>

  <p>"That's all. I told him I knew nothing at all about motion pictures."</p>

  <p>"Then what kind of advice could you give him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now, Carey, you're splitting hairs. There's all kinds of advice I can
  give a bright young man if he's interested in something I'm interested in.
  You know I've always had an idea to do Everyman on the stage."</p>

  <p>She could see his face in the mirror; he was taking his tie off with a
  gesture she felt she would remember if she were to go blind and deaf and
  forget his looks and his voice. He had once told her, apropos of some
  discussion of ballet, that of all the movements incidental to male
  undressing, only the removal of a bow tie could be done with flair; the
  others, particularly the stepping out of pants, were banal... She said
  sleepily: "So long as you don't get yourself stuck with anything, Paul. You
  promised you were going to take a real rest."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I know, and if that damned play weren't reopening in
  September... "</p>

  <p>The implication was that if the play, their almost fabulously successful
  play, were not reopening in September he could have all the rest he needed;
  and this, she knew, was nonsense; only the play kept him from the far more
  arduous business of staging its successor. But it had got to the point now
  when the play was a scapegoat; he hated its guts, though towards the end of
  August he would order a few frantic corrective rehearsals in which he would
  behave as if it were a masterpiece. There was, of course, no compelling
  reason why he could not put on another play while the successful one was
  still running, but he shied away from this, partly because he wanted a part
  for Carey in everything he directed, but mainly because he shrank from
  proving that anything he had once started could possibly continue to exist
  without his constant attention. Nor could he tell himself rationally and
  mundanely that here was a harmless little comedy hit that might run another
  year, maybe longer&mdash;easy on audiences, because it didn't make them
  think, easy on Carey because it was tailor-made for her, easy on the
  pay-sheet because there was just one set with a cast of five. True, it was a
  trifle, but since he had chosen to do it in the first place, why complain
  because it was making a small fortune for everyone connected with it,
  including himself?</p>

  <p>She said: "Look, Paul, get to bed and don't lie awake thinking about plays
  or anything else. I'm going to sleep the clock round, and then tomorrow..."
  She was about to say she would take a long walk, but that was one of the
  things he would not share with her, so she changed it to: "Tomorrow we'll sit
  in the garden and pretend we haven't a care in the world. Not much pretence
  needed, either. We're very lucky people&mdash;doesn't that ever occur to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, but we mustn't sit back and HOARD luck. That's just the way to lose
  it."</p>

  <p>It seemed to her about the most disquieting answer he could have
  given.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Carey had received several offers from motion picture
companies but had
  turned them down because she would not think of doing anything without Paul,
  and though Paul had received feelers himself, they had never in his case
  reached the point of a firm offer because he had always made it clear that he
  would want complete control of everything&mdash;story, cast, direction,
  production, cutting, and music; and as he was prompt to add that he knew
  nothing about motion pictures and hardly ever saw them, the movie moguls were
  doubtless intrigued, but not enough to buy Carey at such a price. Actually
  all this was very much of a pose. He knew a great deal about motion pictures
  and had seen many. It was also a fact that shortly after their marriage he
  and Carey had lived in Hollywood for about a year. That year had been one of
  failure, and as if to propitiate obscure deities he would never talk of it,
  or even admit its existence. Carey had no such feeling herself, but she was
  aware of his, and made it one of her own secrets also. It was thus without
  any sense of untruth that Paul could indulge in one of his favourite
  confessions&mdash;that when once he had been stranded in Los Angeles for a
  few hours he had been curious enough to ask a taximan to drive him around
  Hollywood, but the expedition had covered such dreary territory that he could
  only (in fairness to such a world-famous name) conclude that the driver must
  have lost his way.</p>

  <p>But now a few conversations with Malcolm Beringer, a young man of no
  particular standing or importance, were enough to effect a change&mdash; not,
  it is true, in his attitude towards Hollywood, but certainly in his angle of
  aloofness towards motion pictures in general. Perhaps Malcolm's deficiencies
  were even an asset, for Paul was no respecter of big names and rather enjoyed
  the caprice of paying attention to the unknown, always provided they had
  qualities to attract him. Malcolm, moreover, was fey, and Carey, being Irish,
  was on her guard against this from the outset. After his second visit to
  Mapledurham, she tried to find out how far Paul was in danger of losing his
  normally keen judgment, but all she got was another discussion of Everyman.
  Then suddenly, to her direct question, Paul answered: "I'll tell you one
  reason why I like him. It's because he reminds me of myself at his age. No
  money, no name&mdash;just ideas and ambition."</p>

  <p>She had to laugh at that. "It can't be so long since you WERE his age,
  Paul. He must be thirty at least. So don't treat him like a son."</p>

  <p>"Of course I wouldn't. To him I'm just an older man who's already made his
  way in the world. A very pleasant relationship can be had on that basis."</p>

  <p>"Like you and Mr. Rowden in Dublin?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps... though I hadn't thought of it."</p>

  <p>(She knew she had touched a nerve. Rowden was dead; they had seen it in
  the papers some years back. Paul had been sad after reading the obituary and
  had said then, without subsequent explanation, "I don't think I treated him
  very well. He wanted to help me and I wouldn't let him.")</p>

  <p>She answered: "Perhaps, then, it isn't Malcolm who's anything like you
  used to be, but you who fancy yourself growing up to be like Mr. Rowden...
  Only I hope you won't."</p>

  <p>"Oh? I wouldn't be ashamed of myself if I did."</p>

  <p>"But I still hope you don't."</p>

  <p>Some sort of major issue was being stated by them, but in a minor key and
  without emphasis. He said after a pause: "All I meant is that Rowden was kind
  to me and I wasn't as kind to him as I ought to have been, in some ways. You
  don't know all the facts."</p>

  <p>It was on her tongue to reply: "Perhaps you don't, either"&mdash;but she
  checked herself and smiled. She said instead: "Darling, we're getting into
  deep waters. Just don't let Malcolm tempt you into anything you don't really
  want. That's all _I_ mean."</p>

  <p>He laughed and said there was no fear of Malcolm tempting him at all
  &mdash;either into what he wanted or what he didn't want. "I only tempt
  myself," he added. "And then, invariably, I yield." This being the kind of
  epigram, half purloined as a rule, with which he liked to end an argument,
  she was satisfied to say no more for the time being.</p>

  <p>But Malcolm still remained, to her at least, a somewhat mysterious person.
  Everyman to him was charged with modern significance; he read into it some
  vast cosmic meaning that Carey would not for the world have disputed. Paul,
  on the other hand, saw it theatrically&mdash;as sheer spectacle and drama.
  They were probably well matched as collaborators, which is what Carey soon
  discovered them to be; and again it alarmed her, if only because it was
  unlike Paul to be able to collaborate with anybody about anything. Then it
  appeared that Paul was actually planning picture shots while Malcolm was
  writing a script.</p>

  <p>She pretended to be casual. "It's all right if it interests you, Paul, but
  what does Malcolm expect to come of it? I hope you haven't promised him
  anything. It's so easy nowadays to get yourself in a tangle."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's not that kind. We have no written agreements, anyway. Nothing to
  sue about."</p>

  <p>"He can't be working like this for fun, though."</p>

  <p>"Why not? What would you have him do for fun? Play golf?"</p>

  <p>"All right, darling&mdash;enjoy your joke. Golf wouldn't do your figure
  any harm."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinning it down again now. I lost two pounds last week."</p>

  <p>Another bad sign. She said, still trying to disguise her seriousness:
  "Paul, why don't you tell me what's in that busy mind of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. There's no secret about it&mdash;never has been. I've always said
  that one of these days I'll make a picture."</p>

  <p>"But when will you find the time? The play's quite likely to run all
  through next year."</p>

  <p>"If it does it won't need me to keep it going."</p>

  <p>This was the first time he had ever said anything so sensible, yet in
  another way so ominous. She replied, still casually: "True, of course. Plenty
  of people commute between New York and Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"Hollywood? Good God, you can't imagine anyone there would be interested
  in Everyman?"</p>

  <p>"Who would, then?"</p>

  <p>Expansively he answered: "Only the public. Only Thomas, Richard, and
  Henry, to whose pursuit of happiness the movies ought to be dedicated. Only
  the kind of people who paid to see Shakespeare and hear Wagner and read
  Dickens&mdash;only the world audience that never has missed a good thing
  whenever one comes along."</p>

  <p>This was the surest danger signal of all, because she knew he did not mean
  it. Artistically he was an authoritarian; he did what pleased him and had
  small regard for popular taste as an arbiter of quality. But when it suited
  him he could take the opposite and currently fashionable view, and chance
  acquaintances who caught him in such moods were apt to retain a wrong
  impression for life. Carey, however, was not taken in. She knew that when he
  said something he did not mean he must be meaning something he would not
  say.</p>

  <p>She said quietly (ignoring Thomas, Richard, and Henry, as well as
  Shakespeare, Wagner, and Dickens): "But what about Malcolm? Has he done film
  work before? Come to that, Paul, has he had any theatrical or dramatic
  experience at all?"</p>

  <p>Paul gave her an affectionately derisive pat. "You're so practical, Carey.
  I'm glad I can answer yes. Malcolm once worked with Reinhardt in
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought that would have recommended him to you."</p>

  <p>He began to chuckle in lazy anticipation of a point about to be scored.
  "Ah, but Reinhardt FIRED him. I checked up on it. They disagreed. You know,
  Carey, he practically told Reinhardt to go jump in a lake!" He added, still
  chuckling: "And in German, I hope."</p>

  <p>He had had this grudge against Reinhardt ever since their first and only
  meeting, though the real reason why the two had apparently disliked each
  other on sight was doubtless that they were both dictators and
  perfectionists. At any rate, they had had a fantastic tantrum about something
  &mdash;fantastic because in its final stages Reinhardt had volleyed in German
  and Paul in English, both shouting together, with a Reinhardt minion
  translating like mad between them, and Carey standing by in much
  embarrassment but with an awareness that she would find the incident
  exquisitely funny in retrospect. Which she always did&mdash;as now.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">For the one thing she had held on to, throughout all the
routines of
  effort and failure, effort and success, was a sense of humour. It was an odd
  humour, rooted in a profound acceptance of the incongruities of life and
  perhaps also in that background of Ireland and Catholicism which, though she
  might seem to have lost both, was&mdash;at a deeper level&mdash;beyond her
  power to surrender. Paul, she knew, did not laugh in the same way or at the
  same things; especially he could not laugh at himself. But gradually, over a
  period of years, he had grown used to the way she laughed at him, and at
  themselves; he believed he had conceded her the privilege, and she never let
  him realize it was something neither of them could have prevented. Nor did he
  know how many times her own special humour had eased him out of trouble. When
  he was most unreasonable there was a way her mouth could twist which was
  hardly a smile, yet could bring the temperature down like a breeze through an
  opened window.</p>

  <p>So in admitting that she would have been nothing without him, she had
  private knowledge that he without her would have made extra enemies and kept
  fewer friends. The one field in which he was almost impeccable and infallible
  was the theatre itself&mdash;that abstraction which to him was far more than
  the building or even the play. The theatre freed him from all that made
  muddle in his life, so that on the stage decision came to him purely and
  instantly from something deeper than his mind and sharper than his brain.
  When he directed her in comedy he seemed even to understand her sense of
  humour, doubtless because he was then in control of it. To understand
  anything he had to be in control. "I'm right when I do what I want," he had
  once told her. "I'm wrong when I try to compromise or please others." He
  meant, of course, in his work, but it was perhaps natural that an arrogance
  so unarguably justified should tend to become a habit elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Those weeks at Mapledurham during that summer of 1929 were somehow crucial
  to Carey; it was as if the Everyman-Beringer affair acted like a catalyst,
  intensifying a vision of things already seen obscurely. Her life with Paul,
  she realized, had acquired a texture. She must guard him constantly from the
  kind of mundane error he was prone to; on the other hand, in anything touched
  by his infallibility she must not try to influence him at all, and for her
  own ultimate sake as much as his. The problem lay in the delimiting of
  worlds. Perhaps it was a good thing, she reflected with a twisted smile for
  herself alone, that popes should not marry.</p>

  <p>Thus, when she saw that the Everyman collaboration was more than a whim,
  she ceased to be openly critical of it, though she kept a watchful eye on
  Malcolm. That young man spent most of his time at Mapledurham, walking over
  from Moat Farm early in the morning and returning late at night; he and Paul
  were closeted together (the old-fashioned phrase seemed to suit the
  situation) for five or six hours each day. Usually Paul had discussed all his
  work with her, seeking not advice, but a sounding-board for his ideas; about
  this Everyman project, however, he became gradually less confiding. Once when
  she taxed him with this he answered that he knew she didn't approve what he
  was doing, so he had chosen not to worry her.</p>

  <p>"But Paul, I'd worry still more if I thought you had secrets from me."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's no secret any more. I'm going to make a film with Malcolm in
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"GERMANY?"</p>

  <p>"They have the best techniques there&mdash;and in France&mdash;they're the
  only places where the art of the film isn't dying of infantile
  paralysis."</p>

  <p>"And it's all... arranged... already?"</p>

  <p>"Practically all."</p>

  <p>"Including the financing angle?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. No trouble about that."</p>

  <p>She was at the breakfast-table with him (the only meal of the day
  guaranteed to be without Malcolm) when this conversation had sprung up, and
  she had an idea that unless she had broached the subject he would not have
  told her, even yet. She said at length, calmly: "I suppose you're sure what
  you're doing is the right thing, Paul."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not sure, this time. It's a new venture&mdash;an experiment.
  That's why I've kept you out of it... But if it's a success you can count on
  me&mdash;one of these days I'll make you into a movie star." He laughed and
  added: "Besides, you'd hate to walk out of a play that still has a few
  hundred nights to run."</p>

  <p>"I would, I'll admit that. But it isn't going to be easy for me, away from
  you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll manage. A play like that can jog along."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking about the play... When do you go?"</p>

  <p>"Sail on August twenty-fifth."</p>

  <p>"You've even fixed that?"</p>

  <p>"Have to book far ahead, the boats are crowded."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but... well, when do you expect to come back?"</p>

  <p>"Before Christmas... Carey, you're not really upset, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Darling, if you're doing what you feel you have to do, then everything's
  fine so far as I'm concerned. That's the way I discipline myself&mdash;if I
  didn't, you'd never put up with me. It's a bit of a miracle, really, the way
  we manage to put up with each other. But I'll miss you, Paul. That's
  something I CAN'T help."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She didn't miss him nearly as much as she had expected;
indeed, she was
  rather startled to find how much smoother in many ways life was without him.
  Provided he was doing what he wanted in that infallible world of his, she
  could face the few months of his absence with something more than equanimity.
  She missed him most at the rehearsals before the beginning of the new theatre
  season, for she knew there were things he would not have tolerated, that the
  play could have benefited from the kind of sprucing-up he would have given
  it; on the other hand, it was booked solid till January and the audience at
  the reopening laughed as loudly and as often as ever, not noticing (she was
  sure) the lack of that little extra quality that Paul could always squeeze
  out of a performance. Perhaps the squeeze did not matter so much, in a
  comedy. She was torn between a schooled integrity that insisted it did
  matter, and a feeling of relaxation in being able to do a competent job night
  after night without having to worry about what Paul had said to offend one of
  the carpenters, or the house-manager, or somebody from a newspaper.</p>

  <p>He wrote to her, fairly frequently but irregularly, from Berlin, giving
  her little information about the Everyman project, but conveying an
  impression that all was going well with it. He hardly ever mentioned Malcolm,
  and her own gossip about New York and the play never drew his answering
  comment. She was not surprised at any of this. Again, so long as he was all
  right, doing the work that satisfied him, she was content. She went to a few
  parties and enjoyed herself, discovering reluctantly how pleasant it was not
  to watch for danger across a crowded room, for Paul's feuds with so many
  people had always made acceptance of a party invitation something of a risk.
  More often, though, she spent pleasant hours by herself&mdash;reading,
  shopping, attending matines of other plays on her own free afternoons. Life
  went easily&mdash;at the theatre, at her apartment, and in a curious way
  within her inmost self.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of that October came the big break on Wall Street. Like
  most people she and Paul were 'in the market'; not to do what everyone else
  was doing would have seemed perilously close to that act of selling America
  short, which was, of course, a sin as well as an error. So, as they had
  accumulated more cash than they could spend, they had acquired the services
  of Andrew Reeves to manage the surplus&mdash;an elderly, highly respectable,
  and even conservative stockbroker who recommended only the blue chips and was
  cautious about too much buying on margin. All had gone well, and there had
  come a time when Carey could reckon, without undue excitement, that they were
  probably worth a quarter of a million dollars between them. Carey, in fact,
  was the one who dealt with all financial matters; she and Paul had separate
  accounts, but Paul had told Reeves that Carey was the one to say yes or no to
  any specific proposition. For Paul was fundamentally bored with money except
  when he needed it, so that the less he needed it the more bored he became. He
  would sign cheques and documents without looking at them if Carey had
  approved them first, and she doubted that he knew the names of the stocks
  that had given him quite large paper profits.</p>

  <p>Carey did not follow the affairs of Wall Street with any day-to-day
  preoccupation, but she could not miss the headlines on October 23rd, when
  market leaders plunged as many as fifty points. Alarm was in the air by then;
  it was already affecting theatre audiences. At her apartment after the
  performance she found a wire from Reeves asking for additional margin on
  certain stocks she held. The amount was not more than she could afford, but
  the drop in prices was so different from anything she or Reeves had
  considered possible that she wondered if she should sell out the stuff on
  which she and Paul still had a profit. It was a nuisance his having left
  without giving her legal power to act for him, but perhaps she could contact
  him by cable. The next morning she visited Reeves in his office on a day long
  to be remembered. Alarm had now mounted to panic, and she was aware of
  something in the atmosphere that touched her far beyond any question of
  personal loss&mdash;something she had not felt since those homeward journeys
  from the Abbey Theatre when there was shooting in the Dublin streets. She
  fought her way through yelling crowds into the broker's sanctum and at last
  managed to get a word with him. She was dismayed by his appearance and by his
  wan smile as he struggled to close the door of an inner office so that their
  voices could be heard, but what shocked her most was the way his telephone
  kept ringing and he made no move to answer it. This, from a man so
  punctilious, seemed to her an utmost symbol of disintegration. She liked him,
  they had had many lunches together at downtown restaurants where he was
  obviously pleased to be seen with her, and he had attended all her first
  nights and had been half-affectionately proprietary when he paid his respects
  in her dressing-room afterwards. There had always been in his attitude a
  sense of kindly guardianship; his eyes upon her told others that here was a
  beautiful young actress who naturally knew nothing about business, so she had
  put her financial affairs in the hands of safe old Uncle Andy and could
  henceforth sleep at nights without worrying her pretty head about them. It
  was a fairy-tale relationship, harmless enough, and Carey had not discouraged
  it. And now Uncle Andy was running his fingers through his whitening hair and
  refusing to answer telephone calls&mdash;perhaps from other pretty heads. "I
  can't figure what's happened, Carey. Of course it's absurd&mdash;U.S. Steel
  under 200&mdash;that shows you how absurd it is... Too bad you didn't take
  Paul's advice."</p>

  <p>"Paul's?... He never... why, what about Paul?"</p>

  <p>He was too bewildered to notice her bewilderment. He went on, still with
  the same wan smile: "One of the few I know who got out right at the top. Good
  for him."</p>

  <p>Amidst the bedlam of that morning she finally elicited that Paul had
  actually visited the broker's office in late August, had shown a lively
  interest in his holdings and what they were worth, and had shocked Reeves
  immeasurably by giving an explicit order to sell everything. It was obeyed,
  of course, and a few days later he had collected a cashier's cheque, again in
  person. What he did with it, if and how he reinvested the whole or any part,
  Reeves couldn't say. He had naturally assumed that Carey had known all about
  it. "I was surprised," he said, "that you'd let him act like that, though God
  knows he was smarter than either of us."</p>

  <p>Carey made the obvious guess as to what had happened to the money, but she
  did not mention it to Reeves. What troubled her most was not what Paul had
  done, but the way he had done it; it was the first time he had failed to
  consult her on the business angle of any enterprise. She wrote to him, as
  soon as she got back to the apartment&mdash;a short, straightforward letter,
  saying she had learned he had sold out, which in view of what had happened
  since was fortunate, but why had he kept it so secret? And had he put money
  into the Everyman project? If so, she hoped he had a reliable lawyer or
  business manager in Germany to look after his interests. After she had mailed
  the letter, Reeves telephoned. He told her things had steadied a little
  during the afternoon, Morgan's were supporting the market. Late that evening
  he telephoned again. He would be working all night, he said, to help his
  clerks bring some kind of order out of chaos. She hardly recognized his
  voice; it sounded not only strange, but the voice of a stranger. He added
  that after studying her account he was afraid the extra coverage she had
  agreed to send would not now be nearly enough. He was terribly sorry&mdash;
  it was for her to decide whether to put up more cash and hang on, or sell out
  and take the rather heavy loss. He was sorry it had come to that, of course
  she wasn't the only one, there were thousands in the same position or worse
  &mdash;some had been wiped out completely. And he was sorry he couldn't
  advise her what to do&mdash;after all, his advice hadn't been so good lately,
  she would admit. True, if one believed in America at all, the market was
  bristling with bargains&mdash;U.S. Steel at 200, for instance&mdash; on the
  other hand some people, probably bear operators, believed prices could go
  lower. So that was how it was, he simply couldn't advise her at all. He kept
  repeating that he was sorry till at last she realized whom he was reminding
  her of&mdash;an English butler they had had once who hid brandy in vinegar
  bottles and always apologized profusely when found out. She smiled then,
  knowing how utterly unlike a drunken butler Reeves could ever be, unless he
  and the whole world were to go as crazy as the market. It was cheering,
  anyhow, to find something to smile at. She said lightly: "Sell the stuff,
  Andy, and let's get it off our minds. I was all for taking medicine at one
  gulp when I was a kid. And I never worried about money when I had none
  &mdash;why should I now? Besides, there'll be some left, won't there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," he answered eagerly. "You aren't nearly as badly off as
  others."</p>

  <p>Less was left than she had expected, though there would have been nothing
  at all had she delayed action; she had that much consolation. She did not
  definitely worry, but it was discouraging to find that taking one's medicine
  in one gulp could not close the issue, for all around her as the days passed
  and the market fell further, reverberations affected her life in countless
  ways&mdash;through the changed fortunes of her friends, the atmosphere in
  shops and restaurants, and by a sharp down-turn in theatre prosperity. There
  was talk of cutting admission prices and salaries, and though nobody had yet
  suggested the play should be taken off, already it looked as if it would not
  last far into the new year. People said how fortunate that it was a comedy,
  since in bad times everybody wants to laugh. Carey heard this truism so often
  that she began to feel like medicine herself, and she wondered if it made her
  act better or worse; Paul could doubtless have informed her.</p>

  <p>One of his most irritating habits was that, in letter-writing as in
  personal argument, he was capable of blandly ignoring what had been said or
  asked by the other party. He did this in a way that would have been almost
  more forgivable had it been deliberate, but Carey knew that it represented
  the absence from his mind of any real concern for anything outside the circle
  of his own dominating interest at the time. Thus, in reply to her letter, he
  made no comment about the sale of his stocks, and neither confirmed nor
  denied that he had put money into the Everyman project. And when, in a second
  letter, she told him frankly she had lost heavily herself, and that all
  phases of New York life were hard hit, including Broadway&mdash;to all this
  he replied by a casual suggestion that maybe she could sell Mapledurham
  &mdash;he had always thought it was too expensive for what they got out of
  it. The rest of his letter was about the beauty of some lakes near Berlin
  where he was apparently working on the picture. And in a postscript he added:
  "Sounds like a bad theatre season over there. I hope mother isn't worried.
  Try to cheer her up."</p>

  <p>This reference to his mother further exasperated Carey, because, of all
  the people she knew, Paul's mother had least to worry about. The first thing
  he had done when success came was to fulfil an ambition to bring the old lady
  from Milwaukee to New York and set her up in an apartment of her own; then,
  with the profits of his first long run, he had bought her a comfortable
  annuity. All of which had been very dutiful and sensible, but it did, Carey
  felt, put Mrs. Saffron in a position where she needed less cheering up than a
  great many younger people. She was a woman of strong character and
  personality, rather terrifying in some ways ('fabulous' was the adjective she
  tried to live up to), and Paul's devotion to her was probably the most
  consistent emotion in his life. As such, Carey had been careful to respect
  it, but she was constantly amused by the aspect of angelic boyhood he assumed
  whenever he was with his mother. Play-acting himself down to the level of a
  teen-ager, he was often quite ridiculous; yet there must have been something
  in it, for no matter how dark or tempestuous his mood, he could always appear
  frolicsome with her.</p>

  <p>Carey made a special visit in response to the postscript. Paul had been in
  the long-established habit of paying his mother a short call every day,
  except on Sundays, when she came over to dinner; since he had been away Carey
  had kept up the Sunday dinners and made one or two return calls during the
  week. This could have looked like kindness to a lonely soul, except that Mrs.
  Saffron was neither lonely nor the kind of person who is called a soul. She
  enjoyed her independence, she could afford a daily maid, and she had a
  visiting clientele of elderly admirers who accepted her domination and
  constantly lost small sums to her at pinochle; moreover her health was good,
  and most mornings she pottered briskly about the Fifth Avenue shops with an
  eagle eye for a bargain. Carey always felt during her visits that she was
  being treated to a special demonstration of how close were mother and son,
  for invariably Mrs. Saffron could produce a letter from Paul which she did
  not show or read in its entirety, but quoted a few sentences from here and
  there. Apart from the fact that these letters were longer and more regular
  than the ones he sent to her, Carey thought them unremarkable; Paul was not a
  good letter-writer. This time, however, Mrs. Saffron's voice was charged with
  extra emphasis as she made the usual opening announcement: "I've just heard
  from Paul, my dear..." She went on, as if she couldn't wait for even the most
  perfunctory response: "He says you've been losing money in the stock
  market."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, a little." So Paul, despite his anxiety that she should not
  worry, had given her the news.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you weren't as smart as he was."</p>

  <p>Of course that explained it. Her own loss made a neat dramatic contrast to
  the good news he had been able to give his mother about himself.</p>

  <p>She said: "Yes, I am too."</p>

  <p>"Of course, he talked to me about it beforehand, and I said to him, 'Son,'
  I said, 'it's your money, you made it, you do what you want with it.' So I
  guess that's what made him sell at the right time."</p>

  <p>Carey had no comment.</p>

  <p>"It's rather funny what he said about it in his letter." Mrs. Saffron put
  on her spectacles, searched for the page, and ran her finger down with a
  great show of omitting other things. "He says... this is what Paul says, my
  dear... he says, 'I've just seen some American papers and oh boy, Wall Street
  certainly did take a beating. I can just imagine how old Reeves must feel. I
  didn't dare tell him I was going to bring the cash to Germany to make a
  picture&mdash;he'd have raised such a shindig&mdash;but golly, even if the
  picture's a flop I won't be worse off than if I'd left things as they
  were...'"</p>

  <p>How true that was, Carey reflected, and how characteristic in a letter to
  his mother were such expressions as 'Oh boy', 'shindig', and 'golly'&mdash; a
  kind of slang he would never have dreamed of using elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of November he wrote that the picture was going well but
  more slowly than he had expected, so that he couldn't return till some time
  in the New Year, perhaps March or April if he could manage it. For the first
  time, in that letter, he showed interest in her affairs&mdash;he hoped the
  play was still making money and that she hadn't lost 'too much' in the market
  crash. If she had, and had any use for a thousand dollars or so, there was
  that much cash in a safe-deposit box of his (he gave the number and location)
  which he had forgotten to empty when he left&mdash;she was welcome to it. As
  for the picture, it was going to be wonderful. It was also the first time he
  had sounded such an optimistic note about the work he was doing.</p>

  <p>News of the delay in his return did not prevent this letter from cheering
  Carey considerably. She was touched by the evidence of his concern for her,
  even though the form it took had a typical streak of impracticality. She
  replied: "Darling, it was sweet of you to tell me about the safe-deposit box,
  but I really don't need the money and in any case the bank wouldn't let me
  touch it if it's in your name&mdash;didn't you know that?... The play's still
  running and audiences seem to be picking up a little, and I've been
  approached in a vague way about several other plays next year, so I don't
  think I shall be out of work. Even if I were, I could enjoy a holiday, and
  I'm not PENNILESS, you know. So please don't worry about me, and take all the
  time you need for what you want to do... I see your mother regularly and she
  tells me you've lost ten pounds and are very proud of it&mdash;I know what
  this is a sign of&mdash;the creative yeast beginning to ferment, didn't you
  once call it that? Don't work too hard, though, and give me more news of the
  picture&mdash;I'm so happy about it..."</p>

  <p>She spent a busy but enjoyable Christmas, and on New Year's Eve she
  wondered sentimentally but not anxiously what Paul was doing, and figured out
  that it was already New Year's Day in Europe. She sent him a cable.</p>

  <p>The play finally petered out in the third week of January, and though she
  was not definitely signed for a successor, there was another comedy by the
  same author shaping up and with an obvious part for her. She took a trip to
  Florida with theatre friends and was back in New York by the beginning of
  March, the earliest month that Paul had said he might possibly return. Recent
  letters, however, had not confirmed this, or indeed mentioned the matter
  again. His last letter had been from Riesbach, near Interlaken, Switzerland,
  where he had taken part of the company on location, so he said. He did not
  explain further, and Carey wondered how Swiss scenery could become necessary
  in a film of Everyman; but she was not especially surprised.</p>

  <p>Then one Sunday as she was walking through the lobby of the Plaza for
  lunch she ran into Malcolm Beringer. She almost literally ran into him, and
  was sure from his instant look that he would have avoided her if he could.
  Even his suavity deserted him a little as she made him stop. "Malcolm! I
  didn't know you were back from Europe even&mdash;Paul never tells me things.
  Can't you sit down for a moment and give me all the news?"</p>

  <p>She practically forced him to a chair and hoped he did not see her hand
  trembling as she offered him a cigarette. She had a sudden premonition of
  things not quite right. "So you left Paul there? How is he? Tell me about the
  picture... He writes that it's going ahead well."</p>

  <p>"I believe it is," Malcolm agreed, but without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"You BELIEVE it is? Don't you know?"</p>

  <p>He said: "I left Berlin in November. I can't say what's been happening
  since."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you and Paul were working together?"</p>

  <p>"We were... till then." He continued, with a faint smile: "It's a long
  story&mdash;much too complicated to explain."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it's complicated. Anything to do with Paul usually is. What did
  you do&mdash;quarrel?"</p>

  <p>Then his faint smile vanished altogether. "We didn't see eye to eye about
  certain things."</p>

  <p>"Of course you didn't. I was always surprised how well you got on at
  Mapledurham. Paul's not what you might call one of nature's
  collaborators."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't exactly that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>He fidgeted to the edge of the chair, scrutinizing the passing crowd as if
  hoping for rescue by someone. "You'll excuse me, Carey, I ought to be looking
  for a man who's coming to lunch with me."</p>

  <p>"So ought I, but both of them can wait. You've just time to tell me very
  quickly what happened."</p>

  <p>"Why, nothing happened&mdash;particularly." He stubbed out his cigarette
  and let his long slender fingers tap some message of uncertainty on the
  table-top.</p>

  <p>"Then what is it that's too complicated to explain?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask Paul?"</p>

  <p>"How can I ask him about nothing particular&mdash;and that's what you say
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"It's all too personal, Carey, and if Paul doesn't mention it perhaps he
  thinks it's of no importance. And perhaps it isn't."</p>

  <p>"You must know how that kind of answer scares me."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I don't think there's anything to get scared about."</p>

  <p>"Mysteries always scare me. You've made me feel I want to leave for
  Germany tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Switzerland now, I understand."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right. Some place near Interlaken."</p>

  <p>"You know that? He told you where he was?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Why shouldn't he?"</p>

  <p>A very elegant young man approached the table, bowed slightly, and had to
  be introduced. Malcolm did not ask him to join them. Carey said lightly:
  "Pity there isn't time for a longer chat. Maybe we could have dinner together
  soon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He murmured something about having to leave for Washington. She didn't
  believe a word of it and she knew he knew she didn't. She added, shaking
  hands: "Well, I might take a trip to Interlaken one of these days&mdash;
  would you recommend that?"</p>

  <p>"They say it's a very beautiful place."</p>

  <p>Oh God, she thought&mdash;couldn't you have thought of a better exit line,
  and you supposed to be a writer?... And then she remembered something that
  Paul had once said, that all the time-worn clichs that sound too absurd
  nowadays for any modern play are still used in life by people who are either
  too unsophisticated or too disconcerted to think of anything more original.
  And of these Malcolm could clearly belong only to the second class.</p>

  <p>She acted a part throughout lunch, appearing very carefree; it was easier
  to overdo it than merely to quell a mounting nervousness. Later that day she
  wrote to Paul, saying that she had met Malcolm accidentally and that he had
  given her the news. She did not say what news, and hoped that the equivocal
  phrase might evoke some revealing answer. But it failed to do so; the letters
  Paul continued to write, both to her and his mother, were no different and
  contained no mention of Malcolm at all. It was maddening, the way he could
  ignore things. After a month of it, and with the new play still not
  definitely lined up, she came to an abrupt decision. She WOULD go to
  Interlaken. To Mrs. Saffron she made the excuse of another trip to Florida;
  what the old lady would think when no letters from Florida arrived she
  neither knew, nor in the mood she had reached, particularly cared. She caught
  the Olympic and reached Paris on an April day whose flavour gave her a pang.
  She and Paul had spent much time in that city, and had loved it, but now she
  merely hastened across from one station to another. Travelling all night, she
  arrived in Interlaken the next day about noon. She had never visited
  Switzerland before, and the loveliness as she stepped out of the train was
  overpowering. A cab-driver said that Riesbach was several miles away, a
  tourists' resort with a hotel, approachable only by steamer across the Lake
  of Brienz. It sounded so remote she didn't think she would want to stay there
  if Paul had gone back to Germany, which was a possibility; so she booked a
  room at an hotel near the station and left her luggage. Then she took a cab
  through the town to the lakeside and boarded the tiny paddle-steamers. She
  was already more, or perhaps less, than entranced; she felt that the beauty
  surrounding her hit below the emotional belt. And how industriously the Swiss
  had exploited everything, never vulgarizing though sometimes prettifying,
  building their parks and esplanades into perfect line with the white cone of
  the Jungfrau, running funiculars here and there to catch a special view,
  electrifying their trains into docile cleanliness; it was unbelievable that
  people should have come to such cosy terms with grandeur. The whole place,
  with its keen bright air and gay decorum, had an air of holiday that made
  Florida, steeped in stock-market and real-estate gloom, seem like a
  melancholy shambles by comparison.</p>

  <p>The boat chugged across the lake, putting in at various resorts before
  arriving at Riesbach. Only a few passengers alighted there. The hotel was
  perched high above the water; a funicular climbed to it from the dockside.
  Every step in this long verifying journey from New York seemed to have
  increased her excitement in geometric progression; the ocean crossing,
  lasting a week, had been tense but endurable; the overnight train from Paris
  had left her restless; the boat trip across the lake had been an excruciating
  dream; and now these few minutes in the funicular seemed the culminating race
  of her heart to some kind of extinction. But at the very end, at the hotel
  desk as she asked if a Mr. Paul Saffron were staying there, she was becalmed.
  Yes, they said, but he was out at the moment&mdash;he was probably taking a
  walk in the woods. Doubtless he would be back soon. Would she care to wait?
  She agreed, and sat down in the lobby for a while. Then she went to the
  terrace and saw the trail leading into the woods with romantic
  deliberateness, the little signpost giving time in hours as well as distance
  in kilometres&mdash;all so neat and satisfactory, so safe in an unsafe world.
  She began to walk along the trail, not intending to go far, in case Paul
  might return by some other route. The woods were cool and fresh-scented,
  sloping to the lake at an angle that gave sudden glimpses of blue amidst the
  green. Wild flowers, buttercups, and crocuses speckled the undergrowth, and
  at pleasing intervals a waterfall tumbled over rocks that seemed too casual
  not to have been arranged.</p>

  <p>After ten minutes or so she turned a corner and saw two people some
  hundred yards ahead, and one of them, she thought from the slow walk, could
  possibly be Paul. The other was a girl. But what surprised her was that he
  was carrying a huge clump of wild flowers and that every few yards both he
  and the girl stopped to gather more. This was so totally unlike Paul, who
  cared for flowers only enough to buy them at high prices, that she almost
  doubted her own recognition till she came closer and could see the familiar
  head balanced heavily on the familiar shoulders. The rest was less familiar,
  for he was wearing shorts, woollen stockings, and boots spectacularly
  different from anything in his American wardrobe. Then she noticed that the
  girl had straw-coloured hair of the kind usually provided by wig-makers for
  use in Wagnerian opera.</p>

  <p>Carey caught herself insisting that this encounter was a joke which they
  must both share with the girl, whoever she was. She was afraid they would
  hear her footsteps and turn, and for some reason she wanted to choose her own
  time; she stopped therefore, partly to gain breath and partly in the sheer
  fascinatedness of being able to count now in seconds, after the minutes,
  hours, days, and weeks of waiting. She felt curiously elated. And the flowers
  and the girl's hair and the blue seen through the green and the snow-capped
  mountains dazzling in the distance&mdash;it WAS all rather like an opera, or
  like that recurrent crisis in an opera when something silly but quite tuneful
  is about to happen. "PAUL!" she cried out abruptly. She had not known till
  then how silent everything was, except for the murmur of the waterfalls.
  Strange, she thought, that she had not heard them talking together. It was so
  odd of Paul to be walking, and even odder for him not to be talking.</p>

  <p>He turned, stared, muttered something either to the girl or to himself,
  then began back along the trail, towards her, the girl following him. He was
  somewhat short-sighted and could not, she knew, recognize her at such a
  distance, but surely he must have known her voice. But then she realized that
  her voice had not sounded like her own voice at all.</p>

  <p>"Hello," she said conversationally, but projecting a little, as she would
  have done on the stage.</p>

  <p>Then came, in a rush, the inevitable exclamations and counter-
  exclamations. "CAREY! For heaven's sake! YOU? You didn't tell me you were
  coming! Why on earth didn't you write? Carey, I can't BELIEVE it's
  you..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Paul, I ought to have let you know, but I made up my mind so suddenly
  and I thought if you'd gone back to Germany I didn't want to interfere with
  your plans&mdash;I mean, if you hadn't been here it would have been all
  right&mdash;it's such a glorious place and I needed a vacation&mdash;it was
  either here or Florida, and there's no comparison, is there? And besides, YOU
  don't tell ME everything, why should I tell you?&mdash;that's fair, isn't
  it?... My goodness, you're looking well!"</p>

  <p>It was true. His usually pale face was bronzed, and he had lost nearer
  twenty than ten pounds, she would have judged. She had never seen him in such
  condition and it was doubtless absurd of her to reflect that, in a certain
  sense, it didn't suit him.</p>

  <p>Then the girl came up, and Carey gasped, for she was a blond beauty,
  Wagnerian perhaps, but slim and exquisite, the flaxen hair framing the face
  like an ivory miniature.</p>

  <p>Paul said: "This is Miss Wanda Hessely&mdash;she plays the lead in the
  picture." He turned to the girl and said, in very bad German: "This is Carey
  Arundel."</p>

  <p>Carey smiled and the girl smiled back.</p>

  <p>Paul said: "She doesn't speak English and I still can't manage much
  German, but I can tell you she's a fine actress."</p>

  <p>"That's wonderful. I hope I'm not interrupting your morning."</p>

  <p>Carey hadn't intended that to be sarcastic, it was simply what she
  sincerely felt, but as soon as she said it she wished it had sounded
  differently. Already she was half-regretting the whole trip; to meet Paul was
  one thing, but to sneak up on two people gathering wild flowers in a wood was
  somehow too nave. Besides, she knew Paul had his own ways of rehearsing
  privately with actors&mdash;perhaps there was a flower scene in the picture
  and they had been taking themselves off to some quiet spot where Paul would
  have her go through a part. But to think that was perhaps also nave. Already
  she knew that any twinge of jealousy she felt had not come from seeing the
  girl, but from hearing Paul call her a fine actress.</p>

  <p>Paul said: "Oh no, we were just out for a stroll. Nowhere special. Wanda
  loves flowers. Let's go back to the hotel and have a drink... She talks
  French, if you can remember enough."</p>

  <p>They walked back together, Paul between them. The girl was not only
  lovely, she was charming and spoke enchantingly, with a quality of voice that
  Carey knew must set her high in Paul's regard; and though Carey had not used
  her French for years, it began to ripple fast between them by the time they
  reached the hotel. Paul, indeed, was left rather out of things; he kept
  glancing first to one side and then to the other, as if uncertain whether
  what was happening was altogether what he wanted. He was a bad linguist, and
  could not follow the conversation. "So you DO remember your French," he
  commented ruefully, as they chose a table on the terrace.</p>

  <p>"Of course. And since she doesn't know English I'll tell you this much in
  front of her&mdash;she's just about the loveliest thing I've ever seen. Is
  she well known?"</p>

  <p>"She will be. She's my discovery&mdash;she used to work in a department
  store. A natural actress. You should see some of the rushes."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to. May I?"</p>

  <p>"They're in Berlin."</p>

  <p>"But aren't you making part of the picture here?"</p>

  <p>"We were shooting a few mountain scenes, but that's all done now. We're
  just killing time for a while."</p>

  <p>"A nice place to do it. Everybody must be very happy."</p>

  <p>"No, the others have gone back to Germany till there's more money. Mine
  turned out to be not nearly enough. You've no idea how costs run up. I sold
  out half my interest. I had to&mdash;we couldn't have gone on without."</p>

  <p>"So you spent all your money and now you only own half the picture?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not even that, by the time we're through. But if I'd kept it in
  stocks, what then?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. You were so right."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know I was right. I just knew I wanted the money... And it's a
  good picture, Carey, really it is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Paul, I'm very happy about that."</p>

  <p>"Are you? You LOOK happy."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I be? I've owed myself a real vacation for years. Last
  summer at Mapledurham wasn't much of one."</p>

  <p>"I know. Because you didn't like Malcolm. Maybe you were right about him
  just as I was about the stocks."</p>

  <p>"You mean accidentally right?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you couldn't have KNOWN."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't have known what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, let's not hold a post-mortem."</p>

  <p>"He told me he hadn't seen eye to eye with you&mdash;that was the phrase.
  I suppose you had a big row."</p>

  <p>"An IMPOSSIBLE row, Carey."</p>

  <p>"You're pretty hard to collaborate with."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it hadn't anything to do with that."</p>

  <p>"So he said, too."</p>

  <p>The waiter came and Paul, without consultation, ordered three double Amer
  Picons, which Carey thought rather massive for that time of the day, but she
  was too preoccupied to ask for anything else.</p>

  <p>"What was the row about, then?"</p>

  <p>"Wanda, mainly. He didn't like her."</p>

  <p>"You mean, in the part?"</p>

  <p>"That as well."</p>

  <p>"As well as what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was all rather personal."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he was jealous."</p>

  <p>"Not in the way you'd expect."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Darling, how do you know what I'd expect?"</p>

  <p>"That's enough in English. Say something to her in French."</p>

  <p>She spoke across him to the girl; she said: "My husband tells me you're
  very wonderful in the picture."</p>

  <p>She watched the girl's response, and saw shock (if there were any) mingle
  with pleasure at the compliment into a cool shyness, half disconcerted, half
  serene. The more Carey studied her the more she found her utterly delightful.
  They talked on till the drinks came, less and less importantly; by that time
  Paul looked forlorn again and was itching for a chance to interrupt.</p>

  <p>"You two seem to be hitting it off together," he said, at the first
  opportunity. "Hitting it off" was his favourite phrase for success in any and
  all human contacts.</p>

  <p>"Paul, I think she's adorable."</p>

  <p>"How do you like the Amer Picon?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not used to drinks at all, so early, but it's no more unusual than my
  being here, is it? I left my luggage in Interlaken, by the way."</p>

  <p>"The hotel people can send over for it."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact I booked a room there at the Splendide&mdash;I wasn't
  certain you'd be here, and Interlaken looked very nice."</p>

  <p>"Sure, but you can cancel it now. Let me go to the desk and fix
  things."</p>

  <p>She talked with Wanda till he came back a few moments later. "They've put
  you in the room across from me for tonight," he said, "but tomorrow we can
  switch to the royal suite&mdash;it's probably that&mdash;two bedrooms with a
  real bathroom in between&mdash;quite sensational for these parts. And I asked
  them to telephone the Splendide to cancel your room and send over the stuff.
  It won't arrive till tomorrow, but I don't suppose that matters."</p>

  <p>She could not help thinking how strange it was for him to have made all
  these businesslike arrangements. Usually when they travelled it was she who
  did everything at hotel desks, booking and inspecting rooms, checking
  luggage, and so on. It was certainly strange of him to be rushing to handle
  such details himself, and courtesy seemed laughable as a possible
  explanation. Perhaps, though, it was no stranger than the walking in the
  woods, and the flowers, and the shorts. As for the arrangements themselves,
  they were quite normal. For years he had been apt to sit up half the night
  reading and smoking cigars, and for this reason separate rooms had become a
  habit, and in hotels whenever possible they had always tried to fix up a
  two-bedroomed suite.</p>

  <p>Then, in the swiftly gathering dusk, she noticed a small group of people
  at the end of the terrace staring in a certain direction, some with
  binoculars. Paul explained that it was the Alpine glow transfiguring the snow
  peaks, evidently a much-esteemed local spectacle. They moved over to join the
  group. It appeared often in clear weather, Paul went on, with something of a
  chamber-of-commerce pridefulness, but this evening's show was the most
  colourful he had yet seen. "That INCREDIBLE saffron..." he remarked, adding
  quickly: "And no joke intended."</p>

  <p>"That makes it a better one," she laughed, feeling the drink in her head
  and legs simultaneously. "Because you ARE that incredible Saffron, and I only
  wish I could translate it into French for Wanda... Anyhow, it's pretty
  &mdash;the colour, I mean. Just like slabs of pink blancmange... I think I'll
  find where my room is now and get myself freshened up."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I'll take you."</p>

  <p>They entered the hotel, leaving Wanda on the terrace, and climbed the
  staircase to the second floor. Everywhere looked rather empty, and Paul
  explained that it was in between seasons, the snow being now too soft for
  skiing and the yearly influx of vacationers having not yet begun. He talked
  with a satisfied air of proprietorship, as if the hotel as well as the girl
  had been his own discovery. "It's just the spot to rest and relax," he said,
  amazingly when she recollected all the other country places which with her he
  had found just the spots to get bored in. He unlocked the doors of both their
  rooms, then strode across hers to fling open the windows. "No screens, of
  course, they never have them out here, but there aren't insects either."
  Screens were his fetish; it was the one feature she had to look for first
  when she was booking at an American hotel, and how often they had passed up a
  good one for lack of them. "I think you'll like it here," he went on. Both
  rooms were bare-boarded, cheerful, spotless, but austere by American
  standards; Paul's was smaller than hers, with a single bed and not much of a
  view. He said he had taken it because it was cheap, which she could well
  believe. She was wondering how much tact she need employ to offer him a loan
  (probably none at all if he needed the money) when he said with a grin:
  "Carey, what really made you come here?"</p>

  <p>"An idea I got suddenly. I just wanted to see you. I wanted to make sure
  you were all right. Malcolm scared me."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. That's what scared me. I got so that I had to find out for
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you."</p>

  <p>"That's nice. I knew you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean it, Carey. I DON'T blame you."</p>

  <p>"And I don't blame you either."</p>

  <p>He did not reply, but went on grinning, and after a pause she continued:
  "Anyhow, you look so well and happy... and why shouldn't you be, with a good
  picture nearly finished?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it IS good. I wasn't certain at first, but I know now I can do a
  great job for the screen just as for the stage."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you haven't changed, Paul."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I have? I've lost a lot of weight."</p>

  <p>"I meant that if I ever found you modest I really WOULD think something
  had happened."</p>

  <p>He laughed, "You know me pretty well, don't you?"</p>

  <p>She laughed with him. "Does Wanda think you're going to make her a great
  actress?"</p>

  <p>He became suddenly serious. "She nearly is already. You'd agree if you saw
  the rushes."</p>

  <p>"But I can't, can I? She's a better actress than me, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"When you say so, as solemnly as that, I know how true it must be."</p>

  <p>"It's also true that I've missed you, Carey."</p>

  <p>"You HAVE? Really? I wouldn't put it past you, as they say in Dublin."</p>

  <p>"There's one thing Wanda hasn't got."</p>

  <p>"That makes her human, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"But it's something I miss&mdash;though perhaps it's only due to the
  language barrier... A sense of humour, Carey&mdash;the kind you have."</p>

  <p>"And the kind I need, too, darling. When do we get dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Six. We'll drink champagne."</p>

  <p>"Provided you let me buy it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, and since we're on that subject, do you think you could lend me a
  little cash? I'm a bit short till we get some more out of Germany."</p>

  <p>She began to open her purse. "Anything you want, Paul&mdash;within limits.
  We're neither of us as well-heeled as we used to be. Matter of fact, this
  room suits me perfectly&mdash;why bother making any change tomorrow? We don't
  need a suite when the hotel's so empty&mdash;it's no hardship to walk down
  the corridor to a bathroom."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The dinner was good, and in a somewhat under-populated
dining-room the
  explosion of champagne corks seemed a ceremony to announce the season yet
  unborn. The hotel manager smiled his approval and sent them cognac on the
  house. Carey talked a good deal to Wanda, and Paul offered his constant
  interruptions, irrelevantly but not without a sort of bizarre harmony. In the
  rays of the table lamp Wanda was an Alpine glow herself, something to be
  stared at like a natural phenomenon. Her beauty was of a kind, Carey thought,
  that would make anything she did forgivable, while the beauty itself remained
  unforgivable&mdash;because in an imperfect world nobody had a right to such
  flawlessness. Even the flaw Paul had mentioned was more likely to be his own
  than hers, for Carey guessed that Wanda did have a sense of humour; it was
  Paul who had failed to discover it because he hadn't nearly so much himself,
  as his stress on the language barrier showed; for it was wit, of which he had
  plenty, that required speech; humour could pass wordlessly from eye to eye,
  as Wanda's did to hers, even when their chatter in French was quite ordinary
  and serious. And they need not tell each other much about Paul, Carey
  thought, because they could LOOK at each other about him; and this they had
  been doing all the time so far, with Paul presiding between them with an air
  of performing a conjuring trick that nobody was interested in.</p>

  <p>It was during the later stages of dinner that Carey realized how
  impossible it would be to find out anything that could be called the absolute
  truth. She knew Paul well enough to know how rarely he could be attracted
  sexually; she knew, too, that there was nothing in the outward appearance of
  his attitude to make it certain that Wanda was, or had been, his mistress. He
  adored beautiful women, extravagantly and romantically, and a beautiful woman
  combined with a fine actress would surely drive him to every kind of
  distraction&mdash;with only one possible but not quite guaranteeable
  exception. It might well, for instance, expend itself in an ecstasy of
  gathering wild flowers, wearing shorts, and losing twenty pounds of
  superfluous weight. During the seven years Carey had lived with Paul she had
  witnessed the strangest manifestations of his enthusiasms for other women,
  yet she had never really believed him to be unfaithful, and had only very
  occasionally wondered about it. For she had the best of reasons for knowing
  how hazardous he found the relationship of man and woman, a problem worth
  solving once in a lifetime, if at all, and then to be given up not so much in
  despair as in thankful disregard.</p>

  <p>And yet, looking at Wanda, Carey could not be sure. From the girl's angle
  a liaison with Paul might easily seem desirable as a means of keeping him
  interested in her till he had given what he had to give&mdash;and if she were
  a good actress, let alone a great one, she would know how much that was.
  There was a composure about her that Carey could not interpret, but admired
  because she knew from stage experience how hard it was to simulate if it were
  not felt; so that in Wanda it must either be sincere or else a piece of
  acting equally to be envied. She wished she could see the rushes of the
  picture, not because she doubted Paul's word about their merit, but to reach
  in her own heart that point at which envy must spill over into hate or love;
  for she had never hated anyone yet, and wondered if she could.</p>

  <p>She decided then that she was not jealous, but mainly curious, with a
  curiosity disciplined by her own surmise as to what would happen if she were
  to ask Paul a plain question. Because, whatever his answer, she wouldn't know
  whether to believe it. She could imagine him, in pride that was a sort of
  self-defence, assuring her that of course he and Wanda had had an affair
  &mdash;what did she think he was made of? (Once or twice in the past he had
  hinted at conquests which later she had found to be mere boasting.) Or she
  could imagine him answering no, with much indignation, merely to spare what
  he would assume to be her feelings&mdash;such an assumption being often no
  more than a reflection of his own high opinion of himself. "I didn't want you
  to be hurt," he would say when he would be hurt himself if she ever told him
  she hadn't been.</p>

  <p>And if she were to put the same plain question to Wanda there would be an
  equal impasse; something transfiguring would happen again, a glow on top of a
  glow, the look that could come to the same bashful terms with guilt or
  innocence, as Carey had seen already in the girl's response to that
  deliberately testing phrase "my husband". And there was nothing more to be
  learned.</p>

  <p>Except one matter, which Carey held herself justified in probing at the
  first chance. It came when Paul left them at the table to buy a cigar. Carey
  said then, changing the subject abruptly: "I saw Malcolm Beringer in New York
  before I sailed. He gave me an impression that he and Paul had quarrelled
  while they were working on the picture."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Beringer a friend of yours, Mrs. Saffron?"</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't call him that. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>And then a long cool silence, until the girl continued: "You see, it has
  been hard for me to exchange ideas with Paul, because of the language, but
  Mr. Beringer spoke German well&mdash;so he acted as interpreter amongst all
  of us."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can understand that, but how did it affect the quarrel?"</p>

  <p>Wanda smiled. "He was able to say things about Paul that were not
  true."</p>

  <p>"I see. And when you found out they weren't true... ?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, then there was the trouble."</p>

  <p>Paul was already returning with the cigar. There was no time to explore
  further, nor perhaps any need either. Carey said, deliberately gay for Paul's
  benefit: "Paul's quick enough at most other things, I wonder why he's so slow
  at picking up languages?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why," Wanda answered, in the same key. "First, it is
  because he does not really listen when others are talking. And second, it is
  because he feels the whole world has no right not to know English."</p>

  <p>Paul sat down and lit his cigar, pleasantly aware that they were having
  some joke at his expense; he did not know enough French to enjoy it with
  them, but he was sure it must be harmless.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Carey stayed at Riesbach for a week, and in many ways it
was a very
  pleasant time. All the things she had long wished that Paul would care for,
  he now apparently did care for&mdash;hours of sheer laziness in deck chairs,
  rowing placidly on the lake, picnics in the woods, even walking, if it were
  not too athletic. Wanda was wise enough not to persuade him to do other
  things that she herself enjoyed; she used her power, if it existed, with a
  sparing scrupulousness. So when she felt in a mood to climb a mountain or
  play tennis or take part in the impromptu dances that often sprang up at the
  hotel after dinner, she made no attempt to drag Paul along; and of course
  there were always young men anxious to fill the gap. Paul seemed to have no
  jealousy when he saw her in the arms of some handsome ski-instructor; he and
  Carey would sit watching, Paul relishing the spectacle theatrically and
  passing frequent remarks on Wanda's beauty and accomplishments.</p>

  <p>Carey did not need to be told that Paul was happy. He gave every sign of
  it, and the loss of weight and healthier life had added a new kind of vigour
  &mdash;more physical, less nervous. In a sort of way Carey found him less
  like himself, which could also be called in some ways a change for the
  better. She noticed that he ate, drank, and smoked less, that he would choose
  fruit as a dessert instead of chocolate pudding, that he did not smoke his
  first cigar till after lunch. Little things. Once as the three of them were
  returning from an afternoon on the lake, wind-blown and sun-brown, they
  passed a large mirror in the hotel lobby, and Paul, in the middle, drew them
  both to a standstill with encircling arms. "Don't we look wonderful?" he
  exclaimed, and it was true that they did. But at the very moment of joining
  in a laughing assent, Carey caught Wanda's eye in the mirror and saw in it
  something so friendly, yet at the same time so inquisitive, that she felt
  Paul's question was being repeated rather than answered. Carey said: "Well,
  we ought to, with the kind of life we're leading. Sunshine and fresh air and
  no work."</p>

  <p>Paul said: "One of these days I shall make a picture about children, and
  when I do I shall remember Riesbach."</p>

  <p>He drew them away from the mirror, but the look in Wanda's eyes which
  Carey intercepted before they left it was less inquisitive now, had more of
  shared awareness, as if she were saying: We both know that cryptic kind of
  remark, don't we?... And Carey returned the look, as if to answer: Of course
  we do, it's his way of clinching something in his mind by a dramatic
  attitude, as he would have an actor do the thing on the stage... and just to
  prove it isn't as silly as it sounds, he probably WILL make a picture about
  children some day and it'll be so good that people will think what a lovely
  childhood he must have had himself to understand it so well, but the truth
  is, Wanda, his own real childhood wasn't lovely at all&mdash;he hated his
  father, he was miserable and lonely and insufferably precocious... this
  Riesbach interlude is a dream of his and we are the playmates he never had
  before&mdash;he's seeing us now, with his arms round both of us, symbolically
  as well as actually, in a mirror...</p>

  <p>One morning the Riesbach interlude came to a sudden end. She had cabled
  her address to Bill Michaelson, her New York agent, merely as routine, but on
  the breakfast-table there was a cabled reply saying that the new play was now
  finished, should he mail it over, or was she likely to be returning soon? Had
  this come alone she might have wondered whether to ignore it, at least for
  the time being; but for Paul also there was a message, summoning him to
  Berlin to complete the picture, new money having at last been raised. As they
  sat, the three of them, drinking coffee on the terrace in the mountain
  sunshine and exchanging these items of news, it seemed quite providential
  that so much had happened simultaneously, thus cancelling out blame, remorse,
  and responsibility. They packed that morning and took the lake steamer to
  Interlaken in the afternoon. The spell was over, and Paul was more normally
  nervous and excitable, fidgeting over trifles and almost absent-mindedly
  enquiring about the New York play. Carey told him what she knew, which wasn't
  much, except that it was another comedy guaranteed to be a winner like the
  last one. He said moodily: "It's about time you were bored with comedy,"
  which she knew was his oblique way of telling her that he was, or rather that
  he was so interested in something else that the idea of coming back to New
  York to direct the play wasn't touching even remotely the fringe of his mind.
  Towards dusk at Interlaken station they boarded two trains that left, again
  by coincidence, almost at the same moment and in opposite directions&mdash;
  Wanda and Paul to Germany via Lucerne, Carey by the express to Paris. Two
  days later she was on the Berengaria.</p>

  <p>As soon as she embarked at Cherbourg she felt tired and lack-lustre. It
  was as if the Riesbach interlude, now that it was over, had withdrawn its own
  illusion of well-being, leaving only the memory of an enchantment too slight
  to lean on. The goodbye to Paul, so far from upsetting her, had been in some
  sense a relief, and though he had said he planned to be back in America by
  September, she was surprised to find that the idea of his return did not fit
  into her mind as something terrific to look forward to&mdash;rather, in her
  present mood, as merely another and a further horizon of ordeal. For the new
  play was already the nearer one, and although she knew how difficult Paul was
  when he was directing, the thought of some other director made her feel very
  glum. But of course it could not be helped. Thank goodness Paul's all right;
  he's happy; let him get back to his work and I to mine; in this spirit she
  could face any future. On the boat she surrendered to something else that was
  harder to analyse&mdash;not quite depression, but a deep lassitude of the
  body that matched an inner indifference the like of which she could not
  remember in her life before; it centred on the new play, which of course she
  would study as soon as she reached New York, but she was actually glad she
  hadn't it with her during the trip&mdash;she lacked even a desire to read
  it.</p>

  <p>She spent the first four days at sea in her room, the weather being rough.
  On the fifth day, approaching the Grand Banks, the skies cleared and the
  rolling lessened, so that many of the passengers, like herself, appeared on
  deck for the first time. She did the regulation walk, then found a vacant
  chair, a rug, and a novel. Next to her in the long line was a grey-haired
  man, rather good-looking and apparently asleep. There was something about him
  that made her think she might have seen him before&mdash;not that she could
  know him personally, for she had a good memory for acquaintances, but perhaps
  his was one of the faces that sometimes emerge from the blur beyond the
  footlights, randomly and as a challenge when an audience is cold&mdash;see
  that man at the end of row three, centre aisle&mdash;he's not laughing, MAKE
  him laugh, make HIM laugh... occasionally in comedy one got as desperate as
  that, and it was significant that now, with the new play distantly on her
  mind, such desperations were easy to remember. She was staring at the man,
  still wondering and remembering, when she realized he had opened his eyes and
  was staring back at her.</p>

  <p>He smiled and said slowly: "Miss Arundel, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She was used to this kind of thing, and though it was sometimes a
  nuisance, she knew that if it ever ceased happening she would have much more
  to worry about; apart from which, in this instance, she had been staring
  first. So she returned his smile. "Yes, that's right."</p>

  <p>"I thought I recognized you." She was glad he didn't try to get up or
  perform any polite man&oelig;uvre, tucked in as he was under a very luxurious
  fur rug. "I'm one of your countless admirers, Miss Arundel. My name is Bond
  &mdash;Austen Bond."</p>

  <p>"My real name is Saffron. Mrs. Paul Saffron."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes." She couldn't be sure whether the name Saffron meant anything to
  him or whether he was merely being cool towards the revelation. "Are you
  coming back to New York to give us a new play?"</p>

  <p>It was the one thing she didn't want to talk about. "I expect so," she
  prevaricated, "sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"I hope sooner."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>"No, no, it's I who should thank you for giving me so much pleasure."</p>

  <p>To which by all usage she should have murmured vague appreciation and
  changed the subject, thus ending the seesaw before it began to be ridiculous;
  but instead she let what was uppermost in her mind dictate a reply&mdash; she
  said: "Don't forget the director also&mdash;and the author&mdash;they have a
  lot to do with a good play."</p>

  <p>"Of course. And I notice you put the director before the author."</p>

  <p>"That was accidental&mdash;or perhaps it's because my husband IS the
  director&mdash;WAS, that is, of my last play."</p>

  <p>The steward came with bowls of hot soup. The effort of dealing with them
  seemed to make the conversation more intimate, if also more scattered. They
  discussed foreign travel for a time (she told him she had been visiting
  Switzerland, and he said he had been on a business trip to Sweden); then the
  novel on her lap led to gossip about books and writers. He talked
  intelligently but not learnedly. Now that he was sitting up she could see he
  was less elderly than she had thought at first; the grey hair was misleading,
  he did not look more than fifty. He had a proud, strong type of face, the
  kind that looks sculptured, and there was a sense in which his voice and
  accent conveyed rather than betrayed the fact that he was American. If he
  were an actor, she reflected, Paul would probably not cast him for the part
  of an ambassador because he looked too much like one.</p>

  <p>Presently he asked if she were travelling alone, and when she said yes, he
  asked if she usually dined alone, or had made friends on board. She answered
  ruefully that so far on the trip she hadn't dined at all.</p>

  <p>"I think there'll be better weather from now on," he said.</p>

  <p>"I hope so. I'm not a good sailor, though I'm probably not the worst one
  either."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you'd care to join me for dinner this evening?"</p>

  <p>When she hesitated, not knowing whether she wanted to or not, he added
  with quick tact: "That is, if it keeps smooth." He got up with rather
  surprising agility and stooped to lift her hand. "Shall we say seven o'clock
  in the bar near the small restaurant? I'll look for you there, but if you
  don't feel equal to it, please don't bother. I'll understand."</p>

  <p>She noticed as he walked away that he was tall and had a good figure
  &mdash;perhaps he was still in his forties and the grey hair could be
  regarded as premature.</p>

  <p>By six o'clock she had almost made up her mind not to keep the
  appointment. He had given her an easy out, and it was true that the wind was
  freshening and the sea not quite so calm. But most of all she felt in herself
  a renewal of the inertia of indifference, plus a somewhat professional
  feeling that if she were not in a mood to be attractive she had no business
  to inflict herself on an audience, even a chance-met male audience of one.
  Then suddenly and for no reason she could think of except again a
  professional awareness of challenge, she decided to meet Mr. Bond at least
  for a drink and, if that much bored her, to excuse herself from dinner
  afterwards. The challenge thus accepted, even in part, she felt immediately
  encouraged; she dressed carefully and gave herself cautious approval in the
  mirror. She looked a little off colour, but the reason for it was obvious,
  and a drink was doubtless one of the things she needed.</p>

  <p>He was waiting when she got to the bar, and in a dinner-jacket he had the
  kind of anonymous distinction that the English have succeeded so well in
  making fashionable. Only perhaps by someone Irish could the thing be seen
  through and at the same time admired as an accomplishment. She smiled a
  greeting and began: "Well, I managed it. I won't prophesy, but I think I can
  last out a martini."</p>

  <p>He took her to a table. "Good. It must be very trying to be travelling
  alone when you don't feel well."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I haven't been really ill. Just resting and reading."</p>

  <p>"Lonely, though."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;or rather, if it has been, I've enjoyed it. Such a change from
  one's normal life&mdash;whole days of nothing to do, nobody to argue with, no
  problems, no appointments, no worries..."</p>

  <p>"Do you usually have worries?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't everybody?" The play that she hadn't wanted to talk about came in
  useful now. "I think an actress always worries about her next play even
  before she knows what it will be."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know yet?"</p>

  <p>She told him about the new comedy by the author of her recent big success;
  she would read it as soon as she got to New York, it was partly for this she
  was returning. "I suppose it won't come on till the fall, so there'll be
  plenty of time for rehearsing and polishing up&mdash;rewriting this scene and
  that and the usual mood of wondering whether it's a masterpiece or a piece of
  junk."</p>

  <p>"Somehow you don't sound as if you were looking forward to all that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm used to it."</p>

  <p>"But not looking forward to it this time?"</p>

  <p>He had a very quiet, persistent, but kindly way of refusing an answer that
  evaded.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," she said, and wondered why she was doing it, "I'm
  too tired right now to be looking forward to anything."</p>

  <p>"You'll feel better on dry land." The drinks arrived, which made him add:
  "Too bad it IS a dry land."</p>

  <p>So they had the usual exchange of views about Prohibition, and that led to
  general chatter about American affairs, including inevitably the stock
  market. She told him she had lost money and gave a light-hearted account of
  her husband's action in selling at the top in order to finance a film-making
  enterprise in Germany. "He'll probably lose it that way too, but how much
  more worth while."</p>

  <p>"Why should you think he'll lose it?"</p>

  <p>And she had to ask herself the same question. She answered, honestly,
  after a pause: "I expect it's my own conceit. You see, this is the first time
  he made a deal on his own without asking my advice."</p>

  <p>"Would your advice have been against it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't know what the deal is. And what right have I to
  pose as business adviser anyway&mdash;I haven't proved myself so smart
  lately."</p>

  <p>"Nor have a great many business people... Would you like another drink
  here or at the table?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and he asked her why. She said: "It reminded me of what they
  teach waitresses. Years ago, when we were hard up, I was one for a while, and
  whenever anyone ordered pie we were told to ask whether they wanted whipped
  cream or ice-cream with it. The customer who didn't want either had to make a
  stand."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't make a stand now."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't the strength. Four customers out of five hadn't. It was
  good psychology."</p>

  <p>"That's very interesting." He gave the order to the waiter, then said: "So
  you've had your hard times?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing very dreadful. Before we made our first hit we went through a
  few bad patches, that's all."</p>

  <p>"In New York?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and other places. It was in California that I was a waitress.
  Only for a short time&mdash;till Paul found a play."</p>

  <p>"You've worked together as a sort of team?"</p>

  <p>"Not deliberately&mdash;but I suppose it has been, more or less."</p>

  <p>"Until this German enterprise?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I couldn't expect to be in that. I've had no picture
  experience."</p>

  <p>From his silence she knew he realized how stupid the remark was, except as
  a revelation of things it did not say. Presently she went on: "Don't let me
  bore you with all this talk of my own affairs."</p>

  <p>"How could I be bored when I've been asking all the questions?"</p>

  <p>That was so. She replied: "Yes, but theatre shop can be pretty dull to
  those outside the business, and I rather imagine you are."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes, my own profession is far less romantic&mdash;and
  popular... I'm in a broker's office." The second drinks arrived and he raised
  his glass. "Well, here's to the new play. Whatever it turns out to be I shall
  make a point of seeing you in it."</p>

  <p>"I'll send you tickets for the first night."</p>

  <p>"That would be very kind of you."</p>

  <p>It would indeed, she reflected, considering they were so much sought after
  and he was someone she had met for the first time that day. She added: "If
  you promise to laugh at all the jokes, no matter how hard it is."</p>

  <p>"I promise. But why should it be hard?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, they may not be such good jokes. And then, too, it
  must be pretty hard for a broker to see a joke in anything nowadays. My own
  broker's having a nervous breakdown... Andy Reeves... I wonder if you happen
  to know him?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

  <p>"He's much older than you, I should imagine."</p>

  <p>"Now how old would you imagine I am?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed fifty-five when I first saw you but you've been growing younger
  ever since."</p>

  <p>He seemed amused by that and she felt the beginnings of a mood she
  sometimes got into when she was emerging out of fatigue&mdash;a sort of
  impishness, making her say things that were quite helplessly silly and only
  funny to others if she found them funny enough herself.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she keeled over and would have slipped to the floor had he
  not held her. It could hardly have been the drink, for she had had only one;
  the bar was rather stuffy, perhaps that was the reason. People made way for
  an emergency that had happened many times before on ocean liners, except that
  in this case it wasn't that particular emergency at all. As soon as he had
  helped her to the fresh air on deck she fully recovered, but he led her to
  her cabin and summoned the stewardess. He was very gracious and attentive and
  took his leave when the stewardess arrived. She didn't feel ill, or quite
  well either, so she swallowed some aspirin, undressed, and went to sleep. The
  next morning the seas were rough again, so she stayed in bed all day. He sent
  flowers.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The morning after that the Berengaria arrived at New York.
Amidst the
  last-minute scurry of packing and formalities she half wondered if she would
  see him again, but she did not look for him, and when the ship docked she
  followed her usual habit of waiting till nearly all the passengers were off
  before making her own way down the gangway to the customs. She soon found her
  luggage, among the last of the "S" group, but as she approached it an elderly
  stranger touched his hat, evidently recognizing her. "Mrs. Saffron? Mr. Bond
  asked me to help you through."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's very kind of him, but I haven't anything dutiable, so
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It'll be easy then. Your car's meeting you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'll take a taxi; but please don't bother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The man had already stepped to the customs officer and was saying
  something in his ear, with a result quite astonishing&mdash;the immediate
  passage of all her bags without inspection. Normally she disliked being
  singled out for special favour, but this time the act was performed so simply
  and quickly as to give her no time for embarrassment, and she was grateful
  besides, for she had had experience of customs men who seemed to have a
  special distrust of actresses.</p>

  <p>While the man was giving further instructions to a porter she said half
  jokingly: "That's one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. Thank
  you, and please thank Mr. Bond. He really must know the right people."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Saffron, I dare say he does... He also asked me to give you
  this letter."</p>

  <p>She couldn't figure quite what the man was&mdash;a servant, an employee?
  He hadn't introduced himself by name and he was dressed as nondescriptly as
  an hotel detective. She thanked him again and read the letter on the way to
  her apartment. It said merely: "I'm sure you consider we owe each other at
  least one dinner. Will you let me know an evening that suits you after you
  get settled? Yours sincerely, Austen Bond (aged forty-six)."</p>

  <p>Not till several days later did she happen to mention Mr. Bond to a friend
  as "the only man I spoke to during the entire trip&mdash;tall and rather
  handsome&mdash;something in a broker's office, he said."</p>

  <p>"My goodness, not AUSTEN Bond, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>At which the friend laughed raucously. She was a lively old snob who
  fancied herself as a connoisseur of that over-world which is, in its way,
  quite as secret as the underworld; everything in her private who's who
  depended on what KIND of duke, what KIND of millionaire, even what KIND of
  actress. Carey happened to be her kind, which was the kind that could be
  invited to the Colony Club. She said: "Well, darling, I guess you could call
  him something in a broker's office if you wanted. D'you really mean you've
  never heard of him?... I suppose that's possible&mdash;he's not the type that
  goes popping toy balloons at night clubs. Neither are you, for that
  matter&mdash;you two ought to get on well together."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't suppose we shall meet again."</p>

  <p>"You mean you won't call him up?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be so busy with the play from now on. I think I'll take it to the
  country and let it simmer in my mind for a few weeks."</p>

  <p>Michaelson gave her a typescript the next day, after which she went to
  Vermont to stay with the Whitmores, old friends whom she had known since the
  year of the struggle as she called it to herself&mdash;that first year in
  America when Paul couldn't find any kind of job. The Whitmores had been the
  means by which he had finally got the chance he needed. They were comfortably
  off, but not rich, and the small paper-mill which they owned and in which
  Harry Whitmore worked was a mile from their house at the other end of the
  small town. An open invitation to visit them any time she could spare was her
  only effective consolation for having sold Mapledurham, and now she was quick
  to avail herself of it. She read the new play in the Whitmores' garden, and
  thought it pretty good, but even while she thought so she was distrusting her
  own judgment&mdash;WAS it good, was it REALLY good? Of course there were
  comedies that made one laugh aloud at a first skim-through and later proved
  complete flops on the stage; perhaps the reverse could also operate. She
  certainly did not laugh or even smile during the several hours she gave to a
  careful reading, and afterwards she picked up a published copy that the
  Whitmores had of her last play and tried to imagine that that too was new
  &mdash;would it have seemed amusing either? But of course the test was
  invalid&mdash;the lines came to the ear as well as to the eye, and with the
  remembered laughter of an audience as punctuation. When Michaelson telephoned
  later in the day, eager to know her reaction, she had to tell him that she
  liked the new play well enough, because it would have seemed absurd to
  confess that her lukewarmness was probably due to some private mood of her
  own.</p>

  <p>A few days later Michaelson arrived with contracts. He had made a special
  trip to get her signature. Somehow she had not expected there would be that
  degree of urgency, but such evidence of being sought after gave her a touch
  of cheerful panic. She signed, measuring the weeks till August, when
  rehearsals would begin. Plenty of time to work up the right mood of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Towards the middle of July she returned to New York and met the author,
  who took her to lunch and proved, almost by algebra, that he had written a
  sure-fire successor to a success. But later the same day at a party she met
  another author who said he had heard a rumour that the new play was a bit of
  a let-down&mdash;what did SHE think? She used up all her new-found confidence
  in denying it vehemently.</p>

  <p>That evening at her apartment she read the play again, speaking many of
  the lines aloud, and in the midst of so doing she remembered Paul's remark:
  "It's about time you were bored with comedy." Was it that? Or was she still
  just tired?</p>

  <p>Suddenly she doubted if she would be any less bored or tired had it been a
  tragedy and the greatest play ever written. And in that mood, a rather
  frantic one, she ransacked her desk for Austen Bond's note and dialled his
  number. She knew, by then, who he was.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="part3"
     id="part3">PART THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Austen Bond was not well known in the modern metropolitan
  sense&mdash; that is, to newspaper columnists, head waiters, and the man in
  the street. He was rich, and had his own importance, but the firm of
  investment brokers of which he was head was not one of those on everybody's
  lips and he had no ambition to make it so. There was something in his mental
  attitude that always preferred quality to size, and his place in financial
  circles was of this kind also; he was satisfied to make a personal fortune
  just less than sensational and to influence, occasionally and obliquely,
  those who had greater influence. The stock-market collapse had not affected
  in the slightest degree the routine of his private life, which had long been
  unpretentious. His attitude towards the future, including his own, was
  affected by his unspoken opinion that capitalism had begun to die. He did not
  think this was good, but he believed it was inevitable; and he had found,
  from a few scraps of early experience, that many people assume that the man
  who prophesies something, also wishes it to happen. In his case this was not
  true, and would have been absurd if it had been; but his knowledge of how
  easily and dangerously he would be misunderstood made him keep his mouth
  shut. He was less tempted to open it because he also believed that, on the
  scale of events that he foresaw, nothing he could do or persuade others to do
  could change the outcome to any worth-while extent. He therefore confined his
  activities to certain machinations of the market, in which it would have been
  as nave to be a Marxian as a Seventh Day Adventist.</p>

  <p>Within this somewhat chilly circumference the intimate structure of his
  life had developed, up to a point, quite genially and not very remarkably. He
  had been left money and a job by his father, a Wall Street man of the old
  school, while his mother had contributed good looks and an equipment of
  innate good taste in the arts. Education at Groton and Harvard had followed,
  after which there had been years of hard work. In 1920, aged thirty-six, he
  had married a New Hampshire girl who loved horses and dogs and enjoyed New
  York only as a visiting country cousin; so he had bought some land in
  Connecticut and there they had spent much of each year quietly and very
  happily indeed. In 1925 she had died in an influenza epidemic, leaving a boy
  of three named Norris. After that he had lived even more retiringly, but
  mainly in the old family house in the East Sixties that he had inherited from
  his father. He had an unmarried aunt who often played hostess at his small
  and not too frequent dinner-parties; he belonged to a few good clubs and
  liked to go to plays, art exhibitions, and concerts. During school holidays,
  when Norris was at home, he sometimes took the boy to places like the
  Metropolitan Museum and the Statue of Liberty. He had, behind a reserve that
  was hard to penetrate, a quietly inflexible will and a loyalty to those who
  worked for him, so that those who knew and liked him best were doubtless his
  employees and servants.</p>

  <p>Austen had hardly expected to pick up an acquaintance with an actress on
  board the Berengaria. Not that he felt superior to the acting profession; on
  the contrary, he had a playgoer's affection for its leading figures, and
  Carey had often pleased him from the other side of the footlights. But he
  would not, had anyone forecast it, have agreed that he was at all likely to
  take the initiative in getting to know her. What had made him do so was that
  she looked unhappy. Minutes before she saw him he had recognized her; then he
  had closed his eyes to wonder what could be the matter, for though he was not
  simple enough to think that comedy stars must always be gay, the contrast
  between his recollection of her on the stage and the way she looked in the
  adjacent deck-chair had been too startling to ignore. Perhaps it was just the
  effects of a rough crossing; he hoped so, but he wished he could find out.
  Finally a kindly curiosity had made him speak.</p>

  <p>And of course she had proved to be a mixture of everything he remembered
  and much that he could now so pleasantly discover for himself, once the
  plunge had been taken; she still looked unhappy, yet she was good company,
  and certainly hard to put out of his mind when the trip was over.</p>

  <p>During dinner on that first evening at home he had said to Dunne, his
  butler: "I suppose you got Miss Arundel through the customs all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. And she asked me to thank you. A very charming lady... and I
  MEAN a lady." (Dunne, a Scotsman, was careful to avoid the behaviour of the
  stereotyped English butler&mdash;he was not obsequious, and he never used the
  phrase 'if I may say so'.)</p>

  <p>"Oh, and what makes you so sure of that?"</p>

  <p>"She knew better than to tip me."</p>

  <p>Austen laughed&mdash;which did not mean that he failed to take the
  diagnosis seriously. He had a very high regard for Dunne's social
  assessments; there was something professional about them, as if he himself
  were to offer an opinion of Portuguese Fours. Indeed, he had a high regard
  for the man altogether. As his father's butler Dunne had been his boyhood
  friend, had taught him chess, and to ride a bicycle, and how to identify
  different birds in Central Park; Dunne had taken him for vagrant walks along
  Madison Avenue, explaining the difference between real and sham antiques in
  the shops; Dunne had lent him money when he had overspent his schoolboy
  allowance, had visited him at Harvard after his father's death to break the
  news that his mother was seriously ill. And Dunne, after Fran's death, though
  no one knew about this, had helped him through the worst crisis of
  bereavement. Austen had sometimes wondered if in an improved world, where
  there would doubtless be no master and servant, any other framework for such
  a relationship would be devised. If not, he would consider the improvement
  overrated.</p>

  <p>When Carey telephoned, he felt a stab of pleasure as he heard her voice.
  After the long interval he had ceased to expect her to call; he assumed she
  must regard their acquaintance as a mere shipboard freak. He had a genuine
  modesty that made him consider himself dull by the standards that
  professional entertainers might set, and that an actress should seek his
  company must mean either that she liked him or that she was coldly appraising
  his social and financial eligibility. All his instinct was to believe Carey
  incapable of the latter.</p>

  <p>He invited her to dine with him the following evening at his house, and
  her prompt acceptance sounded so much like that of an old friend that he let
  himself forget that they knew each other so slightly. Their telephone
  conversation was short, and that too pleased him; she could not, he
  reflected, have known how he disliked telephoning and how rarely he gave
  anyone his private number. Then he asked himself why he had, since the postal
  address would have sufficed, and the reason he fastened on was that he had
  wished to give her a better chance to act on impulse. After all, it was
  impulse that had made him speak to her on the Berengaria, and impulse, having
  begun so well, might claim a right to be encouraged. For him it was at least
  a novelty in a life so largely reasoned and reasonable. He sat in his
  favourite chair in the dark panelled library and meditated long after he had
  spoken to her. Only once did he have a flash of misgiving&mdash;when he
  wondered again if she would find an evening with him pretty dull&mdash;if,
  for instance, she would expect a lively party, or even for that matter a
  tte--tte&mdash;for of course his old aunt would be present, he would
  observe all the proprieties, at any rate until friendship had become
  established. And he must tell her, he decided, why it was that he hadn't
  invited her to a restaurant.</p>

  <p>He told her while they drank sherry together in that same room the next
  evening. He noted her dress&mdash;black and gold, very becoming, and also
  tactfully suitable to whatever he or others might have been wearing, for in
  the brevity of his invitation he had given her no clues. He noticed also her
  grey-blue eyes and the little gap between one side tooth and its neighbour, a
  gap too small for a dentist to fill, yet a pleasing imperfection, especially
  when she gave the slightly twisting smile that matched her prevalent
  mood.</p>

  <p>He was saying: "I hope you wouldn't have preferred going to a restaurant,
  but the fact is, as long as Prohibition's the law of the land I don't care to
  break it publicly." He smiled. "You can judge how moral that attitude is from
  the way I'm willing to transgress in private."</p>

  <p>"I think it could still be a moral attitude," she answered. "They're apt
  to be stronger than morals&mdash;or rather, they can hang on long after
  morals give up."</p>

  <p>Wondering what was in her mind, he went on lightly: "It also happens that
  I hate noise and commotion and sitting amongst strangers&mdash;except, of
  course, when it's all made worth while by a good play. Tell me, how's the new
  one coming along?"</p>

  <p>He saw a shadow cross her face till she made the effort of dismissal. "Oh,
  pretty well. I've read it and signed the contracts, but we don't begin
  rehearsing till August, so there's nothing much to do just yet."</p>

  <p>"No learning of lines?"</p>

  <p>"Not till after the first readings&mdash;the stage-readings, I mean, with
  the cast and the director. So many changes are made then, as a rule &mdash;it
  wouldn't help much to be word perfect in the play as it is... But learning
  lines isn't hard once you get the real feel of the play. If you're absorbed
  you seem to memorize even when you read it privately."</p>

  <p>"Is that happening to you with this play?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no&mdash;not so much."</p>

  <p>"Then the play hasn't absorbed you&mdash;yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not altogether... which means that Paul might be right&mdash;Paul, my
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't read the play, of course&mdash;he's in Germany&mdash;but when
  we met recently he said it was time I was bored with comedy."</p>

  <p>"And are you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, I'd better not be. He just put the idea into my head. I suppose
  I ought to be used to that by now&mdash;he's so full of ideas&mdash;they
  shoot out like sparks when he's directing."</p>

  <p>"And the director of the new play doesn't have any sparks?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't experienced them yet. Maybe he will. Or maybe it'll be my fault
  for not being electrified. I hope all this doesn't sound too occult."</p>

  <p>"No more than my own work would sound to you if I talked about it."</p>

  <p>"But you don't&mdash;and you set me a good example."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;that wasn't what I meant. I'm really interested in the
  theatre&mdash;not only as a playgoer but&mdash;well, for one reason
  &mdash;-because of you. So please go on. I wish I knew more about it&mdash;
  what rehearsals are like, how the director functions, and so on."</p>

  <p>"Come along and see, some day, if you think you'd enjoy the
  experience."</p>

  <p>"To a rehearsal?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I dare say I could sneak you in." She laughed a little and his
  questioning look made her add: "I'm laughing to think how impossible that
  would have been if Paul had been here. One of his inflexible rules&mdash;no
  strangers at rehearsals."</p>

  <p>"I can't say I blame him."</p>

  <p>"You would, if you'd ever seen him turn somebody out."</p>

  <p>"From the look on your face I can see you don't blame him either."</p>

  <p>"Not with my heart, because I think I understand him, but with my mind
  I've called him all kinds of names."</p>

  <p>The way she said that made him catch his breath, for the words had a
  beauty that seemed to belong out of their context, as if she were speaking
  some kind of benediction on a vastly larger matter. Then his aunt came into
  the room and introductions broke the spell. Aunt Mildred was in her late
  sixties, obviously though not slavishly devoted to her nephew, a serene
  good-humoured woman. She had developed the technique of being an unobtrusive
  hostess without ever accepting the role of mere chaperon, and she and Carey
  liked each other in an instant way that neither of them took any trouble to
  conceal.</p>

  <p>The dinner, Austen thought, was a definite success. Of course the food and
  drink were excellent, they always were (another of the advantages of home, or
  rather of being able to afford a French chef), and the conversation did not
  flag amongst the three of them. He knew Carey must be enjoying herself,
  because he could imagine that a stranger meeting her for the first time would
  not think her unhappy at all, though he himself still caught a darker mood
  behind her gaiety&mdash;not that the gaiety was ever false. It was strange to
  feel such confidence that he understood her, so that after coffee, when Aunt
  Mildred excused herself to go to bed early, he hinted at a movie with the
  near-certainty as well as the hope that she would decline. She said:
  "Frankly, I'd rather see pictures in the afternoon when I've nothing else to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Good. Then let's take it easy."</p>

  <p>They went by elevator to the roof above the sixth floor, where a small
  secluded garden had been laid out in tubs and boxes. The air wafted the
  flavour and sounds of the streets, yet it was a pleasant place to relax on a
  summer evening. When she finally left, not long before midnight, she said
  warmly: "I HAVE enjoyed myself&mdash;I like going somewhere without being
  involved in terrific plans to go somewhere else&mdash;I like sitting and
  talking to someone who doesn't feel it's boring to do just that."</p>

  <p>He said: "I hope we're going to meet again&mdash;often."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. And don't forget to come to a rehearsal. Not just yet&mdash;one
  of the last would probably be most fun for you. That would be late in
  August."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime... during the hot weather... I have a farm in
  Connecticut&mdash;sometimes I invite a few friends there for the week-end
  &mdash;if you'd care to... if you like the country..."</p>

  <p>"I love it. I was born on a farm. So was Paul&mdash;but he hated it.
  That's a strange difference between us&mdash;or perhaps between Iowa and
  Ireland, though I've never seen Iowa."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll arrange something quite soon. Not a big party. Do anything
  &mdash;or nothing&mdash;swim, dance, play bridge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which of them do YOU do?"</p>

  <p>"Bridge I rather like, but that won't matter&mdash;there'll be others who
  don't play, and the effort to entertain you will be very slight indeed. For
  myself, during the daytime I mostly potter about with the man who runs the
  place for me&mdash;sometimes I ride over a few fields and try to think I'm a
  genuine farmer."</p>

  <p>"But you really enjoy it&mdash;pottering about like that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I wouldn't do it otherwise&mdash;why should I? It's like you with
  a new play&mdash;if you didn't like it, you wouldn't feel you had to act in
  it... May I fix a date, then, and let you know? We might drive out
  together."</p>

  <p>There were many things that surprised him after she had gone. To begin
  with, that he had invited her to the farm at all, and also that, in doing so,
  he hadn't told her the complete truth. He was a little appalled by what faced
  him now&mdash;a reopening of old memories, an ultimatum to grief,
  arrangements and complications and decisions, the welcome of local people who
  hadn't seen him for years and would regard his return as evidence that a new
  stage in his life had been reached. And perhaps it had. In the morning he
  told Dunne of his intention and actually asked the old man whom he should
  invite&mdash;he was as uninterested as that in all his guests except one.
  Dunne pondered and spoke a few names. They were not of close friends, for
  Austen hadn't any, except Dunne himself; but there were many people he knew
  fairly well, and liked, and who liked him. After a list had been compiled he
  said: "I think I'll ask Mrs. Saffron too&mdash;she's charming, isn't she? I
  could see you were thinking that yourself last night."</p>

  <p>"I was indeed, sir."</p>

  <p>Austen looked up gratefully. He wondered, at that early stage, how he
  would have acted had his butler disapproved.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The farm was about two hours' drive from the city and a
dozen miles
  inland. A house dating from Revolutionary times formed a nucleus that had
  been cleverly added to; there was a large barn where dances and parties could
  be held, as well as a group of modern guest cottages. The land sloped from
  the main building to a stream, widened in one place to make a swimming-pool
  that seemed a part of the natural landscape. Trees fringed a formal garden,
  and there were woods beyond, rising to a ridge. The whole property covered
  six or seven hundred acres, most of it tilled; there was a second farmhouse,
  not so old and much more practical, in which Grainger lived. Grainger, like
  Dunne, had worked for Austen's father.</p>

  <p>When Austen arrived with Carey towards evening on the last Friday in July
  he braced himself for the shock of seeing again the place where he had been
  so happy, but the shock was not what he had expected; it struck, but without
  the leaden bruise; it was more a sharpness that made him specially sensitive
  to Carey at his side. "Well, here we are," he said, as they drove up. He
  hoped she would catch, as he did, the beauty of the old brick in the sunset
  glow, and when she remarked on it, as surely as if he had pointed it out, an
  unbelievable pleasure filled him. They left the car, Dunne (who had been
  there since morning) helping them and taking the bags; the familiar entrance
  and hall beyond faced him without challenge. He had thought he would remember
  Fran; but instead he could think only of Carey.</p>

  <p>Several other guests had already arrived; more were expected later. They
  were not celebrities, though not nonentities either&mdash;the Peter
  Rushmores, he an architect, had probably the best-known name. There were no
  brokers or financiers. Austen did not like to talk his own shop, but other
  people's interested him&mdash;he had a wistful curiosity about such things as
  how to run a woman's page, or excavate for a sub-basement, or cook clam
  chowder. All the people he liked enough to have at the farm were working
  people, in an extended sense; it was not that he did not care for drones, but
  that drones were usually the kind of people he did not care for. And perhaps
  because the people he did care for were attractive and hard-working, they
  were often successful in their own fields&mdash;successful enough for them
  not to think of him primarily as a person 'worth knowing'. He was, indeed,
  immensely wealthier than they were, and quick to help them in any financial
  emergency (there had been some lately, since the stock-market collapse), but
  he liked their own success to guarantee him against the fear that their
  friendship could have any ulterior motive. To this extent, wealth had been a
  restrictive influence in his life; it had made him cautious in affection, not
  because he was afraid of being sponged on, but because he shrank from an
  emotional investment that might turn out humiliatingly. In a profound sense
  he knew the corrupting power of wealth, and on a scale impossible to convey
  to anyone outside his own business; he knew that not only individuals but
  whole classes and generations and empires could catch the Midas infection,
  and it was his belief (private, like most of his beliefs) that America in the
  'twenties had been so infected. Apart from the personal havoc which was
  tragic and obvious around him, he could not regret what had been happening in
  Wall Street since the previous October; but he would never say so, because
  his own position as either Cassandra or moralist would be clearly impossible.
  Once again his impulse to be secretive was geared to the likelihood that few
  people would understand him. On perhaps the worst day in Wall Street's
  history a frenzied speculator had somehow pierced his line of clerks and
  secretaries and demanded face-to-face how he could reconcile it with his
  conscience to profit out of national disaster. Austen must have been
  disturbed or he would not have replied, as he did: "The national disaster is
  not that prices should now fall, but that they should ever have been forced
  so high. To that disaster I did not contribute&mdash;on the other hand, my
  own operations tended to prevent them from going higher. And today, my
  friend, while you have been adding to what you call the disaster by selling,
  I have been supporting prices by buying back. The fact that I personally
  profited is immaterial." It was the only time (and an ill-chosen one) that he
  attempted a logical, indeed a classic defence of his own function, and the
  reason (illogically) was that the troubles of other people did affect him,
  and all the more because even to say so would have seemed hypocritical.</p>

  <p>That week-end at the farm made proof, if he had ever needed it, that Carey
  could come close to his heart and mind if she wished. Whether this was likely
  he could not yet decide. But he guessed that her husband's return (in
  September, she had said) would set limits to whatever had not been
  accomplished before.</p>

  <p>"You must be looking forward to it," he said, as they inspected the
  stables and milking-sheds that Sunday morning.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," she answered eagerly, and then added, as if she were having to
  think it out: "Yes, I think so."</p>

  <p>"Only that?"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "It's really quite a lot. I couldn't ever really explain just
  how I DO feel about Paul."</p>

  <p>He took that as a closure of the subject till she went on: "It's strange
  &mdash;I'm quite happy without him so long as I know he's happy. I don't miss
  him, exactly, and I know when he does come home what a to-do there'll be
  &mdash;everything upside down, the whole of my life in an uproar. He CONSUMES
  people. It's probably good for me, though&mdash;I'm naturally rather
  lazy."</p>

  <p>"How's his film progressing?"</p>

  <p>"All right, I suppose. He doesn't write much about it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and he doesn't answer."</p>

  <p>"So he doesn't answer, and you don't miss him, and you don't really want
  your life to be in an uproar, and yet... there must be an 'and yet'."</p>

  <p>"There is... but I don't know what it is."</p>

  <p>"It might be love."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it might, mightn't it? I expect we all love differently."</p>

  <p>They walked some way while he told her about the farm, the way he had
  acquired it, and his plans for development. Apparently it had been only half
  arable land at first, and he had made a point of reclaiming more and more
  each year, clearing, liming, and fertilizing; he had taken a scientific
  interest in soil conservation and had experimented with different kinds of
  crop rotation. Everything that modern farm management could do was still in
  progress, for he had good men working for him; but the way he talked of it
  somehow conveyed a revival of his own interest after a long interval, and he
  could guess that she sensed this. So he said abruptly: "I misled you when I
  asked you here. I gave you an impression that these week-ends were a normal
  thing for me. Actually this is the first time I've been here since my wife
  died."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Rushmores told me."</p>

  <p>"You must have thought I hadn't been very frank."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it matters, now that I know."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you know. Fran and I were so very happy."</p>

  <p>"I was told that too."</p>

  <p>"I didn't think I'd ever have the nerve to face all the memories&mdash;
  places we did this and that, the walks we took&mdash;Sunday morning walks
  just like this... My boy Norris comes home from school soon. Will you spend
  another week-end here and get to know him?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to very much."</p>

  <p>He took her arm. "Good&mdash;because we must make the most of our time,
  mustn't we, before your play opens?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll be pretty busy then, one way and another."</p>

  <p>He was fairly sure that the same interpretation of that was in both their
  minds.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She visited the farm again in August, but this time he had
no one else
  there except Norris and Aunt Mildred. He had expected Norris to like Carey,
  and the boy did, but it somewhat amazed him that she seemed to enjoy the
  meeting for its own sake. He himself was devoted to his son, but he found it
  hard to establish contact with a somewhat difficult eight-year-old, and he
  had set the age of fifteen in his mind as a date from which he and Norris
  could really begin to understand each other. And of course it would be easier
  still, later on. He looked forward most of all to a young man, home from
  Harvard, discovering his father as an equal.</p>

  <p>"He's so friendly and intelligent," Carey said. "It's fun to talk to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Because you know how."</p>

  <p>"Well, most children are actors, so we have that in common... Paul used to
  say he could make an actor of any child under ten&mdash;and UNTIL he was
  ten."</p>

  <p>"Did... does Paul like children?"</p>

  <p>"I think he would have, if we'd had any. Whenever he directed children in
  a play he was like a rather sinister Santa Claus, if you can imagine such a
  thing. They were fascinated."</p>

  <p>"As you were too."</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh no, I wasn't taken in for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I meant that you must have been fascinated in some kind of way&mdash;
  when you first met him... A man so... so remarkable..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, THEN! Yes, I was seventeen and he came to Dublin on business. He was
  the first brilliant man I ever knew. And the MOST brilliant. He always has
  been. I only wish he'd be brilliant now about the new play."</p>

  <p>"It's worrying you?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly. It's just that I'm not excited enough. One ought to be
  excited about a new play."</p>

  <p>"Or else not be in it at all?"</p>

  <p>"But the part's made for me&mdash;written for me, in fact. I don't know
  what there is wrong&mdash;maybe nothing. I expect I'll be all right on the
  night. That comes under the heading of famous last words."</p>

  <p>"You don't get nervous?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens, yes. Paul does too&mdash;he can lose ten pounds during
  rehearsals. And that doesn't do him any harm either."</p>

  <p>"He's a big man?"</p>

  <p>"BIG?" The word seemed to amuse her. "Well, he's... I think I've got a
  photograph."</p>

  <p>She opened her handbag and found a snapshot. "I took this several years
  ago&mdash;it's good because it doesn't flatter like the professional
  ones."</p>

  <p>Paul was unlike anything Austen had in the least expected, and from then
  on, in a curious way, he thought of Carey a little differently.</p>

  <p>He said: "A personality&mdash;one can tell that... And what a pretty
  garden!"</p>

  <p>"It is, isn't it? Only a small place, near Stroudsburg, not really as
  beautiful as here, but I used to love it."</p>

  <p>"You don't go there any more?"</p>

  <p>"We had to sell&mdash;or rather, I had to&mdash;last year. I lost a lot in
  the market and I didn't think I could keep up two homes."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you once tell me Paul sold out at the top?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, HE did. He was smart&mdash;or else lucky."</p>

  <p>He gripped her arm. "I'll tell you one way he's lucky, and that's to have
  you... I hope he realizes it."</p>

  <p>"But I'm lucky too. I'd never have been successful on the stage without
  him."</p>

  <p>"You're very modest to say that. Does he agree with you?"</p>

  <p>"You bet he does. HE'S not modest."</p>

  <p>She laughed, and he had again a feeling which only now he was able to put
  into words for his own private consideration later: that Paul did not make
  her happy, but that in some incurable way she was able to take delight in
  him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She had scored such a definite hit with Norris that it was
obvious to
  assume another meeting soon. Austen was pleased on the boy's behalf, but he
  was also glad for himself because it meant a further stage in their own
  advancing friendship. He knew by now that he was very much in love with
  Carey.</p>

  <p>They met often during the weeks that followed. She visited the farm at
  week-ends, when there were sometimes, but not always, outside guests; she
  dined frequently at the house in the East Sixties, where there was usually
  only Aunt Mildred with them. He realized that she found, both at the farm and
  at the house, some kind of comfort that appealed to her. As the rehearsals
  for the new play got under way, he guessed that what he could offer, if
  nothing else, was actually a refuge from the theatre&mdash;a place where she
  could not be reached on business, where she need not talk or even think about
  it if she wished not to. He had once called for her at her own small
  apartment, and during the short time he was there had heard her end of
  several long telephone conversations; they had sounded to him as if the play
  were in trouble of some kind, though when he hinted this she said lightly
  that it was no more than usual. But she had seemed harassed and glad to
  escape.</p>

  <p>One evening she arrived at his house with a look that did not wear off
  after the first drink. He gave her time to tell him anything amiss that might
  have happened, and when she kept up the effort to talk gaily he asked what
  was the matter.</p>

  <p>"The matter?... Why?... So I really AM a bad actress?"</p>

  <p>"It's because you know you don't have to act with me, and that makes you
  half-act."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if that's the case, I'll tell you, though it's not startling. I
  mean, it's the sort of thing that's happened before&mdash;and doubtless will
  again."</p>

  <p>"Trouble with the show?"</p>

  <p>"MY show... No, not particularly. I had a letter from Paul this
  morning."</p>

  <p>He did not reply, and was surprised to find how fast his heart was
  beating.</p>

  <p>She went on: "He's in some kind of a mess with that film."</p>

  <p>"Serious?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It's hard to tell from his letter what exactly has been
  happening, but he seems to have had trouble with the people who're putting up
  the money. They're trying to dispossess him&mdash;or something like that...
  CAN you be dispossessed of a film you've made yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I should think so. It's like any other property."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course to Paul it isn't. He didn't mind when I sold the house in
  the country&mdash;in fact, it was he who suggested it&mdash;but his WORK...
  that's different. It's like an artist having his own canvases seized for
  debt."</p>

  <p>"That could probably happen too, in certain circumstances. Is the film
  finished?"</p>

  <p>"He says it is, but they want a different ending and he refuses to make
  one. I suppose it depends on the kind of contract... Well, let's not have it
  spoil our evening. I didn't intend to tell you&mdash;after all, why should
  you be burdened with someone else's worries?"</p>

  <p>He said: "If I had to answer that, I'd ask why you should be burdened by a
  rather difficult little problem child who doesn't happen to be your own."</p>

  <p>"I see. Your son and my husband... you'd class them both as problems?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"But I like Norris, and I don't think you'd like Paul. Unless he happened
  to be in one of his charming moods."</p>

  <p>"You think I'd find him irresistible then?"</p>

  <p>"I've known it to happen."</p>

  <p>"Does his letter ask your advice?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he's had that&mdash;I told him at the outset to make sure of a
  good lawyer. I wish I could help him, but what can I do&mdash;from here? And
  if I went over to try to straighten things out&mdash;I can't, of course
  &mdash;I'd probably find that the people he's up against have a case."</p>

  <p>"You've known that happen too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Tell me... well, no, it's little use even discussing things at this
  range... Would you like another drink?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I would. And I CAN talk of something else, I assure you. I'm not
  going to worry."</p>

  <p>For the rest of the evening it seemed that she didn't, or perhaps she was
  only keeping a promise not to; they talked of other subjects and in some ways
  their conversation had never been livelier. Aunt Mildred, before she went up
  to bed, even commented on Carey's high spirits&mdash;how well she was
  looking, evidently the week-ends at the farm agreed with her and so on.
  Later, when they were alone in the library, Austen said: "I don't want to
  intrude, but I have certain contacts in Germany... people who could probably
  find out the facts about Paul's situation... strictly for ourselves&mdash;
  Paul wouldn't even need to know it was being done. Would you like me to write
  to them?"</p>

  <p>She seemed touched by his offer, then amused by it. "You're so tactful
  &mdash;you say Paul wouldn't even need to know about it. As if he'd
  care."</p>

  <p>"Well, so much the better. Just an outside and impartial report. Until we
  have that there's nothing else can be done."</p>

  <p>"I never thought there was. It's kind of you, though, to suggest writing
  to your... contacts. They're not private detectives, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>He wondered what was in her mind to have said that. "No, just financial
  people, quite respectable, but they have a good nose for other people's
  affairs."</p>

  <p>He cabled that night, after she had gone, and for ten days there was no
  reply except an acknowledgment; nor did she hear again from Paul. She told
  him that such a gap in her husband's letter-writing need not be of any
  significance; he was alive and well, she knew that much from his regular
  letters to his mother. More and more Austen was getting acquainted with the
  structure of her life, and Paul's mother was clearly a part of it. He was
  reluctant to put personal questions, but he did ask her once if these letters
  to the old lady contained any fresh news about his business troubles.</p>

  <p>She answered: "Oh no, and they wouldn't be likely to. She only gets GOOD
  news. He adores her&mdash;she's the last person he'd worry if things were
  going wrong."</p>

  <p>A few days later Austen received a long communication whose contents made
  him postpone rather than expedite his next meeting with Carey. He had much to
  think about and decide. When he had done so he invited her to the farm for a
  week-end. On their usual Sunday morning walk Grainger was with them at first,
  discussing crops and animals; then when they were alone, Austen began with no
  preamble: "I have some information about Paul. He's in the midst of a legal
  mix-up, and he does have a lawyer, of course, but I'm afraid&mdash;as you
  guessed&mdash;he hasn't got too good a case."</p>

  <p>"They can't put him in prison if he loses it, can they?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, it's a purely civil action... Why, what makes you... ?"</p>

  <p>He paused, reconsidering the question as too personal, but she answered
  without reluctance: "He once got into trouble in England over some money he'd
  borrowed to stage a play."</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The judge said he didn't think he'd actually intended to defraud
  anyone... and anyhow, by that time a play I was in was making money so we
  could repay the amount."</p>

  <p>"I can see you've had your difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Yes... but after that Paul left all money affairs in my hands&mdash; that
  is, until recently. What sort of people is he fighting?"</p>

  <p>"A few Berlin business men who're much like other business men&mdash; they
  don't like to lose money."</p>

  <p>"First of all, though, Paul spent his own money."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and to be fair, he seems to have been just as extravagant with
  that."</p>

  <p>"How about the film itself? Is it good?"</p>

  <p>"My informant didn't say. It's probably the last thing anybody's wondering
  about till the lawsuit is over&mdash;except you and Paul."</p>

  <p>"He's not wondering. He KNOWS. He told me it was good."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you ask, Carey&mdash;unless you think he could be
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>She suddenly put her hand to her eyes. "Yes, why DID I ask? He told me,
  and if I ever lose that kind of faith in him, I lose it in myself... perhaps
  that's what's been happening to me lately."</p>

  <p>"CAREY!"</p>

  <p>She had a puzzled look. "It's true, though. I don't seem to be able to act
  any more."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the trouble. After all, it's a comedy, and if I'm serious I'm
  no help." She began to laugh, then. "Perhaps it's only temporary, till I get
  used to a new situation. It's odd&mdash;when I was a girl I had ambition to
  be a GREAT actress, which was absurd, because I haven't it in me. When Paul
  came along he soon convinced me of that, but on the other hand he did make me
  a pretty big success&mdash;he saw SOMETHING in me and developed it more than
  I could ever have imagined or hoped for. But in a way I surrendered
  everything in the process&mdash;even ambition. I didn't NEED ambition, with
  him around&mdash;his was enough for both of us, and of course everything he
  did included me&mdash;until lately. So now I have to get hold of myself, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>From that moment something that Austen had already dreamed of became in
  his mind a possibility to be handled with care and calm and infinite
  patience. And to do this, to envisage the remote chance and guide it, partly
  following it, to the safe haven of happening&mdash;this was a task for which
  few minds were better equipped.</p>

  <p>What he already dreamed was that Carey should some day divorce Paul and
  marry him. But that, in itself, was not enough, or even desirable, unless it
  came about in a positive way&mdash;not only by her own realization that he,
  Austen, could make her happier than Paul had, but by her own desire for that
  extra happiness. Mere disillusionment with Paul would not perform the
  miracle; Austen had no desire to capture her on any kind of rebound. And yet,
  at the right moment, disillusionment might help. He had given the matter much
  thought, and he believed he would know the right moment if and when it came
  &mdash;or at least he would know when it had not yet come. For this reason he
  did not tell her more than a fraction of what he had learned about Paul. His
  German informants had done a thorough job, but the weapon as handed him was
  too clumsy; he shrank from the practice of emotional blackmail, even if it
  would work. But beyond his fastidiousness was a sense of timing as subtle, in
  its way, as an actor's. It was not the first time he had had to judge when
  the day was rainy enough to make necessary the disclosure of a hidden
  reserve. There was no such urgency&mdash;yet, and on Paul's return the whole
  thing might even have to be postponed indefinitely. In that case he, Austen,
  would be thankful for not having precipitated the kind of crisis that would
  make his own future relationship with Carey impossible. She would have time;
  indeed, it was hard to realize she was still so young. Perhaps it was self-
  flattery that he always thought of her as older than she was; or perhaps it
  was the one thing Paul had done&mdash;unwittingly, unforgivably, yet
  fortunately&mdash;for his successor. He had AGED her.</p>

  <p>After dinner that evening Austen said: "I expect you've been wondering how
  we can help Paul. How would you like me to buy an interest in the
  picture?"</p>

  <p>"YOU?"</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be so far out of my line."</p>

  <p>"But how would it help?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "You were upset this afternoon&mdash;that's why I didn't go
  into details then. As I size up the situation, there are a group of business
  men who originally had faith in Paul. All they want now is to cut a loss and
  be rid of him. Specifically, they want to bring in another director to change
  the ending of the picture&mdash;to make it more commercial, I suppose. That's
  what the legal sparring is all about. But I've an idea that if someone were
  to come along and offer to buy their investment at so many cents on the
  dollar&mdash;and perhaps not so very many at that&mdash;they'd jump at
  it."</p>

  <p>"It mightn't be a profitable investment for you."</p>

  <p>"Listen... You said the picture must be good because Paul told you so.
  I'll take your word for it, just as you take his."</p>

  <p>"But I meant good artistically."</p>

  <p>"Let me keep my cynical belief that there can be money even in art."</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;if you did buy&mdash;how would it help HIM?"</p>

  <p>"By ending all the legal tangle, with him left in full artistic control,
  because naturally I shouldn't interfere. It's not, by the way, a very costly
  picture, by American standards. When I said he'd been extravagant, I meant
  relatively."</p>

  <p>"Austen... it's terribly generous of you, but I can't see why you should
  do it."</p>

  <p>"I won't, unless I can get a bargain, so don't call it generous. Anyhow,
  there's no harm in having my people over there feel things out. And in the
  meantime, not a word in your letters to Paul. This kind of negotiation has to
  be done rather secretly. I hope he won't mind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not worrying about that. He'll be happy enough as long as you
  leave him alone."</p>

  <p>"I'll leave him alone, all right."</p>

  <p>A couple of weeks later they had news for each other. They met at his New
  York house and he told her as casually as he could that he had bought the
  film. "It was pretty much as I thought&mdash;which means that the price was
  low. So low, indeed, that I really don't see how I can lose."</p>

  <p>"Then why did they sell?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but if you want me to guess I'd say that Paul's been such a
  headache they're glad to get out at any price."</p>

  <p>"That's possible."</p>

  <p>She seemed so disinterested that he waited for her to reveal why. After a
  silence he went on: "You don't seem very excited."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I'd already heard about it from Paul. I had a letter this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see. And what's his attitude?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head as if in despair at being able to convey it. "He's
  unpredictable&mdash;I'd have thought he'd be glad, or at least that he
  wouldn't care... but the kind of letter he sent me... about some Wall Street
  millionaire buying the picture over his head&mdash;you'd think he'd been
  insulted."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he doesn't realize yet that I don't intend to interfere. When he
  does he may feel differently."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. Now that the picture's finished and the trouble's all over,
  I'll bet the whole thing's already half out of his mind. He's like that...
  He's not coming back just yet, by the way."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"He'd planned it for next month, but now he says he can't get away till
  later in the year."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad... for you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's disappointing, isn't it? But the reason he gives is funny
  &mdash;he says he's working on an idea for another picture, only this time
  it'll be all his own and he's not going to have interference from
  anybody."</p>

  <p>She began to laugh, rather wildly, at that. He came over to her chair and
  touched her shoulder. He had never felt more tempted to put the issue to some
  kind of test, but caution prevailed. He said: "I'm glad you're not upset."
  (Although he wondered if she were.) "Personally I'm looking forward to seeing
  his picture. I've asked them to ship me a print and I'll find some place we
  can have it run for us. Now tell me about your own affairs. How's the play
  going?"</p>

  <p>"It's shaping up. We open for a trial week in New Haven after Labour
  Day."</p>

  <p>"Then I'd better fix a time for coming to one of your rehearsals."</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you still want to. I thought you'd forgotten. You might find it
  interesting."</p>

  <p>He did indeed, for it was a completely novel experience to sit in an
  almost empty theatre and watch a play without benefit of scenery, adequate
  lighting, or audience response. As an outsider he was struck at first by the
  improvisations&mdash;the stage manager's 'ting-a-ling' to indicate a
  telephone call, the way in which non-existent properties were assumed to be
  touchable and movable by the actors. It was as fascinating as the inside of a
  piano to a little boy who sees it tuned for the first time, and there was
  enough of the little boy in Austen to keep him preoccupied for at least ten
  minutes. After that he began to listen with an effort to judge the play as a
  whole. Never before had he taken a deliberately critical mind to a theatre;
  usually, like most patrons, he went to be entertained, and either was or
  wasn't, with no particular need to decide why. He realized he had no
  specialized critical equipment, still less any experience that would enable
  him to discount the conditions of a rehearsal. Yet the intelligence to know
  what he lacked was itself a sort of equipment, and on this basis he found
  himself doubtful, half-way through the first act, that the play was good
  enough, and sure, half-way through the second act, that it wasn't. By 'good
  enough' he meant, modestly, the kind of play he would have put money into had
  he been the kind of speculator who backs plays at all. That was the only way
  he felt qualified to make a decision, and fortunately he hadn't to make it.
  Later he privately decided that the play's only chance of success was in the
  stratosphere of some miraculous carnival mood, if the latter should take hold
  of Carey; there was no sign of it yet, or even that it was possible. At
  least, however, he would give it no discouragement. So he told her, when she
  met him afterwards, that he had enjoyed himself and thought she might have
  another winner.</p>

  <p>"You're very sweet, Austen. Paul was like that too&mdash;a play before it
  opened was always going to be the biggest hit that ever was. Salvation by
  faith, I suppose. But it didn't prevent him from taking the actors aside and
  telling them separately how bad they were."</p>

  <p>The reception at New Haven was more favourable than Austen had expected;
  the house was sold out and applause, especially for Carey, considerable. Yet
  he returned to New York the next day with a strong feeling that the theatre
  was another of the things he must rescue her from. His inside glimpse into
  the lives of actors had fascinated him, but without enchantment; he had been
  chiefly impressed by the strain and uncertainties of their work, the last-
  minute anxieties and confusion, the wear and tear on the nervous fabric.</p>

  <p>The New York opening also went better than he had expected, but by then he
  had come to expect so little that this was faint praise, and the applause
  seemed almost an effort by an audience that liked Carey to make amends for
  not having laughed enough at the play. He went to her dressing-room
  afterwards and joined in the general chorus of congratulation; he felt that
  nobody was sincere, yet that the play had not failed so conspicuously as to
  make insincerity mercifully impossible. He was sensitive to atmosphere, even
  in an unfamiliar world, and excused himself from an after-the-show party
  chiefly for the reason that he doubted how long he could match the
  professional make-believers in their make-believe. Carey understood, or he
  thought she did; she seemed relieved to let him go. The next day, calling at
  his house, she confirmed that the party had been a progressively dismal
  affair, culminating in the reading of the notices in the morning papers. He
  had read them himself at the breakfast-table, and they had scarcely surprised
  him, except by the extent to which some confirmed his own personal yet
  hesitant opinions.</p>

  <p>She said, sinking into a chair: "Well, Austen, there's one consolation
  &mdash;now the bad news is out, we can all relax."</p>

  <p>"How long do you think it will run?"</p>

  <p>"After those notices? A week... maybe."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity... all that effort... time... hopes..."</p>

  <p>"To say nothing of money. Fortunately it wasn't mine... Oh, dear, why did
  we all kid each other? If only someone had had the guts to say&mdash;'Look,
  this is junk&mdash;what are we going ahead with it for?' Nobody really
  believed in the thing from the start&mdash;_I_ didn't&mdash;I don't think you
  did, either, after that rehearsal. But you were too polite&mdash;or else you
  didn't want to be the wet blanket. It's incredible&mdash;the way we all
  sleep-walked into it&mdash;why didn't somebody wake up?"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't YOU wake up, Carey?"</p>

  <p>"That's a fair question. I suppose the truth is that once rehearsals begin
  it's always a question of jobs&mdash;you don't like to do anything that
  throws people out of work, especially these days. And the author had written
  hits before&mdash;he kept saying this would be another. Maybe he believed
  it... you never can go by what an author thinks of his own work, Paul always
  says."</p>

  <p>"Do you think with Paul as director it could have been a success?"</p>

  <p>"He'd have got far more out of me and everyone else, that's certain. And
  the play isn't so much worse than others that have been hits... And yet I'm
  doubtful. Somehow I've an idea Paul's neatest trick would have come when he'd
  first read the script&mdash;he'd have said No. And then he'd have telephoned
  the author. Believe me, that was something to listen to&mdash; Paul saying no
  to an author."</p>

  <p>"You mean he was brutal?"</p>

  <p>"Usually he was charming, and especially on the telephone. He would talk
  one way and look at me another. He didn't really LIKE authors, but he knew
  they were a bit necessary in the theatre business."</p>

  <p>"It would have saved him trouble if he'd written plays himself."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he tried, but he used to say it cramped him to think theatrically
  in terms of mere words. Isn't that a beautiful way to admit there was
  something he couldn't do?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, and her cheeks were flushed; she did not look as if the fate
  of the play were distressing her much. But perhaps it was something else, for
  he had often noticed that when she talked about Paul and especially when she
  reminisced about him, she could launch herself into an almost hilarious mood,
  as if he were still a core of pleasantry, if not of pleasure, in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>She said, sighing: "Oh, what a cool calm house this is, Austen... It's
  such a relief to be here."</p>

  <p>"I always hoped you'd find it that. What are you going to do when the play
  closes?"</p>

  <p>"Look for another, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't do you any harm to take a rest."</p>

  <p>"Sure, it would be fun to be unemployed if I didn't have to earn a
  living."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to worry about earning one immediately."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I'm not quite on the rocks. And perhaps Paul's film will make a
  fortune." Then she evidently recollected the facts and added, with some
  embarrassment: "A fortune for you and success for him&mdash;that'll be all
  fair and square." She seemed still more embarrassed at that, as if the joke
  had made it worse instead of better. "By the way, when are we going to see
  it? You said you were having a print shipped over."</p>

  <p>Expecting her to be unhappy about the play, he had planned to postpone
  giving her the latest news about Paul, but now he thought he might as well.
  He said: "I'm afraid there may be some delay."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Why?"</p>

  <p>"Paul... it seems... isn't pleased with me for having intervened&mdash; as
  I thought&mdash;on his behalf."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from that last letter he wrote me, which was weeks ago. The
  Hidden Hand of Wall Street, Art versus Dollars&mdash;it had some ringing
  phrases... Anything happened since?"</p>

  <p>"He evidently likes litigation."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

  <p>"He's already changed his lawyer and started suit against me."</p>

  <p>"Against YOU? What on earth for?"</p>

  <p>"He disputes my title to the property."</p>

  <p>"You mean the film? But CAN he?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally he can dispute anything he likes, but an honest lawyer would
  tell him when it's no use. Apparently his original lawyer WAS honest, so he
  had to find another."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, I'm so very sorry."</p>

  <p>"Carey, it isn't YOUR fault."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't apologizing. Sorry can mean&mdash;sorrow... can't it? That's
  what I feel."</p>

  <p>And suddenly she looked it. He sat on the arm of her chair and tried to
  comfort her. She soon controlled herself and pressed his hand. "Oh, Austen,
  don't worry about me. There's nothing you can do."</p>

  <p>"Carey, I know your trouble. I think I've known it ever since I met you on
  the boat. Or part of it. Carey... may I be very frank&mdash;even at the risk
  of putting my nose in where I shouldn't? You're a success, that goes without
  saying&mdash;-one flop does nothing to disprove it&mdash;and I've admired you
  on the stage just as thousands of others have... but since I've got to know
  you personally I've admired you... so much more... in other ways... that...
  that... please remember this is none of my business unless you wish it to
  be... I've wondered... lately... is it ENOUGH for you? Do you have a sense of
  vocation that makes everything worth while? You're so happy at the
  farm&mdash;doing simple things&mdash;talking to Norris, having a quiet
  time... you somehow don't fit in with all the scurry and bustle of stage
  life."</p>

  <p>"I wonder."</p>

  <p>"Of course you're the first actress I've ever known, I admit that."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and this is the first play you've ever been on the inside of,
  isn't it? That's a pity, because it really was exceptional. Most plays have a
  chance&mdash;or at least you genuinely think they have&mdash;you wait for the
  opening night like judgment day, but not like the electric chair. From the
  first reading to last night's fiasco the prisoner marched confidently from
  the condemned cell to the death house... I've never known anything quite like
  that before. So please don't generalize from your one play&mdash;or from your
  one actress."</p>

  <p>"I wish my one actress would take a long vacation&mdash;a year at least to
  rid herself of all kinds of trouble."</p>

  <p>"ALL kinds?"</p>

  <p>"It ought to be possible, if you let yourself face the future
  realistically."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad we've stopped talking of me as HERSELF." She began to laugh.
  "Like an Abbey play... And what kind of future do you think&mdash;
  realistically&mdash;I have to face?"</p>

  <p>He said tensely: "That's a straight question, but I can't answer it
  without talking about Paul."</p>

  <p>"Oh, talk about him, I don't mind. _I_ talk about him to you."</p>

  <p>"Carey... do you really love him?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you I don't MISS him&mdash;except his better judgment in saying
  no."</p>

  <p>"So you're not really upset by the delay in his return?"</p>

  <p>"I'm upset by the mess he seems to be getting himself into over
  there."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but if a cable came now that he was arriving in New York
  tonight&mdash;how would you feel?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my goodness&mdash;HORRIBLE&mdash;because I'd hate him to see the
  play."</p>

  <p>"But apart from that?"</p>

  <p>"It's very hard for me to think of Paul apart from plays."</p>

  <p>"That's been your life together&mdash;principally?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you could say so. Principally. Except for a short time
  &mdash;at first."</p>

  <p>"Then we're back to what I said before. It isn't enough. You've gone
  without a great deal."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sure I have."</p>

  <p>"You ought to have had children of your own."</p>

  <p>"I don't know whose fault that was&mdash;Paul's or mine."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him an answer to a question he wouldn't have presumed to ask.
  He went on, after a silence: "Carey, it all boils down to this... how long
  are you willing to endure a situation that can't make you really happy
  &mdash;your nature being what it is?"</p>

  <p>"Is there an alternative?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>She said, almost flippantly: "Oh, you mean divorce him? Sure, I could do
  that&mdash;he's probably been unfaithful with somebody or other... but what
  exactly would be the point?"</p>

  <p>In a single sentence she had blunted the weapon he had furbished for some
  possible use at a clinching moment. He knew now it would be anti-climax to
  give her certain facts about Paul; worse than anti-climax, it would recoil
  ignominiously on himself. He was devoutly thankful he had made good taste the
  better part of wisdom.</p>

  <p>He said simply: "The point, Carey, is that I'd want to marry you if you
  were free."</p>

  <p>She looked up with interest rather than surprise or enthusiasm, then
  exclaimed, still flippantly: "You WOULD, Austen? Why, you've never even made
  love to me!"</p>

  <p>"That isn't because I..."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know, you've been so careful not to spoil things&mdash;I'm sure
  that's how you've thought of it, and that's why it's so funny when you talk
  about my nature being what it is. You just don't know my nature."</p>

  <p>"You think I don't?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you don't. Or else you do, and you've been a bit afraid of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Carey..." He took her into his arms, yet amidst his joy, the overwhelming
  joy of finding himself not rebuffed, he was aware of her laughter limiting as
  well as inviting him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Austen... you're very sweet not to have understood me for so long.
  That's why I'm laughing, not because I'm not just as serious as you are."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The play came off after four nights, and Austen was sheerly
delighted. Now
  that he had entered on this new relationship with Carey, everything else was
  in order; he was happy again, after an interval of years which, in
  retrospect, seemed like a tunnel from which he had just emerged. He had had
  affairs during that period, not very many, but they had all been rigidly
  circumscribed, if not furtive, and never had any of them led him to the most
  abstract contemplation of marriage. But now, with Carey, the fulfilment of a
  desire reinforced the ambition he had had (he could now realize) from the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>They went to the farm and found all the familiar things doubly enjoyable
  in a new emotional context&mdash;the walks and rides, the pottering about,
  the first fires of autumn, a long day's drive to the Catskills to catch the
  trees in deepest crimson. One brief conversation, at a moment when both were
  in a mood for practicality, had settled the future as far ahead as could be;
  it was understood that she would ask Paul for a divorce. Austen did not
  verify if and when she had done so, and not till a month had passed did he
  bring up the matter at all. She said then that she had written, but that Paul
  had not replied. It was like him, of course, not to write for long periods
  &mdash;or perhaps, if he were on a trip somewhere, he might not yet have
  received her letter. She said she would write again, and Austen wondered,
  preoccupyingly but not urgently, why she had not thought to do that
  already.</p>

  <p>Nor did they ever discuss whether she would retire permanently from the
  stage or merely take a long vacation. Austen sensed how unwise it would be to
  mix this question with the so much more important one of their lives
  together; if he could make her happy with him, he felt fairly sure she would
  have a strong impulse, not so much to surrender a career, as to cling to the
  kind of life which a career would prohibit. He was always ready to barter the
  shadow of intention for the substance of likelihood. Out of her very
  happiness he aimed to build a defence against whatever lure the stage could
  exert; he would make her life comfortable but not placid, exciting enough yet
  without strain. He not only loved her, but was a connoisseur of qualities he
  had found in her, and this gave his love an aspect of guardianship.</p>

  <p>As for his feeling for Paul, it was hard for him to make up a cool mind,
  since he so much resented the harm he believed Paul to have done. Yet because
  Carey usually seemed amused when she talked about Paul, he knew he must never
  invite her to share his serious condemnation; he must pretend that he too
  thought Paul a forgivable genius, whom one could no more enchain by marriage
  than escape from by divorce. For she had said to him reflectively when they
  had first discussed the future: "I don't quite know what Paul and I had in
  common&mdash;it certainly didn't make a marriage." He had heard that with
  joy, especially the past tense of it. But then she had continued, less
  happily for him: "So what it did make, if anything, perhaps a divorce can't
  take away." He had quelled his mind's retort that he hoped Paul and all Paul
  meant to her would be taken away, eventually and finally, not only by legal
  instrument but by the passage of time and the growth of compensating
  joys.</p>

  <p>She kept up her visits to Paul's mother, and he did not suggest that she
  make any change in this. He asked her once if Paul and his mother still
  corresponded regularly and she said yes, just as usual, once a week, like
  clockwork and about as interestingly, if one judged from the excerpts that
  Mrs. Saffron read aloud when she visited her.</p>

  <p>"It seems to prove, though, that he must have received both your recent
  letters, so that if he doesn't reply to them it's only because he doesn't
  choose to."</p>

  <p>"Yes, probably."</p>

  <p>A few weeks later came Thanksgiving, the second since Paul had left
  America. The previous year she had visited Mrs. Saffron, but had found her in
  such large company, all eager to finish dinner and play pinochle, that she
  almost wondered if the old lady had invited her just to demonstrate how
  little need she had of filial duty. This year Carey saw no reason to repeat
  the experience, apart from her own desire to spend the day with Austen, but
  she thought it polite to announce the change in advance and as tactfully as
  possible. She came to Austen's house direct from this encounter, and her
  face, flushed and a little agitated, told him at once that something had
  happened. He took her into the library and knew better than to start a
  cross-examination.</p>

  <p>She sat by the fire and drank a glass of sherry before ceasing to chatter
  about unimportant things. His house seemed to give her calmness whenever she
  needed it. Then she exclaimed: "Oh, what a terrifying person, Austen! No
  wonder Paul always capered with her. CAPERED, yes. I can see now he had to do
  SOMETHING in self-defence."</p>

  <p>Austen poured a drink for himself and threw a log on the fire. "Does she
  mind if you don't eat with her on Thursday?" he asked with deliberate
  matter-of-factness.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, that's all right. She's the centre of a sort of salon&mdash;she
  won't be alone. But we got on to much more dangerous topics than
  Thanksgiving... She's INCREDIBLE, Austen. She's been writing to Paul about us
  for weeks."</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>"Writing to him... all the time..."</p>

  <p>"You'd better tell me how all this cropped up."</p>

  <p>"Yes... quite a scene it was, believe me. I've never pretended I didn't
  know you, but since she didn't mention you to me till today, I never did to
  her... yet all the time, it seems, she's been gathering information&mdash;
  gossip, I suppose&mdash;and sending it on to Paul. In fact they've been
  having a long correspondence together&mdash;about you&mdash;and me. She knew,
  for instance, that I'd asked Paul to give me a divorce."</p>

  <p>He said, in a clipped voice that was a further attempt to suppress his own
  tensions: "Does she know whether he will?"</p>

  <p>"She hates me, so she's in favour of it... but she wants Paul to bring the
  suit himself and she'd like him to make all kinds of accusations. Involving
  you, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Except for your sake, Carey, I wouldn't give a damn. But never mind what
  SHE wants&mdash;what's he going to DO?&mdash;that's the issue."</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing?... NOTHING?... How can anyone do nothing?" He added, taking her
  hand: "I'm sorry, I really must keep my temper."</p>

  <p>She nodded in sympathy. "I know. Paul always had the most subtle ways of
  being a nuisance."</p>

  <p>"It's not subtle and I'd call it worse than a nuisance."</p>

  <p>She did not reply to that, and after a silence he continued: "So he just
  won't give an answer at all... is that what it amounts to?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's been quite frank in a letter to his mother. He says I can go
  through any legal procedure I want, but HE won't do anything. He won't
  contest it, or agree to it, or acknowledge it, or discuss it with me or
  anyone else&mdash;he won't accept or sign any papers or answer letters
  &mdash;he simply won't make a move of any kind." She began to smile and there
  came from her a sound that was amazingly like a giggle, but her face had lost
  its flush and was now very pale. She was clearly under a strain perhaps as
  great as his own.</p>

  <p>He said, in a level voice: "Well, I think we can handle all that if we put
  it in the right hands. The main point is that he won't contest&mdash;unless
  he changes his mind."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think he'll do that, from the mood he's in... He's different
  from his mother, although in so many ways she's made him what he is. He
  turned down flat her idea of accusing me... of us... of anything. I saw the
  letter. I was surprised at the tone of it&mdash;I don't believe he ever
  squashed her quite so utterly before. He doesn't really want to harm
  people."</p>

  <p>"Carey, he couldn't harm US if he tried. Take my word that he couldn't
  &mdash;he's in no position to&mdash;he's... oh well, so long as you realize
  that, let's not argue. It's something, of course, that he isn't as vindictive
  as his mother, but I don't think I'll express any gratitude. I'm not one of
  those disappointed authors whom he makes a specialty of charming."</p>

  <p>He would have regretted and apologized for the sarcasm had he not seen her
  smiling again, in the way that hurt him immeasurably, yet which he did not
  dare comment on, much less rebuke her for. She said: "I'd like to see him
  TRYING to charm you, though,"&mdash;and then continued, as if eased by the
  thought: "She showed me the letter. She was so angry I don't think she
  realized that some of it was what she wouldn't have liked me to know. I mean,
  the part where Paul told her off... I didn't think he was capable of it...
  Imagine, though, she'd been storing all this up for weeks&mdash;never a word
  about it all the times I've been meeting her... till today."</p>

  <p>He could well imagine it, being schooled in such reticences himself, but
  he answered: "Put the whole thing out of your mind, Carey, if you can. It's
  just a lawyer's problem from now on. So long as we both get what we want in
  the end, and we know what that is, the details aren't of any
  consequence."</p>

  <p>"But some of them are so funny, Austen&mdash;such as when he said in the
  letter that every true Catholic would applaud his attitude. Actually, yes
  &mdash;these were his words! He isn't a Catholic, and nor is she, and it's
  due to him, probably, that I'm not much of one myself, any more&mdash;yet he
  can talk about every true Catholic applauding him! You'd think he was leading
  the Counter-Reformation or something! Just how important does he think he and
  his attitudes are?"</p>

  <p>Even though the mockery was against Paul, and quite scathing, he could not
  share the spirit of it, because there was nothing in what he knew of Paul to
  impel him to any kind of laughter. He said, bringing her back to seriousness:
  "Well, after what happened this afternoon, you certainly won't want to see
  his mother again."</p>

  <p>"Probably not. I'm not good at having rows&mdash;they upset me. That's why
  I'm a bit upset now."</p>

  <p>"I understand that, Carey. I hate rows too. I never want to see again a
  person I've quarrelled with."</p>

  <p>"And I hate to quarrel with anyone I hope to see again. Is that the same
  thing?"</p>

  <p>He took some satisfaction from thinking it might be. At any rate, the old
  routines of her life were breaking up, and, as he planned it, the new ones
  under his guidance would presently take possession.</p>

  <p>The next day he had a long interview with his lawyers, as a result of
  which Carey visited another lawyer recommended by them. Austen was anxious
  that she should have as little as possible to do with the actual machinery of
  the suit, that she should not even know the state of its progress, beyond
  what was necessary; and for this reason he rarely referred to it during the
  weeks that followed, though he himself was kept informed of every detail. His
  lawyers had served him for years and he trusted them enough to be perfectly
  frank about his own interest in the case; he told them also of the somewhat
  peculiar attitude to be expected from the husband. Doubtless they passed this
  on to Carey's lawyer, whom Austen was careful not to meet or have any direct
  dealings with. He was all for employing that discretion which was the better
  part, not only of valour, but of getting his own way. Nor had he been
  completely candid with Carey in saying he would be indifferent to any
  accusations made against him, nor was it true that Paul had no power to harm
  by smearing. The power to do this, as he well knew, is conferred by the
  person whose position is high enough to be smearable, and though ordinary
  scandal could not affect him professionally he was personally sensitive to it
  and had an almost pathological distaste for publicity. All these things were
  much on his mind, while he never spoke of them.</p>

  <p>Christmas and New Year passed with nothing accomplished. Letters to Paul
  from Carey's lawyer were not only unanswered but presently came back as
  undeliverable, which seemed to indicate that Paul had changed his address and
  might well succeed in hiding himself if he were so determined. In the
  meantime he had apparently dropped the suit about the film&mdash;perhaps to
  facilitate his evasion of the larger issue. As week after week went by with
  no sign of escape from the impasse, Austen caught himself yielding to the
  beginnings of obsession; he resented Paul not only on account of Carey, but
  because he felt they were at hostile poles in their entire techniques of
  thought and action. Although he was relieved that Paul had refused to bring
  counter-charges, he would have disliked him for them no more than for this
  nonsensical and exasperating obstructionism&mdash;so baffling because it was
  in essence so childish. Perhaps he disliked him most of all because he could
  not understand him&mdash;he could not understand why, if Paul wanted Carey,
  he did not return and seek to reclaim her; or why, if he did not want her, he
  would not gladly unload his responsibility on a successor. There seemed no
  logic in the man, not even the logic of unregeneracy.</p>

  <p>And all this while, during the interval of wasted time, Austen's relations
  with Carey were in some danger of languishing. Knowing more of the
  complications than she did, his were doubtless the greater restraints, yet
  she too had her own, and it was an extra anxiety that he could not always
  discern them. That she was happy with him he was confident, but he wished he
  could see into her mind and heart about Paul, yet he knew better than to ask,
  or even to mention Paul's name. He had the feeling once or twice that the
  pending case had disappeared from her thoughts, which was almost too much
  what he had wished for; and when papers had to be signed she did so with such
  little apparent interest that he remembered a remark of hers about the play
  fiasco&mdash;that she had sleep-walked into it. He hoped she was not
  sleep-walking into marriage with him, though even if she were, he would still
  want her.</p>

  <p>The only thing she asked about fairly often was the Everyman picture, and
  there was nothing more to tell for the reason that though Paul was no longer
  claiming ownership, the actual physical film had so far been impossible to
  locate. Here, too, was bafflement that made Austen feel not so much defeated
  by an adversary as scorned by a child who thumbs his nose from a safe
  distance. He wanted a print of that film as part of the establishment of
  adult discipline, though if it should arrive he had decided to conceal the
  fact from Carey. Whether it was good or bad (or perhaps especially if it were
  good), he did not wish her to see it yet; as a product of Paul's mind he was
  afraid of it.</p>

  <p>Towards spring the print still had not come, but he was no longer baffled,
  merely determined. For he had sized up Paul's outlandish weapons, and had
  devised counter-weapons of his own; one of them was guile. In this new mood
  (not really so new, for guile was part of his professional equipment), he
  made a fresh approach to the major problem. Hitherto Nevada had been thought
  of as the place to bring suit, but now, in face of Paul's continued
  inaccessibility, Mexico came under consideration. A divorce there would be
  more dubious legally, but there were procedures in certain of the Mexican
  states by which Paul's tactics could be circumvented if it could be shown,
  evidentially, that he had expressed an intention not to contest the case. And
  he had&mdash;though only in that letter to his mother which Carey had
  seen.</p>

  <p>Thus, at the extreme of the dilemma, Austen found himself acting in a way
  so contrary to what he would have said were all his normal principles that he
  could only conclude that his affection for Carey amounted to sheer
  self-abandonment. He was startled to discover this, for he had not suspected
  himself capable of it; and perhaps he was secretly gratified, for to a man of
  his age a grand passion is a renewal of youth. He had loved Fran very deeply,
  but never to such a point, unless it was merely that he had won her against
  fewer obstacles and had thus escaped the test. Like all men who govern
  themselves austerely he was shocked to think he was in the throes of any
  desire that he could not control, and ashamed to employ the ruthlessness
  which a weaker man would have enjoyed. Yet here again he was secretly
  excited; it was a new thing in his life at a time when most things were
  already getting to be old. Actually his self-knowledge did not go far enough
  to see the whole thing in perspective&mdash;to realize that the average
  routine of his daily business was just as ruthless as his behaviour now in a
  different field, and that most of his desires were uncontrollable in the
  sense that if he wanted something enough there were few plans he would not
  put into operation to get it. His shock and shame, therefore, were in the
  nature of sentimental luxuries&mdash;or at most, the fastidiousness of a man
  who normally does unpleasant things at such long range that he escapes all
  personal contact with the event.</p>

  <p>There came a day when he called at his lawyers' office and was told that
  certain information he had asked for could now be furnished.</p>

  <p>"But you understand, Mr. Bond, that's as far as we can go. We've no idea
  what kind of organization these people have&mdash;we certainly do NOT
  guarantee or recommend them in any way. The whole thing is really far outside
  our province."</p>

  <p>"I know all that. And if they do what I want it won't be a testimonial to
  their respectability&mdash;I know that too. I hate this sort of thing, but I
  can't see an alternative."</p>

  <p>"Then be sure you take precautions. There's always a chance of blackmail,
  especially if they find out who's paying them."</p>

  <p>"They won't. Dunne will arrange everything, and for cash. He's
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"So long as you realize there's a risk."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's much, but what there is I'll have to take."</p>

  <p>A week or so afterwards, Dunne returned to the house late in the evening
  after a day filled with Oppenheimerish detail, for he had used a variety of
  subways uptown and downtown, and had taken several taxis in confusing
  directions. Entering the library with a tray, he approached Austen in a
  manner so carefully customary that he was obviously relishing the drama of
  the occasion. Austen had been dozing in a chair and woke to stare sharply,
  then exclaimed: "You're back, then?... What happened?"</p>

  <p>"It's here, sir. In this envelope."</p>

  <p>"WHAT?... You've got it? ALREADY?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. And I paid them. They didn't try to welsh on a bargain either."</p>

  <p>Austen stared at the envelope, controlling his excitement. "Did they tell
  you how they managed it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask for details. After all, you couldn't expect them to reveal
  their methods."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. I was just curious."</p>

  <p>"I got the impression, though, that they used the daily maid, and they did
  say it was stuffed away in a drawer with a lot of other letters. So it may
  not be missed, and if it is the old lady may think she lost it."</p>

  <p>"Fine... So there was no hitch of any kind?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently not. They're reliable people, I should guess, in their
  way."</p>

  <p>"But WHAT a way!"</p>

  <p>Now that he knew the thing was in his possession he had no eagerness to
  inspect it. He did not open the envelope till some time after Dunne had gone;
  then he read the letter once before mailing it special delivery to his
  lawyers. Photostatted, it might do the trick, but he could not forgive Paul
  for having made all this necessary. Again, it was his blind spot; he did not
  realize that the daily tricks of his trade were so similar in degree that
  their difference in kind was not fundamental.</p>

  <p>Two months later Carey obtained a decree of divorce, and the next day, in
  the same Mexican state, she married Austen. She did not know the devious
  means by which Paul had been held to be a consenting party or the high cost
  of deviousness in fees to all the deviators, and as the documents were in
  Spanish, there was not much likelihood of her finding out. Publicity, too,
  was at a minimum, for the story did not leak till it was already stale, and
  the news item as reported lacked sensation. The pair stayed in Mexico for
  several weeks, then took an extended motor trip in New Mexico and Arizona.
  They were in Santa Fe when Austen received news from his German lawyers that
  Paul was showing Everyman in Berlin, and what should they do about it? He
  cabled them to take no action, but to send him news of what the film was
  like, how it had been received, and so on. And in the meantime he still said
  nothing about it to Carey.</p>

  <p>Not till they were back at the farm in July did he decide to mention it,
  partly because for some time she had not asked, and he thought her silence
  might have been deliberately aimed to please him at a cost to herself. He
  said one morning when the mail arrived: "Oh, by the way, here are some
  clippings from Berlin papers about the Everyman film. You know German? Quite
  good notices on the whole."</p>

  <p>She must have translated them somehow or other, because at lunch the same
  day she said: "The critics call it wonderful, Austen&mdash;I'm so happy for
  Paul's sake. When can we see it over here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly. I must find out what the situation is."</p>

  <p>The situation was clear enough, had he made it so, but he was content to
  let it acquire and remain in obscurity, with the result that Everyman never
  reached America and was hardly seen at all outside Germany. It was not a
  commercial success even there. For some reason, also, fewer prints than usual
  had been made, and several were destroyed in a fire. Soon the film entered
  the category of those that are far more talked about by connoisseurs than
  seen by the public, and in due course it became somewhat legendary, like the
  reputation of its maker.</p>

  <h2><a name="part4"
     id="part4">PART FOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In 1936 Norris was fourteen, a shy sensitive boy, hard to
  make friends with. He was so far advanced in some of his studies (English and
  history, for instance) and so backward in others (mathematics and French)
  that teachers held widely different opinions of him, especially as he did not
  care for organized games and would not even pretend to. He was physically
  delicate, yet fond of long walks and uncompetitive outdoor exercise; in a
  quiet way his personality was effective, and at school he was never bullied
  though quite often bored. He adored Carey, whom he treated as he might have
  an elder sister, certainly not as he would have his mother, had she lived.
  Carey had been promising for years to take him on a vacation trip to Ireland,
  and at last, during this summer, the chance came, made easier because it
  could be fitted in with business visits that Austen had to make to various
  European capitals. Dublin was not one of them, so it was arranged that Carey
  and Norris should join him in London before returning to America.</p>

  <p>Carey was thirty-one and something seemed to have happened to make her
  beautiful. She had never quite deserved this adjective during childhood or
  girlhood, but now there was a special ripeness about her that was conspicuous
  even in the company of other beautiful women; it was this that attracted
  artists, and several had done portraits of her that had been widely
  exhibited. Her marriage with Austen had been a happy one; they got along
  well, enjoying the domestic tranquillity that both valued so much and that
  made each of them precious to the other because they knew how shared and
  contributory it was. Austen was in his fifties, not much older in looks than
  when Carey had seen him first, but increasingly busy in a field which, amidst
  depression and the collapse of currencies, had become increasingly mysterious
  if not sinister. He remained unknown to the man in the street, though his
  marriage to Carey had made him slightly more newsworthy to gossip columnists
  had there been anything in his life to gossip about. There never was.</p>

  <p>Carey and Norris left the ship at Cobh, while Austen went on to
  Southampton. She was looking forward to her first revisiting of Ireland since
  she had left it fourteen years before, but most of all she wanted to show
  Norris the country as if it were a gift to him from herself. They stayed in
  Cork for a night, rented a car the next day, and set out on the westward road
  through Bandon. Norris drove. Probably he was not supposed to at his age, but
  he was an excellent driver and tall enough not to be questioned. She relaxed
  in the small two-seater and watched the boy's eager profile against the green
  background of Irish hills. Though he was not her real son, the experience
  came near to a fulfilment so profound that her eyes were proud, yet she did
  not know whether it was her pride in the country as seen by the boy, or in
  the boy as seen by the country. Because people did stare at Norris, or so it
  seemed to her, for she was never fully aware of how often they were staring
  at herself, or at the remarkably handsome pair of them. Norris, as he drove
  along the winding lanes, looked radiant. It was the first time they had ever
  faced a long spell together without Austen, and she knew he was happier now
  than if Austen had been with them.</p>

  <p>They reached Glengarriff by evening and stayed at a hotel perched somewhat
  inland on a hill, with a view of the harbour over waterside woods. It was an
  old-fashioned place where the food was excellent, and where, in the absence
  of gas or electricity, oil lamps swung yellow beams into the shadows and
  guests carried lighted candles upstairs to their high-ceilinged bedrooms. All
  of this was the exact opposite, Norris said, of those places on the Boston
  Post Road where things are done by candlelight because the proprietor
  considers it part of the atmosphere he charges extra for. Norris had the wit
  to express a thought of this kind, and Carey was delighted because it seemed
  to her a sign that he would accept Ireland without too much regard for
  plumbing on the one hand or shamrock on the other. She knew how hard it was
  for Americans abroad to be neither condemnatory nor sentimental.</p>

  <p>The next day they drove through Kenmare to Killarney, where the hotel was
  less primitive&mdash;indeed, in a forlorn and stupefying way, rather grand.
  Norris diagnosed Killarney as the kind of show place that every country
  needs, since it concentrates in one spot all the nave elements in tourism,
  thus preserving other places equally and sometimes more beautiful. This
  verdict, Carey thought, was too cynical; but after all, he was at an age when
  cleverness runs to that and when the deliberately unromantic view-point
  almost achieves a romanticism of its own. In an earlier generation (hers, by
  a slight stretch of arithmetic) he would have been influenced by Shaw and
  Mencken; as it was, he gyrated amidst a vague flotsam of assorted
  disillusionments about war, peace, government, capitalism, religion, and sex
  &mdash;all of which created in him a personal attitude not more than skin
  deep. One of the troubles that Austen gave himself needlessly (and which made
  it harder for him to get to know the boy) was that he took at its face value
  so much that Norris said when he was merely flexing his mental muscles to
  satisfy an exhibitionist whim of the moment. Carey, as an actress, understood
  this intuitively.</p>

  <p>"It isn't what he says," Austen had complained once, "it's his whole
  outlook. He seems to have no faith in anything. Even if certain beliefs are
  questionable, one shouldn't lose them till later on in life."</p>

  <p>"Austen, I think that's far more cynical than anything Norris has ever
  said."</p>

  <p>Austen had tried to understand what she meant by that. But he remained (to
  his distress) incapable of coming to intimate terms with Norris, and the
  greater his effort the more intractable yet polite grew the barrier between
  them.</p>

  <p>Norris had once asked her glibly: "What does father do all day to make him
  so serious in the evenings?"</p>

  <p>Carey had answered: "What do YOU do all day to make you bait him so much
  when he comes home tired after his work? You seem to store up sharp things to
  say, and if he takes them all seriously maybe that's because he doesn't think
  they're funny."</p>

  <p>But now, in Ireland, clouds such as this had lifted and it was clear that,
  without Austen, Norris was a less combative though still disputatious
  personality. They drove on through Limerick and Nenagh to Dublin, detouring
  on the way through the place in Kildare where she had lived until she was ten
  years old. The house was unchanged, but the farmland looked better
  cultivated, and in the neighbouring town there were modern stores and neon
  signs. Approaching Dublin she noted much development&mdash;streets of new
  houses that might have been on Long Island or outside London&mdash;"the
  sprawling anonymity of the suburbs", Norris called it, pleased with his
  phrase, and Carey thought it good too, though not quite valid, for the
  brownstone houses that made up so much of metropolitan New York, or the
  Regency streets of Limerick, were in their own ways just as anonymous. And
  come to think of it, anonymity was honest, and if there could be anything
  more depressing than a row of identical suburban villas, surely it was one of
  those streets in which the builder makes each unit deliberately different
  from its neighbour. She chattered on these lines to Norris, and they were
  still arguing about it when they arrived at the Shelbourne. Then followed a
  week of sightseeing&mdash;art galleries, churches, the Zoo in Phoenix Park,
  and a long excursion to Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains. But here again
  Glendalough, a show place, did not appeal so strongly to Norris as
  Glenmalure, the lonely dead-end from which the mountains rise steeply to the
  peak of Lugnaquilla. By a coincidence they went that same evening to the
  Abbey Theatre where Synge's The Shadow of the Glen was in the bill. Norris
  was much taken with it. He had been to the theatre often in New York and had
  even seen the Abbey Players there during one of their tours, but the Dublin
  performance made him conscious of something in a different dimension. He
  tried to explain this to Carey, who was herself warmed by memories that came
  to her not only of the play but of the physical stage, the red seats, the
  black-and-gold striped curtain, and the tricky Dublin audience. She had told
  him, of course, that this was where she had made her first professional
  appearance, and he naturally put questions, all of which she answered as
  truthfully as she could till he asked: "What made you leave Ireland and come
  to America?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story, Norris&mdash;too long to tell during a theatre
  interval."</p>

  <p>"You were married in Dublin, weren't you, to your first husband?"</p>

  <p>"No, not in Dublin&mdash;in London."</p>

  <p>"You don't mind talking about him, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not." After all, it was Austen who would not talk about him any
  more, who had doubtless never told Norris of his existence, though it was
  clearly impossible to keep the boy always in ignorance of such a plain
  fact.</p>

  <p>"Is he alive?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. We were divorced."</p>

  <p>"I knew that. Dunne told me. But that's about all I do know. What sort of
  a person was he?"</p>

  <p>She smiled, sampling the enormity of the question. Then she said, with far
  greater ease than she could have anticipated: "He was... IS, I mean... a very
  clever man... quite brilliant. He directed plays&mdash;I believe that's what
  he's still doing. That and motion pictures."</p>

  <p>Norris pricked up his ears, for he was a patron of the screen far more
  consistently than of the stage. "What's his name?"</p>

  <p>"Paul Saffron." She saw no reason not to tell him, but more pressingly she
  could not think of any sensible way to evade the question. Yet she knew it
  would have displeased Austen.</p>

  <p>"PAUL SAFFRON?... Oh, you mean those German pictures&mdash;Ohne die
  Wahrheit and Donnergepolter... Wonderful!... I saw them at a little theatre
  on Ninety-Fifth Street&mdash;there weren't even any English titles dubbed in,
  but you could understand without knowing the language."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you'd ever seen them, Norris. You never mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"It was last Easter, just before you and father came back from Florida.
  I'm glad now I didn't happen to mention it."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"Well, father wouldn't have liked it, I'm certain."</p>

  <p>Had he gained THAT impression from Dunne? Or by intuition? She was
  relieved when the curtain rose on the second item of the one-acter programme
  &mdash;Lady Gregory's Workhouse Ward, an old favourite and so ineluctably
  Irish that it could hardly survive a journey across the Channel, much less
  the Atlantic. Norris seemed to enjoy it to the full, but at the next interval
  he plunged immediately into a renewal of the earlier conversation. "Carey...
  where does Paul Saffron live?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly. On the Continent somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Is he foreign? Is it Saffron?" He gave the word a French
  pronunciation.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;American. He was born in America."</p>

  <p>"I'd certainly like to meet him some day."</p>

  <p>To hear him say that gave her a shock which only in retrospect she found
  tantalizingly pleasant. She said: "You might, possibly, if you travel abroad
  later on, though I'd have to warn you against him." And then, realizing how
  he might misunderstand unless she said more, she continued hastily: "I mean
  &mdash;he'd probably be rude to you if you didn't have any particular reason
  to see him."</p>

  <p>"But if I said you were married to my father, wouldn't that be a
  reason?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my goodness, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You think he'd be mad at ME? After all, I couldn't help it even if you
  WERE my mother&mdash;and you're not." He went on, thoughtfully: "I'll bet
  he'd be interested in me on account of you... What broke up your marriage
  with him?"</p>

  <p>Carey felt herself flushing deeply; this was going too far, no matter how
  preordained it was that he must eventually explore and chart the situation.
  She contrived a laugh as she said: "I can't discuss it, Norris. I'm
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"You think I oughtn't to know things like that till I'm older?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe&mdash;and if you WERE older you wouldn't ask. Now please let's talk
  of something else."</p>

  <p>"Sure. I didn't mean to upset you."</p>

  <p>"I'm not upset at all, darling, but you mustn't ask any more personal
  questions of that kind."</p>

  <p>As if to signify acceptance of her taboo he changed the subject abruptly
  by saying: "It's odd, isn't it, that I've never seen you act. Were you very
  good at it?"</p>

  <p>"What?" She hadn't been listening.</p>

  <p>He repeated the question, adding: "Is THAT too personal, too?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. It's just hard to answer except by a plain no. I wasn't VERY
  good... that is, I wasn't a Bernhardt or a Duse. But I must have been FAIRLY
  good, or I wouldn't have been able to take leading parts on Broadway."</p>

  <p>"With your name in electric lights?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes."</p>

  <p>Clearly he was impressed by that. He mused after a pause: "I've often
  wondered if people like them&mdash;Bernhardt and Duse&mdash;would disappoint
  us if we could see them today. There's no way of knowing, exactly, is there?
  It's different with an old film&mdash;you can make allowances if the print's
  worn or the style's out of date&mdash;the acting still comes through. But
  great stage actors&mdash;after they're dead, how CAN you tell what they were
  like?"</p>

  <p>"It's true we can't judge them ourselves, Norris, but we can read what
  people thought at the time&mdash;critics and others who wrote about them. We
  know from all that how good they must have been."</p>

  <p>"Just as YOU must have been."</p>

  <p>"Except that I was never in their class at all. And I'm not dead yet
  either."</p>

  <p>"It's the same kind of argument, though. Circumstantial evidence... I
  still wish I'd seen you, Carey."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Maybe you will, one of these days. We'll get up a play some
  week-end at the farm. The Rushmores would love it, I know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, amateurs," he said, not contemptuously, but with the most crushing
  disinterest. She did not wish to approve such an attitude, yet she could not
  bring herself to dispute it. She was relieved again when the curtain rose on
  the third and final item. It did not hold her, perhaps because it was a
  recently written playlet that evoked no memories&mdash;or perhaps because of
  the cross-examination she seemed barely to have survived. It WAS odd, though,
  that Norris had never seen her on the stage, so that he could not know that
  part of her which was professional and accomplished. Her life since marrying
  Austen had been too peaceful to provide acting moments off-stage, and even if
  it hadn't been, she was probably too proficient to be suspected of them. So
  she was ruefully sure he had no idea how good she was; and she had a sudden
  vision of him, amazed and starry-eyed, bursting into her dressing-room after
  a triumphant opening night... 'Oh, Carey, you were WONDERFUL!'... the word he
  had used about Paul's films.</p>

  <p>And yet, when she came to think about it, she did act occasionally&mdash;
  even with Austen. Sometimes, when she was the gracious hostess at a
  dinner-party, the thought had come that she was playing the role of his wife
  &mdash;not INSTEAD of being it, but in addition; so that he was getting
  double service. But Norris, she knew, got only single service&mdash;she never
  played any role with him, if only because she did not know what it would be.
  Stepmother? The word seemed as unfitting as any she could think of. That
  there was deep friendship between them she was certain, a warmth that had
  helped her reclaim him from the category of problem child. Or rather, she had
  tried to make Austen see the problem as the larger one of himself, herself,
  and the world.</p>

  <p>And so in Dublin with Norris, and without Austen, she was thoroughly
  enjoying herself. One day they took the Terenure tram and walked past the
  semi-detached villa where James Fitzroy had learned his Gaelic to the last.
  Another day they visited Kingstown and climbed the hill to her great-uncle's
  old house; he had died only a few years before, and a new house built close
  by obscured the view of the harbour on which he had so often trained
  binoculars. She remembered the spot (to within a dozen yards) where she had
  first mistaken Paul for an advancing gunman... only fourteen years ago, yet
  it seemed, and was, in another age, for by now the gunmen were in office and
  grown respectable&mdash;a typical Irish progression. Even the Abbey Theatre
  had followed it, becoming by now a rather conservative institution whose
  leading personnel had mostly left for the fleshpots of America, and in which
  the early plays of O'Casey were exhibited from time to time like upheld
  relics of an uproarious past. She felt not only a stranger in Dublin but a
  stranger to the kind of city it had become, and this made her feel a stranger
  to the kind of girl she had once been herself&mdash;not merely innocent,
  then, of what the world was about, but ignorant of the fact that the truth
  was not to be discovered. As the wife of a rich American she was doubtless
  now envied, and as a beautiful woman she could be admired, but as an
  Irishwoman she had been suspect from the moment the porters at the Shelbourne
  saw her Hartmann luggage and knew she would throw half-crowns about like
  sixpences. She was aware of all this, but it was Norris who gave it meaning.
  He, with his American birth, background, and accent, was REAL; and she
  noticed also that he was far less shy than in his own country. It was as if
  being a foreigner gave him greater confidence to be himself.</p>

  <p>He kept his word by asking no more personal questions (that is, about her
  previous marriage), but he often skirted the subject, and sometimes her
  unsatisfactory answers must have told him he had touched it. As when, for
  instance, he probed her acting career in Dublin&mdash;what parts she had
  played, how she had become successful, had it been easy or hard, sudden or
  gradual. She was deliberately vague, until he sensed she was concealing
  something; he then said: "Don't you like to look back?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind, Norris. Why should I?"</p>

  <p>"I just thought you might have some regrets."</p>

  <p>"Darling, if you only knew how little I did here to have any regrets
  about. They only gave me the smallest parts." She hoped the evasion would
  satisfy him, but of course it failed to.</p>

  <p>"That wasn't what I thought you might regret. It was the idea of giving it
  all up&mdash;later&mdash;after you'd been a success. I wondered if coming
  back here and thinking about it might make you wish you hadn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh no. I was GLAD to give it up&mdash;you've no idea how exhausting the
  theatre can be, even if you are successful. Perhaps ESPECIALLY if you're
  successful. Anyhow, I've been very happy since, and if I ever wanted to, I
  dare say I could go back." She added mischievously: "Would it give you a
  thrill if I did?"</p>

  <p>"ME? You bet. But not father."</p>

  <p>"I didn't ever promise I wouldn't go back."</p>

  <p>"All the same, he doesn't expect you to."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't matter, if I wanted to do it."</p>

  <p>Then she checked herself, a little appalled. She wasn't sure she had
  spoken the truth, but even if she had, it was hardly a thing to have confided
  in Norris. She must not let this vacation, with all its chances, generate a
  conspiracy between the two of them against Austen. She went on hastily: "Of
  course I don't really mean that. It WOULD matter, but I'm sure if I wanted to
  do it your father would wish me to."</p>

  <p>To which Norris retorted derisively: "Why don't you try him one of these
  days and see? Tell him Hollywood's offered you a big contract to star in a
  film."</p>

  <p>"HOLLYWOOD? Why should I say that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it COULD happen, couldn't it? Didn't they ever go after you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why did you turn them down?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there were many reasons&mdash;so many I can't even remember them
  all."</p>

  <p>He said judicially: "You know, Carey, I think you'd be good on the screen.
  You're so beautiful&mdash;you'd be a joy to photograph."</p>

  <p>"Well, thanks. I love compliments."</p>

  <p>He went on, still judicially: "And also, as you said, you aren't one of
  the VERY great actresses. In films you don't have to be... No, I mean it
  &mdash;I'm not kidding. I know something about films&mdash;at school we have
  a society to study them and I'm president of it. I'd like to direct films
  some day. That's why I'm such an admirer of&mdash;of Paul Saffron..." He
  looked embarrassed to have mentioned the name, as if he felt it might
  constitute a breach of the agreement. "Anyway, what I said is true&mdash;I do
  think you'd be a success in films. You have the face and the voice and the
  personality."</p>

  <p>"Plus a slight knowledge of acting which I could forget if I found it a
  nuisance... Yes, I dare say you'd make a good director."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Why?"</p>

  <p>"You've already learned how to flatter a woman one minute and squash her
  the next, so that she doesn't know whether she's in heaven or the
  doghouse."</p>

  <p>"Is that what they do?"</p>

  <p>"Some do."</p>

  <p>We're still talking about Paul, she reflected, and Norris guesses it...
  She took the boy's arm (they were walking along O'Connell Street near the
  Pillar) and said: "Let's go to a movie, if you're so keen on them." It wasn't
  a specially good one, but he responded excitedly as to ice-cream, animals in
  a zoo, a catchy song, or any of a dozen other simple enjoyments. He was old
  for his age, perhaps, but there was also a sense in which he was young for
  his brains. Nor did she take too seriously his announcement that he would
  like to be a movie director. There was already a long list of trades and
  professions, from lion-taming to private detection, that he had declared
  himself in favour of.</p>

  <p>A few days later they drove north to Belfast and the Giant's Causeway,
  then crossed to Scotland and toured the Highlands. By this time Austen had
  finished his European business trips and was waiting for them to join him in
  London. They had an enjoyable week there, sightseeing and going to theatres,
  but perhaps the most interesting event was again one in which Austen had no
  part. It was during a day he had reserved for business appointments in the
  City; Carey and Norris were strolling along Oxford Street when a poster faced
  them outside a small cinema&mdash;it was of a youth and a girl, hand in hand,
  against an idyllic background of forest. Over it was the title in large type
  Passion Flower, and in brackets under it in small type: Erste Freundschaft.
  Clearly the English exhibitors had felt themselves able to improve on a
  literal translation. To Norris, however, the two titles offered more than a
  joke; he exclaimed, tugging at Carey's arm: "It's one of Paul's pictures...
  YOUR Paul... Oh, we MUST see it... Carey, don't you want to?"</p>

  <p>She didn't know whether she wanted to or not. Several times, in New York,
  she had seen films that Paul had made, and had enjoyed them under
  difficulties, aware that Austen would have been unhappy had he known about
  it, and half-conscious of guilt because of that. She wondered how she had
  happened to miss Erste Freundschaft: maybe that was the year they had spent
  so little time in New York. Norris was chattering on: "It's probably our only
  chance, with father not with us&mdash;an old picture too&mdash;we mightn't
  ever catch it anywhere else... Carey, even if you don't want to see it, may
  I? Do you mind? I'll be back at the hotel by five..."</p>

  <p>She was staring at a name in even smaller type on the poster&mdash; "Wanda
  Hessely".</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," she said.</p>

  <p>The girl at the box-office told them, with complete lack of enthusiasm,
  that the 'big picture' had been on about ten minutes. They went inside. It
  was an old-fashioned building dating from the early days of films&mdash; very
  oblong, with a steep slope and bare walls. Not more than forty or fifty
  people were scattered about the middle. Carey and Norris found seats in an
  empty row. The print was old and flickered badly. The occasional English
  dialogue, flashed on the screen on top of the picture, was often absurd and
  always distracting. The sound track was worn, so that both voices and music
  sounded metallic. Twice during the performance the film broke and there were
  moments of dark silence that fidgeted everybody. And yet, against all these
  disadvantages, a vivid beauty was alive on the screen and somehow
  communicated itself, not only to Carey and Norris but to the small English
  audience who might well, after seeing the posters, have expected something
  very different.</p>

  <p>For Erste Freundschaft was, in essence, nothing but a story of first love,
  but portrayed with such warmth and tenderness that its simplicity was almost
  disguised. There was no need for the overprinted English dialogue; one almost
  felt there was no pressing need for the German voices even if one had
  understood German. It was really (as Norris acutely remarked afterwards) a
  silent picture with the kind of accessory use for sound that silent pictures
  had had&mdash;no more.</p>

  <p>Carey was glad the theatre was darker than most, for the film moved her in
  places, not so much to tears as to a helpless acquiescence that would have
  made her speechless had Norris offered any comment, but he did not; he seemed
  as enthralled as she was, though of course less personally. For he did not
  know she had met Wanda Hessely; and, come to think of it, the picture must
  have been made only a short time after that meeting at Interlaken. Carey's
  acquiescence was partly with Paul's opinion of Wanda&mdash;that she WAS a
  great actress, great enough to weave her personal beauty into the total spell
  of the picture; or perhaps this was Paul's achievement. But it was when she
  came to thinking about Paul himself that acquiescence became most helpless
  yet also puzzled; for how had he ever managed to tell such a story? The man
  who made this picture is a man who understands love, she would have thought,
  had she not once been Paul's wife. Yet the impact of what she had seen on the
  screen was so great that eventually she was thinking: he DOES understand, or
  did, in his own world, however far that has come to be from mine.</p>

  <p>When they left the cinema dusk was falling, and neither she nor Norris had
  much to say during the short taxi ride to the hotel. She wondered whether he
  was old enough not to have found the theme sentimental. He had been so
  enthusiastic over the other Saffron pictures; it would be ironic if this one
  had pleased him less.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was very beautiful," she said simply.</p>

  <p>He replied, as they climbed the steps to the hotel: "I wonder why he
  called it Erste Freundschaft? That means 'First Friendship'. But it was love,
  not friendship."</p>

  <p>That evening Austen took them to the theatre to see a popular play that
  none of them liked, and the next morning they left for Southampton and
  boarded the Normandie.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One morning in the spring of 1939 Carey was walking along
Fifth Avenue
  when she saw a man coming out of a shop who looked so much like Paul that she
  caught her breath. She stared fascinatedly while he sauntered across the
  pavement to signal a taxi, lighting a cigar as he did so. Then, because he
  suddenly saw her and spoke her name, she caught her breath again, with
  astonishment not only that it was Paul indeed, but also, and illogically,
  that he had changed so greatly.</p>

  <p>"Carey, this is really incredible. How ARE you?"</p>

  <p>They shook hands, and for a moment she could not call herself to any kind
  of order. It was not so much that he looked older (after all, it was almost a
  decade since she had seen him, and presumably she looked older too), but he
  had become weightier in a way that somehow suggested mental rather than
  physical substance; his head seemed bigger and his eyes brighter and smaller,
  and there was a sombre twinkle in the greeting he gave, stooping slightly
  over her hand with a gesture that offered the verdict she had been fumbling
  for in her mind&mdash;that he looked every inch, and in all dimensions, a
  maestro. Which was (as Foy had once said at the old Hampstead theatre) a
  Continental trick; and in a flash of whimsy she saw this changed Paul,
  dressed more Gallically, but with the same brooding effervescence, on some
  Paris poster advertising an apritif.</p>

  <p>"Carey... have lunch with me... Of course you will... Taxi!..."</p>

  <p>A cab came up, and before she could think of an objection (if there were
  any) he had bundled her inside and ordered the man to drive to Twenty-One. A
  bit of a character, this driver, independent-spirited but not surly, and
  honest enough to remark that since Twenty-One was only round the corner it
  was hardly worth getting in for. Whereupon Paul replied, mock-suavely
  (exactly as to some callow actor's suggestion that a line in a play be
  changed): "May we have a ride, please, instead of a geography lesson?" To
  which the man retorted, with a shrug: "Okay, buddy, any way you want it."
  This little incident, so convincing in its message that Paul had not changed
  altogether, would have amused Carey had she not been gathering her wits to
  realize what would happen if they did lunch at Twenty-One&mdash;a minor
  sensation on the spot and later in gossip columns. She was not going to let
  herself in for this at any price, but she had barely time to countermand
  Paul's instructions and tell the driver to turn on Sixth Avenue and enter the
  Park.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Paul then said, grinning at her. "Any way YOU want it."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Paul. I hope you don't mind. But some other place&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;wherever you like. Now tell me about yourself&mdash; all
  the news of what's been happening to you."</p>

  <p>But it was not so easy to begin, besides which she knew how incapable he
  was of letting anyone else talk. Nor did he help by exclaiming, loudly enough
  for the driver to hear: "So you married Moneybags in that Mexican place that
  dogs are named after." He spoke indulgently, as of a childish escapade for
  which she had already been forgiven, and she recognized his familiar
  technique of making a remark in such thoroughly bad taste that there was
  nothing to do but put up with it or start a row. As she did not want to start
  a row she said merely: "Please don't shout, Paul."</p>

  <p>"Are you happy, that's the main thing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You've retired from the stage?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so, though I've never definitely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You like being idle?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not idle."</p>

  <p>"Any children?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Just the two of you, alone and rich?"</p>

  <p>"My husband has a son by his previous marriage&mdash;a boy now at college.
  Rather clever. He's interested in films. He's studied your work and admires
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, bully for him."</p>

  <p>She said, after a short pause: "You've been away from this country too
  long."</p>

  <p>"I have?"</p>

  <p>"People don't say 'bully' any more."</p>

  <p>"I know. I was a boy when they did. But _I_ didn't, not then. I never
  cared to be in a fashion."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you speak other languages now?"</p>

  <p>"French and German like a native... So he's interested in films, is he?
  You're not by any chance asking me to find him a job?"</p>

  <p>"I think he'll find one quite well himself when he leaves Harvard. What he
  seems to want to do is to write."</p>

  <p>"For films?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. Not at all, so far as I know."</p>

  <p>"Written anything already?"</p>

  <p>"A few short stories. You might like them."</p>

  <p>"Are you hinting I should buy them for pictures?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe they'd do for pictures, and apart from that I wouldn't
  recommend anyone to have business dealings with you."</p>

  <p>"Listen&mdash;I've made money lately. I can pay top prices for all the
  movie rights I want."</p>

  <p>"I dare say. I've followed your career. You've done very well."</p>

  <p>"So have you, by God."</p>

  <p>And then they both laughed. Antagonism between them, though genuine, had
  always had to take its turn with countless other emotions. She knew he had
  been trying to be as rude as he could, and she hadn't been too polite
  herself; it was all some kind of preliminary bout, not to be held of much
  importance even if the traded blows were hard. She said seriously: "I saw
  Erste Freundschaft. A great picture, Paul."</p>

  <p>His face lit up with a delight in being praised that had enough wonderment
  in it to make his boasting almost tolerable. "You really think so? You MEAN
  that?"</p>

  <p>"And I liked Als ob nichts vorgefallen sei nearly as well."</p>

  <p>"You liked WHAT?"</p>

  <p>"Als ob nichts vorgefallen sei." She did not know much German and to
  repeat the words, possibly mispronounced, with his smile widening on her,
  made her blush with embarrassment. "Isn't that right?"</p>

  <p>"Sure... But your native sounds even worse than mine."</p>

  <p>She began to giggle. "Paul..."</p>

  <p>"And you laugh just the same&mdash;and as if that were not enough, you're
  lovelier than ever when you do it. I hope our friend in front realizes how
  privileged he is."</p>

  <p>"You bet," the driver called out over his shoulder. "I've driven 'em all
  in my time&mdash;Groucho Marx, Dorothy Parker, Katie Hepburn, Maurice
  Chevalier, Sophie Tucker... Who are you two?"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of Carey Arundel?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Carey Arundel."</p>

  <p>"Can't say I... sounds kind of familiar, though. Are you him?"</p>

  <p>"No, my friend. But you are so right about the name. It sounds familiar,
  yet nobody remembers it... Well, Carey, what did you expect after ten
  years?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again through her fresh embarrassment, and thought how exempt
  she had been from this kind of thing during the years of what Paul called
  'idleness'. Just to imagine Austen exchanging three-way badinage with herself
  and a taxi-driver was as fantastic as the concept of some natural law in
  reverse; yet she knew it did not prove that Austen was a snob, or even that
  Paul was democratic. It proved nothing, in fact, except that Paul was still
  Paul.</p>

  <p>She said: "I didn't expect to be remembered, so it doesn't bother me at
  all to find I'm not. You, of course, can't understand that... Why don't we
  lunch somewhere on Upper Broadway?"</p>

  <p>"Suits me. Take us to the best place you know, driver."</p>

  <p>"On Upper Broadway? All among the hoi polloi? Okay, buddy."</p>

  <p>He drove them to a restaurant that was supposed to look like an English
  chop-house. Paul tipped him extravagantly and was very regal with a head
  waiter who was not used to regality; the table waiter, however, turned out to
  be a Frenchman on whom he could lavish exuberant conversation in that
  language. Carey noted that though his command of it was fluent, his accent
  was execrable. Eventually, having man&oelig;uvred themselves into the centre
  of a whirlpool of fuss, they were served with exactly the kind of average
  food they would have got with no fuss at all. Paul ate voraciously, seeming
  not to be aware (thank heaven) of any deficiencies. She remembered he had
  always had that sort of innocence; a steak that sizzled was good, and crpes
  suzette pleased him so much as a spectacle that he could enjoy them even when
  they were leathery. Until the coffee stage they had the waiter almost
  constantly at hand for Paul to demonstrate his French on and his personal
  importance to; finally, however, having brought Paul a double brandy, he
  edged behind the scenes with obvious readiness to escape.</p>

  <p>And then for several moments Paul had nothing to say. She wondered if he
  were actually uncomfortable to be alone with her, and if his behaviour had
  been designed to postpone that as long as possible; he looked deflated, as so
  often when the stimulus of an audience had been removed. How well she knew
  that look, the look that said: "I have spent all my brilliance on others; now
  you, my wife, are privileged either to share my silence or talk me out of my
  fatigue..." But she was not his wife now, nor was she disposed to assume an
  old function. She watched him quizzically, till at length he broke the
  silence himself by saying, with a sudden sweetness that touched her more than
  she had been prepared for: "It's good to see you again, Carey. I'm glad
  you're happy."</p>

  <p>She controlled herself to ask how long he intended to be in New York.</p>

  <p>"I'm sailing in a few hours."</p>

  <p>"Back to Europe? TODAY?"</p>

  <p>"Midnight. It's been just a short visit. Less than a week. I was in time
  for what I came for."</p>

  <p>"Some of those top-price movie rights?"</p>

  <p>"No. My mother died."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Paul..." She reached out her hand to touch his across the table. "I'm
  sorry. I didn't know, or I'd have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing anybody could do. A chill and then pneumonia. She kept herself
  alive till I got here."</p>

  <p>"I can believe that, Paul. She was always devoted to you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she really was, and so was I to her. I had her over with me in
  Europe for a few years, but she hated foreigners and after the Munich crisis
  she insisted on coming back. She wanted me to come back also, and I promised
  I would, as soon as I'd cleared up existing commitments, but I wonder if I
  should have. I wonder. The promise made her happy, anyway. And now, of
  course... "</p>

  <p>She said: "Now you don't have to do anything unless YOU want to."</p>

  <p>"That's about it. When something happens like this you feel lost and free
  at the same time... YOU didn't like her, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I liked her more, I think, than she did me."</p>

  <p>"That may have been partly my fault&mdash;I mean, how she felt about you.
  I let her think I didn't care for you much. It pleased her. But then, of
  course, it made her think I'd be better off without you."</p>

  <p>It was on her tongue to ask: "Have you been?"&mdash;but she quelled the
  impulse, feeling nevertheless that he read the question in her eyes. After a
  pause he went on, perhaps evading it in his own way: "And once she got an
  idea, no matter how absurd it was, she wouldn't let it go. For instance, she
  insisted there was going to be war last September. I told her it would all
  blow over, as of course it did, but that didn't stop her fidgeting."</p>

  <p>"It hasn't stopped a good many other people, Paul."</p>

  <p>"I know. And there'll probably be more scares. But actual war&mdash;my
  bet's still against it, and I do have hunches about things, don't I? Remember
  when I sold out at the top before the crash?"</p>

  <p>She remembered. She remembered also that it had not been any hunch of his
  at all, but the simple fact that he had wanted money at a particular time for
  a particular purpose. Presumably since then he had built the whole situation
  into drama, with himself as the clairvoyant speculator; and if that could
  give him pleasure at such a time as now, she had no wish to spoil it.</p>

  <p>She said: "I only hope you're right about things in Europe. I'm not nearly
  so optimistic."</p>

  <p>"You read too many newspapers. If you were working you wouldn't have time.
  What kind of job could an artist do if he worried over headlines every
  morning? The artist never did believe in security, so he isn't upset to find
  it doesn't exist. And he'd always rather take chances than play for so-called
  safety. Why, I'm taking a chance now, merely being here."</p>

  <p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

  <p>"Your husband could cause me a lot of trouble if he knew I was on this
  side of the Atlantic. He could sue me over that Everyman affair&mdash;maybe
  he could even have me arrested or jailed or something."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be silly, Paul. First, he wouldn't, and second, I'm pretty sure
  he couldn't. Anyhow, if you're really going about in fear of arrest, why did
  you want to lunch at Twenty-One where just about all New York would recognize
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Taking a chance, as I said."</p>

  <p>But she knew it wasn't that at all. It was just a secondary drama he had
  improvised to embellish the occasion. More and more, as she talked to him,
  she wondered how she could ever have accepted his tricks and tantrums, all
  that mercurial pretence and deviousness, as part of the norm of life; she
  wondered how her nerves had survived the wear and tear of those feverish
  years. And yet she knew she was excited to see him again, an old excitement
  without any of the old heart-strain. For she had no qualms about him now, or
  anxieties on his behalf; he was a success, as he had always wished to be, and
  she could enjoy the spectacle warmly, but with detachment. Her enjoyment,
  moreover, eased everything between them, so that he began to bask in it
  happily&mdash;too happily even to show off his French again when the waiter
  reappeared. He ordered another brandy, in English, and launched suddenly into
  a declaration of his future plans&mdash;a picture, he said, based on the Book
  of Job. For over an hour he talked about this, not grandiloquently or
  boastfully, but with the subdued eloquence of a mature mind operating at a
  peak of capability; and she was entranced. She knew then that the years had
  increased his stature in his own infallible world, and listening to him, she
  felt a certain dreamy contentment, a pride in having been once his wife, in
  being still whatever she was to him even if they should never meet again. She
  wondered if they would, not hoping it especially, but with an awareness that
  she was storing up a reserve of memories impossible yet to assess or
  classify. To have met Paul, for these few hours before he returned to Europe,
  to have heard him talk about something which in due course the world would
  perhaps find worth talking about&mdash;how remarkable it might all seem in
  retrospect. Presently she realized he had stopped talking and was staring at
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're not listening, Carey."</p>

  <p>"I WAS... I think it's a great idea... GREAT."</p>

  <p>But this time he seemed to derive no pleasure. He said, in a troubled
  voice: "You say you're happy. Tell me, what sort of a man is he?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"This Austen Bond."</p>

  <p>"Oh, HIM... He's... why, he's older than&mdash;than you, and rather quiet
  in manner, and... and he's kind."</p>

  <p>"Sounds like an epitaph."</p>

  <p>She smiled, glad of his change of mood to break the spell she had recently
  been under. "If it does, Paul, it isn't such a bad one." She looked at her
  watch. Four o'clock already&mdash;she must be getting back home. It was all
  over.</p>

  <p>He knew that too, and signalled the waiter.</p>

  <p>They shared a taxi as far as Saks', where she said she had to make a call.
  During the journey they talked incessantly and quite trivially. As the cab
  drew up outside the shop she said: "Paul, I'm glad we met. And I do hope you
  keep on having success... Goodbye, Paul."</p>

  <p>He took her gloved hand and put his lips to it, whether impulsively or
  from Continental habit she could not tell. "God rest your soul, Carey. We'll
  see each other again." (Drama in that too, doubtless, both in the Catholic
  invocation and in the emphatic prophecy of something so uncertain.)</p>

  <p>She smiled and kept smiling from the kerb till the cab drove away. As if
  to complete an ordered cycle of events, she entered Saks', walked round, then
  left by a different door and took another taxi home. Norris was at college,
  Austen had not yet returned from downtown, and Richards (the butler whom they
  still called 'new', though it was four years since Dunne's death) said there
  had been no calls. She sat by the fire in the library and glanced through the
  afternoon papers. News from Europe looked bad again. She thought of Paul
  packing in his hotel room, having dinner somewhere (he could find company if
  he wanted it), perhaps going to a theatre, then driving down to the pier to
  catch the boat. He had not named it, and she consulted the list to find what
  sailed at midnight. The Bremen.</p>

  <p>Austen came in, and they had the usual drink before going up to change,
  then another drink before dinner. She gazed at him admiringly, challenging
  herself to think how handsome he was for fifty-five. And so KIND... "Carey,
  you look exhausted."</p>

  <p>"Do I? Goodness knows I haven't done much&mdash;just a few odds and ends
  of shopping." (IDLE? Could the word be used about her life? She managed
  Austen's domestic affairs efficiently, she was on committees of various
  organizations, she gave teas and lunches to raise funds for good
  causes...)</p>

  <p>"Must be the weather, Carey. When it began that sleeting drizzle this
  afternoon I kept wishing we'd stayed a few weeks longer in Florida."</p>

  <p>She hadn't really noticed the sleeting drizzle. She said: "We can look
  forward to the summer. It's nearly April already... Do you think there'll be
  a war in Europe?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine so."</p>

  <p>"When? This year?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can't say that. I thought you meant within the foreseeable
  future."</p>

  <p>"How far into the future can you foresee?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Why do you ask? The news in the paper?"</p>

  <p>"It's serious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there ANY kind of security anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"You mean some country to run to or put money in?"</p>

  <p>"More than that. Isn't there some way of feeling that whatever happens
  certain things in one's own life are safe? Maybe that's a selfish feeling,
  but it's what I mean by security."</p>

  <p>"I'd call it only an ILLUSION of security at best, but of course for those
  whom it satisfies it's all right."</p>

  <p>"Well, how can one get it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't really know. I suppose some people BUY it&mdash;hence the uses of
  good investment stocks. And others imagine it&mdash;perhaps religion helps in
  that."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, what an icy way of looking at things."</p>

  <p>"It's an icy world, Carey, except for the small corner of warmth at one's
  own fireside."</p>

  <p>She knew he was telling her, obliquely in his fashion, how much he loved
  her, and it was comforting, but at the moment she found it easier to be
  disturbed by the remarkable similarity of Paul's views and his about
  security. Nothing, she felt, could symbolize insecurity more than their
  agreement.</p>

  <p>On an impulse to treat him as frankly as he deserved, she said: "Guess
  whom I saw today on Fifth Avenue?... PAUL... of all people."</p>

  <p>Just as Paul would make drama, so Austen would destroy it if he could. He
  answered, in a tone that could have been a parody of an Englishman receiving
  news that his house was on fire: "Really? What was he doing in New York
  &mdash;or didn't you stop to talk to him?"</p>

  <p>"He's sailing back to Europe tonight. He dragged me off to lunch, and it
  was all I could do to keep him from taking me to Twenty-One. We went to a
  place on Upper Broadway. I don't suppose anyone saw us."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't much matter if they did. How is he? Quite prosperous nowadays, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>"He seems to be. His mother died. That's what he came over for. Just a
  short visit. He has big plans for a new picture."</p>

  <p>"Still in Germany?"</p>

  <p>"No, France now."</p>

  <p>"Well, that makes a change. He's really a true internationalist&mdash;he
  doesn't care where he lives provided he can do the work he wants... He didn't
  talk of coming back here to direct any more plays?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I don't think he will. The stage doesn't give him the chance to
  be such a dictator. Or so I gathered, though of course he didn't put it that
  way. In films he can control more people more of the time."</p>

  <p>"Provided he makes it pay. One flop and that kind of dictatorship can end
  up pretty badly. The same, by the way, applies to Hitler. He can't afford to
  have a flop either. As long as he goes on winning he's safe, but sooner or
  later something else will happen and... By the way, has Paul married
  again?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say. I should imagine not."</p>

  <p>"You mean you didn't ask?"</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth I never thought about it. Paul married or unmarried
  makes so little difference to the kind of person he'd be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And which he still is, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. I thought at first he'd changed a lot, but it was only the shock
  of seeing him. He doesn't look much older."</p>

  <p>"Fatter? You always told me he put on weight easily."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Or perhaps not. He looked more... to me... it's hard to think of
  the right word..."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, what DID he look?"</p>

  <p>Austen was smiling and she answered honestly, yet knowing it would take
  the smile from his face: "He looked GREATER, Austen."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It had always been Austen's dream that as Norris grew older
their
  misunderstandings would disappear and a friendly father-and-son relationship
  develop; but this did not happen by the end of the boy's schooldays, and
  Harvard, which was to have performed the miracle if nothing else could,
  proved a special disappointment. For it was there that Norris became
  avant-garde both artistically and in politics, and this worried Austen all
  the more because he found it difficult to tell either Carey or Norris exactly
  why. Clearly it was not because he was shocked by the boy's opinions as such,
  and it annoyed him to guess that Norris thought so. But it was one thing for
  himself, in private and with regret, to doubt the future of the capitalist
  system, and quite another thing for Norris to do so openly and
  disputatiously. Thus even the feeling they shared was a barrier rather than a
  union, especially with the approaching need for Norris to consider what he
  was going to do in the world.</p>

  <p>Years before, when a brash newspaper reporter had asked Austen to what he
  attributed his business success, Austen had been stung to the epigram: "I
  always sell too soon." Actually this was true; he had sold out, and what was
  more, sold short, as early as 1928, and during the first half of 1929 it had
  required iron nerve not to admit himself wrong and get back into the market.
  The years that followed had trebled his fortune, and during this period there
  had doubtless developed the tight-lipped ambivalence of his attitude towards
  life. For he was a genuinely kind man, devoted to the few whom he considered
  his friends; and the spectacle of ruin all around him, the ruin that was of
  such profit to himself, gave him a complete absence of personal pleasure as
  well as grim satisfaction in finding how right he had been.</p>

  <p>And by the same principle of 'always sell too soon' he had decided, about
  midway during the 'thirties, that the planning of Norris's future demanded a
  sacrifice from himself on the altar of that long-range expediency which was
  so often his almost unknown god; he would NOT urge the boy to follow exactly
  in his own footsteps, entering the brokerage firm, learning the ropes, and
  eventually taking over. Since Norris had never shown any wish to do this, the
  decision presented no problem at the time; the real problem would come later,
  when Austen's more positive plan would require skilled unveiling. Briefly, it
  was that the boy should graduate into the same world as his own but under
  slightly different auspices&mdash;the slight difference, perhaps, between
  something that had a past and something else that might have a future.
  Banking was the profession he had in mind, but not ordinary banking&mdash;
  rather the new semi-governmental kind, of which the Bank for International
  Settlements at Basle was but the first of probably an illustrious succession.
  With his influence he might find Norris a job of that sort in which the boy
  could start a career that might conceivably lead to high and highly secret
  places. In all this Austen was pushing antennae, as it were, into the years
  ahead&mdash;a vastly more subtle accomplishment than mere indulgence in
  prophecy.</p>

  <p>Father and son had once come close, but not nearly close enough, to a
  discussion of the issue, during which Austen had been driven to say: "Even
  assuming that all your extreme ideas are correct, don't you realize that even
  in Russia financial experts are necessary? Of course there'd be no place for
  a firm such as mine, but banking people, fiscal and treasury officials...
  why, I've met some of them, Norris&mdash;brilliant fellows&mdash;I've sat in
  conference with them. Naturally they didn't talk politics&mdash;they didn't
  have to&mdash;because the field we were all specialists in is by no means
  tied to Wall Street or the so-called competitive system or any other
  particular bte noire of yours. Every country, no matter what economic road
  it takes, has currency and exchange problems."</p>

  <p>All this time Norris had been listening more and more cryptically.
  Presently he said: "You know, father, I'm not easily shocked, but you almost
  do that to me. Are you seriously suggesting I should enter a bank and learn
  the tricks of the trade so that when the time comes I can be Commissar for
  Currency and Exchange?"</p>

  <p>This was the kind of remark that grieved Austen immeasurably, bringing him
  to the edge of a mental abyss. He retorted sharply: "Don't be so nave. All
  I'm suggesting, if you want to know..." And then he hesitated. Even if Norris
  did want to know, did he want Norris to know? He had all the embarrassment
  that fathers of an earlier generation were supposed to have when faced with
  the problem of telling their sons the facts of life. But the facts in those
  happier days had been merely sexual; now they were economic and cosmic, and
  in Norris's case complicated by the shattering likelihood that he knew them
  already and was wondering how innocent his father was.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I would like to know, father."</p>

  <p>The tone was ironic, forcing Austen to make some sort of a reply. This he
  did, coming to grips with the situation as squarely as he ever could or did.
  "All I'm suggesting, Norris, is that the world of the future will be
  increasingly in charge of experts, and that politics, of the street-corner or
  even the Congressional variety, is becoming very much of a smoke-screen
  behind which the real rulers quietly get to work with the real issues. If
  you'd rather be a part of the smoke-screen, fine&mdash;though you'll find it
  tough going, in the direction you favour, and I shan't be able to help you.
  Whereas for the expert, life will continue to offer fascinating employment, a
  secret choice of sides according to the dictates of one's mind and heart, and
  a very fair chance of surviving catastrophe... Technical brains, remember,
  are the booty that the modern conqueror cannot afford to destroy&mdash;while
  mere soldiers and shouters are a dime a dozen in all countries."</p>

  <p>Norris was silent for so long that Austen added, more uncomfortably than
  ever: "Well, it's your future, after all&mdash;you HAVE the brains&mdash; no
  one else can finally decide how you use them. Perhaps at least I've given you
  something to think about."</p>

  <p>Norris answered, in a bemused way: "You sure have. You've really opened my
  eyes. I'd no idea you had such a... a mind. WHAT a mind!"</p>

  <p>The matter was never again broached with such near frankness. He was less
  certain now that he wanted to be a writer, despite his ability to sell an
  occasional magazine article or short story. With rare self-criticism he
  admitted his lack of everything but talent, and a spiritual arrogance made
  him feel that talent was not enough. Presently it came to be understood that
  after finishing at Harvard he would take a year for travel during which he
  would make up his mind what he wanted to do, not merely what he wanted not to
  do&mdash;an apparent surrender on the part of Austen. But of course Austen
  never really surrendered, either on that or any other matter; it was his
  campaign plan of life to avoid direct challenge, to stave off the final no,
  to make opposition to himself a bore even if it were not to be a hazard.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the war had started in Europe, and once again Austen was faced
  with his familiar cross: something which he foresaw as inevitable yet also
  deeply regretted. This was America's intervention. Liking the cause of the
  European Allies as little as did the Chicago Tribune, yet as anxious for them
  to win as was the William Allen White Committee, he found himself gagged as
  usual by his own awareness of how readily he would be misunderstood; and
  among those who would misunderstand was certainly Norris. So he would hardly
  discuss the war with him, though he noted with some satisfaction the boy's
  utter confusion about it; at one moment he was violently anti-Hitler, at
  other times pacifistic, the two often blending into a
  'plague-on-both-your-houses' cynicism. All of this seemed to Austen
  relatively unimportant compared with the extremely practical problem of what
  Norris should do when the war (as Austen was certain it would) engulfed
  America. Since Norris would be of military age he would have to get into
  uniform somehow or other, and Austen's idea was to pull strings to have him
  commissioned as soon as possible in one of the services; then other strings
  could be pulled. Unfortunately all this was the kind of thing Austen knew he
  could not discuss with the boy without risking a direct rebuff, and during
  the summer of 1941 the relations between them grew strained to the point of
  an infinite politeness. Sometimes Norris talked to strangers in the Park far
  more freely than he ever could or did at home, and once he got into an
  argument that led to a fist fight. He had happened to remark that it was
  strange that people who professed to follow a religion founded by a carpenter
  should be so derisive because a certain ruler had once been a house-painter.
  Part of the small crowd took this to be anti-Christian, another part took it
  to be pro-Nazi; and as Norris was neither, the whole episode became a lesson
  to keep his mouth shut such as (though he never guessed it) his father had
  well learned in his own youth.</p>

  <p>A few weeks after returning to Harvard Norris suddenly settled the whole
  issue in his own fashion by an act which to Austen seemed quite appalling; he
  volunteered for the American Field Service which was then sending ambulance
  units to work with the British in Africa. When Norris announced what he had
  done, Austen could not hide his grief nor the boy a certain sardonic comfort.
  "I don't know why you're worrying so much, father," he said. "America's bound
  to get into the war soon, and then I probably wouldn't have any choice."</p>

  <p>"CHOICE?... But my dear boy..." It was impossible, of course, to say what
  was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Besides," Norris went on, enjoying the effect of his own casualness, "if
  I waited to be drafted I think I'd have to be a conscientious objector. So
  you ought to be glad I've spared you that to worry about."</p>

  <p>Actually Norris was only just in time, for he was on a troopship in
  mid-Atlantic on the day of Pearl Harbour.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">For Austen the war, on the emotional level, was his anxiety
over Norris.
  The boy was at Tobruk, then at El Alamein; he was risking his life, and it
  was not part of Austen's plan that this should have happened. In a sort of
  way he was proud, and he was also aware that countless other parents were
  suffering like himself; but neither pride nor anxiety increased his sense of
  fellowship with his countrymen as individuals, any more than the fortune he
  had made after the market crash had diminished his sympathy with the victims.
  So far as his own personal affairs were concerned, it was not too difficult
  to bring even the war into the master plan. Indeed, one of the changes it
  made in his life suited him very well, for within a few weeks of Pearl
  Harbour he had accepted a dollar-a-year job in Washington, and it could
  truthfully be said that he had never worked so happily as when he found
  himself serving his country. Was this patriotism? He was honest enough not to
  assume so, and sensible enough not to deny it if others called it that. The
  truth was that the war, by enabling him to take a Government post without
  giving up his firm, had made it comfortingly possible to serve God and
  Mammon, had put the future and the past in some sort of temporary truce.</p>

  <p>As for Carey, the war led indirectly to the fulfilment of her own teasing
  dream about Norris&mdash;that he should, sometime, see her in a play. But it
  happened far differently from anything she had envisioned. To begin with, it
  was not a first night, but nearer a hundred and first, and Norris, who should
  have been starry-eyed, was almost condescendingly cynical. Perhaps this was
  just another disguise for his real emotions, whatever they were, but she had
  not reckoned on it any more than she had pictured him clumping into her
  dressing-room in a uniform that made him both shy and truculent.</p>

  <p>She herself had returned to the stage in the autumn of 1942, and for a
  number of reasons, none of them separately decisive, but all contributing to
  the event. First, there were Austen's frequent absences on business, that
  took him mysteriously by air across oceans and continents, so that she was
  left increasingly alone and for the first time in her life lonely. Austen had
  never had a wide circle of acquaintances, and this had suited her well enough
  when he was with her all the time, but as soon as he was gone (and with
  Norris also away) she realized how many friends she had practically given up
  since her marriage. Most of them were in the theatrical world, and once she
  re-established contact with them it was inevitable that the idea of a play
  should crop up. She was still remembered by producers, and since her biggest
  success had been in a rather trifling comedy, the fact that wartime audiences
  favoured light entertainment brought her many approaches. The lure of the
  stage, so harped upon and romanticized, did not specially operate; on the
  contrary, the FEAR of the stage, the memory of strain and tension, nearly
  made her say no to every proposition. Then a play came along that exactly
  suited her style; she was good, the critics were warm, it made a hit, and at
  the back of her mind was always the escape clause that if she got bored, or
  felt herself too spent, she could give up. Perhaps because of this she
  enjoyed success for the first time in her life without qualification.</p>

  <p>Nor had Austen opposed the idea; if he had, she would probably not have
  indulged what had originally been hardly more than a whim. But he merely
  cautioned her against overwork and stressed the escape clause. He seemed to
  regard the whole thing as covered by some aura of wartime expediency, like
  his own missions abroad and the loss of his butler to become a butler in
  uniform.</p>

  <p>Norris had enlisted in the A.F.S. for a year, but it was the spring of
  1943 before he came home for transfer to a regular medical unit. He had
  sailed from Egypt on a slow boat round the Cape; it had dumped him in a
  southern port where red tape had held him for days before he could get a
  furlough. It was like him not to wire the news of his return until he could
  give the time of his arrival in New York; he did not want his father to start
  doing things on his behalf. As it happened, Austen was away at the time, and
  it was Carey who met him at Penn Station. The train was late and, after an
  almost frantically embarrassed greeting, she had to leave immediately for the
  theatre. She had thought he would want to go home for a good meal and a rest,
  but instead he said he would rather have a bath at the station, see the show,
  and take her to supper. She was too excited to argue about it, so she
  arranged for him to have one of the house seats and asked him to come round
  to her dressing-room afterwards. This he did, joining the group of admirers
  whose shrill and fashionable chatter made him stay in the background till she
  caught sight of him. By this time her excitement over his return had become
  part of her usual exuberance after a performance, and she could view him with
  a certain detachment. He was handsome enough, she perceived, to transcend the
  ill-fitting uniform; that is, it looked even more eccentric on him than he
  did inside it. She gave him a lavish welcome, her pride masquerading as
  motherliness, for she felt, as always after a show, extravagant in all her
  emotions, both genuine and acted.</p>

  <p>"WELL!" she exclaimed, embracing him as she wouldn't have done except at
  such a moment. "What's the verdict? How did you like it?"</p>

  <p>"I laughed," he answered, and then, with careful timing, added, "quite
  often."</p>

  <p>He had probably thought this out as a thing to say, and it served a
  purpose by giving him status among the elegant civilians.</p>

  <p>She exclaimed gaily as she introduced him around: "Can you imagine&mdash;
  Norris has never seen me in a play before! That's a fact! Darling, don't you
  dare tell what you think of me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I will. You were much better than I expected."</p>

  <p>More amusement, amidst which he thankfully reverted to the background till
  the others had left and he could remind her she had promised to have supper
  with him.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course. I've been looking forward to it all evening. Oh, Norris,
  did you REALLY enjoy yourself? I warned you it wasn't the kind of play you'd
  choose."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't," he answered. "But to see you on the stage was fun. You're
  GOOD, aren't you? So sure of yourself, up there&mdash;the audience eating out
  of your hand&mdash;your eyes bright and your voice and movements so perfectly
  controlled... but I guess all that just proves I'm as nave as father says I
  am."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know he did... but please go on. I'd rather have your opinion
  than most people's."</p>

  <p>"Well... the sheer competence of it all impressed me&mdash;just as I'm
  impressed by championship tennis or Capehart record-changers or H. V.
  Kaltenborn adlibbing... The way you got the laughs&mdash;even the fact that
  you remembered all the lines. And then, on a different level, I was impressed
  by the play."</p>

  <p>"You WERE?"</p>

  <p>"Because of the remarkable team-work between actors and audience. Both had
  to forget how stupid the thing really was."</p>

  <p>She giggled. "I shall quote that as my own... You did laugh, though, or
  were you just saying so out of politeness?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I laughed. Couldn't help it. You had me eating out of your hand,
  too. But I'd have enjoyed you better in something more important&mdash;
  something worthier of your abilities."</p>

  <p>"How do you know anything more important WOULD be? I'm not really an
  important actress, Norris. I just happen to have something that pleases an
  audience if it's properly exploited&mdash;that is, in a certain kind of play.
  It doesn't have to be a great part."</p>

  <p>"I still think you'd be good in films."</p>

  <p>"So does Hollywood, apparently. I've had one or two interesting offers
  lately."</p>

  <p>"But you're still not tempted?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I have a feeling I wouldn't like it there... Let's
  have something to eat. I'm starving."</p>

  <p>She took him across the street to a restaurant much favoured by theatre
  people where the food was good and she knew she could get a table. "Now tell
  me about yourself," she said, over their first drink. "You haven't said much
  in your letters."</p>

  <p>"There's not been much to say that's sayable."</p>

  <p>She sensed a cloud of meaning and felt aching sympathy. "Have you... have
  you had a bad time?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. Did you think I would?"</p>

  <p>"Well... I worried about it, and so did your father. Not the dangers only,
  but... the whole army set-up. It didn't seem the sort of thing you'd easily
  come to terms with."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't. That's why I avoided rank. Stay as low as you can when you
  know you're on the wrong ladder. Be anonymous. I've found I can get along
  pretty well with most people&mdash;fellows in the same tent and Italian
  prisoners and Arab kids and girls we sometimes met in Cairo, and so on."</p>

  <p>"Girls?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Anonymous girls for anonymous men."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe what?"</p>

  <p>"That even you could be anonymous so&mdash;so personally. That is, if it
  meant anything to you."</p>

  <p>"Who said it did?"</p>

  <p>"Then it will, one of these days... Coming back to your opinion of the
  play, didn't you think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"No, let's explore the other subject, it's the most cheerful we've struck
  so far. Since you raised the point, I'd like you to know that all women are
  anonymous to me&mdash;with one exception."</p>

  <p>He looked excited, as if the first taste of liquor had released stored-up
  emotions that the entire evening had generated.</p>

  <p>She answered: "I didn't raise any point, Norris&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I will, because it's about time. I fell in love with YOU when I was
  a boy. Didn't you ever guess that?"</p>

  <p>Of course she laughed, then felt herself blushing deeply. "Norris, that's
  absurd..."</p>

  <p>"True, though. All that vacation we had together&mdash;Glengarriff,
  Killarney, Dublin&mdash;everything we did and said&mdash;I haven't forgotten
  a thing. Erste Freundschaft... Couldn't have been more appropriate, though at
  the time I missed the meaning of it."</p>

  <p>"I remember a lot, too&mdash;we certainly had a grand time. So if you did
  fancy yourself in love with me then, it must be rather delightful&mdash; as
  well as amusing&mdash;to look back to... Shall we catch the waiter's eye and
  order some food?"</p>

  <p>"After another drink."</p>

  <p>"For you, Norris, not for me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, now, don't get angry."</p>

  <p>"ANGRY? My goodness, how could I possibly&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"You're just refusing to take me seriously, is that it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not in a very serious mood, I will admit."</p>

  <p>"That's too bad."</p>

  <p>"But I earn my living by not being, remember. Oh, darling, don't YOU be
  serious either. This is such fun&mdash;I always dreamed about it&mdash; you
  seeing me on the stage and then meeting me in my dressing-room and taking me
  out to supper... How long are you home for? A good long leave, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Furlough, not leave. That's for officers. I've got to be back in New
  Orleans by Wednesday, which means I have to start on Monday."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, is that all you have&mdash;and after all this time?"</p>

  <p>"They're in a hurry to put me in a real uniform, I suppose. They probably
  have a feeling that the A.F.S. was a bit amateurish. And it was, in the
  beginning."</p>

  <p>"So tomorrow's your one whole day&mdash;" She was just realizing it and
  thinking of nothing else.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is, so if you can spare any more of your time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can. Lucky it's Sunday."</p>

  <p>"And you aren't by any chance giving a lunch party for the Jugo-Slav War
  Relief or Bundles for Timbuctoo or something?"</p>

  <p>"If I were I'd have you along to help out. But I always try to keep Sunday
  as lazy as possible."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you need it, and from now on I promise to conform to all the
  proper habits&mdash;I'll not be serious&mdash;I'll be just as lazy as you
  want&mdash;get up late&mdash;breakfast in bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not TOO late&mdash;say ten. Then we can take a walk in the
  Park&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fine&mdash;once round the reservoir and home for lunch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, lunch out somewhere. While your father's away the servants go, on
  Sundays, after breakfast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Plaza, then. And home after that with the Sunday papers and the
  radio. A noble routine... Are you sure you won't have one more drink before
  we order?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll change my mind&mdash;and the drink. Let's have a bottle of
  champagne."</p>

  <p>She did not know why she had given such a late signal for celebration, or
  why the two of them so easily slipped into an air of having something special
  and personal to celebrate. They stayed at the restaurant till almost two, his
  dark mood lifting till they were chatting and laughing as if the world were
  indeed unserious all around them; then they took a taxi to the house. The
  watchman, who sat up all night, let them in, greeting Norris and telling them
  that Austen had arrived after a long air journey and had gone to bed.</p>

  <p>"You told him Norris was home on leave?" Carey asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am, and he said he was too sleepy to wait up, so he'd get a good
  night's rest and see him in the morning for breakfast about nine."</p>

  <p>Carey and Norris stood close together in the small slow-moving self-
  service elevator that took them up to their separate floors. Norris muttered:
  "Ten, WE said. But HE says nine. Matter of fact, I still say ten." He yawned
  and swayed. "And by the way, Carey&mdash;it's furlough, not leave. Remember
  that, even if you forget everything else I've said."</p>

  <p>"I'll remember." She pulled the sliding-door for him as the elevator
  stopped. "Sleep well. Ring for Collins if you want anything... Good night,
  darling."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning Austen was still suffering from the strain
of travel. He
  had been down at nine, and had waited in the breakfast-room, drinking coffee
  and reading the papers. He greeted Norris warmly when the latter appeared
  about eleven. By coincidence Austen also had just come from Africa, having
  flown back by way of Bathurst and Brazil; he did not mean to be either
  pompous or mysterious about it, but Norris made him seem both, and as had so
  often happened, father and son soon touched the frayed edges of each other's
  nerves. To Norris his own humble uniform conferred unlimited freedom to
  deride; to Austen it was a symbol of the boy's obstinate folly. Neither knew
  of recent physical discomforts that were fairly even between them&mdash; that
  Norris had stood up in a packed chair car across half a continent, that
  Austen had been bumped about hour after hour over unmapped desert and jungle.
  But the latter, as a civilian, had travelled with importance, and Norris
  could not help matching it against his own self-chosen lack. He seemed at
  once proud and scornful of the difference. But bigger differences occurred to
  Carey as she looked at the two of them&mdash;that Austen was old and Norris
  young, yet that Austen, however exhausted, had got up early to meet his son,
  whereas Norris, fresh and eager after a late night and too much to drink, was
  in a mood to bait his father. She was unhappy about it and relieved when the
  day was over. The next afternoon Norris left, and, as she had a matine, it
  was Austen who saw him off at the station. Later Austen did not say much,
  except that the train had been crowded and an M.P. had checked Norris's pass
  and found something wrong with it, though afterwards it had turned out to be
  the man's own mistake. "But no apologies. Just a surly admission. That's the
  sort of thing he's up against&mdash;the way he had to take insolence without
  protest, whereas an officer would have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know, Austen. It isn't all a matter of uniform. Suppose you
  were insolent to one of your employees at the office, do you think he'd
  answer back just because he's a civilian?"</p>

  <p>She could see he was puzzled by her having asked such a question. "But I'd
  never dream of talking to anyone like that fellow at the station&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"I know you wouldn't, but IF you did... my point is that... oh well, never
  mind, it isn't important. And I expect the insolence didn't bother Norris
  half as much as it did you."</p>

  <p>"Actually he seemed glad I'd been a witness of it. As if he enjoyed
  proving to me how humble and insignificant he was. Does that make sense?"</p>

  <p>"Probably&mdash;to him. You're a big shot, so he'll show you he's a little
  shot."</p>

  <p>"Sheer perversity."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's his method of scoring off people."</p>

  <p>"But why should he want to score off his own father? That's what I can't
  understand. Does he ever try to score off you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, often. He enjoys telling me I'm not a great actress. Of course I
  know I'm not, but he never loses a chance to remind me. And he was scathing
  about the play."</p>

  <p>"Collins also told me he got a little drunk last night."</p>

  <p>She was suddenly furious. "Collins had no right to say such a
  thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he wasn't saying it against him. It ISN'T against him anyway&mdash;
  home on leave for the first time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Furlough, not leave. And he WAS drunk slightly&mdash;so was I&mdash; we
  went to supper and had champagne."</p>

  <p>"Fine. Why not? I wish I'd got home in time myself&mdash;I'd have joined
  you. What I meant was... the only reason I had for bringing up the matter, I
  assure you... was that THAT might have been the reason why he criticized your
  play."</p>

  <p>She answered gaily: "Oh, Austen, don't try to soften the blow. He was cold
  sober when he criticized it. He thought it deplorably insignificant compared
  with today's events on land, sea, and in the air. And it is... But it made
  him LAUGH. I'm so glad about that. We had a very pleasant evening
  together."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the late spring of 1945, when the war in Europe was over
and
  everybody's story was beginning to leak out, Carey learned for the first time
  what had happened to Paul. She met at a party a British naval officer who had
  been in liaison with the French at Bordeaux during the confused days
  following the German collapse; it was near Bordeaux that a camp for internees
  had been located, and Paul, having been one of them, had passed through the
  city after his release. The Englishman had spoken to him. "He looked sad.
  It's not unusual, though. When the first excitement wears off, those who've
  spent years behind barbed wire are apt to be like that. The reality never
  turns out to be as wonderful as the dream beforehand. Maybe that was so in
  his case. But there were others from the camp who read him differently
  &mdash;they said he was upset because the Germans lost the war. That doesn't
  make sense and I simply don't believe it. Talking to me, he hadn't a good
  word for the Germans or for his fellow-prisoners either&mdash;in fact, he
  seemed pretty fed up with everybody, one way and another."</p>

  <p>A few weeks later she heard from a different source (a journalist) that
  Paul was back in America&mdash;in Washington, trying to stir up official
  interest in the fate of his unfinished film based on the Book of Job. Nobody
  in Washington cared, but his technique of being charming and a nuisance in
  well-adjusted doses was having some result&mdash;invitations to cocktail
  parties, meetings with a few minor government personages, and so on. "He
  might pull something," the journalist admitted. "You never can tell. A lot of
  people don't realize he's American&mdash;that's in his favour. Being able to
  jabber French to an attach counts for more in some Washington circles than
  having been born in&mdash;where was it?&mdash;Iowa."</p>

  <p>"Yes. How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"I caught the accent and then looked him up in Who's Who. But the accent's
  a bit encrusted by now. You COULD take him for a foreigner&mdash;especially
  when he wears his opera cloak."</p>

  <p>"What? A real opera cloak? With top hat and gloves and cane&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you've got the wrong layout. A crushed black Homburg, a walking-stick
  that he carries into a room and leans on, and a very tattered brief-case. How
  old is he, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"He must be&mdash;let me see&mdash;fifty&mdash;fifty-two."</p>

  <p>"Well, he looks sixty-two. Cultural Ambassador, Liberated War Victim, Man
  of Genius. It's a good line with the hostesses of our nation's capital. He
  has a good line with publicity too, if he doesn't overdo it. When he said
  he'd never heard of Lana Turner he hit the news-wires... Am I being too
  flippant? I've often noticed that ex-wives enjoy a good laugh about their
  ex-husbands."</p>

  <p>Carey had been honestly glad to learn that Paul had come through the war
  years safely; she had also been amused at the picture of him at one of those
  Washington parties; but now she caught a conspiratorial air in the
  journalist's attitude, as if he were inviting her to snicker a little in
  private. She said: "Well, I certainly hope he has luck," and managed to catch
  the eye of someone she knew. She did not talk to the man again.</p>

  <p>Nor did she pass on the news to Austen. Since her accidental meeting with
  Paul in 1939 she had sensed that Austen did not care to discuss him; she had
  sensed, too, that though Austen did not blame her for the meeting and had
  said not a word in criticism, he still wished it had not happened.</p>

  <p>One Saturday morning in late August she grabbed up her mail in a hurry and
  did not glance at it till she was in the car on the way to the farm. Austen
  was driving, and when they reached the dull high-speed stretches along the
  park-way she began opening envelopes randomly and without much interest. One
  of them was a Western Union wire; it said, with a Washington return address:
  "Can you lunch with me same restaurant on Upper Broadway next Wednesday one
  p.m. Important. Paul." She felt her cheeks warming as she re-read the message
  and hastily slipped it with other mail into her purse; the warmth, she soon
  decided, was largely indignant. The wire might easily have been read over the
  telephone to Richards. And the phrase 'same restaurant', as if they had made
  a habit of secret meetings. Her first impulse was to tell Austen immediately,
  but then she saw his unclouded face; he was enjoying the drive and looking
  forward to his first post-war arrival at the farm&mdash;better wait till
  later in the day, perhaps till after dinner when they were both relaxed. But
  she told him before that. They took an afternoon walk to see what new land
  could be cleared, and returning across the fields she showed him the
  wire.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you didn't go," he said, handing it back.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't even thought of going."</p>

  <p>He walked some way without comment. Then he said: "If it's important, as
  he says it is, he can write and give you details."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. This is really too absurd, whatever it is he wants."</p>

  <p>"Probably only money."</p>

  <p>She felt her indignation suddenly deflate. Austen's mood was so
  reasonable, but his voice was cold; his guess was as plausible as any other,
  yet from him it came unsympathetically. It was like the wrong kind of line
  for a certain type of actor; in his case it was the wrong line for a rich
  man. She knew he had spoken it simply and uncynically, but somehow it made
  her switch to an indulgent feeling for Paul, even to a whimsical tolerance of
  the wire. She said: "I expect he thought it tactful to suggest meeting at
  that restaurant instead of outside the Players' Club."</p>

  <p>They walked again in silence. Near the house he said ruminatively: "I'm
  afraid he isn't getting what he hoped for in Washington."</p>

  <p>"What was that? I didn't know you knew he was back here."</p>

  <p>"I've heard a few things about him. He's been lobbying, you could almost
  call it, for support in some squabble he's having with the French Government.
  Apparently when we entered the war he was caught over there, though he'd had
  ample warning to get out, and anyone but a fool or a pro-German would have.
  But he was working on a picture and when the Germans interned him as an enemy
  alien I'm sure he became anti-German enough for anybody. His chief peeve,
  though, seems to have been against the Vichy Government for not taking his
  side. Now he wants the State Department to back him up against the new French
  Government because they won't let him stay there. Complicated, eh? It's also
  rather preposterous. He hasn't a grain of political wisdom and he doesn't
  seem to grasp the fact that on the scale of current events he and his affairs
  count for nothing. Still, you can go a long way in Washington drawing-rooms
  with a well-kept grievance. I heard he'd been taken up by one of the
  weaker-minded senators, but even this couldn't hold when the latest rumour
  got around."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she asked again. It chilled her a little that Austen
  should have known so much about Paul without mentioning it till now, and
  that, in substance, it fitted so neatly with what she had learned from
  others.</p>

  <p>"It may not be true, but the story is that he came to be on pretty good
  terms with the German camp commandant and actually sold him on the idea that
  he should be let out on some kind of parole to finish the film, but the plan
  hadn't time to go through before the war ended. Of course it was just the way
  to be tagged a collaborationist, and it certainly was incredibly stupid when
  the German defeat was already in sight. Anyhow he made enemies by it, and
  some of them are over here now, so I guess a Senator can be forgiven for
  dropping him like a hot potato." He added judicially: "I suspect the real
  truth is, and has been all along, that he simply wanted to finish that damned
  film, and to do so he didn't care whom he trafficked with&mdash;the Vichy
  French or the Germans or the Americans or the Free French or the Devil
  himself. That would be in character, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"So what do you think will happen?"</p>

  <p>"Goodness knows. Trouble for him of one kind or another, but that won't be
  anything new in his experience. And he usually falls on his feet, doesn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>There were visitors waiting for them at the house, and the subject of Paul
  was not resumed when they were alone again. Carey had expected it would be,
  if only to clear up one point&mdash;should she answer Paul's wire in the
  negative or merely ignore it? She was certain the matter must have occurred
  to Austen, and the fact that he did not mention it seemed to indicate that he
  was deliberately leaving her to do whichever she wished or thought best. She
  did what she thought he would have preferred&mdash;she sent no answer at all,
  and she somehow knew that he knew and was grateful for her decision. They had
  reached that point in understanding of each other. Meanwhile Austen was
  having his first real vacation for years, and as Carey was not in a play and
  had no plans for one, she could share his enjoyment of it. Norris was in
  Germany, having come through the invasion campaigns without a scratch and
  with a certain amount of credit. At a world-moment heavy with destiny Carey
  and Austen could both feel that their own personal case had been dealt with
  leniently, so that they could now become spectators for a breathing spell.
  Every morning Austen watched the tractors and drag-chains at work on his
  waste-land and at lunch reported progress as if it were symbolically
  important in their lives, and almost every evening they listened to the radio
  like a good bourgeois couple and went to bed early. And on his sixty-first
  birthday they had the liveliest week-end party they could assemble.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One afternoon in October the first really cold spell hit
New York City and
  Carey decided not to go out. She sat by the fire in the library, reading a
  novel, half dozing, and catching the muted sounds of wind and traffic that
  made more satisfying the sanctuary of the room. Richards, back after
  demobilization, was taking his day off. Towards four o'clock she heard the
  front door bell; after a pause it rang again, and then again, so she got up
  to find out what was happening. By the time she reached the hall Flossie was
  at the door, closing it on someone from whom she had taken a card. Had she
  put it on the tray as usual Carey would have made no comment, but she saw her
  slip it into her pocket, and this stirred a mild curiosity. "Who was that,
  Flossie?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nobody, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"Let me see the card."</p>

  <p>Flossie delivered it with a hesitation that just fell short of
  intransigence. She was an elderly Scotswoman, unsuitably named, but of
  intimidating character and loyalty&mdash;a breed of domestic rapidly becoming
  extinct, Austen had sometimes said, with more regret than Carey could muster.
  Carey stared now at the card, then hurried across the hall. There was a
  built-out porch with side windows that gave views along the street in both
  directions; she could see a man walking slowly, aided by a stick, towards
  Lexington. She turned back to Flossie.</p>

  <p>"Will you please go after Mr. Saffron and bring him back here?"</p>

  <p>"I told him you weren't in, ma'am."</p>

  <p>"But I AM in."</p>

  <p>"I told him what Mr. Bond said to tell him."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bond? I don't understand..."</p>

  <p>"He told Richards if ever a Mr. Saffron called he was to say you weren't
  in."</p>

  <p>(_A_ Mr. Saffron&mdash;as if the woman didn't know who he was.)</p>

  <p>"Flossie, whatever Mr. Bond said, I'm sure he'd wish you to do what I ask.
  So will you please bring Mr. Saffron into the library... He seems to be lame,
  so you won't have to run to catch him up."</p>

  <p>A moment later Paul was ushered in, leaning on his stick. He looked old,
  but his face was ruddy red, and he had a beaming smile for her as he crossed
  the room. "Paul!" she exclaimed, waiting for Flossie to leave as if nothing
  else could be said till they were alone. But after the door closed she could
  not think of anything to say at all. Her chief emotion was one that had been
  mounting ever since the incident in the hall&mdash;anger, resentment, and a
  kind of helpless opposition to the all-seeing and all-knowing surveillance
  that Austen had put around her. Doubtless his motives were of the best, but
  she knew that if she tried to defend him to herself she would find the whole
  situation sheerly intolerable, the more so as it affected Flossie and
  Richards. It was a peculiar thing (and she had often reflected on it) that
  Austen could win the utmost allegiance of servants and employees&mdash;or was
  it because of his frightening skill in choosing the kind from whom such
  allegiance was obtainable? But even that did not fully explain why it was not
  offered to her. Maybe because she valued it less, and freedom more. All this
  was in her mind as she took Paul's hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, Carey, my dear..." He bowed over her finger-tips, a little shakily,
  then stood with his back to the fire. "Excuse me for toasting my behind
  &mdash;if I don't get warm before I sit down, you'll never get me up again...
  Arthritis."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"You know what happened? They put me in an internment camp. No proper
  heating&mdash;we shivered every winter for months on end. But I'm getting
  treatment now... I'm glad I took another chance on catching you in."</p>

  <p>"You've been here before?"</p>

  <p>"Twice. What's the matter with that old family retainer of yours?"</p>

  <p>"She makes mistakes."</p>

  <p>"I'd cast her for Grace Poole in Jane Eyre&mdash;well, no, she's too much
  the type. And your butler, who told me you were out, the last time &mdash;a
  pinchbeck Malvolio. Remember the drunken one we had at Mapledurham? There's
  something quite fascinating about English butlers. One of the end products of
  our civilization. Some time I'd like to make a picture in which God is a
  butler."</p>

  <p>"Hardly box-office, Paul."</p>

  <p>"Ah, how necessary that is! That's why I came to see you. I'm getting a
  bit desperate."</p>

  <p>"Desperate?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, then moved from the fire and sat carefully in an armchair. She
  studied him with an effort of concentration, ticking off in her mind the many
  changes which were not, in the aggregate, so very much&mdash;hair wilder and
  completely grey, the bones of the face more high-lighted, the eyes brighter
  than ever, the chin jutting below the lower lip, the hands red-veined and
  nervous. He could have been, as the journalist had said, at least in his
  sixties; one might also have guessed that he had lost much weight and was
  beginning to put a little of it back, but into a seemingly shrunken frame.
  Yet all in all he looked rather well, with something of an old man's
  polished-apple health.</p>

  <p>"I'm broke, Carey, and I want a job."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "I don't know about the job, but I can give you some
  money."</p>

  <p>"No, I want a lot of money&mdash;enough to work with. I have an idea for a
  picture&mdash;box-office and also great... You know those sons of bitches in
  France won't have me back to finish the last one? Won't even let me into the
  country! The lies they spread&mdash;that I was pro-German, that I offered to
  make Nazi films for Goebbels&mdash;not a word of truth in any of it&mdash;not
  a word!"</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad to hear that."</p>

  <p>"But they won't believe me. They CHOOSE not to believe me." He launched
  into a long account of his martyrdom, from which he emerged as his own hero
  and the victim of malicious conspiracy and calculated persecution. He had
  always had a tendency to consider himself either ill-fated or ill-treated
  &mdash;accepting good fortune as no less than his deserts, and misfortune as
  some species of deliberate evil planned against him. Carey was surprised to
  find herself regarding him dispassionately, noting the progress of his
  obsession; yet at the same time she felt a very simple sympathy. She tried to
  imagine what it could have been like for him to spend over three years behind
  barbed wire&mdash;the merely physical hardships&mdash;confinement, cold, bad
  food, poor medical care. Oddly, perhaps, it was not of these that he made
  most complaint&mdash;on the contrary, he referred to them almost derisively,
  and his recurrent phrase 'that damned camp' was in the mood he might have
  inveighed against 'that damned waiter' in a restaurant, or a neighbour's
  'damned radio'. He even joked about his loss of forty pounds in weight (at
  one time), and the outdoor work in rain and cold that had given him
  arthritis. From what she could gather the conditions at the camp had been
  rough, but not vicious; there had been misery rather than cruelty, and the
  camp commandant seemed to have been merely a stupid martinet. Paul was
  contemptuous of him&mdash;"a man who broke his word to me on every possible
  occasion". (This, in view of their relative positions, seemed to Carey
  revealing enough.) But his bitterest grudges were against fellow-inmates who,
  he said, had spread poison about him after the general release, so that he
  was now persona non grata with the French; and on a special pinnacle of
  detestation there was a certain Frenchman, formerly his own assistant
  director, who was now in charge of the company that had been making the Job
  film. "You can guess why HE doesn't want me back. A second-rater. If HE
  finishes the film, it'll turn into a glorified floor show&mdash;that's his
  type of mind&mdash;drilling a few dancing girls and he calls it
  direction..."</p>

  <p>He went on till at length Carey interrupted: "There doesn't seem much you
  can do about it, Paul, now you're here. And you ought to be glad you're here
  &mdash;I'll bet there are thousands in Europe today who'd change places with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Okay then, so I'm here. What do I care where I am, after all? I can work
  any place. But it costs more here. I want a million dollars."</p>

  <p>She smiled again. "That's a nice round figure."</p>

  <p>"I'm serious."</p>

  <p>"But you don't seriously think I can write you a cheque for it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't asked you for money at all. I've merely said I'm broke and I
  want a job."</p>

  <p>"Then let's be practical. I'd like to help you, but what's really in your
  mind? That I should ask my husband?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you're going to talk to him about HELPING me. Why SHOULD he help
  me? I'm offering something&mdash;something that ought to appeal to him as a
  business man."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if it would."</p>

  <p>"You mean he isn't tempted by eighty or a hundred per cent on an
  investment? Several of my pictures have made it&mdash;he can have the figures
  if he wants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Paul... quite apart from all that, doesn't it occur to you he might not
  want to do business with you at all?"</p>

  <p>"I never met a rich man who wasn't ambitious to make himself richer. Maybe
  he's the exception."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he is. He certainly doesn't put money before EVERY other
  consideration. You don't know him."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to. There's nothing personal in any of this. I ask nothing
  for myself except employment for my brain, the pride and pleasure of artistic
  creation, and a pittance to live on."</p>

  <p>She laughed, partly because she knew what Paul's idea of a pittance was,
  but chiefly because she was already transferring some of her indignation from
  Austen to Paul, and the load being thus more equally distributed made it feel
  less of a load altogether. She said: "Look, Paul, your affairs are no longer
  anything to do with me, so this is a free gift of advice. Get off that high
  horse and don't be so arrogant. Because, if you can bear the truth, you're
  not quite great enough to get away with it&mdash;you aren't a Bernard Shaw or
  a Toscanini&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In my own field I am."</p>

  <p>He said that with the kind of simplicity that baffled argument even if it
  did not carry conviction.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow, till the world admits you are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Till then I must be on my best behaviour&mdash;or perhaps on my knees...
  is that it? And if I don't&mdash;or won't&mdash;what's the alternative?
  Starvation? Even in that damned camp I didn't have to BEG for a crust of
  bread."</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop talking nonsense&mdash;why must you dramatize everything? You're
  not going to starve. But you're probably not going to get a million dollars
  either... In the meantime, have some tea."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>She rang the bell. "And put your health first. It's more important than
  any other plans you have. Is the treatment you're taking for arthritis doing
  you good?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank heaven."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd let me pay for it... please, Paul, let me do that."</p>

  <p>"I would, but it doesn't cost anything."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"It's free&mdash;at the hospital. If I had some wretched little job
  bringing in a few dollars a week they'd put me in chains to make me pay, but
  as I haven't a cent I get it for nothing. Isn't that wonderful? Only the rich
  and the broke have a chance these days&mdash;the in-betweens are just out of
  luck."</p>

  <p>"But how do you LIVE? WHERE do you live? Are you in New York?"</p>

  <p>He gave her an address.</p>

  <p>"How do you manage without money?"</p>

  <p>He grinned. "You've forgotten, haven't you? I borrow where I can and run
  up bills. Didn't you and I do that once? Don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>"But eventually, Paul..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. It's a problem. After all, I'm a citizen, they can't intern
  me here. I'm perfectly free to rob a bank, or hitch-hike to Florida, or
  panhandle on Forty-Second Street."</p>

  <p>She went to a desk and quickly wrote out a cheque for a thousand dollars
  while he went on talking. He talked wildly, extravagantly, and she only half
  listened. Then she came back and placed the folded cheque in the side-pocket
  of his coat.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," he said casually, without looking at it, but not
  ungraciously.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's only a small fraction of what you asked."</p>

  <p>And he began to chuckle. "Who gets all he wants in this world, Carey?
  Perhaps YOU do... You've had most things. Fame, fortune, health... How's that
  boy you once talked about&mdash;Norris, wasn't that the name? Of course, you
  can guess what reminded me of him. I was counting the things you'd had, and I
  suddenly thought of the one thing you haven't had... children of your own.
  D'you find Norris a good substitute?"</p>

  <p>"I don't find him a substitute at all. He's in Germany now. It's over a
  year since I saw him, but he came through it all, that's the main thing...
  Here's tea."</p>

  <p>She had seen the door opening, but it wasn't Flossie carrying the tray. It
  was Austen. She felt a sudden constriction of the heart that made her quite
  breathless for a moment. Paul in the chair was invisible to Austen as he
  crossed the room, and by the time the two men confronted each other she was
  standing between them, vaguely smiling and gasping out an introduction.
  Austen seemed so little surprised that she guessed he had been told that Paul
  was there, and Paul, trying to rise with the aid of his stick, eased the
  situation by his infirmity. Austen gestured him not to get up, shook hands
  with him, and made some comment to Carey about the weather. She responded,
  and from then on, so far as she was concerned, it was all acting. Amidst the
  first exchanges of civilities Flossie entered with the tea-things, and this
  provided a whole ritual of movement while the two men conversed. Austen was
  reserved, but formally polite. Paul, to her relief, and presently to her
  slight amusement, turned on the charm. Never, she felt sure, had he been more
  genial. The things he did not mention at all were perfectly chosen&mdash;
  films, money, and his own personal affairs; while the topics that did
  inevitably crop up&mdash;post-war Europe and the general state of the world
  &mdash;were touched upon by him in a mood of urbane wistfulness that (Carey
  could see) made its own peculiar appeal to Austen. She thought: But for me
  these two men could be friends&mdash;for about five minutes, or until Paul
  decided it was too much of an effort. But as a spectacle it was fascinating
  &mdash;to see him feeling his way into Austen's personality as if it were a
  part in a play that had to be interpreted. The climax came when Paul, having
  been gently pessimistic about the future of western civilization, quoted from
  a speech made by Serge Diaghileff in 1905: "'... We are witnesses of the
  greatest moment of summing- up in history, in the name of a new and unknown
  culture, which will be created by us, and which will also sweep us away. That
  is why, without fear or misgiving, I raise my glass to the ruined walls of
  the enchanted palaces, as well as to the new commandments of a new aesthetic.
  The only wish that I, an incorrigible sensualist, can express, is that the
  forthcoming struggle should not damage the amenities of life, and that the
  death should be as beautiful and as illuminating as the resurrection.'"</p>

  <p>"All that from Diaghileff?" Austen said, when Paul made a pause.</p>

  <p>"Yes. At a dinner in St. Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"Far-seeing."</p>

  <p>"Diaghileff was a far-seeing man."</p>

  <p>"You knew him?"</p>

  <p>"Not then, of course. But during the early 'twenties, when I was still
  young and impressionable and taking my first trip abroad, I had the nerve to
  write to him and he was gracious enough to meet me at a Montmartre caf. How
  nave he must have thought my ideas! Yet he listened, and discussed them, and
  gave me just the few words of encouragement I then needed."</p>

  <p>It made a winsome picture&mdash;the modest youth from Iowa at the feet of
  the world-weary Gamaliel in Paris, and the only thing amiss with it, Carey
  suspected, was that it had probably happened very differently, if at all.</p>

  <p>There followed more anecdotes, delightfully told, yet as they continued
  Carey began to feel some strain in her enjoyment of the performance, as if
  she were watching the try-out of a new kind of trapeze act. After more cups
  of tea and another half-hour of chatter she was really quite glad when Paul
  rose to go. He shook hands with her, and Austen took him out to the hall. A
  moment later Austen returned. He went to the sideboard and mixed himself a
  whisky and soda. By that time Flossie was clearing away the tea-things and
  drawing the curtains.</p>

  <p>"Good talker," Austen commented when they were alone. "Do you think he
  made all that up about Diaghileff?"</p>

  <p>She knew then that the assessments had not been all on one side. "The
  speech? He might have, though he seemed to know it by heart."</p>

  <p>"I must see if I can check on it. Really quite worth remembering."</p>

  <p>"Paul or the quotation?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "I must admit I hadn't imagined him quite so affable."</p>

  <p>She said: "Yes, nobody can be more charming than Paul when he
  chooses."</p>

  <p>"So he chose to be just now?"</p>

  <p>"Evidently... He's broke, he says, and wants work. In films."</p>

  <p>"He won't find it easy to get."</p>

  <p>"No? Because he's made enemies?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. I don't think Hollywood will bid very high for his services."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hollywood..."</p>

  <p>"Well, where else can he try? There's no other place over here."</p>

  <p>"What he'd really like is to make a film of his own&mdash;maybe IN
  Hollywood, but independently. He did that in Europe, and apparently he had
  some big successes. Commercial successes."</p>

  <p>"I know he did, but the system's different over there&mdash;or was, before
  the war. Anyhow, his European reputation doesn't count at the American
  box-office, and for four years he's been out of touch with everything."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a good deal about the film business."</p>

  <p>"Only financially. My little venture with Everyman taught me a few
  things."</p>

  <p>"I can understand it taught you not to trust Paul."</p>

  <p>"Well, no, not exactly. The circumstances were unusual... I wouldn't
  generalize from that one experience. He's a slippery customer, but not, I'd
  say, from any financial dishonesty&mdash;it's his temperament."</p>

  <p>"That's very reasonable of you, Austen. If only HE were as reasonable...
  but he isn't. If he had been he wouldn't have had to lose those four
  years."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was a pity. Four years is long enough for most people to forget
  and be forgotten."</p>

  <p>"So you think if he wanted to make a picture now he wouldn't find anyone
  to back him?"</p>

  <p>"You mean a personal corporation with a bank putting up the money?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know. Is that the way it would be done?"</p>

  <p>"If it COULD be done. But I don't think there's a chance. Of course, he
  might interest one of the big studios in whatever picture idea he has. But
  he'd have to sell it for what they'd offer, and if they employed him on the
  job he couldn't expect a big salary."</p>

  <p>"I think he wants authority&mdash;control&mdash;more than money."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately what he wants isn't likely to matter much."</p>

  <p>"That seems hard, when he has such abilities. Do you have influence with
  any of the studios?"</p>

  <p>"Not to a point where I could help a man who asks for the moon. There are
  only a handful of people in Hollywood who have real authority and control
  &mdash;it's a rare thing there."</p>

  <p>"But you COULD find him a job&mdash;a subordinate job&mdash;if he were
  satisfied with that?"</p>

  <p>"It's possible. One of the smaller studios has connections with some
  banking people I know. That might work if I cared to try it."</p>

  <p>"If you cared to, naturally. And I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.
  There's no reason why you should raise a finger for him."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that, Carey. I'd help him if he were helpable. But if his sights
  are too high&mdash;ridiculously high, what can anyone do? And incidentally,
  I'd rather you weren't mixed up in this at all. He and I have now met, and
  I'm not sorry that happened, because he can contact me again, directly, if
  ever he wants."</p>

  <p>"And you WOULD help him then?"</p>

  <p>"If he were in a mood to take what he could get I'd certainly put in a
  word."</p>

  <p>"That's reasonable, Austen," she said again. "Very reasonable."</p>

  <p>But the word 'reasonable' was so dubious to her that she could hardly
  speak it without catching an ironic sound in her own voice. Suddenly she
  noticed that his face was pale and that he was taking, unusually for him at
  that time of day, an extra drink.</p>

  <p>They did not discuss Paul again at dinner, nor during the days that
  followed, and the longer he was not mentioned the harder it became for her to
  broach the subject, though she often wanted to. For there were many things
  she was anxious to know&mdash;whether, for instance, Paul had followed up his
  meeting with Austen by making any direct request for help. And there was the
  disquieting possibility that he might have written to her, or telephoned, or
  even called at the house again, and that on Austen's instructions some
  message had been intercepted. More than once she decided to take up with
  Austen this matter of the orders he had given to the servants, but each time
  when the chance came she said nothing, unwilling to start an argument that
  might make them both unhappy.</p>

  <p>She was conscious, since the meeting with Paul, that some strain was on
  her life with Austen&mdash;probably nothing serious or lasting, just a faint
  shadow on the happiness she had so long enjoyed.</p>

  <p>Then they had news of Norris that took all other things out of their
  minds.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Norris, having driven an ambulance for four years and in
two continents
  without serious mishap, drove a jeep into the Rhine on a dark night six
  months after the war in Europe was over. He was nearly drowned and had
  injuries besides. At first these were thought to be severe, but just when
  Austen was arranging to fly to a hospital at Coblenz, wires he had already
  pulled began to operate and Norris was flown across the Atlantic. He arrived
  at LaGuardia on a December morning, Carey and his father meeting him. To
  their relief he could walk, the damage being mainly to one arm, and within a
  week (again thanks to Austen's intervention which he never discovered) he was
  mustered out and convalescing at the farm.</p>

  <p>But he failed to recover quickly to normal, whatever normal was, and it
  was also clear that either the accident or the cumulative experience of war
  had (to use another of the clichs) 'done something' to him. WHAT was the
  problem.</p>

  <p>There was certainly a development from the boy to the man, yet also from
  the boy who had been precocious for his age to a man who, in a way that was
  rarely but acutely discernible, seemed to have held on to some delicate
  boyishness as healing aid to a troubled spirit. The doctors talked of
  long-deferred fatigue which the car smash and the half-drowning had unloosed;
  as a short-range diagnosis it doubtless fitted the symptoms, which were an
  excitability alternating with long periods of lethargy during which he did
  not seem interested in either events or people. But perhaps he was, in some
  way of his own. He read a good deal, and Carey was surprised to notice that
  many of the books were solid stuff&mdash;history, anthropology, religion,
  mysticism. Fortunately he had the desire for rest, which was what he most
  needed, and his old hostility to his father was less evident, as if it were
  part of an energy he no longer possessed. To Austen this dubious change
  brought great joy. He spent hours with Norris, talking, reading, listening to
  the radio, often merely sitting silently in an opposite armchair while Norris
  dozed; and when business took him to New York he urged Carey not to leave the
  boy alone too much, though she herself did not think Norris minded being
  alone. It was certainly quiet at the farm while Austen was away, sometimes
  for several days during mid-week. Mrs. Grainger, whom Carey liked, did the
  cooking, and there was no fuss or commotion&mdash;none of the well-oiled
  superfluousness of the routine when Austen brought the other servants along.
  Carey helped Mrs. Grainger with the house-work, and Norris, using his
  uninjured arm, seemed to like doing small chores on his own. If he did not
  speak for hours on end, Carey did not bother him, but if he felt inclined for
  chatter, or nonsense, or even serious conversation, she was always ready.
  Once she found him reading Thoreau, about whom he commented: "I don't think
  I'd have liked this fellow personally, but I admire his pose. Nobody ever did
  it better."</p>

  <p>"You mean the simple life&mdash;Walden Pond? Don't you think he was
  sincere?"</p>

  <p>"Up to a point. But to enjoy the simple life you really ought to be
  simple, whereas to write so well about it you have to be complicated. I've a
  feeling Thoreau enjoyed it chiefly because he liked to write about it."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you work up that idea into a critical article?"</p>

  <p>"Trying to find me some occupational therapy? That's what they call it in
  the hospitals."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I just thought it sounded an interesting idea. For the
  Atlantic or Harper's, if it turned out well enough."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if it would... If I had any talent, I think I'd rather paint than
  write."</p>

  <p>"How do you know you haven't any?"</p>

  <p>"That's the come-on for all the racket schools."</p>

  <p>"I know, but if you could get any fun out of it, why not try?"</p>

  <p>She bought him paints, easel, canvases, and a book of technical
  instruction, and to her pleasure he found an interest that at times almost
  amounted to enthusiasm. If there were sun she would carry his equipment to
  some sheltered spot outdoors, and on bad-weather days he did still-lifes in
  one room or another. He had talent, but not much, as he soon became ruefully
  aware. Sometimes, and also for nothing but fun, Carey painted with him, the
  same scene or model, and her effort was usually better than his, but still
  not in any way remarkable.</p>

  <p>"A couple of amateurs," he commented. "How you'd despise anyone on our
  level in the theatre!"</p>

  <p>"Probably. One's always intolerant of the non-professional in one's own
  profession."</p>

  <p>"You still feel acting is that&mdash;to you?"</p>

  <p>"I expect I always shall."</p>

  <p>"Any new play in prospect?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present."</p>

  <p>"Looking for one?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. I think I need a rest almost as much as you do."</p>

  <p>"Father never really liked you being in plays, did he?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say he was keen on it, but during the war he didn't seem to
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he counted it a sort of war work."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Or perhaps he thought the war was an excuse for anything."</p>

  <p>"Well, it just about was."</p>

  <p>They went on putting finishing touches to their canvases. They had chosen
  a grouping of fruit and bottles on a tray beside a window, but the lighting
  and reflections were beyond their skill and the result was only middling.
  They knew that, yet they kept on, as if impelled by a desire more tolerable
  because the whole thing so clearly did not matter.</p>

  <p>"We're pretty hopeless," she said seriously, studying her own attempt and
  assuming his was as bad.</p>

  <p>"But it's quite as sensible," he answered, between brush-strokes, "as
  playing bridge."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, because I do that badly too, and your father's so good. I
  always envy him at parties."</p>

  <p>"But he doesn't dance and you dance beautifully."</p>

  <p>"So do you."</p>

  <p>"I'll dance with you when my arm's better."</p>

  <p>"Good."</p>

  <p>And after a pause: "By the way... did they ever give any details about the
  accident?"</p>

  <p>"YOUR accident? THEY?"</p>

  <p>"Anybody."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;at least I never heard."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not much of a story. I was driving a girl home after a dance.
  She was killed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Norris... I didn't have any idea of that." She put down her brushes
  and he did also, neither of them giving another look to model or canvas. She
  began to tidy up, then. "That's dreadful... Were you... were you very fond of
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. I'd never met her till that evening. I was taking her home
  because my friend, who'd been with her, had passed out. I hadn't had any
  drinks myself and the whole evening was simply a bore. We were driving slowly
  when a truck came at us round a corner. I had to swerve and we skidded. The
  road ran along the river-bank. That's all. But I thought I'd tell you in case
  you'd heard about the girl and might think there was some romance in it." He
  paused, as if waiting for comment; when she made none, he continued: "Yet it
  affected me a good deal&mdash;I think more so in some ways than if I'd known
  and liked her. And the thing itself was worse than war, if you can imagine
  what I mean, because killing is what wars are for and you half expect it all
  the time. Just as you somehow expect girls to be pretty... She wasn't, poor
  thing. But her family owned vineyards, and, if you dated her, they'd give you
  bottles of wine. Their whole dream, and the girl's too, was that some G.I.
  would marry her and take her to America. My pal was after the wine. But for
  that she'd have been alive today and I'd have been&mdash;I suppose
  &mdash;still over there."</p>

  <p>She saw his face twitching with some kind of agitation and thought he had
  probably done well to tell her, as the first step towards forgetfulness. She
  said, as she began cleaning the brushes: "I'm glad you told me, Norris... I
  hope it's fine tomorrow&mdash;we might try the barn, or if it's too cold to
  paint, we could do a quick sketch."</p>

  <p>But it rained the next day and the skies were so dark that it was hardly
  worth while to sketch or paint anywhere; and the day after that they returned
  to New York for the Christmas season. Austen was waiting for them, happy over
  the boy's progress to health and ready to give Carey full credit for the
  painting experiment. Norris seemed fairly happy also, or at least indifferent
  to where he was taken. Of the three, the only sufferer was Carey, for whom
  the return was to the secret surveillance which she had not yet complained of
  to Austen, and could not discuss with anyone else. She was certain now that
  Richards had Austen's private instructions, yet nothing was provable, since
  it was fully a butler's job to sort mail, take telephone calls, and so on.
  And even if, when she dialled a number from her room, she heard the click of
  an extension elsewhere, she knew there could be a hundred innocent reasons
  for it. She was always on guard against an obsession, having observed so many
  in other people; but to measure every suspicion against the possibility was
  almost an obsession in itself. Only while she was with Norris could she feel
  utter freedom, for Austen approved so much the time she spent with him,
  noting each day the boy's rising spirits. So that in a room where she and
  Norris were together she did not start at a sudden tap on the door; it was
  sanctuary of a special kind, the glass-house where nobody would throw
  stones.</p>

  <p>Because of his injured arm they tried to avoid crowds, though they saw a
  few plays and movies, but more often they walked the two quiet blocks to the
  Park and then roamed for an hour or two till dusk approached and it was time
  to return to the house. Sometimes Norris went out on his own and came back
  hours later; she never asked him where he had been, though he would tell her
  as a rule; he liked wandering about the city, taking the subway to some
  distant suburb and finding pleasure in the randomness. To her this was
  perfectly natural, or at least not astonishing, but to Austen it would have
  seemed queer, so they kept such expeditions a secret. They had a few other
  secrets, such as the books he read (she knew because she saw him reading
  them, but she never discussed them unless he started it), a few records they
  both liked and that Austen would have played far too often if he had known
  what they were, and of course the biggest secret of all&mdash;that there were
  no important secrets. In the house they spent most time in a little
  sitting-room on the third floor&mdash;Norris's since boyhood, but not boyish
  in character, for he had always had an aesthetic dislike of pennants and
  group photographs, and his entire lack of games prowess had left him without
  trophies. His mind, Carey thought, was abstractly intellectual rather than
  artistic, and he had not yet found an outlet for its proper use&mdash; maybe
  writing, eventually, if he developed ideas that could survive his own
  criticism of them. He would be formidable and fascinating in debate, and in
  this field it was the power of their sheathed weapons that kept father and
  son apart. If they ever argued, they soon reached the foothills of
  disagreement beyond which the mountain loomed unarguably. And the mountain
  was that Norris, despite facile cynicism and years at war, had certain hopes
  of the world ahead; whereas Austen, though he would have thought it nave to
  discuss the matter, had almost none. Immortal longings against urbane
  misgivings was a conflict in which Carey was more on Norris's side than she
  knew; in fact she did not know at all till one day, in the sanctuary of the
  sitting-room, Norris remarked that he didn't think he would stay home long
  after he was fully recovered.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say, Carey, in a way that doesn't make me seem either
  priggish or ungrateful. I like father much more than I did, and I can see now
  what a brat I used to be with him&mdash;he's so patient and affectionate;
  I've treated him pretty badly. And yet my first instincts were probably
  right, if I'd only kept them under civil discipline&mdash;I mean, we don't
  really have the same ideas about things. I change mine all the time, of
  course, but I never seem to change them to any of his, and I can't help
  feeling that's a remarkable coincidence. So it wouldn't be much fun for
  either of us if I handed my future over to him and said 'Make what you want
  of it.'"</p>

  <p>"But do you think that's what he'd like you to do?"</p>

  <p>"He'd like me to go in a bank. He's often said so."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't sound too exciting."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it wouldn't be an ordinary job&mdash;or even an ordinary bank, for
  that matter. It might mean going abroad&mdash;to Switzerland, and I wouldn't
  mind that a bit, except that... well..."</p>

  <p>He hesitated and she said: "You feel that if you did you'd be giving up
  something else even if you're not sure what the something else is?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And of course that's where he has a case. He says 'Try the bank
  and see if you like it'. If I answer 'I don't think I'd like it', then he
  says 'Well, what WOULD you like?'&mdash;and I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Have you had this argument with him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not an argument. Just friendly talk from time to time. All very
  detached and reasonable. I like the idea of going abroad, though. Too bad I'm
  not religious, I could be a missionary. Matter of fact, I wish I were a
  doctor, then I could be a missionary without being religious."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to be a missionary at all?"</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I know. Does that sound a silly answer?"</p>

  <p>"It's better than trying to invent a reason."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "I think I'll travel, when I've got myself a bit stronger.
  Father's offered to take me on one of his business trips abroad, but I'm not
  really sure that's what I want. Unless, of course, you went too&mdash;then it
  might be fun. But he never does take you on business trips, does he?"</p>

  <p>"It's my own fault, Norris. He flies everywhere and I hate flying."</p>

  <p>"So do I. Loathe it. The Wright Brothers were the Wrong Brothers so far as
  I'm concerned."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so far as the world's concerned too. There's not much time, is
  there, to save anything?"</p>

  <p>"That's an odd remark. Fifty years ago the only answer would have been
  'Yes, if you begin early, putting by a few pennies each day'. But now the
  question means something else, doesn't it? And that, I suppose, is the real
  grudge I have against any kind of job father would find for me. I'd feel like
  an old clock slowly running down if I really devoted myself to it. And father
  does devote himself. Not that I mean he's an old clock slowly running
  down..." He laughed with some embarrassment. "A very elegant clock, at least.
  I hope I'll look as handsome when I'm his age."</p>

  <p>"I hope I'll look as young when I'm his age."</p>

  <p>"Young? YOU?" He said shyly, and with a different kind of embarrassment:
  "I can't imagine you anything but young at any age."</p>

  <p>He looked at her across the low table on which all the equipment of
  afternoon tea was laid out&mdash;silver and china sparkling in the firelight;
  outside, beyond the curtains not yet drawn, snow was beginning to fall in
  dark slanting flakes against the window. The book he had been reading lay
  open on another table near his chair, and an interrupted page was in his
  typewriter. The deep green walls, with their few pictures, framed the red
  carpet in a way that was striking yet warm; bookshelves made their own
  pattern of colours carelessly mixed. She had a curious impulse she had had
  before when wakened in the night by something that might be a distant
  explosion or a minor earthquake shock&mdash;an impulse to note the hour and
  the minute, so that the next day, if she saw it in the papers, she could tell
  herself: That was IT... She looked at the clock now; seventeen minutes past
  four. It was the word 'young' that had exploded&mdash;but not shatteringly at
  all, just enough to waken her into a new awareness.</p>

  <p>She said with a half smile: "I'm forty, Norris, and how have I devoted
  myself? I wonder if acting's any better than banking, from your point of
  view?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but of course it is. And I haven't got a point of view&mdash;I wish I
  had. I'm just fumbling around trying to find one."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When she saw him across the dinner-table that evening it
seemed somehow
  like the day after and she was reading in the papers about that special
  moment of the earthquake. He and Austen conversed politely, and after the
  meal they both listened to music on the radio.</p>

  <p>She did not sleep well, and in the morning, not knowing quite why, she
  told Norris she had some shopping to do. "Last-minute things for Christmas
  &mdash;perhaps you'd better not come with me&mdash;there'll be crowds."</p>

  <p>She drove the car herself, as she often did, but not to the shops. It was
  a hard, bright, icy day, and before she realized it she was on the ramp
  leading up to the Washington Bridge. There was nothing for it then but to
  cross, and afterwards she turned north along the familiar road to Newburgh.
  She came to a small town some thirty miles out and had a sandwich at a lunch
  counter. Then she drove back, without much awareness of time. She was in New
  York again by mid-afternoon, and along Riverside Drive she passed the street
  that Paul had given as his address. Impulse was too late for her to make the
  turn, but by a couple of streets further it had become a definite whim to see
  where he lived. She turned and drove there, already unhopeful about it. Yet
  in New York you could never be sure, that was one reason why the city was so
  endlessly fascinating&mdash;each street, if you knew it well enough, so
  subtly different from its neighbours that even number itself acquired
  unmathematical attributes. Presently she identified a red-brick, sham-Gothic
  apartment building, several decades newer than the decaying brown-stone
  houses that enclosed it, and possibly at one time a spearhead of social
  change now merged and indistinguishable amidst the general slatternliness of
  the district. Children swarmed along the sidewalks and gutters, and when she
  pulled up they stopped their games, not because the car was anything special
  (an old Buick in days when every bookie had a new Cadillac), but from some
  instinctive curiosity that met her own as she stepped out. Even then she had
  no plan to visit Paul&mdash;merely to ask for his new address, for she could
  not imagine he would have stayed long in such a place. But she found there
  was no one to ask&mdash;neither doorman nor desk nor elevator; merely a
  cluster of mail-boxes, some of them broken and open. She studied the
  name-cards, hardly expecting to find Paul's; yet it was there&mdash;"Paul
  Saffron 4K"&mdash;and immediately the thought of him, crippled with arthritis
  and living on a fourth floor without an elevator, became a challenge to pity
  and then to action. Surely, if he were in, she could at least pay him a
  Christmas call, and with such an excuse the idea of seeing him grew warmly,
  easing her mind from the strain that had held it clenched all day after the
  almost sleepless night.</p>

  <p>Paul opened the door to her ring, and his first exclamation was not so
  much surprise to see her as at her looks. "Carey! What have you done to
  yourself? Climbing stairs must suit you... Come in. I was wondering if you'd
  ever accept my invitation."</p>

  <p>"Your invitation?"</p>

  <p>"To see some foreign films. They run them at a theatre round the corner
  from here. Nothing worth seeing this week, though."</p>

  <p>"You invited ME?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, I've written several times, but no answer. Too bad I didn't know
  you were coming today, I'd have bought some tea. Will you drink coffee?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, but don't go to any trouble. This is just a Christmas
  visit."</p>

  <p>"Good. What would we poor people do, I wonder, without you rich people to
  give us a helping hand?"</p>

  <p>Then she noticed the room, inventory-making as she always did: the scuffed
  Edwardian furniture, ugly types of an ugly period; an oblong of threadbare
  carpet in the centre of the floor, wallpaper peeling off at the corners, an
  ancient gas chandelier wired for electricity, the imitation marble
  mantelpiece surmounting a radiator, a contraption on one of the walls that
  was presumably a pull-down bed. A further door led to a dark bathroom, and
  the view from the window was of ancient balks of timber buttressing a half-
  demolished property.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile she was asking Paul about his arthritis, which he said was much
  better, and his prospects of a job, which he said were non-existent.</p>

  <p>"I just thought you might have had some luck. I&mdash;I don't know how
  you'd feel about&mdash;about talking to Austen. Directly, I mean&mdash; now
  that you've met him. He knows people, and if he could help you to get
  something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It would give him a kick, would it, to turn me into a Hollywood
  office-boy?... No, Carey&mdash;thanks to your own generosity I've so far
  managed not only to keep the wolf from the door but also the termites out of
  my brain."</p>

  <p>"But I know how it used to get on your nerves to be idle."</p>

  <p>"Who says I've been idle?" He pointed to a pile of manuscript on a table
  under the window. "See that? I've been hard at work... My life story. I tell
  the whole truth, that's what makes it unique. Probably a best seller. Full of
  big names when I get to the successful years. Already I'm as far as Othello
  at Hampstead&mdash;remember that? Here, take it with you when you go
  &mdash;I'd like your honest opinion."</p>

  <p>"But if this is your only copy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have an earlier one in rough, and my typing's not so bad. I WANT you to
  read it. After all, it's your bounty that's enabling me to write it."</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't keep on talking like that, Paul."</p>

  <p>But she knew that in his own way he was enjoying the situation. From his
  earlier word 'generosity', to this last one, 'bounty', she could read the
  progress of a drama in which he was already richly casting himself.</p>

  <p>"But you WILL read it if I ask you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, though I'm no judge of writing, as I tell Norris."</p>

  <p>"Norris? Ah, the boy who liked my pictures. I remember. How is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's grown up now&mdash;back home from the Army. He was injured in
  Germany after the war ended&mdash;a car smash. Not badly."</p>

  <p>"And Austen?"</p>

  <p>"The same as when you saw him three weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"How could he ever be different?"</p>

  <p>"You were being so charming to him that afternoon I guessed you didn't
  really like him."</p>

  <p>"Why should I like him any more than he likes me?"</p>

  <p>"All right, let's leave it at that."</p>

  <p>"Personally I think he's a cold fish."</p>

  <p>"He isn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, YOU should know."</p>

  <p>She could ignore the innuendo all the more easily because his description
  of Austen as a cold fish hadn't reminded her of her own relationship at all,
  but of the two weeks that had followed Dunne's last operation, when Austen
  had visited the old butler daily in the hospital, and of Austen's
  tight-lipped grief when all was over. The remembrance of this armoured her
  against the resentment she might have felt had Paul said anything less
  unfair. She even began to feel a sudden ease in being with someone whose
  outrageousness, whatever he said or did, could neither surprise her nor
  change her opinion of him. Let him say what he liked about Austen, Norris,
  herself, anyone he chose. She didn't care, and it was good not to care. Even
  the room began to look less depressing. It was warm at least, the ceiling was
  high, and the derelict house that obstructed the view had a Gothic
  picturesqueness. Doubtless there were many far worse places where people had
  to live and find happiness.</p>

  <p>She did not stay long after that, for she would already be later home than
  usual. Before leaving she wrote Paul a further cheque and said she would
  return the manuscript as soon as she had had time to read it. "Of course I
  may be too busy during the holidays..." What was in her mind was that she
  would rather not be seen reading it in front of Austen, so that her chances
  to do so would require contrivance.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind how long you take, Carey, but bring it back yourself."</p>

  <p>"I won't promise, Paul&mdash;it depends how busy I am."</p>

  <p>"But I'll want to discuss it with you."</p>

  <p>"I will if I can. How shall I know when you're in? Give me your
  number."</p>

  <p>"I have no telephone, but I'm always in after three. When I see a picture
  I go when the theatre opens for the cheap prices."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," she said tolerantly, as of a play she did not think
  very good, but could learn without difficulty. With the money she had given
  him she knew he could not be really hard up at all. She wished him a happy
  Christmas with a comfortable feeling that, even alone, he might actually have
  a happier one than hers. He had such reserves of self-comfort, far more than
  she had herself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When she got to the house Austen was already home, scanning
the evening
  papers by the fire. Norris was not with him. "He's resting," he said. "He
  said he'd stay in his room till dinner." She was fairly certain that Austen
  had not been wondering where she was, and that part of his indifference was
  due to anxiety about Norris.</p>

  <p>Norris came down to dinner, looking no longer tired, but rather excited;
  the evening passed without special incident and they all went to bed earlier
  than usual. She did not see him alone till the next morning, when he sought
  her out in her room while she was writing gift labels. He said hello, and
  took one of her cigarettes, then he apologized for having behaved oddly the
  previous evening.</p>

  <p>"Oddly? There was nothing odd, Norris... you just looked a bit tense,
  that's all."</p>

  <p>"I was, too. It's stupid, but I'd been waiting for you all day."</p>

  <p>"Waiting for ME?"</p>

  <p>"You weren't back for lunch and you didn't telephone Richards or
  anyone."</p>

  <p>"Norris, darling, I don't always telephone. They know if I don't turn up
  that's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"Of course, and that's why it was stupid of me&mdash;I had all day to
  wonder where you were&mdash;and to worry&mdash;I thought perhaps you'd had a
  car accident&mdash;I have car accidents on my mind, I suppose... So I just
  waited and waited... couldn't write anything&mdash;couldn't even read by the
  time you came home."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Norris, I'm SORRY." She gripped his uninjured arm and faced him; he
  was smiling now, so she smiled back. "And you know where I went? I changed my
  mind about the shopping, it was such a lovely day. I drove to the country.
  Just like one of your own expeditions, only with a car. I wished you were
  with me, only I knew you wouldn't enjoy being driven. I had my lunch at a
  place called Mack's Streamliner, just this side of Newburgh. Made up with
  stainless steel to look like a streamliner. On the left as you go north."</p>

  <p>"Did you have a good time?"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful. But I'm terribly sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, it was my own fault. One thing, though... nearly to Newburgh and
  back would be&mdash;oh, I suppose seventy or eighty miles. Did you buy gas on
  the road?"</p>

  <p>"No... Why?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe Foster won't notice it."</p>

  <p>"Foster? I don't know what you mean..."</p>

  <p>He said uncomfortably: "Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it, but...
  well, I mention everything to you sooner or later... there's quite a lot of
  checking up goes on here. Richards with the telephones, and Foster, I think,
  when you take the car out. I don't KNOW, mind you&mdash;maybe I'm too
  suspicious of people who act suspiciously."</p>

  <p>"But, Norris, even if he did measure the gas, why shouldn't I drive
  seventy or eighty miles if I feel like it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, sure. Of course."</p>

  <p>She heard the elevator whine as it reached her floor and then the slide of
  the opening door.</p>

  <p>"These labels, Norris. Will you help me? Please read them over against
  this list of names."</p>

  <p>They were so occupied when Richards brought in the morning mail.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On Christmas Day they had a small party of friends, a dozen
or so, and it
  was a pleasant time. Norris could not dance, because of his arm, but he
  talked with the guests and seemed at ease; she herself danced often, while
  Austen played bridge. Soon after midnight all the guests left except three
  players who were as keen on the game as Austen and about as good; it was an
  almost pathological keenness that Austen had, and since he had been losing up
  to then, there was an edge to his appetite for more.</p>

  <p>They were playing in what was called the billiard-room, where there was a
  billiard table which Carey could not remember anyone ever using&mdash;a large
  basement room, afflicted with supposedly masculine trappings&mdash;
  moose-heads, 'Spy' cartoons, and a fireplace far too large for a modern fire.
  There was an alcove modelled on what some architect had imagined to be a
  typical corner in an old English pub; it had no virtue except seclusion.
  Carey and Norris sat there while the bridge went on forty feet away, beyond
  the billiard table. They talked in whispers, not that they had anything to
  say that was specially private, but because the subdued ferocity of the game
  induced an atmosphere of tension.</p>

  <p>"Go to bed if you like, Norris."</p>

  <p>"No, I'd rather sit with you."</p>

  <p>"I can't very well leave just yet... though if they go on much longer...
  "</p>

  <p>"I rather hope they do. I like talking to you like this."</p>

  <p>"But you still need plenty of sleep. I'm so glad you're getting better so
  fast."</p>

  <p>"You really think I am? Don't you wish we could take a vacation somewhere
  &mdash;Colorado or New Mexico&mdash;with no one to check the gas against the
  mileage?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, Norris&mdash;I'd love it... but we can't."</p>

  <p>"Then what are we going to do?" He flushed and added quickly: "I mean
  separately... what are YOU going to do and what am _I_ going to do? Will you
  be in a play again some time?"</p>

  <p>"I might. I haven't plans, but I wouldn't like to rule it out of my life.
  On the other hand, I'm not consumed with ambition."</p>

  <p>"Were you ever?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. My first was to be a nun&mdash;but the nuns at the convent knew
  me better and laughed me out of it. Then I wanted to be an actress and play
  Juliet, but Paul laughed me out of that. He said I wasn't the type."</p>

  <p>"To me you would have been."</p>

  <p>"What a sweet thing to say... but now tell me your plans, if you've made
  any."</p>

  <p>"I know what I'd like to do. You'll probably think it crazy, but to me it
  doesn't look crazier than most other things these days. I'd like to go to
  medical school and later take up tropical medicine. My best friend&mdash; the
  one who took the girl who was killed to the dance&mdash;he was in the Pacific
  during the first years of the war&mdash;he told me plenty about it. They need
  resident doctors on all those Pacific islands. The natives have everything
  from leprosy to measles. Now the war's over the Government's beginning to
  realize how much medical work will have to be done in so-called peacetime,
  though I admit it's a bit illogical to improve the health of a few
  ex-cannibals when we're all going to be atom-bombed. Perhaps that's why it
  appeals to me&mdash;because it's illogical. When the radio-active manna
  begins to fall on the world I'd rather be discovered in some relatively
  pointless occupation such as treating a Polynesian scalp for ringworm...
  instead of sitting in a bank office doing fabulous things with a
  comptometer." He laughed nervously. "Well, what do you think of the idea?
  You're very silent."</p>

  <p>She said: "I'm just wondering why you haven't already started."</p>

  <p>"Started what?"</p>

  <p>"The medical thing, if it's what you want."</p>

  <p>"Carey, you're rather wonderful. I have started. I've written to Columbia
  asking about entrance requirements."</p>

  <p>She saw and heard the bridge game ending across the room and the sudden
  burst of talk as the score was added up. She had time to say: "I'm glad,
  Norris, I'm very glad," and then to add quietly: "I think your father's won
  &mdash;he looks so pleased with himself."</p>

  <p>Austen came towards them smiling. "Eleven dollars and thirty cents," he
  remarked, with a satisfaction which, from him, could only be considered
  charming.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night, because again she found sleep difficult, she
began Paul's
  manuscript. She had had it in her possession for over a week, during which
  there had been several chances for private reading, but she had felt no
  urgency; Paul's life story was like Paul himself in her life&mdash;close or
  distant beyond computation in miles or days. But she had promised to give her
  opinion, and, once she began, it was certainly no effort to form one.</p>

  <p>The opening chapters were interesting, without a doubt. She could also
  (though she was no real judge of this) imagine that some publisher might take
  a chance on the whole book, if only for its general liveliness and gossip
  value. But what struck her, amusingly at first, and then appallingly as she
  went on, was the picture it presented of Paul himself&mdash;an absurd picture
  on the surface, yet beneath the absurdity so ruefully revealing. For he was
  his own complete hero from the first sentence. Nothing had ever happened but
  added a mosaic to the finished pattern of the man who was always right (and
  whose enemies and friends alike were always wrong), a man infinitely wise and
  desperately victimized, a man who had never done a foolish or a selfish or an
  unjustifiable thing, but whom the world had treated with constant unawareness
  of the paragon living in its midst. The picture was flawless (Carey realized)
  because it was constructed with the awful sincerity of self-hypnosis. Errors,
  even of simple fact, were numerous and monumental. Poor old Foy, for
  instance, appeared as a philistine who had cut short the run of Othello when
  it was still making money but not enough to satisfy his avarice, and various
  other theatrical figures whom Paul had quarrelled with in London and New York
  were hardly recognizable in their completely satanic guise. For the passage
  of the years was to Paul no softener into greys, but rather a lens through
  which the blacks were blacker, and his own white whiter than snow. It was
  demonology, not autobiography. And all this in depicting the comparatively
  minor rancours of those early years. (There was, of course, no reference at
  all to that obliterated year in Hollywood.) What would happen, Carey
  wondered, when he came to his film-making experiences in Germany (the
  Everyman affair), and the war-time ordeal of the internment camp?</p>

  <p>She read with greater misgivings as she proceeded, and with the greatest
  of all when she turned back to re-read passages here and there. She was sure,
  by then, that for Paul to publish it (even supposing it were free from
  technical libel) would be disastrous. Not that it was badly written (it had
  some of the glibness that had made him, in his youth, a promising journalist
  of sorts), but there was no quality in it to offset its own angle of
  distortion, and its sole perfection was for this reason non-literary,
  clinical, and ludicrous. If he had wished to give the world the documented
  confession of an egomaniac, this was it, and of value, doubtless, in a
  psychiatrist's library; but among the informed public those who did not sue
  would probably laugh their heads off. The whole thing was too true by being
  not true at all.</p>

  <p>And then she suddenly realized, as never before, that Paul's infallible
  world, the world in which his greatness was real, the world of Erste
  Freundschaft, had nothing to do with either his actual behaviour in life or
  with his own ridiculous self-portrait. It was as if, indeed, words were a
  medium that, despite his skill with them, set him far off the tracks of
  truth. He posed in every sentence, and she remembered that his first success
  in journalism had been the exploitation of a pose that he himself had
  scorned. Perhaps that early experience had probed and explored a weakness, so
  that words were never afterwards to be his authentic weapon. And perhaps that
  was why, of every craft connected with the stage, he had always got along
  worst with writers; and perhaps that was also why, when he took to the
  camera, it was a release from chains, for in all his films there was none of
  this brawling self-love, but an integrity, a vision of life, and the
  sweetness of a ripe apple... All this came to her mind as she read the
  manuscript, and when she had finished it she wondered, not what to tell him,
  but how. The problem took such precedence, even over others she had, that she
  felt she must act quickly; she could not endure the thought of him sitting
  there in that dreary little room, happily engaged upon a task so inept. She
  drove to see him the next morning, climbing the eight half-flights with the
  resoluteness of one who intends at all costs to be frank. The real trouble,
  she expected, would not be to break the news gently but to make any
  impression at all on his own conviction that he could do no wrong.</p>

  <p>"So you've read it already?" he exclaimed, when he saw the manuscript
  under her arm. "That's GREAT! You just couldn't stop, I suppose, once you
  tried a page or two?" He smiled indulgently as he pulled a chair for her.
  From the look of things he had been working hard at the continuation, and he
  saw her glance take in the typewriter and the littered table. "I think I have
  another couple of chapters for you," he added proudly. "Now tell me all about
  it."</p>

  <p>"Paul... let me get my breath..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. Those stairs... But isn't it good stuff? How did you like
  the part about our first meeting? That walk in Phoenix Park and my promise to
  direct you in a play&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That wasn't our first meeting, Paul, and you didn't promise to direct
  me... but it's a fair sample of what's wrong with the whole thing."</p>

  <p>"WRONG?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, because it isn't true. You've just made yourself a hero in
  everything&mdash;which wouldn't matter so much except that you're wasting
  your time doing this sort of thing at all. You're not a writer. You're a
  picture-maker. Your mind's eye has no words."</p>

  <p>And now, she thought, regarding him dispassionately, let the heavens fall.
  He seemed preoccupied for a moment, as if holding some answer of his own in
  abeyance; then all he did was to take a cigar from his pocket and slowly
  light it&mdash;not at all the movement of an angry man. Presently he
  remarked: "Not bad, not bad. My mind's eye has no words. I like that. Carve
  it on my tombstone. You know, Carey, I have an idea some time to make a
  picture without words at all. The old silents were almost an art when this
  horrible mess of verbiage dragged them down to the level of mere photographed
  stage plays. You're pretty smart to perceive that."</p>

  <p>She hadn't perceived it at all, but she was dazed by her own luck in
  finding a phrase that had so captivated him.</p>

  <p>He went on, smoking tranquilly: "Do you think I'd waste time if there were
  anything else I could do?"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Paul, you MUST find some work, the kind you can do and love
  to do&mdash;otherwise you'll soon become a rather silly old man with nothing
  but a collection of memories and grievances. Paul, why couldn't you take any
  kind of job&mdash;at first&mdash;if it gave you a chance to make films?"</p>

  <p>"ANY kind of job?"</p>

  <p>"Not absolutely any kind&mdash;I mean a decent job, of course, but maybe
  not one that gives you all the freedom you've been used to... a job where you
  could prove how good you are to those who don't already know it... a
  compromise, Paul. You'll have to make one if you ever want to get back.
  Couldn't you take a job&mdash;say&mdash;in one of the smaller studios
  &mdash;and on a not so very important picture&mdash;if it were offered
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Directing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, naturally&mdash;though perhaps not with full control of everything.
  Hollywood doesn't do things that way."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"Well, where else is there? Apparently you can't go back to Europe."</p>

  <p>"So you offer me a director's job in Hollywood at a minor studio and on a
  B picture. Suppose I say I wouldn't be interested?"</p>

  <p>"Then I'd begin to lose all hope for you."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I said I WAS interested? How soon could I have the job?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't know even if there is one. But if you say
  you'd take it, that's the first step. Austen has influence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Austen, Austen, AUSTEN. I wanted his money, and his answer was no. My
  answer's the same now&mdash;to his influence. Damn his influence. No... NO...
  What sort of person do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I've never been able to decide."</p>

  <p>She could see the answer amused him as he retorted: "Maybe YOU ought to
  write a book about it some day."</p>

  <p>"Except that I doubt if I could ever make the subject interesting
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Oho, so that's how you feel? I bore you, eh?"</p>

  <p>He never did and he never had, but she answered: "Yes, sometimes... and
  I'm in a hurry, I think I'd better be going."</p>

  <p>"You won't even have coffee with me?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. I really mustn't stay as long as last time."</p>

  <p>"Next time I want you to have dinner with me."</p>

  <p>"No, I couldn't do that."</p>

  <p>"Then when shall we meet again?"</p>

  <p>"I can't promise. But let me know how you are, and if you need anything...
  "</p>

  <p>"So you find me a bore," he repeated, not believing it at all (she could
  see), but turning over the idea in his mind as some abstract curiosity.</p>

  <p>"I won't argue, Paul."</p>

  <p>"You don't even ADMIRE me any more?"</p>

  <p>This was too much, so she began to smile. "I do admire you, in many ways.
  I might even admire your attitude towards Austen if I didn't know it's a mere
  gesture. You don't REALLY feel like that about taking help from people
  &mdash;you haven't that kind of pride&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"False pride. Of course I haven't. And look, Carey, gesture or not, I
  don't want Austen putting in his little word for me anywhere. It's not a
  matter of principle&mdash;much more important, it's a whim. If you want me to
  do the kind of job you described&mdash;the compromise job&mdash;ask
  Michaelson to find me one. He's been my agent for the past twenty years
  &mdash;time he did something."</p>

  <p>"All right," she said, ignoring the further absurdity of that last remark.
  "I'll go straight to Micky from here." She was surprised that the idea hadn't
  occurred to her earlier. "But I'll have a cup of coffee with you first."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Michaelson had been Paul's agent too, in the old days
before the European
  adventures. He was getting on in years now, and had taken on a junior whom he
  was grooming for partnership and to be his eventual successor. It was this
  comparative youngster whom Carey talked to when she called at the office on
  Forty-Second Street. He was very affable, assuming no doubt that she had come
  to announce herself in the market again for a good play; and this, being good
  business, was good news. But when she said she didn't want a play, but would
  like to talk about Paul Saffron, he assumed the look of someone who, from
  then on, was prepared to listen merely from politeness.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Paul Saffron well?" he asked, which she took to be convincing
  proof of how time could obliterate not only the memory of half a dozen
  successful plays but of gossip also, and even a breath of scandal.</p>

  <p>The irony of it made her answer: "Fairly well. He's one of your clients,
  anyway. Or didn't you realize that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Michaelson used to handle him&mdash;years ago&mdash;I guess
  that's why he still considers himself attached to us. Otherwise I doubt
  whether..."</p>

  <p>"I see." She went on to explain what kind of job Paul wanted, how well
  qualified he was, and how high his reputation had been in Europe before the
  war. "Maybe you've seen his work. I don't think it's an exaggeration to call
  him one of the world's great picture directors."</p>

  <p>She began to dislike the youth for the way he deliberately poker-faced
  before answering. "You really think that, Miss Arundel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do."</p>

  <p>He poker-faced again. "You know, you actresses can sell a lot of things
  &mdash;face cream, lipstick, cigarettes, home permanents, God knows what. But
  there's one thing you can't sell, and that's Paul Saffron."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's a Fascist."</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>"He was mixed up with the Nazis during the war&mdash;did propaganda for
  them or something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's not true! I know there've been all kinds of slanders about
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, all right&mdash;so they're slanders. Maybe. But people believe
  them. And he hasn't enough friends who'll SAY they're slanders. You're the
  first I've come across."</p>

  <p>They were still in the argument when Michaelson entered. He and Carey were
  old friends and greeted each other affectionately. He introduced her formally
  to the youth, mentioning the latter as "a bright lad... I hope he's been
  telling you how glad we'll be if you're after another play."</p>

  <p>"I'm not, Micky. I came to talk about Paul&mdash;your bright lad didn't
  know he was once my husband."</p>

  <p>The youth was not in the least discomfited. "I knew, Miss Arundel, but I
  thought I could be franker with you if I pretended I didn't."</p>

  <p>He left the room, at a signal from Michaelson. She said, ruefully: "So I
  guess he IS a bright lad."</p>

  <p>"Sure... Now what is it about Paul?"</p>

  <p>She went through the whole thing again, but to a kindlier audience. At the
  end he said: "Well, Carey, what Joe told you wasn't far off the mark. It's
  going to be pretty hard to sell Paul anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Because of the lies that are going around?"</p>

  <p>"Partly that. And also because Hollywood has 'em all listed either hot or
  cold, and Paul's like ice&mdash;at the moment. Now if it were you, I could
  make a deal by picking up the phone. You don't know how many enquiries I've
  had&mdash;I don't even bother you about them, because I know how you feel.
  Look, I say to them, Miss Arundel isn't interested in pictures, she's married
  to a millionaire, you just haven't an angle with her... But you're hot,
  Carey. I think I could ask a hundred thousand for one picture and no
  quibbling."</p>

  <p>"Micky, let's get back to Paul. He'll go to pieces if he doesn't find a
  job soon. They must know his pictures made money in Europe."</p>

  <p>"Most of them don't know and none of them care."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they take more notice of the lies put out by enemies."</p>

  <p>"Look, Carey, it isn't only that. Paul has a reputation for being
  difficult, and there's nothing worse when you want a job. People who ever
  worked with him don't forget what he was like&mdash;he's not a man you CAN
  forget. If he were on top, they'd all say what a wonderful experience they
  had, but now he's out, so they all say what a son of a bitch he was. And he
  was too, let's face it. I used to quarrel with him so many times I lost
  count, and when he called on me recently after he got back from Europe he was
  just as impossible as ever. How he managed to make pictures for the Germans
  I'll never know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He didn't. That's one of the lies, Micky&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I meant BEFORE the war&mdash;don't get so excited. The good pictures he
  made&mdash;they were for the Germans, weren't they?"</p>

  <p>"They were for the world."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, he made them in Germany, they were German language films
  &mdash;nothing wrong about that, mind you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, of course. I'm being silly. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I understand. You like the fellow. So do I&mdash;in a way. But as I
  said, I've often wondered how he managed to get on with them over there.
  Maybe it's what they go for&mdash;the Wagner type. Highbrows and
  headaches."</p>

  <p>"No, Micky, that's wrong too. He's not highbrow. His pictures have been
  POPULAR."</p>

  <p>"Not in Paducah, Kentucky. That's the hurdle he has to cross."</p>

  <p>"So you think there's nothing can be done?"</p>

  <p>"I should say at present, not a thing. Unless you want me to fix up a
  package deal for both of you? Then somebody would have to take the pill to
  get the jam."</p>

  <p>He had said this as a joke to lighten the tension on Carey's face; and she
  did indeed respond, but he saw the laugh drain away into a look of different
  tension. She said quietly: "Could you really make a deal like that with
  someone in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. You can make any kind of deal if you have something to offer that
  somebody wants. During the liquor shortage I once sold an actor because I
  could throw in a dozen cases of Scotch."</p>

  <p>"Well... go ahead and sell Paul along with me."</p>

  <p>"You're not serious?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>From habit he pulled a pencil and scratch-pad towards him, then pushed
  them away again. "No, I won't need to remind myself of this. You're sure it's
  not a gag?"</p>

  <p>"I'm serious," she assured him again.</p>

  <p>They discussed details, and just before she left his office he said: "Your
  personal affairs are none of my business, Carey, but it's only fair to
  mention one thing... people are going to draw a certain conclusion from all
  this."</p>

  <p>"That I'm doing it to get Paul a job? I don't see why they'll know that if
  you don't tell them."</p>

  <p>"It'll leak out from the other end, you bet... but that wasn't what I
  meant. The big conclusion they'll draw is that you're leaving your husband
  and going back to Paul."</p>

  <p>That startled her. "Yes, I suppose they will. It's not true, but I can't
  help it... It's NOT true, Micky&mdash;it's almost comic, when I think of it.
  I could never go back to Paul. You believe me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why not, if you say so? But who else will?"</p>

  <p>"Then I don't care. It's no worse&mdash;and no less absurd&mdash;than the
  other rumour."</p>

  <p>Michaelson walked with her along the corridor to the elevator, and as the
  pointer swung to their floor number he said: "I know you're serious, and I'm
  itching to get at the phone, but I'll wait for one hour... exactly... in case
  you change your mind."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later she was with Paul. "Now for heaven's sake don't YOU
  back out..." she exclaimed, watching his face as she gave him the news, but
  to her relief he seemed delighted and especially because he would now, he
  said, have a chance to make a movie star out of her. "You remember I always
  promised I would, Carey? You have a good face&mdash;the right profile
  slightly better than the left. I'd like to cast you as an old lady&mdash;
  you'd be beautiful with just a few wrinkles here&mdash;and here&mdash;" He
  touched her with his finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"Well, thanks, but I'm pretty sure you won't have a chance. They'll give
  you a certain picture to make and you'll have to make it. There'll also be a
  story, whether you like it or not, and there'll be a producer to decide how
  much you spend, and a camera-man who'll think he knows more about angles than
  you do, and a writer or writers to do the script... Micky told me all this,
  and I'm passing it on to you now, so that you know the worst." (It occurred
  to her then that it hadn't been at all a bad idea of Michaelson's to wait for
  that full hour.) "But there's also good news, Paul&mdash;and the best of all
  is that you'll have your chance, and it'll be a big one, because it's bound
  to be an important picture if anybody's willing to pay so much for me in
  it."</p>

  <p>"What will they pay for you, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Micky thinks he can get a hundred thousand."</p>

  <p>"Ridiculous," Paul muttered, under his breath, and then added,
  thoughtfully: "But of course that's for you and me together."</p>

  <p>"I expect so," she agreed tactfully.</p>

  <p>The full hour passed, after which she returned to the house. Austen was
  out, and Norris, she learned, had gone to the Museum of Modern Art. She told
  Richards, with an exhilarating sense of freedom: "Any time, if there's a call
  for me from a Mr. Michaelson, I'll take it."</p>

  <p>There was no call that day, or the next, but the following morning she
  talked to the agent from her bedroom while Austen was dressing. "I haven't
  clinched anything yet, but you're hot, Carey, same as I told you. We were
  batting it out all day yesterday. Better drop by my office later and we'll
  talk over what's happened."</p>

  <p>She said she would, then hung up. She knew that Austen had heard enough to
  wonder who it was she had agreed to meet, but of course he was too polite to
  ask and she felt it would have been challenging to tell him.</p>

  <p>By the time she reached Michaelson's office there was a tentative deal to
  be discussed. It was with Majestic Pictures, not the biggest studio, and
  possibly not the best, if there were a best, but recommendable if only
  because it had shown the greatest interest and been the first to make a firm
  offer. On the whole, though, Michaelson seemed a little disappointed. "I
  could have sold you to any of the studios," he said "except for Paul. Even
  the jam wouldn't cover that pill, with some of them. And when I named my
  price to Majestic they didn't even flinch till I said he had to be in the
  deal. Then they started to hum and ha. They had their own directors, didn't
  need another&mdash;all that sort of thing... By the way, how much do you
  think he should get?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know, Micky, that's your province."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand?"</p>

  <p>"For the whole job?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"A hundred for me and ten for him... he'd be pretty mad, but I suppose
  he'd have to take it. I thought a director would get more, though."</p>

  <p>"Most of them do. But Majestic already have their own directors, that's
  what they kept telling me. What would you say to Paul being brought in as a
  technical adviser&mdash;wouldn't mean such hard work for him&mdash; probably
  not much at all&mdash;and he'd get the cash just the same?... I presume what
  you really want is to help him financially without getting into any tax
  situation."</p>

  <p>"And he wouldn't direct the picture?"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't have to."</p>

  <p>"But he MUST&mdash;I want him to&mdash;that's the whole point. It isn't
  just a question of money."</p>

  <p>"I see. I told them I thought that might be your attitude... Still, don't
  worry. I can make a deal on those lines, but it won't be such a good
  one."</p>

  <p>"Micky, don't you see what I'm after? I want Paul to get established in
  the kind of work he can do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know. All right. That's how it shall be then. Seventy-five
  for you and ten for Paul as director&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought you said a hundred for me? Not that I care particularly&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>Michaelson scribbled figures on his pad as if they were too difficult to
  work out mentally. "I could hold out for a hundred, Carey, and I'm certain I
  could get it&mdash;if you'd settle for Paul on a technical adviser basis.
  Otherwise..."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "I see. Seventy-five's okay."</p>

  <p>He smiled back. "You think he's worth the difference?"</p>

  <p>She kept on smiling. "The difference less a whole lot of income-tax. Yes,
  I'll sign. The main things are the details. I want you to protect him all you
  can&mdash;in case they want to put him off halfway through or something."</p>

  <p>He kept on smiling. "Seems like we're both expecting trouble with that
  guy."</p>

  <p>"An old habit of mine, Micky. Do your best for him. I don't know what you
  can ask in the way of authority or control&mdash;probably not much. But try
  to get the limit. I'll be out there to smooth things. I haven't met many
  picture people, but I guess they're human."</p>

  <p>"Very. Human enough to be your admirers." He beamed with gallantry, then
  became businesslike. "So you approve the deal I've outlined?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you think he'll approve it too?"</p>

  <p>"My God, he'd better."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he could drop by and see me himself. We'll roll out a bit of red
  carpet."</p>

  <p>"Let me talk to him again first. How long before we sign?"</p>

  <p>"It'll take a week or so to set the thing up." Michaelson continued, on
  the way to the elevator: "As I thought, they all took it as proof you were
  going back to him. I told them you weren't, but they offered me odds on it.
  So what would probably have been only in Variety&mdash;I mean, about the
  contract&mdash;may hit the gossip columns. If it does, remember it's not my
  fault&mdash;I warned you of a leak from the other end. Hollywood's one big
  leak&mdash;you'll find that out."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She knew then she must tell Austen without delay, for it
would be
  unthinkable to let him hear or read of it.</p>

  <p>She told him that night, after they had left Norris, and while he was
  mixing his customary nightcap. After considering all kinds of excuses and
  evasions, she finally decided on the plain truth. She said she had been
  offered a good contract to make a picture in Hollywood with Paul directing,
  and she had accepted. She explained the nature of the deal and spared none of
  the details of Paul's unpopularity and the unlikelihood of his ever getting a
  job without herself as bait. "It's his last chance," she said, perhaps over-
  severely, as if he were a bad boy whom she had to discipline. "I'm giving it
  to him not because he deserves it but because I think he's good in his own
  line&mdash;too good to be allowed to go on being unlucky for the rest of his
  life. As for myself, I'm not specially anxious to be in a picture, though I
  dare say it'll be interesting, but however it turns out I certainly don't
  plan a new career. It's just this once. I want you to know that."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a long while after she had first thought she had
  finished. She kept remembering additional details and adding them, but still
  he was silent. Then he went to the decanter and poured himself another
  drink.</p>

  <p>He said at length: "I don't want you to do it at all."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Austen. I was afraid it wouldn't please you, but I wish you
  could realize that I feel I have to."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you feel you have to do anything unless it's what you
  want."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose it's true that I want to do it."</p>

  <p>"As I thought." His voice was quietly strained. "So for this desire, or
  compulsion, or sense of obligation&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;you're ready to
  break up all we have here together..."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, no&mdash;why?&mdash;why should that happen? Surely it has nothing
  to do with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Carey, it's come to the point I hoped it never would&mdash;I've got to
  tell you what I really think of Paul. Discount some of it, but not much,
  because I hate him. He's the only person I've ever hated. And it's for one
  reason only&mdash;that he not only drove you half out of your mind when he
  was with you, but he hasn't let you alone since. The mere thought of him
  &mdash;his very existence anywhere&mdash;can threaten your happiness and
  therefore mine. I've known that for a long time."</p>

  <p>"You're really exaggerating, Austen. He never drove me half out of my
  mind."</p>

  <p>"You should have seen yourself when I met you. It's what first made me
  notice you&mdash;because I'm not normally the sort of person who picks up
  strange actresses on shipboard." He smiled a wintry smile. "But that broken
  look you had, the look of being utterly lost and spiritless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember it was as bad as that."</p>

  <p>"You don't? Then that's what living a sane life these last fifteen years
  has done&mdash;the life you're now planning to give up. Perhaps you don't
  remember the nervous wreck you were while you were rehearsing that play?"</p>

  <p>"The one that flopped? Oh, heavens, yes, but you can't blame that on Paul.
  He'd never have let me do it if he'd been around."</p>

  <p>"But he wasn't around, was he, and that's the point... that he'd deserted
  you and you were like a drowning person all that time. Fortunately&mdash;by
  some miracle&mdash;you began to learn to swim on your own."</p>

  <p>"With you to help me, Austen, I admit that."</p>

  <p>"I don't want your admission as if it were only my due. I want you to stay
  here, with me, for your own sake and mine, and I don't want you ever to see
  or communicate with Paul again. I can't put it straighter than that."</p>

  <p>Because he was not a man to plead, the note in his voice embarrassed her,
  as if she were eavesdropping on something unseemly. She knew he was genuinely
  trying to master his emotion and not, as an actor might, to exhibit it with
  an appearance of struggle for concealment. She began tidying things on her
  dressing-table, to ease both of them through a bad moment; and suddenly, as
  in times of crisis before, the sense of dual personality came on her and she
  herself was acting, Carey Arundel playing the part of the second Mrs.
  Bond.</p>

  <p>"But it's all fixed up, Austen."</p>

  <p>"Then unfix it. Change your mind&mdash;break your word if necessary. And
  if you've signed anything, leave that to me."</p>

  <p>"I haven't signed anything yet. But it's all fixed up."</p>

  <p>"You're afraid he'll try to hold you to a promise? Leave that to me
  too."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that at all. As a matter of fact HE had to be persuaded, not I.
  It's just that I WANT him to do this job and he can't get it unless I'm in
  the thing too. They wouldn't take him without me. I explained it all just
  now."</p>

  <p>"So you really intend to go on with this?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. I'm sorry, Austen."</p>

  <p>He came over to her and touched her shoulder. She felt his hand cold. She
  saw how pale he was, the grey look of misery, and when she reached up to
  touch his hand it was icy. "It doesn't mean any break between you and me,"
  she said with kindness. "At least I don't know why it should."</p>

  <p>"Carey, how can you SAY that? How can you think of DOING this? How COULD
  you?" He seemed brought up against an impasse of incredibility. "Without even
  consulting me... I can't understand it..."</p>

  <p>"It's my work, Austen, if you argue it out on those lines. I never
  promised I'd give it up for good. I don't want to do it all the time&mdash;
  you know that&mdash;but I can't think of it as something you have a right to
  veto."</p>

  <p>"I've never tried to, when it was the work itself you wanted. But HE'S
  your reason now. You've been frank enough to say so. And he'll ruin you.
  He'll wear you out again&mdash;and you're older, you won't be able to stand
  it. He CONSUMES&mdash;you used that word once yourself. And he has no
  loyalty, nor integrity, nor even common fairness. As you say, you don't
  remember those things now. There are things you probably don't even know
  of... all the time he was refusing you a divorce, for instance, he was living
  with a German girl&mdash;a film actress..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was he? A beautiful girl, I met her. Doesn't surprise me&mdash;I
  suspected it all along. But how did YOU know?"</p>

  <p>He answered grimly: "I had him watched."</p>

  <p>It was his mistake to have said that. It threw her into a different
  mood.</p>

  <p>"Really, Austen? As simple as that? You just had him watched?"</p>

  <p>"I thought we might need the information legally, but it turned out we
  didn't and I was glad. I never intended to tell you anything about it, unless
  I had to, and for all these years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've kept the secret! That was rather wonderful, after having him
  watched. Do you often have people watched?"</p>

  <p>"CAREY!"</p>

  <p>"Have you ever had ME watched?" She was relieved to be able to laugh. "But
  of course you have&mdash;Richards watches me, and Foster, and Flossie
  &mdash;you don't suppose I haven't noticed, do you? It's your way&mdash; you
  think it's safer than trusting people. So do please have me watched in
  Hollywood&mdash;you have contacts there, I'm sure. It won't cause me any
  trouble, because I won't be having an affair with anybody, not even my
  ex-husband. I'm really telling you the truth&mdash;there's not love of that
  kind between me and Paul."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'm just as jealous of any other kind, whatever it is."</p>

  <p>"The kind that hired watchers couldn't give you evidence about?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Carey, why are you so bitter? Have I ever done you any wrong?"</p>

  <p>She knew it was because he hadn't that she was bitter, if at all. "Let's
  not talk any more tonight, Austen. I hate arguments and I know you do
  too."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing more to say, now that we've both spoken our minds. You've
  told me you intend to do what you want. So shall I&mdash;as soon as I know
  what it is. I don't&mdash;yet. I'm too shocked&mdash;not by the thing itself
  but by your reason for doing it&mdash;the proof it gives of how little I mean
  to you, and not only I, but your home here... and Norris. What's going to
  happen to that boy after you've gone? He worships you&mdash; you've been part
  of his cure since he came back&mdash;he depends on you... but I suppose all
  that counts for nothing also."</p>

  <p>His mention of Norris brought her to the limit of endurance. "Norris will
  be all right," she answered unevenly. "I'm not as necessary for him as you
  think."</p>

  <p>"But you ARE&mdash;you always have been&mdash;you're the only one who can
  talk sense to him! He has a preposterous idea of taking up medicine and going
  out to some island as a resident doctor&mdash;did you know that? &mdash;the
  whole thing is fantastic&mdash;it would take years to qualify and by that
  time, anyhow... but it shows the state of his mind&mdash;it shows how much he
  needs your advice and influence, since he won't accept mine. And this is the
  moment you choose to leave him!"</p>

  <p>He walked out of the room without waiting for a reply, even if she could
  have made one. It was the first time she had seen him beyond control.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning at breakfast both of them, for Norris's
sake, tried to
  behave as if nothing was amiss. She thought she herself was acting well
  enough, but Austen, though he clearly did his best, could not match her, and
  there was a noticeable tension in his manner that made Norris, after his
  father had gone to the office, remark to Carey: "What's on his mind? A new
  billion dollar loan or something?"</p>

  <p>She felt sorry for Austen and therefore hurt by Norris's flippancy; she
  said: "He has personal worries, Norris."</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?"</p>

  <p>She suddenly decided to tell him the truth then, instead of later, partly
  because she was no longer sure she could keep up a pretence, partly also from
  an urge to discover his reaction. So she told him, explaining the thing
  pretty much as she had done to Austen. When she had finished he was silent
  for a moment, then said: "So THAT'S what was bothering him."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That and your own idea."</p>

  <p>"MY idea?" He started in alarm. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The tropical medicine. He doesn't like either of our ideas."</p>

  <p>"My God, Carey, you didn't tell him THAT? What on earth made you&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't, but he KNEW&mdash;he mentioned it to me and I was a
  bit surprised to think that YOU'D told him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As if I should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then... how on earth could he know?"</p>

  <p>He replied after a pause, with the schoolboy sarcasm that she knew
  disguised his emotions so often: "I suppose there are several ways. First, he
  might have heard us during the bridge game. But I rather doubt that&mdash; we
  talked too quietly. Second, Richards might have been eavesdropping after he
  brought in the drinks. But I rather doubt that too&mdash;I had my eye on him.
  Thirdly, either of them might have seen the letter I wrote to Columbia. Yes,
  on the whole, I think that's the likeliest. I left the letter on the hall
  table to be picked up with the other mail. Somehow I didn't think...
  LETTERS."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Norris, I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Hardly YOUR fault."</p>

  <p>"I think perhaps it is, in a way."</p>

  <p>"That father sets up a spy system? I don't get it. You never promised him
  you'd drop your profession altogether. At least that's what you once told
  me."</p>

  <p>"No, but that's not my real reason. I told you my real reason just
  now."</p>

  <p>He said, after a silence: "Well, I never met the guy, so I can't say
  whether I think he's worth it."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he isn't. It isn't personal, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know. That's why I can't blame your father for not quite
  sizing it up. I can't blame anybody. Not even myself. It's my fault, but I
  don't blame myself for it. Does that give any clue?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "He must mean a lot to you..."</p>

  <p>"Which of them are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Paul." He went on smiling. "This is a funny conversation. I still say,
  though, he must mean a lot to you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know... I don't know WHAT he means."</p>

  <p>"But you're looking forward to the excitement of working with him again.
  I'll bet you are."</p>

  <p>She looked up, transfixed with a certain incredulity. "Looking forward to
  it? You really think that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Norris, I'm DREADING it."</p>

  <p>"Then why do it?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>"There we are again."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You just HAVE to do it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in a sort of way."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I know how you feel. We're both built a bit like that. You facing
  your ordeal and I... if I can find one worth facing..."</p>

  <p>"I hope you can, Norris. And I hope it isn't too much of an ordeal. Mine
  won't be more than I can help. I shall do my best to enjoy a new
  experience."</p>

  <p>"You make it sound like a school teacher visiting the Carlsbad
  Caverns."</p>

  <p>"Now whatever made you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm trying hard not to be serious. You once asked me not to be. Now I ask
  you not to be. Let's have a good time till you leave&mdash;just a hell of a
  good time, as if we hadn't anything on OUR minds... do you think we
  could?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try."</p>

  <p>And indeed a curious tranquillity settled on them both as they went about
  together during the days that followed. They had the good time, doing nothing
  specially new, just the things that had by then become routine. To Carey the
  whole interval had a quality of swanlike timelessness, as if anchored neither
  to past nor future. She thought of a river above a fall, the water rolling
  deep and unknowing.</p>

  <p>Not till the last day was Paul mentioned again, and then quite casually by
  her. It was in her room, amidst the confusion of packing, that he exclaimed:
  "Carey, I said it before and I'll say it again&mdash;you'll be a big success
  in films. You'll photograph like an angel."</p>

  <p>"Paul says the left profile isn't quite so good."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he does, does he? Perfectionist. I'll bet he doesn't understand you
  half as well as I do."</p>

  <p>"In some ways he doesn't understand me at all."</p>

  <p>"No? Really? I'd like to meet that guy some time."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you will." She laughed, but nervously, as if the thought gave her a
  mixture of fear and pleasure. "It's too bad I once told him you were a
  writer. He hates writers. But perhaps by that time you'll be a doctor."</p>

  <p>The maid entered with extra things to be packed, and there was no more
  chance to talk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the train to Chicago she had a moment of supreme
dejection when she
  wondered if she were doing the most foolish thing of her life. At the peak of
  misgiving she would have gone back, no matter at what cost in surrender or
  complication, but of course it was impossible, and the moment passed.</p>

  <p>She had waved through the window at Grand Central and seen father and son
  standing together as the train moved out. There had also been a photographer
  from the New York office of Majestic Pictures. She had posed for him on the
  platform and he had wanted to take the three of them in a group, but Austen,
  with his usual phobia about publicity, had curtly declined. Or had his reason
  been only that? It would have been a good way to contradict the rumours
  already in circulation, if he had wanted to. She could not read into Austen's
  mind, and she realized now that she had never been able to, completely.</p>

  <p>Soon it was evening and she felt less troubled&mdash;she could enjoy the
  cosiness of the drawing-room, the lights of the little towns as they flashed
  by, the glances of fellow-passengers in the diner, some of whom doubtless
  recognized her. She went to bed early and slept fairly well, and in the
  morning, after the transfer at Chicago, settled down to a couple of usefully
  contemplative days alone. It was for this reason she had not travelled by air
  or with Paul. He was to fly out in time to meet her, possibly at the train
  when she arrived.</p>

  <p>As the miles passed and she stared out of the window for long stretches,
  it seemed to her that she remembered more than she observed, for it was over
  twenty years since she had made this same westward journey, but then by road,
  with Paul, in a model-T Ford. She herself had driven, and in those days it
  had not been such an easy trip&mdash;long spells of dirt road between towns,
  changing tyres in the dust, the radiator boiling over on mountain grades,
  nights spent in cheap hotels, sometimes in the car to save a dollar. But to
  her (as that vacation in Ireland to Norris) the whole experience was deep in
  the mythology of the heart... the tree-shaded towns of Ohio, a whiff of snow
  in Kansas, sunrise on the redlands of Arizona. And now the air-conditioned
  luxury of the Super-Chief was the measure of the years of change.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="part5"
     id="part5">PART FIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One day about half-way through the shooting of Morning
  Journey the leading man, Greg Wilson, called Carey to come and look at what
  was going on. She had been resting during a scene in which she did not
  appear, and the portable dressing-room, tucked away in the corner of the big
  stage, had a privacy that no one would wantonly disturb. But Greg, whom she
  had come to like during their work together, evidently thought the reason
  good enough. At first glance nothing was unusual. There had been one take
  already and there was to be another. Technicians were checking the lights;
  the camera was being reloaded; the customary appearance of noisy chaos was in
  full show. Paul had slumped in the canvas chair, his head sunk forward as if
  he were half asleep &mdash;a characteristic attitude that often concealed a
  sharp scrutiny of what was in progress. Greg, ill-clothed and unkempt for his
  part, looked very different from the hero of his usual type of film, and
  clearly he was excited at the difference and a little vain of himself. Two
  other actors, one a girl, were also waiting to begin. The scene was the
  interior of a country cottage, nothing special or expensive about it.</p>

  <p>Paul said something and the bell rang for silence.</p>

  <p>"Well, here we go," Greg whispered to Carey. "Watch me&mdash;I'm good, but
  watch Barrington too&mdash;he's better."</p>

  <p>Carey watched. Morning Journey was really nothing but a cops and robbers
  picture (as Paul had said scornfully at the outset), and any similarity
  between itself and life would, in the ordinary way, have been purely
  detrimental. However, once Paul had schooled himself to the actual job of
  shooting, the usual change in his attitude took place; Morning Journey became
  then contemptible only to the extent that it owed its origin to a mediocre
  novel and its later shape to a couple of script writers. There was, of
  course, the permanent slur (liable to be brought up at any moment in any
  argument) of its being a Majestic picture and therefore a victim of over-all
  and predestined contamination. The odd thing was that with all this Paul
  managed to combine a tremendous intention of his own to make every scene as
  good as he knew how, and an overmastering pride in every fragment of his
  work. The result was something in which life-likeness, if not life itself,
  sneaked in by all kinds of crannies; or, to quote a later critic who was
  mainly hostile, the picture was full of "directorial flourishes". It was one
  of these that Greg had called on Carey to witness. The opening situation was
  simple: at night two escaping prisoners-of-war approach a woodcutter's
  cottage high in the Bavarian Alps. The men are weary and famished, almost
  ready to give themselves up; in this mood they enter the cottage seeking food
  and shelter. To their astonishment they encounter no one, though lamps are
  lit, there is a fire burning, and a table is set for a meal. The men fall to
  on what is to hand&mdash;hunks of bread and cheese and pitchers of milk;
  then, with the edge of hunger dulled, they become aware that there IS someone
  else. They hear footsteps and a girl's voice singing. They stand transfixed
  when the door opens and the girl, beautiful of course, brings in more food
  for the table. Amazingly she does not seem to notice them, though they have
  had no time to hide. The men are desperately uncertain what to do. Should
  they seize her, gag her, and tie her up, so that she cannot give the alarm
  till they are well away? Or should they throw themselves on her mercy? One of
  the men (Greg), realizing the truth sooner than the other, covers his
  companion's mouth in a frantic signal for silence. FOR THE GIRL IS BLIND. But
  already she has HEARD. They try to edge towards the door while she greets
  them cheerfully: "Hello. Sit down and have some food. Who are you? How many
  are there of you? Did you find them yet? They're probably across the border
  by now. Did you meet my father?&mdash;he said he'd climb to the ridge." The
  men dare not speak and their silence puzzles her. First she thinks it is a
  joke. "Hans, I know it's you&mdash;answer me&mdash;stop being silly. Who is
  it with you?" All at once, in the continuing silence, panic is born and she
  suspects the truth&mdash;that the intruders are not the pursuers, but the
  pursued. Her aim is then as much to escape as theirs is, and in rushing out
  of the room she stumbles over a chair. The second man, with instinctive
  kindliness, takes a step to help her, but has to be restrained by Greg. Once
  outside the room the girl screams for help while the two men make their exit
  from a side window.</p>

  <p>A remarkable scene, if only because the star of the picture had nothing to
  say in it. But two other things made it equally remarkable. One was the
  almost intolerable suspense, the ballet-like dumb show of the two fugitives
  counter-pointing the fluttering rhythms of the blind girl. The other was the
  identity of the actor sharing the dumb show with Greg. He was Jerry
  Barrington, an old-timer from silent-picture days, whose failing (apart from
  drink) had always been regarded as an invincible inability to speak lines.
  But now, in a rather unexampled way, he did not have to speak lines. It was
  really very fortunate for the picture. Yet that impulse of his to help the
  blind girl when she stumbled had had a rare beauty in it, something that had
  momentarily transfigured the face and movements of a rather second-rate
  performer.</p>

  <p>Yet another point might have been noted&mdash;that the scene bore small
  resemblance to anything in the script, in whose mimeographed pages the girl
  had not been blind, and the men, before they could fill their pockets with
  food and get away, had had to dodge in and out of rooms like erring husbands
  in a French farce.</p>

  <p>After the word "Cut" there was a spell of continued tension as if even
  hard-boiled technicians were impressed; then Paul added: "Print the first
  one," and everybody laughed. Already he had become somewhat notorious for
  saying that.</p>

  <p>Greg joined Carey at the edge of the suddenly unloosed commotion; Paul was
  already talking to the camera-man about the next scene.</p>

  <p>"How does he do it?" Greg exclaimed. "An old ham like Barrington..."</p>

  <p>Carey said: "I've never seen Barrington before."</p>

  <p>"That's the point. Nobody's ever seen him before... How does he do it?
  Paul, I mean."</p>

  <p>She said: "It was the same in the theatre. He had a way of getting things
  out of people."</p>

  <p>Greg nodded. "Now go back and finish your nap. We shan't be wanted for
  another hour at least."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you fetched me, Greg. It's a wonderful scene. Who changed it
  this way?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you guess? The writers haven't been near the place. They'll
  probably kick when they find out, unless they know a good thing when they see
  it, and who does, when it's somebody else's?"</p>

  <p>"Did Randolph approve?"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't have been given a chance only he happened to come on the set
  while the whole thing was being cooked up and re-rehearsed. I don't think he
  really liked it. He finds it hard to like anything that Paul does at the last
  minute without consulting him. But the big row was because Paul wanted the
  girl to speak in German&mdash;said it was more natural and the words
  themselves didn't matter&mdash;the voice would give the meaning. Of course
  Randy wouldn't stand for that, and Paul had to give in. The rest he did the
  way he wanted it." Greg laughed. "What a way to make a picture! And yet WHAT
  a way&mdash;if you can do it!"</p>

  <p>She had already admitted Greg to full membership in the conspiracy of
  those who knew the formula derived from measuring Paul's faults against his
  virtues.</p>

  <p>"Personally," she said, "I agree with Randolph about the German. Paul goes
  overboard sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Ninety per cent of Paul and ten per cent of Randy make a good
  mixture."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll drop by and talk to him before I go home. Perhaps I can
  smooth matters down a bit."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't do any harm. He likes YOU."</p>

  <p>So she called at Randolph's office before leaving the studio that evening.
  She didn't defend the changed scene, but chatted about it in a seemingly
  impartial way and somehow conveyed her own satisfaction with the progress of
  the picture as a whole. Randolph, frosty at first, thawed under her influence
  till at last he admitted that some of the scenes LOOKED all right. The test,
  of course, would be in the public's reception. He was a tall dome-headed
  tweedy fellow in his late fifties, as proud of his Bond Street shoes as he
  was of his hundred-odd pictures that, over a period of twenty years, had
  earned fabulous profits without ever collecting a single award or
  distinction. He was not cynical about this, merely matter of fact.
  Picture-making was an industry; art was all right, but it usually did not
  pay. If by chance it did, it was either a fluke, or else the artist involved
  had been kept in careful check by men of proved experience. He himself was a
  man of proved experience and he was determined to keep Saffron in check, but
  Saffron, being not only an artist but also a so-and-so, was harder to check
  than most artists. This was his attitude, which he did not put into words,
  but which Carey understood perfectly. She had even a certain amount of
  sympathy&mdash;not with it, but with him, for Paul's habit of rewriting
  scenes at the last minute was really inexcusable. But then Paul had found
  many other things inexcusable. His first big row with Randolph had occurred
  after the first day's shooting when the two of them, along with Carey, Greg
  Wilson, and a fourth man, had sat in the back row of a projection-room to see
  the rushes. The fourth man, introduced indistinctly, was ignored until
  Randolph suddenly addressed him across the others. "Cut from where the girl
  enters the room to the long shot of the cab arriving. Then go to the two-shot
  inside the cab." Paul rose from his seat immediately. "What's going on? Are
  you joking? Who is this fellow?" The fourth man, who had been taking notes,
  was then solemnly reintroduced as a cutter. Paul erupted for about ten
  minutes. It was then explained to him that Majestic Pictures Incorporated
  employed producers to produce, directors to direct, and cutters to cut. Paul
  said he would do his own cutting or quit. He had had to concede control of
  production, casting, and music, but there was a limit beyond which he would
  not surrender. The argument continued in the darkened projection-room until
  Randolph was fuming and Paul had begun to inveigh against the entire output
  of Majestic Pictures, hardly any of which he had seen. The cutter sat silent,
  aware that his salary did not entitle him to an opinion. In the end the
  matter was left somewhat undecided, with Carey and Greg appealing to both
  sides to wait till the picture was finished before any cutting was done at
  all. "If it's good," she said, "surely it won't be hard then to agree on the
  details." This may not have made much sense (since it would always be hard
  for Paul to agree with anyone else on anything), but it provided a needed
  excuse for shelving the issue; but of course Randolph hated Paul from then
  on, and Paul, who already hated Randolph, began a grim accumulation of
  ammunition for the eventual fight. One of his procedures was to see earlier
  pictures that Randolph had produced, whenever the chance occurred, and gloat
  over the details of their badness.</p>

  <p>There were other troubles. Randolph's way of shooting a picture (he had
  been a director himself in his time) was to make a long master-shot of
  everything in a scene, then break it up into medium and close shots,
  'favouring' the star&mdash;for naturally, under the star system, who else
  could be 'favoured'? The final jigsaw was then assembled in the cutting-room,
  where, if any supporting actors were so good that they drew too much
  attention, the error could be corrected by blanketing their voices against
  the star's close-up. This had been done so often in all Majestic pictures
  that it had become a formula which Randolph took for granted; even to
  question it seemed slightly impious. Paul not only questioned it, he called
  it nonsense. First, he did not believe in master-shots, and he hated
  close-ups of faces while other actors were speaking. And he liked the camera
  to move, not to chop and change from one fixed position to another. Nor did
  he believe a scene could be stolen except by what deserved to steal it
  &mdash;which was good acting against bad acting. He thought Greg Wilson, for
  instance, was a pretty bad actor, and hadn't wanted him in the picture at
  all. Randolph, however, knew that Carey had no following among movie-goers,
  and had insisted on casting Majestic's biggest box-office name opposite her.
  Carey was prepared to agree that in this Randolph might be wise, but Paul
  resented it until one day Greg told Paul that no director he had ever
  experienced had done so well with him. This flattered Paul and made him think
  Greg not nearly as bad, which was the necessary self-hypnosis before Paul
  could make him, as he presently did, rather surprisingly adequate.</p>

  <p>As for Carey herself, her introduction to a new technique of acting, if it
  were such, seemed less significant than a return to the discipline of working
  with Paul. After an anguished rehearsal of the first scene, she wondered what
  had ever possessed her to undertake a renewal of this ordeal voluntarily; a
  hundred memories assailed her, mostly of similar anguish when she had been
  unable to please him during stage rehearsals; she might have guessed he would
  have become no more indulgent with the years. But then one day while she was
  before the camera in a rather difficult scene, another memory touched her
  &mdash;the renewal of that curious trance-like bliss that told her she was
  ACTING, and with it the renewal of ambition to act, and of the feeling that
  what she was doing mattered by some standard shared by other arts. She tried
  to catch Paul's eye when the scene ended, but he was looking elsewhere; she
  heard, however, the inflection in his voice as he spoke the one word "Print,"
  and in that she had her answer. She felt suddenly radiant. It was all worth
  while. God knew how or why, but it was.</p>

  <p>She could have endured and even come to enjoy the strain of satisfying
  Paul as an actress had there been less to do as trouble-shooter. The ancient
  contrast appeared again in full force&mdash;that most people liked her a
  great deal while few could like Paul except with a degree of partisanship
  that made them just as difficult to handle themselves. (Among these few were
  several actors and a negro set-boy for whom he had performed some unexplained
  kindness.) The trouble was that there were so many more possible antagonisms
  on a movie stage than in a theatre&mdash;so many more rules, written and
  unwritten, to be despised and challenged; so many more taboos to tilt
  against, so many more egos to affront. Typical, perhaps, was the row with the
  musicians. The scene called for Carey to play the piano, which she did on a
  silent keyboard while a professional pianist dubbed in from the background.
  Paul's first complaint was that the pianist played too well; after a second
  try, Paul complained that he played too badly. Paul then went to the piano,
  played the thing himself, and declared himself thoroughly satisfied. "There's
  all the difference," he said, "between a non-professional playing as well as
  he can and a professional deliberately playing less well than he can."
  Perhaps there was, but there also happened to be Petrillo's union that would
  not let Paul play at all. It took an hour or more to convince him that he
  could not fight Petrillo, and several days to appease the musicians who
  considered themselves slighted by the whole incident.</p>

  <p>Then there was his refusal to admit strangers to the set and his rudeness
  to a New York executive (and principal Majestic stockholder) who assumed that
  rules did not apply to him. There were also scenes with the camera-man, who
  regarded his machine as a Copernican sun round which the picture should
  revolve, whereas to Paul it was an Einsteinian eye that must move relatively
  to the actors all the time. Furthermore, Paul wanted to select the lens and
  teach the man his job; as he was a veteran who had worked for Essanay in
  nickelodeon days he took this very ill indeed, and the fact that Paul knew
  all the mechanics of camera work did not mollify him. The sultriest arguments
  they had were over Paul's frequent use of dolly and boom, which caused extra
  trouble and higher costs. Yet in another way Paul's methods were too
  economical to be popular; both camera crew and stage-hands liked a director
  whose many takes gave them plenty of idleness on the set. But Paul was often
  satisfied with the first take, and took a second only for protection. His
  procedure was to rehearse and rehearse, with the camera going through all the
  motions of the shooting and the camera-man doing what he was told instead of
  presiding over a mystery.</p>

  <p>But of all disputes the fiercest were with the writers, since to begin
  with, Paul had disliked both story and script. The former, supposed to be
  based on a novel, had really retained little but the title, and this, for all
  that it signified, might just as well (had they not been used before) have
  been Gone With the Wind or If Winter Comes. As for the script, Paul claimed
  it was intolerably wordy; "Nobody talks like that in life", he kept on
  saying, though with scornful inconsistency he could agree that many people
  did, if they attended movies often enough. A rewrite, made after heated
  conferences, resulted in a second version hardly more to his taste, but by
  that time the shooting date was near and there was no time for a further
  rewrite. Nor, to be frank, was Paul at all anxious to have one. He was
  perfectly satisfied to doctor the script himself as he went along, thinning
  out dialogue, changing background, inventing incidents, introducing new
  facets to character, and generally playing God. The writers had every reason
  to hate him, but since also they were pretty good writers they were even
  fascinated by him a little, as by a cross unlikely to be inflicted on them
  again. One of them took him aside after an especially stormy argument and
  said, almost affectionately: "Look, Mr. Saffron, you haven't been here long
  &mdash;you don't know the way things work. Maybe, as you say, there's too
  much dialogue in pictures, but what the hell do you expect us to do&mdash;
  turn out a script full of stage directions? You know nobody ever takes any
  notice of what a writer wants actors to DO&mdash;only of what he gives them
  to SAY. Ever seen a top executive looking over a script? Unless you can make
  him yell 'Boy, oh boy, what dialogue!' you're out of luck... So you see how
  it is, Mr. Saffron?"</p>

  <p>"All I see," Paul answered, "is that Mendelssohn would have been in
  trouble here for writing Lieder ohne Worte."</p>

  <p>The writers laughed and appreciated him more for this and other sallies
  than he did them for their considerable patience. There was no doubt that he
  had never really liked writers since the day he had ceased to be one himself.
  Of course he would show respect to literary eminence, and in the presence of
  business men he could even feel distant kinship with any writer at all, as
  with any muralist or trumpet player or landscape gardener; but as a rule he
  was on constant guard. Stage playwrights especially he had always been wary
  of, since they had a relatively privileged status and even he could not cut
  and change their work without a semblance of permission. But his more recent
  and heightened hostility had actually sprung from a war-time neurosis; in the
  prison camp he had seen a few writers occasionally writing, and their self-
  containedness, their ability to work with a pencil and a scrap of paper in
  relative secrecy and in disregard of events, had rubbed raw his own grandiose
  frustrations. It was thus in part a pathological grudge, and now the chance
  to pay it off was unique. Always quick to grasp a situation before he knew
  the reasons for it, he had soon sensed that Majestic's professional
  scenarists, even when high-salaried, carried none of the prestige of the
  older kinds of writer; so that at long last he had the breed where he wanted
  it&mdash;in subservience to the over-all authority of the show-maker
  &mdash;i.e. himself. It was the one point on which, without realizing it, he
  was in full agreement with the studio heads&mdash;though they, of course, set
  themselves above him with an equal degree of arrogance.</p>

  <p>Finally, he was at odds with the publicity department and the columnists
  who wrote movie stuff for newspapers and fan magazines. He did not trouble to
  understand their function, but let them know that even if he did he would
  probably despise it. On first reading gossip items that he and Carey were
  contemplating a reconciliation, he had snorted contemptuously, and when asked
  if it were true had denied it with an emphasis that might have sounded
  ungallant had not Carey been with him to laugh and back him up. But of course
  the rumour stayed in circulation, only weakened slightly by an alternative
  theory that Carey was interested in her leading man. She was; she liked Greg
  Wilson very much. They often dined and were seen together.</p>

  <p>Greg was a big, jovial forty-seven, and quite sensationally handsome. By
  careful make-up and constant attention to physique he had been playing parts
  of twenty-five-year-olds so long that there was a certain puppy quality in
  his entire behaviour and personality. Two marriages had failed, possibly
  because he was less exciting in life than on the screen; he had now for
  several years been alone, popular, and extremely eligible. He was also
  Majestic's biggest and therefore most privileged money-maker, playing golf
  with the studio heads and fringeing on the kind of society that did not
  normally admit movie people at all. A likeable fellow, whose love scenes were
  so wooden that women imagined what it must be like to teach him. He found it
  hard to memorize more than a few lines at a time. When it was conveyed to him
  (not over-subtly) that Paul had not wanted him in the picture, he said: "For
  Pete's sake, why should he? I don't blame him." When he met Carey he made it
  almost too clear that he was smitten; actually he wasn't, but he enjoyed
  thinking he was. He had all the bluff open-air reactions to most things that
  his screen characters had&mdash;except one reaction that nobody could have
  foreseen and that had certainly not been foreshadowed in any part he had ever
  played. This was a curious attachment that he developed to Paul. Paul, he
  went around telling people, was the greatest director he had ever known.
  "Look!" he exclaimed, when he saw the daily rushes. "Would you ever believe
  that's ME?" There was something warm and engaging about him, and Carey found
  him a constant ally in her efforts to smooth out troubles that arose from
  Paul's behaviour on and off the set.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Those days of the shooting of Morning Journey passed for
her in a curious
  enclosed dream.</p>

  <p>She heard from Norris&mdash;a warm, friendly note, not very long,
  discussing mostly the books he had been reading, telling little of affairs at
  the house. He mentioned that Austen would soon leave on a business trip to
  South America and had suggested he should go along with him, but he didn't
  know whether he wanted to.</p>

  <p>She wrote a long chatty letter in reply, the kind Austen could see if it
  so happened, describing her work, the progress of the picture, and the life
  she was living. She added that the South American trip sounded exciting,
  maybe it was the sort of change he needed.</p>

  <p>She did not hear from Austen, but to him also she wrote a long chatty
  letter, describing her work, the progress of the picture, and the life she
  was living.</p>

  <p>It was certainly a hard one, much more so than she had expected. She was
  up most mornings by six, to be ready on the set by eight for hair-dressing
  and make-up. Paul was always there by then, having stayed up all night (she
  sometimes concluded) to rewrite the scenes. She and Paul lived in apartments
  several miles from each other; their first meeting of the day was on the
  sound stage, and in the evenings, even if they dined together at a
  restaurant, they rarely said good-night later than ten. On Saturdays she
  allowed herself to accept party invitations; Sunday was a day of rest unless
  Greg Wilson drove her to the mountains or the sea. He bored her a little when
  he talked almost continually about Paul. His favourite remark was that he
  didn't know how two such wonderful people could ever have separated, and once
  he varied this by saying he couldn't understand how she could ever have let
  Paul go.</p>

  <p>"But I didn't let him go," she answered. "He let me go."</p>

  <p>"Oh," Greg exclaimed and was then silent, as if her reply had led him to
  an entirely new train of thought.</p>

  <p>Sometimes during the lunch recess she and Paul would sit in her
  dressing-room with sandwiches and coffee, and this was really the quietest
  time they ever had together, certainly the most intimate. There were few
  places more peaceful than a studio sound stage during this hour-long
  interval; the big lights were out, technicians and actors had all left the
  job, sound-proof doors were closed, the huge building with its high roof,
  dark interior, and mysterious shapes of equipment and scenery had the air of
  a cathedral dedicated to some new and strange religion. Paul was human enough
  then to fall asleep, or smoke his big cigars, or talk of anything that came
  into his head, or even rehearse something privately with her if he wanted.
  And she in turn would hear his complaints, give him advice, and sometimes
  coax him into a more amenable attitude for the afternoon. "Paul," she kept
  saying till it was almost a refrain, "DO remember what a chance you have. I
  know you aren't getting all your own way, but you're getting a lot, and if
  this turns out a good picture you'll be able to ask for much more. DO make
  compromises. You're so good, Paul, you'll have all you want if you'll only
  play your cards properly now."</p>

  <p>He would often talk to her, in staccato and seemingly unrelated snatches,
  about his experiences in Europe, though there was one period he rarely
  mentioned, even inferentially&mdash;and that was his three years in the
  internment camp. Like certain other parts of his life it was clearly destined
  for obliteration in his memory&mdash;the final anathema that his ego
  pronounced on hostile eventfulness. What he did remember, constantly, were
  incidents in earlier films of his that illustrated some point in Morning
  Journey. As he progressed further with the picture and revamped more of it to
  suit himself, it naturally rose in his estimation till he began to feel about
  it almost as he had done about a new play before opening night&mdash;i.e.
  that it was a masterpiece. ALMOST&mdash;but not quite, for the different
  conditions of picture-making involved so many other persons over whom he had
  no control, and whom, therefore, he could not exalt by such comprehensive
  praise.</p>

  <p>A specific scene in Morning Journey called for Carey to show by her
  expression the horror of discovering hate in the eyes of someone she had
  thought loved her&mdash;a difficult emotion, and Paul had rehearsed the scene
  several times without being completely satisfied. During the lunch hour that
  day he told her of a scene in one of his German pictures in which the
  situation was as follows. A wife had been having an affair with a much
  younger man who was already tiring of it. At the crisis of a bitter quarrel,
  the woman turned a revolver on herself; the youth managed to wrest it from
  her and the quarrel then continued more hotly than ever. At a second crisis
  he became so incensed that, still holding the woman's revolver, he pointed it
  at her and pulled the trigger. There was no report, and the woman's eyes
  conveyed what had happened. SHE had known, but HE had not, that the weapon
  was unloaded. SHE had been merely putting on an act to impress him, but HE
  had been actually ready to kill her.</p>

  <p>"I didn't speak much German in those days," Paul added, "and when I
  rehearsed the scene I told the actors to say anything they wanted to make it
  sound like a quarrel. Later on we had a writer, but I never even bothered to
  have his lines translated for me. It was the woman's expression I was aiming
  for&mdash;the awful awareness in it. I got what I wanted too, because she was
  Wanda Hessely and Wanda could do anything. Remember her? You met her at
  Interlaken that time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I'm not as good an actress, you said."</p>

  <p>"That's so. But you're good enough."</p>

  <p>"And her scene was easier."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;just as hard."</p>

  <p>"Anything's easier with guns and things to play with."</p>

  <p>"Try it then."</p>

  <p>"Our scene?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the one she did. I'll play the man. This is your gun." He picked
  up the metal tube that had contained one of his big cigars. "Adlib the
  dialogue&mdash;anything... let's go... Why not? Can't do any harm."</p>

  <p>They went through the scene after a fashion, but Carey was less adept at
  improvising dialogue than Paul, and it struck her amidst her own difficulty
  that in adlibbing a quarrel he was very much on his home ground. The whole
  experiment was not very satisfactory and they ended by laughing. "Maybe it's
  helped, though," Paul said.</p>

  <p>"By the way," she asked, "what happened to Wanda Hessely?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "There was a rumour she was killed in one of the Berlin air
  raids."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, I hope not."</p>

  <p>He exclaimed sharply: "You what? You hope not? You dare to hope that out
  of all the millions of innocent people slaughtered during those horrible
  years SHE should have been spared&mdash;just because you happened to meet her
  once! What sublime egotism!"</p>

  <p>The remark was so startlingly outrageous that she would have flared up but
  for the look she caught in time&mdash;the look that told her, out of long
  experience, that he had spoken thus to conceal some deep feeling of his own.
  He had always been like that, and only for a short time, just after their
  marriage, had she been able to free him a little. It was the more curious
  because in his work he was superbly free; without sentimentality or shrinking
  he could examine and expose the tenderest emotions. But off duty, so to say,
  certain rigidities clamped down, engendering even a perverse desire to appear
  callous, so that it was often at such moments that he said things that were
  most remembered against him.</p>

  <p>She said, as to a child: "Don't be silly, Paul."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">One evening, on impulse, she visited a doctor&mdash;not a
fashionable one,
  or a specialist of any kind&mdash;just a local man whose office she had
  noticed near her apartment. She had begun to feel a peculiar tiredness
  lately, to which broken sleep had doubtless added. The doctor listened to her
  vague description of symptoms, examined her heart, and asked what was making
  her so nervous. She said she didn't know. He then fumbled a few questions
  that would soon have led to an intimate discussion of her personal affairs,
  but she discouraged him and he ended by telling her she had a slight heart
  condition, nothing serious provided she avoided overwork and, above all
  things, did not worry. He advised a vacation if she could take one and she
  promised she would, very soon. She thanked him then, paid his fee, and felt
  both relieved and somehow much older as she left his office.</p>

  <p>She told Paul of her visit the next morning. Rather to her surprise he
  took the matter anxiously and was extremely solicitous. "Oh my God, Carey
  &mdash;we'll have to look after you, won't we? Less work from now on&mdash;
  I'll watch it&mdash;to hell with their schedule&mdash;we're ahead of time,
  anyhow. No shooting after five o'clock&mdash;I'll make that a rule."</p>

  <p>"It isn't so much the work, Paul," she ventured to remonstrate. "It's
  trying to pacify everybody you quarrel with, and having to talk Randolph into
  a good humour, and being nice to newspaper people after you've made enemies
  of them all... if only you'd spare me some of that."</p>

  <p>"I will," he promised abjectly. "I know I'm to blame in a lot of things.
  And we just can't have you getting ill. I know what illness is&mdash;I'm not
  a completely well man myself." She smiled at that, remembering that whenever
  anyone else had ever mentioned the slightest ailment of any kind Paul had
  always been able to match it with some private and hitherto undisclosed
  martyrdom of his own. But now he said, so calmly that she felt he might be
  speaking the truth: "One or two things happened in that camp I was
  in&mdash;shocking things that I wouldn't ever tell anyone about. They made me
  ill and I started getting headaches. Migraine. They don't come so often now,
  except when I have fights."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sorry. Then that's another reason why you shouldn't have
  fights."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes." He clapped his hand dramatically to his head. "I must take
  care. I know I must."</p>

  <p>She said, continuing to smile: "Looks as if we're both getting to be a
  couple of old crocks."</p>

  <p>"WHAT? Oh, nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"I was only joking. My trouble isn't serious at all, I'm glad to say. The
  doctor assured me I'd be all right if I take care. Try to get a little rest
  in the afternoons, he said. I do, don't I&mdash;in between scenes and
  rehearsals? And don't let household worries weigh on you. Well, I haven't
  any, that's one blessing... As he took me to the door, he said&mdash;'You
  know, Mrs. Bond, your face reminds me of someone.' I thought he was going to
  say Carey Arundel and I got all prepared to be gracious, but he went on
  &mdash;'A girl who was a hostess on United Airlines&mdash;were you ever one,
  by any chance?' I told him no, and he looked quite sad."</p>

  <p>"He DID?" Paul exclaimed with abrupt and cheerful interest. "What sort of
  a man was he?... No, don't tell me&mdash;I've got a concept of him in my mind
  already&mdash;middle-aged, quiet, hard worker, faithful husband, respectable
  citizen... but all the time he's carried a vision of a girl he once saw in a
  plane... he never spoke to her&mdash;just watched as she walked about serving
  meals and checking seat-belts... a short trip, say Dallas to El
  Paso&mdash;two hours out of a whole lifetime. He fell in love with her then,
  if he'd realized it, but he didn't, he was shy, he didn't know his own mind
  enough to follow it, he wasn't the type to say 'Hello, sweetheart' and ask
  for a date, he didn't even remember her name afterwards... but as the years
  go by he can't forget her, she becomes a symbol of the unattainable, the
  pluperfect subjunctive&mdash;sometimes he sees people&mdash;strangers, new
  patients&mdash;who remind him of her, or he thinks they do... One of these
  days he's going to leave his home, his wife, his
  patients&mdash;everything&mdash;and search the world for that girl... Ah,
  that could be a PICTURE, Carey. Not junk like Morning Journey."</p>

  <p>She laughed at the suddenness with which Morning Journey had ceased to be
  a near-masterpiece; she laughed at his improvisation and at his own mounting
  enthusiasm for it; she laughed at his growing use of slang and epithets, to
  which he gave a peculiar emphasis, as of a foreigner waiting to be commended
  for having picked them up. And she laughed, finally, because in the mood she
  was in she felt hysterically relieved by doing so.</p>

  <p>She said: "Magnificent, Paul. But he's not middle-aged, he's quite young,
  and he's not married&mdash;he told me that&mdash;and I think he was just
  making conversation to get me out of his office."</p>

  <p>The crew and actors were beginning to drift in for the afternoon session.
  As at the pulling of a mental switch Paul returned to duty, and Morning
  Journey rose again in his favour.</p>

  <p>He often improvised like that&mdash;the slightest cue could send him off
  into the synopsis of an imagined picture. Once Greg said seriously: "Paul,
  why don't you get that down in writing and send it up to the front office?
  It's so damned good you ought to be able to sell it."</p>

  <p>"SELL it?" Paul exclaimed, incredulously. "Why should I sell it? It's
  MINE."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He made more trouble (it seemed he couldn't help it,
despite all his
  promises), yet Carey had never admired him so much as during those latter
  days of making Morning Journey. There was something exquisite in his care for
  detail, especially when one thought of the mass audience to whom minutiae
  would not count, even if they were observed; he knew everybody's business,
  much to their dismay at times&mdash;he seemed to be an expert on everything
  for which special experts had already been provided. Randolph barely
  tolerated him, visiting the set more rarely as the picture neared its end,
  evidently feeling that bad or good, the die was sufficiently cast. Two things
  should have made Paul popular with the authorities&mdash;the fewness of his
  takes and the fact that he was bringing in the picture several days under
  schedule; but Paul had an unrivalled capacity for sacrificing credit even
  where it was due, and Randolph, whose own direction had always been of the
  laborious sort, found it impossible to believe that so many printed first
  takes could show good judgment. To him Paul was possibly a genius, but
  certainly the kind of employee one could not handle; and as the somewhat
  peculiar packaging of Carey and Paul together in the contract had not been
  his responsibility, his real hope was that the picture should fail gently
  enough for the studio to try Carey in another picture and get rid of Paul
  altogether. Perhaps he, Randolph, might even direct her himself in the next
  picture&mdash;it would be exciting to get on the floor again. He liked Carey.
  She was a bit old for stardom&mdash;no older, though, than Madeleine Carroll
  and almost as beautiful; she had that indefinable thing called "class", and
  with co-stars like Greg Wilson there was no reason why Majestic Pictures
  should not use her a good deal. But for less money, if Morning Journey
  failed. Her agent, of course, would hold out for the same, would keep on
  reminding everyone she was married to a millionaire, but maybe that wouldn't
  be true much longer if the rumours one heard were correct. Randolph turned it
  all over in his mind many times as he sat at his desk after seeing the daily
  rushes. He and Paul did not see them at the same time now, and Carey and Greg
  did not now see them at all. That was Paul's doing too&mdash; he had reverted
  to an old idea of his that watching themselves in the previous day's scenes
  was bad for actors. What puzzled Randolph was how Paul could have forced such
  a ruling on Greg. All Greg had to say was, "You go to hell, Saffron, I'm
  seeing the rushes just as I've always seen 'em"&mdash; but for some reason
  Greg did not say it. That was disturbing, too, when Randolph thought it
  over.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The peculiarity of this film environment was that one could
live in a
  large American city week after week without feeling intimate with it, without
  even feeling that it was part of America. The apartment Carey had was of
  standardized luxury, the restaurants she patronized catered to people like
  herself, the morning and evening travel in the studio limousine was through
  streets that all looked the same, with the same stores and bill-boards, the
  same shadow and sunshine. Even the ocean was somehow disappointing as an
  ocean. But she loved the mountains twenty or thirty miles away, and solely to
  drive to them whenever she had a few hours to spare she rented a rather smart
  convertible.</p>

  <p>The studio was the real world&mdash;or rather, an unreal world which she
  explored sometimes with Paul when there were outdoor scenes on the back lot
  and she could make him take a walk during the lunch hour. The maze of streets
  and alleys there, where one could step from brownstone New York to
  Elizabethan England in a few seconds, the stranded Pullman on the
  two-hundred-yard track, the small-town main street with its false-fronted
  store buildings&mdash;all this was fascinating, a symbol (Paul said) of a
  world in which emotions themselves were false-fronted ("Tell me any picture
  Majestic ever made that wasn't"), and in which the symbols of life became
  substitutes for life itself. "Here on this back lot," Paul said one day,
  improvising himself into a tourist guide, "are all the signposts of our
  civilization, from the little red schoolhouse where you learn to the prison
  death-house where you burn..." He went on in this fashion, considerably
  enjoying himself, but she was hardly listening; her mind was preoccupied with
  a letter she had received from Norris that morning, for he had mentioned in
  it quite casually that he was getting bored in New York and had thought of
  coming out to see her, and also to meet Paul. Ordinarily there would have
  been nothing especially disturbing about this, yet it did disturb her,
  because she knew that Paul and Norris would not get along, and that an extra
  burden of peace-making would fall upon her. Frankly, with so much else to do,
  she could not endure the thought of it. As Paul went on talking she could
  hear in her mind Norris answering him back and the whole argument that would
  follow. It would be impossible&mdash;that on top of everything else.</p>

  <p>Within an hour during an interval between scenes, she scribbled a note
  from her dressing-room:</p>

  <p>"... Darling, don't think me inhospitable or that I wouldn't love to see
  you, but I really don't think you ought to come out here just now, it
  wouldn't be worth your while, I assure you, because I'm busy all day and have
  to learn lines in the evening for the next day&mdash;this job is really work,
  though you mightn't think so from all the glamorous stuff you read in the
  magazines. Please don't come, therefore&mdash;if you did you'd be at a
  completely loose end most of the time, and I can tell you this is a dull city
  to wander about on your own. I doubt if I could even get permission for you
  to visit the picture set&mdash;the rules are very strict against anyone who
  hasn't a business reason. As for Paul, he hasn't time for anybody, and as
  always when he's directing he's inclined to be bad-tempered with strangers.
  I'd hate you to get a wrong impression of him (for he can be very charming at
  other times), but I'm afraid you would if you met him nowadays. Perhaps later
  on, some time, when the job's finished and we can all relax. I'm glad to
  report that the picture itself is going pretty well&mdash;as soon as they
  ship a print to New York I'll try to arrange for you to see it in advance in
  a projection-room..."</p>

  <p>Norris sent no immediate answer to this, and for several weeks she was in
  constant apprehension that every ring from the lobby would announce his
  arrival.</p>

  <p>Then one morning another of his letters came&mdash;from Rio de
  Janeiro.</p>

  <p>"... the first few legs of a trip that will end up when and where I don't
  exactly know, maybe the bank that father is so keen on shoving me in. You
  remember I once said that he DEVOTED himself to his job&mdash;I can see now
  it's the right word for something that does have a faintly religious air
  about it. Everywhere that we've stopped, so far&mdash;Havana, Mexico City,
  Caracas&mdash;there've been exalted personages meeting us at airports,
  sometimes even in morning coats and top hats&mdash;it's been a revelation to
  me what a big shot he is, or must have been during the war, though I still
  can't quite fathom what his job was&mdash;something to do with government
  loans and currency, of course, but that doesn't give away much, and nor does
  he. But it's rather fascinating to get an impression of his importance from
  the way he moves around and meets people&mdash;it reminds me a bit of the
  Acts of the Apostles&mdash;you know, CONFIRMING THE CHURCHES. And he does
  also move in a mysterious way&mdash;father, I mean. Perhaps he's right, after
  all, and the bank wouldn't be a bad solution for me&mdash;at least for the
  time being. Oh God, I don't know&mdash;what do YOU think I ought to do? He
  thinks I've given up the medical school idea and perhaps I have &mdash;it's
  hard, out here, to face the kind of opposition I know he'd put up. This must
  be all for now, there's a business conference going on in the next room, so
  it's a chance for me to write. Incidentally, Richards is with us, as a sort
  of valet and general what-not. We stay here a week or two, then go on to
  Montevideo, Uruguay, the Hotel Bolivar..."</p>

  <p>That evening she wrote to both of them, yet there was nothing particular
  she felt she could say, partly because she suspected Richards might intercept
  her letters. She therefore assembled another instalment of the chatter she
  had been sending all along, and to which Austen had not replied by a single
  line. HIS MYSTERIOUS WAY. The phrase stuck in her mind unhappily, not so much
  for its wry meaning, as because of her distress that Norris should have been
  in a mood to employ it. It seemed to signify a return to the cynicism of his
  boyhood, but now without boyhood as an excuse.</p>

  <p>During those days she was immensely glad she had work, and that Paul could
  magnetize her to it so exhaustingly. The picture was making good progress and
  even he seemed satisfied, though the deferred problem of the cutting loomed
  larger on his mind as the job approached completion. One lunch-time, after a
  morning off, she arrived at the studio to find him stretched out full length
  on the couch of her dressing-room, eyes closed and a cigar in his hand,
  declaiming in a way which she took at first to be a speech from some newly
  minted dialogue but which, after a few sentences, she knew could not be that;
  it sounded more like an impassioned address to the stockholders of Majestic
  Pictures Incorporated, imploring them to unseat the existing board and
  replace them with men who would have greater consideration for art and
  artists. Actually, as Paul explained readily enough when she broke in on his
  oration: "I was just getting my thoughts together. We're going to have a
  fight, you know, about the cutting. I'll try not to drag you into it."</p>

  <p>"I'll try not to be dragged in, but I know I will be."</p>

  <p>"If it's cut properly it's a good picture. Not great, but good."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope it's a success too."</p>

  <p>He went on smoking. "Oh, by the way, how's your heart?"</p>

  <p>"Not so bad. It'll be all right if I don't work too hard."</p>

  <p>"You had nothing to do all this morning."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had one whole morning&mdash;wasn't that wonderful? What happened
  while I was away?"</p>

  <p>"Writers on the warpath again. You'd think those fellows had written the
  Bible."</p>

  <p>"What was the trouble this time?"</p>

  <p>"The same sort of thing. I couldn't use any of their barber-shop
  stuff."</p>

  <p>She knew the scene&mdash;it came earlier in the picture than the one in
  the woodcutter's cottage, though later in the shooting schedule... Greg,
  alone, is forced during this stage of his escape to pass through a town by
  daylight; he knows he is being hunted and that the hunters may already have
  picked up the scent. As he hurries through the streets he has a sudden
  impulse to throw off any possible pursuer by disappearing into a shop, and
  the one that seems most suitable is a barber shop, where he will have an
  excuse to stay some time. He has a day's growth of beard and knows the
  language well enough to ask for a shave. While he is being lathered he sees
  (through a big mirror) that someone is entering the shop and scanning the
  faces of customers. This man, Greg feels sure, is looking for him. He figures
  that his only chance is to do something that will eliminate him from
  suspicion; and this, in the circumstances, is to do something that will
  immediately focus attention on him. So with a muttered "Excuse me a moment"
  to the barber, AND WITH HIS FACE STILL LATHERED, he gets up from the chair,
  walks right past his pursuer to the rack on which he has hung his overcoat,
  takes a handkerchief from its pocket, gives his nose a startling blast, and
  returns to the chair. The pursuer observes him, but (as was intended)
  automatically puts him out of mind, for surely a man on the run would not
  deliberately and needlessly draw attention to himself? (Such reasoning being
  unconscious and therefore all the more reliable, according to Paul.) After
  completing his scrutiny of others in the shop, the pursuer leaves and the
  lathered man smiles gently as he submits to the razor.</p>

  <p>Once again a scene practically without dialogue, and once again different
  from the pages of the script. In these the pursuer had recognized Greg and
  there had been a mle with shots fired and mirrors broken; Greg had
  eventually managed to escape through a back door. If, therefore, Paul's scene
  could have been called over-subtle, the one it replaced had no subtlety at
  all. But it would have played well enough, and the original dialogue between
  Greg and the pursuer had been of the tried and true variety&mdash; "Put 'em
  up or I'll shoot"&mdash;"You think you've got me, do you? Stand back,
  you&mdash;" etc. etc.</p>

  <p>The writers had urged on Randolph that Paul's scene, both as to incident
  and motivation, would not be understood by an average audience, and Randolph
  (miffed because once again a vital change had been made at the last moment
  without consulting him) had agreed with them.</p>

  <p>"And what's going to happen?" Carey asked.</p>

  <p>"Who cares any more about that?" Paul began to chuckle. "It's happened. I
  shot the scene my way."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, you're very obstinate."</p>

  <p>"OBSTINATE? ME? After all my compromises?"</p>

  <p>"Paul, do you know what the word compromise means?"</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;it's what I'm doing now by working on a picture like this at
  all. The only thing it can be, at best, is a bag of tricks. Well, that's all
  right&mdash;I don't expect them to let me produce a work of art. But if it's
  going to be a bag of tricks, for God's sake let the tricks be tricky enough.
  And that's what really beats me, Carey&mdash;here's this business of telling
  stories by means of tiny photographs&mdash;it's just about fifty years
  old&mdash;fifty out of the thousands since people began telling stories at
  all&mdash;yet already there are factory rules laid down&mdash; mustn't do
  this, mustn't do that... And you call me obstinate because I dare to answer:
  TRY IT! See if an audience is as dumb as you think! There they are &mdash;the
  groundlings&mdash;all crunching popcorn just like Shakespeare's crowd at the
  Globe if there'd been popcorn in those days&mdash;all you have to do is to
  give them a Twelfth Night&mdash;it doesn't have to be a Hamlet every
  time!"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see you shooting Hamlet, Paul&mdash;you'd cut half the
  lines."</p>

  <p>"So would Shakespeare if he'd had a camera to play with."</p>

  <p>"You must admit, though, you do seem to have a special grudge against
  dialogue."</p>

  <p>"No, not a grudge at all&mdash;only a realization of what films have done
  in their first fifty years. They've broken the bottleneck of words that we've
  all endured for centuries&mdash;they've challenged the scholars and
  grammarians who built their little private fences round enlightenment&mdash;
  they've freed us from the thraldom of Gutenberg!... You've heard some of the
  old jokes about producers out here who're supposed to be illiterate? Too bad
  the breed seems to be dying out&mdash;I think I could have got along with one
  of them better than with Randolph. Because that fellow READS. God, how he
  reads! He and his wife, when they get hold of what they think is a good book,
  d'you know what they do? THEY READ TO EACH OTHER ALOUD. From chair to chair
  and bed to bed&mdash;a chapter apiece every evening! He TOLD me... and with a
  straight face!"</p>

  <p>Paul's guffaws lasted for some time, and Carey laughed more moderately,
  reflecting that, for all his tirade against books and Gutenberg, there could
  be few people on earth who had read more. During the periods of his life when
  he had been out of a job he had borrowed five or six books a day from public
  libraries, and when he had been earning money he had usually come home with
  purchased books under his arm. He had probably spent more time in Brentano's
  than in all other New York shops put together. And she had rarely heard
  anyone mention a play or a playwright or an episode of theatrical or dramatic
  history that he did not seem to know plenty about. It was true he was not a
  scholar in the pedagogic sense, but his range was wider&mdash;he had an
  artist's acquaintance with all the arts, plus a technician's familiarity with
  all the theatrical arts, plus an immense if disordered store of general
  knowledge. He would probably have been a great success on Information
  Please... But of course the way he digested books was photographic; he could
  acquire the sense of pages without taking words consecutively, and the notion
  of his ever reading aloud a whole chapter of anything or wishing her to read
  him one, was certainly comic. Sometimes, when she had been driving the car in
  those old days, she had asked him to read her the headlines in the paper, but
  before he was through a couple of them he had usually launched into comments
  or fulminations that had made her exclaim: "Darling, will you please read me
  what it says and leave what you think about it till afterwards."</p>

  <p>Pleasant, in a way, to remember these things now, while his guffaws
  continued.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The barber-shop scene was cut, entirely; a conclave of
studio executives
  decided after seeing the rushes that it simply did not 'come off'. As it was
  only an episode in the chase, the cut did not spoil the finished picture. To
  Paul, however, it might have been his own lifeblood that had been arbitrarily
  drained away, and since he blamed the writers for it he looked for an early
  chance to get his own back. It came when one of them, a quiet, studious-
  looking youth named Mitchell who had said little during story conferences and
  had always seemed anxious that his more voluble partner should act as
  spokesman, chanced to visit the set on some personal business that had
  nothing to do with Paul. But Paul spotted him and drew him into a
  conversation that began quietly enough; soon, however, the youth was the
  centre of a group with Paul baiting him gleefully. When Carey came up,
  hearing a commotion, she was in time to catch Paul at his familiar game of
  repeating before a larger audience something he had originally tried out
  before her. "Of course you writers don't really like motion pictures&mdash;
  how could you? Pictures have broken the bottleneck of words that's been your
  mainstay for centuries&mdash;they've freed the world from the thraldom of
  Gutenberg! In one silent shot I can tell more of a story than you could set
  down in a whole chapter!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but to create a character, Mr. Saffron&mdash;" Mitchell began in
  feeble protest.</p>

  <p>"All right," Paul snapped. "Create your character&mdash;write your pages
  of dialogue to make your audience feel the way you want about him. Let's say
  he's the heavy&mdash;the worst villain you can invent&mdash;liar, crook,
  murderer&mdash;Simon Legree and Dracula rolled into one&mdash;take fifty
  pages to put your readers in a fine lather of hate. Then call me in with my
  camera and I'll undo it all in ten seconds. And you know how?"</p>

  <p>Mitchell stammered that he didn't know how, but Paul was going to tell him
  anyway. "All I need is a little lame dog dodging traffic at a crossroads.
  Your villain comes along, picks him up, carries him over, sets him down
  again. Ten seconds. Not a word spoken. And the audience loves the guy for
  ever. Do you doubt it?"</p>

  <p>"No," Mitchell admitted, amidst the laughter. Then remarkably he seemed to
  acquire stature, shaking off the nervousness that had made him till then a
  rather ineffectual figure. He went on, gathering power as from some
  unsuspected source: "I don't doubt it at all, Mr. Saffron. It's always
  quicker to raise a prejudice than plant an opinion. That's part of what's
  wrong with the world today. You talk about the thraldom of Gutenberg, but it
  was under that thraldom that men learned to THINK. Today thinking's out of
  style, it's highbrow or longhair or whatever smear you have for it; you've
  learned to bypass the brain and shoot for the blood pressure&mdash;all your
  stuff is really for the twelve-year-old!"</p>

  <p>"ALL my stuff?" Paul managed to interrupt. "How much of it have you seen?
  Did you ever see Erste Freundschaft?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Made in Germany in 1931, wasn't it? A work of genius. Done anything
  half as good since?"</p>

  <p>Carey thought this was too impertinent, even from one who had had
  provocation; she was taking Paul's arm to drag him away when he shook himself
  free and shouted, turning on Mitchell again: "I'll answer you. The best thing
  I ever did in my life was in Paris in 1939&mdash;a picture based on the Book
  of Job&mdash;it was unfinished when the Germans invaded and I spent three
  years in a prison camp because I wouldn't leave it&mdash;in the end it was
  mauled and butchered and ruined by others&mdash;my best work&mdash; a SUPREME
  work&mdash;and the goddamned French won't even let me over there now to
  salvage the cuts! And when I fought and protested&mdash;from over
  here&mdash;what help do you suppose I got from writers? I contacted the big
  names&mdash;put my case to them&mdash;appealed to them as fellow-artists
  &mdash;fellow-ARTISTS, forsooth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Paul," Carey interposed, knowing from experience that 'forsooth' was
  always a danger-word in his vocabulary. "Paul, don't you think... the scene's
  ready... everybody's waiting... Mr. Mitchell, let Paul tell you about it
  later..."</p>

  <p>Paul never did; he avoided Mitchell from then on, but when later in the
  day, still brooding over the incident, he had to talk to Randolph he took
  occasion to ask abruptly: "By the way, that fellow Mitchell... who the devil
  IS he? Is he ANYBODY? SOMEBODY?"</p>

  <p>"Mitchell? You mean the writer? Why, no, he's&mdash;he's just a writer.
  Reminds me, his option comes up next week. Think we ought to let him go?"</p>

  <p>Paul was about to take a clinching revenge when his mind somersaulted to
  the nobler battlefield just in time. He answered insolently: "Sure, it might
  be the making of him. He's one of the few intelligent people I've met out
  here."</p>

  <p>"I think we'll keep him," Randolph replied coldly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But there was another incident that really caused most
trouble of all. It
  concerned an extra scene that Paul flatly refused to have, even though it was
  he who had first suggested it. The sequence called for a German agent in New
  York to convey news of wartime ship sailings to offshore submarines (just
  another item in the bag of tricks that had made Paul dislike the whole story
  when he had read the original script); and Paul had been seized with his own
  special idea late in the afternoon of the day before the scheduled shooting.
  As the scene was written, a sinister-looking person worked a radio
  transmitting set on what appeared to be a waterfront roof-top; but Paul's
  inspiration was that the German agent should send signals by having secret
  operatives among the janitors of a skyscraper, so that the apparently random
  arrangement of lighted windows after office hours could spell out messages in
  code. The notion intoxicated Paul as he improvised it quite sensationally on
  the set&mdash;"high columns of illuminated print in celestial newspapers" was
  his description of the New York skyline at dusk; and as usual he managed to
  communicate a rare excitement to others, so that Greg was soon in Randolph's
  office pleading for the somewhat radical and expensive last-minute change.
  But Randolph, on this occasion, needed no persuading. For the first time he
  displayed full approval of something that had emanated from Paul's brain, and
  by morning his approval had soared to enthusiasm. Unfortunately by that time
  also Paul had begun to discover flaws in his own idea. Surely enemy
  submarines could not approach near enough to see the high buildings, and
  wouldn't it be fantastically difficult to plant a special set of janitor
  spies in one of them? These and other objections Randolph stoutly discounted,
  and the argument that ensued was an ironic reversal of the usual.</p>

  <p>"But it was your own idea," Randolph was driven to exclaim, in utmost
  bafflement.</p>

  <p>"That gives me a special right to throw it out," Paul retorted. The
  wrangle wasted an entire morning (and therefore several thousand of
  Majestic's dollars), and in the end the producer's only comfort was that he
  could probably use the skyscraper idea in some other picture. Which he did,
  in due course, and it is fair to add that nobody found much amiss with
  it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Since the scenes had not been shot in consecutive order, it
seemed that
  the whole job ended suddenly, almost unexpectedly. One day the scene being
  done was the last, and there followed a party on the stage during which Paul
  could think of nothing but the impending battle about cutting. This lasted
  for a week, and after the dust had settled it looked as if he had got rather
  more than half of everything he wanted. But from his attitude one would have
  thought him abjectly defeated. He sulked and gloomed and then acquired one of
  those migraine headaches. There was no doubt of its reality. In the small
  office which had been assigned him Carey found him slumped in a swivel chair,
  grey-pale with bloodshot eyes and icy hands. She called a doctor over his
  vivid protests; whereupon he diagnosed his own case as if he were dictating a
  new scene. The doctor, somewhat intimidated, agreed that probably it WAS a
  migraine headache. He added, however, that a check-up might be a good thing,
  since Paul looked as if he had high blood pressure too. Paul agreed to call
  at the doctor's office the next day, and then, as soon as he had gone,
  assured Carey he had no intention of doing any such thing. "I'm all right,"
  he said, "if only those bastards would let me do my job without
  interfering."</p>

  <p>Carey then broke down. She saw this man, grey and worn and looking older
  than she had ever known him; she saw in him something worth everything and
  worth nothing, something singularly great and appallingly little and, in the
  deepest sense of all, pathetically helpless. She cried: "Oh, Paul, Paul, what
  can I do with you? Can't you help yourself? Darling, is there no chance for
  you at all?"</p>

  <p>"A couple of old crocks," he muttered whimsically, touching her hand.
  "Isn't that what you said we were? But we aren't. You're young, and I...
  well, I've still got that picture about children to do. You know my idea for
  it? The camera itself will be a child. And as the picture develops and the
  child grows up..."</p>

  <p>But somebody came in just then with a message from Randolph, and
  afterwards, when she tried to get him back to the subject, he would only
  shake his head mysteriously. "Ah, I said enough. Wait till I do the thing. I
  will&mdash;one day."</p>

  <p>But the mere reminder of it seemed to have cured his headache; and a
  little later, apparently rejuvenated, he was ready for a final battle with
  Randolph.</p>

  <p>This was about billing. He wanted Carey's name to be given prominence
  equal to Greg's, an absurd demand&mdash;first, because matters of that kind
  were none of his business, and second, because the Wilson name at the
  box-office meant so much more than hers. To her surprise Greg backed him on
  the issue, and she ascribed this at first to a charming though mistaken
  chivalry; but later she wondered if it were merely an extreme example of
  Paul's influence over Greg. Randolph, who clearly considered her the only one
  with any sense, detained her afterwards for a few compliments. "You've been
  very co-operative, Carey. I do want to thank you and to say I hope we'll be
  working together again." He could not commit the studio, of course; it all
  depended on how Morning Journey turned out; but there was no harm in paving
  the way.</p>

  <p>She was non-committal also in her reply.</p>

  <p>He went on: "As for Greg, I don't think I fully understand him these days.
  He used to FIGHT for top billing. What's the matter with him... is he in love
  with that guy?"</p>

  <p>Carey smiled. "Paul's apt to do that to people."</p>

  <p>"To MEN?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes. You're all for him or else you're all against him."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm neither," Randolph said, untruthfully. "And that applies to you
  too, I should think."</p>

  <p>"I KNOW him," she answered, with scorn or pride, whichever he decided it
  was.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After the last day's shooting there came the anti-climax to
which there
  was no parallel in the theatre, where rehearsals mount in a crescendo of
  tension, culminating in opening night and followed by either level activity
  or quick extinction. But movie-making offers a unique period of waiting while
  all the sub-assembly lines catch up&mdash;printing, distribution, publicity;
  and the nearest to opening night excitement that can happen at all is the
  sneak preview. Nearest, but still distant.</p>

  <p>One rainy evening Carey drove out with Paul, Randolph, Greg, and several
  high personages from various studio departments&mdash;a convoy of limousines
  traversing interminable boulevards to converge eventually on a rather
  ordinary cinema in what seemed a less than ordinary suburb. Unannounced and
  unheralded, Morning Journey was there to be submitted to the verdict of an
  audience that had come to see something else. The distinguished visitors to
  whom it all mattered so much sat in a roped-off row at the back of the
  theatre, just behind the folks to whom it all mattered so little. There was
  the end of another picture to be endured, then a Mickey Mouse cartoon and a
  newsreel; finally, without any fanfare, Morning Journey began. The audience
  was small because of the weather, and Carey, unused to half-empty theatres,
  thought there was only tepid enthusiasm, but she was aware that the picture
  itself bored her by now, and that the popcorn noises were standard procedure
  and did not in any way reflect either the patrons' visual enjoyment or lack
  of it. She was next to Paul, who kept cursing the music, which had been
  composed and arranged without his approval. Owing to his unfortunate tiff
  with the musicians this was actually the first time he had heard most of it,
  and he disliked it intensely.</p>

  <p>There was, however, some scattered applause at the end of the picture,
  which was also the end of the show. Greg had left a minute before the
  curtain, anxious to reach the manager's office before anyone spotted him for
  autographs; the others, unlikely to be so bothered, stayed in their seats
  while the audience filtered out. Then they joined Greg in the tiny office,
  waiting for the cards on which each patron had been invited to say whether he
  thought Morning Journey was Excellent, Good, or only Fair. There was also a
  space for 'Remarks'. (The possibility that any Majestic picture might be
  downright Bad had been ignored.) About two hundred cards, duly filled in and
  collected by the ushers, were presently handed to Randolph by the theatre
  manager, a hard-bitten and presumably unprejudiced fellow who said he had
  liked the picture himself and thought his people had liked it too, but he
  couldn't be sure&mdash;they were a tough bunch. Carey wondered why Randolph
  had chosen a tough bunch. Anyhow, the visitors were soon back in the cars,
  swishing through the endless unknown streets and across flooded
  intersections. Nobody talked much and everyone was glad to be dropped at his
  front door. "We'll meet again tomorrow," Randolph announced. Carey also
  wondered why he didn't look at the cards during the drive; she decided he was
  enjoying peculiar power in a peculiar way.</p>

  <p>It was still raining in the morning when the same group reassembled in
  Randolph's office, the cards having by this time been sorted and placed in
  three heaps on his huge glass-topped desk. His pleasure in delaying the
  outcome had become definitely sadistic; one heap was much larger than the
  others, but his encircling arms as he leaned forward prevented closer
  observation. Paul was the only one who, not having come to pray, was able to
  scoff. "Our tribute to democracy," he muttered, staring at the cards as at
  the trappings of some dubious religion. "He must have liked them because He
  made so many of them. A non sequitur if ever there was one. What about fleas,
  hookworms, boll-weevils?" Nobody answered.</p>

  <p>At last Randolph spoke, smiling rather coldly as he referred to figures on
  his desk. "This is what you're all waiting for, no doubt. Out of 215 cards we
  have 133 Excellents and 61 Goods. I think we can regard that as satisfactory
  &mdash;as far as it goes. Of course we can't predict what the critics will
  say, or the big exhibitors... Would anyone like a whisky and soda so early in
  the morning?"</p>

  <p>Put this way, the invitation drew no affirmative except from Paul, who
  said: "Sure. Why not?" So Randolph was forced to go to the small refrigerator
  concealed within an imitation bookcase whose false-fronted books were sets of
  Dickens and Thackeray. Everybody all at once began to smile and chatter
  &mdash;again except Paul, who glowered over his cigar as he watched
  Randolph's reluctant hospitality.</p>

  <p>Nobody looked at the cards, save at a few that had been put aside on
  account of some obscenity. These Randolph handed round for laughs. There were
  always two or three out of every batch. But here yet again Paul was the
  exception. He did not laugh. Indeed, he was rather prim about certain things
  &mdash;much more so than Carey, who could enjoy most jokes that most people
  found amusing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After the sneak preview Randolph decided to shorten the
picture by ten
  minutes' playing time to suit the requirements of double-feature exhibitors.
  Paul protested, but not so energetically as might have been expected; he was
  going through his own anti-climactic period&mdash;the mood in which, after a
  job was done, he found it hard to take continued interest in it. Already,
  from certain hints he let fall, his mind was beginning to revolve on other
  ideas. It was during this period also that Carey gained an impression that
  Randolph would not be terribly disappointed if the picture did not do too
  well. Not, of course, that he would sabotage his own product, but there
  seemed a lack of zeal in his proddings of the publicity department&mdash;a
  lack which must certainly have communicated itself. The fact was, he disliked
  Paul so much that he could take real pleasure from the prospect of his
  downfall, while at the same time he had an alibi for himself whatever
  happened, since it was on record that he had objected to the contract that
  had forced Paul into the company's employment. And at the back of his mind
  there grew intoxicatingly the notion of a future picture with Carey in it
  which he himself would direct. His real hope was that Morning Journey would
  turn out to be one of those half-and-half failure-successes in which he could
  fix praise and blame just where he wanted each.</p>

  <p>Carey could not enjoy her leisure during those further weeks of waiting.
  Unlike Paul, she was unable to generate new ideas to take the place of old
  ones, and the absence of daily work only made more room for her own private
  worries. She spoke of these to no one, not only because they were so
  intimate, but because something centrally sane in her makeup told her
  continually that she deserved no sympathy; by so many reckonings she was
  fortunate. Surely there could be no doubt of it when she looked back on her
  life. Yet she felt, at times, acutely unlucky as well as unhappy. She did not
  know what she wanted to do next, or where she wanted to go, and the fact that
  there were choices made the future harder to contemplate. Perhaps she would
  stay where she was till the fate of the picture was decided, then take the
  trip she had vaguely promised herself.</p>

  <p>Another thing that few would have thought credible and for which she
  blamed only herself was that she was often lonely. In a place full of
  interesting people she had so far been too busy to make friends, and the
  occasional parties she went to were apt to be unrewarding&mdash;not dull, but
  somehow devoid of a quality for which she could think of no single word but
  merriment. It seemed to her that many of the interesting people were also too
  busy to make friends, that many of the laughing people were laughing too hard
  to make merry, and that many of the interesting, laughing, and busy people
  were also as lonely as herself. Sometimes, after such a party, she had a
  spiritual hangover that sent her driving random miles in her rented car, as
  if to kill the memory of an evening that had been full of excitement yet
  fundamentally distraught. And even if her personal mood were responsible for
  much that seemed amiss, there were things to which she felt her own reaction
  was not subjective at all; the geographical heartlessness of the city, the
  miles of streets where nobody walked, the rigid charm of the professionally
  decorated interiors, the air of insecurity that was more sinister, somehow,
  than the perhaps greater insecurity of stage life.</p>

  <p>One day she made the expedition she had often thought of, but had hitherto
  avoided, partly from an unwillingness to be sentimental. But now she felt
  that sentiment was not the guiding motive, but rather a dispassionate
  curiosity to see a once familiar place with a different eye. She drove,
  therefore, to a certain street between Western and Vermont. The houses looked
  much as she remembered them&mdash;a little shabbier with age, and there were
  gaps in what had once been a careful line of palm trees. The frame house she
  was looking for had been renumbered, but was otherwise unchanged&mdash; the
  same wide porch, and the swing door whose sound in banging she could still
  catch in the ear of her mind. She drove round the block to see the house
  again, and as she repassed, the swing door opened and a child emerged. His
  brown face was so happy that she had an impulse to stop and talk to him, but
  he scampered into a neighbour's yard before she could think of an excuse. She
  then noticed other coloured children playing near by, and it seemed indeed
  that the whole district had undergone that kind of racial change that real-
  estate people deplore; but to her, because of the child's face, it was part
  of a deep content that came on her as she drove back to her apartment.</p>

  <p>When she got there, decision had been added to this new mood. She wrote
  immediately to Norris at the Hotel Bolivar, Montevideo, Uruguay:</p>

  <p>"DARLING NORRIS&mdash;I'm writing this before I change my mind, before I
  feel scared about it. I'm so glad you're having an interesting trip, but
  there was something in your last letter&mdash;the one from Rio&mdash;that I
  didn't answer; I felt I couldn't at the time, but now I suddenly feel I can
  and must. You asked what I thought you should do about going into the bank as
  your father wants, and my answer is No&mdash;not yet, anyhow, till you're
  stronger and back at home and unless you then feel happy and aren't in the
  cynical mood that your letter showed. Well, there you are, darling&mdash;my
  advice&mdash;you asked for it. DON'T GIVE IN&mdash;to anything or anybody. I
  wish I could offer my own life as a shining example, but you know it wouldn't
  be&mdash;and yet, in a sense, I haven't often let myself be pushed around too
  far, and when I have it's been my own choice as well as my own fault. And in
  case your father reads this (and why shouldn't you show it him?&mdash;I'd
  like him to know my attitude&mdash;perhaps it might even influence him a
  little), I'll add the news that the picture is finished and I'm looking
  forward to seeing both of you again if he'll send me a line so that I can
  match my plans with his. Actually I haven't any particular plans &mdash;I
  don't want to make any till I know his and yours. I've missed you both very
  much but I'm not sorry I came out here for the picture&mdash;I think it's
  turned out the way I wanted it and you know what that is. Well, this seems
  about all, perhaps in some ways it's more than enough, but the fact is, I'm
  so used to covering pages with nothing but chit-chat that I'd better send it
  off before I'm appalled at having had the nerve. But you'll forgive me,
  because you know how much I care for your happiness. My love, darling, as
  always.&mdash;CAREY."</p>

  <p>Without a re-reading she air-mailed it from the box on the pavement
  outside. Then she took her car and drove to the mountains, returning towards
  dusk. The fact that the mailbox had been cleared by then gave her the feeling
  of having made a decision which she did not regret, but whose magnitude she
  might not yet have fully explored.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">During this waiting period, before the film was released,
she saw little
  of Paul, but what she heard about him was characteristic. He had money in his
  pocket and was spending it, not exactly on luxuries, but with an eccentric
  abandon that was even more consuming&mdash;but of course that would not
  matter if the picture were successful. And if it weren't, perhaps money would
  even then be the least of his problems.</p>

  <p>She did not see much of Greg, either, though she heard that he and Paul
  had been to San Francisco together and had later stayed at Greg's house at
  Carmel. Apparently they were close friends and Greg's admiration for Paul had
  in no wise diminished. There was an interview in one of the film magazines in
  which Greg talked of him in terms so extravagant that the shrewd outsider's
  deduction would be that the picture must be bad enough to need it rather than
  good enough to deserve it; and so indeed were many deductions made, though
  not so shrewdly.</p>

  <p>Of all the strangers she had met and talked to in this strange part of the
  world the one she liked most was a man who had nothing to do with pictures
  &mdash;a certain Professor Lingard, who did not even look like a professor.
  He was an astronomer; about thirty, sandy-haired, pink-cheeked, angular,
  diffident, not really at home at the party to which, for some obscure reason,
  he had been invited, yet enjoying himself from an angle schoolboyish enough
  to be charming. Carey found herself next to him for supper; he talked about
  his work at an observatory on a mountain top and was interested because she
  had driven near it and knew where it was. Apparently he lived there during
  part of the year, in a small cottage within walking distance of his job; he
  said she ought to drive up there some night and take a look through the big
  telescope. She told him she would like to. "Give me a ring first and I'll let
  you know if the sky's clear enough," he then said, and she wondered if this
  were an 'out' because she had taken his invitation too seriously.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening he whispered to her: "I often wonder what it feels
  like to be famous," and she was just about to answer modestly but
  first-personally when she realized that his glance was scanning the other
  guests and that he evidently didn't take her to be one of the famous ones at
  all. That's what comes of being friendly to nice nobodies at this kind of
  party, she thought; they assume you must be a nice nobody yourself. "I don't
  know," she answered, glad to have spared both of them embarrassment. "Almost
  everybody here is a household word except me."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you will be soon," he said, "if you're in pictures." He spoke
  comfortingly, as to a junior who had tried several times for an examination
  and failed. She was amused and also touched. There was not only a winsome
  navet in his attitude, but a pleasure to her in finding someone who did not
  know her name, or if so, did not know it WAS a name&mdash;who had never heard
  of her recent role in Morning Journey (as had everyone else in the room), but
  who treated her as if she were a young girl full of dreams and ambition.</p>

  <p>She said: "I doubt it. I'm a bit old, you know, for a new career."</p>

  <p>"But you ARE in pictures, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've just finished a part in my first one."</p>

  <p>"Well, the main thing, I suppose, is to get a start. And you really are
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thanks." She even felt herself blushing.</p>

  <p>"Do drive up some time and look through the telescope."</p>

  <p>She smiled and repeated her promise, satisfied now that he really meant
  it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">More weeks passed; the rainy season ended, the first hot
spell of the year
  wiped the freshness off the hills. The skies became tawny-grey, the sun shone
  as through muslin.</p>

  <p>Suddenly two rumours got around, both from sources hard to define or
  investigate. First, that Carey was separating, or had separated, or was about
  to separate, from Austen Bond. Previous rumours that she was about to be
  'reconciled' with Paul had somehow ignored the existence of a Mr. Bond, and
  for that reason she had herself ignored them more easily; but now, in gossip
  columns and on Sunday radio broadcasts, the stories, though untrue, had
  greater logic. She did not know whether to take trouble to deny them or not;
  once a woman telephoned her and, after receiving a denial, made the tart
  rejoinder: "Okay, darling, but I write a column, so I hope you aren't just
  saying that on general principles."</p>

  <p>Carey telephoned Paul and asked if he knew of the woman. "She called me up
  just now. Any idea who she is?"</p>

  <p>Paul answered promptly: "Never heard of her." He was busy and soon hung
  up. But half an hour later he called back to say: "Carey, that woman you
  asked about&mdash;I asked Greg and it seems they're all scared of her out
  here. So you'd better be careful."</p>

  <p>"How do I be careful?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. Be what you like. What the hell does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"Well, who IS she? Why is she important?"</p>

  <p>"Greg did tell me, but I couldn't quite get the hang of it. She writes, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"I know she writes, but why should they be scared of her?"</p>

  <p>"They have scarable ulcers. Don't worry about her. The whole thing is a
  fine pickle of nonsense."</p>

  <p>The second rumour, a pleasanter one, was about Morning Journey. In some
  mysterious way people were already aware that it was good. Possibly it had
  been run in private projection-rooms before an lite; at any rate, the hint
  was in circulation that it was something to look for. Then came the press
  preview in New York with the critics practically unanimous. All of them
  praised Carey, nearly all praised Paul's direction, most prophesied a big
  hit, and one said that Greg Wilson had never supplied such a plausible though
  still invalid excuse for calling himself an actor.</p>

  <p>On the day these critiques were reprinted in the trade papers Carey could
  sense an almost barometric change in the local atmosphere. She could even
  believe that at her usual restaurant the smile of the head waiter had an
  extra obsequiousness. People came up to her table to gush and congratulate.
  The next day an executive of another studio asked her to lunch, ostensibly to
  show her the New York clippings, actually to sound her out about her plans.
  "I understand you have no future commitment with Majestic," he remarked with
  overdone casualness.</p>

  <p>"That's so, but I don't know yet whether I want to make another picture at
  all. I must take a vacation first."</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, naturally." And reading her indecision as caginess he said: "Of
  course nobody knows how the public will react. Critics can't make or break a
  picture as they can a stage play."</p>

  <p>"I know. Better wait and see how it goes."</p>

  <p>Having blown cool, he must now blow warmer again. "Personally I enjoyed it
  immensely&mdash;and you were magnificent."</p>

  <p>"I think the direction counted for most."</p>

  <p>"Yes, very good, quite good... How did Saffron get along with people
  during the shooting&mdash;not too well, I heard?"</p>

  <p>"Not too well, but well enough. He just did a wonderful job that'll
  probably make somebody else a fortune."</p>

  <p>"High praise, indeed..."</p>

  <p>"And from an ex-wife," she said with a laugh, guessing that the fact was
  already or would be later known to him.</p>

  <p>She added: "Paul's so good in Morning Journey that one can imagine if he
  were given a free hand&mdash;a freer hand, anyway&mdash;he might be
  great."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes when you give them too free a hand, these geniuses, they make a
  hell of a mess of things. I'd be satisfied if he stayed GOOD."</p>

  <p>"I think he'd rather wait for a job in which someone would trust him
  enough to let him be GREAT."</p>

  <p>"What, are you&mdash;his agent too?"</p>

  <p>More laughter. She couldn't be quite sure she was helping Paul by putting
  out feelers like this, but she had an impulse to do so. Then she steered the
  conversation to more general matters and let her host do most of the talking.
  Just before taking her to the car he said: "Where IS Saffron, anyway&mdash; I
  was trying to get in touch with him this morning but couldn't."</p>

  <p>So THAT'S it, she thought gleefully; they're ALREADY after him.</p>

  <p>But she had to answer, in reply to his question: "I don't know."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Paul was on an Arizona ranch, with Greg; he returned after
Morning Journey
  had opened at Radio City Music Hall and broken all records for a first week.
  Randolph, convinced now that his private dream of a half-success was
  hopeless, jumped on the band-wagon with full force. He was especially pleased
  when the picture won the triple awards given annually by the local newspaper
  critics&mdash;Carey, Greg, and Paul being the recipients. The awards were to
  be presented at a big dinner, and on the morning of the day Randolph could
  not help summoning the honoured three to the studio for compliments and a
  briefing. "Of course you'll all make speeches after you get the plaques and
  somebody ought to bring in that Calvin Beckford is seventy tomorrow." (Calvin
  Beckford was a local politician who would present the awards.) "Perhaps that
  would come best from you, Carey. And if anybody should see fit to say
  something nice about the studio it wouldn't do us&mdash;or them&mdash;one bit
  of harm." He tittered self-consciously. "I'll be there, of course, but they
  don't ask producers to speak. Those newspaper boys seem to think we don't do
  any of the real work... Incidentally, Carey, I phoned your agent in New
  York&mdash;I wanted him to know how pleased we all are."</p>

  <p>Paul had arrived at the office with Greg, but afterwards he drove back
  with Carey. "Greg wanted to stay on and talk to Randolph," he said, as if the
  star's absence from their company were something that had to be
  explained.</p>

  <p>Carey, who could be away from Greg without feeling completely lost, sat
  back in the car and looked at Paul. When she thought of Randolph's recent
  compliments she did not know whether to feel happy or cynical, but for Paul's
  sake at least she was happy. She knew he enjoyed compliments, even when he
  knew they were insincere, and from a man who he knew hated him there was
  probably a special piquancy.</p>

  <p>She said: "Well, Paul, isn't it nice to be on top of the world?"</p>

  <p>Paul seemed to have Greg still on his mind. "Greg's had too much of it.
  They put him in one picture after another&mdash;anything to exploit him. He's
  getting pretty sick of it all."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he has to be sick about. He gets five thousand a week
  and he can't act."</p>

  <p>"He's a good fellow, Carey&mdash;really he is."</p>

  <p>"I know it, and I also think he's lucky."</p>

  <p>"Because I directed him, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He was lucky before that."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't BAD in the picture."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't as bad as usual."</p>

  <p>"He told me he never believed he had it in him."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he had. I think you performed an optical illusion."</p>

  <p>"He certainly gives me all the credit."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he as long as he keeps the salary?"</p>

  <p>"You're very waspish today, Carey."</p>

  <p>"I'm just myself as I always am, only you haven't seen me lately&mdash;
  you've forgotten what I'm really like."</p>

  <p>"As if I could ever forget."</p>

  <p>"Darling, that's sweet and probably true."</p>

  <p>"All the same, though, I think you're a bit unfair to Greg."</p>

  <p>"Greg? Are we still talking about HIM?"</p>

  <p>How familiar it was, to be arguing with Paul again. She had not seen him
  for weeks, they had said hello almost as strangers in Randolph's office, they
  were now by chance thrown together in the same car for a half-hour's drive,
  and already they were arguing&mdash;not quarrelling, for they had never
  quarrelled... just airing their minds in a private tradition of cut and
  thrust&mdash;he with some idea he was leaning towards, but would not yet put
  into words; she sensing it already and poised to exert some uncharted
  man&oelig;uvre of checks and balances. The strange thing was that she felt
  free with him, free even from her own troubles and problems. And the thought
  came to her: how absurd it was ever to use the word 'reconcile' about the two
  of them. It was not in their power any more either to come closer or to move
  away.</p>

  <p>She said, thinking of all this: "Anyhow, Paul, you've had your big chance
  and it's certainly paid off. Can't you feel a bit joyful about it?"</p>

  <p>"After the way Randolph botched the cutting?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't seem to have done much harm." (There were a few instances in
  which, from a commercial angle, she thought Randolph's cutting had done good,
  but she would not invite the wrong sort of argument by saying so.)</p>

  <p>"Harm? To whom? To what? The popcorn sales?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now, Paul, you can't talk like that. It's been a critical
  success too."</p>

  <p>He sighed in a bemused way. "Ah, those critics. One of them said that in
  the street scenes I'd caught the pulse-beat of the American rhythm. That
  tickled me, not only because I don't know what the hell it means, but because
  there was once a critic in France who said I was so much in tune with the
  Gallic spirit it was hard to believe I hadn't been born in Paris. And in
  Germany when I made Berliner Tag they brought up my Pennsylvania Dutch
  ancestry to explain THAT miracle... All nonsense. People are people. Watch
  'em anywhere and you'll see. Great discovery. The Saffron touch&mdash;even in
  a cops and robbers epic."</p>

  <p>"You know it isn't really as simple as that."</p>

  <p>"SIMPLE? Whoever said it was simple? To see life as it is, plain, not
  gift-wrapped&mdash;why, it's as hard as being note-perfect in the
  Hammerklavier."</p>

  <p>She tried to steer him back to her main point, which was that the chance
  he had taken had come off abundantly, and that from now he would find himself
  in demand on something like his own terms, if these were at all reasonable.
  She told him then about her lunch with the other producer. "No need to rush
  things. Let Michaelson do most of the talking. Just sit back and realize that
  Morning Journey puts you in a market that'll go on rising for some time
  yet."</p>

  <p>"You're a smart gal," he commented absently.</p>

  <p>"Am I? It's the first time I've ever really wanted to be."</p>

  <p>"I know how you feel," he responded moodily. "That's why I'm getting out
  of the place." He said that without any emphasis, as if it were not an
  important remark.</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>"You heard me, as they say in every damned script I've ever read out
  here."</p>

  <p>"Paul... what do you mean? What's happened?"</p>

  <p>And of course nothing had happened except the worst that could have, for
  Paul's equanimity; merely that as a result of Morning Journey's success he
  had been showered with scripts by producers and agents who hoped he might be
  interested in some property of theirs; a few of these scripts were averagely
  good, but many were old stuff dusted off and sent him on the 'how can you
  lose?' principle. Paul should have ignored them, or at least have glanced at
  only a few pages to convince himself of their quality, but it seemed that out
  of sheer obtuseness he had read them carefully&mdash;as carefully as he had
  journeyed to small theatres in out-of-the-way suburbs if ever one of
  Randolph's earlier pictures had been showing there. The fact that he had
  always returned from these expeditions fuming was no indication that he had
  not derived a macabre pleasure from them, once he had decided that an
  indictment against Randolph must be built up with every available piece of
  material. And now, in a similar but larger sense, an indictment against the
  whole industrialized picture industry was brewing in his mind, and the pile
  of scripts he had been sent was just the yeast to make it rise. So it had
  risen&mdash;mountainously. He was in a mood, Carey realized, when he was
  probably intending to do something he wanted to do and was finding many
  excellent reasons besides the real one. He kept saying: "There's no mutiny
  here, Carey," and when she asked what he meant he said one of those things
  she knew he had either said before or had coined so happily that he would
  certainly say it again; he said that to breed art and keep it alive there
  should be a continual mutiny of ideas. "But there isn't any here. This place
  is swarming with craftsmen who might have been artists if only they'd stayed
  away. And everybody's scared&mdash;scared of each other, of the future, of
  gossip columns, of ulcers, of the public, of Washington, of censorship
  &mdash;there's something gets into the blood from being scared of so many
  things all the time&mdash;you can smell it, and I've smelt it lately... These
  folks are afraid for their lives, they've built themselves a concentration
  camp that they're all fighting to stay inside&mdash;a damned democratic de
  luxe concentration camp where you hold elections by postcard poll of morons
  and smart alecks, where you bypass the adult intelligence and shoot for the
  blood pressure of the twelve-year-old!"</p>

  <p>"That reminds me of what Mitchell said," she interposed mischievously.</p>

  <p>"Mitchell? The writer? Did he? I don't recall." (But she knew he did; he
  would never forget Mitchell, who had answered him back, who had left him
  hurt, speechless, angry, with ghost-phrases in his mind for ever that he
  could only exorcise partially by purloining them and adapting them for his
  own use.)</p>

  <p>But he was continuing now, in full flood: "Anyhow, that's the way it is
  with the people here&mdash;they're afraid for their lives and they'll do
  anything for those lives except run for them&mdash;they could if they
  wanted&mdash;the gate's wide open that way&mdash;the fence is to keep the
  crowd OUT, not IN. Well, I'M getting out. I know they'd never really let me
  do what I want here. They'd hate me, I'd never be one of them, they'd just
  give me squatter's rights inside the barbed wire... Oh dear, now I've upset
  you, I suppose&mdash;I always do, don't I?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't, by what he had said; it was the recognition of his mood that
  troubled her, for so often in the past it had been a storm signal in their
  personal affairs, and though it could hardly be that again, she was disturbed
  in a way she found hard to explain.</p>

  <p>"So you're thinking of going away?" she said wanly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not immediately. I mean, not tomorrow or the next day. Maybe in a few
  weeks. Greg's asking for time off too. Hasn't had a real vacation in years,
  he says. We're going to do something&mdash;somewhere&mdash;maybe in Europe.
  Don't know what&mdash;yet. And by the way, that's a secret. Not a word or
  it'll be in all the columns."</p>

  <p>"Paul, you know I never gossip... But about YOU, after all you've just
  said&mdash;I don't know quite WHAT to answer..."</p>

  <p>"Then that's good news, because I thought you'd be mad at me."</p>

  <p>"MAD at you?... Oh, Paul, I'm too&mdash;too BAFFLED&mdash;to be that. I
  wish I knew what it is..."</p>

  <p>"What WHAT is?"</p>

  <p>"The thing that drives you. What IS it you go for in life? I know it isn't
  money&mdash;I used to think it was success, but you'd get that here... Is it
  fame? Or power? Or pleasure of a kind&mdash;do you EVER get pleasure? Or is
  it something inside yourself that forces you?"</p>

  <p>He gave her the look she knew so well, because it was the most frightening
  reply of all, as if he had switched off his mind to a care-and-maintenance
  basis until the subject was changed. He said blandly: "No particular mystery
  about it, Carey. I just have my work to do and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. And that's what you call it&mdash;your WORK. But it's
  more than that. Work's only a word... Oh, words, they're not much use, are
  they? Greg can say 'vacation' and it just means golf, but to you&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"You don't really like Greg, do you?" he interrupted, switching on his
  mind again.</p>

  <p>He knew she did, and she knew the question he was asking was a different
  one. She answered: "It isn't that, Paul... Oh, never mind Greg&mdash;he can
  look after himself&mdash;he's established&mdash;rich&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;nearly as rich as your old man and a damn sight freer with his
  money."</p>

  <p>There was generally in any of his arguments a single explosion, rarely
  more than one, of sheer vulgarity; it so often marked a climax that she
  almost welcomed it. She said quietly: "You may as well tell me just what's in
  your mind, now you've begun. You think Greg will finance you in some picture
  of your own, is that it?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? He's a millionaire&mdash;must be. He can't act, as you say, and
  Majestic probably has him all sewn up anyhow, but there's no law to stop a
  man from investing in something he's interested in. Maybe I'll make another
  picture as good as Erste Freundschaft or the one they didn't let me finish.
  He's a likeable fellow, Greg is&mdash;I get along with him fine."</p>

  <p>Carey half smiled. She did not know whether her main impulse was to warn
  Paul of Greg or vice versa&mdash;to warn Paul that Greg, though rich, was
  doubtless protected by lawyers and agents and business advisers who would
  certainly not let him put any substantial stake in a Saffron picture; to warn
  Greg also, in case by some miracle of Paul's persuasion he should need it,
  that Paul was a splendid director who had probably, over a period of years,
  and balancing fabulous success against equally fabulous failure, won more
  personal prestige and lost more producers' money than anyone else in the
  business... And then, in sheer weariness, the thought came: Why should she
  warn either of them? Greg could look after himself, and so in his own way
  could Paul... perhaps it had been the mistake of her life ever to think of
  Paul as helpless&mdash;it was like the old problem in Candida&mdash;who was
  really the strong man, the poet or the other fellow?</p>

  <p>She said, speaking more in fatigue than in complaint: "So after all this,
  Paul... all the trouble... the fighting... you're giving it up... the thing
  we came out here for..."</p>

  <p>"WE? Doesn't affect YOU, Carey. Right now you're hot as a firecracker, as
  they say in these fantastic faubourgs. Didn't you catch Randolph's hint when
  he said he'd been talking to Michaelson? I'll bet he wants you for another
  picture."</p>

  <p>Another picture. The thought made a grey shape in her mind. She wondered
  if she could ever act again; but she had so often wondered this (sometimes
  five minutes before the curtain rose on a performance in which she did
  especially well) that she had come to disregard the misgiving as a mere
  symptom of mood; but now it would not be disregarded. And whether it was
  still foolish, or true for the first time, the fact remained that she was
  only good enough to satisfy herself when she had also to satisfy Paul. She
  could 'get by', of course, without him; she had done, many times in plays,
  and doubtless it would be even easier in pictures; doubtless too there were
  other directors just as great by any outsider's reckoning. But the grey shape
  was still in her mind.</p>

  <p>Paul was saying something about the Critics' Dinner that night and the
  possibility that the picture might win a similar award from the New York
  critics. "If it does it'll mean a trip there for us&mdash;Greg, you and
  me."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, I don't know that I want to go."</p>

  <p>"Studio expense. See a few shows." He had no particular care for money,
  but he was like a child if he could make someone else pay for a jaunt.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I'm too tired, Paul."</p>

  <p>"Tired?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... I don't know how I'll even get through tonight."</p>

  <p>He stared at her intently for a moment. "You look tired too." He announced
  that with an air of discovery. "Come up and have a drink. I don't believe
  you've ever been in my apartment."</p>

  <p>She never had&mdash;which might have seemed strange to others, but had not
  really surprised her. It was a penthouse at the beach, decorated in rather
  delicate pastel shades&mdash;the same standardized charm that you could buy
  anywhere for enough money, only she guessed Paul had paid far too much. He
  pulled back the drapes to expose the view of boulevard, harbour, and ocean;
  then mixed her a whisky and soda. "You know, Carey, it won't be so bad here
  for you. You'll be a big success without much trouble, and I'll tell you
  why&mdash;it isn't acting they want, it's a funny kind of personality. You
  have that&mdash;by God you have&mdash;you make the camera sing like an
  instrument."</p>

  <p>"I must tell Norris that, because he almost prophesied it."</p>

  <p>"Norris? Oh yes. What's he doing now? You hear from him?"</p>

  <p>"He's travelling in South America&mdash;with Austen."</p>

  <p>"Pleasure trip?"</p>

  <p>"Austen will try to make it that. He needs it."</p>

  <p>"Austen?"</p>

  <p>"No, Norris. He had a&mdash;a sort of breakdown after the strain of the
  war and the accident. He was IN the war, not just in uniform. He drove an
  ambulance for four years."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't Austen have kept him out of it?"</p>

  <p>"He could, and would have, but Norris wouldn't let him."</p>

  <p>"What is the boy then&mdash;a fool or a hero?"</p>

  <p>"Probably neither."</p>

  <p>"You miss them, I guess, now the picture's finished?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... especially Norris."</p>

  <p>"Why especially him?"</p>

  <p>A quite fantastic impulse seized her, so that she said, hearing the words
  with a certain excitement: "Suppose I said I loved him?"</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. Let him misunderstand her; it would perhaps be revealing, like
  the play within the play in Hamlet. For she could never discuss with him the
  real predicament without the mask, the protection of an acting part. "You
  heard me," she said, "as they say in all the damned scripts you ever read out
  here."</p>

  <p>He looked uneasy. "I&mdash;I don't get it, Carey. Are you joking? A boy
  half your age?"</p>

  <p>"A little more than half."</p>

  <p>He snorted. "Good God, I don't believe it. He's practically your son."</p>

  <p>"Ah, now, if only he were..."</p>

  <p>The speaking of the lines eased her, as so often at the opening of a
  play.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly absurd," he mouthed gruffly.</p>

  <p>And it was, but the show must go on. "Oh, come now, Paul, use your
  imagination. You've handled situations like this in pictures, haven't you?
  Too censorable to be shown over here, but all right for the Continent...
  People are people everywhere. The Saffron touch. You see life as it is, don't
  you, not gift-wrapped?"</p>

  <p>He sat heavily on the couch, his head bowed as in disgust or silent
  prayer. After a pause he said: "Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"What do you advise?"</p>

  <p>"Does he think he's in love with you?"</p>

  <p>At this she fluffed; she could not involve Norris in such a whim. "No,"
  she answered, after hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Well, that makes it simple."</p>

  <p>"Simple?"</p>

  <p>"Because there's nothing you CAN do."</p>

  <p>"And that makes it simple?" (Back now in full stride.)</p>

  <p>"I'm in a blind alley&mdash;I can't move forward or backward&mdash;I'm
  just plain stuck, and that's what makes it simple&mdash;as simple as being
  note-perfect in the Hammerklavier."</p>

  <p>He got up abruptly and glowered down at her. "Carey, what's the matter
  with you? Is this a game&mdash;a gag of some kind? I can't remember you in
  this mood ever before."</p>

  <p>"I never have been. Perhaps this is a first time&mdash;Erste
  Freundschaft."</p>

  <p>"You mean..." He weighed an interpretation in his mind and was clearly
  disconcerted. "You mean&mdash;you never were&mdash;in love&mdash;with
  ME?"</p>

  <p>"Does the sun have to be like the moon?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil does that signify?"</p>

  <p>"You were the sun, of course, but the moon, as everyone knows, is for
  love."</p>

  <p>Like all other bad lines he had ever encountered, this maddened him. "For
  Christ's sake... a cue for a song in a fifth-rate musical! What IS the matter
  with you? Talk sense. You're not on the stage now..."</p>

  <p>"But Paul, don't you remember that at moments of intense emotion an actor
  has to act?&mdash;it's the only way he can come to terms with things... it's
  the consolation he has as an artist... you told me all that once..."</p>

  <p>Even in his angry bafflement he picked up two words out of her speech and
  made, so to say, a ring round them. "Intense emotion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Paul. Intense emotion&mdash;but not yet remembered in tranquillity.
  Whose definition was that? Perhaps I'm a fond foolish woman, and to deal
  plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind... Ophelia might have said that
  too."</p>

  <p>"Carey, STOP it. I don't know what you're driving at. What about Austen in
  all this? Of course I'm not surprised if you haven't been hitting it off too
  well with HIM&mdash;he didn't seem to me your kind of man at all&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I hit it off with him very well indeed. I find it rather
  easy to hit it off with men. I'm a sensual woman, I sometimes think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, God, Carey, why are you talking like this?"</p>

  <p>"Does it shock you? I had an idea you might be&mdash;at least&mdash;
  amused."</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;it makes me&mdash;it makes me feel&mdash;I don't understand
  you&mdash;any more."</p>

  <p>He said that so pathetically that she got up and pulled him to the couch
  beside her. "And you don't, darling, in several little ways. But why bother?"
  The absurd little play was over. Perhaps, if he had known it was a play, he
  could have put on his mantle of infallibility and understood, but she had
  caught him with an unfair test&mdash;like expecting Paavo Nurmi to sprint for
  a bus. She did not blame him. She went on with half-chiding affection: "Paul,
  Paul, don't look so black, I've been acting&mdash;as you did when you were
  rehearsing me in Desdemona and you pretended to suspect me with Harry Foy...
  Can't I have my own little act too?"</p>

  <p>"But why? There was a reason for that, but THIS... I still don't get
  it..."</p>

  <p>"I know. There's a hair's-breadth of no-man's-land between us. Only a
  hair's-breadth. Woman's-land, let's call it. Oh boy, what dialogue!"</p>

  <p>He muttered something, but she could see he was relieved, and the look of
  pathetic puzzlement changed to one of mere glumness. "When are they due back
  from the South American trip?" he asked after mopping his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll want to be in New York to meet them?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"But won't they expect you to?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that either... I don't know anything. I can't see the future
  at all."</p>

  <p>He pondered this for a moment, then suddenly became emphatic. "Got an
  idea. Why DON'T you do another picture?"</p>

  <p>"WHAT?"</p>

  <p>"It's the solution, Carey. Randolph would sign you up tomorrow, I'm
  certain. You've made a big reputation almost overnight&mdash;you've got a
  ready-made audience for the next thing you do, no matter what it is. And even
  with someone else directing you'd soon find how work would take your mind off
  things... Carey, why not? Let me get hold of Randolph right now..."</p>

  <p>"No, no, Paul. Please don't... I won't talk to him... Paul, put that phone
  down..."</p>

  <p>"You'd prefer Michaelson to handle it from his end? Well, maybe that's
  smarter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Paul... can't you understand that just now I'd rather die than face
  another day in a studio?... I'm TIRED. Don't you realize that? Things have
  piled up on me... I'm TIRED."</p>

  <p>For the first time he seemed to take her seriously. He said simply: "I
  wish I could help you."</p>

  <p>"You have&mdash;a little&mdash;just by saying that. But you can't
  &mdash;really. There's not a thing anybody can do. It's in myself. But I can
  manage. I shall, I know. You don't need to worry about me."</p>

  <p>He looked increasingly concerned. "Maybe you should take some time off.
  Carmel's a good place&mdash;Greg likes it there. Six months, maybe... How's
  your heart, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"'Tis broke," she answered, so promptly that she startled herself. Then
  when he stared without smiling she went on: "Don't you remember that&mdash;
  the time we first met&mdash;me driving down that hill in Kingstown with my
  leg under me and you asking what was the matter with it?"</p>

  <p>He smiled then, but she couldn't tell whether he did remember or not. Then
  she lost all control. She kept crying "'Tis broke&mdash;'Tis broke&mdash; "
  and Paul was helpless at her side, genuinely distressed but knowing nothing
  of any way to console her. Presently the tears spent themselves and she shook
  herself free of grief. "I'm sorry, Paul. That was very silly. I'm really
  ashamed of myself."</p>

  <p>She let him fill up her glass, though she did not drink again, and the
  conversation after that became casual and unimportant. About three o'clock
  she left, for she wanted a long rest before the dinner.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At her apartment an air-mail letter awaited her from
Austen's lawyer,
  Herbert Walsh, in New York. She had met him only once or twice and was
  surprised to hear from him. The letter said merely:</p>

  <p>"DEAR MRS. BOND&mdash;I plan to be in your part of the country the 21st to
  the 25th and should like to discuss with you a certain matter. I hope,
  therefore, you will not be out of town, or if so, perhaps you would be good
  enough to let me know where I can contact you. My address will be..."</p>

  <p>The letter gave her a chill as she read it. She had noticed lately that a
  great many small matters affected her in this way if they contained any
  element of uncertainty&mdash;a message that someone whose name she did not
  know had been trying to reach her on the telephone, some anonymous scurrilous
  letter (such as every movie personality receives occasionally), even the
  headlights of a car that seemed to be following her at night but was only
  waiting for a chance to overtake. It was a symptom of her nervous condition,
  she imagined, due partly to the strain of the picture-making; she was still
  detached enough in mind to diagnose and smile at her own foolishness. This
  letter from Mr. Walsh, however, put her in a state of mental spasm. She paced
  up and down the living-room of the apartment, reading it over and over as if
  the words themselves were hard to understand, then she crumpled it in sudden
  reasonless consternation. If someone were trying to torture her, this was the
  way. A minute later she was at the telephone, the note smoothed out beside
  the instrument as she read from it Walsh's number. Action had quieted her.
  But it was too late&mdash;six-thirty in New York; Walsh had already left his
  office and his secretary said she had strict orders not to give anyone his
  home number.</p>

  <p>Carey, still a little distraught, found a groove of relief in the memory
  of all the stage telephone scenes she had played&mdash;controlled emotion in
  voice, but an utmost betrayal to the eye&mdash;how easy it was, and how
  difficult audiences always thought it!... She said: "Perhaps YOU can help me
  then. I got a letter today from Mr. Walsh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mrs. Bond. I remember sending it. He's going out to visit you."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;just&mdash;just to visit ME?"</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but if it's so important I&mdash;I feel I can't wait to know
  what it is... I MUST know... It's not fair to have to think of these things
  for days ahead... Do YOU know what it's about? I'm sure you must do
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Bond&mdash;perhaps if you were to telephone Mr. Walsh
  personally tomorrow... well, no, I oughtn't to say that&mdash;he probably
  wouldn't care to talk over the telephone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you DO know what it's about?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mrs. Bond, Mr. Walsh doesn't discuss his cases with me."</p>

  <p>"CASES?" Her heart felt as if it were being lifted out of her body for a
  solo exhibition. "WHAT case? I'm not in any case... at least I... none that I
  know of..."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Bond. There's really nothing more I can say. I'm sure
  when Mr. Walsh gets out to see you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see, I see... Yes, I understand... I'll wait... Goodbye..."</p>

  <p>For a time after that she thought she would be unable to attend the
  dinner. But that disturbed her even more; she disliked causing commotion, and
  had always harboured a slight contempt for last-minute cancellers. Paul had
  once told her understudy: "You're in a hopeless job. Carey goes on if she can
  crawl." Somehow the recollection of that tribute gave her power now to face
  the evening ahead, and once the decision was made she could even raise a mild
  excitement. It might be fun to have people applauding her again, real live
  people applauding HER instead of her photographs.</p>

  <p>She rested, changed, then drove downtown where the dinner was to be held.
  She was a little late, yet she drove slowly, choosing the quieter residential
  streets. Suddenly a dog came scampering through a gate and into the roadway
  in front of her car; she passed right over. She felt her heart brake sharply
  with the clenching of feet and hands; she pulled to the kerb, then looked
  back. It was true, except that the car, not the wheels, had passed over; and
  the dog, a black spaniel, was now back on the sidewalk, scared but unhurt,
  desperately trying to re-enter the gate. She got out and approached the
  animal, almightily angry and tender; in a deep convulsion of deliverance her
  heart began to hammer again as she stooped to fondle him, but he was
  unresponsive, merely wanting to be back in his own garden. She unlatched the
  gate and let him in. Then she resumed the drive. Nobody had seen the
  incident. How baffling was the alchemy of inches and seconds... and she
  thought of Norris in his jeep with that girl on the Rhineland road. And that
  other German girl, lovely Wanda Hessely, killed by bombs. There was hazard
  enough in the lives of those who wanted to live, and for those who wanted to
  die, was there too much&mdash;or not enough?...</p>

  <p>At the dinner she received a warm welcome from the five or six hundred
  guests already congregated. She had met many of them before, casually and at
  other parties; some gave her the appraising welcome of those who knew she was
  on the upgrade in the local hierarchy, but there were others doubtless who
  were jealous of her success; she had been in show business long enough to
  accept that as one of the facts of life, not as any particular proof of evil
  nature. She smiled and shook hands a good deal as she found her place at the
  high table, next to Calvin Beckford. Greg was on his left, and Paul, to her
  slight surprise, some way down the table between two pretty girls. Her
  neighbour on the right was introduced as a Mr. Hare&mdash;a small man,
  sharp-eyed and friendly; he said he thought he had seen her once in a play in
  Boston when he was at Harvard, and someone who overheard this laughed because
  that made her (as she certainly was) at least forty. "I can't remember the
  play, but I couldn't forget YOU," he said, plugging the hole in his gallantry
  so promptly that she wondered if he had made both remarks to fix her interest
  in him. Then Beckford commandeered her and would not let go throughout the
  first part of the meal. He was a type she had often met and knew how to get
  along with&mdash;showy, glib, eager to impress, to please, to be flattered in
  return. She much preferred the other man, and at the first chance she turned
  to him. "I think it must have been Quality Street you saw me in, Mr. Hare,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"That's right, so it was."</p>

  <p>"Because I don't believe I ever played in Boston in anything else. Not in
  those days."</p>

  <p>"Not so very long ago."</p>

  <p>"Twenty years."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "What does it feel like to be a well-known actress all that
  time and then have people behave out here as if they'd discovered you?"</p>

  <p>She laughed and was aware of the freemasonry between them of those for
  whom movie standards were too important to be disregarded but too inept to be
  taken seriously. "It's funny," she said.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll tell them that in your speech."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do I have to make a speech?" She knew she had, of course, but she had
  an impulse to act a part&mdash;only a small part, just to keep her mind off
  other things.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure we all hope you will," he answered. "But it needn't be a long
  one. Do speeches make you nervous?"</p>

  <p>"Other people's do occasionally." She was thinking of Paul; she had caught
  sight of him down the table; he seemed to be in the throes of not having a
  good time; his two neighbours were talking to each other across him, a thing
  that would always put him in an ill humour. She added, aware that Mr. Hare
  was studying her: "Paul's especially. Paul Saffron&mdash;the director. He can
  be so tactless." She wondered why she had said so much, then added hastily:
  "No, I'm not exactly scared to speak in public, but I find it much harder
  than acting. Perhaps that only means I find it hard to act the part of
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Ethel Barrymore once told me practically the same thing."</p>

  <p>She wondered who he was; he did not seem the kind that would say a thing
  like that just to let her know he knew Ethel Barrymore. Probably someone
  important in the picture world, otherwise he would not have been put next to
  her. Then a wisp of memory flicked her from somewhere&mdash;Hare&mdash;
  Hare&mdash;there was a lawyer named Hare who had handled something for
  somebody she knew... she remembered it because she had thought it sensible...
  a clause in a will limiting burial expenses to five hundred dollars. Every
  celebrity ought to have it, Hare was supposed to have said, like insurance
  against nuisance suits, and it had been his idea to make it mandatory so that
  executors and relatives wouldn't be made to look like cheap skates... Yes, a
  good idea. By then she realized that Mr. Hare was saying nice things about
  Morning Journey. "A real triumph for you, Miss Arundel. I expect you're
  already bored by people who tell you so."</p>

  <p>"No, I enjoy it. Thank you."</p>

  <p>"Of course you won't go back to the stage again. I say that because I hope
  you will."</p>

  <p>"I might."</p>

  <p>"But first, I suppose, another picture?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've no plans for that. I've no definite plans for anything, except
  perhaps a vacation in Ireland... By the way, Mr. Hare, you're the lawyer,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"THE lawyer? Let's settle for A lawyer."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you could help me."</p>

  <p>She had the sudden idea she would ask him about the letter from Walsh.
  What it could possibly mean. What she ought to do about it. Whether, when she
  met Walsh, she ought to be alone or to have another lawyer with her. She read
  in Mr. Hare's attitude such personal friendliness that she felt she could
  tell him the whole story&mdash;if only she herself knew what the whole story
  was. But of course she didn't. Then how COULD he help her? How could he
  possibly judge from Walsh's letter what it meant? He would probably advise
  her to see Walsh and find out. It was therefore absurd to bother him about
  something nebulous. She changed her mind so abruptly that when he answered,
  "Of course. Trouble of some kind?"&mdash;she had to think fast to find any
  answer at all. She said: "Oh, nothing very important. I thought of
  sub-letting my apartment while I go to Ireland, but the lease says I
  can't."</p>

  <p>"Be glad to help you," he answered. "Send&mdash;or better still&mdash;
  bring the lease along to my office and I'll see if anything can be done." The
  chairman had risen and was trying to get silence for his opening remarks. Mr.
  Hare went on hurriedly: "Any time. Tomorrow morning if you like."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Tomorrow morning, then," she answered, stampeded into another
  absurdity, as she well realized. For she rented her apartment by the month
  &mdash;there was no question of sub-letting. She wondered what on earth she
  could say if she did visit him, or alternatively, what he would think if she
  made some excuse not to go. Then she thought of a better way out; she would
  say, when she got to his office: "I've decided not to sub-let, anyhow, but
  meeting you made me think of something you once did for someone I knew,
  though I can't remember who it was, but I remember WHAT it was... a clause in
  a will limiting burial expenses..." Macabre but reasonable. Then she wondered
  whether, even with this excuse, she really needed or wanted to visit Mr. Hare
  at all...</p>

  <p>The chairman was speaking. She glanced down the table and watched Paul for
  a moment, failing to catch his eye. His chin was sunk disconsolately in his
  chest; she might have thought he had drunk too much but for knowing that he
  never did, any more. Yet somehow, looking at him, she was apprehensive; she
  wished he had had a neighbour who could have given him some good
  conversation, instead of the two chattering starlets he had been stuck with.
  It occurred to her that he would doubtless consider his bad position at the
  table a slight; but she was fairly certain it was not, and that he had been
  put between two pretty girls because someone might have supposed he would
  enjoy himself there... Meanwhile she was planning what to say when her own
  turn came. After her remarks to Mr. Hare, he would probably expect her to be
  not so good; she would surprise him, therefore. Yet it was true; she felt
  uncovered, vulnerable without the protection of an imagined personality.</p>

  <p>The chairman sat down, having said nothing that she had really heard, and
  during the applause Mr. Hare turned to her again. "Are you by any chance
  going on to the Fulton-Griffins' when this thing is over?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think so. I was asked, but I understand there's such a crowd
  always there, and I hate crowds."</p>

  <p>She had never been to a Fulton-Griffin party, though Paul had been once
  and told her what it was like. She had known then that she wouldn't enjoy
  it.</p>

  <p>"So do I," Mr. Hare said, "but a Fulton-Griffin party is something you
  ought to see if you haven't been to one before. I thought if you were going
  I'd have a chance to talk to you without all these interruptions."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'd like that, but I really think I ought to go home. I've been
  rather tired since the picture finished and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The chairman was introducing the next speaker, Calvin Beckford. After his
  first half-dozen words she glanced at Paul with renewed apprehension, sure
  that he would dislike the man fiercely and progressively. For Beckford had
  the kind of fruity voice that Paul could not stand, even when an actor
  assumed it for a part; "Be an undertaker, not an actor," Paul had once said,
  to a youth whose natural voice had been of that kind, "and change the funeral
  service to read 'O Passing On, where is Thy Sting?'" Now why did she recall
  that?... She looked at Paul again and noted every sign that he was in a
  profound gloom. Beckford's voice droned on, the lard-like face falsely
  radiant as the compliments poured forth. "Unforgettable career fittingly
  climaxed" was one of them, aimed at herself. Paul would hate that too, and
  for a number of reasons, one of which was that he hated the word
  'unforgettable'. It was a radio word, he always said, meaning
  'forgettable'.</p>

  <p>At last the orator reached his point, which was the presentation of the
  plaques; she took hers, bowed to the applause, then made her little speech
  and forgot to congratulate Mr. Beckford on his approaching seventieth
  birthday, though she did remember to mention Majestic Studios as the alma
  mater that had nourished Morning Journey in its bosom. All very pretty, and
  over in exactly three and a half minutes.</p>

  <p>"Bravo," Mr. Hare whispered, when she sat down. "You did very well."</p>

  <p>She smiled and felt that he had been duly impressed.</p>

  <p>Then the presentation to Greg, who took even less time to get on his feet
  and off again.</p>

  <p>Then Paul.</p>

  <p>She knew from the outset, from the look on his face, from the set of his
  jaw, from the way he strode to a microphone and focused himself, as it were,
  into the centre of a silence, that he was going to be impossible. He took the
  plaque without a smile, and Carey, guessing what was ahead, bit her lip and
  stared at the table. Then it began... practically all the things he had said
  to her that afternoon. They had either simmered in his mind since then, or in
  a subconscious way he had been trying them out on her as he so often did... a
  weapon not necessarily to be used, but kept sharpened in readiness. She knew
  that his decision on such matters was almost always last-minute and
  capricious&mdash;that perhaps if he had been given a better place at the
  table, if one of his neighbours had been interesting, or if Calvin Beckford
  had been Jack Benny... then he might well have said his thank-you like a
  gentleman, like the little gentleman he sometimes looked but never actually
  was.</p>

  <p>When it was over she got up from the table and left, slipping out by a
  side door without a word to anyone. Nobody tried to stop her; she had an
  impression that Paul's speech had made everything else, for the moment,
  unnoticed. She ran down the road to the car park, not waiting for the boy to
  take her ticket. She was full of that curious vacuum of sensation that comes
  after one has been hurt and before one can really feel anything.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Back at the apartment she entered by a tradesmen's side
door that bypassed
  the desk; she did not want to be told there had been any messages for her.
  When she reached her rooms the telephone was ringing. The desk usually gave
  the name of a caller, but this time she lifted the receiver to hear a woman's
  voice mentioning the name of a newspaper and asking what she thought of Paul
  Saffron's speech at the Critics' Dinner. She answered, in a flustered way:
  "Oh, I don't know&mdash;I haven't much of an opinion about it."</p>

  <p>"But Miss Arundel, what do you think of his remark that Morning Journey is
  the worst picture he ever made?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do YOU think it's the worst picture he ever made?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no&mdash;or rather I don't know&mdash;I can't say&mdash;I haven't
  seen all the pictures he ever made..."</p>

  <p>A laugh at the other end seemed to show that her answer had been
  considered adequate.</p>

  <p>"Just one more question, Miss Arundel, what did you think about Mr.
  Saffron's statement that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she interrupted, "that's all I can tell you. I must hang up.
  I'm very sorry."</p>

  <p>She hung up. As she stepped from the instrument she tried to remember what
  little she had said. Question: "Do you think it's the worst picture he ever
  made?" Answer: "I can't say&mdash;I haven't seen all the pictures he ever
  made."&mdash;Oh, what a snide remark, the way it would look in print. She
  felt a heart-constriction, then a surge of anger against Paul for getting
  into this mess and dragging her into it with him. The telephone rang again.
  This time she lifted it off the hook and ignored it. She heard the
  intermittent clicking and wondered how soon the desk clerk would send someone
  up to see what was the matter. Abruptly, as if challenged to face some issue
  with every final scrap of strength she had, she made up her mind to go to the
  Fulton-Griffins'. She would startle everyone there, would make a stage
  entrance, act the unruffled queen, show everyone that she did not care for
  anything that had happened, that Paul could go to the devil his own way. An
  impulse of such magnitude demanded either enthusiasm or quick extinction; she
  was able to muster the former as she chose a new dress, changed quickly, and
  left by the same side entrance.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later she was driving along winding uphill streets. She had
  put the car-top down, for the feel of the night and the kind of excitement it
  might give; she had wrapped her head in a scarf that would keep her hair in
  shape. Presently the estate of the Fulton-Griffins came into view. Cars were
  parked for half a mile along the narrow drive-way; retainers, watchful for
  gate-crashers, scrutinized first the car, then seemed to recognize her face.
  The house was baroque and ugly, even in floodlights, but the gardens had
  spaciousness. A heart-shaped swimming-pool glistened amidst the trees and
  beside it stood an open-air bar almost as large. Sounds of frolic came from
  both.</p>

  <p>Nobody quite knew why a rich, respectable, and retired Middle Western
  couple lavished such frequent entertainment, or why they did not prefer
  seclusion to turning their house into an almost weekly shambles of broken
  glasses and cigarette-burned carpets. Presumably they liked to meet
  celebrities, old and new; presumably they liked noise; perhaps also they were
  generous, or bored, or snobbish. But even all of that could not pierce the
  final mystery. Their parties, at least, were not exclusive&mdash;or not much
  more so than the lobby of the Waldorf. And the one economy they practised was
  notorious; their liquor was never quite excellent.</p>

  <p>Several hundred guests were already mingling outside and in when Carey
  arrived, and she made the full sensation she had planned. She had always been
  able to act when she could do nothing else; it was like starting a motor that
  left her with some generated strength in herself. She actually enjoyed
  greeting her hostess with: "Believe me, after the Critics' Dinner coming here
  is a godsend. I wouldn't have missed it for anything, though... Paul's
  speech, I mean. The way that man can put his foot in it&mdash;with both
  feet!"</p>

  <p>After that, of course, everyone felt free to comment on the affair as
  outspokenly as they liked before her, and many did. She let them know how
  little she cared, how little it all mattered, how happy she was to be at a
  party where nobody would make serious speeches at all, not even silly ones.
  She felt waves of sympathy reaching towards her, but also waves of awareness
  that she was hamming it up, for she could hardly conceal that from
  professionals. It was the quality of the act that she hoped they would
  recognize. She talked a lot and was perhaps a little too gay at times. She
  had even a feeling once or twice that the whole idea of coming to the party
  had been mistaken, but she rallied herself quickly and switched to another
  group whose different reaction might reconvince her. In a party of such size
  and at such a stage of festivity there was always a bewildering series of
  cross-currents&mdash;envies and enmities open or hidden, masquerading
  sometimes in ways that drink, towards the end of a long evening, would
  reveal; it was this sort of thing that often led at Fulton-Griffin parties to
  the beginnings of scenes that were usually squelched before they made
  headlines owing to the Fulton-Griffin tactic of planting several reliable
  house servants to play guests among the guests. Thus there could develop a
  faintly sinister atmosphere. The strong-jawed man sipping bourbon at the edge
  of the pool might be getting ready either to push you in or fish you out.</p>

  <p>Carey felt exultant as she worked her way through the crowd. For one thing
  the rooms were cool, air-conditioned, with the windows wide open, an
  absurdity that yet contrived an enchantment, for pockets of blossom-scented
  air drifting in from the gardens were deliriously warm. An evening out of a
  travel folder, with starlit sky and flood-lit lawns to aid the illusion (as
  Paul had said after his one experience of a Fulton-Griffin party) that the
  cream of civilization had coagulated here and would make excellent cheese.
  Half the guests were already a little drunk. The buffet tables were still
  laden with food that (like the drink) was not quite excellent. On a platform
  beyond the swimming-pool a seven-piece orchestra played medleys. Some people
  were dancing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Carey saw Mr. Hare in a corner of the drawing-room all on his
  own. "Hello, Mr. Hare," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Arundel, this IS a surprise. You changed your mind?"</p>

  <p>"I often do."</p>

  <p>"So we CAN finish our talk. That's good."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but let's go outside. The gardens are lovely."</p>

  <p>They stepped through the French windows to the terrace, avoiding the crowd
  at the swimming-pool end and discovering a side path that led to a grove of
  eucalyptus trees.</p>

  <p>"I felt I had to come," she said, "just to show I don't feel all the
  things people are thinking I feel."</p>

  <p>"You're very wise." He took her arm and she knew the entire friendliness
  of the man; she liked, too, the way he went straight to what must be in both
  their minds. "What Saffron did say," he said, "as opposed to all the talk of
  what he said, wasn't really against YOU. Therefore there's nothing for you to
  be hurt or humiliated about."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you think that."</p>

  <p>"Just stupid of him and in bad taste."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, oh yes, I know it was."</p>

  <p>"Rather odd&mdash;coming just after you'd told me his speeches sometimes
  made you feel nervous."</p>

  <p>Had she said that? Oh yes, during the dinner. "Yes, wasn't it odd?"
  Because it really was.</p>

  <p>"You must have had a lot of experience of him."</p>

  <p>"Well, we were married, once."</p>

  <p>And it was odd, too, that he hadn't known that, because it obviously gave
  him a shock. "You WERE?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you know?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't, and as everybody else here must, it's rather astonishing nobody
  happened to mention it to me. I suppose they assumed I knew."</p>

  <p>"So you've been talking about me to people?"</p>

  <p>"A few people have been talking about you to me."</p>

  <p>"What do they say?"</p>

  <p>"They like you&mdash;and they don't like him."</p>

  <p>Well, that had always been so&mdash;almost always. She felt an
  overwhelming sadness as she answered: "They don't have to couple us together
  any more."</p>

  <p>"Except that you were in the picture together."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;for a special reason, but that's a long story&mdash;I might
  tell you some time if you're interested."</p>

  <p>Some men and girls were approaching.</p>

  <p>"Maybe tomorrow? Don't forget you have a date at my office. Make it
  eleven-thirty and I'll take you to lunch."</p>

  <p>"Fine." She would like that. But her thoughts were on Paul, now that he
  had been spoken of by both of them. She wondered where he was, what he was
  doing. She said, as they walked back towards the house: "He didn't show up
  here tonight, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm sure I'd have known if he had. Did you think he might?"</p>

  <p>"He's capable of it. If he'd been here I'd have wanted to leave&mdash;I
  couldn't stand any more." And that was true enough.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you."</p>

  <p>"I'm just about at the limit of what I can stand, to be frank."</p>

  <p>"You probably need that holiday in Ireland you talked about. But why
  Ireland?"</p>

  <p>"I was born there. Where were you born?"</p>

  <p>"Vermont... on a farm."</p>

  <p>"So was I. In County Kildare. The greenest fields, and my father rode the
  wildest and most beautiful horses..." The vision filled her&mdash;oh, the
  lovely country, the white clouds rolling shadows over the fields, the
  green-blue mountains in the distance. Her eyes could always fill when she
  thought of it, but now she was embarrassed because she knew Mr. Hare was
  watching her. She added: "Oh, I guess we all feel like that about where we
  were born. Vermont is beautiful too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, very." And then, telling her there was just time for one more
  question, he went on to say something that both amazed and puzzled her. He
  seemed to think it might, for he cautioned her in advance. "A rather personal
  question, so don't be startled... Did Saffron ever&mdash;in a dressing-room
  at the studio while the picture was being made&mdash;did he ever quarrel with
  you and threaten you with a gun?"</p>

  <p>She had to laugh. "Good heavens, no. Who on earth made that one up?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They separated inside the house and she guessed that he
left soon
  afterwards, before she did. She stayed till nearly one, talking and dancing
  with a few of the sober survivals, but when she was in her car driving
  downhill towards her apartment the beginnings of panic seized her. Would
  there have been more messages, newspaper enquiries? The desk man said: "Did
  you know you left your phone off the hook, Miss Arundel?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Oh, did I? Have there been calls?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a number..." He was going to hand her the slips but she said: "I
  can't do anything about them tonight&mdash;send them up tomorrow."</p>

  <p>She had hoped the apartment would seem cheerful to relax in after the long
  strain of the evening; it was really an elegant apartment, and if only it had
  been higher, as in New York, she felt it might have worked a miracle on her
  mood; she loved height, the look of streets spread out below, a corner window
  like the prow of a ship in air. She switched on all the lights and lit a
  cigarette. She did not know whether she could sleep or even whether she
  wanted to. In a way the evening had been her triumph&mdash;she had rallied
  friends and admirers in droves. Yet was there anyone, anywhere, now, at one
  in the morning, who would greet her warmly yet incuriously, welcomingly yet
  without drama, if she telephoned or rang a door-bell? Greg?... Austen?...
  Norris?... Even Paul?... It seemed to her that most of those she had talked
  to so excitingly throughout the evening were by now either drunk or climbing
  into some little bed, like Mr. Hare... Then suddenly she thought of Professor
  Lingard. How incredible that anyone should fill so exactly her precise
  requirements&mdash;Professor Lingard, who had given her a cordial invitation
  to look through his observatory telescope in the middle of some night! But he
  had warned her to telephone first, to find if the skies were clear enough. So
  she telephoned, and soon heard his voice, amiable and distant-sounding: "Why,
  yes, Miss Arundel... of course I remember... yes, wonderful... no, I'm
  working as usual... TONIGHT?... Why, certainly, you couldn't have chosen a
  better one... As soon as you like, then... An hour and a half, I should
  think&mdash;there'll be very little traffic... you know the way... but take
  it easy now, especially the last stretch..."</p>

  <p>The thought of leaving the city and driving into the mile-high mountains
  lifted her spirits again to a peak of their own; she changed into street
  clothes and went out. Her car had ample gas; she drove east along Sunset as
  far as Western, then turned north.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">There was no doubt of her mental plight. She was in
desperate need of
  reassurance which no one then available could give, and her own name on a
  darkened theatre marquee did nothing to help&mdash;rather the contrary, since
  it stressed the irony of being alone amidst so many sleeping strangers who
  knew her by sight and perhaps had warmed to her for a few moments of their
  waking lives. As she drove she felt the tingling of all her nerves into
  alternating fear and excitement, so that every car whose lights she saw in
  the rear-view mirror seemed to be following until it actually overtook; she
  was used to this illusion by now, and knew how foolish it was, but it made
  her drive a little faster than usual, though not recklessly. At the corner on
  Foothill where the climb began, the great eye of the observatory became a
  symbol in her mind of some ultimate scrutiny, and Professor Lingard himself a
  human answer to a different problem. For at their one meeting they had
  established kinship, she had been aware of it; she also guessed he was not a
  man to invite her to his mountain-top unless he had rather liked her. As she
  had said to Paul (the remark that had perhaps most of all shocked him), she
  found it easy to hit it off with men&mdash;Paul's phrase for whatever there
  was of murk or mystery in his own concept of the relationship. She had an
  idea she would find it easy to hit it off with Professor Lingard if only his
  physical eye would leave the heavens for a moment... and at that she began to
  smile, for the quality in her that she freely agreed was sensual was always
  mixed up with smiling and fun&mdash;a comedy role that Paul had disapproved
  after the first entrancement, and Austen had accepted but never perfectly
  understood.</p>

  <p>The mountains heaved into outlines against the blue-black sky; it was the
  smell of manzanita that crossed the roadway in gusts; the eyes of tiny
  animals blinked out of their secret, populated world... and there came to her
  mind the road over the Sally Gap, the climb so different from this, the car
  so different from this, herself so different from now, the point where she
  had left the road once and clambered through high gorse to the summit of
  Kippure; there had been tin cans on that summit, not left by picnickers but
  by gunmen on the run during the time of troubles&mdash;tin cans and rotting
  puttees and an old cartridge belt; and from the summit where one stood
  amongst the litter of men's idiocy one could see far over the Gap to the
  great names of Wicklow&mdash;Mullaghcleevaun and Lugnaquilla that lay over
  the vale of Glenmalure...</p>

  <p>And she remembered Paul as he had been for a little time after their
  marriage; his ways her own, his discovering joy over what was so natural to
  her, but partly as spectator even then, and later ceasing to applaud; his
  understanding of her that was deep at first, so that they had both felt that
  life could carry them on its own tide; but after a while the understanding
  had fled from the heart to the brain, and then (but only in his moments of
  greatness) back to a heart that was not hers.</p>

  <p>She remembered that year in Los Angeles (for Hollywood had not yet become
  the magnetic, polarizing name), the year he had tried to crash the picture
  industry on the ground floor, and it would have none of him; the great names
  &mdash;Chaplin, Sennett, Lasky, Griffith. If only, she had often thought, if
  only someone then had given him a chance he might have become as great as
  they, and with an easing of so many frustrations that had bedevilled him
  since&mdash;not all, but many. In vain he had written letters, submitted
  ideas, sought interviews; his stage success in London had counted for
  nothing. That was the second year after their marriage, and he had already
  wooed the New York stage equally in vain. Careers also have currencies, and
  sometimes a prestige account in one country is not transferable to another;
  at any rate nobody in Hollywood was interested in English press clippings
  about Othello. They had rented a frame bungalow between Western and Vermont
  for twenty dollars a month, Paul assuming that even if he couldn't find a
  studio job there was always journalism to fall back on. Gradually he had
  found how that, too, could fail him; either, after his taste of the stage, he
  could not write, or else the kind of thing he wrote had lost its small vogue.
  Merryweather was dead and there was no other editor interested in him. He
  kept on writing, nevertheless, and the stuff kept on coming back. Then, when
  they owed a couple of months' rent, she had taken a job as waitress in a
  restaurant on Pico Boulevard&mdash;hard work, but she could earn enough to
  keep them both till at last his chance came to direct a play in New York
  &mdash;the one that led to the first big success.</p>

  <p>And the strange thing was that this year in Los Angeles&mdash;the year he
  later chose to forget (because he thought of it only as the time and place of
  his failure)&mdash;had actually been the happiest in all her life. They had
  been so close together, and whenever she had returned from the restaurant or
  he after hours of fruitless job-seeking, the little house had been there to
  welcome them, its privacies their own and its tasks a pleasure. The first
  thing she had had to do was to patch the screens because of his phobia about
  flies; the second thing was to clip the pepper tree that did not let enough
  light into the room where he planned to work. And the last thing of all was
  on the day they left so jubilantly (he with the New York offer in his
  pocket); she had leaned out of the window as the taxi turned the corner, and
  something deep in her heart had said goodbye. For she had been able, in that
  house, to make him happy as never before or since; there he had needed her
  enough to accept the clearance she could make in the thickets of his emotions
  &mdash;a sunlit clearance before the jungle grew again.</p>

  <p>Strange, the moments of pure emotion one remembered. There was a play
  tried out at New Haven (or was it Philadelphia?)&mdash;it had flopped so
  badly it never reached Broadway, but a curious thing, a very curious thing,
  happened on the second night. It was a Civil War play, with Lincoln,
  McClellan, Seward, Pope, and others in it&mdash;poor fustian stuff, but Paul
  had believed he could make it spectacular&mdash;one of those mistakes of his
  that always seemed fewer than they were. Anyhow, there was this play, with
  authentic scenes and uniforms and guns booming off-stage; and on the second
  night the press agent had thought to invite local Civil War veterans as
  guests of the management. About half a dozen came&mdash;tottering into the
  front row and cupping their ears to catch the lines; afterwards Paul asked
  them on stage to meet the cast and be photographed. So they came, and nobody
  knew what to say except one old fellow who suddenly hobbled up to General
  McClellan and shook his gnarled fist in the actor's face while his own became
  contorted with rage. "For Christ's sake, you&mdash;&mdash;, why weren't you
  there to help us at Manassas?" He would have struck the actor had not others
  led him away. The whole incident was chilling to all who witnessed it, and
  made the paltry little play seem paltrier than ever. No one had any hopes of
  success after that; it was as if a curse had been laid.</p>

  <p>How odd the mixture when memory sinks its net into the past and makes a
  random haul, with the mind quiescent and bemused over its find, savouring the
  items with infinite detachment. For it was indeed a series of other Careys
  whom Carey saw in all these wayward recollections&mdash;a young woman
  climbing Kippure, a waitress serving pie  la mode, an actress in
  crinolines... and now a woman over forty with her name on a thousand
  marquees, driving an open Cadillac on a summer night to a mountain-top
  observatory.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Professor Lingard met her at the parking-place, where he
had apparently
  been waiting. Everywhere there was a vast cool silence to which the mind
  added its own image of height and loneliness. He greeted her warmly but
  seemed shyer than ever as he guided her by flashlight to the roadway. The
  stars were brilliant, but it was very dark under the shapes of trees.</p>

  <p>"You've chosen a grand night, Miss Arundel."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad. I was at a party and when I left I suddenly felt in the
  mood."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad too. I really didn't take you very seriously when you first
  promised you'd come. And then after I found out who you were... you must have
  thought me terribly stupid for not realizing..."</p>

  <p>"Oh no. Why should it matter?"</p>

  <p>"But it really was inexcusable. I felt so embarrassed when someone told me
  I'd been talking to Carey Arundel, the movie star..."</p>

  <p>Movie star... That was evidently all he knew&mdash;even now. "But you were
  very nice and friendly. I enjoyed our conversation."</p>

  <p>"So long as you've forgiven me, Miss Arundel. Because before you leave I'm
  going to take another liberty if I may."</p>

  <p>"Oh, please. ANYTHING."</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to sign an autograph book for a friend of mine... a little
  girl&mdash;she's ten&mdash;the daughter of the woman who comes in once a day
  to clean for me. You've no idea what it'll mean to her&mdash;and when I tell
  her Carey Arundel's actually BEEN here... I hope it isn't too much to
  ask?"</p>

  <p>She observed him in the faint glow that reflected back from the flashlight
  and wondered how far he was from reading what was in her mind.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll do it... and now please stop talking about Carey Arundel.
  I'm a little bit tired of her and if she doesn't mend her ways I've a good
  mind to shove her off a cliff... Is there a cliff by the way? I'm sure there
  must be."</p>

  <p>"Not just here, but you passed some steep ones on the way up. Of course
  you wouldn't see them at night. Some people find the road rather
  frightening."</p>

  <p>"Not me. I love heights... Tell me what you do here."</p>

  <p>"Technically? I don't think it would interest you very much, though if you
  really want me to I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, I mean the way you live&mdash;are you alone all the time? Do you
  feel happy? Is there peace of mind on a mountain-top?"</p>

  <p>They had reached a cabin the door of which he opened. Suddenly she felt:
  THIS IS HOME. There was actually a small log-fire burning and it was in the
  firelight that she saw the room first of all. "It gets chilly at nights even
  in summer," he explained; and the warmth was indeed a pleasant thing. A
  couch, chairs, desk, and radio-gramophone were the main furnishings. No
  pictures, only a strip of matting on the floor, a few books, a map of the
  area pinned on the log walls, an old-fashioned telephone. "There's also a
  bedroom, bathroom, and a small kitchen," he said, noticing her interest, but
  not knowing&mdash;how could he know?&mdash;that whenever she entered any room
  (except decorators' show pieces) her mind made an inventory as if she were
  looking for something lost from her own life. "Simple, Miss Arundel
  &mdash;primitive, I dare say it seems to you&mdash;but good enough for a
  bachelor... Won't you sit down? I'll tell my assistant to have things ready."
  He made the call while she watched him. There was a green-shaded lamp he
  switched on over the desk&mdash;it was almost the ugliest lamp she had ever
  seen, but doubtless in the right position for his work and that was all he
  cared about.</p>

  <p>"So you're not alone?" she said, when he had hung up.</p>

  <p>"He's a student. He likes to help me on good nights... And you were asking
  if I'm happy... of course I am. I wouldn't be up here if I weren't. I could
  probably earn more money down below."</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's where we can all earn more money."</p>

  <p>"You say 'sure' like the Irish, not like the Americans."</p>

  <p>"I was born in Ireland."</p>

  <p>"I THOUGHT there was an accent... no, not quite an accent&mdash;more a
  rhythm, a lilt. You can't lose it, can you? You shouldn't want to, anyhow.
  I'm from Wyoming."</p>

  <p>"Cowboys," she said absently.</p>

  <p>"Now that's odd&mdash;because I almost was a cowboy, and it's still what
  I'd rather be than anything else&mdash;except this. You like horses?"</p>

  <p>"Love them. Near where I was born there was the Curragh&mdash;that's the
  great place for horses."</p>

  <p>"And music? You like music too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Music and horses and dogs and..."</p>

  <p>"Classical music?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Bach?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a reply he went to the radio-gramophone, saying as he
  opened it: "We have a few minutes before he gets everything adjusted." He
  found a record close to hand. There was something in the way he let down the
  needle on to the outermost groove that seemed to her one of the most
  exquisite movements she had ever seen, and the thought came then that Paul
  would have seen it like that too, would have wanted to shoot it slowly and
  tenderly, and that Randolph later would have cut the whole scene. "But
  nothing happens, Saffron! A guy starts a record on a turntable and you let
  him use up all that footage!"</p>

  <p>Nothing happens... They would say that too, doubtless, of the Bach
  Chorale. The music just goes round and round...</p>

  <p>She listened and felt peaceful. The little room, the firelight, Bach...
  the mountain outside, above the world.</p>

  <p>Presently the record ended and he switched off the machine. He made no
  comment, did not even ask if she had liked it. Perhaps he feared she hadn't,
  perhaps he simply didn't care. He picked up the flashlight, toying with it,
  as if in hint that they should leave. She looked at him without moving. If
  only she could stay a while. If only he could grasp how comfortable she was
  where she was. If only he could guess the kind of reassurance she was
  seeking.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said suddenly. "What's going to happen?"</p>

  <p>"To happen? Where? How... how do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"To all of us... That's a terrible thing to ask, isn't it? But I thought
  you might have some professional ideas. Will the world blow itself up one of
  these days?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Some popular science writers have said so. I don't know enough
  to contradict them."</p>

  <p>"But you do know something about atomic energy&mdash;Einstein&mdash; all
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Not much, and even if I did it wouldn't make me a prophet of world
  affairs. I'm just an astronomer."</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what you really thought. If people like you don't give us
  the benefit of an honest opinion, no wonder we're all misled by people who
  aren't honest."</p>

  <p>"But is there much value in an unqualified person's opinion? Of course, if
  you ask, if I think there'll be a third world war&mdash;THAT sort of
  question&mdash;I dare say my guess is no worse than anybody else's."</p>

  <p>"DO you think there will be?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be surprised."</p>

  <p>"And if there is, do you think the world will destroy itself?"</p>

  <p>"You mean everything go bang all at once? I doubt that. Possibly there'll
  be a breakdown of what we now call civilization."</p>

  <p>"You don't think the invention of all kinds of horrible weapons will
  prevent the world from daring to go to war?"</p>

  <p>"It never has done before, though that's no proof that it couldn't
  happen."</p>

  <p>"But on the whole you'd stick to your first guess that civilization's on
  its way to suicide?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I'd put it quite like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suicide's an ugly word, isn't it? It's something hardly any of us would
  do individually&mdash;and yet collectively, if we take the road we've been
  warned is fatal, what else can you call it?"</p>

  <p>"I get your point, and it's not the ugliness of the word I'm chary of,
  it's the melodrama. If nature abhors a vacuum, I should say that science also
  abhors a catastrophe. In a sense it's too EASY to contemplate."</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you mean. Too Jules-Vernal, my husband once said. My
  first husband," she corrected herself, and then wondered why it had mattered
  enough to do so.</p>

  <p>He smiled. "Jules-Vernal? Of course, people still believed in progress in
  those days, so Jules Verne was just a romantic, but today, when every amateur
  talks calamity at every cocktail party... I'm sorry&mdash;I didn't mean to
  sound superior."</p>

  <p>"But you probably are superior&mdash;that's why I'm asking you these
  things. Isn't there anything we can do&mdash;any of us&mdash;you&mdash; or
  even me?"</p>

  <p>"That again I don't know. The problem seems to be worrying the best minds
  in the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If they ARE the best. And you're just an astronomer. So you'll go on with
  your work&mdash;up here&mdash;till the whistle blows?"</p>

  <p>"Well, won't movie people go on making pictures&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and bankers go on making money and lawyers go on filing suits and
  everyone else go on with whatever they do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, I expect they will."</p>

  <p>She said, after a rather tense pause: "You know, professor, it all reminds
  me of a play I was once in&mdash;a dreadful thing which we all realized was
  dreadful, yet we kept on rehearsing in a sort of hypnotic trance as if we
  were stuck in a groove of disaster and had to go through with it to the
  end."</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"It flopped&mdash;just as we'd all known it would."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think could have been done to prevent that?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody&mdash;maybe me, because I was the star&mdash;somebody after the
  first rehearsal should have said: 'Are we all crazy?'"</p>

  <p>"But if you all were, how would that have helped?"</p>

  <p>During the argument his voice had grown colder and more distant, until
  this last remark was more like an answer in ice, a final verdict, than a
  question. Then he got up, as if to change both the temperature and the
  perspective. She still looked at him without moving. If only she could stay a
  little longer...</p>

  <p>She said: "I'm not crazy any more like that. I think I would know now, and
  warn the others in time... IN TIME, of course, is the whole point. IS there
  time in the world today? Oh, but there must be. If we need a miracle we must
  have one. Suppose you were lost in a cave in pitch darkness, would you lie
  down and die or fumble around to try to find a way out?"</p>

  <p>"I'd try to find a way out, because I'd know there was one, since there'd
  been a way in."</p>

  <p>"But maybe the way out today ISN'T the way in. Perhaps that's the mistake
  we've been making." She broke off with a bemused smile. "I don't know why I
  suddenly feel so optimistic. Could it be the altitude? How high is it
  here?"</p>

  <p>He smiled also. "Five thousand seven hundred feet. And that reminds me of
  something somebody once said&mdash;Chesterton, I think&mdash;about the
  difference between the mathematician and the poet. The mathematician tries to
  get the heavens into his head, the poet tries to get his head into the
  heavens... But here, you see, even without being a poet..."</p>

  <p>"I have a stepson who's neither and yet he tries to do both," she
  interrupted. The word 'stepson', which she could not recall using before
  about Norris, threw her like a fluffed line in a play, so that she went on,
  less securely: "He had an idea to study medicine and go out to some tropical
  island and doctor the natives. No particular reason except that he thought
  he'd rather do it than anything else."</p>

  <p>"Then he should. That's one of the best reasons for doing anything."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad to hear you say that."</p>

  <p>He was looking at his watch. "I think everything will be ready by now...
  Oh, but before we go&mdash;I mustn't forget." He pulled open the drawer and
  found the little girl's autograph book. He was the nave one now, warmer and
  closer. "Her first name's Milly&mdash;she left it for me to write in, but
  when she finds your name too..." He offered his pen.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course." She took the book and wrote in it: "For Milly from Carey
  Arundel with love. 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring.'" And the date.</p>

  <p>"It's really most kind of you to take the trouble, Miss Arundel."</p>

  <p>"Oh no. No trouble at all. I wish it were always as easy to give a little
  pleasure."</p>

  <p>Then he saw what she had written. She could see it startled him.
  "That's... that's very nice. But I'll have to explain it to her, won't
  I?"</p>

  <p>"You can show her the label on the record and say you played it here
  tonight and I wanted to do something, somehow, so that it shouldn't ever be
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"_I_ wouldn't have forgotten... Shall we walk over now?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He guided her again by flashlight along the pathway that
led across the
  rounded hump of the mountain-top to the Observatory. The huge aluminium
  structure glistened dimly as they approached it. He began to talk about what
  she would presently see, and after she had met his assistant (a good-looking
  youth named Christianson) his manner became progressively more impersonal. It
  was doubtless the same little lecture he had given to countless other
  visitors&mdash;terse, elementary, decked out with a few simple-minded
  witticisms. He even perpetrated the most obvious of all&mdash;"A star come to
  look at the stars," he told Christianson. It was all Miss Arundel this and
  Miss Arundel that, but she knew that in a truer sense his politeness and
  admiration stopped short of real concern; she was just a charming inhabitant
  of a lower world who earned as much in a week as he did in a year; AND HE DID
  NOT CARE. Out of sheer kindness he would have done as much for her, perhaps
  more, had she been Mrs. Anybody from Anywhere.</p>

  <p>When they left, after an hour or so, he asked if she would like some
  coffee, but she felt he hoped she would decline; she had heard Christianson
  locking up as they walked away, and it occurred to her that probably they
  would both go to bed as soon as she had gone.</p>

  <p>Christianson caught up with them as they reached the parking lot. It was
  about a quarter to four. He said: "It's almost dawn. You'll see the sunrise
  before you're home. Wouldn't you rather have the top up? It'll be
  chilly."</p>

  <p>"No, I like it open. I'll wear this extra coat."</p>

  <p>Lingard helped her on with it. "What a beautiful car! You should hear my
  old jalopy wheezing and sputtering when I bring it up here... Mind how you
  take the curves."</p>

  <p>She put out her hand. "It's been so nice, professor. I can't tell you how
  much I've enjoyed it."</p>

  <p>"The firmament or the argument?"</p>

  <p>"Both. And Bach too. Now THERE'S a man who had his head in the
  heavens."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and didn't do too badly on earth either. I think he had twenty
  children." He laughed and turned to Christianson. "I played my favourite
  record for Miss Arundel while we were waiting. The Chorale."</p>

  <p>She laughed back as she answered: "Why, of course, THAT'S why I feel
  optimistic. Bach abhors a catastrophe too... Twenty, did he? How
  wonderful!... And please, professor, do give me a ring when you come down to
  earth&mdash;either of you, or both of you&mdash;I'm probably going away
  fairly soon, so don't leave it too long... Oh dear, I'm not in the book
  &mdash;I'd better give you my number."</p>

  <p>She began fishing in her purse, but he said: "Just tell it to me. I can
  always remember numbers."</p>

  <p>"You're sure you can? It's Excelsior 16641."</p>

  <p>"That's easy. Happens to be the square of 129... Good night, Miss Arundel.
  And thanks again for the autographing."</p>

  <p>"Good night... Good morning, rather. Goodbye, Mr. Christianson."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">She started the car and drove away. What she intended to do
was not even
  then quite clear in her mind; final decision, like Paul's, might come by
  chance or caprice, some lightning alchemy of time or place. The music, like
  the road, like something in her own head, went round and round&mdash;and who
  would have thought that 16641 was the square of 129? That revelation, with
  all its hint of things hidden before one's own eyes, made some mental link
  with the look of emptiness as she turned the downhill corners; it was almost
  dawn, but the sky seemed blacker, far more abysmal than on the way up. No
  doubt cars had met with accidents or near-accidents on this road before; the
  headlights showed up the scuffs on the guard-rails. No guard-rails on the
  road over the Sally Gap, where she had driven once with her mother and
  Fitzpomp in an old-fashioned horse-drawn wagonette&mdash;skies cloudy-clear,
  mountains blue-green in the sun-shadow, no talk of trouble in those days, so
  it must have been before the Easter Rebellion; that would make her eleven
  years old or less. Poor little Fitzpomp with his asthma pills and Gaelic
  verbs and the muscle-building machine. Those walks with him, her
  little-girl's hand in his, sometimes through the fields beside the Dodder, or
  along the Blessington road where the steam tram tooted a greeting as it
  passed... and then the final scene, obliterating all others when she let
  herself think of it... the house in Terenure that Sunday morning, poor little
  Fitzpomp, leaving her that letter... unwilling for her to think (even if she
  could) that it was all a mishap&mdash;unwilling to quit the play without the
  fullest value of an exit. And the quote from Seneca&mdash;the stoic
  quote&mdash;"One cannot complain of life, for it keeps no one against his
  will ". Perhaps, though, if one had acted professionally in life, one could
  more easily resist that last temptation&mdash;as a good actor will sometimes,
  for the sheer selflessness of it, take his leave as unmemorably as he can. Or
  perhaps if one had (to use Paul's phrase) a ready-made audience for the next
  thing one did, no matter what it was, one could choose that next thing, no
  matter what it was, with some deep regard for others... Poor Fitzpomp, with
  no ready-made audience at all... She saw in passing that at one point the
  guard-rail was broken; maybe some car had actually gone through. She thought
  of the crash, the curving fall, the few seconds of being almost airborne...
  she remembered a scene like that in a movie, a car upturned at the foot of a
  cliff, its occupants dead, but a radio freakishly undamaged, and
  music&mdash;dance music&mdash;going round and round... She switched on her
  own car radio. Sure enough, dance music. Then, after a moment, an early
  morning news bulletin... Berlin... President Truman... the Iron Curtain... a
  sentence that made her laugh aloud. "Mother Nature went on a rampage
  yesterday in our nation's capital." How Paul would enjoy that. Mother Nature
  went on a rampage. She had always had far more time for radio listening than
  he, and had gathered these flowers whenever she chanced on them and offered
  them to him like nosegays. She must remember that one, if... if, that is, she
  ever saw him again. Then suddenly she heard his name.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As soon as she realized he was at that moment quite
probably in jail, she
  felt cool, rather indignant, and also very slightly amused. Apparently no one
  had been hurt, just a few fenders dented, it was not a serious case. But she
  was indignant because she knew he could not have been drunk; he never did
  drink too much, he had got over all his excesses in youth, he always said
  contemptuously, but that of course did not include his central excess of
  being exactly what he was. She could imagine that this might be what had
  caused the trouble with the police. It had been the same, once, in New York
  &mdash;and then there had been that more serious trouble in London, when only
  the judge had finally believed him. He would certainly not have been at his
  best on his way home from that Critics' Dinner.</p>

  <p>She reached the corner where the mountain road joined the main highway;
  from there the driving was much safer, with easier curves and fewer cliffs;
  the sky, too, was lightening a little. All at once she felt uncontrollably
  sleepy. She pinched herself to keep her eyes open till she came to a roadside
  space behind some trees. There she parked and put the top up, intending to
  take no more than a short nap, but when she woke there was bright sunshine
  and it was 10 A.M. by her wrist-watch.</p>

  <p>Dismayed by having lost so much time she drove on, listening to the radio
  for more news about Paul. But there was nothing except a mention that the
  case would come up that morning&mdash;might possibly, she surmised, be in
  progress at that very moment. Some of the more important bulletins ignored
  the matter altogether, and this reminded her that it was not, after all, an
  earth-shaking event. That was the trouble with this movie world; its own
  belief that it tremendously mattered was more infectious than one
  realized.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she laughed aloud as she had laughed on the way down the mountain
  in darkness, but this time at something that occurred to her. Mr. Hare had
  asked about Paul threatening her with a gun, and she had found the question
  completely mystifying, till now she recalled that studio lunch-hour when, in
  her dressing-room, Paul had rehearsed the shooting scene from his old German
  picture, taking the man's part himself and picking up one of the metal tubes
  that his cigars came in. Someone must have seen and heard all that from a
  distance... how absurd! She wished she had thought of the explanation in time
  to tell Mr. Hare. And that reminded her of several appointments that morning
  &mdash;publicity at the studio, lunch with Mr. Hare... of course she could
  not keep either of them, she must see Paul first. It came to her quite
  naturally now that she must see him as soon as she could, just to say she was
  not particularly angry (as everyone would assure him she was). And because
  everyone would assure her she ought to be, she did not want to see or talk to
  anyone else before seeing him. She would let him know she had been a little
  upset at the time, but after all... did it matter? What DID matter? Did
  ANYTHING matter? Poor little Fitzpomp had probably taken his own life because
  he thought that nothing mattered. On the other hand it was possible to think
  so quite happily if there were only the merest loophole, one's own private
  SOMETHING tucked away in mind&mdash;like Bach, or even the square roots of
  telephone numbers...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When she reached the streets she stopped at a drug store
for coffee and
  also to telephone Paul at his apartment. She hardly expected him to be back
  there yet, but it was just possible. She did not leave her name, and the desk
  clerk (meaningfully, she thought) said he had not been in since the previous
  day. She drove on through the suburbs. The noon news on the radio told her
  that the case had ended in a fifty dollar fine. Not so bad. She telephoned
  his apartment again from quite close; still he was out. Then she parked
  across the street and waited. If he did not come within an hour or two she
  would try some other way.</p>

  <p>He came within half an hour, driving up in a taxi, alone. She made a
  U-turn, meeting the kerb behind the taxi; the man saw her man&oelig;uvre and
  was about to drive off again when Paul also saw her and made some wild
  gesture. "Here&mdash;HERE!" she called out, holding open the door of her car
  while Paul fumbled with money on the pavement. Why on earth doesn't he give
  the man a five or a ten quickly? she thought; but that too was like Paul
  &mdash;a big tip, which came from him often, was an expression of his mood,
  not of any need to get special service. At last he had counted it out and was
  clambering into the seat next to her. "I thought at first you were someone
  from a paper," he began breathlessly, with no hello or greeting and no
  seeming surprise that she was there. "But I guess they've had all they can
  use."</p>

  <p>"Sure," she said, making a fast gear change. "You've given them all they
  can use."</p>

  <p>But then, as she turned the car round the block and headed west along the
  coast highway, she eyed him sideways and thought he looked rather ill as well
  as tired and unkempt; and that made her continue, less severely: "The best
  way to talk is to drive&mdash;that is, if you want to talk. I don't know what
  you want, but I didn't think you'd get much peace today at your apartment.
  But it'll all die down soon, don't worry. You're not that important."</p>

  <p>"You'd have thought so this morning&mdash;from the crowd. The judge got
  mad at them." There was just the faintest twinkle of pride as he said that,
  and it annoyed her.</p>

  <p>"Did you count the house?" she asked, and that annoyed him. As so often
  when they met they had to go through this phase of mutual annoyance. She went
  on: "Tell me what happened."</p>

  <p>He gave her what she expected, and had thought she might as well get over,
  once and for all&mdash;a vivid description of an innocent man's martyrdom.
  She could judge that from the moment the police arrested him he had made
  things as unpleasant for himself as possible&mdash;refusing to call a lawyer
  or post a bond. "I thought I might as well get the full value of an
  experience out of it," he said. "And I did, and it was interesting. Quite
  HORRIBLY interesting, Carey. It gave me an idea for a modern Inferno&mdash;
  the purely visual degradation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He went on with the details and she wished she hadn't started the subject;
  a modern Inferno was just an idea for him to forget, if only because he was
  always personally influenced by the current enthusiasm of his mind. She
  interrupted him to say: "You'd like a wash and a shave and a good long rest,
  I imagine."</p>

  <p>"No, don't stop yet. I'm glad you met me like this. And you're right about
  the apartment&mdash;I wouldn't get any peace there. They don't like me.
  They'd let anybody up to disturb me."</p>

  <p>"You don't look very well."</p>

  <p>"My God, did you expect me to BLOOM after a night in a tank with a lot of
  drunks and perverts? Sorry&mdash;I didn't mean to snap at you. To tell you
  the truth, the whole thing EXCITED me&mdash;gave me a headache too. One of
  those bad ones. Of course, not from drinking."</p>

  <p>"I know. I knew it couldn't really be that. Why did the police think it
  was?"</p>

  <p>"Ach... those fellows. I couldn't walk in a straight line. And it's a
  fact, I couldn't. Any more than I could park the car. I never was good at
  that, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I'd like some coffee."</p>

  <p>"We'll stop somewhere."</p>

  <p>"We'll be recognized."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. And what if we are? Who cares?"</p>

  <p>"I'll pull my hat down."</p>

  <p>"It isn't you they're likely to recognize."</p>

  <p>"No? After all the photographs in the papers? You know how they do it,
  Carey? The man with the camera squats on his heels and shoots upwards through
  the bars, so that the nostrils gape and the eyebrow shadows reach half-way
  across the forehead. And then, God help them, they say the camera can't lie.
  Of course it can lie. Because the Eye can lie. In the beginning was the Eye.
  Long before the Word. The Eye can tell no more truth than the brain behind it
  &mdash;the Eye lied when the first caveman saw a shape one night and hurled a
  spear and found he'd killed his wife instead of a sabre-toothed tiger!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they were rather hard to tell apart," she said, and then went on:
  "Oh, Paul, I must tell you something I heard on the radio this morning.
  Apparently there was a big wind blowing in Washington and the news announcer
  said 'Mother Nature went on a rampage in our nation's capital'. I thought
  you'd enjoy that."</p>

  <p>He did, as she had guessed, but then seemed abruptly deflated. "Rampage,
  rampage," he muttered. "You think that's a good word for something I go on at
  times?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do."</p>

  <p>They stopped at a roadside place where there was as good a chance of being
  unrecognized as anywhere, and she persuaded him to have a bowl of soup as
  well as coffee. The heat and stuffiness of the place made him instantly
  drowsy; his eyes kept closing and she noticed that in bringing the spoon to
  his mouth he often touched his cheek first, as if his hand was not in perfect
  co-ordination. She remarked on this, as casually as she could. "Do you know
  you do that, Paul?"</p>

  <p>He replied rather crossly: "No, and what of it?" Then he smiled in
  apology. "Reminds me of the only time I tried to play golf. Greg took me
  round at Carmel. I simply couldn't hit the ball. Not once."</p>

  <p>That didn't astonish her so much as the fact that Greg had ever succeeded
  in putting a club in his hand and getting him on to a course. And then she
  remembered Interlaken: Paul in shorts, gathering wild flowers in a wood. The
  things he would do under stress of a personal enthusiasm&mdash;for Wanda
  then, for Greg recently. She said: "Anyhow, I'm glad Greg made you take some
  physical exercise."</p>

  <p>He said gloomily: He won't again. I'm through with him."</p>

  <p>"WHAT? With GREG?"</p>

  <p>"After last night you bet I am. For him to talk to ME like that&mdash;
  just because I made a speech he hadn't either the brains or the guts to
  swallow! What would he be without me, I'd like to know?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty much what he is now, darling&mdash;a successful movie actor."</p>

  <p>"But Morning Journey's given him a new reputation&mdash;the first picture
  he's ever got an award for&mdash;the nearest he ever came in his life to a
  real acting performance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the worst picture you ever made, don't forget. You really are a bit
  inconsistent, Paul. Does this mean, then, that you're not going abroad with
  Greg as you planned?"</p>

  <p>"That's all out of the question now."</p>

  <p>"So what will you do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered heavily. "I only know I want to get away some
  place."</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I'd like you to do," she went on, with as much and as
  little emphasis as she dared. "Have a checkup with a doctor. The one who saw
  you at the studio said you ought, but you never did. I wish you would, Paul.
  You're not young any more." She added quickly: "Neither am I."</p>

  <p>She paid the bill and they left the restaurant. There had been no mention
  so far of where they were driving to, or for how long. They were some twenty
  or thirty miles out, she wasn't quite sure where. She drove on, as the only
  alternative to turning back, and after another few miles during which he was
  silent she saw that his head had slumped forward. This was not unusual when
  he was being driven, but now for some reason she stopped the car and looked
  at him intently. That made him wake up.</p>

  <p>"You were asleep," she said.</p>

  <p>"I guess I didn't sleep at all last night."</p>

  <p>"Neither did I&mdash;till early this morning. Then I slept in the car by
  the roadside. I can have adventures too, can't I? I'll tell you all about it
  if... Or no; sleep if you'd rather." Then she felt, still watching him, a
  sudden tightness in her voice. He looked so worn, so shop-soiled; maybe it
  was the late sunlight, shining in his face as they drove west&mdash;
  spotlight on Lear in a not too good production. "Oh, Paul, anything you like
  if only you don't get ill. Will you do what I ask and see a doctor?"</p>

  <p>Weakly, surprisingly, he nodded.</p>

  <p>"When, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Any time."</p>

  <p>"Now?"</p>

  <p>He half nodded, and she drove on to the next doctor as if it had been to
  the next gas station. It was beginning to be dusk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The doctor was intelligent, exact, and considerably
interested in his two
  chance visitors. Also he was clearly not a movie fan. She entered his
  unpretentious office first, leaving Paul in the waiting-room, dozing off.
  There were no other patients waiting and she rather gathered she had found
  him in by chance at such an hour. Paul's general appearance and need of sleep
  were not unnatural after the kind of night he had spent, but of course she
  had to think of some other explanation to tell the doctor. "We're touring,"
  she said, "and I think it's been too much for him. He has a bad headache.
  Perhaps it's the heat... but I'm a little worried and I thought..."</p>

  <p>"And the name?" he said, pulling a pad towards him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Bond."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll have a look at him." He left his desk and opened the door to
  the waiting-room. Carey went past him towards Paul. She touched Paul's
  shoulder but he did not move; he was breathing heavily, snoring a little, the
  head sagging on the chest. The doctor walked across. "I guess your father's
  taking a real nap," he said, stooping over Paul with a smile.</p>

  <p>"He's not my father." She had spoken before she could check herself.</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"He's..." She had to say something now. "He's my husband."</p>

  <p>The doctor was already shaking Paul more vigorously. At last Paul wakened,
  blinked to find where he was, then with a sharp shift to gentleness and
  courtesy, apologized to the doctor. The latter kept on smiling. "That's all
  right, Mr. Bond." Still only half awake as he staggered into the office on
  the doctor's arm, Paul did not seem to notice.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">He went out to the car afterwards, while she talked to the
doctor.</p>

  <p>"Quite a sick man you've got, Mrs. Bond," he began, and her heart fell
  through the guard-rail into some abyss of its own.</p>

  <p>"He is?" she stammered foolishly. "He... he really IS?"</p>

  <p>"I'd advise you to call off your holiday and get him home. Then put him in
  the care of his regular doctor. Maybe you should take the train if you've
  come a long way."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, not far&mdash;just from... inside the state."</p>

  <p>He looked as if he expected her to say more. "Well, don't do any more
  travelling today. Take him to some hotel&mdash;the Bristol up the road isn't
  so bad&mdash;and let him have a good long sleep. He said he didn't get any
  last night. Were you driving late?"</p>

  <p>"No... no..."</p>

  <p>"He seems quite exhausted."</p>

  <p>"Yes... but... it's not... is it, I mean... is it anything VERY
  serious?"</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't get rest it could be."</p>

  <p>"But with rest... he'll be all right?"</p>

  <p>"There's a very good chance of it... What does he do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"He's&mdash;he's in business."</p>

  <p>"For himself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes." Even at such a moment she could not help thinking wryly how well
  the phrase suited all Paul's activities since he was born.</p>

  <p>"That's fortunate&mdash;he can take things easily, then, if he wants to.
  Men like him at his age are a problem&mdash;if they were working men they'd
  be glad enough to retire, but because they have their own businesses to run
  they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's not so old," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"He told me sixty-three."</p>

  <p>It was on her tongue to exclaim: "WHAT? Why, he's only FIFTY-three!"
  &mdash;but then she thought there was little point in developing the issue.
  She said: "Well, that's not so very old"&mdash;and all the time she was
  wondering why on earth Paul had added ten years to his age. Was it because of
  some twisted vanity that made him want to hear the comment: "You certainly
  don't look it"? But the tragic thing was that he DID look it; to be sure of
  the pleasing answer he should have added twenty years.</p>

  <p>"Has he been under any particular strain lately?" the doctor was
  asking.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, he..." She managed to check herself this time. "His life's
  more or less all strain&mdash;the way he works."</p>

  <p>He was clearly puzzled by her reticences, but as they continued to talk
  she felt that his own were at least as great. She said at last: "You haven't
  really told me what's the matter with him, have you?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather your own doctor do that when there's been a chance to make a
  complete examination."</p>

  <p>"That... sounds... rather frightening. I wish you could give me some
  idea."</p>

  <p>He scrutinized her.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather know, whatever it is," she went on. "I'm that kind of
  person."</p>

  <p>"Well... if you won't let the word scare you, it looks to me he may have
  had a slight stroke recently."</p>

  <p>"Is that... possible?"</p>

  <p>"Without knowing it, you mean? Yes, if it was only very slight. Certain
  symptoms... but there again, your own doctor..."</p>

  <p>She paid the fee, thanked him, heard his final words of advice ("take it
  easy on the trip"), then went out to the car. It was dark by then. Paul was
  fast asleep and she drove on till she saw the hotel. When she stopped and he
  wakened she could see he was unaware they had travelled further. He said, as
  if she had just come out of the doctor's office: "Over-work and high blood
  pressure. That's all he told me. He tell you anything else?"</p>

  <p>"About the same."</p>

  <p>"And how much was the bill for all that?"</p>

  <p>"Ten dollars."</p>

  <p>"He must have seen the car." It was always his contention since she had
  rented a Cadillac that everyone would overcharge her. "Nice fellow, though. I
  like Mexicans. He told me this town is a third Mexican."</p>

  <p>"He told me you must rest, Paul."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know."</p>

  <p>"Then you start resting... now."</p>

  <p>He let her take him into the hotel and book rooms and sign the register as
  she had always done when they had travelled together, and when he entered the
  bedroom he went straight to the window and pulled the curtains, ready to
  fulminate if there were no screens. But there were screens. Then he strode
  through the bathroom to her bedroom and came back and lay on the bed in his
  own room and lit a cigar. "I asked if I could smoke and he said two a day.
  I'll bet he didn't know how big these are."</p>

  <p>She pulled a chair close to where his arm would swing down, and put an
  ash-tray on it.</p>

  <p>"So this is the Bristol," he said, contemplating the ceiling. "Remember
  the Bristol in Vienna? No, you weren't with me then... But this is another
  kind of Bristol. Spittoons in the lobby polished every morning. My ideal of
  cleanliness... Oh dear, I'm sorry I'm so sleepy. I'll be all right tomorrow.
  What do we do then?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. We'll settle that when tomorrow comes. This is today."</p>

  <p>"And what a day, from start to finish!... How kind you are to me,
  Carey."</p>

  <p>"Why wouldn't I be?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred reasons if you weren't you."</p>

  <p>"But I am, I always am."</p>

  <p>He was silent for a few moments, then said: "D'you think I'll ever be able
  to do any work again?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you will."</p>

  <p>"I wonder..."</p>

  <p>He had spoken so sadly and sincerely, not dramatically at all, that she
  sat down on the bed and took the hand that did not hold the cigar. She
  thought with calmness: If he dies, what will _I_ do? Will I be free or will
  freedom be another kind of bondage to all I can remember? Because so long as
  he's alive, anywhere, with anybody... and if that be love, let it flow from
  me to him whenever he needs it, as now... Oh, Paul, why did I ever meet you
  if it were not for this, yet why did I ever meet you if it were only for
  this? So I'm back at last, or you are, it doesn't matter which, but it's
  late, isn't it?... it's so terribly late...</p>

  <p>She whispered: "You will work again, when you're rested enough. I'll help
  you, I'll be with you&mdash;you know you can count on me. I can work too
  &mdash;I'll do another picture or a stage play or something. And one of these
  days, darling, but not yet&mdash;because you need that long rest &mdash;one
  of these days, though, you'll make that picture about children you talked
  of&mdash;the one where the camera itself is a child&mdash;you were going to
  tell me about it once when someone came in and interrupted... don't you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>He seemed not to at first, but soon he either did so or else began to
  think about it as if it were a new idea. She did not want to excite him, but
  the look that came into his face was the look of life itself and it brought
  life to her. "I think I'd shoot from three feet above the ground," he
  muttered. "Everything in a child's-eye view&mdash;a child's proportion
  &mdash;a smile makes the sun shine twice as bright&mdash;we could get a
  lighting effect for that... and the eye widening like a lens&mdash;
  everything big when it loves something&mdash;an apple, a toy, the mother's
  breast, a dog as big as a horse..."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes, sighing contentedly. After a little while she knew he
  was asleep again, so she took the cigar from his hand and laid it down.</p>
