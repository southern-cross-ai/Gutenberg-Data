  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ah, um yes, Mr. Speed, is it not?...Welcome, sir! Welcome
  to Millstead!" Kenneth Speed gripped the other's hand and smiled. He was a
  tall passably good-looking fellow in his early twenties, bright-eyed and
  brown-haired. At the moment he was feeling somewhat nervous, and always when
  he felt nervous he did things vigorously, as if to obscure his secret
  trepidation. Therefore when he took hold of the soft moist hand that was
  offered him he grasped it in such a way that its possessor winced and gave a
  perceptible gasp.</p>

  <p>"Delighted to meet you, sir," said the young man briskly, and his voice,
  like his action, was especially vigorous because of nervousness. It was not
  nervousness of interviewing a future employer, or of receiving social
  initiation into a new world; still less was it due to any consciousness of
  personal inferiority; it was an intellectual nervousness, based on an acute
  realisation of the exact moment when life turns a fresh corner which may or
  may not lead into a blind alley. And as Kenneth Speed felt the touch of this
  clammy elderly hand, he experienced a sudden eager desire to run away, out of
  the dark study and through the streets to the railway-station whence he had
  come. Absurd and ignoble desire, he told himself, 'shrugging his shoulders
  slightly as if to shake off an unpleasant sensation. He saw the past
  kaleidoscopically, the future as a mere vague following-up of the immediate
  present. A month ago he had been a resident undergraduate at Cambridge. Now
  he was Kenneth Speed, B.A., Arts' Master at Millstead School. The
  transformation seemed to him for the time being all that was in life.</p>

  <p>It was a dull glowering day towards the end of April, most appropriately
  melancholy for the beginning of term. It was one of those days when the sun
  had been bright very early, and by ten o'clock the sky dappled with white
  clouds; by noon the whiteness had dulled and spread to leaden patches of
  grey; now, at mid-afternoon, a cold wintry wind rolled them heavily across
  the sky and piled them on to the deep gloom of the horizon. The Headmaster's
  study, lit from three small windows through which the daylight, filtered by
  the thick spring foliage of lime trees, struggled meagrely, was darker even
  than usual, and Speed, peering around with hesitant inquisitive eyes,
  received no more than a confused impression of dreariness. He could see the
  clerical collar of the man opposite gleaming like a bar of ivory against an
  ebony background.</p>

  <p>The voice, almost as soft and clammy as the hand, went on: "I hope yon
  will be very comfortable here, Mr. Speed. We are&mdash;urn yes&mdash;an old
  foundation, and we have our&mdash;um yes&mdash;our
  traditions&mdash;and&mdash;um&mdash;so forth...You will take music and
  drawing, I understand?"</p>

  <p>"That was the arrangement, I believe."</p>

  <p>His eyes, by now accustomed to the gloom, saw over the top of the dazzling
  white collar a heavy duplicated chin and sharp clean-cut lips, lips in which
  whatever was slightly gentle was also slightly shrewd. Above them a huge
  promontory of a nose leaned back into deep-set eyes that had each a tiny
  spark in them that pierced the dusk like the gleaming tips of a pair of
  foils. And over all this a wide blue-veined forehead curved on to a bald
  crown on which the light shone mistily. There was fascination of a sort in
  the whole impression; one felt that the man might be almost physically a part
  of the dark study, indissolubly one with the leather-bound books and the
  massive mahogany pedestal-desk; a Pope, perhaps, in a Vatican born with him.
  And when he moved his finger to push a bell at his elbow Speed started as if
  the movement had been in some way sinister.</p>

  <p>"Ah yes, that will be all right&mdash;um&mdash;music and drawing.
  Perhaps&mdash;um&mdash;commercial geography for the&mdash;um&mdash;lower
  forms, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't know much about commercial geography."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;um yes&mdash;I suppose not. Still&mdash;easy to acquire,
  you know. Oh yes, quite easy...Come in..."</p>

  <p>This last remark, uttered in a peculiar treble wail, was in response to a
  soft tap at the door. It opened and a man stepped into the shadows and made
  his way to the desk with cat-like stealthiness.</p>

  <p>"Light the gas, Potter...And by the way, Mr. Speed will be in to dinner."
  He turned to the young man and said, as if the enquiry were merely a matter
  of form: "You'll join us for dinner to-night, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Speed replied: "I shall be delighted."</p>

  <p>He wondered then what it was in the dark study that made him feel eerily
  sensitive and observant; so that, for instance, to watch Potter standing on a
  chair and lighting the incandescent globes was to feel vividly and uncannily
  the man's feline grace of movement. And what was it in the Headmaster's
  quivering blade-like eyes that awakened the wonder as to what these dark
  book-lined walls had seen in the past, what strange, furtive conversations
  they had heard, what scenes of pity and terror and fright and, might be, of
  blind suffering they had gazed upon?</p>

  <p>The globes popped into yellow brilliance The dark study took sudden shape
  and coherence; the shadows were no longer menacing. And the Headmaster, the
  Reverend Bruce Ervine, M.A., D.D., turned out to be no more than a plump
  apoplectic-looking man with a totally bald head.</p>

  <p>Speed's eyes, blinking their relief, wandered vacantly over the
  bookshelves. He noticed Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" in twelve volumes, the
  Expositor's Bible in twenty volumes, the Encyclopaedia Britannica in forty
  volumes, a long shelf of the Loeb classical series, and a huge group of
  lexicons surmounting like guardian angels a host of small school
  text-books.</p>

  <p>"Dinner is at seven, then, Mr. Speed. We&mdash;we do not
  dress&mdash;except for-um yes&mdash;for special occasions...If
  you&mdash;um&mdash;have nothing to do this afternoon&mdash;you might find a
  stroll into the town interesting&mdash;there are some
  Roman&mdash;um&mdash;earthworks that are extremely&mdash;um
  yes&mdash;extremely fascinating. Oh yes, really...Harrington's the stationers
  will sell you a guide...I don't think there are any-um&mdash;duties we need
  trouble you with until to-morrow...um yes...Seven o'clock then, Mr.
  Speed..."</p>

  <p>"I shall be there, sir."</p>

  <p>He bowed slightly and backed himself through the green-baize double doors
  into the stone corridor.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He climbed the stone flights of steps that led to the School
  House dormitories and made his way to the little room in which, some hours
  earlier, the school porter, squirming after tips, had deposited his trunks
  and snit-case. Over the door, in neat white letters upon a black background,
  he read: "Mr. K. Speed."&mdash;It seemed to him almost the name of somebody
  else. He looked at it, earnestly and contemplatively, until he saw that a
  small boy was staring at him from the dormitory doorway at the end of the
  passage. That would never do; it would be fatal to appear eccentric. He
  walked into the room and shut the door behind him. He was alone now and could
  think. He saw the bare distempered walls with patches of deeper colour where
  pictures had been hung; the table covered with a green-baize cloth; the
  shabby pedestal-desk surmounted by a dilapidated inkstand; the empty
  fire-grate into which somebody, as if in derision, had cast quantities of red
  tissue-paper. An inner door opened into a small bedroom, and here his
  critical eye roved over the plain deal chest of drawers, the perfunctory
  wash-hand stand (it was expected, no doubt, that masters would wash in the
  prefects' bathroom), and the narrow iron bed with the hollow still in it that
  last term's occupant had worn. He carried his luggage in through the
  separating door and began to unpack.</p>

  <p>But he was quite happy. He had always had the ambition to be a master at a
  public-school. He had dreamed about it; he was dreaming about it now. He was
  bursting with new ideas and new enthusiasms, which he hoped would be
  infectious, and Millstead, which was certainly a good school, would doubtless
  give him his chance. Something in Ervine's dark study had momentarily damped
  his enthusiasm, but ()Ely momentarily; and in any case he was not afraid of
  an uncomfortable bed or of a poorly-furnished room. When he had been at
  Millstead a little while he would, he decided, import some furniture from
  home; it would not, however, be wise to do everything in a hurry. For the
  immediate present a few photographs on the mantelpiece, Medici prints on the
  walls, a few cushions, books of course, and his innumerable undergraduate
  pipes and tobacco-jars, would wreak a sufficiently pleasant
  transformation.</p>

  <p>He looked through the open lattice-windows and saw, three storeys below,
  the headmaster's garden, the running-track, and beyond that the smooth green
  of the cricket-pitch. Leaning out and turning his head sharply to the left he
  could see the huge red blocks of Milner's and Lavery's, the two other houses,
  together with the science buildings and the squat gymnasium. He felt already
  intimate with them; he anticipated in a sense the peculiar closeness of their
  relationship with his life. Their very bricks and mortar might, if he let
  them, become part of his inmost soul. He would walk amongst them secretly and
  knowingly, familiar with every step and curve of their corridors, growing
  each day more intimate with them until one day, might be, he should be a part
  of them as darkly and mysteriously as Ervine had become a part of his study.
  Would he? He shrank instinctively from such a final absorption of himself.
  And yet already he was conscious of fascination, of something that would
  permeate his life subtly and tremendously&mdash;that must do so, whether he
  willed it or not. And as he leaned his head out of the window he felt big
  cold drops of rain.</p>

  <p>He shut the windows and resumed unpacking. Just as he had finished
  everything except the hanging up of some of the pictures, he heard the school
  clock chime the hour of four. He recollected that the porter had told him
  that tea could be obtained in the Masters' Common-Room at that hour. It was
  raining heavily now, so that a walk into the town, even with the lure of old
  Roman earthworks, was unattractive. Besides, he felt just pleasantly hungry.
  He washed his hands and descended the four long flights to the ground-floor
  corridors.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">The Masters' Common-Room was empty save for a diminutive man
  reading the <i>Farmer and Stockbreeder</i>. As Speed entered the little man
  turned round in his chair and looked at him. Speed smiled and said, still
  with a trace of that almost boisterous nervousness: "I hope I'm not
  intruding."</p>

  <p>The little man replied: "Oh, not at all. Come and sit down. Are you having
  tea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps we can have it together. You're Speed, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Thought so. I'm Pritchard. Science and maths."</p>

  <p>He said that with the air of making a vivid epigram. He had small, rather
  feminine features, and a complexion clear as a woman's. Moreover he nipped
  out his words, as it were, with a delicacy that was almost wholly feminine,
  and that blended curiously with his far-reaching contralto voice.</p>

  <p>He pressed a bell by the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"That'll fetch Potter," he said. "Potter's the Head's man, but the Head is
  good enough to lend him to us for meals. I daresay we'll be alone. The rest
  won't come before they have to."</p>

  <p>"Why do you, then?" enquired Speed, laughing a little.</p>

  <p>"Me?&mdash;Oh, I'm the victim of the railway time-table. If I'd caught a
  later train I shouldn't have arrived here till to-morrow. I come from the
  Isle of Man. Where do you come from?"</p>

  <p>"Little place in Essex."</p>

  <p>"You're all right, then. Perhaps you'll be able to manage a week-end home
  during the term. What's the Head put you on to?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, drawing and music. And he mentioned commercial geography, but I'm not
  qualified for that."</p>

  <p>"Bless you, you don't need to be. It's only exports and imports...Potter,
  tea for two, please...And some toast...Public-school man yourself, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Here?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Where, then, if you don't object to my questions?"</p>

  <p>"Harrow."</p>

  <p>Pritchard whistled.</p>

  <p>After Potter had reappeared with the tea, he went on: "You know, Speed,
  we've had a bit of gossip here about you. Before the vac. started. Something
  that the Head's wife let out one night when Ransome&mdash;he's the classics
  Master&mdash;went there to dinner. She rather gave Ransome the impression
  that you were a bit of a millionaire."</p>

  <p>Speed coloured and said hastily: "Oh, not at all. She's quite mistaken, I
  assure you."</p>

  <p>Pritchard paused, teacup in hand. "But your father is Sir Charles Speed,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The assent was grudging and a trifle irritated. Speed helped himself to
  toast with an energy that gave emphasis to the monosyllable. After munching
  in silence for some minutes he said: "Don't forget I'm far more curious about
  Millstead than you have any right to be about me. Tell me about the
  place."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I"&mdash;his voice sank to a melodramatic
  whisper&mdash;"I positively daren't tell you anything while <i>that</i>
  fellow's about." (He jerked his head in the direction of the pantry cupboard
  inside which Potter could be heard sibilantly cleaning the knives.) "He's got
  ears that would pierce a ten-inch wall. But if you want to make a friend of
  me come up to my room to-night&mdash;I'm over the way in Milner's&mdash;and
  we'll have a pipe and a chat before bedtime."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Sorry. But I'm afraid I can't to-night. Thanks all the same,
  though. I'm dining at the Head's."</p>

  <p>Pritchard's eyes rounded, and once again he emitted a soft whistle. "Oh,
  you are, are you?" he said, curiously, and he seemed ever so slightly
  displeased. He was silent for a short time; then, toying facetiously with a
  slab of cake, he added: "Well, be sure and give Miss Ervine my love when you
  get there."</p>

  <p>"Miss Ervine?"</p>

  <p>"Herself."</p>

  <p>Speed said after a pause: "What's she like?"</p>

  <p>Again Pritchard jerked his head significantly towards the pantry cupboard.
  "Mustn't talk shop here, old man. Besides, you'll find out quite soon enough
  what she's like."</p>

  <p>He took up the <i>Farmer and Stockbreeder</i> and said, in rather a loud
  tone, as if for Potter's benefit to set a label of innocuousness upon the
  whole of their conversation: "Don't know if you're at all interested in
  farming, Speed?&mdash;I am. My brother's got a little farm down in
  Herefordshire..."</p>

  <p>They chatted about farming for some time, while Potter wandered about
  preparing the long tables for dinner. Speed was not especially interested,
  and after a while excused himself by mentioning some letters that he must
  write. He came to the conclusion that he did not want to make a friend of
  Pritchard.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">At a quarter to seven he sank into the wicker armchair in
  his room and gazed pensively at the red tissue-paper in the fire-grate. He
  had just a few minutes with nothing particular to do in them before going
  downstairs to dinner at the Head's. He was ready dressed and groomed for the
  occasion, polished up to that pitch of healthy cleanliness and sartorial
  efficiency which the undergraduate of not many weeks before had been wont to
  present at University functions of the more fashionable sort. He looked
  extraordinarily young, almost boyish, in his smartly cut lounge suit and
  patent shoes; he thought so himself as he looked in the mirror&mdash;he
  speculated a little humorously whether the head-prefect would look older or
  younger than he did. He remembered Pritchard's half-jocular reference to Miss
  Ervine; he supposed from the way Pritchard had mentioned her that she was
  some awful spectacled blue-stocking of a girl&mdash;schoolmasters' daughters
  were quite often like that. On the whole he was looking forward to seven
  o'clock, partly because he was eager to pick up more: of the threads of
  Millstead life, and partly because he enjoyed dining out.</p>

  <p>Out in the corridor and in the dormitories and down the stone steps
  various sounds told him, even though he did not know Millstead, that the term
  had at last begun. He could hear the confused murmur of boyish voices
  ascending in sudden gusts from the rooms below; every now and then footsteps
  raced past his room and were muffled by the webbing on the dormitory floor;
  he heard shouts and cries of all kinds, from shrillest treble to deepest
  bass, rising and falling ceaselessly amid the vague jangle of miscellaneous
  sound. Sometimes a particular voice or group of voices would become separate
  from the rest, and then he could pick up scraps of conversation, eager
  salutations, boisterous chaff, exchanged remarks about vacation experiences,
  all intermittent and punctuated by the noisy unpacking of suit-cases and the
  clatter of water jugs in their basins. He was so young that he could hardly
  believe that he was a Master now and not a schoolboy.</p>

  <p>The school clock commenced to chime the hour. He rose, took a last view of
  himself in the bedroom mirror, and went out into the corridor. A small boy
  carrying a large bag collided with him outside the door and apologised
  profusely. He said, with a laugh: "Oh, don't mention it."</p>

  <p>He knew that the boy would recount the incident to everybody in the
  dormitory. In fact, as he turned the corner to descend the steps he caught a
  momentary glimpse of the boy standing stock-still in the corridor gazing
  after him. He smiled as he went down.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">He went round to the front entrance of the Headmaster's
  house and rang the bell. It was a curious house, the result of repeated
  architectural patchings and additions; its ultimate incongruity had been
  softened and mellowed by ivy and creeper of various sorts, so that it bore
  the sad air of a muffled-up invalid. Potter opened the door and admitted him
  with stealthy precision. While he was standing in the hall and being relieved
  of his hat and gloves he had time to notice the Asiatic and African
  bric-a-brac which, scattered about the walls and tables, bore testimony to
  Doctor Ervine's years as a missionary in foreign fields. Then, with the same
  feline grace, Potter showed him into the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>It was a moderate-sized apartment lit by heavy old-fashioned gas
  chandeliers, whose peculiar and continuous hissing sound emphasised the
  awkwardness of any gap in the conversation. A baby-grand piano, with its
  sound-board closed and littered with music and ornaments, and various
  cabinets of china and curios, were the only large articles of furniture;
  chairs and settees were sprinkled haphazard over the central area round the
  screened fireplace. As Speed entered, with Potter opening the door for him
  and intoning sepulchrally: "Mr. Speed," an answering creak of several of the
  chairs betrayed the fact that the room was occupied.</p>

  <p>Then the Head rose out of his armchair, book of some sort in hand, and
  came forward with a large easy smile.</p>

  <p>"Um, yes&mdash;Mr. Speed&mdash;so glad&mdash;um, yes&mdash;may I introduce
  you to my wife?&mdash;Lydia, this is Mr. Speed!"</p>

  <p>At first glance Speed was struck with the magnificent appropriateness of
  the name Lydia. She was a pert little woman, obviously competent; the sort of
  woman who is always suspected of twisting her husband round her little
  finger. She was fifty if she was a day, yet she dressed with a dash of the
  young university blue-stocking; an imitation so insolent that one assumed
  either that she was younger than she looked or that some enormous brain
  development justified the eccentricity. She had rather sharp blue eyes that
  were shrewd rather than far-seeing, and her hair, energetically dyed, left
  one in doubt as to what colour nature had ever accorded it. At present it was
  a dull brown that had streaks of black and grey.</p>

  <p>She said, in voice that though sharp was not unpretty: "I'm delighted to
  meet you, Mr. Speed. You must make yourself at home here, you know."</p>

  <p>The Head murmured: "Um, yes, most certainly. At home&mdash;um, yes...Now
  let me introduce you to my daughter...Helen, this is&mdash;um&mdash;Mr.
  Speed." A girl was staring at him, and he did not then notice much more than
  the extreme size and brightness of her blue eyes; that, and some
  astonishingly vague quality that cannot be more simply described than as a
  sense of continually restrained movement, so that, looking with his mind's
  eye at everybody else in the world, he saw them suddenly grown old and
  decrepit. Her bright golden hair hung down her back in a rebellious cascade;
  that, however, gave no clue to her age. The curious serene look in her eyes
  was a woman's (her mother's, no doubt), while the pretty half-mocking curve
  of her lips was still that of a young and fantastically mischievous child. In
  reality she was twenty, though she looked both older and younger.</p>

  <p>She said, in a voice so deep and sombre that Speed recoiled suddenly as
  though faced with something uncanny: "How are you, Mr. Speed?"</p>

  <p>He bowed to her and said, gallantly: "Delighted to be in Millstead, Miss
  Ervine."</p>

  <p>The Head murmured semi-consciously: "Um, yes, delightful
  place&mdash;especially in summer weather&mdash;trees, you
  know&mdash;beautiful to sit out on the cricket ground&mdash;um, yes, very,
  very beautiful indeed..."</p>

  <p>Potter opened the door to announce that dinner was served.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">As Mrs. Ervine and the girl preceded them out of the room
  Speed heard the latter say: "Clare's not come yet, mother." Mrs. Ervine
  replied, a trifle acidly: "Well, my dear, we can't wait for her. I suppose
  she knew it was at seven..."</p>

  <p>The Head, taking Speed by the arm with an air of ponderous intimacy, was
  saying: "Don't know whether you've a good reading voice, Speed. If so, we
  must have you for the lessons in morning chapel."</p>

  <p>Speed was mumbling something appropriate and the Head was piloting him
  into the dining-room when Potter appeared again, accompanied by a dark-haired
  girl, short in stature and rather pale-complexioned. She seemed quite
  unconcerned as she caught up the tail end of the procession into the
  dining-room and remarked casually: "How are you, Doctor Ervine?&mdash;So
  sorry I'm a trifle late. Friday, you know&mdash;rather a busy day for the
  shop."</p>

  <p>The Head looked momentarily nonplussed, then smiled and said: "Oh, not at
  all...not at all...I must introduce you to our new recruit&mdash;Mr.
  Speed...This is Miss Harrington, a friend of my daughter's. She&mdash;um,
  yes, she manages&mdash;most successfully, I may
  say&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;the bookshop down in the town. Bookshop, you
  know."</p>

  <p>He said that with the air of implying: Bookshops are not ordinary
  shops.</p>

  <p>Speed bowed; the Head went on boomingly: "And she is, I think I may
  venture to say, my daughter's greatest friend. Eh?"</p>

  <p>He addressed the monosyllable to the girl with a touch of shrewdness: she
  replied quietly: "I don't know." The three words were spoken in that rare
  tone in which they simply mean nothing but literally what they say.</p>

  <p>In the dining-room they sat in the following formation: Dr. and Mrs.
  Ervine at the head and foot respectively; Helen and Clare together at one
  side and Speed opposite them at the other. The dining-room was a cold
  forlorn-looking apartment in which the dim incandescent light seemed to
  accomplish little more than to cast a dull glitter of obscurity on the
  oil-paintings that hung, ever so slightly askew, on the walls. A peculiar
  incongruity in it struck Speed at once, though the same might never have
  occurred to anybody else: the minute salt and pepper-boxes on the table
  possessed a pretty feminine daintiness which harmonised ill with the huge
  mahogany sideboard. The latter reminded Speed of the boardroom of a City
  banking-house. It was as if, he thought, the Doctor and his wife had
  impressed their personalities crudely and without compromise; and as if those
  personalities were so diametrically different that no fusing of the two into
  one was ever possible. Throughout the meal he kept looking first to his left,
  at Mrs. Ervine, and then to his right at the Doctor, and wondering at what he
  felt instinctively to be a fundamental strangeness in their life
  together.</p>

  <p>Potter, assisted by a speckle-faced maid, hovered assiduously around, and
  the Doctor assisted occasionally by his wife, hovered no less assiduously
  around the conversation, preventing it from lapsing into such awkward
  silences as would throw into prominence the continual hissing of the gas and
  his own sibilant ingurgitation of soup. The Doctor talked rather loudly and
  ponderously, and with such careful and scrupulous qualifications of
  everything he said that one had the impressive sensation that incalculable
  and mysterious issues hung upon his words; Mrs. Ervine's remarks were short
  and pithy, sometimes a little cynical.</p>

  <p>The Doctor seemed to fear that he had given Speed a wrong impression of
  Miss Harrington. "I'm sure Mr. Speed will be surprised when I tell him that
  he can have the honour of purchasing his <i>Times</i> from you each morning,
  Clare," he said, lapping up the final spoonful of soup and bestowing a
  satisfied wipe with his napkin on his broad wet lips.</p>

  <p>Clare said: "I should think Mr. Speed would prefer to have it
  delivered."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ervine said: "Perhaps Mr. Speed doesn't take the <i>Times</i>,
  either."</p>

  <p>Speed looked across to Clare with a humorous twist of the corners of the
  mouth and said: "You can book me an order for the <i>Telegraph</i> if you
  like, Miss Harrington."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure, Mr. Speed. Any Sunday paper?"</p>

  <p>"The <i>Observer</i>, if you will be so kind."</p>

  <p>"Right."</p>

  <p>Again the Doctor seemed to fear that he had given Speed a wrong impression
  of Miss Harrington. "I'm sure Mr. Speed will be interested to know that your
  father is a great littérateur, Clare."</p>

  <p>Clare gave the Doctor a curious look, with one corner of her upper lip
  tilted at an audacious upward angle.</p>

  <p>The Doctor went on, leaning his elbows on the table as soon as Potter had
  removed his soup-plate: "Mr. Harrington is the author of books on
  ethics."</p>

  <p>All this time Helen had not spoken a word. Speed had been watching her,
  for she was already to him by far the most interesting member of the party.
  He noticed that her eyes were constantly shifting between Clare and anyone
  whom Clare was addressing; Clare seemed almost the centre of her world. When
  Clare smiled she smiled also, and when Clare was pensive there came into her
  eyes a look which held, besides pensiveness, a touch of sadness. She was an
  extremely beautiful girl and in the yellow light the coils of her hair shone
  like sheaves of golden corn on a summer's day. It was obvious that,
  conversationally at any rate, she was extremely shy.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ervine was saying: "You're going to take the music, Mr. Speed, are
  you not?"</p>

  <p>Speed smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>She went on: "Then I suppose you're fond of music."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it follow?" Speed answered, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>She replied pertly: "Not necessarily at all, Mr. Speed. Do you play an
  instrument?"</p>

  <p>"The piano a little."</p>

  <p>The Head interposed with: "Um, yes&mdash;a wonderful instrument. We must
  have some music after dinner, eh, Lydia?&mdash;Do you like Mendelssohn?" (He
  gave the word an exaggeratedly German pronunciation.) "My daughter plays some
  of the&mdash;um&mdash;the <i>Lieder ohne Wörte</i>&mdash;um, yes&mdash;the
  Songs Without Words, you know."</p>

  <p>"I like <i>some</i> of Mendelssohn," said Speed.</p>

  <p>He looked across at the girl. She was blushing furiously, with her eyes
  still furtively on Clare.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">After dinner they all returned to the drawing-room, where
  inferior coffee was distributed round in absurdly diminutive cups, Potter
  attitudinising over it like a high priest performing the rites of some
  sinister religious ceremony. Clare and Helen sat together on one of the
  settees, discoursing inaudibly and apparently in private; the Head commenced
  an anecdote that was suggested by Speed's glance at a photograph on the
  mantelpiece, a photograph of a coloured man attired in loose-fitting cotton
  draperies. "My servant when I was in India," the Head had informed Speed. "An
  excellent fellow&mdash;most&mdash;um, yes&mdash;faithful and reliable. One of
  the earliest of my converts. I well remember the first morning after I had
  engaged him to look after me he woke me up with the words Chota Hazra,
  sahib&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Speed feigning interest, managed to keep his eyes intermittently on the
  two girls. He wondered if they were discussing him.</p>

  <p>"I said&mdash;'I can't&mdash;um&mdash;see Mr. Chota Hazra this time in the
  morning."'</p>

  <p>Speed nodded with a show of intelligence, and then, to be on the safe side
  if the joke had been reached, gave a slight titter.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the Head, after a pause, "it was all my imperfect
  knowledge of Hindostanee. Chota hazra' means&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;breakfast!"</p>

  <p>Speed laughed loudly. He had the feeling after he had laughed that he had
  laughed too loudly, for everything seemed so achingly silent after the echoes
  had died away, silent except for the eternal hiss of the gas in the
  chandeliers. It was as if his laughter had startled something; he could hear,
  in his imagination, the faint fluttering of wings as if something had flown
  away. A curious buzzing came into his head; he thought perhaps it might be
  due to the mediocre Burgundy that he had drunk with his dinner. Then for one
  strange unforgettable second he saw Helen's sky-blue eyes focussed full upon
  him and it was in them that he read a look of half-frightened wonderment that
  sent the blood tingling in his veins.</p>

  <p>He said, with a supreme inward feeling of recklessness: "I would love to
  hear Miss Ervine play Mendelssohn."</p>

  <p>He half expected a dreadful silence to supervene and everybody to stare at
  him as the author of some frightful conversational <i>faux pas</i>; he had
  the feeling of having done something deliberately and provocatively
  unconventional. He saw the girl's eyes glance away from him and the blush
  rekindle her cheeks in an instant. It seemed to him also that she clung
  closer to Clare and that Clare smiled a little, as a mother to a shy
  child.</p>

  <p>Of course it was all a part of his acute sensitiveness; his remark was
  taken to be more than a touch of polite gallantry. Mrs. Ervine said: "Helen's
  very nervous," and the Head, rolling his head from side to side in an ecstasy
  of anticipation, said: "Ah yes, most certainly. Delightful that will
  be&mdash;um, yes&mdash;most delightful. Helen, you must not disappoint Mr.
  Speed on his first night at Millstead."</p>

  <p>She looked up, shook her head so that for an instant all her face seemed
  to be wrapped in yellow flame, and said, sombrely: "I cant play&mdash;please
  don't ask me to."</p>

  <p>Then she turned to Clare and said, suddenly: "I can't really, can. I,
  Clare?"</p>

  <p>"You can," said Clare, "but you get nervous."</p>

  <p>She said that calmly and deliberatively, with the air of issuing a final
  judgment of the matter.</p>

  <p>"Come now, Helen," boomed the Head, ponderously. "Mr.
  Speed&mdash;um&mdash;is very anxious to hear yon. It is very&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;silly to be nervous. Come along now."</p>

  <p>There was a note in those last three words of sudden harshness, a faint
  note, it is true, but one that Speed, acutely perceptive of such subtleties,
  was quick to hear and notice. He looked at the Head and once again, it seemed
  to him, the Head was as he had seen him that afternoon in the dark study, a
  flash of malevolent sharpness in his eyes, a menacing slope in his huge
  low-hanging nose. The room seemed to grow darker and the atmosphere more
  tense; he saw the girl leave the settee and walk to the piano. She sat on the
  stool for a moment with her hands poised hesitatingly over the keyboard;
  then, suddenly, and at a furious rate, she plunged into the opening bars of
  the Spring Song. Speed had never heard it played at such an alarming rate.
  Five or six bars from the beginning she stopped all at once, lingered a
  moment with her hands over the keys, and then left the stool and almost ran
  the intervening yards to the settee. She said, with deep passion: "I
  can't&mdash;I don't remember it."</p>

  <p>Clare said protectingly: "Never mind, Helen. It doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "No, of course not. It's awfully hard to remember
  music&mdash;at least, I always find it so."</p>

  <p>And the Head, all his harshness gone and placidity restored in its place,
  murmured: "Hard&mdash;um yes&mdash;very hard. I don't know how people manage
  it at all. Oh, <i>very</i> difficult, don't you think so, Lydia?"</p>

  <p>"Difficult if you're nervous," replied Mrs. Ervine, with her own peculiar
  note of acidity.</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">Conversation ambled on, drearily and with infinite labour,
  until half-past nine, when Clare arose and said she must go. Helen then rose
  also and said she would go with Clare a part of the way into the town, but
  Mrs. Ervine objected because Helen had a cold. Clare said: "Oh, don't
  trouble, Helen, I can easily go alone&mdash;I'm used to it, you know, and
  there's a bright moon."</p>

  <p>Speed, feeling that a show of gallantry would bring to an end an evening
  that had just begun to get on his nerves a little, said: "Suppose I see you
  home, Miss Harrington. I've got to go down to the general post office to post
  a letter, and I can quite easily accompany you as far as the High
  Street."</p>

  <p>"There's no need to," said Clare. "And I hope you're not inventing that
  letter you have to post."</p>

  <p>"I assure you I'm not," Speed answered, and he pulled out of his pocket a
  letter home that he had written up in his room that afternoon.</p>

  <p>Clare laughed.</p>

  <p>In the dimly-lit hall, after he had bidden good night to Doctor and Mrs.
  Ervine, he found an opportunity of speaking a few words to Helen alone. She
  was waiting at the door to have a few final words with Clare, and before
  Clare appeared Speed came up to her and began speaking.</p>

  <p>He said: "Miss Ervine, please forgive me for having been the means of
  making you feel uncomfortable this evening. I had no idea you were nervous,
  or I shouldn't have dreamed of asking you to play. I know what nervousness
  is, because I'm nervous myself."</p>

  <p>She gave him a half-frightened look and replied: "Oh, it's all right, Mr.
  Speed. It wasn't your fault. And anyhow it didn't matter."</p>

  <p>She seemed only half interested. It was Clare she was waiting for, and
  when Clare appeared she left Speed by the door and the two girls conversed a
  moment in whispers. They kissed and said good night.</p>

  <p>As Potter appeared mysteriously from nowhere and, after handing Speed his
  hat and gloves, opened the front-door with massive dignity, Helen threw her
  hands up as if to embrace the chill night air and exclaimed: "Oh, what a
  lovely moon! I wish I was coming with you, Clare!"</p>

  <p>There was a strange bewildering pathos in her voice.</p>

  <p>Over the heavy trees and the long black pillars of shadow the windows of
  the dormitories shone like yellow gems, piercing the night with radiance and
  making a pattern of intricate beauty on the path that led to the Headmaster's
  gate. Sounds, mysteriously clear, fell from everywhere upon the two of them
  as they crossed the soft lawn and came in view of the huge block of Milner's,
  all its windows lit and all its rooms alive with commotion. They could hear
  the clatter of jugs in their basins, the sudden chorus of boyish derision,
  the strident cry that pierced the night like a rocket, the dull incessant
  murmur of miscellaneous sounds, the clap of hands, the faint jabber of a
  muffled gramophone. Millstead was most impressive at this hour, for it was
  the hour when she seemed most of all immense and vital, a body palpitating
  with warmth and energy, a mighty organism which would swallow the small and
  would sway even the greatest of men. Tears, bred of a curious undercurrent of
  emotion, came into Speed's eyes as he realised that he was now part of the
  marvelously contrived machine.</p>

  <p>Out in the lane the moon was white along one side of the road-way, and
  here the lights of Millstead pierced through the foliage like so many bright
  stars. Speed walked with Clare in silence for some way. He had nothing
  particular to say; he had suggested accompanying her home partly from mere
  perfunctory politeness, but chiefly because he longed for a walk in the cool
  night air away from the stuffiness of the Head's drawing-room.</p>

  <p>When they had been walking some moments Clare said: "I wish you hadn't
  come with me, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>He answered, a trifle vacantly: "Why do you?"</p>

  <p>"Because it will make Helen jealous."</p>

  <p>He became as if suddenly galvanised into attention. "What! Jealous!
  Jealous!&mdash;Of whom?&mdash;Of what?&mdash;Of you having me to take you
  home?"</p>

  <p>Clare shook her head. "Oh, no. Of you having me to take home."</p>

  <p>He thought a moment and then said: "What, really?&mdash;Do you mean to
  tell me that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she interrupted. "And of course you don't understand it, do
  you?&mdash;Men never understand Helen."</p>

  <p>"And why don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Because Helen doesn't like men, and men can never understand that."</p>

  <p>He rejoined, heavily despondent: "Then I expect she dislikes me venomously
  enough. For it was I who asked her to play the piano, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't dislike you any more for that," replied Clare. "But let's
  not discuss her. I hate gossiping about my friends."</p>

  <p>They chattered intermittently and inconsequently about books after that,
  and at the corner of High Street she insisted on his leaving her and
  proceeding to the general post office by the shortest route.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-01-02"
     id="ch-01-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning he was awakened by Hartopp the School House
  porter ringing his noisy hand-bell through the dormitories. He looked at his
  watch; it was half-past six. There was no need for him to think of getting up
  yet; he had no early morning form, and so could laze for another hour if he
  so desired. But it was quite impossible to go to sleep again because his
  mind, once he became awake, began turning over the incidents of the day
  before and anticipating those of the day to come. He lay in bed thinking and
  excogitating, listening to the slow beginnings of commotion in the
  dormitories, and watching bars of yellow sunshine creeping up the bed towards
  his face. At half-past seven Hartopp tapped at the door and brought in his
  correspondence. There was a letter from home and a note, signed by the Head,
  giving him his work time-table. He consulted it immediately and discovered
  that he was put down for two forms that morning; four <i>alpha</i> in drawing
  and five <i>gamma</i> in general supervision.</p>

  <p>His letter from home, headed "Beachings Over, near Framlingay, Essex. Tel.
  Framlingay 32. Stations: Framlingay 2½ miles; Pumphrey Bassett 3 miles," ran
  as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">"MY DEAR KEN,&mdash;This will reach you on the first
  morning of term, won't it, and your father and I both want you to understand
  that we wish you every success. It seems a funny thing to do, teaching in a
  boarding-school, but I suppose it's all right if you like it, only of course
  we should have liked you to go into the business. I hope you can keep order
  with the boys, anyhow, they do say that poor Mr. Rideaway in the village has
  an awful time, the boys pour ink in his pockets when he isn't looking. Father
  is going on business to Australia very soon and wants me to go with him,
  perhaps I may, but it sounds an outlandish sort of place to go to, doesn't
  it. Since you left us we've had to get rid of Jukes&mdash;we found him
  stealing a piece of tarpaulin&mdash;so ungrateful, isn't it, but we've got
  another under-gardener now, he used to be at Peverly Court but left because
  the old duke was so <i>mean</i>. Dick goes back to Marlborough
  to-day&mdash;they begin the same day as yours. By the way, why did you choose
  Millstead? I'd never heard of it till we looked it up, it isn't well-known
  like Harrow and Rugby, is it. We had old Bennett and Sir Guy Blatherwick with
  us the last week-end, Sir Guy told us all about his travels in China, or
  Japan, I forget which. Well, write to us, won't you, and drop in if yon get a
  day off any time&mdash;your affectionate mother, FANNY."</p>

  <p>After he had read it he washed and dressed in a leisurely fashion and
  descended in time for School breakfast at eight. Hartopp showed him his
  place, at the head of number four table, and he was interested to see by his
  plate a neatly folded <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. Businesslike, he commented
  mentally, and he was glad to see it because a newspaper is an excellent cloak
  for nervousness and embarrassment. His mother's hint about his being possibly
  a bad disciplinarian put him on his guard; he was determined to succeed in
  this immensely important respect right from the start. Of course he possessed
  the enormous advantage of knowing from recent experience the habits and
  psychology of the average public-schoolboy.</p>

  <p>But breakfast was not a very terrible ordeal. The boys nearest him
  introduced themselves and bade him a cheerful good morning, for there is a
  sense of fairness in schoolboys which makes them generous to newcomers,
  except where tradition decrees the setting-up of some definite ordeal.
  Towards the end of the meal Pritchard walked over from one of the other
  tables and enquired, in a voice loud enough for at any rate two or three of
  the boys to hear: "Well, Speed, old man, did you have a merry carousal at the
  Head's last night?"</p>

  <p>Speed replied, a little coldly: "I had a pleasant time."</p>

  <p>"I suppose now," went on Pritchard, dropping his voice a little, but still
  not sufficiently to prevent the nearest boys from hearing, "you realise what
  I meant yesterday."</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"When I said that you'd find out soon enough what she was like."</p>

  <p>Speed said crisply: "You warned me yesterday against talking shop. I might
  warn you now."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't shop."</p>

  <p>"Well, whether it is or not I don't propose to discuss
  it&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;and <i>here</i>."</p>

  <p>Almost without his being aware of it his voice had risen somewhat, so that
  at this final pronouncement the boys nearest him looked up with curiosity
  tinged with poorly-concealed amusement. It was rather obvious that Pritchard
  was unpopular.</p>

  <p>Speed was sorry that he had not exercised greater control over his voice,
  especially when Pritchard, reddening, merely shrugged his shoulders and went
  away.</p>

  <p>The boy nearest to Speed grinned and said audaciously: "That'll take Mr.
  Pritchard down a peg, sir!"</p>

  <p>Speed barked out (to the boy's bewilderment): "Don't be impertinent!"</p>

  <p>For the rest of the meal he held up the <i>Telegraph</i> as a rampart
  between himself and the world.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">He knew, at the end of the first school day, that he had
  been a success, and that if he took reasonable care he would be able to go on
  being a success. It had been a day of subtle trials and ordeals, yet he had,
  helped rather than hindered by his peculiar type of nervousness, got safely
  through them all.</p>

  <p>Numerous were the pitfalls which he had carefully avoided. At school meals
  he had courteously declined to share jam and delicacies which the nearest to
  him offered. If he had he would have been inundated immediately with pots of
  jam and boxes of fancy cakes from all quarters of the table. Many a new
  Master at Millstead had finished his first meal with his part of the table
  looking like the counter of an untidy grocer's shop. Instinct rather than
  prevision had saved Speed from such a fate. Instinct, in fact, had been his
  guardian angel throughout the day; instinct which, although to some extent
  born of his recent public-school experience, was perhaps equally due to that
  curious barometric sensitiveness that made his feelings so much more acute
  and clairvoyant than those of other people.</p>

  <p>At dinner in the Masters' Common-Room he had met the majority of the
  staff. There was Garforth, the bursar, a pleasant little man with a
  loving-kindness overclouded somewhat by pedantry; Hayes-Smith, housemaster of
  Mllner's, a brisk, bustling, unimaginative fellow whose laugh was more
  eloquent than his words; Ransome, a wizened Voltairish classical master,
  morbidly ashamed of being caught in possession of any emotion of any kind;
  Lavery, housemaster of North House (commonly called Lavery's), whose
  extraordinary talent for delegating authority enabled him to combine laziness
  and efficiency in a way both marvellous and enviable; and Poulet, the French
  and German Master, who spoke far better English than anybody in the
  Common-Room, except, perhaps, Garforth or Ransome. Then, of course, there was
  Clanwell, whom Speed had already met; Clanwell, better known "Fish-cake," a
  sporting man of great vigour who would, from time to time, astonish the world
  by donning a black suit and preaching from the Millstead pulpit a sermon of
  babbling meekness. Speed liked him; liked all of them, in fact, better than
  he did Pritchard.</p>

  <p>At dinner, Pritchard sat next to him on one side and Clanwell on the
  other. Pritchard showed no malice for the incident of that morning's
  breakfast-time, and Speed, a little contrite, was affable enough. But for all
  that he did not like Pritchard.</p>

  <p>Pritchard asked him if he had got on all right that day, and Speed replied
  that he had. Then Pritchard said: "Oh, well of course, the first day's always
  easy. It's after a week or so that you'll find things a bit trying. The first
  night you take prep, for instance. It's a sort of school tradition that they
  always try and rag you that night."</p>

  <p>Clanwell, overhearing, remarked fiercely: "Anyway, Speed, take my tip and
  don't imagine it's a school tradition that any Master lets himself be
  ragged."</p>

  <p>Speed laughed. "I'll remember that," he said.</p>

  <p>He remembered it on the following Wednesday night when he was down to take
  evening preparation from seven until half-past eight. Preparation for the
  whole school, except prefects, was held in Millstead Big Hall, a huge
  vault-like chamber in which desks were ranged in long rows and where the
  Master in charge sat on high at a desk on a raised dais. No more subtle and
  searching test of disciplinary powers could have been contrived than this
  supervision of evening preparation, for the room was so big that it was
  impossible to see clearly from the Master's desk to the far end, and besides
  that, the acoustics were so peculiar that conversations in some parts of the
  room were practically inaudible except from very close quarters. A new Master
  suffered additional handicap in being ignorant of the names of the vast
  majority of the boys.</p>

  <p>At dinner, before the ordeal, the Masters in the Common-Room had given
  Speed jocular advice. "Whatever you do, watch that they don't get near the
  electric-light switches," said Clanwell. Pritchard said: "When old Blenkinsop
  took his first prep they switched off the lights and then took his trousers
  off and poured ink over his legs." Garforth said: "Whatever you do, don't
  lose your temper and hit anybody. It doesn't pay."</p>

  <p>"Best to walk up and down the rows if you want them to stop talking," said
  Ransome. Pritchard said: "If you do that they'll beat time to your steps with
  their feet." Poulet remarked reminiscently: "When I took my first prep they
  started a gramophone somewhere, and I guessed they'd hidden it well, so I
  said: 'Gentlemen, anyone who interrupts the music will have a hundred lines!'
  They laughed and were quite peaceable afterwards."</p>

  <p>Speed said, at the conclusion of the meal: "I'm much obliged to everybody
  for the advice. I'll try to remember all of it, but I guess when I'm in there
  I shall just do whatever occurs to me at the moment." To which Clanwell
  replied, putting a hand on Speed's shoulder: "You couldn't do better, my
  lad."</p>

  <p>Speed was very nervous as he took his seat on the dais at five to seven
  and watched the school straggling to their places. They came in quietly
  enough, but there was an atmosphere of subdued expectancy of which Speed was
  keenly conscious; the boys stared about them, grinned at each other, seemed
  as if they were waiting for something to happen. Nevertheless, at five past
  seven all was perfectly quiet and orderly, although it was obvious that
  little work was being done. Speed felt rather as if he were sitting on a
  powder-magazine, and there was a sense in which he was eager for the storm to
  break.</p>

  <p>At about a quarter-past seven a banging of desk-lids began at the far end
  of the hall.</p>

  <p>He stood up and said, quietly, but in a voice that carried well: "I don't
  want to be hard on anybody, so I'd better warn you that I shall punish any
  disorderliness very severely."</p>

  <p>There was some tittering, and for a moment or so he wondered if he had
  made a fool of himself.</p>

  <p>Then he saw a bright, rather pleasant-faced boy in one of the back rows
  deliberately raise a desk-lid and drop it with a bang. Speed consulted the
  map of the desks that was in front of him and by counting down the rows
  discovered the boy's name to be Worsley. He wondered how the name should be
  pronounced&mdash;whether the first syllable should rhyme with "purse" or with
  "horse." Instinct in him, that uncanny feeling for atmosphere, embarked him
  on an outrageously bold adventure, nothing less than a piece of
  facetiousness, the most dangerous weapon in a new Master's armoury, and the
  one most of all likely to recoil on himself. He stood up again and said:
  "Wawsley or Wurssley&mdash;however you call yourself&mdash;you have a hundred
  lines!"</p>

  <p>The whole assembly roared with laughter. That frightened him a little.
  Supposing they did not stop laughing! He remembered an occasion at his own
  school when a class had ragged a certain Master very neatly and subtly by
  pretending to go off into hysterics of laughter at some trifling witticism of
  his.</p>

  <p>When the laughter subsided, a lean, rather clever-looking boy rose up in
  the front row but one and said, impudently: "Please, sir, I'm Worsley. I
  didn't do anything."</p>

  <p>Speed replied promptly: "Oh, didn't you? Well, you've got a hundred lines,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"What for, sir?"&mdash;in hot indignation.</p>

  <p>"For sitting in your wrong desk."</p>

  <p>Again the assembly laughed, but there was no mistaking the respectfulness
  that underlay the merriment. And, as a matter of fact, the rest of the
  evening passed entirely without incident. After the others had gone, and when
  the school-bell had rung for evening chapel, Worsley came up to the dais
  accompanied by the pleasant-faced boy who dropped the desk-lid. Worsley
  pleaded for the remission of his hundred lines, and the other boy supported
  him, urging that it was he and not Worsley who had dropped the lid.</p>

  <p>"And what is your name?" asked Speed.</p>

  <p>"Naylor, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Naylor, you and Worsley can share the hundred lines between
  you." He added smiling "I've no doubt you're neither of you worse than
  anybody else but you must pay the penalty of being, pioneers."</p>

  <p>They went away laughing.</p>

  <p>That night Speed went into Clanwell's room for a chat before bedtime, and
  Clanwell congratulated him fulsomely on his successful passage of the ordeal.
  "As, a matter of fact," Clanwell said, "I happen to know that they'd prepared
  a star benefit performance for you but that you put them off, somehow, from
  the beginning. The prefects get to hear of these things and they tell me.. Of
  course, I don't take any official notice of them. It doesn't matter to me
  what plans people make&mdash;it's when any are put into execution that I wake
  up. Anyhow, you may be interested to know that the members of School House
  subscribed over fifteen shillings to purchase fireworks which they were going
  to let off after the switches had been turned off! Alas for fond hopes
  ruined!"</p>

  <p>Clanwell and Speed leaned back in their armchairs and roared with
  laughter.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">At the end of the first week of life at Millstead, Speed was
  perfectly happy. He seemed to have surmounted easily all the difficulties
  that had confronted or that could confront him, and now there stretched away
  into the future an endless succession of glorious days spent tirelessly in
  the work that he loved. For he loved teaching. He loved boys. When he got
  over his preliminary, and in some ways rather helpful nervousness he was
  thoroughly at home with all of them. He invited those in his house to tea,
  two or three at a time, almost every afternoon. He took a deep and individual
  interest in all who showed distinct artistic or musical abilities. He plunged
  adventurously into the revolutionising of the School's arts curriculum; he
  dreamed of organising an exhibition of art work in time for Speech Day, of
  reviving the moribund School musical society, of getting up concerts of
  chamber music, of entering the School choir for musical festivals. All the
  hot enthusiasm of youth he poured ungrudgingly into the service of Millstead,
  and Millstead rewarded him by liking him tremendously. The boys liked him
  because he was young and agreeable, yet not condescendingly so; besides, he
  could play a game of cricket that was so good-naturedly mediocre that nobody,
  after witnessing it, could doubt that he was a fellow of like capabilities
  with the rest. The Masters liked him because he was energetic and efficient
  and did not ally himself with any particular set or clique among them.</p>

  <p>Clanwell said to him one evening: "I hope you won't leave at the end of
  the term, Speed."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Why on earth should I?"</p>

  <p>"We sometimes find that people who're either very good or very bad do so.
  And you're very good."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you think so." His face grew suddenly boyish with
  blushes.</p>

  <p>"We all think so, Speed. And the Head likes you. We hope you'll stay."</p>

  <p>"I'll stay all right. I'm too happy to want to go away."</p>

  <p>Clanwell said meditatively: "It's a fine life if you're cut out for it,
  isn't it? I sometimes think there isn't a finer life in the whole world."</p>

  <p>"I've always thought that."</p>

  <p>"I hope you always will think it."</p>

  <p>"And I hope so too."</p>

  <p>Summer weather came like a strong flood about ten days after the opening
  of term, and then Millstead showed herself to him in all her serene and
  matchless beauty. He learned to know and expect the warm sunshine waking him
  in the mornings and creeping up the bed till it dazzled his eyes; he learned
  to know and to love the <i>plick-plock</i> of the cricket that was his music
  at he sat by the open window many an afternoon at work. And at night time,
  when the flaring gas jets winked in all the tiny windows and when there came
  upwards the cheerful smell of coffee-making in the studies, it was all as if
  some subtle alchemy were at work, transforming his soul into the mould and
  form of Millstead. Something fine and mighty was in the place, and his soul,
  passionately eager to yield itself, craved for that full possession which
  Millstead brought to it. The spell was swift and glorious. Sometimes he
  thought of Millstead almost as a lover; he would stroll round at night and
  drink deep of the witchery that love put into all that lie saw and heard; the
  sounds of feet scampering along the passage outside his door, the cold lawns
  with the moon white upon them, the soft delicious flower-scents that rose up
  to his bedroom window at night. The chapel seemed to him, to put it
  epigrammatically, far more important because it belonged to Millstead than
  because it belonged to Christ. Millstead, stiff-collared and black-coated on
  a Sunday morning, and wondering what on earth it should do with itself on
  Sunday afternoon, touched him far more deeply than did the chatter of some
  smooth-voiced imported divine who knew Millstead only from spending a bored
  week-end at the Head's house. To Speed, sitting in the Masters' pew, and
  giving vent to his ever-ready imagination, Millstead seemed a personification
  of all that was youthful and clear-spirited and unwilling to pay any more
  than merely respectful attention to the exhortations of elders.</p>

  <p>He did not sentimentalise over it. He was not old enough to think
  regretfully of his own school-days. It was the present, the present leaning
  longingly in the arms of the future, that wove its subtle and gracious spell.
  He did not kindle to the trite rhapsodies of middle-aged "old boys." The
  "Thoughts of an Old Millsteadian on Revisiting the School Chapel," published
  in the school magazine, stirred him not at all. But to wander about on a dark
  night and to find his feet beautifully at ease upon curious steps and
  corridors gave him pangs of exquisite lover-like intimacy; he was a "new
  boy," eager for the future, not an "old boy" sighing for the past.</p>

  <p>And all this was accomplished so swiftly and effortlessly, within a few
  weeks of his beginning at the school it was as if Millstead had filled a void
  in his soul that had been gaping for it.</p>

  <p>Only one spot in the whole place gave him a feeling of discomfort, and
  that was the Headmaster's study. The feeling of apprehension, of sinister
  attraction, that had come upon him when first he had entered it, lessened as
  time and custom wore it away; yet still, secretly and in shadow, it was
  there. All the sadness and pathos of a world seemed to be congregated in the
  dark study, and to come out of it into the sunlit corridors of the school was
  like the swift passing from the minor into the major key.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">On Fridays he had an early morning form before breakfast and
  then was completely free until four o'clock in the afternoon, so that if the
  weather were sufficiently enticing he could fill the basket on his bicycle
  'with books and go cycling along the sweet-smelling sunlit lanes. Millstead
  was just on the edge of the fen district; in one direction the flat lands
  stretched illimitably to a horizon unbroken as the sea's edge; a stern and
  lonely country, with nothing to catch the eye save here and there the glint
  of dyke-water amongst tall reeds and afar off some desert church-tower stiff
  and stark as the mast of a ship on an empty sea. Speed did not agree with the
  general Common-Room consensus of opinion that the scenery round Millstead was
  tame and unattractive; secretly to him the whole district was rich with wild
  and passionate beauty, and sometimes on these delectable Fridays he would
  cycle for miles along the flat fen roads with the wind behind him, and return
  in the afternoon by crawling romantic-looking branch-line trains which always
  managed to remind him of wild animals, so completely had the civilised thing
  been submerged in the atmosphere of what it had sought to civilise.</p>

  <p>But that was only on one side of Millstead. On the other side, and beyond
  the rook-infested trees that were as ramparts to the south-west wind, the
  lanes curved into the folds of tiny hills and lifted themselves for a space
  on to the ridge of glossy heaths and took sudden twists into the secrecies of
  red-roofed tree-hidden hamlets. And amidst this country, winding its delicate
  way beneath arches of overhanging greenery, ran the river Wade.</p>

  <p>One Friday morning Speed cycled out to Parminters, a village about three
  miles out of Millstead. Here there was a low hill (not more than a couple of
  hundred feet), carpeted with springy turf and overlooking innumerable coils
  of the glistening stream. At midday on a May morning there was something
  indescribably restful, drowsy almost, in the scene; the hill dropped by a
  sudden series of grassy terraces into the meadows, and there was quite a
  quarter of a mile of lush grass land between the foot of the slope and the
  river bank. It was an entrancing spectacle, one to watch rather than to see;
  the silken droop of the meadows, the waves of alternate shadow and sunlight
  passing over the long grasses, the dark patches on the landscape which
  drifted eastwards with the clouds. The sun, when it pierced their white edges
  and came sailing into the blue, was full of warmth and beauty, warmth that
  awakened myriads of insects to a drowsy buzzing contentment and beauty that
  lay like a soft veil spread across the world. Speed, with a bundle of four
  <i>alpha</i> geography essays in his pocket (he had, after all, decided that
  he was competent to teach commercial geography to the lower forms), lay down
  amongst the deep grass and lit a pipe.</p>

  <p>He marked a few of the essays and then, smoking comfortably, settled to a
  contented gaze across the valley. It was then, not until he had been there
  some while, though, that he saw amidst the tall grasses of the meadows a
  splash of blue in the midst of the deep green. It is strange that at first he
  did not recognise her. He saw only a girl in a pale-blue dress stooping to
  pick grasses. She was hatless and golden-haired, and in one hand she bore a
  bunch of something purple, some kind of long grass whose name he did not
  know. He watched her at first exactly as he might have watched some perfect
  theatrical spectacle, with just that kind of detached admiration and rich
  impersonal enchantment. The pose of her as she stooped, the flaunt of the
  grasses in her hand, the movement of her head as she tossed back her laughing
  hair, the winding yellow path she trampled across the meadows: all these
  things he watched and strangely admired.</p>

  <p>He lay watching for a long while, still without guessing who she was, till
  the sun went in behind a cloud and he felt drowsy. He closed his eyes and
  leaned back cushioned amongst the turf.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">He woke with a sensation of intense chilliness; the sun had
  gone in and even its approximate position in the sky could not be determined
  because of the heaviness of the clouds. He looked at his watch; it was ten
  minutes past one; he must have slept for over an hour.</p>

  <p>The sky was almost the most sinister thing he ever saw. In the east a
  faint deathly pallor hung over the horizon, but the piling clouds from the
  west were pushing it over the edge of the world. That faint pallor dissolved
  across the sky into the greyness deepening into a western horizon of pitch
  black. Here and there this was shot through with streaks of dull and sombre
  flame as if each of the hills in that dark land was a sulky volcano. It was
  cold, and yet the wind that blew in from the gloom was strangely oppressive;
  the grasses bent low as if weighed down by its passing. Deep in the cleft by
  Parminters the river gleamed like a writhing venomous snake, the sky giving
  it the dull shimmer of pewter. To descend across those dark meadows to the
  coils of the stream seemed somehow an adventure of curious and inscrutable
  horror. Speed stood up and looked far into the valley. The whole scene seemed
  to him unnatural; the darkness was weird and baffling; the clouds were the
  grim harbingers of a thunderstorm. And to him there seemed momentarily a
  strangeness in the aspect of everything; something deep and fearsome,
  imminent, perhaps, with tragedy. He felt within him a sombre presaging
  excitement.</p>

  <p>It began to rain, quietly at first, then faster, faster, and at last
  overwhelmingly. He had brought no mackintosh. He stuffed the essays into his
  coat pocket, swung his bicycle off the turf where he had laid it, and began
  to run down the hill with it. His aim was to get to the village and shelter
  somewhere till the storm was over. Halfway down he paused to put up his
  coat-collar, and there, looking across the meadows, he saw again that girl in
  the pale-blue dress. He was nearer to her now and recognised her immediately.
  She was dressed in a loose-fitting and rather dilapidated frock which the
  downpour of rain had already made to cling to the soft curves of her body;
  round her throat, tightly twined, was a. striped scarf which Speed, quick to
  like or to dislike what he saw, decided was absolutely and garishly ugly. And
  yet immediately he felt a swift tightening of his affection for her, for
  Millstead was like that, full of stark uglinesses that were beautiful by
  their intimacy...She saw him and stopped. Details of her at that moment
  encumbered his memory ever afterwards. She was about twenty yards from him
  and he could see a most tremendous wrist-watch that she wore&mdash;an
  ordinary pocket watch clamped on to a strap. And from the outside pocket of
  her dress there protruded the chromatic cover of a threepenny novelette. (Had
  she read it? Was she going to read it? Did she like it? he wondered swiftly.)
  She still carried that bunch of grasses, now rather soiled and bedraggled,
  tightly in her hand. He imagined, in the curiously vivid way that was so easy
  to him, the damp feel of her palm; the heat and perspiration of it: somehow
  this again, a symbol of secret and bodily intimacy, renewed in him that
  sudden kindling affection for her.</p>

  <p>He called out to her: "Miss Ervine!"</p>

  <p>She answered, a little shyly: "Oh, how are you, Mr. Speed?"</p>

  <p>"Rather wet just at present," he replied, striding over the tufts of thick
  grass towards her. "And you appear to be even wetter than I am. I'm afraid
  we're in for a severe thunderstorm."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, I don't mind thunderstorms."</p>

  <p>"You ought to mind getting wet." He paused, uncertain what to say next.
  Then instinct made him suddenly begin to talk to her as he might have done to
  a small child. "My dear young lady, you don't suppose I'm going to leave you
  here to get drenched to the skin, do you?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and said: "I don't know what you're going to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Have you had anything to eat?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want anything."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suggest that we get into the village as quick as we can and stay
  there till the rain stops. I was also going to suggest that we spent the time
  in having lunch, but as you don't want anything, we needn't."</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to wait in the village, Mr. Speed. I was just going to
  start for home when it came on to rain."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Very well, if you want to get home you must let me take you.
  You're not going to walk home through a thunderstorm. We'll have a cab or
  something."</p>

  <p>"And do you really think you'll get a cab in Par-minters?"</p>

  <p>He answered: "I always have a good try to get anything I want to."</p>

  <p>For all her protests she came with him down the meadow and out into the
  sodden lane. As they passed the gate the first flash of lightning lit up the
  sky, followed five seconds after by a crash of thunder.</p>

  <p>"There!" he exclaimed triumphantly, as if the thunder and lightning
  somehow strengthened his position with her: "You wouldn't like to walk to
  Millstead through that, would you?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and looked at him as if she hated his
  interference yet found it irresistible.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">It was altogether by good luck that he did get a cab in the
  village; a Millstead cab had brought some people into Parminters and was just
  setting back empty on the return journey when Speed met it in the narrow
  lane. Once again, this time as he opened the cab-door and handed her inside,
  he gave her that look of triumph, though he was well aware of the luck that
  he had had. Inside on the black leather cushions he placed in a conspicuously
  'central position his hat and his bundle of essays, and, himself occupying
  one corner, invited her to take the other. All the time the driver was
  bustling round lifting the bicycle on to the roof and tying it securely down,
  Speed sat in his corner, damp to the skin, watching her and remembering that
  Miss Harrington had told him that she hated men. All the way during that
  three-mile ride back to Millstead, with the swishing of the rain and the
  occasional thunder and the steady jog-trot of the horse's hoofs mingling
  together in a memorable medley of sound, Speed sat snugly in his corner,
  watching and wondering.</p>

  <p>Not much conversation passed between them. When they were nearing
  Millstead, Speed said: "The other day as I passed near your drawing-room
  window I heard somebody playing the Chopin waltzes. Was it you?"</p>

  <p>"It might have been."</p>

  <p>He continued after a pause: "I see there's a Chopin recital advertised in
  the town for next Monday week. Zobieski, the Polish pianist, is coming up.
  Would you care to come with me to it?"</p>

  <p>It was very daring of him to say that, and he knew it. She coloured to the
  roots of her wet-gold hair, and replied, after a silence: "Monday, though,
  isn't it?&mdash;I'm afraid I couldn't manage it. I always see Clare on
  Mondays."</p>

  <p>He answered instantly: "Bring Clare as well then."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't think Clare would be interested," she replied, a little
  confused. She added, as if trying to make up for having rejected his offer
  rather rudely: "Clare and I don't get many chances of seeing each other. Only
  Mondays and Wednesday afternoons."</p>

  <p>"But I see you with her almost every day."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but only for a few minutes. Mondays are the only evenings that we
  have wholly to ourselves."</p>

  <p>He thought, but did not dare to say: And is it absolutely necessary that
  you must have those evenings wholly to yourselves?</p>

  <p>He said thoughtfully: "I see."</p>

  <p>He said nothing further until the cab drew up outside the main gate of
  Millstead School. He was going to tell the driver to proceed inside as far as
  the porch of the Head's house, but she said she would prefer to get out there
  and walk across the lawns. He smiled and helped her out. As he looked inside
  the cab again to see if he had left any papers behind he saw that the
  gaudily-coloured novelette had fallen out of her pocket and on to the floor.
  He picked it up and handed it to her. "You dropped this," he said merely. She
  stared at him for several seconds and then took it almost sulkily.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I can read what I like, anyway," she exclaimed, in a sudden hot
  torrent of indignation.</p>

  <p>He smiled, completely astonished, yet managed to say, blandly: "I'm sure I
  never dreamt of suggesting otherwise."</p>

  <p>He could see then from her eyes, half-filling with tears of humiliation,
  that she realised that she had needlessly made a fool of herself.</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;please&mdash;don't come with me any further," she said,
  awkwardly. "And thanks&mdash;thanks&mdash;very much&mdash;for&mdash;for
  bringing me back."</p>

  <p>He smiled again and raised his hat as she darted away across the wet
  lawns. Then; after paying the driver, he walked straightway into the school
  and down into the prefects' bathroom, where he turned on the scalding hot
  water with jubilant anticipation.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">The immediate result of the incident was an invitation to
  dine at the Head's a few days later. "It was very&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;thoughtful and considerate of you, Mr. Speed," said the Head,
  mumblingly. "My daughter&mdash;a heedless child&mdash;just like her to omit
  the&mdash;um&mdash;precaution of taking some&mdash;um, yes&mdash;protection
  against any possible change in the weather."</p>

  <p>"I was rather in the same boat myself, sir," said Speed, laughing. "The
  thunderstorm was quite unexpected."</p>

  <p>"Um yes, quite so. <i>Quite</i> so." The Head paused and added, with
  apparent inconsequence: "My daughter is quite a child, Mr. Speed&mdash;loves
  to gather flowers&mdash;um&mdash;botany, you know, and&mdash;um&mdash;so
  forth."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Yes, I have noticed it."</p>

  <p>Dinner at the Head's house was less formal than on the previous occasion.
  It was a Monday evening and Clare Harrington was there. Afterwards in the
  drawing-room Speed played a few Chopin studies and Mazurkas. He did not
  attempt to get into separate conversation with Miss Ervine; he chatted
  amiably with the Head while the two girls gossiped by themselves. And at ten
  o'clock, pleading work to do before bed, he arose to go, leaving the girls to
  make their own arrangements. Miss Ervine said good-bye to him with a shyness
  in which he thought he detected a touch of wistfulness.</p>

  <p>When he got up to his own room he thought about her for a long while. He
  tried to settle down to an hour or so of marking books, but found it
  impossible. In the end he went downstairs and let himself outside into the
  school grounds by his own private key. It was a glorious night of starshine,
  and all the roofs were pale with the brightness of it. Wafts of perfume from
  the flowers and shrubbery of the Head's garden accosted him gently as he
  turned the corner by the chapel and into the winding tree-hidden path that
  circumvented the entire grounds of Millstead. It was on such a night that his
  heart's core was always touched; for it seemed to him that then the strange
  spirit of the place was most alive, and that it came everywhere to meet him
  with open arms, drenching all his life in wild and unspeakable loveliness.
  Oh, how happy he was, and how hard it was to make others realise his
  happiness! In the Common-Room his happiness had become proverbial, and even
  amongst the boys, always quicker to notice unhappy than happy looks, his
  beaming smile and firm, kindling enthusiasm had earned him the nickname of
  "Smiler."</p>

  <p>He sat down for a moment on the lowest tier of the pavilion seats, those
  seats where generations of Millsteadians had hurriedly prepared themselves
  for the fray of school and house matches. Now the spot was splendidly silent,
  with the cricket-pitch looming away mistily in front, and far behind, over
  the tips of the high trees, the winking lights of the still noisy
  dormitories. He watched a bat flitting haphazardly about the pillars of the
  pavilion stand. He could see, very faintly in the paleness, the score of that
  afternoon's match displayed on the indicator. Old Millstead parish bells, far
  away in the town, commenced the chiming of eleven.</p>

  <p>He felt then, as he had never felt before he came to Millstead, that the
  world was full, brimming full, of wonderful majestic beauty, and that now, as
  the scented air swirled round him in slow magnificent eddies, it was
  searching for something, searching with passionate and infinite desire for
  something that eluded it always. He could not understand or analyse all that
  he felt, but sometimes lately a deep shaft of ultimate feeling would seem to
  grip him round the body and send the tears swimming into his eyes, as if for
  one glorious moment he had seen and heard something of another world. It came
  suddenly to him now, as he sat on the pavilion seats with the silver
  starshine above him and the air full of the smells of earth and flowers; it
  seemed to him that something mighty must be abroad in the world, that all
  this tremulous loveliness could not live without a meaning, that he was on
  the verge of some strange and magic revelation.</p>

  <p>Clear as bells on the silent air came the sound of girls' voices. He heard
  a rich, tolling "Good night, Clare!" Then silence again, silence in which he
  seemed to know more things than he had ever known before.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-01-03"
     id="ch-01-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">ONE afternoon he called at Harrington's, in the High Street,
  to buy a book. It was a tiny low-roofed shop, the only one of its kind in
  Millstead, and with the sale of books it combined that of newspapers,
  stationery, pictures and fancy goods. It was always dark and shadowy, yet,
  unlike the Head's study at the school, this gloom possessed a cheerful
  soothing quality that made the shop a pleasant haven of refuge when the
  pavements outside were dazzling and sun-scorched. It was on such an afternoon
  that Speed visited the shop for the first time. Usually he had no occasion
  to, for, though he dealt with Harrington's, an errand-boy visited the school
  every morning to take orders and saved him the trouble of a walk into the
  village. This afternoon, however, he recollected a text-book that he wanted
  and had forgotten to order; besides, the heat of the mid-afternoon tempted
  him to seek shelter in one or other of the tranquil diamond-windowed shops
  whose sun-blinds sprawled unevenly along the street. It was the hottest day
  of the term, so far. A huge thermometer outside Harrington's gave the shade
  temperature as a little over seventy-nine; all the roadway was bubbling with
  little gouts of soft tar. The innumerable dogs of Millstead, quarrelsome by
  nature, had called an armistice on account of the heat, and lay languidly
  across shady sections of the pavement. Speed, tanned by a week of successive
  hot days, with a Panama pushed down over his forehead to shield his eyes from
  dazzle, pushed open the small door and entered the cool cavern of the
  shop.</p>

  <p>His eyes, unaccustomed to the gloom, were blind for a moment, but he heard
  movement of some kind behind the counter. "I want an atlas of the British
  Isles," he said, feeling his way across the shop. "A school atlas, I mean.
  Cheap, rather, you know&mdash;about a shilling or one-and-sixpence."</p>

  <p>He heard Clare's voice reply: "Yes, Mr. Speed, I know what you want. Hot
  weather, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>She went on, searching meanwhile along same shelves: "Nice of you not to
  bother about seeing me home the other night, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>He said, with a touch of embarrassment: "Well, you see, you told me.
  About&mdash;about Miss Ervine getting jealous, you know."</p>

  <p>"It was nice of you to take my information without doubting it."</p>

  <p>He said, rather to his own surprise: "As a matter of fact, I'm not sure
  that I don't doubt it. Miss Ervine seems to me a perfectly delightful and
  natural girl, far too unsophisticated to be jealous of anybody. The more I
  see of her the more. I like her."</p>

  <p>After a pause she answered quietly: "Well, I'm not surprised at that."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he went on, "with her it's rather the opposite. I mean, the
  more she sees of me the less she likes me. Isn't that it?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think she likes you any less than she did at first...Here's
  the atlas. It's one and three&mdash;I'd better put it on your account,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, of course...So you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him quickly with: "Mr. Speed, you'd better not ask me what
  I think. You're far more subtle in understanding people than I am, and it
  won't take you long to discover what Helen thinks of you if you set about
  with the intention...Those sketch-blocks you ordered haven't come in
  yet...Well, good afternoon!"</p>

  <p>Another customer had entered the shop, so that all he could do was to
  return a rather dazed "Good afternoon" and emerge into the blazing High
  Street. He walked back to the school in a state of not unpleasant
  puzzlement.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The term, progressed, and towards the end of May occurred
  the death of Sir Huntly Polk, Bart., Chairman of the Governors of Millstead
  School. This would not have in any way affected Speed (who had never even met
  Sir Huntly) had not a Memorial Service been arranged at which he was to play
  Chopin's Funeral March on the chapel organ. It was a decent modern
  instrument, operated usually by Raggs, the visiting organist, who combined a
  past reputation of great splendour with a present passion for the <i>vox
  humana</i> stop; but Speed sometimes took the place of Raggs when Raggs
  wanted time off. And at the time fixed for the Sir Huntly Polk Memorial
  Service Raggs was adjudicating with great solemnity at a Northern musical
  festival.</p>

  <p>Speed was not a particularly good organist, and it was only reluctantly
  that he undertook Raggs's duty for him For one thing, he was always slightly
  nervous of doing things in public. And for another thing, he would have to
  practise a great deal in order to prepare himself for the occasion, and he
  had neither the time nor the inclination for hours of practice. However, when
  the Head said: "I know I can&mdash;um, yes&mdash;rely upon you, Mr. Speed,"
  Speed knew that there was no way out of it. Besides, he was feeling his way
  in the school with marvellous ease and accuracy, and each new duty undertaken
  by special request increased and improved his prestige.</p>

  <p>After a few days' trial he found it was rather pleasant to climb the
  ladder to the organ-loft amid the rich cool dusk of the chapel, switch on the
  buzzing motor that operated the electric power, and play, not only Chopin's
  Funeral March but anything else he liked. Often he would merely improvise,
  beginning with a simple theme announced on single notes, and broadening and
  loudening into climax. Always as he played he could see the shafts of
  sunlight falling amidst the dusty pews, the many-coloured glitter of the
  stained-glass in the oriel window, and in an opaque haze in the distance the
  white cavern of the chapel entrance beyond which all was light and sunshine.
  The whole effect, serene and tranquillising, hardly stirred him to any
  distinctly religious emotion, but it set up in him acutely that emotional
  sensitiveness to things secret and unseen, that insurgent consciousness,
  clear as the sky, yet impossible to translate into words, of deep wells of
  meaning beneath all the froth and commotion of his five passionate
  senses.</p>

  <p>There was a mirror just above the level of his eyes as he sat at the
  keyboard, a mirror by means of which he could keep a casual eye on the pulpit
  and choir-stalls and the one or two front pews. And one golden afternoon as
  he was playing the <i>adagio</i> movement out of Beethoven's "Sonata
  Pathétique," a stray side-glance into the mirror showed him that he had an
  audience&mdash;of one. She was sitting at the end of the front pew of all,
  nearest the lectern; she was listening, very simply and unspectacularly.
  Speed's first impulse was to stop; his second to switch off from the "Sonata
  Pathétique" into something more blatantly dramatic. He had, with the first
  kindling warmth of the sensation of seeing her, a passionate longing to touch
  somehow her emotions, or, if he could not do that, to stir her
  sentimentality, at any rate; he would have played the most saccharine
  picture-palace trash, with <i>vox humana</i> and <i>tremolo</i> stops
  combined, if he had thought that by doing so he could fill her eyes. Third
  thoughts, however, better than either the second or first, told him that he
  had better finish the <i>adagio</i> movement of the Sonata before betraying
  the fact that he knew she was present. He did so accordingly, playing rather
  well; then, when the last echoes had died away, he swung his legs over the
  bench and addressed her. He said, in a conversational tone that sounded
  rather incongruous in its surroundings: "Good afternoon, Miss Ervine!"</p>

  <p>She looked up, evidently startled, and answered, with a half-smile: "Oh,
  good afternoon, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>He went on: "I hope I haven't bored you. Is there anything in particular
  you'd like me to play to you?"</p>

  <p>She walked out of the pew and along the tiled arena between the
  choir-stalls to a point where she stood gazing directly up at him. The organ
  was on the south side of the choir, perched rather precipitously in an
  overhead chamber that looked down on to the rest of the chapel rather as a
  bay-window looks on to a street. To Speed, as he saw her, the situation
  seemed somewhat like the balcony scene with the positions of Romeo and Juliet
  reversed. And never, he thought, had she looked so beautiful as she did then,
  with her head poised at an upward angle as if in mute and delicate appeal,
  and her arms limply at her side, motionless and inconspicuous, as though all
  the meaning and significance of her were flung upwards into the single
  soaring glance of her eyes. A shaft of sunlight, filtered through the crimson
  of an apostle's robe, struck her hair and kindled it at once into flame; her
  eyes, blue and laughing, gazed heavenwards with a look of matchless
  tranquillity. She might have been a saint, come to life out of the
  sun-drenched stained-glass.</p>

  <p>She cried out, like a happy child: "Oh, I <i>have</i> enjoyed it, Mr.
  Speed! <i>All</i> of it. I <i>do</i> wish I could come up there and watch you
  play!"</p>

  <p>With startled eagerness he answered: "Come up then&mdash;I should be
  delighted! Go round into the vestry and I'll help you up the ladder."</p>

  <p>Instinct warned him that she was only a child, interested in the merely
  mechanical tricks of how things were done; that she wanted to see the working
  of the stops and pedals more than to hear the music; that this impulse of
  hers did not betoken any particular friendliness for him or admiration for
  his playing. Yet some secondary instinct, some quick passionate enthusiasm,
  swept away the calculating logic of that, and made him a prey to the wildest
  and raptest of anticipations.</p>

  <p>In the vestry she blushed violently as he met her; she seemed more a child
  than ever before. And she scampered up the steep ladder into the loft with an
  agility that bewildered him.</p>

  <p>He never dreamt that she could so put away all fear and embarrassment of
  his presence; as she clambered up on to the end of the bench beside him (for
  there was no seating-room anywhere else) he wondered if this were merely a
  mood of hers, or if some real and deep change, had come over her since their
  last meeting. She was so delicately lovely; to see her there, with her eyes
  upon him, so few inches from his, gave him a curious electrical pricking of
  the skin. Sometimes, he noticed, her eyes watched his hands steadily;
  sometimes, with a look half-bold, half-timid, they travelled for an instant
  to his face. He even wondered, with an egotism that made him smile inwardly,
  if she were thinking him good-looking.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, beginning to pull out the necessary stops, "what shall we
  have?&mdash;'The Moonlight Sonata,' eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she assented, eagerly. "I've heard Clare talk about it."</p>

  <p>He played it to her; then he played her a medley of Bach, Dvorak, Mozart,
  Mendelssohn and Lemare. He was surprised and pleased to discover that, on the
  whole, she preferred the good music to the not so good, although, of course,
  her musical taste was completely unsophisticated. Mainly, too, it was the
  music that kept her attention, though she had a considerable childish
  interest in his manual dexterity and in the mechanical arrangement of the
  stops and couplings. She said once, in a pause between two pieces: "Aren't
  they strange hands?" He replied, laughing away his embarrassment: "I don't
  know. Are they?"</p>

  <p>After he had played, rather badly but with great verve, the <i>Ruy
  Blas</i> Overture of Mendelssohn, she exclaimed: "Oh, I wish I could play
  like that!"</p>

  <p>He said: "But you do play the piano, don't you? And I prefer the piano to
  the organ: it's less mechanical."</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands together in a captivatingly childish gesture of
  excitement and said: "Oh yes, the piano's lovely, isn't it? But I can't play
  well&mdash;oh, I wish I could!"</p>

  <p>"You could if you practised hard enough," he answered, with prosaic
  encouragement. "I can hear you sometimes, you know, when I'm in my room at
  nights and the window's open. I think you could become quite a good
  player."</p>

  <p>She leaned her elbow on the keys and started in momentary fright at the
  resulting jangle of sound. "I&mdash;I get so nervous," she said. "I don't
  know why. I could never play except to myself&mdash;and Clare." She added,
  slowly, and as if the revelation had only barely come to her: "Do you
  know&mdash;it's strange, isn't it&mdash;I think&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I think I
  might be able to play in front of you&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;without being
  nervous!"</p>

  <p>He laughed boisterously and swung himself off the bench. "Very well, then,
  that's fine news! You shall try. You shall play some of the Chopin waltzes to
  me. Not very suitable for an organ, but that doesn't matter. Sit further on
  this bench and play on the lower keyboard. Never mind about the pedals. And
  I'll manage the stops for you."</p>

  <p>She wriggled excitedly into the position he had indicated and, laughing
  softly, began one of the best-known of the waltzes. The experiment was not
  entirely successful, for even an accomplished pianist does not play well on
  an organ for the first time, nor do the Chopin waltzes lend themselves aptly
  to such an instrument. But one thing, and to Speed the main thing of all, was
  quite obvious: she was, as she had said she would be, entirely free from
  nervousness of him. After ploughing rather disastrously through a dozen or so
  bars she stopped, turned to him with flushed cheeks and happy eyes, and
  exclaimed: "There! That's enough! It's not easy to play, is it?"</p>

  <p>He said, smiling down at her: "No, it's rather hard, especially at
  first...But you weren't nervous then, were you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," she answered, proudly. She added, with a note of warning:
  "Don't be surprised if I am when you come in to our house to dinner I'm
  always nervous when father's there."</p>

  <p>Almost he added: "So am I." But the way in which she had mentioned future
  invitations to dinner at the Head's house gave him the instant feeling that
  henceforward the atmosphere on such occasions would be subtly different from
  ever before. The Head's drawing-room, with the baby grand piano and the
  curio-cabinets and the faded cabbage-like design of the carpet, would never
  look quite the same again; the Head's drawing-room would look, perhaps, less
  like a cross between a lady's boudoir and the board-room of a City company;
  even the Head's study might take on a kindlier, less sinister hue.</p>

  <p>He said, still with his eyes smiling upon her: "Who teaches you the
  piano?"</p>

  <p>"A Miss Peacham used to. I don't have a teacher now."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, beginning to flush with the consciousness of his
  great daring, "if you would care to let me help you at all. I should be
  delighted to do so, you know, at any time. Since"&mdash;he laughed a
  little&mdash;"since you're no longer a scrap nervous of me, you might find me
  useful in giving you a few odd hints."</p>

  <p>He waited, anxious and perturbed, for her reply. After a sufficient pause
  she answered slowly, as if thinking it out: "That would
  be&mdash;rather&mdash;fine&mdash;I think."</p>

  <p>Most inopportunely then the bell began to ring for afternoon school, and,
  most inopportunely also, he was due to take five <i>beta</i> in drawing. They
  clambered down the ladder, chatting vivaciously the while, and at the vestry
  door, when they separated she said eagerly: "Oh, I've had <i>such</i> a good
  time, Mr. Speed. Haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Rather!" he answered, with boyish emphasis and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>That afternoon hour, spent bewilderingly with five <i>beta</i> in the
  art-room that was full of plaster casts and free-hand models and framed
  reproductions of famous pictures, went for Speed like the passage of a
  moment. His heart and brain were tingling with excitement, teeming with
  suppressed consciousness. The green of the lawns as he looked out of the
  window seemed greener than ever before; the particles of dust that shone in
  the shafts of sunlight seemed to him each one mightily distinct; the glint of
  a boy's golden it in the sunshine was, to his eyes, like a patch of flame
  that momentarily put all else in a haze. It seemed to him, passionately and
  tremendously, that for the first time in his life he was alive; more than
  that even: it seemed to him that for the first time since the beginning of
  all things life had come shatteringly into the world.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">"I should think, Mr. Speed, you have found out by now
  whether Helen likes you or not."</p>

  <p>Those words of Clare Harrington echoed in his ears as he walked amidst the
  dappled sunlight on the Mill-stead road. They echoed first of all in the
  quiet tones in which Clare had uttered them; next, they took on a subtle,
  meaningful note of their own; finally, they submerged all else in a crescendo
  of passionate triumph. Speed was almost stupefied by their gradually
  self-revealing significance. He strode on faster, dug his heels more
  decisively into the dust of the roadside; he laughed aloud; his walking-stick
  pirouetted in a joyful circle. To any passer-by he must have seemed a little
  mad. And all because of a few words that Clare Harrington, riding along the
  lane on her bicycle, had stopped to say to him.</p>

  <p>June, lovely and serene, had spread itself out over Millstead like a veil
  of purest magic; every day the sun climbed high and shone fiercely; every
  night the world slept under the starshine; all the passage of nights and days
  was one moving pageant of wonderment. And Speed was happy, gloriously,
  overwhelmingly happy. Never in all his life before had he been so happy;
  never had he tasted, even to an infinitesimal extent, the kind of happiness
  that bathed and drenched him now. Rapturously lovely were those long June
  days, days that turned Millstead into a flaming paradise of sights and
  sounds. In the mornings, he rose early, took a cold plunge in the
  swimming-bath, and breakfasted with the school amidst the cool morning
  freshness that, by its very quality of chill, seemed to suggest bewitchingly
  the warmth that was to come. Chapel followed breakfast, and after that, until
  noon, his time was spent in the Art and Music Rooms and the various
  form-rooms in which he contrived to satisfy parental avidity for that species
  of geography known as commercial. From noon until midday dinner he either
  marked books in his room or went shopping into the town. During that happy
  hour the cricket was beginning, and the dining-hall at one o'clock was gay
  with cream flannels and variously chromatic blazers. Speed loved the midday
  meal with the school; he liked to chat with his neighbours at table, to
  listen to the catalogue of triumphs, anxieties, and anticipations that never
  failed to unfold itself to the sympathetic hearer. Afterwards he was free to
  spend the afternoon as he liked. He might cycle dreamily along the sleepy
  lanes and find himself at teatime in some wrinkled little sun-scorched inn,
  with nothing to do but dream his own glorious dreams and play with the
  innkeeper's languid dog and read local newspapers a fortnight old. Or he
  might stay the whole afternoon at Millstead, lazily watching the cricket from
  a deck-chair on the pavilion verandah and sipping the tuck-shop's iced
  lemonade. Less often he would play cricket himself, never scoring more than
  ten or a dozen runs, but fielding with a dogged energy which occasionally
  only just missed deserving the epithet brilliant. And sometimes, in the
  excess of his enthusiasm, he would take selected parties of the boys to
  Pangbourne Cathedral, some eighteen miles distant, and show them the immense
  nave and the Lady Chapel with the decapitated statues and the marvellous
  stained-glass of the Octagon.</p>

  <p>Then dinner, conversational and sometimes boisterous, in the Masters'
  Common-Room, and afterwards, unless it were his evening for taking
  preparation, an hour at least of silence before the corridors and dormitories
  became noisy. During this hour he would often sit by the open window in his
  room and hear the rooks cawing in the high trees and the
  <i>clankety-clank</i> of the roller on the cricket-pitch and all the mingled
  sounds and commotions that seemed to him to make the silence of the summer
  evenings more magical than ever. Often, too, he would hear the sound of the
  Head's piano, a faint half-pathetic tinkle from below.</p>

  <p>Half-past eight let loose the glorious pandemonium; he could hear from his
  room the chiming of the school-bell, and then, softly at first, but soon
  rising to a tempestuous flood, the tide of invasion sweeping down the steps
  of the Big Hall and pouring into the houses. Always it thrilled him by its
  mere strength and volume of sound; thrilled him with pride and passion to
  think that he belonged to this heart that throbbed with such onrushing zest
  and vitality. Soon the first adventurous lappings of the tide reached the
  corridor outside his room; he loved the noise and commotion of it; he loved
  the shouting and singing and yelling and the boisterous laughter; he loved
  the faint murmur of conflicting gramophones and the smells of coffee and
  cocoa that rose up from the downstairs studies; he loved the sound of old
  Hartopp's voice as he stood at the foot of the stairs at ten o'clock and
  shouted, in a key that sent up a melodious echoing through all the passages
  and landings: "Time, gentlemen, time!"&mdash;And when the lights in the
  dormitories had all been put out, and Millstead at last was silent under the
  stars, he loved above all things the strange magic of his own senses, that
  revealed him a Millstead that nobody else had ever seen, a Millstead rapt and
  ethereal, one with the haze of night and the summer starshine.</p>

  <p>He told himself, in the moments when he reacted from the abandonment of
  his soul to dreaming, that he was sentimental, that he loved too readily,
  that beauty stirred him more than it ought, that life was too vividly
  emotional, too mighty a conqueror of his senses. But then, in the calm midst
  of reasoning, that same wild, tremulous consciousness of wonder and romance
  would envelop him afresh like a strong flood; it was a fierce, passionate
  ache in his bones, only to be forgotten for unreal, unliving instants. And
  one moment, when he sat by the window hearing the far-off murmur of Chopin on
  the Head's piano, he knew most simply and perfectly why it was that all this
  was so. It was because he was very deeply and passionately in love. In his
  dreams, his wild and bewitching dreams, she was a fairy-child, ethereal and
  half unreal, the rapt half-embodied spirit of Millstead itself, luring him by
  her sweet and fragrant vitality. He saw in the sunlight always the golden
  glint of her hair; in music no more than subtle and exquisite reminders of
  her; in all the world of sights and sounds and feelings a deep transfiguring
  passion that was his own for her.</p>

  <p>And in the flesh he met her often in the school grounds, where she might
  say: "Oh, Mr. Speed, I'm <i>so</i> glad I've met you! I want you to come in
  and hear me play something." They would stroll together over the lawns into
  the Head's house and settle themselves in the stuffy-smelling drawing-room.
  Doctor and Mrs. Ervine were frequently out in the afternoons, and Potter, it
  was believed, dozed in the butler's pantry. Speed would play the piano to the
  girl and then she to him, and when they were both tired of playing they
  talked awhile. Everything of her seemed to him most perfect and delicious.
  Once he asked her tactfully about reading novelettes, and she said: "I read
  them sometimes because there's nothing in father's library that I care for.
  It's nearly all sermons and Latin grammars." Immediately it appeared to him
  that all was satisfactory and entrancingly explained; a vague unrestfulness
  in him was made suddenly tranquil; her habit of reading novelettes made her
  more dear and lovable than ever. He said: "I wonder if you'd like me to lend
  you some books?&mdash;<i>Interesting</i> books, I promise you."&mdash;She
  answered, with her child-like enthusiasm: "Oh, I'd <i>love</i> that, Mr.
  Speed!"</p>

  <p>He lent her Hans Andersen's fairy tales.</p>

  <p>Once in chapel, as he declaimed the final verse of the eighty-eighth
  Psalm, he looked for a fraction of a second at the Head's pew and saw that
  she was watching him. "Lover and friend hast Thou put far from me, and mine
  acquaintance into darkness."&mdash;He saw a blush kindle her cheeks like
  flame.</p>

  <p>One week-day morning he met the Head in the middle of the quadrangle. The
  Head beamed on him cordially and said: "I understand, Mr. Speed, that
  you&mdash;um&mdash;give my daughter&mdash;occasional&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;assistance with her music. Very kind of you, I'm sure&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;extremely kind of you, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>He added, dreamily: "My daughter&mdash;still&mdash;um, yes&mdash;still a
  child in many ways&mdash;makes few friends&mdash;um, yes&mdash;very few.
  Seems to have taken quite an&mdash;um, yes&mdash;quite a <i>fancy</i> to you,
  Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>And Speed answered, with an embarrassment that was ridiculously
  schoolboyish: "Indeed, sir?&mdash;Indeed?"</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Speech Day at Millstead.</p>

  <p>Speed sat shyly on his chair on the platform, wrapping his gown round him
  nervously, and gazing, every now and then, at the fashionably-dressed throng
  that crowded the Big Hall to its utmost capacity. It was a day of ordeals,
  but his own chief ordeal was safely past; the school-choir had grappled quite
  creditably with Stanford's <i>Te Deum</i> at the chapel service that morning.
  He was feeling very happy, even amidst his nervousness. His eyes wandered to
  the end of the front row of the auditorium, where Helen Ervine and Clare
  Harrington sat together. They were gossiping and laughing.</p>

  <p>The Chairman, Sir Henry Briggs, rose to introduce the principal guest,
  Lord Portway. Lord Portway, so said Sir Henry Briggs, needed no introduction.
  Lord Portway...</p>

  <p>Speed listened dreamfully.</p>

  <p>Then Lord Portway. Lord Portway confessed himself to be a poor speaker,
  but hoped that it would not always be those with a glib tongue that got on in
  the world. (Laughter and cheers.) When he (Lord Portway) was at school he was
  ashamed to say that he never received a single prize. (More laughter.) He
  hoped that all the boys of Millstead, whether they had prizes or not, would
  remember that it wasn't always the prize-winners at school who did best in
  the battle of life. (Hear, hear.) He would just like to give them all a word
  or two of advice. Be thorough. (Cheers.) Brilliance wasn't everything. If he
  were engaging an employee and he had the choice of two men, one brilliant and
  the other thorough, he should choose the thorough one. He was certain that
  some, at least, of those Millstead boys who had won no prizes would do great
  things and become famous in after-life...</p>

  <p>Speed watched Doctor Ervine's face; saw the firm mouth expand, from time
  to time, into a mirthless automatic smile whenever the audience was stirred
  to laughter. And Mrs. Ervine fidgeted with her dress and glanced about her
  with nervously sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>Finally, said Lord Portway, he would like to ask the Headmaster to grant
  the boys of Millstead a whole holiday...(Cheers, deafening and
  continuous.)</p>

  <p>It was, of course, the universal custom that Speech Day should be followed
  by a week-end's holiday in which those boys who lived within easy reach might
  go home. Many boys had already made their arrangements and chosen their
  trains, but, respecting the theory that the holiday depended on Lord
  Portway's asking for it, they cheered as if he had conferred an inestimable
  boon upon them.</p>

  <p>The Head, raising his hand when the clamour had lasted a sufficient time,
  announced: "My Lord, I have&mdash;um&mdash;great pleasure in granting your
  request."</p>

  <p>More deafening cheers. The Masters round about Speed, witnesses of this
  little farce for a number of successive years varying from one to thirty,
  smiled and whispered together condescendingly.</p>

  <p>Sir Henry Briggs, thick-voiced and ponderous. "I&mdash;I call upon the
  Headmaster..."</p>

  <p>Doctor Ervine rose, cleared his throat, and began: "My
  Lord&mdash;um&mdash;and Ladies and Gentlemen." A certain sage&mdash;he would
  leave it to his sixth-form boys to give the gentleman's
  name&mdash;(Laughter)&mdash;had declared that that nation was happy which had
  no history. It had often occurred to him that the remark could be neatly and
  appositely adapted to a public-school&mdash;happy was that public-school year
  about which, on Speech Day, the Headmaster could find very little to say.
  (Laughter.) Certainly it was true of this particular year. It had been a very
  happy one, a very successful one, and really, there was not much else to say.
  One or two things, however, he would like to mention especially. First, in
  the world of Sport. He put Sport first merely because alphabetically it came
  before Work. (Laughter.) Millstead had had a very successful football and
  hockey season, and only that week at cricket they had defeated Selhurst.
  (Cheers)...In the world of scholarship the year had also been successful, no
  fewer than thirty-eight Millsteadians having passed the Lower Certificate
  Examination of the Oxford and Cambridge Board. (Cheers.) One of the
  sixth-form boys, A. V. Cobham, had obtained an exhibition at Magdalen
  College, Cambridge. (Cheers.) H. O. Catterwall, who left some years back, had
  been appointed Deputy Revenue Commissioner for the district
  of&mdash;um&mdash;Bhungi-Bhoolu. (Cheers.) Two boys, R. Heming and B. Shales,
  had obtained distinctions at London University. (Cheers)...Of the Masters,
  all he could say was that he could not believe that any Headmaster in the
  country was supported by a staff more loyal and efficient. (Cheers.) They had
  to welcome one addition&mdash;he might say, although he (the addition) had
  only been at Millstead a few weeks&mdash;a very valued addition&mdash;to the
  school staff. That was Mr. Speed. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Speed was very young,
  and youth, as they all knew, was very enthusiastic. (Cheers and laughter.) In
  fact, although Mr. Speed had been at Millstead such a short time, he had
  already earned and deserved the name of the School Enthusiast. (Laughter.) He
  had had a very kind letter from Mr. Speed's father, Sir Charles
  Speed&mdash;(pause)&mdash;regretting his inability, owing to a previously
  contracted engagement, to be present at the Speech Day celebrations, and he
  (the Head) was particularly sorry he could not come because it would have
  done him good, he felt sure, to see how universally popular at Millstead was
  his enthusiastic son. (Cheers and laughter.) He hoped Millstead would have
  the benefit of Mr. Speed's gifts and personality for many, many years to
  come. (Loud cheers)...He must not conclude without some reference to the sad
  blow that had struck the school only a week or so before. He alluded to the
  lamented passing-away of Sir Huntly Polk, for many years Chairman on the
  Governing Board...</p>

  <p>Speed heard no more. He felt himself beginning to burn all over; he put
  one hand to his cheek in a vague and instinctive gesture of self-protection.
  Of course, behind his embarrassment he was pleased, rapturously pleased; but
  at first his predominant emotion was surprise. It had never occurred to him
  that the Head would mention him in speech, or that he would invite his father
  to the Speech Day ceremonies. Then, as he heard the cheering of the boys at
  the mention of his name, emotion swallowed his surprise and everything became
  a blur.</p>

  <p>After the ceremony he met the two girls outside the Big Hall. Clare said:
  "Poor man&mdash;you looked <i>so</i> uncomfortable while everybody was
  cheering you! But really, you know, it <i>is</i> nice to be praised, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>And Helen, speaking softly so that no one else should hear, whispered: "I
  daresay I can get free about nine o'clock to-night. We can go for a walk eh,
  Kenneth?&mdash;Nine o'clock by the pavilion steps, then."</p>

  <p>Her voice, muffled and yet eager, trembled like the note of a bell on a
  windy day.</p>

  <p>Speed whispered, joyously: "Righto, Helen, I'll be there."</p>

  <p>To such a pitch had their relationship developed as a result of
  music-lessons and book-lendings and casual encounters. And now they were
  living the most exquisite of all moments, when each could guess but could not
  be quite certain of the other's love. Day had followed day, each one more
  tremulously beautiful than the one before, each one more exquisitely near to
  something whose beauty was too keen and blinding to be studied; each day the
  light in their eyes had grown brighter, fiercer, more bursting from within.
  But now, as they met and separated in the laughing crowd that squirmed its
  way down the steps of the Big Hall, some subtle telepathy between their minds
  told them that never again would they shrink from the vivid joy of
  confession. To-night...thought Speed, as he went up to his room and slipped
  off his cap and gown. And the same wild ecstasy of anticipation was in
  Helen's mind as she walked with Clare across the lawns to the Head's
  house.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">That night the moon was full and high; the leaden roofs and
  cupola of the pavilion gleamed like silver plaques; and all the cricket-pitch
  was covered with a thin, white, motionless tide into which the oblong shadows
  pushed out like the black piers of a jetty. Millstead was silent and serene.
  A third of its inhabitants had departed by the evening trains; perhaps
  another third was with its parents in the lounges of the town hotels; the
  remainder, reacting from the day's excitement and sobered by the unaccustomed
  sparseness of the population, was more silent than usual. Lights gleamed in
  the dormitories and basement bathrooms, but there was an absence of stir,
  rather than of sound, which gave to the whole place a curious aspect of
  forlornness; no sudden boisterous shout sent its message spinning along the
  corridor and out of some wide-open window into the night. It was a world of
  dreams and spells, and to Speed, standing in the jet-black shadow of the
  pavilion steps, it seemed that sight and sound were almost one; that he could
  hear moonlight humming everywhere around him, and see the tremor in the sky
  as the nine o'clock chiming fell from the chapel belfry.</p>

  <p>She came to him like a shy wraith, resolving out of the haze of moonbeams.
  The bright gold of her hair, drenched now in silver, had turned to a glossy
  blackness that had in it some subtle and unearthly colour that could be
  touched rather than seen; Speed felt his fingers tingle as at a new
  sensation. Something richly and manifestly different was abroad in the world,
  something different from what had ever been there before; the grey shining
  pools of her eyes were like pictures in a trance. He knew, strangely and
  intimately, that he loved her and that she loved him, that there was
  exquisite sweetness in everything that could happen to them, that all the
  world was wonderfully in time and tune with their own blindfold yet
  miraculously self-guiding inclinations. Tears, lovely in moonlight, shone in
  her clear eyes, eyes that were deep and dark under the night sky; he put his
  arm around her and touched his cheek with hers. It was as if his body began
  to dissolve at that first ineffable thrill; he trembled vitally; then, after
  a pause of magic, kissed her dark, wet, offering lips, not with passion, but
  with all the wistful gentleness of the night itself, as if he were afraid
  that she might fly away, moth-like, from a rough touch. The moonlight, sight
  and sound fused into one, throbbed in his eyes-and ears; his heart, beating
  quickly, hammered, it seemed, against the stars. It was the most exquisite
  and tremulous revelation of heaven, heaven that knew neither bound nor
  end.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful child!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>She replied, in a voice deep as the diapason note of an organ: "<i>Am</i>
  I wonderful?"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> are," she said, after a pause.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i>?" He smiled, caressing her hair. "I feel&mdash;I feel, Helen, as
  if nothing in the world had ever happened to me until this night! Nothing at
  all!"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> do," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"As if&mdash;as if nothing in the world had ever happened to anybody until
  now."</p>

  <p>"You love me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Kenneth."</p>

  <p>"I love you."</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm glad."</p>

  <p>They stood together for a long while with the moonlight on their faces,
  watching and thinking and dreaming and wondering. The ten o'clock chimes
  littered the air with their mingled pathos and cheer; the hour had been like
  the dissolving moment of a dream.</p>

  <p>As they entered the shadows of the high trees and came in sight of
  Milner's, a tall cliff of winking yellow windows, they stopped and kissed
  again, a shade more passionately than before.</p>

  <p>"But oh," she exclaimed as they separated in the shadow of the Head's
  gateway, "I <i>wish</i> I was clever! I wish I was as clever as you! I'm not,
  Kenneth, and you mustn't think I am. I'm&mdash;I'm <i>stupid</i>, compared
  with you. And yet"&mdash;her voice kindled with a strange thrill&mdash;"and
  yet you say I'm wonderful! <i>Wonderful</i>!&mdash;<i>Am</i> I?&mdash;Really
  wonderful?"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful," he whispered, fervently.</p>

  <p>She cried, softly but with passion: "Oh, I'm glad&mdash;glad&mdash;I'm
  glad. It's&mdash;it's glorious to&mdash;to think that you think that. But oh,
  Kenneth, Kenneth, don't find out that I'm not." She added, very softly and
  almost as if reassuring herself of something: "I&mdash;I love you
  <i>very</i>&mdash;very much."</p>

  <p>They could not tear themselves away from each other. The lights in the
  dormitories winked out one by one; the quarter-chimes sprinkled their music
  on the moon-white lawns; yet still, fearful to separate, they whispered
  amidst the shadows. Millstead, towering on all sides of them vast and
  radiant, bathed them in her own deep passionless tranquillity; Millstead, a
  little forlorn that night, yet ever a mighty parent, serenely watchful over
  her children.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">He decided that night that he would write a story about
  Millstead; that he would do for Millstead what other people had already done
  for Eton and Harrow and Rugby. He would put down all the magic that he had
  seen and felt; he would transfer to paper the subtle enchantment of the
  golden summer days, the moonlit nights, the steamy warmth of the bathrooms,
  the shouting in the dormitories, the buzz of movement and conversation in the
  dining-hall, the cool gloom of the chapel&mdash;everything that came
  effortlessly into his mind whenever he thought of Millstead. All the beauty
  and emotion and rapture that he had seen and felt must not, he determined, be
  locked inside him: it clamoured to be set free, to flow strongly yet
  purposefully in the channel of some mighty undertaking.</p>

  <p>Clanwell asked him in to coffee that night: from half-past ten till
  half-past eleven Speed lounged in one of Clanwell's easy chairs and found a
  great difficulty in paying attention to what Clanwell was saying. In the end
  his thoughts burst, as it were, their barriers: he said: "D'you know,
  Clanwell, I've had an idea&mdash;some time, you know&mdash;to write a tale
  about Millstead?"</p>

  <p>"Really?&mdash;A school story, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see&mdash;I feel&mdash;oh, well&mdash;there's a sort of
  atmosphere about the place, if you know what I mean&mdash;a rather wonderful
  sort of atmosphere. If somebody could only manage to express it in words
  they'd make rather a fine story, I should think."</p>

  <p>Clanwell said: "Yes, I've known that atmosphere for a dozen years, but I'm
  quite certain I could never write about it. And you think you could?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of trying, anyway, Millstead in summertime"&mdash;Speed's voice
  quivered with rapture&mdash;"it's simply divine!"</p>

  <p>"But you haven't seen it in winter-time yet. You can't write a story about
  one summer-term."</p>

  <p>"No." Speed pondered, and said doubtfully: "No, I suppose not. It does
  sound rather arrogant, doesn't it, for me to talk of writing a school-story
  about Millstead after a few weeks at it, while you, after a dozen years,
  don't feel equal to the task?"</p>

  <p>"When one is young and in love," declared Clanwell slowly, "one feels
  arrogant."</p>

  <p>Speed laughed uproariously: it was as if Clanwell's remark had let loose a
  cataract of emotion in him. "You despise my condition a little, don't you?"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Clanwell, "I don't despise it at all: I just recognise it,
  that's all." He paused and began again: "I wonder if you'll let me speak to
  you a trifle seriously, Speed, without getting offended with me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will. Fire away!"</p>

  <p>Clanwell knocked out his pipe on the bars of the empty firegrate and said,
  rather curtly: "Don't see too much of Miss Ervine."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Speed jerked forward in his chair and a sharp light entered his eyes.
  Clanwell continued, unmoved: "You said yon weren't going to get offended,
  Speed. I hope you'll keep your promise. Understand, I've nothing to say
  against Miss Ervine at all, and if I had, I shouldn't take on the job of
  telling you about it. All that concerns me is just the matter of&mdash;of
  expediency, if you like to put it that way."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just this. It doesn't do you any good in the school to be seen
  continually meeting her. The Common-Room, which liked you immensely at first
  when you came, is just beginning to be slightly amused at you. And the boys
  have noticed it, you may be sure. Probably you'll find yourself beginning to
  be ragged about it soon."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not frightened of being ragged."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I daresay not...Still, I've said all I wanted to say. Don't
  forget, Speed, that you're pledged not to take offence."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll not do that."</p>

  <p>Just before Speed left Clanwell said: "I wouldn't start that tale of
  Millstead life just yet if I were you, Speed. Better wait till you're out of
  love, at any rate. After all, it's rather a highly coloured Millstead that
  you see at present, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You think I'm sentimental, eh?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I think you're by far the most sentimental chap I've ever
  come across!&mdash;Don't be hurt: it's not a crime. But it's just a bit of a
  danger, especially in writing a school-story. That atmosphere you talk about
  certainly <i>does</i> exist, and if I had the gift of self-expression I might
  try to write about it. I can see it clearly enough, even though I'm not a
  scrap in love, and even on the dreariest of days in the winter term. My
  advice to you is to wait and see if you can do the same...Good night,
  Speed!"</p>

  <p>"Good night," Speed called out, laughing.</p>

  <p>Down Clanwell's corridor and up the stone flight of stairs and along his
  own corridor to the door of his own room his heart was thumping violently,
  for he knew that as soon as he was alone he would be drenched in the wild,
  tumultuous rapture of his own thoughts. Clanwell's advice, hazily remembered,
  faded before the splendour of that coming onrush; the whole interview with
  Clanwell vanished as if it had never happened, as if there had been a sort of
  cataleptic vacuum intervening between that scene by the Head's gateway and
  the climb upstairs to his room.</p>

  <p>When he got to bed he could hardly sleep for joy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-01-04"
     id="ch-01-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Tim first thing that Clare Harrington said to him when they
  met a few days later in Millstead High Street was: "Oh, congratulations, Mr.
  Speed!"</p>

  <p>"Congratulations?" he echoed. "What for?" She replied quietly: "Helen has
  told me."</p>

  <p>He began to blush, and to hold his breath in an endeavour to prevent his
  cheeks from reddening to an extent that, so he felt, would be observed by
  passers-by. "Oh!" he gasped, with a half-embarrassed smile. Then, after a
  pause, he queried: "What has she told you?"</p>

  <p>And Clare answered: "That you are going to marry her."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed involuntarily, and he saw her eyes focussed on him
  strangely. A slow sensation of warmth began to envelop him; joy rose round
  him like a tide as he realised all the pivotal significance of what Clare had
  said. He was going to marry Helen!&mdash;Strange that, even amidst his most
  secret raptures, he had hardly dared to think of that! He had dreamed
  exquisite and fragile dreams of her, dreams in which she was too fairy-like
  and ethereal for marriage; doubtless, after some while, his ambitions would
  have crystallised normally, but up to the present they had no anchorage on
  earth at all. And to think that she had travelled in mind and intention more
  swiftly and further than he, to think that she had dared to deduce the final
  and ultimate reality, gave him, along with a surging overmastering joy, just
  a faint tinge of disappointment as well. But the joy, deepening and
  spreading, soon blotted out everything else: he sought Clare's hand and
  gripped it triumphantly. Tears were in his eyes and emotion clutching at his
  voice as he said: "I'm&mdash;I'm glad&mdash;she's told you. It's&mdash;it's
  fine, isn't it?&mdash;Don't you think we shall be&mdash;happy?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to be," said Clare.</p>

  <p>He struggled with the press of feeling for a moment and then said: "Oh,
  let's go into Mason's and have a cup of coffee or something. I want to talk
  to you."</p>

  <p>So they sat for a quarter of an hour at a little green-tiled table in
  Mason's highly respectable café. The room was over the shop, and besides
  affording from the window a panoramic view of the High Street, contained a
  small fire-grate, a framed picture of the interior of Mason's Hygienic
  Bakery, and a large ginger-and-white cat with kittens. Altogether it was a
  most secluded and comfortable rendezvous.</p>

  <p>All the while that they conversed he was but slowly sizing up the
  situation and experiencing little alternating wafts of disappointment and
  exhilaration. Disappointment, perhaps, that he had not been left the
  bewitching task of bringing Helen's mind, along with his own, out of the
  clouds and mists of dreams; exhilaration also, because her mind, womanishly
  direct, had evidently not needed such guidance.</p>

  <p>He talked rhapsodically to Clare; lashed himself, as it were, into a state
  of emotional fervour. He seemed eager to anticipate everything that anybody
  could possibly say to Helen's disadvantage, and to explain away the whole; it
  was as if he were championing Helen against subtle and inevitable
  disparagements. Once or twice he seemed to realise this, and to realise that
  he was defending where there was no attack, and then he stopped, looked
  confused, and waited for Clare to say something. Clare, as a matter of fact,
  said very little, and when she spoke Speed took hardly any notice, except,
  perhaps, to allow her words to suggest to him some fresh rhapsodical
  outbreak. He said, in a sudden outpouring: "Of course I know she's only a
  child. That's the wonderful charm of her&mdash;part of the wonderful charm,
  at any rate. Some people might say she wasn't clever, but she is
  <i>really</i>, you know. I admit she doesn't show up very well in company,
  but that's because she's nervous. <i>I'm</i> nervous and <i>I</i> don't show
  up well. She's got an acute little brain though. You should hear the things
  she says sometimes. Simple little things, some people might think, but
  really, when you think about them, they're clever. Of course, she hasn't been
  educated up to a good many things, but then, if she had been, she wouldn't
  have kept her child-like simplicity, would she?&mdash;She's very quick at
  picking things up, and I'm lending her heaps of books. It's the most
  beautiful job in the world, being teacher to her. I'm rapturously happy about
  it and so is she. I could never stand these empty-headed society kind of
  women who can jabber superficially in drawing-rooms about every subject under
  the sun, and really, you know, haven't got an original idea in their heads.
  Helen has the most wonderful and childlike originality, you know. You've
  noticed it yourself, I daresay. Haven't you noticed it?&mdash;Yes, I'm sure
  you must have. And to think that she really does want to marry me!"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't she want to marry you?" interjected Clare, but that was one
  of the remarks of which he took little notice. He went on eagerly: "I don't
  know what the Head will think when he gets to know about it. Most probably
  he'll be fearfully annoyed. Clanwell warned me the other night.
  Apparently"&mdash;a faint touch of bitterness came into his
  voice&mdash;"apparently it isn't the thing to treat your Headmaster's
  daughter with anything but the most distant reserve."</p>

  <p>"Another question," said Clare shrewdly, "is what <i>your</i> people will
  think about it."</p>

  <p>"My people," he replied, again with the note of bitterness in his voice,
  "will probably do what they have always done whenever I have proposed taking
  any fresh step in life."</p>

  <p>"I can guess what that is. They oppose you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not absolutely that. They recognise my right to do what I want, but
  they think I'm a fool, all the same. They don't quarrel with me. They just go
  on wishing I was like my elder brother."</p>

  <p>"What is he?"</p>

  <p>"He works in my father's office in town. My father, you know"&mdash;he
  became suddenly confidential in tone&mdash;"is a rather typical sort of
  business-man. Materialist outlook&mdash;wanted me to manage a soap-works. We
  never got on absolutely well together. When I told him I was going to get a
  mastership at a public school he thought I was mad."</p>

  <p>"And what will he think when you tell him you are going to marry the
  Headmaster's daughter?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her curiously, for the first time intent upon her personally,
  for something in the way she had uttered that last question set up in him the
  suspicion that she was laughing at him. A careful scrutiny of her features,
  however, revealed no confirmation: he looked away again, shrugged his
  shoulders, and said: "Probably he'll think I'm madder than ever."</p>

  <p>She gave him a curious glance with uptilted lips which he could not
  properly interpret. "Anyway," she said, quietly, "I shouldn't tell him that
  Helen's a child."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>Clare gave him again that curious, uninterpretable glance. "Because she
  isn't, that's all."</p>

  <p>He was recovering from his surprise and was about to say something when
  she interrupted him with, perhaps, the first touch of animation that had so
  far distinguished her side of the conversation. "I told you," she said, "on
  the first night of term that you didn't understand Helen. And still you
  don't. If you did, you'd know that she was a woman, not a child at all."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd explain a little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't need any explanation. You either know it or don't know it.
  Apparently you <i>don't</i> know it...And now, Mr. Speed, I'm afraid I'll
  have to go&mdash;I can't leave the boy to manage the shop by himself all
  morning."</p>

  <p>Speed had the sensation that she was slightly out of patience with
  him.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Clare brought him to earth; his dreams crumpled when he was
  with her; his emotional outlook sagged, as it were, with the perhaps imagined
  pricklings of her shrewdness. He hated her, ever so slightly, because he felt
  sometimes between her and himself a subtle and secret hostility, a hostility
  in which, because of her cool imperturbability, she had all the advantage.
  But when he was not with her his imagination soared and flamed up higher than
  ever; it was a fire that Clare's temperament could only make sulky. Those
  final weeks of the summer term were glorious beyond words. He took Clanwell's
  advice to the extent of not meeting Helen on the school premises, but hardly
  a day passed without some wonderful and secret assignation; the two of them
  would arrange afternoon excursions together, picnics, at Parminters, strolls
  along the Millstead road at dusk. It was all deeply and inexpressibly lovely.
  He told her a great many of his own dreams and ambitions, making her share
  them with him; she kindled aptly to his own enthusiasms, readily as a child
  might have done. For he was certain that Clare was wrong in that: Helen was
  only a child. To marry her seemed a thing of almost unearthly delicacy; he
  found himself pitying her sometimes because of the future. Above all, that
  she should wish to marry him, that her love should be capable of such a
  solemn and ineffable desire, seemed to him nearly a miracle. "Fragile little
  thing!" he said to her once, as he kissed her&mdash;"I'm almost afraid of
  breaking you!"&mdash;She answered, in that wistful childlike voice that was
  perhaps incongruously sombre in tone: "<i>Am</i> I fragile?"</p>

  <p>Once, towards dusk, they met the Head along the Millstead road. He raised
  his hat and passed them, muttering: "Taking an&mdash;um&mdash;stroll,
  Helen&mdash;um&mdash;beautiful evening&mdash;um, yes&mdash;good evening, Mr.
  Speed!"</p>

  <p>He wore the air of being marvellously discreet.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Conversation at dinner in the Masters' Common-Room turned
  one evening upon Harrington. "Old Harrington's pretty bad again," Pritchard
  had said. "I heard in the town to-day that he'd had another stroke."</p>

  <p>Speed, curiously startled by the utterance of the name, exclaimed: "What,
  the Harringtons who keep the bookshop?&mdash;I didn't know he was ill."</p>

  <p>"Been ill ever since I can remember," replied Pritchard laconically.</p>

  <p>Then Speed remembered something that the Head had once told him about
  Harrington being a littérateur and an author of books on ethics.</p>

  <p>"I never met him," he said, tentatively, seeking to guide the conversation
  into a discussion of the man.</p>

  <p>Pritchard, ever ready to follow up a lead given to him, remarked: "You
  missed something, then. He was quite a character. Used to teach here once,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"Used to <i>try</i> to, anyway, when they'd let him. Couldn't keep any
  sort of discipline. During his first prep they poured ink down his neck."</p>

  <p>"Pritchard needn't talk," interposed Clanwell, laughing. "During
  <i>his</i> first prep they mixed carbide and water under his chair." The rest
  of the Common-Room among whom Pritchard was no favourite, joined in the
  laughter. Then Clanwell took up the thread, kinder in his narrative than
  Pritchard had been. "I liked Harrington. He was a good sort, but he wasn't
  made for a schoolmaster. I told him so, and after his breakdown he took my
  advice and left the profession."</p>

  <p>"Breakdown?" said Speed. "He had a breakdown then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, his wife died when his daughter was born. He never told us anything
  about it. One morning he collapsed over a four <i>alpha</i> English form. I
  was next door. I was used to a row, but the terrible pandemonium made me
  wonder if anything had happened. I went in and found the little devils giving
  him sportive first-aid. They'd half undressed him My word!&mdash;I picked out
  those that were in my house and gave them a tidy thrashing. Don't you
  remember, Lavery?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," said the indolent Lavery, "you trying to persuade me to do
  the same with my little lot."</p>

  <p>"But Harrington?" queried Speed, anxious that the conversation should not
  be diverted into other channels.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," resumed Clanwell, "he left Millstead and took to&mdash;shall
  we call it literature?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"What do I mean?&mdash;" Clanwell laughed. "D'you mean to tell me you
  haven't heard of Samuel Harrington, author of the famous
  'Helping-Hand-Books'?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Then I must lend you one or two of them. They'll do you good. Lavery and
  I attribute our remarkable success in life to our careful study of them,
  don't we, Lavery?"</p>

  <p>"Do we, Clanwell?"</p>

  <p>Ransome, wizened and Voltairish, and agreeable company when stirred to
  anecdote, began: "Ah! 'How to be Powerful' was the best, though I think 'How
  to Become a Dominating Personality' was pretty good. The drollest of all was
  'How to Meet Difficulties.' Speed has a treat in store if he hasn't read
  them. They're all in the School-library. The fellow used to send the Head
  free autographed copies of each one of them as it appeared."</p>

  <p>Ransome, rarely beguiled into conversation, always secured a respectful
  audience. After a silence he went on: "I used to know old Harrington pretty
  well after he took to&mdash;writing. He once told me the entire circumstances
  of his début into the literary profession. It was rather droll."</p>

  <p>Ransome paused, and Speed said: "I'd like to hear it."</p>

  <p>A murmur of assent followed from the rest, and Ransome, not without
  pleasure at the flattery of his being eagerly listened to, crumbled a piece
  of bread by his plate and resumed. "He told me that one morning after he'd
  left Millstead he was feeling especially miserable and having a breakfast of
  tea and dry bread. So he <i>said</i>, anyway. Remember that, at that time, he
  had a baby to look after. The postman brought him, that morning, a letter
  from an old school friend of his, a rector in Somerset, asking him if he
  would care to earn half-a-guinea by writing for him an address on
  'Self-Control' for the Young Women's Sunshine Club at Little Pelthing,
  Somerset. I remember the name of the club and the village because I remember
  they struck me as being rather droll at the time. Harrington said the letter,
  or part of it, went something like this: 'I have just become the proud father
  of a most wonderful little baby boy, and you can imagine how infernally busy
  as well as infernally happy I am. Could you oblige me with an address on
  "Self-Control"?&mdash;You were always rather good at dashing off essays when
  we were at school. The address should have a strong moral flavour and should
  last from half-an-hour to forty minutes.'...Well, Harrington sat down to
  write that address on 'Self-Control.' He told me that he knew all that
  anybody need know about self-control, because he was using prodigious
  quantities of it all the time he was writing. Anyway, it was a fine address.
  The Reverend Henry Beauchamp Northcroft&mdash;another name droll enough to be
  remembered&mdash;delivered it to the united assembly of the Little Pelthing
  Young Women's Sunshine Club, and everybody said it was the finest and most
  inspiring address they had ever heard from his lips. It glowed, as it were,
  from within; it radiated hope; it held a wonderful and sublime message for
  mankind. And, in addition, it lasted from half-an-hour to forty minutes. Nor
  was this all. A wealthy and philanthropic lady in the Reverend Henry
  Beauchamp Northcroft's congregation&mdash;Harrington <i>did</i> tell me her
  name, but I suspect it was not droll enough for me to remember
  it&mdash;suggested that, at her expense, the address should be printed and
  published in pamphlet form. With Harrington's consent this was done, and, so
  he told me, no fewer than twenty-five thousand copies of 'Self-Control' were
  despatched to various centres in England, America, the Colonies, and on board
  His Majesty's ships."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe all this?" exclaimed Clanwell, laughing, to the
  Common-Room in general.</p>

  <p>"Whether you believe it or not," replied Ransome, severely, "it's
  sufficiently droll for it to be worth hearing. And a large part of it is
  true, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"Go on then," said Clanwell.</p>

  <p>Ransome (spreading himself out luxuriously), went on: "It seemed to
  Harrington that having, to put it vulgarly, scored a fine though anonymous
  bull's-eye with Self-Control,' he might, with profit, attempt to do similar
  business on his own account. Accordingly, he wrote a collection of some
  half-dozen didactic essays on such subjects as 'Immortality," Health and
  Wealth,' The Art of Happiness,' and so on, and sent them to a well-known
  publisher of works on religion and ethics. This fellow, after a most
  unethical delay of several months, returned them with his curt regrets and
  the information that such stuff was a drug on the publishing market. Then
  Harrington, nothing in the least daunted, sent them straightway off again to
  a publisher of sensational novels. This last gentleman, he <i>was</i> a
  gentleman, for he replied almost immediately, agreeing to publish if Mr.
  Harrington would&mdash;I'm quoting hazily from the letter which Harrington
  showed me&mdash;if he would 'under-take to supply a further eighteen essays
  to make up a book of the customary eighty-thousand-word length.'&mdash;'You
  have a distinct vein of humour,' wrote Mr. Potts, of Larraby and Potts,
  Limited&mdash;that was the firm&mdash;'and we think your work would be very
  saleable if you would throw off what appears to be a feeling of
  restraint.'&mdash;So I guess Harrington just threw off this feeling of
  restraint, whatever exactly it was, and began on those eighteen essays...I
  hope this tale isn't boring you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all!"&mdash;"Go on!"&mdash;came the chorus. Ransome smiled.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to go on to. The book of essays was called Sky-Signs,'
  and it was reviewed rather pleasantly in some of the papers. Then followed
  'About It and About,' a further bundle of didactic essays which ran into five
  editions in six months. And then 'Through my Lattice Window,' which was the
  sort of book you were not ashamed to take into the pew with you and read
  during the offertory, provided, of course, that it was handsomely bound in
  black morocco. And lastly came the Helping-Hand-Books, which Mr. Speed must
  read if he is to consider his education complete. That's all. The story's
  over."</p>

  <p>After the first buzz of comment Speed said: "I suppose he made plenty of
  money out of that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>Ransome replied: "Yes, he made it and then he lost it. He dabbled in
  finance and had a geometrical theory about the rise and fall of rubber
  shares. Then he got plentifully in debt and when his health began to give way
  he took the bookshop because he thought it would be an easy way to earn
  money. He'd have lost on that if his daughter hadn't been a born
  business-woman."</p>

  <p>"But surely," said Clanwell, "the money kept on trickling in from his
  books?"</p>

  <p>Ransome shook his head. "No, because he'd sold the copyrights for cash
  down. He was a child in finance. But all the same he <i>knew</i> how to make
  money. For that you should refer to his book 'How to be Successful,'
  <i>passim</i>. It's full of excellent fatherly advice."</p>

  <p>Ransome added, with a hardly perceptible smile: "There's also a chapter
  about Courtship and Marriage. You might find it interesting, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>Speed blushed furiously.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, strolling over to the House with Clanwell, Speed said: "I say,
  was that long yarn Ransome told about Harrington true, do you think?"</p>

  <p>Clanwell replied: "Well, it may have been. You can never be quite certain
  with Ransome, though. But he does know how to tell a story, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>Speed agreed.</p>

  <p>Late that night the news percolated, somehow or other, that old Harrington
  was dead.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Curious, perhaps, that Speed, who had never even seen the
  man, and whose knowledge of him was derived almost solely from Ransome's
  "droll" story, should experience a sensation of personal loss! Yet it was so,
  mysteriously and unaccountably: the old man's death took his mind further
  away from Millstead than anything had been able to do for some time. The
  following morning he met Helen in the lane outside the school and his first
  remark to her was: "I say, have you heard about old Harrington?"</p>

  <p>Helen said: "Yes, isn't it terrible?&mdash;I'm so sorry for Clare&mdash;I
  went down to see her last night. Poor Clare!"</p>

  <p>He saw tears in her eyes, and at this revelation of her abounding pity and
  warm-heartedness, his love for her welled up afresh, so that in a few seconds
  his soul was wholly in Millstead again. "You look tired, Helen," he said,
  taking her by the arm and looking down into her eyes.</p>

  <p>Then she burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," she said, between gulps of sobbing. "It's so sad, though,
  isn't it?&mdash;Death always frightens me. Oh, I'm so sorry for Clare. Poor
  darling Clare!...Oh, Kenneth&mdash;I <i>was</i> miserable last night when I
  came home. I didn't know what to do, I was so miserable. I&mdash;I <i>did</i>
  want to see you, and I&mdash;I walked along the garden underneath Clanwell's
  room and I heard your voice in there."</p>

  <p>He said, clasping her arm tightly: "Yes, I went to Clanwell for coffee
  after prep."</p>

  <p>She went on pathetically: "You sounded so happy&mdash;I heard you
  laughing. Oh, it was terrible to hear you laughing when I was miserable!"</p>

  <p>"Poor little child!"&mdash;He bent down suddenly and kissed her eyes.
  "What a sad and forlorn little girl you are this morning!&mdash;Don't yon
  guess why I'm so happy nowadays?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you?"</p>

  <p>He said, very slowly and beautifully: "Because of you. Because you have
  made my life utterly and wonderfully different. Because all the beauty in the
  world reminds me of you. When I wake up in the morning with the sun on my
  face I want to roar with laughter&mdash;I don't know why, except that I'm so
  happy."</p>

  <p>She smiled gratefully and looked up into his face with large, tender eyes.
  "Sometimes," she said, "beauty makes me want to cry, not to laugh. Last
  night, in the garden, everything was so lovely, and yet so sad. Don't you
  think beautiful things are sad sometimes?"&mdash;She paused and went on, with
  less excitement: "When I went in, about ten o'clock, I was so miserable I
  went in the dining-room to be alone. I was crying and father came in."</p>

  <p>"Well?" he whispered, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"He wanted to know what was the matter."</p>

  <p>"And you told him about Clare's father, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "Don't be angry," she pleaded, laying a hand on his
  arm. "I don't know what made me do it&mdash;I suppose it was instinct.
  Anyway, yon were going to, soon, even if I hadn't. II told father
  about&mdash;us!"</p>

  <p>"You did?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Don't be angry with me."</p>

  <p>"My darling, I'm not angry with you. What did he say?"</p>

  <p>She came so close to him that he could feel her body trembling with
  emotion. "He didn't mind," she whispered. "He didn't mind at all. Kenneth,
  aren't you glad?&mdash;Isn't it fine of him?"</p>

  <p>"Glorious!" he answered, taking a deep breath. Again the tide of joy
  seemed to engulf him, joy immense and stupefying. He would have taken her in
  his arms and kissed her had he not seen people coming along the lane. "It's
  wonderful, Helen!" he whispered. Then some secondary thought seemed to strike
  him suddenly: he said: "But why were you miserable a little while ago? Didn't
  the good news make you feel happy?"</p>

  <p>She answered, still with a touch of sadness: "I didn't know whether you
  would think it was good news."&mdash;"Helen!" he exclaimed remonstratively,
  clasping her tightly to him: she went on, smiling at him: "Yes, it's silly of
  me, isn't it?&mdash;But Kenneth, Kenneth, I don't know how it is, I'm never
  quite certain of you&mdash;there's always a funny sort of fear in my mind! I
  know it's silly. I can't help it, though. Perhaps it will all be different
  some day."</p>

  <p>"Some day!" he echoed, gazing into her uplifted eyes.</p>

  <p>A vision, secret and excruciatingly lovely, filled their eyes for a
  moment. He knew then that to marry her had become his blinding and passionate
  ambition.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">The <i>Millstead and District Advertiser</i> had a long and
  sympathetic appreciation of the late Mr. Samuel Harrington in its first July
  issue. The Helping-Hand-Books were described as "pleasant little homilies
  written with much charm and humour." Speed took one or two of them out of the
  School Library and read them.</p>

  <p>About a week after the funeral he called at the shop, ostensibly to buy a
  book, but really to offer his condolences. He had been meaning to go, for
  several days in succession, but a curious dread of an interview with Clare
  had operated each time for postponement. Nor could he understand this dread.
  He tried to analyse it, to discover behind it any conceivable reason or
  motive; but the search was in vain. He was forced to suppose, vaguely, that
  the cause of it was that slight but noticeable temperamental hostility
  between himself and Clare which always resulted in a clouding over of his
  dreams.</p>

  <p>It was a chilly day for July; there was no sun, and the gas was actually
  lit in the shop when he called. The boy, a smart under-sized youngster, was
  there to serve him, but he asked for Miss Harrington. She must have heard his
  voice, for she appeared almost straightway, dressed neatly and soberly in
  black, and greeted him with a quite brisk: "Good afternoon, Mr. Speed!"</p>

  <p>He shook hands with her gravely and began to stammer: "I should have
  called before, Miss Harrington, to offer you my sincerest sympathies,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held up her hand in an odd little gesture of reproof and said,
  interrupting him: "Please don't. If you want a chat come into the back room.
  Thomas can attend to the shop."</p>

  <p>He accepted her invitation almost mechanically. It was a small room, full
  of businesslike litter such as is usual in the back rooms of shops, but a
  piano and bookcase gave it a touch of individuality. As she pointed him to a
  seat she said: "Don't think me rude, but this is the place for conversation.
  The shop is for buying things. You'll know in future, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded somewhat vaguely. He could not determine what exactly was
  astounding in her, and yet he realised that the whole effect of her was
  somehow astounding. More than ever was he conscious of the subtle hostility,
  by no means amounting to unfriendliness, but perhaps importing into her
  regard for him a tinge of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," he said, approaching the subject very deliberately, "that
  until a very short time ago I knew nothing at all about Mr. Harrington? You
  never told me."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" She was on her guard in an instant. He went on: "You may
  think me sincere or not as you choose, but I should like to have met
  him."</p>

  <p>"He had a dislike of being met."</p>

  <p>She said that with a touch of almost vicious asperity.</p>

  <p>He went on, far less daunted by her rudeness than he would have been if
  she had given way to emotion of any kind: "Anyway I have got to know him as
  well as I can by reading his books."</p>

  <p>"What a way to get to know him!" she exclaimed, contemptuously. She looked
  him sternly in the face and said: "Be frank, Mr. Speed, and admit that you
  found my father's books the most infantile trash you ever read in your
  life!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Harrington!" he exclaimed, protesting. She rose, stood over him
  menacingly, and cried: "You have your chance to be frank, mind!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her, tried to frame some polite reply, and found himself
  saying astonishingly: "Well, to be perfectly candid, that was rather my
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"And mine," she added quietly.</p>

  <p>She was calm in an instant. She looked at him almost sympathetically for a
  moment, and with a sudden gesture of satisfaction sat down in a chair
  opposite to his. "I'm glad you were frank with me, Mr. Speed," she said. "I
  can talk to anybody who's frank with me. It's your nature to confide in
  anybody who gives yon the least encouragement, but it's not mine I'm rather
  reticent. I remember once you talked to me a lot about your own people.
  Perhaps you thought it strange of me not to reciprocate."</p>

  <p>"No, I never thought of it then."</p>

  <p>"You didn't?&mdash;Well, I thought perhaps you might have done. Now that
  you've shown yourself candid I can tell you very briefly the sort of man my
  father was. He was a very dear old hypocrite, and I was very fond of him. He
  didn't feel half the things he said in his books, though I think he was
  honest enough to try to. He found a good thing and he stuck to it. After all,
  writing books was only his trade, and a man oughtn't to be judged entirely by
  what he's forced to do in order to make a living."</p>

  <p>He stared at her half-incredulously. She was astounding him more than
  ever. She went on, with a curious smile: "He was fifty-seven years old. When
  he died he was half-way through his eleventh book. It was to have been called
  'How to Live to Three-Score-Years-and-Ten.' All about eating nuts and keeping
  the bedroom windows open at nights, you know."</p>

  <p>He wondered if he were expected to laugh.</p>

  <p>He stammered, after a bewildered pause: "How is all this going to affect
  you?&mdash;Will you leave Millstead?"</p>

  <p>She replied, with a touch in her voice of what he thought might have been
  mockery: "My father foresaw the plight I might be in some day and
  thoughtfully left me his counsel on the subject. Perhaps you'd like me to
  read it?"</p>

  <p>She went over to the bookcase and took down an edition-de-luxe copy of one
  of the Helping-Hand-Books.</p>

  <p>"Here it is&mdash;' How to Meet Difficulties'&mdash;Page 38&mdash;I'll
  read the passage&mdash;it's only a short one. 'How is it that the greatest
  and noblest of men and women are those against whom Fate has set her most
  tremendous obstacles?&mdash;Simply that it is good for a man or a woman to
  fight, good to find paths fraught with dire perils and difficulties galore,
  good to accept the ringing challenge of the gods! Nay, I would almost go so
  far as to say: lucky is that boy or girl who is cast, forlorn and parentless
  upon the world at a tender age, for if there be greatness in him or her at
  all, it will be forced to show itself as surely as the warm suns of May
  compel each flower to put forth her bravest splendour!'...So now you know,
  Mr. Speed!"</p>

  <p>She had read the passage as if declaiming to an audience. It was quite a
  typical extract from the works of the late Mr. Harrington: such phrases as
  'dire perils,' 'difficulties galore,' and ringing challenge of the gods'
  contained all that was most truly characteristic of the prose style of the
  Helping-Hand-Books.</p>

  <p>Speed said, rather coldly: "Do you know what one would wonder, hearing you
  talk like this?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"One would wonder if you had any heart at all."</p>

  <p>Again the curious look came into her eyes and the note of asperity into
  her voice. "If I had, do you think I would let you see it, Mr. Speed?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>They stared at each other almost defiantly for a moment; then, as if by
  mutual consent, allowed the conversation to wander into unimportant gossip
  about Millstead. Nor from those placid channels did it afterwards stray away.
  Hostility of a kind persisted between them more patently than ever; yet, in a
  curiously instinctive way, they shook hands when they separated as if they
  were staunch friends.</p>

  <p>As he stepped out into High Street the thought of Helen came to him as a
  shaft of sunlight round the edges of a dark cloud.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">Term finished in a scurry of House-matches and examinations.
  School House won the cricket trophy and there was a celebratory dinner at
  which Speed accompanied songs and made a nervously witty speech and was
  vociferously applauded. "We all know we're the best House," said Clanwell,
  emphatically, "and what we've got to do is just to prove to other people that
  we are." Speed said: "I've only been in School House a term, but it's been
  long enough time for me to be glad I'm where I am and not in any other
  House." (Cheers.) Amidst such jingoist insincerities a very pleasant evening
  romped its way to a close. The following day, the last day of term, was
  nearly as full of new experiences as had been the first day. School House
  yard was full of boxes and trunks waiting to be collected by the railway
  carriers, and in amongst it all, small boys wandered forlornly, secretly
  happy yet weak with the cumulative passion of anticipation. In the evening
  there was the farewell dinner in the dining-hall, the distribution of the
  terminal magazine, and the end-of-term concert, this last concluding with the
  Millstead School-Song, the work of an uninspired composer in one of his most
  uninspired moments. Then, towards ten o'clock in the evening, a short service
  in chapel, followed by a "rag" on the school quadrangle, brought the long
  last day to a close. Cheers were shouted for the Masters, for Doctor and Mrs.
  Ervine, for those leaving, and (facetiously) for the school porter. That
  night there was singing and rowdyism in the dormitories, but Speed did not
  interfere.</p>

  <p>He was ecstatically happy. His first term had been a triumph. And,
  fittingly enough, it had ended with the greatest triumph of all. Ever since
  Helen had told him of her confession to her father, Speed had been making up
  his mind to visit the Head and formally put the matter before him. That
  night, the last night of the summer term, after the service in chapel, when
  the term, so far as the Head was concerned with it, was finished, Speed had
  tapped at the door of the Head's study.</p>

  <p>Once again the sight of that study, yellowly luminous in the incandescent
  glow, set up in him a sensation of sinister attraction, as if the room were
  full of melancholy ghosts. The Head was still in his surplice, swirling his
  arms about the writing-table in an endeavour to find some mislaid paper. The
  rows upon rows of shining leather-bound volumes, somebody on the Synoptic
  Gospels, somebody else's New Testament Commentary, seemed to surround him and
  enfold him like a protective rampart. The cool air of the summer night
  floated in through the slit of open window and blew the gas-light fitfully
  high and low. Speed thought, as he entered the room and saw the Head's
  shining bald head bowed over the writing-table: Here you have been for
  goodness knows how many years and terms, and now has come the end of another
  one. Don't you feel any emotion in it at all?&mdash;You are getting to be an
  old man: can you bear to think of the day you first entered this old room and
  placed those books on the shelves instead of those that belonged to your
  predecessor?&mdash;Can you bear to think of all the generations that have
  passed by, all the boys, now men, who have stared at you inside this very
  room, while time, which bore them away in a happy tide, has left you for ever
  stranded?&mdash;Why I, even I, can feel, after the first term, something of
  that poignant melancholy which, if I were in your place, would overwhelm me.
  Don't you&mdash;can't you&mdash;feel anything at all?&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Head looked up, observed Speed, and said: "Um, yes&mdash;pleased to
  see you, Mr. Speed-have you come to say good-bye&mdash;catching an early
  train to-morrow, perhaps&mdash;um, yes-eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I wanted to speak to you on a private matter. Can you spare me a
  few moments?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, most certainly. Not perhaps the&mdash;um&mdash;usual time for
  seeing me, but still&mdash;that is no matter. I shall be&mdash;um&mdash;happy
  to talk with you, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>Speed cleared his throat, shifted from one foot to another, and began,
  rather loudly, as always when he was nervous: "Miss Ervine, sir, I believe,
  spoke to you some while ago about&mdash;about herself and me, sir."</p>

  <p>The Head placed the tips of his fingers together and leaned back in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"That is so, Mr. Speed."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have been meaning to come and see you about it for some time. I
  hope&mdash;I hope you didn't think there was anything underhand in my not
  seeing you?"</p>

  <p>The Head temporised suavely: "Well-um, yes&mdash;perhaps my curiosity did
  not go so&mdash;um&mdash;so far as that. When you return to your room, Mr.
  Speed, you will find there an&mdash;um&mdash;a note from me, requesting you
  to see me to-morrow morning. I take it you have not seen that note?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see. I supposed when you entered that you were catching an early
  train in the morning and were&mdash;um&mdash;purposing to see me to-night
  instead...No matter. You will understand why I wished to see you, no
  doubt."</p>

  <p>"Possibly the same reason that I wished to see you."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes&mdash;possibly. Possibly. You have
  been-um&mdash;quite&mdash;um&mdash;speedy&mdash;in&mdash;um&mdash;pressing
  forward your suit with my daughter. Um, yes&mdash;<i>very</i> speedy, I
  think...Speedy&mdash;Ha&mdash;Ha&mdash;um, yes&mdash;the play upon words was
  quite accidental, I assure you."</p>

  <p>Speed, with a wan smile, declared: "I daresay I am to blame for not having
  mentioned it to you before now. I decided&mdash;I scarcely know why&mdash;to
  wait until term was over...I&mdash;I love your daughter, and I believe she
  loves me. That's all there is to say, I think."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Mr. Speed?&mdash;It must be a very&mdash;um&mdash;simple matter
  then."</p>

  <p>Speed laughed, recovering his assurance now that he had made his principal
  statement. "I am aware that there are complexities, sir."</p>

  <p>The Head played an imaginary tune on his desk with his outstretched
  fingers. "You must&mdash;um&mdash;listen to me for a little while, Mr. Speed.
  We like you very much&mdash;I will begin, perhaps unwisely, by telling you
  that. You have been all that we could have desired during this last
  term-given-um&mdash;every satisfaction, indeed. Naturally, I think too of my
  daughter's feelings. She is, as you say, extremely-um-fond of you, and on you
  depends to a quite considerable extent her&mdash;um&mdash;happiness. We could
  not therefore, my wife and I, refuse to give the matter our very careful
  consideration. Now I must&mdash;um&mdash;cross-examine you a little. You wish
  to marry my daughter, is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>The Head flung out the question with disconcerting suddenness.</p>

  <p>Speed, momentarily unbalanced, paused, recovered himself, and said wisely:
  "When I can afford to, sir. As soon as I can afford to. You know my salary
  and prospects, sir, and are the best judge of how soon I shall be able to
  give your daughter the comforts to which she has been accustomed."</p>

  <p>"A clever reply, Mr. Speed. Um, yes&mdash;extremely clever. I gather that
  you are quite convinced that you will be happy with my daughter?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite convinced, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then money is the only difficulty. What a troublesome thing money is, Mr.
  Speed!-May I ask you whether you have yet consulted your own parents on the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>"I have not done so yet. I wanted your reply first."</p>

  <p>"I see. And what&mdash;um&mdash;do you anticipate will be <i>their</i>
  reply?"</p>

  <p>Speed was silent for a moment and then said: "I cannot pretend that I
  think they will be enthusiastic. They have never agreed with my actions. But
  they have the sense to realise that I am old enough to do as I choose,
  especially in such a matter as marriage. They certainly wouldn't quarrel With
  me over it."</p>

  <p>The Head stared fixedly at Speed for some while; then, with a soft,
  crooning tone, began to speak. "Well, you know, Mr. Speed, you are very
  young-only twenty-two, I believe."&mdash;(Speed interjected: "Twenty-three
  next month, sir.")&mdash;The Head proceeded: "Twenty-three, then.
  It's&mdash;um&mdash;it's rather young for marriage. However, I am&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;inclined to agree with Professor Potts that one of
  the&mdash;um&mdash;curses of our modern civilisation is that it pushes
  the&mdash;um&mdash;marriageable age too late for the educated man." (And who
  the devil, thought Speed, is Professor Potts?)..."Now it so happens, Mr.
  Speed, that this little problem of ours can be settled in a way which is
  satisfactory to myself and to the school, and which I think will be equally
  satisfactory to yourself and my daughter. I don't know whether you know that
  Lavery leaves this term?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know, sir."</p>

  <p>"He has reached the&mdash;um&mdash;the retiring age. As perhaps you know,
  Mr. Speed, Lavery belonged to the&mdash;um&mdash;old school. In many ways, I
  think, the old methods were best, but, of course, one has to keep up with the
  times. I am quite certain that the Governors will look favourably on a very
  much younger man to be&mdash;um&mdash;Lavery's successor. It would also be an
  advantage if he were married."</p>

  <p>"Married!" echoed Speed.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Married house masters are always preferred...Then, again, Mr. Speed,
  we should want a public-school man...Of course, Lavery's is a large House and
  the position is not one to be&mdash;um&mdash;lightly undertaken. And, of
  course, it is for the Governors to decide, in the last resort. But if you
  think about it, Mr. Speed, and if you favour the idea, it will probably occur
  to you that you stand a rather good chance. Of course it requires thinking
  over a great deal. Urn, yes&mdash;decide nothing in a hurry..."</p>

  <p>Speed's mind, hazily receiving the gist of what the Head was saying, began
  to execute a wild pirouette. He heard the Head's voice droning on, but he did
  not properly hear anything more that was said. He heard in snatches: "Of
  course you would have to take up your new duties in&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;September...And for that purpose, you would get married during the
  vacation...A great chance for your Mr. Speed...the Governors...very greatly
  impressed with you at Speech Day...You would like Lavery's...an excellent
  House...Plenty of time to think it over, you know...Um, yes&mdash;plenty of
  time...When did you say you were going home?"</p>

  <p>Speed recovered himself so far as to answer: "Tuesday, sir."</p>

  <p>"Um, yes&mdash;delightful, that is&mdash;you will be able to dine with us
  to-morrow night then, no doubt?&mdash;Curious place, Millstead, when
  everybody has gone away...Um, yes&mdash;extremely delightful...Think it over
  very carefully, Mr. Speed...we dine at seven-thirty during the vacations,
  remember...Good night, then, Mr. Speed...Um, yes&mdash;Good night!"</p>

  <p>Speed staggered out as if intoxicated.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">That was why, hearing the singing and shouting in the
  dormitories that night, Speed did not interfere. With happiness surging all
  around him how could he have the heart to curtail the happiness of
  others?-About half-past ten he went round distributing journey-money, and to
  each dormitory in turn he said farewell and wished a pleasant vacation. The
  juniors were scampering over one another's beds and pelting one another with
  pillows. Speed said merely: "If I were you fellows I should get to sleep
  pretty soon: Hartopp will ring the bells at six, you know."</p>

  <p>Then he went back into his own room, his room that would not be his any
  more, for next term he would be in Lavery's. Noisy and insincere as had been
  his protestations at the House Dinner about the superiority of School House
  over any other, there was yet a sense in which he felt deeply sorry to leave
  the place where he had been so happy and successful. He looked back in memory
  to that first evening of term, and remembered his first impression of the
  room assigned to him; then it had seemed to him lonely, forlorn, even a
  little dingy. Hardly a trace of that earliest aspect remained with it now. At
  eleven o'clock on the last night of term it glowed with the warmth of a
  friendly heart; it held out loving arms that made Speed, even amidst his joy,
  piteously sorry to leave it. The empty firegrate, in which he had never seen
  a fire, lured him with the vision of all the cosy winter nights that he had
  missed.</p>

  <p>Outside it was moonlight again, as when, a month before, he had waited by
  the pavilion steps on the evening of the Speech Day. From his open
  lattice-window he could see the silver tide lapping against the walls and
  trees, the pale sea of the pitch on which there would be no more cricket, the
  roof and turret of the pavilion gleaming with liquid radiance. I All was soft
  and silent, glossy beneath the high moon. It was as if everything had endured
  agelessly, as if the passing of a term were no more than the half-heard tick
  of a clock in the life of Millstead.</p>

  <p>Leaning out of the window he heard a voice, boyish and sudden, in the
  junior dormitory below.</p>

  <p>"I say, Bennett, are you going by the eight-twenty-two?"</p>

  <p>An answer came indistinguishably, and then the curt command of the prefect
  imposing silence, silence which, reigned over by the moon and the sky of
  stars, lasted through the short summer night until dawn.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-02-01"
     id="ch-02-01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He breakfasted with Helen upon the first morning of the
  winter term, inaptly named because winter does not begin until the term is
  over. They had returned the evening before from a month's holiday in Cornwall
  and now they were making themselves a little self-consciously at home in the
  first-floor rooms that had been assigned to them in Lavery's. The room in
  which they breakfasted overlooked the main quadrangle; the silver coffeepot
  on the table shimmered in the rays of the late summer sun.</p>

  <p>Midway through the meal Burton, the porter at Lavery's, tapped at the door
  and brought in the letters and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Hullo, that's luck!-I was thinking I should have to run down
  the town to get my paper this morning."</p>

  <p>Burton replied, with a hint of reproach in his voice: "No, sir. It was
  sent up from Harrington's as usual, sir. They always begin on the first day
  of term, sir."</p>

  <p>Speed nodded, curiously conscious of a thrill at the mention of the name
  Harrington. Something made him suddenly nervous, so that he said,
  boisterously, as if determined to show Burton at all costs that he was not
  afraid of him: "Oh, by the way, Burton, you might shut that window a little,
  will you?-there's a draught."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Burton, again with a hint of subdued reproachfulness
  in his tone. While he was shutting the window, moving about very softly and
  stealthily himself yet making a tremendous noise with everything that had to
  be done with his large clumsy hands, it was necessary for Speed and Helen to
  converse on casual and ordinary subjects.</p>

  <p>Speed said: "I should think the ground's far too hard for rugger,
  Helen."</p>

  <p>She answered, sombrely: "Yes, I daresay it is. It's really summer still,
  isn't it?&mdash;And I'm so glad. I hate the winters."</p>

  <p>"You hate the winters, eh?&mdash;Why's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's so cold, and the pitches are all muddy, and there are horrid
  locks-up after dark. Oh, I hate Millstead in winter-time."</p>

  <p>He said, musingly: "We must have big fires when the cold weather comes,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>Then Burton departed, closing the door very delicately after him, and the
  conversation languished. Speed glanced vaguely through his correspondence. He
  was ever so slightly nervous. That month's honeymoon in Cornwall had passed
  like a rapt and cloudless vision, but ever beyond the horizon of it had been
  the thought of this return to Millstead for the winter term. How the return
  to a place where he had been so happy and of which he had such wonderful
  memories could have taken in his mind the semblance of an ordeal, was a
  question that baffled him entirely. He felt strangely and unaccountably shy
  of entering the Masters' Common-Room again, of meeting Clanwell and Ransome
  and Pritchard and the rest, of seeing once again all the well-'known faces of
  the boys whose summer vacations had been spent so much less eventfully than
  his. And yet, as he sat at the breakfast-table and saw Helen opposite him, a
  strange warming happiness surged up within him and made him long for the
  initial ordeal to be over so that he could pass on to the pure and wonderful
  life ahead, that life in which Helen and Millstead would reign jointly and
  magnificently. Surely he could call himself blessed with the most amazing
  good fortune, to be happily married at the age of twenty-three and installed
  in just the position which, more than any other in the world, he had always
  coveted!&mdash;Consciousness of his supreme happiness made him quicken with
  the richest and most rapturous enthusiasm; he would, he decided in a sudden
  blinding moment, make Lavery's the finest of all the houses at Millstead; he
  would develop alike the work and the games and the moral tone until the fame
  of Lavery's spread far beyond its local boundaries and actually enhanced the
  reputation of Millstead itself. Such achievements were not, he knew, beyond
  the possibilities of an energetic housemaster, and he, young and full of
  enthusiasms, would be a living fount of energy. All the proud glory of life
  was before him, and in the fullness of that life there was nothing that he
  might not do if he chose.</p>

  <p>All that day he was at the mercy alternately of his tumultuous dreams of
  the future and of a presaging nervousness of the imminent ordeals. In the
  morning he was occupied chiefly with clerical work, but in the afternoon,
  pleading a few errands in town, he took his bicycle out of the shed and
  promised Helen that he would not be gone longer than an hour or so. He felt a
  little sad to leave her, because he knew that with the very least
  encouragement she would have offered to come with him. Somehow, he would not
  have been pleased for her to do that; he felt acutely self-conscious, vaguely
  yet miserably apprehensive of trials, that were in wait for him. In a few
  days, of course, everything would be all right.</p>

  <p>He did not cycle into the town, but along the winding Millstead lane that
  led, away from the houses and into the uplands around Parminters. The sun,
  was glorious and warm, and the trees of that deep and heavy green that had
  not, so far, more than the faintest of autumnal tints in it. Along the lane
  twisting into the cleft of Par-minters, memories assailed him at every yard.
  He had been so happy here&mdash;and here&mdash;and here; here he had laughed
  loudly at something she had said; here she had made one of her childish yet
  incomparably wise remarks. Those old serene days, those splendid flaming
  afternoons of the summer term, had been so sweet and exquisite and I
  fragrantly memorable to him that he could not forbear to wonder if anything
  could ever be so lovely again.</p>

  <p>Deep down beneath all the self-consciousness and apprehension and morbid
  researching of the past, he knew that he was richly and abundantly happy. He
  knew that she was still a child in his own mind; that life with her was
  dream-like as had been the rapt anticipation of it; that the dream, so far
  from marriage dispelling it, was enhanced by all the kindling intimacies that
  swung them both, as it were, into the same ethereal orbit.</p>

  <p>When he thought about it he came to the conclusion that their marriage
  must be the most wonderful marriage in the world. She was a child, a strange,
  winsome fairy-child, streaked with the most fitful and sombre passion that he
  had ever known. Nobody, perhaps, would guess that he and she were man and
  wife. The thought gratified his sense of the singularity of what had
  happened. At the Cornish hotel where they had stayed he had fancied that
  their identity as a honeymoon couple had not been guessed at all; he had
  thought, with many an inward chuckle, that people were supposing them to be
  mysteriously and romantically unwedded.</p>

  <p>Time passed so slowly on that first day of the winter term. He rode back
  at the end of the afternoon with the wind behind him, swinging him in through
  the main gateway where he could see the windows of Lavery's pink in the rays
  of the setting sun. Lavery's!&mdash;Lavery's!&mdash;Throughout the day he had
  found himself repeating the name constantly, until the syllables lost all
  shred of meaning. Lavery's!&mdash;Lav-er-izz...The sounds boomed in his ears
  as he entered the tiny drawing-room in which Helen was waiting for him with
  the tea almost ready. Tea time!&mdash;In a few hours the great machine of
  Millstead would have begun to pound its inexorable way. He felt, listening to
  the chiming of the quarters, as if he were standing in the engine-room of an
  ocean liner, watching the mighty shafts, now silent and motionless, that
  would so soon begin their solemn crashing movement.</p>

  <p>But that evening, about eleven o'clock, all his fears and shynesses were
  over, and he felt the most deeply contented man in the world. A fire was
  flickering a cheerful glow over the tiny drawing-room; Helen had complained
  of chilliness so he had told Burton to light it. He was glad now that this
  had been done, for it enabled him to grapple with his dreams more
  comfortably. Helen sat in an armchair opposite to him on the other side of
  the fire; she was leaning forward with her head on her hands, so that the
  firelight shone wonderfully on her hair. He looked at her from time to time,
  magnificently in love with her, and always amazed that she belonged to
  him.</p>

  <p>The long day of ordeals had passed by. He had dined that evening in the
  Masters' Common-Room, and everybody there had pressed round him in a chorus
  of eager congratulation. Afterwards he had toured his House, introducing
  himself to those of the prefects whom he had not already met, and strolling
  round the dormitories to shake hands informally with the rank and file. Then
  he had interviewed new boys (there were nineteen of them), and had
  distributed a few words of pastoral advice, concluding with the strict
  injunction that if they made tea in the basements they were on no account to
  throw the slops down the waste-pipes of the baths. Lastly of all, he had put
  his head inside each of the dormitories, at about half-past ten, to bestow a
  brisk but genial good night.</p>

  <p>So now, at eleven o'clock, rooted at last in everything that he most loved
  in the world, he could pause to gloat over his happiness. Here, in the snug
  firelit room, secret and rich with warm shadows; and there, down the short
  corridor into the bleak emptiness of the classrooms, was everything that his
  heart desired: Helen and Millstead: the two deities that held passionate sway
  over him.&mdash;Eleven began to chime on the school clock. The dormitories
  above were almost silent. She did not I speak, did not look up once from the
  redness of the fire; she was often like that, silent with thoughts whose
  nature he could guess from the dark, tossing passion that shook her sometimes
  when, in the midst of such silences, she suddenly clung to him. She loved him
  more than ever he could have imagined: that, more perhaps than anything else,
  had been the surprise of that month in Cornwall.</p>

  <p>"Eleven," he said, breaking the rapt silence.</p>

  <p>She said, half humorously, half sadly: "Are you pleased with me?&mdash;Are
  you satisfied?&mdash;Do I quite come up to expectations?"</p>

  <p>He started, looked towards her, and laughed. The laugh disturbed the
  silence of the room like the intrusion of something from millions of miles
  away. He made a humorous pretence of puzzling it out, as if it were a
  baffling problem, and said, finally, with mocking doubtfulness: "Well, on the
  whole, I think you do."</p>

  <p>"If I had been on trial for a month you'd still keep me, then?" she went
  on, without moving her head out of her hands.</p>

  <p>He answered, in the same vein as before: "If you could guarantee always to
  remain up to sample, I dare-say I would."</p>

  <p>She raised her head and gave him such a look as, if he had not learned to
  know it, would have made him think she was angry with him; it was sharp with
  bladelike eagerness, as if she were piercing through his attitude of
  jocularity.</p>

  <p>Then, wondering why she did not smile when he was smiling, he put his arm
  round her and drew her burning lips to his. "Bedtime," he said gaily, "for
  we've got to be up early in the morning."</p>

  <p>Over about them as they clung together the spirit of Millstead, like a
  watchful friend, came suddenly close and intimate, and to Speed, opening his
  soul to it joyously, it appeared in the likeness of a golden-haired child,
  shy yet sombrely passionate&mdash;a wraith of a child that was just like
  Helen. Above all, they loved each other, these two, with a love that
  surrounded and enveloped all things in a magic haze: they were the perfect
  lovers. And over them the real corporeal Millstead brooded in constant
  magnificent calm.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Soon he was swallowed up in the joyous routine of term-
  time. He had never imagined that a housemaster had such a large amount of
  work to do. There were no early-morning forms during the winter term,
  however, and as also it was a housemaster's privilege to breakfast in his own
  rooms, Speed began the day with a happy three-quarters of an hour of
  newspaper-scanning, envelope-tearing, and chatting with Helen. After
  breakfast work began in earnest. Before term had lasted a week he discovered
  that he had at least twice as many duties as in the preceding term; the Head
  was certainly not intending to let him slack. There was the drawing and music
  of the whole school to superintend, as well as the choir and chapel-services
  which, as the once-famous Raggs became more and more decrepit, fell into
  Speed's direction almost automatically. Then also there were a large number
  of miscellaneous supervisory duties which the housemasters shared-between
  them, and one or two, at least, which tradition decreed should be performed
  entirely by the junior housemaster. The result of it all was that Speed was,
  if he had been in the mood to desire a statutory eight hours' day,
  considerably overworked.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that the work was what he loved. He plunged into it with
  terrific zest. Lavery's was a large House, and Lavery himself had judged all
  its institutions by the test of whether or not they conduced to an economy in
  work for him. The result was an institution that managed itself with
  rough-and-ready efficiency, that offered no glaring scandal to the intrusive
  eye, yet was, in truth, honeycombed with corruption of a mild sort, and
  completely under the sway of powerfully vested interests. Against this and
  these Speed set himself out to do final battle. A prudent housemaster, and
  certainly one who valued his own personal comfort, would have postponed the
  contest, at any rate, until he had become settled in his position. But Speed,
  emboldened by the extraordinary success of his first term, and lured by his
  own dreams of a Lavery's that should be <i>the</i> great House at Millstead,
  would not delay. In his first week he found five of the prefects enjoying a
  pleasant little smoking-party in the Senior prefect's study.</p>

  <p>They explained to him that Lavery had never objected to their smoking,
  provided they did it unostentatiously, and that Lavery never dreamed of
  "barging in upon them" during their evening study-hours. Speed, stung by
  their slightly insolent bearing, barked at them in his characteristic
  staccato voice when annoyed: "It doesn't matter to me a bit what Lavery used
  to let you do. You've got to obey me now, not Lavery. Prefects must set the
  example to the others. I shall ask for an undertaking from all of you that
  you don't smoke again during term-time. I'll give you till to-morrow night to
  decide. Those who refuse will be degraded from prefecture."</p>

  <p>"You can't degrade without the Head's authority," said Smallwood, the most
  insolent of the party.</p>

  <p>Speed replied, colouring suddenly (for he realised that Smallwood had
  spoken the truth): "I know my own business, thank you, Smallwood."</p>

  <p>During the following twenty-four hours four out of the half-dozen
  House-prefects gave the required undertaking. The other two, Smallwood and a
  fellow named Biffin, refused, "on principle," as they said, without
  explaining what exactly the qualification meant. Speed went promptly to the
  Head and appealed for authority to degrade them. He found that they had
  already poured their tale into the Head's receptive ears, and that they had
  given the Head the impression that he (Speed) in a tactless excess of
  reforming zeal, had been listening at keyholes and prying around the
  study-doors at night. The Head, after listening to Speed's indignant protest,
  replied, suavely: "I think, Mr. Speed"&mdash;(Speed's relationship as
  son-in-law never tempted either of them to any intimacy of address)&mdash;"I
  think you must&mdash;um, yes&mdash;make some allowance for
  the&mdash;um&mdash;the natural inclination of elder boys to&mdash;um&mdash;to
  be jealous of privileges. Smoking is, of course, an&mdash;um, yes&mdash;an
  offence against school rules, but Mr. Lavery was perhaps&mdash;um, yes,
  perhaps&mdash;wise in turning the&mdash;um&mdash;the blind eye, when the
  offender was near the top of the school and where the offence was not
  flagrant. You must remember, Mr. Speed, that Smallwood is eighteen years of
  age, not so very many years younger than you are yourself. Besides, he
  is&mdash;um, yes, I think so&mdash;captain of the First Fifteen, is he
  not?&mdash;and I&mdash;um&mdash;I assure you&mdash;his degradation through
  you would do you an&mdash;um&mdash;an incalculable amount of harm in the
  school. Don't make yourself unpopular, Mr. Speed. I will send a note round
  the school, prefects&mdash;um, yes&mdash;included,
  drawing&mdash;um&mdash;attention to the school rule against smoking. And I
  will talk to Smallwood and the other boy&mdash;Biffin, isn't he?&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;privately. Privately, you see&mdash;a quiet friendly conversation
  in&mdash;um&mdash;in private, can achieve wonders."</p>

  <p>Speed felt that he was being ever so gently snubbed.</p>

  <p>He left the Head's study in a state of subdued fury, and his temper was
  not improved when Helen seemed rather thoughtlessly inclined to take
  Smallwood's side. "Don't get people into trouble, Kenneth," she pleaded. "I
  don't think you ought to complain to father about them. After all, it isn't
  frightfully wicked to smoke, is it? and I know they all used to do it in
  Lavery's time. Why, I've seen them many a time when I've passed the
  study-windows in the evenings."</p>

  <p>He stared at her for a few seconds, half indignantly half incredulously:
  then, as if on sudden impulse, he smiled, and placed his hands on her
  shoulders and looked searchingly into her eyes. "Soft-hearted little kid!" he
  exclaimed, laughing a slightly forced laugh. "All the same, I don't think you
  quite understand my position, dear."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it then," she said.</p>

  <p>Perhaps instinct forewarned him that if he went into details, either his
  indignation would break its bounds or else she would make some further casual
  and infuriating comment. From both possibilities he shrank nervously. He
  said, with an affectation of nonchalance: "Oh, never mind about it, dear. It
  will all come right in the end. Don't you worry your pretty head about it.
  Kiss me!"</p>

  <p>She kissed him passionately.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">But Speed was still, in the main, happy, despite occasional
  worries. There was a wonderful half-sad charm about those fading autumn
  afternoons, each one more eager to dissolve into the twilight, each one more
  thickly spread with the brown and yellow leaves. To Speed, who remembered so
  well the summer term, the winter term seemed full of poignancies and regrets.
  And yet surrounding it all, this strange atmosphere which for want of a
  better designation must be called simply Millstead, was no less apparent; it
  pervaded all those&mdash;autumn days with a subtle essence which made Speed
  feel that this life that he was living would be impossible to forget, no
  matter what the world held in store for him. He could never forget the
  clammy, earthy smell of the rugger pitch after a match in rain; the steam
  rising from the heavy scrum; the grey clouds rolling over the sky; the patter
  of rain-drops on the corrugated-iron roof of the pavilion stand. Nor could
  anything efface the memory of those grey twilights when the afternoon games
  were finished; the crowded lamp-lit tuck-shop, a phantasy of chromatic
  blazers and pots of jam and muddy knees; the basements, cloudy with steam
  from the bathrooms; the bleak shivering corridors along which the Juniors
  scampered and envied the cosy warmth of the studies which might one day be
  their own. Even the lock-ups after dark held some strange and secret comfort:
  Burton and his huge keys and his noisy banging of the door were part of the
  curious witchery of it all.</p>

  <p>And then at night-time when the sky was black as jet and the wind from the
  fenlands howled round the tall chimney-stacks of Lavery's, Speed could feel
  more than ever the bigness of this thing of which he had become a part. The
  very days and nights took on characters and individualities of their own;
  Speed could, if he had thought, have given them all an identifying sound and
  colour: Monday, for instance, was brown, deepening to crimson as night fell:
  he was always reminded of it by the chord of E flat on the piano. That, of
  course, was perhaps no more than half-imagined idiosyncrasy. But it was
  certain that the days and nights were all shaped and conditioned by
  Millstead; and that they were totally different from the days and nights that
  were elsewhere in the world. On Sunday nights, for instance, Speed, observing
  a Lavery's custom to which he saw no objection, read for an hour to the
  Junior dormitory. The book was Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Speed had never heard
  of the book until the Juniors informed him that Mr. Lavery had got half-way
  through it during the previous term. After about three successive readings
  Speed decided that the book was too horrible to be read to Juniors just
  before bedtime, and accordingly refused to go on with it. "I shall put it in
  the House library," he said, "so if any of you wish to finish it you can do
  so in the daytime. And now we'll try something else. Can anybody suggest
  anything?" Somebody mentioned Stephen Leacock, and in future, Sunday evenings
  in the Junior dormitory at Lavery's were punctuated by roars of laughter. All
  the same, the sudden curtailment of <i>Dracula</i> was, for a long while, a
  sore point with the Juniors.</p>

  <p>On the two half-holidays, Wednesdays and Saturdays, Speed had three or
  four of his House in to tea, taking them in rotation. This was a custom which
  Lavery, seeing in it no more than an unnecessary increase in his duties and
  obligations, had allowed to fall into disuse. Nor were the majority of the
  boys keen on Speed's resumption of what had been, more often than not, an
  irksome social infliction. They were, however, gratified by the evident
  interest that he took in them, and most of them, when they thankfully escaped
  from the ordeal back to their fellows in the Common-Room, admitted that he
  was "quite a decent sort of chap." Speed believed in the personal
  relationship between each boy and his housemaster with an almost fanatical
  zeal. He found out what each boy was interested in, and, without prying into
  anybody's private affairs, contrived to establish himself as a personal
  factor in the life of the House and not as a vague and slatternly deity such
  as Lavery had been. Four o'clock therefore, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, saw
  Speed's tiny drawing-room littered with cakes and toasted scones, and
  populated by three or four nervous youngsters trying desperately to respond
  to Speed's geniality and to balance cups and saucers and plates on their
  knees without upsetting anything.</p>

  <p>It was part of Speed's dream of the ideal housemaster and his ideal House
  that the housemaster's wife should fulfil a certain difficult and
  scrupulously exact function in the scheme of things. She must not, of course,
  attempt any motherly intimacies, or call people by their Christian names, or
  do anything else that was silly or effusive; yet, on the other hand, there
  was a sense in which her relationship with the boys, especially the Juniors,
  might be less formal than her husband's. And, somehow, Speed was forced to
  admit that Helen did not achieve this extraordinarily delicate equipoise. She
  was, he came to the conclusion, too young for it to be possible. When she
  grew older, no doubt she would, in that particular respect, improve, but for
  the present she was, perhaps naturally, nervous in the presence of the elder
  boys and apt to treat the Juniors as if they were babies. Gradually she
  formed the habit of going over to the Head's house for tea whenever Speed
  entertained the boys in his room; it was an arrangement which, accomplished
  silently and without definition, Speed felt to be rather a wise one.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Clare Harrington had left Millstead. One breakfast time a
  letter came from her with the Paris postmark. Out of the envelope tumbled a
  number of small snapshots; Speed scanned the letter through and remarked,
  summing up its contents roughly for Helen's benefit: "Oh, Clare's in France.
  Been having rather a good time, I should imagine&mdash;touring about, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Helen looked up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know she wrote to <i>you</i>," she said.</p>

  <p>Speed answered, casually: "She doesn't, as a rule. But she knows I'm
  interested in architecture&mdash;I expect that's why she sent me all these
  snaps. There's one here of..." he picked them up and glanced through
  them..."of Chartres Cathedral...the belfry at Bruges...some street in
  Rouen...They're rather good&mdash;have a look at them!"</p>

  <p>She examined them at first suspiciously, then with critical intensity. And
  finally she handed them back to him without remark.</p>

     id="ch-02-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">One dark dusk in November that was full of wind and fine
  rain Speed stood up at his drawing-room window to pull down the blind. But
  before doing so he gazed out at the dreary twilight and saw the bare trees
  black and terrible beyond the quadrangle and the winking lights of Milner's
  across the way. He had seen all of it so many times before, had lived amongst
  it, so it now seemed to him, for ages; yet to-night there was something in it
  that he had never seen before: a sort of sadness that was abroad in the
  world. He heard the wind screaming through the sodden trees and the branches
  creaking, the raindrops splashing on the ivy underneath the window: it seemed
  to him that Millstead was full that night of beautiful sorrow, and that it
  came over the dark quadrangle to him with open arms, drenching all Lavery's
  in wild and forlorn pathos.</p>

  <p>He let the blind fall gently in front of his rapt eyes while the yellow
  lamplight took on a richer, serener tinge. Those few weeks of occupation had
  made the room quite different; its walls were now crowded with prints and
  etchings; there was a sideboard, dull-glowing and huge for the size of the
  room, on which silver and pewter and cut glass glinted in tranquillity.
  Across one corner, a baby-grand piano sprawled its sleek body like a drowsily
  basking sea-lion, and opposite, in the wall at right angles to the window, a
  large fire lulled itself into red contentment with flames that had hardly
  breath for an instant's flicker. But Speed left the window and stirred the
  coals into yellow riot that lit his face with tingling, delicious half-tones.
  In the firelight he seemed very tall and young-looking, with dark-brown,
  straggling hair, brown, eager eyes that were almost black, and a queer,
  sad-lipped mouth that looked for the present as if it would laugh and cry in
  the same way. A leather-seated stool stood by the fireside, and he dragged it
  in front of the open flames and sat with his chin resting solemnly on his
  slim, long-fingered hands.</p>

  <p>It was a Wednesday and Helen had gone with her mother to visit some
  friends in the town and would not be back until, perhaps, dinner-time. It was
  almost four o'clock, and that hour, or at any rate, a few seconds or minutes
  afterwards, three youngsters would be coming to tea. Their names were
  Felling, Fyfield, and Graham. All were Juniors, as it happened, and they
  would be frightfully nervous, and assuredly would not know when to
  depart.</p>

  <p>Speed, liking them well enough, but feeling morbid for some reason or
  other, pictured them plastering their hair down and scrambling into their
  Sunday jackets in readiness for the ordeal. Poor little kids! he thought, and
  he almost longed to rush into the cold dormitories where they were preparing
  themselves and say: "Look here, Felling, Fyfield and Graham&mdash;you needn't
  come to tea with me this afternoon&mdash;you're excused!"</p>

  <p>The hour of four boomed into the wind and rain outside. Speed looked round
  to see if Burton had set the correct number of cups, saucers and plates, and
  had obtained a sufficient quantity of cake and fancy pastry from the
  tuck-shop. After all, he ought to offer them some compensation for having to
  come to tea with him.</p>

  <p>Tap at the door. "Come in...Ah, that you, Felling...and you, Graham...I
  expect Fyfield will be here in a minute...Sit down, will you?...Take that
  easy-chair, Felling...Isn't it depressing weather?...I suppose you saw the
  game against Oversham? That last try of Marshall's was a particularly fine
  one, I thought...Come in...Ah, here you are, Fyfield: now we can get busy
  with the tea, can't we?...How's the Junior Debating Society going, Fyfield?"
  (Fyfield was secretary of it.) "I must come round to one of your meetings, if
  you'll promise to do exactly as you would if I weren't there...Come in...You
  might bring me some more hot water, Burton...By the way, Graham,
  congratulations on last Saturday's match: I didn't see it, but I'm told you
  did rather well."</p>

  <p>And so on. They were nice boys, all three of them, but they were nervous.
  They answered in monosyllables or else embarked upon tortuous sentences which
  became finally embedded in meringues and chocolate <i>éclairs</i>. Felling,
  in particular, was overawed, for he was a new boy that term and had only just
  emerged from six weeks in the sanatorium with whooping-cough. Virtually, this
  was his first week at school.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the ponderously jocular, artificially sustained
  conversation a knock came on the door. Speed shouted out "Come in," as usual.
  The door opened and somebody came in. Speed could not see who it was. He
  thought it must be a boy and turned back the red lampshade so that the rays,
  nakedly yellow, glanced upwards. Then he saw Clare.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">She was dressed in a long flowing mackintosh which had
  something in it reminiscent still of the swirl of wind and rain. She came
  forward very simply, held out her hand to Speed, and said: "How are you, Mr.
  Speed? I thought perhaps I should find Helen in."</p>

  <p>He said, overmastering his astonishment: "Helen's out somewhere with Mrs.
  Ervine...I'm quite well. How&mdash;how are you?"</p>

  <p>"Quite as well as you are," she said, laughing. "Tell Helen I'll call
  round some other time, then, will you?&mdash;I mustn't interrupt your
  tea-party."</p>

  <p>That made him say: "Indeed you're not doing that at all. Won't you stay
  and have a cup of tea? Surely you won't go back into the rain so soon! Let me
  introduce you&mdash;this is Felling...Miss Harrington...and this is
  Fyfield...and Graham..."</p>

  <p>What on earth had made him do that? He wondered, as he saw the boys
  shaking hands with her so stiffly and nervously; what was possessing him?
  Yet, accepting his invitation calmly and decisively, she sat down in the
  midst of them as soon as she had taken off her wet mackintosh, and appeared
  perfectly comfortable and at home. Speed busied himself in obtaining a cup of
  tea for her, and by the time he had at last succeeded he heard her talking in
  the most amazing way to Graham, and, which was more, Graham was answering her
  as if they had known each other for weeks. She had somehow found out that
  Graham's home was in Perth, and they were indulging in an eager, if rather
  vacuous, exchange of "Do-you-know's." Then quite suddenly she was managing to
  include Fyfield in the conversation, and in a little while after that Felling
  demonstrated both his present cordiality and his former absent-mindedness by
  calling her "Mrs. Speed." She said, with perfect calmness and without so much
  as the faintest suggestion in her voice of any but the mere literal meaning
  of her words: "I'm not Mrs. Speed; I'm Miss Harrington."</p>

  <p>Speed had hardly anything to do with the talk at all. He kept supplying
  the participators with fuel in the way of cakes and <i>éclairs</i>, but he
  was content to leave the rest of the management in Clare's hands. She paid
  little attention to him, reserving most of her conversation for the three
  boys. The chatter developed into a gossip that was easy, yet perfectly
  respectful; Speed, putting in his word or two occasionally, was astonished at
  the miracle that was being performed under his eyes. Who could have believed
  that Felling, Fyfield and Graham could ever be induced to talk like that in
  their house-master's drawing-room? Of course, a man couldn't do it at all, he
  thought, in self-defence: it was a woman's miracle entirely.</p>

  <p>The school-clock began the chime of five, and five was the hour when it
  was generally considered that housemasterly teas were due to finish. Speed
  waited till ten minutes past and then interjected during a pause in the
  conversation: "Well, I'm sorry you can't stay any longer..."</p>

  <p>The three boys rose, thankful for the hint although the affair had turned
  out to be not quite such an ordeal as they had expected. After hand-shaking
  with Clare they backed awkwardly out of the room followed by Speed's brisk
  "Good night."</p>

  <p>When they had gone Clare cried, laughing: "Oh, fancy getting rid of them
  like that, Mr. Speed!&mdash;I should be insulted if you tried it on with
  me."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "It's the best way with boys, Miss Harrington. They don't like
  to say they must go themselves, and they'd feel hurt if you told them to go
  outright. Really they're immensely grateful for a plain hint."</p>

  <p>Now that he was alone in the room with her he began to feel nervous in a
  very peculiar and exciting way; as if something unimaginably strange were
  surely going to happen. Outside, the wind and rain seemed suddenly to grow
  loud, louder, terrifically loud; a strong whiff of air came down the chimney
  and blew smoke into the room. All around, everywhere, there were noises,
  clumping of feet on the floor above, chatter and shouting in the corridors,
  the distant jangle of pianos in the practice-rooms; and yet, in a deep
  significant sense, it was as if he and Clare were quite alone amidst the wind
  and rain. He poked the fire with a gesture that was almost irritable; the
  flames prodded into the red-tinted gloom and revealed Clare perfectly serene
  and imperturbable. Evidently nothing was going to happen at all. He looked at
  her with keen quickness, thinking amazedly: And, by the way, what
  <i>could</i> have happened?</p>

  <p>"How is Helen?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He answered: "Oh, she's quite well. Very well, in fact."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you are, also."</p>

  <p>"I look it, don't I?"</p>

  <p>She said, after a pause: "And quite happy, of course."</p>

  <p>He started, kicked the fender with a clatter that, for the moment,
  frightened him, and exclaimed: "Happy! Did you mean am <i>I</i> happy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He did not answer immediately. He gave the question careful and scrupulous
  weighing-up. He thought deliberately and calculatingly of Helen, pictured her
  in his mind, saw her sitting opposite to him in the chair where Felling had
  sat, saw her and her hair lit with the glow of the fire, her blue eyes
  sparkling; then, for a while, he listened to her, heard her rich, sombre
  whisper piercing the gloom; lastly, as if sight and hearing were not evidence
  enough, he brought her close to him, so that his hands could touch her. He
  said then, with deep certainty: "Yes, I'm happy."</p>

  <p>"That's fine," she replied. "Now tell me how you're getting on with
  Lavery's?"</p>

  <p>He chatted to her for a while about the House, communicating to her
  something of his enthusiasm but not touching upon any of his difficulties.
  Then he asked her what she had been doing in France. She replied: "Combining
  business with pleasure."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, first of all I bought back from my father's publishers all
  transcription rights. (They'd never used them themselves.) Then, with the
  help of a French friend, I translated one or two of the Helping-Hand-Books
  into French and placed them with a Paris agent. Business, you see. He
  disposed of them fairly advantageously, and on part of the proceeds I treated
  myself to a holiday. I had an excellent time. Now I've come back to Millstead
  to translate a few more of my father's books."</p>

  <p>"But you're continuing to run the shop, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I've brought over my French friend to do that for me. She's a clever girl
  with plenty of brains and no money. She speaks English perfectly. In the
  daytime she'll do most of the shop-work for me and she'll always be handy to
  help me with translations. You must meet her&mdash;you'll find her most
  outrageously un-English."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that she's not sentimental."</p>

  <p>By the time that he had digested that a tap came at the door.</p>

  <p>"That's Helen!" said Speed, joyously, recognising the quiet double rap. He
  felt delightfully eager to see the meeting of the two friends. Helen entered.
  Clare rose. Speed cried, like an excited youngster: "Helen, we've got a
  visitor. Who do you think it is?"</p>

  <p>Helen replied, puzzled: "I don't know. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"Clare!" he cried, with boisterous enthusiasm. "It's Clare!"</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that he had never called her Clare before; always it
  had been Miss Harrington. And yet the name had come so easily and
  effortlessly to his tongue!</p>

  <p>Helen gasped: "Clare! Is it you, Clare?"</p>

  <p>And Clare advanced through the shadows and kissed Helen very simply and
  quietly. Again Speed felt that strange, presaging emotion of something about
  to happen, of some train being laid for the future. The rain was now a
  torrent, and the wind a great gale shrieking across the fenlands.</p>

  <p>Helen said: "I'm drenched with rain&mdash;let me take my coat off." After
  a short pause she added: "Why didn't you let me know you were coming, Clare?
  If you had I could have stayed in for you."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Speed was always inclined to drop out of conversations that
  were proceeding well enough without him. In a few moments Helen and Clare
  were chatting together exactly as if he had not been present. He did not
  mind; he was rather glad, in fact, because it relieved him from the task of
  mastering his nervousness. He felt too, what he always felt when Helen was
  talking to another woman; a feeling that women as a sex were hostile to men,
  and that when they were together there was a sort of secret freemasonry
  between them which enforced a rigid and almost contemptuous attitude towards
  the other sex. Nothing in Clare's manner encouraged this belief, but Helen's
  side of the conversation was a distinct suggestion of it. Not that anything
  said or discussed was inimical to him; merely that whenever the conversation
  came near to a point at which he might naturally have begun to take part in
  it, Helen seemed somehow to get hold of it by the neck and pull it out of his
  reach. And Clare was quite impassive, allowing Helen to do just what she
  liked. These were Speed's perhaps exaggerated impressions as he sat very
  uncomfortably in the armchair, almost frightened to move lest movement on his
  part might be wrongly interpreted as irritation, fear, or boredom. When he
  felt uncomfortable his discomfort was always added to by a usually groundless
  fear that other people were noticing it and speculating as to its reason.</p>

  <p>At six the bell rang for school tea in the dining-hall, and this was his
  week to superintend that function. Most mercifully then he was permitted to
  leave the red-glowing drawing-room and scamper across the rain-swept
  quadrangle. "Sorry I must leave you," he said, hastily, rising from his
  chair. Helen said, as if her confirmation were essential before his words
  could be believed: "It's his week for reading grace, you know."</p>

  <p>"And after that I've got some youngsters with piano-lessons," he said,
  snatching up his gown and, in his nervousness, putting it on wrong side out.
  "So I'll say good-bye, Miss Harrington."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with her and escaped into the cold rain. It was over a
  hundred yards to the dining-hall, and with the rain slanting down in
  torrential gusts he was almost drenched during the few seconds' run. Somehow,
  the bare, bleak dining-hall, draughty and fireless and lit with flaring
  gas-jets, seemed to him exhilaratingly cheerful as he gazed down upon it from
  the Master's rostrum at the end. He leaned his arms over the edge of the
  lectern, watching the boys as they streamed in noisily, with muddy boots and
  turned-up collars and wet ruddy cheeks. The long tables, loaded with smeared
  jam-pots and towers of bread-slices and tins of fruit jaggedly opened,
  seemed, in their teeming, careless ugliness, immensely real and joyous: there
  was a simplicity too, an almost mathematical simplicity, in the photographs
  of all the rugger fifteens and cricket and hockey elevens that adorned the
  green-distempered walls. The photographs were complete for the last
  thirty-eight years; therefore there would be four hundred and eighteen plus
  four hundred and eighteen plus five hundred and seventy separate faces upon
  the walls. Total: one thousand four hundred and six...Speed never thought of
  it except when he stood on the rostrum waiting to read grace, and as he was
  not good at mental arithmetic he always had a misgiving that he had
  calculated wrongly, and so would go over it again multiplying with his brain
  while his eyes were on the clock. And this evening his mind, once enslaved by
  the numerical fascination of the photographs, obtained no release until a
  stamping of feet at the far end of the hall awakened him to the realisation
  that it was time he said grace. He had been dreaming. Silly of him to stand
  there on the rostrum openly and obviously dreaming before the eyes of all
  Millstead! He blushed slightly, smiled more slightly still, and gave the knob
  of the hand-bell a vigorous punch. Clatter of forms and shuffling of feet as
  all Millstead rose..."For these and all His Mercies the Lord's name we
  praise..." About the utterance of the word "mercies," conversation,
  prohibited before grace, began to murmur from one end of the room to the
  other; the final "praise," hardly audible even to Speed himself, was engulfed
  in a mighty swelling of hundreds of unleashed voices, clumping of feet,
  clattering of forms, banging of plates, shrill appeals for one thing and
  another, and general pandemonium amidst which, Speed, picking his way amongst
  the groups of servants, made his escape.</p>

  <p>How strange was Millstead to-night, he thought, as he made his way along
  the covered cloisters to the music-rooms. The rain had slackened somewhat,
  but the wind was still high and shrieking; the floor of the cloisters, wet
  from hundreds of muddy boots, shone greasily in the rays of the wind-blown
  lamps. Over the darkness of the quadrangle he could see Lavery's rising like
  a tall cliff at the other side of an ocean; and the dull red square that was
  the window of his own drawing-room. Had Clare gone?&mdash;Clare! It was
  unfortunate, perhaps, that he had called her Clare in his excitement;
  unfortunate because she might think he had done it deliberately with a view
  to deepening the nature of their friendship. That was his only reason for
  thinking it unfortunate.</p>

  <p>Down in the dark vaults beneath the Big Hall, wherein the piano-rooms were
  situated, he found Porritt Secundus waiting for him. Porritt was in Lavery's,
  and therefore Speed was more than ordinarily interested in him.</p>

  <p>"Do you have to miss your tea in order to have a lesson at this hour?"
  Speed asked, putting his hand in a friendly way on Porritt's shoulder, as he
  guided him through the gloomy corridor into the single room where a small
  light was showing.</p>

  <p>Porritt replied: "I didn't to-day, sir. Smallwood asked me to tea with
  him."</p>

  <p>Speed's hand dropped from Porritt's shoulder as if it had been shot away.
  His imagination, fanned into sudden perceptivity, detected in the boy's voice
  a touch of&mdash;of what? Impertinence? Hardly, and yet surely a boy could be
  impertinent without saying anything that was in itself impertinent...Porritt
  had been to tea with Smallwood. And Smallwood was Speed's inveterate enemy,
  as the latter well knew. Was it possible that Smallwood was adopting a
  methodical policy of setting the Juniors against him? Possibilities invaded
  Speed's mind in a scorching torrent. Moments afterwards, when he had regained
  composure, it occurred to him that it was the habit of prefects to invite
  their Juniors to tea occasionally, and that it was perfectly natural that
  Porritt, so recently the guest of the Olympian Smallwood, should be eager to
  tell people about it.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">That night, sitting by the fire before bedtime, Helen said:
  "Was Clare here a long time before I came in?"</p>

  <p>Speed answered: "Not very long. She came while I was having three Juniors
  to tea, and they stayed until after five...After they'd gone she told me
  about her holiday in France."</p>

  <p>"She's been bargaining over her father's books in Paris, so she says."</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that. You see, Mr. Harrington's publishers never
  arranged for his books to be translated, so she bought the rights off them so
  as to be able to arrange it herself."</p>

  <p>"I think it's rather mean to go haggling about that sort of thing after
  the man's dead, don't you? After all, if he'd wanted them to be translated,
  surely he'd have done it himself while he was alive&mdash;don't you think so?
  Clare seems to be out to make as much money as she can without any thought
  about what would have been her father's wishes."</p>

  <p>"I confess," replied Speed, slowly, "that it never struck me in that
  light. Harrington had about as much business in him as a two-year-old, and if
  he let himself be swindled right and left, surely that's no reason why his
  daughter should continue in the same way. Besides, she hasn't much money and
  it couldn't have been her father's wish that she should neglect chances of
  getting some."</p>

  <p>"She has the shop."</p>

  <p>"It can't be very profitable."</p>

  <p>"I daresay it won't allow her to take holidays abroad, but that's not to
  say it won't give her a decent living."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Speed, mildly, "I really don't know anything about her
  private affairs. You may be right in everything you say...It's nearly eleven.
  Shall we go to bed?"</p>

  <p>"Soon," she said, broodingly, gazing into the fire. She was silent for a
  moment, and then said, slowly and deliberately: "Kenneth."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't think I&mdash;I quite like
  Clare&mdash;as much as I used to."</p>

  <p>"You don't, Helen? Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why not. But it's true...She&mdash;she makes me feel
  frightened&mdash;somehow. I hope she doesn't come here often. I&mdash;I don't
  think I shall ask her to. Do you&mdash;do you mind?"</p>

  <p>"Mind, Helen? Why should I mind? If she frightens you she certainly shan't
  come again." He added, with a fierceness which, somehow, did not strike him
  as absurd: "I won't let her. Helen&mdash;dear Helen, you're unhappy about
  something&mdash;tell me all about it?"</p>

  <p>She cried vehemently: "Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!&mdash;Kenneth,
  I want to learn things&mdash;will you teach me?&mdash;I'm a ridiculously
  ignorant person, Kenneth, and some day I shall make you feel ashamed of me if
  I don't learn a few things more. <i>Will</i> you teach me?"</p>

  <p>"My darling, I'll teach you everything in the world. What shall we begin
  with?"</p>

  <p>"Geography. I was looking through some of the exercise-books you had to
  mark. Do you know, I don't know anything about exports and imports?"</p>

  <p>"Neither did I until I had them to teach."</p>

  <p>"And you'll teach me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll teach you anything you want to learn. But I don't think we'll
  have our first lesson until to-morrow. Bedtime now, Helen."</p>

  <p>She flung her arms round his neck passionately, offered her lips to his
  almost with abandonment, and cried, in the low, thrilling voice that seemed
  so full of unspoken dreads and secrecies: "Oh,
  Kenneth&mdash;Kenneth&mdash;you <i>do</i> love me, don't you? You aren't
  tired of me? You aren't even a little bit dlssatisfied, are you?"</p>

  <p>He took her in his arms and kissed her more passionately than he had ever
  done before. It seemed to him then that he did love her, more deeply than
  anybody had loved anybody else since the world began, and that, so far from
  his being the least bit dissatisfied with her, she was still guiding him into
  fresh avenues of unexplored delight. She was the loveliest and most delicate
  thing in the world.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">The great event of the winter term was the concert in aid of
  the local hospitals. It had taken place so many years in succession that it
  had become institutional and thoroughly enmeshed in Millstead tradition. It
  was held during the last week of the term in the Big Hall; the boys paid
  half-a-crown each for admission (the sum was included in their terminal
  bills), and outsiders, for whom there was a limited amount of accommodation,
  five shillings. The sum was artfully designed to exclude shop assistants and
  such-like from a function which was intended to be, in the strictest sense,
  exclusive. Millstead, on this solemn annual occasion, arrayed itself for its
  own pleasure and satisfaction; took a look at itself, so to say, in order to
  reassure itself that another year of social perturbation had mercifully left
  it entire. And by Millstead is meant, in the first instance, the School. The
  Masters, for once, discarded their gowns and mortarboards and appeared in
  resplendent evening-suits which, in some cases, were not used at all during
  the rest of the year. Masters, retired and of immense age, rumbled up to the
  main gateway in funereal four-wheelers and tottered to their seats beneath
  the curious eyes of an age that knew them not. The wives of non-resident
  Masters, like deep-sea fishes that rarely come to the surface, blinked their
  pleased astonishment at finding everything, apparently, different from what
  they had been led to expect. And certain half-mythical inhabitants of the
  neighbourhood, doctors and colonels and captains and landed gentry, parked
  themselves in the few front rows like curious social specimens on exhibition.
  In every way the winter term concert at Millstead was a great affair,
  rivalling in splendour even, the concentrated festivities of Speech Day.</p>

  <p>Speed, in virtue of his position as music-master, found himself involved
  in the scurry and turmoil of preparation. This concert, he decided, with his
  customary enthusiasm, should be the best one that Millstead had had for many
  a year. He would have introduced into it all sorts of innovations had he not
  found, very soon after he began to try, that mysteriously rigid traditions
  stood in the way. He was compelled, for instance, to open with the Millstead
  School Song. Now the Millstead School Song had been likened by a witty though
  irreverent Master to the funeral-march of a smoked haddock. It began with a
  ferocious yell of "<i>Haec olim revocare</i>" and continued through yards of
  uneuphonious Latin into a remorseless <i>clump-clump</i> of a chorus. Speed
  believed that, even supposing the words were sacrosanct, that ought to be no
  reason for the tune to be so, and suggested to the Head that some reputable
  modern composer should be commissioned to write one. The Head, of course,
  would not agree. "The tune, Mr. Speed, has-um, yes&mdash;associations. As a
  newcomer you cannot be expected to feel them, but believe me, they
  do&mdash;um, yes&mdash;they do most certainly exist. An old foundation, Mr.
  Speed, and if you take away from us our&mdash;um&mdash;traditions, then
  you&mdash;um&mdash;take away that which not enriches you and makes us, um,
  yes&mdash;poor indeed." And, with a glint of satisfaction at having made use
  of a quotation rather aptly, the Head indicated that Speed must not depart
  from the recognised routine.</p>

  <p>Even without innovations, however, the concert demanded a great deal of
  practising and rehearsal, and in this Speed had the rather hazy co-operation
  of Raggs, the visiting organist. He it was who told Speed exactly what items
  must, on no account, be omitted; and, who further informed him of items which
  must on no account be included; these latter consisted chiefly of things
  which Speed suggested himself. It was finally arranged, however, and the
  programme submitted to and passed by the Head: there was to be a pianoforte
  solo, a trio for piano, violin and 'cello, a good, resounding song by the
  choir, a quartet singing Christmas carols, and one or two "suitable" songs
  from operas. The performers, where possible, were to be boys of the school,
  but there were precedents for drawing on the services of outsiders when
  necessary. Thus when it was found that the school orchestra lacked first
  violins, Raggs gave Speed the names of several ladies and gentlemen in the
  town who had on former occasions lent their services in this capacity. And
  among these names was that of Miss Clare Harrington.</p>

  <p>Speed, making his preparations about the middle of November, was in a
  dilemma with this list of names. He knew that, for some reason or other,
  Helen did not care for Clare's company, and that if Clare were to take part,
  not only in the concert itself, but in all the preceding rehearsals, she
  would be brought almost inevitably into frequent contact with Helen. He
  thought also that if he canvassed all the other people first, Clare might, if
  she came to hear of it, think that he had treated her spitefully. In the end
  he solved the difficulty by throwing the burden of selection on to Raggs and
  undertaking in exchange some vastly more onerous task that Raggs was anxious
  to get rid of. A few days later Raggs accosted Speed in the cloisters and
  said: "I've got you a few first violins. Here's their names and addresses on
  this card. They'll turn up to the next rehearsal if you'll send them
  word."</p>

  <p>When Raggs had shambled away, Speed looked curiously at the card which he
  had pushed into his hand. Scanning down the list, scribbled in Raggs's most
  illegible pencilled script, he found himself suddenly conscious of pleasure,
  slight yet strangely distinct; something that made him go on his way
  whistling a tune. Clare's name was on the list.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">Those crowded winter nights of rehearsals for the concert
  were full of incident for Speed. As soon as the school had finished
  preparation in the Big Hall, the piano was uncovered and pushed into the
  middle of the platform; the violinists and 'cellists began to tune up; the
  choir assembled with much noise and a disposition to regard rehearsals as a
  boisterous form of entertainment; lastly, the visitors from the town
  appeared, adapting themselves condescendingly to the rollicking
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Speed discovered Clare to be a rather good violinist. She played quietly
  and accurately, with an absence (rare in good violinists) of superfluous
  emotion. Once she said to Speed, referring to one of the other imported
  violinists: "Listen! This Mozart's only a decorative frieze, and that man's
  playing it as if it were the whole gateway to the temple of Eros." Speed, who
  liked architectural similes himself, nodded appreciatively. Clare went on: "I
  always want to laugh at emotion in the wrong place. Violinists who are too
  fond of the mute, for instance." Speed said, laughing: "Yes, and organists
  who are too fond of the <i>vox humana</i>." To which Clare added: "And don't
  forget to mention the audiences that are too fond of both. It's their fault
  principally."</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock, when rehearsals were over, Speed accompanied Clare home to
  the shop in High Street. There was something in those walks which crept over
  him like a slow fascination, so that after the first few occasions he found
  himself sitting at the piano during the rehearsal with everything in his mind
  subordinate to the tingling anticipation of the stroll afterwards. When they
  left the Big Hall and descended the steps into the cool dusk of the
  cloisters, his spirits rose as with wine; and when from the cloisters they
  turned into the crisp-cold night, crunching softly over the frosted
  quadrangle and shivering joyously in the first keen lash of the wind, he
  could have scampered for sheer happiness like a schoolboy granted an
  unexpected holiday. Sometimes the moon was white on roofs and roadways;
  sometimes the sky was densely black; sometimes it was raining and Millstead
  High Street was no more than a vista of pavements with the yellow lamplight
  shining on the pools in them; once, at least, it was snowing soft, dancing
  flakes that covered the ground inches deep as they walked. But whatever the
  world was like on those evenings on which Speed accompanied Clare, one thing
  was common to them all: an atmosphere of robust companionship, impervious to
  all things else. The gales that romped and frolicked over the fenlands were
  no more vigorous and coldly sweet than something that romped and frolicked in
  Speed's inmost soul.</p>

  <p>Once they were discussing the things that they hated most of all. "I hate
  myself more than anything else&mdash;sometimes," said Speed.</p>

  <p>Clare said: "And I hate people who think that a thing's bound to be sordid
  because it's real: people who think a thing's beautiful merely because it's
  hazy and doesn't mean anything. I'm afraid I hate Mendelssohn."</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Mendelssohn? Why, that was what Helen used to be keen on,
  wasn't it?&mdash;last term, don't you remember?"</p>

  <p>A curious silence supervened.</p>

  <p>Clare said, after a pause: "Yes, I believe it was."</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">Helen's attitude towards Clare at this time was strangely at
  variance with her former one. As soon as she learned that Clare was playing
  in the concert she wrote to her and told her always to come into Lavery's
  before the rehearsal began. "It will be nice seeing you so often, Clare," she
  wrote, "and you needn't worry about getting back in the evenings because
  Kenneth will always see you home."</p>

  <p>Speed said, when he heard of Helen's invitation: "But I thought you didn't
  like Clare, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was silly," she answered. "I do like her, really. And besides, we
  must be hospitable. You'll see her back in the evenings, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"I daresay I <i>can</i> do," he said.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly laughing aloud, he caught her into his arms and kissed her.
  "I'm so glad it's all right again, Helen. I don't like my little Helen to
  throw away her old friends. It isn't like her. You see how happy we shall all
  be, now that we're friendly again with Clare."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are the most lovable and loving little girl in the world
  except "-he frowned at her playfully&mdash;"when the devil persuades you that
  you don't like people. Some day he'll persuade you that you don't like
  me."</p>

  <p>"He won't," she said.</p>

  <p>"I hope he won't."</p>

  <p>She seemed to him then more than ever a child, a child whose winsomeness
  was alloyed with quaint and baffling caprice. He loved her, too, very gladly
  and affectionately; and he knew then, quite clearly because the phase was
  past that, her announced dislike of Clare had made him love her not quite so
  much. But now all was happy and unruffled again, so what did it matter?</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-02-03"
     id="ch-02-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Smallwood was one of a type more commonly found at a
  university than at a public school; in fact it was due to his decision not to
  go to the former that he had stayed so, long at Millstead. He was nineteen
  years old, and when he left he would enter his father's office in the City.
  The disciplinary problems of dealing with him and others of his type bristled
  with awkwardness, especially for a Master so young as Speed; the difficulty
  was enhanced by the fact that Smallwood, having stayed at Millstead long
  enough to achieve all athletic distinctions merely by inevitability, was a
  power in the school of considerable magnitude. Personally, he was popular; he
  was in no sense a bully; he was a kindly and certainly not too strict
  prefect; his disposition was friendly and easy-going. But for the unfortunate
  clash at the beginning of the term Speed might have found in him a powerful
  ally instead of a sinister enemy. One quality Smallwood possessed above all
  others&mdash;vanity; and Speed, having affronted that vanity, could count on
  a more virulent enmity than Smallwood's lackadaisical temperament was
  ordinarily capable of.</p>

  <p>The error lay, of course, in the system which allowed Smallwood to stay at
  Millstead so long. Smallwood at nineteen was distinctly and quite naturally a
  man, not a boy; and whatever in him seemed unnatural was forced on him by the
  Millstead atmosphere. There was nothing at all surprising in his study-walls
  being covered with photographs of women and amorous prints obtained from
  French magazines. Nor was it surprising that he was that very usual
  combination&mdash;the athlete and the dandy, that his bathroom was a boudoir
  of pastes and oils and cosmetics, and that, with his natural good looks, he
  should have the reputation of being a lady-killer. Compelled by the
  restraints of Millstead life to a resignation of this branch of his
  activities during term-time, he found partial solace in winking at the less
  unattractive of the school-servants (who, it was reported, were chosen by the
  matron on the score of ugliness), and in relating to his friends lurid
  stories of his adventures in London during the vacations. He had had, for a
  nineteen-year-old, the most amazing experiences, and sometimes the more
  innocuous of these percolated, by heaven knows what devious channels, to the
  amused ears of the Masters' Common-Room. The Masters as a whole, it should be
  noted, liked Smallwood, because, with a little flattery and smoothing-down,
  they could always cajole him into agreement with them. Titivate his vanity
  and he was Samson shorn of his locks.</p>

  <p>Now the masters, for various reasons, did not like Speed so much in his
  second term as they had done in his first. Like all bodies of averagely
  tolerant men they tended to be kindly to newcomers, and Speed, young, quiet,
  modest, and rather attractively nervous, had won more of their hearts than
  some of them afterwards cared to remember. The fact that his father was a
  titled man and that Speed never talked about it, was bound to impress a group
  of men who, by the unalterable circumstances of their lives, were compelled
  to spend a large portion of their time in cultivating an attitude of
  snobbery. But in his second term Speed found them not so friendly. That was
  to be expected in any case, for while much may be forgiven a man during his
  first probationary term, his second is one in which he must prepare to be
  judged by stricter standards. Besides the normal hardening of judgment, Speed
  was affected by another even more serious circumstance. He had committed the
  unpardonable offence of being too successful. Secretly, more than half the
  staff were acutely jealous of him. Even those who were entirely ineligible
  for the post at Lavery's, and would not have accepted it if it had been
  offered them, were yet conscious of some subtle personal chagrin in seeing
  Speed, after his first term, step into a place of such power and dignity.
  They had the feeling that the whole business had been done discreditably
  behind their backs, although, of course, the Masters had no right, either
  virtual or technical, to be consulted in the matter of appointments. Yet when
  they arrived at Millstead at the beginning of the term and learned that
  Speed, their junior by ever so many years, had married the Head's daughter
  during the vacation and had been forthwith appointed to the mastership of
  Lavery's, they could not forbear an instant sensation of ruefulness which
  developed later into more or less open antagonism. Not all the talk about the
  desirability of young married housemasters could dispel that curious feeling
  of having been slighted.</p>

  <p>Secretly, no doubt, they hoped that Lavery's would be too much for Speed.
  And on the occasion of the row between Speed and Smallwood they sympathised
  with the latter, regarding him as the victim of Speed's monstrous and
  aggressive self-assertion. The circumstance that Speed took few meals now in
  the Masters' Common-Room prevented the legend of his self-assertiveness from
  being effectively smashed; as term progressed and as Speed's eager and
  pertinacious enthusiasm about the concert became apparent, the legend rather
  grew than diminished. Clanwell, alone, perhaps, of all the staff, still
  thought of Speed without feelings of jealousy, and that was rather because he
  regarded him as one of his elder boys, to be looked after and advised when
  necessary. He formed the habit of inviting Speed into his room to coffee once
  or twice a week, and on these occasions he gave the young man many hints
  drawn from his full-blooded, though rather facile, philosophy.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of one of these evening confabulations he caught hold of
  Speed's arm as the latter was going out by the door and said: "I say,
  Speed&mdash;just before you go&mdash;there's a little matter I've been
  wondering all night whether I'd mention to you or not. I hope you won't be
  offended. I'm the last man to go round making trouble or telling tales, and
  I'm aware that I'm risking your friendship if I say what I have in mind."</p>

  <p>"You won't do that," said Speed. "Say what you want to say." He stared at
  Clanwell nervously, for at a call such as this a cloud of vague,
  apprehensions would swarm round and over him, filling the future with dark
  dreads.</p>

  <p>"It's about your wife," said Clanwell. "I'm not going to say much. It
  isn't anything to worry about, I daresay. Perhaps it doesn't justify my
  mentioning it to you. Your wife..."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I should&mdash;keep an eye on her, if I were you. She's young, Speed,
  remember. She's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean-keep an eye on her? What should I keep an eye on her
  for?"</p>

  <p>"I told you, Speed, I wasn't going to say much. You mustn't imagine
  yourself on the verge of a scandal&mdash;I don't suppose there's anything
  really the matter at all. Only, as I was saying, she's young, and
  she&mdash;she's apt to do unwise things. Once or twice lately, while you've
  been out, she's had Smallwood in to tea."</p>

  <p>"Smallwood!&mdash;Alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, alone."</p>

  <p>Speed blushed furiously and was silent. A sudden new feeling, which he
  diagnosed as jealousy, swept across him; followed by a further series of
  feelings which were no more than various forms of annoyance and exacerbation.
  He clenched his fists and gave a slight shrug of his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"How do you know all this?" he queried, in the staccato bark that was so
  accurate a register of his temper.</p>

  <p>"Smallwood isn't the fellow to keep such an affair secret," replied
  Clanwell. "But don't, Speed, go and do anything rash. If I were you I should
  go back and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shan't do anything rash," interrupted Speed, curtly. "You needn't
  worry. Good night...I suppose I ought to thank you for your kindness in
  telling me what you have."</p>

  <p>When he had gone he regretted that final remark. It was, he decided,
  uselessly and pointlessly cynical.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a pity, perhaps, that in his present mood he went
  straight back to Lavery's and to Helen. He found her sitting, as usual, by
  the fire when he entered; he made no remark, but came and sat opposite to
  her. Neither of them spoke for a few moments. That was not unusual for them,
  for Helen had frequent fits of taciturnity, and Speed, becoming familiar with
  them, found himself adopting similar habits. After, however, a short space of
  silence, he broke it by saying: "Helen, do you mind if we have a serious talk
  for a little while?"</p>

  <p>She looked up and said, quietly: "Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>"Clanwell's," he replied, and as soon as he had done so he realised that
  she would easily guess who had informed him. A pity that he had answered her
  so readily.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to ask me?"</p>

  <p>He said, rather loudly, as always when he was nervous: "Helen, I'm going
  to be quite straightforward. No beating about the bush, you
  understand?&mdash;You've had Smallwood in here to tea lately, while I've been
  out."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Her voice, irritatingly soft, just as his own was irritatingly
  loud, contained a mixture of surprise and mockery. "And what if I have?"</p>

  <p>He gripped the arms of the wicker-chair with his fists, causing a creaking
  sound that seemed additionally to discompose him. "Helen, you can't do it,
  that's all. You mustn't. It won't do...It..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she was talking at him, slowly and softly at first, then in a
  rising, gathering, tempestuous torrent; her eyes, lit by the firelight,
  blazed through the tears in them. "Can't I? Mustn't I? You say it won't do?
  You can go out whenever and wherever you like, you can go out to Clanwell's
  in the evening, you can walk down to the town with Clare, you can have
  anybody you like in to tea, you choose your own friends, you live your own
  life&mdash;and then you actually dare to tell me I can't!&mdash;What is it to
  you if I make a friend of Smallwood?&mdash;Haven't I the right to make
  friends without your permission?&mdash;Haven't I the right to entertain
  <i>my</i> friends in here as much as you have the right to entertain
  <i>your</i> friends?&mdash;Kenneth, you think I'm a child, you call me a
  child, you treat me as a child. <i>That's</i> what won't do. I'm a woman and
  I won't be domineered over. So now you know it."</p>

  <p>Her passion made him suddenly icily cool; he was no longer the least bit
  nervous. He perceived, with calm intuition, that this was going to be their
  first quarrel.</p>

  <p>"In the first place," he began quietly, "you must be fair to me. Surely,
  it is not extraordinary that I should go up to see Clanwell once or twice
  during the week. He's a colleague and a friend. Secondly, walking down into
  the town to see Clare home after rehearsals is a matter of common politeness,
  which you, I think, asked me particularly to do. And as for asking people in
  to tea, you have, as you say, as free a choice in that as I have, except when
  you do something absolutely unwise. Helen, I'm serious. Don't insist on this
  argument becoming a quarrel. If it does, it will be our first quarrel,
  remember?"</p>

  <p>"You think you can move me by talking like that!"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I think nothing of the sort. I simply do not want to quarrel. I
  want you to see my point of view, and I'm equally anxious to see yours. With
  regard to this Smallwood business, you must, if you think a little, realise
  that in a place like Millstead you can't behave absolutely without regard for
  conventions. Smallwood, remember, is nearly your own age. You see what I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that I'm not to be trusted with any man nearly my own age?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean that. The thought that there could be anything in the
  least discreditable in the friendship between Smallwood and you never once
  crossed my mind. I know, of course, that it is perfectly honest and
  aboveboard. Don't please, put my attitude down to mere jealousy. I'm not in
  the least jealous."</p>

  <p>What surprised him more than anything else in this amazing chain of
  circumstances, was that he was sitting there talking to her so calmly and
  deliberately, almost as if he were arguing an abstruse point in a court of
  law! Of this new cold self that was suddenly to the front he had had no
  former experience. And certainly it was true to say that at that moment there
  was not in him an atom of jealousy.</p>

  <p>She seemed to shrivel up beneath the coldness of his argument. She said,
  doggedly: "I'm not going to give way, Kenneth."</p>

  <p>They both looked at each other then, quite calmly and subconsciously a
  little awed, as if they could see suddenly the brink on which they were
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Helen, I don't want to domineer over you at all. I want you to be as free
  to do what you like as I am. But there are some things, which, for my sake
  and for the sake of the position I hold here, you ought not to do. And having
  Smallwood here alone when I am away is one of those things."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree. I have as much right to make a friend of Smallwood as you
  have to make a friend of&mdash;say Clare!"</p>

  <p>The mention of Clare shifted him swiftly out of his cool, calculating mood
  and back into the mood which had possessed him when he first came into the
  room. "Not at all," he replied sharply. "The cases are totally different.
  Smallwood is a boy&mdash;a boy in my House. That makes all the
  difference."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it makes any difference."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Helen!&mdash;You don't see? Don't you realise the sort of
  talk that is getting about? Doesn't it occur to you that Smallwood will
  chatter about this all over the school and make out that he's conducting a.
  clandestine flirtation with you? Don't you see how it will undermine all the
  discipline of the House&mdash;will make people laugh at me when my back's
  turned&mdash;will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I'm to give up my freedom just to stop people from laughing at you,
  am I?"</p>

  <p>"Helen, <i>why</i> can't you see my point of view? Would you like to see
  me a failure at Lavery's? Wouldn't you feel hurt to hear everybody sniggering
  about me?"</p>

  <p>"I should feel hurt to think that you could only succeed at Lavery's by
  taking away my freedom."</p>

  <p>"Helen, marriage isn't freedom, it's partnership. I can't do what I like.
  Neither can you."</p>

  <p>"I can try, though."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you can succeed in making my life at Millstead unendurable."</p>

  <p>She cried fiercely: "I won't talk about it any longer, Kenneth. We don't
  agree and apparently we shan't, however long we argue. I still think I've a
  right to ask Smallwood in to tea if I want to."</p>

  <p>"And I still think you haven't."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then"&mdash;with a laugh&mdash;"that's a deadlock, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>He stared at the fire silently for some moments, then rose, and came to
  the back of her chair. Something in her attitude seemed to him blindingly,
  achingly pathetic; the tears rushed to his eyes; he felt he had been cruel to
  her. One part of him urged him to have pity on her, not to let her suffer, to
  give way, at all costs, rather than bring shadows over her life; to appeal,
  passionately and perhaps sentimentally, that she would, for his sake, if she
  loved him, make his task at Lavery's no harder than it need be. The other
  part of him said: No, you have said what is perfectly fair and true; you have
  nothing at all to apologise for. If you apologise you will only weaken your
  position for ever afterwards.</p>

  <p>In the end the two conflicting parts of him effected a compromise. He
  said, good-humouredly, almost gaily, to her: "Yes, Helen, I'm afraid it is a
  deadlock. But that's no reason why it should be a quarrel. After all, we
  ought to be able to disagree without quarrelling. Now, let's allow the matter
  to drop, eh? Eh, Helen? Smile at me, Helen!"</p>

  <p>But instead of smiling, she burst into sudden passionate sobbing. Her head
  dropped heavily into her hands and all her hair, loosened by the fall,
  dispersed itself over her hands and cheeks in an attitude of terrific
  despair. On Speed the effect of it was as that of a knife cutting him in two.
  He could not bear to see her misery, evoked by something said or done,
  however justifiably, by him; pity swelled over him in a warm, aching tide; he
  stooped to her and put a hand hesitatingly on her shoulder. He was almost
  afraid to touch her, and when, at the first sensation of his hand, she drew
  away hurriedly, he crept back also as if he were terrified by her. Then
  gradually he came near her again and told her, with his emotion making his
  voice gruff, that he was sorry. He had treated her unkindly and oh&mdash;he
  was <i>so</i> sorry. He could not bear to see her cry. It hurt him...Dear,
  darling Helen, would she forgive him? If she would only forgive him she could
  have Smallwood in to tea every day if she wished, and damn what anybody said
  about it! Helen, Helen...</p>

  <p>Yet the other part of him, submerged, perhaps, but by no means silent,
  still urged: You haven't treated her unkindly, and you know you haven't. You
  have nothing to apologise for at all. And if she does keep on inviting
  Smallwood in you'll have the same row with her again, sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Helen, <i>dear</i> Helen&mdash;do answer me!-Don't cry like that&mdash;I
  can't bear it!&mdash;Answer me, Helen, answer me!"</p>

  <p>Then she raised her head and put her arms out to him and kissed him with
  fierce passion, so that she almost hurt his neck. Even then she did not, for
  a moment, answer, but he did not mind, because he knew now that she had
  forgiven him. And strangely enough, in that moment of passionate embrace,
  there returned to him a feeling of crude, rudimentary jealousy; he felt that
  for the future he would, as Clanwell had advised him, have to keep an eye on
  her to make sure that none of this high, mountainous love escaped from within
  the four walls of his own house. He felt suddenly greedy, physically greedy;
  the thought, even instantly contradicted, of half-amorous episodes between
  her and Smallwood affected him with an insurgent bitterness which made the
  future heavy with foreboding.</p>

  <p>She whispered to him that she had been very silly and that she wouldn't
  have Smallwood in again if he wished her not to.</p>

  <p>Even amidst his joy at her submission, the word "silly" struck him as an
  absurdly inadequate word to apply to her attitude.</p>

  <p>He said, deliberately against his will: "Helen, darling, it was I who was
  silly. Have Smallwood in as much as you like. I don't want to interfere with
  your happiness."</p>

  <p>He expected her then to protest that she had no real desire to have
  Smallwood in, and when she failed to protest, he was disappointed. The fear
  came to him that perhaps Smallwood did attract her, being so good-looking,
  and that his granting her full permission to see him would give that
  attraction a chance to develop. Jealousy once again stormed at him.</p>

  <p>But how sweet the reconciliation, after all! For concentrated loveliness
  nothing in his life could equal the magic of that first hour with her after
  she had ceased crying. It was moonlight outside and about midnight they
  leaned for a moment out of the window with the icy wind stinging their
  cheeks. Millstead asleep in the pallor, took on the semblance of his own mood
  and seemed tremulous with delight. Somewhere, too, amidst the dreaming
  loveliness of the moon-washed roofs and turrets, there was a touch of
  something that was just a little exquisitely sad, and that too, faint, yet
  quite perceptible, was in his own mood.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">There came the concert in the first week of December. No
  one, not even those of the Common-Room who were least cordially disposed to
  him, could deny that Speed had worked indefatigably and that his efforts
  deserved success. Yet the success, merited though it was, was hardly likely
  to increase his popularity among those inclined to be jealous of him.</p>

  <p>Briskly energetic and full of high spirits throughout all the rehearsals;
  and most energetic of all on the actual evening of the performance, he yet
  felt, when all was over, and he knew that the affair had been a success, the
  onrush of a wave of acute depression. He had, no doubt, been working too
  hard, and this was the natural reaction of nerves. It was a cold night with
  hardly any wind, and during the evening a thick fog had drifted up from the
  fenlands, so that there was much excited talk among the visitors about the
  difficulties of getting to their homes. Nothing was to be seen more than five
  or six yards ahead, and there was the prospect that as the night advanced the
  fog would become worse. The Millstead boys, enjoying the novelty, were
  scampering across the forbidden quadrangle, revelling in the delightful risk
  of being caught and in the still more delightful possibility of knocking
  over, by accident, some one or other of the Masters. Speed, standing on the
  top step of the flight leading down from the Big Hall, gazed into the dense
  inky-black cloisters where two faint pin-pricks of light indicated lamps no
  more than a few yards away. He felt acutely miserable, and he could not think
  why. In a way, he was sorry that the bustle of rehearsals, to which he had
  become quite accustomed, was all finished with; but surely that was hardly a
  sufficient reason for feeling miserable? Hearing the boyish cries from across
  the quadrangle he suddenly felt that he was old, and that he wished he were
  young again, as young as the youngest of the boys at Millstead.</p>

  <p>Since the quarrel about Smallwood he and Helen had got on tolerably well
  together. She had not asked Smallwood in to tea again, and he judged that she
  did not intend to, though to save her dignity she would still persist in her
  right to do so whenever she wished. The arrangement was quite satisfactory to
  him. But, despite the settlement of that affair, their relationship had
  suddenly become a thing of fierce, alternating contrasts. They were either
  terrifically happy or else desperately miserable. The atmosphere, when he
  came into Lavery's after an absence of even a quarter of an hour, might
  either be dull and glowering or else radiant with joy. He could never guess
  which it would be, and he could never discover reasons for whichever
  atmosphere he encountered. But invariably he was forced into responding; if
  Helen were moody and silent he also remained quiet, even if his inclinations
  were to go to the piano and sing comic songs. And if Helen were bright and
  joyful he forced himself to boisterousness, no matter what press of gravity
  was upon him. He sometimes found himself stopping short on his own threshold,
  frightened to enter lest Helen's mood, vastly different from his own, might
  drag him up or down too disconcertingly. Even their times of happiness, more
  wonderful now than ever, were drug-like in possessing after-effects which
  projected themselves backward in a tide of sweet melancholy that suffused
  everything. He knew that he loved her more passionately than ever, and he
  knew also that the beauty of it was mysteriously impregnated with
  sadness.</p>

  <p>She stole up to him now in the fog, dainty and pretty in her heavy fur
  cloak. She put a hand on his sleeve; evidently this was one of her happy
  moods.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Kenneth&mdash;<i>what</i> a fog! Aren't you glad everything's all
  over? It went off wonderfully, didn't it? Do you think the Rayners will be
  able to get home all right&mdash;they live out at Deepersdale, you know?"</p>

  <p>Replying to the last of her queries, he said: "Oh yes, I don't think it's
  quite bad enough to stop them altogether."</p>

  <p>Then after a pause she went on: "Clare's just putting her things on, and I
  told her to meet you here. You'll see her home, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He wondered in a vague kind of way why Helen was so desperately anxious
  that he should take Clare on her way home, but he was far too exhausted
  mentally to give the matter sustained excogitation. It seemed to him that
  Helen suddenly vanished, that he waited hours in the fog, and that Clare
  appeared mysteriously by his side, speak, ing to him in a voice that was full
  of sharp, recuperative magic. "My dear man, aren't you going to put your coat
  on?" Then he deliberately laughed and said: "Heavens, yes, I'd
  forgotten&mdash;just a minute if you don't mind waiting!"</p>

  <p>He groped his way back into the hall and to the alcove where he had laid
  his coat and hat. The yellow light blurred his eyes with a film of
  half-blindness; phantasies of doubt and dread enveloped him; he felt, with
  that almost barometric instinct that he possessed, that things momentous and
  incalculable were looming in the future. This Millstead that had seemed to
  him so bright and lovely was now heavy with dark mysterious menace; as he
  walked back across the hall through the long avenues of disturbed chairs it
  occurred to him suddenly that perhaps this foreboding that was hovering about
  him was not mental at all, but physical; that he had overworked himself and
  was going to be ill. Perhaps, even, he was ill already. He had a curious
  desire that someone should confirm him in this supposition; when Clare,
  meeting him at the doorway, said: "You're looking thoroughly tired out Mr.
  Speed," he smiled and answered, with a touch of thankfulness: "I'm feeling,
  perhaps, a little that way."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Clare, immediately, "please don't trouble to see me home. I
  can quite easily find my own way, I assure you. You go back to Lavery's and
  get straight off to bed."</p>

  <p>The thought, thus presented to him, of forgoing this walk into the town
  with her, sent a sharp flush into his cheeks and pulled down the hovering
  gloom almost on to his eyes; he knew then, more acutely than he had ever
  guessed before, that he was desiring Clare's company in a way that was a good
  deal more than casual. The realisation surprised him just a little at first,
  and then surprised him a great deal because at first it had surprised him
  only a little.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather come with you if you don't mind," he said. "The walk will do
  me good."</p>

  <p>"What, <i>this</i> weather!" she exclaimed softly, and then laughed a
  sharp, instant laugh.</p>

  <p>That laugh galvanised him into determination. "I'm coming anyway," he said
  quietly, and took her arm and led her away into the fog.</p>

  <p>Out in the high road it was blacker and denser; the school railings,
  dripping with grimy moisture, provided the only sure clue to position. Half,
  at least, of Speed's energies were devoted to the task of not losing the way;
  with the other half he was unable to carry out much of the strange programme
  of conversation that had been gathering in his mind. For many days past he
  had been accumulating a store of things to say to her upon this memorable
  walk which, so far as he could judge, was bound to be the last; now, with the
  opportunity arrived, he said hardly anything at all. She chattered to him
  about music and Millstead and odd topics of slight importance; she pressed
  her scarf to her lips and the words came out curiously muffled and
  deep-toned, with the air of having incalculable issues depending on them. But
  he hardly answered her at all. And at last they reached Harrington's shop in
  the High Street, and she shook hands with him and told him to get back as
  quickly as he could and be off to bed. "And don't work so hard," were her
  last words to him, "or you'll be ill."</p>

  <p>Thicker and blacker than ever was the fog on the way back to the school,
  and somehow, through what error he never discovered, he lost himself amongst
  the narrow, old-fashioned streets in the centre of the town. He wandered
  about, as it seemed to him, for hours, creeping along walls and hoping to
  meet some passer-by who could direct him Once he heard Millstead Parish
  Church beginning the chime of midnight, but it was from the direction he
  least expected. At last, after devious manoeuvring, he discovered himself
  again on the main road up to the school, and this time with great care he
  managed to keep to the route. As he entered the main gateway he heard the
  school clock sounding the three-quarters. A quarter to one! All was silent at
  Lavery's. He rang the bell timorously. After a pause he heard footsteps
  approaching on the other side, but they seemed to him light and airy; the
  bolts were pushed back, not with Burton's customary noise, but softly, almost
  frightenedly.</p>

  <p>He could see that it was Helen standing there in the porch, not Burton.
  She flashed an electric torch in his face and then at his feet so that he
  should see the step.</p>

  <p>She said: "Come in quickly-don't let the fog in. You're awfully late,
  aren't you? I told Burton to go to bed. I didn't know you were going to stay
  at Clare's."</p>

  <p>He answered: "I didn't stay at Clare's. I got lost in the fog on the way
  back."</p>

  <p>"Lost!" she echoed, walking ahead of him down the corridor towards his
  sitting-room. The word echoed weirdly in the silence. "<i>Lost</i>, were
  you?&mdash;So that's why you were late?"</p>

  <p>"That's why," he said.</p>

  <p>He followed her into the tiny lamp-lit room, full of flrelight that was
  somehow melancholy and not cheerful.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">She was silent. She sat in one of the chairs with her eyes
  looking straight into the fire; while he took off his coat and hat and drew
  up his own chair opposite to hers she neither moved nor spoke. It seemed to
  him as he watched her that the room grew redder and warmer and more
  melancholy; the flames lapped so noisily in the silence that he had for an
  instant the absurd fear that the scores of sleepers in the dormitories would
  be awakened. Then he heard, very faintly from above, what he imagined must be
  an especially loud snore; it made him smile. As he smiled he saw Helen's eyes
  turned suddenly upon him; he blushed as if caught in some guilty act. He
  said: "Can you hear somebody snoring up in the Senior dormitory?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him curiously for a moment and then replied: "No, and
  neither can you. You said that to make conversation."</p>

  <p>"I didn't!" he cried, with genuine indignation. "I distinctly heard it.
  That's what made me smile."</p>

  <p>"And do yon really think that the sound of anybody snoring in the Senior
  dormitory would reach us in here? Why, we never hear the maids in a morning
  and they make ever such a noise!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but then there are so many other noises to drown it. However, it may
  have been my imagination."</p>

  <p>"Or it may have been your invention, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Helen, I <i>did</i> think that I heard it! It <i>wasn't</i>
  my invention. What reason on earth should I have for inventing it? Oh, well,
  anyway, it's such a trifling matter&mdash;it's not worth arguing about."</p>

  <p>"Then let's stop arguing. You started it."</p>

  <p>Silence again. The melancholy in the atmosphere was charged now with an
  added quality, something that weighed and threatened and was dangerous. He
  knew that Helen had something pressing on her mind, and that until she flung
  it off there would be no friendliness with her. And he wanted friendliness.
  He could not endure the torture of her bitter silences.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he said, nervously eager, "Helen, there's something the matter.
  Tell me what it is."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing the matter."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you so silent?"</p>

  <p>"Because I would rather be silent than <i>make</i> conversation."</p>

  <p>"That's sarcastic."</p>

  <p>"Is it? If you think it is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Helen, <i>please</i> be kind to me. If you go on as you are doing I'm
  sure I shall either cry or lose my temper. I'm tired to death after all the
  work of the concert and I simply can't bear this attitude of yours."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't change my attitude to please you."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not."</p>

  <p>"<i>Now</i> who's sarcastic? Good heavens, do you think I've nothing to do
  but suit your mood when you come home tired at one o'clock in the morning-You
  spend half the night with some other woman and then when you come home, tired
  out, you expect me to soothe and make a fuss of you!"</p>

  <p>"Helen, that's a lie! I walked straight home with Clare. You specially
  asked me to do that."</p>

  <p>"I didn't specially ask you to stay out with her till one o'clock in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I didn't stay with her till then. To begin with, it isn't one o'clock
  even yet...Remember that the concert was over about eleven. I took Clare
  straight home and left her long before midnight. It wasn't my fault I lost my
  way in the fog."</p>

  <p>"Nor mine either. But perhaps it was Clare's, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Helen, I can't bear you to insinuate like that! Tell me frankly what you
  suspect, and then I'll answer frankly!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't answer frankly. And that's why I. can't tell you
  frankly."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think it's scandalous&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him fiercely with: "Oh, yes, it's scandalous that I should
  dare to be annoyed when you give all your friendship to another woman and
  none to me, isn't it? It's scandalous that when you come home after seeing
  this other woman I shouldn't be perfectly happy and bright and ready to kiss
  and comfort you and wheedle you out of the misery you're in at having to
  leave her! You only want me for a comforter, and it's so scandalous when I
  don't feel in the humour to oblige, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Helen, it's not true! My friendship belongs to you more than
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me lies just to calm me into suiting your mood. Do you think I
  haven't noticed that we haven't anything in common except that we love each
  other? We don't know what on earth to talk about when we're alone together.
  We just know how to bore each other and to torture each other with our love.
  Don't you realise the truth of that? Don't you find yourself eagerly looking
  forward to seeing Clare; Clare whom you can talk to and be friendly with;
  Clare who's your equal, perhaps your superior, in intellect? Lately, I've
  given you as many chances to see her as I could, because if you're going to
  tire of me I'd rather you do it quickly. But I'm sorry I can't promise to be
  always gay and amusing while it's going on. It may be scandalous that I
  can't, but it's the truth, anyway!"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Helen, what an extraordinary bundle of misunderstandings
  you've got hold of! Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you'd like to smooth me down and persuade me it's all my own
  misunderstanding, I daresay, as you've always been able to do! But the effect
  doesn't last for very long; sooner or later it all crops up again. It's no
  use, Kenneth. I'm not letting myself be angry, but I tell you it's not a bit
  of use. I'm sick to death of wanting from you what I can't get. I've tried
  hard to educate myself into being your equal, but it doesn't seem to make you
  value me any more. Possibly you like me best as a child; perhaps you wouldn't
  have married me if you'd known I was really a woman. Anyway, Kenneth, I can't
  help it. And there's another thing-I'm miserably jealous&mdash;of Clare. If
  you'd had a grain of ordinary sense you might have guessed it before
  now."</p>

  <p>"My dear Helen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he stopped, seeing that she was staring at him fearlessly. She was
  different, somehow, from what she had ever been before; and this quarrel, if
  it could be called a quarrel, was also different both in size and texture.
  There was no anger in her; nothing but stormy sincerity and passionate
  outpouring of the truth. A new sensation overspread him; a thrill of
  surprised and detached admiration for her. If she were always like this, he
  thought&mdash;if she were always proud, passionate, and sincere&mdash;how
  splendidly she would take possession of him! For he wanted to belong to her,
  finally and utterly; he was anxious for any enslavement that should give him
  calm and absolute anchorage.</p>

  <p>His admiration was quickly superseded by astonishment at her
  self-revelation.</p>

  <p>"But Helen&mdash;" he gasped, leaning over the arm of his chair and
  putting his hand on her wrist, "Helen, I'd no idea! <i>Jealous</i>! You
  jealous of Clare! What on earth for? Clare's only an acquaintance! Why,
  you're a thousand times more to me than Clare ever is or could be!"</p>

  <p>"Kenneth!" She drew her arm away from the touch of his hand with a gesture
  that was determined but not contemptuous. "Kenneth, I don't believe it.
  Perhaps you're not trying to deceive me; probably you're trying to deceive
  yourself and succeeding. Tell me, Kenneth, truthfully, don't you sometimes
  wish I were Clare when you're talking to me? When we're both alone together,
  when we're neither doing nor saying anything particular, don't you wish you
  could make me vanish suddenly and have Clare in my place,
  and&mdash;and"&mdash;bitterness crept into her voice here&mdash;"and call Me
  back when you wanted the only gift of mine which you find satisfactory? You
  came back to-night, miserable, because, you'd said goodbye to Clare, and
  because you couldn't see in the future any chances of meeting her as often as
  you've been able to do lately. You wanted&mdash;you're wanting it
  now&mdash;Clare's company and Clare's conversation and Clare's friendship.
  And because you can't have it you're willing to soothe yourself with my
  pretty little babyish ways, and when you find you can't have <i>them</i>
  either you think it's scandalous! Kenneth, my dear, dear Kenneth, I'm not a
  baby any longer, even if I ever was one&mdash;I'm a woman now, and you don't
  like me as much. I can't help it. I can't help being tortured with jealousy
  all the time you're with Clare. I can't help wanting what Clare has of you
  more than I want what I have of you myself. I can't
  help&mdash;sometimes&mdash;hating her&mdash;loathing her!"</p>

  <p>He was speechless now, made so by a curious dignity with which she spoke
  and the kindness to him that sounded in everything that she said. He was so
  tired and sorry. He leaned his head in his arms and sobbed. Some tragedy that
  had seemed to linger in the lamp-lit room ever since he had come into it out
  of the fog, was now about his head blinding and crushing him; all the world
  of Millstead, spread out in the panorama of days to come, appeared in a haze
  of forlorn melancholy. The love that he had for Helen ached in him with a
  sadness that was deeper now than it had ever been.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, she was all about him, kneeling beside him, stroking
  his hair, taking his hand and pressing it to her breast, crying softly and
  without words.</p>

  <p>He whispered, indistinctly: "Helen, Helen, it's all right. Don't you
  worry, little Helen. I'm not quite well to-night, I think. It must be the
  strain of all that concert work...But I'll be all right when I've had a rest
  for a little while...Helen, darling, you mustn't cry about me like that!"</p>

  <p>Then she said, proudly, though her voice still quivered: "I'm not
  worrying, dear. And you'll see Clare again soon, because I shall ask her to
  come here. You've got to choose between us, and Clare shall have a fair
  chance, anyway...And now come to bed and sleep."</p>

  <p>He gave her a smile that was more babyish than anything that she had ever
  been or done. And with her calm answering smile the sadness seemed somehow a
  little lifted.</p>

     id="ch-02-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">He was in bed for three days with a temperature (but nothing
  more serious); Howard, the School doctor, chaffed him unmercifully. "You're a
  lucky man, Speed, to be ill in bed with Mrs. Speed to nurse you! Better than
  being up in the Sick-room, isn't it?" Once the idea occurred to Speed that he
  might be sickening for some infectious complaint, in which case he would be
  taken away and isolated in the Sanatorium. When he half-hinted the
  possibility of this to Howard, the latter said, laughing loudly: "You needn't
  worry, Speed. I know you don't want to lose your pretty little nurse, do you?
  I understand you, young man-I was your age once, you know."</p>

  <p>But the strange thing was that what Howard supposed Speed didn't want was
  just what he did want. He wanted to lose Helen for a little while. Not
  because he didn't love her. Not because of any reason which he could dare to
  offer himself. Merely, he would admit, a whimsical desire to be without her
  for a short time; it would, he thought, clutching hold of the excuse, save
  her the work of attending to him. He could hardly. understand himself. But
  the fact was, Helen saddened him. It was difficult to explain in detail; but
  there was a kind of aura of melancholy which seemed to follow her about
  wherever she went. In the short winter afternoons he lay awake watching her,
  listening to the distant cheering on the footer pitches, sniffing the aroma
  of tea that she was preparing for him; it was all so delicious and cosy, and
  yet, in a curious, blinding way, it was all so sad. He felt he should slide
  into madness if he were condemned to live all his days like these, with warm
  fires and twilit meals and Helen always about him in attendance. He could not
  understand why it was that though he loved her so dearly yet he should not be
  perfectly happy with her.</p>

  <p>How strange it was to lie there all day listening to all the sounds of
  Millstead! He heard the School-bell ringing the end of every period, the
  shouts of the boys at call-over, the hymns in the chapel&mdash;(his Senior
  organ-pupil was deputising for him)-Burton locking up at night, the murmur of
  gramophones in the prefects' studies; and everything, it seemed to him, was
  full of this same rich sadness. Then he reasoned with himself; the sadness
  must be a part of him, since he saw and felt it in so many things and places.
  It was unfair to blame Helen. Poor Helen, how kind she was to him, and how
  unkindly he treated her in return! Sometimes he imagined himself a blackguard
  and a cad, wrecking the happiness of the woman who would sacrifice everything
  for his sake. Once (it was nearly dark, but the lamp had not yet been lit) he
  called her to him and said, brokenly: "Helen, darling&mdash;Helen, I'm so
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Sorry for what, Kenneth?" she enquired naturally. And he thought and
  pondered and could only add: "I don't know&mdash;nothing in particular. I'm
  just sorry, that's all." And once also he lashed himself into a fervour of
  promises. "I <i>will</i> be kind to you, Helen, dearest. We <i>will</i> be
  friends, we two. There's nothing that anybody shall have of me that you
  shan't have also. I <i>do</i> want you to be happy, Helen." And she
  <i>was</i> happy, then, happy and miserable at the same time; crying for joy
  at the beautiful sadness of it all.</p>

  <p>Those long days and nights! The wind howled up from the fenlands and
  whiffed through the ivy on the walls; the skies were grey and desolate, the
  quadrangle a waste of dingy green. It was the time of the terminal
  House-Matches, and when Milner's beat School House in the Semi-Final the
  cheering throng passed right under Speed's window, yelling at the tops of
  their voices and swinging deafening rattles. In a few days Milner's would
  play Lavery's in the Final, and he hoped to be up by then and able to watch
  it.</p>

  <p>Of course, he had visitors. Clanwell came and gave him endless chatter
  about the House-Matches; a few of the less influential prefects paid him a
  perfunctory visit of condolence and hoped he would soon be all right again.
  And then Doctor and Mrs. Ervine. "Howard tells me it is
  nothing&mdash;um&mdash;to be&mdash;um, er, perturbed about. Just, to use
  an&mdash;um&mdash;colloquialism, run down, eh, Speed? The strain of
  the&mdash;um&mdash;concert must have been quite&mdash;um&mdash;considerable.
  By the way, Speed, I ought to congratulate you&mdash;the whole evening passed
  in the most&mdash;um, yes-the most satisfactory manner." And Mrs. Ervine
  said, in her rather tart way: "It's quite a mercy they only come once a year,
  or we should all be dead very soon, I think."</p>

  <p>And Clare.</p>

  <p>Helen had kept her promise. She had written to Clare asking her to tea on
  a certain afternoon, and she had also contrived that when Clare came she
  should be transacting important and rather lengthy business with the Matron.
  The result was that Speed, now in his sitting-room though still not allowed
  out of doors, was there alone to welcome her.</p>

  <p>He had got into such a curious state of excitement as the time neared for
  her arrival that when she did come he was almost speechless. She smiled and
  shook hands with him and said, immediately: "I'm so sorry to hear you haven't
  been very well. I feel partly responsible, since I dragged you all that way
  in the fog the other night. But I'm not going to waste too much pity on you,
  because I think you waste quite enough on yourself, don't you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed weakly and said that perhaps he did.</p>

  <p>Then there was a long pause which she broke by saying suddenly: "What's
  the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"Matter with me? Oh, nothing serious&mdash;only a chill&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's not what I mean. I want to know what's the matter with you that
  makes you look at me as you were doing just then."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I-I didn't know I was. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. What on earth were they going to talk about? And what
  <i>was</i> this look that he had been giving her? He felt his cheeks burning;
  a fire rising up all around him and bathing his body in warmth.</p>

  <p>She said, obviously with the desire to change the subject: "What are you
  and Helen going to do at Christmas?"</p>

  <p>Pulling himself together with an effort, he replied: "Well, we're not
  certain yet. My&mdash;er&mdash;my people have asked us down to their
  place."</p>

  <p>"And of course you'll go."</p>

  <p>"I'm not certain."</p>

  <p>"But why not?"</p>

  <p>He paused. "Well, you see&mdash;in a way, it's a private reason. I
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if it's a private reason, you certainly mustn't tell me. Let's
  change the subject again. How are the House-Matches going?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, I didn't mean to be rude. And I <i>do</i> want to tell you, as
  it happens. In fact, I wouldn't mind your advice if you'd give it me. Will
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Better put the case before me first."</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it's like this." He was so desperately and unaccountably
  nervous that he found himself plunging into the midst of his story almost
  before he realised what he was doing. "You see, my people were in Australia
  for a holiday when I married Helen. I had to marry her quickly, you remember,
  because of taking this housemastership. And I don't think they quite liked me
  marrying somebody they'd never seen."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly natural on their part, my dear man. You may as well admit that
  much of their case to start with."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it is rather natural. But you don't know what my people
  are like. I don't think they'll care for Helen very much. And Helen is bound
  to be nervous at meeting them. I expect we should have a pretty miserable
  Christmas if we went."</p>

  <p>"I should think in your present mood you'd have a pretty miserable
  Christmas whatever you did. And since you asked for my advice I'll give it
  you. Buck yourself up; don't let your imagination carry you away; and take
  Helen to see your people. After all, she's perfectly presentable, and since
  you've married her there's nothing to be gained by keeping her out of their
  sight, is there? Don't think I'm callous and unfeeling because I take a more
  practical view of things than you do. I'm a practical person, you see, Mr.
  Speed, and if <i>I</i> had married you I should insist on being taken to see
  your people at the earliest possible opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," she answered, "I should be anxious for them to see what an
  excellent choice you'd made."</p>

  <p>That was thoughtlessly said and thoughtfully heard. After a pause Speed
  said, curiously: "That brings one to the question&mdash;supposing I had
  married you, <i>should</i> I have made an excellent choice?"</p>

  <p>With a touch of surprise and coldness she replied:</p>

  <p>"That wasn't in my mind, Mr. Speed. You evidently misunderstood me."</p>

  <p>And at this point Helen came into the room.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">During that strange twilight hour while the three of them
  were tea-drinking and conducting a rather limp conversation about local
  matters, Speed came suddenly to the decision that he would not see Clare
  again. Partly, perhaps, because her last remark just before Helen entered had
  hurt him; he felt that she had deliberately led him into a position from
  which she could and did administer a stinging snub. But chiefly his decision
  was due to a careful and pitiful observation of Helen; he saw her in a
  dazzling white light of admiration, for she was deliberately (he could see)
  torturing herself to please him. She was acutely jealous of Clare, and yet,
  because she thought he liked Clare, she was willing to give her open
  hospitality and encouragement, despite the stab that every word and gesture
  must mean to her. It reminded him of Hans Andersen's story about the mermaid
  who danced to please her lover-prince even though each step cost her agonies.
  The pathos of it, made more apparent to him by the literary comparison,
  overwhelmed him into a blind fervour of resolution: he would do everything in
  his power to bring happiness to one who was capable of such love and such
  nobility. And as Helen thus swung into the focus of his heroine-worship, so
  Clare, without his realising it, took up in his mind the other inevitable
  position in the triangle; she was something, at least, of the adventuress,
  scheming to lure his affections away from his brave little wife. The fact
  that he was not conscious of this conventional outlook upon the situation
  prevented his reason from assuring him that Clare, so far from scheming to
  lure his affections from Helen, had just snubbed him unmercifully for a
  remark which any capable adventuress would have rejoiced over.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he decided there and then, he would put a stop to this tangled and
  uncomfortable situation. And after tea, when Helen, on a pretext which he
  knew quite well to be a fabrication, left him alone again with Clare, he
  could think of no better method of procedure than a straightforward
  request.</p>

  <p>So he summed up the necessary determination to begin: "Miss Harrington, I
  hope you won't be offended at what I'm going to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whereat she interrupted: "Oh, I don't often take offence at what people
  <i>say</i>. So please don't be frightened."</p>

  <p>"You see..." He paused, watching her. He noticed, curiously enough for the
  first time, that she was&mdash;well, not perhaps pretty, but
  certainly&mdash;in a way-attractive. In the firelight especially, she seemed
  to have the most searching and diabolically disturbing eyes. They made him
  nervous. At last he continued: "You see, I'm in somewhat of a dilemma. A
  quandary, as it were. In fact&mdash;in fact I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Supposing we use our ordinary English language and say that you're in a
  mess, eh? 'Quandary'! 'Dilemma'!" She laughed with slight contempt.</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;I don't quite see the point of&mdash;of
  your&mdash;objection," he said, staring at her with a certain' puzzled
  ruefulness. "What has my choice of a word got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"To do with what?" she replied, instantly.</p>

  <p>"With what&mdash;with what we're going to talk about."</p>

  <p>"Since I haven't the faintest idea what we're going to talk about, how can
  I say?"</p>

  <p>"Look here!" He got up out of his chair and stood with his back to the
  fire. He kept a fretful silence for a moment and then said, with a sharp
  burst of exasperation: "Look here, I don't know what you're driving at! I
  only know that you're being most infernally rude!"</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that a moment ago you were asking me not to take
  offence."</p>

  <p>"You're damned clever, aren't you?" he almost snarled.</p>

  <p>That was all he could think of in the way of an answer to her. He stood
  there swaying lightly in front of the fire, nursing, as it were, his angry
  bafflement.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she replied. "I regard that as a very high attribute. And I'm
  nearly as pleased at one other thing-I seem to have shaken you partly out of
  your delightful and infuriating urbanity...But now, we're not here to
  compliment each other. You've got something you want to say to me, haven't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her severely and said: "Yes, I have. I want to ask you not to
  come here any more."</p>

  <p>"Why?" She shot the word out at him almost before he had finished
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Because I don't wish you to."</p>

  <p>"You forget that I come at Helen's invitation, not at yours."</p>

  <p>"I see I shall have to tell you the real reason, then. I would have
  preferred not to have done. My wife is jealous of you."</p>

  <p>He expected her to show great surprise, but the surprise was his when she
  replied almost casually: "Oh yes, she was jealous of <i>you</i> once-that
  first evening we met at the Head's house&mdash;do you remember?"</p>

  <p>No, he did not remember. At least, he did now that she called it to his
  memory, but he had not remembered until then. Curious...</p>

  <p>He was half-disappointed that she was so calm and unconcerned about it
  all. He had anticipated some sort of a scene, either of surprise, remorse,
  indignation, or sympathy. Instead of which she just said "Oh, yes," and
  indulged in some perfectly irrelevant reminiscence.</p>

  <p>Well, not perhaps irrelevant, but certainly inappropriate in the
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on, hating her blindly because she was so serene; "you
  see she generously invites you here, because she thinks I like you to come.
  Well, of course, I do, but then, I don't want to make it hard for her. You
  understand what I mean? I think it is very generous of her to&mdash;to act as
  she does."</p>

  <p>"I think it is very foolish unless she has the idea that in time she can
  conquer her jealousy...But I quite understand, Mr. Speed. I won't come any
  more."</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately I have other things to think about. I assure you I'm not
  troubling at all. Even loss of friendship&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But," he interrupted eagerly, "surely it's not going to mean that, Miss
  Harrington? Just because you don't come here doesn't mean that you and
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laughed in his face as she replied, cutting short his remarks: "My
  dear Mr. Speed, you are too much of an egoist. It wasn't your friendship I
  was thinking about&mdash;it was Helen's. You forget that I've been Helen's
  friend for ten years...Well, goodbye..."</p>

  <p>The last straw! He shook hands with her stiffly.</p>

  <p>When she had gone his face grew hard and solemn, and he clenched his fists
  as he stood again with his back to the fire. He felt&mdash;the word
  <i>came</i> to his mind was a staggering inevitability-he felt <i>dead</i>.
  Absolutely <i>dead</i>. And all because she had gone and he knew that she
  would not come again.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Those were the dark days of the winter term, when Burton
  came round the dormitories at half-past seven in the mornings and lit all the
  flaring gas-jets. There was a cold spell at the beginning of December when it
  was great fun to have to smash the film of ice on the top of the water in the
  water-jugs, and one afternoon the school got an extra half-holiday to go
  skating on one of the neighbouring fens that had been flooded and frozen
  over. Now Speed could skate very well, even to the point of figure-skating
  and a few easy tricks, and he took a very simple and human delight in
  exhibiting his prowess before the Millstead boys. He possessed a good deal of
  that very charming boyish pride in athletic achievement which is so often
  mistaken for modesty, and there was no doubt that the reports of his
  accomplishments on the wide expanse of Dinglay Fen gave a considerable fillip
  to his popularity in the school.</p>

  <p>A popularity, by the way, which was otherwise very distinctly on the wane.
  He knew it, felt it as anyone might have felt it, and perhaps, additionally,
  as only he in all the world could feel it; it was the dark spectre in his
  life. He loved success; he was prepared to fight the sternest of battles
  provided they were victories on the road of progress; but to see his power
  slipping from him elusively and without commotion of any kind, was the sort
  of thing his soul was not made to endure. Fears grew up in him and
  exaggerated reality. He imagined all kinds of schemes and conspiracies
  against him in his own House. The enigma of the Head became suddenly resolved
  into a sinister hostility to himself. If a boy passed him in the road with a
  touch of the cap and a "Good morning" he would ask himself whether the words
  contained any ominous subtlety of meaning. And when, on rare occasions, he
  dined in the Masters' Common-Room he could be seen to feel hostility rising
  in clouds all about him, hostility that would not speak or act, that was
  waiting mute for the signal to uprise.</p>

  <p>He was glad that the term was nearly over, not, he told himself, because
  he was unhappy at Millstead, but because he needed a holiday after the hard
  work of his first term of housemastership. The next term, he decided, would
  be easier; and the term after that easier still, and so on, until a time
  would come when his work at Millstead would be exactly the ideal combination
  of activity and comfort. Moreover, the next term he would not see Clare at
  all. He had made up his mind about that. It would be easier to see her not at
  all than to see her only a little. And with the absolute snapping of his
  relations with her would come that which he desired most in all the world;
  happiness with Helen. He wanted to be happy with Helen. He wanted to love her
  passionately, just as he wanted to hate Clare passionately. For it was Clare
  who had caused all the trouble. He hugged the comfortable thought to himself;
  it was Clare, and Clare only, who had so far disturbed the serenity of his
  world. Without Clare his world would have been calm and unruffled, a paradise
  of contentment and love of Helen.</p>

  <p>Well, next term, anyway, his world should be without Clare.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">On the day that term ended he felt quite boyish and
  cheerful. For during that final week he and Helen had been, he considered,
  perfectly happy; moreover, she had agreed to go with him to his parents for
  Christmas, and though the visit would, in some sense, be an ordeal, the
  anticipation of it was distinctly pleasant. Somehow&mdash;he would not
  analyse his sensation exactly&mdash;somehow he wanted to leave the
  creeper-hung rooms at Lavery's and charge full tilt into the world outside;
  it was as if Lavery's contained something morbidly beautiful that he loved
  achingly, but desired to leave in order that he might return to love it more
  and again. When he saw the railway vans being loaded up with luggage in the
  courtyard he felt himself tingling with excitement, just as if he were a
  schoolboy and this the close of his first miserable term. Miserable! Well,
  yes, looking back upon it he could agree that in a certain way it had been
  miserable, and in another way it had been splendid, rapturous, and lovely. It
  had been full, brimming full, of <i>feelings</i>. The feelings had whirled
  tirelessly about him in the dark drawing-room, had wrapped him amidst
  themselves, had tossed him high and low to the most dizzy heights and the
  most submerged depths; and now, aching from it all, he was not sorry to leave
  for a short while this world of pressing, congesting sensation.</p>

  <p>He even caught himself looking forward to his visit to his parents, a
  thing he had hardly ever done before. For his parents were, he had always
  considered, "impossible" parents, good and generous enough in their way, but
  "impossible" from his point of view. They were&mdash;he hesitated to use the
  word "vulgar," because that word implied so many things that they certainly
  were not-he would use instead the rather less insulting word "materialist."
  They lived in a world that was full of "things "&mdash;soap-factories and
  cars and Turkey carpets and gramophones and tennis-courts. Moreover, they
  were almost disgustingly wealthy, and their wealth had followed him doggedly
  about wherever he had tried to escape from it. They had regarded his taking a
  post in a public-school as a kind of eccentric wild oats, and did not doubt
  that, sooner or later, he would come to his senses and prefer one or other of
  the various well-paid business posts that Sir Charles Speed could get for
  him. Oh, yes, undoubtedly they were impossible people. And yet their very
  impossibility would be a relief from the tensely charged atmosphere of
  Lavery's.</p>

  <p>On the train he chatted gaily to Helen and gave her some indication of the
  sort of people his parents were. "You mustn't be nervous of them," he warned
  her.</p>

  <p>"They've pots of money, but they're not people to get nervous about. Dad's
  all right if you stick up for yourself in front of him, and mother's nice to
  everybody whether she likes them or not. So you'll be quite safe...and if it
  freezes there'll be ice on the Marsh-pond..."</p>

  <p>At the thought of this last possibility his face kindled with
  anticipation. "Cold, Helen?" he queried, and when she replied "Yes, rather,"
  he said jubilantly: "I shouldn't be surprised if it's started to freeze
  already."</p>

  <p>Then for many minutes he gazed out through the carriage window at the
  pleasant monotony of the Essex countryside, and in a short while he felt her
  head against his shoulder. She was sleeping. "I <i>do</i> love her!" he
  thought triumphantly, giving her a side-glance. And then the sight of a pond
  with a thin coating of ice gave him another sort of triumph.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>INTERLUDE. CHRISTMAS AT BEACHINGS OVER</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"Beachings Over, near Framlingay, Essex. Tel. Framlingay 32.
  Stations: Framlingay 2½ miles; Pumphrey Bassett 3 miles."</p>

  <p>So ran the inscription on Lady Speed's opulent bluish notepaper. The house
  was an old one, unobtrusively modernised, with about a half-mile of upland
  carriage-drive leading to the portico. As Helen saw it from the window of the
  closed Daimler that had met them at Framlingay station, her admiration
  secured momentary advantage of her nervousness.</p>

  <p>In another moment Speed was introducing her to his mother.</p>

  <p>Lady Speed was undoubtedly a fine woman. "Fine" was exactly the right word
  for her, for she was just a little too elderly to be called beautiful and
  perhaps too tall ever to have been called pretty. Though she was upright and
  clear-skinned and finely-featured, and although the two decades of her
  married life had seemed to leave very little conspicuous impression on her,
  yet there was a sense, perhaps, in which she looked her age; it might have
  been guessed rightly as between forty and fifty. She had blue eyes of that
  distinctively English hue that might almost be the result of gazing
  continually upon miles and miles of rolling English landscape; and her nose,
  still attractively <i>retrousse</i>, though without a great deal of the
  pertness it must have had in her youth, held just enough of patricianly
  bearing to enable her to manage competently the twenty odd domestics whose
  labours combined to make Beachings Over habitable.</p>

  <p>She kissed Helen warmly. "My dear, I'm so pleased to meet you. But you'll
  have to rough it along with us, you know&mdash;I'm afraid we don't live at
  all in style. We're just ordinary country folks, that's all...And when you've
  had your lunch and got refreshed I must take you over the house and show you
  everything..."</p>

  <p>Speed laughed and said: "Mother always tells visitors that they've got to
  rough it. But there's nothing to rough. I wonder what she'd say if she had to
  live three months at Lavery's."</p>

  <p>"Lavery's?" said Lady Speed, uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"Lavery's is the name of my House at Millstead. I was made housemaster of
  it at the beginning of the term." He spoke a little proudly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I seem to know the name. I believe your father was mentioning
  something about it to me once, but I hardly remember&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how on earth did he know anything about it? I never wrote telling
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well, I expect he heard it from somebody...I really couldn't tell you
  exactly...I've had a most awful morning before you came&mdash;had to dismiss
  one of the maids&mdash;she'd stolen a thermos-flask. So ungrateful of her,
  because I'd have given it to her if she'd only asked me for it. One of my
  best maids, she was."</p>

  <p>After lunch Richard arrived. Richard was Speed's younger brother, on
  vacation from school; a pleasant-faced, rather ordinary youngster, obviously
  prepared to enter the soap-boiling industry as soon as he left school. In the
  afternoon Richard conducted the pair of them round the grounds and
  outbuildings, showing them the new Italian garden and the pergola and the new
  sunken lawn and the clock-tower built over the garage and the new gas-engine
  to work the electric light plant and the new pavilion alongside the rubble
  tennis courts and the new wing of the servants' quarters that "dad" was
  "throwing out" from the end of the old coach-house. Then, when they returned
  indoors, Lady Speed was ready to conduct them over the interior and show them
  the panelled bedrooms and the lacquered cabinets in the music-room and the
  bathroom with a solid silver bath and the gramophone worked by electricity
  and the wonderful old-fashioned bureau that somebody had offered to buy off
  "dad" for fifteen hundred guineas.</p>

  <p>"Visitors always have to go through it," said Speed, when his mother had
  left them. "Personally I'm never the least bit impressed, and I can't
  understand anyone else being it."</p>

  <p>Helen answered, rather doubtfully: "But it's a lovely house, Kenneth,
  isn't it? I'd no idea your people were like this."</p>

  <p>"Like what?"</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;so well-off."</p>

  <p>"Oh, then the display <i>has</i> impressed you?" He laughed and said,
  quietly: "I'd rather have our own little place at Lavery's, wouldn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>While he was saying it he felt: Yes, I'd rather have it, no doubt, but to
  be there now would make me utterly miserable.</p>

  <p>She replied softly: "Yes, because it's our own."</p>

  <p>He pondered a moment and then said: "Yes, I suppose that's one of the
  reasons why <i>I</i> would."</p>

  <p>After a pleasant tea in the library he took Helen into the music-room,
  where he played Chopin diligently for half-an-hour and then, by special
  request of Richard, ran over some of the latest revue songs. Towards seven
  o'clock Lady Speed sailed in to remind Richard that it was getting near
  dinner-time. "I wish you'd run upstairs and change your clothes,
  dear&mdash;you know father doesn't like you to come in to dinner in
  tweeds...You know," she went on, turning to Helen, "Charles isn't a bit
  fussy&mdash;none of us trouble to really <i>dress</i> for dinner, except when
  we're in town&mdash;only&mdash;only you have to put a limit somewhere,
  haven't you?"</p>

  <p>As the hour for dinner approached it seemed as if a certain mysteriously
  incalculable imminence were in the air, as if the whole world of Beachings
  Over were steeling itself in readiness for some searching and stupendous test
  of its worth. It was, indeed, ten minutes past eight when the sound of a
  motor-horn was heard in, the far distance. "That's Edwards," cried Lady
  Speed, apprehensively. "He always sounds his horn to let us know...Now, Dick
  dear, don't let him know we've been waiting for him-you know how he hates to
  think he's late..."</p>

  <p>And in another moment a gruff voice in the hall could be heard dismissing
  the chauffeur with instructions for the morrow. "Ten-thirty sharp, Edwards.
  The Daimler if it's wet. Gotter go over and see Woffenheimer."</p>

  <p>And in yet another moment Lady Speed was rushing forward with an eager,
  wifely kiss. "You aren't late, Charles. All the clocks are a little
  fast...Kenneth has come...and this..." she spoke a trifle nervously..."this
  is Helen..."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles distributed a gruff nod to the assembly, afterwards holding
  out his hand to be shaken. "Ahdedoo, Kenneth, my lad...How are you? Still
  kicking eh?...Ahdedoo, Helen...don't mind me calling you Helen, do you? Well,
  Richard, my lad..."</p>

  <p>A bald-headed, moustached, white-spatted, morning-coated man, Sir Charles
  Speed.</p>

  <p>Dinner opened in an atmosphere of gloomy silence. Lady Speed kept
  inaugurating conversations that petered out into a stillness that was broken
  only by Sir Charles' morose ingurgitation of soup. Something was obviously
  amiss with him. Over the <i>entrée</i> it came out.</p>

  <p>"Had to sack one of the foremen to-day."</p>

  <p>Lady Speed looked up with an appropriate gesture of horror and
  indignation. "And I had to dismiss one of <i>my</i> maids too! What a curious
  coincidence! How ungrateful people are!"</p>

  <p>"Sneaking timber out of the woodyard," continued Sir Charles, apparently
  without the least interest in his wife's adventure with the maid.</p>

  <p>But with the trouble of the sacked foreman off his chest Sir Charles
  seemed considerably relieved, though his gloom returned when Richard had the
  misfortune to refer to one of the "fellows" at his school as "no class at
  all&mdash;an absolute outsider."</p>

  <p>"See here, my lad," exclaimed Sir Charles, holding up his fork with a
  peach on the end of it, "don't you ever let me hear you talking <i>that</i>
  sort of nonsense! Don't you forget that <i>I</i> started life as an
  office-boy cleaning out inkwells!" Richard flushed deeply and Lady Speed
  looked rather uncomfortable. "Don't you forget it," added Sir Charles,
  mouthing characteristically, and it was clear that he was speaking
  principally for the benefit of Helen. "I don't want people to think I am what
  I'm not. If I hadn't been lucky&mdash;and&mdash;and" he seemed to experience
  a difficulty in choosing the right adjective&mdash;"and
  <i>smart&mdash;smart</i>, mind&mdash;I might have been still cleaning out
  ink-wells. See?" He filled up his glass with port and for a moment there was
  sultry silence again. Eventually, he licked his lips and broke it. "You
  know," turning to address Kenneth, "it's all this education that's at the
  root of the trouble. Makes the workers too big for their shoes, as often as
  not...Mind you, I'm a democrat, I am. Can't abide snobbery at any price. But
  I don't believe in all this education business. I paid for you at Cambridge
  and what's it done for you? You go an' get a job in some stuffy little school
  or other&mdash;salary about two hundred a year&mdash;and God knows how long
  you'd stay there without a promotion if I hadn't given somebody the tip to
  shove you up!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Kenneth exclaimed, almost under his breath.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles appeared not to have heard the interruption. He went on,
  warming to his subject and addressing an imaginary disputant: "No, sir, I do
  <i>not</i> believe in what is termed Education in this country. It don't help
  a man to rise if he hasn't got it in him...Why, look at <i>me</i>! I got on
  without education. Don't you suppose other lads, if they're smart enough, can
  do the same? Don't you think I'm an example of what a man can become when
  he's had no education?"</p>

  <p>The younger Speed nodded. The argument was irrefutable.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">After dinner Speed managed to get his father alone in the
  library. "I want to know," he said, quietly, "what you meant when you said
  something about giving somebody the tip to shove me up. I want to know
  exactly, mind."</p>

  <p>Sir Charles waved his arm across a table.</p>

  <p>"Don't you talk to me like that, my lad. I'm too old for you to
  cross-examine I'm willin' to tell you anythin' you like, only I won't be
  bullied into it. So now you know. Light yourself a cigar an', for God's sake,
  sit down and look comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could look it if I felt it."</p>

  <p>"Your own fault if you don't feel it. Damned ingratitude, I call it. Sit
  down. I shan't answer a question till you're sitting down and smoking as if
  you was a friend of mine an' not a damned commercial traveller."</p>

  <p>Speed decided that he had better humour him; he sat down and toyed with a
  cigar. "Now, if you'll please tell me."</p>

  <p>"What is it you want me to tell you?" grunted Sir Charles.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me what you meant by saying that you gave somebody a
  tip to shove me up?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my lad, you don't want to stay an assistant-master all your life,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>"That's not the point. I want to know what you did."</p>

  <p>"Why, I did the usual thing that I'd always do to help somebody I'm
  interested in."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>you</i> know. Pull a few wires...Man like me has a few wires he
  can pull. I <i>know</i> people, you see&mdash;and if I just mention a little
  thing&mdash;well, they generally remember it all right."</p>

  <p>And he spread himself luxuriously in the arm-chair and actually
  smiled!</p>

  <p>The other flushed hotly. "I see. May I ask whose help you solicited on my
  behalf?"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like a melodrama, my lad. I'm your best friend if you only
  knew it. What is it you want to know now?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know whose help you asked for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had a little conversation with Lord Port-way. And I had five
  minutes' chat over the telephone with old Ervine. Don't you see "&mdash;he
  leaned forward with a touch of pleading in his voice&mdash;"don't you see
  that I want you to <i>get</i> on? I've always wanted you to do well in the
  world. Your brother's doing well and there's not a prouder father in England
  to-day than I am of him. And when young Richard leaves school I hope he'll
  get on well too. Now, you're a bit different. Dunno why you are, but you are,
  an' I've always recognised it. You can't say I've ever tried to force you to
  anythin' you didn't want, can you? You wanted to go to the
  'varsity&mdash;well, I don't believe it's a good thing for a young man to
  waste his years till he's twenty-two&mdash;nevertheless it was your choice,
  an' I let you do it. I paid for you, I gave you as much money as you wanted,
  an' I didn't complain. Well, then you wanted to be a Master in a school. You
  got yourself the job without even consulting me about it, but did I complain?
  No, I let you go your own way. I let you do what I considered an absolutely
  damsilly thing. Still, I thought, if you're going to be a teacher you may as
  well have ambitions an' rise to the top of the profession. So I thought I'd
  just put in a word for you. That was all. I want you to <i>get on</i>, my
  lad, no matter what line you're in. I've always bin as ambitious for you as I
  have bin for myself."</p>

  <p>The other said: "I can see you meant well."</p>

  <p>"<i>Meant well</i>? And is it extraordinary that I should mean well to my
  own son? Then, there's another thing. You go and get married. Well, I don't
  mind that. I believe in marriage. I was married myself when I was nineteen
  an' I've never once regretted it. But you go an' get married all of a hurry
  while I'm travellin' the other side o' the world, an' you don't even send me
  so much as a bit o' weddin'-cake! I don't say: is it <i>fair</i>? I just say:
  is it <i>natural</i>? I come home to England to find a letter tellin' me
  you've married the Headmaster's daughter!"</p>

  <p>"Well, why shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sayin' you shouldn't, my lad. I'm not a snob, an' I don't care
  who you marry s'long as she's as good as you are. I don't want you to marry a
  duchess. I don't even care if the girl you marry hasn't a cent. See&mdash;I
  don't mind if she's a dustman's daughter, s'long&mdash;s'long, mind, as she's
  your equal! That's all. Now you understand me. <i>Do</i> you?"</p>

  <p>"I think I understand you."</p>

  <p>"Good. Now have some more port. An' while you're spendin' Christmas with
  us, for God's sake, have a good time and give the girl a good time, too. Is
  she fond of theatres?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;well&mdash;she might be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you can have the closed Daimler any night you like to take you into
  town and bring you back. And if she's fond of motorin' you can have the
  Sunbeam durin' the daytime. Remember that. I want you to have a dam' good
  time...Dam' good...See? Now have some more port before we join your
  mother..."</p>

  <p>"No thanks. I should be drunk if I had any more."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my lad. Port won' make you drunk. Dam' good port, isn'
  it?...Wouldn' make you drunk, though...Don' talk dam' nonsense to me..."</p>

  <p>He was slightly drunk himself.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">That interview with his father had a disturbing effect upon
  Speed. He had expected a row in which his father would endeavour to tyrannise
  over him, instead of which Sir Charles, if there had been any argument at
  all, had certainly got the better of it. In a sort of way it did seem rather
  unfair to have married without letting his parents know a word about it
  beforehand. But, of course, there had been good reasons. First, the
  housemastership. He couldn't have been given Lavery's unless he had married.
  Ervine had stressed very strongly the desirability of married housemasters.
  And it had therefore been necessary to do everything rather hurriedly in
  order to be able to begin at Lavery's in the September.</p>

  <p>It was when he reflected that, but for his father's intervention, he would
  probably never have been offered Lavery's that he felt the keenest feeling of
  unrest. The more he thought about it the more manifestly certain incidents in
  the past became explainable to him. The hostility of the Common-Room for
  instance. Did they guess the sort of "wire-pulling" that had been going on?
  Probably they did not know anything definitely, but wasn't it likely that
  they would conclude that such a startling appointment must have been the
  result of some ulterior intrigue? And wasn't it natural that they should be
  jealous of him?</p>

  <p>He hated Ervine because, behind all the man's kindness to him, he saw now
  merely the ignoble desire to placate influence. Ervine had done it all to
  please his father. It was galling to think that that adulatory speech on the
  Prize-Day, which had given him such real and genuine pleasure, had been
  dictated merely by a willingness to serve the whim of an important man. It
  was galling to think that Lord Portway's smiles and words of commendation had
  been similarly motivated. It was galling to think that, however reticent he
  was about being the son of Sir Charles Speed, the relationship seemed fated
  to project itself into his career in the most unfortunate and detestable of
  ways.</p>

  <p>Then he thought of Helen. Her motives, of all, were pure and untainted;
  she shared neither her father's sycophancy nor his own father's
  unscrupulousness. She had married him for no other reason than that she loved
  him. And in the midst of the haze of indecent revelations that seemed to be
  enveloping him, her love for him and his for her brightened like stars when
  the night deepens.</p>

  <p>And then, slowly and subtly at first, came even the suspicion of her. Was
  it possible that she had been the dupe of her father? Was it possible that
  Ervine very neatly and cleverly had Sir Charles hoist with his own petard,
  making the young housemaster of Lavery's at the same time his own son-in-law?
  And if so, had Helen played up to the game? The thought tortured him evilly.
  He felt it to be such an ignoble one that he must never breathe it to Helen,
  lest it should be utterly untrue. Yet to keep it to himself was not the best
  way of getting rid of it. It grew within him like a cancer; it filled all the
  unoccupied niches of his mind; it made him sick with apprehension.</p>

  <p>And then, at last, on Christmas Eve he was cruel to her. There had been a
  large party at Beachings Over and she had been very shy and nervous all the
  evening. And now, after midnight, when they had gone up to their bedroom, he
  said, furiously: "What was the matter with you all to-night?"</p>

  <p>She said: "Nothing."</p>

  <p>He said: "Funny reason for not speaking a word all the evening. Whatever
  must people have thought of you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I told you I should be nervous. I can't help it. You
  shouldn't have brought me if you hadn't been prepared for it."</p>

  <p>"You might have at least said you'd got a headache and gone off to
  bed."</p>

  <p>She said, frightenedly: "Oh, Kenneth, Kenneth, what's the
  matter&mdash;<i>why</i> are you talking to me like this?"</p>

  <p>"I hope I'm not being unfair," he replied, imperturbably.</p>

  <p>She flung herself on the bed and began to sob.</p>

  <p>He went on unfastening his dress tie and thinking: She married me because
  my father has money. She married me because her father told her to. She
  schemed to get me. The housemastership was a plant to get me married to her
  before I knew whether I really wanted her or not.</p>

  <p>He was carefully silent the whole rest of the night, though it was hard to
  lie awake and hear her sobbing.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">The next evening, Christmas Day, there was another party.
  She looked rather pale and unhappy, but he saw she was trying to be lively.
  He felt acutely sorry for her, and yet, whenever he felt in the mood to
  relent, he fortified his mind by thinking of her duplicity. He thought of
  other things besides her duplicity. He thought of her stupidity. Why was she
  so stupid? Why had he married a woman who couldn't gossip at a small
  Christmas party without being nervous? Why had he married a woman who never
  spoke at table unless she were spoken to? Other women said the silliest
  things and they sounded ordinary; Helen, forcing herself in sheer desperation
  to do so, occasionally said the most ordinary things and they sounded silly.
  If she ventured on any deliberate remark the atmosphere was always as if the
  whole world had stopped moving in order to see her make a fool of herself;
  what she said was probably no more foolish than what anybody else might have
  said, yet somehow it seemed outlined against the rest of the conversation as
  a piece of stark, unmitigated lunacy. Speed found himself holding his breath
  when she began to speak.</p>

  <p>After the rest of the party had gone away he went into the library for a
  cigarette. Helen had gone up to bed; it was past two o'clock, but he felt
  very wakeful and disturbed. The morning-room adjoined the library, and as he
  sat smoking by the remains of the fire, he heard conversation. He heard his
  father's gruff voice saying: "God knows, Fanny, I don't."</p>

  <p>A remark apposite to a great many subjects, he reflected, with a
  half-smile. He had no intention to eavesdrop, but he did not see why he
  should move away merely because they were talking so loudly about some
  probably unimportant topic that their voices carried into the next room.</p>

  <p>Then he heard his mother say: "I think she means well, Charles. Probably
  she's not used to the kind of life here."</p>

  <p>His father replied: "Oh, I could tell if it was just that. What I think is
  that she's a silly little empty-headed piece of goods, an' I'd like to know
  what the devil that fool of a boy sees in her!"</p>

  <p>The blood rushed to his cheeks and temples; he gripped the arms of his
  chair, listening intently now to every word, with no thought of the right or
  wrong of it.</p>

  <p>The conversation went on.</p>

  <p>"She's more intelligent when you get her alone, Charles. And I'm rather
  afraid you frighten her too."</p>

  <p>"Frighten her be damned. If she'd any guts in her she'd like me. The right
  sort of women always do like me."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she does like you. That wouldn't stop her from being frightened
  of you, would it? I'm frightened of you myself, sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Don't say damsilly things to me, Fanny. All I say is, I'm not a snob, an'
  I've always felt I'd let all my lads choose for themselves absolutely in a
  matter like marriage. But I've always hoped and trusted that they'd marry
  somebody worth marryin'. I told the boy the other night&mdash;if he'd married
  a dustman's daughter I'd have welcomed her if she'd been pretty or clever or
  smart or something or other about her."</p>

  <p>"But Charles, she <i>is</i> pretty."</p>

  <p>"Think so? Not my style, anyway. An' what's prettiness when there's
  nothing else? I like a girl with her wits about her, smart business-like sort
  o' girl, pretty if you like-all the better if she is&mdash;but a girl that
  needn't depend on her looks. Why, I'd rather the lad have married my typist
  than that silly little thing! Fact, I've a few factory girls I'd rather have
  had for a daughter-in-law than the one I've got!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's no good troubling about it, Charles. He's done it now, and if
  he can put up with her I think we ought to. She's fond enough of him, I
  should think."</p>

  <p>"Good God, she ought to be! Probably she's got enough sense to know what's
  a bargain, anyway."</p>

  <p>"I think you're a bit too severe, Charles. After all, we've only seen her
  for a week."</p>

  <p>"Well, Fanny, answer me a straight question&mdash;are <i>you</i> really
  pleased with her?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't say I am, but I realise we've got to make the best of her.
  After all, men do make silly mistakes, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Over women they do, that's a fact...You know, it's just struck
  me&mdash;that old chap Ervine's played a dam' smart game."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I bet he put her on to it. I thought I was getting somethin' out of him
  when I had that talk over the 'phone, but I'll acknowledge he's gone one
  better on me. Smart man, Ervine. I like a smart man, even if it's me he puts
  it across. I like him better than his daughter."</p>

  <p>"I should hate him. I think the whole business is dreadful. Perfectly
  dreadful...Did you tell Rogers he could go to bed?...I said breakfast at
  nine-thirty...yes, ten if you like..."</p>

  <p>The voices trailed off into the distance.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">He crept up the stairs carefully, trying not to let them
  creak. At the landing outside his room he paused, looking out of the window.
  It was a night full of beautiful moonlight, and on the new clock-tower over
  the garage the weather-vane glinted like a silver arrow. Snow lay in patches
  against the walls, and the pools amidst the cobble-stones in the courtyard
  were filmed over with thin ice. As he looked out upon the scene the clock
  chimed the quarter.</p>

  <p>He took a few paces back and turned the handle of the door. He felt
  frightened to enter. What should he say to her? Would she be in bed and
  asleep? Would she be pretending to be asleep? Should he say nothing at all,
  but wait till morning, when he had thought it all over?</p>

  <p>He switched on the light and saw that she was in bed. He saw her golden
  hair straggling forlornly over the pillow. Something in that touched him, and
  suspicion, always on guard against the softness of his heart, struck at him
  with a sudden stab. She had plotted. She was a schemer. The forlorn spread of
  her hair over the pillow was part of the duplicity of her.</p>

  <p>He hardened. He said, very quietly and calmly: "Are you awake, Helen?"</p>

  <p>The hair moved and shook itself. "Kenneth!"</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you."</p>

  <p>"What is it, Kenneth?"</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;?&mdash;Look here&mdash;" He paused. How could he put it to
  her? If he said straight out: "Did you plot with your father to marry me?"
  she would, of course, say no. He must be careful. He must try to trap her
  without her being aware.</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;did you know that it was due to my father's influence
  that I got Lavery's?"</p>

  <p>"No, was it? It was good of your father to help you, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Stupid little fool! he thought. (Good God, that was nearly what his father
  had said she was!)</p>

  <p>He said: "He meant it kindly, no doubt. But you didn't know?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?"</p>

  <p>"I thought perhaps your father might have told you."</p>

  <p>"I was never interested in his business."</p>

  <p>Pause. A sudden sharp wave of irritation made him continue:</p>

  <p>"I say, Helen, you might remember whom you're talking to when you're at
  dinner. The Lord Randolph you were saying the uncomplimentary things about
  happens to be the cousin of the lady sitting on your left."</p>

  <p>"Really? Oh, I'm so sorry, Kenneth. I didn't know. D'you think she'd be
  offended?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think she'd trouble very much about your opinion, but the
  publicity which you gave to it would probably annoy her a little."</p>

  <p>She suddenly hid her head in her arms and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Kenneth&mdash;let's go away to-morrow! Let's go back to Millstead!
  Oh, I can't bear this any more&mdash;I've been miserable ever since I came. I
  told you it would all go wrong, Kenneth!-Kenneth, I <i>have</i> tried, but
  it's no good&mdash;I can't be happy!&mdash;Take me away tomorrow, Kenneth.
  Kenneth, if you don't I shall run away myself&mdash;I simply can't bear any
  more of it. You've hated me ever since you came here, because I don't make
  you feel proud of me. Oh, I <i>wish</i> I did&mdash;I <i>do</i> wish I could!
  But I've tried so many times-I've made myself sick with trying&mdash;and now
  that I know it's no good, let me go back to Millstead where I can give up
  trying for a while. Kenneth, be kind to me-I can't help it&mdash;I can't help
  not being all that you want me to be!"</p>

  <p>She held out her arms for him to have taken hold of, but he stood
  aside.</p>

  <p>"I think perhaps a return to Millstead would be the best thing we could
  do," he said, calmly. "We certainly don't seem to be having a very
  exhilarating time here...Breakfast is at ten, I think. That means that the
  car can take us down to catch the 11.50...I'd better 'phone Burton in the
  morning, then he can air the place for us. Would you like to dine at School
  to-morrow? I was, thinking that probably your father would invite us if he
  knew we were coming back so soon?"</p>

  <p>It was in his mind that perhaps he could scheme some trap at the Head's
  dinner-table that would enmesh them both.</p>

  <p>She said drearily: "Oh, I don't mind, Kenneth. Just whatever you
  want."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he replied, and said no more.</p>

  <p>He lay awake until he fancied it must be almost dawn, and all the time he
  was acutely miserable. He was so achingly sorry for her, and yet the
  suspicion in his mind fortified him against all kindly impulses. He felt that
  he would never again weakly give way to her, because the thought of her
  duplicity would give him strength, strength even against her tears and
  misery. And yet there was one thing the thought of her duplicity did not give
  him; it did not give him peace. It made him bitter, unrestful, angry with the
  world.</p>

  <p>And he decided, just before he went to sleep, that these new circumstances
  that had arisen justified him in taking what attitude he liked towards Clare.
  If he wanted to see her he would see her. He would no longer make sacrifices
  of his friends for Helen's sake.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>BOOK III. THE LENT TERM</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-01"
     id="ch-04-01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"The worst term uv the three, sir, that's my opinion," said
  Burton, pulling the curtains across the window at dusk.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" asked Speed, forcing himself to be
  affable.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, sir, the winter term&mdash;or, prop'ly speakin', sir, I
  should say the Michaelmas term&mdash;isn't so bad because there's the
  Christmas 'olidays to look forward to. But the Lent Term always seems to me
  to be ten times worse, because there's nothin' at the end of it to look
  forward to. Is there now, sir?"</p>

  <p>"There's the Easter holidays and the spring weather."</p>

  <p>Burton grinned. "That's if you're an optimist, sir."</p>

  <p>He was an old man, deeply attached to the school and very reliable, but
  prone to take odd liberties on the strength of age and service. Speed always
  felt that in Burton's eyes he was a youngster, hardly less a youngster than
  one of the prefects, and that Burton considered himself as the central planet
  of Lavery's round which Speed revolved as merely a satellite. The situation
  had amused him until now; but on this afternoon of the return from Beachings
  Over a whole crowd of sinister suspicions assailed him. In Burton's attitude
  he seemed to detect a certain carefully-veiled mockery; was it possible that
  Burton knew or guessed the secret of his appointment to Lavery's? Was it also
  possible that Burton had pierced through his marriage with Helen and had seen
  the sinister scheme behind it?</p>

  <p>He stared hard at Burton. The man was old in a rather theatrical way; he
  clumped about exactly like the faithful retainer in the old-fashioned
  melodrama; if you addressed him he would turn round, put one hand to his ear,
  to leer at you, and say grotesquely: "Sir?" He was the terror of all the
  housemaids, the pet of all the Junior boys, and a sort of communal butler and
  valet to the prefects. And, beyond all doubt, he was one of the sights of
  Lavery's. For the moment Speed detested him.</p>

  <p>"I say, Burton."</p>

  <p>The turn, the hand to ear, the leer, and the grotesque interrogative:
  "Sir?"</p>

  <p>"How long have you been at Millstead?"</p>

  <p>"Fifty-one year, sir, come next July. I started when I was fourteen year
  old, sir, peelin' potaties in the old kitchins that used to be underneath
  Milner's. I come to Lavery's when I was twenty-four as under-porter. I
  remember old Mr. Hardacre that wuz 'ousemaster before Mr. Lavery, Sir. Mr.
  Lavery was 'ousemaster for thirty-eight year, sir, an' a very great friend of
  mine. He came to see me only larst Toosday, sir, a-knockin' at the pantry
  door just like an old pal o' mine might. He wuz wantin' to know 'ow the old
  place was gettin' on."</p>

  <p>Speed's glance hardened. He could imagine Lavery and Burton having a
  malicious conversation about himself.</p>

  <p>Burton went on, grinning: "He was arskin' after you, Mr. Speed. I told 'im
  you wuz away spendin' the Christmas with Sir Charles and Lady Speed. An' I
  told him you wuz doin' very well an' bein' very popular, if you'll pard'n the
  liberty I took."</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," said Speed, rather coldly.</p>

  <p>When Burton had gone out he poked up the fire and pondered. Now that he
  was back at Millstead he wished he had stayed longer in Beachings Over.
  Millstead was absolutely a dead place in vacation time, and in the Christmas
  vacation nothing more dreary and uniformly depressing had ever come within
  his experience. Dr. and Mrs. Ervine, so Potter informed him, had gone to town
  for a few days and would not be back until after the New Year. None of the
  other housemasters was in residence. The huge empty footer pitches, hardly
  convalescent after the frays of the past term, were being marked off for
  hockey by the groundsman; the chapel was undergoing a slothful scrubbing by a
  platoon of chattering charwomen; the music-rooms were closed; the school
  organ was in the hands of the repairers; the clock in the chapel belfry had
  stopped, apparently because it was nobody's business to wind it up during
  vacation-time.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would freeze enough for skating on Dinglay Fen, was his most
  rapturous hope. Helen was shopping in the village, and he expected her back
  very soon. It was nearly dark now, but the groundsman was still busy. There
  was something exquisitely forlorn in that patient transference from cricket
  to footer, from footer to hockey, and then from hockey to cricket again,
  which marked the passage of the years at Millstead. He wondered how long it
  would all last. He wondered what sort of an upheaval would be required to
  change it. Would famine or pestilence or war or revolution be enough?</p>

  <p>Helen came in. It was curious that his suspicion of her, at first admitted
  to be without confirmation, had now become almost a certainty; so that he no
  longer felt inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt, or even that there
  was any doubt whose benefit he could give her.</p>

  <p>While they were having tea he suddenly decided that he would go out that
  evening alone and walk himself into a better humour. A half-whimsical
  consciousness of his own condition made him rather more kind to her; he felt
  sorry for anybody who had to put up with him in his present mood. He said: "I
  think I'll have a walk after tea, Helen. I'll be back about eight. It'll do
  me good to take some exercise."</p>

  <p>She gave him a sudden, swift, challenging look, and he could see exactly
  what was in her eyes. She thought he was going to see Clare.</p>

  <p>The thought had not been in his mind before. But now he was at the mercy
  of it; it invaded him; after all, why shouldn't he visit Clare? Furthermore,
  what right had Helen to stop him? He put on his hat and coat in secret
  tingling excitement; he would go down into the village and visit Clare.
  Curious that he hadn't thought of it before! Helen had simply no <i>right</i>
  to object. And as he turned his mind to all the suspicions that had so lately
  crowded into it, he felt that he was abundantly justified in visiting a
  friend of his, even if his wife were foolishly jealous of her.</p>

  <p>"Back about eight," he repeated, as he opened the door to go out. Somehow,
  he wanted to kiss her. He had always kissed her before going out from
  Lavery's. But now, since she made no reply to his remark, presumably she did
  not expect it.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The Millstead road was black as jet, for the moon was hidden
  behind the thickest of clouds. It was just beginning to freeze, and as he
  strode along the path by the school railings he thought of those evenings in
  the winter term when he had seen Clare home after the concert rehearsals.
  Somehow, all that seemed ages ago. The interlude at Beachings Over had given
  all the previous term the perspective of immense distance; he felt as if he
  had been housemaster at Lavery's for years, as if he had been married to
  Helen for years, and as if Clare were a friend whom he had known long years
  ago and had lost sight of since.</p>

  <p>As he reached the High Street he began to feel nervous. After all, Clare
  might not want to see him. He remembered vaguely their last interview and the
  snub she had given him. He looked further back and remembered the first time
  he had ever seen her; that dinner at the Head's house on the first evening of
  the summer term...</p>

  <p>But he could not help being nervous. He tried to think that what he was
  doing was something perfectly natural and ordinary; that he was just paying a
  call on a friend as anybody might have done on a return from a holiday. He
  was angry with himself for getting so excited about the business. And when he
  rang the bell of the side-door next to the shop he had the distinct hope that
  she would not be in.</p>

  <p>But she was in.</p>

  <p>She came to the door herself, and it was so dark outside that she could
  not see him. "Who is it?" she asked, and he replied, rather fatuously
  expecting her to recognise his voice immediately: "Me. I, hope I'm not
  disturbing you."</p>

  <p>She answered, in that characteristically unafraid way of hers: "I'm sure I
  don't know in the least who you are. Will you tell me your name?"</p>

  <p>Then he said, rather embarrassedly: "Speed, my name is."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>Such a strange surprised little "Oh?" He could not see her any more than
  she could see him, but he knew that she was startled.</p>

  <p>"Am I disturbing you?" he went on.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. You'd better come inside. There's nobody in except myself, so I
  warn you."</p>

  <p>"Warn me of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of the conventions you are breaking by coming in."</p>

  <p>"Would you rather I didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't trouble about me. It's yourself you must think about."</p>

  <p>"Very well then, I'll come in."</p>

  <p>"Right. There are five steps, then two paces along the level, and then two
  more steps. It's an old house, you see."</p>

  <p>In the dark and narrow lobby, with the front door closed behind him, and
  Clare somewhere near him in the darkness, he suddenly felt no longer nervous
  but immensely exhilarated, as if he had taken some decisive and long
  contemplated step&mdash;some step that, wise or unwise, would at least bring
  him into a new set of circumstances.</p>

  <p>Something in her matter-of-fact directions was immensely reassuring; a
  feeling of buoyancy came over him as he felt his way along the corridor with
  Clare somewhat ahead of him. She opened a door and a shaft of yellow
  lamplight came out and prodded the shadows.</p>

  <p>"My little sitting-room," she said.</p>

  <p>It was a long low-roofed apartment with curtained windows at either end.
  Persian rugs and tall tiers of bookshelves and some rather good pieces of old
  furniture gave it a deliciously warm appearance; a heavily shaded lamp was
  the sole illumination. Speed, quick to appreciate anything artistic, was
  immediately impressed; he exclaimed, on the threshold: "I say, what a
  gloriously old-fashioned room!"</p>

  <p>"Not all of it," she answered quietly. She turned the shade of the lamp so
  that its rays focussed themselves on a writing-desk in an alcove. "The
  typewriter and the telephone are signs that I am not at all an old-fashioned
  person."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say that, did I?" he replied, smiling.</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Please sit down and be comfortable. It's nice to have such
  an unexpected call. And I'm glad that though I'm banned from Lavery's you
  don't consider yourself banned from here."</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said. He was surprised that she had broached the question so
  directly. He flushed slightly and went on, after a pause: "I think perhaps
  the ban had better be withdrawn altogether."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;well, it doesn't matter&mdash;I didn't come here to talk
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you did. That's just what you did come here to talk about.
  Either that or something more serious. You don'ts mean to tell me that you
  pay an unconventional call like this just to tell me what an enjoyable
  holiday you've had."</p>

  <p>"I didn't have an enjoyable holiday at all," he answered.</p>

  <p>"There! I guessed as much! After all, you wouldn't have come home so soon
  if you'd been having a thoroughly good time, would you?"</p>

  <p>"Helen wanted to come home."</p>

  <p>She ceased her raillery of him and went suddenly serious. For some time
  she stared into the fire without speaking, and then, in a different tone of
  voice altogether she said: "Why did she want to come home?"</p>

  <p>He began to talk rather fast and staccato. "I&mdash;I don't know whether I
  ought to tell you this&mdash;except that you were Helen's friend and can
  perhaps help me...You see, Helen was very nervous the whole time, and there
  were one or two dinner-parties, and she&mdash;well, not exactly put her foot
  in it, you know, but was&mdash;well, rather obviously out of everything. I
  don't know how it is&mdash;she seems quite unable to converse in the ordinary
  way that people do&mdash;I don't mean anything brilliant&mdash;few people
  converse brilliantly&mdash;what I mean is that&mdash;well, she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted: "You mean that when her neighbour says, 'Have you heard
  Caruso in Carmen?'&mdash;she hasn't got the sense to reply: 'Oh, yes, isn't
  he simply gorgeous?'"</p>

  <p>"That's a rather satirical way of putting it."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway, it seems a small reason for coming home. If I were
  constitutionally incapable of sustaining dinner-party small-talk and my
  husband brought me away from his parents for that reason, I'd leave him for
  good."</p>

  <p>"I didn't bring her away. She begged me to let her go."</p>

  <p>"Then you must have been cruel to her. You must have made her think that
  it mattered."</p>

  <p>"Well, doesn't it matter?"</p>

  <p>She laughed a little harshly. "What a different man you're becoming, Mr.
  Speed! Before you married Helen you knew perfectly well that she was horribly
  nervous in front of strangers and that she'd never show off well at rather
  tiresome society functions. And yet if I or anybody else had dared to suggest
  that it mattered you'd have been most tremendously indignant. You used to
  think her nervousness rather charming, in fact."</p>

  <p>He said, rather pathetically: "You've cornered me, I confess. And I
  suppose I'd better tell you the real reason. Helen's nervousness doesn't
  matter to me. It never has mattered and it doesn't matter now. It wasn't
  that, or rather, that would never have annoyed me but for something
  infinitely more serious. While I was at home I found out about my appointment
  at Lavery's."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about it?"</p>

  <p>"It was my father got it for me. He interviewed Portway and Ervine and God
  knows who else."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well?&mdash;Do you think I <i>like</i> to be dependent on that sort of
  help? Do you think I like to remember all the kind things that people at
  Millstead have said about me, and to feel that they weren't sincere, that
  they were simply the result of a little of my father's wire-pulling?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"I left home," he went on, "because my father wanted to shove me into a
  nice comfortable job in a soap-works. I wanted to earn my own living on my
  own merits. And then, when I manage to get free, he thoughtfully steps in
  front of me, so to speak, and without my knowing it, makes the path smooth
  for me!"</p>

  <p>"What an idealist you are, Mr. Speed!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"An idealist. So innocent of the world! Personally, I think your father's
  action extremely kind. And also I regard your own condition as one of babyish
  innocence. Did you really suppose that an unknown man, aged twenty-three,
  with a middling degree, and only one moderately successful term's experience,
  would be offered the Mastership of the most important House at Millstead,
  unless there'd been a little private manoeuvring behind the scenes? Did you
  think that, in the ordinary course of nature, a man like Ervine would be only
  too willing to set you up in Lavery's with his daughter for a wife?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's it! He wanted me to marry Helen, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"My dear man, wasn't it perfectly obvious that he did? All through last
  summer term you kept meeting her in the school grounds and behaving in a
  manner for which any other Master would have been instantly sacked, and all
  he did was to smile and be nice and keep inviting you to dinner!"</p>

  <p>Speed cried excitedly: "Yes, that's what my father said. He said it was a
  plant; that Ervine in the end proved himself the cleverer of the two."</p>

  <p>"Your father told you that?"</p>

  <p>"No, I overheard it."</p>

  <p>"Your father, I take it, didn't like Helen?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't see the best of her. She was so nervous."</p>

  <p>He went on eagerly: "Don't you see the suspicion that's in my
  mind?&mdash;That Ervine plotted with Helen to get me married to her! That she
  married me for all sorts of sordid and miserable reasons!"</p>

  <p>And then Clare said, with as near passion as he had ever yet seen in her:
  "Mr. Speed, you're a fool! You don't understand Helen. She has faults, but
  there's one certain thing about her-she's straight&mdash;<i>absolutely</i>
  straight! And if you've been cruel to her because you suspected her of being
  crooked, then you've done her a fearful injustice! She's
  straight&mdash;straight to the point of obstinacy."</p>

  <p>"You think that?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Think</i> it? Why, man, I'm <i>certain</i> of it!"</p>

  <p>And at the sound of her words, spoken so confidently and indignantly, it
  seemed so to him. Of course she was straight. And he had been cruel to her.
  He was always the cause of her troubles. It was always his fault. And at that
  very moment, might be, she was crying miserably in the drawing-room at
  Lavery's, crying for jealousy of Clare. A sudden fierce hostility to Clare
  swept over him; she was too strong, too clever, too clear-seeing. He hated
  her because it was so easy for her to see things as they were; because all
  problems seemed to yield to the probing of her candid eyes. He hated her
  because he knew, and had felt, how easy it was to take help from her. He
  hated her because her sympathy was so practical and abundant and devoid of
  sentiment. He hated her, perhaps, because he feared to do anything else.</p>

  <p>She said softly: "What a strange combination of strength and weakness you
  are, Mr. Speed! Strong enough to follow out an ideal, and weak enough to be
  at the mercy of any silly little suspicion that comes into your mind!"</p>

  <p>He was too much cowed down by the magnitude of his blunder to say a great
  deal more, and in a short while he left, thanking her rather embarrassedly
  for having helped him. And he said, in the pitch-dark lobby as she showed him
  to the front door: "Clare, I think this visit of mine had better be a secret,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>And she replied: "You needn't fear that I shall tell anybody."</p>

  <p>When the door had closed on him outside and he was walking back along the
  Millstead lane it occurred to him quite suddenly: Why, I called her Clare! He
  was surprised, and perhaps slightly annoyed with himself for having done
  unconsciously what he would never have done intentionally. Then he wondered
  if she had noticed it, and if so, what she had thought. He reflected that she
  had plenty of good practical sense in her, and would not be likely to stress
  the importance of it. Good practical sense! The keynote of her, so it seemed
  to him. How strong and helpful it was, and yet, in another way, how deeply
  and passionately opposed to his spirit! Why, he could almost imagine Clare
  getting on well with his father. And when he reflected further, that, in all
  probability, his father would like Clare because she had "her wits about
  her," it seemed to him that the deepest level of disparagement had been
  reached. He smiled to himself a little cynically; then in a wild onrush came
  remorse at the injustice he had done to Helen. All the way back to Millstead
  he was grappling with it and making up his mind that he would be
  everlastingly kind to her in the future, and that, since she was as she was,
  he would not see Clare any more.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He found her, as he had more than half expected, sitting in
  the drawing-room at Lavery's, her feet bunched up in front of the fire and
  her hands clasping her knees. She was not reading or sewing or even crying;
  she was just sitting there in perfect stillness, thinking, thinking,
  thinking. He knew, as by instinct, that this was not a pose of hers; he knew
  that she had been sitting like that for a quarter, a half, perhaps a whole
  hour before his arrival; and that, if he had come later, she would probably
  have been waiting and thinking still. Something in her which he did not
  understand inclined her to brood, and to like brooding. As he entered the
  room and saw her thus, and as she gave one swift look behind her and then,
  seeing it was he, turned away again to resume her fireside brooding, a sudden
  excruciatingly sharp feeling of irritation rushed over him, swamping for the
  instant even his remorse: why <i>was</i> she so silent and aggrieved? If he
  had treated her badly, why did she mourn in such empty, terrible silence?
  Then remorse recovered its sway over him and her attitude seemed the simple
  and tremendous condemnation of himself.</p>

  <p>He did not know how to begin; he wanted her to know how contrite he was,
  yet he dared not tell her his suspicion. Oh, if she had only the tact to
  treat him as if it had never happened, so that he in return could treat her
  as if it had never happened, and the unhappy memory of it all be speedily
  swept away! But he knew from the look on her that she could never do
  that.</p>

  <p>He walked up to the back of her chair, put his hand on her shoulder, and
  said: "Helen!"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders with a sudden gesture that made him take his
  hand away. She made no answer.</p>

  <p>He blundered after a pause: "Helen, I'm so sorry I've been rather hard on
  you lately&mdash;it's all been a mistake, and I promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've been down to see Clare!" she interrupted him, with deadly
  quietness, still watching the fire.</p>

  <p>He started. Then he knew that he must lie, because he could never explain
  to her the circumstances in a way that she would not think
  unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>"Helen, I haven't!" he 'exclaimed, and his indignation sounded sincere,
  perhaps because his motive in lying was a pure one.</p>

  <p>She made no answer to that.</p>

  <p>He went on, more fervently: "I didn't see Clare, Helen! Whatever made you
  think that?&mdash;I just went for a walk along the Deepersdale road&mdash;I
  wanted some exercise, that was all!"</p>

  <p>She laughed&mdash;an awful little coughing laugh.</p>

  <p>"You went to see Clare," she persisted, turning round and, for the first
  time, looking him in the eyes. "I followed you, and I saw you go in Clare's
  house."</p>

  <p>"You did?" he exclaimed, turning suddenly pale.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Now what have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>He was, rather to his own surprise, quite furious with her for having
  followed him. "I've simply got this to say," he answered, hotly. "You've done
  no good by following me. You've made me feel I can't trust you, and you've
  made yourself feel that you can't trust me. You'll never believe the true
  explanation of why I went to Clare&mdash;you'll go on suspecting all sorts of
  impossible things-you'll worry yourself to death over nothing&mdash;and as
  for me&mdash;well, whenever I go out alone I shall wonder if you're following
  a few hundred yards behind!"</p>

  <p>Then she said, still with the same tragic brooding quietness: "You needn't
  fear, Kenneth. I'll never follow you. I didn't follow you to-night. 'I only
  said I did. I found out what I wanted to find out just as well by that,
  didn't I?"</p>

  <p>He was dazed. He had never guessed that she could be so diabolically
  clever. He sank into a chair and shut his eyes, unable to speak. She went on,
  without the slightest inflexion in the maddening level of her voice: "I'm
  going to leave you, Kenneth. You want Clare, and I'm going to leave you to
  her. I won't have you when you want another woman."</p>

  <p>He buried his head in his hands and muttered, in a voice husky with
  sobbing: "That's not true, Helen. I don't want Clare. I don't want any other
  woman. I only want you, Helen. Helen, you won't leave me, will you? Promise
  me you won't leave me, Helen, Helen, don't you&mdash;can't you believe me
  when I tell you I don't want Clare?"</p>

  <p>Still she reiterated, like some curious, solemn litany: "I'm going to
  leave you, Kenneth. You don't really want me. It's Clare you want, not me.
  You'll be far happier with Clare. And I shall be far happier without you than
  with you when you're wanting Clare. I&mdash;I can't bear you to want Clare,
  Kenneth. I'd rather you&mdash;have her&mdash;than want her. So I've decided.
  I'm not angry with you. I'm just determined, that's all. I shall leave you
  and then you'll be free to do what you like."</p>

  <p>Somehow, a feeling of overwhelming tiredness overspread him, so that for a
  short moment he felt almost inclined to acquiesce from mere lack of energy to
  do anything else. He felt sick as he stared at her. Then a curiously detached
  aloofness came into his attitude; he looked down on the situation a trifle
  cynically and thought: How dramatic! Something in him wanted to laugh, and
  something else in him wanted to cry; most of him wanted to kiss her and be
  comfortable and go to sleep; and nothing at all of him wanted-to argue. He
  wondered just then if such a moment ever came to her as it came to him; a
  moment when he could have borne philosophically almost any blow, when all
  human issues seemed engulfed in the passionate desire to be let alone.</p>

  <p>Yet some part of him that was automatic continued the argument. He pleaded
  with her, assured her of his deep and true love, poured infinite scorn on
  Clare and his relations with her, held up to view a rosy future at Lavery's
  in which he would live with Helen as in one long, idyllic dream. And as he
  sketched out this beautiful picture, his mind was ironically invaded by
  another one, which he did not show her, but which he felt to be more true:
  Lavery's in deep winter-time, with the wind and rain howling round the walls
  of it, and the bleak shivering corridors, and the desolation of the
  afternoons, and the cramped hostility of the Masters' Common-Room, and the
  red-tinted drawing-room at night, all full of shadows and silence and tragic
  monotony. And all the time he was picturing that in his mind he was telling
  her of Lavery's with the sun on it, and the jessamine, and the classrooms all
  full of the sunlit air, and love, like a queen, reigning over it all. The
  vision forced itself out; Helen saw it, but Speed could not. As he went on
  pleading with her he became enthusiastic, but it was an artistic enthusiasm;
  he was captivated by his own skill in persuasion. And whenever, for a moment,
  this interest in his own artistry waned, there came on him afresh the feeling
  of deep weariness, and a desire only to rest and sleep and be friends with
  everybody.</p>

  <p>At last he persuaded her. It had taken from nine o'clock until midnight.
  He was utterly tired out when he had finished. Yet there seemed to be no
  tiredness in her, only a happiness that she could now take and caress him as
  her own. She could not understand how, now that they had made their
  reconciliation, he should not be eager to cement it by endearments. Instead
  of which he lit a cigarette and said that he was hungry.</p>

  <p>While she busied herself preparing a small meal he found himself watching
  her continually as she moved about the room, and wondering, in the calmest
  and most aloof manner, whether he was really glad that he had won. Eventually
  he decided that he was. She was his wife and he loved her. If they were
  careful to avoid misunderstandings no doubt they would get along tolerably
  well in the future. The future! The vision came to him again of the term that
  was in front of him; a vision that was somehow frightening.</p>

  <p>Yet, above all else, he was tired&mdash;dead tired.</p>

  <p>The last thing she said to him that night was a soft, half-whimpered:
  "Kenneth, I believe you <i>do</i> want Clare."</p>

  <p>He said sleepily, and without any fervour: "My dear, I assure you I
  don't."</p>

  <p>And he fell asleep wondering very vaguely what it would be like to want
  Clare, and whether it would ever be possible for him to do so.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-02"
     id="ch-04-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Term began on the Wednesday in the third week in
  January.</p>

  <p>Once again, the first few days were something of an ordeal. Constant
  anticipations had filled Speed's mind with apprehensions; he was full of
  carefully excogitated glooms. Would the hostility of the Masters be more
  venomous? Would the prefects of his own house attempt to undermine his
  discipline? Would the rank and file try to "rag" him when he took preparation
  in the Big Hall? Somehow, all his dreams of Millstead and of Lavery's had
  turned now to fears; he had slipped into the position when it would satisfy
  him merely to avoid danger and crush hostility. No dreams now about Lavery's
  being the finest House in Millstead, and he the glorious and resplendent
  captain of it; no vision now of scouring away the litter of mild corruptions
  and abuses that hedged in Lavery's on all sides; no hopes of a new world,
  made clean and wholesome by his own influence upon it. All his desire was
  that he should escape the pitfalls that were surrounding him, that he should,
  somehow, live through the future without disaster to himself. Enthusiasm was
  all gone. Those old days when he had plunged zestfully into all manner of new
  things, up to his neck in happiness as well as in mistakes&mdash;those days
  were over. His one aim now was not to make mistakes, and though he did not
  know it, he cared for little else in the world.</p>

  <p>That first night of term he played the beginning-of-term hymn in the
  chapel.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Lord, behold us with Thy blessing,<br>
  Once again assembled here..."</p>

  <p>The words fell on his mind with a sense of heavy, unsurmountable gloom. He
  looked into the mirror above his head and saw the choir-stalls and the front
  rows of the pews; the curious gathering of Millsteadians in their
  not-yet-discarded vacation finery; Millsteadians unwontedly sober; some,
  perhaps, a little heart-sick. He saw Ervine's back, as he read the lesson
  from the lectern, and as he afterwards stood to pronounce the Benediction.
  "The grace of God, which passeth&mdash;um&mdash;understanding, and
  the&mdash;um&mdash;fellowship of the&mdash;um&mdash;the Holy Spirit..."</p>

  <p>He hated that man.</p>

  <p>He thought of the dark study and Potter and the drawing-room where he and
  Helen had spent so many foolish hours during the summer term of the year
  before.</p>

  <p><i>Foolish</i> hours? Had he come to the point when he looked back with
  scorn upon his courtship days? No, no; he withdrew the word "foolish."</p>

  <p>"...rest upon&mdash;um&mdash;all our hearts&mdash;now
  and&mdash;um&mdash;for ever&mdash;um&mdash;Ah-men...I would&mdash;um,
  yes&mdash;be glad&mdash;if the&mdash;um&mdash;the&mdash;the new boys this
  term&mdash;would stay behind to see me&mdash;um, yes&mdash;to see me for a
  moment..."</p>

  <p>Yes, he hated that man.</p>

  <p>He gathered his gown round him and descended the ladder into the vestry. A
  little boy said "Good-evening, Mr. Speed," and shook hands with him.
  "Good-evening, Robinson," he said, rather quietly. The boy went on: "I hope
  you had a nice Christmas, sir." Speed started, checked himself, and replied:
  "Oh yes, very nice, thanks. And you too, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, sir," answered the boy. When he had gone Speed wondered if the
  whole incident had been a subtle and ironical form of "ragging." Cogitation
  convinced him that it couldn't have been; yet fear, always watching and ready
  to pounce, would have made him think so. He felt really alarmed as he walked
  back across the quadrangle to Lavery's, alarmed, not about the Robinson
  incident, which he could see was perfectly innocent, but because he was so
  prone to these awful and ridiculous fears. If he went on suspecting where
  there was no cause, and imagining where there was no reality, some day
  Millstead would drive him mad. <i>Mad&mdash;yes, mad</i>. Two boys ran past
  him quickly and he could see that they stopped afterwards to stare at him and
  to hold some sort of a colloquy. What was that for? Was there anything
  peculiar about him? He felt to see if his gown was on wrong side out: no,
  that was all right. Then what did they stop for? Then he realised that he Was
  actually speaking that sentence out aloud; he had said, as to some corporeal
  companion: <i>What did they stop for</i>? Had he been gibbering like that all
  the way across the quadrangle? Had the two boys heard him talking about going
  mad? Good God, he hoped not! That would be terrible, terrible. He went in to
  Lavery's with the sweat standing out in globes on his forehead. And yet,
  underfoot, the ground was beginning to be hard with frost.</p>

  <p>Well, anyway, one thing was comforting; he was getting along much better
  with Helen. They had not had any of those dreadful, pathetic scenes for over
  a fortnight. His dreams of happiness were gone; it was enough if he succeeded
  in staving off the misery. As he entered the drawing-room Helen ran forward
  to meet him and kissed him fervently. "The first night of our new term," she
  said, but the mention only gave a leap to his anxieties. But he returned her
  embrace, willing to extract what satisfaction he could from mere physical
  passion.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">An hour later he was dining in the Master's Common-Room. He
  would have avoided the ordeal but for the unwritten law which ordained that
  even the housemasters should be present on the first night of term. Not that
  there was anything ceremonial about the proceedings. Nothing happened that
  did not always happen, except the handshaking and the disposition to talk
  more volubly than usual. Potter arched his long mottled neck in between each
  pair of diners in exactly the same manner as heretofore; there was the same
  unchanged menu of vegetable soup, undercooked meat, and a very small tart on
  a very large plate.</p>

  <p>But to Speed it seemed indeed as if everything was changed. The room
  seemed different; seemed darker, gloomier, more chronically insufferable;
  Potter's sibilant, cat-like stealthiness took on a degree of sinisterness
  that made Speed long to fight him and knock him down, soup-plates and all;
  the food tasted reminiscently of all the vaguely uncomfortable things he had
  ever known. But it was in the faces of the men around him that he detected
  the greatest change of all. He thought they were all hating him He caught
  their eyes glancing upon him malevolently; he thought that when they spoke to
  him it was with some subtle desire to insult him; he thought also, that when
  they were silent it was because they were ignoring him deliberately. The mild
  distaste he had had for some of them, right from the time of first meeting,
  now flamed up into the most virulent and venomous of hatreds. And even
  Clanwell, whom he had always liked exceedingly, he suspected ever so slightly
  at first, though in a little while he liked him as much as ever, and more
  perhaps, because he liked the others so little.</p>

  <p>Pritchard he detested. Pritchard enquired about his holiday, how and where
  he had spent it, and whether he had had a good time; also if Mrs. Speed were
  quite well, and how had she liked the visit to Beachings Over. Somehow, the
  news had spread that he had taken Helen to spend Christmas at his parents'
  house. He wondered in what way, but felt too angry to enquire. Pritchard's
  questions stung him to silent, bottled-up fury; he answered in
  monosyllables.</p>

  <p>"Friend Speed has the air of a thoughtful man," remarked Ransome in his
  oblique, half-sarcastic way. And Speed smiled at this, not because it amused
  him at all, but because Ransome possessed personality which submerged to some
  extent his own.</p>

  <p>Finally, when Clanwell asked him up to coffee he declined, courteously,
  but with a touch of unboyish reserve which he had never previously exhibited
  in his relations with Clanwell. "I've got such a lot of work at Lavery's," he
  pleaded. "Another night, Clanwell..."</p>

  <p>And as he walked across the quadrangle at half-past eight he heard again
  those curious sounds that had thrilled him so often before, those sounds that
  told him that Millstead had come to life again. The tall blocks of Milner's
  and Lavery's were cliffs of yellow brilliance, from which great slanting
  shafts of light fell away to form a patchwork on the quadrangle. He heard
  again the chorus of voices in the dormitories, the tinkle of crockery in the
  basement studies, the swish of water into the baths, the babel of
  miscellaneous busyness. He saw faces peering out of the high windows, and
  heard voices calling to one another across the dark gulf between the two
  houses. It did not thrill him now, or rather, it did not thrill him with the
  beauty of it; it was a thrill of terror, if a thrill at all, which came to
  him. And he climbed up the flight of steps that led to the main door of
  Lavery's and was almost afraid to ring the bell of his own house.</p>

  <p>Burton came, shambling along with his unhappy feet and beaming-positively
  beaming&mdash;because it was the beginning of the term.</p>

  <p>"Once again, sir," he said, mouthing, as he admitted Speed. He jangled his
  huge keys in his hand as if he were a stage jailer in a stage prison. "I
  don't like the 'ockey term myself, sir, but I'd rather have any term than the
  'olidays."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Speed, rather curtly.</p>

  <p>There were several jobs he had to do. Some of them he could postpone for a
  day, or perhaps, even for a few days, if he liked, but there was no advantage
  in doing so, and besides, he would feel easier when they were all done.
  First, he had to deliver a little pastoral lecture to the new boys. Then he
  had to chat with the prefects, old and new&mdash;rather an ordeal, that. Then
  he had to patrol the dormitories and see that everything was in proper order.
  Then he had to take and give receipts for money which anybody might wish to
  "bank" with him. Then he had to give Burton orders about the morning. Then he
  had to muster a roll-call and enquire about those who had not arrived. Then,
  at ten-thirty, he had to see that all lights were out and the community
  settled in its beds for slumber...</p>

  <p>All of which he accomplished automatically. He told the new boys, in a
  little speech that was meant to be facetious, that the one unforgivable sin
  at Lavery's was to pour tea-leaves down the waste-pipes of the baths. He told
  the prefects, in a voice that was harsh because it was nervous, that he hoped
  they would all co-operate with him for the good of the House. He told Burton,
  quite tonelessly, to ring the bell in the dormitories at seven-thirty, and to
  have breakfast ready in his sitting-room at eight. And he went round the
  dormitories at half-past ten, turning out gases and delivering brusque
  good-nights.</p>

  <p>Then he went downstairs into the drawing-room of his own house where Helen
  was. He went in smiling Helen was silent, but he knew from experience that
  silence with her did not necessarily betoken unhappiness. Yet even so, he
  found such silences always unnerving. To-night he wanted, if she had been in
  the mood, to laugh, to be jolly, to bludgeon away his fears. He would not
  have minded getting slightly drunk...But she was silent, brooding, no doubt,
  happily, but with a sadness that was part of her happiness.</p>

  <p>As he passed by the table in the dimly-lit room he knocked over the large
  cash-box full of the monies that the boys had banked with him. It fell on to
  the floor with a crash which made all the wires in the piano vibrate.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you careless?" said Helen, quietly, looking round at him.</p>

  <p>He looked at her, then at the cash-box on the floor, and said finally:
  "Damn it all! A bit of noise won't harm us. This isn't a funeral."</p>

  <p>He said it sharply, exasperated, as if he were just trivially enraged.
  After he had said it he stared at her, waiting for her to say something. But
  she made no answer, and after a long pause he solemnly picked up the
  cash-box.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">There came a January morning when he had a sudden and almost
  intolerable longing to see Clare. The temperature was below freezing-point,
  although the sun was shining out of a clear sky; and he was taking five
  <i>alpha</i> in art drawing in a room in which the temperature, by means of
  the steamiest of hot-water pipes, had been raised to sixty. His desk was at
  the side of a second-floor window, and as he looked out of it he could see
  the frost still white on the quadrangle and the housemaids pouring hot water
  and ashes on the slippery cloister-steps. He had, first of all, an urgent
  desire to be outside in the keen, crisp air, away from the fugginess of
  heated class-rooms; then faintly-heard trot of horses along the Millstead
  lane set up in him a restlessness that grew as the hands of his watch slid
  round to the hour of dismissal. It was a half-holiday in the afternoon, and
  he decided to walk up to Dinglay Fen, taking with him his skates, in case the
  ice should be thick enough. The thought of it, cramped up in a stuffy
  class-room, was a sufficiently disturbing one. And then, quite suddenly,
  there came into his longing for the fresh air and the freedom of the world a
  secondary longing&mdash;faint at first, and then afterwards stormily
  insurgent&mdash;a longing for Clare to be with him on his adventures. That
  was all. He just wanted her company, the tread of her feet alongside his on
  the fenland roads, her answers to his questions, and her questions for him to
  answer. It was a strange want, it seemed to him, but a harmless one; and he
  saw no danger in it.</p>

  <p>Dismissal-hour arrived, and by that time he was in a curious ferment of
  desire. Moreover, his brain had sought out and discovered a piece of
  casuistry suitable for his purpose. Had not Clare, on the occasion of his
  last visit to her, told him plainly and perhaps significantly that she would
  never tell anyone of his visit? And if she would not tell of that one, why
  should she of <i>any one&mdash;any</i> one he might care to make <i>in</i>
  the future? And as his only reason for not visiting her was a desire to
  please Helen, surely that end was served just as easily if he <i>did</i>
  visit her, provided that Helen did not know. There could be no moral iniquity
  in lying to Helen in order to save her from unhappiness, and anyway, a lie to
  her was at least as honest as her subterfuge had been in order to learn from
  him of his last visit. On all sides, therefore, he was able to fortify
  himself for the execution of his desire.</p>

  <p>But, said Caution, it would be silly to see her in the day-time, and
  out-of-doors, for then they would run the risk of being seen together by some
  of the Millstead boys, or the masters, and the affair would pretty soon come
  to Helen's ears, along channels that would by no means minimise it in
  transmission. Hence again, the necessity to see Clare in the evenings, and at
  her house, as before. And at the thought of her cosy little upstairs
  sitting-room, with the books and the Persian rugs and the softly-shaded lamp,
  he kindled to a new and exquisite anticipation.</p>

  <p>So, then, he would go up to Dinglay Fen alone that afternoon, wanting
  Clare's company, no doubt, but willing to wait for it happily now that it was
  to come to him so soon. Nor did he think that there was anything especially
  Machiavellian in the plans he had decided upon.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">But he saw her sooner than that evening.</p>

  <p>Towards midday the clouds suddenly wrapped up the sky and there began a
  tremendous snowstorm that lasted most of the afternoon and prevented the
  hockey matches. All hope of skating was thus dispelled, and Speed spent the
  afternoon in the drawing-room at Lavery's, combining the marking of
  exercise-books with the joyous anticipation of the evening. Then, towards
  four o'clock, the sky cleared as suddenly as it had clouded over, and a red
  sun shone obliquely over the white and trackless quadrangle. There was a
  peculiar brightness that came into the room through the window that
  overlooked the snow; a strange unwonted brightness that kindled a tremulous
  desire in his heart, a desire delicate and exquisite, a desire without
  command in it, but with a fragile, haunting lure that was more irresistible
  than command. As he stood by the window and saw the ethereal radiance of the
  snow, golden almost in the rays of the low-hanging sun, he felt that he would
  like to walk across the white meadows to Parminters. He wanted
  something&mdash;something that was not in Millstead, something that, perhaps,
  was not in the world.</p>

  <p>He set out, walking briskly, facing the crisp wind till the tears came
  into his eyes and rolled down his cold cheeks. Far beyond old Millstead spire
  the sun was already sinking into the snow, and all the sky of the west was
  shot with streams of pendulous fire. The stalks of the tallest grasses were
  clotted with snow which the sun had tried hard to melt and was now leaving to
  freeze stiff and crystalline; as the twilight crept over the earth the wind
  blew colder and the film of snow lately fallen made the path over the meadows
  hard and slippery with ice.</p>

  <p>Then it was that he met Clare; in the middle of the meadows between
  Millstead and Parminters, at twilight amidst a waste of untrod snow. Her face
  was wonderfully lit with the reflection of the fading whiteness.</p>

  <p>He felt himself growing suddenly pale; he stopped, silent, without a
  smile, as if frozen stiff by the sight of her.</p>

  <p>And she said, half laughing: "Hello, Mr. Speed! You look unusually
  grim..." Then she paused, and added in a different voice: "No&mdash;on
  further observation I think you look ill...Tell me, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>He knew then that he loved her.</p>

  <p>The revelation came on him so sharply, so acidly, with such overwhelming
  and uncompromising directness, that his mind reacted to it as to the sudden
  brink of a chasm. He saw the vast danger of his position. He saw the
  stupendous fool he had been. He saw, as if some mighty veil had been pulled
  aside, the stream of tragedy sweeping him on to destruction. And he stopped
  short, all the manhood in him galvanised into instant determination.</p>

  <p>He replied, smiling: "I'm <i>feeling</i> perfectly well, anyway. Beautiful
  after the snowstorm, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>It was so clear, so ominously clear that she would stop to talk to him if
  he would let her.</p>

  <p>Therefore he said, curtly: "I'm afraid it's spoilt all the chances of
  skating, though...Pity, isn't it? Well, I won't keep you in the
  cold&mdash;one needs to walk briskly and keep on walking, doesn't one? Good
  night!"</p>

  <p>"Good night," she said simply.</p>

  <p>Through the fast gathering twilight they went their several ways. When he
  reached Parminters it was quite dark. He went to the <i>Green Man</i> and had
  tea in the cosy little firelit inn-parlour with a huge Airedale dog for
  company. Somehow, he felt happier, now that he knew the truth and was facing
  it. And by the time he reached Lavery's on the way home he was treating the
  affair almost jauntily. After all, there was a very simple and certain cure
  for even the most serious attack of the ailment which he had diagnosed
  himself as possessing. He must not see Clare again. Never again. No, not even
  once. How seriously he was taking himself, he thought. Then he laughed, and
  wondered how he had been so absurd. For it <i>was</i> absurd, incredibly
  absurd, to suppose himself even remotely in love with Clare! It was
  unthinkable, impossible, no more to be feared than the collapse of the top
  storey of Lavery's into the basement. He was a fool, a stupid,
  self-analysing, self-suspecting fool. He entered Lavery's scorning himself
  very thoroughly, as much for his cowardly decision not to see Clare again as
  for his baseless suspicion that he was growing fond of her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-03"
     id="ch-04-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Why was it that whenever he had had any painful scene with
  Helen the yearning came over him to go and visit Clare, not to complain or to
  confess or to ask advice, but merely to talk on the most ordinary topics in
  the world? It was as if Helen drew out of him all the strength and vitality
  he possessed, leaving him debilitated, and that he craved the renewal of
  himself that came from Clare and from Clare alone.</p>

  <p>The painful scenes came oftener now. They were not quarrels; they were
  worse; they were strange, aching, devitalising dialogues in which Helen cried
  passionately and worked herself into a state of nervous emotion that dragged
  Speed against his will into the hopeless vortex. Often when he was tired
  after the day's work the mere fervour of her passion would kindle in him some
  poignant emotion, some wrung= out pity that was, as it were, the last shred
  of his soul; when he had burned that to please her he was nothing but dry
  ashes, desiring only tranquillity. But her emotional resources seemed
  inexhaustible. And when she had scorched up the last combustible fragment of
  him there was nothing left for him to do but to act a part.</p>

  <p>When he realised that he was acting he realised also that he had been
  acting for a long while; indeed, that he could not remember when he had begun
  to act. Somehow, she lured him to it; made insatiable demands upon him that
  could not be satisfied without it. His acting had become almost a real part
  of him; he caught himself saying and doing things which came quite
  spontaneously, even though they were false. The trait of artistry in him made
  him not merely an actor but an accomplished actor; but the strain of it was
  immense. And sometimes, when he was alone, he wished that he might some time
  break under it, so that she might find out the utmost truth.</p>

  <p>Still, of course, it was Clare that was worrying her. She kept insisting
  that he wanted Clare more than he wanted her, and he kept denying it, and she
  obviously liked to hear him denying it, although she kept refusing to believe
  him. And as a simple denial would never satisfy her, he had perforce to
  elaborate his denials, until they were not so much denials as elaborately
  protestant speeches in which energetically expressed affection for her was
  combined with subtle disparagement of Clare. As time went on her demands
  increased, and the kind of denial that would have satisfied her a fortnight
  before was no longer sufficient to pacify her for a moment. He would say,
  passionately: "My little darling Helen, all I want is you&mdash;why do you
  keep talking about Clare? I'm tired of hearing the name It's Helen I want, my
  old darling Helen." He became eloquent in this kind of speech.</p>

  <p>But sometimes, in the midst of his acting, an awful, hollow moment of
  derision would come over him; a moment when he secretly addressed himself:
  You hypocrite. You don't mean a word of all this! Why do you say it? What
  good is it if it pleases her if it isn't true? Can you&mdash;are you prepared
  to endure these nightly exhibitions of extempore play-acting for ever?
  Mustn't the end come some day, and what is to be gained by the postponement
  of it?</p>

  <p>Then the hollow, dreadful, moment would leave him, and he would reply in
  defence of himself: I love Helen, although the continual protestation of it
  is naturally wearisome. If she can only get rid of the obsession about Clare
  we shall live happily and without this emotional ferment. Therefore, it is
  best that I should help her to get rid of it as much as I can. And if I were
  to protest my love for her weakly I should hinder and not help her.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, after he had been disparaging Clare, a touch of real vibrant
  emotion would make him feel ashamed of himself. And then, in a few sharp,
  anguished sentences he would undo all the good that hours of argument and
  protestation had achieved. He would suddenly defend Clare, wantonly,
  obtusely, stupidly aware all the time of the work he was undoing, yet,
  somehow, incapable of stopping the words that came into his mouth. And they
  were not eloquent words; they were halting, diffident, often rather silly.
  "Clare's all right," he would say sometimes, and refuse to amplify or
  qualify. "I don't know why we keep dragging her in so much. She's never done
  us any harm and I've nothing against her."</p>

  <p>"So. You love her."</p>

  <p>"Love her? Rubbish! I don't love her. But I don't <i>hate</i>
  her&mdash;surely you don't expect me to do that!"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't expect you to do that. I expect you to marry her, though,
  some day."</p>

  <p>"Marry her! Good God, what madness you talk, Helen! I don't want to marry
  her, and if I did she wouldn't want to marry me! And besides, it happens that
  I'm already married. That's an obstacle, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"There's such a thing as divorce."</p>

  <p>"You can't get a divorce just because you want one."</p>

  <p>"I know that."</p>

  <p>"And besides, my dear Helen, who wants a divorce? Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Do <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't."</p>

  <p>"Kenneth, I know it seems to you that I'm terribly unreasonable. But it
  isn't any satisfaction to me that you just don't <i>see</i> Clare. What I
  want is that you shan't <i>want</i> to see her."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want to see her."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;what's the good of me telling you I don't want to
  see her if you can't believe me?"</p>

  <p>"No good at all, Kenneth. That's why it's so awful."</p>

  <p>He said then, genuinely: "Is it <i>very</i> awful, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You don't know what it's like to feel that all the time one's
  happiness in the world is hanging by a thread. Kenneth, all the time I'm
  watching you I can see Clare written in your mind. I <i>know</i> you want
  her. I know she can give you heaps that I can't give you. I know that our
  marriage was a tragic mistake. We're not suited to one another. We make each
  other frightfully, frightfully miserable. More miserable than there's any
  reason for, but still, that doesn't help. We're misfits, somehow, and though
  we try ever so hard we shall never be any better until we grow old and are
  too tired for love any more. Then we shall be too disinterested to worry. It
  was <i>my</i> fault, Kenneth-I oughtn't to have married you. Father wanted me
  to, because your people have a lot of money, but I only married you because I
  loved you, Kenneth. It was silly of me, Kenneth, but it's the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" So the mystery was solved. He softened to her now that he heard her
  simple confession; he felt that he loved her, after all.</p>

  <p>She went on, sadly: "I'm not going to stay with you, Kenneth. I'm not
  going to ruin your life. You won't be able to keep me. I'd rather you be
  happy and not have anything to do with me."</p>

  <p>Then he began one of his persuasive speeches. The beginning of it was
  sincere, but as he used up all the genuine emotion that was in him, he drew
  more and more on his merely histrionic capacities. He pleaded, he argued, he
  implored. Once the awful thought came to him: Supposing I cried? Doubt as to
  his capacity to cry impressively decided him against the suggestion...And
  once the more awful thought came to him: Supposing one of these times I do
  not succeed in patching things up? Supposing we <i>do</i> agree to separate?
  Do I really want to win all the time I am wrestling so hard for victory?</p>

  <p>And at the finish, when he had succeeded once again, and when she was
  ready for all the passionate endearments that he was too tired to take
  pleasure in giving, he felt: This cannot last. It is killing me. It is
  killing her too. God help us both...</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">One day he realised that he was a failure. He had had some
  disciplinary trouble with the fifth form and had woefully lost his temper.
  There had followed a mild sort of scene; within an hour it had been noised
  all over the school, so that he knew what the boys and Masters were thinking
  of when they looked at him. It was then that the revelation of failure came
  upon him.</p>

  <p>But, worst of all, there grew in him wild and ungovernable hates. He hated
  the Head, he hated Pritchard, <i>he</i> hated Smallwood, he hated, most
  intensely of all, perhaps, Burton. Burton was too familiar. Not that Speed
  disliked familiarity; it was rather that in Burton's familiarity he always
  diagnosed contempt: He wished Burton would leave. He was getting too old.</p>

  <p>They had a stupid little row about some trivial affair of house
  discipline. Speed had found some Juniors playing hockey along the long
  basement corridor. True that they were using only tennis balls; nevertheless
  it seemed to Speed the sort of thing that had to be stopped. He was not aware
  that "basement hockey" was a time-honoured custom of Lavery's, and that
  occasional broken panes of glass were paid for by means of a "whip round." If
  he had known that he would have made no interference, for he was anxious not
  to make enemies. But it seemed to him that this extempore hockey-playing was
  a mere breach of ordinary discipline; accordingly he forbade it and gave a
  slight punishment to the participators.</p>

  <p>Back in his room there came to him within a little while, Burton, eagerly
  solicitous about something or other.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it, Burton?" The mere sight of the shambling old fellow
  enraged Speed now.</p>

  <p>"If you'll excuse the libutty, sir, I've come on be'alf of a few of the
  Juniors you spoke to about the basement 'ockey, sir."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what business it is of yours, Burton."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it ain't any business of mine, that's true, but I thought
  perhaps you'd listen to me. In fact, I thought maybe you didn't know that it
  was an old 'ouse custom, sir, durin' the 'ockey term. I bin at Millstead
  fifty-one year come next July, sir, an' I never remember an 'ockey term
  without it, sir. Old Mr. Hardacre used 'to allow it, an' so did Mr. Lavery
  'imself. In fact, some evenings, sir, Mr. Lavery used to come down an' watch
  it, sir."</p>

  <p>Speed went quite white with anger. He was furiously annoyed with himself
  for having again trod on one of these dangerous places; he was also furious
  with Burton for presuming to tell him his business. Also, a slight scuffle
  outside the door of the room suggested to him that Burton was a hired
  emissary of the Juniors, and that the latter were eavesdropping at that very
  moment. He could not give way.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you think I should be so interested in the habits of my
  predecessors, Burton," he said, with carefully controlled voice. "I'm sure it
  doesn't matter to me in the least what Hardacre and Lavery used to do. I'm
  housemaster at present, and if I say there must be no more basement hockey
  then there must be no more. That's plain, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I was only warning you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I don't require warning. You take too much on yourself,
  Burton."</p>

  <p>The old man went suddenly red. Speed was not prepared for the suddenness
  of it. Burton exclaimed, hardly coherent in the midst of his indignation:
  "That's the first time I've bin spoke to like that by a housemaster of
  Lavery's! Fifty years I've bin 'ere an' neither Mr. Hardacre nor Mr. Lavery
  ever insulted me to my face! <i>They</i> were gentlemen, <i>they</i>
  were!"</p>

  <p>"Get out!" said Speed, rising from his chair quickly. "Get out of here!
  You're damnably impertinent! Get out!"</p>

  <p>He approached Burton and Burton did not move. He struck Burton very
  lightly on the shoulder. The old man stumbled against the side of the table
  and then fell heavily on to the floor. Speed was passionately frightened. He
  wondered for the moment if Burton were dead. Then Burton began to groan.
  Simultaneously the door opened and a party of Juniors entered, ostensibly to
  make some enquiry or other, but really, as Speed could see, to find out what
  was happening.</p>

  <p>"What d'you want?" said Speed, turning on them. "I didn't tell you to come
  in. Why didn't you knock?"</p>

  <p>They had the answer ready. "We did knock, sir, and then we heard a noise
  as if somebody had fallen down and we thought you might be ill, sir."</p>

  <p>Burton by this time had picked himself up and was shambling out of the
  room, rather lame in one leg.</p>

  <p>The days that followed were not easy ones for Speed. He knew he had been
  wrong. He ought never to have touched Burton. People were saying "Fancy
  hitting an old man over sixty!" Burton had told everybody about it. The
  Common-Room knew of it. The school doctor knew of it, because Burton had been
  up to the Sick-room to have a bruise on his leg attended. Helen knew of it,
  and Helen rather obviously sided with Burton.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have hit an old man," she said.</p>

  <p>"I know I shouldn't," replied Speed. "I lost my temper. But can't you see
  the provocation I had? Am I to put up with a man's impertinence merely
  because he's old?"</p>

  <p>"You're getting hard, Kenneth. You used to be kind to people, but you're
  not kind now. You're <i>never</i> kind now."</p>

  <p>In his own heart he had to admit that it was true. He had given up being
  kind. He was hard, ruthless, unmerciful, and God knew why, perhaps. Yet it
  was all outside, he hoped. Surely he was not hard through and through; surely
  the old Speed who was kind and gentle and whom everybody liked, surely this
  old self of his was still there, underneath the hardness that had come upon
  him lately!</p>

  <p>He said bitterly: "Yes, I'm getting hard, Helen. It's true. And I don't
  know the reason."</p>

  <p>She supplied the answer instantly. "It's because of me," she said quietly.
  "I'm making you hard. I'm no good for you. You ought to have married somebody
  else."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" he protested, vehemently. Then the old routine of argument,
  protest, persuasion, and reconciliation took place again.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">He made up his mind that he would crush the hardness in him,
  that he would be the old Speed once more. All his troubles, so it seemed to
  him, were the result of being no longer the old Speed. If he could only bring
  to life again that old self, perhaps, after sufficient penance, he could
  start afresh. He could start afresh with Lavery's, he could start afresh with
  Helen; most of all perhaps, he could start afresh with himself. He
  <i>would</i> be kind. He would be the secret, inward man he wanted to be, and
  not the half-bullying, half-cowardly fellow that was the outside of him. He
  prayed, if he had ever prayed in his life, that he might accomplish the
  resuscitation.</p>

  <p>It was a dark sombrely windy evening in February; a Sunday evening. He had
  gone into chapel with all his newly-made desires and determinations fresh
  upon him; he was longing for the quiet calm of the chapel service, that he
  might cement, so to say, his desires and resolutions into a
  sufficiently-welded programme of conduct that should be put into operation
  immediately. Raggs was playing the organ, so that he was able to sit
  undisturbed in the Masters' pew. The night was magnificently stormy; the wind
  shrieked continually around the chapel walls and roof; sometimes he could
  hear the big elm trees creaking in the Head's garden. The preacher was the
  Dean of somewhere-or-other; but Speed did not listen to a word of his sermon,
  excellent though it might have been. He was too busy registering
  decisions.</p>

  <p>The next day he apologised to Burton, rather curtly, because he knew not
  any other way. The old man was mollified. Speed did not know what to say to
  him after he had apologised; in the end half-a-sovereign passed between
  them.</p>

  <p>Then he summoned the whole House and announced equally curtly that he
  wished to apologise for attempting to break a recognised House custom. "I've
  called you all together just to make a short announcement. When I stopped the
  basement hockey I was unaware that it had been a custom in Lavery's for a
  long while. In those circumstances I shall allow it to go on, and I apologise
  for the mistake. The punishments for those who took part are remitted. That's
  all. You may go now."</p>

  <p>With Helen it was not so easy.</p>

  <p>He said to her, on the same night, when the house had gone up to its
  dormitories: "Helen, I've been rather a brute lately. I'm sorry. I'm going to
  be different."</p>

  <p>She said: "I wish I could be different too."</p>

  <p>"Different? <i>You</i> different? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I could make you fond of me again." He was about to protest with
  his usual eagerness and with more than his usual sincerity, but she held up
  her hand to stop him. "Don't say anything!" she cried, passionately. "We
  shall only argue. I don't want to argue any more. Don't say anything at all,
  please, Kenneth!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Helen&mdash;why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because there's nothing more to be said. Because I don't believe anything
  that you tell me, and because I don't want to deceive myself into thinking I
  do, any more."</p>

  <p>"Helen!"</p>

  <p>She went on staring silently into the fire, as usual, but when he came
  near to her she put her arms round his neck and kissed him "I don't believe
  you love me, Kenneth. Goodness knows why I kiss you. I suppose it's just
  because I like doing it, that's all. Now don't say anything to me. Kiss me
  <i>if</i> you like, but don't speak. I hate you when you begin to talk to
  me."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>She turned on him angrily, suddenly like a tiger. "What are you laughing
  at? I don't see any joke."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. But I wanted to laugh&mdash;for some reason. Oh, if I
  mustn't talk to you, mayn't I even laugh? Is there nothing to be done except
  kiss and be kissed?"</p>

  <p>"You've started to talk. I hate you now."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have begun to talk if you'd let me laugh."</p>

  <p>"You're hateful."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;because I laughed? Don't you think it's rather funny that a
  man may kiss his wife and yet not be allowed to talk to her?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's tragic."</p>

  <p>"Tragic things are usually funny if you're in the mood that I'm in."</p>

  <p>"It's your own fault that you're in such a hateful mood."</p>

  <p>"Is it my fault? I wasn't in the mood when I came into this room."</p>

  <p>"Then it's my fault, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say so. God knows whose fault it is. But does it matter very
  much?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it does."</p>

  <p>He couldn't think of anything to say. He felt all the strength and
  eagerness and determination and hope for the future go out of him and leave
  him aching and empty. And into the void&mdash;not against his will, for his
  will did not exist at the time&mdash;came Clare.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Once again he knew that he loved her. A storm came over him,
  furious as the storm outside! he knew that he loved and wanted her,
  passionately this time, because his soul was aching. To him she meant the
  easing of all the strain within him; he could not think how it had been
  possible for him to go on so long without knowing it. Helen and he were like
  currents of different voltages; but with Clare he would be miraculously
  matched. For the first time in his life he recognised definitely and simply
  that his marriage with Helen had been a mistake.</p>

  <p>But what could he do? For with the realisation of his love for Clare came
  the sudden, blinding onrush of pity for Helen, pity more terrible than he had
  ever felt before; pity that made him sick with the keenness of it. If he
  could only be ruthless and leave her with as few words and as little
  explanation as many men left their wives! But he could not. Somehow, in some
  secret and subtle way, he was tied to her. He knew that he could never leave
  her. Something in their intimate relationship had forged bonds that would
  always hold him to her, even though the spirit of him longed to be free. He
  would go on living with her and pitying her and making her and himself
  miserable.</p>

  <p>He went out into the storm of wind for a few moments before going to bed.
  Never, till then, had Lavery's seemed so desolate, so mightily cruel. He
  walked in sheer morbidness of spirit to the pavilion steps where he and
  Helen, less than a year ago, had thought themselves the happiest couple in
  the world. There was no moonlight now, and the pavilion was a huge dark
  shadow. Poor Helen&mdash;poor Helen! He wished he had never met her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-04"
     id="ch-04-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The torture of his soul went on. He lost grip of his House;
  he was unpopular now, and he knew it. Smallwood and other influential members
  of the school openly cut him in the street. A great silence (so he often
  imagined, but it could not have been really so) fell upon the Masters'
  Common-Room whenever he entered it. Pritchard, so he heard, was in the habit
  of making cheap jokes against him with his class. Even Clanwell took him
  aside one evening and asked him why he had dropped the habit of coming up to
  coffee. "Why don't you come up for a chat sometime?" he asked, and from the
  queer look in his eyes Speed knew well enough what the chat was likely to be
  about.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm busy," he excused himself. He added: "Perhaps I'll drop in
  sometime, though."</p>

  <p>"Yes, do," said Clanwell encouragingly. But Speed never did.</p>

  <p>Then one morning Speed was summoned into the dark study. The Head smiled
  and invited him to sit down. He even said, with ominous hospitality: "Have a
  cigarette&mdash;um, no?" and pushed the cigarette-box an inch or so away from
  him. Then he went on, unbuttoning the top button of his clerical coat: "I
  hope&mdash;um&mdash;you will not think me&mdash;um&mdash;impertinent&mdash;if
  I mention a matter which has&mdash;um&mdash;which has not reached my
  ears-um&mdash;through an official channel. You had, I&mdash;um&mdash;I
  believe,&mdash;an&mdash;um-altercation with one of the house-porters the
  other day. Am I&mdash;am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite right."</p>

  <p>"Well, now, Mr. Speed&mdash;such&mdash;um&mdash;affairs are rather
  undignified, don't you think? I'm not&mdash;um&mdash;apportioning
  blame&mdash;oh, no, not in any way, but I do&mdash;um, yes&mdash;I most
  certainly <i>do</i> think that a housemaster should avoid such incidents if
  he can possibly do so. No&mdash;um&mdash;no personal reflection on you at
  all, Mr. Speed&mdash;merely my advice to you, as a somewhat elderly man to
  an&mdash;um, yes&mdash;to a friend. Yes, a friend. Perhaps I might add
  more&mdash;um&mdash;significantly&mdash;to an&mdash;um&mdash;son-in-law."</p>

  <p>He smiled a wide, sly smile. Speed clenched his hands on his knees. The
  dark study grew almost intolerable. He felt he would like to take Ervine's
  mottled neck in his hands and wring it&mdash;carefully and
  calculatingly...</p>

  <p>When he was outside the room, in the darkness between the inner and the
  outer doors, his resentment rose to fever-pitch. He stopped, battling with
  it, half inclined to re-enter the study and make a scene, yet realising with
  the sane part of him that he could not better his position by so doing.
  Merely as an outlet for tempestuous indignation, however, the idea of
  returning to the fray attracted him, and he paused in the darkness, arguing
  with himself. Then all at once his attention was riveted by the sound, sharp
  and clear, of Mrs. Ervine's voice. She had entered the study from the other
  door, and he heard soft steps treading across the carpet. "Did you tell him?"
  he heard her say. And the Head's voice boomed back: "Yes, my dear. Um
  yes&mdash;I told him."</p>

  <p>A grim, cautious smile crept over Speed's mouth. He put his ear to the
  hinge of the inner door and listened desperately.</p>

  <p>He heard again the voice of Mrs. Ervine. "Did you tell him he might have
  to quit Lavery's at the end of the term?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;um&mdash;well&mdash;I didn't exactly put it to
  him&mdash;so&mdash;um&mdash;so definitely. It seemed to me there was
  no&mdash;um&mdash;no necessity. He <i>may</i> be all right, even yet, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"He won't. He's too young. And he's lost too much ground already."</p>

  <p>"I always thought he was too&mdash;urn&mdash;too youthful, my dear. But
  you overruled my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, and you know why I did, don't you? Oh, I've no patience with you.
  Nothing's done unless <i>I</i> do it."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I&mdash;um&mdash;I assure you&mdash;"<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>He heard footsteps approaching along the outside corridor and feared that
  it might be people coming to see the Head. In that case they would pull open
  the outer door and find him eavesdropping. That would never do. He quietly
  pushed the outer door and emerged into the corridor. A small boy, seeing him,
  asked timidly: "Is the Head in, sir?" Speed replied grimly: "Yes, he's in,
  but he's busy at present."</p>

  <p>After all, he had heard enough. Behind the Head, ponderous and archaic,
  stood now the sinister figure of Mrs. Ervine, mistress of malevolent
  intrigue. In a curious half-humorous, half-contemptuous sense, he felt sorry
  for the Head. Poor devil!&mdash;everlastingly chained to Millstead, always
  working the solemn rhythmic treadmill, with a wife beside him as sharp as a
  knife-edge...Speed walked across to Lavery's, pale-faced and smiling.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">The Annual Athletic Sports.</p>

  <p>It was raining hard. He stood by the tape, stopwatch in hand, distributing
  measured encouragement and congratulation, and fulfilling his allotted role
  of timekeeper. "Well run, Herbert," he managed to say, with a show of
  interest. "Not bad, indeed, sir...eleven and two-fifths seconds."..."Well
  done, Roberts...Hard luck, Hearnshaw&mdash;pity you didn't sprint harder at
  the finish, eh?...Herbert first, Roberts second, Hearnshaw third."</p>

  <p>The grass oozed with water and the cinder-track with blackish slime; he
  shivered as he stood, and whenever he stooped the water fell over the brim of
  his hat and blurred the print on his sports-programme. It was hard to
  distinguish rain from perspiration on the faces of the runners. The bicycles
  used in the slow-bicycle race lay in a dripping and rusting pile against a
  tree-trunk; crystal raindrops hung despairingly from the out-stretched tape.
  There seemed something unnecessarily, gratuitously, even fatuously dismal
  about the entire procedure; the weight of dismalness pressed heavily on
  him&mdash;heavily-heavily&mdash;and more heavily as the afternoon crawled by.
  Yet he gave a ghastly smile as he marked a wet note-book with a wet copying
  pencil and exclaimed: "Well run, Lister <i>Secundus</i>. Four minutes and
  forty-two and a fifth seconds...Next race, please. All candidates for the
  Quarter-Mile Handicap. First Heat...Answer please...Arnold, Asplin, Brooks,
  Carmichael, Cavendish, Caw-stone, <i>Primus</i>, Felling, Fyfield..."</p>

  <p>But at last there came the end of the dreary afternoon, when grey dusk
  began to fall sombrely upon a grey world, when the last race had been
  mournfully held, and his outdoor work was over. Mechanically he was
  collecting into a pile the various impedimenta of the obstacle race; he was
  alone, for the small, dripping crowd of sight-seers had gone over to the
  other side of the pavilion to witness the putting of the weight. Pritchard's
  job, he reflected. Pritchard's staccato tenor voice rose above, the murmur:
  "Thirty-eight feet four inches...Excellent, Robbins..." And then the scrape
  of the spade smoothing over the soft, displaced mud, a sound that seemed to
  Speed to strike the note of utter and inextinguishable misery.</p>

  <p>Old Millstead bells began to chime the hour of five o'clock.</p>

  <p>And then a voice quite near him said: "Well, Mr. Speed?"</p>

  <p>He knew that voice. He turned round sharply. Clare!</p>

  <p>Never did he forget the look of her at that moment. He thought afterwards
  (though it could not have been more than imagination) that as she spoke the
  down-falling rain increased to a torrent; he saw her cheeks, pink and
  shining, and the water glistening on the edges of her hair. She wore a long
  mackintosh that reached almost to her heels, and a sou'wester pulled over her
  ears and forehead. But the poise of her as she stood, so exquisitely serene
  with the ran beating down upon her, struck some secret chord in his being
  which till that moment had been dumb.</p>

  <p>He dropped the sacks into a pool of water and stared at her in wistful
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You've dropped your things," she said.</p>

  <p>He was staring at her so intently that he seemed hardly to comprehend her
  words. The chord in him that had been struck hurt curiously, like a muscle
  long unused. When at last his eyes fell to the sopping bundle at his feet he
  just shrugged his shoulders and muttered: "Oh, <i>they</i> don't matter. I'll
  leave them."</p>

  <p>Then, recollecting that he had not yet given her any greeting, he made
  some conventional remark about the weather.</p>

  <p>Then she made another conventional remark about the weather.</p>

  <p>Then he said, curiously: "We don't see so much of each other nowadays, do
  we?"</p>

  <p>To which she replied: "No. I wonder why? Are they overworking you?"</p>

  <p>"Not that," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then I won't guess any other reasons."</p>

  <p>He said jokingly: "I shall come down to the town and give you another of
  those surprise visits one of these evenings."</p>

  <p>The crowd were returning from watching the putting of the weight. She made
  to leave him, saying as she did so: "<i>Yes</i>, do. You like a talk, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Rather!" he exclaimed, almost boyishly, as she went away.</p>

  <p><i>Almost boyishly</i>! Even a moment of her made a difference in him.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">That evening, for the first time in his life, he was
  "ragged." He was taking preparation in the Big Hall. As soon as the School
  began to enter he could see that some mischief was on foot. Nor was it long
  in beginning to show itself. Hardly had the last-comer taken his seat when a
  significant rustle of laughter at the rear of the Hall warned him that danger
  was near. He left his seat on the rostrum and plunged down the aisle to the
  place whence the laughter had come. More laughter...He saw something scamper
  swiftly across the floor, amidst exclamations of feigned alarm. Someone had
  let loose a mouse.</p>

  <p>He was furious with anger. Nothing angered him more than any breach of
  discipline, and this breach of discipline was obviously an insult to him
  personally. They had never "ragged" him before; they were "ragging" him now
  because they disliked him. He saw the faces of all around him grinning
  maliciously.</p>

  <p>"Anyone who laughs has a hundred lines."</p>

  <p>A sharp brave laugh from somewhere&mdash;insolently defiant.</p>

  <p>"Who was it that laughed then?"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>Then, amidst the silence, another laugh, a comic, lugubriously pitched
  laugh that echoed weirdly up to the vaulted roof.</p>

  <p>He was white now&mdash;quite white with passion. "Was that you,
  Slingsby?"</p>

  <p>A smart spot! It <i>was</i> Slingsby, and Slingsby, recognising the rules
  of civilised warfare even against Speed, replied, rather sheepishly: "Yes,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"A thousand lines and detention for a week!"</p>

  <p>The school gasped a little, for the punishment was sufficiently enormous.
  Evidently Speed was not to be trifled with. There followed a strained silence
  for over ten minutes, and at last Speed went back to his official desk
  feeling that the worst was over and that he had successfully quelled the
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>Then, quite suddenly, the whole building was plunged into darkness.</p>

  <p>He rose instantly shouting: "Who tampered with those switches?"</p>

  <p>He had hardly finished his query when pandemonium began. Desk-lids fell;
  electric torches prodded their rays upon scenes of wild confusion; a splash
  of ink fell on his neck as he stood; voices shrieked at him on all sides.
  "Who had a fight with Burton?" "Hit one your own size." "Oh, Kenneth, meet me
  at the pavilion steps!" "Three cheers for the housemaster who knocked the
  porter down!" He heard them all. Somebody called, sincerely and without
  irony: "Three cheers for old Burton!"&mdash;and these were lustily given.
  Somebody grabbed hold of him by the leg; he kicked out vigorously, careless
  in his fury what harm he did. The sickly odour of sulphuretted hydrogen began
  to pervade the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>He heard somebody shriek out: "Not so much noise, boys&mdash;the Head'll
  come in!" And an answer came: "Well, he won't mind much."</p>

  <p>He stood there in the darkness for what seemed an age. He was petrified,
  not with fear, but with a strange mingling of fury and loathing: He tried to
  speak, and found he had no voice; nor, anyhow, could he have made himself
  heard above the din.</p>

  <p>Something hit him a terrific blow on the forehead. He was dazed. He
  staggered back, feeling for his senses. He wondered vaguely who had hit him
  and what he had been hit with. Probably a heavy book...The pain seemed
  momentarily to quench his anger, so that he thought: This is not ordinary
  "ragging." They hate me. They detest me. They want to hurt me if they
  can...He felt no anger for them now, only the dreadfulness of being hated so
  much by so many people at once.</p>

  <p>He must escape somehow. They might kill him in the dark there if they
  found him He suddenly made his decision and plunged headlong down the centre
  aisle towards the door. How many boys he knocked down or trampled on or
  struck with his swinging arms as he rushed past he never knew, but in another
  moment he was outside, with the cool air of the cloisters tingling across his
  bruised head and the pandemonium in the Hall sounding suddenly distant in his
  ears.</p>

  <p>In the cloisters he met the Head, walking quickly along with gown flying
  in the wind.</p>

  <p>In front of Speed he stopped, breathless and panting.
  "Um&mdash;um&mdash;what is the matter, Mr. Speed? Such
  an&mdash;um&mdash;terrible noise&mdash;I could&mdash;um&mdash;hear it at my
  dinner-table&mdash;and-um&mdash;yourself&mdash;what has happened to you? Are
  you ill? Your head is covered with&mdash;um&mdash;blood...What is all the
  commotion about?"</p>

  <p>Speed said, with crisp clearness: "Go up into the Hall and find out."</p>

  <p>And he rushed away from the Head, through the echoing cloisters, and into
  Lavery's. He washed here, in the public basins, and tied a handkerchief round
  the cut on his forehead. He did not disturb Helen, but left his gown on one
  of the hooks in the cloak-room and went out again into the dark and
  sheltering night, hatless and coatless, and with fever in his heart. The
  night was bitterly cold, but he did not feel it; he went into the town by
  devious ways, anxious to avoid being seen; when he was about half-way the
  parish clock chimed eight. He felt his head; his handkerchief was already
  damp on the outside; it must have been a deep cut.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">"Mr. Speed!" she said, full of compassion. A tiny lamp in
  the corridor illumined his bandaged head as he walked in. "What on earth has
  happened to you? Can you walk up all right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, with even a slight laugh. The very presence of her
  gave him reassurance. He strode up the steps into the sitting-room and stood
  in front of the fire. She followed him and stared at him for a moment without
  speaking. Then she said, almost unconcernedly: "Now you mustn't tell me
  anything till you've been examined. That looks rather a deep cut. Now sit
  down in that chair and let me attend to you. Don't talk."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her, with a feeling in his heart of ridiculously childish
  happiness. He remembered when Helen had once bade him not talk, and how the
  demand had then irritated him. Curious that Clare could even copy Helen
  exactly and yet be tremendously, vitally different!</p>

  <p>She unwound the bandage, washed the cut, and bandaged it up again in a
  clean and workmanlike manner. The deftness of her fingers fascinated him; he
  gazed on them as they moved about over his face; he luxuriated amongst them,
  as it were.</p>

  <p>At the finish of the operation she gave that sharp instant laugh which,
  'even after hearing it only a few times, he had somehow thought
  characteristic of her. "You needn't worry," she said quietly, and in the
  half-mocking tone that was even more characteristic of her than her laugh.
  "You're not going to die. Did you think you were? Now tell me how it
  happened."</p>

  <p>"You'll smile when I tell you. I was taking prep, and they ragged me.
  Somebody switched off the lights and somebody else must have thrown a book at
  me. That's all."</p>

  <p>"That's all? It's enough, isn't it? And what made you think I should smile
  at such an affair?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. In a certain sense it's perhaps a little funny...D'you
  know, lately I've had a perfectly overwhelming desire to laugh at things that
  other people wouldn't see anything funny in. The other night Helen told me
  not to talk to her because she couldn't believe a word I said, but she didn't
  mind if I kissed her. I laughed at that&mdash;I couldn't help it. And now,
  when I think of an hour ago with all the noise and commotion and flash-lights
  and stink-bombs and showers of ink&mdash;oh, God, it was damned funny!"</p>

  <p>He burst into gusts of tempestuous, half-hysterical laughter.</p>

  <p>"Stop laughing!" she ordered. She added quietly: "Yes, you look as if
  you've been in an ink-storm&mdash;it's all over your coat and collar. What
  made them rag you?"</p>

  <p>"They hate me."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He pondered, made suddenly serious, and then said: "God knows."</p>

  <p>She did not answer for some time. Then she suddenly went over to the china
  cupboard and began taking out crockery. Once again his eyes had something to
  rivet themselves upon; this time her small, immensely capable hands as she
  busied herself with the coffee-pot. "And you thought I should find it
  amusing?" she said, moving about the whole time. As she continued with the
  preparations she kept up a running conversation. "Well, I <i>don't</i> find
  it amusing. I think it's very serious. You came here last summer term and at
  first you were well liked, fairly successful, and happy. Now, two terms
  later, you're apparently detested, unsuccessful, and&mdash;well, not so happy
  as you were, eh? What's been the cause of it all? You say God knows. Well, if
  He does know, He won't tell you, so you may as well try to find out for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>And she went on: "I don't want to rub it in. Forgive me if I am doing
  so."</p>

  <p>Something in the calm kindliness of her voice made him suddenly bury his
  head in his hands and begin to sob. He gasped, brokenly: "All
  right...Clare...But the future...Oh, God&mdash;is it <i>all</i>
  black?...What&mdash;<i>what</i> can I do, Clare?"</p>

  <p>She replied, immensely practical: "You must control yourself. You're
  hysterical-laughing one minute and crying the next. Coffee will be ready in a
  while-it'll quiet your nerves. And the future will be all right if only you
  won't be as big a fool as you have been."</p>

  <p>Then he smiled. "You <i>do</i> tell me off, don't you?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No more than you need...But we're talking too much. I don't want you to
  talk a lot&mdash;not just yet. Sit still while I play the piano to you."</p>

  <p>She played some not very well-known composition of Bach, and though when
  she began he was all impatience to talk to her, he found himself later on
  becoming tranquil, perfectly content to listen to her as long as she cared to
  go on. She played quite well, and with just that robust unsentimentality
  which Bach required. He wondered if she had been clever enough to know that
  her playing would tranquillise him.</p>

  <p>When she had finished, the coffee was ready and they had a cosy little
  armchair snack intermingled with conversation that reminded him of his
  Cambridge days. He would have been perfectly happy if he had not been
  burdened with such secrets. He wanted to tell her everything&mdash;to show
  her all his life. And yet whenever he strove to begin the confession she
  twisted the conversation very deftly out of his reach.</p>

  <p>At last he said: "I've got whole heaps to tell you, Clare. Why don't you
  let me begin?"</p>

  <p>She looked ever so slightly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Do you <i>really</i> want to begin?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Begin then."</p>

  <p>But it was not so easy for him to begin after her straightforward order to
  do so. She kept her brown eyes fixed unswervingly on him the whole time, as
  if defying him to tell anything but the utterest truth. He paused, stammered,
  and then laughed uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot to tell you, and it's not easy."</p>

  <p>"Then don't trouble. I'm not asking you to."</p>

  <p>"But I want to."</p>

  <p>She said, averting her eyes from him for a moment: "It's not really that
  you want to begin yourself, it's that you want <i>me</i> to begin, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Then he said: "Yes, I wanted you to begin if you would. I wanted you to
  ask me a question you used to ask me?"</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Whether I'm happy...or not. I always used to say yes, and since that
  answer has become untrue you've never asked me the question."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps because I knew the answer had become untrue."</p>

  <p>"You knew? You <i>knew</i>! Tell me, what did you know? What do yon know
  now?"</p>

  <p>She said, with a curious change in the quality of her voice: "My dear man,
  I <i>know</i>. I understand you. Haven't you found out that? I know, I've
  known for a long time that you haven't been happy."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was in the thick of confession to her. He was saying, almost
  wildly, in his eagerness: "Helen and I-we don't get on well together." Then
  he stopped, and a wild, ecstatic fear of what he was doing rose suddenly to
  panic-point and then was lulled away by Clare's eternally calm eyes. "She
  doesn't understand me-in fact&mdash;I don't really think we either of us
  understand the other."</p>

  <p>"No?" she said, interrogatively, and he shook his head slowly and replied:
  "I think that perhaps explains&mdash;chiefly-why I am unhappy. We&mdash;Helen
  and I&mdash;we don't know quite what&mdash;what to do with each other. Do you
  know what I mean? We don't exactly quarrel. It's more that we try so hard to
  be kind that&mdash;that it hurts us. We are cruel to each other...Oh, not
  actually, you know, but in a sort of secret inside way...Oh, Clare, Clare,
  the truth of it is, I can't bear her, and she can't bear me!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I know what you mean. But she loves you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, she loves me."</p>

  <p>"And you love her?"</p>

  <p>He looked her straight in the eyes and slowly shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I used to. But I don't now. It's awful&mdash;awful but it's the honest
  truth."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that his confession had reached the vital crest and that
  all else would be easy and natural now that he had achieved thus far. He went
  on: "Clare, I've tried to make myself think I love her. I've tried all
  methods to be happy with her. I've given in to her in little matters and big
  matters to try to make her happy, I've isolated myself from other people just
  to please her, I've offered <i>anything&mdash;everything</i> to give her the
  chance of making me love her as I used to! But it's not been a bit of
  use."</p>

  <p>"Of course it hasn't."</p>

  <p>"Why of course?"</p>

  <p>"Because you can't love anybody by trying. Any more than you can stop
  loving anybody by trying...Do you know, I've never met anybody who's enraged
  me as much as you have."</p>

  <p>"Enraged you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What right have I to be enraged with you, you'll say, but never mind
  that. I've been enraged with you because you've been such a continual
  disappointment ever since I've known you. This is a time for straight
  talking, isn't it? So don't be offended. When you first came to Millstead you
  were just a jolly schoolboy&mdash;nothing more, though you probably thought
  you were&mdash;you were brimful of schoolboyish ideals and schoolboyish
  enthusiasms. Weren't you? Nobody could help liking you-you were so&mdash;so
  <i>nice&mdash;nice</i> is the word, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You're mocking me."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I mean it. You <i>were</i> nice, and I liked you very much.
  Compared with the average fussily jaded Master at a public-school you were
  all that was clean and hopeful and energetic. I wondered what would become of
  you. I wondered whether you'd become a sarcastic devil like Ransome, a vulgar
  little counter-jumper like Pritchard, or a beefy, fighting parson like
  Clanwell. I knew that whatever happened you wouldn't stay long as you were.
  But I never thought that you'd become what you are. Good God, man, you
  <i>are</i> a failure, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"What's the good of rubbing it in?"</p>

  <p>"This much good&mdash;that I want you to be quite certain of the depth
  you've fallen to. A man of your sort soon forgets his mistakes. That's why he
  makes so many of them twice over."</p>

  <p>"Well-admitting that I am a failure, what then? What advice have you to
  offer me?"</p>

  <p>"I advise you to leave Millstead."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"At the end of the term."</p>

  <p>"And where shall I go?"</p>

  <p>"Anywhere except to another school."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do?"</p>

  <p>"Anything except repeat your mistakes."</p>

  <p>"And Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Take her with you."</p>

  <p>"But she <i>is</i> one of my mistakes."</p>

  <p>"I know that. But you've got to put up with it."</p>

  <p>"And if I can't?"</p>

  <p>"Then I don't know."</p>

  <p>He suddenly plunged his head into his hands and was silent. Her ruthless
  summing-up of the situation calmed him, made him ready for the future, but
  filled that future with a dreariness that was awful to contemplate.</p>

  <p>After a while he rose, saying: "Well, I suppose you're right. I'll go back
  now. God knows what'll happen to me between now and the end of term. But I
  guess I'll manage somehow. Anyway, I'm much obliged for your first-aid.
  Good-bye&mdash;don't trouble to let me out&mdash;I know how the door
  works."</p>

  <p>"I want to lock up after you're gone," she said,</p>

  <p>In the dark lobby the sudden terror of what he had done fell on him like a
  crushing weight. He had told Clare that he did not love Helen. And then,
  following upon that, came a new and more urgent terror&mdash;he had not told
  Clare that it was she whom he loved. What was the use of telling her the one
  secret without the other?&mdash;Perhaps he would never see Clare again. This
  might be his last chance. If he did not take it or make it the torture of his
  self-reproaching would be unendurable.</p>

  <p>"You came without any coat and hat," she observed. "Let me lend you my
  raincoat&mdash;it's no different from a man's."</p>

  <p>He perceived instantly that if he borrowed it he would have an excuse for
  visiting her again in order to return it. And perhaps then, more easily than
  now, he could tell her the secret that was almost bursting his heart.
  "Thanks," he said, gratefully, and as she helped him into the coat she said:
  "Ask the boy to bring it back here when he calls for the orders in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>He could have cried at her saying that. The terror came on him feverishly,
  intolerably, the terror of leaving her, of living the rest of life without a
  sight or a knowledge of her. He could not bear it; the longing was too
  great&mdash;he could not put it away from him. And she was near him for the
  last time, her hands upon his arms as she helped him into the coat. She did
  not want him to call again. It was quite plain.</p>

  <p>He had to speak.</p>

  <p>He said, almost at the front door: "Clare, do you know the real reason why
  I don't love Helen any more?"</p>

  <p>He thought he heard her catch her breath sharply. Then, after a pause, she
  said rather curtly: "Yes, of course I do. Don't tell me."</p>

  <p>"What!" In the darkness he was suddenly alive.</p>

  <p>"<i>What!</i> You know! You know the real reason! You <i>don't</i>! You
  think you do, but you don't! warrant you don't! You don't know
  everything!"</p>

  <p>And the calm voice answered: "I know everything about you."</p>

  <p>"You don't know that I love you!" (<i>There</i>! It was spoken now; a
  great weight was taken off his heart, no matter whether she should be annoyed
  or not! His heart beat wildly in exultation at having thrown off its secret
  at long last.)</p>

  <p>She answered: "Yes, I know that. But I didn't want you to tell me."</p>

  <p>And he was amazed. His mind, half stupefied, accepted her knowledge of his
  love for her almost as if it were a confession of her returned love for him.
  It was as if the door were suddenly opened to everything he had not dared to
  think of hitherto. He knew then that his mind was full of dreaming of her,
  wild, passionate tumultuous dreaming, dreaming that lured him to the edge of
  wonderland and precarious adventure. But this dreaming was unique in his
  experience; no slothful half-pathetic basking in the fluency of his
  imagination, no easy inclination to people a world with his own fancies
  rather than bridge the gulf that separated himself from the true
  objectiveness of others; this was something new and immense, a hungering of
  his soul for reality, a stirring of the depths in him, a monstrous leaping
  renewal of his youth. No longer was his imagination content to describe
  futile, sensual curves within the abyss of his own self, returning cloyingly
  to its starting-point; it soared now, embarked on a new quest, took leave of
  self entirely, drew him, invisibly and incalculably, he knew not where. He
  knew not where, but he knew with whom...This strange, magnetic power that she
  possessed over him drew him not merely to herself, but to the very fountain
  of life; she <i>was</i> life, and he had never known life before. The reach
  of his soul to hers was the kindling touch of two immensities, something at
  once frantic and serene, simple and subtle, solemn and yet deep with
  immeasurable heart-stirring laughter.</p>

  <p>He said, half inarticulate: "What, Clare! You know that I love you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do."</p>

  <p>(Great God, what <i>was</i> this thrill that was coming over him, this
  tremendous, invincible longing, this molten restlessness, this yearning for
  zest in life, for action, starry enthusiasm, resistless plunging
  movement!)</p>

  <p>"And you don't mind?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> mind. That's why I didn't want you to tell me."</p>

  <p>"But what difference has telling you made, if you knew already?"</p>

  <p>"No difference to me. But it will to you. You'll love me more now that you
  know I know."</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" His query was like a child's.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I know. That's all."</p>

  <p>They were standing there together in the dark lobby.</p>

  <p>His heart was wildly beating, and hers&mdash;he wondered if it were as
  calm as her voice. And then all suddenly he felt her arms upon him, and she,
  Clare&mdash;Clare!&mdash;the reticent, always controlled Clare!&mdash;was
  crying, actually crying in his arms that stupidly, clumsily held her. And
  Clare's voice, unlike anything that it had ever been in his hearing before,
  was talking&mdash;talking and crying at once&mdash;accomplishing the most
  curious and un-Clarelike feats.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, <i>dear</i> man&mdash;why did you tell me? Why did you make
  everything so hard for me and yourself?&mdash;Oh, God&mdash;let me be weak
  for just one little minute&mdash;only one little minute!-I love you, Kenneth
  Speed, just as you love me&mdash;we fit, don't we, as if the world had been
  made for us as well as we for ourselves! Oh, what a man <i>I</i> could have
  made of you, and what a woman <i>you</i> could have made of me! Dearest, I'm
  so sorry...When you've gone I shall curse myself for all this...Oh, my dear,
  my dear..." She sobbed passionately against his breast, and then, suddenly
  escaping from his arms, began to speak in a voice more like her usual one.
  "You must go now. There's nothing we can do. Please, <i>please</i> go now.
  No, no&mdash;don't kiss me...Just go...And let's forgive each other for this
  scene...Go, please go...Good night...No, I won't listen to you...I want you
  to go...Good night...You haven't said a word, I know, and I don't want you
  to. There's nothing to say at all. Good night...Good night..."</p>

  <p>He found himself outside in. High Street as in some strange
  incomprehensible dream...</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-05"
     id="ch-04-05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">All the way back to Millstead joy was raging in his heart,
  trampling down all his woes and defying him to be miserable. Nothing in the
  world-not his unhappiness with Helen, or the hatred that Millstead had for
  him, or the perfidy of his own soul&mdash;could drive out that crowning,
  overmastering triumph&mdash;the knowledge that Clare loved him For the moment
  he saw no difficulties, no dangers, no future that he could not easily bear.
  Even if he were never to see Clare again, he felt that the knowledge that she
  loved him would be an adequate solace to his mind for ever. He was
  happy&mdash;deliriously, eternally happy. Helen's silences, the school's
  ragging, the Head's sinister coldness, were bereft of all their powers to
  hurt him; he had a secret armour, proof against all assault. It seemed to him
  that he could understand how the early Christians, fortified by some such
  inward armour, had walked calm-eyed and happy into the arena of lions.</p>

  <p>He did not go straight back to the school, but took a detour along the
  Deepersdale road; he wanted to think, and hug his happiness, and eventually
  calm it before seeing Helen. Then he wondered what sort of an explanation he
  should give her of his absence; for, of course, she would have received by
  this time full accounts of the ragging. In the end he decided that he had
  better pretend to have been knocked a little silly by the blow on his head
  and to have taken a walk into the country without any proper consciousness of
  what he was doing.</p>

  <p>He returned to Lavery's about eleven o'clock, admitting, himself by his
  own private key. In the corridor leading to his own rooms, Helen suddenly ran
  into his arms imploring him to tell her if he was hurt, where he had been,
  what had happened, and so on.</p>

  <p>He said, speaking as though he had hardly recovered full possession of his
  senses: "I-I don't know...Something hit me...I think I've been walking about
  for a long time...I'm all right now, though."</p>

  <p>Her hands were feeling the bandages round his head.</p>

  <p>"Who bandaged you?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't&mdash;I don't know." (After all, 'I don't know' was
  always a safe answer.)</p>

  <p>She led him into the red-tinted drawing-room. As he entered it he suddenly
  felt the onrush of depression, as if, once within these four walls, half the
  strength of his armour would be gone.</p>

  <p>"We must have Howard to see you to-morrow morning," she said, her voice
  trembling. "It was absolutely disgraceful! I could hear them from
  here&mdash;I wondered whatever was happening." And she added, with just the
  suspicion of tartness: "I'd no idea you'd ever let them rag you like
  that."</p>

  <p>"<i>Let</i> them rag me?" he exclaimed. Then, remembering his part, he
  stammered: "I&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;what happened.
  Something&mdash;somebody perhaps&mdash;hit me, I think&mdash;that was all. It
  wasn't&mdash;it wasn't the ragging. I could have&mdash;managed that."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she said: "Whose mackintosh is that you're wearing?"</p>

  <p>The tone of her voice was sharp, acrid, almost venomous.</p>

  <p>He started, felt himself blushing, but hoped that in the reddish glow it
  would not be observed. "I&mdash;I don't know," he stammered, still playing
  for safety.</p>

  <p>"You don't know?&mdash;Then we'll find out if we can. Perhaps there's a
  name inside it."</p>

  <p>She helped him off with it, and he, hoping devoutly that there might not
  be a name inside it, watched her fascinatedly. He saw her examine the inside
  of the collar and then throw the coat on the floor.</p>

  <p>"So you've been there again," was all that she said.</p>

  <p>Once again he replied, maddeningly: "I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

  <p>She almost screamed at him: "Don't keep telling me you don't know! You're
  not ill&mdash;there's nothing the matter with you at all&mdash;you're just
  pretending! You couldn't keep order in the Big Hall, so you ran away like a
  great coward and went to <i>that</i> woman! Did you or didn't you? Answer
  me!"</p>

  <p>Never before, he reflected, had she quarrelled so shrilly and rancorously;
  hitherto she had been restrained and rather pathetic, but now she was
  shouting at him like a fishwife. It was a common domestic bicker; the sort of
  thing that gets a good laugh on the music-hall stage. No dignity in
  it&mdash;just sordid heaped-up abuse. "Great coward"&mdash;"<i>That</i>
  woman"&mdash;!</p>

  <p>He dropped his lost-memory pose, careless, now, whether she found out or
  not.</p>

  <p>"I <i>did</i> go to Clare," he said, curtly. "And that's Clare's raincoat.
  Also Clare bandaged me&mdash;rather well, you must admit. Also, I've drunk
  Clare's coffee and warmed myself at Clare's fire. Is there any other
  confession you'd like to wring out of me?"</p>

  <p>"Is there indeed? You know that best yourself."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you think I've been flirting with Clare?"</p>

  <p>(As he said it he thought: Good God, why am I saying such things? It's
  only making the position worse for us both.)</p>

  <p>"I've no doubt she would if you'd given her half a chance."</p>

  <p>The bitterness of her increased his own.</p>

  <p>"Or is it that I would if she'd given me half a chance? Are you
  <i>quite</i> sure which?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of nothing where either of you are concerned. As for Clare,
  she's been a traitor. Right from the time of first meeting you she's played a
  double game, deceiving me and yourself as well. She's ruined our lives
  together, she's spoilt our happiness and she won't be satisfied till she's
  wrecked us both completely. I detest her&mdash;I loathe her&mdash;I loathe
  her more than I've ever loathed anybody in the world. Thank God I know her
  <i>now</i>&mdash;at least I shall never trust her any more. And if <i>you</i>
  do, perhaps some day you'll pay as I've paid. Do you think she's playing
  straight with you any more than she has with me? Do you think <i>you</i> can
  trust her? Are you taken in?"</p>

  <p>The note of savage scorn in her voice made him reply coldly: "You've no
  cause to talk about taking people in. If ever I've been taken in, as you call
  it, it was by you, not by Clare!"</p>

  <p>He saw her go suddenly white. He was half-sorry he had dealt her the blow,
  but as she went on to speak, her words, fiercer than ever now, stung him into
  gladness.</p>

  <p>"All right! Trust her and pay for it! I could tell you things if I
  wished&mdash;but I'm not such a traitor to her as she's been to me. I could
  tell you things that would make you gasp, you wretched little fool!"</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't make me gasp; they'd make me call you a damned liar. Helen,
  I can understand you hating Clare; I can understand, in a sense, the charge
  of traitor that you bring against her; but when you hint all sorts of awful
  secrets about her I just think what a petty, spiteful heart you must have!
  You ruin your own case by actions like that. They sicken me."</p>

  <p>"Very well, let them sicken you. You'll not be more sickened than I am.
  But perhaps you think I can't do more than hint. I can and I will, since you
  drive me to it. Next time you pay your evening visits to Clare ask her what
  she thinks of Pritchard!"</p>

  <p>"Pritchard! Pritchard!&mdash;What's he got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Ask Clare."</p>

  <p>"Why should I ask her?"</p>

  <p>"Because, maybe, on the spur of the moment she wouldn't be able to think
  of any satisfactory lie to tell you."</p>

  <p>He felt anger rising up within him. He detested Pritchard, and the mention
  of his name in connection with Clare infuriated him. Moreover, his mind,
  always quick to entertain suspicion, pictured all manner of disturbing
  fancies, even though his reason rejected them absolutely. He trusted Clare;
  he would believe no evil of her. And yet, the mere thought of it was a
  disturbing one.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't insult her by letting her think I listened to such gossip," he
  said, rather weakly.</p>

  <p>There followed a longish pause; he thinking of what she had said and
  trying to rid himself of the discomfort of associating Pritchard with Clare,
  and she watching him, mockingly, as if conscious that her words had taken
  root in his mind.</p>

  <p>Then she went on: "So now you can suspect somebody else instead of me. And
  while we're on the subject of Pritchard let me tell you something else."</p>

  <p>"<i>Tell me</i>!" The mere thought that there was anything else to tell in
  which Pritchard was concerned was sufficient to give his voice a note of
  peremptory harshness.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to leave you."</p>

  <p>"So you've said before."</p>

  <p>"This time I mean it."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"And you can divorce me."</p>

  <p>He stamped his foot with irritation. "Don't be ridiculous, Helen. A
  divorce is absolutely out of the question."</p>

  <p>"Why? Do you think we can go on like this any longer?"</p>

  <p>"That's not the point. The point is that nothing in the circumstances
  provides any grounds for a divorce."</p>

  <p>"So that we've got to go on like this then, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not like this, I hope. I <i>still</i> hope&mdash;that some
  day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him angrily. "You <i>still</i> hope! How many more secret
  visits to Clare do you think you'll make,-how many more damnable lies do you
  think you'll need to tell me&mdash;before you leave off still hoping? You
  hateful little hypocrite! Why don't you be frank with me and yourself and
  acknowledge that you love Clare? Why don't you run off with her like a
  man?"</p>

  <p>He said: "So you think that's what a man would do, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"One sort of a man, perhaps. Only I'm not that sort."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. I also wish that you were another sort of woman, but it's
  rather pointless wishing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Everything is rather pointless that has to do with you and me."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he said: "Look here, Helen. Let's stop this talk. Just listen a
  minute while I try to tell you how I'm situated. You and I are
  married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, don't be stupid about it! We're married, and we've
  got to put up with it for better, for worse. I visit Clare in an entirely
  friendly way, though you mayn't believe it, and your suspicions of me are
  altogether unfounded. All the same, I'm prepared to give up her friendship,
  if that helps you at all. I'm prepared to leave Millstead with you, get a job
  somewhere else, and start life afresh. We <i>have</i> been happy together,
  and I daresay in time we shall manage to be happy again. We'd emigrate, if
  you liked. And the baby&mdash;our baby&mdash;our baby that is to
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She suddenly rushed up to him with her arms raised and struck him with
  both fists on his mouth. "Oh, for Christ's sake, stop that sort of talk! I
  could kill you when you try to lull me into happiness with those sticky,
  little sentimental words! <i>Our</i> baby! Good God, am I to be made to
  submit to you because of that? And all the time you talk of it you're
  thinking of another woman! You're not livable with! Something's happened to
  you that's made you cruel and hateful&mdash;you're not the man that I married
  or that I ever would have married. I loathe and detest you&mdash;you're
  rotten&mdash;rotten to the very root!"</p>

  <p>He said, icily: "Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>She replied, more restrainedly: "I've never met anybody who's altered so
  much as you have in the last six months. You've sunk lower and lower&mdash;in
  every way, until now&mdash;everybody hates you. You're simply a ruin."</p>

  <p>Still quietly he said: "Yes, that's true." And then watching to see the
  effect that his words had upon her; he added: "Clare said so."</p>

  <p>"What!" she screamed, frenzied again. "Yes, <i>she</i> knows! <i>She</i>
  knows how she's ruined you! She knows better than anybody! And she taunted
  you with it! How I loathe her!"</p>

  <p>"And me too, eh?"</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>Then, more quietly than ever, he said: "Yes, Clare knows what a failure
  I've been and how low I've sunk. But she doesn't think it's due to her, and
  neither do I."</p>

  <p>He would not say more than that. He wondered if she would perceive the
  subtle innuendo which he half-meant and half did not mean; which he would not
  absolutely deny, and yet would not positively affirm; which he was prepared
  to hint, but only vaguely, because he was not perfectly sure himself.</p>

  <p>Whether or not she did perceive it he was not able to discover. She was
  silent for some while and then said: "Well, I repeat what I said&mdash;I'm
  going to leave you so that you can get a divorce."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You can leave me if you wish, but I shall not get a divorce."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because for one thing I shan't be able to."</p>

  <p>"And why do you think you won't?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he replied, coldly, "the law will not give me my freedom merely
  because we have lived a cat-and-dog life together. The law requires that you
  should not only leave me, but that you should run away with another man and
  commit misconduct with him."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Yes, and that is what I propose to do."</p>

  <p>"<i>What!</i>"</p>

  <p>A curious silence ensued. He was utterly astounded, horrified, by her
  announcement; she was smiling at him, mocking his astonishment. He shouted at
  her, fiercely: "What's that!"</p>

  <p>She said: "I intend to do what you said."</p>

  <p>"What's that! You <i>what</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I intend to do what you said. I shall run away with another man and
  commit misconduct with him!"</p>

  <p>"God!" he exclaimed, clenching his teeth, and stamping the floor. "It's
  absurd. You can't. You wouldn't dare. Oh, it's impossible. Besides-good God,
  think of the scandals! Surely I haven't driven you to <i>that</i>! Who would
  you run away with?" His anger began to conquer his astonishment. "You little
  fool, Helen, you can't do it! I forbid you! Oh, Lord, what a mess we're in!
  Tell me, who's the man you're thinking of! I demand to know. Who is he? Give
  me his name!"</p>

  <p>And she said, cuttingly: "Pritchard."</p>

  <p>On top of his boiling fury she added: "We've talked it over and he's quite
  agreed to&mdash;to oblige me in the matter, so you see I really do mean
  things this time, darling Kenneth!"</p>

  <p>And she laughed at him.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Out of Lavery's he plunged and into the cold, frosty night
  of Milner's. He had not stayed to hear the last echoes of her laughter dying
  away; he was mad with fury; he was going to kill Pritchard. He ran up the
  steps of Milner's and gave the bell a ferocious tug. At last the porter came,
  half undressed, and by no means too affable to such a late visitor. "I want
  to see Mr. Pritchard on very important business," said Speed. "Will it take
  long, sir?" asked the porter, and Speed answered: "I can't say how long it
  will take."&mdash;"Then," said the porter, "perhaps you wouldn't mind letting
  yourself out when you've finished. I'll give you this key till to-morrow
  morning&mdash;I've got a duplicate of my own." Speed took the key, hardly
  comprehending the instructions, and rushed along the corridor to the flight
  of steps along the wall of which was printed the name: "Mr. H.
  Pritchard."</p>

  <p>Arrived on Pritchard's landing he groped his way to the sitting-room door
  and entered stealthily. All was perfectly still, except for one or two
  detached snores proceeding from the adjoining dormitory. In the starshine
  that came through the window he could see, just faintly, the outline of
  Pritchard's desk, and Pritchard's armchair, and Pritchard's bookshelves, and
  Pritchard's cap and gown hung upon the hook on the door of Pritchard's
  bedroom. <i>His</i> bedroom! He crept towards it, turned the handle softly,
  and entered. At first he thought the bed was empty, but as he listened he
  could hear breathing&mdash;steady, though faint. He began to be ever so
  slightly frightened. Being in the room alone with Pritchard asleep was
  somehow an unnerving experience; like being alone in a room with a dead body.
  For, perhaps, Pritchard would be a dead body before the dawn rose. And again
  he felt frightened because somebody might hear him and come up and think he
  was in there to steal something&mdash;Pritchard's silver wrist-watch or his
  rolled gold sleeve links, for instance. Somehow Speed was unwilling to be
  apprehended for theft when his real object was only murder.</p>

  <p>He struck a match to see if it really was Pritchard in bed; it would be a
  joke if he murdered somebody else by mistake, wouldn't it?...</p>

  <p>Yes, it was Pritchard.</p>

  <p>Then Speed, looking down at him, realised that he did not hate him so much
  for his disgraceful overtures to Helen as for the suspicion of some sinister
  connection with Clare.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Pritchard opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Speed!" he cried, blinking and sitting up in bed. "Whatever's
  the matter! What's&mdash;what's happened? Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>And Speed, startled out of his wits by the sudden awakening, fell forward
  across Pritchard's bed and fainted. So that he did not murder Pritchard after
  all...</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Vague years seemed to pass by, and then out of the abyss
  came the voice of the Head booming: "Um, yes, Mr. Speed...I think, in the
  circumstances, you had better&mdash;um, yes, take a holiday at the
  seaside...You are very clearly in a highly dangerous&mdash;um&mdash;nervous
  state...and I will gladly release you from the rest of your term's
  duties...No doubt a rest will effect a great and rapid improvement...My wife
  recommends Seacliffe&mdash;a pleasant little watering-place&mdash;um, yes,
  extremely so...As for the incidents during preparation last evening, I think
  we need not&mdash;um&mdash;discuss them at present...Oh yes, most
  certainly&mdash;as soon as convenient&mdash;in fact, an early train to-morrow
  morning would not incommode us...I&mdash;um, yes&mdash;I hope the rest will
  benefit you...oh yes, I hope so extremely..."</p>

  <p>And he added: "Helen is&mdash;um&mdash;a good nurse."</p>

  <p>Then something else of no particular importance, and then: "I shall put
  Mr.&mdash;um&mdash;Pritchard in charge of-um&mdash;Lavery's while you are
  absent, so you need not&mdash;um&mdash;worry about your House..."</p>

  <p>Speed said, conquering himself enough to smile: "Oh, no, I shan't worry. I
  shan't worry about anything."</p>

  <p>"Um&mdash;no, I hope not. I&mdash;I hope not...My wife and
  I&mdash;um&mdash;we both hope that you will not&mdash;um&mdash;worry..."</p>

  <p>Then Speed noticed, with childish curiosity, that the Head was attired in
  a sky-blue dressing-gown and pink-striped pyjamas...</p>

  <p>Where was he, by the way? He looked round and saw a tiny gas-jet burning
  on a wall bracket; near him was a bed...Pritchard's bed, of course. But why
  was the Head in Pritchard's bedroom, and why was Clanwell there as well?</p>

  <p>Clanwell said sepulchrally: "Take things easy, old man. I thought
  something like this would happen. You've been overdoing it."</p>

  <p>"Overdoing what?" said Speed.</p>

  <p>"Everything," replied Clanwell.</p>

  <p>The clock on the dressing-table showed exactly midnight.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said Speed.</p>

  <p>Clanwell said: "I'm coming over with you to Lavery's."</p>

  <p>The Head departed, booming his farewell. "Good
  night...My&mdash;um&mdash;my best wishes, Speed...um, yes&mdash;most
  certainly...Good night."</p>

  <p>Then Pritchard said: "Perhaps I can sleep again now. Enough to give
  <i>me</i> a breakdown, I should think. Good night, Speed. And good luck. I
  wish they'd give <i>me</i> a holiday at Seacliffe...Good night,
  Clanwell."</p>

  <p>As they trod over the soft turf of the quadrangle they heard old Millstead
  bells calling the hour of midnight.</p>

  <p>Speed said: "Clanwell, do you remember I once told you I could write a
  novel about Millstead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I remember it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I might have done it then. But I couldn't now. When I first came
  here Millstead was so big and enveloping-it nearly swallowed me up. But
  now&mdash;it's all gone. I might be living in a slum tenement for all it
  means to me. Where's it all gone to?"</p>

  <p>"You're ill, Speed. It'll come back when you're better."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but when shall I be better?"</p>

  <p>"When you've been away and had a rest."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Of. course I'm sure. You don't suppose you're dying, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No. But there are times when I could suppose I'm dead."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, man. You're too morbid. Why don't you go for a sea voyage? Pull
  yourself together, man, and don't brood."</p>

  <p>Clanwell added: "I'm damned sorry for you&mdash;what can I do? Would you
  like me to come in Lavery's with you for a while? You're not nervous of being
  alone, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. And besides, I shan't be alone. My wife's there."</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course. Stupid of me. I was for the moment
  forgetting&mdash;forgetting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I was married, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, not exactly&mdash;I had just forgotten&mdash;well, you know how
  even the most obvious things sometimes slip the memory...Well, here you are.
  Have you the key? And you'll be all right, eh? Sure? Well, now, take a long
  rest and get better, won't you? Good night&mdash;Good night&mdash;sure you're
  all right? Good night!"</p>

  <p>Clanwell raced back across the turf to his own House and Speed admitted
  himself to Lavery's and sauntered slowly down the corridor to his room.</p>

  <p>Helen was sitting in front of the fire, perfectly still and quiet.</p>

  <p>He said: "Helen!"</p>

  <p>"Well!" She spoke without the slightest movement of her head or body.</p>

  <p>"We've got to go away from Millstead."</p>

  <p>He wondered how she would take it. It never occurred to him that she was
  prepared. She answered: "Yes. Mother's been over here to tell me all about
  it. We're going to Seacliffe in the morning. Catching the 9.5. What were you
  doing in Pritchard's bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't they tell you?" he enquired sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"How could they? They didn't know. They found you fainting across the bed,
  and Pritchard said he woke up and found you staring at him."</p>

  <p>"And you can't guess why I went there?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you wanted to ask him if it were true that he and I were going
  away together."</p>

  <p>"No, not quite. I wanted to murder him so that it could never be
  true."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What I said."</p>

  <p>She made no answer, and after a long pause he said: "You're not in love
  with Pritchard, are you?"</p>

  <p>She replied sorrowfully: "Not a little bit. In fact, I rather dislike him.
  You're the only person I love."</p>

  <p>"When you're not hating me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right. When I'm not hating you."</p>

  <p>Then after a second long pause he suddenly decided to make one last effort
  for the tranquillising of the future.</p>

  <p>"Helen," he began pleadingly, "Can't you stop hating me? Is it too late to
  begin everything afresh? Can't we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he stopped. All the eloquence went out of him suddenly, like the air
  out of a suddenly pricked balloon. His brain refused to frame the sentences
  of promise and supplication that he had intended. His brain was
  tired&mdash;utterly tired. He felt he did not care whether Helen stayed with
  him or not, whether she ran away with Pritchard or not, whether his own
  relationship with her improved, worsened, or ceased altogether, whether
  anything in the world happened or did not happen. All he wanted was
  peace&mdash;peace from the eternal torment of his mind.</p>

  <p>She suddenly put her arms round him and kissed him passionately. "We
  <i>will</i> begin again, Kenneth," she said eagerly. "We <i>will</i> be happy
  again, won't we? Oh, yes, I know <i>we</i> will. When we get to Seacliffe
  we'll have a second honeymoon together, what do you think, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Rather," he replied, with simulated enthusiasm. In reality he felt
  sick&mdash;physically sick. Something in the word "honeymoon" set his nerves
  on edge. Poor little darling Helen&mdash;why on earth had he ever married
  such a creature? They would never be happy together, he was quite certain of
  that. And yet...well, anyway, they had to make the best of it. He smiled at
  her and returned her kisses, and then suggested packing the trunk in
  readiness for the morning.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04-06"
     id="ch-04-06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">In the morning there arrived a letter from Clare. He guessed
  it from the postmark, and was glad that she had the tact to type the address
  on the envelope. When he tore it open he saw that the letter was also
  typewritten, and signed merely "C. H.", so that he was able to read it at the
  breakfast-table without any fears of Helen guessing. It was a curious
  sensation, that of reading a letter from Clare with Helen so near to him, and
  so unsuspecting.</p>

  <p>It ran:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR KENNETH SPEED-AS I told you last night I feel
  thoroughly disgusted with myself&mdash;I <i>knew</i> I should. I'm very sorry
  I acted as I did, though of course everything I said was true. If you take my
  advice you'll take Helen right away and never come near Millstead any more.
  Begin life with her afresh, and don't expect it to be too easy. As for
  me&mdash;you'd better forget if you <i>can</i>. We mustn't ever see each
  other again, and I think we had better not write, either. I really mean that
  and I hope you won't send me any awfully pathetic reply as it will only make
  things more awkward than they are. There was a time when you thought I was
  hard-hearted; you must try and think so again, because I really don't want to
  have anything more to do with you. It sounds brutal, but it isn't, really.
  You have still time to make your life a success, and the only way to do it in
  the present circumstances is to keep away from my evil influence. So good-bye
  and good luck. Yours&mdash;C. H."&mdash;"P.S. If you ever <i>do</i> return to
  Millstead you won't find me there."</p>

  <p>He was so furious that he tore the letter up and flung it into the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" enquired Helen.</p>

  <p>He forced himself to reply: "Oh, only a tradesman's letter."</p>

  <p>She answered, with vague sympathy: "Everybody's being perfectly horrid,
  aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't care," he replied, shrugging his shoulders and eating
  vigorously. "I don't care a damn for the lot of them."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in thoughtful silence.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the meal he had begun to wonder if it had been Clare's
  object to put him in just that mood of fierce aggressiveness and truculence.
  He wished he had not thrown the letter into the fire. He would like to have
  re-read it, and to have studied the phrasing with a view to more accurate
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>That was about seven-thirty in the morning. The bells were just beginning
  to ring in the dormitories and the floors above to creak with the beginnings
  of movement. It was a dull morning in early March, cold, but not freezing;
  the sky was full of mist and clouds, and very likely it would rain later. As
  he looked out of the window, for what might be the last time in his life, he
  realised that he was leaving Millstead without a pang. It astonished him a
  little. There was nothing in the place that he still cared for. All his
  dreams were in ruins, all his hopes shattered, all his enthusiasms burned
  away; he could look out upon Millstead, that had once contained them all,
  without love and without malice. It was nothing to him now; a mere box of
  bricks teeming with strangers. Even the terror of it had vanished; it stirred
  him to no emotion at all. He could leave it as casually as he could a railway
  station at which he had stopped <i>en route</i>.</p>

  <p>And when he tried, just by way of experiment, to resuscitate for a moment
  some of the feelings he had once had, he was conscious only of immense mental
  strain, for something inside him that was sterile and that ached intolerably.
  He remembered how, on the moonlight nights of his first term, his eyes would
  fill with tears as he saw the great window-lit blocks of Milner's and
  Lavery's rising into the pale night. He remembered it without passion and
  without understanding. He was so different now from what he had been then. He
  was older now; he was tired; his emotions had been wrung dry; some of him was
  a little withered.</p>

  <p>An hour later he left Millstead quite undramatic-ally by the 9.5. The taxi
  came to the door of Lavery's at ten minutes to nine, while the school was in
  morning chapel; as he rode away and out of the main gates he could hear,
  faintly above the purr of the motor, the drone of two hundred voices making
  the responses in the psalms. It did not bring to his heart a single pang or
  to his eye a single tear. Helen sat beside him and she, too, was unmoved; but
  she had never cared for Millstead. She was telling him about Seacliffe.</p>

  <p>As the taxi bounded into the station yard she said: "Oh, Kenneth, did you
  leave anything for Burton?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, curtly.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have done," she said.</p>

  <p>That ended their conversation till they were in the train.</p>

  <p>As he looked out of the window at the dull, bleak fen country he wondered
  how he could ever have thought it beautiful. Mile after mile of bare,
  grey-green fields, ditches of tangled reeds, forlorn villages, trees that
  stood solitary in the midst of great plains. He saw every now and then the
  long, flat road along which he had cycled many times to Pangbourne. And in a
  little while Pangbourne itself came into view, with its huge dominating
  cathedral round which he had been wont formerly to conduct little
  enthusiastic parties of Millsteadians; Pangbourne had seemed to him so pretty
  and sunlit in those days, but now all was dull and dreary, and the mist was
  creeping up in swathes from the fenlands. Pangbourne station...</p>

  <p>Again he wished that he had not burnt Clare's letter. At noon he was at
  Seacliffe, booking accommodation at the Beach Hotel.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">"Heaven knows what we are going to do with ourselves here,"
  he remarked to Helen during lunch. "You've got to rest," replied Helen.</p>

  <p>He went on to a melancholy mastication of bread. "So far as I can see,
  we're the only visitors in the entire hotel."</p>

  <p>"Well, Kenneth, March is hardly the season, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Then why did we come here? I'd much rather have gone to town, where
  there's always something happening. But a seaside-place in winter!&mdash;is
  there anything in the world more depressing?"</p>

  <p>"There's nobody in the world more depressing than you are yourself," she
  answered tartly. "It isn't my fault we've come here in March. It isn't my
  fault we've come here at all. And what good would London have done for you?
  It's rest you want, and you'll get it here."</p>

  <p>"Heavens, yes&mdash;I'll get it all right."</p>

  <p>After a silence he smiled and said: "I'm sorry, Helen, for being such a
  wet blanket. And you're quite right, it isn't your fault&mdash;not any of it.
  What can we do this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"We can have a walk along the cliffs," she answered.</p>

  <p>He nodded and took up a week-old copy of the <i>Seacliffe Gazette</i>.
  "That's what we'll do," he said, beginning to read.</p>

  <p>So that afternoon they had a walk along the cliffs. In fact there was
  really nothing at all to do in Seacliffe during the winter season except to
  take a walk along the cliffs. Everything wore an air of depression&mdash;the
  dingy rain-sodden refreshment kiosks, the shuttered bandstand, the rusting
  tram rails on the promenade, along which no trams had run since the preceding
  October, the melancholy pier pavilion, forlornly decorated with the tattered
  advertisements of last season's festivities. Nothing remained of the town's
  social amenities but the cindered walk along the cliff edges, and this,
  except for patches of mud and an absence of strollers, was much the same as
  usual. Speed and Helen walked vigorously, as people do on the first day of
  their holidays-grimly determined to extract every atom of nourishment out of
  the much-advertised air. They climbed the slope of the Beach hill, past the
  gaunt five-storied basemented boardinghouses, past the yachting club-house,
  past the marine gardens, past the rows of glass shelters, and then on to the
  winding cinder-path that rose steeply to the edge of the cliffs. Meanwhile
  the mist turned to rain and the sea and the sky merged together into one vast
  grey blur without a horizon.</p>

  <p>Then they went back to the Beach Hotel for tea. Then they read the
  magazines until dinner-time, and after dinner, more magazines until
  bedtime.</p>

  <p>The next day came the same routine again; walk along the cliffs in the
  morning; walk along the cliffs in the afternoon; tea; magazines; dinner;
  magazines; bed. Speed discovered in the hotel a bookcase entirely filled with
  cheap novels that had been left behind by previous visitors. He read some of
  them until their small print gave him a headache. Helen revelled in them. In
  the mornings, by way of a variant from the cliff walk, they took to sitting
  on the windless side of the municipal shelters, absorbed in the novels. It
  was melancholy, and yet Speed felt with some satisfaction that he was
  undoubtedly resting, and that, on the whole, he was enduring it better than
  he had expected.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Then slowly there grew in him again the thought of Clare. It
  was as if, as soon as he gained strength at all, that strength should bring
  with it turmoil and desire, so that the only peace that he could ever hope
  for was the joyless peace of exhaustion. The sharp sea-salt winds that
  brought him health and vigour brought him also passion, passion that racked
  and tortured him into weakness again.</p>

  <p>He wished a thousand times that he had not burned Clare's letter. He felt
  sure that somewhere in it there must have been a touch of verbal ambiguity or
  subtlety that would have given him some message of hope; he could not believe
  that she had sent him merely a letter of dismissal. In one sense, he was glad
  that he had burned the letter, for the impossibility of recovering it made it
  easier for him to suppose whatever he wished about it. And whatever he wished
  was really only one wish in the world, a wish of one word: Clare. He wanted
  her, her company, her voice, her movements around him, the sight of her, her
  quaint perplexing soul that so fitted in with his own, her baffling
  mysterious understandings of him that nobody else had ever had at all. He
  wanted her as a sick man longs for health; as if he had a divine right to
  her, and as if the withholding of her from him gave him a surging grudge
  against the world.</p>

  <p>One dreary interval between tea at the hotel and dinner he wrote to her.
  He wrote in a mood in which he cared not if his writing angered her or not;
  her silence, if she did not reply, would be his answer. And if she did not
  reply, he vowed solemnly to himself that he would never write to her again,
  that he would put her out of his life and spend his energies in forgetting
  her.</p>

  <p>He wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear CLARE&mdash;I destroyed your letter, and I can't
  quite remember whether it forbade me to reply or not. Anyhow, that's only my
  excuse for it. I'm having a dreadfully dull time at Seacliffe&mdash;we're the
  only visitors at the hotel and, so far as I can see, the only visitors in
  Seacliffe at all. I'm not exactly enjoying it, but I daresay it's doing me
  good. Thanks ever so much for your advice&mdash;I mean to profit by
  it&mdash;most of it, at any rate. But mayn't I write to you&mdash;even if you
  don't write to me? I <i>do</i> want to, especially now. May I?&mdash;Yours,
  KENNETH SPEED."</p>

  <p>No answer to that. For nearly a week he scanned the rack in the
  entrance-hall, hoping to see his own name typewritten on an envelope, for he
  guessed that even if she did reply she would take that precaution. But in
  vain his hurried and anxious returns from the cliff-walks; no letter was
  there. And at last, tortured to despair, he wrote again.</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR CLARE&mdash;You haven't answered my letter. I
  <i>did</i> think you would, and now I'm a prey to all sorts of awful and, no
  doubt, quite ridiculous fears. And I'm going to ask you again, half-believing
  that you didn't receive my last letter&mdash;may I write to you? May I write
  to you whenever I want? I can't have your company, I know&mdash;surely you
  haven't the heart to deny me the friendship I can get by writing to you? You
  needn't answer: I promise I will never ask for an answer. I don't care if the
  letters I write offend you or not; there is only one case in which I should
  like you to be good enough to reply to me and tell me not to write again. And
  that is if you were beginning to forget me&mdash;if letters from me were
  beginning to be a bore to you. <i>Please</i>, therefore, let me
  write.&mdash;Yours, KENNETH SPEED."</p>

  <p>To that there came a reply by return of post:</p>

  <p class="letter">"MY DEAR KENNETH SPEED,&mdash;I think correspondence
  between us is both unwise and unnecessary, but I don't see how I can prevent
  you from writing if you wish to. And you need not fear that I shall forget
  you.&mdash;CLARE."</p>

  <p>He replied, immediately, and with his soul tingling with the renewal of
  happiness:</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR CLARE,&mdash;Thank God you can't stop me from
  writing, and thank God you know you can't. I don't feel unhappy now that I
  can write to you, now that I know you will read what I write. I feel so
  unreticent where you are concerned-I want you to <i>understand</i>, and I
  don't really care, when you have understood, whether you condemn or not. This
  is going (perhaps) to be a longish letter; I'm alone in the lounge of this
  entirely God-forsaken hotel&mdash;Helen is putting on a frock for dinner, and
  I've got a quarter-of-an-hour for you.<br>
  <br>
  "This is what I've found out since I've come to Seacliffe. I've found out the
  true position of you and me. You've sunk far deeper into my soul than I have
  ever guessed, and I don't honestly know how on earth I'm to get rid of you!
  For the last ten days I've been fighting hard to drive you away, but I'm
  afraid I've been defeated. You're there still, securely entrenched as ever,
  and you simply won't budge. The only times I don't think of you are the times
  when I'm too utterly tired out to think of anything or anybody. Worse still,
  the stronger I get the more I want you. Why can't I stop it? You yourself
  said during our memorable interview after the 'rag' that it wasn't a bit of
  good trying to stop loving somebody. So <i>you</i> know, as well as
  me&mdash;am I to conclude that, you Hound of Heaven?<br>
  <br>
  "But you can't get rid of me, I hope, any more than I can of you. You may go
  to the uttermost ends of the earth, but it won't matter. I shall still have
  you, I shall always bore you&mdash;in fact, I've got you now, haven't I?
  Don't we belong to each other in spite of ourselves?<br>
  "I tell you, I've tried to drive you out of my mind. And I really think I
  might succeed better if I didn't try. Therefore, I shan't try any more. How
  can you deliberately try to forget anybody? The mere deliberation of the
  effort rivets them more and more eternally on your memory!<br>
  <br>
  "Helen and I are getting on moderately well. We don't quarrel. We exchange
  remarks about the weather, and we discuss trashy novels which we both have
  read, and we take long and uninteresting walks along the cliffs and admire
  the same views, over and over again. Helen thinks the rest must be doing me a
  lot of good. Oh my dear, <i>dear</i> Clare, am I wicked because I sit down
  here and write to you these pleading, treacherous letters, while my wife
  dresses herself upstairs without a thought that I am so engaged? Am I really
  full of sin? I know if I put my case before ninety-nine out of a hundred men
  and women what answer I should receive. But are you the hundredth? I don't
  care if you are or not; if this is wickedness, I clasp it as dearly as if it
  were not. I just can't help it. I lie awake at nights trying to think nice,
  husbandly things about Helen, and just when I think I've got really
  interested in her I find it's you I've really been thinking about and not
  Helen at all.<br>
  <br>
  "There must be some wonderful and curious bond between us, some sort of
  invisible elastic. It wouldn't ever break, no matter how far apart we went,
  but when it's stretched it hurts, hurts us both, I hope, equally. Is it
  really courage to go on hurting ourselves like this? What is the good of it?
  Supposing&mdash;I only say supposing&mdash;supposing we let go, let the
  elastic slacken, followed our heart's desire, what then? Who would suffer?
  Helen, I suppose. Poor Helen!&mdash;I mustn't let her suffer like that, must
  I?<br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't real love that I ever had for her; it was just mere physical
  infatuation. And now that's gone, all that's left is just dreadful
  pity&mdash;oh, pity that will not let me go! And yet what good is
  pity&mdash;the sort of pity that I have for her?<br>
  <br>
  "Ever since I first knew you, you have been creeping into my heart ever so
  slowly and steadily, and I, because I never guessed what was happening, have
  yielded myself to you utterly. In fact, I am a man possessed by a
  devil&mdash;a good little devil&mdash;yet&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>He looked round and saw Helen standing by the side of him. He had not
  heard her approach. She might have been there some while, he reflected. Had
  she been looking over his shoulder? Did she know to whom was the letter he
  was writing?</p>

  <p>He started, and instinctively covered as much of the writing as he could
  with the sleeve of his jacket.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you still wrote to Clare," she said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Who said I did?" he parried, with instant truculence.</p>

  <p>"You're writing to her now."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind how I know. Answer me: you are, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to answer such a question. Surely I haven't to tell you of every
  letter I write. If you've been spying over my shoulder it's your own fault.
  How would you like me to read all the letters <i>you</i> write?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't mind in the least, Kenneth, if I thought you didn't trust
  me."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do trust you, you see, and even if I didn't I shouldn't attempt
  such an unheard-of liberty. And if you can't trust me without censoring my
  correspondence, I'm afraid you'll have to go on mistrusting me."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to censor your correspondence. I only want you to answer me
  a straight question: is that a letter to Clare that you're writing?"</p>

  <p>"It's a most improper question, and I refuse to answer it."</p>

  <p>"Very well...I think it's time for dinner; hadn't you better finish the
  letter afterwards? Unless, of course, it's very important."</p>

  <p>During dinner she said: "I don't feel like staying in from now until
  bedtime. You'll want to finish your letter, of course, so I think, if you
  don't mind, I'll go to the local kinema."</p>

  <p>"You can't go alone, can you?"</p>

  <p>"There's nobody can very easily stop me, is there? You don't want to come
  with me, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't care for kinemas much. Isn't there a theatre
  somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"No. Only a kinema. I looked in the <i>Seacliffe Gazette</i>. In the
  summer there are Pierrots on the sands, of course."</p>

  <p>"So you want to go alone to the kinema?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"All right. But I'll meet you when it's over. Half-past ten, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Probably about then. You don't mind me leaving you for a few hours, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all. I hope you have a good time. I'm sure I can quite
  understand you being bored with Seacliffe. It's the deadest hole I've ever
  struck."</p>

  <p>"But it's doing you good, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I daresay it is in <i>that</i> way."</p>

  <p>She added, after a pause: "When you get back to the lounge you'll wonder
  where you put your half-written letter."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" He suddenly felt in his inside coat-pocket.
  "Why&mdash;where is it? I thought I put it in my pocket. Who's got it? Have
  <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You thought you put it in your pocket, I know. But you didn't. You
  left it on the writing-table and I picked it up when you weren't
  looking."</p>

  <p>"Then you <i>have</i> got it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have got it."</p>

  <p>He went red with rage. "Helen, I don't want to make a scene in front of
  the servants, but I insist on you giving up to me that letter. You've
  absolutely no right to it, and I demand that you give it me immediately."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it after I've read it."</p>

  <p>"Good God, Helen, don't play the fool with me! I want it now, this minute!
  Understand, I mean it! I want it now!"</p>

  <p>"And I shan't give it to you."</p>

  <p>He suddenly looked round the room. There was nobody there; the waitress
  was away; the two of them were quite alone. He rose out of his chair and with
  a second cautious glance round him went over to her and seized her by the
  neck with one hand while with the other he felt in her corsage for the
  letter. He knew that was where she would have put it. The very surprise of
  his movement made it successful. In another moment he had the letter in his
  hand. He stood above her, grim and angry, flaunting the letter high above her
  head. She made an upward spring for his hand, and he, startled by her quick
  retaliation, crumpled the letter into a heap and flung it into the fire at
  the side of the room. Then they both stared at each other in silence.</p>

  <p>"So it's come to that," she said, her face very white. She placed her hand
  to her breast and said: "By the way, you've hurt me."</p>

  <p>He replied: "I'm sorry if I hurt you. I didn't intend to. I simply wanted
  to get the letter, that's all."</p>

  <p>"All right," she answered. "I'll excuse yon for hurting me."</p>

  <p>Then the waitress entered with the sweet and their conversation was
  abruptly interrupted.</p>

  <p>After dinner he went back into the lounge and took up an illustrated
  paper. Somehow, he did not feel inclined to try to rewrite the letter to
  Clare. And in any case, he could not have remembered more than bits of it; it
  would have to be a fresh letter if he wrote at all.</p>

  <p>Helen came downstairs to him with hat and coat on ready for outdoors.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," she said, "I'm going."</p>

  <p>He said: "Hadn't I better take you down to the place? I don't mind a bit
  of a walk, you know."</p>

  <p>She answered: "Oh, no, don't bother. It's not far. You get on with your
  letter-writing."</p>

  <p>Then she paused almost at the door of the lounge, and said, coming back to
  him suddenly: "Kiss me before I go, Kenneth."</p>

  <p>He kissed her. Then she smiled and went out. An hour later he started
  another letter to Clare.</p>

  <p class="letter">"MY DEAR, <i>dear</i> CLARE,:I'm so pleased it has not all
  come to an end!...All those hours we spent together, all the work we have
  shared, all our joy and laughter and sympathy together&mdash;it could not
  have counted for nothing, could it? We dare not have put an end to it; we
  should fear being haunted all our lives. We..."</p>

  <p>Then the tired feeling came on him, and he no longer wanted to write, not
  even to Clare. He put the hardly-begun letter in his pocket&mdash;carefully,
  this time&mdash;and took up the illustrated paper again. He half wished he
  had gone with Helen to the kinema...A quarter to ten...It would soon be time
  for him to stroll out and meet her.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Walking along the promenade to the beach kinema he solemnly
  reviewed his life. He saw kaleidoscopically his childhood days at Beachings
  Over, then the interludes at Harrow and Cambridge, and then the sudden
  tremendous plunge&mdash;Millstead! It seemed to him that ever since that
  glowering April afternoon when he had first stepped into Ervine's dark study,
  events had been shaping themselves relentlessly to his ruin. He could see
  himself as a mere automaton, moved upon by the calm accurate fingers of fate.
  His meeting with Helen, his love of her and hers for him, their marriage,
  their slow infinitely wearisome estrangement&mdash;all seemed as if it had
  been planned with sinister deliberation. Only one section of his life had
  been dominated by his own free will, and that was the part of it that had to
  do with Clare. He pondered over the subtle differentiation, and decided at
  last that it was invalid, and that fate had operated at least as much with
  Clare as with Helen. And yet, for all that, the distinction remained in his
  mind. His life with Helen seemed to press him down, to cramp him in a narrow
  groove, to deprive him of all self-determination; it was, only when he came
  to Clare that he was free again and could do as he liked. Surely it was he
  himself, and not fate, that drew him joyously to Clare.</p>

  <p>The mist that had hovered over Seacliffe all day was now magically lifted,
  and out of a clear sky there shone a moon with the slightest of yellow haloes
  encircling it. The promenade was nearly deserted, and in all the tall cliff
  of boarding-houses along the Marine Parade there was hardly a window with a
  light in it. The solitary redness of the lamp on the end of the pier sent a
  soft shimmer over the intervening water; the sea, at almost high tide, was
  quite calm. Hardly a murmur of the waves reached his ears as he strolled
  briskly along, but that was because they were right up against the stone wall
  of the promenade and had no beach of pebbles to be noisy with. He leaned over
  the railings and saw the water immediately beneath him, silvered in
  moonlight. Seacliffe was beautiful now...Then he looked ahead and saw the
  garish illuminations of the solitary picture-palace that Seacliffe possessed,
  and he wondered how Helen or anybody could prefer a kinema entertainment to
  the glory of the night outside. And yet, he reflected, the glory of the night
  was a subjective business; it required a certain mood; whereas the kinema
  created its own mood, asking and requiring nothing. Poor Helen! Why should
  pity for her have overwhelmed him suddenly at that moment? He did not love
  her, not the least fraction; yet he would have died for her if such had need
  to be. If she were in danger he would not stay to think; he would risk life
  or limb for her sake without a premonitory thought. He almost longed for the
  opportunity to sacrifice himself for her in some such way. He felt he owed it
  to her. But there was one sacrifice that was <i>too</i> hard&mdash;he could
  not live with her in contentment, giving up Clare. He knew he couldn't. He
  saw quite clearly in the future the day when he would leave Helen and go to
  Clare. Not fate this time, but the hungering desire of his heart, that would
  not let him rest.</p>

  <p>And yet, was not this same desire fate itself, his own fate, leading him
  on and further to some inevitable end? Only that he did not fear it. He
  opened wide his arms, welcoming it, longing for and therefore unconscious of
  its domination.</p>

  <p>He stood in front of the gilded dinginess of the picture-palace, pondering
  on his destiny, when there came up to him a shabby little man in a long
  tattered overcoat, who asked him for a light. Speed, who was so anxious not
  to be a snob that he usually gave to strangers the impression of being one,
  proffered a box of matches and smiled. But for the life of him he could not
  think of anything to say. He felt he ought to say something, lest the other
  fellow might think him surly; he racked his brain for some appropriate remark
  and eventually said: "Nice night." The other lit the stump of a cigarette
  contemplatively and replied: "Yes. Nice night...Thanks...Waiting for
  somebody?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Speed, rather curtly. He had no desire to continue the
  conversation, still less to discuss his own affairs.</p>

  <p>"Rotten hole, Seacliffe, in winter," resumed the stranger, showing no sign
  of moving on.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Speed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do&mdash;nowhere to go&mdash;absolutely the deadest place on
  God's earth. I live here and I know. Every night I take a stroll about this
  time and tonight's bin the first night this year I've ever seen anything
  happen at all."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?"</p>

  <p>The stranger ignored the obvious boredness of Speed's voice, and
  continued: "Yes. That's the truth. But it happened all right to-night. Quite
  exciting, in fact."</p>

  <p>He looked at Speed to see if his interest was in any way, aroused. Such
  being not yet so he remarked again: "Yes, quite exciting." He paused and
  added: "Bit gruesome perhaps&mdash;to some folks."</p>

  <p>Speed said, forcing himself to be interested:</p>

  <p>"Why, what was it?"</p>

  <p>And the other, triumphant that he had secured an attentive audience at
  last, replied: "Body found. Pulled up off the breakwater...Drowned, of
  course."</p>

  <p>Even now Speed was only casually interested. "Really? And who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know the name...A woman's body."</p>

  <p>"Nobody identified her yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. They say she's not a Seacliffe woman...See <i>there</i>!" He
  pointed back along the promenade towards a spot where, not half an hour ago,
  Speed had leaned over the railings to see the moonlight on the sea. "Can you
  see the crowd standing about? That's where they dragged her in. Only about
  ten minutes ago as I was passin'. Very high tide, you know, washes all sorts
  of things up...I didn't stay long&mdash;bit too gruesome for me."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Speed. "And for me too...By the way d'you happen to know
  when this picture-house shuts up?"</p>

  <p>"About half-past ten, mostly."</p>

  <p>"Thanks."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll be gettin' along...Much obliged for the light...Good
  night..."</p>

  <p>"Good night," said Speed.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the crowd began to tumble out of the kinema. He stood
  in the darkness against a blank wall, where he could see without being seen.
  He wondered whether he had not better take Helen home through the town
  instead of along the promenade. It was a longer way, of course, but it would
  avoid the unpleasant affair that the stranger had mentioned to him He neither
  wished to see himself nor wished Helen to see anything of the sort.</p>

  <p>Curious that she was so late? The kinema must be almost empty now; the
  stream of people had stopped. He saw the manager going to the box-office to
  lock up. "Have they all come out?" he asked, emerging into the rays of the
  electric lights. "Yes, everybody," answered the other. He even glanced at
  Speed suspiciously, as if he wondered why he should be waiting for somebody
  who obviously hadn't been to the kinema at all.</p>

  <p>Well...Speed stood in a sheltered alcove and lit a cigarette. He had
  better get back to the Beach Hotel, anyway. Perhaps Helen hadn't gone to the
  picture-show after all. Or, perhaps, she had come out before the end and they
  had missed each other. Perhaps anything...Anything!...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the awful thought occurred to him. At first it was
  fantastic; he walked along, sampling it in a horrified fashion, yet refusing
  to be in the least perturbed by it. Then it gained ground upon him, made him
  hasten his steps, throw away his cigarette, and finally run madly along the
  echoing promenade to the curious little silent crowd that had gathered there,
  about halfway to the pier entrance. He scampered along the smooth asphalt
  just like a boisterous youngster, yet in his eyes was wild brain-maddening
  fear.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Ten minutes later he knew. They pointed to a gap in the
  railings close by, made some while before by a lorry that had run out of
  control along the Marine Parade. The Urban District Council ought to have
  repaired the railings immediately after the accident, and he (somebody in the
  crowd) would not be surprised if the coroner censured the Council pretty
  severely at the inquest. The gap was a positive death-trap for anybody
  walking along at night and not looking carefully ahead. And <i>he</i>
  (somebody else in the crowd) suggested the possibility of making the
  Seacliffe Urban District Council pay heavy damages...Of course, it was an
  accident...There was a bad bruise on the head: that was where she must have
  struck the stones as she fell...And in one of the pockets was a torn kinema
  ticket; clearly she had been on her way home from the Beach kinema...Once
  again, it was the Council's fault for not promptly repairing the dangerous
  gap in the railings.</p>

  <p>They led him back to the Beach Hotel and gave him brandy. He kept saying:
  "Now please go&mdash;I'm quite all right...There's really nothing that
  anybody can do for me...Please go now..."</p>

  <p>When at last he was alone in the cheerless hotel bedroom he sat down on
  the side of the bed and cried. Not for sorrow or pity or terror, but merely
  to relieve some fearful strain of emotion that was in him. Helen dead! He
  could hardly force himself to believe it, but when he did he felt sorry,
  achingly sorry, because there had been so many bonds between them, so many
  bonds that only death could have snapped. He saw her now, poor little woman,
  as he had never seen her before; the love in her still living, and all that
  had made them unhappy together vanished away. He loved her, those minutes in
  the empty, cheerless bedroom, more calmly than he had ever loved her when she
  had been near to him. And&mdash;strange miracle!&mdash;she had given him
  peace at last. Pity for her no longer overwhelmed him with its sickly
  torture; he was calm, calm with sorrow, but calm.</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">Then, slowly, grimly, as to some fixed and inevitable thing,
  his torture returned. He tried to persuade himself that the worst was over,
  That tragedy had spent its terrible utmost; but even the sad calm of
  desperation was nowhere to be found. He paced up and down the bedroom long
  and wearisomely; shortly after midnight the solitary gas jet faltered and
  flickered and finally abandoned itself with a forlorn pop. "<i>Curse</i> the
  place!" he muttered, acutely nervous in the sudden gloom; then for some
  moments he meditated a sarcastic protest to the hotel-proprietress in the
  morning. "I am aware," he would begin, tartly, "that the attractions of
  Seacliffe in the evenings are not such as would often tempt the visitor to
  keep up until the small hours; but don't you think that is an argument
  <i>against</i> rather than <i>for</i> turning off the gas-supply at
  midnight?" Rather ponderous, though; probably the woman wouldn't know what he
  meant. He might write a letter to the <i>Seacliffe Gazette</i> about it,
  anyway. "Oh, <i>damn</i> them!" he exclaimed, with sudden fervour, as he
  searched for the candle on the dressing-table. Unfortunately he possessed no
  matches, and the candlestick, when at last his groping had discovered it,
  contained none, either. It was so infernally dark and silent; everybody in
  the place was in bed except himself. He pictured the maids, sleeping cosily
  in the top attics, or perhaps chattering together in whispers about clothes
  or their love-affairs or Seacliffe gossip or&mdash;why, of
  course!&mdash;about <i>him</i>. They would surely be talking about
  <i>him</i>. Such a tit-bit of gossip! Everyone in Seacliffe would be full of
  the tragedy of the young fellow whose wife, less than a year married, had
  fallen accidentally into the sea off the promenade! He, not she, would be the
  figure of high tragedy in their minds, and on the morrow they would all stare
  at him morbidly, curiously...Good God in Heaven! Could he endure
  it?...Lightly the moonlight filtered through the Venetian blinds on to the
  garish linoleum pattern; and when the blinds were stirred by the breeze the
  light skipped along the floor like moving swords; he could not endure that,
  anyway. He went to the windows and drew up the blinds, one after the other.
  They would hear that, he reflected, if they were awake; they would know he
  was not asleep.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered her as he had seen her less than a twelvemonth before;
  standing knee-deep in the grasses by the river-bank at Parminters. Everywhere
  that he had loved her was so clear now in his mind, and everywhere else was
  so unreal and dim. He heard the tinkle of the Head's piano and saw her
  puzzling intently over some easy Chopin mazurka, her golden hair flame-like
  in the sunlight of the afternoon. He saw the paths and fields of Millstead,
  all radiant where she and he had been, and the moonlight lapping the pavilion
  steps, where, first of all, he had touched her lips with his. And
  then&mdash;only with an effort could he picture this&mdash;he saw the grim
  room downstairs, where she lay all wet and bedraggled, those cheeks that' he
  had kissed ice-cold and salt with the sea. The moon, emerging fully from
  behind a mist, plunged him suddenly in white light; at that moment it seemed
  to him that he was living in some ugly nightmare, and that shortly he would
  wake from it and find all the tragedy untrue. Helen was alive and well: he
  could only have imagined her dead. And downstairs, in that
  sitting-room&mdash;it had been no more than a dream, fearful and&mdash;thank
  God&mdash;false. Helen was away, somewhere, perfectly well and
  happy&mdash;<i>somewhere</i>. And downstairs, in that sitting-room...Anyhow,
  he would go down and see, to convince himself. He unlocked the bedroom door
  and tiptoed out on to the landing. He saw the moon's rays caught
  phosphorescently on a fish in a glass case. Down the two flights of stairs he
  descended with caution, and then, at the foot, strove to recollect which was
  the room. He saw two doors, with something written on them. One was the
  bar-parlour, he thought, where the worthies of Seacliffe congregated nightly.
  He turned the handle and saw the glistening brass of the beer-engines. Then
  the other door, might be? He tried the handle, but the door was locked.
  Somehow this infuriated him. "They lock the doors and turn off the gas!" he
  cried, vehemently, uniting his complaints. Then suddenly he caught sight of
  another door in the wall opposite, a door on which there was no writing at
  all. He had an instant conviction that this must be <i>the</i> door. He
  strode to it, menacingly, took hold of its handle in a firm grasp, and
  pushed. Locked again! This time he could not endure the fury that raged
  within him. "Good God!" he cried, shouting at the top of his voice, "I'll
  burst every door in the place in!" He beat on the panels with his fists,
  shouting and screaming the whole while...</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the hotel-porter and the barman, clad in trousers and
  shirt only, were holding his arms on either side, and the proprietress,
  swathed in a pink dressing-gown, was standing a little way off, staring at
  him curiously. And he was complaining to her about the turning off of the gas
  at midnight. "One really has a right to expect something more generous from
  the best hotel in Seacliffe," he was saying, with an argumentative mildness
  that surprised himself. "It is not as though this were a sixpenny doss-house.
  It is an A.A. listed hotel, and I consider it absolutely scandalous
  that..."</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p class="first">Strangely, when he was back again and alone in his own
  bedroom, he felt different. His gas-jet was burning again, evidently as a
  result of his protest; the victory gave him a curious, childish pleasure. Nor
  did his burdens weigh so heavily on him; indeed, he felt even peaceful enough
  to try to sleep. He undressed and got into bed.</p>

  <p>And then, slowly, secretly, dreadfully, he discovered that he was thinking
  about Clare! It frightened him&mdash;this way she crept into his thoughts as
  pain comes after the numbness of a blow. He knew he ought not to think of
  her. He ought to put her out of his mind, at any rate, for the present. Helen
  dead this little while, and already Clare in his thoughts! The realisation
  appalled him, terrified him by affording him a glimpse into the depths of his
  own dark soul. And yet&mdash;he <i>could not help it</i>. Was he to be blamed
  for the thoughts that he could not drive out of his mind? He prayed urgently
  and passionately for sleep, that he might rid himself of the lurking, lurking
  image of her. But even in sleep he feared he might dream of her.</p>

  <p>Oh, Clare, Clare, would she ever come to him now, now that he was alone
  and Helen was dead? God, the awfulness of the question! Yet he could not put
  it away from him; he could but deceive himself, might be, into thinking he
  was not asking it. He wanted Clare. Not more than ever&mdash;only as much as
  he had always wanted her.</p>

  <p>He wondered solemnly if the stuff in him were rotten; if he were proven
  vile and debased because he wanted her; if he were cancelling his soul by
  thinking of her so soon. And yet&mdash;God help him; even if all that were
  so, <i>he could not help it</i>. If he were to be damned eternally for
  thinking about Clare, then let him be damned eternally. Actions he might
  control, but never the strains and cravings of his own mind. If he were
  wrong, therefore, let him be wrong.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether, when he fell asleep, he would dream about Helen or
  about Clare. And yet, when at last his very tiredness made him close his
  eyes, he dreamed of neither of them, but slept in perfect calm, as a child
  that has been forgiven.<br>
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>In the morning they brought his breakfast up to him in bed, and with it a
  letter and a telegram. The chambermaid asked him dubiously if he were feeling
  better and he replied: "Oh yes, much better, thanks." Only vaguely could he
  remember what had taken place during the night.</p>

  <p>When the girl had gone and he had glanced at the handwriting on the
  envelope, he had a sudden paralysing shock, for it was Helen's!</p>

  <p>The postmark was: "Seacliffe, 10.10 p.m."</p>

  <p>He tore open the envelope with slow and awful dread, and took out a single
  sheet of Beach Hotel notepaper. Scribbled on it in pencil was just:</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR KENNETH ("Dear" underlined),&mdash;Good-bye, darling.
  I can't bear you not to be happy. Forget me and don't worry. They will think
  it has been an accident, and you mustn't tell them anything else. Leave
  Millstead and take Clare away. Be happy with her.&mdash;Yours, HELEN."<br>
  <br>
  "P.S.&mdash;There's one thing I'm sorry for. On the last night before we left
  Millstead I said something about Clare and Pritchard. Darling, it was a
  lie&mdash;I made it up because I couldn't bear you to love Clare so much. I
  don't mind now. Forgive me."</p>

  <p>A moment later he was opening the telegram and reading:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Shall arrive Seacliffe Station one fifteen meet me
  Clare."</p>

  <p>It had been despatched from Millstead at nine-five that morning, evidently
  as soon as the post office opened.</p>

  <p>He ate no breakfast. It was a quarter past eleven and the sun was
  streaming in through the window&mdash;the first spring day of the year. He
  re-read the letter.</p>

  <p>Strange that until then the thought that the catastrophe could have been
  anything at all but accidental had never even remotely occurred to him Now it
  came as a terrible revelation, hardly to be believed, even with proof; a
  revelation of that utmost misery that had driven her to the sea. He had known
  that she was not happy, but he had never guessed that she might be miserable
  to death.</p>

  <p>And what escape was there now from his own overwhelming guilt? She had
  killed herself because he had not made her happy. Or else because she had not
  been able to make him happy. Whichever it was, he was fearfully to blame. She
  had killed herself to make room for that other woman who had taken all the
  joy out of her life.</p>

  <p>And at one-fifteen that other woman would arrive in Seacliffe.</p>

  <p>In the darkest depths of his remorse he vowed that he would not meet her,
  see her, or hold any communication with her ever again, so long as his life
  lasted. He would hate her eternally, for Helen's sake. He would dedicate his
  life to the annihilation of her in his mind. Why was she coming? Did she
  know? How <i>could</i> she know? He raved at her mentally, trying to involve
  her in some share of his own deep treachery, for even the companionship of
  guilt was at least companionship. The two of them&mdash;Clare and
  himself&mdash;had murdered Helen. The two of them&mdash;together.
  <i>Together</i>. There was black magic in the intimacy that that word
  implied&mdash;magic in the guilty secret that was between them, in the
  passionate iniquity that was alluring even in its baseness!</p>

  <p>He dressed hurriedly, and with his mind in a ferment, forgot his breakfast
  till it was cold and then found it too unpalatable to eat. As he descended
  the stairs and came into the hotel lobby he remarked to the proprietress:
  "Oh, by the way, I must apologise for making a row last night. Fact is, my
  nerves, you know...Rather upset..."</p>

  <p>"Quite all right, Mr. Speed. I'm sure we all understand and sympathise
  with you. If there's any way we can help you, you know...Shall you be in to
  lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Lunch? Oh yes&mdash;er&mdash;I mean, no. No, I don't think I
  shall&mdash;not to-day. You see there are&mdash;er&mdash;arrangements to
  make&mdash;er&mdash;arrangements, you know..."</p>

  <p>He smiled, and with carefully simulated nonchalance, commenced to light a
  cigarette! When he got outside the hotel he decided that it was absolutely
  the wrong thing to have done. He flung the cigarette into the gutter. What
  was the matter with him? Something,&mdash;something that made him, out of
  very fear, do ridiculous and inappropriate things The same instinct, no
  doubt, that always made him talk loudly when he was nervous. And then he
  remembered that April morning of the year before, when he had first of all
  entered the Headmaster's study at Millstead; for then, through nervousness,
  he had spoken loudly, almost aggressively, to disguise his embarrassment.
  What a curious creature he was, and how curious people must think him.</p>

  <p>He strolled round the town, bought a morning paper at the newsagent's, and
  pretended to be interested in the contents. Over him like a sultry shadow lay
  the disagreeable paraphernalia of the immediate future: doctors, coroner,
  inquest, lawyers, interviews with Doctor and Mrs. Ervine, and so on. It had
  all to be gone through, but for the present he would try to forget it. The
  turmoil of his own mind, that battle which was being waged within his inmost
  self, that strife which no coroner would guess, those secrets which no
  inquest would or could elicit; these were the things of greater import. In
  the High Street, leading up from the Pierhead, he saw half a dozen stalwart
  navvies swinging sledge-hammers into the concrete road-bed. He stopped,
  ostensibly to wait for a tram, but really to watch them. He envied them,
  passionately; envied their strength and animal simplicity; envied above all
  their lack of education and ignorance of themselves, their happy blindness
  along the path of life. He wished he could forget such things as Art and
  Culture and Education, and could become as they, or as he imagined them to
  be. Their lives were brimful of <i>real</i> things, things to be held and
  touched&mdash;hammers and levers and slabs of concrete. With all their crude
  joy and all their pain, simple and physical, their souls grew strong and
  stark. He envied them with a passion that made him desist at last from the
  sight of them, because it hurt.</p>

  <p>The town-hall clock began the hour of noon, and that reminded him of
  Clare, and of the overwhelming fact that she was at that moment in the train
  hastening to Seacliffe. Was he thinking of her again? He went into a café and
  ordered in desperation a pot of China tea and some bread and butter, as if
  the mere routine of a meal would rid his mind of her. For desire was with him
  still, nor could he stave it off. Nothing that he could ever discover,
  however ugly or terrible, could stop the craving of him for Clare. The things
  that they had begun together, he and she, had no ending in this world. And
  suddenly all sense of free-will left him, and he felt himself propelled at a
  mighty rate towards her, wherever she might be; fate, surely, guiding him to
  her, but this time, a fate that was urging him from within, not pressing him
  from without. And he knew, secretly, whatever indignant protests he might
  make to himself about it, that when the 1:15 train entered Seacliffe station
  he would be waiting there on the platform for her. The thing was inevitable,
  like death.</p>

  <p>But inevitability did not spare him torment. And at last his remorse
  insisted upon a compromise. He would meet Clare, he decided, but when he had
  met her, he would proceed to torture her, subtly, shrewdly&mdash;seeking
  vengeance for the tragedy that she had brought to his life, and the spell
  that she had cast upon his soul. He would be the Grand Inquisitor.</p>

  <p>He was very white and haggard when the time came. He had reached the
  station as early as one o'clock, and for a quarter of an hour had lounged
  about the deserted platforms. Meanwhile the sun shone gloriously, and the
  train as it ran into the station caught the sunlight on its windows. The
  sight of the long line of coaches, curving into the station like a flaming
  sword into its scabbard, gave him a mighty heartrending thrill. Yes,
  yes&mdash;he would torture her...His eyes glinted with diabolical
  exhilaration, and a touch of hectic colour crept into his wan cheeks. He
  watched her alight from a third-class compartment near the rear of the train.
  Then he lost her momentarily amidst the emptying crowd. He walked briskly
  against the stream of the throng, with a heart that beat fast with
  unutterable expectations.</p>

  <p>But how he loved her as he saw her coming towards him!&mdash;though he
  tried with all his might to kindle hate in his heart. She smiled and held out
  her tiny hand. He took it with a limpness that was to begin his torture of
  her. She was to notice that limpness.</p>

  <p>"How is Helen?" was her first remark.</p>

  <p>Amidst the bustle of the luggage round the guard's van he replied quietly:
  "Helen? Oh, she's all right. I didn't tell her you were coming."</p>

  <p>"You were wise," she answered.</p>

  <p>A faint thrill of anticipation crept over him; this diabolical game was
  interesting, fascinating, in its way; and would lead her very securely into a
  number of traps. And why, he thought, did she think it was wise of him not to
  have told Helen?</p>

  <p>In the station-yard she suddenly stopped to consult a time-table
  hoarding.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for the next train back to Millstead."</p>

  <p>"Not the <i>next</i>, surely?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? What do you think I've come for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know in the least. What <i>have</i> you come for?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him appealingly. He saw, with keen and instant relish, that
  she had already noticed something of hostility in his attitude towards her.
  The torture had begun. For the first time, she was subject to his power and
  not he to hers.</p>

  <p>"I've come for a few minutes' conversation," she answered, quietly. "And
  the next train back is at 3:18."</p>

  <p>"You mean to travel by that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then we needn't stay in the station till then, need we? Let's walk
  somewhere. We've two whole hours&mdash;time enough to get right out of the
  town and back again. I hate conversations in railway-stations."</p>

  <p>But his chief reason was a desire to secure the right scenic background
  for his torture of her.</p>

  <p>"All right," she answered, and looked at him again appealingly. The tears
  almost welled into his own eyes because of the deep sadness that was in hers.
  How quick she was to feel his harshness!&mdash;he thought. How marvellously
  sensitive was that little soul of hers to the subtlest gradations of his own
  mood! What fiendish torture he could put her to, by no more, might be, than
  the merest upraising of an eyebrow, the faintest change of the voice, the
  slightest tightening of the lips! She was of mercury, like himself;
  responsive to every touch of the emotional atmosphere. And was not that the
  reason why she understood him with such wonderful instinctive
  intimacy&mdash;was not that the reason why the two of them, out of the whole
  world, would have sought each other like twin magnets?</p>

  <p>He led her, in silence, through the litter of mean streets near the
  station, and thence, beyond the edge of the town, towards the meadows that
  sloped to the sea. So far it had been a perfect day, but now the sun was
  half-quenching itself in a fringe of mist that lay along the horizon; and
  with the change there came a sudden pink light that lit both their faces and
  shone behind them on the tawdry newness of the town, giving it for once a
  touch of pitiful loveliness. He took her into a rolling meadow that tapered
  down into a coppice, and as they reached the trees the last shaft of sunlight
  died from the sky. Then they plunged into the grey depths, with all the
  freshly-budded leaves brushing against their faces, and the very earth, so it
  seemed, murmuring at their approach. Already there was the hint of rain in
  the air.</p>

  <p>"It's a long way to come for a few minutes' conversation," he began.</p>

  <p>She answered, ignoring his remark: "I had a letter from Helen this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i>!" he exclaimed in sharp fear. He went suddenly white.</p>

  <p>"A letter," she went on, broodingly. "Would you like to see it?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her and replied: "I would rather hear from you what it was
  about."</p>

  <p>He saw her brown eyes looking up curiously into his, and he had the
  instant feeling that she would cry if he persisted in his torture of her. The
  silence of that walk from the station had unnerved her, had made her
  frightened of him. That was what he had intended. And she did not know
  yet&mdash;did not know what he knew. Poor girl-what a blow was in waiting for
  her! But he must not let it fall for a little while.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip and said: "Very well. It was about you. She was unhappy
  about you. Dreadfully unhappy. She said she was going to leave you. She also
  said&mdash;that she was going to leave you&mdash;to&mdash;to me."</p>

  <p>Her voice trembled on that final word.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She recovered herself to continue with more energy: "And I've come here to
  tell you this&mdash;that if she does 'leave you, I shan't have you. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>"You are making large assumptions."</p>

  <p>"I know. And I don't mind your sarcasm, though don't think any more of you
  for using it...I repeat what I said&mdash;if Helen leaves you or if you leave
  Helen, I shall have nothing more to do with you."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly kind of you to warn me in time."</p>

  <p>"You've never given Helen a fair trial. I know you and she are
  ill-matched. I know you oughtn't to have married her at all, but that doesn't
  matter&mdash;you've done it, and you've got to be fair to her. And if you
  think that because I've confessed that I love you I'm in your power for you
  to be cruel to, you're mistaken!" Her voice rose passionately.</p>

  <p>He stared at her, admiring the warm flush that came into her cheeks, and
  all the time pitying her, loving her, agonisingly!</p>

  <p>"Understand," she went on, "You've got to look after Helen&mdash;you've
  got to take care of her&mdash;watch her&mdash;do you know what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No. What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean you must try to make her happy. She's sick and miserable, and,
  somehow, you must cure her. I came here to see you because I thought I could
  persuade you to be kind to her. I thought if you loved me at all, you might
  do it for my sake. Remember I love Helen as well as you. Do you still think
  I'm hard-hearted and cold? If you knew what goes on inside me, the racking,
  raging longing&mdash;the&mdash;No, no&mdash;what's the good of talking of
  that to you? You either understand or else you don't, and if you don't, no
  words of mine will make you...But I warn you again, you must cure Helen of
  her unhappiness. Otherwise, she might try to cure herself&mdash;in any way,
  drastic or not, that occurred to her. Do you know now what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't, even yet."</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;her voice became harder&mdash;"it's this, if you want plain
  speaking. Watch her in case she kills herself. She's thinking of it."</p>

  <p>He went ashen pale again and said quietly, after a long pause. "How do you
  know that?"</p>

  <p>"Her letter."</p>

  <p>"She mentioned it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And that's what you've come to warn me about?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And to persuade you, if I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why did you decide that a personal visit was necessary?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have cared to tell you all this by letter. And besides, a
  letter wouldn't have been nearly as quick, would it? You see I only received
  her letter this morning. After all, the matter's urgent enough. One can
  easily be too late."</p>

  <p>He said, with eyes fixed steadily upon her: "Clare, you <i>are</i> too
  late. She drowned herself last night."</p>

  <p>He expected she would cry or break down or do something dramatic that he
  could at any rate endure. But instead of that, she stared vacantly into the
  fast-deepening gloom of the coppice, stared infinitely, terribly, without
  movement or sound. Horror tore nakedly through her eyes like pain, though not
  a muscle of her face stirred from that fearful, statuesque immobility.
  Moments passed. Far over the intervening spaces came the faint chiming of the
  half-hour on the town-hall clock, and fainter still, but ominous-sounding,
  the swirl of the waves on the distant beach as the wind rose and
  freshened.</p>

  <p>He could not bear that silence and that stillness of hers. It seemed as
  though it would be eternal. And suddenly he saw that she was really
  suffering, excruciatingly; and he could not bear it, because he loved her.
  And then all his plans for torturing her, all his desires for vengeance, all
  his schemes to make her suffer as he had suffered, all the hate of her that
  he had manufactured in his heart&mdash;all was suddenly gone, like worthless
  dust scoured by the gale. He perceived that they were one in suffering as in
  guilt-fate's pathetic flotsam, aching to cling together even in the last
  despairing drift.</p>

  <p>He cried, agonisingly: "Clare! Clare! Oh, for God's sake, don't stare at
  me like that, Clare! Oh, my darling, my dear darling, I'm
  sorry&mdash;sorry&mdash;I'm dead with sorrow! Clare&mdash;Clare&mdash;be kind
  to me. Clare&mdash;kinder than I have been to you or to Helen!..."</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p class="first">She said, quietly: "I must get back in time for my
  train."</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;not yet. Don't go. Don't leave me."</p>

  <p>"I must."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know I must. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>He became calmer. It was as if she had willed him to become calmer, as if
  some of the calmness of her was passing over to him. "Clare," he said,
  eagerly, "do you think I'm <i>bad</i>-am
  I&mdash;<i>rotten-souled</i>&mdash;because of what's happened? Am I
  <i>damned</i>, do you think?"</p>

  <p>She answered softly: "No. You're not. And you mustn't think you are. Don't
  I love you? Would I love you if you were rotten? Would you love me if I
  was?"</p>

  <p>He replied, gritting his teeth: "I would love you if you were filth
  itself."</p>

  <p>"Ah, would you?" she, answered, with wistful pathos in her voice. "But I'm
  not like that. I love you for what I know you are, for what I know you could
  be!"</p>

  <p>"Could be? Could have been! But Clare, Clare&mdash;who's to blame?"</p>

  <p>"So many things happen dreadfully in this world and nobody knows who's to
  blame."</p>

  <p>"But not this, Clare. <i>We're</i> to blame.</p>

  <p>"We can be to blame without being&mdash;all that you said."</p>

  <p>"Can we? Can we? There's another thing. If Helen had&mdash;had
  lived&mdash;she would have had a baby in a few months' time..."</p>

  <p>He paused, waiting for her reply, but none came. She went very pale. At
  last she said, with strange unrestfulness: "What can I say? What <i>is</i>
  there to say?...Oh, don't let us go mad through thinking of it! We
  <i>have</i> been wrong, but have we been as wrong as that? Hasn't there been
  fate in it? Fate can do the awfullest things...My dear, dear man, we should
  go mad if we took all that load of guilt on ourselves! It is too heavy for
  repentance...Oh, you're not <i>bad</i>, not inwardly. And neither am I. We've
  been instruments&mdash;puppets&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's good to think so. But is it true?"</p>

  <p>"Before God, I think it is...Think of it all right from the
  beginning...Right from the night you met us both at Millstead...It's easy to
  blame fate for what we've done, but isn't it just as easy to blame ourselves
  for the workings of fate?"</p>

  <p>She added, uneasily: "I <i>must</i> go back. My train. Don't forget the
  time."</p>

  <p>"Can't you wait for the next?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Dear</i>, you <i>know</i> I mustn't. How could I stay? Fate's finished
  with us now. We've free-will...Didn't I tell you we weren't <i>bad</i>? All
  that's why I can't stay."</p>

  <p>They began to walk back to the railway-station. A mist-like rain was
  beginning to fall, and everything was swathed in grey dampness. They talked
  together like two age-long friends, partners in distress and suffering; he
  told her, carefully and undramatically, the story of the night before.</p>

  <p>She said to him, from the carriage-window just before the 3:18 steamed
  out: "I shan't see you again for ever such a long while. I wish&mdash;I wish
  I could stay with you and help you. But I can't...You know why I can't, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know why. We must be brave Alone: We must learn, if we can, to
  call ourselves good again."</p>

  <p>"Yes...Yes...We must start life anew. No more mistakes. And you must grow
  back again to what you used to be...The next few months will be
  terrible&mdash;maddening&mdash;for both of us. But <i>I</i> can bear them. Do
  you think <i>you</i> can&mdash;without me? If I thought you
  couldn't"&mdash;her voice took on a sudden wild passion&mdash;"if I thought
  you would break down under the strain, if I thought the fight would crush and
  kill you, I would stay with you from this moment and never, never leave you
  alone! I would-I would&mdash;if I thought there was no other way!"</p>

  <p>He said, calmly and earnestly: "I can fight it, Clare. I shall not break
  down. Trust me. And then&mdash;some day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him hurriedly. "I am going abroad very soon. I don't know
  for how long, but for a long while, certainly. And while I am away I shall
  not write to you, and you must not write to me, either. Then, when I come
  back..."</p>

  <p>He looked up into her eyes and smiled. The guard was blowing his
  whistle.</p>

  <p>"Be brave these next few months," she said again.</p>

  <p>"I will," he answered. He added: "I shall go home."</p>

  <p>"What? Home. Home to the millionaire soap-boiler?" (A touch of the old
  half-mocking Clare.)</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's my home. They've always been very good to me."</p>

  <p>"Of course they have. I'm glad you've realised it." Then the train began
  to move. "Good-bye!" she said, holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" he cried, taking it and clasping it quickly as he walked along
  the platform with the train. "See you again," he added, almost in a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>She gave him such a smile, with tears streaming down her cheeks, as he
  would never, never forget.</p>

  <p>When he went out again into the station-yard the fine rain vas falling
  mercilessly. He felt miserable, sick with A new as well as an old misery, but
  stirred by a hope that would never let him go.</p>

  <p>Back then to the Beach Hotel, vowing and determining for the future,
  facing in anticipation the ordeals of the dark days ahead, summoning up
  courage and fortitude, bracing himself for terror and conflict and
  desire...And with it all hoping, hoping...hoping everlastingly.</p>
