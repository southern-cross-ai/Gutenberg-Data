<p>Unity essential to the city requires for so complex a problem
a simple organism.</p>
<p>The factors consist in the advantages of the location on the
one hand and the civic necessities on the other.</p>
<p>For Canberra, an equation thus of the conditions of the site
(1) with the functions, (2) to which they are to be adapted, is
indicated in the following abstract, the numerals indexing the
subsequent elaboration:&mdash;</p>

<h3>1. SITE CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>
<p>The peculiar advantages of Canberra lie principally in the
following characteristics, with each of which is indicated the
chief adaptability recognised:&mdash;</p>

Australia, he to the south and west, properly sunlit for the

<p class="negindent">Ainslie, Black Mountain, Mugga Mugga, rising
almost 700 feet (too lofty and too exposed for building
purposes), afford objective points of prospect to terminate great
garden and water vistas, with conspicuous positions for future
commemorative monuments, and conversely offer points of outlook
over a city arranged in an orderly way with reference to
them.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<p class="indent">The isolated conical aspect of Ainslie and its
alignment with two central eminences on the opposite side of the
Molonglo suggested the lesser one of these vistas. The apposition
of Black Mountain, with the general direction of the waterway and
the broad prospect of the Queanbeyan Plains to the eastward,
suggest its transverse and more marked vista opening or axis.<br>

<p class="negindent">Eminences rising to 200 feet furnish most
appropriate public building sites to terminate main thoroughfares
disposed with reference to them and often in apposition with the
mountains also. The natural contribution of elevated foundations
that may be treated in a variety of ways, formal and informal, is
an asset for architectural impressiveness not to be wasted. These
hills, however, are not considered to dictate either the public
buildings, sites, or main thoroughfare lines, except in the light
of other determining factors.<br>

<p class="negindent">The considerable central flats are
unavailable for building purposes, but eminently suitable for a
waterway of the largest extent that would be consistent with a
location in the heart of the city, where only, on the other hand,
a water feature of the restricted size procurable at Canberra can
maintain a dignity in keeping with its purpose.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<p class="indent">The practicability of maintaining a surface of
5 square miles of water is verified by all known data, provided
proper precautions are taken in the head waters of the Queanbeyan
and Molonglo Rivers. Moreover, there are additional river
supplies available within the limits of expense proportionate to
any unprecedented or possible need.<br>

<p class="negindent">The open alluvial fields, flat or
undulating, are most suitable for ordinary purposes of industry
and habitation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<p class="indent">Within the site these areas are practically all
swept by the dominant winter westerly winds, since only heights
of the scale and abruptness of Ainslie, Pleasant Hill, Black
Mountain, Mugga Mugga, or Red Hill afford appreciable protection
to narrow skirtings, which occur in no considerable case within
the city limits. Not more than one-sixth of the official site can
be considered so protected, and that in instances too scattered
and too rugged for development for general purposes. Such
protection can only be accommodated in suburban extensions to be
provided north and south as illustrated in the original premiated
plan.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<p class="indent">However, experiment with winds of the ordinary
winter velocity on the Australian plateau indicates that a
moderate amount of easily effected tree growth will afford
sufficient protection for situations such as even the most
exposed on this site, a fact further attested by the generally
acknowledged attractiveness for habitation of the tops of spurs
extending west from Capitol Hill.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<p class="indent">As an initial deterrent to occupation, the wind
may be discounted by the present local experience, wherein
temporary settlement has been created in an area&mdash;possibly
the most wind-swept of all&mdash;with very slight or no tree
protection. Here the first permanent residence has been located
after ten months' residential experience in a tent on one of the
most exposed points, commanding, however, the mountain view.</p>

<tr>

<p class="indent">The slopes north of the river basin comprising
the flat areas having the finest prospect of the mountain
background, and of central dominating sites for the most
important public architectural group offer the greatest scenic
advantages, and are to be given preference for the most general
industrial and domestic functions for the democratic purpose of
"the greatest good for the greatest number."</p>

<br>
<p>Taken altogether, the site may be considered as an irregular
amphitheatre&mdash;with Ainslie at the north-east in the rear,
flanked on either side by Black Mountain and Pleasant Hill, all
forming the top galleries; with the slopes to the water, the
auditorium; with the waterway and flood basin, the arena; with
the southern slopes reflected in the basin, the terraced stage
and setting of monumental Government structures sharply defined
rising tier on tier to the culminating highest internal forested
hill of the Capitol; and with Mugga Mugga, Red Hill, and the blue
distant mountain ranges, sun reflecting, forming the back scene
of the theatrical whole.</p>

<h3>2. FUNCTIONS.</h3>
<p>The importance of classifying the purposes of the city lies in
the fact that only by proceeding from generals to particulars,
from the more essential to the lesser essential, and from the
ends desired to the means for obtaining them are natural
relationships established.</p>
<p>The generalizations are derivable from tendencies of actual
growth in modern cities.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">OCCUPATION.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The advantages the city offers to the various classes of
occupants who will reside in and utilize its spaces constitute
its reason for being. The various kinds of occupation have divers
needs to be met as to area, position, and environment. Secondly,
their accommodation requires a communication system&mdash;the
social means of linking up these elements.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">PUBLIC
GROUPS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.11.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>From the stand-point not only of general interest, but also of
effective control, the character of fixed occupancy divides
primarily into two branches&mdash;public and private. In the
Capital City the former takes precedence, and is treated in a
very broad way, because extension of functions may easily go
beyond any present basis of expectation. Simplest possible
arrangement on the most general lines of classification are
adopted at the start to ensure both room for expansion and a
constant coherence.</p>
<p>The general arrangement of Public Functions in this plan is
illustrated in the accompanying scheme, in which they are first
separated into those appurtaining to the Federation as a whole,
and those concerning the City merely.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image2" id="Image2"></a><img alt=""

Public Groups</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">FEDERAL
GROUP.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.111.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Because of unity of control all Federal improvements can be
made to contribute to a single dominating group, and since these
buildings and spaces can be assorted into four distinct classes,
Governmental, Recreational, Educational, and Military, these four
are established to form the structural bounds and terminals of
two co-ordinate axes.</p>
<p>The unmistakable pre-eminence of Ainslie and Black Mountains
ordained them for apposition with such axes, to which the site
contributed further opportunity in the general direction of the
Waterway, extending towards Black Mountain at right angles to a
line joining Ainslie with the most prominent spur of the opposite
range, "Kurrajong," and with a lesser eminence between, "Canberra
Hill," directly at its front.</p>
<p>The co-ordinate axes disposed accordingly are not with the
cardinal points of the compass, which would entail 25 per cent.
building frontage without beneficial sunlight, nor with the
diagonal points where, for part of the day, no shade could be
found; but they lie midway between these extremes.</p>
<p>They are not primarily thoroughfares, but give a connected
park or garden frontage for all the important structures, and can
be developed, as in the case of the Mall at Washington, with
scope for artistic expression, little hampered by utilitarian
limitations, affording the greatest ease and comfort for
observation of the capital.</p>
<p>In general, this arrangement of all the Federal buildings on
heights about two co-ordinate axes, their individual groups, set
off and connected by formal water basins, forms one combination
of parallel set buildings, to which the possible confusion of
other enterprises must ever remain subordinate.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">PRIMARY
DIVISION.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1111.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The two more general and earlier developed functions of the
Federal Group will be Government and Recreation.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">GOVERNMENT.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.11111.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Representative Government in all its ordinary functions is to
be classed as deliberative and limited, and is properly
stationed, in a Capital, in an accessible but still quiet area.
On the basis of the two lines hereinafter designated "Water Axis"
and "Land Axis", it is a simple matter to allot to the commanding
Capitol the highest spur on the land axis mentioned as suitable
for building purposes, "Kurrajong," and to locate the Parliament
Houses on the lower offshoot, "Canberra Hill," on the same line
towards Ainslie. Other Departmental buildings bounding a water
court of the next lower terrace extend to a solid terrace front
of buildings and to still lower boulevarded embankments along the
central basin of the co-ordinate water axis.</p>
<p>Centrally located, the Capitol is focussed in an extensive
hill park, and at that has a limited function, either as a
general administration structure for popular reception and
ceremonial, or for housing archives and commemorating Australian
achievements rather than for deliberation or counsel; at any rate
representing the sentimental and spiritual head, if not the
actual working mechanism of the Government of the Federation.
"Kurrajong" is deemed too large and too high for a convenient
working organization of Parliament, but, being the only
conspicuous internal eminence that has a skyline visible from
practically every portion of the city, it lends itself to an
architectural treatment that need comprise little more than in
the necessary ramps, stairs, and terraces for outlook to make it,
by its natural bulk, the dominating architectural feature.</p>
<p>Moreover, the views command not only the entire city, but,
through gaps, the Yarralumla Valley and mountain chains of the
Murrumbidgee watershed, the most spectacular features of the
landscape, and the irregularity and variety of the hill slopes
afford ideal surroundings for an isolated Capitol structure, and
most appropriate setting for the two official residences, those
of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>However, the possibilities of the site are not limited to this
recommendation as to the Governor-General for immediate adoption,
and though a large park may be connected by private unintersected
low level open passage-way from the central position, and extend
as far as may be into the hills to the west, forming a domain, it
is entirely practicable to locate the Government House itself in
the latter area, as alternately provided for, still maintaining
parallel, axial, architectural affiliation with the Capitol.</p>
<p>The whole group of Government buildings is directed out from
the one popular point along lines of sequence in function. The
fact that Parliament is in two "Houses" is an incident in
addition to the topographical situation that precludes making of
that structure a focal feature.</p>
<p>The plateau stretching between Kurrajong and Canberra Hill
provides sufficient foreground from the former to set off the
Parliament House on the latter, over which, however, the court of
the Departmental Buildings on the next terrace below may yet be
seen, while the view beyond is uninterrupted across the Basin,
and the water front of the Public Gardens and along a broad
plaisance to Ainslie. Parliament Building, on the edge of
Canberra Hill, has an elevation of 50 feet above the succeeding
plateau, and is approached therefrom by wide ramps around the
fountain end of a terrace reservoir. From this terrace court of
the reservoir the Parliament edifice has thus a lofty setting,
stopping the long axis of the reservoir, crowned by the lofty
Capitol behind, and supported on the flanks by the lower
Departmental Buildings.</p>
<p>The ensemble presents excellent opportunity for cumulative
massing.</p>
<p>The central terrace court of the Government Group lies 35 feet
above the lowest terrace, from which it is separated by the
buildings along the waterway frontage, but to which access is
given by ramps at ends and flights of steps between the
structures.</p>
<p>The court terrace, however, is carried on the roof of a
central building of the waterway embankment, which projects into
the Basin, crowned toward the water by an open colonnade,
surmounting a slight bank of steps to afford an open forum,
beneath which the structure serves as a launch entrance or
"Water-gate."</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The Governmental Group silhouetted against the dark forested
hills is best seen from the other arm of the land axis, where
most appropriately may be located the public gardens, essentially
the show places of the City. This recreational function of the
Commonwealth Capital will appurtain to the people directly as
distinguished from their representatives or agents or servants.
It is, therefore, to be situated rather directly in communication
with the congregation centres, and tributary to the homes of the
people, than connected with any other Federal Group. The Circular
Pools and connecting Basin of the waterway essentially belong to
this group, and are adapted, by their continuous boulevarded
embankments, for a continuous motor route, and for water sports,
pageants, and bathing, the central Basin incidentally forming a
rowing-course of 1 mile between terminal bridges.</p>
<p>The Stadium for general assembly faces the waterway, and is
recessed into the slope of the bank, where it does not interrupt
the continuous vista along the land axis. The Theatre and Opera
House, on either side, are reached from the municipal avenue on
one hand, and from the boulevard of the water front garden on the
other, for maximum accessibility from the residential districts.
Farther to each side of the land axis are paired Galleries of the
graphic and plastic arts; the Museums for natural history and
archeology; the Zoological Gardens and the Baths, and Gymnasia;
all together affording for the business and residential districts
an appropriate front to correspond with the governmental
aggregation on the other long side of the central Basin.</p>
<p>Recreation comprehends, also, a formal plaisance 600 feet
wide, all the way to the Casino, a park feature, at the foot of
Mt. Ainslie, with ramp drives to points of vantage on the slopes
overlooking the whole city and surrounding country, and setting
off such commemorative national monuments as may be appropriately
most conspicuous.</p>
<p>Maximum effectiveness for the waters is attained by widening
as much as possible between the necessary bridges.</p>
<p>The Molonglo is left in its present state in the lower
channelled reaches, where it forms a feature of the botanical
gardens and forest reserve continuous with Black Mountain,
incidentally perpetuating there the only remnant of primeval
luxuriance on the city site.</p>
<p>Here, a dam, so located as to combine with one of the road
crossings, impounds at 1825 elevation the lower outlying lake,
and the triple internal architectural lagoons bounding on three
sides the Governmental Group, reflecting the buildings,
augmenting humidity and aiding equability of atmosphere in the
heart of the city.</p>
<p>Another weir, with lakes on the line where the railway and a
main traffic route pass around the Government Reservation,
inundates the extensive upper bottom lands for a naturalistic
lake at 1835 level, practically coincident with the highest
recorded flood.</p>
<p>The circular pools and their connecting basin provide three
lagoons, each complete in itself, and all located in spaces
between the direct lines of communication joining focal centres.
At the same time, because of their largeness of scale and severe
simplicity, the lagoons conform to the architectural character of
the centre of the City, where any informal pond would be
ineffective.</p>
<p>Stepped and gently sloping embankments at slight comparative
expense offer better architectural possibilities and greater
utility than the more ordinary vertical revetments.</p>
<p>The two irregular lakes located as is the case of the formal
lagoons without intersecting the direct lines of communication
have an informal treatment that corresponds with the park-like,
irregular character of the City's first suburban zone and of the
more spacious recreation grounds facing them.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Of these two features, the University and Military Groups, the
former is recognised as of a more appropriately dominant
character, and is aligned with the terminus of the water axis at
the foot of Black Mountain. The situation of gentle undulation
largely under the mount's lee having wide scope, surrounded by
the inherently most attractive region of the City, is intersected
by a little lagoon arm, bordered by the lowest lake, and at the
same time overlooks the entire length of the other four of the
chain. This site is also in a position to utilize the botanical
gardens and mountain with its forestry reserve.</p>
<p>The scheme of the Educational Group comprises the fields for
higher education that may be taken up by a nation recognising the
enormous advantages and economies in federating all the
scientific, professional, technical, and practical branches for
both teaching and research.</p>
<p>Fundamental sciences, descriptive of nature, lead directly to
the theoretical sciences dependent upon them along lines of
derivation and through these, in appropriate combination, into
the lines along which they are applied to the work of
civilization. Some such arrangement is necessary to permit proper
expansion in ever-changing fields, with convenience to students.
Moreover, it is endeavoured to direct these lines on the site to
such openings for actual application as are most available to
them. Thus from Physiology, the gymnasia give on to the broad
flat athletic grounds and the water areas. And the hospital, of
itself in a most suitably isolated location with most equable
temperature and favorable atmospheric conditions, is adjoined by
the Medical, Surgical, and Pharmaceutic Schools. Thus Agriculture
adjoins the Botanical Gardens and the Forestry Reserve. Into the
base of Black Mountain extends Mining, while Engineering lies
between it and Architecture&mdash;both of which it
serves&mdash;and has maximum of room for expansion; Pedagogy,
Law, and Commerce approach the Civic centre of people, courts,
and offices.</p>

<p>The upper reach of the water axis has no commanding terminal
short of the blue hills of the Dividing Range, bounding the
outlook from the City over the Queanbeyan Plains, where a
spacious public park is allotted to one side of the upper lake,
and on the other are the grounds of the present Military College,
with the steep bald knoll of Pleasant Hill&mdash;the highest
crest within the City&mdash;their most conspicuous feature. This
may be crowned either by a future development of the Military
College, or, citadel like, given over, together with the adjacent
slopes, to the Military Post, with its armories, arsenals,
drill-halls, and barracks, commanding the railway fines,
overlooking the entire City, and flanking the gap eastward
towards the sea.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 33%;">MUNICIPAL
GROUPS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.112.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Buildings of the Municipality, those public edifices of
utility to the people of Canberra as a whole, afford further
opportunity for extending the harmonious public grouping of the
parallel-set system of the Federal Groups, by establishing a
subordinate axis adjoining the Recreation Group, which is most
nearly analogous to the general community functions.</p>
<p>Two separate characteristics distinguish these municipal
utilities&mdash;first, that of the official, clerical, and
administrative class; second, that of the material handling,
transportation, and merchandising class; and it would tend to
congestion to concentrate such conflicting though equally
important general functions in one centre. Two centres,
therefore, are fixed as the terminals of a municipal axis in the
form of an avenue, north of and parallel with the water axis,
each terminus connected with the garden and water feature of the
latter axis, by short park arms leading from the circular pools.
The essentially city functions are not only tributary to all the
inhabitants, as is the Recreation Group, but are to serve handily
the great Federal enterprises, which are here located in close
proximity in three cases, whereas connexion with the great
Government focus is direct, and access to its Departmental Groups
reasonably close. The two sites made use of for the Municipal
Centres are the important and isolated hill "Vernon" and the
slopes of like elevation lying between two terminating hills a
mile and a half to the eastward, and equi-distant with "Vernon"
from the great land and water axes. These two sites afford for
comprehensive treatment very different, but equally unusual,
architectural opportunities to develop large structure groups,
rising in pyramid and amphitheatre formations respectively.</p>

<p>The interval to the second of the municipal centres is

are equally accessible from the railway, from the Capitol, from
the residential sections, and especially from the agricultural
and industrial suburbs. At this second point are the Central
Station and the Public Produce Markets.</p>

<div style="float: left;">2.12.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>As we have learned through some phases of the generally
baneful "gridiron", there are advantages in rectangular plots,
and in orderly alignment of private, as well as of ppublic,
building groups.</p>
<p>The remarkable parallel in the respective needs of industry
demanding publicity; and of habitation requiring seclusion from
the stand-point of occupancy; with the needs of circulation for
business and of distribution only for access to retired
districts, from the stand-point of communication, makes feasible
an harmonious organic arrangement without conflict between street
and plot requirements.</p>
<p>Between the arms of the grand axes of public groups, private
buildings are allotted separate systems of co-ordinate axes,
determined by as many different base lines as are needed to
interconnect directly the main public features and all lesser
specialized centres.</p>
<p>Though these axes are routes and governed largely by
circulation considerations, each line commands a view of terminal
objectives, either natural or artificial, and each system of
co-ordinates offers rectangular sites for all buildings up to a
point of junction with the next similar system, while even at
these intersections no acute angles are permitted, for triangular
buildings are as expensive as they are irredeemably ugly. But the
allowed obtuse intersections afford a quadrilateral site
disposition, as economical as the rectangular type, with two long
prospects at each sweep of the cross connecting or ring
streets.</p>
<p>The angle blocks are, as a rule, less adapted for formal than
for informal and picturesque treatment, and excepting immediately
around the focal centres, where the completed plan figure is
manifest, they occur at the very points of least communication
and formality, and of greatest areas and cheapest land, where an
informal treatment is easiest and most appropriate.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">INDUSTRY.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The industries of this Capital City, aside from those
institutions which have been provided for in the Public Functions
which are the primary purposes of the Capital, may be considered
to be relatively simple in requirements, because the character of
the location does not indicate very large or special industrial
growth.</p>
<p>The principal operations are assumed to concern the internal
demands of the population, and they will be either general for
the whole community or for its main subdivisions, or local for
the immediate needs of residents</p>
.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">FOCAL
INDUSTRY.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1211.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The former class can be referred to as Focal.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">URBAN UNITS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.12111.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The more central focal units will naturally be the urban ones,
whose influence will extend over the entire city area, but the
disparity in the kind of traffic, as well as housing, between the
two principal urban Sanctions distinguishes one as
administrative, and another as mercantile, a difference which has
been recognised in the separation of the two public, official,
and market centres. The line of demarcation between governmental
and private control of these urban activities will tend to be
indefinite and variable, with changing standards of community
consciousness so they naturally, together, form single
groups.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 35%;">THE ADMINISTRATIVE
FOCUS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121111.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Contiguous with the Municipal Official Centre may, therefore,
be found the private offices and financial institutions, stock
and insurance exchanges, chambers for corporate enterprises, and
the professions.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 35%;">THE MERCANTILE
FOCUS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121112.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>To the Railway Station and Produce Market Centre will
naturally be attracted private general mercantile establishments
in the larger units, particularly wholesale, together with "goods
clearing," transfer systems, warehousing, and light
manufacturing.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">SUBURBAN
UNITS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.12112.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Suburban centres, situated at points topographically most
available, but at some distance from the heart of the city, are
established to help fix the internal routes and give some idea of
the extensive application of principles of planning, with
specialized direct connected centres, and with building sites,
rectangular so far as possible, varying in utility from a maximum
to a minimum of accessibility.</p>
<p>It is advisable to determine lines of extension as far ahead
as possible, as has been done in many German cities, generations
in advance of occupancy, to prevent ultimate obstruction of
orderly growth through misdirected improvements. Five of these
suburbs were indicated in the first premiated competitive plan,
one to be devoted to society congregation, three to agricultural
pursuits, and one to manufacturing.</p>
<p>In this preliminary draft of the internal city site the
originally suggested lines of approach to outlying suburbs have
been maintained.</p>
<p>Considerable elasticity must necessarily be allowed for in the
designation of outlying centres, because of the remoteness of the
anticipated period of occupancy.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">INITIAL TOWN.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121121.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>To meet special conditions imposed by the necessity of
occupancy south of the Molonglo, in advance of construction of
bridges, or the extension of the railway across to Yass, there
are introduced three local nuclei tributary to a preliminary
railway line already laid down.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there will be a population of 10,000 or
12,000 before the advent of Parliament, and it is possible that
the extension of the railway may not come until after that time.
Therefore, these initial centres will permit of a completely
organized small town, not merely for construction forces, but for
a variety of interests.</p>
<p>This district is plotted to correlate intimately with the
Public Groups, its central co-ordinate axes being parallel,
securing the same advantages of sun exposure, and disposed to
benefit fully from the upper circular basin water frontage,
through opposition with the ultimate Urban Mercantile Centre on
the north side.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">SOCIETY
SUBURBS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121122.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>To meet the objection of wind exposure on the bare western
side of the City the residential area is contracted into the
valley lying inside that bounding range of hills, dominated by
"Shale", which are to be given over to an afforestation park.</p>
<p>Two points of congregation accentuate the two natural
topographic outlets west of the Capitol.</p>
<p>These residential centres might well be characterized by
society, clubs, and church assemblages for that large social
group of special character peculiar to a national capital. The
conformation of the land tributary to them is irregular and most
advantageously divided into the larger estates, while the
Yarralumla Valley to the west, unintersected by railway and least
in demand for industry, and the informal lake at the north,
afford open areas for a maximum of outdoor life. The proximity of
the University may also be counted to afford an attraction, as
exemplified in university towns and intellectual centres
throughout the world.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 36%;">AGRICULTURAL
SUBURBS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121123.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Outlying village centres to the southward, or possibly to the
northward, in either case in the lee of the only protective
mountains of the site may be devoted, at least in some
transitional stages of the City's growth, to horticultural and
intensive agricultural uses, truck gardens, nurseries, poultry
raising, &amp;c., occupying alluvial plains adaptable to sewage
irrigation from the higher inhabited regions, and being directly
tributary by rail transportation, and by road, to the Markets. At
their centres facilities for creameries, abattoirs, and allied
operations are to be found.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 35%;">MANUFACTURING
SUBURB.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.121124.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The centre lying to the northward of the City was originally
designated "Manufactures", but conditions in the early growth,
with the railroad facilities limited to the south of the
Molonglo, may necessitate that such activities be concentrated in
one of the southern suburbs. Furthermore, it is possible that the
summer northerly winds may render the northern point less
acceptable than a southern one for this purpose.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 38%;">LOCAL
INDUSTRY.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1212.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>In addition to general business in the immediate neighbourhood
of the specialized Urban and Suburban Industrial Foci there can
be anticipated a development of business for more local
distribution to, and accommodation of, the intermediate areas
generally utilized by residents. Such business, necessarily
attracted by easiest accessibility will tend to align itself on
the most direct of the avenues connecting the focal centres.</p>
<p>These industrial alignments may be assumed to include in some
instances, not only the wide main thoroughfare frontages, but
also, as an elastic limit, the frontages of the first and longest
parallel avenue on either side.</p>
<p>The unit blocks on the long connecting avenues are narrowed by
the amount of increase in front traffic accommodation, these
avenues being at least twice as wide as others, and also by the
introduction of a rear alley shipping way 30 feet wide.</p>
<p>It is contended that modern and prospective means of street
transportation in the tramway and fast vehicular traffic, and of
which the great progress up to the present is hardly a beginning
towards speed, safety, noiselessness and reliability in sight for
the near future, mean a very different and far more general
lineal distribution of ordinary retail trade than where a walking
range has been the determining influence.</p>
<p>During the transformation period congestion has resulted in
cities, and the lift or elevator pressed into service for relief.
An equally well administered tram service, perhaps supported
financially in the same way out of rents, would assure a more
convenient, as well as far better horizontal, alignment.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 32%;">RESIDENTIAL
SECTIONS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.122.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>With the Federal needs provided for in their special
districts, and with the general industries amply accommodated at
focal points, and along the direct lines connecting them, the
remaining portion of the city site is available for domestic
life, which demands privacy, quiet, and stability, with freedom
from either interference or encroachment of business life.
Because of the triangular or rhombic arrangement of their
traffic-line business boundaries, these internal areas, while
secluded, may yet be but a few steps from the industries and
communication lines serving them. Equitably distributed
throughout the city these quiet sections allow domiciles to be
everywhere handy to industrial employment.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 32%;">DOMESTIC
COMMUNITIES.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1221.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>Comprising the proportionately large share of the city area
required for habitation, the segregated sections, formed and
separated by the general traffic lines, furnish not only suitable
individual home sites, but comprise social units for that larger
family&mdash;the neighbourhood group, with one handy district
school or more for the children, and with local playground, game
fields, church, club, and social amenities accessible without
crossing traffic tracks, or encountering the disturbing elements
or temptations of business streets, since these family activities
may best be directed internally toward the geographical centres
of their groups for their special congregation. In other, words,
the adult and independent industrial social activities may be
considered typically directed centrifugally, whilst the domestic
social efforts are assembled centripetally for effective control
and co-operation.</p>
<p>The innermost unit block may be varied to form considerable
areas for such special purposes, including also sanatoria,
residence hotels, parks, ornamental or industrial horticultural
gardens, even to the extent of agricultural fields, farms, or
wilds in earlier stages of settlement, all with the minimum of
interference with the traffic of the city as exemplified in the
lakes and parks of large groups, occupying the whole of similar
areas which are devoted to special Capital uses.</p>
<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-right: 42%;">HOMES.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.1222.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The desirability of rectangular blocks and parallel-set
buildings, in the interests of economy of construction and
restfulness and simplicity in architectural treatment, is
scarcely less in the case of residences than for public or
industrial groups, so where topography permits, a system of
rectangular blocks is perferable, especially where, as in this
plan, it is by no means an expression of the "gridiron", because
of its universal closed vistas and innumerable street terminal
sites. The reduction in the repetition of unit blocks in one line
marks here their independence and seclusion, also permitting a
graduated increase in the proportion of land used individually to
that demanded by communication.</p>
<p>The internal blocks, typically large, in many cases forming
considerable undivided areas, leave opportunity for private
development or small-community initiative to evolve pretty
schemes of driveway subdivision, recessed courts, closes,
quadrangles, terraces, common gardens, irregular hill garden
subdivisions, and a host of similar possibilities, adding
incident and variety to a consistent whole.</p>
<p>For the sites among the hills, while an informal regularity or
block arrangement might, in some cases, be possible, it is not
deemed so necessary, since where allotments are large and houses
are on different levels, more picturesque juxtaposition is
permissible. It is regarded as generally desirable, however, that
the occupied sites be higher than their communication lines for
enhancing their appearance, their utility, privacy, and
individuality.</p>

<br>
<p>The general communication system, finally, often irrespective
of merely aesthetic conditions, accomplishes the industrial
success or failure of a city. But this does not imply the
attaining of a maximum of communicating lines so much as their
thorough correlation and suitable allocation. The scheme must be
simple and flexible, available with varying conditions of
expansion and the changes of condition with time; it must be
detrimental to the shape or orderly relationships of buildings,
or to the natural beauty of the landscape in no case that is
avoidable.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 40%;">RAILWAYS.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.211.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>The line of railroad approaching from either way, all
junctions being external, is directed toward the Capitol as it
comes into view, and then diverted in passing the Public
Buildings Group, to avoid bisection of the internal traffic. The
railway is, however, in immediate contact throughout with all the
industrial and general habitation areas, with frequent local
stations for freight or passenger accommodation. It is to be
noted that the regions not in direct touch are those of the
specialized characters preferably least intruded by the
disagreeable features of dirt, noise, and sight, incidental to
railway operation, and in general are those prepared to utilize
the private motor car for rapid communication.</p>
<p>Gradient is the easiest possible, being virtually a level
throughout, with an appropriate  per cent. rise to the main
station, facilitating starting and stopping. Trackway in general
is straight, with but four slight turns of three degree
curvature, suitable to long train traction. Thoroughfare through
flat districts is maintained by open depression about 12 feet
deep, the excavated materials forming embankments of 6 feet in
height, an elevation requiring but slight incline for crossing
streets, and used by the parallel roads where adjacent.</p>
<p>Through industrial regions the railway is conducted between
occupied blocks, for switching, warehousing, &amp;c., utilizing a
flattish valley on the outskirts for freight marshalling and car
storage yards for which a considerable area is to be set aside
where interfering least with through street lines.</p>
<p>The line, approaching the Urban Administrative Centre from the
north, turns at a local station there, and is directed toward a
cathedral-crowned hill, into the lowest slope of which it passes
as it turns and enters the Mercantile Centre through a subway
beneath the open square in front of the Main Station.</p>
<p>Spurs here afford stub-terminal train tracks for each
direction at the sides of the station not served by the through
tracks.</p>
<p>The Main Station, of hexagonal shape, commands the place, but
lies at one side of the city traffic currents, and is beautifully
ensconced, owing to the hilly conformation at the rear. It is
disposed to be conspicuous from distant points, and to offer a
dignified commanding prospect of the City for the arrival's first
impression. To minimize the difficulty of early completing so
ambitious a station centre the street arrangement is designed to
permit diversion of the approaching avenues at greater distances
from the focal point than intended ultimately.</p>
<p>Due south from the station, the railway emerges from the
subway, and follows a direct line from Ainslie and the Cathedral,
crossing the waterway at junction of basin and lake, continuing
between wide avenues to the southern Suburban Stations, finally
turning out of the city with the Capitol and Black Mountain in
its wake.</p>
<p>In general, this external communication line is treated with
the dignity accorded to internal lines, has its well-marked
objective at every turn, and is afforded the finest view points
where crossing each of the axes of the dominant architectural
<em>ensemble</em>.</p>
<p>Because this through traffic line may be some years in
eventuating, and in order to effect a saving, at the outset, of
the long weir bridge, it is considered that possibly the local
branch from Queanbeyan, serving as a constructional line during
the creative period, may be so plotted as to serve ultimately as
a rapid transit adjunct to the main railroad route, linking in
the Government centre with the northern and southern suburbs.
This, however, can only be suitably accomplished by a line that
can be concealed in the steeper slope of the hills approaching
the Capital, crossing the river in a specially designed bridge
with the track level beneath the roadway, with still enough room
below the latter to clear the boulevarded river embankment. This
branch, necessarily largely in tunnels, and with its limited
ultimate functions permitting of relatively sharp curvature,
affords access to Parliament House and the Industrial Centre of
the initial City so close as to obviate any need for street
vehicles to eke out the journey. Perhaps such additional rapid
transit facility with a clear way, independent of the street
traffic, might ultimately play part in the healthful
dissemination of the Capital settlement.</p>
<p>Though not indicated, a feasible route can be laid down for
the extension of lower level railway facilities to the west and
south should seemingly improbable conditions ever demand such.
The isolated Yarralumla Valley will scarcely justify a long
distance rail connexion.</p>

<p>With regard to the internal system in general, it is
unnecessary to elaborate here the provision for storm water
disposal and drainage equipment, further than to note that the
grades and the general utilization of the depressions for
thoroughfare simplify the reticulation problem, The transverse
interception of storm water at various levels is also
facilitated.</p>
<p>The Molonglo banks and bed afford an apparently economical
route for final outfall lines.</p>
<p>A complete local pipe and wire service at the street building
line, obviating stubs or pavement interference, is attainable
with the roadway system of control advocated.</p>
<p>For tramway equipment elasticity is a first requisite,
guaranteed by the integral system of arterial thoroughfares
wherein there is allowance for ultimately depressing in open
channels an economical sub-surface scheme of rapid transit.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Considering our problem from the stand-point of "Occupancy",
there has been noted modern tendency to supplement largely, if
not to supplant, the spot concentration of older towns with long
alignments of traffic and trade.</p>
<p>The maximum facility for uninterrupted rapid transportation
and an adequate equipment with services in the arterial system
accentuates the tendency, while a strictly subordinate
arrangement of feeder streets deters traffic diversion, cutting
off competitive inducement to traffic and trade as well, for
trade must be where the people are. The direction of the main
routes is involved in selecting their terminals, those points of
natural or functional eminence, which must be inter-connected as
directly as is compatible with the possibility of following easy
and uniform gradients, never greater than 2 per cent., without
excavation unduly expensive in proportion to the advantage
Sought. The desirability of straightness can hardly be
over-estimated, but with it no convex profile is permissible.
Whereas, however, these long lines are but few in the aggregate,
because of the concentration of the circulative function, the
value of their proper uniform grade and alignment for safety of
operation, directness, and view of their important and attractive
objectives, in the organic city, constitute an operative economy
at least comparable with the demands of ordinary railroad lines,
having infinitely less traffic burden, and infinitely greater
distances and difficulties.</p>
<p>The basic circulation system comprises the triangle connecting
simultaneously the three business centres of Government activity
(Government, University, Military) and the two urban centres of
local business (Administration and Merchandising). On this
framework the City can develop all its functions from the
beginning of its maturity with ample latitude for variation in
each phase of activity, maintaining the final scale of a Capital
City from the outset. Increments of gradual growth may be
definitely, little by little, incorporated without confusion,
congestion, or scattering along later extensions of the arterial
systems, followed by corresponding distribution tributaries as
required.</p>
<p>Never less than triple roadways can be considered sufficient
to handle avenue traffic ultimately, with tramways, fast and slow
vehicles in both directions; but, in the early projection of
these avenues, it will be well to substitute park treatment or
even to permit temporary private garden occupancy of the portions
not immediately needed for traffic.</p>
<p>The street area, if reduced to three roadways, is a desert,
dangerous and unpleasant to traverse, so in a sunny country of
stately open-branched broad-leaf evergreen avenue trees,
additional space is required for a final arboreal accompaniment
of at least quadruple rows and supplemental shrubbery parkways
for shade and shelter, wind and dust arresting. From
considerations also of architectural setting, ventilation, fire
stop, command of crossings, and eventual rapid transit, a uniform
width of 200 feet is adopted.</p>

SYSTEM.</div>
<div style="float: left;">2.222.</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<br>
<p>A system of distribution at right angles to the circulation
thoroughfares gives minimum of distance from either side of such
thoroughfare. For access to public transfer fines, trams,
&amp;c., this is the prime object. With a frequency of the
circulation ways the distances are short; indeed, a point five
blocks back in the triangular interspaces of this plan is a
rarity.</p>
<p>The rectangular form of block most generally adapted to
improvements, and straight roadways most simply kept and
patrolled, can, in these purely distribution routes be readily
maintained with very slight modification for a considerable
undulation in site since these streets essentially short in any
one direction permit obstructions to remain or to be compassed by
diverting ramps without loss of utility, while general and
frequent variations in rate of slope can be accomplished at
angles without rendering the irregularity apparent or
disagreeable.</p>
<p>The very liberty and topographic adaptability permissible to
these minor distributing streets demands a contrasting dignity
and severity in the connecting avenues that form the backbone of
the system, and for that dignity the economy of' the former
easily contributes the requisite funds.</p>
<p>The streets parallel to business avenues decreasing in length,
in accessibility, and in importance in direct ratio with their
distances from their main axial artery, approach by degrees an
ultimate of enclosed courts best adapted for privacy and quiet,
tending naturally to maintain themselves for residential and
similar purposes against any possible intrusion of business,
especially since they are only reached from the main travel
routes by ring cross streets that neither connect important
points nor ever run directly in any one way for sufficient
distance to attract active traffic. There are, however, no "dead
ends" nor "cul de sac" streets expensive to serve.</p>
<p>The gradual reduction of the proportion of thoroughfare area
to private grounds in residence sections adds materially to the
site space available for use as well as to economy in service
equipment pipes and wire lines, pavements, and their
maintenance.</p>
<p>One suburban town observed, where alternate cross roads as
laid out were omitted, leaving blocks 1,200 feet long, may be
cited as having been able to perfect its street improvements,
many years ahead of other places of similar conditions otherwise,
but with the greater multiplicity of streets.</p>
<p>In the hilly sections the distribution lines take the form of
sweeping ramps, confined, as far as possible, to the depressions
for reasons heretofore explained, as well as for economy in the
grading pipe service, drainage, shelter, and in the utilization
of land that is of minimum value for other purposes. This way is
also the simplest and least conspicuous in mutilation of natural
rugged types of scenery. Effort has been directed towards
securing arcs of the minimum curvature needed to compensate an
appearance of varying and convex grades for economy as compared
with straight lines in such locations, and for directness,
safety, and ease of control as compared with short curves.</p>
<p>A uniform width of 100 feet for distribution ways is
established as a suitable minimum interval between building
fronts for light, air, privacy, and fore-garden embellishment. It
is by no means a determinant of the desirable thoroughfare space
in roadway, walk, or public parking, which should be graduated to
a minimum requirement of possibly a 12-foot driveway alone in the
farthest backset, short streets, or ravine climbs. There is no
reason why the balance of the potential right of way should not
be granted for fullest use to the private occupants and
considered in all but reserved jurisdiction as belonging to
individual abutting allotments, withholding an easement for
direct service lines adjacent to the buildings, and retaining the
exercise of considerable public control as to appearances. This
is not an uncommon arrangement and one here allowing variable
increase in the proportion of private sites to actual public ways
directly corresponding to lesser unit values of the areas for
fixed occupancy and their lesser demand for access.</p>
