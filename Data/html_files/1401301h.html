  <h2><a id="part3"
     name="part3">PART THE THIRD</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15"></a>XV. &mdash; STOICISM AT COURT</h2>

  <p class="first">[3] THE very finest flower of the same
  company&mdash;Aurelius with the gilded fasces borne before him, a crowd of
  exquisites, the empress Faustina herself, and all the elegant blue-stockings
  of the day, who maintained, people said, their private &ldquo;sophists&rdquo;
  to whisper philosophy into their ears winsomely as they performed the duties
  of the toilet&mdash;was assembled again a few months later, in a different
  place and for a very different purpose. The temple of Peace, a
  &ldquo;modernising&rdquo; foundation of Hadrian, enlarged by a library and
  lecture-rooms, had grown into an institution like something between a college
  and a literary club; and here Cornelius Fronto was to pronounce a discourse
  on the Nature of Morals. There were some, indeed, who had desired the emperor
  Aurelius himself to declare his whole mind on this matter. Rhetoric was
  become almost a function of the state: philosophy was upon the throne; and
  had from time to time, by [4] request, delivered an official utterance with
  well-nigh divine authority. And it was as the delegate of this authority,
  under the full sanction of the philosophic emperor&mdash;emperor and pontiff,
  that the aged Fronto purposed to-day to expound some parts of the Stoic
  doctrine, with the view of recommending morals to that refined but perhaps
  prejudiced company, as being, in effect, one mode of comeliness in
  things&mdash;as it were music, or a kind of artistic order, in life. And he
  did this earnestly, with an outlay of all his science of mind, and that
  eloquence of which he was known to be a master. For Stoicism was no longer a
  rude and unkempt thing. Received at court, it had largely decorated itself:
  it was grown persuasive and insinuating, and sought not only to convince
  men&rsquo;s intelligence but to allure their souls. Associated with the
  beautiful old age of the great rhetorician, and his winning voice, it was
  almost Epicurean. And the old man was at his best on the occasion; the last
  on which he ever appeared in this way. To-day was his own birthday. Early in
  the morning the imperial letter of congratulation had reached him; and all
  the pleasant animation it had caused was in his face, when assisted by his
  daughter Gratia he took his place on the ivory chair, as president of the
  Athenaeum of Rome, wearing with a wonderful grace the philosophic
  pall,&mdash;in reality neither more nor less than the loose woollen cloak of
  the common soldier, but fastened [5] on his right shoulder with a magnificent
  clasp, the emperor&rsquo;s birthday gift.</p>

  <p>It was an age, as abundant evidence shows, whose delight in rhetoric was
  but one result of a general susceptibility&mdash;an age not merely taking
  pleasure in words, but experiencing a great moral power in them.
  Fronto&rsquo;s quaintly fashionable audience would have wept, and also
  assisted with their purses, had his present purpose been, as sometimes
  happened, the recommendation of an object of charity. As it was, arranging
  themselves at their ease among the images and flowers, these amateurs of
  exquisite language, with their tablets open for careful record of felicitous
  word or phrase, were ready to give themselves wholly to the intellectual
  treat prepared for them, applauding, blowing loud kisses through the air
  sometimes, at the speaker&rsquo;s triumphant exit from one of his long,
  skilfully modulated sentences; while the younger of them meant to imitate
  everything about him, down to the inflections of his voice and the very folds
  of his mantle. Certainly there was rhetoric enough:&mdash;a wealth of
  imagery; illustrations from painting, music, mythology, the experiences of
  love; a management, by which subtle, unexpected meaning was brought out of
  familiar terms, like flies from morsels of amber, to use Fronto&rsquo;s own
  figure. But with all its richness, the higher claim of his style was rightly
  understood to lie in gravity and self-command, and an especial care for the
  [6] purities of a vocabulary which rejected every expression unsanctioned by
  the authority of approved ancient models.</p>

  <p>And it happened with Marius, as it will sometimes happen, that this
  general discourse to a general audience had the effect of an utterance
  adroitly designed for him. His conscience still vibrating painfully under the
  shock of that scene in the amphitheatre, and full of the ethical charm of
  Cornelius, he was questioning himself with much impatience as to the
  possibility of an adjustment between his own elaborately thought-out
  intellectual scheme and the &ldquo;old morality.&rdquo; In that intellectual
  scheme indeed the old morality had so far been allowed no place, as seeming
  to demand from him the admission of certain first principles such as might
  misdirect or retard him in his efforts towards a complete, many-sided
  existence; or distort the revelations of the experience of life; or curtail
  his natural liberty of heart and mind. But now (his imagination being
  occupied for the moment with the noble and resolute air, the gallantry, so to
  call it, which composed the outward mien and presentment of his strange
  friend&rsquo;s inflexible ethics) he felt already some nascent suspicion of
  his philosophic programme, in regard, precisely, to the question of good
  taste. There was the taint of a graceless &ldquo;antinomianism&rdquo;
  perceptible in it, a dissidence, a revolt against accustomed modes, the
  actual impression of which on other [7] men might rebound upon himself in
  some loss of that personal pride to which it was part of his theory of life
  to allow so much. And it was exactly a moral situation such as this that
  Fronto appeared to be contemplating. He seemed to have before his mind the
  case of one&mdash;Cyrenaic or Epicurean, as the courtier tends to be, by
  habit and instinct, if not on principle&mdash;who yet experiences, actually,
  a strong tendency to moral assents, and a desire, with as little logical
  inconsistency as may be, to find a place for duty and righteousness in his
  house of thought.</p>

  <p>And the Stoic professor found the key to this problem in the purely
  aesthetic beauty of the old morality, as an element in things, fascinating to
  the imagination, to good taste in its most highly developed form, through
  association&mdash;a system or order, as a matter of fact, in possession, not
  only of the larger world, but of the rare minority of elite intelligences;
  from which, therefore, least of all would the sort of Epicurean he had in
  view endure to become, so to speak, an outlaw. He supposed his hearer to be,
  with all sincerity, in search after some principle of conduct (and it was
  here that he seemed to Marius to be speaking straight to him) which might
  give unity of motive to an actual rectitude, a cleanness and probity of life,
  determined partly by natural affection, partly by enlightened self-interest
  or the feeling of honour, due in part even to the mere fear of penalties; no
  element of which, [8] however, was distinctively moral in the agent himself
  as such, and providing him, therefore, no common ground with a really moral
  being like Cornelius, or even like the philosophic emperor. Performing the
  same offices; actually satisfying, even as they, the external claims of
  others; rendering to all their dues&mdash;one thus circumstanced would be
  wanting, nevertheless, in the secret of inward adjustment to the moral agents
  around him. How tenderly&mdash;more tenderly than many stricter
  souls&mdash;he might yield himself to kindly instinct! what fineness of
  charity in passing judgment on others! what an exquisite conscience of other
  men&rsquo;s susceptibilities! He knows for how much the manner, because the
  heart itself, counts, in doing a kindness. He goes beyond most people in his
  care for all weakly creatures; judging, instinctively, that to be but
  sentient is to possess rights. He conceives a hundred duties, though he may
  not call them by that name, of the existence of which purely duteous souls
  may have no suspicion. He has a kind of pride in doing more than they, in a
  way of his own. Sometimes, he may think that those men of line and rule do
  not really understand their own business. How narrow, inflexible,
  unintelligent! what poor guardians (he may reason) of the inward spirit of
  righteousness, are some supposed careful walkers according to its letter and
  form. And yet all the while he admits, as such, no moral world at all: no [9]
  theoretic equivalent to so large a proportion of the facts of life.</p>

  <p>But, over and above such practical rectitude, thus determined by natural
  affection or self-love or fear, he may notice that there is a remnant of
  right conduct, what he does, still more what he abstains from doing, not so
  much through his own free election, as from a deference, an
  &ldquo;assent,&rdquo; entire, habitual, unconscious, to custom&mdash;to the
  actual habit or fashion of others, from whom he could not endure to break
  away, any more than he would care to be out of agreement with them on
  questions of mere manner, or, say, even, of dress. Yes! there were the evils,
  the vices, which he avoided as, essentially, a failure in good taste. An
  assent, such as this, to the preferences of others, might seem to be the
  weakest of motives, and the rectitude it could determine the least
  considerable element in a moral life. Yet here, according to Cornelius
  Fronto, was in truth the revealing example, albeit operating upon comparative
  trifles, of the general principle required. There was one great idea
  associated with which that determination to conform to precedent was elevated
  into the clearest, the fullest, the weightiest principle of moral action; a
  principle under which one might subsume men&rsquo;s most strenuous efforts
  after righteousness. And he proceeded to expound the idea of
  Humanity&mdash;of a universal commonwealth of mind, which [10] becomes
  explicit, and as if incarnate, in a select communion of just men made
  perfect.</p>

  <p><i>Ho kosmos hosanei polis estin</i>&mdash;the world is as it were a
  commonwealth, a city: and there are observances, customs, usages, actually
  current in it, things our friends and companions will expect of us, as the
  condition of our living there with them at all, as really their peers or
  fellow- citizens. Those observances were, indeed, the creation of a visible
  or invisible aristocracy in it, whose actual manners, whose preferences from
  of old, become now a weighty tradition as to the way in which things should
  or should not be done, are like a music, to which the intercourse of life
  proceeds&mdash;such a music as no one who had once caught its harmonies would
  willingly jar. In this way, the becoming, as in Greek&mdash;<i>to prepon</i>
  or <i>ta ethe</i>&mdash;mores, manners, as both Greeks and Romans said, would
  indeed be a comprehensive term for duty. Righteousness would be, in the words
  of &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; himself, of the philosophic Aurelius, but a
  &ldquo;following of the reasonable will of the oldest, the most venerable, of
  cities, of polities&mdash;of the royal, the law-giving element,
  therein&mdash;forasmuch as we are citizens also in that supreme city on high,
  of which all other cities beside are but as single habitations.&rdquo; But as
  the old man spoke with animation of this supreme city, this invisible
  society, whose conscience was become explicit in its inner circle of inspired
  souls, of whose [11] common spirit, the trusted leaders of human conscience
  had been but the mouthpiece, of whose successive personal preferences in the
  conduct of life, the &ldquo;old morality&rdquo; was the sum,&mdash;Marius
  felt that his own thoughts were passing beyond the actual intention of the
  speaker; not in the direction of any clearer theoretic or abstract definition
  of that ideal commonwealth, but rather as if in search of its visible
  locality and abiding- place, the walls and towers of which, so to speak, he
  might really trace and tell, according to his own old, natural habit of mind.
  It would be the fabric, the outward fabric, of a system reaching, certainly,
  far beyond the great city around him, even if conceived in all the machinery
  of its visible and invisible influences at their grandest&mdash;as Augustus
  or Trajan might have conceived of them&mdash;however well the visible Rome
  might pass for a figure of that new, unseen, Rome on high. At moments, Marius
  even asked himself with surprise, whether it might be some vast secret
  society the speaker had in view:&mdash;that august community, to be an outlaw
  from which, to be foreign to the manners of which, was a loss so much greater
  than to be excluded, into the ends of the earth, from the sovereign Roman
  commonwealth. Humanity, a universal order, the great polity, its aristocracy
  of elect spirits, the mastery of their example over their
  successors&mdash;these were the ideas, stimulating enough in their way, [12]
  by association with which the Stoic professor had attempted to elevate, to
  unite under a single principle, men&rsquo;s moral efforts, himself lifted up
  with so genuine an enthusiasm. But where might Marius search for all this, as
  more than an intellectual abstraction? Where were those elect souls in whom
  the claim of Humanity became so amiable, winning, persuasive&mdash;whose
  footsteps through the world were so beautiful in the actual order he
  saw&mdash;whose faces averted from him, would be more than he could bear?
  Where was that comely order, to which as a great fact of experience he must
  give its due; to which, as to all other beautiful &ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; in
  life, he must, for his own peace, adjust himself?</p>

  <p>Rome did well to be serious. The discourse ended somewhat abruptly, as the
  noise of a great crowd in motion was heard below the walls; whereupon, the
  audience, following the humour of the younger element in it, poured into the
  colonnade, from the steps of which the famous procession, or transvectio, of
  the military knights was to be seen passing over the Forum, from their
  trysting- place at the temple of Mars, to the temple of the Dioscuri. The
  ceremony took place this year, not on the day accustomed&mdash;anniversary of
  the victory of Lake Regillus, with its pair of celestial assistants&mdash;and
  amid the heat and roses of a Roman July, but, by [13] anticipation, some
  months earlier, the almond-trees along the way being still in leafless
  flower. Through that light trellis-work, Marius watched the riders, arrayed
  in all their gleaming ornaments, and wearing wreaths of olive around their
  helmets, the faces below which, what with battle and the plague, were almost
  all youthful. It was a flowery scene enough, but had to-day its fulness of
  war-like meaning; the return of the army to the North, where the enemy was
  again upon the move, being now imminent. Cornelius had ridden along in his
  place, and, on the dismissal of the company, passed below the steps where
  Marius stood, with that new song he had heard once before floating from his
  lips.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>XVI. &mdash; SECOND THOUGHTS</h2>

  <p class="first">[14] AND Marius, for his part, was grave enough. The
  discourse of Cornelius Fronto, with its wide prospect over the human, the
  spiritual, horizon, had set him on a review&mdash;on a review of the
  isolating narrowness, in particular, of his own theoretic scheme. Long after
  the very latest roses were faded, when &ldquo;the town&rdquo; had departed to
  country villas, or the baths, or the war, he remained behind in Rome; anxious
  to try the lastingness of his own Epicurean rose-garden; setting to work over
  again, and deliberately passing from point to point of his old argument with
  himself, down to its practical conclusions. That age and our own have much in
  common&mdash;many difficulties and hopes. Let the reader pardon me if here
  and there I seem to be passing from Marius to his modern representatives
  &mdash;from Rome, to Paris or London.</p>

  <p>What really were its claims as a theory of practice, of the sympathies
  that determine [15] practice? It had been a theory, avowedly, of loss and
  gain (so to call it) of an economy. If, therefore, it missed something in the
  commerce of life, which some other theory of practice was able to include, if
  it made a needless sacrifice, then it must be, in a manner, inconsistent with
  itself, and lack theoretic completeness. Did it make such a sacrifice? What
  did it lose, or cause one to lose?</p>

  <p>And we may note, as Marius could hardly have done, that Cyrenaicism is
  ever the characteristic philosophy of youth, ardent, but narrow in its
  survey&mdash;sincere, but apt to become one-sided, or even fanatical. It is
  one of those subjective and partial ideals, based on vivid, because limited,
  apprehension of the truth of one aspect of experience (in this case, of the
  beauty of the world and the brevity of man&rsquo;s life there) which it may
  be said to be the special vocation of the young to express. In the school of
  Cyrene, in that comparatively fresh Greek world, we see this philosophy where
  it is least blase, as we say; in its most pleasant, its blithest and yet
  perhaps its wisest form, youthfully bright in the youth of European thought.
  But it grows young again for a while in almost every youthful soul. It is
  spoken of sometimes as the appropriate utterance of jaded men; but in them it
  can hardly be sincere, or, by the nature of the case, an enthusiasm.
  &ldquo;Walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine
  eyes,&rdquo; is, indeed, most often, [16] according to the supposition of the
  book from which I quote it, the counsel of the young, who feel that the
  sunshine is pleasant along their veins, and wintry weather, though in a
  general sense foreseen, a long way off. The youthful enthusiasm or
  fanaticism, the self- abandonment to one favourite mode of thought or taste,
  which occurs, quite naturally, at the outset of every really vigorous
  intellectual career, finds its special opportunity in a theory such as that
  so carefully put together by Marius, just because it seems to call on one to
  make the sacrifice, accompanied by a vivid sensation of power and will, of
  what others value&mdash;sacrifice of some conviction, or doctrine, or
  supposed first principle&mdash;for the sake of that clear-eyed intellectual
  consistency, which is like spotless bodily cleanliness, or scrupulous
  personal honour, and has itself for the mind of the youthful student, when he
  first comes to appreciate it, the fascination of an ideal.</p>

  <p>The Cyrenaic doctrine, then, realised as a motive of strenuousness or
  enthusiasm, is not so properly the utterance of the &ldquo;jaded
  Epicurean,&rdquo; as of the strong young man in all the freshness of thought
  and feeling, fascinated by the notion of raising his life to the level of a
  daring theory, while, in the first genial heat of existence, the beauty of
  the physical world strikes potently upon his wide-open, unwearied senses. He
  discovers a great new poem every spring, with a hundred delightful things he
  too has felt, but [16] which have never been expressed, or at least never so
  truly, before. The workshops of the artists, who can select and set before us
  what is really most distinguished in visible life, are open to him. He thinks
  that the old Platonic, or the new Baconian philosophy, has been better
  explained than by the authors themselves, or with some striking original
  development, this very month. In the quiet heat of early summer, on the dusty
  gold morning, the music comes, louder at intervals, above the hum of voices
  from some neighbouring church, among the flowering trees, valued now,
  perhaps, only for the poetically rapt faces among priests or worshippers, or
  the mere skill and eloquence, it may be, of its preachers of faith and
  righteousness. In his scrupulous idealism, indeed, he too feels himself to be
  something of a priest, and that devotion of his days to the contemplation of
  what is beautiful, a sort of perpetual religious service. Afar off, how many
  fair cities and delicate sea-coasts await him! At that age, with minds of a
  certain constitution, no very choice or exceptional circumstances are needed
  to provoke an enthusiasm something like this. Life in modern London even, in
  the heavy glow of summer, is stuff sufficient for the fresh imagination of a
  youth to build its &ldquo;palace of art&rdquo; of; and the very sense and
  enjoyment of an experience in which all is new, are but enhanced, like that
  glow of summer itself, by the [18] thought of its brevity, giving him
  something of a gambler&rsquo;s zest, in the apprehension, by dexterous act or
  diligently appreciative thought, of the highly coloured moments which are to
  pass away so quickly. At bottom, perhaps, in his elaborately developed
  self-consciousness, his sensibilities, his almost fierce grasp upon the
  things he values at all, he has, beyond all others, an inward need of
  something permanent in its character, to hold by: of which circumstance,
  also, he may be partly aware, and that, as with the brilliant Claudio in
  Measure for Measure, it is, in truth, but darkness he is,
  &ldquo;encountering, like a bride.&rdquo; But the inevitable falling of the
  curtain is probably distant; and in the daylight, at least, it is not often
  that he really shudders at the thought of the grave&mdash;the weight above,
  the narrow world and its company, within. When the thought of it does occur
  to him, he may say to himself:&mdash;Well! and the rude monk, for instance,
  who has renounced all this, on the security of some dim world beyond it,
  really acquiesces in that &ldquo;fifth act,&rdquo; amid all the consoling
  ministries around him, as little as I should at this moment; though I may
  hope, that, as at the real ending of a play, however well acted, I may
  already have had quite enough of it, and find a true well-being in eternal
  sleep.</p>

  <p>And precisely in this circumstance, that, consistently with the function
  of youth in general, Cyrenaicism will always be more or [19] less the special
  philosophy, or &ldquo;prophecy,&rdquo; of the young, when the ideal of a rich
  experience comes to them in the ripeness of the receptive, if not of the
  reflective, powers&mdash;precisely in this circumstance, if we rightly
  consider it, lies the duly prescribed corrective of that philosophy. For it
  is by its exclusiveness, and by negation rather than positively, that such
  theories fail to satisfy us permanently; and what they really need for their
  correction, is the complementary influence of some greater system, in which
  they may find their due place. That Sturm und Drang of the spirit, as it has
  been called, that ardent and special apprehension of half-truths, in the
  enthusiastic, and as it were &ldquo;prophetic&rdquo; advocacy of which,
  devotion to truth, in the case of the young&mdash;apprehending but one point
  at a time in the great circumference&mdash;most usually embodies itself, is
  levelled down, safely enough, afterwards, as in history so in the individual,
  by the weakness and mere weariness, as well as by the maturer wisdom, of our
  nature. And though truth indeed, resides, as has been said, &ldquo;in the
  whole&rdquo;&mdash;in harmonisings and adjustments like this&mdash;yet those
  special apprehensions may still owe their full value, in this sense of
  &ldquo;the whole,&rdquo; to that earlier, one-sided but ardent pre-occupation
  with them.</p>

  <p>Cynicism and Cyrenaicism:&mdash;they are the earlier Greek forms of Roman
  Stoicism and Epicureanism, and in that world of old Greek [20] thought, we
  may notice with some surprise that, in a little while, the nobler form of
  Cyrenaicism&mdash;Cyrenaicism cured of its faults&mdash;met the nobler form
  of Cynicism half-way. Starting from opposed points, they merged, each in its
  most refined form, in a single ideal of temperance or moderation. Something
  of the same kind may be noticed regarding some later phases of Cyrenaic
  theory. If it starts with considerations opposed to the religious temper,
  which the religious temper holds it a duty to repress, it is like it,
  nevertheless, and very unlike any lower development of temper, in its stress
  and earnestness, its serious application to the pursuit of a very unworldly
  type of perfection. The saint, and the Cyrenaic lover of beauty, it may be
  thought, would at least understand each other better than either would
  understand the mere man of the world. Carry their respective positions a
  point further, shift the terms a little, and they might actually touch.</p>

  <p>Perhaps all theories of practice tend, as they rise to their best, as
  understood by their worthiest representatives, to identification with each
  other. For the variety of men&rsquo;s possible reflections on their
  experience, as of that experience itself, is not really so great as it seems;
  and as the highest and most disinterested ethical formulae, filtering down
  into men&rsquo;s everyday existence, reach the same poor level of vulgar
  egotism, so, we may fairly suppose that all the highest spirits, from [21]
  whatever contrasted points they have started, would yet be found to
  entertain, in the moral consciousness realised by themselves, much the same
  kind of mental company; to hold, far more than might be thought probable, at
  first sight, the same personal types of character, and even the same artistic
  and literary types, in esteem or aversion; to convey, all of them alike, the
  same savour of unworldliness. And Cyrenaicism or Epicureanism too, new or
  old, may be noticed, in proportion to the completeness of its development, to
  approach, as to the nobler form of Cynicism, so also to the more nobly
  developed phases of the old, or traditional morality. In the gravity of its
  conception of life, in its pursuit after nothing less than a perfection, in
  its apprehension of the value of time&mdash;the passion and the seriousness
  which are like a consecration&mdash;la passion et le serieux qui
  consacrent&mdash;it may be conceived, as regards its main drift, to be not so
  much opposed to the old morality, as an exaggeration of one special motive in
  it.</p>

  <p>Some cramping, narrowing, costly preference of one part of his own nature,
  and of the nature of things, to another, Marius seemed to have detected in
  himself, meantime,&mdash;in himself, as also in those old masters of the
  Cyrenaic philosophy. If they did realise the <i>monochronos hedone</i> as it
  was called&mdash;the pleasure of the &ldquo;Ideal Now&rdquo;&mdash;if certain
  moments of their lives were high-pitched, passionately coloured, intent with
  sensation, [22] and a kind of knowledge which, in its vivid clearness, was
  like sensation&mdash;if, now and then, they apprehended the world in its
  fulness, and had a vision, almost &ldquo;beatific,&rdquo; of ideal
  personalities in life and art, yet these moments were a very costly matter:
  they paid a great price for them, in the sacrifice of a thousand possible
  sympathies, of things only to be enjoyed through sympathy, from which they
  detached themselves, in intellectual pride, in loyalty to a mere theory that
  would take nothing for granted, and assent to no approximate or hypothetical
  truths. In their unfriendly, repellent attitude towards the Greek religion,
  and the old Greek morality, surely, they had been but faulty economists. The
  Greek religion was then alive: then, still more than in its later day of
  dissolution, the higher view of it was possible, even for the philosopher.
  Its story made little or no demand for a reasoned or formal acceptance. A
  religion, which had grown through and through man&rsquo;s life, with so much
  natural strength; had meant so much for so many generations; which expressed
  so much of their hopes, in forms so familiar and so winning; linked by
  associations so manifold to man as he had been and was&mdash;a religion like
  this, one would think, might have had its uses, even for a philosophic
  sceptic. Yet those beautiful gods, with the whole round of their poetic
  worship, the school of Cyrene definitely renounced.</p>

  <p>[23] The old Greek morality, again, with all its imperfections, was
  certainly a comely thing.&mdash;Yes! a harmony, a music, in men&rsquo;s ways,
  one might well hesitate to jar. The merely aesthetic sense might have had a
  legitimate satisfaction in the spectacle of that fair order of choice
  manners, in those attractive conventions, enveloping, so gracefully, the
  whole of life, insuring some sweetness, some security at least against
  offence, in the intercourse of the world. Beyond an obvious utility, it could
  claim, indeed but custom&mdash;use-and-wont, as we say&mdash;for its
  sanction. But then, one of the advantages of that liberty of spirit among the
  Cyrenaics (in which, through theory, they had become dead to theory, so that
  all theory, as such, was really indifferent to them, and indeed nothing
  valuable but in its tangible ministration to life) was precisely this, that
  it gave them free play in using as their ministers or servants, things which,
  to the uninitiated, must be masters or nothing. Yet, how little the followers
  of Aristippus made of that whole comely system of manners or morals, then
  actually in possession of life, is shown by the bold practical consequence,
  which one of them maintained (with a hard, self-opinionated adherence to his
  peculiar theory of values) in the not very amiable paradox that friendship
  and patriotism were things one could do without; while
  another&mdash;Death&rsquo;s- advocate, as he was called&mdash;helped so many
  to self-destruction, by his [24] pessimistic eloquence on the evils of life,
  that his lecture-room was closed. That this was in the range of their
  consequences&mdash;that this was a possible, if remote, deduction from the
  premisses of the discreet Aristippus&mdash;was surely an inconsistency in a
  thinker who professed above all things an economy of the moments of life. And
  yet those old Cyrenaics felt their way, as if in the dark, we may be sure,
  like other men in the ordinary transactions of life, beyond the narrow limits
  they drew of clear and absolutely legitimate knowledge, admitting what was
  not of immediate sensation, and drawing upon that &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo;
  future which might never come. A little more of such &ldquo;walking by
  faith,&rdquo; a little more of such not unreasonable &ldquo;assent,&rdquo;
  and they might have profited by a hundred services to their culture, from
  Greek religion and Greek morality, as they actually were. The spectacle of
  their fierce, exclusive, tenacious hold on their own narrow apprehension,
  makes one think of a picture with no relief, no soft shadows nor breadth of
  space, or of a drama without proportionate repose.</p>

  <p>Yet it was of perfection that Marius (to return to him again from his
  masters, his intellectual heirs) had been really thinking all the time: a
  narrow perfection it might be objected, the perfection of but one part of his
  nature&mdash;his capacities of feeling, of exquisite physical impressions, of
  an imaginative sympathy&mdash;but still, a true perfection of those
  capacities, wrought out [25] to their utmost degree, admirable enough in its
  way. He too is an economist: he hopes, by that &ldquo;insight&rdquo; of which
  the old Cyrenaics made so much, by skilful apprehension of the conditions of
  spiritual success as they really are, the special circumstances of the
  occasion with which he has to deal, the special felicities of his own nature,
  to make the most, in no mean or vulgar sense, of the few years of life; few,
  indeed, for the attainment of anything like general perfection! With the
  brevity of that sum of years his mind is exceptionally impressed; and this
  purpose makes him no frivolous dilettante, but graver than other men: his
  scheme is not that of a trifler, but rather of one who gives a meaning of his
  own, yet a very real one, to those old words&mdash;Let us work while it is
  day! He has a strong apprehension, also, of the beauty of the visible things
  around him; their fading, momentary, graces and attractions. His natural
  susceptibility in this direction, enlarged by experience, seems to demand of
  him an almost exclusive pre-occupation with the aspects of things; with their
  aesthetic character, as it is called&mdash;their revelations to the eye and
  the imagination: not so much because those aspects of them yield him the
  largest amount of enjoyment, as because to be occupied, in this way, with the
  aesthetic or imaginative side of things, is to be in real contact with those
  elements of his own nature, and of theirs, which, for him at [26] least, are
  matter of the most real kind of appre-hension. As other men are concentrated
  upon truths of number, for instance, or on business, or it may be on the
  pleasures of appetite, so he is wholly bent on living in that full stream of
  refined sensation. And in the prosecution of this love of beauty, he claims
  an entire personal liberty, liberty of heart and mind, liberty, above all,
  from what may seem conventional answers to first questions.</p>

  <p>But, without him there is a venerable system of sentiment and idea, widely
  extended in time and place, in a kind of impregnable possession of human
  life&mdash;a system, which, like some other great products of the conjoint
  efforts of human mind through many generations, is rich in the world&rsquo;s
  experience; so that, in attaching oneself to it, one lets in a great tide of
  that experience, and makes, as it were with a single step, a great experience
  of one&rsquo;s own, and with great consequent increase to one&rsquo;s sense
  of colour, variety, and relief, in the spectacle of men and things. The mere
  sense that one belongs to a system&mdash;an imperial system or
  organisation&mdash;has, in itself, the expanding power of a great experience;
  as some have felt who have been admitted from narrower sects into the
  communion of the catholic church; or as the old Roman citizen felt. It is, we
  might fancy, what the coming into possession of a very widely spoken language
  might be, with a great literature, which is also [27] the speech of the
  people we have to live among.</p>

  <p>A wonderful order, actually in possession of human life!&mdash;grown
  inextricably through and through it; penetrating into its laws, its very
  language, its mere habits of decorum, in a thousand half-conscious ways; yet
  still felt to be, in part, an unfulfilled ideal; and, as such, awakening
  hope, and an aim, identical with the one only consistent aspiration of
  mankind! In the apprehension of that, just then, Marius seemed to have joined
  company once more with his own old self; to have overtaken on the road the
  pilgrim who had come to Rome, with absolute sincerity, on the search for
  perfection. It defined not so much a change of practice, as of
  sympathy&mdash;a new departure, an expansion, of sympathy. It involved,
  certainly, some curtailment of his liberty, in concession to the actual
  manner, the distinctions, the enactments of that great crowd of admirable
  spirits, who have elected so, and not otherwise, in their conduct of life,
  and are not here to give one, so to term it, an &ldquo;indulgence.&rdquo; But
  then, under the supposition of their disapproval, no roses would ever seem
  worth plucking again. The authority they exercised was like that of classic
  taste&mdash;an influence so subtle, yet so real, as defining the loyalty of
  the scholar; or of some beautiful and venerable ritual, in which every
  observance is become spontaneous and almost mechanical, yet is found, [28]
  the more carefully one considers it, to have a reasonable significance and a
  natural history.</p>

  <p>And Marius saw that he would be but an inconsistent Cyrenaic, mistaken in
  his estimate of values, of loss and gain, and untrue to the well-considered
  economy of life which he had brought with him to Rome&mdash;that some drops
  of the great cup would fall to the ground&mdash;if he did not make that
  concession, if he did but remain just there.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17"></a>XVII. &mdash; BEATA URBS</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>&ldquo;Many prophets and kings have desired to see
  the things which ye see.&rdquo;</i></small></p>

  <p class="first">[29] THE enemy on the Danube was, indeed, but the vanguard
  of the mighty invading hosts of the fifth century. Illusively repressed just
  now, those confused movements along the northern boundary of the Empire were
  destined to unite triumphantly at last, in the barbarism, which, powerless to
  destroy the Christian church, was yet to suppress for a time the achieved
  culture of the pagan world. The kingdom of Christ was to grow up in a
  somewhat false alienation from the light and beauty of the kingdom of nature,
  of the natural man, with a partly mistaken tradition concerning it, and an
  incapacity, as it might almost seem at times, for eventual reconciliation
  thereto. Meantime Italy had armed itself once more, in haste, and the
  imperial brothers set forth for the Alps.</p>

  <p>Whatever misgiving the Roman people may [30] have felt as to the
  leadership of the younger was unexpectedly set at rest; though with some
  temporary regret for the loss of what had been, after all, a popular figure
  on the world&rsquo;s stage. Travelling fraternally in the same litter with
  Aurelius, Lucius Verus was struck with sudden and mysterious disease, and
  died as he hastened back to Rome. His death awoke a swarm of sinister
  rumours, to settle on Lucilla, jealous, it was said, of Fabia her sister,
  perhaps of Faustina&mdash;on Faustina herself, who had accompanied the
  imperial progress, and was anxious now to hide a crime of her own&mdash;even
  on the elder brother, who, beforehand with the treasonable designs of his
  colleague, should have helped him at supper to a favourite morsel, cut with a
  knife poisoned ingeniously on one side only. Aurelius, certainly, with
  sincere distress, his long irritations, so dutifully concealed or repressed,
  turning now into a single feeling of regret for the human creature, carried
  the remains back to Rome, and demanded of the Senate a public funeral, with a
  decree for the apotheosis, or canonisation, of the dead.</p>

  <p>For three days the body lay in state in the Forum, enclosed in an open
  coffin of cedar-wood, on a bed of ivory and gold, in the centre of a sort of
  temporary chapel, representing the temple of his patroness Venus Genetrix.
  Armed soldiers kept watch around it, while choirs of select voices relieved
  one another in the chanting of hymns or monologues from the great
  tragedians.</p>

  <p>[31] At the head of the couch were displayed the various personal
  decorations which had belonged to Verus in life. Like all the rest of Rome,
  Marius went to gaze on the face he had seen last scarcely disguised under the
  hood of a travelling-dress, as the wearer hurried, at night-fall, along one
  of the streets below the palace, to some amorous appointment. Unfamiliar as
  he still was with dead faces, he was taken by surprise, and touched far
  beyond what he had reckoned on, by the piteous change there; even the skill
  of Galen having been not wholly successful in the process of embalming. It
  was as if a brother of his own were lying low before him, with that meek and
  helpless expression it would have been a sacrilege to treat rudely.</p>

  <p>Meantime, in the centre of the Campus Martius, within the grove of poplars
  which enclosed the space where the body of Augustus had been burnt, the great
  funeral pyre, stuffed with shavings of various aromatic woods, was built up
  in many stages, separated from each other by a light entablature of woodwork,
  and adorned abundantly with carved and tapestried images. Upon this pyramidal
  or flame-shaped structure lay the corpse, hidden now under a mountain of
  flowers and incense brought by the women, who from the first had had their
  fondness for the wanton graces of the deceased. The dead body was surmounted
  by a waxen effigy of great size, arrayed in the triumphal ornaments. [32] At
  last the Centurions to whom that office belonged, drew near, torch in hand,
  to ignite the pile at its four corners, while the soldiers, in wild
  excitement, flung themselves around it, casting into the flames the
  decorations they had received for acts of valour under the dead
  emperor&rsquo;s command.</p>

  <p>It had been a really heroic order, spoiled a little, at the last moment,
  through the somewhat tawdry artifice, by which an eagle&mdash;not a very
  noble or youthful specimen of its kind&mdash;was caused to take flight amid
  the real or affected awe of the spectators, above the perishing remains; a
  court chamberlain, according to ancient etiquette, subsequently making
  official declaration before the Senate, that the imperial
  &ldquo;genius&rdquo; had been seen in this way, escaping from the fire. And
  Marius was present when the Fathers, duly certified of the fact, by
  &ldquo;acclamation,&rdquo; muttering their judgment all together, in a kind
  of low, rhythmical chant, decreed Caelum&mdash;the privilege of divine rank
  to the departed.</p>

  <p>The actual gathering of the ashes in a white cere-cloth by the widowed
  Lucilla, when the last flicker had been extinguished by drops of wine; and
  the conveyance of them to the little cell, already populous, in the central
  mass of the sepulchre of Hadrian, still in all the splendour of its statued
  colonnades, were a matter of private or domestic duty; after the due
  accomplishment of which Aurelius was at [33] liberty to retire for a time
  into the privacy o his beloved apartments of the Palatine. And hither, not
  long afterwards, Marius was summoned a second time, to receive from the
  imperial hands the great pile of Manuscripts it would be his business to
  revise and arrange.</p>

  <p>One year had passed since his first visit to the palace; and as he climbed
  the stairs to-day, the great cypresses rocked against the sunless sky, like
  living creatures in pain. He had to traverse a long subterranean gallery,
  once a secret entrance to the imperial apartments, and in our own day, amid
  the ruin of all around it, as smooth and fresh as if the carpets were but
  just removed from its floor after the return of the emperor from the shows.
  It was here, on such an occasion, that the emperor Caligula, at the age of
  twenty- nine, had come by his end, the assassins gliding along it as he
  lingered a few moments longer to watch the movements of a party of noble
  youths at their exercise in the courtyard below. As Marius waited, a second
  time, in that little red room in the house of the chief chamberlain, curious
  to look once more upon its painted walls&mdash;the very place whither the
  assassins were said to have turned for refuge after the murder&mdash;he could
  all but see the figure, which in its surrounding light and darkness seemed to
  him the most melancholy in the entire history of Rome. He called to mind the
  greatness of that popularity and early [34] promise&mdash;the stupefying
  height of irresponsible power, from which, after all, only men&rsquo;s viler
  side had been clearly visible&mdash;the overthrow of reason&mdash;the
  seemingly irredeemable memory; and still, above all, the beautiful head in
  which the noble lines of the race of Augustus were united to, he knew not
  what expression of sensibility and fineness, not theirs, and for the like of
  which one must pass onward to the Antonines. Popular hatred had been careful
  to destroy its semblance wherever it was to be found; but one bust, in dark
  bronze- like basalt of a wonderful perfection of finish, preserved in the
  museum of the Capitol, may have seemed to some visitors there perhaps the
  finest extant relic of Roman art. Had the very seal of empire upon those
  sombre brows, reflected from his mirror, suggested his insane attempt upon
  the liberties, the dignity of men?&mdash;&ldquo;O humanity!&rdquo; he seems
  to ask, &ldquo;what hast thou done to me that I should so despise
  thee?&rdquo;&mdash;And might not this be indeed the true meaning of kingship,
  if the world would have one man to reign over it? The like of this: or, some
  incredible, surely never to be realised, height of disinterestedness, in a
  king who should be the servant of all, quite at the other extreme of the
  practical dilemma involved in such a position. Not till some while after his
  death had the body been decently interred by the piety of the sisters he had
  driven into exile. Fraternity [35] of feeling had been no invariable feature
  in the incidents of Roman story. One long Vicus Sceleratus, from its first
  dim foundation in fraternal quarrel on the morrow of a common deliverance so
  touching&mdash;had not almost every step in it some gloomy memory of
  unnatural violence? Romans did well to fancy the traitress Tarpeia still
  &ldquo;green in earth,&rdquo; crowned, enthroned, at the roots of the
  Capitoline rock. If in truth the religion of Rome was everywhere in it, like
  that perfume of the funeral incense still upon the air, so also was the
  memory of crime prompted by a hypocritical cruelty, down to the erring, or
  not erring, Vesta calmly buried alive there, only eighty years ago, under
  Domitian.</p>

  <p>It was with a sense of relief that Marius found himself in the presence of
  Aurelius, whose gesture of friendly intelligence, as he entered, raised a
  smile at the gloomy train of his own thoughts just then, although since his
  first visit to the palace a great change had passed over it. The clear
  daylight found its way now into empty rooms. To raise funds for the war,
  Aurelius, his luxurious brother being no more, had determined to sell by
  auction the accumulated treasures of the imperial household. The works of
  art, the dainty furniture, had been removed, and were now &ldquo;on
  view&rdquo; in the Forum, to be the delight or dismay, for many weeks to
  come, of the [36] large public of those who were curious in these things. In
  such wise had Aurelius come to the condition of philosophic detachment he had
  affected as a boy, hardly persuaded to wear warm clothing, or to sleep in
  more luxurious manner than on the bare floor. But, in his empty house, the
  man of mind, who had always made so much of the pleasures of philosophic
  contemplation, felt freer in thought than ever. He had been reading, with
  less self-reproach than usual, in the Republic of Plato, those passages which
  describe the life of the philosopher- kings&mdash;like that of hired servants
  in their own house&mdash;who, possessed of the &ldquo;gold undefiled&rdquo;
  of intellectual vision, forgo so cheerfully all other riches. It was one of
  his happy days: one of those rare days, when, almost with none of the effort,
  otherwise so constant with him, his thoughts came rich and full, and
  converged in a mental view, as exhilarating to him as the prospect of some
  wide expanse of landscape to another man&rsquo;s bodily eye. He seemed to lie
  readier than was his wont to the imaginative influence of the philosophic
  reason&mdash;to its suggestions of a possible open country, commencing just
  where all actual experience leaves off, but which experience, one&rsquo;s own
  and not another&rsquo;s, may one day occupy. In fact, he was seeking strength
  for himself, in his own way, before he started for that ambiguous earthly
  warfare [37] which was to occupy the remainder of his life. &ldquo;Ever
  remember this,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that a happy life depends not on many
  things&mdash;<i>en oligistois keitai</i>." And to-day, committing himself
  with a steady effort of volition to the mere silence of the great empty
  apartments, he might be said to have escaped, according to Plato&rsquo;s
  promise to those who live closely with philosophy, from the evils of the
  world.</p>

  <p>In his &ldquo;conversations with himself&rdquo; Marcus Aurelius speaks
  often of that City on high, of which all other cities are but single
  habitations. From him in fact Cornelius Fronto, in his late discourse, had
  borrowed the expression; and he certainly meant by it more than the whole
  commonwealth of Rome, in any idealisation of it, however sublime. Incorporate
  somehow with the actual city whose goodly stones were lying beneath his gaze,
  it was also implicate in that reasonable constitution of nature, by devout
  contemplation of which it is possible for man to associate himself to the
  consciousness of God. In that New Rome he had taken up his rest for awhile on
  this day, deliberately feeding his thoughts on the better air of it, as
  another might have gone for mental renewal to a favourite villa.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men seek retirement in country-houses,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;on
  the sea-coast, on the mountains; and you have yourself as much fondness for
  such places as another. But there is little proof of culture therein; since
  the privilege is yours of [38] retiring into yourself whensoever you
  please,&mdash;into that little farm of one&rsquo;s own mind, where a silence
  so profound may be enjoyed.&rdquo; That it could make these retreats, was a
  plain consequence of the kingly prerogative of the mind, its dominion over
  circumstance, its inherent liberty.&mdash;&ldquo;It is in thy power to think
  as thou wilt: The essence of things is in thy thoughts about them: All is
  opinion, conception: No man can be hindered by another: What is outside thy
  circle of thought is nothing at all to it; hold to this, and you are safe:
  One thing is needful&mdash;to live close to the divine genius within thee,
  and minister thereto worthily.&rdquo; And the first point in this true
  ministry, this culture, was to maintain one&rsquo;s soul in a condition of
  indifference and calm. How continually had public claims, the claims of other
  persons, with their rough angularities of character, broken in upon him, the
  shepherd of the flock. But after all he had at least this privilege he could
  not part with, of thinking as he would; and it was well, now and then, by a
  conscious effort of will, to indulge it for a while, under systematic
  direction. The duty of thus making discreet, systematic use of the power of
  imaginative vision for purposes of spiritual culture, &ldquo;since the soul
  takes colour from its fantasies,&rdquo; is a point he has frequently insisted
  on.</p>

  <p>The influence of these seasonable meditations&mdash;a symbol, or
  sacrament, because an intensified [39] condition, of the soul&rsquo;s own
  ordinary and natural life&mdash;would remain upon it, perhaps for many days.
  There were experiences he could not forget, intuitions beyond price, he had
  come by in this way, which were almost like the breaking of a physical light
  upon his mind; as the great Augustus was said to have seen a mysterious
  physical splendour, yonder, upon the summit of the Capitol, where the altar
  of the Sibyl now stood. With a prayer, therefore, for inward quiet, for
  conformity to the divine reason, he read some select passages of Plato, which
  bear upon the harmony of the reason, in all its forms, with
  itself&mdash;&ldquo;Could there be Cosmos, that wonderful, reasonable order,
  in him, and nothing but disorder in the world without?&rdquo; It was from
  this question he had passed on to the vision of a reasonable, a divine,
  order, not in nature, but in the condition of human affairs&mdash;that unseen
  Celestial City, Uranopolis, Callipolis, Urbs Beata&mdash;in which, a
  consciousness of the divine will being everywhere realised, there would be,
  among other felicitous differences from this lower visible world, no more
  quite hopeless death, of men, or children, or of their affections. He had
  tried to- day, as never before, to make the most of this vision of a New
  Rome, to realise it as distinctly as he could,&mdash;and, as it were, find
  his way along its streets, ere he went down into a world so irksomely
  different, to make his practical effort towards it, with a soul full of [40]
  compassion for men as they were. However distinct the mental image might have
  been to him, with the descent of but one flight of steps into the
  market-place below, it must have retreated again, as if at touch of some
  malign magic wand, beyond the utmost verge of the horizon. But it had been
  actually, in his clearest vision of it, a confused place, with but a
  recognisable entry, a tower or fountain, here or there, and haunted by
  strange faces, whose novel expression he, the great physiognomist, could by
  no means read. Plato, indeed, had been able to articulate, to see, at least
  in thought, his ideal city. But just because Aurelius had passed beyond
  Plato, in the scope of the gracious charities he pre- supposed there, he had
  been unable really to track his way about it. Ah! after all, according to
  Plato himself, all vision was but reminiscence, and this, his heart&rsquo;s
  desire, no place his soul could ever have visited in any region of the old
  world&rsquo;s achievements. He had but divined, by a kind of generosity of
  spirit, the void place, which another experience than his must fill.</p>

  <p>Yet Marius noted the wonderful expression of peace, of quiet pleasure, on
  the countenance of Aurelius, as he received from him the rolls of fine clear
  manuscript, fancying the thoughts of the emperor occupied at the moment with
  the famous prospect towards the Alban hills, from those lofty windows.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; &ldquo;THE CEREMONY OF THE
     DART&rdquo;</h2>

  <p class="first">[41] THE ideas of Stoicism, so precious to Marcus Aurelius,
  ideas of large generalisation, have sometimes induced, in those over whose
  intellects they have had real power, a coldness of heart. It was the
  distinction of Aurelius that he was able to harmonise them with the kindness,
  one might almost say the amenities, of a humourist, as also with the popular
  religion and its many gods. Those vasty conceptions of the later Greek
  philosophy had in them, in truth, the germ of a sort of austerely
  opinionative &ldquo;natural theology,&rdquo; and how often has that led to
  religious dryness&mdash;a hard contempt of everything in religion, which
  touches the senses, or charms the fancy, or really concerns the affections.
  Aurelius had made his own the secret of passing, naturally, and with no
  violence to his thought, to and fro, between the richly coloured and romantic
  religion of those old gods who had still been human beings, and a very
  abstract speculation upon the impassive, [42] universal soul&mdash;that
  circle whose centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere&mdash;of which a
  series of purely logical necessities had evolved the formula. As in many
  another instance, those traditional pieties of the place and the hour had
  been derived by him from his mother:&mdash;<i>para tes metros to
  theosebes</i>. Purified, as all such religion of concrete time and place
  needs to be, by frequent confronting with the ideal of godhead as revealed to
  that innate religious sense in the possession of which Aurelius differed from
  the people around him, it was the ground of many a sociability with their
  simpler souls, and for himself, certainly, a consolation, whenever the wings
  of his own soul flagged in the trying atmosphere of purely intellectual
  vision. A host of companions, guides, helpers, about him from of old time,
  &ldquo;the very court and company of heaven,&rdquo; objects for him of
  personal reverence and affection&mdash;the supposed presence of the ancient
  popular gods determined the character of much of his daily life, and might
  prove the last stay of human nature at its weakest. &ldquo;In every time and
  place,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;it rests with thyself to use the event of
  the hour religiously: at all seasons worship the gods.&rdquo; And when he
  said &ldquo;Worship the gods!&rdquo; he did it, as strenuously as everything
  else.</p>

  <p>Yet here again, how often must he have experienced disillusion, or even
  some revolt of [43] feeling, at that contact with coarser natures to which
  his religious conclusions exposed him. At the beginning of the year one
  hundred and seventy-three public anxiety was as great as ever; and as before
  it brought people&rsquo;s superstition into unreserved play. For seven days
  the images of the old gods, and some of the graver new ones, lay solemnly
  exposed in the open air, arrayed in all their ornaments, each in his separate
  resting-place, amid lights and burning incense, while the crowd, following
  the imperial example, daily visited them, with offerings of flowers to this
  or that particular divinity, according to the devotion of each.</p>

  <p>But supplementing these older official observances, the very wildest gods
  had their share of worship,&mdash;strange creatures with strange secrets
  startled abroad into open daylight. The delirious sort of religion of which
  Marius was a spectator in the streets of Rome, during the seven days of the
  Lectisternium, reminded him now and again of an observation of Apuleius: it
  was &ldquo;as if the presence of the gods did not do men good, but disordered
  or weakened them.&rdquo; Some jaded women of fashion, especially, found in
  certain oriental devotions, at once relief for their religiously tearful
  souls and an opportunity for personal display; preferring this or that
  &ldquo;mystery,&rdquo; chiefly because the attire required in it was suitable
  to their peculiar manner of beauty. And one morning Marius [44] encountered
  an extraordinary crimson object, borne in a litter through an excited
  crowd&mdash;the famous courtesan Benedicta, still fresh from the bath of
  blood, to which she had submitted herself, sitting below the scaffold where
  the victims provided for that purpose were slaughtered by the priests. Even
  on the last day of the solemnity, when the emperor himself performed one of
  the oldest ceremonies of the Roman religion, this fantastic piety had
  asserted itself. There were victims enough certainly, brought from the choice
  pastures of the Sabine mountains, and conducted around the city they were to
  die for, in almost continuous procession, covered with flowers and well-nigh
  worried to death before the time by the crowds of people superstitiously
  pressing to touch them. But certain old-fashioned Romans, in these
  exceptional circumstances, demanded something more than this, in the way of a
  human sacrifice after the ancient pattern; as when, not so long since, some
  Greeks or Gauls had been buried alive in the Forum. At least, human blood
  should be shed; and it was through a wild multitude of fanatics, cutting
  their flesh with knives and whips and licking up ardently the crimson stream,
  that the emperor repaired to the temple of Bellona, and in solemn symbolic
  act cast the bloodstained spear, or &ldquo;dart,&rdquo; carefully preserved
  there, towards the enemy&rsquo;s country&mdash;[45] towards that unknown
  world of German homes, still warm, as some believed under the faint northern
  twilight, with those innocent affections of which Romans had lost the sense.
  And this at least was clear, amid all doubts of abstract right or wrong on
  either side, that the ruin of those homes was involved in what Aurelius was
  then preparing for, with,&mdash;Yes! the gods be thanked for that achievement
  of an invigorating philosophy!&mdash;almost with a light heart.</p>

  <p>For, in truth, that departure, really so difficult to him, for which
  Marcus Aurelius had needed to brace himself so strenuously, came to test the
  power of a long-studied theory of practice; and it was the development of
  this theory&mdash;a theoria, literally&mdash;a view, an intuition, of the
  most important facts, and still more important possibilities, concerning man
  in the world, that Marius now discovered, almost as if by accident, below the
  dry surface of the manuscripts entrusted to him. The great purple rolls
  contained, first of all, statistics, a general historical account of the
  writer&rsquo;s own time, and an exact diary; all alike, though in three
  different degrees of nearness to the writer&rsquo;s own personal experience,
  laborious, formal, self- suppressing. This was for the instruction of the
  public; and part of it has, perhaps, found its way into the Augustan
  Histories. But it was for the especial guidance of his son Commodus that he
  had permitted himself to break out, here [46] and there, into reflections
  upon what was passing, into conversations with the reader. And then, as
  though he were put off his guard in this way, there had escaped into the
  heavy matter-of-fact, of which the main portion was composed, morsels of his
  conversation with himself. It was the romance of a soul (to be traced only in
  hints, wayside notes, quotations from older masters), as it were in lifelong,
  and often baffled search after some vanished or elusive golden fleece, or
  Hesperidean fruit-trees, or some mysterious light of doctrine, ever
  retreating before him. A man, he had seemed to Marius from the first, of two
  lives, as we say. Of what nature, he had sometimes wondered, on the day, for
  instance, when he had interrupted the emperor&rsquo;s musings in the empty
  palace, might be that placid inward guest or inhabitant, who from amid the
  pre-occupations of the man of practical affairs looked out, as if surprised,
  at the things and faces around. Here, then, under the tame surface of what
  was meant for a life of business, Marius discovered, welcoming a brother, the
  spontaneous self-revelation of a soul as delicate as his own,&mdash;a soul
  for which conversation with itself was a necessity of existence. Marius,
  indeed, had always suspected that the sense of such necessity was a
  peculiarity of his. But here, certainly, was another, in this respect like
  himself; and again he seemed to detect the advent of some [47] new or changed
  spirit into the world, mystic, inward, hardly to be satisfied with that
  wholly external and objective habit of life, which had been sufficient for
  the old classic soul. His purely literary curiosity was greatly stimulated by
  this example of a book of self-portraiture. It was in fact the position of
  the modern essayist,&mdash;creature of efforts rather than of achievements,
  in the matter of apprehending truth, but at least conscious of lights by the
  way, which he must needs record, acknowledge. What seemed to underlie that
  position was the desire to make the most of every experience that might come,
  outwardly or from within: to perpetuate, to display, what was so fleeting, in
  a kind of instinctive, pathetic protest against the imperial writer&rsquo;s
  own theory&mdash;that theory of the &ldquo;perpetual flux&rdquo; of all
  things&mdash;to Marius himself, so plausible from of old.</p>

  <p>There was, besides, a special moral or doctrinal significance in the
  making of such conversation with one&rsquo;s self at all. The Logos, the
  reasonable spark, in man, is common to him with the gods&mdash;<i>koinos auto
  pros tous theous</i>&mdash;<i>cum diis communis</i>. That might seem but the
  truism of a certain school of philosophy; but in Aurelius was clearly an
  original and lively apprehension. There could be no inward conversation with
  one&rsquo;s self such as this, unless there were indeed some one else, aware
  of our actual thoughts and feelings, pleased or displeased at [48]
  one&rsquo;s disposition of one&rsquo;s self. Cornelius Fronto too could
  enounce that theory of the reasonable community between men and God, in many
  different ways. But then, he was a cheerful man, and Aurelius a singularly
  sad one; and what to Fronto was but a doctrine, or a motive of mere rhetoric,
  was to the other a consolation. He walks and talks, for a spiritual
  refreshment lacking which he would faint by the way, with what to the learned
  professor is but matter of philosophic eloquence.</p>

  <p>In performing his public religious functions Marcus Aurelius had ever
  seemed like one who took part in some great process, a great thing really
  done, with more than the actually visible assistants about him. Here, in
  these manuscripts, in a hundred marginal flowers of thought or language, in
  happy new phrases of his own like the impromptus of an actual conversation,
  in quotations from other older masters of the inward life, taking new
  significance from the chances of such intercourse, was the record of his
  communion with that eternal reason, which was also his own proper self, with
  the divine companion, whose tabernacle was in the intelligence of
  men&mdash;the journal of his daily commerce with that.</p>

  <p>Chance: or Providence! Chance: or Wisdom, one with nature and man,
  reaching from end to end, through all time and all existence, orderly
  disposing all things, according to [49] fixed periods, as he describes it, in
  terms very like certain well-known words of the book of Wisdom:&mdash;those
  are the &ldquo;fenced opposites&rdquo; of the speculative dilemma, the tragic
  embarras, of which Aurelius cannot too often remind himself as the summary of
  man&rsquo;s situation in the world. If there be, however, a provident soul
  like this &ldquo;behind the veil,&rdquo; truly, even to him, even in the most
  intimate of those conversations, it has never yet spoken with any quite
  irresistible assertion of its presence. Yet one&rsquo;s choice in that
  speculative dilemma, as he has found it, is on the whole a matter of
  will.&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis in thy power,&rdquo; here too, again, &ldquo;to
  think as thou wilt.&rdquo; For his part he has asserted his will, and has the
  courage of his opinion. &ldquo;To the better of two things, if thou findest
  that, turn with thy whole heart: eat and drink ever of the best before
  thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; says that other disciple of the Sapiential
  philosophy, &ldquo;hath mingled Her wine, she hath also prepared Herself a
  table.&rdquo; <i>Tou aristou apolaue</i>: &ldquo;Partake ever of Her
  best!&rdquo; And what Marius, peeping now very closely upon the intimacies of
  that singular mind, found a thing actually pathetic and affecting, was the
  manner of the writer&rsquo;s bearing as in the presence of this supposed
  guest; so elusive, so jealous of any palpable manifestation of himself, so
  taxing to one&rsquo;s faith, never allowing one to lean frankly upon him and
  feel wholly at rest. Only, he [50] would do his part, at least, in
  maintaining the constant fitness, the sweetness and quiet, of the
  guest-chamber. Seeming to vary with the intellectual fortune of the hour,
  from the plainest account of experience, to a sheer fantasy, only
  &ldquo;believed because it was impossible,&rdquo; that one hope was, at all
  events, sufficient to make men&rsquo;s common pleasures and their common
  ambition, above all their commonest vices, seem very petty indeed, too petty
  to know of. It bred in him a kind of magnificence of character, in the old
  Greek sense of the term; a temper incompatible with any merely plausible
  advocacy of his convictions, or merely superficial thoughts about anything
  whatever, or talk about other people, or speculation as to what was passing
  in their so visibly little souls, or much talking of any kind, however clever
  or graceful. A soul thus disposed had &ldquo;already entered into the better
  life":&mdash;was indeed in some sort &ldquo;a priest, a minister of the
  gods.&rdquo; Hence his constant &ldquo;recollection&rdquo;; a close watching
  of his soul, of a kind almost unique in the ancient world.&mdash;Before all
  things examine into thyself: strive to be at home with thyself!&mdash;Marius,
  a sympathetic witness of all this, might almost seem to have had a foresight
  of monasticism itself in the prophetic future. With this mystic companion he
  had gone a step onward out of the merely objective pagan existence. Here was
  already a master in that craft of self- direction, which was about to [51]
  play so large a part in the forming of human mind, under the sanction of the
  Christian church.</p>

  <p>Yet it was in truth a somewhat melancholy service, a service on which one
  must needs move about, solemn, serious, depressed, with the hushed footsteps
  of those who move about the house where a dead body is lying. Such was the
  impression which occurred to Marius again and again as he read, with a
  growing sense of some profound dissidence from his author. By certain quite
  traceable links of association he was reminded, in spite of the moral beauty
  of the philosophic emperor&rsquo;s ideas, how he had sat, essentially
  unconcerned, at the public shows. For, actually, his contemplations had made
  him of a sad heart, inducing in him that
  melancholy&mdash;Tristitia&mdash;which even the monastic moralists have held
  to be of the nature of deadly sin, akin to the sin of Desidia or Inactivity.
  Resignation, a sombre resignation, a sad heart, patient bearing of the burden
  of a sad heart:&mdash;Yes! this belonged doubtless to the situation of an
  honest thinker upon the world. Only, in this case there seemed to be too much
  of a complacent acquiescence in the world as it is. And there could be no
  true Theodice in that; no real accommodation of the world as it is, to the
  divine pattern of the Logos, the eternal reason, over against it. It amounted
  to a tolerance of evil.</p>

  <p class="quote">The soul of good, though it moveth upon a way thou canst but
  little understand, yet prospereth on the journey:</p>

  <p class="quote">[52] If thou sufferest nothing contrary to nature, there can
  be nought of evil with thee therein.</p>

  <p class="quote">If thou hast done aught in harmony with that reason in which
  men are communicant with the gods, there also can be nothing of evil with
  thee&mdash;nothing to be afraid of:</p>

  <p class="quote">Whatever is, is right; as from the hand of one dispensing to
  every man according to his desert:</p>

  <p class="quote">If reason fulfil its part in things, what more dost thou
  require?</p>

  <p class="quote">Dost thou take it ill that thy stature is but of four
  cubits?</p>

  <p class="quote">That which happeneth to each of us is for the profit of the
  whole.</p>

  <p class="quote">The profit of the whole,&mdash;that was sufficient!</p>

  <p>&mdash;Links, in a train of thought really generous! of which,
  nevertheless, the forced and yet facile optimism, refusing to see evil
  anywhere, might lack, after all, the secret of genuine cheerfulness. It left
  in truth a weight upon the spirits; and with that weight unlifted, there
  could be no real justification of the ways of Heaven to man. &ldquo;Let thine
  air be cheerful,&rdquo; he had said; and, with an effort, did himself at
  times attain to that serenity of aspect, which surely ought to accompany, as
  their outward flower and favour, hopeful assumptions like those. Still, what
  in Aurelius was but a passing expression, was with Cornelius (Marius could
  but note the contrast) nature, and a veritable physiognomy. With Cornelius,
  in fact, it was nothing less than the joy which Dante apprehended in the
  blessed spirits of the perfect, the outward semblance of which, like a reflex
  of physical light upon human faces from &ldquo;the land which is very far
  off,&rdquo; we may trace from Giotto onward to its consummation in the work
  of Raphael&mdash;the serenity, the [53] durable cheerfulness, of those who
  have been indeed delivered from death, and of which the utmost degree of that
  famed &ldquo;blitheness &ldquo;of the Greeks had been but a transitory gleam,
  as in careless and wholly superficial youth. And yet, in Cornelius, it was
  certainly united with the bold recognition of evil as a fact in the world;
  real as an aching in the head or heart, which one instinctively desires to
  have cured; an enemy with whom no terms could be made, visible, hatefully
  visible, in a thousand forms&mdash;the apparent waste of men&rsquo;s gifts in
  an early, or even in a late grave; the death, as such, of men, and even of
  animals; the disease and pain of the body.</p>

  <p>And there was another point of dissidence between Aurelius and his
  reader.&mdash;The philosophic emperor was a despiser of the body. Since it is
  &ldquo;the peculiar privilege of reason to move within herself, and to be
  proof against corporeal impressions, suffering neither sensation nor passion
  to break in upon her,&rdquo; it follows that the true interest of the spirit
  must ever be to treat the body&mdash;Well! as a corpse attached thereto,
  rather than as a living companion&mdash;nay, actually to promote its
  dissolution. In counterpoise to the inhumanity of this, presenting itself to
  the young reader as nothing less than a sin against nature, the very person
  of Cornelius was nothing less than a sanction of that reverent delight Marius
  had always had in the visible body of man. Such delight indeed had been but
  [54] a natural consequence of the sensuous or materialistic character of the
  philosophy of his choice. Now to Cornelius the body of man was unmistakeably,
  as a later seer terms it, the one true temple in the world; or rather itself
  the proper object of worship, of a sacred service, in which the very finest
  gold might have its seemliness and due symbolic use:&mdash;Ah! and of what
  awe-stricken pity also, in its dejection, in the perishing gray bones of a
  poor man&rsquo;s grave!</p>

  <p>Some flaw of vision, thought Marius, must be involved in the
  philosopher&rsquo;s contempt for it&mdash;some diseased point of thought, or
  moral dulness, leading logically to what seemed to him the strangest of all
  the emperor&rsquo;s inhumanities, the temper of the suicide; for which there
  was just then, indeed, a sort of mania in the world. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis part
  of the business of life,&rdquo; he read, &ldquo;to lose it handsomely.&rdquo;
  On due occasion, &ldquo;one might give life the slip.&rdquo; The moral or
  mental powers might fail one; and then it were a fair question, precisely,
  whether the time for taking leave was not come:- -"Thou canst leave this
  prison when thou wilt. Go forth boldly!&rdquo; Just there, in the bare
  capacity to entertain such question at all, there was what Marius, with a
  soul which must always leap up in loyal gratitude for mere physical sunshine,
  touching him as it touched the flies in the air, could not away with. There,
  surely, was a sign of some crookedness in the natural power of apprehension.
  It was the [55] attitude, the melancholy intellectual attitude, of one who
  might be greatly mistaken in things&mdash;who might make the greatest of
  mistakes.</p>

  <p>A heart that could forget itself in the misfortune, or even in the
  weakness of others:&mdash;of this Marius had certainly found the trace, as a
  confidant of the emperor&rsquo;s conversations with himself, in spite of
  those jarring inhumanities, of that pretension to a stoical indifference, and
  the many difficulties of his manner of writing. He found it again not long
  afterwards, in still stronger evidence, in this way. As he read one morning
  early, there slipped from the rolls of manuscript a sealed letter with the
  emperor&rsquo;s superscription, which might well be of importance, and he
  felt bound to deliver it at once in person; Aurelius being then absent from
  Rome in one of his favourite retreats, at Praeneste, taking a few days of
  quiet with his young children, before his departure for the war. A whole day
  passed as Marius crossed the Campagna on horseback, pleased by the random
  autumn lights bringing out in the distance the sheep at pasture, the
  shepherds in their picturesque dress, the golden elms, tower and villa; and
  it was after dark that he mounted the steep street of the little hill-town to
  the imperial residence. He was struck by an odd mixture of stillness and
  excitement about the place. Lights burned at the windows. It seemed that
  numerous visitors were within, for the courtyard was crowded with litters and
  horses [56] in waiting. For the moment, indeed, all larger cares, even the
  cares of war, of late so heavy a pressure, had been forgotten in what was
  passing with the little Annius Verus; who for his part had forgotten his
  toys, lying all day across the knees of his mother, as a mere child&rsquo;s
  ear-ache grew rapidly to alarming sickness with great and manifest agony,
  only suspended a little, from time to time, when from very weariness he
  passed into a few moments of unconsciousness. The country surgeon called in,
  had removed the imposthume with the knife. There had been a great effort to
  bear this operation, for the terrified child, hardly persuaded to submit
  himself, when his pain was at its worst, and even more for the parents. At
  length, amid a company of pupils pressing in with him, as the custom was, to
  watch the proceedings in the sick-room, the eminent Galen had arrived, only
  to pronounce the thing done visibly useless, the patient falling now into
  longer intervals of delirium. And thus, thrust on one side by the crowd of
  departing visitors, Marius was forced into the privacy of a grief, the
  desolate face of which went deep into his memory, as he saw the emperor carry
  the child away&mdash;quite conscious at last, but with a touching expression
  upon it of weakness and defeat&mdash;pressed close to his bosom, as if he
  yearned just then for one thing only, to be united, to be absolutely one with
  it, in its obscure distress.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE WILL AS VISION</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>Paratum cor meum deus! paratum cor
  meum!</i></small></p>

  <p class="first">[57] THE emperor demanded a senatorial decree for the
  erection of images in memory of the dead prince; that a golden one should be
  carried, together with the other images, in the great procession of the
  Circus, and the addition of the child&rsquo;s name to the Hymn of the Salian
  Priests: and so, stifling private grief, without further delay set forth for
  the war.</p>

  <p>True kingship, as Plato, the old master of Aurelius, had understood it,
  was essentially of the nature of a service. If so be, you can discover a mode
  of life more desirable than the being a king, for those who shall be kings;
  then, the true Ideal of the State will become a possibility; but not
  otherwise. And if the life of Beatific Vision be indeed possible, if
  philosophy really &ldquo;concludes in an ecstasy,&rdquo; affording full
  fruition to the entire nature of man; then, for certain elect souls at least,
  a mode of life will have been [58] discovered more desirable than to be a
  king. By love or fear you might induce such persons to forgo their privilege;
  to take upon them the distasteful task of governing other men, or even of
  leading them to victory in battle. But, by the very conditions of its tenure,
  their dominion would be wholly a ministry to others: they would have taken
  upon them-"the form of a servant&rdquo;: they would be reigning for the
  well-being of others rather than their own. The true king, the righteous
  king, would be Saint Lewis, exiling himself from the better land and its
  perfected company&mdash;so real a thing to him, definite and real as the
  pictured scenes of his psalter&mdash;to take part in or to arbitrate
  men&rsquo;s quarrels, about the transitory appearances of things. In a lower
  degree (lower, in proportion as the highest Platonic dream is lower than any
  Christian vision) the true king would be Marcus Aurelius, drawn from the
  meditation of books, to be the ruler of the Roman people in peace, and still
  more, in war.</p>

  <p>To Aurelius, certainly, the philosophic mood, the visions, however dim,
  which this mood brought with it, were sufficiently pleasant to him, together
  with the endearments of his home, to make public rule nothing less than a
  sacrifice of himself according to Plato&rsquo;s requirement, now consummated
  in his setting forth for the campaign on the Danube. That it was such a
  sacrifice was to Marius visible fact, as he saw him [59] ceremoniously lifted
  into the saddle amid all the pageantry of an imperial departure, yet with the
  air less of a sanguine and self-reliant leader than of one in some way or
  other already defeated. Through the fortune of the subsequent years, passing
  and repassing so inexplicably from side to side, the rumour of which reached
  him amid his own quiet studies, Marius seemed always to see that central
  figure, with its habitually dejected hue grown now to an expression of
  positive suffering, all the stranger from its contrast with the magnificent
  armour worn by the emperor on this occasion, as it had been worn by his
  predecessor Hadrian.</p>

  <p>Totus et argento contextus et auro:</p>

  <p>clothed in its gold and silver, dainty as that old divinely constructed
  armour of which Homer tells, but without its miraculous
  lightsomeness&mdash;he looked out baffled, labouring, moribund; a mere
  comfortless shadow taking part in some shadowy reproduction of the labours of
  Hercules, through those northern, mist-laden confines of the civilised world.
  It was as if the familiar soul which had been so friendly disposed towards
  him were actually departed to Hades; and when he read the Conversations
  afterwards, though his judgment of them underwent no material change, it was
  nevertheless with the allowance we make for the dead. The memory of that
  suffering image, while it certainly strengthened his adhesion [60] to what he
  could accept at all in the philosophy of Aurelius, added a strange pathos to
  what must seem the writer&rsquo;s mistakes. What, after all, had been the
  meaning of that incident, observed as so fortunate an omen long since, when
  the prince, then a little child much younger than was usual, had stood in
  ceremony among the priests of Mars and flung his crown of flowers with the
  rest at the sacred image reclining on the Pulvinar? The other crowns lodged
  themselves here or there; when, Lo! the crown thrown by Aurelius, the
  youngest of them all, alighted upon the very brows of the god, as if placed
  there by a careful hand! He was still young, also, when on the day of his
  adoption by Antoninus Pius he saw himself in a dream, with as it were
  shoulders of ivory, like the images of the gods, and found them more capable
  than shoulders of flesh. Yet he was now well-nigh fifty years of age, setting
  out with two-thirds of life behind him, upon a labour which would fill the
  remainder of it with anxious cares&mdash;a labour for which he had perhaps no
  capacity, and certainly no taste.</p>

  <p>That ancient suit of armour was almost the only object Aurelius now
  possessed from all those much cherished articles of vertu collected by the
  Caesars, making the imperial residence like a magnificent museum. Not men
  alone were needed for the war, so that it became necessary, to the great
  disgust alike of timid persons and of [61] the lovers of sport, to arm the
  gladiators, but money also was lacking. Accordingly, at the sole motion of
  Aurelius himself, unwilling that the public burden should be further
  increased, especially on the part of the poor, the whole of the imperial
  ornaments and furniture, a sumptuous collection of gems formed by Hadrian,
  with many works of the most famous painters and sculptors, even the precious
  ornaments of the emperor&rsquo;s chapel or Lararium, and the wardrobe of the
  empress Faustina, who seems to have borne the loss without a murmur, were
  exposed for public auction. &ldquo;These treasures,&rdquo; said Aurelius,
  &ldquo;like all else that I possess, belong by right to the Senate and
  People.&rdquo; Was it not a characteristic of the true kings in Plato that
  they had in their houses nothing they could call their own? Connoisseurs had
  a keen delight in the mere reading of the Praetor&rsquo;s list of the
  property for sale. For two months the learned in these matters were daily
  occupied in the appraising of the embroidered hangings, the choice articles
  of personal use selected for preservation by each succeeding age, the great
  outlandish pearls from Hadrian&rsquo;s favourite cabinet, the marvellous
  plate lying safe behind the pretty iron wicker-work of the shops in the
  goldsmiths&rsquo; quarter. Meantime ordinary persons might have an interest
  in the inspection of objects which had been as daily companions to people so
  far above and remote from them&mdash;things so fine also [62] in workmanship
  and material as to seem, with their antique and delicate air, a worthy
  survival of the grand bygone eras, like select thoughts or utterances
  embodying the very spirit of the vanished past. The town became more pensive
  than ever over old fashions.</p>

  <p>The welcome amusement of this last act of preparation for the great war
  being now over, all Rome seemed to settle down into a singular quiet, likely
  to last long, as though bent only on watching from afar the languid, somewhat
  uneventful course of the contest itself. Marius took advantage of it as an
  opportunity for still closer study than of old, only now and then going out
  to one of his favourite spots on the Sabine or Alban hills for a quiet even
  greater than that of Rome in the country air. On one of these occasions, as
  if by favour of an invisible power withdrawing some unknown cause of
  dejection from around him, he enjoyed a quite unusual sense of self-
  possession&mdash;the possession of his own best and happiest self. After some
  gloomy thoughts over- night, he awoke under the full tide of the rising sun,
  himself full, in his entire refreshment, of that almost religious
  appreciation of sleep, the graciousness of its influence on men&rsquo;s
  spirits, which had made the old Greeks conceive of it as a god. It was like
  one of those old joyful wakings of childhood, now becoming rarer and rarer
  with him, and looked back upon with much regret as a measure of advancing
  age. In fact, [63] the last bequest of this serene sleep had been a dream, in
  which, as once before, he overheard those he loved best pronouncing his name
  very pleasantly, as they passed through the rich light and shadow of a summer
  morning, along the pavement of a city&mdash;Ah! fairer far than Rome! In a
  moment, as he arose, a certain oppression of late setting very heavily upon
  him was lifted away, as though by some physical motion in the air.</p>

  <p>That flawless serenity, better than the most pleasurable excitement, yet
  so easily ruffled by chance collision even with the things and persons he had
  come to value as the greatest treasure in life, was to be wholly his to-day,
  he thought, as he rode towards Tibur, under the early sunshine; the marble of
  its villas glistening all the way before him on the hillside. And why could
  he not hold such serenity of spirit ever at command? he asked, expert as he
  was at last become in the art of setting the house of his thoughts in order.
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis in thy power to think as thou wilt:&rdquo; he repeated to
  himself: it was the most serviceable of all the lessons enforced on him by
  those imperial conversations.&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis in thy power to think
  as thou wilt.&rdquo; And were the cheerful, sociable, restorative beliefs, of
  which he had there read so much, that bold adhesion, for instance, to the
  hypothesis of an eternal friend to man, just hidden behind the veil of a
  mechanical and material order, but only just behind it, [64] ready perhaps
  even now to break through:&mdash;were they, after all, really a matter of
  choice, dependent on some deliberate act of volition on his part? Were they
  doctrines one might take for granted, generously take for granted, and led on
  by them, at first as but well-defined objects of hope, come at last into the
  region of a corresponding certitude of the intellect? &ldquo;It is the truth
  I seek,&rdquo; he had read, &ldquo;the truth, by which no one,&rdquo; gray
  and depressing though it might seem, &ldquo;was ever really injured.&rdquo;
  And yet, on the other hand, the imperial wayfarer, he had been able to go
  along with so far on his intellectual pilgrimage, let fall many things
  concerning the practicability of a methodical and self-forced assent to
  certain principles or presuppositions &ldquo;one could not do without.&rdquo;
  Were there, as the expression &ldquo;one could not do without&rdquo; seemed
  to hint, beliefs, without which life itself must be almost impossible,
  principles which had their sufficient ground of evidence in that very fact?
  Experience certainly taught that, as regarding the sensible world he could
  attend or not, almost at will, to this or that colour, this or that train of
  sounds, in the whole tumultuous concourse of colour and sound, so it was
  also, for the well-trained intelligence, in regard to that hum of voices
  which besiege the inward no less than the outward ear. Might it be not
  otherwise with those various and competing hypotheses, the permissible
  hypotheses, which, [65] in that open field for hypothesis&mdash;one&rsquo;s
  own actual ignorance of the origin and tendency of our being&mdash;present
  themselves so importunately, some of them with so emphatic a reiteration,
  through all the mental changes of successive ages? Might the will itself be
  an organ of knowledge, of vision?</p>

  <p>On this day truly no mysterious light, no irresistibly leading hand from
  afar reached him; only the peculiarly tranquil influence of its first hour
  increased steadily upon him, in a manner with which, as he conceived, the
  aspects of the place he was then visiting had something to do. The air there,
  air supposed to possess the singular property of restoring the whiteness of
  ivory, was pure and thin. An even veil of lawn-like white cloud had now drawn
  over the sky; and under its broad, shadowless light every hue and tone of
  time came out upon the yellow old temples, the elegant pillared circle of the
  shrine of the patronal Sibyl, the houses seemingly of a piece with the
  ancient fundamental rock. Some half-conscious motive of poetic grace would
  appear to have determined their grouping; in part resisting, partly going
  along with the natural wildness and harshness of the place, its floods and
  precipices. An air of immense age possessed, above all, the vegetation
  around&mdash;a world of evergreen trees&mdash;the olives especially, older
  than how many generations of men&rsquo;s lives! fretted and twisted by the
  combining forces of [66] life and death, into every conceivable caprice of
  form. In the windless weather all seemed to be listening to the roar of the
  immemorial waterfall, plunging down so unassociably among these human
  habitations, and with a motion so unchanging from age to age as to count,
  even in this time-worn place, as an image of unalterable rest. Yet the clear
  sky all but broke to let through the ray which was silently quickening
  everything in the late February afternoon, and the unseen violet refined
  itself through the air. It was as if the spirit of life in nature were but
  withholding any too precipitate revelation of itself, in its slow, wise,
  maturing work.</p>

  <p>Through some accident to the trappings of his horse at the inn where he
  rested, Marius had an unexpected delay. He sat down in an olive-garden, and,
  all around him and within still turning to reverie, the course of his own
  life hitherto seemed to withdraw itself into some other world, disparted from
  this spectacular point where he was now placed to survey it, like that
  distant road below, along which he had travelled this morning across the
  Campagna. Through a dreamy land he could see himself moving, as if in another
  life, and like another person, through all his fortunes and misfortunes,
  passing from point to point, weeping, delighted, escaping from various
  dangers. That prospect brought him, first of all, an impulse of lively
  gratitude: it was as if he must look round for some one [67] else to share
  his joy with: for some one to whom he might tell the thing, for his own
  relief. Companionship, indeed, familiarity with others, gifted in this way or
  that, or at least pleasant to him, had been, through one or another long span
  of it, the chief delight of the journey. And was it only the resultant
  general sense of such familiarity, diffused through his memory, that in a
  while suggested the question whether there had not been&mdash;besides
  Flavian, besides Cornelius even, and amid the solitude he had which in spite
  of ardent friendship perhaps loved best of all things&mdash;some other
  companion, an unfailing companion, ever at his side throughout; doubling his
  pleasure in the roses by the way, patient of his peevishness or depression,
  sympathetic above all with his grateful recognition, onward from his earliest
  days, of the fact that he was there at all? Must not the whole world around
  have faded away for him altogether, had he been left for one moment really
  alone in it? In his deepest apparent solitude there had been rich
  entertainment. It was as if there were not one only, but two wayfarers, side
  by side, visible there across the plain, as he indulged his fancy. A bird
  came and sang among the wattled hedge-roses: an animal feeding crept nearer:
  the child who kept it was gazing quietly: and the scene and the hours still
  conspiring, he passed from that mere fantasy of a self not himself, beside
  him in his coming and [68] going, to those divinations of a living and
  companionable spirit at work in all things, of which he had become aware from
  time to time in his old philosophic readings&mdash;in Plato and others, last
  but not least, in Aurelius. Through one reflection upon another, he passed
  from such instinctive divinations, to the thoughts which give them logical
  consistency, formulating at last, as the necessary exponent of our own and
  the world&rsquo;s life, that reasonable Ideal to which the Old Testament
  gives the name of Creator, which for the philosophers of Greece is the
  Eternal Reason, and in the New Testament the Father of Men&mdash;even as one
  builds up from act and word and expression of the friend actually visible at
  one&rsquo;s side, an ideal of the spirit within him.</p>

  <p>In this peculiar and privileged hour, his bodily frame, as he could
  recognise, although just then, in the whole sum of its capacities, so
  entirely possessed by him&mdash;Nay! actually his very self&mdash;was yet
  determined by a far-reaching system of material forces external to it, a
  thousand combining currents from earth and sky. Its seemingly active powers
  of apprehension were, in fact, but susceptibilities to influence. The
  perfection of its capacity might be said to depend on its passive surrender,
  as of a leaf on the wind, to the motions of the great stream of physical
  energy without it. And might not the intellectual frame also, still [69] more
  intimately himself as in truth it was, after the analogy of the bodily life,
  be a moment only, an impulse or series of impulses, a single process, in an
  intellectual or spiritual system external to it, diffused through all time
  and place&mdash;that great stream of spiritual energy, of which his own
  imperfect thoughts, yesterday or to-day, would be but the remote, and
  therefore imperfect pulsations? It was the hypothesis (boldest, though in
  reality the most conceivable of all hypotheses) which had dawned on the
  contemplations of the two opposed great masters of the old Greek thought,
  alike:&mdash;the &ldquo;World of Ideas,&rdquo; existent only because, and in
  so far as, they are known, as Plato conceived; the &ldquo;creative,
  incorruptible, informing mind,&rdquo; supposed by Aristotle, so sober-minded,
  yet as regards this matter left something of a mystic after all. Might not
  this entire material world, the very scene around him, the immemorial rocks,
  the firm marble, the olive- gardens, the falling water, be themselves but
  reflections in, or a creation of, that one indefectible mind, wherein he too
  became conscious, for an hour, a day, for so many years? Upon what other
  hypothesis could he so well understand the persistency of all these things
  for his own intermittent consciousness of them, for the intermittent
  consciousness of so many generations, fleeting away one after another? It was
  easier to conceive of the material fabric of things as [70] but an element in
  a world of thought&mdash;as a thought in a mind, than of mind as an element,
  or accident, or passing condition in a world of matter, because mind was
  really nearer to himself: it was an explanation of what was less known by
  what was known better. The purely material world, that close, impassable
  prison-wall, seemed just then the unreal thing, to be actually dissolving
  away all around him: and he felt a quiet hope, a quiet joy dawning faintly,
  in the dawning of this doctrine upon him as a really credible opinion. It was
  like the break of day over some vast prospect with the &ldquo;new
  city,&rdquo; as it were some celestial New Rome, in the midst of it. That
  divine companion figured no longer as but an occasional wayfarer beside him;
  but rather as the unfailing &ldquo;assistant,&rdquo; without whose
  inspiration and concurrence he could not breathe or see, instrumenting his
  bodily senses, rounding, supporting his imperfect thoughts. How often had the
  thought of their brevity spoiled for him the most natural pleasures of life,
  confusing even his present sense of them by the suggestion of disease, of
  death, of a coming end, in everything! How had he longed, sometimes, that
  there were indeed one to whose boundless power of memory he could commit his
  own most fortunate moments, his admiration, his love, Ay! the very sorrows of
  which he could not bear quite to lose the sense:&mdash;one strong to retain
  them even though [71] he forgot, in whose more vigorous consciousness they
  might subsist for ever, beyond that mere quickening of capacity which was all
  that remained of them in himself! &ldquo;Oh! that they might live before
  Thee&rdquo;&mdash;To-day at least, in the peculiar clearness of one
  privileged hour, he seemed to have apprehended that in which the experiences
  he valued most might find, one by one, an abiding- place. And again, the
  resultant sense of companionship, of a person beside him, evoked the faculty
  ofconscience&mdash;of conscience, as of old and when he had been at his best,
  in the form, not of fear, nor of self-reproach even, but of a certain lively
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>Himself&mdash;his sensations and ideas&mdash;never fell again precisely
  into focus as on that day, yet he was the richer by its experience. But for
  once only to have come under the power of that peculiar mood, to have felt
  the train of reflections which belong to it really forcible and conclusive,
  to have been led by them to a conclusion, to have apprehended the Great
  Ideal, so palpably that it defined personal gratitude and the sense of a
  friendly hand laid upon him amid the shadows of the world, left this one
  particular hour a marked point in life never to be forgotten. It gave him a
  definitely ascertained measure of his moral or intellectual need, of the
  demand his soul must make upon the powers, whatsoever they might be, which
  [72] had brought him, as he was, into the world at all. And again, would he
  be faithful to himself, to his own habits of mind, his leading suppositions,
  if he did but remain just there? Must not all that remained of life be but a
  search for the equivalent of that Ideal, among so-called actual
  things&mdash;a gathering together of every trace or token of it, which his
  actual experience might present?</p>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>&ldquo;Your old men shall dream
  dreams&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Joel 2.28.</small></p>

  <p class="first">[75] A NATURE like that of Marius, composed, in about equal
  parts, of instincts almost physical, and of slowly accumulated intellectual
  judgments, was perhaps even less susceptible than other men&rsquo;s
  characters of essential change. And yet the experience of that fortunate
  hour, seeming to gather into one central act of vision all the deeper
  impressions his mind had ever received, did not leave him quite as he had
  been. For his mental view, at least, it changed measurably the world about
  him, of which he was still indeed a curious spectator, but which looked
  further off, was weaker in its hold, and, in a sense, less real to him than
  ever. It was as if he viewed it through a diminishing glass. And the
  permanency of this change he could note, some years later, when it [76]
  happened that he was a guest at a feast, in which the various exciting
  elements of Roman life, its physical and intellectual accomplishments, its
  frivolity and far-fetched elegances, its strange, mystic essays after the
  unseen, were elaborately combined. The great Apuleius, the literary ideal of
  his boyhood, had arrived in Rome,&mdash;was now visiting Tusculum, at the
  house of their common friend, a certain aristocratic poet who loved every
  sort of superiorities; and Marius was favoured with an invitation to a supper
  given in his honour.</p>

  <p>It was with a feeling of half-humorous concession to his own early boyish
  hero-worship, yet with some sense of superiority in himself, seeing his old
  curiosity grown now almost to indifference when on the point of satisfaction
  at last, and upon a juster estimate of its object, that he mounted to the
  little town on the hillside, the foot-ways of which were so many flights of
  easy-going steps gathered round a single great house under shadow of the
  &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; ruins of Cicero&rsquo;s villa on the wooded heights. He
  found a touch of weirdness in the circumstance that in so romantic a place he
  had been bidden to meet the writer who was come to seem almost like one of
  the personages in his own fiction. As he turned now and then to gaze at the
  evening scene through the tall narrow openings of the street, up which the
  cattle were going home slowly from the [77] pastures below, the Alban
  mountains, stretched between the great walls of the ancient houses, seemed
  close at hand&mdash;a screen of vaporous dun purple against the setting
  sun&mdash;with those waves of surpassing softness in the boundary lines which
  indicate volcanic formation. The coolness of the little brown market- place,
  for profit of which even the working-people, in long file through the
  olive-gardens, were leaving the plain for the night, was grateful, after the
  heats of Rome. Those wild country figures, clad in every kind of fantastic
  patchwork, stained by wind and weather fortunately enough for the eye, under
  that significant light inclined him to poetry. And it was a very delicate
  poetry of its kind that seemed to enfold him, as passing into the
  poet&rsquo;s house he paused for a moment to glance back towards the heights
  above; whereupon, the numerous cascades of the precipitous garden of the
  villa, framed in the doorway of the hall, fell into a harmless picture, in
  its place among the pictures within, and scarcely more real than they&mdash;a
  landscape- piece, in which the power of water (plunging into what unseen
  depths!) done to the life, was pleasant, and without its natural terrors.</p>

  <p>At the further end of this bland apartment, fragrant with the rare woods
  of the old inlaid panelling, the falling of aromatic oil from the
  ready-lighted lamps, the iris-root clinging to the dresses of the guests, as
  with odours from the [78] altars of the gods, the supper-table was spread, in
  all the daintiness characteristic of the agreeable petit-maitre, who
  entertained. He was already most carefully dressed, but, like Martial&rsquo;s
  Stella, perhaps consciously, meant to change his attire once and again during
  the banquet; in the last instance, for an ancient vesture (object of much
  rivalry among the young men of fashion, at that great sale of the imperial
  wardrobes) a toga, of altogether lost hue and texture. He wore it with a
  grace which became the leader of a thrilling movement then on foot for the
  restoration of that disused garment, in which, laying aside the customary
  evening dress, all the visitors were requested to appear, setting off the
  delicate sinuosities and well-disposed &ldquo;golden ways&rdquo; of its
  folds, with harmoniously tinted flowers. The opulent sunset, blending
  pleasantly with artificial light, fell across the quiet ancestral effigies of
  old consular dignitaries, along the wide floor strewn with sawdust of
  sandal-wood, and lost itself in the heap of cool coronals, lying ready for
  the foreheads of the guests on a sideboard of old citron. The crystal vessels
  darkened with old wine, the hues of the early autumn fruit&mdash;mulberries,
  pomegranates, and grapes that had long been hanging under careful protection
  upon the vines, were almost as much a feast for the eye, as the dusky fires
  of the rare twelve-petalled roses. A favourite animal, white as snow, brought
  by one of the visitors, purred its way [79] gracefully among the wine-cups,
  coaxed onward from place to place by those at table, as they reclined easily
  on their cushions of German eider-down, spread over the long-legged, carved
  couches.</p>

  <p>A highly refined modification of the acroama&mdash;a musical performance
  during supper for the diversion of the guests&mdash;was presently heard
  hovering round the place, soothingly, and so unobtrusively that the company
  could not guess, and did not like to ask, whether or not it had been designed
  by their entertainer. They inclined on the whole to think it some wonderful
  peasant-music peculiar to that wild neighbourhood, turning, as it did now and
  then, to a solitary reed-note, like a bird&rsquo;s, while it wandered into
  the distance. It wandered quite away at last, as darkness with a bolder
  lamplight came on, and made way for another sort of entertainment. An odd,
  rapid, phantasmal glitter, advancing from the garden by torchlight, defined
  itself, as it came nearer, into a dance of young men in armour. Arrived at
  length in a portico, open to the supper-chamber, they contrived that their
  mechanical march- movement should fall out into a kind of highly expressive
  dramatic action; and with the utmost possible emphasis of dumb motion, their
  long swords weaving a silvery network in the air, they danced the Death of
  Paris. The young Commodus, already an adept in these matters, who had
  condescended to [80] welcome the eminent Apuleius at the banquet, had
  mysteriously dropped from his place to take his share in the performance; and
  at its conclusion reappeared, still wearing the dainty accoutrements of
  Paris, including a breastplate, composed entirely of overlapping
  tigers&rsquo; claws, skilfully gilt. The youthful prince had lately assumed
  the dress of manhood, on the return of the emperor for a brief visit from the
  North; putting up his hair, in imitation of Nero, in a golden box dedicated
  to Capitoline Jupiter. His likeness to Aurelius, his father, was become, in
  consequence, more striking than ever; and he had one source of genuine
  interest in the great literary guest of the occasion, in that the latter was
  the fortunate possessor of a monopoly for the exhibition of wild beasts and
  gladiatorial shows in the province of Carthage, where he resided.</p>

  <p>Still, after all complaisance to the perhaps somewhat crude tastes of the
  emperor&rsquo;s son, it was felt that with a guest like Apuleius whom they
  had come prepared to entertain as veritable connoisseurs, the conversation
  should be learned and superior, and the host at last deftly led his company
  round to literature, by the way of bindings. Elegant rolls of manuscript from
  his fine library of ancient Greek books passed from hand to hand about the
  table. It was a sign for the visitors themselves to draw their own choicest
  literary curiosities from their bags, as their contribution to the banquet;
  and one of them, a [81] famous reader, choosing his lucky moment, delivered
  in tenor voice the piece which follows, with a preliminary query as to
  whether it could indeed be the composition of Lucian of Samosata
  (<i>Halcyon</i>), understood to be the great mocker of that day:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What sound was that, Socrates?&rdquo; asked Chaerephon. &ldquo;It
  came from the beach under the cliff yonder, and seemed a long way
  off.&mdash;And how melodious it was! Was it a bird, I wonder. I thought all
  sea- birds were songless.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye! a sea-bird,&rdquo; answered Socrates, &ldquo;a bird called the
  Halcyon, and has a note full of plaining and tears. There is an old story
  people tell of it. It was a mortal woman once, daughter of Aeolus, god of the
  winds. Ceyx, the son of the morning-star, wedded her in her early maidenhood.
  The son was not less fair than the father; and when it came to pass that he
  died, the crying of the girl as she lamented his sweet usage, was, Just that!
  And some while after, as Heaven willed, she was changed into a bird. Floating
  now on bird&rsquo;s wings over the sea she seeks her lost Ceyx there; since
  she was not able to find him after long wandering over the land.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That then is the Halcyon&mdash;the kingfisher,&rdquo; said
  Chaerephon. &ldquo;I never heard a bird like it before. It has truly a
  plaintive note. What kind of a bird is it, Socrates?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a large bird, though she has received [82] large honour from
  the gods on account of her singular conjugal affection. For whensoever she
  makes her nest, a law of nature brings round what is called Halcyon&rsquo;s
  weather,&mdash;days distinguishable among all others for their serenity,
  though they come sometimes amid the storms of winter&mdash;days like to- day!
  See how transparent is the sky above us, and how motionless the
  sea!&mdash;like a smooth mirror.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>True! A Halcyon day, indeed! and yesterday was the same. But tell me,
  Socrates, what is one to think of those stories which have been told from the
  beginning, of birds changed into mortals and mortals into birds? To me
  nothing seems more incredible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Chaerephon,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;methinks we are but
  half-blind judges of the impossible and the possible. We try the question by
  the standard of our human faculty, which avails neither for true knowledge,
  nor for faith, nor vision. Therefore many things seem to us impossible which
  are really easy, many things unattainable which are within our reach; partly
  through inexperience, partly through the childishness of our minds. For in
  truth, every man, even the oldest of us, is like a little child, so brief and
  babyish are the years of our life in comparison of eternity. Then, how can
  we, who comprehend not the faculties of gods and of the heavenly host, tell
  whether aught of that kind be possible or no?&mdash;What a tempest you saw
  [83] three days ago! One trembles but to think of the lightning, the
  thunderclaps, the violence of the wind! You might have thought the whole
  world was going to ruin. And then, after a little, came this wonderful
  serenity of weather, which has continued till to-day. Which do you think the
  greater and more difficult thing to do: to exchange the disorder of that
  irresistible whirlwind to a clarity like this, and becalm the whole world
  again, or to refashion the form of a woman into that of a bird? We can teach
  even little children to do something of that sort,&mdash;to take wax or clay,
  and mould out of the same material many kinds of form, one after another,
  without difficulty. And it may be that to the Deity, whose power is too vast
  for comparison with ours, all processes of that kind are manageable and easy.
  How much wider is the whole circle of heaven than thyself?&mdash;Wider than
  thou canst express.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Among ourselves also, how vast the difference we may observe in
  men&rsquo;s degrees of power! To you and me, and many another like us, many
  things are impossible which are quite easy to others. For those who are
  unmusical, to play on the flute; to read or write, for those who have not yet
  learned; is no easier than to make birds of women, or women of birds. From
  the dumb and lifeless egg Nature moulds her swarms of winged creatures,
  aided, as some will have it, by a divine and secret [84] art in the wide air
  around us. She takes from the honeycomb a little memberless live thing; she
  brings it wings and feet, brightens and beautifies it with quaint variety of
  colour:&mdash;and Lo! the bee in her wisdom, making honey worthy of the
  gods.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It follows, that we mortals, being altogether of little account,
  able wholly to discern no great matter, sometimes not even a little one, for
  the most part at a loss regarding what happens even with ourselves, may
  hardly speak with security as to what may be the powers of the immortal gods
  concerning Kingfisher, or Nightingale. Yet the glory of thy mythus, as my
  fathers bequeathed it to me, O tearful songstress! that will I too hand on to
  my children, and tell it often to my wives, Xanthippe and Myrto:&mdash;the
  story of thy pious love to Ceyx, and of thy melodious hymns; and, above all,
  of the honour thou hast with the gods!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The reader&rsquo;s well-turned periods seemed to stimulate, almost
  uncontrollably, the eloquent stirrings of the eminent man of letters then
  present. The impulse to speak masterfully was visible, before the recital was
  well over, in the moving lines about his mouth, by no means designed, as
  detractors were wont to say, simply to display the beauty of his teeth. One
  of the company, expert in his humours, made ready to transcribe what he would
  say, the sort of [85] things of which a collection was then forming, the
  &ldquo;Florida&rdquo; or Flowers, so to call them, he was apt to let fall by
  the way&mdash;no impromptu ventures at random; but rather elaborate, carved
  ivories of speech, drawn, at length, out of the rich treasure-house of a
  memory stored with such, and as with a fine savour of old musk about them.
  Certainly in this case, as Marius thought, it was worth while to hear a
  charming writer speak. Discussing, quite in our modern way, the peculiarities
  of those suburban views, especially the sea-views, of which he was a
  professed lover, he was also every inch a priest of Aesculapius, patronal god
  of Carthage. There was a piquancy in his rococo, very African, and as it were
  perfumed personality, though he was now well-nigh sixty years old, a mixture
  there of that sort of Platonic spiritualism which can speak of the soul of
  man as but a sojourner m the prison of the body&mdash;a blending of that with
  such a relish for merely bodily graces as availed to set the fashion in
  matters of dress, deportment, accent, and the like, nay! with something also
  which reminded Marius of the vein of coarseness he had found in the
  &ldquo;Golden Book.&rdquo; All this made the total impression he conveyed a
  very uncommon one. Marius did not wonder, as he watched him speaking, that
  people freely attributed to him many of the marvellous adventures he had
  recounted in that famous romance, [86] over and above the wildest version of
  his own actual story&mdash;his extraordinary marriage, his religious
  initiations, his acts of mad generosity, his trial as a sorcerer.</p>

  <p>But a sign came from the imperial prince that it was time for the company
  to separate. He was entertaining his immediate neighbours at the table with a
  trick from the streets; tossing his olives in rapid succession into the air,
  and catching them, as they fell, between his lips. His dexterity in this
  performance made the mirth around him noisy, disturbing the sleep of the
  furry visitor: the learned party broke up; and Marius withdrew, glad to
  escape into the open air. The courtesans in their large wigs of false blond
  hair, were lurking for the guests, with groups of curious idlers. A great
  conflagration was visible in the distance. Was it in Rome; or in one of the
  villages of the country? Pausing for a few minutes on the terrace to watch
  it, Marius was for the first time able to converse intimately with Apuleius;
  and in this moment of confidence the &ldquo;illuminist,&rdquo; himself with
  locks so carefully arranged, and seemingly so full of affectations, almost
  like one of those light women there, dropped a veil as it were, and appeared,
  though still permitting the play of a certain element of theatrical interest
  in his bizarre tenets, to be ready to explain and defend his position
  reasonably. For a moment his fantastic foppishness and his pretensions to
  ideal [87] vision seemed to fall into some intelligible congruity with each
  other. In truth, it was the Platonic Idealism, as he conceived it, which for
  him literally animated, and gave him so lively an interest in, this world of
  the purely outward aspects of men and things.&mdash;Did material things, such
  things as they had had around them all that evening, really need apology for
  being there, to interest one, at all? Were not all visible objects&mdash;the
  whole material world indeed, according to the consistent testimony of
  philosophy in many forms&mdash;&ldquo;full of souls&rdquo;? embarrassed
  perhaps, partly imprisoned, but still eloquent souls? Certainly, the
  contemplative philosophy of Plato, with its figurative imagery and apologue,
  its manifold aesthetic colouring, its measured eloquence, its music for the
  outward ear, had been, like Plato&rsquo;s old master himself, a two-sided or
  two-coloured thing. Apuleius was a Platonist: only, for him, the Ideas of
  Plato were no creatures of logical abstraction, but in very truth informing
  souls, in every type and variety of sensible things. Those noises in the
  house all supper-time, sounding through the tables and along the
  walls:&mdash;were they only startings in the old rafters, at the impact of
  the music and laughter; or rather importunities of the secondary selves, the
  true unseen selves, of the persons, nay! of the very things around, essaying
  to break through their frivolous, merely transitory surfaces, to remind one
  of abiding essentials beyond them, [88] which might have their say, their
  judgment to give, by and by, when the shifting of the meats and drinks at
  life&rsquo;s table would be over? And was not this the true significance of
  the Platonic doctrine?&mdash;a hierarchy of divine beings, associating
  themselves with particular things and places, for the purpose of mediating
  between God and man&mdash;man, who does but need due attention on his part to
  become aware of his celestial company, filling the air about him, thick as
  motes in the sunbeam, for the glance of sympathetic intelligence he casts
  through it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two kinds there are, of animated beings,&rdquo; he exclaimed:
  &ldquo;Gods, entirely differing from men in the infinite distance of their
  abode, since one part of them only is seen by our blunted vision&mdash;those
  mysterious stars!&mdash;in the eternity of their existence, in the perfection
  of their nature, infected by no contact with ourselves: and men, dwelling on
  the earth, with frivolous and anxious minds, with infirm and mortal members,
  with variable fortunes; labouring in vain; taken altogether and in their
  whole species perhaps, eternal; but, severally, quitting the scene in
  irresistible succession.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What then? Has nature connected itself together by no bond, allowed
  itself to be thus crippled, and split into the divine and human elements? And
  you will say to me: If so it be, that man is thus entirely exiled from the
  immortal gods, that all communication is denied [89] him, that not one of
  them occasionally visits us, as a shepherd his sheep&mdash;to whom shall I
  address my prayers? Whom, shall I invoke as the helper of the unfortunate,
  the protector of the good?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well! there are certain divine powers of a middle nature, through
  whom our aspirations are conveyed to the gods, and theirs to us. Passing
  between the inhabitants of earth and heaven, they carry from one to the other
  prayers and bounties, supplication and assistance, being a kind of
  interpreters. This interval of the air is full of them! Through them, all
  revelations, miracles, magic processes, are effected. For, specially
  appointed members of this order have their special provinces, with a ministry
  according to the disposition of each. They go to and fro without fixed
  habitation: or dwell in men&rsquo;s houses&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Just then a companion&rsquo;s hand laid in the darkness on the shoulder of
  the speaker carried him away, and the discourse broke off suddenly. Its
  singular intimations, however, were sufficient to throw back on this strange
  evening, in all its detail&mdash;the dance, the readings, the distant
  fire&mdash;a kind of allegoric expression: gave it the character of one of
  those famous Platonic figures or apologues which had then been in fact under
  discussion. When Marius recalled its circumstances he seemed to hear once
  more that voice of genuine conviction, pleading, from amidst a [90] scene at
  best of elegant frivolity, for so boldly mystical a view of man and his
  position in the world. For a moment, but only for a moment, as he listened,
  the trees had seemed, as of old, to be growing &ldquo;close against the
  sky.&rdquo; Yes! the reception of theory, of hypothesis, of beliefs, did
  depend a great deal on temperament. They were, so to speak, mere equivalents
  of temperament. A celestial ladder, a ladder from heaven to earth: that was
  the assumption which the experience of Apuleius had suggested to him: it was
  what, in different forms, certain persons in every age had instinctively
  supposed: they would be glad to find their supposition accredited by the
  authority of a grave philosophy. Marius, however, yearning not less than
  they, in that hard world of Rome, and below its unpeopled sky, for the trace
  of some celestial wing across it, must still object that they assumed the
  thing with too much facility, too much of self-complacency. And his second
  thought was, that to indulge but for an hour fantasies, fantastic visions of
  that sort, only left the actual world more lonely than ever. For him
  certainly, and for his solace, the little godship for whom the rude
  countryman, an unconscious Platonist, trimmed his twinkling lamp, would never
  slip from the bark of these immemorial olive- trees.&mdash;No! not even in
  the wildest moonlight. For himself, it was clear, he must still hold by what
  his eyes really saw. Only, he had to concede also, that [91] the very
  boldness of such theory bore witness, at least, to a variety of human
  disposition and a consequent variety of mental view, which might&mdash;who
  can tell?&mdash;be correspondent to, be defined by and define, varieties of
  facts, of truths, just &ldquo;behind the veil,&rdquo; regarding the world all
  alike had actually before them as their original premiss or starting-point; a
  world, wider, perhaps, in its possibilities than all possible fancies
  concerning it.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>XXI. &mdash; TWO CURIOUS HOUSES&mdash;<br>
  II. THE CHURCH IN CECILIA&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>&ldquo;Your old men shall dream dreams, and your
  young men shall see visions&rdquo;</i></small></p>

  <p class="first">[92] CORNELIUS had certain friends in or near Rome, whose
  household, to Marius, as he pondered now and again what might be the
  determining influences of that peculiar character, presented itself as
  possibly its main secret&mdash;the hidden source from which the beauty and
  strength of a nature, so persistently fresh in the midst of a somewhat jaded
  world, might be derived. But Marius had never yet seen these friends; and it
  was almost by accident that the veil of reserve was at last lifted, and, with
  strange contrast to his visit to the poet&rsquo;s villa at Tusculum, he
  entered another curious house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The house in which she lives,&rdquo; says that mystical German
  writer quoted once before, &ldquo;is for the orderly soul, which does not
  live on [93] blindly before her, but is ever, out of her passing experiences,
  building and adorning the parts of a many-roomed abode for herself, only an
  expansion of the body; as the body, according to the philosophy of
  Swedenborg, is but a process, an expansion, of the soul. For such an orderly
  soul, as life proceeds, all sorts of delicate affinities establish
  themselves, between herself and the doors and passage-ways, the lights and
  shadows, of her outward dwelling-place, until she may seem incorporate with
  it&mdash;until at last, in the entire expressiveness of what is outward,
  there is for her, to speak properly, between outward and inward, no longer
  any distinction at all; and the light which creeps at a particular hour on a
  particular picture or space upon the wall, the scent of flowers in the air at
  a particular window, become to her, not so much apprehended objects, as
  themselves powers of apprehension and door-ways to things beyond&mdash;the
  germ or rudiment of certain new faculties, by which she, dimly yet surely,
  apprehends a matter lying beyond her actually attained capacities of spirit
  and sense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So it must needs be in a world which is itself, we may think, together
  with that bodily &ldquo;tent&rdquo; or &ldquo;tabernacle,&rdquo; only one of
  many vestures for the clothing of the pilgrim soul, to be left by her,
  surely, as if on the wayside, worn-out one by one, as it was from her,
  indeed, they borrowed what momentary value or significance they had.</p>

  <p>[94] The two friends were returning to Rome from a visit to a country-
  house, where again a mixed company of guests had been assembled; Marius, for
  his part, a little weary of gossip, and those sparks of ill-tempered rivalry,
  which would seem sometimes to be the only sort of fire the intercourse of
  people in general society can strike out of them. A mere reaction upon this,
  as they started in the clear morning, made their companionship, at least for
  one of them, hardly less tranquillising than the solitude he so much valued.
  Something in the south-west wind, combining with their own intention,
  favoured increasingly, as the hours wore on, a serenity like that Marius had
  felt once before in journeying over the great plain towards Tibur&mdash;a
  serenity that was to-day brotherly amity also, and seemed to draw into its
  own charmed circle whatever was then present to eye or ear, while they talked
  or were silent together, and all petty irritations, and the like, shrank out
  of existence, or kept certainly beyond its limits. The natural fatigue of the
  long journey overcame them quite suddenly at last, when they were still about
  two miles distant from Rome. The seemingly endless line of tombs and
  cypresses had been visible for hours against the sky towards the west; and it
  was just where a cross-road from the Latin Way fell into the Appian, that
  Cornelius halted at a doorway in a long, low wall&mdash;the outer wall of
  some villa courtyard, it might be supposed&mdash;[95] as if at liberty to
  enter, and rest there awhile. He held the door open for his companion to
  enter also, if he would; with an expression, as he lifted the latch, which
  seemed to ask Marius, apparently shrinking from a possible intrusion:
  &ldquo;Would you like to see it?&rdquo; Was he willing to look upon that, the
  seeing of which might define&mdash;yes! define the critical turning-point in
  his days?</p>

  <p>The little doorway in this long, low wall admitted them, in fact, into the
  court or garden of a villa, disposed in one of those abrupt natural hollows,
  which give its character to the country in this place; the house itself, with
  all its dependent buildings, the spaciousness of which surprised Marius as he
  entered, being thus wholly concealed from passengers along the road. All
  around, in those well-ordered precincts, were the quiet signs of wealth, and
  of a noble taste&mdash;a taste, indeed, chiefly evidenced in the selection
  and juxtaposition of the material it had to deal with, consisting almost
  exclusively of the remains of older art, here arranged and harmonised, with
  effects, both as regards colour and form, so delicate as to seem really
  derivative from some finer intelligence in these matters than lay within the
  resources of the ancient world. It was the old way of true
  Renaissance&mdash;being indeed the way of nature with her roses, the divine
  way with the body of man, perhaps with his soul&mdash;conceiving the new
  organism by no sudden and [96] abrupt creation, but rather by the action of a
  new principle upon elements, all of which had in truth already lived and died
  many times. The fragments of older architecture, the mosaics, the spiral
  columns, the precious corner-stones of immemorial building, had put on, by
  such juxtaposition, a new and singular expressiveness, an air of grave
  thought, of an intellectual purpose, in itself, aesthetically, very
  seductive. Lastly, herb and tree had taken possession, spreading their
  seed-bells and light branches, just astir in the trembling air, above the
  ancient garden-wall, against the wide realms of sunset. And from the first
  they could hear singing, the singing of children mainly, it would seem, and
  of a new kind; so novel indeed in its effect, as to bring suddenly to the
  recollection of Marius, Flavian&rsquo;s early essays towards a new world of
  poetic sound. It was the expression not altogether of mirth, yet of some
  wonderful sort of happiness&mdash;the blithe self-expansion of a joyful soul
  in people upon whom some all-subduing experience had wrought heroically, and
  who still remembered, on this bland afternoon, the hour of a great
  deliverance.</p>

  <p>His old native susceptibility to the spirit, the special sympathies, of
  places,&mdash;above all, to any hieratic or religious significance they might
  have,&mdash;was at its liveliest, as Marius, still encompassed by that
  peculiar singing, and still amid the evidences of a grave discretion all
  around him, passed into the house. That intelligent seriousness [97] about
  life, the absence of which had ever seemed to remove those who lacked it into
  some strange species wholly alien from himself, accumulating all the lessons
  of his experience since those first days at White-nights, was as it were
  translated here, as if in designed congruity with his favourite precepts of
  the power of physical vision, into an actual picture. If the true value of
  souls is in proportion to what they can admire, Marius was just then an
  acceptable soul. As he passed through the various chambers, great and small,
  one dominant thought increased upon him, the thought of chaste women and
  their children&mdash;of all the various affections of family life under its
  most natural conditions, yet developed, as if in devout imitation of some
  sublime new type of it, into large controlling passions. There reigned
  throughout, an order and purity, an orderly disposition, as if by way of
  making ready for some gracious spousals. The place itself was like a bride
  adorned for her husband; and its singular cheerfulness, the abundant light
  everywhere, the sense of peaceful industry, of which he received a deep
  impression though without precisely reckoning wherein it resided, as he moved
  on rapidly, were in forcible contrast just at first to the place to which he
  was next conducted by Cornelius still with a sort of eager, hurried,
  half-troubled reluctance, and as if he forbore the explanation which might
  well be looked for by his companion.</p>

  <p>[98] An old flower-garden in the rear of the house, set here and there
  with a venerable olive-tree&mdash;a picture in pensive shade and fiery
  blossom, as transparent, under that afternoon light, as the old miniature-
  painters&rsquo; work on the walls of the chambers within&mdash;was bounded
  towards the west by a low, grass-grown hill. A narrow opening cut in its
  steep side, like a solid blackness there, admitted Marius and his gleaming
  leader into a hollow cavern or crypt, neither more nor less in fact than the
  family burial-place of the Cecilii, to whom this residence belonged, brought
  thus, after an arrangement then becoming not unusual, into immediate
  connexion with the abode of the living, in bold assertion of that instinct of
  family life, which the sanction of the Holy Family was, hereafter, more and
  more to reinforce. Here, in truth, was the centre of the peculiar religious
  expressiveness, of the sanctity, of the entire scene. That &ldquo;any person
  may, at his own election, constitute the place which belongs to him a
  religious place, by the carrying of his dead into it":&mdash;had been a maxim
  of old Roman law, which it was reserved for the early Christian societies,
  like that established here by the piety of a wealthy Roman matron, to realise
  in all its consequences. Yet this was certainly unlike any cemetery Marius
  had ever before seen; most obviously in this, that these people had returned
  to the older fashion of disposing of [99] their dead by burial instead of
  burning. Originally a family sepulchre, it was growing to a vast necropolis,
  a whole township of the deceased, by means of some free expansion of the
  family interest beyond its amplest natural limits. That air of venerable
  beauty which characterised the house and its precincts above, was maintained
  also here. It was certainly with a great outlay of labour that these long,
  apparently endless, yet elaborately designed galleries, were increasing so
  rapidly, with their layers of beds or berths, one above another, cut, on
  either side the path- way, in the porous tufa, through which all the moisture
  filters downwards, leaving the parts above dry and wholesome. All alike were
  carefully closed, and with all the delicate costliness at command; some with
  simple tiles of baked clay, many with slabs of marble, enriched by fair
  inscriptions: marble taken, in some cases, from older pagan tombs&mdash;the
  inscription sometimes a palimpsest, the new epitaph being woven into the
  faded letters of an earlier one.</p>

  <p>As in an ordinary Roman cemetery, an abundance of utensils for the worship
  or commemoration of the departed was disposed around&mdash;incense, lights,
  flowers, their flame or their freshness being relieved to the utmost by
  contrast with the coal-like blackness of the soil itself, a volcanic
  sandstone, cinder of burnt-out fires. Would they ever kindle
  again?&mdash;possess, transform, the place?&mdash;Turning to an [100] ashen
  pallor where, at regular intervals, an air-hole or luminare let in a hard
  beam of clear but sunless light, with the heavy sleepers, row upon row
  within, leaving a passage so narrow that only one visitor at a time could
  move along, cheek to cheek with them, the high walls seemed to shut one in
  into the great company of the dead. Only the long straight pathway lay before
  him; opening, however, here and there, into a small chamber, around a broad,
  table- like coffin or &ldquo;altar- tomb,&rdquo; adorned even more profusely
  than the rest as if for some anniversary observance. Clearly, these people,
  concurring in this with the special sympathies of Marius himself, had adopted
  the practice of burial from some peculiar feeling of hope they entertained
  concerning the body; a feeling which, in no irreverent curiosity, he would
  fain have penetrated. The complete and irreparable disappearance of the dead
  in the funeral fire, so crushing to the spirits, as he for one had found it,
  had long since induced in him a preference for that other mode of settlement
  to the last sleep, as having something about it more home-like and hopeful,
  at least in outward seeming. But whence the strange confidence that these
  &ldquo;handfuls of white dust&rdquo; would hereafter recompose themselves
  once more into exulting human creatures? By what heavenly alchemy, what
  reviving dew from above, such as was certainly never again to reach the dead
  violets?&mdash;[101] Januarius, Agapetus, Felicitas; Martyrs! refresh, I pray
  you, the soul of Cecil, of Cornelius! said an inscription, one of many,
  scratched, like a passing sigh, when it was still fresh in the mortar that
  had closed up the prison-door. All critical estimate of this bold hope, as
  sincere apparently as it was audacious in its claim, being set aside, here at
  least, carried further than ever before, was that pious, systematic
  commemoration of the dead, which, in its chivalrous refusal to forget or
  finally desert the helpless, had ever counted with Marius as the central
  exponent or symbol of all natural duty.</p>

  <p>The stern soul of the excellent Jonathan Edwards, applying the faulty
  theology of John Calvin, afforded him, we know, the vision of infants not a
  span long, on the floor of hell. Every visitor to the Catacombs must have
  observed, in a very different theological connexion, the numerous
  children&rsquo;s graves there&mdash;beds of infants, but a span long indeed,
  lowly &ldquo;prisoners of hope,&rdquo; on these sacred floors. It was with
  great curiosity, certainly, that Marius considered them, decked in some
  instances with the favourite toys of their tiny occupants&mdash;toy-
  soldiers, little chariot-wheels, the entire paraphernalia of a baby-house;
  and when he saw afterwards the living children, who sang and were busy
  above&mdash;sang their psalm Laudate Pueri Dominum!&mdash;their very faces
  caught for him a sort of quaint unreality from the memory [102] of those
  others, the children of the Catacombs, but a little way below them.</p>

  <p>Here and there, mingling with the record of merely natural decease, and
  sometimes even at these children&rsquo;s graves, were the signs of violent
  death or &ldquo;martyrdom,&rdquo;&mdash;proofs that some &ldquo;had loved not
  their lives unto the death&rdquo;&mdash;in the little red phial of blood, the
  palm-branch, the red flowers for their heavenly &ldquo;birthday.&rdquo; About
  one sepulchre in particular, distinguished in this way, and devoutly arrayed
  for what, by a bold paradox, was thus treated as, natalitia&mdash;a birthday,
  the peculiar arrangements of the whole place visibly centered. And it was
  with a singular novelty of feeling, like the dawning of a fresh order of
  experiences upon him, that, standing beside those mournful relics, snatched
  in haste from the common place of execution not many years before, Marius
  became, as by some gleam of foresight, aware of the whole force of evidence
  for a certain strange, new hope, defining in its turn some new and weighty
  motive of action, which lay in deaths so tragic for the &ldquo;Christian
  superstition.&rdquo; Something of them he had heard indeed already. They had
  seemed to him but one savagery the more, savagery self- provoked, in a cruel
  and stupid world.</p>

  <p>And yet these poignant memorials seemed also to draw him onwards to-day,
  as if towards an image of some still more pathetic suffering, [103] in the
  remote background. Yes! the interest, the expression, of the entire
  neighbourhood was instinct with it, as with the savour of some priceless
  incense. Penetrating the whole atmosphere, touching everything around with
  its peculiar sentiment, it seemed to make all this visible mortality,
  death&rsquo;s very self&mdash;Ah! lovelier than any fable of old mythology
  had ever thought to render it, in the utmost limits of fantasy; and this, in
  simple candour of feeling about a supposed fact. Peace! Pax tecum!&mdash;the
  word, the thought&mdash;was put forth everywhere, with images of hope,
  snatched sometimes from that jaded pagan world which had really afforded men
  so little of it from first to last; the various consoling images it had
  thrown off, of succour, of regeneration, of escape from the
  grave&mdash;Hercules wrestling with Death for possession of Alcestis, Orpheus
  taming the wild beasts, the Shepherd with his sheep, the Shepherd carrying
  the sick lamb upon his shoulders. Yet these imageries after all, it must be
  confessed, formed but a slight contribution to the dominant effect of
  tranquil hope there&mdash;a kind of heroic cheerfulness and grateful
  expansion of heart, as with the sense, again, of some real deliverance, which
  seemed to deepen the longer one lingered through these strange and awful
  passages. A figure, partly pagan in character, yet most frequently repeated
  of all these visible parables&mdash;the figure of one just [104] escaped from
  the sea, still clinging as for life to the shore in surprised joy, together
  with the inscription beneath it, seemed best to express the prevailing
  sentiment of the place. And it was just as he had puzzled out this
  inscription&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">I went down to the bottom of the mountains.<br>
  The earth with her bars was about me for ever:<br>
  Yet hast Thou brought up my life from corruption!</p>

  <p>&mdash;that with no feeling of suddenness or change Marius found himself
  emerging again, like a later mystic traveller through similar dark places
  &ldquo;quieted by hope,&rdquo; into the daylight.</p>

  <p>They were still within the precincts of the house, still in possession of
  that wonderful singing, although almost in the open country, with a great
  view of the Campagna before them, and the hills beyond. The orchard or
  meadow, through which their path lay, was already gray with twilight, though
  the western sky, where the greater stars were visible, was still afloat in
  crimson splendour. The colour of all earthly things seemed repressed by the
  contrast, yet with a sense of great richness lingering in their shadows. At
  that moment the voice of the singers, a &ldquo;voice of joy and
  health,&rdquo; concentrated itself with solemn antistrophic movement, into an
  evening, or &ldquo;candle&rdquo; hymn.</p>

  <p class="poem">&ldquo;Hail! Heavenly Light, from his pure glory poured,<br>
  Who is the Almighty Father, heavenly, blest:&mdash;<br>
  Worthiest art Thou, at all times to be sung<br>
  With undefiled tongue.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>[105] It was like the evening itself made audible, its hopes and fears,
  with the stars shining in the midst of it. Half above, half below the level
  white mist, dividing the light from the darkness, came now the mistress of
  this place, the wealthy Roman matron, left early a widow a few years before,
  by Cecilius &ldquo;Confessor and Saint.&rdquo; With a certain antique
  severity in the gathering of the long mantle, and with coif or veil folded
  decorously below the chin, &ldquo;gray within gray,&rdquo; to the mind of
  Marius her temperate beauty brought reminiscences of the serious and virile
  character of the best female statuary of Greece. Quite foreign, however, to
  any Greek statuary was the expression of pathetic care, with which she
  carried a little child at rest in her arms. Another, a year or two older,
  walked beside, the fingers of one hand within her girdle. She paused for a
  moment with a greeting for Cornelius.</p>

  <p>That visionary scene was the close, the fitting close, of the
  afternoon&rsquo;s strange experiences. A few minutes later, passing forward
  on his way along the public road, he could have fancied it a dream. The house
  of Cecilia grouped itself beside that other curious house he had lately
  visited at Tusculum. And what a contrast was presented by the former, in its
  suggestions of hopeful industry, of immaculate cleanness, of responsive
  affection!&mdash;all alike determined by that transporting discovery of some
  fact, or series [106] of facts, in which the old puzzle of life had found its
  solution. In truth, one of his most characteristic and constant traits had
  ever been a certain longing for escape&mdash;for some sudden, relieving
  interchange, across the very spaces of life, it might be, along which he had
  lingered most pleasantly&mdash;for a lifting, from time to time, of the
  actual horizon. It was like the necessity under which the painter finds
  himself, to set a window or open doorway in the background of his picture; or
  like a sick man&rsquo;s longing for northern coolness, and the whispering
  willow-trees, amid the breathless evergreen forests of the south. To some
  such effect had this visit occurred to him, and through so slight an
  accident. Rome and Roman life, just then, were come to seem like some
  stifling forest of bronze-work, transformed, as if by malign enchantment, out
  of the generations of living trees, yet with roots in a deep, down-trodden
  soil of poignant human susceptibilities. In the midst of its suffocation,
  that old longing for escape had been satisfied by this vision of the church
  in Cecilia&rsquo;s house, as never before. It was still, indeed, according to
  the unchangeable law of his temperament, to the eye, to the visual faculty of
  mind, that those experiences appealed&mdash;the peaceful light and shade, the
  boys whose very faces seemed to sing, the virginal beauty of the mother and
  her children. But, in his case, what was thus visible constituted a moral
  [107] or spiritual influence, of a somewhat exigent and controlling
  character, added anew to life, a new element therein, with which,
  consistently with his own chosen maxim, he must make terms.</p>

  <p>The thirst for every kind of experience, encouraged by a philosophy which
  taught that nothing was intrinsically great or small, good or evil, had ever
  been at strife in him with a hieratic refinement, in which the boy-priest
  survived, prompting always the selection of what was perfect of its kind,
  with subsequent loyal adherence of his soul thereto. This had carried him
  along in a continuous communion with ideals, certainly realised in part,
  either in the conditions of his own being, or in the actual company about
  him, above all, in Cornelius. Surely, in this strange new society he had
  touched upon for the first time to-day&mdash;in this strange family, like
  &ldquo;a garden enclosed&rdquo;&mdash;was the fulfilment of all the
  preferences, the judgments, of that half-understood friend, which of late
  years had been his protection so often amid the perplexities of life. Here,
  it might be, was, if not the cure, yet the solace or anodyne of his great
  sorrows&mdash;of that constitutional sorrowfulness, not peculiar to himself
  perhaps, but which had made his life certainly like one long &ldquo;disease
  of the spirit.&rdquo; Merciful intention made itself known remedially here,
  in the mere contact of the air, like a soft touch upon aching [108] flesh. On
  the other hand, he was aware that new responsibilities also might be
  awakened&mdash;new and untried responsibilities&mdash;a demand for something
  from him in return. Might this new vision, like the malignant beauty of pagan
  Medusa, be exclusive of any admiring gaze upon anything but itself? At least
  he suspected that, after the beholding of it, he could never again be
  altogether as he had been before.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>XXII. &mdash; &ldquo;THE MINOR PEACE OF THE
     CHURCH&rdquo;</h2>

  <p class="first">[109] FAITHFUL to the spirit of his early Epicurean
  philosophy and the impulse to surrender himself, in perfectly liberal inquiry
  about it, to anything that, as a matter of fact, attracted or impressed him
  strongly, Marius informed himself with much pains concerning the church in
  Cecilia&rsquo;s house; inclining at first to explain the peculiarities of
  that place by the establishment there of the schola or common hall of one of
  those burial-guilds, which then covered so much of the unofficial, and, as it
  might be called, subterranean enterprise of Roman society.</p>

  <p>And what he found, thus looking, literally, for the dead among the living,
  was the vision of a natural, a scrupulously natural, love, transforming, by
  some new gift of insight into the truth of human relationships, and under the
  urgency of some new motive by him so far unfathomable, all the conditions of
  life. He saw, in all its primitive freshness and amid the lively facts of its
  actual coming into the world, as a reality of [110] experience, that
  regenerate type of humanity, which, centuries later, Giotto and his
  successors, down to the best and purest days of the young Raphael, working
  under conditions very friendly to the imagination, were to conceive as an
  artistic ideal. He felt there, felt amid the stirring of some wonderful new
  hope within himself, the genius, the unique power of Christianity; in
  exercise then, as it has been exercised ever since, in spite of many
  hindrances, and under the most inopportune circumstances. Chastity,&mdash;as
  he seemed to understand&mdash;the chastity of men and women, amid all the
  conditions, and with the results, proper to such chastity, is the most
  beautiful thing in the world and the truest conservation of that creative
  energy by which men and women were first brought into it. The nature of the
  family, for which the better genius of old Rome itself had sincerely cared,
  of the family and its appropriate affections&mdash;all that love of
  one&rsquo;s kindred by which obviously one does triumph in some degree over
  death&mdash;had never been so felt before. Here, surely! in its genial
  warmth, its jealous exclusion of all that was opposed to it, to its own
  immaculate naturalness, in the hedge set around the sacred thing on every
  side, this development of the family did but carry forward, and give effect
  to, the purposes, the kindness, of nature itself, friendly to man. As if by
  way of a due recognition of some immeasurable divine condescension manifest
  in a [111] certain historic fact, its influence was felt more especially at
  those points which demanded some sacrifice of one&rsquo;s self, for the weak,
  for the aged, for little children, and even for the dead. And then, for its
  constant outward token, its significant manner or index, it issued in a
  certain debonair grace, and a certain mystic attractiveness, a courtesy,
  which made Marius doubt whether that famed Greek &ldquo;blitheness,&rdquo; or
  gaiety, or grace, in the handling of life, had been, after all, an unrivalled
  success. Contrasting with the incurable insipidity even of what was most
  exquisite in the higher Roman life, of what was still truest to the primitive
  soul of goodness amid its evil, the new creation he now looked on&mdash;as it
  were a picture beyond the craft of any master of old pagan beauty&mdash;had
  indeed all the appropriate freshness of a &ldquo;bride adorned for her
  husband.&rdquo; Things new and old seemed to be coming as if out of some
  goodly treasure-house, the brain full of science, the heart rich with various
  sentiment, possessing withal this surprising healthfulness, this reality of
  heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would hardly believe,&rdquo; writes Pliny,&mdash;to his own
  wife!&mdash;&ldquo;what a longing for you possesses me. Habit&mdash;that we
  have not been used to be apart&mdash;adds herein to the primary force of
  affection. It is this keeps me awake at night fancying I see you beside me.
  That is why my feet take me unconsciously to your sitting- room at those
  hours when I was wont to [112] visit you there. That is why I turn from the
  door of the empty chamber, sad and ill-at-ease, like an excluded
  lover.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>There, is a real idyll from that family life, the protection of which had
  been the motive of so large a part of the religion of the Romans, still
  surviving among them; as it survived also in Aurelius, his disposition and
  aims, and, spite of slanderous tongues, in the attained sweetness of his
  interior life. What Marius had been permitted to see was a realisation of
  such life higher still: and with&mdash;Yes! with a more effective sanction
  and motive than it had ever possessed before, in that fact, or series of
  facts, to be ascertained by those who would.</p>

  <p>The central glory of the reign of the Antonines was that society had
  attained in it, though very imperfectly, and for the most part by cumbrous
  effort of law, many of those ends to which Christianity went straight, with
  the sufficiency, the success, of a direct and appropriate instinct. Pagan
  Rome, too, had its touching charity-sermons on occasions of great public
  distress; its charity-children in long file, in memory of the elder empress
  Faustina; its prototype, under patronage of Aesculapius, of the modern
  hospital for the sick on the island of Saint Bartholomew. But what pagan
  charity was doing tardily, and as if with the painful calculation of old age,
  the church was doing, almost without thinking about it, with all the liberal
  [113] enterprise of youth, because it was her very being thus to do.
  &ldquo;You fail to realise your own good intentions,&rdquo; she seems to say,
  to pagan virtue, pagan kindness. She identified herself with those intentions
  and advanced them with an unparalleled freedom and largeness. The gentle
  Seneca would have reverent burial provided even for the dead body of a
  criminal. Yet when a certain woman collected for interment the insulted
  remains of Nero, the pagan world surmised that she must be a Christian: only
  a Christian would have been likely to conceive so chivalrous a devotion
  towards mere wretchedness. &ldquo;We refuse to be witnesses even of a
  homicide commanded by the law,&rdquo; boasts the dainty conscience of a
  Christian apologist, &ldquo;we take no part in your cruel sports nor in the
  spectacles of the amphitheatre, and we hold that to witness a murder is the
  same thing as to commit one.&rdquo; And there was another duty almost
  forgotten, the sense of which Rousseau brought back to the degenerate society
  of a later age. In an impassioned discourse the sophist Favorinus counsels
  mothers to suckle their own infants; and there are Roman epitaphs erected to
  mothers, which gratefully record this proof of natural affection as a thing
  then unusual. In this matter too, what a sanction, what a provocative to
  natural duty, lay in that image discovered to Augustus by the Tiburtine
  Sibyl, amid the aurora of a new age, the image of the Divine Mother and the
  [114] Child, just then rising upon the world like the dawn!</p>

  <p>Christian belief, again, had presented itself as a great inspirer of
  chastity. Chastity, in turn, realised in the whole scope of its conditions,
  fortified that rehabilitation of peaceful labour, after the mind, the
  pattern, of the workman of Galilee, which was another of the natural
  instincts of the catholic church, as being indeed the long-desired initiator
  of a religion of cheerfulness, as a true lover of the industry&mdash;so to
  term it&mdash;the labour, the creation, of God.</p>

  <p>And this severe yet genial assertion of the ideal of woman, of the family,
  of industry, of man&rsquo;s work in life, so close to the truth of nature,
  was also, in that charmed hour of the minor &ldquo;Peace of the
  church,&rdquo; realised as an influence tending to beauty, to the adornment
  of life and the world. The sword in the world, the right eye plucked out, the
  right hand cut off, the spirit of reproach which those images express, and of
  which monasticism is the fulfilment, reflect one side only of the nature of
  the divine missionary of the New Testament. Opposed to, yet blent with, this
  ascetic or militant character, is the function of the Good Shepherd, serene,
  blithe and debonair, beyond the gentlest shepherd of Greek mythology; of a
  king under whom the beatific vision is realised of a reign of
  peace&mdash;peace of heart&mdash;among men. Such aspect of the divine
  character of Christ, rightly understood, [115] is indeed the final
  consummation of that bold and brilliant hopefulness in man&rsquo;s nature,
  which had sustained him so far through his immense labours, his immense
  sorrows, and of which pagan gaiety in the handling of life, is but a minor
  achievement. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, of those two contrasted
  aspects of its Founder, have, in different ages and under the urgency of
  different human needs, been at work also in the Christian Church. Certainly,
  in that brief &ldquo;Peace of the church&rdquo; under the Antonines, the
  spirit of a pastoral security and happiness seems to have been largely
  expanded. There, in the early church of Rome, was to be seen, and on
  sufficiently reasonable grounds, that satisfaction and serenity on a
  dispassionate survey of the facts of life, which all hearts had desired,
  though for the most part in vain, contrasting itself for Marius, in
  particular, very forcibly, with the imperial philosopher&rsquo;s so heavy
  burden of unrelieved melancholy. It was Christianity in its humanity, or even
  its humanism, in its generous hopes for man, its common sense and alacrity of
  cheerful service, its sympathy with all creatures, its appreciation of beauty
  and daylight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The angel of righteousness,&rdquo; says the Shepherd of Hermas, the
  most characteristic religious book of that age, its Pilgrim&rsquo;s
  Progress&mdash;&ldquo;the angel of righteousness is modest and delicate and
  meek and quiet. Take from thyself grief, for (as Hamlet will one day
  discover) &rsquo;tis the sister [116] of doubt and ill-temper. Grief is more
  evil than any other spirit of evil, and is most dreadful to the servants of
  God, and beyond all spirits destroyeth man. For, as when good news is come to
  one in grief, straightway he forgetteth his former grief, and no longer
  attendeth to anything except the good news which he hath heard, so do ye,
  also! having received a renewal of your soul through the beholding of these
  good things. Put on therefore gladness that hath always favour before God,
  and is acceptable unto Him, and delight thyself in it; for every man that is
  glad doeth the things that are good, and thinketh good thoughts, despising
  grief.&rdquo;&mdash;Such were the commonplaces of this new people, among whom
  so much of what Marius had valued most in the old world seemed to be under
  renewal and further promotion. Some transforming spirit was at work to
  harmonise contrasts, to deepen expression&mdash;a spirit which, in its
  dealing with the elements of ancient life, was guided by a wonderful tact of
  selection, exclusion, juxtaposition, begetting thereby a unique effect of
  freshness, a grave yet wholesome beauty, because the world of sense, the
  whole outward world was understood to set forth the veritable unction and
  royalty of a certain priesthood and kingship of the soul within, among the
  prerogatives of which was a delightful sense of freedom.</p>

  <p>The reader may think perhaps, that Marius, who, Epicurean as he was, had
  his visionary [117] aptitudes, by an inversion of one of Plato&rsquo;s
  peculiarities with which he was of course familiar, must have descended, by
  foresight, upon a later age than his own, and anticipated Christian poetry
  and art as they came to be under the influence of Saint Francis of Assisi.
  But if he dreamed on one of those nights of the beautiful house of Cecilia,
  its lights and flowers, of Cecilia herself moving among the lilies, with an
  enhanced grace as happens sometimes in healthy dreams, it was indeed hardly
  an anticipation. He had lighted, by one of the peculiar intellectual
  good-fortunes of his life, upon a period when, even more than in the days of
  austere ascesis which had preceded and were to follow it, the church was true
  for a moment, truer perhaps than she would ever be again, to that element of
  profound serenity in the soul of her Founder, which reflected the eternal
  goodwill of God to man, &ldquo;in whom,&rdquo; according to the oldest
  version of the angelic message, &ldquo;He is well-pleased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For what Christianity did many centuries afterwards in the way of
  informing an art, a poetry, of graver and higher beauty, we may think, than
  that of Greek art and poetry at their best, was in truth conformable to the
  original tendency of its genius. The genuine capacity of the catholic church
  in this direction, discoverable from the first in the New Testament, was also
  really at work, in that earlier &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; under [118] the
  Antonines&mdash;the minor &ldquo;Peace of the church,&rdquo; as we might call
  it, in distinction from the final &ldquo;Peace of the church,&rdquo; commonly
  so called, under Constantine. Saint Francis, with his following in the sphere
  of poetry and of the arts&mdash;the voice of Dante, the hand of
  Giotto&mdash;giving visible feature and colour, and a palpable place among
  men, to the regenerate race, did but re-establish a continuity, only
  suspended in part by those troublous intervening centuries&mdash;the
  &ldquo;dark ages,&rdquo; properly thus named&mdash;with the gracious spirit
  of the primitive church, as manifested in that first early springtide of her
  success. The greater &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; of Constantine, on the other hand,
  in many ways, does but establish the exclusiveness, the puritanism, the
  ascetic gloom which, in the period between Aurelius and the first Christian
  emperor, characterised a church under misunderstanding or oppression, driven
  back, in a world of tasteless controversy, inwards upon herself.</p>

  <p>Already, in the reign of Antoninus Pius, the time was gone by when men
  became Christians under some sudden and overpowering impression, and with all
  the disturbing results of such a crisis. At this period the larger number,
  perhaps, had been born Christians, had been ever with peaceful hearts in
  their &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; That earlier belief in the speedy
  coming of judgment and of the end of the world, with the consequences it so
  naturally involved in the temper [119] of men&rsquo;s minds, was dying out.
  Every day the contrast between the church and the world was becoming less
  pronounced. And now also, as the church rested awhile from opposition, that
  rapid self-development outward from within, proper to times of peace, was in
  progress. Antoninus Pius, it might seem, more truly even than Marcus Aurelius
  himself, was of that group of pagan saints for whom Dante, like Augustine,
  has provided in his scheme of the house with many mansions. A sincere old
  Roman piety had urged his fortunately constituted nature to no mistakes, no
  offences against humanity. And of his entire freedom from guile one reward
  had been this singular happiness, that under his rule there was no shedding
  of Christian blood. To him belonged that half-humorous placidity of soul, of
  a kind illustrated later very effectively by Montaigne, which, starting with
  an instinct of mere fairness towards human nature and the world, seems at
  last actually to qualify its possessor to be almost the friend of the people
  of Christ. Amiable, in its own nature, and full of a reasonable gaiety,
  Christianity has often had its advantage of characters such as that. The
  geniality of Antoninus Pius, like the geniality of the earth itself, had
  permitted the church, as being in truth no alien from that old mother earth,
  to expand and thrive for a season as by natural process. And that charmed
  period under the Antonines, extending to the later years of the [120] reign
  of Aurelius (beautiful, brief, chapter of ecclesiastical history!), contains,
  as one of its motives of interest, the earliest development of Christian
  ritual under the presidence of the church of Rome.</p>

  <p>Again as in one of those mystical, quaint visions of the Shepherd of
  Hermas, &ldquo;the aged woman was become by degrees more and more youthful.
  And in the third vision she was quite young, and radiant with beauty: only
  her hair was that of an aged woman. And at the last she was joyous, and
  seated upon a throne&mdash;seated upon a throne, because her position is a
  strong one.&rdquo; The subterranean worship of the church belonged properly
  to those years of her early history in which it was illegal for her to
  worship at all. But, hiding herself for awhile as conflict grew violent, she
  resumed, when there was felt to be no more than ordinary risk, her natural
  freedom. And the kind of outward prosperity she was enjoying in those moments
  of her first &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; her modes of worship now blossoming freely
  above-ground, was re-inforced by the decision at this point of a crisis in
  her internal history.</p>

  <p>In the history of the church, as throughout the moral history of mankind,
  there are two distinct ideals, either of which it is possible to
  maintain&mdash;two conceptions, under one or the other of which we may
  represent to ourselves men&rsquo;s efforts towards a better
  life&mdash;corresponding to those two contrasted aspects, noted above, as
  [121] discernible in the picture afforded by the New Testament itself of the
  character of Christ. The ideal of asceticism represents moral effort as
  essentially a sacrifice, the sacrifice of one part of human nature to
  another, that it may live the more completely in what survives of it; while
  the ideal of culture represents it as a harmonious development of all the
  parts of human nature, in just proportion to each other. It was to the latter
  order of ideas that the church, and especially the church of Rome in the age
  of the Antonines, freely lent herself. In that earlier &ldquo;Peace&rdquo;
  she had set up for herself the ideal of spiritual development, under the
  guidance of an instinct by which, in those serene moments, she was absolutely
  true to the peaceful soul of her Founder. &ldquo;Goodwill to men,&rdquo; she
  said, &ldquo;in whom God Himself is well-pleased!&rdquo; For a little while,
  at least, there was no forced opposition between the soul and the body, the
  world and the spirit, and the grace of graciousness itself was pre-eminently
  with the people of Christ. Tact, good sense, ever the note of a true
  orthodoxy, the merciful compromises of the church, indicative of her imperial
  vocation in regard to all the varieties of human kind, with a universality of
  which the old Roman pastorship she was superseding is but a prototype, was
  already become conspicuous, in spite of a discredited, irritating, vindictive
  society, all around her.</p>

  <p>Against that divine urbanity and moderation [122] the old error of
  Montanus we read of dimly, was a fanatical revolt&mdash;sour, falsely anti-
  mundane, ever with an air of ascetic affectation, and a bigoted distaste in
  particular for all the peculiar graces of womanhood. By it the desire to
  please was understood to come of the author of evil. In this interval of
  quietness, it was perhaps inevitable, by the law of reaction, that some such
  extravagances of the religious temper should arise. But again the church of
  Rome, now becoming every day more and more completely the capital of the
  Christian world, checked the nascent Montanism, or puritanism of the moment,
  vindicating for all Christian people a cheerful liberty of heart, against
  many a narrow group of sectaries, all alike, in their different ways,
  accusers of the genial creation of God. With her full, fresh faith in the
  Evangele&mdash;in a veritable regeneration of the earth and the body, in the
  dignity of man&rsquo;s entire personal being&mdash;for a season, at least, at
  that critical period in the development of Christianity, she was for reason,
  for common sense, for fairness to human nature, and generally for what may be
  called the naturalness of Christianity.&mdash;As also for its comely order:
  she would be &ldquo;brought to her king in raiment of needlework.&rdquo; It
  was by the bishops of Rome, diligently transforming themselves, in the true
  catholic sense, into universal pastors, that the path of what we must call
  humanism was thus defined.</p>

  <p>[123] And then, in this hour of expansion, as if now at last the catholic
  church might venture to show her outward lineaments as they really were,
  worship&mdash;&ldquo;the beauty of holiness,&rdquo; nay! the elegance of
  sanctity&mdash;was developed, with a bold and confident gladness, the like of
  which has hardly been the ideal of worship in any later age. The tables in
  fact were turned: the prize of a cheerful temper on a candid survey of life
  was no longer with the pagan world. The aesthetic charm of the catholic
  church, her evocative power over all that is eloquent and expressive in the
  better mind of man, her outward comeliness, her dignifying convictions about
  human nature:&mdash;all this, as abundantly realised centuries later by Dante
  and Giotto, by the great medieval church-builders, by the great ritualists
  like Saint Gregory, and the masters of sacred music in the middle
  age&mdash;we may see already, in dim anticipation, in those charmed moments
  towards the end of the second century. Dissipated or turned aside, partly
  through the fatal mistake of Marcus Aurelius himself, for a brief space of
  time we may discern that influence clearly predominant there. What might seem
  harsh as dogma was already justifying itself as worship; according to the
  sound rule: Lex orandi, lex credendi&mdash;Our Creeds are but the brief
  abstract of our prayer and song.</p>

  <p>The wonderful liturgical spirit of the church, her wholly unparalleled
  genius for worship, [124] being thus awake, she was rapidly re-organising
  both pagan and Jewish elements of ritual, for the expanding therein of her
  own new heart of devotion. Like the institutions of monasticism, like the
  Gothic style of architecture, the ritual system of the church, as we see it
  in historic retrospect, ranks as one of the great, conjoint, and (so to term
  them) necessary, products of human mind. Destined for ages to come, to direct
  with so deep a fascination men&rsquo;s religious instincts, it was then
  already recognisable as a new and precious fact in the sum of things. What
  has been on the whole the method of the church, as &ldquo;a power of
  sweetness and patience,&rdquo; in dealing with matters like pagan art, pagan
  literature was even then manifest; and has the character of the moderation,
  the divine moderation of Christ himself. It was only among the ignorant,
  indeed, only in the &ldquo;villages,&rdquo; that Christianity, even in
  conscious triumph over paganism, was really betrayed into iconoclasm. In the
  final &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; of the Church under Constantine, while there was
  plenty of destructive fanaticism in the country, the revolution was
  accomplished in the larger towns, in a manner more orderly and
  discreet&mdash;in the Roman manner. The faithful were bent less on the
  destruction of the old pagan temples than on their conversion to a new and
  higher use; and, with much beautiful furniture ready to hand, they became
  Christian sanctuaries.</p>

  <p>[125] Already, in accordance with such maturer wisdom, the church of the
  &ldquo;Minor Peace&rdquo; had adopted many of the graces of pagan feeling and
  pagan custom; as being indeed a living creature, taking up, transforming,
  accommodating still more closely to the human heart what of right belonged to
  it. In this way an obscure synagogue was expanded into the catholic church.
  Gathering, from a richer and more varied field of sound than had remained for
  him, those old Roman harmonies, some notes of which Gregory the Great,
  centuries later, and after generations of interrupted development, formed
  into the Gregorian music, she was already, as we have heard, the house of
  song&mdash;of a wonderful new music and poesy. As if in anticipation of the
  sixteenth century, the church was becoming &ldquo;humanistic,&rdquo; in an
  earlier, and unimpeachable Renaissance. Singing there had been in abundance
  from the first; though often it dared only be &ldquo;of the heart.&rdquo; And
  it burst forth, when it might, into the beginnings of a true ecclesiastical
  music; the Jewish psalter, inherited from the synagogue, turning now,
  gradually, from Greek into Latin&mdash;broken Latin, into Italian, as the
  ritual use of the rich, fresh, expressive vernacular superseded the earlier
  authorised language of the Church. Through certain surviving remnants of
  Greek in the later Latin liturgies, we may still discern a highly interesting
  intermediate phase of ritual development, when the Greek [126] and the Latin
  were in combination; the poor, surely!&mdash;the poor and the children of
  that liberal Roman church&mdash;responding already in their own &ldquo;vulgar
  tongue,&rdquo; to an office said in the original, liturgical Greek. That hymn
  sung in the early morning, of which Pliny had heard, was kindling into the
  service of the Mass.</p>

  <p>The Mass, indeed, would appear to have been said continuously from the
  Apostolic age. Its details, as one by one they become visible in later
  history, have already the character of what is ancient and venerable.
  &ldquo;We are very old, and ye are young!&rdquo; they seem to protest, to
  those who fail to understand them. Ritual, in fact, like all other elements
  of religion, must grow and cannot be made&mdash;grow by the same law of
  development which prevails everywhere else, in the moral as in the physical
  world. As regards this special phase of the religious life, however, such
  development seems to have been unusually rapid in the subterranean age which
  preceded Constantine; and in the very first days of the final triumph of the
  church the Mass emerges to general view already substantially complete.
  &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; was dealing, as with the dust of creeds and
  philosophies, so also with the dust of outworn religious usage, like the very
  spirit of life itself, organising soul and body out of the lime and clay of
  the earth. In a generous eclecticism, within the bounds of her liberty, and
  as by some providential power within her, [127] she gathers and serviceably
  adopts, as in other matters so in ritual, one thing here, another there, from
  various sources&mdash;Gnostic, Jewish, Pagan&mdash;to adorn and beautify the
  greatest act of worship the world has seen. It was thus the liturgy of the
  church came to be&mdash;full of consolations for the human soul, and
  destined, surely! one day, under the sanction of so many ages of human
  experience, to take exclusive possession of the religious consciousness.</p>

  <p class="first">[128] THE more highly favoured ages of imaginative art
  present instances of the summing up of an entire world of complex
  associations under some single form, like the Zeus of Olympia, or the series
  of frescoes which commemorate The Acts of Saint Francis, at Assisi, or like
  the play of Hamlet or Faust. It was not in an image, or series of images, yet
  still in a sort of dramatic action, and with the unity of a single appeal to
  eye and ear, that Marius about this time found all his new impressions set
  forth, regarding what he had already recognised, intellectually, as for him
  at least the most beautiful thing in the world.</p>

  <p>To understand the influence upon him of what follows the reader must
  remember that it was an experience which came amid a deep sense of vacuity in
  life. The fairest products of [129] the earth seemed to be dropping to
  pieces, as if in men&rsquo;s very hands, around him. How real was their
  sorrow, and his! &ldquo;His observation of life&rdquo; had come to be like
  the constant telling of a sorrowful rosary, day after day; till, as if taking
  infection from the cloudy sorrow of the mind, the eye also, the very senses,
  were grown faint and sick. And now it happened as with the actual morning on
  which he found himself a spectator of this new thing. The long winter had
  been a season of unvarying sullenness. At last, on this day he awoke with a
  sharp flash of lightning in the earliest twilight: in a little while the
  heavy rain had filtered the air: the clear light was abroad; and, as though
  the spring had set in with a sudden leap in the heart of things, the whole
  scene around him lay like some untarnished picture beneath a sky of delicate
  blue. Under the spell of his late depression, Marius had suddenly determined
  to leave Rome for a while. But desiring first to advertise Cornelius of his
  movements, and failing to find him in his lodgings, he had ventured, still
  early in the day, to seek him in the Cecilian villa. Passing through its
  silent and empty court-yard he loitered for a moment, to admire. Under the
  clear but immature light of winter morning after a storm, all the details of
  form and colour in the old marbles were distinctly visible, and with a kind
  of severity or sadness&mdash;so it struck him&mdash;amid their beauty: [130]
  in them, and in all other details of the scene&mdash;the cypresses, the
  bunches of pale daffodils in the grass, the curves of the purple hills of
  Tusculum, with the drifts of virgin snow still lying in their hollows.</p>

  <p>The little open door, through which he passed from the court-yard,
  admitted him into what was plainly the vast Lararium, or domestic sanctuary,
  of the Cecilian family, transformed in many particulars, but still richly
  decorated, and retaining much of its ancient furniture in metal-work and
  costly stone. The peculiar half-light of dawn seemed to be lingering beyond
  its hour upon the solemn marble walls; and here, though at that moment in
  absolute silence, a great company of people was assembled. In that brief
  period of peace, during which the church emerged for awhile from her
  jealously-guarded subterranean life, the rigour of an earlier rule of
  exclusion had been relaxed. And so it came to pass that, on this morning
  Marius saw for the first time the wonderful spectacle&mdash;wonderful,
  especially, in its evidential power over himself, over his own
  thoughts&mdash;of those who believe.</p>

  <p>There were noticeable, among those present, great varieties of rank, of
  age, of personal type. The Roman ingenuus, with the white toga and gold ring,
  stood side by side with his slave; and the air of the whole company was,
  above all, a grave one, an air of recollection. Coming [131] thus
  unexpectedly upon this large assembly, so entirely united, in a silence so
  profound, for purposes unknown to him, Marius felt for a moment as if he had
  stumbled by chance upon some great conspiracy. Yet that could scarcely be,
  for the people here collected might have figured as the earliest handsel, or
  pattern, of a new world, from the very face of which discontent had passed
  away. Corresponding to the variety of human type there present, was the
  various expression of every form of human sorrow assuaged. What desire, what
  fulfilment of desire, had wrought so pathetically on the features of these
  ranks of aged men and women of humble condition? Those young men, bent down
  so discreetly on the details of their sacred service, had faced life and were
  glad, by some science, or light of knowledge they had, to which there had
  certainly been no parallel in the older world. Was some credible message from
  beyond &ldquo;the flaming rampart of the world&rdquo;&mdash;a message of
  hope, regarding the place of men&rsquo;s souls and their interest in the sum
  of things&mdash;already moulding anew their very bodies, and looks, and
  voices, now and here? At least, there was a cleansing and kindling flame at
  work in them, which seemed to make everything else Marius had ever known look
  comparatively vulgar and mean. There were the children, above all&mdash;
  troops of children&mdash;reminding him of those pathetic children&rsquo;s
  graves, like cradles or garden- [132] beds, he had noticed in his first visit
  to these places; and they more than satisfied the odd curiosity he had then
  conceived about them, wondering in what quaintly expressive forms they might
  come forth into the daylight, if awakened from sleep. Children of the
  Catacombs, some but &ldquo;a span long,&rdquo; with features not so much
  beautiful as heroic (that world of new, refining sentiment having set its
  seal even on childhood), they retained certainly no stain or trace of
  anything subterranean this morning, in the alacrity of their worship&mdash;as
  ready as if they had been at play&mdash;stretching forth their hands, crying,
  chanting in a resonant voice, and with boldly upturned faces, Christe
  Eleison!</p>

  <p>For the silence&mdash;silence, amid those lights of early morning to which
  Marius had always been constitutionally impressible, as having in them a
  certain reproachful austerity&mdash;was broken suddenly by resounding cries
  of Kyrie Eleison! Christe Eleison! repeated alternately, again and again,
  until the bishop, rising from his chair, made sign that this prayer should
  cease. But the voices burst out once more presently, in richer and more
  varied melody, though still of an antiphonal character; the men, the women
  and children, the deacons, the people, answering one another, somewhat after
  the manner of a Greek chorus. But again with what a novelty of poetic accent;
  what a genuine expansion of heart; what profound intimations for the [133]
  intellect, as the meaning of the words grew upon him! Cum grandi affectu et
  compunctione dicatur&mdash;says an ancient eucharistic order; and certainly,
  the mystic tone of this praying and singing was one with the expression of
  deliverance, of grateful assurance and sincerity, upon the faces of those
  assembled. As if some searching correction, a regeneration of the body by the
  spirit, had begun, and was already gone a great way, the countenances of men,
  women, and children alike had a brightness on them which he could fancy
  reflected upon himself&mdash;an amenity, a mystic amiability and unction,
  which found its way most readily of all to the hearts of children themselves.
  The religious poetry of those Hebrew psalms&mdash;Benedixisti Domine terram
  tuam: Dixit Dominus Domino meo, sede a dextris meis&mdash;was certainly in
  marvellous accord with the lyrical instinct of his own character. Those
  august hymns, he thought, must thereafter ever remain by him as among the
  well-tested powers in things to soothe and fortify the soul. One could never
  grow tired of them!</p>

  <p>In the old pagan worship there had been little to call the understanding
  into play. Here, on the other hand, the utterance, the eloquence, the music
  of worship conveyed, as Marius readily understood, a fact or series of facts,
  for intellectual reception. That became evident, more especially, in those
  lessons, or sacred readings, which, like the singing, in broken [134]
  vernacular Latin, occurred at certain intervals, amid the silence of the
  assembly. There were readings, again with bursts of chanted invocation
  between for fuller light on a difficult path, in which many a vagrant voice
  of human philosophy, haunting men&rsquo;s minds from of old, recurred with
  clearer accent than had ever belonged to it before, as if lifted, above its
  first intention, into the harmonies of some supreme system of knowledge or
  doctrine, at length complete. And last of all came a narrative which, with a
  thousand tender memories, every one appeared to know by heart, displaying, in
  all the vividness of a picture for the eye, the mournful figure of him
  towards whom this whole act of worship still consistently turned&mdash;a
  figure which seemed to have absorbed, like some rich tincture in his garment,
  all that was deep-felt and impassioned in the experiences of the past.</p>

  <p>It was the anniversary of his birth as a little child they celebrated to-
  day. <i>Astiterunt reges terrae</i>: so the Gradual, the &ldquo;Song of
  Degrees,&rdquo; proceeded, the young men on the steps of the altar responding
  in deep, clear, antiphon or chorus&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Astiterunt reges terrae&mdash;<br>
  Adversus sanctum puerum tuum, Jesum:<br>
  Nunc, Domine, da servis tuis loqui verbum tuum&mdash;<br>
  Et signa fieri, per nomen sancti pueri Jesu.</p>

  <p>And the proper action of the rite itself, like a [135] half-opened book to
  be read by the duly initiated mind took up those suggestions, and carried
  them forward into the present, as having reference to a power still
  efficacious, still after some mystic sense even now in action among the
  people there assembled. The entire office, indeed, with its interchange of
  lessons, hymns, prayer, silence, was itself like a single piece of highly
  composite, dramatic music; a &ldquo;song of degrees,&rdquo; rising steadily
  to a climax. Notwithstanding the absence of any central image visible to the
  eye, the entire ceremonial process, like the place in which it was enacted,
  was weighty with symbolic significance, seemed to express a single leading
  motive. The mystery, if such in fact it was, centered indeed in the actions
  of one visible person, distinguished among the assistants, who stood ranged
  in semicircle around him, by the extreme fineness of his white vestments, and
  the pointed cap with the golden ornaments upon his head.</p>

  <p>Nor had Marius ever seen the pontifical character, as he conceived
  it&mdash;sicut unguentum in capite, descendens in oram vestimenti&mdash;so
  fully realised, as in the expression, the manner and voice, of this novel
  pontiff, as he took his seat on the white chair placed for him by the young
  men, and received his long staff into his hand, or moved his
  hands&mdash;hands which seemed endowed in very deed with some mysterious
  power&mdash;at the Lavabo, or at the various benedictions, or [136] to bless
  certain objects on the table before him, chanting in cadence of a grave
  sweetness the leading parts of the rite. What profound unction and mysticity!
  The solemn character of the singing was at its height when he opened his
  lips. Like some new sort of rhapsodos, it was for the moment as if he alone
  possessed the words of the office, and they flowed anew from some permanent
  source of inspiration within him. The table or altar at which he presided,
  below a canopy on delicate spiral columns, was in fact the tomb of a youthful
  &ldquo;witness,&rdquo; of the family of the Cecilii, who had shed his blood
  not many years before, and whose relics were still in this place. It was for
  his sake the bishop put his lips so often to the surface before him; the
  regretful memory of that death entwining itself, though not without certain
  notes of triumph, as a matter of special inward significance, throughout a
  service, which was, before all else, from first to last, a commemoration of
  the dead.</p>

  <p>A sacrifice also,&mdash;a sacrifice, it might seem, like the most
  primitive, the most natural and enduringly significant of old pagan
  sacrifices, of the simplest fruits of the earth. And in connexion with this
  circumstance again, as in the actual stones of the building so in the rite
  itself, what Marius observed was not so much new matter as a new spirit,
  moulding, informing, with a new intention, many observances not [137]
  witnessed for the first time to-day. Men and women came to the altar
  successively, in perfect order, and deposited below the lattice-work of
  pierced white marble, their baskets of wheat and grapes, incense, oil for the
  sanctuary lamps; bread and wine especially&mdash;pure wheaten bread, the pure
  white wine of the Tusculan vineyards. There was here a veritable
  consecration, hopeful and animating, of the earth&rsquo;s gifts, of old dead
  and dark matter itself, now in some way redeemed at last, of all that we can
  touch or see, in the midst of a jaded world that had lost the true sense of
  such things, and in strong contrast to the wise emperor&rsquo;s renunciant
  and impassive attitude towards them. Certain portions of that bread and wine
  were taken into the bishop&rsquo;s hands; and thereafter, with an increasing
  mysticity and effusion the rite proceeded. Still in a strain of inspired
  supplication, the antiphonal singing developed, from this point, into a kind
  of dialogue between the chief minister and the whole assisting
  company&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">SURSUM CORDA!<br>
  HABEMUS AD DOMINUM.<br>
  GRATIAS AGAMUS DOMINO DEO NOSTRO!&mdash;</p>

  <p>It might have been thought the business, the duty or service of young men
  more particularly, as they stood there in long ranks, and in severe and
  simple vesture of the purest white&mdash;a service in which they would seem
  to be flying [138] for refuge, as with their precious, their treacherous and
  critical youth in their hands, to one&mdash;Yes! one like themselves, who yet
  claimed their worship, a worship, above all, in the way of Aurelius, in the
  way of imitation. Adoramus te Christe, quia per crucem tuam redemisti
  mundum!&mdash;they cry together. So deep is the emotion that at moments it
  seems to Marius as if some there present apprehend that prayer prevails, that
  the very object of this pathetic crying himself draws near. From the first
  there had been the sense, an increasing assurance, of one
  coming:&mdash;actually with them now, according to the oft-repeated
  affirmation or petition, Dominus vobiscum! Some at least were quite sure of
  it; and the confidence of this remnant fired the hearts, and gave meaning to
  the bold, ecstatic worship, of all the rest about them.</p>

  <p>Prompted especially by the suggestions of that mysterious old Jewish
  psalmody, so new to him&mdash;lesson and hymn&mdash;and catching therewith a
  portion of the enthusiasm of those beside him, Marius could discern dimly,
  behind the solemn recitation which now followed, at once a narrative and a
  prayer, the most touching image truly that had ever come within the scope of
  his mental or physical gaze. It was the image of a young man giving up
  voluntarily, one by one, for the greatest of ends, the greatest gifts;
  actually parting with himself, above all, with the serenity, the divine
  serenity, of his [139] own soul; yet from the midst of his desolation crying
  out upon the greatness of his success, as if foreseeing this very
  worship.(Psalm xxii.22- 31.) As centre of the supposed facts which for these
  people were become so constraining a motive of hopefulness, of activity, that
  image seemed to display itself with an overwhelming claim on human gratitude.
  What Saint Lewis of France discerned, and found so irresistibly touching,
  across the dimness of many centuries, as a painful thing done for love of him
  by one he had never seen, was to them almost as a thing of yesterday; and
  their hearts were whole with it. It had the force, among their interests, of
  an almost recent event in the career of one whom their fathers&rsquo; fathers
  might have known. From memories so sublime, yet so close at hand, had the
  narrative descended in which these acts of worship centered; though again the
  names of some more recently dead were mingled in it. And it seemed as if the
  very dead were aware; to be stirring beneath the slabs of the sepulchres
  which lay so near, that they might associate themselves to this
  enthusiasm&mdash;to this exalted worship of Jesus.</p>

  <p>One by one, at last, the faithful approach to receive from the chief
  minister morsels of the great, white, wheaten cake, he had taken into his
  hands&mdash;Perducat vos ad vitam aeternam! he prays, half-silently, as they
  depart again, after [140] discreet embraces. The Eucharist of those early
  days was, even more entirely than at any later or happier time, an act of
  thanksgiving; and while the remnants of the feast are borne away for the
  reception of the sick, the sustained gladness of the rite reaches its highest
  point in the singing of a hymn: a hymn like the spontaneous product of two
  opposed militant companies, contending accordantly together, heightening,
  accumulating, their witness, provoking one another&rsquo;s worship, in a kind
  of sacred rivalry.</p>

  <p>Ite! Missa est!&mdash;cried the young deacons: and Marius departed from
  that strange scene along with the rest. What was it?&mdash;Was it this made
  the way of Cornelius so pleasant through the world? As for Marius
  himself,&mdash;the natural soul of worship in him had at last been satisfied
  as never before. He felt, as he left that place, that he must hereafter
  experience often a longing memory, a kind of thirst, for all this, over
  again. And it seemed moreover to define what he must require of the powers,
  whatsoever they might be, that had brought him into the world at all, to make
  him not unhappy in it.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; A CONVERSATION NOT IMAGINARY</h2>

  <p class="first">[141] IN cheerfulness is the success of our studies, says
  Pliny&mdash; studia hilaritate proveniunt. It was still the habit of Marius,
  encouraged by his experience that sleep is not only a sedative but the best
  of stimulants, to seize the morning hours for creation, making profit when he
  might of the wholesome serenity which followed a dreamless night. &ldquo;The
  morning for creation,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;the afternoon for the
  perfecting labour of the file; the evening for reception&mdash;the reception
  of matter from without one, of other men&rsquo;s words and
  thoughts&mdash;matter for our own dreams, or the merely mechanic exercise of
  the brain, brooding thereon silently, in its dark chambers.&rdquo; To leave
  home early in the day was therefore a rare thing for him. He was induced so
  to do on the occasion of a visit to Rome of the famous writer Lucian, whom he
  had been bidden to meet. The breakfast over, he walked away with the learned
  guest, having offered to be his guide [142] to the lecture-room of a
  well-known Greek rhetorician and expositor of the Stoic philosophy, a teacher
  then much in fashion among the studious youth of Rome. On reaching the place,
  however, they found the doors closed, with a slip of writing attached, which
  proclaimed &ldquo;a holiday&rdquo;; and the morning being a fine one, they
  walked further, along the Appian Way. Mortality, with which the Queen of
  Ways&mdash;in reality the favourite cemetery of Rome&mdash;was so closely
  crowded, in every imaginable form of sepulchre, from the tiniest baby-house,
  to the massive monument out of which the Middle Age would adapt a
  fortress-tower, might seem, on a morning like this, to be &ldquo;smiling
  through tears.&rdquo; The flower- stalls just beyond the city gates presented
  to view an array of posies and garlands, fresh enough for a wedding. At one
  and another of them groups of persons, gravely clad, were making their
  bargains before starting for some perhaps distant spot on the highway, to
  keep a dies rosationis, this being the time of roses, at the grave of a
  deceased relation. Here and there, a funeral procession was slowly on its
  way, in weird contrast to the gaiety of the hour.</p>

  <p>The two companions, of course, read the epitaphs as they strolled along.
  In one, reminding them of the poet&rsquo;s&mdash;<i>Si lacrimae prosunt,
  visis te ostende videri!</i>&mdash;a woman prayed that her lost husband might
  visit her dreams. Their characteristic note, indeed, was an imploring cry,
  still [143] to be sought after by the living. &ldquo;While I live,&rdquo;
  such was the promise of a lover to his dead mistress, &ldquo;you will receive
  this homage: after my death,&mdash;who can tell?&rdquo;&mdash;post mortem
  nescio. &ldquo;If ghosts, my sons, do feel anything after death, my sorrow
  will be lessened by your frequent coming to me here!&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a
  privileged tomb; to my family and descendants has been conceded the right of
  visiting this place as often as they please.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is an eternal
  habitation; here lie I; here I shall lie for ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;Reader! if
  you doubt that the soul survives, make your oblation and a prayer for me; and
  you shall understand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The elder of the two readers, certainly, was little affected by those
  pathetic suggestions. It was long ago that after visiting the banks of the
  Padus, where he had sought in vain for the poplars (sisters of Phaethon
  erewhile) whose tears became amber, he had once for all arranged for himself
  a view of the world exclusive of all reference to what might lie beyond its
  &ldquo;flaming barriers.&rdquo; And at the age of sixty he had no misgivings.
  His elegant and self-complacent but far from unamiable scepticism, long since
  brought to perfection, never failed him. It surrounded him, as some are
  surrounded by a magic ring of fine aristocratic manners, with &ldquo;a
  rampart,&rdquo; through which he himself never broke, nor permitted any thing
  or person to break upon him. Gay, animated, content with his old age [144] as
  it was, the aged student still took a lively interest in studious
  youth.&mdash;Could Marius inform him of any such, now known to him in Rome?
  What did the young men learn, just then? and how?</p>

  <p>In answer, Marius became fluent concerning the promise of one young
  student, the son, as it presently appeared, of parents of whom Lucian himself
  knew something: and soon afterwards the lad was seen coming along
  briskly&mdash;a lad with gait and figure well enough expressive of the sane
  mind in the healthy body, though a little slim and worn of feature, and with
  a pair of eyes expressly designed, it might seem, for fine glancings at the
  stars. At the sight of Marius he paused suddenly, and with a modest blush on
  recognising his companion, who straightway took with the youth, so prettily
  enthusiastic, the freedom of an old friend.</p>

  <p>In a few moments the three were seated together, immediately above the
  fragrant borders of a rose-farm, on the marble bench of one of the exhedrae
  for the use of foot-passengers at the roadside, from which they could
  overlook the grand, earnest prospect of the Campagna, and enjoy the air.
  Fancying that the lad&rsquo;s plainly written enthusiasm had induced in the
  elder speaker somewhat more fervour than was usual with him, Marius listened
  to the conversation which follows.&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Hermotimus! Hurrying to lecture! [145]&mdash;if I may judge by
  your pace, and that volume in your hand. You were thinking hard as you came
  along, moving your lips and waving your arms. Some fine speech you were
  pondering, some knotty question, some viewy doctrine--not to be idle for a
  moment, to be making progress in philosophy, even on your way to the schools.
  To-day, however, you need go no further. We read a notice at the schools that
  there would be no lecture. Stay therefore, and talk awhile with us.</p>

  <p>&mdash;With pleasure, Lucian.&mdash;Yes! I was ruminating
  yesterday&rsquo;s conference. One must not lose a moment. Life is short and
  art is long! And it was of the art of medicine, that was first said&mdash;a
  thing so much easier than divine philosophy, to which one can hardly attain
  in a lifetime, unless one be ever wakeful, ever on the watch. And here the
  hazard is no little one:&mdash;By the attainment of a true philosophy to
  attain happiness; or, having missed both, to perish, as one of the vulgar
  herd.</p>

  <p>&mdash;The prize is a great one, Hermotimus! and you must needs be near
  it, after these months of toil, and with that scholarly pallor of yours.
  Unless, indeed, you have already laid hold upon it, and kept us in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>&mdash;How could that be, Lucian? Happiness, as Hesiod says, abides very
  far hence; and the way to it is long and steep and rough. I see myself still
  at the beginning of my journey; still [146] but at the mountain&rsquo;s foot.
  I am trying with all my might to get forward. What I need is a hand,
  stretched out to help me.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And is not the master sufficient for that? Could he not, like Zeus
  in Homer, let down to you, from that high place, a golden cord, to draw you
  up thither, to himself and to that Happiness, to which he ascended so long
  ago?</p>

  <p>&mdash;The very point, Lucian! Had it depended on him I should long ago
  have been caught up. &rsquo;Tis I, am wanting.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well! keep your eye fixed on the journey&rsquo;s end, and that
  happiness there above, with confidence in his goodwill.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Ah! there are many who start cheerfully on the journey and proceed
  a certain distance, but lose heart when they light on the obstacles of the
  way. Only, those who endure to the end do come to the mountain&rsquo;s top,
  and thereafter live in Happiness:&mdash;live a wonderful manner of life,
  seeing all other people from that great height no bigger than tiny ants.</p>

  <p>&mdash;What little fellows you make of us&mdash;less than the
  pygmies&mdash;down in the dust here. Well! we, &lsquo;the vulgar herd,&rsquo;
  as we creep along, will not forget you in our prayers, when you are seated up
  there above the clouds, whither you have been so long hastening. But tell me,
  Hermotimus!&mdash;when do you expect to arrive there?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Ah! that I know not. In twenty years, [147] perhaps, I shall be
  really on the summit.&mdash;A great while! you think. But then, again, the
  prize I contend for is a great one.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Perhaps! But as to those twenty years&mdash;that you will live so
  long. Has the master assured you of that? Is he a prophet as well as a
  philosopher? For I suppose you would not endure all this, upon a mere
  chance&mdash;toiling day and night, though it might happen that just ere the
  last step, Destiny seized you by the foot and plucked you thence, with your
  hope still unfulfilled.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Hence, with these ill-omened words, Lucian! Were I to survive but
  for a day, I should be happy, having once attained wisdom.</p>

  <p>&mdash;How?&mdash;Satisfied with a single day, after all those
  labours?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes! one blessed moment were enough!</p>

  <p>&mdash;But again, as you have never been, how know you that happiness is
  to be had up there, at all&mdash;the happiness that is to make all this worth
  while?</p>

  <p>&mdash;I believe what the master tells me. Of a certainty he knows, being
  now far above all others.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And what was it he told you about it? Is it riches, or glory, or
  some indescribable pleasure?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Hush! my friend! All those are nothing in comparison of the life
  there.</p>

  <p>&mdash;What, then, shall those who come to the [148] end of this
  discipline&mdash;what excellent thing shall they receive, if not these?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Wisdom, the absolute goodness and the absolute beauty, with the
  sure and certain knowledge of all things&mdash;how they are. Riches and glory
  and pleasure&mdash;whatsoever belongs to the body&mdash;they have cast from
  them: stripped bare of all that, they mount up, even as Hercules, consumed in
  the fire, became a god. He too cast aside all that he had of his earthly
  mother, and bearing with him the divine element, pure and undefiled, winged
  his way to heaven from the discerning flame. Even so do they, detached from
  all that others prize, by the burning fire of a true philosophy, ascend to
  the highest degree of happiness.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Strange! And do they never come down again from the heights to help
  those whom they left below? Must they, when they be once come thither, there
  remain for ever, laughing, as you say, at what other men prize?</p>

  <p>&mdash;More than that! They whose initiation is entire are subject no
  longer to anger, fear, desire, regret. Nay! They scarcely feel at all.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well! as you have leisure to-day, why not tell an old friend in
  what way you first started on your philosophic journey? For, if I might, I
  should like to join company with you from this very day.</p>

  <p>&mdash;If you be really willing, Lucian! you will learn in no long time
  your advantage over all [149] other people. They will seem but as children,
  so far above them will be your thoughts.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well! Be you my guide! It is but fair. But tell me&mdash;Do you
  allow learners to contradict, if anything is said which they don&rsquo;t
  think right?</p>

  <p>&mdash;No, indeed! Still, if you wish, oppose your questions. In that way
  you will learn more easily.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Let me know, then&mdash;Is there one only way which leads to a true
  philosophy&mdash;your own way&mdash;the way of the Stoics: or is it true, as
  I have heard, that there are many ways of approaching it?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes! Many ways! There are the Stoics, and the Peripatetics, and
  those who call themselves after Plato: there are the enthusiasts for
  Diogenes, and Antisthenes, and the followers of Pythagoras, besides
  others.</p>

  <p>&mdash;It was true, then. But again, is what they say the same or
  different?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Very different.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yet the truth, I conceive, would be one and the same, from all of
  them. Answer me then&mdash;In what, or in whom, did you confide when you
  first betook yourself to philosophy, and seeing so many doors open to you,
  passed them all by and went in to the Stoics, as if there alone lay the way
  of truth? What token had you? Forget, please, all you are to-
  day&mdash;half-way, or more, on the philosophic journey: [150] answer me as
  you would have done then, a mere outsider as I am now.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Willingly! It was there the great majority went! &rsquo;Twas by
  that I judged it to be the better way.</p>

  <p>&mdash;A majority how much greater than the Epicureans, the Platonists,
  the Peripatetics? You, doubtless, counted them respectively, as with the
  votes in a scrutiny.</p>

  <p>&mdash;No! But this was not my only motive. I heard it said by every one
  that the Epicureans were soft and voluptuous, the Peripatetics avaricious and
  quarrelsome, and Plato&rsquo;s followers puffed up with pride. But of the
  Stoics, not a few pronounced that they were true men, that they knew
  everything, that theirs was the royal road, the one road, to wealth, to
  wisdom, to all that can be desired.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Of course those who said this were not themselves Stoics: you would
  not have believed them&mdash;still less their opponents. They were the
  vulgar, therefore.</p>

  <p>&mdash;True! But you must know that I did not trust to others exclusively.
  I trusted also to myself&mdash;to what I saw. I saw the Stoics going through
  the world after a seemly manner, neatly clad, never in excess, always
  collected, ever faithful to the mean which all pronounce
  &lsquo;golden.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&mdash;You are trying an experiment on me. You would fain see how far you
  can mislead [151] me as to your real ground. The kind of probation you
  describe is applicable, indeed, to works of art, which are rightly judged by
  their appearance to the eye. There is something in the comely form, the
  graceful drapery, which tells surely of the hand of Pheidias or Alcamenes.
  But if philosophy is to be judged by outward appearances, what would become
  of the blind man, for instance, unable to observe the attire and gait of your
  friends the Stoics?</p>

  <p>&mdash;It was not of the blind I was thinking.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yet there must needs be some common criterion in a matter so
  important to all. Put the blind, if you will, beyond the privileges of
  philosophy; though they perhaps need that inward vision more than all others.
  But can those who are not blind, be they as keen-sighted as you will, collect
  a single fact of mind from a man&rsquo;s attire, from anything
  outward?&mdash;Understand me! You attached yourself to these men&mdash;did
  you not?&mdash;because of a certain love you had for the mind in them, the
  thoughts they possessed desiring the mind in you to be improved thereby?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Assuredly!</p>

  <p>&mdash;How, then, did you find it possible, by the sort of signs you just
  now spoke of, to distinguish the true philosopher from the false? Matters of
  that kind are not wont so to reveal themselves. They are but hidden
  mysteries, hardly to be guessed at through the words and acts which [152] may
  in some sort be conformable to them. You, however, it would seem, can look
  straight into the heart in men&rsquo;s bosoms, and acquaint yourself with
  what really passes there.</p>

  <p>&mdash;You are making sport of me, Lucian! In truth, it was with
  God&rsquo;s help I made my choice, and I don&rsquo;t repent it.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And still you refuse to tell me, to save me from perishing in that
  &lsquo;vulgar herd.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&mdash;Because nothing I can tell you would satisfy you.</p>

  <p>&mdash;You are mistaken, my friend! But since you deliberately conceal the
  thing, grudging me, as I suppose, that true philosophy which would make me
  equal to you, I will try, if it may be, to find out for myself the exact
  criterion in these matters&mdash;how to make a perfectly safe choice. And, do
  you listen.</p>

  <p>&mdash;I will; there may be something worth knowing in what you will
  say.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well!&mdash;only don&rsquo;t laugh if I seem a little fumbling in
  my efforts. The fault is yours, in refusing to share your lights with me. Let
  Philosophy, then, be like a city&mdash;a city whose citizens within it are a
  happy people, as your master would tell you, having lately come thence, as we
  suppose. All the virtues are theirs, and they are little less than gods.
  Those acts of violence which happen among us are not to be seen in their
  streets. They live together in one mind, very seemly; the things which beyond
  [153] everything else cause men to contend against each other, having no
  place upon them. Gold and silver, pleasure, vainglory, they have long since
  banished, as being unprofitable to the commonwealth; and their life is an
  unbroken calm, in liberty, equality, an equal happiness.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And is it not reasonable that all men should desire to be of a city
  such as that, and take no account of the length and difficulty of the way
  thither, so only they may one day become its freemen?</p>

  <p>&mdash;It might well be the business of life:&mdash;leaving all else,
  forgetting one&rsquo;s native country here, unmoved by the tears, the
  restraining hands, of parents or children, if one had them&mdash;only bidding
  them follow the same road; and if they would not or could not, shaking them
  off, leaving one&rsquo;s very garment in their hands if they took hold on us,
  to start off straightway for that happy place! For there is no fear, I
  suppose, of being shut out if one came thither naked. I remember, indeed,
  long ago an aged man related to me how things passed there, offering himself
  to be my leader, and enrol me on my arrival in the number of the citizens. I
  was but fifteen&mdash;certainly very foolish: and it may be that I was then
  actually within the suburbs, or at the very gates, of the city. Well, this
  aged man told me, among other things, that all the citizens were wayfarers
  from afar. Among them were barbarians and slaves, poor [154] men&mdash;aye!
  and cripples&mdash;all indeed who truly desired that citizenship. For the
  only legal conditions of enrolment were&mdash;not wealth, nor bodily beauty,
  nor noble ancestry&mdash;things not named among them&mdash;but intelligence,
  and the desire for moral beauty, and earnest labour. The last comer, thus
  qualified, was made equal to the rest: master and slave, patrician, plebeian,
  were words they had not&mdash;in that blissful place. And believe me, if that
  blissful, that beautiful place, were set on a hill visible to all the world,
  I should long ago have journeyed thither. But, as you say, it is far off: and
  one must needs find out for oneself the road to it, and the best possible
  guide. And I find a multitude of guides, who press on me their services, and
  protest, all alike, that they have themselves come thence. Only, the roads
  they propose are many, and towards adverse quarters. And one of them is steep
  and stony, and through the beating sun; and the other is through green
  meadows, and under grateful shade, and by many a fountain of water. But
  howsoever the road may be, at each one of them stands a credible guide; he
  puts out his hand and would have you come his way. All other ways are wrong,
  all other guides false. Hence my difficulty!&mdash;The number and variety of
  the ways! For you know, There is but one road that leads to Corinth.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well! If you go the whole round, you [155] will find no better
  guides than those. If you wish to get to Corinth, you will follow the traces
  of Zeno and Chrysippus. It is impossible otherwise.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes! The old, familiar language! Were one of Plato&rsquo;s fellow-
  pilgrims here, or a follower of Epicurus&mdash;or fifty others&mdash;each
  would tell me that I should never get to Corinth except in his company. One
  must therefore credit all alike, which would be absurd; or, what is far
  safer, distrust all alike, until one has discovered the truth. Suppose now,
  that, being as I am, ignorant which of all philosophers is really in
  possession of truth, I choose your sect, relying on yourself&mdash;my friend,
  indeed, yet still acquainted only with the way of the Stoics; and that then
  some divine power brought Plato, and Aristotle, and Pythagoras, and the
  others, back to life again. Well! They would come round about me, and put me
  on my trial for my presumption, and say:&mdash;&rsquo;In whom was it you
  confided when you preferred Zeno and Chrysippus to me?&mdash;and
  me?&mdash;masters of far more venerable age than those, who are but of
  yesterday; and though you have never held any discussion with us, nor made
  trial of our doctrine? It is not thus that the law would have judges
  do&mdash;listen to one party and refuse to let the other speak for himself.
  If judges act thus, there may be an appeal to another tribunal.&rsquo; What
  should I answer? Would it [156] be enough to say:&mdash;&rsquo;I trusted my
  friend Hermotimus?&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;We know not Hermotimus, nor he
  us,&rsquo; they would tell me; adding, with a smile, &rsquo;your friend
  thinks he may believe all our adversaries say of us whether in ignorance or
  in malice. Yet if he were umpire in the games, and if he happened to see one
  of our wrestlers, by way of a preliminary exercise, knock to pieces an
  antagonist of mere empty air, he would not thereupon pronounce him a victor.
  Well! don&rsquo;t let your friend Hermotimus suppose, in like manner, that
  his teachers have really prevailed over us in those battles of theirs, fought
  with our mere shadows. That, again, were to be like children, lightly
  overthrowing their own card-castles; or like boy-archers, who cry out when
  they hit the target of straw. The Persian and Scythian bowmen, as they speed
  along, can pierce a bird on the wing.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&mdash;Let us leave Plato and the others at rest. It is not for me to
  contend against them. Let us rather search out together if the truth of
  Philosophy be as I say. Why summon the athletes, and archers from Persia?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes! let them go, if you think them in the way. And now do you
  speak! You really look as if you had something wonderful to deliver.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well then, Lucian! to me it seems quite possible for one who has
  learned the doctrines of the Stoics only, to attain from those a knowledge
  [157] of the truth, without proceeding to inquire into all the various tenets
  of the others. Look at the question in this way. If one told you that twice
  two make four, would it be necessary for you to go the whole round of the
  arithmeticians, to see whether any one of them will say that twice two make
  five, or seven? Would you not see at once that the man tells the truth?</p>

  <p>&mdash;At once.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Why then do you find it impossible that one who has fallen in with
  the Stoics only, in their enunciation of what is true, should adhere to them,
  and seek after no others; assured that four could never be five, even if
  fifty Platos, fifty Aristotles said so?</p>

  <p>&mdash;You are beside the point, Hermotimus! You are likening open
  questions to principles universally received. Have you ever met any one who
  said that twice two make five, or seven?</p>

  <p>&mdash;No! only a madman would say that.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And have you ever met, on the other hand, a Stoic and an Epicurean
  who were agreed upon the beginning and the end, the principle and the final
  cause, of things? Never! Then your parallel is false. We are inquiring to
  which of the sects philosophic truth belongs, and you seize on it by
  anticipation, and assign it to the Stoics, alleging, what is by no means
  clear, that it is they for whom twice two make four. But the Epicureans, or
  the Platonists, [158] might say that it is they, in truth, who make two and
  two equal four, while you make them five or seven. Is it not so, when you
  think virtue the only good, and the Epicureans pleasure; when you hold all
  things to be material, while the Platonists admit something immaterial? As I
  said, you resolve offhand, in favour of the Stoics, the very point which
  needs a critical decision. If it is clear beforehand that the Stoics alone
  make two and two equal four, then the others must hold their peace. But so
  long as that is the very point of debate, we must listen to all sects alike,
  or be well-assured that we shall seem but partial in our judgment.</p>

  <p>&mdash;I think, Lucian! that you do not altogether understand my meaning.
  To make it clear, then, let us suppose that two men had entered a temple, of
  Aesculapius,&mdash;say! or Bacchus: and that afterwards one of the sacred
  vessels is found to be missing. And the two men must be searched to see which
  of them has hidden it under his garment. For it is certainly in the
  possession of one or the other of them. Well! if it be found on the first
  there will be no need to search the second; if it is not found on the first,
  then the other must have it; and again, there will be no need to search
  him.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Yes! So let it be.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And we too, Lucian! if we have found the holy vessel in possession
  of the Stoics, shall no longer have need to search other philosophers, [159]
  having attained that we were seeking. Why trouble ourselves further?</p>

  <p>&mdash;No need, if something had indeed been found, and you knew it to be
  that lost thing: if, at the least, you could recognise the sacred object when
  you saw it. But truly, as the matter now stands, not two persons only have
  entered the temple, one or the other of whom must needs have taken the golden
  cup, but a whole crowd of persons. And then, it is not clear what the lost
  object really is&mdash;cup, or flagon, or diadem; for one of the priests
  avers this, another that; they are not even in agreement as to its material:
  some will have it to be of brass, others of silver, or gold. It thus becomes
  necessary to search the garments of all persons who have entered the temple,
  if the lost vessel is to be recovered. And if you find a golden cup on the
  first of them, it will still be necessary to proceed in searching the
  garments of the others; for it is not certain that this cup really belonged
  to the temple. Might there not be many such golden vessels?&mdash;No! we must
  go on to every one of them, placing all that we find in the midst together,
  and then make our guess which of all those things may fairly be supposed to
  be the property of the god. For, again, this circumstance adds greatly to our
  difficulty, that without exception every one searched is found to have
  something upon him&mdash;cup, or flagon, or diadem, of brass, of silver,
  [160] of gold: and still, all the while, it is not ascertained which of all
  these is the sacred thing. And you must still hesitate to pronounce any one
  of them guilty of the sacrilege&mdash;those objects may be their own lawful
  property: one cause of all this obscurity being, as I think, that there was
  no inscription on the lost cup, if cup it was. Had the name of the god, or
  even that of the donor, been upon it, at least we should have had less
  trouble, and having detected the inscription, should have ceased to trouble
  any one else by our search.</p>

  <p>&mdash;I have nothing to reply to that.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Hardly anything plausible. So that if we wish to find who it is has
  the sacred vessel, or who will be our best guide to Corinth, we must needs
  proceed to every one and examine him with the utmost care, stripping off his
  garment and considering him closely. Scarcely, even so, shall we come at the
  truth. And if we are to have a credible adviser regarding this question of
  philosophy&mdash;which of all philosophies one ought to follow&mdash;he alone
  who is acquainted with the dicta of every one of them can be such a guide:
  all others must be inadequate. I would give no credence to them if they
  lacked information as to one only. If somebody introduced a fair person and
  told us he was the fairest of all men, we should not believe that, unless we
  knew that he had seen all the people in the world. Fair he might be; but,
  fairest of all&mdash;none could [161] know, unless he had seen all. And we
  too desire, not a fair one, but the fairest of all. Unless we find him, we
  shall think we have failed. It is no casual beauty that will content us; what
  we are seeking after is that supreme beauty which must of necessity be
  unique.</p>

  <p>&mdash;What then is one to do, if the matter be really thus? Perhaps you
  know better than I. All I see is that very few of us would have time to
  examine all the various sects of philosophy in turn, even if we began in
  early life. I know not how it is; but though you seem to me to speak
  reasonably, yet (I must confess it) you have distressed me not a little by
  this exact exposition of yours. I was unlucky in coming out to-day, and in my
  falling in with you, who have thrown me into utter perplexity by your proof
  that the discovery of truth is impossible, just as I seemed to be on the
  point of attaining my hope.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Blame your parents, my child, not me! Or rather, blame mother
  Nature herself, for giving us but seventy or eighty years instead of making
  us as long-lived as Tithonus. For my part, I have but led you from premise to
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Nay! you are a mocker! I know not wherefore, but you have a grudge
  against philosophy; and it is your entertainment to make a jest of her
  lovers.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Ah! Hermotimus! what the Truth may [162] be, you philosophers may
  be able to tell better than I. But so much at least I know of her, that she
  is one by no means pleasant to those who hear her speak: in the matter of
  pleasantness, she is far surpassed by Falsehood: and Falsehood has the
  pleasanter countenance. She, nevertheless, being conscious of no alloy
  within, discourses with boldness to all men, who therefore have little love
  for her. See how angry you are now because I have stated the truth about
  certain things of which we are both alike enamoured&mdash;that they are hard
  to come by. It is as if you had fallen in love with a statue and hoped to win
  its favour, thinking it a human creature; and I, understanding it to be but
  an image of brass or stone, had shown you, as a friend, that your love was
  impossible, and thereupon you had conceived that I bore you some
  ill-will.</p>

  <p>&mdash;But still, does it not follow from what you said, that we must
  renounce philosophy and pass our days in idleness?</p>

  <p>&mdash;When did you hear me say that? I did but assert that if we are to
  seek after philosophy, whereas there are many ways professing to lead
  thereto, we must with much exactness distinguish them.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well, Lucian! that we must go to all the schools in turn, and test
  what they say, if we are to choose the right one, is perhaps reasonable; but
  surely ridiculous, unless we are to live as [163] many years as the Phoenix,
  to be so lengthy in the trial of each; as if it were not possible to learn
  the whole by the part! They say that Pheidias, when he was shown one of the
  talons of a lion, computed the stature and age of the animal it belonged to,
  modelling a complete lion upon the standard of a single part of it. You too
  would recognise a human hand were the rest of the body concealed. Even so
  with the schools of philosophy:&mdash;the leading doctrines of each might be
  learned in an afternoon. That over-exactness of yours, which required so long
  a time, is by no means necessary for making the better choice.</p>

  <p>&mdash;You are forcible, Hermotimus! with this theory of The Whole by the
  Part. Yet, methinks, I heard you but now propound the contrary. But tell me;
  would Pheidias when he saw the lion&rsquo;s talon have known that it was a
  lion&rsquo;s, if he had never seen the animal? Surely, the cause of his
  recognising the part was his knowledge of the whole. There is a way of
  choosing one&rsquo;s philosophy even less troublesome than yours. Put the
  names of all the philosophers into an urn. Then call a little child, and let
  him draw the name of the philosopher you shall follow all the rest of your
  days.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Nay! be serious with me. Tell me; did you ever buy wine?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Surely.</p>

  <p>&mdash;And did you first go the whole round of [164] the wine- merchants,
  tasting and comparing their wines?</p>

  <p>&mdash;By no means.</p>

  <p>&mdash;No! You were contented to order the first good wine you found at
  your price. By tasting a little you were ascertained of the quality of the
  whole cask. How if you had gone to each of the merchants in turn, and said,
  &rsquo;I wish to buy a cotyle of wine. Let me drink out the whole cask. Then
  I shall be able to tell which is best, and where I ought to buy.&rsquo; Yet
  this is what you would do with the philosophies. Why drain the cask when you
  might taste, and see?</p>

  <p>&mdash;How slippery you are; how you escape from one&rsquo;s fingers!
  Still, you have given me an advantage, and are in your own trap.</p>

  <p>&mdash;How so?</p>

  <p>&mdash;Thus! You take a common object known to every one, and make wine
  the figure of a thing which presents the greatest variety in itself, and
  about which all men are at variance, because it is an unseen and difficult
  thing. I hardly know wherein philosophy and wine are alike unless it be in
  this, that the philosophers exchange their ware for money, like the wine-
  merchants; some of them with a mixture of water or worse, or giving short
  measure. However, let us consider your parallel. The wine in the cask, you
  say, is of one kind throughout. But have the philosophers&mdash;has your own
  [165] master even&mdash;but one and the same thing only to tell you, every
  day and all days, on a subject so manifold? Otherwise, how can you know the
  whole by the tasting of one part? The whole is not the same&mdash;Ah! and it
  may be that God has hidden the good wine of philosophy at the bottom of the
  cask. You must drain it to the end if you are to find those drops of divine
  sweetness you seem so much to thirst for! Yourself, after drinking so deeply,
  are still but at the beginning, as you said. But is not philosophy rather
  like this? Keep the figure of the merchant and the cask: but let it be
  filled, not with wine, but with every sort of grain. You come to buy. The
  merchant hands you a little of the wheat which lies at the top. Could you
  tell by looking at that, whether the chick-peas were clean, the lentils
  tender, the beans full? And then, whereas in selecting our wine we risk only
  our money; in selecting our philosophy we risk ourselves, as you told
  me--might ourselves sink into the dregs of &lsquo;the vulgar herd.&rsquo;
  Moreover, while you may not drain the whole cask of wine by way of tasting,
  Wisdom grows no less by the depth of your drinking. Nay! if you take of her,
  she is increased thereby.</p>

  <p>And then I have another similitude to propose, as regards this tasting of
  philosophy. Don&rsquo;t think I blaspheme her if I say that it may be with
  her as with some deadly poison, [166] hemlock or aconite. These too, though
  they cause death, yet kill not if one tastes but a minute portion. You would
  suppose that the tiniest particle must be sufficient.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Be it as you will, Lucian! One must live a hundred years: one must
  sustain all this labour; otherwise philosophy is unattainable.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Not so! Though there were nothing strange in that, if it be true,
  as you said at first, that Life is short and art is long. But now you take it
  hard that we are not to see you this very day, before the sun goes down, a
  Chrysippus, a Pythagoras, a Plato.</p>

  <p>&mdash;You overtake me, Lucian! and drive me into a corner; in jealousy of
  heart, I believe, because I have made some progress in doctrine whereas you
  have neglected yourself.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Well! Don&rsquo;t attend to me! Treat me as a Corybant, a fanatic:
  and do you go forward on this road of yours. Finish the journey in accordance
  with the view you had of these matters at the beginning of it. Only, be
  assured that my judgment on it will remain unchanged. Reason still says, that
  without criticism, without a clear, exact, unbiassed intelligence to try
  them, all those theories&mdash;all things&mdash;will have been seen but in
  vain. &lsquo;To that end,&rsquo; she tells us, &rsquo;much time is necessary,
  many delays of judgment, a cautious gait; repeated inspection.&rsquo; And we
  are not to regard the outward appearance, or the reputation of wisdom, in any
  of the [167] speakers; but like the judges of Areopagus, who try their causes
  in the darkness of the night, look only to what they say.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Philosophy, then, is impossible, or possible only in another
  life!</p>

  <p>&mdash;Hermotimus! I grieve to tell you that all this even, may be in
  truth insufficient. After all, we may deceive ourselves in the belief that we
  have found something:&mdash;like the fishermen! Again and again they let down
  the net. At last they feel something heavy, and with vast labour draw up, not
  a load of fish, but only a pot full of sand, or a great stone.</p>

  <p>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean by the net. It is plain that
  you have caught me in it.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Try to get out! You can swim as well as another. We may go to all
  philosophers in turn and make trial of them. Still, I, for my part, hold it
  by no mean certain that any one of them really possesses what we seek. The
  truth may be a thing that not one of them has yet found. You have twenty
  beans in your hand, and you bid ten persons guess how many: one says five,
  another fifteen; it is possible that one of them may tell the true number;
  but it is not impossible that all may be wrong. So it is with the
  philosophers. All alike are in search of Happiness&mdash;what kind of thing
  it is. One says one thing, one another: it is pleasure; it is
  virtue;&mdash;what not? And Happiness may indeed be one of those things. But
  it is possible [168] also that it may be still something else, different and
  distinct from them all.</p>

  <p>&mdash;What is this?&mdash;There is something, I know not how, very sad
  and disheartening in what you say. We seem to have come round in a circle to
  the spot whence we started, and to our first incertitude. Ah! Lucian, what
  have you done to me? You have proved my priceless pearl to be but ashes, and
  all my past labour to have been in vain.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Reflect, my friend, that you are not the first person who has thus
  failed of the good thing he hoped for. All philosophers, so to speak, are but
  fighting about the &lsquo;ass&rsquo;s shadow.&rsquo; To me you seem like one
  who should weep, and reproach fortune because he is not able to climb up into
  heaven, or go down into the sea by Sicily and come up at Cyprus, or sail on
  wings in one day from Greece to India. And the true cause of his trouble is
  that he has based his hope on what he has seen in a dream, or his own fancy
  has put together; without previous thought whether what he desires is in
  itself attainable and within the compass of human nature. Even so, methinks,
  has it happened with you. As you dreamed, so largely, of those wonderful
  things, came Reason, and woke you up from sleep, a little roughly: and then
  you are angry with Reason, your eyes being still but half open, and find it
  hard to shake off sleep for the pleasure of what you saw therein. Only, [169]
  don&rsquo;t be angry with me, because, as a friend, I would not suffer you to
  pass your life in a dream, pleasant perhaps, but still only a
  dream&mdash;because I wake you up and demand that you should busy yourself
  with the proper business of life, and send you to it possessed of common
  sense. What your soul was full of just now is not very different from those
  Gorgons and Chimaeras and the like, which the poets and the painters
  construct for us, fancy- free:&mdash;things which never were, and never will
  be, though many believe in them, and all like to see and hear of them, just
  because they are so strange and odd.</p>

  <p>And you too, methinks, having heard from some such maker of marvels of a
  certain woman of a fairness beyond nature&mdash;beyond the Graces, beyond
  Venus Urania herself&mdash;asked not if he spoke truth, and whether this
  woman be really alive in the world, but straightway fell in love with her; as
  they say that Medea was enamoured of Jason in a dream. And what more than
  anything else seduced you, and others like you, into that passion, for a vain
  idol of the fancy, is, that he who told you about that fair woman, from the
  very moment when you first believed that what he said was true, brought
  forward all the rest in consequent order. Upon her alone your eyes were
  fixed; by her he led you along, when once you had given him a hold upon
  you&mdash;led you along the straight road, as he said, to the beloved one.
  All was easy after that. [170] None of you asked again whether it was the
  true way; following one after another, like sheep led by the green bough in
  the hand of the shepherd. He moved you hither and thither with his finger, as
  easily as water spilt on a table!</p>

  <p>My friend! Be not so lengthy in preparing the banquet, lest you die of
  hunger! I saw one who poured water into a mortar, and ground it with all his
  might with a pestle of iron, fancying he did a thing useful and necessary;
  but it remained water only, none the less.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Just there the conversation broke off suddenly, and the disputants parted.
  The horses were come for Lucian. The boy went on his way, and Marius onward,
  to visit a friend whose abode lay further. As he returned to Rome towards
  evening the melancholy aspect, natural to a city of the dead, had triumphed
  over the superficial gaudiness of the early day. He could almost have fancied
  Canidia there, picking her way among the rickety lamps, to rifle some
  neglected or ruined tomb; for these tombs were not all equally well cared for
  (Post mortem nescio!) and it had been one of the pieties of Aurelius to frame
  a severe law to prevent the defacing of such monuments. To Marius there
  seemed to be some new meaning in that terror of isolation, of being left
  alone in these places, of which the sepulchral inscriptions were so full. A
  blood-red sunset was dying angrily, and its wild glare upon the shadowy
  objects around helped to combine [171] the associations of this famous way,
  its deeply graven marks of immemorial travel, together with the earnest
  questions of the morning as to the true way of that other sort of travelling,
  around an image, almost ghastly in the traces of its great
  sorrows&mdash;bearing along for ever, on bleeding feet, the instrument of its
  punishment&mdash;which was all Marius could recall distinctly of a certain
  Christian legend he had heard. The legend told of an encounter at this very
  spot, of two wayfarers on the Appian Way, as also upon some very dimly
  discerned mental journey, altogether different from himself and his late
  companions&mdash;an encounter between Love, literally fainting by the road,
  and Love &ldquo;travelling in the greatness of his strength,&rdquo; Love
  itself, suddenly appearing to sustain that other. A strange contrast to
  anything actually presented in that morning&rsquo;s conversation, it seemed
  nevertheless to echo its very words&mdash;&ldquo;Do they never come down
  again,&rdquo; he heard once more the well-modulated voice: &ldquo;Do they
  never come down again from the heights, to help those whom they left here
  below?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And we too desire, not a fair one, but the fairest
  of all. Unless we find him, we shall think we have failed.&rdquo;</p>

  &mdash;Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, Book 1, line 462.</small>&lt;(p&gt;</p>

  <p class="first">[172] It was become a habit with Marius&mdash;one of his
  modernisms&mdash; developed by his assistance at the Emperor&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;conversations with himself,&rdquo; to keep a register of the movements
  of his own private thoughts and humours; not continuously indeed, yet
  sometimes for lengthy intervals, during which it was no idle self-indulgence,
  but a necessity of his intellectual life, to &ldquo;confess himself,&rdquo;
  with an intimacy, seemingly rare among the ancients; ancient writers, at all
  events, having been jealous, for the most part, of affording us so much as a
  glimpse of that interior self, which in many cases would have actually
  doubled the interest of their objective informations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If a particular tutelary or genius,&rdquo; writes
  Marius,&mdash;&ldquo;according to old belief, walks through life beside each
  one of us, mine is very certainly a capricious creature. He fills one with
  wayward, unaccountable, yet quite irresistible humours, [173] and seems
  always to be in collusion with some outward circumstance, often trivial
  enough in itself&mdash;the condition of the weather, forsooth!&mdash;the
  people one meets by chance&mdash;the things one happens to overhear them say,
  veritable <i>enodioi symboloi</i>, or omens by the wayside, as the old Greeks
  fancied&mdash;to push on the unreasonable prepossessions of the moment into
  weighty motives. It was doubtless a quite explicable, physical fatigue that
  presented me to myself, on awaking this morning, so lack-lustre and trite.
  But I must needs take my petulance, contrasting it with my accustomed morning
  hopefulness, as a sign of the ageing of appetite, of a decay in the very
  capacity of enjoyment. We need some imaginative stimulus, some not impossible
  ideal such as may shape vague hope, and transform it into effective desire,
  to carry us year after year, without disgust, through the routine-work which
  is so large a part of life. &ldquo;Then, how if appetite, be it for real or
  ideal, should itself fail one after awhile? Ah, yes! is it of cold always
  that men die; and on some of us it creeps very gradually. In truth, I can
  remember just such a lack-lustre condition of feeling once or twice before.
  But I note, that it was accompanied then by an odd indifference, as the
  thought of them occurred to me, in regard to the sufferings of others&mdash;a
  kind of callousness, so unusual with me, as at once to mark the humour it
  accompanied as a palpably morbid one [174] that could not last. Were those
  sufferings, great or little, I asked myself then, of more real consequence to
  them than mine to me, as I remind myself that &rsquo;nothing that will end is
  really long&rsquo;&mdash;long enough to be thought of importance? But to-day,
  my own sense of fatigue, the pity I conceive for myself, disposed me strongly
  to a tenderness for others. For a moment the whole world seemed to present
  itself as a hospital of sick persons; many of them sick in mind; all of whom
  it would be a brutality not to humour, not to indulge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, when I went out to walk off my wayward fancies, did I confront
  the very sort of incident (my unfortunate genius had surely beckoned it from
  afar to vex me) likely to irritate them further? A party of men were coming
  down the street. They were leading a fine race-horse; a handsome beast, but
  badly hurt somewhere, in the circus, and useless. They were taking him to
  slaughter; and I think the animal knew it: he cast such looks, as if of mad
  appeal, to those who passed him, as he went among the strangers to whom his
  former owner had committed him, to die, in his beauty and pride, for just
  that one mischance or fault; although the morning air was still so animating,
  and pleasant to snuff. I could have fancied a human soul in the creature,
  swelling against its luck. And I had come across the incident just when it
  would figure to me as the very symbol [175] of our poor humanity, in its
  capacities for pain, its wretched accidents, and those imperfect sympathies,
  which can never quite identify us with one another; the very power of
  utterance and appeal to others seeming to fail us, in proportion as our
  sorrows come home to ourselves, are really our own. We are constructed for
  suffering! What proofs of it does but one day afford, if we care to note
  them, as we go&mdash;a whole long chaplet of sorrowful mysteries! <i>Sunt
  lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt</i> (Here also there be tears for
  what men bear, and mortal creatures feel each other&rsquo;s sorrow
  &mdash;Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, Book 1).</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s fortunes touch us! The little children of one of those
  institutions for the support of orphans, now become fashionable among us by
  way of memorial of eminent persons deceased, are going, in long file, along
  the street, on their way to a holiday in the country. They halt, and count
  themselves with an air of triumph, to show that they are all there. Their gay
  chatter has disturbed a little group of peasants; a young woman and her
  husband, who have brought the old mother, now past work and witless, to place
  her in a house provided for such afflicted people. They are fairly
  affectionate, but anxious how the thing they have to do may go&mdash;hope
  only she may permit them to leave her there behind quietly. And the poor old
  soul is excited by the noise made by the children, and partly aware of what
  is going to happen with her. She too begins to count&mdash;one, two, three,
  five&mdash;on her trembling fingers, misshapen by a life of toil.</p>

  <p>[176] &rsquo;Yes! yes! and twice five make ten&rsquo;&mdash;they say, to
  pacify her. It is her last appeal to be taken home again; her proof that all
  is not yet up with her; that she is, at all events, still as capable as those
  joyous children.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At the baths, a party of labourers are at work upon one of the
  great brick furnaces, in a cloud of black dust. A frail young child has
  brought food for one of them, and sits apart, waiting till his father
  comes&mdash;watching the labour, but with a sorrowful distaste for the din
  and dirt. He is regarding wistfully his own place in the world, there before
  him. His mind, as he watches, is grown up for a moment; and he foresees, as
  it were, in that moment, all the long tale of days, of early awakings, of his
  own coming life of drudgery at work like this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A man comes along carrying a boy whose rough work has already
  begun&mdash;the only child&mdash;whose presence beside him sweetened the
  father&rsquo;s toil a little. The boy has been badly injured by a fall of
  brick- work, yet, with an effort, he rides boldly on his father&rsquo;s
  shoulders. It will be the way of natural affection to keep him alive as long
  as possible, though with that miserably shattered body.&mdash;&rsquo;Ah! with
  us still, and feeling our care beside him!&rsquo;&mdash;and yet surely not
  without a heartbreaking sigh of relief, alike from him and them, when the end
  comes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the alert for incidents like these, yet of necessity passing
  them by on the other side, I find [177] it hard to get rid of a sense that I,
  for one, have failed in love. I could yield to the humour till I seemed to
  have had my share in those great public cruelties, the shocking legal crimes
  which are on record, like that cold-blooded slaughter, according to law, of
  the four hundred slaves in the reign of Nero, because one of their number was
  thought to have murdered his master. The reproach of that, together with the
  kind of facile apologies those who had no share in the deed may have made for
  it, as they went about quietly on their own affairs that day, seems to come
  very close to me, as I think upon it. And to how many of those now actually
  around me, whose life is a sore one, must I be indifferent, if I ever become
  aware of their soreness at all? To some, perhaps, the necessary conditions of
  my own life may cause me to be opposed, in a kind of natural conflict,
  regarding those interests which actually determine the happiness of theirs. I
  would that a stronger love might arise in my heart!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet there is plenty of charity in the world. My patron, the Stoic
  emperor, has made it even fashionable. To celebrate one of his brief returns
  to Rome lately from the war, over and above a largess of gold pieces to all
  who would, the public debts were forgiven. He made a nice show of it: for
  once, the Romans entertained themselves with a good-natured spectacle, and
  the whole town came to see the great bonfire [178] in the Forum, into which
  all bonds and evidence of debt were thrown on delivery, by the emperor
  himself; many private creditors following his example. That was done well
  enough! But still the feeling returns to me, that no charity of ours can get
  at a certain natural unkindness which I find in things themselves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I first came to Rome, eager to observe its religion,
  especially its antiquities of religious usage, I assisted at the most
  curious, perhaps, of them all, the most distinctly marked with that
  immobility which is a sort of ideal in the Roman religion. The ceremony took
  place at a singular spot some miles distant from the city, among the low
  hills on the bank of the Tiber, beyond the Aurelian Gate. There, in a little
  wood of venerable trees, piously allowed their own way, age after
  age&mdash;ilex and cypress remaining where they fell at last, one over the
  other, and all caught, in that early May- time, under a riotous tangle of
  wild clematis&mdash;was to be found a magnificent sanctuary, in which the
  members of the Arval College assembled themselves on certain days. The axe
  never touched those trees&mdash;Nay! it was forbidden to introduce any iron
  thing whatsoever within the precincts; not only because the deities of these
  quiet places hate to be disturbed by the harsh noise of metal, but also in
  memory of that better age&mdash;the lost Golden Age&mdash;the homely age of
  the potters, of [179] which the central act of the festival was a
  commemoration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The preliminary ceremonies were long and complicated, but of a
  character familiar enough. Peculiar to the time and place was the solemn
  exposition, after lavation of hands, processions backwards and forwards, and
  certain changes of vestments, of the identical earthen
  vessels&mdash;veritable relics of the old religion of Numa!&mdash;the vessels
  from which the holy Numa himself had eaten and drunk, set forth above a kind
  of altar, amid a cloud of flowers and incense, and many lights, for the
  veneration of the credulous or the faithful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were, in fact, cups or vases of burnt clay, rude in form: and
  the religious veneration thus offered to them expressed men&rsquo;s desire to
  give honour to a simpler age, before iron had found place in human life: the
  persuasion that that age was worth remembering: a hope that it might come
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That a Numa, and his age of gold, would return, has been the hope
  or the dream of some, in every period. Yet if he did come back, or any
  equivalent of his presence, he could but weaken, and by no means smite
  through, that root of evil, certainly of sorrow, of outraged human sense, in
  things, which one must carefully distinguish from all preventible accidents.
  Death, and the little perpetual daily dyings, which have something of its
  sting, he must [180] necessarily leave untouched. And, methinks, that were
  all the rest of man&rsquo;s life framed entirely to his liking, he would
  straightway begin to sadden himself, over the fate&mdash;say, of the flowers!
  For there is, there has come to be since Numa lived perhaps, a capacity for
  sorrow in his heart, which grows with all the growth, alike of the individual
  and of the race, in intellectual delicacy and power, and which will find its
  aliment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of that sort of golden age, indeed, one discerns even now a trace,
  here and there. Often have I maintained that, in this generous southern
  country at least, Epicureanism is the special philosophy of the poor. How
  little I myself really need, when people leave me alone, with the
  intellectual powers at work serenely. The drops of falling water, a few wild
  flowers with their priceless fragrance, a few tufts even of half-dead leaves,
  changing colour in the quiet of a room that has but light and shadow in it;
  these, for a susceptible mind, might well do duty for all the glory of
  Augustus. I notice sometimes what I conceive to be the precise character of
  the fondness of the roughest working-people for their young children, a fine
  appreciation, not only of their serviceable affection, but of their visible
  graces: and indeed, in this country, the children are almost always worth
  looking at. I see daily, in fine weather, a child like a delicate nosegay,
  running to meet the rudest of brick- [181] makers as he comes from work. She
  is not at all afraid to hang upon his rough hand: and through her, he reaches
  out to, he makes his own, something from that strange region, so distant from
  him yet so real, of the world&rsquo;s refinement. What is of finer soul, of
  finer stuff in things, and demands delicate touching&mdash;to him the
  delicacy of the little child represents that: it initiates him into that.
  There, surely, is a touch of the secular gold, of a perpetual age of gold.
  But then again, think for a moment, with what a hard humour at the nature of
  things, his struggle for bare life will go on, if the child should happen to
  die. I observed to-day, under one of the archways of the baths, two children
  at play, a little seriously&mdash;a fair girl and her crippled younger
  brother. Two toy chairs and a little table, and sprigs of fir set upright in
  the sand for a garden! They played at housekeeping. Well! the girl thinks her
  life a perfectly good thing in the service of this crippled brother. But she
  will have a jealous lover in time: and the boy, though his face is not
  altogether unpleasant, is after all a hopeless cripple.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For there is a certain grief in things as they are, in man as he
  has come to be, as he certainly is, over and above those griefs of
  circumstance which are in a measure removable&mdash;some inexplicable
  shortcoming, or misadventure, on the part of nature itself&mdash;death, and
  old age as it [182] must needs be, and that watching for their approach,
  which makes every stage of life like a dying over and over again. Almost all
  death is painful, and in every thing that comes to an end a touch of death,
  and therefore of wretched coldness struck home to one, of remorse, of loss
  and parting, of outraged attachments. Given faultless men and women, given a
  perfect state of society which should have no need to practise on men&rsquo;s
  susceptibilities for its own selfish ends, adding one turn more to the wheel
  of the great rack for its own interest or amusement, there would still be
  this evil in the world, of a certain necessary sorrow and desolation, felt,
  just in proportion to the moral, or nervous perfection men have attained to.
  And what we need in the world, over against that, is a certain permanent and
  general power of compassion&mdash;humanity&rsquo;s standing force of self-
  pity&mdash;as an elementary ingredient of our social atmosphere, if we are to
  live in it at all. I wonder, sometimes, in what way man has cajoled himself
  into the bearing of his burden thus far, seeing how every step in the
  capacity of apprehension his labour has won for him, from age to age, must
  needs increase his dejection. It is as if the increase of knowledge were but
  an increasing revelation of the radical hopelessness of his position: and I
  would that there were one even as I, behind this vain show of things!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At all events, the actual conditions of our [183] life being as
  they are, and the capacity for suffering so large a principle in
  things&mdash;since the only principle, perhaps, to which we may always safely
  trust is a ready sympathy with the pain one actually sees&mdash;it follows
  that the practical and effective difference between men will lie in their
  power of insight into those conditions, their power of sympathy. The future
  will be with those who have most of it; while for the present, as I persuade
  myself, those who have much of it, have something to hold by, even in the
  dissolution of a world, or in that dissolution of self, which is, for every
  one, no less than the dissolution of the world it represents for him. Nearly
  all of us, I suppose, have had our moments, in which any effective sympathy
  for us on the part of others has seemed impossible; in which our pain has
  seemed a stupid outrage upon us, like some overwhelming physical violence,
  from which we could take refuge, at best, only in some mere general sense of
  goodwill&mdash;somewhere in the world perhaps. And then, to one&rsquo;s
  surprise, the discovery of that goodwill, if it were only in a not unfriendly
  animal, may seem to have explained, to have actually justified to us, the
  fact of our pain. There have been occasions, certainly, when I have felt that
  if others cared for me as I cared for them, it would be, not so much a
  consolation, as an equivalent, for what one has lost or suffered: a realised
  profit on the summing up [184] of one&rsquo;s accounts: a touching of that
  absolute ground amid all the changes of phenomena, such as our philosophers
  have of late confessed themselves quite unable to discover. In the mere
  clinging of human creatures to each other, nay! in one&rsquo;s own solitary
  self-pity, amid the effects even of what might appear irredeemable loss, I
  seem to touch the eternal. Something in that pitiful contact, something new
  and true, fact or apprehension of fact, is educed, which, on a review of all
  the perplexities of life, satisfies our moral sense, and removes that
  appearance of unkindness in the soul of things themselves, and assures us
  that not everything has been in vain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I know not how, but in the thought thus suggested, I seem to
  take up, and re-knit myself to, a well-remembered hour, when by some gracious
  accident&mdash;it was on a journey&mdash;all things about me fell into a more
  perfect harmony than is their wont. Everything seemed to be, for a moment,
  after all, almost for the best. Through the train of my thoughts, one against
  another, it was as if I became aware of the dominant power of another person
  in controversy, wrestling with me. I seem to be come round to the point at
  which I left off then. The antagonist has closed with me again. A protest
  comes, out of the very depths of man&rsquo;s radically hopeless condition in
  the world, with the energy of one of those suffering yet prevailing [185]
  deities, of which old poetry tells. Dared one hope that there is a heart,
  even as ours, in that divine &lsquo;Assistant&rsquo; of one&rsquo;s
  thoughts&mdash;a heart even as mine, behind this vain show of
  things!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE MARTYRS</h2>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>&ldquo;Ah! voil les mes qu&rsquo;il falloit a la
  mienne!&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Rousseau.</small></p>

  <p class="first">[186] THE charm of its poetry, a poetry of the affections,
  wonderfully fresh in the midst of a threadbare world, would have led Marius,
  if nothing else had done so, again and again, to Cecilia&rsquo;s house. He
  found a range of intellectual pleasures, altogether new to him, in the
  sympathy of that pure and elevated soul. Elevation of soul, generosity,
  humanity&mdash;little by little it came to seem to him as if these existed
  nowhere else. The sentiment of maternity, above all, as it might be
  understood there,&mdash;its claims, with the claims of all natural feeling
  everywhere, down to the sheep bleating on the hills, nay! even to the
  mother-wolf, in her hungry cave&mdash;seemed to have been vindicated, to have
  been enforced anew, by the sanction of some divine pattern thereof. He saw
  its legitimate place in the world given at last to the bare capacity for
  [187] suffering in any creature, however feeble or apparently useless. In
  this chivalry, seeming to leave the world&rsquo;s heroism a mere property of
  the stage, in this so scrupulous fidelity to what could not help itself,
  could scarcely claim not to be forgotten, what a contrast to the hard
  contempt of one&rsquo;s own or other&rsquo;s pain, of death, of glory even,
  in those discourses of Aurelius!</p>

  <p>But if Marius thought at times that some long-cherished desires were now
  about to blossom for him, in the sort of home he had sometimes pictured to
  himself, the very charm of which would lie in its contrast to any random
  affections: that in this woman, to whom children instinctively clung, he
  might find such a sister, at least, as he had always longed for; there were
  also circumstances which reminded him that a certain rule forbidding second
  marriages, was among these people still in force; ominous incidents,
  moreover, warning a susceptible conscience not to mix together the spirit and
  the flesh, nor make the matter of a heavenly banquet serve for earthly meat
  and drink.</p>

  <p>One day he found Cecilia occupied with the burial of one of the children
  of her household. It was from the tiny brow of such a child, as he now heard,
  that the new light had first shone forth upon them&mdash;through the light of
  mere physical life, glowing there again, when the child was dead, or supposed
  to be dead. The [188] aged servant of Christ had arrived in the midst of
  their noisy grief; and mounting to the little chamber where it lay, had
  returned, not long afterwards, with the child stirring in his arms as he
  descended the stair rapidly; bursting open the closely-wound folds of the
  shroud and scattering the funeral flowers from them, as the soul kindled once
  more through its limbs.</p>

  <p>Old Roman common-sense had taught people to occupy their thoughts as
  little as might be with children who died young. Here, to-day, however, in
  this curious house, all thoughts were tenderly bent on the little waxen
  figure, yet with a kind of exultation and joy, notwithstanding the loud
  weeping of the mother. The other children, its late companions, broke with
  it, suddenly, into the place where the deep black bed lay open to receive it.
  Pushing away the grim fossores, the grave-diggers, they ranged themselves
  around it in order, and chanted that old psalm of theirs&mdash;Laudate pueri
  dominum! Dead children, children&rsquo;s graves&mdash;Marius had been always
  half aware of an old superstitious fancy in his mind concerning them; as if
  in coming near them he came near the failure of some lately-born hope or
  purpose of his own. And now, perusing intently the expression with which
  Cecilia assisted, directed, returned afterwards to her house, he felt that he
  too had had to-day his funeral of a little child. But it had always been his
  policy, through all his pursuit [189] of &ldquo;experience,&rdquo; to take
  flight in time from any too disturbing passion, from any sort of affection
  likely to quicken his pulses beyond the point at which the quiet work of life
  was practicable. Had he, after all, been taken unawares, so that it was no
  longer possible for him to fly? At least, during the journey he took, by way
  of testing the existence of any chain about him, he found a certain
  disappointment at his heart, greater than he could have anticipated; and as
  he passed over the crisp leaves, nipped off in multitudes by the first sudden
  cold of winter, he felt that the mental atmosphere within himself was
  perceptibly colder.</p>

  <p>Yet it was, finally, a quite successful resignation which he achieved, on
  a review, after his manner, during that absence, of loss or gain. The image
  of Cecilia, it would seem, was already become for him like some matter of
  poetry, or of another man&rsquo;s story, or a picture on the wall. And on his
  return to Rome there had been a rumour in that singular company, of things
  which spoke certainly not of any merely tranquil loving: hinted rather that
  he had come across a world, the lightest contact with which might make
  appropriate to himself also the precept that &ldquo;They which have wives be
  as they that have none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was brought home to him, when, in early spring, he ventured once more
  to listen to the sweet singing of the Eucharist. It breathed [190] more than
  ever the spirit of a wonderful hope&mdash;of hopes more daring than poor,
  labouring humanity had ever seriously entertained before, though it was plain
  that a great calamity was befallen. Amid stifled sobbing, even as the
  pathetic words of the psalter relieved the tension of their hearts, the
  people around him still wore upon their faces their habitual gleam of joy, of
  placid satisfaction. They were still under the influence of an immense
  gratitude in thinking, even amid their present distress, of the hour of a
  great deliverance. As he followed again that mystical dialogue, he felt also
  again, like a mighty spirit about him, the potency, the half-realised
  presence, of a great multitude, as if thronging along those awful passages,
  to hear the sentence of its release from prison; a company which represented
  nothing less than&mdash;orbis terrarum&mdash;the whole company of mankind.
  And the special note of the day expressed that relief&mdash;a sound new to
  him, drawn deep from some old Hebrew source, as he conjectured, Alleluia!
  repeated over and over again, Alleluia! Alleluia! at every pause and movement
  of the long Easter ceremonies.</p>

  <p>And then, in its place, by way of sacred lection, although in shocking
  contrast with the peaceful dignity of all around, came the Epistle of the
  churches of Lyons and Vienne, to &ldquo;their sister,&rdquo; the church of
  Rome. For the &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; of the church had been broken&mdash;
  broken, as [191] Marius could not but acknowledge, on the responsibility of
  the emperor Aurelius himself, following tamely, and as a matter of course,
  the traces of his predecessors, gratuitously enlisting, against the good as
  well as the evil of that great pagan world, the strange new heroism of which
  this singular message was full. The greatness of it certainly lifted away all
  merely private regret, inclining one, at last, actually to draw sword for the
  oppressed, as if in some new order of knighthood&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The pains which our brethren have endured we have no power fully to
  tell, for the enemy came upon us with his whole strength. But the grace of
  God fought for us, set free the weak, and made ready those who, like pillars,
  were able to bear the weight. These, coming now into close strife with the
  foe, bore every kind of pang and shame. At the time of the fair which is held
  here with a great crowd, the governor led forth the Martyrs as a show.
  Holding what was thought great but little, and that the pains of to-day are
  not deserving to be measured against the glory that shall be made known,
  these worthy wrestlers went joyfully on their way; their delight and the
  sweet favour of God mingling in their faces, so that their bonds seemed but a
  goodly array, or like the golden bracelets of a bride. Filled with the
  fragrance of Christ, to some they seemed to have been touched with earthly
  perfumes.</p>

  <p>[192] &ldquo;Vettius Epagathus, though he was very young, because he would
  not endure to see unjust judgment given against us, vented his anger, and
  sought to be heard for the brethren, for he was a youth of high place.
  Whereupon the governor asked him whether he also were a Christian. He
  confessed in a clear voice, and was added to the number of the Martyrs. But
  he had the Paraclete within him; as, in truth, he showed by the fulness of
  his love; glorying in the defence of his brethren, and to give his life for
  theirs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then was fulfilled the saying of the Lord that the day should come,
  When he that slayeth you will think that he doeth God service. Most madly did
  the mob, the governor and the soldiers, rage against the handmaiden Blandina,
  in whom Christ showed that what seems mean among men is of price with Him.
  For whilst we all, and her earthly mistress, who was herself one of the
  contending Martyrs, were fearful lest through the weakness of the flesh she
  should be unable to profess the faith, Blandina was filled with such power
  that her tormentors, following upon each other from morning until night,
  owned that they were overcome, and had no more that they could do to her;
  admiring that she still breathed after her whole body was torn asunder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But this blessed one, in the very midst of her
  &lsquo;witness,&rsquo; renewed her strength; and to [193] repeat, I am
  Christ&rsquo;s! was to her rest, refreshment, and relief from pain. As for
  Alexander, he neither uttered a groan nor any sound at all, but in his heart
  talked with God. Sanctus, the deacon, also, having borne beyond all measure
  pains devised by them, hoping that they would get something from him, did not
  so much as tell his name; but to all questions answered only, I am
  Christ&rsquo;s! For this he confessed instead of his name, his race, and
  everything beside. Whence also a strife in torturing him arose between the
  governor and those tormentors, so that when they had nothing else they could
  do they set red-hot plates of brass to the most tender parts of his body. But
  he stood firm in his profession, cooled and fortified by that stream of
  living water which flows from Christ. His corpse, a single wound, having
  wholly lost the form of man, was the measure of his pain. But Christ, paining
  in him, set forth an ensample to the rest&mdash;that there is nothing
  fearful, nothing painful, where the love of the Father overcomes. And as all
  those cruelties were made null through the patience of the Martyrs, they
  bethought them of other things; among which was their imprisonment in a dark
  and most sorrowful place, where many were privily strangled. But destitute of
  man&rsquo;s aid, they were filled with power from the Lord, both in body and
  mind, and strengthened their brethren. Also, much joy was in our virgin
  mother, the [194] Church; for, by means of these, such as were fallen away
  retraced their steps&mdash;were again conceived, were filled again with
  lively heat, and hastened to make the profession of their faith.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The holy bishop Pothinus, who was now past ninety years old and
  weak in body, yet in his heat of soul and longing for martyrdom, roused what
  strength he had, and was also cruelly dragged to judgment, and gave witness.
  Thereupon he suffered many stripes, all thinking it would be a wickedness if
  they fell short in cruelty towards him, for that thus their own gods would be
  avenged. Hardly drawing breath, he was thrown into prison, and after two days
  there died.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After these things their martyrdom was parted into divers manners.
  Plaiting as it were one crown of many colours and every sort of flowers, they
  offered it to God. Maturus, therefore, Sanctus and Blandina, were led to the
  wild beasts. And Maturus and Sanctus passed through all the pains of the
  amphitheatre, as if they had suffered nothing before: or rather, as having in
  many trials overcome, and now contending for the prize itself, were at last
  dismissed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Blandina was bound and hung upon a stake, and set forth as food
  for the assault of the wild beasts. And as she thus seemed to be hung upon
  the Cross, by her fiery prayers she imparted much alacrity to those
  contending Witnesses. For as they looked upon her with the eye of [195]
  flesh, through her, they saw Him that was crucified. But as none of the
  beasts would then touch her, she was taken down from the Cross, and sent back
  to prison for another day: that, though weak and mean, yet clothed with the
  mighty wrestler, Christ Jesus, she might by many conquests give heart to her
  brethren.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the last day, therefore, of the shows, she was brought forth
  again, together with Ponticus, a lad of about fifteen years old. They were
  brought in day by day to behold the pains of the rest. And when they wavered
  not, the mob was full of rage; pitying neither the youth of the lad, nor the
  sex of the maiden. Hence, they drave them through the whole round of pain.
  And Ponticus, taking heart from Blandina, having borne well the whole of
  those torments, gave up his life. Last of all, the blessed Blandina herself,
  as a mother that had given life to her children, and sent them like
  conquerors to the great King, hastened to them, with joy at the end, as to a
  marriage-feast; the enemy himself confessing that no woman had ever borne
  pain so manifold and great as hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor even so was their anger appeased; some among them seeking for
  us pains, if it might be, yet greater; that the saying might be fulfilled, He
  that is unjust, let him be unjust still. And their rage against the Martyrs
  took a new form, insomuch that we were in great sorrow for lack of freedom to
  entrust their bodies to the earth.</p>

  <p>[196] &ldquo;Neither did the night-time, nor the offer of money, avail us
  for this matter; but they set watch with much carefulness, as though it were
  a great gain to hinder their burial. Therefore, after the bodies had been
  displayed to view for many days, they were at last burned to ashes, and cast
  into the river Rhone, which flows by this place, that not a vestige of them
  might be left upon the earth. For they said, Now shall we see whether they
  will rise again, and whether their God can save them out of our
  hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE TRIUMPH OF MARCUS AURELIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">[197] NOT many months after the date of that epistle,
  Marius, then expecting to leave Rome for a long time, and in fact about to
  leave it for ever, stood to witness the triumphal entry of Marcus Aurelius,
  almost at the exact spot from which he had watched the emperor&rsquo;s solemn
  return to the capital on his own first coming thither. His triumph was now a
  &ldquo;full&rdquo; one&mdash;Justus Triumphus justified, by far more than the
  due amount of bloodshed in those Northern wars, at length, it might seem,
  happily at an end. Among the captives, amid the laughter of the crowds at his
  blowsy upper garment, his trousered legs and conical wolf-skin cap, walked
  our own ancestor, representative of subject Germany, under a figure very
  familiar in later Roman sculpture; and, though certainly with none of the
  grace of the Dying Gaul, yet with plenty of uncouth pathos in his misshapen
  features, and the pale, servile, yet angry eyes. His children, [198]
  white-skinned and golden- haired &ldquo;as angels,&rdquo; trudged beside him.
  His brothers, of the animal world, the ibex, the wild-cat, and the reindeer,
  stalking and trumpeting grandly, found their due place in the procession; and
  among the spoil, set forth on a portable frame that it might be distinctly
  seen (no mere model, but the very house he had lived in), a wattled cottage,
  in all the simplicity of its snug contrivances against the cold, and
  well-calculated to give a moment&rsquo;s delight to his new, sophisticated
  masters.</p>

  <p>Andrea Mantegna, working at the end of the fifteenth century, for a
  society full of antiquarian fervour at the sight of the earthy relics of the
  old Roman people, day by day returning to light out of the
  clay&mdash;childish still, moreover, and with no more suspicion of pasteboard
  than the old Romans themselves, in its unabashed love of open-air
  pageantries, has invested this, the greatest, and alas! the most
  characteristic, of the splendours of imperial Rome, with a reality livelier
  than any description. The homely sentiments for which he has found place in
  his learned paintings are hardly more lifelike than the great public
  incidents of the show, there depicted. And then, with all that vivid realism,
  how refined, how dignified, how select in type, is this reflection of the old
  Roman world!&mdash;now especially, in its time-mellowed red and gold, for the
  modern visitor to the old English palace.</p>

  <p>[199] It was under no such selected types that the great procession
  presented itself to Marius; though, in effect, he found something there
  prophetic, so to speak, and evocative of ghosts, as susceptible minds will
  do, upon a repetition after long interval of some notable incident, which may
  yet perhaps have no direct concern for themselves. In truth, he had been so
  closely bent of late on certain very personal interests that the broad
  current of the world&rsquo;s doings seemed to have withdrawn into the
  distance, but now, as he witnessed this procession, to return once more into
  evidence for him. The world, certainly, had been holding on its old way, and
  was all its old self, as it thus passed by dramatically, accentuating, in
  this favourite spectacle, its mode of viewing things. And even apart from the
  contrast of a very different scene, he would have found it, just now, a
  somewhat vulgar spectacle. The temples, wide open, with their ropes of roses
  flapping in the wind against the rich, reflecting marble, their startling
  draperies and heavy cloud of incense, were but the centres of a great banquet
  spread through all the gaudily coloured streets of Rome, for which the
  carnivorous appetite of those who thronged them in the glare of the mid-day
  sun was frankly enough asserted. At best, they were but calling their gods to
  share with them the cooked, sacrificial, and other meats, reeking to the sky.
  The child, who was concerned for the sorrows of one of [200] those Northern
  captives as he passed by, and explained to his comrade&mdash;
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s feeling in that hand, you know!&rdquo; benumbed and
  lifeless as it looked in the chain, seemed, in a moment, to transform the
  entire show into its own proper tinsel. Yes! these Romans were a coarse, a
  vulgar people; and their vulgarities of soul in full evidence here. And
  Aurelius himself seemed to have undergone the world&rsquo;s coinage, and
  fallen to the level of his reward, in a mediocrity no longer golden.</p>

  <p>Yet if, as he passed by, almost filling the quaint old circular chariot
  with his magnificent golden-flowered attire, he presented himself to Marius,
  chiefly as one who had made the great mistake; to the multitude he came as a
  more than magnanimous conqueror. That he had &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; the
  innocent wife and children of the dashing and almost successful rebel Avidius
  Cassius, now no more, was a recent circumstance still in memory. As the
  children went past&mdash;not among those who, ere the emperor ascended the
  steps of the Capitol, would be detached from the great progress for
  execution, happy rather, and radiant, as adopted members of the imperial
  family&mdash;the crowd actually enjoyed an exhibition of the moral order,
  such as might become perhaps the fashion. And it was in consideration of some
  possible touch of a heroism herein that might really have cost him something,
  that Marius resolved to seek the emperor once more, [201] with an appeal for
  common-sense, for reason and justice.</p>

  <p>He had set out at last to revisit his old home; and knowing that Aurelius
  was then in retreat at a favourite villa, which lay almost on his way
  thither, determined there to present himself. Although the great plain was
  dying steadily, a new race of wild birds establishing itself there, as he
  knew enough of their habits to understand, and the idle contadino, with his
  never-ending ditty of decay and death, replacing the lusty Roman labourer,
  never had that poetic region between Rome and the sea more deeply impressed
  him than on this sunless day of early autumn, under which all that fell
  within the immense horizon was presented in one uniform tone of a clear,
  penitential blue. Stimulating to the fancy as was that range of low hills to
  the northwards, already troubled with the upbreaking of the Apennines, yet a
  want of quiet in their outline, the record of wild fracture there, of sudden
  upheaval and depression, marked them as but the ruins of nature; while at
  every little descent and ascent of the road might be noted traces of the
  abandoned work of man. From time to time, the way was still redolent of the
  floral relics of summer, daphne and myrtle-blossom, sheltered in the little
  hollows and ravines. At last, amid rocks here and there piercing the soil, as
  those descents became steeper, and the main line of the Apennines, [202] now
  visible, gave a higher accent to the scene, he espied over the plateau,
  almost like one of those broken hills, cutting the horizon towards the sea,
  the old brown villa itself, rich in memories of one after another of the
  family of the Antonines. As he approached it, such reminiscences crowded upon
  him, above all of the life there of the aged Antoninus Pius, in its wonderful
  mansuetude and calm. Death had overtaken him here at the precise moment when
  the tribune of the watch had received from his lips the word Aequanimitas! as
  the watchword of the night. To see their emperor living there like one of his
  simplest subjects, his hands red at vintage-time with the juice of the
  grapes, hunting, teaching his children, starting betimes, with all who cared
  to join him, for long days of antiquarian research in the country
  around:&mdash;this, and the like of this, had seemed to mean the peace of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Upon that had come&mdash;like a stain! it seemed to Marius just
  then&mdash;the more intimate life of Faustina, the life of Faustina at home.
  Surely, that marvellous but malign beauty must still haunt those rooms, like
  an unquiet, dead goddess, who might have perhaps, after all, something
  reassuring to tell surviving mortals about her ambiguous self. When, two
  years since, the news had reached Rome that those eyes, always so
  persistently turned to vanity, had suddenly closed for ever, a strong desire
  to pray had come [203] over Marius, as he followed in fancy on its wild way
  the soul of one he had spoken with now and again, and whose presence in it
  for a time the world of art could so ill have spared. Certainly, the honours
  freely accorded to embalm her memory were poetic enough&mdash;the rich temple
  left among those wild villagers at the spot, now it was hoped sacred for
  ever, where she had breathed her last; the golden image, in her old place at
  the amphitheatre; the altar at which the newly married might make their
  sacrifice; above all, the great foundation for orphan girls, to be called
  after her name.</p>

  <p>The latter, precisely, was the cause why Marius failed in fact to see
  Aurelius again, and make the chivalrous effort at enlightenment he had
  proposed to himself. Entering the villa, he learned from an usher, at the
  door of the long gallery, famous still for its grand prospect in the memory
  of many a visitor, and then leading to the imperial apartments, that the
  emperor was already in audience: Marius must wait his turn&mdash;he knew not
  how long it might be. An odd audience it seemed; for at that moment, through
  the closed door, came shouts of laughter, the laughter of a great crowd of
  children&mdash;the &ldquo;Faustinian Children&rdquo; themselves, as he
  afterwards learned&mdash;happy and at their ease, in the imperial presence.
  Uncertain, then, of the time for which so pleasant a reception might last, so
  pleasant that he would hardly have wished to [204] shorten it, Marius finally
  determined to proceed, as it was necessary that he should accomplish the
  first stage of his journey on this day. The thing was not to be--Vale! anima
  infelicissima!&mdash;He might at least carry away that sound of the laughing
  orphan children, as a not unamiable last impression of kings and their
  houses.</p>

  <p>The place he was now about to visit, especially as the resting-place of
  his dead, had never been forgotten. Only, the first eager period of his life
  in Rome had slipped on rapidly; and, almost on a sudden, that old time had
  come to seem very long ago. An almost burdensome solemnity had grown about
  his memory of the place, so that to revisit it seemed a thing that needed
  preparation: it was what he could not have done hastily. He half feared to
  lessen, or disturb, its value for himself. And then, as he travelled
  leisurely towards it, and so far with quite tranquil mind, interested also in
  many another place by the way, he discovered a shorter road to the end of his
  journey, and found himself indeed approaching the spot that was to him like
  no other. Dreaming now only of the dead before him, he journeyed on rapidly
  through the night; the thought of them increasing on him, in the darkness. It
  was as if they had been waiting for him there through all those years, and
  felt his footsteps approaching now, and understood his devotion, quite
  gratefully, in that lowliness of theirs, in spite of its tardy [205]
  fulfilment. As morning came, his late tranquillity of mind had given way to a
  grief which surprised him by its freshness. He was moved more than he could
  have thought possible by so distant a sorrow.
  &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo;&mdash;they seemed to be saying as the hard dawn
  broke,&mdash;&ldquo;To-day, he will come!&rdquo; At last, amid all his
  distractions, they were become the main purpose of what he was then doing.
  The world around it, when he actually reached the place later in the day, was
  in a mood very different from his:&mdash;so work-a-day, it seemed, on that
  fine afternoon, and the villages he passed through so silent; the inhabitants
  being, for the most part, at their labour in the country. Then, at length,
  above the tiled outbuildings, were the walls of the old villa itself, with
  the tower for the pigeons; and, not among cypresses, but half-hidden by aged
  poplar-trees, their leaves like golden fruit, the birds floating around it,
  the conical roof of the tomb itself. In the presence of an old servant who
  remembered him, the great seals were broken, the rusty key turned at last in
  the lock, the door was forced out among the weeds grown thickly about it, and
  Marius was actually in the place which had been so often in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>He was struck, not however without a touch of remorse thereupon, chiefly
  by an odd air of neglect, the neglect of a place allowed to remain as when it
  was last used, and left in a hurry, till long years had covered all alike
  with thick dust [206]&mdash;the faded flowers, the burnt-out lamps, the tools
  and hardened mortar of the workmen who had had something to do there. A heavy
  fragment of woodwork had fallen and chipped open one of the oldest of the
  mortuary urns, many hundreds in number ranged around the walls. It was not
  properly an urn, but a minute coffin of stone, and the fracture had revealed
  a piteous spectacle of the mouldering, unburned remains within; the bones of
  a child, as he understood, which might have died, in ripe age, three times
  over, since it slipped away from among his great-grandfathers, so far up in
  the line. Yet the protruding baby hand seemed to stir up in him feelings
  vivid enough, bringing him intimately within the scope of dead people&rsquo;s
  grievances. He noticed, side by side with the urn of his mother, that of a
  boy of about his own age&mdash;one of the serving-boys of the
  household&mdash;who had descended hither, from the lightsome world of
  childhood, almost at the same time with her. It seemed as if this boy of his
  own age had taken filial place beside her there, in his stead. That hard
  feeling, again, which had always lingered in his mind with the thought of the
  father he had scarcely known, melted wholly away, as he read the precise
  number of his years, and reflected suddenly&mdash;He was of my own present
  age; no hard old man, but with interests, as he looked round him on the world
  for the last time, even as mine to-day!</p>

  <p>[207] And with that came a blinding rush of kindness, as if two alienated
  friends had come to understand each other at last. There was weakness in all
  this; as there is in all care for dead persons, to which nevertheless people
  will always yield in proportion as they really care for one another. With a
  vain yearning, as he stood there, still to be able to do something for them,
  he reflected that such doing must be, after all, in the nature of things,
  mainly for himself. His own epitaph might be that old one <i>eskhatos tou
  idiou genous</i>&mdash;He was the last of his race! Of those who might come
  hither after himself probably no one would ever again come quite as he had
  done to- day; and it was under the influence of this thought that he
  determined to bury all that, deep below the surface, to be remembered only by
  him, and in a way which would claim no sentiment from the indifferent. That
  took many days&mdash;was like a renewal of lengthy old burial rites&mdash;as
  he himself watched the work, early and late; coming on the last day very
  early, and anticipating, by stealth, the last touches, while the workmen were
  absent; one young lad only, finally smoothing down the earthy bed, greatly
  surprised at the seriousness with which Marius flung in his flowers, one by
  one, to mingle with the dark mould.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; ANIMA NATURALITER CHRISTIANA</h2>

  <p class="first">[208] THOSE eight days at his old home, so mournfully
  occupied, had been for Marius in some sort a forcible disruption from the
  world and the roots of his life in it. He had been carried out of himself as
  never before; and when the time was over, it was as if the claim over him of
  the earth below had been vindicated, over against the interests of that
  living world around. Dead, yet sentient and caressing hands seemed to reach
  out of the ground and to be clinging about him. Looking back sometimes now,
  from about the midway of life&mdash;the age, as he conceived, at which one
  begins to redescend one&rsquo;s life&mdash;though antedating it a little, in
  his sad humour, he would note, almost with surprise, the unbroken placidity
  of the contemplation in which it had been passed. His own temper, his early
  theoretic scheme of things, would have pushed him on to movement and
  adventure. Actually, as circumstances had determined, all its movement [209]
  had been inward; movement of observation only, or even of pure meditation; in
  part, perhaps, because throughout it had been something of a meditatio
  mortis, ever facing towards the act of final detachment. Death, however, as
  he reflected, must be for every one nothing less than the fifth or last act
  of a drama, and, as such, was likely to have something of the stirring
  character of a denouement. And, in fact, it was in form tragic enough that
  his end not long afterwards came to him.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the extreme weariness and depression which had followed
  those last days, Cornelius, then, as it happened, on a journey and travelling
  near the place, finding traces of him, had become his guest at White-nights.
  It was just then that Marius felt, as he had never done before, the value to
  himself, the overpowering charm, of his friendship. &ldquo;More than
  brother!&rdquo;&mdash;he felt&mdash;like a son also!&rdquo; contrasting the
  fatigue of soul which made himself in effect an older man, with the
  irrepressible youth of his companion. For it was still the marvellous
  hopefulness of Cornelius, his seeming prerogative over the future, that
  determined, and kept alive, all other sentiment concerning him. A new hope
  had sprung up in the world of which he, Cornelius, was a depositary, which he
  was to bear onward in it. Identifying himself with Cornelius in so dear a
  friendship, through him, Marius seemed to touch, to ally himself to, [210]
  actually to become a possessor of the coming world; even as happy parents
  reach out, and take possession of it, in and through the survival of their
  children. For in these days their intimacy had grown very close, as they
  moved hither and thither, leisurely, among the country-places thereabout,
  Cornelius being on his way back to Rome, till they came one evening to a
  little town (Marius remembered that he had been there on his first journey to
  Rome) which had even then its church and legend&mdash;the legend and holy
  relics of the martyr Hyacinthus, a young Roman soldier, whose blood had
  stained the soil of this place in the reign of the emperor Trajan.</p>

  <p>The thought of that so recent death, haunted Marius through the night, as
  if with audible crying and sighs above the restless wind, which came and went
  around their lodging. But towards dawn he slept heavily; and awaking in broad
  daylight, and finding Cornelius absent, set forth to seek him. The plague was
  still in the place&mdash;had indeed just broken out afresh; with an outbreak
  also of cruel superstition among its wild and miserable inhabitants. Surely,
  the old gods were wroth at the presence of this new enemy among them! And it
  was no ordinary morning into which Marius stepped forth. There was a menace
  in the dark masses of hill, and motionless wood, against the gray, although
  apparently unclouded sky. Under this sunless [211] heaven the earth itself
  seemed to fret and fume with a heat of its own, in spite of the strong night-
  wind. And now the wind had fallen.</p>

  <p>Marius felt that he breathed some strange heavy fluid, denser than any
  common air. He could have fancied that the world had sunken in the night, far
  below its proper level, into some close, thick abysm of its own atmosphere.
  The Christian people of the town, hardly less terrified and overwrought by
  the haunting sickness about them than their pagan neighbours, were at prayer
  before the tomb of the martyr; and even as Marius pressed among them to a
  place beside Cornelius, on a sudden the hills seemed to roll like a sea in
  motion, around the whole compass of the horizon. For a moment Marius supposed
  himself attacked with some sudden sickness of brain, till the fall of a great
  mass of building convinced him that not himself but the earth under his feet
  was giddy. A few moments later the little marketplace was alive with the rush
  of the distracted inhabitants from their tottering houses; and as they waited
  anxiously for the second shock of earthquake, a long-smouldering suspicion
  leapt precipitately into well-defined purpose, and the whole body of people
  was carried forward towards the band of worshippers below. An hour later, in
  the wild tumult which followed, the earth had been stained afresh with the
  blood of the martyrs Felix and Faustinus&mdash;Flores [212] apparuerunt in
  terra nostra!&mdash;and their brethren, together with Cornelius and Marius,
  thus, as it had happened, taken among them, were prisoners, reserved for the
  action of the law. Marius and his friend, with certain others, exercising the
  privilege of their rank, made claim to be tried in Rome, or at least in the
  chief town of the district; where, indeed, in the troublous days that had now
  begun, a legal process had been already instituted. Under the care of a
  military guard the captives were removed on the same day, one stage of their
  journey; sleeping, for security, during the night, side by side with their
  keepers, in the rooms of a shepherd&rsquo;s deserted house by the
  wayside.</p>

  <p>It was surmised that one of the prisoners was not a Christian: the guards
  were forward to make the utmost pecuniary profit of this circumstance, and in
  the night, Marius, taking advantage of the loose charge kept over them, and
  by means partly of a large bribe, had contrived that Cornelius, as the really
  innocent person, should be dismissed in safety on his way, to procure, as
  Marius explained, the proper means of defence for himself, when the time of
  trial came.</p>

  <p>And in the morning Cornelius in fact set forth alone, from their miserable
  place of detention. Marius believed that Cornelius was to be the husband of
  Cecilia; and that, perhaps strangely, had but added to the desire to get him
  away safely.&mdash;We wait for the great crisis which [213] is to try what is
  in us: we can hardly bear the pressure of our hearts, as we think of it: the
  lonely wrestler, or victim, which imagination foreshadows to us, can hardly
  be one&rsquo;s self; it seems an outrage of our destiny that we should be led
  along so gently and imperceptibly, to so terrible a leaping-place in the
  dark, for more perhaps than life or death. At last, the great act, the
  critical moment itself comes, easily, almost unconsciously. Another motion of
  the clock, and our fatal line&mdash;the &ldquo;great climacteric
  point&rdquo;&mdash;has been passed, which changes ourselves or our lives. In
  one quarter of an hour, under a sudden, uncontrollable impulse, hardly
  weighing what he did, almost as a matter of course and as lightly as one
  hires a bed for one&rsquo;s night&rsquo;s rest on a journey, Marius had taken
  upon himself all the heavy risk of the position in which Cornelius had then
  been&mdash;the long and wearisome delays of judgment, which were possible;
  the danger and wretchedness of a long journey in this manner; possibly the
  danger of death. He had delivered his brother, after the manner he had
  sometimes vaguely anticipated as a kind of distinction in his destiny; though
  indeed always with wistful calculation as to what it might cost him: and in
  the first moment after the thing was actually done, he felt only satisfaction
  at his courage, at the discovery of his possession of
  &ldquo;nerve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yet he was, as we know, no hero, no heroic [214] martyr&mdash;had indeed
  no right to be; and when he had seen Cornelius depart, on his blithe and
  hopeful way, as he believed, to become the husband of Cecilia; actually, as
  it had happened, without a word of farewell, supposing Marius was almost
  immediately afterwards to follow (Marius indeed having avoided the moment of
  leave-taking with its possible call for an explanation of the circumstances),
  the reaction came. He could only guess, of course, at what might really
  happen. So far, he had but taken upon himself, in the stead of Cornelius, a
  certain amount of personal risk; though he hardly supposed himself to be
  facing the danger of death. Still, especially for one such as he, with all
  the sensibilities of which his whole manner of life had been but a promotion,
  the situation of a person under trial on a criminal charge was actually full
  of distress. To him, in truth, a death such as the recent death of those
  saintly brothers, seemed no glorious end. In his case, at least, the
  Martyrdom, as it was called&mdash;the overpowering act of testimony that
  Heaven had come down among men&mdash;would be but a common execution: from
  the drops of his blood there would spring no miraculous, poetic flowers; no
  eternal aroma would indicate the place of his burial; no plenary grace,
  overflowing for ever upon those who might stand around it. Had there been one
  to listen just then, there would have come, from the very depth of his
  desolation, [215] an eloquent utterance at last, on the irony of men&rsquo;s
  fates, on the singular accidents of life and death.</p>

  <p>The guards, now safely in possession of whatever money and other valuables
  the prisoners had had on them, pressed them forward, over the rough mountain
  paths, altogether careless of their sufferings. The great autumn rains were
  falling. At night the soldiers lighted a fire; but it was impossible to keep
  warm. From time to time they stopped to roast portions of the meat they
  carried with them, making their captives sit round the fire, and pressing it
  upon them. But weariness and depression of spirits had deprived Marius of
  appetite, even if the food had been more attractive, and for some days he
  partook of nothing but bad bread and water. All through the dark mornings
  they dragged over boggy plains, up and down hills, wet through sometimes with
  the heavy rain. Even in those deplorable circumstances, he could but notice
  the wild, dark beauty of those regions&mdash;the stormy sunrise, and placid
  spaces of evening. One of the keepers, a very young soldier, won him at
  times, by his simple kindness, to talk a little, with wonder at the
  lad&rsquo;s half- conscious, poetic delight in the adventures of the journey.
  At times, the whole company would lie down for rest at the roadside, hardly
  sheltered from the storm; and in the deep fatigue of his spirit, his old
  longing for inopportune sleep overpowered him.&mdash;Sleep anywhere, and
  under any conditions, [216] seemed just then a thing one might well exchange
  the remnants of one&rsquo;s life for.</p>

  <p>It must have been about the fifth night, as he afterwards conjectured,
  that the soldiers, believing him likely to die, had finally left him unable
  to proceed further, under the care of some country people, who to the extent
  of their power certainly treated him kindly in his sickness. He awoke to
  consciousness after a severe attack of fever, lying alone on a rough bed, in
  a kind of hut. It seemed a remote, mysterious place, as he looked around in
  the silence; but so fresh&mdash;lying, in fact, in a high pasture-land among
  the mountains&mdash;that he felt he should recover, if he might but just lie
  there in quiet long enough. Even during those nights of delirium he had felt
  the scent of the new-mown hay pleasantly, with a dim sense for a moment that
  he was lying safe in his old home. The sunlight lay clear beyond the open
  door; and the sounds of the cattle reached him softly from the green places
  around. Recalling confusedly the torturing hurry of his late journeys, he
  dreaded, as his consciousness of the whole situation returned, the coming of
  the guards. But the place remained in absolute stillness. He was, in fact, at
  liberty, but for his own disabled condition. And it was certainly a genuine
  clinging to life that he felt just then, at the very bottom of his mind. So
  it had been, obscurely, even through all the wild fancies of his delirium,
  from the moment which followed [217] his decision against himself, in favour
  of Cornelius.</p>

  <p>The occupants of the place were to be heard presently, coming and going
  about him on their business: and it was as if the approach of death brought
  out in all their force the merely human sentiments. There is that in death
  which certainly makes indifferent persons anxious to forget the dead: to put
  them&mdash;those aliens&mdash;away out of their thoughts altogether, as soon
  as may be. Conversely, in the deep isolation of spirit which was now creeping
  upon Marius, the faces of these people, casually visible, took a strange hold
  on his affections; the link of general brotherhood, the feeling of human
  kinship, asserting itself most strongly when it was about to be severed for
  ever. At nights he would find this face or that impressed deeply on his
  fancy; and, in a troubled sort of manner, his mind would follow them onwards,
  on the ways of their simple, humdrum, everyday life, with a peculiar yearning
  to share it with them, envying the calm, earthy cheerfulness of all their
  days to be, still under the sun, though so indifferent, of course, to
  him!&mdash;as if these rude people had been suddenly lifted into some height
  of earthly good-fortune, which must needs isolate them from himself.</p>

  <p><i>Tristem neminen fecit</i> (He made no one unhappy)&mdash;he repeated to
  himself; his old prayer shaping itself now almost as his epitaph. Yes! so
  much the very hardest judge [218] must concede to him. And the sense of
  satisfaction which that thought left with him disposed him to a conscious
  effort of recollection, while he lay there, unable now even to raise his
  head, as he discovered on attempting to reach a pitcher of water which stood
  near. Revelation, vision, the discovery of a vision, the seeing of a perfect
  humanity, in a perfect world&mdash;through all his alternations of mind, by
  some dominant instinct, determined by the original necessities of his own
  nature and character, he had always set that above the having, or even the
  doing, of anything. For, such vision, if received with due attitude on his
  part, was, in reality, the being something, and as such was surely a pleasant
  offering or sacrifice to whatever gods there might be, observant of him. And
  how goodly had the vision been!&mdash;one long unfolding of beauty and energy
  in things, upon the closing of which he might gratefully utter his
  <i>&ldquo;Vixi!&rdquo;</i>; (I have lived!). Even then, just ere his eyes
  were to be shut for ever, the things they had seen seemed a veritable
  possession in hand; the persons, the places, above all, the touching image of
  Jesus, apprehended dimly through the expressive faces, the crying of the
  children, in that mysterious drama, with a sudden sense of peace and
  satisfaction now, which he could not explain to himself. Surely, he had
  prospered in life! And again, as of old, the sense of gratitude seemed to
  bring with it the sense also of a living person at his side.</p>

  <p>[219] For still, in a shadowy world, his deeper wisdom had ever been, with
  a sense of economy, with a jealous estimate of gain and loss, to use life,
  not as the means to some problematic end, but, as far as might be, from dying
  hour to dying hour, an end in itself&mdash;a kind of music, all-sufficing to
  the duly trained ear, even as it died out on the air. Yet now, aware still in
  that suffering body of such vivid powers of mind and sense, as he anticipated
  from time to time how his sickness, practically without aid as he must be in
  this rude place, was likely to end, and that the moment of taking final
  account was drawing very near, a consciousness of waste would come, with
  half-angry tears of self-pity, in his great weakness&mdash;a blind, outraged,
  angry feeling of wasted power, such as he might have experienced himself
  standing by the deathbed of another, in condition like his own.</p>

  <p>And yet it was the fact, again, that the vision of men and things,
  actually revealed to him on his way through the world, had developed, with a
  wonderful largeness, the faculties to which it addressed itself, his general
  capacity of vision; and in that too was a success, in the view of certain,
  very definite, well-considered, undeniable possibilities. Throughout that
  elaborate and lifelong education of his receptive powers, he had ever kept in
  view the purpose of preparing himself towards possible further revelation
  some day&mdash;towards some ampler vision, which [220] should take up into
  itself and explain this world&rsquo;s delightful shows, as the scattered
  fragments of a poetry, till then but half-understood, might be taken up into
  the text of a lost epic, recovered at last. At this moment, his unclouded
  receptivity of soul, grown so steadily through all those years, from
  experience to experience, was at its height; the house ready for the possible
  guest; the tablet of the mind white and smooth, for whatsoever divine fingers
  might choose to write there. And was not this precisely the condition, the
  attitude of mind, to which something higher than he, yet akin to him, would
  be likely to reveal itself; to which that influence he had felt now and again
  like a friendly hand upon his shoulder, amid the actual obscurities of the
  world, would be likely to make a further explanation? Surely, the aim of a
  true philosophy must lie, not in futile efforts towards the complete
  accommodation of man to the circumstances in which he chances to find
  himself, but in the maintenance of a kind of candid discontent, in the face
  of the very highest achievement; the unclouded and receptive soul quitting
  the world finally, with the same fresh wonder with which it had entered the
  world still unimpaired, and going on its blind way at last with the
  consciousness of some profound enigma in things, as but a pledge of something
  further to come. Marius seemed to understand how one might look back upon
  life here, and its [221] excellent visions, as but the portion of a
  race-course left behind him by a runner still swift of foot: for a moment he
  experienced a singular curiosity, almost an ardent desire to enter upon a
  future, the possibilities of which seemed so large.</p>

  <p>And just then, again amid the memory of certain touching actual words and
  images, came the thought of the great hope, that hope against hope, which, as
  he conceived, had arisen&mdash;<i>Lux sedentibus in tenebris</i>*&mdash;upon
  the aged world; the hope Cornelius had seemed to bear away upon him in his
  strength, with a buoyancy which had caused Marius to feel, not so much that
  by a caprice of destiny, he had been left to die in his place, as that
  Cornelius was gone on a mission to deliver him also from death.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* From the Latin Vulgate Bible, Matthew 4:16:
  <i>&ldquo;populus qui sedebat in tenebris lucem vidit magnam et sedentibus in
  regione et umbra mortis lux orta est eis.&rdquo;</i>. King James Bible
  translation: &ldquo;The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to
  them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.&rdquo;
  ]</p>

  <p>There had been a permanent protest established in the world, a plea, a
  perpetual after-thought, which humanity henceforth would ever possess in
  reserve, against any wholly mechanical and disheartening theory of itself and
  its conditions. That was a thought which relieved for him the iron outline of
  the horizon about him, touching it as if with soft light from beyond; filling
  the shadowy, hollow places to which he was on his way with the warmth of
  definite affections; confirming also certain considerations by which he
  seemed to link himself to the generations to come in the world he was
  leaving. Yes! through the survival of their children, happy parents are able
  to [222] think calmly, and with a very practical affection, of a world in
  which they are to have no direct share; planting with a cheerful good-humour,
  the acorns they carry about with them, that their grand-children may be
  shaded from the sun by the broad oak-trees of the future. That is
  nature&rsquo;s way of easing death to us. It was thus too, surprised,
  delighted, that Marius, under the power of that new hope among men, could
  think of the generations to come after him. Without it, dim in truth as it
  was, he could hardly have dared to ponder the world which limited all he
  really knew, as it would be when he should have departed from it. A strange
  lonesomeness, like physical darkness, seemed to settle upon the thought of
  it; as if its business hereafter must be, as far as he was concerned, carried
  on in some inhabited, but distant and alien, star. Contrariwise, with the
  sense of that hope warm about him, he seemed to anticipate some kindly care
  for himself; never to fail even on earth, a care for his very body-that dear
  sister and companion of his soul, outworn, suffering, and in the very article
  of death, as it was now.</p>

  <p>For the weariness came back tenfold; and he had finally to abstain from
  thoughts like these, as from what caused physical pain. And then, as before
  in the wretched, sleepless nights of those forced marches, he would try to
  fix his mind, as it were impassively, and like a child thinking over the toys
  it loves, one after another, that it [223] may fall asleep thus, and forget
  all about them the sooner, on all the persons he had loved in life&mdash;on
  his love for them, dead or living, grateful for his love or not, rather than
  on theirs for him&mdash;letting their images pass away again, or rest with
  him, as they would. In the bare sense of having loved he seemed to find, even
  amid this foundering of the ship, that on which his soul might
  &ldquo;assuredly rest and depend.&rdquo; One after another, he suffered those
  faces and voices to come and go, as in some mechanical exercise, as he might
  have repeated all the verses he knew by heart, or like the telling of beads
  one by one, with many a sleepy nod between-whiles.</p>

  <p>For there remained also, for the old earthy creature still within him,
  that great blessedness of physical slumber. To sleep, to lose one&rsquo;s
  self in sleep&mdash;that, as he had always recognised, was a good thing. And
  it was after a space of deep sleep that he awoke amid the murmuring voices of
  the people who had kept and tended him so carefully through his sickness, now
  kneeling around his bed: and what he heard confirmed, in the then perfect
  clearness of his soul, the inevitable suggestion of his own bodily feelings.
  He had often dreamt he was condemned to die, that the hour, with wild
  thoughts of escape, was arrived; and waking, with the sun all around him, in
  complete liberty of life, had been full of gratitude for his place there,
  alive still, in the [224] land of the living. He read surely, now, in the
  manner, the doings, of these people, some of whom were passing out through
  the doorway, where the heavy sunlight in very deed lay, that his last morning
  was come, and turned to think once more of the beloved. Often had he fancied
  of old that not to die on a dark or rainy day might itself have a little
  alleviating grace or favour about it. The people around his bed were praying
  fervently&mdash;<i>Abi! Abi! Anima Christiana!</i> (Depart! Depart! Christian
  Soul!). In the moments of his extreme helplessness their mystic bread had
  been placed, had descended like a snow-flake from the sky, between his lips.
  Gentle fingers had applied to hands and feet, to all those old passage-ways
  of the senses, through which the world had come and gone for him, now so dim
  and obstructed, a medicinable oil. It was the same people who, in the gray,
  austere evening of that day, took up his remains, and buried them secretly,
  with their accustomed prayers; but with joy also, holding his death,
  according to their generous view in this matter, to have been of the nature
  of martyrdom; and martyrdom, as the church had always said, a kind of
  sacrament with plenary grace.</p>
