<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; OUT TO SEA</h2>

<p class="first"> I HAD this story from one who had no business
to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive
influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning
of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that
followed for the balance of the strange tale.</p>

<p>When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much,
and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed
the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed
written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry
official records of the British Colonial Office to support many
of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.</p>

<p>I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the
happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of
it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal
characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own
belief that it <i>may</i> be true.</p>

<p>The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead,
and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with
the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story
as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various
agencies.</p>

<p>If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one
with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and
interesting.</p>

<p>From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead
man's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom
we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to
make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a
British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native
inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting
soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the
forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes
along the Congo and the Aruwimi.</p>

<p>The natives of the British Colony complained that many of
their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and
glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their
families.</p>

<p>The Englishmen in Africa went even further; saying that these
poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since when their terms
of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their
white officers, and they were told that they had yet several
years to serve.</p>

<p>And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new
post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions
centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of
black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European
power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this
story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he
ever reach his destination.</p>

<p>Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to
associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon
a thousand victorious battle fields&mdash;a strong, virile
man&mdash;mentally, morally, and physically.</p>

<p>In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were
gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of
perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army
training.</p>

<p>Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from
the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young,
intrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service
of the Queen.</p>

<p>When he received this appointment he was both elated and
appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well
merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a
stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility;
but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice
Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of
taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of
tropical Africa that dismayed and appalled him.</p>

<p>For her sake he would have refused the appointment; but she
would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and,
indeed, take her with him.</p>

<p>There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and
cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to
what they severally advised history is silent.</p>

<p>We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord
Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to
Africa.</p>

<p>A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a
small sailing vessel, the <i>Fuwalda</i>, which was to bear them
to their final destination.</p>

<p>And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife,
vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.</p>

<p>Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port
of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the
south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it
was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the
shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the
<i>Fuwalda</i> had gone down with all on board, and hence the
search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered
in longing hearts for many years.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The <i>Fuwalda</i>, a barkantine of about one hundred tons,
was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far
southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of
the sea&mdash;unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and
every nation.</p>

<p>The <i>Fuwalda</i> was no exception to the rule. Her officers
were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The
captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment
of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in
his dealings with them&mdash;a belaying pin and a
revolver&mdash;nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he
signed would have understood aught else.</p>

<p>So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John
Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the
<i>Fuwalda</i> such as they had believed were never enacted
outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the second day that the first link
was forged of what was destined to form a chain of circumstances
ending in a life for one then unborn such as has probably never
been paralleled in the history of man.</p>

<p>Two sailors were washing down the decks of the <i>Fuwalda</i>,
the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak
with John Clayton and Lady Alice.</p>

<p>The men were working backwards toward the little party who
were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came,
until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another
moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative had
never been recorded.</p>

<p>But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and
Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and
sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water-pail so
that he was drenched in its dirty contents.</p>

<p>For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an
instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the
scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet,
and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.</p>

<p>The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the
act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither
old nor small&mdash;a huge bear of a man, with fierce black
mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive
shoulders.</p>

<p>As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl,
sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single
mighty blow.</p>

<p>From scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was
mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal
career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his
pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle
towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was
almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the
sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord
Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the
weapon flash in the sun.</p>

<p>Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former
making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality
displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything
further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained
passengers.</p>

<p>The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but,
thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling,
strode aft.</p>

<p>He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the
Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could
appreciate, and which he feared&mdash;England's far-reaching
navy.</p>

<p>The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting
his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among
his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding
that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff
thanks.</p>

<p>Though the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently
well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had
turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very
apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.</p>

<p>They did not see him again for several days, nor did the
captain vouchsafe them more than the surliest of grunts when he
was forced to speak to them.</p>

<p>They messed in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate
occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties
never permitted him to eat at the same time.</p>

<p>The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little
above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to
avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his
lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.</p>

<p>This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it
also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so
that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings
which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.</p>

<p>There was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that
undefinable something which presages disaster. Outwardly, to the
knowledge of the Claytons, all went on as before upon the little
vessel, but that there was an undertow leading them toward some
unknown danger both felt, though they did not speak of it to each
other.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On the second day after the wounding of Black Michael, Clayton
came on deck just in time to see the limp body of one of the crew
being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate,
a heavy belaying pin in his hand, stood glowering at the little
party of sullen sailors.</p>

<p>Clayton asked no questions&mdash;he did not need to&mdash;and
the following day, as the great lines of a British battle-ship
grew out of the distant horizon, he half determined to demand
that he and Lady Alice be put aboard her, for his fears were
steadily increasing that nothing but harm could result from
remaining on the lowering, sullen <i>Fuwalda</i>.</p>

<p>Toward noon they were within speaking distance of the British
vessel, but when Clayton had about decided to ask the captain to
put them aboard her, the obvious ridiculousness of such a request
became suddenly apparent. What reason could he give the officer
commanding her majesty's ship for desiring to go back in the
direction from which he had just come!</p>

<p>Faith, what if he told them that two insubordinate seamen had
been roughly handled by their officers. They would but laugh in
their sleeves and attribute his reason for wishing to leave the
ship to but one thing&mdash;cowardice.</p>

<p>John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, did not ask to be transferred to
the British man-of-war, and late in the afternoon he saw her
upper works fade below the far horizon, but not before he learned
that which confirmed his greatest fears, and caused him to curse
the false pride which had restrained him from seeking safety for
his young wife a few short hours before, when safety was within
reach&mdash;a safety which was now gone forever.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon that brought the little old sailor, who
had been felled by the captain a few days before, to where
Clayton and his wife stood by the ship's side watching the ever
diminishing outlines of the great battle-ship. The old fellow was
polishing brasses, and as he came edging along until close to
Clayton he said, in an undertone:</p>

<p>" 'Ell's to pay, sir, on this 'ere craft, an' mark my word for
it, sir. 'Ell's to pay."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my good fellow?" asked Clayton.</p>

<p>"Wy, hasn't ye seen wats goin' on? Hasn't ye 'eard that
devil's spawn of a capting an' 'is mates knockin' the bloomin'
lights outen 'arf the crew?</p>

<p>"Two busted 'eads yeste'day, an' three today. Black Michael's
as good as new agin an' 'e's not the bully to stand fer it, not
'e; an' mark my word for it, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean, my man, that the crew contemplates mutiny?" asked
Clayton.</p>

<p>"Mutiny!" exclaimed the old fellow. "Mutiny! They means
murder, sir, an' mark my word for it, sir."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Hit's comin', sir; hit's comin' but I'm not a-sayin' wen, an'
I've said too damned much now, but ye was a good sort t'other day
an' I thought it no more'n right to warn ye. But keep a still
tongue in yer 'ead an' when ye hear shootin' git below an' stay
there.</p>

<p>"That's all, only keep a still tongue in yer 'ead, or they'll
put a pill between yer ribs, an' mark my word for it, sir," and
the old fellow went on with his polishing, which carried him away
from where the Claytons were standing.</p>

<p>"Deuced cheerful outlook, Alice," said Clayton.</p>

<p>"You should warn the captain at once, John. Possibly the
trouble may yet be averted," she said.</p>

<p>"I suppose I should, but yet from purely selfish motives I am
almost prompted to 'keep a still tongue in my 'ead.' Whatever
they do now they will spare us in recognition of my stand for
this fellow Black Michael, but should they find that I had
betrayed them there would be no mercy shown us, Alice."</p>

<p>"You have but one duty, John, and that lies in the interest of
vested authority. If you do not warn the captain you are as much
a party to whatever follows as though you had helped to plot and
carry it out with your own head and hands."</p>

<p>"You do not understand, dear," replied Clayton. "It is of you
I am thinking&mdash;there lies my first duty. The captain has
brought this condition upon himself, so why then should I risk
subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in probably futile
attempt to save him from his own brutal folly? You have no
conception, dear, of what would follow were this pack of
cutthroats to gain control of the <i>Fuwalda</i>."</p>

<p>"Duty is duty, my husband, and no amount of sophistries may
change it. I would be a poor wife for an English lord were I to
be responsible for his shirking a plain duty. I realize the
danger which must follow, but I can face it with you&mdash;face
it much more bravely than I could face the dishonor of always
knowing that you might have averted a tragedy had you not
neglected your duty."</p>

<p>"Have it as you will then, Alice," he answered, smiling.
"Maybe we are borrowing trouble. While I do not like the looks of
things on board this ship, they may not be so bad after all, for
it is possible that the 'Ancient Mariner' was but voicing the
desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking of real
facts.</p>

<p>"Mutiny on the high sea may have been common a hundred years
ago, but in this good year 1888 it is the least likely of
happenings.</p>

<p>"But there goes the captain to his cabin now. If I am going to
warn him I might as well get the beastly job over for I have
little stomach to talk with the brute at all."</p>

<p>So saying he strolled carelessly in the direction of the
companionway through which the captain had passed, and a moment
later was knocking at his door.</p>

<p>"Come in," growled the deep tones of that surly officer.</p>

<p>And when Clayton had entered, and closed the door behind
him:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I have come to report the gist of a conversation I heard
today, because I feel that, while there may be nothing to it, it
is as well that you be forearmed. In short, the men contemplate
mutiny and murder."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" roared the captain. "And if you have been
interfering again with the discipline of this ship, or meddling
in affairs that don't concern you you can take the consequences,
and be damned. I don't care whether you are an English lord or
not. I'm captain of this here ship, and from now on you keep your
meddling nose out of my business."</p>

<p>As he reached this peroration, the captain had worked himself
up to such a frenzy of rage that he was fairly purple of face,
and shrieked the last words at the top of his voice; emphasizing
his remarks by a loud thumping of the table with one huge fist,
shaking the other in Clayton's face.</p>

<p>Greystoke never turned a hair, but stood eyeing the excited
man with level gaze.</p>

<p>"Captain Billings," he drawled finally, "if you will pardon my
candor, I might remark that you are something of an ass, don't
you know."</p>

<p>Whereupon he turned and left the cabin with the same
indifferent ease that was habitual with him, and which was more
surely calculated to raise the ire of a man of Billings' class
than a torrent of invective.</p>

<p>So, whereas the captain might easily have been brought to
regret his hasty speech had Clayton attempted to conciliate him,
his temper was now irrevocably set in the mold in which Clayton
had left it, and the last chance of their working together for
their common good and preservation of life was gone.</p>

<p>"Well, Alice," said Clayton, as he rejoined his wife, "if I
had saved my breath I should likewise have saved myself a bit of
a calling. The fellow proved most ungrateful. Fairly jumped at me
like a mad dog.</p>

<p>"He and his blasted old ship may go hang, for aught I care;
and until we are safe off the thing I shall spend my energies in
looking after our own welfare. And I rather fancy the first step
to that end should be to go to our cabin and look over my
revolvers. I am sorry now that we packed the larger guns and the
ammunition with the stuff below."</p>

<p>They found their quarters in a bad state of disorder. Clothing
from their open boxes and bags strewed the little apartment, and
even their beds had been torn to pieces.</p>

<p>"Evidently some one was more anxious about our belongings than
we," said Clayton. "By jove, I wonder what the bounder was after.
Let's have a look around, Alice, and see what's missing."</p>

<p>A thorough search revealed the fact that nothing had been
taken but Clayton's two revolvers and the small supply of
ammunition he had saved out for them.</p>

<p>"Those are the very things I most wish they had left us," said
Clayton, "and the fact that they wished for them and them alone
is the most sinister circumstance of all that have transpired to
endanger us since we set foot on this miserable hulk."</p>

<p>"What are we to do, John?" asked his wife. "I shall not urge
you to go again to the captain for I cannot see you affronted
further. Possibly our best chance for salvation lies in
maintaining a neutral position.</p>

<p>"If the officers are able to prevent a mutiny, we have nothing
to fear, while if the mutineers are victorious our one slim hope
lies in not having attempted to thwart or antagonize them."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Alice. We'll keep in the middle of the
road."</p>

<p>As they fell to in an effort to straighten up their cabin,
Clayton and his wife simultaneously noticed the corner of a piece
of paper protruding from beneath the door of their quarters. As
Clayton stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move
further into the room, and then he realized that it was being
pushed inward by some one from without.</p>

<p>Quickly and silently he stepped toward the door, but, as he
reached for the knob to throw it open, his wife's hand fell upon
his wrist.</p>

<p>"No, John," she whispered. "They do not wish to be seen, and
so we cannot afford to see them. Do not forget that we are
keeping to the middle of the road."</p>

<p>Clayton smiled and dropped his hand to his side. Thus they
stood watching the little bit of white paper until it finally
remained at rest upon the floor just inside the door.</p>

<p>Then Clayton stooped and picked it up. It was a bit of grimy,
white paper roughly folded into a ragged square. Opening it they
found a crude message printed in uncouth letters, with many
evidences of an unaccustomed task.</p>

<p>Translated, it was a warning to the Claytons to refrain from
reporting the loss of the revolvers, or from repeating what the
old sailor had told them&mdash;to refrain on pain of death.</p>

<p>"I rather imagine we'll be good," said Clayton with a rueful
smile. "About all we can do is to sit tight and wait for whatever
may come."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE SAVAGE HOME</h2>

<p class="first"> NOR did they have long to wait, for the next
morning as Clayton was emerging on deck for his accustomed walk
before breakfast, a shot rang out, and then another, and
another.</p>

<p>The sight which met his eyes confirmed his worst fears. Facing
the little knot of officers was the entire motley crew of the
<i>Fuwalda</i>, and at their head stood Black Michael.</p>

<p>At the first volley from the officers the men ran for shelter,
and from points of vantage behind masts, wheelhouse and cabin
they returned the fire of the five men who represented the hated
authority of the ship.</p>

<p>Two of their number had gone down before the captain's
revolver. They lay where they had fallen between the
combatants.</p>

<p>Presently the first mate lunged forward upon his face, and at
a cry of command from Black Michael the bloodthirsty ruffians
charged the remaining four. The crew had been able to muster but
six firearms, so most of them were armed with boat hooks, axes,
hatchets and crowbars.</p>

<p>The captain had emptied his revolver and was reloading as the
charge was made. The second mate's gun had jammed, and so there
were but two weapons opposed to the mutineers as they rapidly
approached the officers, who now started to give back before the
infuriated rush of their men.</p>

<p>Both sides were cursing and swearing in a frightful manner,
which, together with the reports of the firearms and the screams
and groans of the wounded, turned the deck of the <i>Fuwalda</i>
to the likeness of a madhouse.</p>

<p>Before the officers had taken a dozen backward steps the men
were upon them. An axe in the hands of a burly negro cleft the
captain from forehead to chin, and an instant later the others
were down; dead or wounded from dozens of blows and bullet
wounds.</p>

<p>Short and grisly had been the work of the mutineers of the
<i>Fuwalda</i>, and through it all John Clayton had stood leaning
carelessly beside the companionway puffing meditatively upon his
pipe as though he had been but watching an indifferent cricket
match.</p>

<p>As the last officer went down he bethought him that it was
time that he returned to his wife lest some member of the crew
find her alone below.</p>

<p>Though outwardly calm and indifferent, Clayton was inwardly
apprehensive and wrought up, for he feared for his wife's safety
at the hands of these ignorant, half-brutes into whose hands fate
had so remorselessly thrown them.</p>

<p>As he turned to descend the ladder he was surprised to see his
wife standing on the steps almost at his side.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Since the beginning," she replied. "How awful, John. Oh, how
awful! What can we hope for at the hands of such as those?"</p>

<p>"Breakfast, I hope," he answered, smiling bravely in an
attempt to allay her fears.</p>

<p>"At least," he added, "I'm going to ask them. Come with me,
Alice. We must not let them think we expect any but courteous
treatment."</p>

<p>The men had by this time surrounded the dead and wounded
officers, and without either partiality or compassion proceeded
to throw both living and dead over the sides of the vessel. With
equal heartlessness they disposed of their own wounded and the
bodies of the three sailors to whom a merciful Providence had
vouchsafed instant death before the bullets of the officers.</p>

<p>Presently one of the crew spied the approaching Claytons, and
with a cry of: "Here's two more for the fishes," rushed toward
them with uplifted axe.</p>

<p>But Black Michael was even quicker, so that the fellow went
down with a bullet in his back before he had taken a half dozen
steps.</p>

<p>With a loud roar, Black Michael attracted the attention of the
others, and, pointing to Lord and Lady Greystoke, cried:</p>

<p>"These here are my friends, and they are to be left alone.
D'ye understand?</p>

<p>"I'm captain of this ship now, an' what I says goes," he
added, turning to Clayton. "Just keep to yourselves, and
nobody'll harm ye," and he looked threateningly on his
fellows.</p>

<p>The Claytons heeded Black Michael's instructions so well that
they saw but little of the crew and knew nothing of the plans the
men were making.</p>

<p>Occasionally they heard faint echoes of brawls and quarreling
among the mutineers, and on two occasions the vicious bark of
firearms rang out on the still air. But Black Michael was a fit
leader for this heterogeneous band of cutthroats, and, withal,
held them in fair subjection to his rule.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On the fifth day following the murder of the ship's officers,
land was sighted by the lookout. Whether island or mainland,
Black Michael did not know, but he announced to Clayton that if
investigation showed that the place was habitable he and Lady
Greystoke were to be put ashore with their belongings.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right there for a few months," he explained,
"and by that time we'll have been able to make an inhabited coast
somewheres and scatter a bit. Then I'll see that yer gover'ment's
notified where you be an' they'll soon send a man-o'war to fetch
ye off.</p>

<p>"You may be all right, but it would be a hard matter to land
you in civilization without a lot o' questions being asked, an'
none o' us here has any very convincin' answers up our
sleeves."</p>

<p>Clayton remonstrated against the inhumanity of landing them
upon an unknown shore to be left to the mercies of savage beasts,
and, possibly, still more savage men.</p>

<p>But his words were of no avail, and only tended to anger Black
Michael, so he was forced to desist and make the best he could of
a bad situation.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the afternoon they came about off a
beautiful wooded shore opposite the mouth of what appeared to be
a land-locked harbor.</p>

<p>Black Michael sent a small boat filled with men to sound the
entrance in an effort to determine if the <i>Fuwalda</i> could be
safely worked through the entrance.</p>

<p>In about an hour they returned and reported deep water through
the passage as well as far into the little basin.</p>

<p>Before dark the barkantine lay peacefully at anchor upon the
bosom of the still, mirror-like surface of the harbor.</p>

<p>The surrounding shores were beautiful with semi-tropical
verdure, while in the distance the country rose from the ocean in
hill and tableland, almost uniformly clothed by primeval
forest.</p>

<p>No signs of habitation were visible, but that the land might
easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird and
animal life of which the watchers on the <i>Fuwalda's</i> deck
caught occasional glimpses, as well as by the shimmer of a little
river which emptied into the harbor, insuring fresh water in
plentitude.</p>

<p>As darkness settled upon the earth, Clayton and Lady Alice
still stood by the ship's rail in silent contemplation of their
future abode. From the dark shadows of the mighty forest came the
wild calls of savage beasts&mdash;the deep roar of the lion, and,
occasionally, the shrill scream of a panther.</p>

<p>The woman shrank closer to the man in terror-stricken
anticipation of the horrors lying in wait for them in the awful
blackness of the nights to come, when they two should be alone
upon that wild and lonely shore.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Later in the evening Black Michael joined them long enough to
instruct them to make their preparations for landing on the
morrow. They tried to persuade him to take them to some more
hospitable coast near enough to civilization so that they might
hope to fall into friendly hands. But no pleas, or threats, or
promises of reward could move him.</p>

<p>"I am the only man aboard who would not rather see you both
safely dead, and, while I know that that's the sensible way to
make sure of our own necks, yet Black Michael's not the man to
forget a favor. You saved my life once, and in return I'm goin'
to spare yours, but that's all I can do.</p>

<p>"The men won't stand for any more, and if we don't get you
landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about giving
you that much show. I'll put all your stuff ashore with you as
well as cookin' utensils an' some old sails for tents, an' enough
grub to last you until you can find fruit and game.</p>

<p>"So that with your guns for protection, you ought to be able
to live here easy enough until help comes. When I get safely hid
away I'll see to it that the British gover'ment learns about
where you be; for the life of me I couldn't tell 'em exactly
where, for I don't know myself. But they'll find you all
right."</p>

<p>After he had left them they went silently below, each wrapped
in gloomy forebodings.</p>

<p>Clayton did not believe that Black Michael had the slightest
intention of notifying the British government of their
whereabouts, nor was he any too sure but that some treachery was
contemplated for the following day when they should be on shore
with the sailors who would have to accompany them with their
belongings.</p>

<p>Once out of Black Michael's sight any of the men might strike
them down, and still leave Black Michael's conscience clear.</p>

<p>And even should they escape that fate was it not but to be
faced with far graver dangers? Alone, he might hope to survive
for years; for he was a strong, athletic man.</p>

<p>But what of Alice, and that other little life so soon to be
launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval
world?</p>

<p>The man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity, the
fearful helplessness, of their situation. But it was a merciful
Providence which prevented him from foreseeing the hideous
reality which awaited them in the grim depths of that gloomy
wood.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were
hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for
transportation to shore.</p>

<p>There was a great quantity and variety of stuff, as the
Claytons had expected a possible five to eight years' residence
in their new home, so that, in addition to the many necessities
they had brought, were also many luxuries.</p>

<p>Black Michael was determined that nothing belonging to the
Claytons should be left on board. Whether out of compassion for
them, or in furtherance of his own self-interests, it were
difficult to say.</p>

<p>There is no question but that the presence of property of a
missing British official upon a suspicious vessel would have been
a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the
world.</p>

<p>So zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions
that he insisted upon the return of Clayton's revolvers to him by
the sailors in whose possession they were.</p>

<p>Into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit,
with a small supply of potatoes and beans, matches, and cooking
vessels, a chest of tools, and the old sails which Black Michael
had promised them.</p>

<p>As though himself fearing the very thing which Clayton had
suspected, Black Michael accompanied them to shore, and was the
last to leave them when the small boats, having filled the ship's
casks with fresh water, were pushed out toward the waiting
<i>Fuwalda</i>.</p>

<p>As the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the bay,
Clayton and his wife stood silently watching their
departure&mdash;in the breasts of both a feeling of impending
disaster and utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>And behind them, over the edge of a low ridge, other eyes
watched&mdash;close set, wicked eyes, gleaming beneath shaggy
brows.</p>

<p>As the <i>Fuwalda</i> passed through the narrow entrance to
the harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point, Lady Alice
threw her arms about Clayton's neck and burst into uncontrolled
sobs.</p>

<p>Bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny; with heroic
fortitude she had looked into the terrible future; but now that
the horror of absolute solitude was upon them, her overwrought
nerves gave way, and the reaction came.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to check her tears. It were better that
nature have her way in relieving these long-pent emotions, and it
was many minutes before the girl&mdash;little more than a child
she was&mdash;could again gain mastery of herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, John," she cried at last, "the horror of it. What are we
to do? What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"There is but one thing to do, Alice," and he spoke as quietly
as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home,
"and that is work. Work must be our salvation. We must not give
ourselves time to think, for in that direction lies madness.</p>

<p>"We must work and wait. I am sure that relief will come, and
come quickly, when once it is apparent that the <i>Fuwalda</i>
has been lost, even though Black Michael does not keep his word
to us."</p>

<p>"But John, if it were only you and I," she sobbed, "we could
endure it I know; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," he answered, gently, "I have been thinking of
that, also; but we must face it, as we must face whatever comes,
bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability to cope
with circumstances whatever they may be.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the dim
and distant past faced the same problems which we must face,
possibly in these same primeval forests. That we are here today
evidences their victory.</p>

<p>"What they did may we not do? And even better, for are we not
armed with ages of superior knowledge, and have we not the means
of protection, defense, and sustenance which science has given
us, but of which they were totally ignorant? What they
accomplished, Alice, with instruments and weapons of stone and
bone, surely that may we accomplish also."</p>

<p>"Ah, John, I wish that I might be a man with a man's
philosophy, but I am but a woman, seeing with my heart rather
than my head, and all that I can see is too horrible, too
unthinkable to put into words.</p>

<p>"I only hope you are right, John. I will do my best to be a
brave primeval woman, a fit mate for the primeval man."</p>

<p>Clayton's first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for
the night; something which might serve to protect them from
prowling beasts of prey.</p>

<p>He opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition, that
they might both be armed against possible attack while at work,
and then together they sought a location for their first night's
sleeping place.</p>

<p>A hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot, fairly
free of trees and here they decided eventually to build a
permanent house, but, for the time being, they both thought it
best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of
the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were.</p>

<p>To this end Clayton selected four trees which formed a
rectangle about eight feet square, and cutting long branches from
other trees he constructed a framework around them, about ten
feet from the ground, fastening the ends of the branches securely
to the trees by means of rope, a quantity of which Black Michael
had furnished him from the hold of the <i>Fuwalda</i>.</p>

<p>Across this framework Clayton placed other smaller branches
quite close together. This platform he paved with the huge fronds
of elephant's ear which grew in profusion about them, and over
the fronds he laid a great sail folded into several
thicknesses.</p>

<p>Seven feet higher he constructed a similar, though lighter
platform to serve as roof, and from the sides of this he
suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls.</p>

<p>When completed he had a rather snug little nest, to which he
carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage.</p>

<p>It was now late in the afternoon, and the balance of the
daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder by
means of which Lady Alice could mount to her new home.</p>

<p>All during the day the forest about them had been filled with
excited birds of brilliant plumage, and dancing, chattering
monkeys, who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful nest
building operations with every mark of keenest interest and
fascination.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that both Clayton and his wife kept a sharp
lookout they saw nothing of larger animals, though on two
occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors come
screaming and chattering from the nearby ridge, casting
affrighted glances back over their little shoulders, and evincing
as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing some
terrible thing which lay concealed there.</p>

<p>Just before dusk Clayton finished his ladder, and, filling a
great basin with water from the nearby stream, the two mounted to
the comparative safety of their aerial chamber.</p>

<p>As it was quite warm, Clayton had left the side curtains
thrown back over the roof, and as they squatted, like Turks, upon
their blankets, Lady Alice, straining her eyes into the darkening
shadows of the wood, suddenly reached out and grasped Clayton's
arm.</p>

<p>"John," she whispered, "look! What is it, a man?"</p>

<p>As Clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated, he
saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond, a great figure
standing upright upon the ridge.</p>

<p>For a moment it stood as though listening and then turned
slowly, and melted into the shadows of the jungle.</p>

<p>"What is it, John?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Alice," he answered gravely, "it is too dark
to see so far, and it may have been but a shadow cast by the
rising moon."</p>

<p>"No, John, if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque
mockery of man. Oh, I am afraid."</p>

<p>He gathered her in his arms, whispering words of courage and
love into her ears, for the greatest pain of their misfortunes,
to Clayton, was the mental anguish of his young wife. Himself
brave and fearless, yet was he able to appreciate the awful
suffering which fear entails&mdash;a rare gift, though but one of
many which had made the young Lord Greystoke respected and loved
by all who knew him.</p>

<p>Soon after, he lowered the curtain walls, tying them securely
to the trees so that, except for a little opening toward the
beach, they were entirely enclosed.</p>

<p>As it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay down
upon their blankets to try to wrest, through sleep, a brief
respite of forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Clayton lay facing the opening at the front, a rifle and a
brace of revolvers at his hand.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry of
a panther rang out from the jungle behind them. Closer and closer
it came until they could hear the great beast directly beneath
them. For an hour or more they heard it sniffing and clawing at
the trees which supported their platform, but at last it roamed
away across the beach, where Clayton could see it clearly in the
brilliant moonlight&mdash;a great, handsome beast; the largest he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>During the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful
snatches of sleep, for the night noises of a great jungle teeming
with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves on edge, so
that a hundred times they were startled to wakefulness by
piercing screams, or the stealthy moving of great bodies beneath
them.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; LIFE AND DEATH</h2>

<p class="first"> MORNING found them but little, if at all
refreshed, though it was with a feeling of intense relief that
they saw the day dawn.</p>

<p>As soon as they had made their meager breakfast of salt pork,
coffee, and biscuit, Clayton commenced work upon their house, for
he realized that they could hope for no safety and no peace of
mind at night until four strong walls effectually barred the
jungle life from them.</p>

<p>The task was an arduous one and required the better part of a
month, though he built but one small room. He constructed his
cabin of small logs about six inches in diameter, stopping the
chinks with clay which he found at the depth of a few feet
beneath the surface soil.</p>

<p>At one end he built a fireplace of small stones from the
beach. These also he set in clay and when the house had been
entirely completed he applied a coating of the clay to the entire
outside surface to the thickness of four inches.</p>

<p>In the window opening he set small branches about an inch in
diameter both vertically and horizontally, and so woven that they
formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength of
a powerful animal. Thus they obtained air and proper ventilation
without fear of lessening the safety of their cabin.</p>

<p>The A-shaped roof was thatched with small branches laid close
together and over these long jungle grass and palm fronds, with a
final coating of clay.</p>

<p>The door he built of pieces of the packing-boxes which had
held their belongings; nailing one piece upon another, the grain
of contiguous layers running transversely, until he had a solid
body some three inches thick and of such great strength that they
were both moved to laughter as they gazed upon it.</p>

<p>Here the greatest difficulty confronted Clayton, for he had no
means whereby to hang his massive door now that he had built it.
After two days' work, however, he succeeded in fashioning two
massive hard-wood hinges, and with these he hung the door so that
it opened and closed easily.</p>

<p>The stuccoing and other final touches were added after they
moved into the house, which they had done as soon as the roof was
on, piling their boxes before the door at night and thus having a
comparatively safe and comfortable habitation.</p>

<p>The building of a bed, chairs, table, and shelves was a
relatively easy matter, so that by the end of the second month
they were well settled, and, but for the constant dread of attack
by wild beasts and the ever growing loneliness, they were not
uncomfortable or unhappy.</p>

<p>At night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny
cabin, but, so accustomed may one become to oft repeated noises,
that soon they paid little attention to them, sleeping soundly
the whole night through.</p>

<p>Thrice had they caught fleeting glimpses of great manlike
figures like that of the first night, but never at sufficiently
close range to know positively whether the half-seen forms were
those of man or brute.</p>

<p>The brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become
accustomed to their new acquaintances, and as they had evidently
never seen human beings before they presently, after their first
fright had worn off, approached closer and closer, impelled by
that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the
forest and the jungle and the plain, so that within the first
month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept
morsels of food from the friendly hands of the Claytons.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>One afternoon, while Clayton was working upon an addition to
their cabin, for he contemplated building several more rooms, a
number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and
scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge. Ever
as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them, and finally
they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to
warn him of approaching danger.</p>

<p>At last he saw it, the thing the little monkeys so
feared&mdash;the man-brute of which the Claytons had caught
occasional fleeting glimpses.</p>

<p>It was approaching through the jungle in a semi-erect
position, now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon
the ground&mdash;a great anthropoid ape, and, as it advanced, it
emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking
sound.</p>

<p>Clayton was at some distance from the cabin, having come to
fell a particularly perfect tree, for his building operations.
Grown careless from months of continued safety, during which time
they had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours, he
had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin,
and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush
directly toward him, and from a direction which practically cut
him off from escape, he felt a vague little shiver play up and
down his spine.</p>

<p>He knew that, armed only with an axe, his chances with this
ferocious monster were small indeed&mdash;and Alice; O God, he
thought, what will become of Alice?</p>

<p>There was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin. He turned
and ran toward it, shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and
close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat.</p>

<p>Lady Greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin,
and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing
with almost incredible swiftness, for so large and awkward an
animal, in an effort to head off Clayton.</p>

<p>With a low cry she sprang toward the cabin, and, as she
entered, gave a backward glance which filled her soul with
terror, for the brute had intercepted her husband, who now stood
at bay grasping his axe with both hands ready to swing it upon
the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge.</p>

<p>"Close and bolt the door, Alice," cried Clayton. "I can finish
this fellow with my axe."</p>

<p>But he knew he was facing a horrible death, and so did
she.</p>

<p>The ape was a great bull, weighing probably three hundred
pounds. His nasty, close-set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his
shaggy brows, while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid
snarl as he paused a moment before his prey.</p>

<p>Over the brute's shoulder Clayton could see the doorway of his
cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of horror and
fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge, armed with
one of his rifles.</p>

<p>She had always been afraid of firearms, and would never touch
them, but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of
a lioness protecting its young.</p>

<p>"Back, Alice," shouted Clayton, "for God's sake, go back."</p>

<p>But she would not heed, and just then the ape charged, so that
Clayton could say no more.</p>

<p>The man swung his axe with all his mighty strength, but the
powerful brute seized it in those terrible hands, and tearing it
from Clayton's grasp hurled it far to one side.</p>

<p>With an ugly snarl he closed upon his defenseless victim, but
ere his fangs had reached the throat they thirsted for, there was
a sharp report and a bullet entered the ape's back between his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Throwing Clayton to the ground the beast turned upon his new
enemy. There before him stood the terrified girl vainly trying to
fire another bullet into the animal's body; but she did not
understand the mechanism of the firearm, and the hammer fell
futilely upon an empty cartridge.</p>

<p>Screaming with rage and pain, the ape flew at the delicate
woman, who went down beneath him to merciful unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously Clayton regained his feet, and without
thought of the utter hopelessness of it, he rushed forward to
drag the ape from his wife's prostrate form.</p>

<p>With little or no effort he succeeded, and the great bulk
rolled inertly upon the turf before him&mdash;the ape was dead.
The bullet had done its work.</p>

<p>A hasty examination of his wife revealed no marks upon her,
and Clayton decided that the huge brute had died the instant he
had sprung toward Alice.</p>

<p>Gently he lifted his wife's still unconscious form, and bore
her to the little cabin, but it was fully two hours before she
regained consciousness.</p>

<p>Her first words filled Clayton with vague apprehension. For
some time after regaining her senses, Alice gazed wonderingly
about the interior of the little cabin, and then, with a
satisfied sigh, said:</p>

<p>"O, John, it is so good to be really home! I have had an awful
dream, dear. I thought we were no longer in London, but in some
horrible place where great beasts attacked us."</p>

<p>"There, there, Alice," he said, stroking her forehead, "try to
sleep again, and do not worry your head about bad dreams."</p>

<p>That night a little son was born in the tiny cabin beside the
primeval forest, while a leopard screamed before the door, and
the deep notes of a lion's roar sounded from beyond the
ridge.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Lady Greystoke never recovered from the shock of the great
ape's attack, and, though she lived for a year after her baby was
born, she was never again outside the cabin, nor did she ever
fully realize that she was not in England.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would question Clayton as to the strange noises
of the nights; the absence of servants and friends, and the
strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room, but, though
he made no effort to deceive her, never could she grasp the
meaning of it all.</p>

<p>In other ways she was quite rational, and the joy and
happiness she took in the possession of her little son and the
constant attentions of her husband made that year a very happy
one for her, the happiest of her young life.</p>

<p>That it would have been beset by worries and apprehension had
she been in full command of her mental faculties Clayton well
knew; so that while he suffered terribly to see her so, there
were times when he was almost glad, for her sake, that she could
not understand.</p>

<p>Long since had he given up any hope of rescue, except through
accident. With unremitting zeal he had worked to beautify the
interior of the cabin.</p>

<p>Skins of lion and panther covered the floor. Cupboards and
bookcases lined the walls. Odd vases made by his own hand from
the clay of the region held beautiful tropical flowers. Curtains
of grass and bamboo covered the windows, and, most arduous task
of all, with his meager assortment of tools he had fashioned
lumber to neatly seal the walls and ceiling and lay a smooth
floor within the cabin.</p>

<p>That he had been able to turn his hands at all to such
unaccustomed labor was a source of mild wonder to him. But he
loved the work because it was for her and the tiny life that had
come to cheer them, though adding a hundredfold to his
responsibilities and to the terribleness of their situation.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>During the year that followed, Clayton was several times
attacked by the great apes which now seemed to continually infest
the vicinity of the cabin; but as he never again ventured outside
without both rifle and revolvers he had little fear of the huge
beasts.</p>

<p>He had strengthened the window protections and fitted a unique
wooden lock to the cabin door, so that when he hunted for game
and fruits, as it was constantly necessary for him to do to
insure sustenance, he had no fear that any animal could break
into the little home.</p>

<p>At first he shot much of the game from the cabin windows, but
toward the end the animals learned to fear the strange lair from
whence issued the terrifying thunder of his rifle.</p>

<p>In his leisure Clayton read, often aloud to his wife, from the
store of books he had brought for their new home. Among these
were many for little children&mdash;picture books, primers,
readers&mdash;for they had known that their little child would be
old enough for such before they might hope to return to
England.</p>

<p>At other times Clayton wrote in his diary, which he had always
been accustomed to keep in French, and in which he recorded the
details of their strange life. This book he kept locked in a
little metal box.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A year from the day her little son was born Lady Alice passed
quietly away in the night. So peaceful was her end that it was
hours before Clayton could awake to a realization that his wife
was dead.</p>

<p>The horror of the situation came to him very slowly, and it is
doubtful that he ever fully realized the enormity of his sorrow
and the fearful responsibility that had devolved upon him with
the care of that wee thing, his son, still a nursing babe.</p>

<p>The last entry in his diary was made the morning following her
death, and there he recites the sad details in a matter-of-fact
way that adds to the pathos of it; for it breathes a tired apathy
born of long sorrow and hopelessness, which even this cruel blow
could scarcely awake to further suffering:</p> <BR>

<p class="journal"> <I>My little son is crying for
nourishment&mdash;O Alice, Alice, what shall I do?</I></p>

<p><br>

And as John Clayton wrote the last words his hand was destined
ever to pen, he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched
arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who
lay still and cold in the bed beside him.</p>

<p>For a long time no sound broke the deathlike stillness of the
jungle mid-day save the piteous wailing of the tiny man-child.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE APES</h2>

<p class="first"> IN the forest of the table-land a mile back
from the ocean old Kerchak the Ape was on a rampage of rage among
his people.</p>

<p>The younger and lighter members of his tribe scampered to the
higher branches of the great trees to escape his wrath, risking
their lives upon branches that scarce supported their weight
rather than face old Kerchak in one of his fits of uncontrolled
anger.</p>

<p>The other males scattered in all directions, but not before
the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between
his great, foaming jaws.</p>

<p>A luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold upon a
high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at Kerchak's
feet.</p>

<p>With a wild scream he was upon her, tearing a great piece from
her side with his mighty teeth, and striking her viciously upon
her head and shoulders with a broken tree limb until her skull
was crushed to a jelly.</p>

<p>And then he spied Kala, who, returning from a search for food
with her young babe, was ignorant of the state of the mighty
male's temper until suddenly the shrill warnings of her fellows
caused her to scamper madly for safety.</p>

<p>But Kerchak was close upon her, so close that he had almost
grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into space
from one tree to another&mdash;a perilous chance which apes
seldom if ever take, unless so closely pursued by danger that
there is no alternative.</p>

<p>She made the leap successfully, but as she grasped the limb of
the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the tiny
babe where it clung frantically to her neck, and she saw the
little thing hurled, turning and twisting, to the ground thirty
feet below.</p>

<p>With a low cry of dismay Kala rushed headlong to its side,
thoughtless now of the danger from Kerchak; but when she gathered
the wee, mangled form to her bosom life had left it.</p>

<p>With low moans, she sat cuddling the body to her; nor did
Kerchak attempt to molest her. With the death of the babe his fit
of demoniacal rage passed as suddenly as it had seized him.</p>

<p>Kerchak was a huge king ape, weighing perhaps three hundred
and fifty pounds. His forehead was extremely low and receding,
his eyes bloodshot, small and close set to his coarse, flat nose;
his ears large and thin, but smaller than most of his kind.</p>

<p>His awful temper and his mighty strength made him supreme
among the little tribe into which he had been born some twenty
years before.</p>

<p>Now that he was in his prime, there was no simian in all the
mighty forest through which he roved that dared contest his right
to rule, nor did the other and larger animals molest him.</p>

<p>Old Tantor, the elephant, alone of all the wild savage life,
feared him not&mdash;and he alone did Kerchak fear. When Tantor
trumpeted, the great ape scurried with his fellows high among the
trees of the second terrace.</p>

<p>The tribe of anthropoids over which Kerchak ruled with an iron
hand and bared fangs, numbered some six or eight families, each
family consisting of an adult male with his wives and their
young, numbering in all some sixty or seventy apes.</p>

<p>Kala was the youngest wife of a male called Tublat, meaning
broken nose, and the child she had seen dashed to death was her
first; for she was but nine or ten years old.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her youth, she was large and powerful&mdash;a
splendid, clean-limbed animal, with a round, high forehead, which
denoted more intelligence than most of her kind possessed. So,
also, she had a greater capacity for mother love and mother
sorrow.</p>

<p>But she was still an ape, a huge, fierce, terrible beast of a
species closely allied to the gorilla, yet more intelligent;
which, with the strength of their cousin, made her kind the most
fearsome of those awe-inspiring progenitors of man.</p>

<p>When the tribe saw that Kerchak's rage had ceased they came
slowly down from their arboreal retreats and pursued again the
various occupations which he had interrupted.</p>

<p>The young played and frolicked about among the trees and
bushes. Some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of dead
and decaying vegetation which covered the ground, while others
turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods of earth in
search of the small bugs and reptiles which formed a part of
their food.</p>

<p>Others, again, searched the surrounding trees for fruit, nuts,
small birds, and eggs.</p>

<p>They had passed an hour or so thus when Kerchak called them
together, and, with a word of command to them to follow him, set
off toward the sea.</p>

<p>They traveled for the most part upon the ground, where it was
open, following the path of the great elephants whose comings and
goings break the only roads through those tangled mazes of bush,
vine, creeper, and tree. When they walked it was with a rolling,
awkward motion, placing the knuckles of their closed hands upon
the ground and swinging their ungainly bodies forward.</p>

<p>But when the way was through the lower trees they moved more
swiftly, swinging from branch to branch with the agility of their
smaller cousins, the monkeys. And all the way Kala carried her
little dead baby hugged closely to her breast.</p>

<p>It was shortly after noon when they reached a ridge
overlooking the beach where below them lay the tiny cottage which
was Kerchak's goal.</p>

<p>He had seen many of his kind go to their deaths before the
loud noise made by the little black stick in the hands of the
strange white ape who lived in that wonderful lair, and Kerchak
had made up his brute mind to own that death-dealing contrivance,
and to explore the interior of the mysterious den.</p>

<p>He wanted, very, very much, to feel his teeth sink into the
neck of the queer animal that he had learned to hate and fear,
and because of this, he came often with his tribe to reconnoiter,
waiting for a time when the white ape should be off his
guard.</p>

<p>Of late they had quit attacking, or even showing themselves;
for every time they had done so in the past the little stick had
roared out its terrible message of death to some member of the
tribe.</p>

<p>To-day there was no sign of the man about, and from where they
watched they could see that the cabin door was open. Slowly,
cautiously, and noiselessly they crept through the jungle toward
the little cabin.</p>

<p>There were no growls, no fierce screams of rage&mdash;the
little black stick had taught them to come quietly lest they
awaken it.</p>

<p>On, on they came until Kerchak himself slunk stealthily to the
very door and peered within. Behind him were two males, and then
Kala, closely straining the little dead form to her breast.</p>

<p>Inside the den they saw the strange white ape lying half
across a table, his head buried in his arms; and on the bed lay a
figure covered by a sail cloth, while from a tiny rustic cradle
came the plaintive wailing of a babe.</p>

<p>Noiselessly Kerchak entered, crouching for the charge; and
then John Clayton rose with a sudden start and faced them.</p>

<p>The sight that met his eyes must have frozen him with horror,
for there, within the door, stood three great bull apes, while
behind them crowded many more; how many he never knew, for his
revolvers were hanging on the far wall beside his rifle, and
Kerchak was charging.</p>

<p>When the king ape released the limp form which had been John
Clayton, Lord Greystoke, he turned his attention toward the
little cradle; but Kala was there before him, and when he would
have grasped the child she snatched it herself, and before he
could intercept her she had bolted through the door and taken
refuge in a high tree.</p>

<p>As she took up the little live baby of Alice Clayton she
dropped the dead body of her own into the empty cradle; for the
wail of the living had answered the call of universal motherhood
within her wild breast which the dead could not still.</p>

<p>High up among the branches of a mighty tree she hugged the
shrieking infant to her bosom, and soon the instinct that was as
dominant in this fierce female as it had been in the breast of
his tender and beautiful mother&mdash;the instinct of mother
love&mdash;reached out to the tiny man-child's half-formed
understanding, and he became quiet.</p>

<p>Then hunger closed the gap between them, and the son of an
English lord and an English lady nursed at the breast of Kala,
the great ape.</p>

<p>In the meantime the beasts within the cabin were warily
examining the contents of this strange lair.</p>

<p>Once satisfied that Clayton was dead, Kerchak turned his
attention to the thing which lay upon the bed, covered by a piece
of sailcloth.</p>

<p>Gingerly he lifted one corner of the shroud, but when he saw
the body of the woman beneath he tore the cloth roughly from her
form and seized the still, white throat in his huge, hairy
hands.</p>

<p>A moment he let his fingers sink deep into the cold flesh, and
then, realizing that she was already dead, he turned from her, to
examine the contents of the room; nor did he again molest the
body of either Lady Alice or Sir John.</p>

<p>The rifle hanging upon the wall caught his first attention; it
was for this strange, death-dealing thunder-stick that he had
yearned for months; but now that it was within his grasp he
scarcely had the temerity to seize it.</p>

<p>Cautiously he approached the thing, ready to flee
precipitately should it speak in its deep roaring tones, as he
had heard it speak before, the last words to those of his kind
who, through ignorance or rashness, had attacked the wonderful
white ape that had borne it.</p>

<p>Deep in the beast's intelligence was something which assured
him that the thunder-stick was only dangerous when in the hands
of one who could manipulate it, but yet it was several minutes
ere he could bring himself to touch it.</p>

<p>Instead, he walked back and forth along the floor before it,
turning his head so that never once did his eyes leave the object
of his desire.</p>

<p>Using his long arms as a man uses crutches, and rolling his
huge carcass from side to side with each stride, the great king
ape paced to and fro, uttering deep growls, occasionally
punctuated with that ear-piercing scream, than which there is no
more terrifying noise in all the jungle.</p>

<p>Presently he halted before the rifle. Slowly he raised a huge
hand until it almost touched the shining barrel, only to withdraw
it once more and continue his hurried pacing.</p>

<p>It was as though the great brute by this show of fearlessness,
and through the medium of his wild voice, were endeavoring to
bolster up his courage to the point which would permit him to
take the rifle in his hand.</p>

<p>Again he stopped, and this time succeeded in forcing his
reluctant hand to the cold steel, only to snatch it away almost
immediately and resume his restless beat.</p>

<p>Time after time this strange ceremony was repeated, but on
each occasion with increased confidence, until, finally, the
rifle was torn from its hook and lay in the grasp of the great
brute.</p>

<p>Finding that it harmed him not, Kerchak began to examine it
closely. He felt of it from end to end, peered down the black
depths of the muzzle, fingered the sights, the breech, the stock,
and finally the trigger.</p>

<p>During all these operations the apes who had entered sat
huddled near the door watching their chief, while those outside
strained and crowded to catch a glimpse of what transpired
within.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kerchak's finger closed upon the trigger. There was a
deafening roar in the little room and the apes at and beyond the
door fell over one another in their wild anxiety to escape.</p>

<p>Kerchak was equally frightened; so frightened, in fact, that
he quite forgot to throw aside the author of that fearful noise,
but bolted for the door with it tightly clutched in one hand.</p>

<p>As he passed through the opening, the front sight of the rifle
caught upon the edge of the in-swung door with sufficient force
to close it tightly after the fleeing ape.</p>

<p>When Kerchak came to a halt a short distance from the cabin
and discovered that he still held the rifle, he dropped it as he
might have dropped a red hot iron, nor did he again essay to
recover it&mdash;the noise was too much for his brute nerves; but
he was now quite convinced that the terrible stick was quite
harmless by itself if left alone.</p>

<p>It was an hour before the apes could again bring themselves to
approach the cabin to continue their investigations, and when
they finally did so, they found to their chagrin that the door
was closed and so securely fastened that they could not force
it.</p>

<p>The cleverly constructed latch which Clayton had made for the
door had sprung as Kerchak passed out; nor could the apes find
means of ingress through the heavily barred windows.</p>

<p>After roaming about the vicinity for a short time, they
started back for the deeper forests and the higher land from
whence they had come.</p>

<p>Kala had not once come to earth with her little adopted babe,
but now Kerchak called to her to descend with the rest, and as
there was no note of anger in his voice she dropped lightly from
branch to branch and joined the others on their homeward
march.</p>

<p>Those of the apes who attempted to examine Kala's strange baby
were repulsed with bared fangs and low menacing growls,
accompanied by words of warning from Kala.</p>

<p>When they assured her that they meant the child no harm she
permitted them to come close, but would not allow them to touch
her charge.</p>

<p>It was as though she knew that her baby was frail and delicate
and feared lest the rough hands of her fellows might injure the
little thing.</p>

<p>Another thing she did, and which made traveling an onerous
trial for her. Remembering the death of her own little one, she
clung desperately to the new babe, with one hand, whenever they
were upon the march.</p>

<p>The other young rode upon their mothers' backs; their little
arms tightly clasping the hairy necks before them, while their
legs were locked beneath their mothers' armpits.</p>

<p>Not so with Kala; she held the small form of the little Lord
Greystoke tightly to her breast, where the dainty hands clutched
the long black hair which covered that portion of her body. She
had seen one child fall from her back to a terrible death, and
she would take no further chances with this.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE WHITE APE</h2>

<p class="first"> TENDERLY Kala nursed her little waif, wondering
silently why it did not gain strength and agility as did the
little apes of other mothers. It was nearly a year from the time
the little fellow came into her possession before he would walk
alone, and as for climbing&mdash;my, but how stupid he was!</p>

<p>Kala sometimes talked with the older females about her young
hopeful, but none of them could understand how a child could be
so slow and backward in learning to care for itself. Why, it
could not even find food alone, and more than twelve moons had
passed since Kala had come upon it.</p>

<p>Had they known that the child had seen thirteen moons before
it had come into Kala's possession they would have considered its
case as absolutely hopeless, for the little apes of their own
tribe were as far advanced in two or three moons as was this
little stranger after twenty-five.</p>

<p>Tublat, Kala's husband, was sorely vexed, and but for the
female's careful watching would have put the child out of the
way.</p>

<p>"He will never be a great ape," he argued. "Always will you
have to carry him and protect him. What good will he be to the
tribe? None; only a burden.</p>

<p>"Let us leave him quietly sleeping among the tall grasses,
that you may bear other and stronger apes to guard us in our old
age."</p>

<p>"Never, Broken Nose," replied Kala. "If I must carry him
forever, so be it."</p>

<p>And then Tublat went to Kerchak to urge him to use his
authority with Kala, and force her to give up little Tarzan,
which was the name they had given to the tiny Lord Greystoke, and
which meant "White-Skin."</p>

<p>But when Kerchak spoke to her about it Kala threatened to run
away from the tribe if they did not leave her in peace with the
child; and as this is one of the inalienable rights of the jungle
folk, if they be dissatisfied among their own people, they
bothered her no more, for Kala was a fine clean-limbed young
female, and they did not wish to lose her.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>As Tarzan grew he made more rapid strides, so that by the time
he was ten years old he was an excellent climber, and on the
ground could do many wonderful things which were beyond the
powers of his little brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>In many ways did he differ from them, and they often marveled
at his superior cunning, but in strength and size he was
deficient; for at ten the great anthropoids were fully grown,
some of them towering over six feet in height, while little
Tarzan was still but a half-grown boy.</p>

<p>Yet such a boy!</p>

<p>From early infancy he had used his hands to swing from branch
to branch after the manner of his giant mother, and as he grew
older he spent hour upon hour daily speeding through the tree
tops with his brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>He could spring twenty feet across space at the dizzy heights
of the forest top, and grasp with unerring precision, and without
apparent jar, a limb waving wildly in the path of an approaching
tornado.</p>

<p>He could drop twenty feet at a stretch from limb to limb in
rapid descent to the ground, or he could gain the utmost pinnacle
of the loftiest tropical giant with the ease and swiftness of a
squirrel.</p>

<p>Though but ten years old he was fully as strong as the average
man of thirty, and far more agile than the most practiced athlete
ever becomes. And day by day his strength was increasing.</p>

<p>His life among these fierce apes had been happy; for his
recollection held no other life, nor did he know that there
existed within the universe aught else than his little forest and
the wild jungle animals with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>He was nearly ten before he commenced to realize that a great
difference existed between himself and his fellows. His little
body, burned brown by exposure, suddenly caused him feelings of
intense shame, for he realized that it was entirely hairless,
like some low snake, or other reptile.</p>

<p>He attempted to obviate this by plastering himself from head
to foot with mud, but this dried and fell off. Besides, it felt
so uncomfortable that he quickly decided that he preferred the
shame to the discomfort.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>In the higher land which his tribe frequented was a little
lake, and it was here that Tarzan first saw his face in the
clear, still waters of its bosom.</p>

<p>It was on a sultry day of the dry season that he and one of
his cousins had gone down to the bank to drink. As they leaned
over, both little faces were mirrored on the placid pool; the
fierce and terrible features of the ape beside those of the
aristocratic scion of an old English house.</p>

<p>Tarzan was appalled. It had been bad enough to be hairless,
but to own such a countenance! He wondered that the other apes
could look at him at all.</p>

<p>That tiny slit of a mouth and those puny white teeth! How they
looked beside the mighty lips and powerful fangs of his more
fortunate brothers!</p>

<p>And the little pinched nose of his; so thin was it that it
looked half starved. He turned red as he compared it with the
beautiful broad nostrils of his companion. Such a generous nose!
Why it spread half across his face! It certainly must be fine to
be so handsome, thought poor little Tarzan.</p>

<p>But when he saw his own eyes; ah, that was the final
blow&mdash;a brown spot, a gray circle and then blank whiteness!
Frightful! not even the snakes had such hideous eyes as he.</p>

<p>So intent was he upon this personal appraisement of his
features that he did not hear the parting of the tall grass
behind him as a great body pushed itself stealthily through the
jungle; nor did his companion, the ape, hear either, for he was
drinking and the noise of his sucking lips and gurgles of
satisfaction drowned the quiet approach of the intruder.</p>

<p>Not thirty paces behind the two she crouched&mdash;Sabor, the
huge lioness&mdash;lashing her tail. Cautiously she moved a great
padded paw forward, noiselessly placing it before she lifted the
next. Thus she advanced; her belly low, almost touching the
surface of the ground&mdash;a great cat preparing to spring upon
its prey.</p>

<p>Now she was within ten feet of the two unsuspecting little
playfellows&mdash;carefully she drew her hind feet well up
beneath her body, the great muscles rolling under the beautiful
skin.</p>

<p>So low she was crouching now that she seemed flattened to the
earth except for the upward bend of the glossy back as it
gathered for the spring.</p>

<p>No longer the tail lashed&mdash;quiet and straight behind her
it lay.</p>

<p>An instant she paused thus as though turned to stone, and
then, with an awful scream, she sprang.</p>

<p>Sabor, the lioness, was a wise hunter. To one less wise the
wild alarm of her fierce cry as she sprang would have seemed a
foolish thing, for could she not more surely have fallen upon her
victims had she but quietly leaped without that loud shriek?</p>

<p>But Sabor knew well the wondrous quickness of the jungle folk
and their almost unbelievable powers of hearing. To them the
sudden scraping of one blade of grass across another was as
effectual a warning as her loudest cry, and Sabor knew that she
could not make that mighty leap without a little noise.</p>

<p>Her wild scream was not a warning. It was voiced to freeze her
poor victims in a paralysis of terror for the tiny fraction of an
instant which would suffice for her mighty claws to sink into
their soft flesh and hold them beyond peradventure of escape.</p>

<p>In so far as the ape was concerned, Sabor reasoned correctly.
The little fellow crouched trembling just an instant, but that
instant was quite long enough to prove his undoing.</p>

<p>Not so, however, with Tarzan, the man-child. His life amidst
the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet emergencies with
self-confidence, and his higher intelligence resulted in a
quickness of mental action far beyond the powers of the apes.</p>

<p>So the scream of Sabor, the lioness, galvanized the brain and
muscles of little Tarzan into instant action.</p>

<p>Before him lay the deep waters of the little lake, behind him
certain death; a cruel death beneath tearing claws and rending
fangs.</p>

<p>Tarzan had always hated water except as a medium for quenching
his thirst. He hated it because he connected it with the chill
and discomfort of the torrential rains, and he feared it for the
thunder and lightning and wind which accompanied them.</p>

<p>The deep waters of the lake he had been taught by his wild
mother to avoid, and further, had he not seen little Neeta sink
beneath its quiet surface only a few short weeks before never to
return to the tribe?</p>

<p>But of the two evils his quick mind chose the lesser ere the
first note of Sabor's scream had scarce broken the quiet of the
jungle, and before the great beast had covered half her leap
Tarzan felt the chill waters close above his head.</p>

<p>He could not swim, and the water was very deep; but still he
lost no particle of that self-confidence and resourcefulness which
were the badges of his superior being.</p>

<p>Rapidly he moved his hands and feet in an attempt to scramble
upward, and, possibly more by chance than design, he fell into
the stroke that a dog uses when swimming, so that within a few
seconds his nose was above water and he found that he could keep
it there by continuing his strokes, and also make progress
through the water.</p>

<p>He was much surprised and pleased with this new acquirement
which had been so suddenly thrust upon him, but he had no time
for thinking much upon it.</p>

<p>He was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he saw the
cruel beast that would have seized him crouching upon the still
form of his little playmate.</p>

<p>The lioness was intently watching Tarzan, evidently expecting
him to return to shore, but this the boy had no intention of
doing.</p>

<p>Instead he raised his voice in the call of distress common to
his tribe, adding to it the warning which would prevent would-be
rescuers from running into the clutches of Sabor.</p>

<p>Almost immediately there came an answer from the distance, and
presently forty or fifty great apes swung rapidly and
majestically through the trees toward the scene of tragedy.</p>

<p>In the van was Kala, for she had recognized the tones of her
best beloved, and with her was the mother of the little ape who
lay dead beneath cruel Sabor.</p>

<p>Though more powerful and better equipped for fighting than the
apes, the lioness had no desire to meet these enraged adults, and
with a snarl of hatred she sprang quickly into the brush and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Tarzan now swam to shore and clambered quickly upon dry land.
The feeling of freshness and exhilaration which the cool waters
had imparted to him, filled his little being with grateful
surprise, and ever after he lost no opportunity to take a daily
plunge in lake or stream or ocean when it was possible to do
so.</p>

<p>For a long time Kala could not accustom herself to the sight;
for though her people could swim when forced to it, they did not
like to enter water, and never did so voluntarily.</p>

<p>The adventure with the lioness gave Tarzan food for
pleasurable memories, for it was such affairs which broke the
monotony of his daily life&mdash;otherwise but a dull round of
searching for food, eating, and sleeping.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The tribe to which he belonged roamed a tract extending,
roughly, twenty-five miles along the seacoast and some fifty
miles inland. This they traversed almost continually,
occasionally remaining for months in one locality; but as they
moved through the trees with great speed they often covered the
territory in a very few days.</p>

<p>Much depended upon food supply, climatic conditions, and the
prevalence of animals of the more dangerous species; though
Kerchak often led them on long marches for no other reason than
that he had tired of remaining in the same place.</p>

<p>At night they slept where darkness overtook them, lying upon
the ground, and sometimes covering their heads, and more seldom
their bodies, with the great leaves of the elephant's ear. Two or
three might lie cuddled in each other's arms for additional
warmth if the night were chill, and thus Tarzan had slept in
Kala's arms nightly for all these years.</p>

<p>That the huge, fierce brute loved this child of another race
is beyond question, and he, too, gave to the great, hairy beast
all the affection that would have belonged to his fair young
mother had she lived.</p>

<p>When he was disobedient she cuffed him, it is true, but she
was never cruel to him, and was more often caressing than
chastising him.</p>

<p>Tublat, her husband, always hated Tarzan, and on several
occasions had come near ending his youthful career.</p>

<p>Tarzan on his part never lost an opportunity to show that he
fully reciprocated his foster father's sentiments, and whenever
he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl insults
upon him from the safety of his mother's arms, or the slender
branches of the higher trees, he did so.</p>

<p>His superior intelligence and cunning permitted him to invent
a thousand diabolical tricks to add to the burdens of Tublat's
life.</p>

<p>Early in his boyhood he had learned to form ropes by twisting
and tying long grasses together, and with these he was forever
tripping Tublat or attempting to hang him from some overhanging
branch.</p>

<p>By constant playing and experimenting with these he learned to
tie rude knots, and make sliding nooses; and with these he and
the younger apes amused themselves. What Tarzan did they tried to
do also, but he alone originated and became proficient.</p>

<p>One day while playing thus Tarzan had thrown his rope at one
of his fleeing companions, retaining the other end in his grasp.
By accident the noose fell squarely about the running ape's neck,
bringing him to a sudden and surprising halt.</p>

<p>Ah, here was a new game, a fine game, thought Tarzan, and
immediately he attempted to repeat the trick. And thus, by
painstaking and continued practice, he learned the art of
roping.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, was the life of Tublat a living nightmare. In
sleep, upon the march, night or day, he never knew when that
quiet noose would slip about his neck and nearly choke the life
out of him.</p>

<p>Kala punished, Tublat swore dire vengeance, and old Kerchak
took notice and warned and threatened; but all to no avail.</p>

<p>Tarzan defied them all, and the thin, strong noose continued
to settle about Tublat's neck whenever he least expected it.</p>

<p>The other apes derived unlimited amusement from Tublat's
discomfiture, for Broken Nose was a disagreeable old fellow, whom
no one liked, anyway.</p>

<p>In Tarzan's clever little mind many thoughts revolved, and
back of these was his divine power of reason.</p>

<p>If he could catch his fellow apes with his long arm of many
grasses, why not Sabor, the lioness?</p>

<p>It was the germ of a thought, which, however, was destined to
mull around in his conscious and subconscious mind until it
resulted in magnificent achievement.</p>

<p>But that came in later years.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; JUNGLE BATTLES</h2>

<p class="first"> THE wanderings of the tribe brought them often
near the closed and silent cabin by the little land-locked
harbor. To Tarzan this was always a source of never-ending
mystery and pleasure.</p>

<p>He would peek into the curtained windows, or, climbing upon
the roof, peer down the black depths of the chimney in vain
endeavor to solve the unknown wonders that lay within those
strong walls.</p>

<p>His little childish imagination pictured wonderful creatures
within, and the very impossibility of forcing entrance added a
thousandfold to his desire to do so.</p>

<p>He would clamber about the roof and windows for hours
attempting to discover means of ingress, but to the door he paid
little attention, for this was apparently as solid as the
walls.</p>

<p>It was in the next visit to the vicinity, following the
adventure with old Sabor, that, as he approached the cabin,
Tarzan noticed that from a distance the door appeared as though
an independent part of the wall in which it was set, and for the
first time it occurred to him that this might prove the means of
entrance which had so long eluded him.</p>

<p>He was alone, as was often the case when he visited the cabin,
for the apes had no love for it; the story of the thunder-stick
having lost nothing in the telling during these ten years had
quite surrounded the white man's deserted abode with an
atmosphere of weirdness and terror for the simians.</p>

<p>The story of his own connection with the cabin had never been
told him. The language of the apes has so few words that they
could talk but little of what they had seen in the cabin, having
no words to accurately describe either the strange people or
their belongings, and so, long before Tarzan was old enough to
understand, the subject had been forgotten by the tribe.</p>

<p>Only in a dim, vague way had Kala explained to him that his
father had been a strange white ape, but he did not know that
Kala was not his own mother.</p>

<p>On this day, then, he went directly to the door and spent
hours examining it and fussing with the hinges, the knob and the
latch. Finally he stumbled upon the right combination, and the
door swung creakingly open before his astonished eyes.</p>

<p>For some minutes he did not dare venture within, but finally,
as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the interior he
slowly and cautiously entered.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor lay a skeleton, every vestige of
flesh gone from the bones to which still clung the mildewed and
mouldered remnants of what had once been clothing. Upon the bed
lay a similar gruesome thing, but smaller, while in a tiny cradle
nearby was a third, a wee mite of a skeleton.</p>

<p>To none of these evidences of a fearful tragedy of a long dead
day did little Tarzan give but passing heed. His wild jungle life
had inured him to the sight of dead and dying animals, and had he
known that he was looking upon the remains of his own father and
mother he would have been no more greatly moved.</p>

<p>The furnishings and other contents of the room it was which
riveted his attention. He examined many things minutely&mdash;strange tools and weapons, books, papers, clothing&mdash;what
little had withstood the ravages of time in the humid atmosphere
of the jungle coast.</p>

<p>He opened chests and cupboards, such as did not baffle his
small experience, and in these he found the contents much better
preserved.</p>

<p>Among other things he found a sharp hunting knife, on the keen
blade of which he immediately proceeded to cut his finger.
Nothing daunted he continued his experiments, finding that he
could hack and hew splinters of wood from the table and chairs
with this new toy.</p>

<p>For a long time this amused him, but finally tiring he
continued his explorations. In a cupboard filled with books he
came across one with brightly colored pictures&mdash;it was a
child's illustrated alphabet&mdash;</p> <br>

<p class="verse">A is for Archer<br> Who shoots with a bow.<br> B
is for Boy,<br> His first name is Joe.</p> <br>

<p>The pictures interested him greatly.</p>

<p>There were many apes with faces similar to his own, and
further over in the book he found, under "M," some little monkeys
such as he saw daily flitting through the trees of his primeval
forest. But nowhere was pictured any of his own people; in all
the book was none that resembled Kerchak, or Tublat, or Kala.</p>

<p>At first he tried to pick the little figures from the leaves,
but he soon saw that they were not real, though he knew not what
they might be, nor had he any words to describe them.</p>

<p>The boats, and trains, and cows and horses were quite
meaningless to him, but not quite so baffling as the odd little
figures which appeared beneath and between the colored
pictures&mdash;some strange kind of bug he thought they might be,
for many of them had legs though nowhere could he find one with
eyes and a mouth. It was his first introduction to the letters of
the alphabet, and he was over ten years old.</p>

<p>Of course he had never before seen print, or never had spoken
with any living thing which had the remotest idea that such a
thing as a written language existed, nor ever had he seen anyone
reading.</p>

<p>So what wonder that the little boy was quite at a loss to
guess the meaning of these strange figures.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the book he found his old enemy, Sabor, the
lioness, and, further on, coiled Histah, the snake.</p>

<p>Oh, it was most engrossing! Never before in all his ten years
had he enjoyed anything so much. So absorbed was he that he did
not note the approaching dusk, until it was quite upon him and
the figures were blurred.</p>

<p>He put the book back in the cupboard and closed the door, for
he did not wish anyone else to find and destroy his treasure, and
as he went out into the gathering darkness he closed the great
door of the cabin behind him as it had been before he discovered
the secret of its lock, but before he left he had noticed the
hunting knife lying where he had thrown it upon the floor, and
this he picked up and took with him to show to his fellows.</p>

<p>He had taken scarce a dozen steps toward the jungle when a
great form rose up before him from the shadows of a low bush. At
first he thought it was one of his own people but in another
instant he realized that it was Bolgani, the huge gorilla.</p>

<p>So close was he that there was no chance for flight and little
Tarzan knew that he must stand and fight for his life; for these
great beasts were the deadly enemies of his tribe, and neither
one or the other ever asked or gave quarter.</p>

<p>Had Tarzan been a full-grown bull ape of the species of his
tribe he had been more than a match for the gorilla, but being
only a little English boy, though enormously muscular for such,
he stood no show against his cruel antagonist. In his veins,
though, flowed the blood of the best of a race of mighty
fighters, and back of this was the training of his short lifetime
among the fierce brutes of the jungle.</p>

<p>He knew no fear, as we know it; his little heart beat the
faster but from the excitement and exhilaration of adventure. Had
the opportunity presented itself he would have escaped, but
solely because his judgment told him he was no match for the
great thing which confronted him. And since reason showed him
that successful flight was impossible he met the gorilla squarely
and bravely without a tremor of a single muscle, or any sign of
panic.</p>

<p>In fact he met the brute midway in its charge, striking its
huge body with his closed fists and as futilely as he had been a
fly attacking an elephant. But in one hand he still clutched the
knife he had found in the cabin of his father, and as the brute,
striking and biting, closed upon him the boy accidentally turned
the point toward the hairy breast. As it sank deep into the body
of him the gorilla shrieked in pain and rage.</p>

<p>But the boy had learned in that brief second a use for his
sharp and shining toy, so that, as the tearing, striking beast
dragged him to earth he plunged the blade repeatedly and to the
hilt into its breast.</p>

<p>The gorilla, fighting after the manner of its kind, struck
terrific blows with its open hand, and tore the flesh at the
boy's throat and chest with its mighty tusks.</p>

<p>For a moment they rolled upon the ground in the fierce frenzy
of combat. More and more weakly the torn and bleeding arm struck
home with the long sharp blade, then the little figure stiffened
with a spasmodic jerk, and Tarzan, the young Lord Greystoke,
rolled lifeless upon the dead and decaying vegetation which
carpeted his jungle home.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A mile back in the forest the tribe had heard the fierce
challenge of the gorilla, and, as was his custom when any danger
threatened, Kerchak called his people together, partly for mutual
protection against a common enemy, since this gorilla might be
but one of a party of several, and also to see that all members
of the tribe were accounted for.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that Tarzan was missing, and Tublat was
strongly opposed to sending assistance. Kerchak himself had no
liking for the strange little waif, so he listened to Tublat,
and, finally, with a shrug of his shoulders, turned back to the
pile of leaves on which he had made his bed.</p>

<p>But Kala was of a different mind; in fact, she had not waited
but to learn that Tarzan was absent ere she was fairly flying
through the matted branches toward the point from which the cries
of the gorilla were still plainly audible.</p>

<p>Darkness had now fallen, and an early moon was sending its
faint light to cast strange, grotesque shadows among the dense
foliage of the forest.</p>

<p>Here and there the brilliant rays penetrated to earth, but for
the most part they only served to accentuate the Stygian
blackness of the jungle's depths.</p>

<p>Like some huge phantom, Kala swung noiselessly from tree to
tree; now running nimbly along a great branch, now swinging
through space at the end of another, only to grasp that of a
further tree in her rapid progress toward the scene of the
tragedy her knowledge of jungle life told her was being enacted a
short distance before her.</p>

<p>The cries of the gorilla proclaimed that it was in mortal
combat with some other denizen of the fierce wood. Suddenly these
cries ceased, and the silence of death reigned throughout the
jungle.</p>

<p>Kala could not understand, for the voice of Bolgani had at the
last been raised in the agony of suffering and death, but no sound
had come to her by which she possibly could determine the nature
of his antagonist.</p>

<p>That her little Tarzan could destroy a great bull gorilla she
knew to be improbable, and so, as she neared the spot from which
the sounds of the struggle had come, she moved more warily and at
last slowly and with extreme caution she traversed the lowest
branches, peering eagerly into the moon-splashed blackness for a
sign of the combatants.</p>

<p>Presently she came upon them, lying in a little open space
full under the brilliant light of the moon&mdash;little Tarzan's
torn and bloody form, and beside it a great bull gorilla, stone
dead.</p>

<p>With a low cry Kala rushed to Tarzan's side, and gathering the
poor, blood-covered body to her breast, listened for a sign of
life. Faintly she heard it&mdash;the weak beating of the little
heart.</p>

<p>Tenderly she bore him back through the inky jungle to where
the tribe lay, and for many days and nights she sat guard beside
him, bringing him food and water, and brushing the flies and
other insects from his cruel wounds.</p>

<p>Of medicine or surgery the poor thing knew nothing. She could
but lick the wounds, and thus she kept them cleansed, that
healing nature might the more quickly do her work.</p>

<p>At first Tarzan would eat nothing, but rolled and tossed in a
wild delirium of fever. All he craved was water, and this she
brought him in the only way she could, bearing it in her own
mouth.</p>

<p>No human mother could have shown more unselfish and
sacrificing devotion than did this poor, wild brute for the
little orphaned waif whom fate had thrown into her keeping.</p>

<p>At last the fever abated and the boy commenced to mend. No
word of complaint passed his tight set lips, though the pain of
his wounds was excruciating.</p>

<p>A portion of his chest was laid bare to the ribs, three of
which had been broken by the mighty blows of the gorilla. One arm
was nearly severed by the giant fangs, and a great piece had been
torn from his neck, exposing his jugular vein, which the cruel
jaws had missed but by a miracle.</p>

<p>With the stoicism of the brutes who had raised him he endured
his suffering quietly, preferring to crawl away from the others
and lie huddled in some clump of tall grasses rather than to show
his misery before their eyes.</p>

<p>Kala, alone, he was glad to have with him, but now that he was
better she was gone longer at a time, in search of food; for the
devoted animal had scarcely eaten enough to support her own life
while Tarzan had been so low, and was in consequence, reduced to
a mere shadow of her former self.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE LIGHT OF
KNOWLEDGE</h2>

<p class="first"> AFTER what seemed an eternity to the little
sufferer he was able to walk once more, and from then on his
recovery was rapid, so that in another month he was as strong and
active as ever.</p>

<p>During his convalescence he had gone over in his mind many
times the battle with the gorilla, and his first thought was to
recover the wonderful little weapon which had transformed him
from a hopelessly outclassed weakling to the superior of the
mighty terror of the jungle.</p>

<p>Also, he was anxious to return to the cabin and continue his
investigations of its wondrous contents.</p>

<p>So, early one morning, he set forth alone upon his quest.
After a little search he located the clean-picked bones of his
late adversary, and close by, partly buried beneath the fallen
leaves, he found the knife, now red with rust from its exposure
to the dampness of the ground and from the dried blood of the
gorilla.</p>

<p>He did not like the change in its former bright and gleaming
surface; but it was still a formidable weapon, and one which he
meant to use to advantage whenever the opportunity presented
itself. He had in mind that no more would he run from the wanton
attacks of old Tublat.</p>

<p>In another moment he was at the cabin, and after a short time
had again thrown the latch and entered. His first concern was to
learn the mechanism of the lock, and this he did by examining it
closely while the door was open, so that he could learn precisely
what caused it to hold the door, and by what means it released at
his touch.</p>

<p>He found that he could close and lock the door from within,
and this he did so that there would be no chance of his being
molested while at his investigations.</p>

<p>He commenced a systematic search of the cabin; but his
attention was soon riveted by the books which seemed to exert a
strange and powerful influence over him, so that he could scarce
attend to aught else for the lure of the wondrous puzzle which
their purpose presented to him.</p>

<p>Among the other books were a primer, some child's readers,
numerous picture books, and a great dictionary. All of these he
examined, but the pictures caught his fancy most, though the
strange little bugs which covered the pages where there were no
pictures excited his wonder and deepest thought.</p>

<p>Squatting upon his haunches on the table top in the cabin his
father had built&mdash;his smooth, brown, naked little body bent
over the book which rested in his strong slender hands, and his
great shock of long, black hair falling about his well-shaped head
and bright, intelligent eyes&mdash;Tarzan of the apes, little
primitive man, presented a picture filled, at once, with pathos
and with promise&mdash;an allegorical figure of the primordial
groping through the black night of ignorance toward the light of
learning.</p>

<p>His little face was tense in study, for he had partially
grasped, in a hazy, nebulous way, the rudiments of a thought
which was destined to prove the key and the solution to the
puzzling problem of the strange little bugs.</p>

<p>In his hands was a primer opened at a picture of a little ape
similar to himself, but covered, except for hands and face, with
strange, colored fur, for such he thought the jacket and trousers
to be. Beneath the picture were three little bugs&mdash;</p> <BR>

<p class="sign">BOY</p> <BR>

<p>And now he had discovered in the text upon the page that these
three were repeated many times in the same sequence.</p>

<p>Another fact he learned&mdash;that there were comparatively
few individual bugs; but these were repeated many times,
occasionally alone, but more often in company with others.</p>

<p>Slowly he turned the pages, scanning the pictures and the text
for a repetition of the combination <i>b-o-y</i>. Presently he
found it beneath a picture of another little ape and a strange
animal which went upon four legs like the jackal and resembled
him not a little. Beneath this picture the bugs appeared as:</p>

<p class="sign">A BOY AND A DOG.</p> <BR>

<p>There they were, the three little bugs which always
accompanied the little ape.</p>

<p>And so he progressed very, very slowly, for it was a hard and
laborious task which he had set himself without knowing
it&mdash;a task which might seem to you or me
impossible&mdash;learning to read without having the slightest
knowledge of letters or written language, or the faintest idea
that such things existed.</p>

<p>He did not accomplish it in a day, or in a week, or in a
month, or in a year; but slowly, very slowly, he learned after he
had grasped the possibilities which lay in those little bugs, so
that by the time he was fifteen he knew the various combinations
of letters which stood for every pictured figure in the little
primer and in one or two of the picture books.</p>

<p>Of the meaning and use of the articles and conjunctions, verbs
and adverbs and pronouns he had but the faintest and haziest
conception.</p>

<p>One day when he was about twelve he found a number of lead
pencils in a hitherto undiscovered drawer beneath the table, and
in scratching upon the table top with one of them he was
delighted to discover the black line it left behind it.</p>

<p>He worked so assiduously with this new toy that the table top
was soon a mass of scrawly loops and irregular lines and his
pencil-point worn down to the wood. Then he took another pencil,
but this time he had a definite object in view.</p>

<p>He would attempt to reproduce some of the little bugs that
scrambled over the pages of his books.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task, for he held the pencil as one would
grasp the hilt of a dagger, which does not add greatly to ease in
writing nor to the legibility of the results.</p>

<p>But he persevered for months, at such times as he was able to
come to the cabin, until at last by repeated experimenting he
found a position in which to hold the pencil that best permitted
him to guide and control it, so that at last he could roughly
reproduce any of the little bugs.</p>

<p>Thus he made a beginning at writing.</p>

<p>Copying the bugs taught him another thing, their number; and
though he could not count as we understand it yet he had an idea
of quantity, the base of his calculations being the number of
fingers upon one of his hands.</p>

<p>His search through the various books convinced him that he had
discovered all the different kinds of bugs most often repeated in
combination, and these he arranged in proper order with great
ease because of the frequency with which he had perused the
fascinating alphabet picture book.</p>

<p>His education progressed; but his greatest finds were in the
inexhaustible storehouse of the huge illustrated dictionary, for
he learned more through the medium of pictures than text, even
after he had grasped the significance of the bugs.</p>

<p>When he discovered the arrangement of words in alphabetical
order he delighted in searching for and finding the combinations
with which he was familiar, and the words which followed them,
their definitions, led him still further into the mazes of
erudition.</p>

<p>By the time he was seventeen he had learned to read the
simple, child's primer and had fully realized the true and
wonderful purpose of the little bugs.</p>

<p>No longer did he feel shame for his hairless body or his human
features, for now his reason told him that he was of a different
race from his wild and hairy companions. He was a M-A-N, they
were A-P-E-S, and the little apes which scurried through the
forest top were M-O-N-K-E-Y-S. He knew, too, that old Sabor was a
L-I-O-N-E-S-S, and Histah a S-N-A-K-E, and Tantor an E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T. And so he learned to read.</p>

<p>From then on his progress was rapid. With the help of the
great dictionary and the active intelligence of a healthy mind
endowed by inheritance with more than ordinary reasoning powers
he shrewdly guessed at much which he could not really understand,
and more often than not his guesses were close to the mark of
truth.</p>

<p>There were many breaks in his education, caused by the
migratory habits of his tribe, but even when removed from
recourse to his books his active brain continued to search out
the mysteries of his fascinating avocation.</p>

<p>Pieces of bark and flat leaves and even smooth stretches of
bare earth provided him with copy books whereon to scratch with
the point of his hunting knife the lessons he was learning.</p>

<p>Nor did he neglect the sterner duties of life while following
the bent of his inclination toward the solving of the mystery of
his library.</p>

<p>He practiced with his rope and played with his sharp knife,
which he had learned to keep keen by whetting upon flat
stones.</p>

<p>The tribe had grown larger since Tarzan had come among them,
for under the leadership of Kerchak they had been able to
frighten the other tribes from their part of the jungle so that
they had plenty to eat and little or no loss from predatory
incursions of neighbors.</p>

<p>Hence the younger males as they became adult found it more
comfortable to take wives from their own tribe, or if they
captured one of another tribe to bring her back to Kerchak's band
and live in amity with him rather than attempt to set up a new
establishment of their own, or fight with the redoubtable Kerchak
for supremacy at home.</p>

<p>Occasionally one more ferocious than his fellows would attempt
this latter alternative, but none had come yet who could wrest
the palm of victory from the fierce and brutal ape.</p>

<p>Tarzan held a peculiar position in the tribe. They seemed to
consider him one of them and yet in some way different. The older
males either ignored him entirely or else hated him so
vindictively that but for his wondrous agility and speed and the
fierce protection of the huge Kala he would have been dispatched
at an early age.</p>

<p>Tublat was his most consistent enemy, but it was through
Tublat that, when he was about thirteen, the persecution of his
enemies suddenly ceased and he was left severely alone, except on
the occasions when one of them ran amuck in the throes of one of
those strange, wild fits of insane rage which attacks the males
of many of the fiercer animals of the jungle. Then none was
safe.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On the day that Tarzan established his right to respect, the
tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which the
jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers in a
hollow amongst some low hills.</p>

<p>The open space was almost circular in shape. Upon every hand
rose the mighty giants of the untouched forest, with the matted
undergrowth banked so closely between the huge trunks that the
only opening into the little, level arena was through the upper
branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Here, safe from interruption, the tribe often gathered. In the
center of the amphitheater was one of those strange earthen drums
which the anthropoids build for the queer rites the sounds of
which men have heard in the fastnesses of the jungle, but which
none has ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and some
have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of the wild,
weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle, but Tarzan,
Lord Greystoke, is, doubtless, the only human being who ever
joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel of the Dum-Dum.</p>

<p>From this primitive function has arisen, unquestionably, all
the forms and ceremonials of modern church and state, for through
all the countless ages, back beyond the last, uttermost ramparts
of a dawning humanity our fierce, hairy forebears danced out the
rites of the Dum-Dum to the sound of their earthen drums, beneath
the bright light of a tropical moon in the depth of a mighty
jungle which stands unchanged today as it stood on that long
forgotten night in the dim, unthinkable vistas of the long dead
past when our first shaggy ancestor swung from a swaying bough
and dropped lightly upon the soft turf of the first meeting
place.</p>

<p>On the day that Tarzan won his emancipation from the
persecution that had followed him remorselessly for twelve of his
thirteen years of life, the tribe, now a full hundred strong,
trooped silently through the lower terrace of the jungle trees
and dropped noiselessly upon the floor of the amphitheater.</p>

<p>The rites of the Dum-Dum marked important events in the life
of the tribe&mdash;a victory, the capture of a prisoner, the
killing of some large fierce denizen of the jungle, the death or
accession of a king, and were conducted with set
ceremonialism.</p>

<p>Today it was the killing of a giant ape, a member of another
tribe, and as the people of Kerchak entered the arena two mighty
bulls might have been seen bearing the body of the vanquished
between them.</p>

<p>They laid their burden before the earthen drum and then
squatted there beside it as guards, while the other members of
the community curled themselves in grassy nooks to sleep until
the rising moon should give the signal for the commencement of
their savage orgy.</p>

<p>For hours absolute quiet reigned in the little clearing,
except as it was broken by the discordant notes of brilliantly
feathered parrots, or the screeching and twittering of the
thousand jungle birds flitting ceaselessly amongst the vivid
orchids and flamboyant blossoms which festooned the myriad, moss-covered branches of the forest kings.</p>

<p>At length as darkness settled upon the jungle the apes
commenced to bestir themselves, and soon they formed a great
circle about the earthen drum. The females and young squatted in
a thin line at the outer periphery of the circle, while just in
front of them ranged the adult males. Before the drum sat three
old females, each armed with a knotted branch fifteen or eighteen
inches in length.</p>

<p>Slowly and softly they began tapping upon the resounding
surface of the drum as the first faint rays of the ascending moon
silvered the encircling tree-tops.</p>

<p>As the light in the amphitheater increased the females
augmented the frequency and force of their blows until presently
a wild, rhythmic din pervaded the great jungle for miles in every
direction. Huge, fierce brutes stopped in their hunting, with up-pricked ears and raised heads, to listen to the dull booming that
betokened the Dum-Dum of the apes.</p>

<p>Occasionally one would raise his shrill scream or thunderous
roar in answering challenge to the savage din of the anthropoids,
but none came near to investigate or attack, for the great apes,
assembled in all the power of their numbers, filled the breasts
of their jungle neighbors with deep respect.</p>

<p>As the din of the drum rose to almost deafening volume Kerchak
sprang into the open space between the squatting males and the
drummers.</p>

<p>Standing erect he threw his head far back and looking full
into the eye of the rising moon he beat upon his breast with his
great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice that terrifying cry rang out
across the teaming solitude of that unspeakably quick, yet
unthinkably dead, world.</p>

<p>Then, crouching, Kerchak slunk noiselessly around the open
circle, veering far away from the dead body lying before the
altar-drum, but, as he passed, keeping his little, fierce,
wicked, red eyes upon the corpse.</p>

<p>Another male then sprang into the arena, and, repeating the
horrid cries of his king, followed stealthily in his wake.
Another and another followed in quick succession until the jungle
reverberated with the now almost ceaseless notes of their
bloodthirsty screams.</p>

<p>It was the challenge and the hunt.</p>

<p>When all the adult males had joined in the thin line of
circling dancers the attack commenced.</p>

<p>Kerchak, seizing a huge club from the pile which lay at hand
for the purpose, rushed furiously upon the dead ape, dealing the
corpse a terrific blow, at the same time emitting the growls and
snarls of combat. The din of the drum was now increased, as well
as the frequency of the blows, and the warriors, as each
approached the victim of the hunt and delivered his bludgeon
blow, joined in the mad whirl of the Death Dance.</p>

<p>Tarzan was one of the wild, leaping horde. His brown, sweat-streaked, muscular body, glistening in the moonlight, shone
supple and graceful among the uncouth, awkward, hairy brutes
about him.</p>

<p>None more craftily stealthy in the mimic hunt, none more
ferocious than he in the wild ferocity of the attack, nor none
who leaped so high into the air in the Dance of Death.</p>

<p>As the noise and rapidity of the drum beats increased the
dancers apparently became intoxicated with the wild rhythm and
the savage yells. Their leaps and bounds increased, their bared
fangs dripped saliva, and their lips and breasts were flecked
with foam.</p>

<p>For half an hour the weird dance went on, until, at a sign
from Kerchak, the noise of the drums ceased, the female drummers
scampering hurriedly through the line of dancers toward the outer
rim of squatting spectators. Then, as one man, the males rushed
headlong upon the thing which their terrific blows had reduced to
a mass of hairy pulp.</p>

<p>Flesh seldom came to their jaws in satisfying quantities, so a
fit finale to their wild revel was a taste of fresh killed meat,
and it was to the purpose of devouring their late enemy that they
now turned their attention.</p>

<p>Great fangs sunk into the carcass tearing away huge hunks, the
mightiest of the apes obtaining the choicest morsels, while the
weaker circled the outer edge of the fighting, snarling pack
awaiting their chance to dodge in and snatch a dropped tit-bit or
filch a remaining bone before all was gone.</p>

<p>Tarzan, more than the apes, craved and needed flesh. Descended
from a race of meat eaters, never in his life, he thought, had he
once satisfied his appetite for animal food, and so now his agile
little body wormed its way far into the mass of struggling,
rending apes in an endeavor to obtain a share which his strength
would have been unequal to the task of winning for him.</p>

<p>At his side hung the hunting knife of his unknown father in a
sheath self-fashioned in copy of one he had seen among the
pictures of his treasure-books.</p>

<p>At last he reached the fast disappearing feast and with his
sharp knife slashed off a more generous portion than he had hoped
for, an entire hairy forearm, where it protruded from beneath the
feet of the mighty Kerchak, who was so busily engaged in
perpetuating the royal prerogative of hogging that he failed to
note the act of <i>lse-majest.</i></p>

<p>So little Tarzan wriggled out from beneath the struggling
mass, clutching his grisly prize close to his breast.</p>

<p>Among those circling futilely the outskirts of the banqueters
was old Tublat. He had been among the first at the feast, but had
retreated with a goodly share to eat in quiet, and was now
forcing his way back for more.</p>

<p>So it was that he spied Tarzan as the boy emerged from the
clawing, pushing throng with that hairy forearm hugged firmly to
his body.</p>

<p>Tublat's little, close-set, blood-shot, pig eyes shot wicked
gleams of hate as they fell upon the object of his loathing. In
them, too, was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy
carried.</p>

<p>But Tarzan saw his arch enemy as quickly, and divining what
the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward the women
and children, hoping to hide himself among them. Tublat, however,
was close upon his heels, so that he had no opportunity to seek a
place of concealment, but saw that he would be put to it to
escape at all.</p>

<p>Swiftly he sped toward the surrounding trees and with an agile
bound gained a lower limb with one hand, and then, transferring
his burden to his teeth, he climbed rapidly upward, closely
followed by Tublat.</p>

<p>Up, up he went to the waving pinnacle of a lofty monarch of
the forest where his heavy pursuer dared not follow him. There he
perched, hurling taunts and insults at the raging, foaming beast
fifty feet below him.</p>

<p>And then Tublat went mad.</p>

<p>With horrifying screams and roars he rushed to the ground,
among the females and young, sinking his great fangs into a dozen
tiny necks and tearing great pieces from the backs and breasts of
the females who fell into his clutches.</p>

<p>In the brilliant moonlight Tarzan witnessed the whole mad
carnival of rage. He saw the females and the young scamper to the
safety of the trees. Then the great bulls in the center of the
arena felt the mighty fangs of their demented fellow, and with
one accord they melted into the black shadows of the overhanging
forest.</p>

<p>There was but one in the amphitheater beside Tublat, a belated
female running swiftly toward the tree where Tarzan perched, and
close behind her came the awful Tublat.</p>

<p>It was Kala, and as quickly as Tarzan saw that Tublat was
gaining on her he dropped with the rapidity of a falling stone,
from branch to branch, toward his foster mother.</p>

<p>Now she was beneath the overhanging limbs and close above her
crouched Tarzan, waiting the outcome of the race.</p>

<p>She leaped into the air grasping a low-hanging branch, but
almost over the head of Tublat, so nearly had he distanced her.
She should have been safe now but there was a rending, tearing
sound, the branch broke and precipitated her full upon the head
of Tublat, knocking him to the ground.</p>

<p>Both were up in an instant, but as quick as they had been
Tarzan had been quicker, so that the infuriated bull found
himself facing the man-child who stood between him and Kala.</p>

<p>Nothing could have suited the fierce beast better, and with a
roar of triumph he leaped upon the little Lord Greystoke. But his
fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh.</p>

<p>A muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat, and
another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into the broad
breast. Like lightning the blows fell, and only ceased when
Tarzan felt the limp form crumple beneath him.</p>

<p>As the body rolled to the ground Tarzan of the Apes placed his
foot upon the neck of his lifelong enemy and raising his eyes to
the full moon threw back his fierce young head and voiced the
wild and terrible cry of his people.</p>

<p>One by one the tribe swung down from their arboreal retreats
and formed a circle about Tarzan and his vanquished foe. When
they had all come Tarzan turned toward them.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," he cried. "I am a great killer. Let all respect
Tarzan of the Apes and Kala, his mother. There be none among you
as mighty as Tarzan. Let his enemies beware."</p>

<p>Looking full into the wicked, red eyes of Kerchak, the young
Lord Greystoke beat upon his mighty breast and screamed out once
more his shrill cry of defiance.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE TREE-TOP
HUNTER</h2>

<p class="first">THE morning after the Dum-Dum the tribe started
slowly back through the forest toward the coast.</p>

<p>The body of Tublat lay where it had fallen, for the people of
Kerchak do not eat their own dead.</p>

<p>The march was but a leisurely search for food. Cabbage-palm
and gray plum, pisang and scitamine they found in abundance, with
wild pineapple, and occasionally small mammals, birds, eggs,
reptiles, and insects. The nuts they cracked between their
powerful jaws, or, if too hard, broke by pounding between
stones.</p>

<p>Once old Sabor, crossing their path, sent them scurrying to
the safety of the higher branches, for if she respected their
number and their sharp fangs, they on their part held her cruel
and mighty ferocity in equal esteem.</p>

<p>Upon a low-hanging branch sat Tarzan directly above the
majestic, supple body as it forged silently through the thick
jungle. He hurled a pineapple at the ancient enemy of his people.
The great beast stopped and, turning, eyed the taunting figure
above her.</p>

<p>With an angry lash of her tail she bared her yellow fangs,
curling her great lips in a hideous snarl that wrinkled her
bristling snout in serried ridges and closed her wicked eyes to
two narrow slits of rage and hatred.</p>

<p>With back-laid ears she looked straight into the eyes of
Tarzan of the Apes and sounded her fierce, shrill challenge.</p>

<p>And from the safety of his overhanging limb the ape-child sent
back the fearsome answer of his kind.</p>

<p>For a moment the two eyed each other in silence, and then the
great cat turned into the jungle, which swallowed her as the
ocean engulfs a tossed pebble.</p>

<p>But into the mind of Tarzan a great plan sprang. He had killed
the fierce Tublat, so was he not therefore a mighty fighter? Now
would he track down the crafty Sabor and slay her likewise. He
would be a mighty hunter, also.</p>

<p>At the bottom of his little English heart beat the great
desire to cover his nakedness with <i>clothes</i> for he had
learned from his picture books that all <i>men</i> were so
covered, while <i>monkeys</i> and <i>apes</i> and every other
living thing went naked.</p>

<p><i>Clothes</i> therefore, must be truly a badge of greatness;
the insignia of the superiority of <i>man</i> over all other
animals, for surely there could be no other reason for wearing
the hideous things.</p>

<p>Many moons ago, when he had been much smaller, he had desired
the skin of Sabor, the lioness, or Numa, the lion, or Sheeta, the
leopard to cover his hairless body that he might no longer
resemble hideous Histah, the snake; but now he was proud of his
sleek skin for it betokened his descent from a mighty race, and
the conflicting desires to go naked in prideful proof of his
ancestry, or to conform to the customs of his own kind and wear
hideous and uncomfortable apparel found first one and then the
other in the ascendency.</p>

<p>As the tribe continued their slow way through the forest after
the passing of Sabor, Tarzan's head was filled with his great
scheme for slaying his enemy, and for many days thereafter he
thought of little else.</p>

<p>On this day, however, he presently had other and more
immediate interests to attract his attention.</p>

<p>Of a sudden it became as midnight; the noises of the jungle
ceased; the trees stood motionless as though in paralyzed
expectancy of some great and imminent disaster. All nature
waited&mdash;but not for long.</p>

<p>Faintly, from a distance, came a low, sad moaning. Nearer and
nearer it approached, mounting louder and louder in volume.</p>

<p>The great trees bent in unison as though pressed earthward by
a mighty hand. Further and further toward the ground they
inclined, and still there was no sound save the deep and awesome
moaning of the wind.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the jungle giants whipped back, lashing their
mighty tops in angry and deafening protest. A vivid and blinding
light flashed from the whirling, inky clouds above. The deep
cannonade of roaring thunder belched forth its fearsome
challenge. The deluge came&mdash;all hell broke loose upon the
jungle.</p>

<p>The tribe huddled, shivering from the cold rain, at the bases
of great trees. The lightning darting and flashing through the
blackness, showed wildly waving branches, whipping streamers and
bending trunks.</p>

<p>Now and again some ancient patriarch of the woods, rent by a
flashing bolt, would crash in a thousand pieces among the
surrounding trees, carrying down numberless branches and many
smaller neighbors to add to the tangled confusion of the tropical
jungle.</p>

<p>Branches, great and small, torn away by the ferocity of the
tornado, hurtled through the wildly waving verdure, carrying
death and destruction to countless unhappy denizens of the
thickly peopled world below.</p>

<p>For hours the fury of the storm continued without surcease,
and still the tribe huddled close in shivering fear. In constant
danger from falling trunks and branches and paralyzed by the
vivid flashing of lightning and the bellowing of thunder they
crouched in pitiful misery until the storm passed.</p>

<p>The end was as sudden as the beginning. The wind ceased, the
sun shone forth&mdash;nature smiled once more.</p>

<p>The dripping leaves and branches, and the moist petals of
gorgeous flowers glistened in the splendor of the returning day.
And, so&mdash;as Nature forgot, her children forgot also. Busy
life went on as it had been before the darkness and the
fright.</p>

<p>But to Tarzan a dawning light had come to explain the mystery
of <i>clothes.</i> How snug he would have been beneath the heavy
coat of Sabor! And so was added a further incentive to the
adventure.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>For several months the tribe hovered near the beach where
stood Tarzan's cabin, and his studies took up the greater portion
of his time, but always when journeying through the forest he
kept his rope in readiness, and many were the smaller animals
that fell into the snare of the quick thrown noose.</p>

<p>Once it fell about the short neck of Horta, the boar, and his
mad lunge for freedom toppled Tarzan from the overhanging limb
where he had lain in wait and from whence he had launched his
sinuous coil.</p>

<p>The mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body,
and, seeing only the easy prey of a young ape, he lowered his
head and charged madly at the surprised youth.</p>

<p>Tarzan, happily, was uninjured by the fall, alighting catlike
upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock. He was on his
feet in an instant and, leaping with the agility of the monkey he
was, he gained the safety of a low limb as Horta, the boar,
rushed futilely beneath.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Tarzan learned by experience the limitations
as well as the possibilities of his strange weapon.</p>

<p>He lost a long rope on this occasion, but he knew that had it
been Sabor, who had thus dragged him from his perch the outcome
might have been very different, for he would have lost his life,
doubtless, into the bargain.</p>

<p>It took him many days to braid a new rope, but when, finally,
it was done he went forth purposely to hunt, and lie in wait
among the dense foliage of a great branch right above a well-beaten trail that led to water.</p>

<p>Several small animals passed unharmed beneath him. He did not
want such insignificant game. It would take a strong animal to
test the efficacy of his new scheme.</p>

<p>At last came she whom Tarzan sought, with lithe sinews rolling
beneath shimmering hide; fat and glossy came Sabor, the
lioness.</p>

<p>Her great padded feet fell soft and noiseless on the narrow
trail. Her head was high in ever alert attention; her long tail
moved slowly in sinuous and graceful undulations.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer she came to where Tarzan of the Apes
crouched upon his limb, the coils of his long rope poised ready
in his hand.</p>

<p>Like a thing of bronze, motionless as death, sat Tarzan. Sabor
passed beneath. One stride beyond she took&mdash;a second, a
third, and then the silent coil shot out above her.</p>

<p>For an instant the spreading noose hung above her head like a
great snake, and then, as she looked upward to detect the origin
of the swishing sound of the rope, it settled about her neck.
With a quick jerk Tarzan snapped the noose tight about the glossy
throat, and then he dropped the rope and clung to his support
with both hands.</p>

<p>Sabor was trapped.</p>

<p>With a bound the startled beast turned into the jungle, but
Tarzan was not to lose another rope through the same cause as the
first. He had learned from experience. The lioness had taken but
half her second bound when she felt the rope tighten about her
neck; her body turned completely over in the air and she fell
with a heavy crash upon her back. Tarzan had fastened the end of
the rope securely to the trunk of the great tree on which he
sat.</p>

<p>Thus far his plan had worked to perfection, but when he
grasped the rope, bracing himself behind a crotch of two mighty
branches, he found that dragging the mighty, struggling, clawing,
biting, screaming mass of iron-muscled fury up to the tree and
hanging her was a very different proposition.</p>

<p>The weight of old Sabor was immense, and when she braced her
huge paws nothing less than Tantor, the elephant, himself, could
have budged her.</p>

<p>The lioness was now back in the path where she could see the
author of the indignity which had been placed upon her. Screaming
with rage she suddenly charged, leaping high into the air toward
Tarzan, but when her huge body struck the limb on which Tarzan
had been, Tarzan was no longer there.</p>

<p>Instead he perched lightly upon a smaller branch twenty feet
above the raging captive. For a moment Sabor hung half across the
branch, while Tarzan mocked, and hurled twigs and branches at her
unprotected face.</p>

<p>Presently the beast dropped to the earth again and Tarzan came
quickly to seize the rope, but Sabor, had now found that it was
only a slender cord that held her, and grasping it in her huge
jaws severed it before Tarzan could tighten the strangling noose
a second time.</p>

<p>Tarzan was much hurt. His well-laid plan had come to naught,
so he sat there screaming at the roaring creature beneath him and
making mocking grimaces at it.</p>

<p>Sabor paced back and forth beneath the tree for hours; four
times she crouched and sprang at the dancing sprite above her,
but as well have clutched at the illusive wind that murmured
through the tree tops.</p>

<p>At last Tarzan tired of the sport, and with a parting roar of
challenge and a well-aimed ripe fruit that spread soft and sticky
over the snarling face of his enemy, he swung rapidly through the
trees, a hundred feet above the ground, and in a short time was
among the members of his tribe.</p>

<p>Here he recounted the details of his adventure, with swelling
chest and so considerable swagger that he quite impressed even
his bitterest enemies, while Kala fairly danced for joy and
pride.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; MAN AND MAN</h2>

<p class="first"> TARZAN of the Apes lived on in his wild, jungle
existence with little change for several years, only that he grew
stronger and wiser, and learned from his books more and more of
the strange worlds which lay somewhere outside his primeval
forest.</p>

<p>To him life was never monotonous or stale. There was always
Pisah the fish, to be caught in the many streams and the little
lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on
the alert and give zest to every instant that one spent upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them, but
though they never quite reached him with those cruel, sharp claws
of theirs, yet there were times when one could scarce have passed
a thick leaf between their talons and his smooth hide.</p>

<p>Quick was Sabor, the lioness, and quick were Numa and Sheeta,
but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning.</p>

<p>With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends. How? Ask me not.
But this is known to the denizens of the jungle, that on many
moonlit nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the elephant,
walked together, and where the way was clear Tarzan rode, perched
high upon Tantor's mighty back.</p>

<p>All else of the jungle were his enemies, except his own tribe,
among whom he now had many friends.</p>

<p>Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his
father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of his parents and
the little skeleton of Kala's baby. At eighteen he read fluently
and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes
on the shelves.</p>

<p>Also could he write, with printed letters, rapidly and
plainly, but script he had not mastered, for though there were
several copy books among his treasure, there was so little
written English in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering
with this other form of writing, though he could read it,
laboriously.</p>

<p>Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could
speak no English, and yet who could read and write his native
language. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for
the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no great
river to bring down the savage natives of the interior.</p>

<p>High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the
fourth. It was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous
snakes. Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited
no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its frontier.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his
father delving into the mysteries of a new book, the ancient
security of his jungle was broken forever.</p>

<p>At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in
single file, over the brow of a low hill.</p>

<p>In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden
spears with ends hard baked over slow fires, and long bows and
poisoned arrows. On their backs were oval shields, in their noses
huge rings, while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded
tufts of gay feathers.</p>

<p>Across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of
color, and on each breast three concentric circles. Their yellow
teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great protruding lips
added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their
appearance.</p>

<p>Following them were several hundred women and children, the
former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking pots,
household utensils and ivory. In the rear were a hundred
warriors, similar in all respects to the advance guard.</p>

<p>That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than
whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was evidenced by
the formation of the column; and such was the fact, for they were
fleeing from the white man's soldiers who had so harassed them
for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors
one day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of
his black troops.</p>

<p>For many days they had gorged themselves on meat, but
eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon
their village by night to revenge the death of their
comrades.</p>

<p>That night the black soldiers of the white man had had meat a-plenty, and this little remnant of a once powerful tribe had
slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the unknown, and
freedom.</p>

<p>But what meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these
savage blacks meant consternation and death to many of the wild
denizens of their new home.</p>

<p>For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the
heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally, early
in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot, near the banks
of a small river, which seemed less thickly overgrown than any
ground they had yet encountered.</p>

<p>Here they set to work to build a new village, and in a month a
great clearing had been made, huts and palisades erected,
plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had taken up their
old life in their new home. Here there were no white men, no
soldiers; nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for cruel and
thankless taskmasters.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the
territory surrounding their new village. Several had already
fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so infested
with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats, and with lions and
leopards, the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves far
from the safety of their palisades.</p>

<p>But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga, wandered
far into the dense mazes to the west. Warily he stepped, his
slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield firmly grasped in
his left hand close to his sleek ebony body.</p>

<p>At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield many
slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the thick, dark, tarry
substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick.</p>

<p>Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father's
village, but still headed westward, and climbing into the fork of
a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself for
sleep.</p>

<p>Three miles to the west of him slept the tribe of Kerchak.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving through the
jungle in search of food. Tarzan, as was his custom, prosecuted
his search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely
hunting on the way his stomach was filled by the time he reached
the beach.</p>

<p>The apes scattered by ones and twos and threes in all
directions, but ever within sound of a signal of alarm.</p>

<p>Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east,
and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and logs in
search of esculent bugs and fungi, when the faintest shadow of a
strange noise brought her to startled attention.</p>

<p>For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down
this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthily advancing figure of a
strange and fearful creature.</p>

<p>It was Kulonga.</p>

<p>Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly
back along the trail. She did not run; but, after the manner of
her kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to
escape.</p>

<p>Close after her came Kulonga. Here was meat. He could make a
killing and feast well this day. On he hurried, his spear poised
for the throw.</p>

<p>At a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again upon
another straight stretch. His spear-hand went far back, the
muscles rolled, lightning-like, beneath the sleek hide. Out shot
the arm, and the spear sped toward Kala.</p>

<p>A poor cast. It but grazed her side.</p>

<p>With a cry of rage and pain the she-ape turned upon her
tormentor. In an instant the trees were crashing beneath the
weight of her hurrying fellows, swinging rapidly toward the scene
of trouble in answer to Kala's scream.</p>

<p>As she charged, Kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an arrow
with almost unthinkable quickness. Drawing the shaft far back he
drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart of the great
anthropoid.</p>

<p>With a horrid scream Kala plunged forward upon her face before
the astonished members of her tribe.</p>

<p>Roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward Kulonga, but that
wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a frightened
antelope.</p>

<p>He knew something of the ferocity of these wild, hairy men,
and his one desire was to put as many miles between himself and
them as he possibly could.</p>

<p>They followed him, racing through the trees, for a long
distance, but finally one by one they abandoned the chase and
returned to the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>None of them had ever seen a man before, other than Tarzan,
and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of creature it
might be that had invaded their jungle.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On the far beach, by the little cabin Tarzan heard the faint
echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was seriously
amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the direction of
the sound.</p>

<p>When he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering
about the dead body of his slain mother.</p>

<p>Tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded. He roared out his
hideous challenge time and again. He beat upon his great chest
with his clenched fists, and then he fell upon the body of Kala
and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart.</p>

<p>To lose the only creature in all one's world who ever had
manifested love and affection for one, is a great bereavement
indeed.</p>

<p>What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape! To Tarzan she
had been kind, she had been beautiful.</p>

<p>Upon her he had lavished, unknown to himself, all the
reverence and respect and love that a normal English boy feels
for his own mother. He had never known another, and so to Kala
was given, though mutely, all that would have belonged to the
fair and lovely Lady Alice had she lived.</p>

<p>After the first outburst of grief Tarzan controlled himself,
and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed the
killing of Kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary could
vouchsafe him.</p>

<p>It was enough, however, for his needs. It told him of a
strange, hairless, black ape with feathers growing upon its head,
who launched death from a slender branch, and then ran, with the
fleetness of Bara, the deer, toward the rising sun.</p>

<p>Tarzan waited no longer, but leaping into the branches of the
trees sped rapidly through the forest. He knew the windings of
the elephant trail along which Kala's murderer had flown, and so
he cut straight through the jungle to intercept the black warrior
who was evidently following the tortuous detours of the
trail.</p>

<p>At his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire, and
across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope. In an hour
he struck the trail again, and coming to earth examined the soil
minutely.</p>

<p>In the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found
footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made, but
much larger than his. His heart beat fast. Could it be that he
was trailing a MAN&mdash;one of his own race?</p>

<p>There were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite
directions. So his quarry had already passed on his return along
the trail. As he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of
earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to the
bottom of its shallow depression&mdash;ah, the trail was very
fresh, his prey must have but scarcely passed.</p>

<p>Tarzan swung himself to the trees once more, and with swift
noiselessness sped along high above the trail.</p>

<p>He had covered barely a mile when he came upon the black
warrior standing in a little open space. In his hand was his
slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing
arrows.</p>

<p>Opposite him across the little clearing stood Horta, the boar,
with lowered head and foam flecked tusks, ready to charge.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath
him&mdash;so like him in form and yet so different in face and
color. His books had portrayed the <i>negro,</i> but how
different had been the dull, dead print to this sleek and hideous
thing of ebony, pulsing with life.</p>

<p>As the man stood there with taut-drawn bow Tarzan recognized
in him not so much the <i>negro</i> as the <i>Archer</i> of his
picture book&mdash;</p> <BR>

<p class="verse">A stands for Archer</p> <BR>

<p>How wonderful! Tarzan almost betrayed his presence in the deep
excitement of his discovery.</p>

<p>But things were commencing to happen below him. The sinewy
black arm had drawn the shaft far back; Horta, the boar, was
charging, and then the black released the little poisoned arrow,
and Tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of thought and lodge in
the bristling neck of the boar.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere Kulonga had fitted
another to it, but Horta, the boar, was upon him so quickly that
he had no time to discharge it. With a bound the black leaped
entirely over the rushing beast and turning with incredible
swiftness planted a second arrow in Horta's back.</p>

<p>Then Kulonga sprang into a nearby tree.</p>

<p>Horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more, a dozen steps he
took, then he staggered and fell upon his side. For a moment his
muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively, then he lay
still.</p>

<p>Kulonga came down from his tree.</p>

<p>With the knife that hung at his side he cut several large
pieces from the boar's body, and in the center of the trail he
built a fire, cooking and eating as much as he wanted. The rest
he left where it had fallen.</p>

<p>Tarzan was an interested spectator. His desire to kill burned
fiercely in his wild breast, but his desire to learn was even
greater. He would follow this savage creature for a while and
know from whence he came. He could kill him at his leisure later,
when the bow and deadly arrows were laid aside.</p>

<p>When Kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond a
near turning of the path, Tarzan dropped quietly to the ground.
With his knife he severed many strips of meat from Horta's
carcass, but he did not cook them.</p>

<p>He had seen fire, but only when Ara, the lightning, had
destroyed some great tree. That any creature of the jungle could
produce the red-and-yellow fangs which devoured wood and left
nothing but fine dust surprised Tarzan greatly, and why the black
warrior had ruined his delicious repast by plunging it into the
blighting heat was quite beyond him. Possibly Ara was a friend
with whom the Archer was sharing his food.</p>

<p>But, be that as it may, Tarzan would not ruin good meat in any
such foolish manner, so he gobbled down a great quantity of the
raw flesh, burying the balance of the carcass beside the trail
where he could find it upon his return.</p>

<p>And then Lord Greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon his
naked thighs and took up the trail of Kulonga, the son of Mbonga,
the king; while in far-off London another Lord Greystoke, the
younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's father, sent back
his chops to the club's <i>chef</i> because they were underdone,
and when he had finished his repast he dipped his finger-ends
into a silver bowl of scented water and dried them upon a piece
of snowy damask.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>All day Tarzan followed Kulonga, hovering above him in the
trees like some malign spirit. Twice more he saw him hurl his
arrows of destruction&mdash;once at Dango, the hyena, and again
at Manu, the monkey. In each instance the animal died almost
instantly, for Kulonga's poison was very fresh and very
deadly.</p>

<p>Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he
swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his quarry. He knew
that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly
dispatch these wild things of the jungle, who were often torn and
scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with
their jungle neighbors, yet as often recovered as not.</p>

<p>No, there was something mysterious connected with these tiny
slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere scratch. He
must look into the matter.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>That night Kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree and
far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had
disappeared. The black warrior was furious and frightened, but
more frightened than furious. He searched the ground below the
tree, and he searched the tree above the ground; but there was no
sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder.</p>

<p>Kulonga was panic-stricken. His spear he had hurled at Kala
and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and arrows were
gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife. His only hope
lay in reaching the village of Mbonga as quickly as his legs
would carry him.</p>

<p>That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took to
the trail at a rapid trot.</p>

<p>From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away
emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in his wake.</p>

<p>Kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of
a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a
sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch half cut through and
left hanging about fifty feet higher up. Thus Tarzan blazed the
forest trails and marked his caches.</p>

<p>As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed up on him until
he traveled almost over the black's head. His rope he now held
coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for the kill.</p>

<p>The moment was delayed only because Tarzan was anxious to
ascertain the black warrior's destination, and presently he was
rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing, at
one end of which lay many strange lairs.</p>

<p>Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery.
The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred yards of
planted fields between the jungle and the village.</p>

<p>Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but
Tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and
action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even
room for the shadow of a thought between.</p>

<p>So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the
jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from the
lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the
fields of Mbonga, and ere the king's son had taken a half dozen
steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his
neck.</p>

<p>So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that
Kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe. Hand over
hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by
his neck in midair; then Tarzan climbed to a larger branch
drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering
verdure of the tree.</p>

<p>Here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch, and
then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into Kulonga's heart.
Kala was avenged.</p>

<p>Tarzan examined the black minutely, never had he seen any
other human being. The knife with its sheath and belt caught his
eye; he appropriated them. A copper anklet also took his fancy,
and this he transferred to his own leg.</p>

<p>He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and
breast. He marveled at the sharp filed teeth. He investigated and
appropriated the feathered head-dress, and then he prepared to
get down to business, for Tarzan of the Apes was hungry, and here
was meat; meat of the kill, which jungle ethics permitted him to
eat.</p>

<p>How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man with the
heart and head and body of an English gentleman, and the training
of a wild beast?</p>

<p>Tublat, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he had killed
in fair fight, and yet never had the thought of eating Tublat's
flesh entered his head. It would have been as revolting to him as
is cannibalism to us.</p>

<p>But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as
Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer? Was he not simply another of
the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one
another to satisfy the cravings of hunger?</p>

<p>Of a sudden, a strange doubt stayed his hand. Had not his
books taught him that he was a man? And was not The Archer a man,
also?</p>

<p>Did men eat men? Alas, he did not know. Why, then, this
hesitancy! Once more he essayed the effort, but of a sudden a
qualm of nausea overwhelmed him. He did not understand.</p>

<p>All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black
man, and thus hereditary instinct, ages old, usurped the
functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a
worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant.</p>

<p>Quickly he lowered Kulonga's body to the ground, removed the
noose, and took to the trees again.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE FEAR-PHANTOM</h2>

<p class="first"> FROM a lofty perch Tarzan viewed the village of
thatched huts across the intervening plantation.</p>

<p>He saw that at one point the forest touched the village, and
to this spot he made his way, lured by a fever of curiosity to
behold animals of his own kind, and to learn more of their ways
and view the strange lairs in which they lived.</p>

<p>His savage life among the fierce wild brutes of the jungle
left no opening for any thought that these could be aught else
than enemies. Similarity of form led him into no erroneous
conception of the welcome that would be accorded him should he be
discovered by these, the first of his own kind he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes was no sentimentalist. He knew nothing of
the brotherhood of man. All things outside his own tribe were his
deadly enemies, with the few exceptions of which Tantor, the
elephant, was a marked example.</p>

<p>And he realized all this without malice or hatred. To kill was
the law of the wild world he knew. Few were his primitive
pleasures, but the greatest of these was to hunt and kill, and so
he accorded to others the right to cherish the same desires as
he, even though he himself might be the object of their hunt.</p>

<p>His strange life had left him neither morose nor bloodthirsty.
That he joyed in killing, and that he killed with a joyous laugh
upon his handsome lips betokened no innate cruelty. He killed for
food most often, but, being a man, he sometimes killed for
pleasure, a thing which no other animal does; for it has remained
for man alone among all creatures to kill senselessly and
wantonly for the mere pleasure of inflicting suffering and
death.</p>

<p>And when he killed for revenge, or in self-defense, he did
that also without hysteria, but it was a very businesslike
proceeding which admitted of no levity.</p>

<p>So it was that now, as he cautiously approached the village of
Mbonga, he was quite prepared either to kill or be killed should
he be discovered. He proceeded with unwonted stealth, for Kulonga
had taught him great respect for the little sharp splinters of
wood which dealt death so swiftly and unerringly.</p>

<p>At length he came to a great tree, heavy laden with thick
foliage and loaded with pendant loops of giant creepers. From
this almost impenetrable bower above the village he crouched,
looking down upon the scene below him, wondering over every
feature of this new, strange life.</p>

<p>There were naked children running and playing in the village
street. There were women grinding dried plantain in crude stone
mortars, while others were fashioning cakes from the powdered
flour. Out in the fields he could see still other women hoeing,
weeding, or gathering.</p>

<p>All wore strange protruding girdles of dried grass about their
hips and many were loaded with brass and copper anklets, armlets
and bracelets. Around many a dusky neck hung curiously coiled
strands of wire, while several were further ornamented by huge
nose-rings.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes looked with growing wonder at these strange
creatures. Dozing in the shade he saw several men, while at the
extreme outskirts of the clearing he occasionally caught glimpses
of armed warriors apparently guarding the village against
surprise from an attacking enemy.</p>

<p>He noticed that the women alone worked. Nowhere was there
evidence of a man tilling the fields or performing any of the
homely duties of the village.</p>

<p>Finally his eyes rested upon a woman directly beneath him.</p>

<p>Before her was a small cauldron standing over a low fire and
in it bubbled a thick, reddish, tarry mass. On one side of her
lay a quantity of wooden arrows the points of which she dipped
into the seething substance, then laying them upon a narrow rack
of boughs which stood upon her other side.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes was fascinated. Here was the secret of the
terrible destructiveness of The Archer's tiny missiles. He noted
the extreme care which the woman took that none of the matter
should touch her hands, and once when a particle spattered upon
one of her fingers he saw her plunge the member into a vessel of
water and quickly rub the tiny stain away with a handful of
leaves.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes knew nothing of poison, but his shrewd
reasoning told him that it was this deadly stuff that killed, and
not the little arrow, which was merely the messenger that carried
it into the body of its victim.</p>

<p>How he should like to have more of those little death-dealing
slivers. If the woman would only leave her work for an instant he
could drop down, gather up a handful, and be back in the tree
again before she drew three breaths.</p>

<p>As he was trying to think out some plan to distract her
attention he heard a wild cry from across the clearing. He looked
and saw a black warrior standing beneath the very tree in which
he had killed the murderer of Kala an hour before.</p>

<p>The fellow was shouting and waving his spear above his head.
Now and again he would point to something on the ground before
him.</p>

<p>The village was in an uproar instantly. Armed men rushed from
the interior of many a hut and raced madly across the clearing
toward the excited sentry. After them trooped the old men, and
the women and children until, in a moment, the village was
deserted.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes knew that they had found the body of his
victim, but that interested him far less than the fact that no
one remained in the village to prevent his taking a supply of the
arrows which lay below him.</p>

<p>Quickly and noiselessly he dropped to the ground beside the
cauldron of poison. For a moment he stood motionless, his quick,
bright eyes scanning the interior of the palisade.</p>

<p>No one was in sight. His eyes rested upon the open doorway of
a nearby hut. He would take a look within, thought Tarzan, and
so, cautiously, he approached the low thatched building.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood without, listening intently. There was
no sound, and he glided into the semi-darkness of the
interior.</p>

<p>Weapons hung against the walls&mdash;long spears, strangely
shaped knives, a couple of narrow shields. In the center of the
room was a cooking pot, and at the far end a litter of dry
grasses covered by woven mats which evidently served the owners
as beds and bedding. Several human skulls lay upon the floor.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes felt of each article, hefted the spears,
smelled of them, for he "saw" largely through his sensitive and
highly trained nostrils. He determined to own one of these long,
pointed sticks, but he could not take one on this trip because of
the arrows he meant to carry.</p>

<p>One by one, as he took each article from the walls, he placed
them in a pile in the center of the room, and on top of all he
placed the cooking pot, inverted, and on top of this he laid one
of the grinning skulls, upon which he fastened the headdress of
the dead Kulonga.</p>

<p>Then he stood back and surveyed his work, and grinned. Tarzan
of the Apes was a joker.</p>

<p>But now he heard, without, the sounds of many voices, and long
mournful howls, and mighty wailing. He was startled. Had he
remained too long? Quickly he reached the doorway and peered down
the village street toward the village gate.</p>

<p>The natives were not yet in sight, though he could plainly
hear them approaching across the plantation. They must be very
near.</p>

<p>Like a flash he sprang across the opening to the pile of
arrows. Gathering up all he could carry under one arm, he
overturned the seething cauldron with a kick, and disappeared
into the foliage above just as the first of the returning natives
entered the gate at the far end of the village street. Then he
turned to watch the proceeding below, poised like some wild bird
ready to take swift wing at the first sign of danger.</p>

<p>The natives filed up the street, four of them bearing the dead
body of Kulonga. Behind trailed the women, uttering strange cries
and weird lamentation. On they came to the portals of Kulonga's
hut, the very one in which Tarzan had wrought his
depredations.</p>

<p>Scarcely had half a dozen entered the building ere they came
rushing out in wild, jabbering confusion. The others hastened to
gather about. There was much excited gesticulating, pointing, and
chattering; then several of the warriors approached and peered
within.</p>

<p>Finally an old fellow with many ornaments of metal about his
arms and legs, and a necklace of dried human hands depending upon
his chest, entered the hut.</p>

<p>It was Mbonga, the king, father of Kulonga.</p>

<p>For a few moments all were silent. Then Mbonga emerged, a look
of mingled wrath and superstitious fear writ upon his hideous
countenance. He spoke a few words to the assembled warriors, and
in an instant the men were flying through the little village
searching minutely every hut and corner within the palisade.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the search commenced than the overturned cauldron
was discovered, and with it the theft of the poisoned arrows.
Nothing more they found, and it was a thoroughly awed and
frightened group of savages which huddled around their king a few
moments later.</p>

<p>Mbonga could explain nothing of the strange events that had
taken place. The finding of the still warm body of
Kulonga&mdash;on the very verge of their fields and within easy
earshot of the village&mdash;knifed and stripped at the door of
his father's home, was in itself sufficiently mysterious, but
these last awesome discoveries within the village, within the
dead Kulonga's own hut, filled their hearts with dismay, and
conjured in their poor brains only the most frightful of
superstitious explanations.</p>

<p>They stood in little groups, talking in low tones, and ever
casting affrighted glances behind them from their great rolling
eyes.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes watched them for a while from his lofty
perch in the great tree. There was much in their demeanor which
he could not understand, for of superstition he was ignorant, and
of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens. Tarzan had not broken fast
this day, and it was many miles to where lay the toothsome
remains of Horta the boar.</p>

<p>So he turned his back upon the village of Mbonga and melted
away into the leafy fastness of the forest.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; "KING OF THE
APES"</h2>

<p class="first"> IT was not yet dark when he reached the tribe,
though he stopped to exhume and devour the remains of the wild
boar he had cached the preceding day, and again to take Kulonga's
bow and arrows from the tree top in which he had hidden them.</p>

<p>It was a well-laden Tarzan who dropped from the branches into
the midst of the tribe of Kerchak.</p>

<p>With swelling chest he narrated the glories of his adventure
and exhibited the spoils of conquest.</p>

<p>Kerchak grunted and turned away, for he was jealous of this
strange member of his band. In his little evil brain he sought
for some excuse to wreak his hatred upon Tarzan.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The next day Tarzan was practicing with his bow and arrows at
the first gleam of dawn. At first he lost nearly every bolt he
shot, but finally he learned to guide the little shafts with fair
accuracy, and ere a month had passed he was no mean shot; but his
proficiency had cost him nearly his entire supply of arrows.</p>

<p>The tribe continued to find the hunting good in the vicinity
of the beach, and so Tarzan of the Apes varied his archery
practice with further investigation of his father's choice, though
little, store of books.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the young English lord found
hidden in the back of one of the cupboards in the cabin a small
metal box. The key was in the lock, and a few moments'
investigation and experimentation were rewarded with the
successful opening of the receptacle.</p>

<p>In it he found a faded photograph of a smooth faced young man,
a golden locket studded with diamonds, linked to a small gold
chain, a few letters and a small book.</p>

<p>Tarzan examined these all minutely.</p>

<p>The photograph he liked most of all, for the eyes were
smiling, and the face was open and frank. It was his father.</p>

<p>The locket, too, took his fancy, and he placed the chain about
his neck in imitation of the ornamentation he had seen to be so
common among the black men he had visited. The brilliant stones
gleamed strangely against his smooth, brown hide.</p>

<p>The letters he could scarcely decipher for he had learned
little or nothing of script, so he put them back in the box with
the photograph and turned his attention to the book.</p>

<p>This was almost entirely filled with fine script, but while
the little bugs were all familiar to him, their arrangement and
the combinations in which they occurred were strange, and
entirely incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Tarzan had long since learned the use of the dictionary, but
much to his sorrow and perplexity it proved of no avail to him in
this emergency. Not a word of all that was writ in the book could
he find, and so he put it back in the metal box, but with a
determination to work out the mysteries of it later on.</p>

<p>Poor little ape-man! Had he but known it that tiny, baffling
mystery held between its seal covers the key to his origin; the
answer to the strange riddle of his strange life.</p>

<p>It was the diary of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke&mdash;kept in
French, as had always been his custom.</p>

<p>Tarzan replaced the box in the cupboard, but always thereafter
he carried the features of the strong, smiling face of his father
in his heart, and in his head a fixed determination to solve the
mystery of the strange words in the little black book.</p>

<p>At present he had more important business in hand, for his
supply of arrows was exhausted, and he must needs journey to the
black men's village and renew it.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Early the following morning he set out, and, traveling
rapidly, he came before mid-day to the clearing. Once more he
took up his position in the great tree, and, as before, he saw
the women in the fields and the village street, and the cauldron
of bubbling poison directly beneath him.</p>

<p>For hours he lay awaiting his opportunity to drop down unseen
and gather up the arrows for which he had come; but nothing now
occurred to call the villagers away from their homes. The day
wore on, and still Tarzan of the Apes crouched above the
unsuspecting woman at the cauldron.</p>

<p>Presently the workers in the fields returned. The hunting
warriors emerged from the forest, and when all were within the
palisade the gates were closed and barred.</p>

<p>Many cooking pots were now in evidence about the village.
Before each hut a woman presided over a boiling stew, while
little cakes of plantain, and cassava puddings were to be seen on
every hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a hail from the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked.</p>

<p>It was a party of belated hunters returning from the north,
and among them they half led, half carried a struggling
animal.</p>

<p>As they approached the village the gates were thrown open to
admit them, and then, as the people saw the victim of the chase,
a savage cry rose to the heavens, for the quarry was a man.</p>

<p>As he was dragged, still resisting, into the village street,
the women and children set upon him with sticks and stones, and
Tarzan of the Apes, young and savage beast of the jungle,
wondered at the cruel brutality of his own kind.</p>

<p>Sheeta, the leopard, alone of all the jungle folk, tortured
his prey. The ethics of all the others meted a quick and merciful
death to their victims.</p>

<p>Tarzan had learned from his books but scattered fragments of
the ways of human beings.</p>

<p>When he had followed Kulonga through the forest he had
expected to come to a city of strange houses on wheels, puffing
clouds of black smoke from a huge tree stuck in the roof of one
of them&mdash;or to a sea covered with mighty floating buildings
which he had learned were called, variously, ships and boats and
steamers and craft.</p>

<p>He had been sorely disappointed with the poor little village
of the blacks, hidden away in his own jungle, and with not a
single house as large as his own cabin upon the distant
beach.</p>

<p>He saw that these people were more wicked than his own apes,
and as savage and cruel as Sabor, herself. Tarzan began to hold
his own kind in but low esteem.</p>

<p>Now they had tied their poor victim to a great post near the
center of the village, directly before Mbonga's hut, and here
they formed a dancing, yelling circle of warriors about him,
alive with flashing knives and menacing spears.</p>

<p>In a larger circle squatted the women, yelling and beating
upon drums. It reminded Tarzan of the Dum-Dum, and so he knew
what to expect. He wondered if they would spring upon their meat
while it was still alive. The Apes did not do such things as
that.</p>

<p>The circle of warriors about the cringing captive drew closer
and closer to their prey as they danced in wild and savage
abandon to the maddening music of the drums. Presently a spear
reached out and pricked the victim. It was the signal for fifty
others.</p>

<p>Eyes, ears, arms and legs were pierced; every inch of the poor
writhing body that did not cover a vital organ became the target
of the cruel lancers.</p>

<p>The women and children shrieked their delight. The warriors
licked their hideous lips in anticipation of the feast to come,
and vied with one another in the savagery and loathsomeness of
the cruel indignities with which they tortured the still
conscious prisoner.</p>

<p>Then it was that Tarzan of the Apes saw his chance. All eyes
were fixed upon the thrilling spectacle at the stake. The light
of day had given place to the darkness of a moonless night, and
only the fires in the immediate vicinity of the orgy had been
kept alight to cast a restless glow upon the restless scene.</p>

<p>Gently the lithe boy dropped to the soft earth at the end of
the village street. Quickly he gathered up the arrows&mdash;all
of them this time, for he had brought a number of long fibers to
bind them into a bundle.</p>

<p>Without haste he wrapped them securely, and then, ere he
turned to leave, the devil of capriciousness entered his heart.
He looked about for some hint of a wild prank to play upon these
strange, grotesque creatures that they might be again aware of
his presence among them.</p>

<p>Dropping his bundle of arrows at the foot of the tree, Tarzan
crept among the shadows at the side of the street until he came
to the same hut he had entered on the occasion of his first
visit.</p>

<p>Inside all was darkness, but his groping hands soon found the
object for which he sought, and without further delay he turned
again toward the door.</p>

<p>He had taken but a step, however, ere his quick ear caught the
sound of approaching footsteps immediately without. In another
instant the figure of a woman darkened the entrance of the
hut.</p>

<p>Tarzan drew back silently to the far wall, and his hand sought
the long, keen hunting knife of his father. The woman came
quickly to the center of the hut. There she paused for an instant
feeling about with her hands for the thing she sought. Evidently
it was not in its accustomed place, for she explored ever nearer
and nearer the wall where Tarzan stood.</p>

<p>So close was she now that the ape-man felt the animal warmth
of her naked body. Up went the hunting knife, and then the woman
turned to one side and soon a guttural "ah" proclaimed that her
search had at last been successful.</p>

<p>Immediately she turned and left the hut, and as she passed
through the doorway Tarzan saw that she carried a cooking pot in
her hand.</p>

<p>He followed closely after her, and as he reconnoitered from
the shadows of the doorway he saw that all the women of the
village were hastening to and from the various huts with pots and
kettles. These they were filling with water and placing over a
number of fires near the stake where the dying victim now hung,
an inert and bloody mass of suffering.</p>

<p>Choosing a moment when none seemed near, Tarzan hastened to
his bundle of arrows beneath the great tree at the end of the
village street. As on the former occasion he overthrew the
cauldron before leaping, sinuous and catlike, into the lower
branches of the forest giant.</p>

<p>Silently he climbed to a great height until he found a point
where he could look through a leafy opening upon the scene
beneath him.</p>

<p>The women were now preparing the prisoner for their cooking
pots, while the men stood about resting after the fatigue of
their mad revel. Comparative quiet reigned in the village.</p>

<p>Tarzan raised aloft the thing he had pilfered from the hut,
and, with aim made true by years of fruit and coconut throwing,
launched it toward the group of savages.</p>

<p>Squarely among them it fell, striking one of the warriors full
upon the head and felling him to the ground. Then it rolled among
the women and stopped beside the half butchered thing they were
preparing to feast upon.</p>

<p>All gazed in consternation at it for an instant, and then,
with one accord, broke and ran for their huts.</p>

<p>It was a grinning human skull which looked up at them from the
ground. The dropping of the thing out of the open sky was a
miracle well aimed to work upon their superstitious fears.</p>

<p>Thus Tarzan of the Apes left them filled with terror at this
new manifestation of the presence of some unseen and unearthly
evil power which lurked in the forest about their village.</p>

<p>Later, when they discovered the overturned cauldron, and that
once more their arrows had been pilfered, it commenced to dawn
upon them that they had offended some great god who ruled this
part of the jungle by placing their village there without
propitiating him. From then on an offering of food was daily
placed below the great tree from whence the arrows had
disappeared, in an effort to conciliate the mighty one.</p>

<p>But the seed of fear was deep sown, and had he but known it,
Tarzan of the Apes had laid the foundation for much future misery
for himself and his tribe.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>That night he slept in the forest not far from the village,
and early the next morning set out slowly on his homeward march,
hunting as he traveled. Only a few berries and an occasional grub
worm rewarded his search, and he was half famished when, looking
up from a log he had been rooting beneath, he saw Sabor, the
lioness, standing in the center of the trail not twenty paces
from him.</p>

<p>The great yellow eyes were fixed upon him with a wicked and
baleful gleam, and the red tongue licked the longing lips as
Sabor crouched, worming her stealthy way with belly flattened
against the earth.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not attempt to escape. He welcomed the opportunity
for which, in fact, he had been searching for days past, not now
armed only with a rope of grass.</p>

<p>Quickly he unslung his bow and fitted a well-daubed arrow, and
as Sabor sprang, the tiny missile leaped to meet her in midair.
At the same instant Tarzan of the Apes jumped to one side, and as
the great cat struck the ground beyond him another death-tipped
arrow sunk deep into Sabor's loin.</p>

<p>With a mighty roar the beast turned and charged once more,
only to be met with a third arrow full in one eye; but this time
she was too close to the ape-man for the latter to sidestep the
on-rushing body.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes went down beneath the great body of his
enemy, but with gleaming knife drawn and striking home. For a
moment they lay there, and then Tarzan realized that the inert
mass lying upon him was beyond power ever again to injure man or
ape.</p>

<p>With difficulty he wriggled from beneath the great weight, and
as he stood erect and gazed down upon the trophy of his skill, a
mighty wave of exultation swept over him.</p>

<p>With swelling breast, he placed a foot upon the body of his
powerful enemy, and throwing back his fine young head, roared out
the awful challenge of the victorious bull ape.</p>

<p>The forest echoed to the savage and triumphant paean. Birds
fell still, and the larger animals and beasts of prey slunk
stealthily away, for few there were of all the jungle who sought
for trouble with the great anthropoids.</p>

<p>And in London another Lord Greystoke was speaking to
<i>his</i> kind in the House of Lords, but none trembled at the
sound of his soft voice.</p>

<p>Sabor proved unsavory eating even to Tarzan of the Apes, but
hunger served as a most efficacious disguise to toughness and
rank taste, and ere long, with well-filled stomach, the ape-man
was ready to sleep again. First, however, he must remove the
hide, for it was as much for this as for any other purpose that
he had desired to encompass the destruction of Sabor.</p>

<p>Deftly he removed the great pelt, for he had practiced often
on smaller animals. When the task was finished he carried his
trophy to the fork of a high tree, and there, curling himself
securely in a crotch, he fell into deep and dreamless
slumber.</p>

<p>What with loss of sleep, arduous exercise, and a full belly,
Tarzan of the Apes slept the sun around, awakening about noon of
the following day. He straightway repaired to the carcass of
Sabor, but was angered to find the bones picked clean by other
hungry denizens of the jungle.</p>

<p>Half an hour's leisurely progress through the forest brought
to sight a young deer, and before ever the little creature knew
that an enemy was near a tiny arrow had lodged in its neck.</p>

<p>So quickly the virus worked that at the end of a dozen leaps
the deer plunged headlong into the undergrowth, dead. Again did
Tarzan feast well, but this time he did not sleep.</p>

<p>Instead, he hastened on toward the point where he had left the
tribe, and when he had found them proudly exhibited the skin of
Sabor, the lioness.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried, "Apes of Kerchak. See what Tarzan, the
mighty killer, has done. Who else among you has ever killed one
of Numa's people? Tarzan is mightiest amongst you for Tarzan is
no ape. Tarzan is&mdash;" But here he stopped, for in the
language of the anthropoids there was no word for man, and Tarzan
could only write the word in English; he could not pronounce
it.</p>

<p>The tribe had gathered about to look upon the proof of his
wondrous prowess, and to listen to his words.</p>

<p>Only Kerchak hung back, nursing his hatred and his rage.</p>

<p>Suddenly something snapped in the wicked little brain of the
anthropoid. With a frightful roar the great beast sprang among
the assemblage.</p>

<p>Biting, and striking with his huge hands, he killed and maimed
a dozen ere the balance could escape to the upper terraces of the
forest.</p>

<p>Frothing and shrieking in the insanity of his fury, Kerchak
looked about for the object of his greatest hatred, and there,
upon a nearby limb, he saw him sitting.</p>

<p>"Come down, Tarzan, great killer," cried Kerchak. "Come down
and feel the fangs of a greater! Do mighty fighters fly to the
trees at the first approach of danger?" And then Kerchak emitted
the volleying challenge of his kind.</p>

<p>Quietly Tarzan dropped to the ground. Breathlessly the tribe
watched from their lofty perches as Kerchak, still roaring,
charged the relatively puny figure.</p>

<p>Nearly seven feet stood Kerchak on his short legs. His
enormous shoulders were bunched and rounded with huge muscles.
The back of his short neck was as a single lump of iron sinew
which bulged beyond the base of his skull, so that his head
seemed like a small ball protruding from a huge mountain of
flesh.</p>

<p>His back-drawn, snarling lips exposed his great fighting
fangs, and his little, wicked, bloodshot eyes gleamed in horrid
reflection of his madness.</p>

<p>Awaiting him stood Tarzan, himself a mighty muscled animal,
but his six feet of height and his great rolling sinews seemed
pitifully inadequate to the ordeal which awaited them.</p>

<p>His bow and arrows lay some distance away where he had dropped
them while showing Sabor's hide to his fellow apes, so that he
confronted Kerchak now with only his hunting knife and his
superior intellect to offset the ferocious strength of his
enemy.</p>

<p>As his antagonist came roaring toward him, Lord Greystoke tore
his long knife from its sheath, and with an answering challenge
as horrid and blood-curdling as that of the beast he faced,
rushed swiftly to meet the attack. He was too shrewd to allow
those long hairy arms to encircle him, and just as their bodies
were about to crash together, Tarzan of the Apes grasped one of
the huge wrists of his assailant, and, springing lightly to one
side, drove his knife to the hilt into Kerchak's body, below the
heart.</p>

<p>Before he could wrench the blade free again, the bull's quick
lunge to seize him in those awful arms had torn the weapon from
Tarzan's grasp.</p>

<p>Kerchak aimed a terrific blow at the ape-man's head with the
flat of his hand, a blow which, had it landed, might easily have
crushed in the side of Tarzan's skull.</p>

<p>The man was too quick, and, ducking beneath it, himself
delivered a mighty one, with clenched fist, in the pit of
Kerchak's stomach.</p>

<p>The ape was staggered, and what with the mortal wound in his
side had almost collapsed, when, with one mighty effort he
rallied for an instant&mdash;just long enough to enable him to
wrest his arm free from Tarzan's grasp and close in a terrific
clinch with his wiry opponent.</p>

<p>Straining the ape-man close to him, his great jaws sought
Tarzan's throat, but the young lord's sinewy fingers were at
Kerchak's own before the cruel fangs could close on the sleek
brown skin.</p>

<p>Thus they struggled, the one to crush out his opponent's life
with those awful teeth, the other to close forever the windpipe
beneath his strong grasp, the while he held the snarling mouth
from him.</p>

<p>The greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing, and the
teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from Tarzan's
throat when, with a shuddering tremor, the great body stiffened
for an instant and then sank limply to the ground.</p>

<p>Kerchak was dead.</p>

<p>Withdrawing the knife that had so often rendered him master of
far mightier muscles than his own, Tarzan of the Apes placed his
foot upon the neck of his vanquished enemy, and once again, loud
through the forest rang the fierce, wild cry of the
conqueror.</p>

<p>And thus came the young Lord Greystoke into the kingship of
the Apes.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; MAN'S REASON</h2>

<p class="first"> THERE was one of the tribe of Tarzan who
questioned his authority, and that was Terkoz, the son of Tublat,
but he so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new
lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to
petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms; Tarzan knew,
however, that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the kingship
from him by some sudden stroke of treachery, and so he was ever
on his guard against surprise.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>For months the life of the little band went on much as it had
before, except that Tarzan's greater intelligence and his ability
as a hunter were the means of providing for them more bountifully
than ever before. Most of them, therefore, were more than content
with the change in rulers.</p>

<p>Tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men, and
there, warned by their chief's superior wisdom, they ate only
what they required, nor ever did they destroy what they could not
eat, as is the way of Manu, the monkey, and of most apes.</p>

<p>So, while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering of
their fields, they were not discouraged in their efforts to
cultivate the land, as would have been the case had Tarzan
permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly.</p>

<p>During this period Tarzan paid many nocturnal visits to the
village, where he often renewed his supply of arrows. He soon
noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which
was his avenue into the palisade, and after a little while, he
commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there.</p>

<p>When the awe-struck savages saw that the food disappeared over
night they were filled with consternation and awe, for it was one
thing to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil, but quite
another thing to have the spirit really come into the village and
eat it. Such a thing was unheard of, and it filled their
superstitious minds with all manner of vague fears.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The periodic disappearance of their arrows,
and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands, had wrought
them to such a state that life had become a veritable burden in
their new home, and now it was that Mbonga and his head men began
to talk of abandoning the village and seeking a site further on
in the jungle.</p>

<p>Presently the black warriors began to strike further and
further south into the heart of the forest when they went to
hunt, looking for a site for a new village.</p>

<p>More often was the tribe of Tarzan disturbed by these
wandering huntsmen. Now was the quiet, fierce solitude of the
primeval forest broken by new, strange cries. No longer was there
safety for bird or beast. Man had come.</p>

<p>Other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and by
night&mdash;fierce, cruel beasts&mdash;but their weaker neighbors
only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when the
danger was past.</p>

<p>With man it is different. When he comes many of the larger
animals instinctively leave the district entirely, seldom if ever
to return; and thus it has always been with the great
anthropoids. They flee man as man flees a pestilence.</p>

<p>For a short time the tribe of Tarzan lingered in the vicinity
of the beach because their new chief hated the thought of leaving
the treasured contents of the little cabin forever. But when one
day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in great numbers
on the banks of a little stream that had been their watering
place for generations, and in the act of clearing a space in the
jungle and erecting many huts, the apes would remain no longer,
and so Tarzan led them inland for many marches to a spot as yet
undefiled by the foot of a human being.</p>

<p>Once every moon Tarzan would go swinging rapidly back through
the swaying branches to have a day with his books, and to
replenish his supply of arrows. This latter task was becoming
more and more difficult, for the blacks had taken to hiding their
supply away at night in granaries and living huts.</p>

<p>This necessitated watching by day on Tarzan's part to discover
where the arrows were being concealed.</p>

<p>Twice had he entered huts at night while the inmates lay
sleeping upon their mats, and stolen the arrows from the very
sides of the warriors. But this method he realized to be too
fraught with danger, and so he commenced picking up solitary
hunters with his long, deadly noose, stripping them of weapons
and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into the
village street during the still watches of the night.</p>

<p>These various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that,
had it not been for the monthly respite between Tarzan's visits,
in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each fresh
incursion would prove the last, they soon would have abandoned
their new village.</p>

<p>The blacks had not as yet come upon Tarzan's cabin on the
distant beach, but the ape-man lived in constant dread that,
while he was away with the tribe, they would discover and despoil
his treasure. So it came that he spent more and more time in the
vicinity of his father's last home, and less and less with the
tribe. Presently the members of his little community began to
suffer on account of his neglect, for disputes and quarrels
constantly arose which only the king might settle peaceably.</p>

<p>At last some of the older apes spoke to Tarzan on the subject,
and for a month thereafter he remained constantly with the
tribe.</p>

<p>The duties of kingship among the anthropoids are not many or
arduous.</p>

<p>In the afternoon comes Thaka, possibly, to complain that old
Mungo has stolen his new wife. Then must Tarzan summon all before
him, and if he finds that the wife prefers her new lord he
commands that matters remain as they are, or possibly that Mungo
give Thaka one of his daughters in exchange.</p>

<p>Whatever his decision, the apes accept it as final, and return
to their occupations satisfied.</p>

<p>Then comes Tana, shrieking and holding tight her side from
which blood is streaming. Gunto, her husband, has cruelly bitten
her! And Gunto, summoned, says that Tana is lazy and will not
bring him nuts and beetles, or scratch his back for him.</p>

<p>So Tarzan scolds them both and threatens Gunto with a taste of
the death-bearing slivers if he abuses Tana further, and Tana,
for her part, is compelled to promise better attention to her
wifely duties.</p>

<p>And so it goes, little family differences for the most part,
which, if left unsettled would result finally in greater
factional strife, and the eventual dismemberment of the
tribe.</p>

<p>But Tarzan tired of it as he found that kingship meant the
curtailment of his liberty. He longed for the little cabin and
the sun-kissed sea&mdash;for the cool interior of the well-built
house, and for the never-ending wonders of the many books.</p>

<p>As he had grown older, he found that he had grown away from
his people. Their interests and his were far removed. They had
not kept pace with him, nor could they understand aught of the
many strange and wonderful dreams that passed through the active
brain of their human king. So limited was their vocabulary that
Tarzan could not even talk with them of the many new truths, and
the great fields of thought that his reading had opened up before
his longing eyes, or make known ambitions which stirred his
soul.</p>

<p>Among the tribe he no longer had friends and cronies as of
old. A little child may find companionship in many strange and
simple creatures, but to a grown man there must be some semblance
of equality in intellect as the basis for agreeable
consociation.</p>

<p>Had Kala lived, Tarzan would have sacrificed all else to
remain near her, but now that she was dead, and the playful
friends of his childhood grown into fierce and surly brutes he
felt that he much preferred the peace and solitude of his cabin
to the irksome duties of leadership amongst a horde of wild
beasts.</p>

<p>The hatred and jealousy of Terkoz, son of Tublat, did much to
counteract the effect of Tarzan's desire to renounce his kingship
among the apes, for, stubborn young Englishman that he was, he
could not bring himself to retreat in the face of so malignant an
enemy.</p>

<p>That Terkoz would be chosen leader in his stead he knew full
well, for time and again the ferocious brute had established his
claim to physical supremacy over the few bull apes who had dared
resent his savage bullying.</p>

<p>Tarzan would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without
recourse to knife or arrows. So much had his great strength and
agility increased in the period following his maturity that he
had come to believe that he might master the redoubtable Terkoz
in a hand to hand fight were it not for the terrible advantage
the anthropoid's huge fighting fangs gave him over the poorly
armed Tarzan.</p>

<p>The entire matter was taken out of Tarzan's hands one day by
force of circumstances, and his future left open to him, so that
he might go or stay without any stain upon his savage
escutcheon.</p>

<p>It happened thus:</p>

<p>The tribe was feeding quietly, spread over a considerable
area, when a great screaming arose some distance east of where
Tarzan lay upon his belly beside a limpid brook, attempting to
catch an elusive fish in his quick, brown hands.</p>

<p>With one accord the tribe swung rapidly toward the frightened
cries, and there found Terkoz holding an old female by the hair
and beating her unmercifully with his great hands.</p>

<p>As Tarzan approached he raised his hand aloft for Terkoz to
desist, for the female was not his, but belonged to a poor old
ape whose fighting days were long over, and who, therefore, could
not protect his family.</p>

<p>Terkoz knew that it was against the laws of his kind to strike
the woman of another, but being a bully, he had taken advantage
of the weakness of the female's husband to chastise her because
she had refused to give up to him a tender young rodent she had
captured.</p>

<p>When Terkoz saw Tarzan approaching without his arrows, he
continued to belabor the poor woman in a studied effort to
affront his hated chieftain.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not repeat his warning signal, but instead rushed
bodily upon the waiting Terkoz.</p>

<p>Never had the ape-man fought so terrible a battle since that
long-gone day when, Bolgani, the great king gorilla had so
horribly manhandled him ere the new-found knife had, by accident,
pricked the savage heart.</p>

<p>Tarzan's knife on the present occasion but barely offset the
gleaming fangs of Terkoz, and what little advantage the ape had
over the man in brute strength was almost balanced by the
latter's wonderful quickness and agility.</p>

<p>In the sum total of their points, however, the anthropoid had
a shade the better of the battle, and had there been no other
personal attribute to influence the final outcome, Tarzan of the
Apes, the young Lord Greystoke, had died as he had lived&mdash;an
unknown savage beast in equatorial Africa.</p>

<p>But there was that which had raised him far above his fellows
of the jungle&mdash;that little spark which spells the whole vast
difference between man and brute&mdash;Reason. This it was which
saved him from death beneath the iron muscles and tearing fangs
of Terkoz.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they fought a dozen seconds ere they were rolling
upon the ground, striking, tearing and rending&mdash;two great
savage beasts battling to the death.</p>

<p>Terkoz had a dozen knife wounds on head and breast, and Tarzan
was torn and bleeding&mdash;his scalp in one place half torn from
his head so that a great piece hung down over one eye,
obstructing his vision.</p>

<p>But so far the young Englishman had been able to keep those
horrible fangs from his jugular and now, as they fought less
fiercely for a moment, to regain their breath, Tarzan formed a
cunning plan. He would work his way to the other's back and,
clinging there with tooth and nail, drive his knife home until
Terkoz was no more.</p>

<p>The maneuver was accomplished more easily than he had hoped,
for the stupid beast, not knowing what Tarzan was attempting,
made no particular effort to prevent the accomplishment of the
design.</p>

<p>But when, finally, he realized that his antagonist was
fastened to him where his teeth and fists alike were useless
against him, Terkoz hurled himself about upon the ground so
violently that Tarzan could but cling desperately to the leaping,
turning, twisting body, and ere he had struck a blow the knife
was hurled from his hand by a heavy impact against the earth, and
Tarzan found himself defenseless.</p>

<p>During the rollings and squirmings of the next few minutes,
Tarzan's hold was loosened a dozen times until finally an
accidental circumstance of those swift and ever-changing
evolutions gave him a new hold with his right hand, which he soon
realized was absolutely unassailable.</p>

<p>His arm was passed beneath Terkoz's arm from behind and his
hand and forearm encircled the back of Terkoz's neck. It was the
half-Nelson of modern wrestling which the untaught ape-man had
stumbled upon, but divine reason showed him in an instant the
value of the thing he had discovered. It was the difference to
him between life and death.</p>

<p>And so he struggled to encompass a similar hold with the left
hand, and in a few moments Terkoz's bull neck was creaking
beneath a full-Nelson.</p>

<p>There was no more lunging about now. The two lay perfectly
still upon the ground, Tarzan upon Terkoz's back. Slowly the
bullet head of the ape was being forced lower and lower upon his
chest.</p>

<p>Tarzan knew what the result would be. In an instant the neck
would break. Then there came to Terkoz's rescue the same thing
that had put him in these sore straits&mdash;a man's reasoning
power.</p>

<p>"If I kill him," thought Tarzan, "what advantage will it be to
me? Will it not but rob the tribe of a great fighter? And if
Terkoz be dead, he will know nothing of my supremacy, while alive
he will ever be an example to the other apes."</p>

<p><i>"Ka-goda?"</i> hissed Tarzan in Terkoz's ear, which, in ape
tongue, means, freely translated: "Do you surrender?"</p>

<p>For a moment there was no reply, and Tarzan added a few more
ounces of pressure, which elicited a horrified shriek of pain
from the great beast.</p>

<p><i>"Ka-goda?"</i> repeated Tarzan.</p>

<p><i>"Ka-goda!"</i> cried Terkoz.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Tarzan, easing up a trifle, but not releasing
his hold. "I am Tarzan, King of the Apes&mdash;mighty hunter,
mighty fighter. In all the jungle there is none so great.</p>

<p>"You have said: <i>'Ka-goda'</i> to me. All the tribe have
heard. Quarrel no more with your king or your people, for next
time I shall kill. Do you understand?"</p>

<p><i>"Huh,"</i> assented Terkoz.</p>

<p>"And you are satisfied?"</p>

<p><i>"Huh,"</i> said the ape.</p>

<p>Tarzan let him up, and in a few minutes all were back at their
vocations, as though naught had occurred to mar the tranquility
of their primeval forest haunts.</p>

<p>But deep in the minds of the apes was rooted the conviction
that Tarzan was a mighty fighter and a strange creature. Strange
because he had had it in his power to kill his enemy, but had
allowed him to live&mdash;unharmed.</p>

<p>That afternoon as the tribe came together, as was their wont
before darkness settled on the jungle, Tarzan, his wounds washed
in the limpid waters of the little stream, called the old males
about him.</p>

<p>"You have seen again today that Tarzan of the Apes is the
greatest among you," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Huh,</i>" they replied with one voice, "Tarzan is
great."</p>

<p>"Tarzan," he continued, "is not an ape. He is not like his
people. His ways are not their ways, and so Tarzan is going back
to the lair of his own kind by the waters of the great lake which
has no further shore. You must choose another to rule you, for
Tarzan will not return."</p>

<p>And thus young Lord Greystoke took the first step toward the
goal which he had set&mdash;the finding of other white men like
himself.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; HIS OWN KIND</h2>

<p class="first"> THE following morning, Tarzan, lame and sore
from the wounds of his battle with Terkoz, set out toward the
west and the seacoast.</p>

<p>He traveled very slowly, sleeping in the jungle at night, and
reaching his cabin late the following morning.</p>

<p>For several days he moved about but little, only enough to
gather what fruit and nuts he required to satisfy the demands of
hunger.</p>

<p>In ten days he was quite sound again, except for a terrible,
half-healed scar, which, starting above his left eye ran across
the top of his head, ending at the right ear. It was the mark
left by Terkoz when he had torn the scalp away.</p>

<p>During his convalescence Tarzan tried to fashion a mantle from
the skin of Sabor, which had lain all this time in the cabin. But
he found the hide had dried as stiff as a board, and as he knew
naught of tanning, he was forced to abandon his cherished
plan.</p>

<p>Then he determined to filch what few garments he could from
one of the black men of Mbonga's village, for Tarzan of the Apes
had decided to mark his evolution from the lower orders in every
possible manner, and nothing seemed to him a more distinguishing
badge of manhood than ornaments and clothing.</p>

<p>To this end, therefore, he collected the various arm and leg
ornaments he had taken from the black warriors who had succumbed
to his swift and silent noose, and donned them all after the way
he had seen them worn.</p>

<p>About his neck hung the golden chain from which depended the
diamond encrusted locket of his mother, the Lady Alice. At his
back was a quiver of arrows slung from a leathern shoulder belt,
another piece of loot from some vanquished black.</p>

<p>About his waist was a belt of tiny strips of rawhide fashioned
by himself as a support for the home-made scabbard in which hung
his father's hunting knife. The long bow which had been Kulonga's
hung over his left shoulder.</p>

<p>The young Lord Greystoke was indeed a strange and warlike
figure, his mass of black hair falling to his shoulders behind
and cut with his hunting knife to a rude bang upon his forehead,
that it might not fall before his eyes.</p>

<p>His straight and perfect figure, muscled as the best of the
ancient Roman gladiators must have been muscled, and yet with the
soft and sinuous curves of a Greek god, told at a glance the
wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and
speed.</p>

<p>A personification, was Tarzan of the Apes, of the primitive
man, the hunter, the warrior.</p>

<p>With the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad
shoulders, and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine,
clear eyes, he might readily have typified some demi-god of a
wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest.</p>

<p>But of these things Tarzan did not think. He was worried
because he had no clothing to indicate to all the jungle folks
that he was a man and not an ape, and grave doubt often entered
his mind as to whether he might not yet become an ape.</p>

<p>Was not hair commencing to grow upon his face? All the apes
had hair upon theirs, but the black men were entirely hairless,
with very few exceptions.</p>

<p>True, he had seen pictures in his books of men with great
masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin, but, nevertheless,
Tarzan was afraid. Almost daily he whetted his keen knife and
scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this
degrading emblem of apehood.</p>

<p>And so he learned to shave&mdash;rudely and painfully, it is
true&mdash;but, nevertheless, effectively.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When he felt quite strong again, after his bloody battle with
Terkoz, Tarzan set off one morning towards Mbonga's village. He
was moving carelessly along a winding jungle trail, instead of
making his progress through the trees, when suddenly he came face
to face with a black warrior.</p>

<p>The look of surprise on the savage face was almost comical,
and before Tarzan could unsling his bow the fellow had turned and
fled down the path crying out in alarm as though to others before
him.</p>

<p>Tarzan took to the trees in pursuit, and in a few moments came
in view of the men desperately striving to escape.</p>

<p>There were three of them, and they were racing madly in single
file through the dense undergrowth.</p>

<p>Tarzan easily distanced them, nor did they see his silent
passage above their heads, nor note the crouching figure squatted
upon a low branch ahead of them beneath which the trail led
them.</p>

<p>Tarzan let the first two pass beneath him, but as the third
came swiftly on, the quiet noose dropped about the black throat.
A quick jerk drew it taut.</p>

<p>There was an agonized scream from the victim, and his fellows
turned to see his struggling body rise as by magic slowly into
the dense foliage of the trees above.</p>

<p>With affrighted shrieks they wheeled once more and plunged on
in their efforts to escape.</p>

<p>Tarzan dispatched his prisoner quickly and silently; removed
the weapons and ornaments, and&mdash;oh, the greatest joy of
all&mdash;a handsome doeskin breechcloth, which he quickly
transferred to his own person.</p>

<p>Now indeed was he dressed as a man should be. None there was
who could now doubt his high origin. How he should liked to have
returned to the tribe to parade before their envious gaze this
wondrous finery.</p>

<p>Taking the body across his shoulder, he moved more slowly
through the trees toward the little palisaded village, for he
again needed arrows.</p>

<p>As he approached quite close to the enclosure he saw an
excited group surrounding the two fugitives, who, trembling with
fright and exhaustion, were scarce able to recount the uncanny
details of their adventure.</p>

<p>Mirando, they said, who had been ahead of them a short
distance, had suddenly come screaming toward them, crying that a
terrible white and naked warrior was pursuing him. The three of
them had hurried toward the village as rapidly as their legs
would carry them.</p>

<p>Again Mirando's shrill cry of mortal terror had caused them to
look back, and there they had seen the most horrible
sight&mdash;their companion's body flying upwards into the trees,
his arms and legs beating the air and his tongue protruding from
his open mouth. No other sound did he utter nor was there any
creature in sight about him.</p>

<p>The villagers were worked up into a state of fear bordering on
panic, but wise old Mbonga affected to feel considerable
skepticism regarding the tale, and attributed the whole
fabrication to their fright in the face of some real danger.</p>

<p>"You tell us this great story," he said, "because you do not
dare to speak the truth. You do not dare admit that when the lion
sprang upon Mirando you ran away and left him. You are
cowards."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mbonga ceased speaking when a great crashing of
branches in the trees above them caused the blacks to look up in
renewed terror. The sight that met their eyes made even wise old
Mbonga shudder, for there, turning and twisting in the air, came
the dead body of Mirando, to sprawl with a sickening
reverberation upon the ground at their feet.</p>

<p>With one accord the blacks took to their heels; nor did they
stop until the last of them was lost in the dense shadows of the
surrounding jungle.</p>

<p>Again Tarzan came down into the village and renewed his supply
of arrows, and ate of the offering of food which the blacks had
made to appease his wrath.</p>

<p>Before he left he carried the body of Mirando to the gate of
the village, and propped it up against the palisade in such a way
that the dead face seemed to be peering around the edge of the
gate-post down the path which led to the jungle.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan returned, hunting, always hunting, to the cabin by
the beach.</p>

<p>It took a dozen attempts on the part of the thoroughly
frightened blacks to re-enter their village, past the horrible,
grinning face of their dead fellow, and when they found the food
and arrows gone they knew, what they had only too well feared,
that Mirando had seen the evil spirit of the jungle.</p>

<p>That now seemed to them the logical explanation. Only those
who saw this terrible god of the jungle died; for was it not true
that none left alive in the village had ever seen him? Therefore,
those who had died at his hands must have seen him and paid the
penalty with their lives.</p>

<p>As long as they supplied him with arrows and food he would not
harm them unless they looked upon him, so it was ordered by
Mbonga that in addition to the food offering there should also be
laid out an offering of arrows for this Munango-Keewati, and this
was done from then on.</p>

<p>If you ever chance to pass that far off African village you
will still see before a tiny thatched hut, built just without the
village, a little iron pot in which is a quantity of food, and
beside it a quiver of well-daubed arrows.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Tarzan came in sight of the beach where stood his cabin,
a strange and unusual spectacle met his vision.</p>

<p>On the placid waters of the land-locked harbor floated a great
ship, and on the beach a small boat was drawn up.</p>

<p>But, most wonderful of all, a number of white men like himself
were moving about between the beach and his cabin.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw that in many ways they were like the men of his
picture books. He crept closer through the trees until he was
quite close above them.</p>

<p>There were ten men. Swarthy, sun-tanned, villainous looking
fellows. Now they had congregated by the boat and were talking in
loud, angry tones, with much gesticulating and shaking of
fists.</p>

<p>Presently one of them, a little, mean-faced, black-bearded
fellow with a countenance which reminded Tarzan of Pamba, the
rat, laid his hand upon the shoulder of a giant who stood next to
him, and with whom all the others had been arguing and
quarreling.</p>

<p>The little man pointed inland, so that the giant was forced to
turn away from the others to look in the direction indicated. As
he turned, the little, mean-faced man drew a revolver from his
belt and shot the giant in the back.</p>

<p>The big fellow threw his hands above his head, his knees bent
beneath him, and without a sound he tumbled forward upon the
beach, dead.</p>

<p>The report of the weapon, the first that Tarzan had ever
heard, filled him with wonderment, but even this unaccustomed
sound could not startle his healthy nerves into even a semblance
of panic.</p>

<p>The conduct of the white strangers it was that caused him the
greatest perturbation. He puckered his brows into a frown of deep
thought. It was well, thought he, that he had not given way to
his first impulse to rush forward and greet these white men as
brothers.</p>

<p>They were evidently no different from the black men&mdash;no
more civilized than the apes&mdash;no less cruel than Sabor.</p>

<p>For a moment the others stood looking at the little, mean-faced man and the giant lying dead upon the beach.</p>

<p>Then one of them laughed and slapped the little man upon the
back. There was much more talk and gesticulating, but less
quarreling.</p>

<p>Presently they launched the boat and all jumped into it and
rowed away toward the great ship, where Tarzan could see other
figures moving about upon the deck.</p>

<p>When they had clambered aboard, Tarzan dropped to earth behind
a great tree and crept to his cabin, keeping it always between
himself and the ship.</p>

<p>Slipping in at the door he found that everything had been
ransacked. His books and pencils strewed the floor. His weapons
and shields and other little store of treasures were littered
about.</p>

<p>As he saw what had been done a great wave of anger surged
through him, and the new made scar upon his forehead stood
suddenly out, a bar of inflamed crimson against his tawny
hide.</p>

<p>Quickly he ran to the cupboard and searched in the far recess
of the lower shelf. Ah! He breathed a sigh of relief as he drew
out the little tin box, and, opening it, found his greatest
treasures undisturbed.</p>

<p>The photograph of the smiling, strong-faced young man, and the
little black puzzle book were safe.</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>His quick ear had caught a faint but unfamiliar sound.</p>

<p>Running to the window Tarzan looked toward the harbor, and
there he saw that a boat was being lowered from the great ship
beside the one already in the water. Soon he saw many people
clambering over the sides of the larger vessel and dropping into
the boats. They were coming back in full force.</p>

<p>For a moment longer Tarzan watched while a number of boxes and
bundles were lowered into the waiting boats, then, as they shoved
off from the ship's side, the ape-man snatched up a piece of
paper, and with a pencil printed on it for a few moments until it
bore several lines of strong, well-made, almost letter-perfect
characters.</p>

<p>This notice he stuck upon the door with a small sharp splinter
of wood. Then gathering up his precious tin box, his arrows, and
as many bows and spears as he could carry, he hastened through
the door and disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p>When the two boats were beached upon the silvery sand it was a
strange assortment of humanity that clambered ashore.</p>

<p>Some twenty souls in all there were, if the fifteen rough and
villainous appearing seamen could have been said to possess that
immortal spark, since they were, forsooth, a most filthy and
bloodthirsty looking aggregation.</p>

<p>The others of the party were of different stamp.</p>

<p>One was an elderly man, with white hair and large rimmed
spectacles. His slightly stooped shoulders were draped in an ill-
fitting, though immaculate, frock-coat; a shiny silk hat added to
the incongruity of his garb in an African jungle.</p>

<p>The second member of the party to land was a tall young man in
white ducks, while directly behind came another elderly man with
a very high forehead and a fussy, excitable manner.</p>

<p>After these came a huge negress clothed like Solomon as to
colors. Her great eyes rolling in evident terror first toward the
jungle and then toward the cursing band of sailors who were
removing the bales and boxes from the boats.</p>

<p>The last member of the party to disembark was a girl of about
nineteen, and it was the young man who stood at the boat's bow to
lift her high and dry upon land. She gave him a brave and pretty
smile of thanks, but no words passed between them.</p>

<p>In silence the party advanced toward the cabin. It was evident
that whatever their intentions, all had been decided upon before
they left the ship; and so they came to the door, the sailors
carrying the boxes and bales, followed by the five who were of so
different a class. The men put down their burdens, and then one
caught sight of the notice which Tarzan had posted.</p>

<p>"Ho, mates!" he cried. "What's here? This sign was not posted
an hour ago or I'll eat the cook."</p>

<p>The others gathered about, craning their necks over the
shoulders of those before them, but as few of them could read at
all, and then only after the most laborious fashion, one finally
turned to the little old man of the top hat and frock-coat.</p>

<p>"Hi, perfesser," he called, "step for'rd and read the bloomin'
notis."</p>

<p>Thus addressed, the old man came slowly to where the sailors
stood, followed by the other members of his party. Adjusting his
spectacles he looked for a moment at the placard and then,
turning away, strolled off muttering to himself: "Most
remarkable&mdash;most remarkable!"</p>

<p>"Hi, old fossil," cried the man who had first called on him
for assistance, "did je think we wanted of you to read the
bloomin' notis to yourself? Come back here and read it out loud,
you old barnacle."</p>

<p>The old man stopped and, turning back, said: "Oh, yes, my dear
sir, a thousand pardons. It was quite thoughtless of me,
yes&mdash;very thoughtless. Most remarkable&mdash;most
remarkable!"</p>

<p>Again he faced the notice and read it through, and doubtless
would have turned off again to ruminate upon it had not the
sailor grasped him roughly by the collar and howled into his
ear:</p>

<p>"Read it out loud, you blithering, old idiot."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes indeed, yes indeed," replied the professor softly,
and adjusting his spectacles once more he read aloud:</p> <BR>

<p class="sign">"THIS IS THE HOUSE OF<br> TARZAN, THE KILLER
OF<br> BEASTS AND MANY BLACK<br> MEN. DO NOT HARM THE<br> THINGS
WHICH ARE TARZAN'S.<br> TARZAN WATCHES.<br> TARZAN OF THE
APES."</p><br>


<p>"Who the devil is Tarzan?" cried the sailor who had before
spoken.</p>

<p>"He evidently speaks English," said the young man.</p>

<p>"But what does 'Tarzan of the Apes' mean?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Miss Porter," replied the young man, "unless
we have discovered a runaway simian from the London Zoo who has
brought back a European education to his jungle home. What do you
make of it, Professor Porter?" he added, turning to the old
man.</p>

<p>Professor Archimedes Q. Porter adjusted his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, indeed; yes indeed&mdash;most remarkable, most
remarkable!" said the professor; "but I can add nothing further
to what I have already remarked in elucidation of this truly
momentous occurrence," and the professor turned slowly in the
direction of the jungle.</p>

<p>"But, papa," cried the girl, "you haven't said anything about
it yet."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut, child; tut&mdash;tut," responded Professor
Porter, in a kindly and indulgent tone, "do not trouble your
pretty head with such weighty, and abstruse problems," and again
he wandered slowly off in still another direction, his eyes bent
upon the ground at his feet, his hands clasped behind him beneath
the flowing tails of his coat.</p>

<p>"I reckon the daffy old bounder don't know no more'n we do
about it," growled the rat-faced sailor.</p>

<p>"Keep a civil tongue in your head," cried the young man, his
face paling in anger, at the insulting tone of the sailor.
"You've murdered our officers, and robbed us. We are absolutely
in your power, but you'll treat Professor Porter and Miss Porter
with respect or I'll break that vile neck of yours with my bare
hands&mdash;guns or no guns," and the young fellow stepped so
close to the rat-faced sailor that the latter, though he bore two
revolvers and a villainous looking knife in his belt, slunk back
abashed.</p>

<p>"You damned coward," cried the young man. "You'd never dare
shoot a man until his back was turned. You don't dare shoot me
even then," and he deliberately turned his back full upon the
sailor and walked nonchalantly away as if to put him to the
test.</p>

<p>The sailor's hand crept slyly to the butt of one of his
revolvers; his wicked eyes glared vengefully at the retreating
form of the young Englishman. The gaze of his fellows was upon
him, but still he hesitated. At heart he was even a greater
coward than Mr. William Cecil Clayton had imagined.</p>

<p>What he would have done will never be known, for there was
another factor abroad which none of the party had yet guessed
would enter so largely into the problems of their life on this
inhospitable African shore.</p>

<p>Two keen eyes had watched every move of the party from the
foliage of a nearby tree. Tarzan had seen the surprise caused by
his notice, and while he could understand nothing of the spoken
language of these strange people their gestures and facial
expressions told him much.</p>

<p>The act of the little rat-faced sailor in killing one of his
comrades had aroused a strong dislike in Tarzan, and now that he
saw him quarreling with the fine-looking young man his animosity
was still further stirred.</p>

<p>Tarzan had never seen the effects of a firearm before, though
his books had taught him something of them, but when he saw the
rat-faced one fingering the butt of his revolver he thought of
the scene he had witnessed so short a time before, and naturally
expected to see the young man murdered as had been the huge
sailor earlier in the day.</p>

<p>So Tarzan fitted a poisoned arrow to his bow and drew a bead
upon the rat-faced sailor, but the foliage was so thick that he
soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves or some small
branch, and instead he launched a heavy spear from his lofty
perch.</p>

<p>Clayton had taken but a dozen steps. The rat-faced sailor had
half drawn his revolver; the other sailors stood watching the
scene intently.</p>

<p>Professor Porter had already disappeared into the jungle,
whither he was being followed by the fussy Samuel T. Philander,
his secretary and assistant.</p>

<p>Esmeralda, the negress, was busy sorting her mistress' baggage
from the pile of bales and boxes beside the cabin, and Miss
Porter had turned away to follow Clayton, when something caused
her to turn again toward the sailor.</p>

<p>And then three things happened almost simultaneously&mdash;the sailor jerked out his weapon and leveled it at Clayton's
back, Miss Porter screamed a warning, and a long, metal-shod
spear shot like a bolt from above and passed entirely through the
right shoulder of the rat-faced man.</p>

<p>The revolver exploded harmlessly in the air, and the seaman
crumpled up with a scream of pain and terror.</p>

<p>Clayton turned and rushed back toward the scene. The sailors
stood in a frightened group, with drawn weapons, peering into the
jungle. The wounded man writhed and shrieked upon the ground.</p>

<p>Clayton, unseen by any, picked up the fallen revolver and
slipped it inside his shirt, then he joined the sailors in
gazing, mystified, into the jungle.</p>

<p>"Who could it have been?" whispered Jane Porter, and the young
man turned to see her standing, wide-eyed and wondering, close
beside him.</p>

<p>"I dare say Tarzan of the Apes is watching us all right," he
answered, in a dubious tone. "I wonder, now, who that spear was
intended for. If for Snipes, then our ape friend is a friend
indeed.</p>

<p>"By jove, where are your father and Mr. Philander? There's
some one or something in that jungle, and it's armed, whatever it
is. Ho! Professor! Mr. Philander!" young Clayton shouted. There
was no response.</p>

<p>"What's to be done, Miss Porter?" continued the young man, his
face clouded by a frown of worry and indecision.</p>

<p>"I can't leave you here alone with these cutthroats, and you
certainly can't venture into the jungle with me; yet some one
must go in search of your father. He is more than apt to
wandering off aimlessly, regardless of danger or direction, and
Mr. Philander is only a trifle less impractical than he. You will
pardon my bluntness, but our lives are all in jeopardy here, and
when we get your father back something must be done to impress
upon him the dangers to which he exposes you as well as himself
by his absent-mindedness."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," replied the girl, "and I am not
offended at all. Dear old papa would sacrifice his life for me
without an instant's hesitation, provided one could keep his mind
on so frivolous a matter for an entire instant. There is only one
way to keep him in safety, and that is to chain him to a tree.
The poor dear is <i>so</i> impractical."</p>

<p>"I have it!" suddenly exclaimed Clayton. "You can use a
revolver, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"I have one. With it you and Esmeralda will be comparatively
safe in this cabin while I am searching for your father and Mr.
Philander. Come, call the woman and I will hurry on. They can't
have gone far."</p>

<p>Jane Porter did as he suggested and when he saw the door close
safely behind them Clayton turned toward the jungle.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors were drawing the spear from their wounded
comrade and, as Clayton approached, he asked if he could borrow a
revolver from one of them while he searched the jungle for the
professor.</p>

<p>The rat-faced one, finding he was not dead, had regained his
composure, and with a volley of oaths directed at Clayton refused
in the name of his fellows to allow the young man any
firearms.</p>

<p>This man, Snipes, had assumed the role of chief since he had
killed their former leader, and so little time had elapsed that
none of his companions had as yet questioned his authority.</p>

<p>Clayton's only response was a shrug of the shoulders, but as
he left them he picked up the spear which had transfixed Snipes,
and thus primitively armed, the son of the then Lord Greystoke
strode into the dense jungle.</p>

<p>Every few moments he called aloud the names of the wanderers.
The watchers in the cabin by the beach heard the sound of his
voice growing ever fainter and fainter, until at last it was
swallowed up by the myriad noises of the primeval wood.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his assistant, Samuel
T. Philander, after much insistence on the part of the latter,
had finally turned their steps toward camp, they were as
completely lost in the wild and tangled labyrinth of the matted
jungle as two human beings well could be, though they did not
know it.</p>

<p>It was by the merest caprice of fortune that they headed
toward the west coast of Africa, instead of toward Zanzibar on
the opposite side of the dark continent.</p>

<p>When in a short time they reached the beach, only to find no
camp in sight, Philander was positive that they were north of
their proper destination, while, as a matter of fact they were
about two hundred yards south of it.</p>

<p>It never occurred to either of these impractical theorists to
call aloud on the chance of attracting their friends' attention.
Instead, with all the assurance that deductive reasoning from a
wrong premise induces in one, Mr. Samuel T. Philander grasped
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter firmly by the arm and hurried the
weakly protesting old gentleman off in the direction of Cape
Town, fifteen hundred miles to the south.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Jane Porter and Esmeralda found themselves safely behind
the cabin door the negress's first thought was to barricade the
portal from the inside. With this idea in mind she turned to
search for some means of putting it into execution; but her first
view of the interior of the cabin brought a shriek of terror to
her lips, and like a frightened child the huge black ran to bury
her face on her mistress' shoulder.</p>

<p>Jane Porter, turning at the cry, saw the cause of it lying
prone upon the floor before them&mdash;the whitened skeleton of a
man. A further glance revealed a second skeleton upon the
bed.</p>

<p>"What horrible place are we in?" murmured the awestruck girl.
But there was no panic in her fright.</p>

<p>At last, disengaging herself from the frantic clutch of the
still shrieking Esmeralda, Jane Porter crossed the room to look
into the little cradle, knowing what she should see there before
ever the tiny skeleton disclosed itself in all its pitiful and
pathetic frailty.</p>

<p>What an awful tragedy these poor mute bones proclaimed! The
girl shuddered at the thought of the eventualities which might lie
before herself and her friends in this ill-fated cabin; the haunt
of mysterious, perhaps hostile, beings.</p>

<p>Quickly, with an impatient stamp of her little foot, she
endeavored to shake off the gloomy forebodings, and turning to
Esmeralda bade her cease her wailing.</p>

<p>"Stop, Esmeralda; stop it this minute!" she cried. "You are
only making it worse. Why, I never saw such a big baby."</p>

<p>She ended lamely, a little quiver in her own voice as she
thought of the three men, upon whom she depended for protection,
wandering in the depth of that awful forest.</p>

<p>Soon the girl found that the door was equipped with a heavy
wooden bar upon the inside, and after several efforts the
combined strength of the two enabled them to slip it into place,
the first time in twenty years.</p>

<p>Then they sat down upon a bench with their arms about one
another, and waited.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; AT THE MERCY OF THE
JUNGLE</h2>

<p class="first"> AFTER Clayton had plunged into the jungle, the
sailors&mdash;mutineers of the <i>Arrow</i>&mdash;fell into a
discussion of their next step; but on one point all were
agreed&mdash;that they should hasten to put off to the anchored
<i>Arrow,</i> where they could at least be safe from the spears
of their unseen foe. And so, while Jane Porter and Esmeralda were
barricading themselves within the cabin, the cowardly crew of
cutthroats were pulling rapidly for their ship in the two boats
that had brought them ashore.</p>

<p>So much had Tarzan seen that day that his head was in a whirl
of wonder. But the most wonderful sight of all, to him, was the
face of the beautiful white girl.</p>

<p>Here at last was one of his own kind; of that he was positive.
And the young man and the two old men; they, too, were much as he
had pictured his own people to be.</p>

<p>But doubtless they were as ferocious and cruel as other men he
had seen. The fact that they alone of all the party were unarmed
might account for the fact that they had killed no one. They
might be very different if provided with weapons.</p>

<p>Tarzan had seen the young man pick up the fallen revolver of
the wounded Snipes and hide it away in his breast; and he had
also seen him slip it cautiously to the girl as she entered the
cabin door.</p>

<p>He did not understand anything of the motives behind all that
he had seen; but, somehow, intuitively he liked the young man and
the two old men, and for the girl he had a strange longing which
he scarcely understood. As for the big black woman, she was
evidently connected in some way to the girl, and so he liked her,
also.</p>

<p>For the sailors, and especially Snipes, he had developed a
great hatred. He knew by their threatening gestures and by the
expressions upon their evil faces that they were enemies of the
others of the party, and so he decided to watch them closely.</p>

<p>Tarzan wondered why the men had gone into the jungle, nor did
it ever occur to him that one could become lost in that maze of
undergrowth which to him was as simple as is the main street of
your own home town to you.</p>

<p>When he saw the sailors row away toward the ship, and knew
that the girl and her companion were safe in his cabin, Tarzan
decided to follow the young man into the jungle and learn what
his errand might be. He swung off rapidly in the direction taken
by Clayton, and in a short time heard faintly in the distance the
now only occasional calls of the Englishman to his friends.</p>

<p>Presently Tarzan came up with the white man, who, almost
fagged, was leaning against a tree wiping the perspiration from
his forehead. The ape-man, hiding safe behind a screen of
foliage, sat watching this new specimen of his own race
intently.</p>

<p>At intervals Clayton called aloud and finally it came to
Tarzan that he was searching for the old man.</p>

<p>Tarzan was on the point of going off to look for them himself,
when he caught the yellow glint of a sleek hide moving cautiously
through the jungle toward Clayton.</p>

<p>It was Sheeta, the leopard. Now, Tarzan heard the soft bending
of grasses and wondered why the young white man was not warned.
Could it be he had failed to note the loud warning? Never before
had Tarzan known Sheeta to be so clumsy.</p>

<p>No, the white man did not hear. Sheeta was crouching for the
spring, and then, shrill and horrible, there rose upon the
stillness of the jungle the awful cry of the challenging ape, and
Sheeta turned, crashing into the underbrush.</p>

<p>Clayton came to his feet with a start. His blood ran cold.
Never in all his life had so fearful a sound smote upon his ears.
He was no coward; but if ever man felt the icy fingers of fear
upon his heart, William Cecil Clayton, eldest son of Lord
Greystoke of England, did that day in the fastness of the African
jungle.</p>

<p>The noise of some great body crashing through the underbrush
so close beside him, and the sound of that blood-curdling shriek
from above, tested Clayton's courage to the limit; but he could
not know that it was to that very voice he owed his life, nor
that the creature who hurled it forth was his own cousin&mdash;the real Lord Greystoke.</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close, and Clayton,
disheartened and discouraged, was in a terrible quandary as to
the proper course to pursue; whether to keep on in search of
Professor Porter, at the almost certain risk of his own death in
the jungle by night, or to return to the cabin where he might at
least serve to protect Jane Porter from the perils which
confronted her on all sides.</p>

<p>He disliked to return to camp without her father; still more,
he shrank from the thought of leaving her alone and unprotected
in the hands of the mutineers of the <i>Arrow,</i> or to the
hundred unknown dangers of the jungle.</p>

<p>Possibly, too, he thought, ere this the professor and
Philander had returned to camp. Yes, that was more than likely.
At least he would return and see, before he continued what bade
fare to be a most fruitless quest. And so he started, stumbling
back through the thick and matted underbrush in the direction
that he thought the cabin lay.</p>

<p>To Tarzan's surprise the young man was heading further into
the jungle in the general direction of Mbonga's village, and the
shrewd young ape-man was convinced that he was lost.</p>

<p>To Tarzan this was scarcely comprehensible; but his judgment
told him that no man would venture toward the village of the
cruel blacks armed only with a spear which, from the awkward way
in which he carried it, was evidently an unaccustomed weapon to
this white man. Nor was he following the trail of the old men.
That, they had crossed and left long since, though it had been
fresh and plain before Tarzan's eyes.</p>

<p>Tarzan was perplexed. The fierce jungle would make easy prey
of this unprotected stranger in a very short time if he were not
guided quickly to the beach.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Numa, the lion, even now, stalking the white
man a dozen paces to the right.</p>

<p>Clayton heard the great body paralleling his course, and now
there rose upon the evening air the beast's thunderous roar. The
man stopped with upraised spear and faced the brush from which
issued the awful sound. The shadows were deepening, darkness was
settling in.</p>

<p>God! To die here alone, beneath the fangs of wild beasts; to
be torn and rended; to feel the hot breath of the brute on his
face as the great paw crushed down upon his breast!</p>

<p>For a moment all was still. Clayton stood rigid, with raised
spear. Presently a faint rustling of the bush apprised him of the
stealthy creeping of the thing behind. It was gathering for the
spring. At last he saw it, not twenty feet away&mdash;the long,
lithe, muscular body and tawny head of a huge black-maned
lion.</p>

<p>The beast was upon its belly, moving forward very slowly. As
its eyes met Clayton's it stopped, and deliberately, cautiously
gathered its hind quarters beneath it.</p>

<p>In agony the man watched; fearful to launch his spear;
powerless to fly.</p>

<p>He heard a noise in the tree above him. Some new danger, he
thought, but he dared not take his eyes from the yellow green
orbs before him. There was a sharp twang as of a broken banjo-string, and at the same instant an arrow appeared in the yellow
hide of the crouching lion.</p>

<p>With a roar of pain and anger the beast sprang; but, somehow,
Clayton stumbled to one side, and as he turned again to face the
infuriated king of beasts, he was appalled at the sight which
confronted him. Almost simultaneously with the lion's turning to
renew the attack a naked giant dropped from the tree above
squarely on the brute's back.</p>

<p>With lightning speed an arm that was banded layers of iron
muscle encircled the huge neck, and the great beast was raised
from behind, roaring and pawing the air&mdash;raised as easily as
Clayton would have lifted a pet dog.</p>

<p>The scene he witnessed there in the twilight depths of the
African jungle was burned forever into the Englishman's
brain.</p>

<p>The man before him was the embodiment of physical perfection
and giant strength, yet it was not upon these he depended in his
battle with the great cat, for, mighty as were his muscles, they
were as nothing by comparison with Numa's. To his agility, to his
brain and to his long keen knife he owed his supremacy.</p>

<p>His right arm encircled the lion's neck, while the left hand
plunged the knife time and again into the unprotected side behind
the left shoulder. The infuriated beast, pulled up and backwards
until he stood upon his hind legs, struggled impotently in this
unnatural position.</p>

<p>Had the battle been of a few seconds' longer duration the
outcome might have been different, but it was all accomplished so
quickly that the lion had scarce time to recover from the
confusion of its surprise ere it sank lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>Then the strange figure which had vanquished it stood erect
upon the carcass, and throwing back the wild and handsome head,
gave out the fearsome cry which a few moments earlier had so
startled Clayton.</p>

<p>Before him he saw the figure of a young man, naked except for
a loin cloth and a few barbaric ornaments about arms and legs; on
the breast a priceless diamond locket gleaming against a smooth
brown skin.</p>

<p>The hunting knife had been returned to its homely sheath, and
the man was gathering up his bow and quiver from where he had
tossed them, when he leaped to attack the lion.</p>

<p>Clayton spoke to the stranger in English, thanking him for his
brave rescue and complimenting him on the wondrous strength and
dexterity he had displayed, but the only answer was a steady
stare and a faint shrug of the mighty shoulders, which might
betoken either disparagement of the service rendered, or
ignorance of Clayton's language.</p>

<p>When the bow and quiver had been slung to his back the wild
man, for such Clayton now thought him, once more drew his knife
and deftly carved a dozen large strips of meat from the lion's
carcass. Then, squatting upon his haunches, he proceeded to eat,
first motioning Clayton to join him.</p>

<p>The strong white teeth sank into the raw and dripping flesh in
apparent relish of the meal, but Clayton could not bring himself
to share the uncooked meat with his strange host; instead he
watched him, and presently there dawned upon him the conviction
that this was Tarzan of the Apes, whose notice he had seen posted
upon the cabin door that morning.</p>

<p>If so, he must speak English.</p>

<p>Again Clayton essayed speech with the ape-man; but the
replies, now vocal, were in a strange tongue, which resembled the
chattering of monkeys mingled with the growling of some wild
beast.</p>

<p>No, this could not be Tarzan of the Apes, for it was very
evident that he was an utter stranger to English.</p>

<p>When Tarzan had completed his repast he rose and, pointing in
a very different direction from that which Clayton had been
pursuing, started off through the jungle toward the point he had
indicated.</p>

<p>Clayton, bewildered and confused, hesitated to follow him, for
he thought he was but being led more deeply into the mazes of the
forest; but the ape-man, seeing him disinclined to follow,
returned, and, grasping him by the coat, dragged him along until
he was convinced that Clayton understood what was required of
him. Then he left him to follow voluntarily.</p>

<p>The Englishman, finally concluding that he was a prisoner, saw
no alternative open but to accompany his captor, and thus they
traveled slowly through the jungle while the sable mantle of the
impenetrable forest night fell about them, and the stealthy
footfalls of padded paws mingled with the breaking of twigs and
the wild calls of the savage life that Clayton felt closing in
upon him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Clayton heard the faint report of a firearm&mdash;a
single shot, and then silence.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>In the cabin by the beach two thoroughly terrified women clung
to each other as they crouched upon the low bench in the
gathering darkness.</p>

<p>The negress sobbed hysterically, bemoaning the evil day that
had witnessed her departure from her dear Maryland, while the
white girl, dry eyed and outwardly calm, was torn by inward fears
and forebodings. She feared not more for herself than for the
three men whom she knew to be wandering in the abysmal depths of
the savage jungle, from which she now heard issuing the almost
incessant shrieks and roars, barkings and growlings of its
terrifying and fearsome denizens as they sought their prey.</p>

<p>And now there came the sound of a heavy body brushing against
the side of the cabin. She could hear the great padded paws upon
the ground without. Then, for an instant, all was silence; even
the bedlam of the forest died to a faint murmur; then she
distinctly heard the beast without sniffing at the door, not two
feet from where she crouched. Instinctively the girl shuddered,
and shrank closer to the black woman.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "Hush, Esmeralda," for the woman's sobs
and groans seemed to have attracted the thing that stalked there
just beyond the thin wall.</p>

<p>A gentle scratching sound was heard on the door. The brute
tried to force an entrance; but presently this ceased, and again
she heard the great pads creeping stealthily around the cabin.
Again they stopped&mdash;beneath the window on which the
terrified eyes of the girl now glued themselves.</p>

<p>"God!" she murmured, for now, silhouetted against the moonlit
sky beyond, she saw framed in the tiny square of the latticed
window the head of a huge lioness. The gleaming eyes were fixed
upon her in intent ferocity.</p>

<p>"Look, Esmeralda!" she whispered. "For God's sake, what shall
we do? Look! Quick! The window!"</p>

<p>Esmeralda, cowering still closer to her mistress, took one
affrighted glance toward the little square of moonlight, just as
the lioness emitted a low, savage snarl.</p>

<p>The sight that met the poor black's eyes was too much for the
already overstrung nerves.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gaberelle!" she shrieked, and slid to the floor an inert
and senseless mass.</p>

<p>For what seemed an eternity the great brute stood with its
forepaws upon the sill, glaring into the little room. Presently
it tried the strength of the lattice with its great talons.</p>

<p>The girl had almost ceased to breathe, when, to her relief,
the head disappeared and she heard the brute's footsteps leaving
the window. But now they came to the door again, and once more
the scratching commenced; this time with increasing force until
the great beast was tearing at the massive panels in a perfect
frenzy of eagerness to seize its defenseless victims.</p>

<p>Could Jane Porter have known the immense strength of that
door, builded piece by piece, she would have felt less fear of
the lioness reaching her by this avenue.</p>

<p>Little did John Clayton imagine when he fashioned that crude
but mighty portal that one day, twenty years later, it would
shield a fair American girl, then unborn, from the teeth and
talons of a man-eater.</p>

<p>For fully twenty minutes the brute alternately sniffed and
tore at the door, occasionally giving voice to a wild, savage cry
of baffled rage. At length, however, she gave up the attempt, and
Jane Porter heard her returning toward the window, beneath which
she paused for an instant, and then launched her great weight
against the timeworn lattice.</p>

<p>The girl heard the wooden rods groan beneath the impact; but
they held, and the huge body dropped back to the ground
below.</p>

<p>Again and again the lioness repeated these tactics, until
finally the horrified prisoner within saw a portion of the
lattice give way, and in an instant one great paw and the head of
the animal were thrust within the room.</p>

<p>Slowly the powerful neck and shoulders spread the bars apart,
and the lithe body protruded further and further into the
room.</p>

<p>As in a trance, the girl rose, her hand upon her breast, wide
eyes staring horror-stricken into the snarling face of the beast
scarce ten feet from her. At her feet lay the prostrate form of
the negress. If she could but arouse her, their combined efforts
might possibly avail to beat back the fierce and bloodthirsty
intruder.</p>

<p>Jane Porter stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder.
Roughly she shook her.</p>

<p>"Esmeralda! Esmeralda!" she cried. "Help me, or we are
lost."</p>

<p>Esmeralda slowly opened her eyes. The first object they
encountered was the dripping fangs of the hungry lioness.</p>

<p>With a horrified scream the poor woman rose to her hands and
knees, and in this position scurried across the room, shrieking:
"O Gaberelle! O Gaberelle!" at the top of her lungs.</p>

<p>Esmeralda weighed some two hundred and eighty pounds, which
enhanced nothing the gazelle-like grace of her carriage when
walking erect, and her extreme haste, added to her extreme
corpulency, produced a most amazing result when Esmeralda elected
to travel on all fours.</p>

<p>For a moment the lioness remained quiet with intense gaze
directed upon the flitting Esmeralda, whose goal appeared to be
the cupboard, into which she attempted to propel her huge bulk;
but, as the shelves were but nine or ten inches apart, she only
succeeded in getting her head in, whereupon, with a final
screech, which paled the jungle noises into insignificance, she
fainted once again.</p>

<p>With the subsidence of Esmeralda the lioness renewed her
efforts to wriggle her huge bulk through the weakening
lattice.</p>

<p>The girl, standing pale and rigid against the further wall,
sought with ever-increasing terror for some loophole of escape.
Suddenly her hand, tight-pressed against her bosom, felt the hard
outline of the revolver that Clayton had left with her earlier in
the day.</p>

<p>Quickly she snatched it from its hiding-place, and, leveling
it full at the lioness's face, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>There was a flash of flame, the roar of the discharge, and an
answering roar of pain and anger from the beast.</p>

<p>Jane Porter saw the great form disappear from the window, and
then she, too, fainted, the revolver falling at her side.</p>

<p>But Sabor was not killed. The bullet had but inflicted a
painful wound in one of the great shoulders. It was the surprise
at the blinding flash and the deafening roar that had caused her
hasty, though but temporary, retreat.</p>

<p>In another instant she was back at the lattice, and with
renewed fury was clawing at the aperture, but with lessened
effect, since the wounded member was almost useless.</p>

<p>She saw her prey&mdash;the two women&mdash;lying senseless
upon the floor; there was no longer any resistance to be
overcome. Her meat lay before her, and Sabor had only to worm her
way through the lattice to claim it.</p>

<p>Slowly she forced her great bulk, inch by inch, through the
opening. Now her head was through, now one great forearm and
shoulder.</p>

<p>Carefully she drew up the wounded member to insinuate it
gently beyond the tight pressing bars.</p>

<p>A moment more and both shoulders through, the long, sinuous
body and the narrow hips would glide quickly after.</p>

<p>It was on this sight that Jane Porter again opened her
eyes.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE FOREST GOD</h2>

<p class="first"> WHEN Clayton heard the report of the firearm he
fell into an agony of fear and apprehension. He knew that one of
the sailors might be the author of it; but the fact that he had
left the revolver with Jane Porter, together with the overwrought
condition of his nerves, made him morbidly positive that she was
threatened with some great danger; perhaps even now attempting to
defend herself against some savage man or beast.</p>

<p>What were the thoughts of his strange captor or guide Clayton
could only vaguely conjecture; but that he had heard the shot,
and was in some manner effected by it was quite evident, for he
quickened his pace so appreciably that Clayton, stumbling blindly
in his wake, was down a dozen times in as many minutes in a vain
effort to keep pace with him, and soon was left hopelessly
behind.</p>

<p>Fearing that he would again be irretrievably lost, he called
aloud to the wild man ahead of him, and in a moment had the
satisfaction of seeing him drop lightly to his side from the
branches above.</p>

<p>For a moment Tarzan looked at the young man closely, as though
undecided as to just what was best to do; then, stooping down
before Clayton, he motioned him to grasp him about the neck, and,
with the white man upon his back, Tarzan took to the trees.</p>

<p>The next few minutes were such as the young Englishman never
forgot. High into bending and swaying branches he was borne with
what seemed to him incredible swiftness, while Tarzan chafed at
the slowness of his progress.</p>

<p>From one lofty branch the agile creature swung with Clayton
through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree; then for a hundred
yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs,
balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths of
verdure beneath.</p>

<p>From the first sensation of chilling fear Clayton passed to
one of keen admiration and envy of those giant muscles and that
wondrous instinct or knowledge which guided this forest god
through the inky blackness of the night as easily and safely as
Clayton could have strolled a London street at high noon.</p>

<p>Occasionally they would enter a spot where the foliage above
was less dense, and the bright rays of the moon lit up before
Clayton's wondering eyes the strange path they were
traversing.</p>

<p>At such times the man fairly caught his breath at sight of the
horrid depths below them, for Tarzan took the easiest way, which
often led over a hundred feet above the earth.</p>

<p>And yet with all his seeming speed, Tarzan was in reality
feeling his way with comparative slowness, searching constantly
for limbs of adequate strength for the maintenance of this double
weight.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the clearing before the beach. Tarzan's
quick ears had heard the strange sounds of Sabor's efforts to
force her way through the lattice, and it seemed to Clayton that
they dropped a straight hundred feet to earth, so quickly did
Tarzan descend. Yet when they struck the ground it was with
scarce a jar; and as Clayton released his hold on the ape-man he
saw him dart like a squirrel for the opposite side of the
cabin.</p>

<p>The Englishman sprang quickly after him just in time to see
the hind quarters of some huge animal about to disappear through
the window of the cabin.</p>

<p>As Jane Porter opened her eyes to a realization of the again
imminent peril which threatened her, her brave young heart gave
up at last its final vestige of hope, and she turned to grope for
the fallen weapon that she might mete to herself a merciful death
ere the cruel fangs tore into her fair flesh.</p>

<p>The lioness was almost through the opening before Jane found
the weapon, and she raised it quickly to her temple to shut out
forever the hideous jaws gaping for their prey.</p>

<p>An instant she hesitated, to breathe a short and silent prayer
to her Maker, and as she did so her eyes fell upon her poor
Esmeralda lying inert, but alive, beside the cupboard.</p>

<p>How could she leave the poor, faithful thing to those
merciless, yellow fangs? No, she must use one cartridge on the
senseless woman ere she turned the cold muzzle toward herself
again.</p>

<p>How she shrank from the ordeal! But it had been cruelty a
thousand times less justifiable to have left the loving black
woman who had reared her from infancy with all a mother's care
and solicitude, to regain consciousness beneath the rending claws
of the great cat.</p>

<p>Quickly Jane Porter sprang to her feet and ran to the side of
the black. She pressed the muzzle of the revolver tight against
that devoted heart, closed her eyes, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Sabor emitted a frightful shriek.</p>

<p>The girl, startled, pulled the trigger and turned to face the
beast, and with the same movement raised the weapon against her
own temple.</p>

<p>She did not fire a second time, for to her surprise she saw
the huge animal being slowly drawn back through the window, and
in the moonlight beyond she saw the heads and shoulders of two
men.</p>

<p>As Clayton rounded the corner of the cabin to behold the
animal disappearing within, it was also to see the ape-man seize
the long tail in both hands, and, bracing himself with his feet
against the side of the cabin, throw all his mighty strength into
the effort to draw the beast out of the interior.</p>

<p>Clayton was quick to lend a hand, but the ape-man jabbered to
him in a commanding and peremptory tone something which Clayton
knew to be orders, though he could not understand them.</p>

<p>At last, under their combined efforts, the great body
commenced to appear farther and farther without the window, and
then there came to Clayton's mind a dawning conception of the
rash bravery of his companion's act.</p>

<p>For a naked man to drag a shrieking, clawing man-eater forth
from a window by the tail to save a strange white girl, was
indeed the last word in heroism.</p>

<p>In so far as Clayton was concerned it was a very different
matter, since the girl was not only of his own kind and race, but
was the one woman in all the world whom he loved.</p>

<p>Though he knew that the lioness would make short work of both
of them, he pulled with a will to keep it from Jane Porter. And
then he recalled the battle between this man and the great,
black-maned lion which he had witnessed a short time before, and
he commenced to feel more assurance.</p>

<p>Tarzan was still issuing orders which Clayton could not
understand.</p>

<p>He was trying to tell the stupid white man to plunge his
poisoned arrows into Sabor's back and sides, and to reach the
savage heart with the long, thin hunting knife that hung at
Tarzan's hip; but the man would not understand, and Tarzan did
not dare release his hold to do the things himself, for he knew
that the puny white man never could hold mighty Sabor alone, for
an instant.</p>

<p>Slowly the lioness was emerging from the window. At last her
shoulders were out.</p>

<p>And then Clayton saw a thing done which not even the eternal
heavens had ever seen before. Tarzan, racking his brains for some
means to cope single-handed with the infuriated beast, had
suddenly recalled his battle with Terkoz; and as the great
shoulders came clear of the window, so that the lioness hung upon
the sill only by her forepaws, Tarzan suddenly released his hold
upon the brute.</p>

<p>With the quickness of a striking rattler he launched himself
full upon Sabor's back, his strong young arms seeking and gaining
a full-Nelson upon the beast, as he had learned it that other day
during his bloody, wrestling victory over Terkoz.</p>

<p>With a shriek the lioness turned completely over upon her
back, falling full upon her enemy; but the black-haired giant
only closed tighter his hold.</p>

<p>Pawing and tearing at earth and air, Sabor rolled and threw
herself this way and that in an effort to dislodge this strange
antagonist; but ever tighter and tighter drew the iron bands that
were forcing her head lower and lower upon her tawny breast.</p>

<p>Higher crept the steel forearms of the ape-man about the back
of Sabor's neck. Weaker and weaker became the lioness's
efforts.</p>

<p>At last Clayton saw the immense muscles of Tarzan's shoulders
and biceps leap into corded knots beneath the silver moonlight.
There was a long sustained and supreme effort on the ape-man's
part&mdash;and the vertebrae of Sabor's neck parted with a sharp
snap.</p>

<p>In an instant Tarzan was upon his feet, and for the second
time that day Clayton heard the bull ape's savage roar of
victory. Then he heard Jane Porter's agonized cry:</p>

<p>"Cecil&mdash;Mr. Clayton! Oh, what is it? What is it?"</p>

<p>Running quickly to the cabin door, Clayton called out that all
was right, and bade her open. As quickly as she could she raised
the great bar and fairly dragged Clayton within.</p>

<p>"What was that awful noise?" she whispered, shrinking close to
him.</p>

<p>"It was the cry of the kill from the throat of the man who has
just saved your life, Miss Porter. Wait, I will fetch him that
you may thank him."</p>

<p>The frightened girl would not be left alone, so she
accompanied Clayton to the side of the cabin where lay the dead
body of the lioness.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes was gone.</p>

<p>Clayton called several times, but there was no reply, and so
the two returned to the greater safety of the interior.</p>

<p>"What a frightful sound!" cried Jane Porter, "I shudder at the
mere thought of it. Do not tell me that human throat voiced that
hideous and fearsome shriek."</p>

<p>"But it did, Miss Porter," replied Clayton; "or at least if
not a human throat that of a forest god."</p>

<p>And then he told her of his experiences with this strange
creature&mdash;of how twice the wild man had saved his
life&mdash;of the wondrous strength, and agility, and
bravery&mdash;of the brown skin and the handsome face.</p>

<p>"I cannot make it out at all," he concluded. "At first I
thought he might be Tarzan of the Apes; but he neither speaks nor
understands English, so that theory is untenable."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever he may be," cried the girl, "we owe him our
lives, and may God bless him and keep him in safety in his wild
and savage jungle!"</p>

<p>"Amen," said Clayton, fervently.</p>

<p>"Fo' de good Lawd's sake, ain' Ah daid?"</p>

<p>The two turned to see Esmeralda sitting upright upon the
floor, her great eyes rolling from side to side as though she
could not believe their testimony as to her whereabouts.</p>

<p>The lioness's shriek, as Jane Porter had been about to put a
bullet into poor Esmeralda, had saved the black's life, for the
little start the girl gave had turned the muzzle of the revolver
to one side, and the bullet had passed harmlessly into the
floor.</p>

<p>And now, for Jane Porter, the reaction came, and she threw
herself upon the bench, screaming with hysterical
laughter.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; "MOST
REMARKABLE"</h2>

<p class="first"> SEVERAL miles south of the cabin, upon a strip
of sandy beach, stood two old men, arguing.</p>

<p>Before them stretched the broad Atlantic; at their backs the
Dark Continent; close around them loomed the impenetrable
blackness of the jungle.</p>

<p>Savage beasts roared and growled; noises, hideous and weird,
assailed their ears. They had wandered for miles in search of
their camp; but always in the wrong direction. They were as
hopelessly lost as though they suddenly had been transported to
another world.</p>

<p>At such a time indeed must every fiber of their combined
intellects have been concentrated upon the vital question of the
minute&mdash;the life-and-death question to them of retracing
their steps to camp.</p>

<p>Samuel T. Philander was speaking.</p>

<p>"But, my dear professor," he was saying, "I still maintain
that but for the victories of Ferdinand and Isabella over the
fifteenth-century Moors in Spain the world would be today a
thousand years in advance of where we now find ourselves.</p>

<p>"The Moors were essentially a tolerant, broadminded, liberal
race of agriculturists, artisans and merchants&mdash;the very
type of people that has made possible such civilization as we
find today in America and Europe&mdash;while the
Spaniards&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, dear Mr. Philander," interrupted Professor Porter;
"their religion positively precluded the possibilities you
suggest. Moslemism was, is, and always will be, a blight on that
scientific progress which has marked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless me! Professor," interjected Mr. Philander, who had
turned his gaze toward the jungle, "there seems to be some one
approaching."</p>

<p>Professor Archimedes Q. Porter turned in the direction
indicated by the nearsighted Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," he chided. "How often must I urge
you to seek that absolute concentration of your mental faculties
which alone may permit you to bring to bear the highest powers of
intellectuality upon the momentous problems which naturally fall
to the lot of great minds? And now I find you guilty of a most
flagrant breach of courtesy in interrupting my learned discourse
to call attention to a mere quadruped of the genus <i>Felis.</i>
As I was saying, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens, Professor, a lion?" cried Mr. Philander, straining
his weak eyes toward the dim figure outlined against the dark
tropical underbrush.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mr. Philander, if you insist upon employing slang
in your discourse, a 'lion.' But as I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless me, Professor," again interrupted Mr. Philander;
"permit me to suggest that doubtless the Moors who were conquered
in the fifteenth century will continue in that most regrettable
condition for the time being at least, even though we postpone
discussion of that world calamity until we may attain the
enchanting view of yon <i>Felis carnivora</i> which distance
proverbially is credited with lending."</p>

<p>In the meantime the lion had approached with quiet dignity to
within ten paces of the two men, where he stood curiously
watching them.</p>

<p>The moonlight flooded the beach, and the strange group stood
out in bold relief against the yellow sand.</p>

<p>"Most reprehensible, most reprehensible," exclaimed Professor
Porter, with a faint trace of irritation in his voice.</p>

<p>"Never, Mr. Philander, never before in my life have I known
one of these animals to be permitted to roam at large from its
cage. I shall most certainly report this outrageous breach of
ethics to the directors of the adjacent zoological garden."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Professor," agreed Mr. Philander, "and the
sooner it is done the better. Let us start now."</p>

<p>Seizing the professor by the arm, Mr. Philander set off in the
direction that would put the greatest distance between themselves
and the lion.</p>

<p>They had proceeded but a short distance when a backward glance
revealed to the horrified gaze of Mr. Philander that the lion was
following them. He tightened his grip upon the protesting
professor and increased his speed.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, Mr. Philander," repeated Professor
Porter.</p>

<p>Mr. Philander took another hasty glance rearward. The lion
also had quickened his gait, and was doggedly maintaining an
unvarying distance behind them.</p>

<p>"He is following us!" gasped Mr. Philander, breaking into a
run.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," remonstrated the professor, "this
unseemly haste is most unbecoming of men of letters.</p>

<p>"What will our friends think of us, who may chance to be upon
the street and witness our frivolous antics? Pray let us proceed
with more decorum."</p>

<p>Mr. Philander stole another observation astern.</p>

<p>Horrors! The lion was bounding along in easy leaps scarce five
paces behind.</p>

<p>Mr. Philander dropped the professor's arm, and broke into a
mad orgy of speed that would have done credit to any varsity
track team.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, Mr. Philander&mdash;" screamed Professor
Porter, as, metaphorically speaking, he himself "threw her into
high." He, too, had caught a fleeting backward glimpse of cruel
yellow eyes and half open mouth within startling proximity of his
person.</p>

<p>With streaming coat-tails and shiny silk hat Professor
Archimedes Q. Porter fled through the moonlight close upon the
heels of Mr. Samuel T. Philander.</p>

<p>Before them a point of the jungle ran out toward a narrow
promontory, and it was for the haven of the trees he saw there
that Mr. Samuel T. Philander directed his prodigious leaps and
bounds; while from the shadows of this same spot peered two keen
eyes in interested appreciation of the race.</p>

<p>It was Tarzan of the Apes who watched, with face a-grin, this
odd game of follow-the-leader.</p>

<p>He knew the two men were safe enough from attack in so far as
the lion was concerned. The very fact that Numa had foregone such
easy prey at all convinced the wise forest craft of Tarzan that
Numa's belly already was full.</p>

<p>The lion might stalk them until hungry again; but the chances
were that if not angered he would soon tire of the sport, and
slink away to his jungle lair.</p>

<p>Really, the one great danger was that one of the men might
stumble and fall, and then the yellow devil would be upon him in
a moment and the joy of the kill would be too great a temptation
to withstand.</p>

<p>So Tarzan swung quickly to a lower limb in line with the
approaching fugitives; and as Mr. Samuel T. Philander came
panting and blowing beneath him, already too spent to struggle up
to the safety of the limb, Tarzan reached down and, grasping him
by the collar of his coat, yanked him to the limb by his
side.</p>

<p>Another moment brought the professor within the sphere of the
friendly grip, and he, too, was drawn upward to safety just as
the baffled Numa, with a roar, leaped to recover his vanishing
quarry.</p>

<p>For a moment the two men clung panting to the great branch,
while Tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of the tree,
watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement.</p>

<p>It was the professor who first broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I am deeply pained, Mr. Philander, that you should have
evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of one of
the lower orders, and by your crass timidity have caused me to
exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in order that I might
resume my discourse.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, Mr. Philander, when you interrupted me, the
Moors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Professor Archimedes Q. Porter," broke in Mr. Philander, in
icy tones, "the time has arrived when patience becomes a crime
and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue. You have
accused me of cowardice. You have insinuated that you ran only to
overtake me, not to escape the clutches of the lion.</p>

<p>"Have a care, Professor Archimedes Q. Porter! I am a desperate
man. Goaded by long-suffering patience the worm will turn."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" cautioned Professor
Porter; "you forget yourself."</p>

<p>"I forget nothing as yet, Professor Archimedes Q. Porter; but,
believe me, sir, I am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness as
to your exalted position in the world of science, and your gray
hairs."</p>

<p>The professor sat in silence for a few minutes, and the
darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled
countenance. Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>"Look here, Skinny Philander," he said, in belligerent tones,
"if you are lookin' for a scrap, peel off your coat and come on
down on the ground, and I'll punch your head just as I did sixty
years ago in the alley back of Porky Evans' barn."</p>

<p>"Ark!" gasped the astonished Mr. Philander. "Lordy, how good
that sounds! When you're human, Ark, I love you; but somehow it
seems as though you had forgotten how to be human for the last
twenty years."</p>

<p>The professor reached out a thin, trembling old hand through
the darkness until it found his old friend's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Skinny," he said, softly. "It hasn't been quite
twenty years, and God alone knows how hard I have tried to be
'human' for Jane's sake, and yours, too, since He took my other
Jane away."</p>

<p>Another old hand stole up from Mr. Philander's side to clasp
the one that lay upon his shoulder, and no other message could
better have translated the one heart to the other.</p>

<p>They did not speak for some minutes. The lion below them paced
nervously back and forth. The third figure in the tree was hidden
by the dense shadows near the stem. He, too, was silent&mdash;motionless as a graven image.</p>

<p>"You certainly pulled me up into this tree just in time," said
the professor at last. "I want to thank you. You saved my
life."</p>

<p>"But I didn't pull you up here, Professor," said Mr.
Philander. "Bless me! The excitement of the moment quite caused
me to forget that I myself was drawn up here by some outside
agency&mdash;there must be some one or something in this tree
with us."</p>

<p>"Eh?" ejaculated Professor Porter. "Are you quite positive,
Mr. Philander?"</p>

<p>"Most positive, Professor," replied Mr. Philander, "and," he
added, "I think we should thank the party. He may be sitting
right next to you now, Professor."</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" said
Professor Porter, edging cautiously nearer to Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>Just then it occurred to Tarzan of the Apes that Numa had
loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time, so he
raised his young head toward the heavens, and there rang out upon
the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge
of the anthropoid.</p>

<p>The two friends, huddled trembling in their precarious
position on the limb, saw the great lion halt in his restless
pacing as the blood-curdling cry smote his ears, and then slink
quickly into the jungle, to be instantly lost to view.</p>

<p>"Even the lion trembles in fear," whispered Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable, most remarkable," murmured Professor Porter,
clutching frantically at Mr. Philander to regain the balance
which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered.
Unfortunately for them both, Mr. Philander's center of
equilibrium was at that very moment hanging upon the ragged edge
of nothing, so that it needed but the gentle impetus supplied by
the additional weight of Professor Porter's body to topple the
devoted secretary from the limb.</p>

<p>For a moment they swayed uncertainly, and then, with mingled
and most unscholarly shrieks, they pitched headlong from the
tree, locked in frenzied embrace.</p>

<p>It was quite some moments ere either moved, for both were
positive that any such attempt would reveal so many breaks and
fractures as to make further progress impossible.</p>

<p>At length Professor Porter essayed an attempt to move one leg.
To his surprise, it responded to his will as in days gone by. He
now drew up its mate and stretched it forth again.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable, most remarkable," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Thank God, Professor," whispered Mr. Philander, fervently,
"you are not dead, then?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut," cautioned Professor
Porter, "I do not know with accuracy as yet."</p>

<p>With infinite solicitude Professor Porter wiggled his right
arm&mdash;joy! It was intact. Breathlessly he waved his left arm
above his prostrate body&mdash;it waved!</p>

<p>"Most remarkable, most remarkable," he said.</p>

<p>"To whom are you signaling, Professor?" asked Mr. Philander,
in an excited tone.</p>

<p>Professor Porter deigned to make no response to this puerile
inquiry. Instead he raised his head gently from the ground,
nodding it back and forth a half-dozen times.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable," he breathed. "It remains intact."</p>

<p>Mr. Philander had not moved from where he had fallen; he had
not dared the attempt. How indeed could one move when one's arms
and legs and back were broken?</p>

<p>One eye was buried in the soft loam; the other, rolling
sidewise, was fixed in awe upon the strange gyrations of
Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"How sad!" exclaimed Mr. Philander, half aloud. "Concussion of
the brain, superinducing total mental aberration. How very sad
indeed! and for one still so young!"</p>

<p>Professor Porter rolled over upon his stomach; gingerly he
bowed his back until he resembled a huge tom cat in proximity to
a yelping dog. Then he sat up and felt of various portions of his
anatomy.</p>

<p>"They are all here," he ejaculated. "Most remarkable!"</p>

<p>Whereupon he arose, and, bending a scathing glance upon the
still prostrate form of Mr. Samuel T. Philander, he said:</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander; this is no time to indulge in
slothful ease. We must be up and doing."</p>

<p>Mr. Philander lifted his other eye out of the mud, and gazed
in speechless rage at Professor Porter. Then he attempted to
rise; nor could there have been any more surprised than he when
his efforts were immediately crowned with marked success.</p>

<p>He was still bursting with rage, however, at the cruel
injustice of Professor Porter's insinuation, and was on the point
of rendering a tart rejoinder when his eyes fell upon a strange
figure standing a few paces away, scrutinizing them intently.</p>

<p>Professor Porter had recovered his shiny silk hat, which he
had brushed carefully upon the sleeve of his coat and replaced
upon his head. When he saw Mr. Philander pointing to something
behind him he turned to behold a giant, naked but for a loin
cloth and a few metal ornaments, standing motionless before
him.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir!" said the professor, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>For reply the giant motioned them to follow him, and set off
up the beach in the direction from which they had recently
come.</p>

<p>"I think that we should follow him," said Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," returned the professor. "A short
time since you were advancing a most logical argument in
substantiation of your theory that the camp lay directly south of us.
I was skeptical, but you finally convinced me; so now I am
positive that toward the south we must travel to reach our
friends. Therefore I shall continue south."</p>

<p>"But, Professor Porter, this man may know better than either
of us. He seems to be indigenous to this part of the world. Let
us at least follow him for a short distance."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," repeated the professor. "I am a
difficult man to convince, but when once convinced my decision is
unalterable. I shall continue in the proper direction, if I have
to circumambulate the continent of Africa to reach my
destination."</p>

<p>Further argument was interrupted by Tarzan, who, seeing that
these strange men were not following him, had returned to their
side.</p>

<p>Again he beckoned to them; but still they stood in
argument.</p>

<p>Presently the ape-man lost patience with their stupid
ignorance. He grasped the frightened Mr. Philander by the
shoulder, and before that worthy gentleman knew whether he was
being killed or merely maimed for life, Tarzan had tied one end
of his rope securely about Mr. Philander's neck.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," remonstrated Professor Porter; "it
is most unbeseeming in you to submit to such indignities."</p>

<p>But scarcely were the words out of his mouth ere he, too, had
been seized and securely bound by the neck with the same rope.
Then Tarzan set off toward the north, leading the now thoroughly
frightened professor and his secretary.</p>

<p>In deathly silence they proceeded for what seemed hours to the
two tired and hopeless old men; but presently as they topped a
little rise of ground they were overjoyed to see the cabin lying
before them, not a hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>Here Tarzan released them, and, pointing toward the little
building, vanished into the jungle beside them.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable, most remarkable!" gasped the professor. "But
you see, Mr. Philander, that I was quite right, as usual; and but
for your stubborn willfulness we should have escaped a series of
most humiliating, not to say dangerous accidents. Pray allow
yourself to be guided by a more mature and practical mind
hereafter when in need of wise counsel."</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel T. Philander was too much relieved at the happy
outcome of their adventure to take umbrage at the professor's
cruel fling. Instead he grasped his friend's arm and hastened him
forward in the direction of the cabin.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It was a much-relieved party of castaways that found itself
once more united. Dawn discovered them still recounting their
various adventures, and speculating upon the identity of the
strange guardian and protector they had found on this savage
shore.</p>

<p>Esmeralda was positive that it was none other than an angel of
the Lord, sent down especially to watch over them.</p>

<p>"Had you seen him devour the raw meat of the lion, Esmeralda,"
laughed Clayton, "you would have thought him a very material
angel."</p>

<p>"Ah doan know nuffin' 'bout dat, Marse Clayton," rejoined
Esmeralda; "but Ah 'specs de Lawd clean fergot to gib him any
matches, He sent him down in sech a hurry to look after we-all.
An' he suttinly cain't cook nuffin' 'thout matches&mdash;no,
sah."</p>

<p>"There was nothing heavenly about his voice," said Jane
Porter, with a little shudder at recollection of the awful roar
which had followed the killing of the lioness.</p>

<p>"Nor did it precisely comport with my preconceived ideas of
the dignity of divine messengers," remarked Professor Porter,
"when the&mdash;ah&mdash;gentleman tied two highly respectable
and erudite scholars neck to neck and dragged them through the
jungle as though they had been cows."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; BURIALS</h2>

<p class="first"> As it was now quite light, the party, none of
whom had eaten or slept since the previous morning, began to
bestir themselves to prepare food.</p>

<p>The mutineers of the <i>Arrow</i> had landed a small supply of
dried meats, canned soups and vegetables, crackers, flour, tea,
and coffee for the five they had marooned, and these were
hurriedly drawn upon to satisfy the craving of long-famished
appetites.</p>

<p>The next task was to make the cabin habitable, and to this end
it was decided to at once remove the gruesome relics of the
tragedy which had taken place there on some bygone day.</p>

<p>Professor Porter and Mr. Philander were deeply interested in
examining the skeletons. The two larger, they stated, had
belonged to a male and female of one of the higher white
races.</p>

<p>The smallest skeleton was given but passing attention, as its
location, in the crib, left no doubt as to its having been the
infant offspring of this unhappy couple.</p>

<p>As they were preparing the skeleton of the man for burial,
Clayton discovered a massive ring which had evidently encircled
the man's finger at the time of his death, for one of the slender
bones of the hand still lay within the golden bauble.</p>

<p>Picking it up to examine it, Clayton gave a cry of
astonishment, for the ring bore the crest of the house of
Greystoke.</p>

<p>At the same time, Jane Porter discovered the books in the
cupboard, and on opening to the flyleaf of one of them saw the
name, <i>John Clayton, London.</i> In a second book which she
hurriedly examined was the single name, <i>Greystoke.</i></p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Clayton," she cried, "what does this mean? Here are
the names of some of your own people in these books."</p>

<p>"And here," he replied gravely, "is the great ring of the
house of Greystoke which has been lost since my uncle, John
Clayton, the former Lord Greystoke, disappeared, presumably lost
at sea."</p>

<p>"But how do you account for these things being here, in this
savage African jungle?" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"There is but one way to account for it, Miss Porter," said
Clayton. "The late Lord Greystoke was not drowned. He died here
in this cabin and this poor thing upon the floor is all that is
mortal of him."</p>

<p>"Then this must have been Lady Greystoke," said Jane Porter
reverently, indicating the poor mass of bones upon the bed.</p>

<p>"The beautiful Lady Alice," replied Clayton, "of whose many
virtues and remarkable personal charms I often have heard my
mother and father speak. Poor, unhappy lady," he murmured
sadly.</p>

<p>With deep reverence and solemnity the bodies of the late Lord
and Lady Greystoke were buried beside their little African cabin,
and between them was placed the tiny skeleton of the baby of
Kala, the ape.</p>

<p>As Mr. Philander was placing the frail bones of the infant in
a bit of sail cloth, he examined the skull minutely. Then he
called Professor Porter to his side, and the two argued in low
tones for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable, most remarkable," said Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"Bless me," said Mr. Philander, "we must acquaint Mr. Clayton
with our discovery at once."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Philander, tut, tut!" remonstrated Professor
Archimedes Q. Porter. "Let the dead past bury its dead."</p>

<p>And so the white-haired old man repeated the burial service
over this strange grave, while his four companions stood with
bowed and uncovered heads about him.</p>

<p>From the trees Tarzan of the Apes watched the solemn ceremony;
but most of all he watched the sweet face and graceful figure of
Jane Porter.</p>

<p>In his savage, untutored breast new emotions were stirring. He
could not fathom them. He wondered why he felt so great an
interest in these people&mdash;why he had gone to such pains to
save the three men. But he did not wonder why he had torn Sabor
from the tender flesh of the strange girl.</p>

<p>Surely the men were stupid and ridiculous and cowardly. Even
Manu, the monkey, was more intelligent than they. If these were
creatures of his own kind he was doubtful if his past pride in
blood was warranted.</p>

<p>But the girl, ah&mdash;that was a different matter. He did not
reason here. He knew that she was created to be protected, and
that he was created to protect her.</p>

<p>He wondered why they had dug a great hole in the ground merely
to bury dry bones. Surely there was no sense in that; no one
wanted to steal dry bones.</p>

<p>Had there been meat upon them he could have understood, for
thus alone might one keep his meat from Dango, the hyena, and the
other robbers of the jungle.</p>

<p>When the grave had been filled with earth the little party
turned back toward the cabin, and Esmeralda, still weeping
copiously for the two she had never heard of before today, and
who had been dead twenty years, chanced to glance toward the
harbor. Instantly her tears ceased.</p>

<p>"Look at dem low down white trash out dere!" she shrilled,
pointing toward the <i>Arrow</i>. "They-all's a desecratin' us,
right yere on dis yere perverted islan'."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, the <i>Arrow</i> was being worked toward the
open sea, slowly, through the harbor's entrance.</p>

<p>"They promised to leave us firearms and ammunition," said
Clayton. "The merciless beasts!"</p>

<p>"It is the work of that fellow they call Snipes, I am sure,"
said Jane Porter. "King was a scoundrel, but he had a little
sense of humanity. If they had not killed him I know that he
would have seen that we were properly provided for before they
left us to our fate."</p>

<p>"I regret that they did not visit us before sailing," said
Professor Porter. "I had purposed requesting them to leave the
treasure with us, as I shall be a ruined man if that is
lost."</p>

<p>Jane Porter looked at her father sadly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," she said. "It wouldn't have done any good,
because it is solely for the treasure that they killed their
officers and landed us upon this awful shore."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, child, tut, tut!" replied Professor Porter. "You
are a good child, but inexperienced in practical matters," and
Professor Porter turned and walked slowly away toward the jungle,
his hands clasped beneath his long coat-tails and his eyes bent
upon the ground.</p>

<p>His daughter watched him with a pathetic smile upon her lips,
and then turning to Mr. Philander, she whispered:</p>

<p>"Please don't let him wander off again as he did yesterday. We
depend upon you, you know, to keep a close watch upon him."</p>

<p>"He becomes more difficult to handle each day," replied Mr.
Philander, with a sigh and a shake of his head. "I presume he is
now off to report to the directors of the Zoo that one of their
lions was at large last night. Oh, Miss Jane, you don't know what
I have to contend with."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Mr. Philander; but while we all love him, you
alone are best fitted to manage him; for, regardless of what he
may say to you, he respects your great learning, and, therefore,
has immense confidence in your judgment. The poor dear cannot
differentiate between erudition and wisdom."</p>

<p>Mr. Philander, with a mildly puzzled expression on his face,
turned to pursue Professor Porter, and in his mind he was
revolving the question of whether he should feel complimented or
aggrieved at Miss Porter's rather back-handed compliment.</p>

<p>Tarzan had seen the consternation depicted upon the faces of
the little group as they witnessed the departure of the
<i>Arrow</i>; so, as the ship was a wonderful novelty to him in
addition, he determined to hasten out to the point of land at the
north of the harbor's mouth and obtain a nearer view of the boat,
as well as to learn, if possible, the direction of its
flight.</p>

<p>Swinging through the trees with great speed, he reached the
point but a moment after the ship had passed out of the harbor,
so that he obtained an excellent view of the wonders of this
strange, floating house.</p>

<p>There were some twenty men running hither and thither about
the deck, pulling and hauling on ropes.</p>

<p>A light land breeze was blowing, and the ship had been worked
through the harbor's mouth under scant sail, but now that they
had cleared the point every available shred of canvas was being
spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as
possible.</p>

<p>Tarzan watched the graceful movements of the ship in rapt
admiration, and longed to be aboard her. Presently his keen eyes
caught the faintest suspicion of smoke on the far northern
horizon, and he wondered over the cause of such a thing out on
the great water.</p>

<p>At about the same time the look-out on the <i>Arrow</i> must
have discerned it, for in a few minutes Tarzan saw the sails
being shifted and shortened. The ship came about, and presently
he knew that she was beating back toward land.</p>

<p>A man at the bows was constantly heaving into the sea a rope
to the end of which a small object was fastened. Tarzan wondered
what the purpose of this action might be.</p>

<p>At last the ship came up directly into the wind; the anchor
was lowered; down came the sails. There was great scurrying about
on deck.</p>

<p>A boat was lowered, and in it a great chest was placed. Then a
dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly toward the
point where Tarzan crouched in the branches of a tree.</p>

<p>In the stern of the boat, as it drew nearer, Tarzan saw the
rat-faced man.</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes later that the boat touched the
beach. The men jumped out and lifted the great chest to the sand.
They were on the north side of the point so that their presence
was concealed from those at the cabin.</p>

<p>The men argued angrily for a moment. Then the rat-faced one,
with several companions, ascended the low bluff on which stood
the tree that concealed Tarzan. They looked about for several
minutes.</p>

<p>"Here is a good place," said the rat-faced sailor, indicating
a spot beneath Tarzan's tree.</p>

<p>"It is as good as any," replied one of his companions. "If
they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be confiscated
anyway. We might as well bury it here on the chance that some of
us will escape the gallows to come back and enjoy it later."</p>

<p>The rat-faced one now called to the men who had remained at
the boat, and they came slowly up the bank carrying picks and
shovels.</p>

<p>"Hurry, <sup>___</sup> you!" cried Snipes.</p>

<p>"Stow it!" retorted one of the men, in a surly tone. "You're
no admiral, you <sup>___</sup> shrimp."</p>

<p>"I'm Cap'n here, though, I'll have you to understand, you
swab," shrieked Snipes, with a volley of frightful oaths.</p>

<p>"Steady, boys," cautioned one of the men who had not spoken
before. "It ain't goin' to get us nothing by fightin' amongst
ourselves."</p>

<p>"Right enough," replied the sailor who had resented Snipes'
autocratic tones; "but by the same token it ain't a-goin' to get
nobody nothin' to put on airs in this bloomin' company
neither."</p>

<p>"You fellows dig here," said Snipes, indicating a spot beneath
the tree. "And while you're diggin', Peter kin be a-makin' of a
map of the location, so's we kin find it again. You, Tom, and
Bill, take a couple more down and fetch up the chest."</p>

<p>"Wot are you a-goin' to do?" asked he of the previous
altercation. "Just boss?"</p>

<p>"Git busy there," growled Snipes. "You didn't think your Cap'n
was a-goin' to dig with a shovel, did you?"</p>

<p>The men all looked up angrily. None of them liked Snipes, and
his disagreeable show of authority since he had murdered King,
the real head and ringleader of the mutineers, had only added
fuel to the flames of their hatred.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you don't intend to take a shovel,
and lend a hand with this work? You're shoulder's not hurted so
all-fired bad as that," said Tarrant, the sailor who had before
spoken.</p>

<p>"Not by a <sup>___ </sup> sight," replied Snipes, fingering
the butt of his revolver nervously.</p>

<p>"Then, by God," replied Tarrant, "if you won't take a shovel
you'll take a pickaxe."</p>

<p>With the words he raised his pick above his head, and, with a
mighty blow, buried the point in Snipes' brain.</p>

<p>For a moment the men stood silently looking at the result of
their fellow's grim humor. Then one of them spoke.</p>

<p>"Served the skunk jolly well right," he said.</p>

<p>One of the others commenced to ply his pick to the ground. The
soil was soft and he threw aside the pick and grasped a shovel;
then the others joined him. There was no further comment on the
killing, but the men worked in a better frame of mind than they
had since Snipes had assumed command.</p>

<p>When they had a trench of ample size to bury the chest,
Tarrant suggested that they enlarge it and inter Snipes' body on
top of the chest.</p>

<p>"It might 'elp fool any as 'appened to be diggin' 'ereabouts,"
he explained.</p>

<p>The others saw the cunning of the suggestion, and so the
trench was lengthened to accommodate the corpse, and in the
center a deeper hole was excavated for the box, which was first
wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place, which brought
its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave. Earth was
shovelled in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of
the grave showed level and uniform.</p>

<p>Two of the men rolled the rat-faced corpse unceremoniously
into the grave, after first stripping it of its weapons and
various other articles which the several members of the party
coveted for their own.</p>

<p>They then filled the grave with earth and tramped upon it
until it would hold no more.</p>

<p>The balance of the loose earth was thrown far and wide, and a
mass of dead undergrowth spread in as natural a manner as
possible over the new made grave to obliterate all signs of the
ground having been disturbed.</p>

<p>Their work done, the sailors returned to the small boat, and
pulled off rapidly toward the <i>Arrow</i>.</p>

<p>The breeze had increased considerably, and as the smoke upon
the horizon was now plainly discernible in considerable volume,
the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail and bearing
away toward the southwest.</p>

<p>Tarzan, an interested spectator of all that had taken place,
sat speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar
creatures.</p>

<p>Men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of
the jungle! How fortunate was he who lived in the peace and
security of the great forest!</p>

<p>Tarzan wondered what the chest they had buried contained. If
they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the
water? That would have been much easier.</p>

<p>Ah, he thought, but they do want it. They have hidden it here
because they intend returning for it later.</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced to examine the
earth about the excavation. He was looking to see if these
creatures had dropped anything which he might like to own. Soon
he discovered a spade hidden by the underbrush which they had
laid upon the grave.</p>

<p>He seized it and attempted to use it as he had seen the
sailors do. It was awkward work and hurt his bare feet, but he
persevered until he had partially uncovered the body. This he
dragged from the grave and laid to one side.</p>

<p>Then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest.
This also he dragged to the side of the corpse. Then he filled in
the smaller hole below the grave, replaced the body and the earth
around and above it; covered it over with underbrush and returned
to the chest.</p>

<p>Four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its
weight&mdash;Tarzan of the Apes picked it up as though it had
been an empty packing case, and with the spade slung to his back
by a piece of rope, carried it off into the densest part of the
jungle.</p>

<p>He could not well negotiate the trees with this awkward
burden, but he kept to the trails, and so made fairly good
time.</p>

<p>For several hours he traveled a little north of east until he
came to an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation.
Then he took to the lower branches, and in another fifteen
minutes he emerged into the amphitheater of the apes, where they
met in council, or to celebrate the rites of the Dum-Dum.</p>

<p>Near the center of the clearing, and not far from the drum, or
altar, he commenced to dig. This was harder work than turning up
the freshly excavated earth at the grave, but Tarzan of the Apes
was persevering and so he kept at his labor until he was rewarded
by seeing a hole sufficiently deep to receive the chest and
effectually hide it from view.</p>

<p>Why had he gone to all this labor without knowing the value of
the contents of the chest?</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes had a man's figure and a man's brain, but
he was an ape by training and environment. His brain told him
that the chest contained something valuable, or the men would not
have hidden it; his training had taught him to imitate whatever
was new and unusual, and now the natural curiosity, which is as
common to men as to apes, prompted him to open the chest and
examine its contents.</p>

<p>But the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his
cunning and his immense strength, so that he was compelled to
bury the chest without having his curiosity satisfied.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>By the time Tarzan had hunted his way back to the vicinity of
the cabin, feeding as he went, it was quite dark.</p>

<p>Within the little building a light was burning, for Clayton
had found an unopened tin of oil which had stood intact for
twenty years; a part of the supplies left with the Claytons by
Black Michael. The lamps also were still useable, and thus the
interior of the cabin appeared as bright as day to the astonished
Tarzan.</p>

<p>He had often wondered at the exact purpose of the lamps. His
reading and the pictures had told him what they were, but he had
no idea of how they could be made to produce the wondrous
sunlight that some of his pictures had portrayed them as
diffusing upon all surrounding objects.</p>

<p>As he approached the window nearest the door he saw that the
cabin had been divided into two rooms by a rough partition of
boughs and sailcloth.</p>

<p>In the front room were the three men; the two older deep in
argument, while the younger, tilted back against the wall on an
improvised stool, was deeply engrossed in reading one of Tarzan's
books.</p>

<p>Tarzan was not particularly interested in the men, however, so
he sought the other window. There was the girl. How beautiful her
features! How delicate her snowy skin!</p>

<p>She was writing at Tarzan's own table beneath the window. Upon
a pile of grasses at the far side of the room lay the negress,
asleep.</p>

<p>For an hour Tarzan feasted his eyes upon her while she wrote.
How he longed to speak to her, but he dared not attempt it, for
he was convinced that, as with the men, she would not
understand him, and he feared, too, that he might frighten her
away.</p>

<p>At length she arose, leaving her manuscript upon the table.
She went to the bed upon which had been spread several layers of
soft grasses. These she rearranged.</p>

<p>Then she loosened the soft mass of golden hair which crowned
her head. Like a shimmering waterfall turned to burnished metal
by a dying sun it fell about her oval face; in waving lines,
below her waist it tumbled.</p>

<p>Tarzan was spellbound. Then she extinguished the lamp and all
within the cabin was wrapped in Cimmerian darkness.</p>

<p>Still Tarzan watched without. Creeping close beneath the
window he waited, listening, for half an hour. At last he was
rewarded by the sounds of the regular breathing within which
denotes sleep.</p>

<p>Cautiously he intruded his hand between the meshes of the
lattice until his whole arm was within the cabin. Carefully he
felt upon the desk. At last he grasped the manuscript upon which
Jane Porter had been writing, and as cautiously withdrew his arm
and hand, holding the precious treasure.</p>

<p>Tarzan folded the sheets into a small parcel which he tucked
into the quiver with his arrows. Then he melted away into the
jungle as softly and as noiselessly as a shadow.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE JUNGLE
TOLL</h2>

<p class="first"> EARLY the following morning Tarzan awoke, and
the first thought of the new day, as the last of yesterday, was
of the wonderful writing which lay hidden in his quiver.</p>

<p>Hurriedly he brought it forth, hoping against hope that he
could read what the beautiful white girl had written there the
preceding evening.</p>

<p>At the first glance he suffered the bitterest disappointment
of his whole life; never before had he so yearned for anything as
now he did for the ability to interpret a message from that
golden-haired divinity who had come so suddenly and so
unexpectedly into his life.</p>

<p>What if the message were not intended for him? It was an
expression of her thoughts, and that was all sufficient for
Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>And now to be baffled by strange, uncouth characters the like
of which he had never seen before! Why, they even tipped in the
opposite direction from all that he had ever examined either in
printed books or the difficult script of the few letters he had
found.</p>

<p>Even the little bugs of the black book were familiar friends,
though their arrangement meant nothing to him; but these bugs
were new and unheard of.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes he poured over them, when suddenly they
commenced to take familiar though distorted shapes. Ah, they were
his old friends, but badly crippled.</p>

<p>Then he began to make out a word here and a word there. His
heart leaped for joy. He could read it, and he would.</p>

<p>In another half hour he was progressing rapidly, and, but for
an exceptional word now and again, he found it very plain
sailing.</p>

<p>Here is what he read:</p> <BR>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">West Coast of Africa,<BR>
About 10 Degrees South Latitude.</SPAN> (So Mr. Clayton
says.)</p>

<p class="letter" style="text-align:right">February 3(?),
1909.</p>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dearest Hazel</SPAN>:</p>

<p class="letter">It seems foolish to write you a letter that you
may never see, but I simply must tell somebody of our awful
experiences since we sailed from Europe on the ill-fated
<i>Arrow.</i></p>

<p class="letter">If we never return to civilization, as now
seems only too likely, this will at least prove a brief record of
the events which led up to our final fate, whatever it may
be.</p>

<p class="letter">As you know, we were supposed to have set out
upon a scientific expedition to the Congo. Papa was presumed to
entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient
civilization, the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the
Congo valley. But after we were well under sail the truth came
out.</p>

<p class="letter">It seems that an old bookworm who has a book
and curio shop in Baltimore discovered between the leaves of a
very old Spanish manuscript a letter written in 1550 detailing
the adventures of a crew of mutineers of a Spanish galleon bound
from Spain to South America with a vast treasure of "doubloons"
and "pieces of eight," I suppose, for they certainly sound weird
and piraty.</p>

<p class="letter">The writer had been one of the crew, and the
letter was to his son, who was, at the very time the letter was
written, master of a Spanish merchantman.</p>

<p class="letter">Many years had elapsed since the events the
letter narrated had transpired, and the old man had become a
respected citizen of an obscure Spanish town, but the love of
gold was still so strong upon him that he risked all to acquaint
his son with the means of attaining fabulous wealth for them
both.</p>

<p class="letter">The writer told how when but a week out from
Spain the crew had mutinied and murdered every officer and man
who opposed them; but they defeated their own ends by this very
act, for there was none left competent to navigate a ship at
sea.</p>

<p class="letter">They were blown hither and thither for two
months, until sick and dying of scurvy, starvation, and thirst,
they had been wrecked on a small islet.</p>

<p class="letter">The galleon was washed high upon the beach
where she went to pieces; but not before the survivors, who
numbered but ten souls, had rescued one of the great chests of
treasure.</p>

<p class="letter">This they buried well up on the island, and for
three years they lived there in constant hope of being
rescued.</p>

<p class="letter">One by one they sickened and died, until only
one man was left, the writer of the letter.</p>

<p class="letter">The men had built a boat from the wreckage of
the galleon, but having no idea where the island was located they
had not dared to put to sea.</p>

<p class="letter">When all were dead except himself, however, the
awful loneliness so weighed upon the mind of the sole survivor
that he could endure it no longer, and choosing to risk death
upon the open sea rather than madness on the lonely isle, he set
sail in his little boat after nearly a year of solitude.</p>

<p class="letter">Fortunately he sailed due north, and within a
week was in the track of the Spanish merchantmen plying between
the West Indies and Spain, and was picked up by one of these
vessels homeward bound.</p>

<p class="letter">The story he told was merely one of shipwreck
in which all but a few had perished, the balance, except himself,
dying after they reached the island. He did not mention the
mutiny or the chest of buried treasure.</p>

<p class="letter">The master of the merchantman assured him that
from the position at which they had picked him up, and the
prevailing winds for the past week he could have been on no other
island than one of the Cape Verde group, which lie off the West
Coast of Africa in about 16 or 17 north latitude.</p>

<p class="letter">His letter described the island minutely, as
well as the location of the treasure, and was accompanied by the
crudest, funniest little old map you ever saw; with trees and
rocks all marked by scrawly X's to show the exact spot where the
treasure had been buried.</p>

<p class="letter">When papa explained the real nature of the
expedition, my heart sank, for I know so well how visionary and
impractical the poor dear has always been that I feared he had
again been duped; especially when he told me that he had paid a
thousand dollars for the letter and map.</p>

<p class="letter">To add to my distress, I learned that he had
borrowed ten thousand dollars more from Robert Canler, and had
given his notes for the amount.</p>

<p class="letter">Mr. Canler had asked for no security, and you
know, dearie, what that will mean for me if papa cannot meet
them. Oh, how I detest that man!</p>

<p class="letter">We all tried to look on the bright side of
things, but Mr. Philander, and Mr. Clayton&mdash;he joined us in
London just for the adventure&mdash;both felt as skeptical as
I.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, to make a long story short, we found the
island and the treasure&mdash;a great iron-bound oak chest,
wrapped in many layers of oiled sailcloth, and as strong and firm
as when it had been buried nearly two hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="letter">It was simply filled with gold coin, and
was so heavy that four men bent beneath its weight.</p>

<p class="letter">The horrid thing seems to bring nothing but
murder and misfortune to those who have to do with it, for three
days after we sailed from the Cape Verde Islands our own crew
mutinied and killed every one of their officers.</p>

<p class="letter">Oh, it was the most terrifying experience one
could imagine&mdash;I cannot even write of it.</p>

<p class="letter">They were going to kill us too, but one of
them, the leader, a man named King, would not let them, and so
they sailed south along the coast to a lonely spot where they
found a good harbor, and here they landed and have left us.</p>

<p class="letter">They sailed away with the treasure today, but
Mr. Clayton says they will meet with a fate similar to the
mutineers of the ancient galleon, because King, the only man
aboard who knew aught of navigation, was murdered on the beach by
one of the men the day we landed.</p>

<p class="letter">I wish you could know Mr. Clayton; he is the
dearest fellow imaginable, and unless I am mistaken he has fallen
very much in love with poor little me.</p>

<p class="letter">He is the only son of Lord Greystoke, and some
day will inherit the title and estates. In addition, he is
wealthy in his own right, but the fact that he is going to be an
English Lord makes me very sad&mdash;you know what my sentiments
have always been relative to American girls who married titled
foreigners. Oh, if he were only a plain American gentleman!</p>

<p class="letter">But it isn't his fault, poor fellow, and in
everything except birth he would do credit to my darling old
country, and that is the greatest compliment I know how to pay
any man.</p>

<p class="letter">We have had the most weird experiences since we
were landed here. Papa and Mr. Philander lost in the jungle, and
chased by a real lion.</p>

<p class="letter">Mr. Clayton lost, and attacked twice by wild
beasts. Esmeralda and I cornered in an old cabin by a perfectly
awful man-eating lioness. Oh, it was simply "terrifical," as
Esmeralda would say.</p>

<p class="letter">But the strangest part of it all is the
wonderful creature who rescued us. I have not seen him, but Mr.
Clayton and papa and Mr. Philander have, and they say that he is
a perfectly god-like white man tanned to a dusky brown; with the
strength of a wild elephant, the agility of a monkey, and the
bravery of a lion.</p>

<p class="letter">He speaks no English and vanishes as quickly
and as mysteriously after he has performed some valorous deed, as
though he were a disembodied spirit.</p>

<p class="letter">Then we have another weird neighbor, who
printed a beautiful sign in English and tacked it on the door of
his cabin, which we have preempted, warning us to destroy none of
his belongings, and signing himself "Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p class="letter">We have never seen him, though we think he is
about, for one of the sailors, who was going to shoot Mr. Clayton
in the back, received a spear in his shoulder from some unseen
hand in the jungle.</p>

<p class="letter">The sailors left us but a meager supply of
food, so, as we have only a single revolver with but three
cartridges left in it, we do not know how we can procure meat,
though Mr. Philander says that we can exist indefinitely on the
wild fruit and nuts which abound in the jungle.</p>

<p class="letter">I am very tired now, so I shall go to my funny
bed of grasses which Mr. Clayton gathered for me, but will add to
this from day to day as things happen.</p>

<p class="letter">Lovingly,</p>

<p class="letter">Jane Porter.</p>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">To Hazel Strong, Baltimore,
MD</SPAN>.</p>


<p><BR> Tarzan sat in a brown study for a long time after he
finished reading the letter. It was filled with so many new and
wonderful things that his brain was in a whirl as he attempted to
digest them all.</p>

<p>So they did not know that he was Tarzan of the Apes. He would
tell them.</p>

<p>In his tree he had constructed a rude shelter of leaves and
boughs, beneath which, protected from the rain, he had placed the
few treasures brought from the cabin. Among these were some
pencils.</p>

<p>He took one, and beneath Jane Porter's signature he wrote:</p>
<BR>

<p class="sign">I AM TARZAN OF THE APES</p><BR>

<p>He thought that would be sufficient. Later he would return the
letter to the cabin.</p>

<p>In the matter of food, thought Tarzan, they had no need to
worry&mdash;he would provide, and he did.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The next morning Jane Porter found her missing letter in the
exact spot from which it had disappeared two nights before. She
was mystified; but when she saw the printed words beneath her
signature, she felt a cold, clammy chill run up her spine. She
showed the letter, or rather the last sheet with the signature,
to Clayton.</p>

<p>"And to think," she said, "that uncanny thing was probably
watching me all the time that I was writing&mdash;oo! It makes me
shudder just to think of it."</p>

<p>"But he must be friendly," reassured Clayton, "for he has
returned your letter, nor did he offer to harm you, and unless I
am mistaken he left a very substantial memento of his friendship
outside the cabin door last night, for I just found the carcass
of a wild boar there as I came out."</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>From then on scarcely a day passed that did not bring its
offering of game or other food. Sometimes it was a young deer,
again a quantity of strange, cooked food&mdash;cassava cakes
pilfered from the village of Mbonga&mdash;or a boar, or leopard,
and once a lion.</p>

<p>Tarzan derived the greatest pleasure of his life in hunting
meat for these strangers. It seemed to him that no pleasure on
earth could compare with laboring for the welfare and protection
of the beautiful white girl.</p>

<p>Some day he would venture into the camp in daylight and talk
with these people through the medium of the little bugs which
were familiar to them and to Tarzan.</p>

<p>But he found it difficult to overcome the timidity of the wild
thing of the forest, and so day followed day without seeing a
fulfillment of his good intentions.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The party in the camp, emboldened by familiarity, wandered
further and yet further into the jungle in search of nuts and
fruit.</p>

<p>Scarcely a day passed that did not find Professor Porter
straying in his preoccupied indifference toward the jaws of
death. Mr. Samuel T. Philander, never what one might call robust,
was worn to the shadow of a shadow through the ceaseless worry
and mental distraction resultant from his Herculean efforts to
safeguard the professor.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A month passed. Tarzan had finally determined to visit the
camp by daylight.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon. Clayton had wandered to the point at
the harbor's mouth to look for passing vessels. Here he kept a
great mass of wood, high piled, ready to be ignited as a signal
should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon.</p>

<p>Professor Porter was wandering along the beach south of the
camp with Mr. Philander at his elbow, urging him to turn his
steps back before the two became again the sport of some savage
beast.</p>

<p>The others gone, Jane Porter and Esmeralda had wandered into
the jungle to gather fruit, and in their search were led further
and further from the cabin.</p>

<p>Tarzan waited in silence before the door of the little house
until they should return. His thoughts were of the beautiful
white girl. They were always of her now. He wondered if she would
fear him, and the thought all but caused him to relinquish his
plan.</p>

<p>He was rapidly becoming impatient for her return, that he
might feast his eyes upon her and be near her, perhaps touch her.
The ape-man knew no god, but he was as near to worshipping his
divinity as mortal man ever comes to worship.</p>

<p>While he waited he passed the time printing a message to her;
whether he intended giving it to her he himself could not have
told, but he took infinite pleasure in seeing his thoughts
expressed in print&mdash;in which he was not so uncivilized after
all. He wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="quote"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I AM TARZAN OF THE APES. I
WANT YOU. I AM YOURS. YOU ARE MINE. WE WILL LIVE HERE TOGETHER
ALWAYS IN MY HOUSE. I WILL BRING YOU THE BEST FRUITS, THE
TENDEREST DEER, THE FINEST MEATS THAT ROAM THE JUNGLE. I WILL
HUNT FOR YOU. I AM THE GREATEST OF THE JUNGLE HUNTERS. I WILL
FIGHT FOR YOU. I AM THE MIGHTIEST OF THE JUNGLE FIGHTERS. YOU ARE
JANE PORTER, I SAW IT IN YOUR LETTER. WHEN YOU SEE THIS YOU WILL
KNOW THAT IT IS FOR YOU AND THAT TARZAN OF THE APES LOVES
YOU.</SPAN></p>

<p><BR> As he stood, straight as a young Indian, by the door,
waiting after he had finished the message, there came to his keen
ears a familiar sound. It was the passing of a great ape through
the lower branches of the forest.</p>

<p>For an instant he listened intently, and then from the jungle
came the agonized scream of a woman, and Tarzan of the Apes,
dropping his first love letter upon the ground, shot like a
panther into the forest.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Clayton, also, heard the scream, and Professor Porter and Mr.
Philander, and in a few minutes they came panting to the cabin,
calling out to each other a volley of excited questions as they
approached. A glance within confirmed their worst fears.</p>

<p>Jane Porter and Esmeralda were not there.</p>

<p>Instantly, Clayton, followed by the two old men, plunged into
the jungle, calling the girl's name aloud. For half an hour they
stumbled on, until Clayton, by merest chance, came upon the
prostrate form of Esmeralda.</p>

<p>He stooped beside her, feeling for her pulse and then
listening for her heart beats. She lived. He shook her.</p>

<p>"Esmeralda!" he shrieked in her ear. "Esmeralda! For God's
sake, where is Miss Porter? What has happened? Esmeralda!"</p>

<p>Slowly the black opened her eyes. She saw Clayton. She saw the
jungle about her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gaberelle!" she screamed, and fainted again.</p>

<p>By this time Professor Porter and Mr. Philander had come
up.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Mr. Clayton?" asked the old professor.
"Where shall we look? God could not have been so cruel as to take
my little girl away from me now."</p>

<p>"We must arouse Esmeralda first," replied Clayton. "She can
tell us what has happened. Esmeralda!" he cried again, shaking
the black woman roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"O Gaberelle, Ah wants to die!" cried the poor woman, but with
eyes fast closed. "Lemme die, deah Lawd, but doan lemme see dat
awrful face again. Whaf er yo' sen de devil 'roun' after po ole
Esmeralda? She ain't done nuffin' to nobody, Lawd; hones' she
ain't. She's puffickly indecent, Lawd; yas'm, deed she is."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Esmeralda," cried Clayton.</p>

<p>"The Lord isn't here; it's Mr. Clayton. Open your eyes."</p>

<p>Esmeralda did as she was bade.</p>

<p>"O Gaberelle! T'ank de Lawd," she said.</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Porter? What happened?" questioned Clayton.</p>

<p>"Ain' Miss Jane here?" cried Esmeralda, sitting up with
wonderful celerity for one of her bulk. "Oh, Lawd, now Ah
'members! It done must have tooked her away," and the negress
commenced to sob, and wail her lamentations.</p>

<p>"What took her away?" cried Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"A great big gi'nt all covered with hair."</p>

<p>"A gorilla, Esmeralda?" questioned Mr. Philander, and the
three men scarcely breathed as he voiced the horrible
thought.</p>

<p>"Ah done thought it was de devil; but Ah guess it mus' a-been
one of dem gorilephants. Oh, my po baby, my po li'l honey," and
again Esmeralda broke into uncontrollable sobbing.</p>

<p>Clayton immediately began to look about for tracks, but he
could find nothing save a confusion of trampled grasses in the
close vicinity, and his woodcraft was too meager for the
translation of what he did see.</p>

<p>All the balance of the day they sought through the jungle; but
as night drew on they were forced to give up in despair and
hopelessness, for they did not even know in what direction the
thing had borne Jane Porter.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It was long after dark ere they reached the cabin, and a sad
and grief-stricken party it was that sat silently within the
little structure.</p>

<p>Professor Porter finally broke the silence. His tones were no
longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract
and the unknowable; but those of the man of
action&mdash;determined, but tinged also by a note of
indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering
pang from Clayton's heart.</p>

<p>"I shall lie down now," said the old man, "and try to sleep.
Early tomorrow, so soon as it is light, I shall take what food I
can carry and continue the search until I have found Jane. I will
not return without her."</p>

<p>His companions did not reply at once. Each was immersed in their
own sorrowful thoughts, and each knew, as did the old professor,
what the last words meant&mdash;Professor Porter would never
return from the jungle.</p>

<p>At length Clayton arose and laid his hand gently upon
Professor Porter's bent old shoulder.</p>

<p>"I shall go with you, of course," he said. "Do not tell me
that I need even have said so."</p>

<p>"I knew that you would offer&mdash;that you would wish to go,
Mr. Clayton; but you must not. Jane is beyond human assistance
now. I simply go that I may face my Maker with her, and know,
too, that what was once my dear little girl lies not alone and
friendless in the awful jungle.</p>

<p>"The same vines and leaves will cover us, the same rains beat
upon us; and when the spirit of her mother is abroad, it will
find us together in death, as it has always found us in life.</p>

<p>"No; it is I alone who may go, for she was my daughter&mdash;all that was left on earth for me to love."</p>

<p>"I shall go with you," said Clayton simply.</p>

<p>The old man looked up, regarding the strong, handsome face of
William Cecil Clayton intently. Perhaps he read there the love
that lay in the heart beneath&mdash;the love for his
daughter.</p>

<p>He had been too preoccupied with his own scholarly thoughts in
the past to consider the little occurrences, the chance words,
which would have indicated to a more practical man that these
young people were being drawn more and more closely to one
another. Now they came back to him, one by one.</p>

<p>"As you wish," he said.</p>

<p>"You may count on me, also," said Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>"No, my dear old friend," said Professor Porter. "We may not
all go. It would be cruelly wicked to leave poor Esmeralda here
alone, and three of us would be no more successful than one.</p>

<p>"There be enough dead things in the cruel forest as it is.
Come&mdash;let us try to sleep a little."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE CALL OF THE
PRIMITIVE</h2>

<p class="first"> FROM the time Tarzan left the tribe of great
anthropoids in which he had been raised, it was torn by continual
strife and discord. Terkoz proved a cruel and capricious king, so
that, one by one, many of the older and weaker apes, upon whom he
was particularly prone to vent his brutish nature, took their
families and sought the quiet and safety of the far interior.</p>

<p>But at last those who remained were driven to desperation by
the continued truculence of Terkoz, and it so happened that one
of them recalled the parting admonition of Tarzan:</p>

<p>"If you have a chief who is cruel, do not do as the other apes
do, and attempt, any one of you, to pit yourself against him
alone. But, instead, let two or three or four of you attack him
together. Then, if you will do this, no chief will dare to be
other than he should be, for four of you can kill any chief who
may ever be over you."</p>

<p>And the ape who recalled this wise counsel repeated it to
several of his fellows, so that when Terkoz returned to the tribe
that day he found a warm reception awaiting him.</p>

<p>There were no formalities. As Terkoz reached the group, five
huge, hairy beasts sprang upon him.</p>

<p>At heart he was an arrant coward, which is the way with
bullies among apes as well as among men; so he did not remain to
fight and die, but tore himself away from them as quickly as he
could and fled into the sheltering boughs of the forest.</p>

<p>Two more attempts he made to rejoin the tribe, but on each
occasion he was set upon and driven away. At last he gave it up,
and turned, foaming with rage and hatred, into the jungle.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>For several days he wandered aimlessly, nursing his spite and
looking for some weak thing on which to vent his pent anger.</p>

<p>It was in this state of mind that the horrible, man-like
beast, swinging from tree to tree, came suddenly upon two women
in the jungle.</p>

<p>He was right above them when he discovered them. The first
intimation Jane Porter had of his presence was when the great
hairy body dropped to the earth beside her, and she saw the awful
face and the snarling, hideous mouth thrust within a foot of
her.</p>

<p>One piercing scream escaped her lips as the brute hand
clutched her arm. Then she was dragged toward those awful fangs
which yawned at her throat. But ere they touched that fair skin
another mood claimed the anthropoid.</p>

<p>The tribe had kept his women. He must find others to replace
them. This hairless white ape would be the first of his new
household, and so he threw her roughly across his broad, hairy
shoulders and leaped back into the trees, bearing Jane Porter
away toward a fate a thousand times worse than death.</p>

<p>Esmeralda's scream of terror had mingled once with that of
Jane Porter, and then, as was Esmeralda's manner under stress of
emergency which required presence of mind, she swooned.</p>

<p>But Jane Porter did not once lose consciousness. It is true
that that awful face, pressing close to hers, and the stench of
the foul breath beating upon her nostrils, paralyzed her with
terror; but her brain was clear, and she comprehended all that
transpired.</p>

<p>With what seemed to her marvelous rapidity the brute bore her
through the forest, but still she did not cry out or struggle.
The sudden advent of the ape had confused her to such an extent
that she thought now that he was bearing her toward the
beach.</p>

<p>For this reason she conserved her energies and her voice until
she could see that they had approached near enough to the camp to
attract the succor she craved.</p>

<p>Poor child! Could she but have known it, she was being borne
farther and farther into the impenetrable jungle.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The scream that had brought Clayton and the two older men
stumbling through the undergrowth had led Tarzan of the Apes
straight to where Esmeralda lay, but it was not Esmeralda in whom
his interest centered, though pausing over her he saw that she
was unhurt.</p>

<p>For a moment he scrutinized the ground below and the trees
above, until the ape that was in him by virtue of training and
environment, combined with the intelligence that was his by right
of birth, told his wondrous woodcraft the whole story as plainly
as though he had seen the thing happen with his own eyes.</p>

<p>And then he was gone again into the swaying trees, following
the high-flung spoor which no other human eye could have
detected, much less translated.</p>

<p>At boughs' ends, where the anthropoid swings from one tree to
another, there is most to mark the trail, but least to point the
direction of the quarry, for there the pressure is downward
always, toward the small end of the branch, whether the ape be
leaving or entering a tree; but nearer the center of the tree,
where the signs of passage are fainter, the direction is plainly
marked.</p>

<p>Here, on this branch, a caterpillar has been crushed by the
fugitive's great foot, and Tarzan knows instinctively where that
same foot would touch in the next stride. Here he looks to find a
tiny particle of the demolished larva, at times not more than a
speck of moisture.</p>

<p>Again, a minute bit of bark has been upturned by the scraping
hand, and the direction of the break indicates the direction of
the passage. Or some great limb, or the stem of the tree itself
has been brushed by the hairy body, and a tiny shred of hair
tells him by the direction from which it is wedged beneath the
bark that he is on the right trail.</p>

<p>Nor does he need to check his speed to catch these seemingly
faint records of the fleeing beast.</p>

<p>To Tarzan they stand out boldly against all the myriad other
scars and bruises and signs upon the leafy way. But strongest of
all is the scent, for Tarzan is pursuing up the wind, and his
trained nostrils are as sensitive as a hound's.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the lower orders are
specially endowed by nature with better olfactory nerves than
man, but it is merely a matter of development.</p>

<p>Man's survival does not hinge so greatly upon the perfection
of his senses. His power to reason has relieved them of many of
their duties, and so they have, to some extent, atrophied, as
have the muscles which move the ears and scalp, merely from
disuse.</p>

<p>The muscles are there, about your ears and beneath your scalp,
and so are the nerves which transmit sensations to your brain,
but they are under-developed in you because you do not need
them.</p>

<p>Not so with Tarzan of the Apes. From early infancy his
survival had depended upon acuteness of eyesight, hearing, smell,
touch, and taste far more than upon the more slowly developed
organ of reason.</p>

<p>The least developed of all, in Tarzan, was the sense of taste,
for he could eat luscious fruits, or raw flesh, long buried, with
almost equal appreciation; but in that he differed but slightly
from more civilized epicures.</p>

<p>Almost silently the ape-man sped on in the track of Terkoz and
his prey, but the sound of his approach reached the ears of the
fleeing beast and spurred it on to greater speed.</p>

<p>Three miles were covered before Tarzan overtook them, and then
Terkoz, seeing that further flight was futile, dropped to the
ground in a small open glade, that he might turn and fight for
his prize, or be free to escape unhampered if he saw that the
pursuer was more than a match for him.</p>

<p>He still grasped Jane Porter in one great arm as Tarzan
bounded like a leopard into the arena which nature had provided
for this primeval-like battle.</p>

<p>When Terkoz saw that it was Tarzan who pursued him, he jumped
to the conclusion that this was Tarzan's woman, since they were
of the same kind&mdash;white and hairless&mdash;and so he
rejoiced at this opportunity for double revenge upon his hated
enemy.</p>

<p>To Jane Porter the strange apparition of this god-like man was
as wine to sick nerves.</p>

<p>From the description which Clayton and her father and Mr.
Philander had given her, she knew that it must be the same
wonderful creature who had saved them, and she saw in him only a
protector and a friend.</p>

<p>But as Terkoz pushed her roughly aside to meet Tarzan's
charge, and she saw the great proportions of the ape and the
mighty muscles and the fierce fangs, her heart quailed. How could
any animal vanquish such a mighty antagonist?</p>

<p>Like two charging bulls they came together, and like two
wolves sought each other's throat. Against the long canines of
the ape was pitted the thin blade of the man's knife.</p>

<p>Jane Porter&mdash;her lithe, young form flattened against the
trunk of a great tree, her hands tight pressed against her rising
and falling bosom, and her eyes wide with mingled horror,
fascination, fear, and admiration&mdash;watched the primordial
ape battle with the primeval man for possession of a woman&mdash;for her.</p>

<p>As the great muscles of the man's back and shoulders knotted
beneath the tension of his efforts, and the huge biceps and
forearm held at bay those mighty tusks, the veil of centuries of
civilization and culture was swept from the blurred vision of the
Baltimore girl.</p>

<p>When the long knife drank deep a dozen times of Terkoz's
heart's blood, and the great carcass rolled lifeless upon the
ground, it was a primeval woman who sprang forward with
outstretched arms toward the primeval man who had fought for her
and won her.</p>

<p>And Tarzan?</p>

<p>He did what no red-blooded man needs lessons in doing. He took
his woman in his arms and smothered her upturned, panting lips
with kisses.</p>

<p>For a moment Jane Porter lay there with half-closed eyes. For
a moment&mdash;the first in her young life&mdash;she knew the
meaning of love.</p>

<p>But as suddenly as the veil had been withdrawn it dropped
again, and an outraged conscience suffused her face with its
scarlet mantle, and a mortified woman thrust Tarzan of the Apes
from her and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Tarzan had been surprised when he had found the girl he had
learned to love after a vague and abstract manner a willing
prisoner in his arms. Now he was surprised that she repulsed
him.</p>

<p>He came close to her once more and took hold of her arm. She
turned upon him like a tigress, striking his great breast with
her tiny hands.</p>

<p>Tarzan could not understand it.</p>

<p>A moment ago and it had been his intention to hasten Jane
Porter back to her people, but that little moment was lost now in
the dim and distant past of things which were but can never be
again, and with it the good intention had gone to join the
impossible.</p>

<p>Since then Tarzan of the Apes had felt a warm, lithe form
close pressed to his. Hot, sweet breath against his cheek and
mouth had fanned a new flame to life within his breast, and
perfect lips had clung to his in burning kisses that had seared a
deep brand into his soul&mdash;a brand which marked a new
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Again he laid his hand upon her arm. Again she repulsed him.
And then Tarzan of the Apes did just what his first ancestor
would have done.</p>

<p>He took his woman in his arms and carried her into the
jungle.</p>

<p><br> Early the following morning the four within the little
cabin by the beach were awakened by the booming of a cannon.
Clayton was the first to rush out, and there, beyond the harbor's
mouth, he saw two vessels lying at anchor.</p>

<p>One was the <i>Arrow</i> and the other a small French cruiser.
The sides of the latter were crowded with men gazing shoreward,
and it was evident to Clayton, as to the others who had now
joined him, that the gun which they had heard had been fired to
attract their attention if they still remained at the cabin.</p>

<p>Both vessels lay at a considerable distance from shore, and it
was doubtful if their glasses would locate the waving hats of the
little party far in between the harbor's points.</p>

<p>Esmeralda had removed her red apron and was waving it
frantically above her head; but Clayton, still fearing that even
this might not be seen, hurried off toward the northern point
where lay his signal pyre ready for the match.</p>

<p>It seemed an age to him, as to those who waited breathlessly
behind, ere he reached the great pile of dry branches and
underbrush.</p>

<p>As he broke from the dense wood and came in sight of the
vessels again, he was filled with consternation to see that the
<i>Arrow</i> was making sail and that the cruiser was already
under way.</p>

<p>Quickly lighting the pyre in a dozen places, he hurried to the
extreme point of the promontory, where he stripped off his shirt,
and, tying it to a fallen branch, stood waving it back and forth
above him.</p>

<p>But still the vessels continued to stand out; and he had given
up all hope, when the great column of smoke, arising above the
forest in one dense vertical shaft, attracted the attention of a
lookout aboard the cruiser, and instantly a dozen glasses were
leveled on the beach.</p>

<p>Presently Clayton saw the two ships come about again; and
while the <i>Arrow</i> lay drifting quietly on the ocean, the
cruiser steamed slowly back toward shore.</p>

<p>At some distance away she stopped, and a boat was lowered and
dispatched toward the beach.</p>

<p>As it was drawn up a young officer stepped out.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Clayton, I presume?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Thank God, you have come!" was Clayton's reply. "And it may
be that it is not too late even now."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, monsieur?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>Clayton told of the abduction of Jane Porter and the need of
armed men to aid in the search for her.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> exclaimed the officer, sadly. "Yesterday
and it would not have been too late. To-day and it may be better
that the poor lady were never found. It is horrible, monsieur. It
is too horrible."</p>

<p>Other boats had now put off from the cruiser, and Clayton,
having pointed out the harbor's entrance to the officer, entered
the boat with him and its nose was turned toward the little
landlocked bay, into which the other craft followed.</p>

<p>Soon the entire party had landed where stood Professor Porter,
Mr. Philander and the weeping Esmeralda.</p>

<p>Among the officers in the last boats to put off from the
cruiser was the commander of the vessel; and when he had heard
the story of Jane Porter's abduction, he generously called for
volunteers to accompany Professor Porter and Clayton in their
search.</p>

<p>Not an officer or a man was there of those brave and
sympathetic Frenchmen who did not quickly beg leave to be one of
the expedition.</p>

<p>The commander selected twenty men and two officers, Lieutenant
D'Arnot and Lieutenant Charpentier. A boat was dispatched to the
cruiser for provisions, ammunition, and carbines; the men were
already armed with revolvers.</p>

<p>Then, to Clayton's inquiries as to how they had happened to
anchor off shore and fire a signal gun, the commander, Captain
Dufranne, explained that a month before they had sighted the
<i>Arrow</i> bearing southwest under considerable canvas, and
that when they had signaled her to come about she had but crowded
on more sail.</p>

<p>They had kept her hull-up until sunset, firing several shots
after her, but the next morning she was nowhere to be seen. They
had then continued to cruise up and down the coast for several
weeks, and had about forgotten the incident of the recent chase,
when, early one morning a few days before, the lookout had
descried a vessel laboring in the trough of a heavy sea and
evidently entirely from under control.</p>

<p>As they steamed nearer to the derelict they were surprised to
note that it was the same vessel that had run from them a few
weeks earlier. Her forestay-sail and mizzen-spanker were set as
though an effort had been made to hold her head up into the wind,
but the sheets had parted, and the sails were tearing to ribbons
in the half gale of wind.</p>

<p>In the high sea that was running it was a difficult and
dangerous task to attempt to put a prize crew aboard her; and as
no signs of life had been seen above deck, it was decided to
stand by until the wind and sea abated; but just then a figure
was seen clinging to the rail and feebly waving a mute signal of
despair toward them.</p>

<p>Immediately a boat's crew was ordered out and an attempt was
successfully made to board the <i>Arrow</i>. The sight that met
the Frenchmen's eyes as they clambered over the ship's side was
appalling.</p>

<p>A dozen dead and dying men rolled hither and thither upon the
pitching deck, the living intermingled with the dead. Two of the
corpses appeared to have been partially devoured as though by
wolves.</p>

<p>The prize crew soon had the vessel under proper sail once more
and the living members of the ill-starred company carried below
to their hammocks.</p>

<p>The dead were wrapped in tarpaulins and lashed on deck to be
identified by their comrades before being consigned to the
deep.</p>

<p>None of the living was conscious when the Frenchmen reached
the <i>Arrow's</i> deck. Even the poor devil who had waved the
single despairing signal of distress had lapsed into
unconsciousness before he had learned whether it had availed or
not.</p>

<p>It did not take the French officer long to learn what had
caused the terrible condition aboard; for when water and brandy
were sought to restore the men, it was found that not only was
there not any of either, but not a vestige of food of any
description.</p>

<p>He immediately signalled to the cruiser to send water,
medicine, and provisions, and another boat made the perilous trip
to the <i>Arrow</i>.</p>

<p>When restoratives had been applied several of the men regained
consciousness, and then the whole story was told. That part of it
we know up to the sailing of the <i>Arrow</i> after the murder of
Snipes, and the burial of his body above the treasure-chest.</p>

<p>It seems that the pursuit by the cruiser had so terrorized the
mutineers that they had continued out across the Atlantic for
several days after losing her; but on discovering the meager
supply of water and provisions aboard, they had turned back
toward the east.</p>

<p>With no one on board who understood navigation, discussions
soon arose as to their whereabouts; and as three days' sailing to
the east did not raise land, they bore off to the north, fearing
that the high north winds that had prevailed had driven them
south of the southern extremity of Africa.</p>

<p>They kept on a north-northeasterly course for two days, when
they were overtaken by a calm which lasted for nearly a week.
Their water was gone, and in another day they would be without
food.</p>

<p>Conditions changed rapidly from bad to worse. One man went mad
and leaped overboard. Soon another opened his veins and drank his
own blood.</p>

<p>When he died they threw him overboard also, though there were
those among them who wanted to keep the corpse on board. Hunger
was changing them from human beasts to wild beasts.</p>

<p>Two days before they had been picked up by the cruiser they
had become too weak to handle the vessel, and that same day three
men died. On the following morning it was seen that one of the
corpses had been partially devoured.</p>

<p>All that day the men lay glaring at each other like beasts of
prey, and the following morning two of the corpses lay almost
entirely stripped of flesh.</p>

<p>The men were but little stronger for their ghoulish repast,
for the want of water was by far the greatest agony with which
they had to contend. And then the cruiser had come.</p>

<p>When those who could had recovered, the entire story had been
told to the French commander, but the men were too ignorant to be
able to tell him at just what point on the coast the professor
and his party had been marooned, so the cruiser had steamed
slowly along within sight of land, firing occasional signal guns
and scanning every inch of the beach with glasses.</p>

<p>They had anchored by night so as not to neglect a particle of
the shore line, and it had happened that the preceding night had
brought them off the very beach where lay the little camp they
sought.</p>

<p>The signal guns of the afternoon before had not been heard by
those on shore, it was presumed, because they had doubtless been
in the thick of the jungle searching for Jane Porter, where the
noise of their own crashing through the underbrush would have
drowned the report of a far distant gun.</p> <p>By the time the
two parties had narrated their several adventures, the cruiser's
boat had returned with supplies and arms for the expedition.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the little body of sailors and the two
French officers, together with Professor Porter and Clayton, set
off upon their hopeless and ill-fated quest into the untracked
jungle.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; HEREDITY</h2>

<p class="first"> WHEN Jane Porter realized that she was being
borne away a captive by the strange forest creature who had
rescued her from the clutches of the ape she struggled
desperately to escape, but the strong arms, that held her as
easily as though she had been but a day-old babe, only pressed a
little more tightly.</p>

<p>So presently she gave up the futile effort and lay quietly,
looking through half-closed lids at the face of the man who
strode easily through the tangled undergrowth with her.</p>

<p>The face above her was one of extraordinary beauty.</p>

<p>A perfect type of the strongly masculine, unmarred by
dissipation, or brutal or degrading passions. For, though Tarzan
of the Apes was a killer of men and of beasts, he killed as the
hunter kills, dispassionately, except on those rare occasions
when he had killed for hate&mdash;though not the brooding,
malevolent hate which marks the features of its own with hideous
lines.</p>

<p>When Tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled, and
smiles are the foundation of beauty.</p>

<p>One thing the girl had noticed particularly when she had seen
Tarzan rushing upon Terkoz&mdash;the vivid scarlet band upon his
forehead, from above the left eye to the scalp; but now as she
scanned his features she noticed that it was gone, and only a
thin white line marked the spot where it had been.</p>

<p>As she lay more quietly in his arms Tarzan slightly relaxed
his grip upon her.</p>

<p>Once he looked down into her eyes and smiled, and the girl had
to close her own to shut out the vision of that handsome, winning
face.</p>

<p>Presently Tarzan took to the trees, and Jane Porter, wondering
that she felt no fear, began to realize that in many respects she
had never felt more secure in her whole life than now as she lay
in the arms of this strong, wild creature, being borne, God alone
knew where or to what fate, deeper and deeper into the savage
fastness of the untamed forest.</p>

<p>When, with closed eyes, she commenced to speculate upon the
future, and terrifying fears were conjured by a vivid
imagination, she had but to raise her lids and look upon that
noble face so close to hers to dissipate the last remnant of
apprehension.</p>

<p>No, he could never harm her; of that she was convinced when
she translated the fine features and the frank, brave eyes above
her into the chivalry which they proclaimed.</p>

<p>On and on they went through what seemed to Jane Porter a solid
mass of verdure, yet ever there appeared to open before this
forest god a passage, as by magic, which closed behind them as
they passed.</p>

<p>Scarce a branch scraped against her, yet above and below,
before and behind, the view presented naught but a solid mass of
inextricably interwoven branches and creepers.</p>

<p>As Tarzan moved steadily onward his mind was occupied with
many strange and new thoughts. Here was a problem the like of
which he had never encountered, and he felt rather than reasoned
that he must meet it as a man and not as an ape.</p>

<p>The free movement through the middle terrace, which was the
route he had followed for the most part, had helped to cool the
ardor of the first fierce passion of his new found love.</p>

<p>Now he discovered himself speculating upon the fate which
would have fallen to the girl had he not rescued her from
Terkoz.</p>

<p>He knew why the ape had not killed her, and he commenced to
compare his intentions with those of Terkoz.</p>

<p>True, it was the order of the jungle for the male to take his
mate by force; but could Tarzan be guided by the laws of the
beasts? Was not Tarzan a Man? But how did men do? He was puzzled;
for he did not know.</p>

<p>He wished that he might ask the girl, and then it came to him
that she had already answered him in the futile struggle she had
made to escape and to repulse him.</p>

<p>But now they had come to their destination, and Tarzan of the
Apes with Jane Porter in his strong arms, swung lightly to the
turf of the arena where the great apes held their councils and
danced the wild orgy of the Dum-Dum.</p>

<p>Though they had come many miles, it was still but mid-afternoon, and the amphitheater was bathed in the half light
which filtered through the maze of encircling foliage.</p>

<p>The green turf looked soft and cool and inviting. The myriad
noises of the jungle seemed far distant and hushed to a mere echo
of blurred sounds, rising and falling like the surf upon a remote
shore.</p>

<p>A feeling of dreamy peacefulness stole over Jane Porter as she
sank down upon the grass where Tarzan had placed her, and as she
looked up at his great figure towering above her, there was added
a strange sense of perfect security.</p>

<p>As she watched him from beneath half-closed lids, Tarzan
crossed the little circular clearing toward the trees upon the
further side. She noted the graceful majesty of his carriage, the
perfect symmetry of his magnificent figure and the poise of his
well-shaped head upon his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>What a perfect creature! There could be naught of cruelty or
baseness beneath that god-like exterior. Never, she thought had
such a man strode the earth since God created the first in his
own image.</p>

<p>With a bound Tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared.
Jane Porter wondered where he had gone. Had he left her there to
her fate in the lonely jungle?</p>

<p>She glanced nervously about. Every vine and bush seemed but
the lurking-place of some huge and horrible beast waiting to bury
gleaming fangs in her soft flesh. Every sound she magnified into
the stealthy creeping of a sinuous and malignant body.</p>

<p>How different now that he had left her!</p>

<p>For a few minutes, that seemed hours to the frightened girl,
she sat with tense nerves waiting for the spring of the crouching
thing that was to end her misery of apprehension.</p>

<p>She almost prayed for the cruel teeth that would give her
unconsciousness and surcease from the agony of fear.</p>

<p>She heard a sudden, slight sound behind her. With a shriek she
sprang to her feet and turned to face her end.</p>

<p>There stood Tarzan, his arms filled with ripe and luscious
fruit.</p>

<p>Jane Porter reeled and would have fallen, had not Tarzan,
dropping his burden, caught her in his arms. She did not lose
consciousness, but she clung tightly to him, shuddering and
trembling like a frightened deer.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes stroked her soft hair, and tried to comfort
and quiet her as Kala had him, when, as a little ape, he had been
frightened by Sabor, the lioness, or Histah, the snake.</p>

<p>Once he pressed his lips lightly upon her forehead, and she
did not move, but closed her eyes and sighed.</p>

<p>She could not analyze her feelings, nor did she wish to
attempt it. She was satisfied to feel the safety of those strong
arms, and to leave her future to fate; for the last few hours had
taught her to trust this strange wild creature of the forest as
she would have trusted but few of the men of her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>As she thought of the strangeness of it, there commenced to
dawn upon her the realization that she had, possibly, learned
something else which she had never really known before&mdash;love. She wondered and then she smiled.</p>

<p>And still smiling, she pushed Tarzan gently away; and looking
at him with a half-smiling, half-quizzical expression that made
her face wholly entrancing, she pointed to the fruit upon the
ground, and seated herself upon the edge of the earthen drum of
the anthropoids, for hunger was asserting itself.</p>

<p>Tarzan quickly gathered up the fruit, and, bringing it, laid
it at her feet; and then he, too, sat upon the drum beside her,
and with his knife opened and prepared the various viands for her
meal.</p>

<p>Together and in silence they ate, occasionally stealing sly
glances at one another, until finally Jane Porter broke into a
merry laugh in which Tarzan joined.</p>

<p>"I wish you spoke English," said the girl.</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head, and an expression of wistful and
pathetic longing sobered his laughing eyes.</p>

<p>Then Jane Porter tried speaking to him in French, and then in
German; but she had to laugh at her own blundering attempt at the
latter tongue.</p>

<p>"Anyway," she said to him in English, "you understand my
German as well as they did in Berlin."</p>

<p>Tarzan had long since reached a decision as to what his future
procedure should be. He had had time to recollect all that he had
read of the ways of men and women in the books at the cabin. He
would act as he imagined the men in the books would have acted
were they in his place.</p>

<p>Again he arose and went into the trees, but first he tried to
explain by means of signs that he would return shortly, and he
did so well that Jane Porter understood and was not afraid when
he had gone.</p>

<p>Only a feeling of loneliness came over her and she watched the
point where he had disappeared, with longing eyes, awaiting his
return. As before, she was appraised of his presence by a soft
sound behind her, and turned to see him coming across the turf
with a great armful of branches.</p>

<p>Then he went back again into the jungle and in a few minutes
reappeared with a quantity of soft grasses and ferns. Two more
trips he made until he had quite a pile of material at hand.</p>

<p>Then he spread the ferns and grasses upon the ground in a soft
flat bed, and above it he leaned many branches together so that
they met a few feet over its center. Upon these he spread layers
of huge leaves of the great elephant's ear, and with more
branches and more leaves he closed one end of the little shelter
he had built.</p>

<p>Then they sat down together again upon the edge of the drum
and tried to talk by signs.</p>

<p>The magnificent diamond locket which hung about Tarzan's neck,
had been a source of much wonderment to Jane Porter. She pointed
to it now, and Tarzan removed it and handed the pretty bauble to
her.</p>

<p>She saw that it was the work of a skilled artisan and that the
diamonds were of great brilliancy and superbly set, but the
cutting of them denoted that they were of a former day.</p>

<p>She noticed too that the locket opened, and, pressing the
hidden clasp, she saw the two halves spring apart to reveal in
either section an ivory miniature.</p>

<p>One was of a beautiful woman and the other might have been a
likeness of the man who sat beside her, except for a subtle
difference of expression that was scarcely definable.</p>

<p>She looked up at Tarzan to find him leaning toward her gazing
on the miniatures with an expression of astonishment. He reached
out his hand for the locket and took it away from her, examining
the likenesses within with unmistakable signs of surprise and new
interest. His manner clearly denoted that he had never before
seen them, nor imagined that the locket opened.</p>

<p>This fact caused Jane Porter to indulge in further
speculation, and it taxed her imagination to picture how this
beautiful ornament came into the possession of a wild and savage
creature of the unexplored jungles of Africa.</p>

<p>Still more wonderful, how it contained the likeness of one who
might be a brother, or, more likely, the father of this woodland
demi-god who was even ignorant of the fact that the locket
opened.</p>

<p>Tarzan was still gazing with fixity at the two faces.
Presently he removed the quiver from his shoulder, and emptying
the arrows upon the ground reached into the bottom of the bag-like receptacle and drew forth a flat object wrapped in many soft
leaves and tied with bits of long grass.</p>

<p>Carefully he unwrapped it, removing layer after layer of
leaves until at length he held a photograph in his hand.</p>

<p>Pointing to the miniature of the man within the locket he
handed the photograph to Jane Porter, holding the open locket
beside it.</p>

<p>The photograph only served to puzzle the girl still more, for
it was evidently another likeness of the same man whose picture
rested in the locket beside that of the beautiful young
woman.</p>

<p>Tarzan was looking at her with an expression of puzzled
bewilderment in his eyes as she glanced up at him. He seemed to
be framing a question with his lips.</p>

<p>The girl pointed to the photograph and then to the miniature
and then to him, as though to indicate that she thought the
likenesses were of him, but he only shook his head, and then
shrugging his great shoulders, he took the photograph from her
and having carefully rewrapped it, placed it again in the bottom
of his quiver.</p>

<p>For a few moments he sat in silence, his eyes bent upon the
ground, while Jane Porter held the little locket in her hand,
turning it over and over in an endeavor to find some further clue
that might lead to the identity of its original owner.</p>

<p>At length a simple explanation occurred to her.</p>

<p>The locket had belonged to Lord Greystoke, and the likenesses
were of himself and Lady Alice.</p>

<p>This wild creature had simply found it in the cabin by the
beach. How stupid of her not to have thought of that solution
before.</p>

<p>But to account for the strange likeness between Lord Greystoke
and this forest god&mdash;that was quite beyond her, and it is
not strange that she did not imagine that this naked savage was
indeed an English nobleman.</p>

<p>At length Tarzan looked up to watch the girl as she examined
the locket. He could not fathom the meaning of the faces within,
but he could read the interest and fascination upon the face of
the live young creature by his side.</p>

<p>She noticed that he was watching her and thinking that he
wished his ornament again she held it out to him. He took it from
her and taking the chain in his two hands he placed it about her
neck, smiling at her expression of surprise at his unexpected
gift.</p>

<p>Jane Porter shook her head vehemently and would have removed
the golden links from about her throat, but Tarzan would not let
her. Taking her hands in his, when she insisted upon it, he held
them tightly to prevent her.</p>

<p>At last she desisted and with a little laugh raised the locket
to her lips, and, rising, dropped him a little courtesy.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not know precisely what she meant, but he guessed
correctly that it was her way of acknowledging the gift, and so
he rose, too, and taking the locket in his hand, stooped gravely
like some courtier of old, and pressed his lips upon it where
hers had rested.</p>

<p>It was a stately and gallant little compliment performed with
the grace and dignity of utter unconsciousness of self. It was
the hall-mark of his aristocratic birth, the natural outcropping
of many generations of fine breeding, an hereditary instinct of
graciousness which a lifetime of uncouth and savage training and
environment could not eradicate.</p>

<p>It was growing dark now, and so they ate again of the fruit
which was both food and drink for them, and then Tarzan rose and
leading Jane Porter to the little bower he had erected, motioned
her to go within.</p>

<p>For the first time in hours a feeling of fear swept over her,
and Tarzan felt her draw away as though shrinking from him.</p>

<p>Contact with this girl for half a day had left a very
different Tarzan from the one on whom the morning's sun had
risen.</p>

<p>Now, in every fiber of his being, heredity spoke louder than
training.</p>

<p>He had not in one swift transition become a polished gentleman
from a savage ape-man, but at last the instincts of the former
predominated, and over all was the desire to please the woman he
loved, and to appear well in her eyes.</p>

<p>So Tarzan of the Apes did the only thing he knew to assure
Jane Porter of her safety. He removed his hunting knife from its
sheath and handed it to her hilt first, again motioning her into
the bower.</p>

<p>The girl understood, and taking the long knife she entered and
lay down upon the soft grasses while Tarzan of the Apes stretched
himself upon the ground across the entrance.</p>

<p>And thus the rising sun found them in the morning.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Jane Porter awoke, she did not at first recall the
strange events of the preceding day, and so she wondered at her
odd surroundings&mdash;the little leafy bower, the soft grasses
of her bed, the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her
feet.</p>

<p>Slowly the circumstances of her position crept one by one into
her mind. And then a great wonderment arose in her heart&mdash;a
mighty wave of thankfulness and gratitude that though she had
been in such terrible danger, yet she was unharmed.</p>

<p>She moved to the entrance of the shelter to look for Tarzan.
He was gone; but this time no fear assailed her for she knew that
he would return.</p>

<p>In the grass at the entrance to her bower she saw the imprint
of his body where he had lain all night to guard her. She knew
that the fact that he had been there was all that had permitted
her to sleep in such peaceful security.</p>

<p>With him near, who could entertain fear? She wondered if there
was another man on earth with whom a girl could feel so safe in
the heart of this savage African jungle. Why even the lions and
panthers had no fears for her now.</p>

<p>She looked up to see his lithe form drop softly from a nearby
tree. As he caught her eyes upon him his face lighted with that
frank and radiant smile that had won her confidence the day
before.</p>

<p>As he approached her Jane Porter's heart beat faster and her
eyes brightened as they had never done before at the approach of
any man.</p>

<p>He had again been gathering fruit and this he laid at the
entrance of her bower. Once more they sat down together to
eat.</p>

<p>Jane Porter commenced to wonder what his plans were. Would he
take her back to the beach or would he keep her here? Suddenly
she realized that the matter did not seem to give her much
concern. Could it be that she did not care!</p>

<p>She began to comprehend, also, that she was entirely contented
sitting here by the side of this smiling giant eating delicious
fruit in a sylvan paradise far within the remote depths of an
African jungle&mdash;that she was contented and very happy.</p>

<p>She could not understand it. Her reason told her that she
should be torn by wild anxieties, weighted by dread fears, cast
down by gloomy forebodings; but instead, her heart was singing
and she was smiling into the answering face of the man beside
her.</p>

<p>When they had finished their breakfast Tarzan went to her
bower and recovered his knife. The girl had entirely forgotten
it. She realized that it was because she had forgotten the fear
that prompted her to accept it.</p>

<p>Motioning her to follow, Tarzan walked toward the trees at the
edge of the arena, and taking her in one strong arm swung to the
branches above.</p>

<p>The girl knew that he was taking her back to her people, and
she could not understand the sudden feeling of loneliness and
sorrow which crept over her.</p>

<p>For hours they swung slowly along.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes did not hurry. He tried to draw out the
sweet pleasure of that journey with those dear arms about his
neck as long as possible, and so he went far south of the direct
route to the beach.</p>

<p>Several times they halted for brief rests, which Tarzan did
not need, and at noon they stopped for an hour at a little brook,
where they quenched their thirst, and ate.</p>

<p>So it was nearly sunset when they came to the clearing, and
Tarzan, dropping to the ground beside a great tree, parted the
tall jungle grass and pointed out the little cabin to her.</p>

<p>She took him by the hand to lead him to it, that she might
tell her father that this man had saved her from death and worse
than death, that he had watched over her as carefully as a mother
might have done.</p>

<p>But again the timidity of the wild thing in the face of human
habitation swept over Tarzan of the Apes. He drew back, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>The girl came close to him, looking up with pleading eyes.
Somehow she could not bear the thought of his going back into the
terrible jungle alone.</p>

<p>Still he shook his head, and finally he drew her to him very
gently and stooped to kiss her, but first he looked into her eyes
and waited to learn if she were pleased, or if she would repulse
him.</p>

<p>Just an instant the girl hesitated, and then she realized the
truth, and throwing her arms about his neck she drew his face to
hers and kissed him&mdash;unashamed.</p>

<p>"I love you&mdash;I love you," she murmured.</p>

<p>From far in the distance came the faint sound of many guns.
Tarzan and Jane Porter raised their heads.</p>

<p>From the cabin came Mr. Philander and Esmeralda.</p>

<p>From where Tarzan and the girl stood they could not see the
two vessels lying at anchor in the harbor.</p>

<p>Tarzan pointed toward the sounds, touched his breast and
pointed again. She understood. He was going, and something told
her that it was because he thought her people were in danger.</p>

<p>Again he kissed her.</p>

<p>"Come back to me," she whispered. "I shall wait for you&mdash;always."</p>

<p>He was gone&mdash;and Jane Porter turned to walk across the
clearing to the cabin.</p>

<p>Mr. Philander was the first to see her. It was dusk and Mr.
Philander was very near sighted.</p>

<p>"Quickly, Esmeralda!" he cried. "Let us seek safety within; it
is a lioness. Bless me!"</p>

<p>Esmeralda did not bother to verify Mr. Philander's vision. His
tone was enough. She was within the cabin and had slammed and
bolted the door before he had finished pronouncing her name. The
"Bless me" was startled out of Mr. Philander by the discovery
that Esmeralda, in the exuberance of her haste, had fastened him
upon the same side of the door as was the close-approaching
lioness.</p>

<p>He beat furiously upon the heavy portal.</p>

<p>"Esmeralda! Esmeralda!" he shrieked. "Let me in. I am being
devoured by a lion."</p>

<p>Esmeralda thought that the noise upon the door was made by the
lioness in her attempts to pursue her, so, after her custom, she
fainted.</p>

<p>Mr. Philander cast a frightened glance behind him.</p>

<p>Horrors! The thing was quite close now. He tried to scramble
up the side of the cabin, and succeeded in catching a fleeting
hold upon the thatched roof.</p>

<p>For a moment he hung there, clawing with his feet like a cat
on a clothesline, but presently a piece of the thatch came away,
and Mr. Philander, preceding it, was precipitated upon his
back.</p>

<p>At the instant he fell a remarkable item of natural history
leaped to his mind. If one feigns death lions and lionesses are
supposed to ignore one, according to Mr. Philander's faulty
memory.</p>


<p>So Mr. Philander lay as he had fallen, frozen into the horrid
semblance of death. As his arms and legs had been extended stiffly
upward as he came to earth upon his back the attitude of death
was anything but impressive.</p>

<p>Jane Porter had been watching his antics in mild eyed
surprise. Now she laughed&mdash;a little choking, gurgle of a
laugh; but it was enough. Mr. Philander rolled over upon his side
and peered about. At length he discovered her.</p>

<p>"Jane!" he cried. "Jane Porter. Bless me!"</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet and rushed toward her. He could not
believe that it was she, and alive.</p>

<p>"Bless me! Where did you come from? Where in the world have
you been? How&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy, Mr. Philander," interrupted the girl, "I never can
remember so many questions."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mr. Philander. "Bless me! I am so filled
with surprise and exuberant delight at seeing you safe and well
again that I scarcely know what I am saying, really. But come,
tell me all that has happened to you."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch21" name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE VILLAGE OF
TORTURE</h2>

<p class="first"> As the little expedition of sailors toiled
through the dense jungle searching for signs of Jane Porter, the
futility of their venture became more and more apparent, but the
grief of the old man and the hopeless eyes of the young
Englishman prevented the kind hearted D'Arnot from turning
back.</p>

<p>He thought that there might be a bare possibility of finding
her body, or the remains of it, for he was positive that she had
been devoured by some beast of prey. He deployed his men into a
skirmish line from the point where Esmeralda had been found, and
in this extended formation they pushed their way, sweating and
panting, through the tangled vines and creepers.</p>

<p>It was slow work. Noon found them but a few miles inland. They
halted for a brief rest then, and after pushing on for a short
distance further one of the men discovered a well-marked
trail.</p>

<p>It was an old elephant track, and D'Arnot after consulting
with Professor Porter and Clayton decided to follow it.</p>

<p>The path wound through the jungle in a northeasterly
direction, and along it the column moved in single file.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D'Arnot was in the lead and moving at a quick pace,
for the trail was comparatively open. Immediately behind him came
Professor Porter, but as he could not keep pace with the younger
man D'Arnot was a hundred yards in advance when suddenly a half
dozen black warriors arose about him.</p>

<p>D'Arnot gave a warning shout to his column as the blacks
closed on him, but before he could draw his revolver he had been
pinioned and dragged into the jungle.</p>

<p>His cry had alarmed the sailors and a dozen of them sprang
forward past Professor Porter, running up the trail to their
officer's aid.</p>

<p>They did not know the cause of his outcry, only that it was a
warning of danger ahead.</p>

<p>They had rushed past the spot where D'Arnot had been seized
when a spear hurled from the jungle transfixed one of the men,
and then a volley of arrows fell among them.</p>

<p>Raising their rifles they fired into the underbrush in the
direction from which the missiles had come.</p>

<p>By this time the balance of the party had come up, and volley
after volley was fired toward the concealed foe. It was these
shots that Tarzan and Jane Porter had heard.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charpentier, who had been bringing up the rear of
the column, now came running to the scene, and on hearing the
details of the ambuscade ordered the men to follow him, and
plunged into the tangled vegetation.</p>

<p>In an instant they were in a hand-to-hand fight with some
fifty black warriors of Mbonga's village. Arrows and bullets flew
thick and fast.</p>

<p>Queer African knives and French gun butts mingled for a moment
in savage and bloody duels, but soon the natives fled into the
jungle, leaving the Frenchmen to count their losses.</p>

<p>Four of the twenty were dead, a dozen others were wounded, and
Lieutenant D'Arnot was missing. Night was falling rapidly, and
their predicament was rendered doubly worse through the fact that
they could not even find the elephant trail which they had been
following.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do, make camp where they were until
daylight. Lieutenant Charpentier ordered a clearing made and a
circular abatis of underbrush constructed about the camp.</p>

<p>This work was not completed until long after dark, the men
building a huge fire in the center of the clearing to give them
light to work by.</p>

<p>When all was safe as could be made from the attack of wild
beasts and savage men, Lieutenant Charpentier placed sentries
about the little camp and the tired and hungry men threw
themselves upon the ground to sleep.</p>

<p>The groans of the wounded, mingled with the roaring and
growling of the great beasts which the noise and firelight had
attracted, kept sleep, except in its most fitful form, from the
tired eyes. It was a sad and hungry party that lay through the
long night praying for dawn.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The blacks who had seized D'Arnot, had not waited to
participate in the fight which followed, but instead had dragged
their prisoner a little way through the jungle and then struck
the trail further on beyond the scene of the fighting in which
their fellows were engaged.</p>

<p>They hurried him along, the sounds of battle growing fainter
and fainter as they drew away from the contestants until there
suddenly broke upon D'Arnot's vision a good-sized clearing at one
end of which stood a thatched and palisaded village.</p>

<p>It was now dusk, but the watchers at the gate saw the
approaching trio and distinguished one as a prisoner ere they
reached the portals.</p>

<p>A cry went up within the palisade. A great throng of women and
children rushed out to meet the party.</p>

<p>And then began for the French officer the most terrifying
experience which man can encounter upon earth&mdash;the reception
of a white prisoner into a village of African cannibals.</p>

<p>To add to the fiendishness of their cruel savagery was the
poignant memory of still crueler barbarities practiced upon them
and theirs by the white officers of that arch hypocrite, Leopold
II of Belgium, because of whose atrocities they had fled the
Congo Free State&mdash;a pitiful remnant of what once had been a
mighty tribe.</p>

<p>They fell upon D'Arnot tooth and nail, beating him with sticks
and stones and tearing at him with claw-like hands. Every vestige
of clothing was torn from him, and the merciless blows fell upon
his bare and quivering flesh. But not once did the Frenchman cry
out in pain. A silent prayer rose to his Maker that he be quickly
delivered from his torture.</p>

<p>But the death he prayed for was not to be so easily had. Soon
the warriors beat the women away from their prisoner. He was to
be saved for nobler sport than this; and the first wave of their
passion having subsided they contented themselves with crying out
taunts and insults, and spitting upon him.</p>

<p>Presently they gained the center of the village. There D'Arnot
was bound securely to the great post from which no live man had
ever been released.</p>

<p>A number of the women scattered to their several huts to fetch
pots and water, while others built a row of fires on which
portions of the feast were to be boiled while the balance would
be slowly dried in strips for future use, as they expected the
other warriors to return with many prisoners.</p>

<p>The festivities were delayed awaiting the return of the
warriors who had remained to engage in the skirmish with the
white men, so that it was quite late when all were in the
village, and the dance of death commenced to circle around the
doomed officer.</p>

<p>Half fainting from pain and exhaustion, D'Arnot watched from
beneath half-closed lids what seemed but the vagary of delirium,
or some horrid nightmare from which he must soon awake.</p>

<p>The bestial faces, daubed with color&mdash;the huge mouths and
flabby hanging lips&mdash;the yellow teeth, sharp filed&mdash;the
rolling, demon eyes&mdash;the shining naked bodies&mdash;the
cruel spears. Surely no such creatures really existed upon
earth&mdash;he must indeed be dreaming.</p>

<p>The savage, whirling bodies circled nearer. Now a spear sprang
forth and touched his arm. The sharp pain and the feel of hot,
trickling blood assured him of the awful reality of his hopeless
position.</p>

<p>Another spear and then another touched him. He closed his eyes
and held his teeth firm set&mdash;he would not cry out.</p>

<p>He was a soldier of France, and he would teach these beasts
how an officer and a gentleman died.</p>

<p><br> Tarzan of the Apes needed no interpreter to translate the
story of those distant shots. With Jane Porter's kisses still
warm upon his lips he was swinging with incredible rapidity
through the forest trees straight toward the village of
Mbonga.</p>

<p>He was not interested in the location of the encounter, for he
judged that that would soon be over. Those who were killed he
could not aid, those who escaped would not need his
assistance.</p>

<p>It was to those who had neither been killed or escaped that he
hastened. And he knew that he would find them by the great post
in the center of Mbonga's village.</p>

<p>Many times had Tarzan seen Mbonga's black raiding parties
return from the northward with prisoners, and always were the
same scenes enacted about that grim stake, beneath the flaring
light of many fires.</p>

<p>He knew, too, that they seldom lost much time before
consummating the fiendish purpose of their captures. He doubted
that he would arrive in time to do more than avenge.</p>

<p>Tarzan had looked with complacency upon their former orgies,
only occasionally interfering for the pleasure of baiting the
blacks; but heretofore their victims had been men of their own
color.</p>

<p>Tonight it was different&mdash;white men, men of Tarzan's own
race&mdash;might be even now suffering the agonies of torture in
that grim, jungle fortress.</p>

<p>On he sped. Night had fallen and he traveled high along the
upper terrace where the gorgeous tropic moon lighted the dizzy
pathway through the gently undulating branches of the tree
tops.</p>

<p>Presently he caught the reflection of a distant blaze. It lay
to the right of his path. It must be the light from the camp fire
the two men had built before they were attacked&mdash;Tarzan knew
nothing of the presence of the sailors.</p>

<p>So sure was Tarzan of his jungle knowledge that he did not
turn from his course, but passed the glare at a distance of a
half mile. It was the camp fire of the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more Tarzan swung into the trees above
Mbonga's village. Ah, he was not quite too late! Or, was he? He
could not tell. The figure at the stake was very still, yet the
black warriors were but pricking it.</p>

<p>Tarzan knew their customs. The death blow had not been struck.
He could tell almost to a minute how far the dance had gone.</p>

<p>In another instant Mbonga's knife would sever one of the
victim's ears&mdash;that would mark the beginning of the end, for
very shortly after only a writhing mass of mutilated flesh would
remain.</p>

<p>There would still be life in it, but death then would be the
only charity it craved.</p>

<p>The stake stood forty feet from the nearest tree. Tarzan
coiled his rope. Then there rose suddenly above the fiendish
cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the ape-man.</p>

<p>The dancers halted as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>The rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of the
blacks. It was quite invisible in the flaring lights of the camp
fires.</p>

<p>D'Arnot opened his eyes. A huge black, standing directly
before him, lunged backward as though felled by an invisible
hand.</p>

<p>Struggling and shrieking, his body, rolling from side to side,
moved quickly toward the shadows beneath the trees.</p>

<p>The blacks, their eyes protruding in horror, watched
spellbound.</p>

<p>Once beneath the trees, the body rose straight into the air,
and as it disappeared into the foliage above, the terrified
negroes, screaming with fright, broke into a mad race for the
village gate.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was left alone.</p>

<p>He was a brave man, but he had felt the short hairs bristle
upon the nape of his neck when that uncanny cry rose upon the
air.</p>

<p>As the writhing body of the black soared, as though by
unearthly power, into the dense foliage of the forest, D'Arnot
felt an icy shiver run along his spine, as though death had risen
from a dark grave and laid a cold and clammy finger on his
flesh.</p>

<p>As D'Arnot watched the spot where the body had entered the
tree he heard the sounds of movement there.</p>

<p>The branches swayed as though under the weight of a man's body&mdash;there was a crash and the black came sprawling to earth
again&mdash;to lie very quietly where he had fallen.</p>

<p>Immediately after him came a white body, but this one alighted
erect.</p>

<p>D'Arnot saw a clean-limbed young giant emerge from the shadows
into the firelight and come quickly toward him.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Who could it be? Some new creature of
torture and destruction, doubtless.</p>

<p>D'Arnot waited. His eyes never left the face of the advancing
man. Nor did those frank, clear eyes waver beneath his fixed
gaze.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was reassured, but still without much hope, though he
felt that that face could not mask a cruel heart.</p>

<p>Without a word Tarzan of the Apes cut the bonds which held the
Frenchman. Weak from suffering and loss of blood, he would have
fallen but for the strong arm that caught him.</p>

<p>He felt himself lifted from the ground. There was a sensation
as of flying, and then he lost consciousness.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch22" name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE SEARCH
PARTY</h2>

<p class="first"> WHEN dawn broke upon the little camp of
Frenchmen in the heart of the jungle it found a sad and
disheartened group.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to see their surroundings
Lieutenant Charpentier sent men in groups of three in several
directions to locate the trail, and in ten minutes it was found
and the expedition was hurrying back toward the beach.</p>

<p>It was slow work, for they bore the bodies of six dead men,
two more having succumbed during the night, and several of those
who were wounded required support to move even very slowly.</p>

<p>Charpentier had decided to return to camp for reinforcements,
and then make an attempt to track down the natives and rescue
D'Arnot.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the exhausted men reached
the clearing by the beach, but for two of them the return brought
so great a happiness that all their suffering and heartbreaking
grief was forgotten on the instant.</p>

<p>As the little party emerged from the jungle the first person
that Professor Porter and Cecil Clayton saw was Jane Porter,
standing by the cabin door.</p>

<p>With a little cry of joy and relief she ran forward to greet
them, throwing her arms about her father's neck and bursting into
tears for the first time since they had been cast upon this
hideous and adventurous shore.</p>

<p>Professor Porter strove manfully to suppress his own emotions,
but the strain upon his nerves and weakened vitality were too
much for him, and at length, burying his old face in the girl's
shoulder, he sobbed quietly like a tired child.</p>

<p>Jane Porter led him toward the cabin, and the Frenchmen turned
toward the beach from which several of their fellows were
advancing to meet them.</p>

<p>Clayton, wishing to leave father and daughter alone, joined
the sailors and remained talking with the officers until their
boat pulled away toward the cruiser whither Lieutenant
Charpentier was bound to report the unhappy outcome of his
adventure.</p>

<p>Then Clayton turned back slowly toward the cabin. His heart
was filled with happiness. The woman he loved was safe.</p>

<p>He wondered by what manner of miracle she had been spared. To
see her alive seemed almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>As he approached the cabin he saw Jane Porter coming out. When
she saw him she hurried forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Jane!" he cried, "God has been good to us, indeed. Tell me
how you escaped&mdash;what form Providence took to save you
for&mdash;us."</p>

<p>He had never before called her by her given name. Forty-eight
hours before it would have suffused Jane Porter with a soft glow
of pleasure to have heard that name from Clayton's lips&mdash;now it frightened her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clayton," she said quietly, extending her hand, "first
let me thank you for your chivalrous loyalty to my dear father.
He has told me how noble and self-sacrificing you have been. How
can we ever repay you!"</p>

<p>Clayton noticed that she did not return his familiar
salutation, but he felt no misgivings on that score. She had been
through so much. This was no time to force his love upon her, he
quickly realized.</p>

<p>"I am already repaid," he said. "Just to see you and Professor
Porter both safe, well, and together again. I do not think that I
could much longer have endured the pathos of his quiet and
uncomplaining grief.</p>

<p>"It was the saddest experience of my life, Miss Porter; and
then, added to it, there was my own grief&mdash;the greatest I
have ever known. But his was so hopeless&mdash;it was pitiful. It
taught me that no love, not even that of a man for his wife may
be so deep and terrible and self-sacrificing as the love of a
father for his daughter."</p>

<p>The girl bowed her head. There was a question she wanted to
ask, but it seemed almost sacrilegious in the face of the love of
these two men, and the terrible suffering they had endured while
she sat laughing and happy beside a god-like creature of the
forest, eating delicious fruits and looking with eyes of love
into answering eyes.</p>

<p>But love is a strange master, and human nature is still
stranger, so she asked her question, though she was not coward
enough to attempt to justify herself to her own conscience. She
felt self-hate, but she asked her question nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Where is the forest man who went to rescue you? Why did he
not return?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Clayton. "Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He who has saved each of us&mdash;who saved me from the
gorilla."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Clayton, in surprise. "It was he who rescued you?
You have not told me anything of your adventure, don't you know;
tell me, do."</p>

<p>"But the wood man," she urged. "Have you not seen him? When we
heard the shots in the jungle, very faint and far away, he left
me. We had just reached the clearing, and he hurried off in the
direction of the fighting. I know he went to aid you."</p>

<p>Her tone was almost pleading&mdash;her manner tense with
suppressed emotion. Clayton could not but notice it, and he
wondered, vaguely, why she was so deeply moved&mdash;so anxious
to know the whereabouts of this strange creature. He did not
suspect the truth, for how could he?</p>

<p>Yet a feeling of apprehension of some impending sorrow haunted
him, and in his breast, unknown to himself, was implanted the
first germ of jealousy and suspicion of the ape-man to whom he
owed his life.</p>

<p>"We did not see him," he replied quietly. "He did not join
us." And then after a moment of thoughtful pause: "Possibly he
joined his own tribe&mdash;the men who attacked us." He did not
know why he had said it, for he did not believe it; but love is a
strange master.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him wide-eyed for a moment.</p>

<p>"No!" she exclaimed vehemently, much too vehemently he
thought. "It could not be. They were negroes&mdash;he is a white
man&mdash;and a gentleman."</p>

<p>Clayton looked puzzled. The little green-eyed devil taunted
him.</p>

<p>"He is a strange, half-savage creature of the jungle, Miss
Porter. We know nothing of him. He neither speaks nor understands
any European tongue&mdash;and his ornaments and weapons are those
of the West Coast savages."</p>

<p>Clayton was speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>"There are no other human beings than savages within hundreds
of miles, Miss Porter. He must belong to the tribes which
attacked us, or to some other equally savage&mdash;he may even be
a cannibal."</p>

<p>Jane Porter blanched.</p>

<p>"I will not believe it," she half whispered. "It is not true.
You shall see," she said, addressing Clayton, "that he will come
back and that he will prove that you are wrong. You do not know
him as I do. I tell you that he is a gentleman."</p>

<p>Clayton was a generous and chivalrous man, but something in
the girl's breathless defense of the forest man stirred him to
unreasoning jealousy, so that for the instant he forgot all that
they owed to this wild demi-god, and he answered her with a half
sneer upon his lip.</p>

<p>"Possibly you are right, Miss Porter," he said, "but I do not
think that any of us need worry about our carrion-eating
acquaintance. The chances are that he is some half-demented
castaway who will forget us more quickly, but no more surely,
than we shall forget him. He is only a beast of the jungle, Miss
Porter."</p>

<p>The girl did not answer, but she felt her heart shrivel within
her. Anger and hate against one we love steels our hearts, but
contempt or pity leaves us silent and ashamed.</p>

<p>She knew that Clayton spoke merely what he thought, and for
the first time she began to analyze the structure which supported
her newfound love, and to subject its object to a critical
examination.</p>

<p>Slowly she turned and walked back to the cabin. She tried to
imagine her wood-god by her side in the saloon of an ocean liner.
She saw him eating with his hands, tearing his food like a beast
of prey, and wiping his greasy fingers upon his thighs. She
shuddered.</p>

<p>She saw him as she introduced him to her friends&mdash;uncouth, illiterate&mdash;a boor; and the girl winced.</p>

<p>She had reached her room now, and as she sat upon the edge of
her bed of ferns and grasses, with one hand resting upon her
rising and falling bosom, she felt the hard outlines of the man's
locket beneath her wrist.</p>

<p>She drew it out, holding it in the palm of her hand for a
moment with tear-blurred eyes bent upon it. Then she raised it to
her lips, and crushing it there buried her face in the soft
ferns, sobbing.</p>

<p>"Beast?" she murmured. "Then God make me a beast; for, man or
beast, I am yours."</p>

<p>She did not see Clayton again that day. Esmeralda brought her
supper to her, and she sent word to her father that she was
suffering from the reaction following her adventure.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The next morning Clayton left early with the relief expedition
in search of Lieutenant D'Arnot. There were two hundred armed men
this time, with ten officers and two surgeons, and provisions for
a week.</p>

<p>They carried bedding and hammocks, the latter for transporting
their sick and wounded.</p>

<p>It was a determined and angry company&mdash;a punitive
expedition as well as one of relief. They reached the sight of
the skirmish of the previous expedition shortly after noon, for
they were now traveling a known trail and no time was lost in
exploring.</p>

<p>From there on the elephant-track led straight to Mbonga's
village. It was but two o'clock when the head of the column
halted upon the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charpentier, who was in command, immediately sent a
portion of his force through the jungle to the opposite side of
the village. Another detachment was dispatched to a point before
the village gate, while he remained with the balance upon the
south side of the clearing.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the party which was to take position to
the north, and which would be the last to gain its station should
commence the assault, and that their opening volley should be the
signal for a concerted rush from all sides in an attempt to carry
the village by storm at the first charge.</p>

<p>For half an hour the men with Lieutenant Charpentier crouched
in the dense foliage of the jungle, waiting the signal. To them
it seemed like hours. They could see natives in the fields, and
others moving in and out of the village gate.</p>

<p>At length the signal came&mdash;a sharp rattle of musketry,
and like one man, an answering volley tore from the jungle to the
west and to the south.</p>

<p>The natives in the field dropped their implements and broke
madly for the palisade. The French bullets mowed them down, and
the French sailors bounded over their prostrate bodies straight
for the village gate.</p>

<p>So sudden and unexpected the assault had been that the whites
reached the gates before the frightened natives could bar them,
and in another minute the village street was filled with armed
men fighting hand to hand in an inextricable tangle.</p>

<p>For a few moments the blacks held their ground within the
entrance to the street, but the revolvers, rifles and cutlasses
of the Frenchmen crumpled the native spearmen and struck down the
black archers with their bolts half-drawn.</p>

<p>Soon the battle turned to a wild rout, and then to grim
massacre; for the French sailors had seen bits of D'Arnot's
uniform upon several of the black warriors who opposed them.</p>

<p>They spared the children and those of the women whom they were
not forced to kill in self-defense, but when at length they
stopped, panting, blood covered and sweating, it was because
there lived to oppose them no single warrior of all the savage
village of Mbonga.</p>

<p>Carefully they ransacked every hut and corner of the village,
but no sign of D'Arnot could they find. They questioned the
prisoners by signs, and finally one of the sailors who had served
in the French Congo found that he could make them understand the
bastard tongue that passes for language between the whites and
the more degraded tribes of the coast, but even then they could
learn nothing definite regarding the fate of D'Arnot.</p>

<p>Only excited gestures and expressions of fear could they
obtain in response to their inquiries concerning their fellow;
and at last they became convinced that these were but evidences
of the guilt of these demons who had slaughtered and eaten their
comrade two nights before.</p>

<p>At length all hope left them, and they prepared to camp for
the night within the village. The prisoners were herded into
three huts where they were heavily guarded. Sentries were posted
at the barred gates, and finally the village was wrapped in the
silence of slumber, except for the wailing of the native women
for their dead.</p>

<p><br> The next morning they set out upon the return march.
Their original intention had been to burn the village, but this
idea was abandoned and the prisoners were left behind, weeping
and moaning, but with roofs to cover them and a palisade for
refuge from the beasts of the jungle.</p>

<p>Slowly the expedition retraced its steps of the preceding day.
Ten loaded hammocks retarded its pace. In eight of them lay the
more seriously wounded, while two swung beneath the weight of the
dead.</p>

<p>Clayton and Lieutenant Charpentier brought up the rear of the
column; the Englishman silent in respect for the other's grief,
for D'Arnot and Charpentier had been inseparable friends since
boyhood.</p>

<p>Clayton could not but realize that the Frenchman felt his
grief the more keenly because D'Arnot's sacrifice had been so
futile, since Jane Porter had been rescued before D'Arnot had
fallen into the hands of the savages, and again because the
service in which he had lost his life had been outside his duty
and for strangers and aliens; but when he spoke of it to
Lieutenant Charpentier, the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," he said, "D'Arnot would have chosen to die
thus. I only grieve that I could not have died for him, or at
least with him. I wish that you could have known him better,
monsieur. He was indeed an officer and a gentleman&mdash;a title
conferred on many, but deserved by so few.</p>

<p>"He did not die futilely, for his death in the cause of a
strange American girl will make us, his comrades, face our ends
the more bravely, however they may come to us."</p>

<p>Clayton did not reply, but within him rose a new respect for
Frenchmen which remained undimmed ever after.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>It was quite late when they reached the cabin by the beach. A
single shot before they emerged from the jungle had announced to
those in camp as well as on the ship that the expedition had been
too late&mdash;for it had been prearranged that when they came
within a mile or two of camp one shot was to be fired to denote
failure, or three for success, while two would have indicated
that they had found no sign of either D'Arnot or his black
captors.</p>

<p>So it was a solemn party that awaited their coming, and few
words were spoken as the dead and wounded men were tenderly
placed in boats and rowed silently toward the cruiser.</p>

<p>Clayton, exhausted from his five days of laborious marching
through the jungle and from the effects of his two battles with
the blacks, turned toward the cabin to seek a mouthful of food
and then the comparative ease of his bed of grasses, after two
nights in the jungle.</p>

<p>By the cabin door stood Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"The poor lieutenant?" she asked. "Did you find no trace of
him?"</p>

<p>"We were too late, Miss Porter," he replied sadly.</p>

<p>"Tell me. What had happened?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I cannot, Miss Porter, it is too horrible."</p>

<p>"You do not mean that they had tortured him?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"We do not know what they did to him <i>before</i> they killed
him," he answered, his face drawn with fatigue and the sorrow he
felt for poor D'Arnot&mdash;and he emphasized the word
before.</p>

<p>"<i>Before</i> they killed him! What do you mean? They are not&mdash;? They are not&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She was thinking of what Clayton had said of the forest man's
probable relationship to this tribe and she could not frame the
awful word.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Porter, they were&mdash;cannibals," he said, almost
bitterly, for to him too had suddenly come the thought of the
forest man, and the strange, unaccountable jealousy he had felt
two days before swept over him once more.</p>

<p>And then in sudden brutality that was as unlike Clayton as
courteous consideration is unlike an ape, he blurted out:</p>

<p>"When your forest god left you he was doubtless hurrying to
the feast."</p>

<p>He was sorry ere the words were spoken though he did not know
how cruelly they had cut the girl. His regret was for his
baseless disloyalty to one who had saved the lives of every
member of his party, nor ever offered harm to one.</p>

<p>The girl's head went high.</p>

<p>"There could be but one suitable reply to your assertion, Mr.
Clayton," she said icily, "and I regret that I am not a man, that
I might make it." She turned quickly and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>Clayton was an Englishman, so the girl had passed quite out of
sight before he deduced what reply a man would have made.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," he said ruefully, "she called me a liar. And I
fancy I jolly well deserved it," he added thoughtfully. "Clayton,
my boy, I know you are tired out and unstrung, but that's no
reason why you should make an ass of yourself. You'd better go to
bed."</p>

<p>But before he did so he called gently to Jane Porter upon the
opposite side of the sailcloth partition, for he wished to
apologize, but he might as well have addressed the Sphinx. Then
he wrote upon a piece of paper and shoved it beneath the
partition.</p>

<p>Jane Porter saw the little note and ignored it, for she was
very angry and hurt and mortified, but&mdash;she was a woman, and
so eventually she picked it up and read it.</p> <BR>

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">My Dear Miss Porter</SPAN>:

<p class="letter">I had no reason to insinuate what I did. My
only excuse is that my nerves must be unstrung&mdash;which is no
excuse at all.

<p class="letter">Please try and think that I did not say it. I
am very sorry. I would not have hurt <u>you</u>, above all others
in the world. Say that you forgive me.

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Wm. Cecil Clayton</SPAN>.


<p><BR> "He did think it or he never would have said it,"
reasoned the girl, "but it cannot be true&mdash;oh, I know it is
not true!"</p>

<p>One sentence in the letter frightened her: "I would not have
hurt <i>you</i> above all others in the world."</p>

<p>A week ago that sentence would have filled her with delight,
now it depressed her.</p>

<p>She wished she had never met Clayton. She was sorry that she
had ever seen the forest god&mdash;no, she was glad. And there
was that other note she had found in the grass before the cabin
the day after her return from the jungle, the love note signed by
Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>Who could be this new suitor? If he were another of the wild
denizens of this terrible forest what might he not do to claim
her?</p>

<p>"Esmeralda! Wake up," she cried.</p>

<p>"You make me so irritable, sleeping there peacefully when you
know perfectly well that the world is filled with sorrow."</p>

<p>"Gaberelle!" screamed Esmeralda, sitting up. "What am it now?
A hipponocerous? Where am he, Miss Jane?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Esmeralda, there is nothing. Go back to sleep. You
are bad enough asleep, but you are infinitely worse awake."</p>

<p>"Yasm honey, but what's de matter wif you-all precious? You
acts sorter kinder disgranulated dis ebenin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, Esmeralda, I'm just plain ugly to-night," said the girl.
"Don't pay any attention to me&mdash;that's a dear."</p>

<p>"Yasm, honey; now you-all go right to sleep. Yo' nerves am all
on aidge. What wif all dese ripotamuses an' man eaten geniuses
dat Marse Philander been a tellin' about&mdash;laws, it ain't no
wonder we all get nervous prosecution."</p>

<p>Jane Porter crossed the little room, laughing, and kissing the
faithful old black cheek, bid Esmeralda good night.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch23" name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; BROTHER MEN</h2>

<p class="first"> WHEN D'Arnot regained consciousness, he found
himself lying upon a bed of soft ferns and grasses beneath a
little "A" shaped shelter of boughs.</p>

<p>At his feet an opening looked out upon a green sward, and at a
little distance beyond was the dense wall of jungle and
forest.</p>

<p>He was very lame and sore and weak, and as full consciousness
returned he felt the sharp torture of many cruel wounds, and the
dull aching of every bone and muscle in his body as a result of
the hideous beating he had received.</p>

<p>Even the turning of his head caused him such excruciating
agony that he lay still with closed eyes for a long time.</p>

<p>He tried to piece out the details of his adventure prior to
the time he lost consciousness to see if they would explain his
present whereabouts&mdash;he wondered if he were among friends or
foes.</p>

<p>At length he recollected the whole hideous scene at the stake,
and finally recalled the strange white figure in whose arms he
had sunk into oblivion.</p>

<p>D'Arnot wondered what fate lay in store for him now. He could
neither see nor hear any signs of life about him.</p>

<p>The incessant hum of the jungle&mdash;the rustling of millions
of leaves&mdash;the buzz of insects&mdash;the voices of the birds
and monkeys seemed blended into a strangely soothing purr, as
though he lay apart, far from the myriad life whose sounds came
to him only as a blurred echo.</p>

<p>At length he fell in a quiet slumber, nor did he awake again
until afternoon.</p>

<p>Once more he experienced the strange sense of utter
bewilderment that had marked his earlier awakening, but soon he
recalled the recent past, and looking through the opening at his
feet he saw the figure of a man squatting on his haunches.</p>

<p>The broad, muscular back was turned toward him, but, tanned
though it was, D'Arnot saw that it was the back of a white man,
and he thanked his God.</p>

<p>The Frenchman called faintly. The man turned, and, rising,
came toward the shelter. His face was very handsome&mdash;the
handsomest, thought D'Arnot, that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Stooping, he crawled into the shelter beside the wounded
officer, and placed a cool hand upon his forehead.</p>

<p>D'Arnot spoke to him in French, but the man only shook his
head&mdash;sadly, it seemed to the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Then D'Arnot tried English, but still the man shook his head.
Italian, Spanish and German brought similar discouragement.</p>

<p>D'Arnot knew a few words of Norwegian, Russian, Greek, and
also had a smattering of the language of one of the West Coast
negro tribes&mdash;the man denied them all.</p>

<p>After examining D'Arnot's wounds the man left the shelter and
disappeared. In half an hour he was back with fruit and a hollow
gourd-like vegetable filled with water.</p>

<p>D'Arnot drank and ate a little. He was surprised that he had
no fever. Again he tried to converse with his strange nurse, but
the attempt was useless.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man hastened from the shelter only to return a
few minutes later with several pieces of bark and&mdash;wonder of
wonders&mdash;a lead pencil.</p>

<p>Squatting beside D'Arnot he wrote for a minute on the smooth
inner surface of the bark; then he handed it to the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was astonished to see, in plain print-like characters,
a message in English:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I am Tarzan of the Apes. Who
are you? Can you read this language?</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>D'Arnot seized the pencil&mdash;then he stopped. This strange
man wrote English&mdash;evidently he was an Englishman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said D'Arnot, "I read English. I speak it also. Now we
may talk. First let me thank you for all that you have done for
me."</p>

<p>The man only shook his head and pointed to the pencil and the
bark.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> cried D'Arnot. "If you are English why is
it then that you cannot speak English?"</p>

<p>And then in a flash it came to him&mdash;the man was a mute,
possibly a deaf mute.</p>

<p>So D'Arnot wrote a message on the bark, in English.</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I am Paul D'Arnot, Lieutenant
in the navy of France. I thank you for what you have done for me.
You have saved my life, and all that I have is yours. May I ask
how it is that one who writes English does not speak
it?</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>Tarzan's reply filled D'Arnot with still greater wonder:</p>
<BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I speak only the language of
my tribe&mdash;the great apes who were Kerchak's; and a little of
the languages of Tantor, the elephant, and Numa, the lion, and of
the other folks of the jungle I understand. With a human being I
have never spoken, except once with Jane Porter, by signs. This
is the first time I have spoken with another of my kind through
written words.</SPAN></p>

<p><BR> D'Arnot was mystified. It seemed incredible that there
lived upon earth a full-grown man who had never spoken with a
fellow man, and still more preposterous that such a one could
read and write.</p>

<p>He looked again at Tarzan's message&mdash;"except once, with
Jane Porter." That was the American girl who had been carried
into the jungle by a gorilla.</p>

<p>A sudden light commenced to dawn on D'Arnot&mdash;this then
was the "gorilla." He seized the pencil and wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Where is Jane
Porter?</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>And Tarzan replied, below:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Back with her people in the
cabin of Tarzan of the Apes.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">She is not dead then? Where
was she? What happened to her?</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">She is not dead. She was
taken by Terkoz to be his wife; but Tarzan of the Apes took her
away from Terkoz and killed him before he could harm her. None in
all the jungle may face Tarzan of the Apes in battle, and live. I
am Tarzan of the Apes, mighty fighter.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>D'Arnot wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I am glad she is safe. It
pains me to write, I will rest a while.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>And then Tarzan:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Yes, rest. When you are well
I shall take you back to your people.</SPAN></p>

<p><BR> For many days D'Arnot lay upon his bed of soft ferns. The
second day a fever had come and D'Arnot thought that it meant
infection and he knew that he would die.</p>

<p>An idea came to him. He wondered why he had not thought of it
before.</p>

<p>He called Tarzan and indicated by signs that he would write,
and when Tarzan had fetched the bark and pencil, D'Arnot
wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Can you go to my people and
lead them here? I will write a message that you may take to them,
and they will follow you.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>Tarzan shook his head and taking the bark, wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">I had thought of
that&mdash;the first day; but I dared not. The great apes come
often to this spot, and if they found you here, wounded and
alone, they would kill you.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>D'Arnot turned on his side and closed his eyes. He did not
wish to die; but he felt that he was going, for the fever was
mounting higher and higher. That night he lost consciousness.</p>

<p><BR> For three days he was in delirium, and Tarzan sat beside
him and bathed his head and hands and washed his wounds.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the fever broke as suddenly as it had come,
but it left D'Arnot a shadow of his former self, and very weak.
Tarzan had to lift him that he might drink from the gourd.</p>

<p>The fever had not been the result of infection, as D'Arnot had
thought, but one of those that commonly attack whites in the
jungles of Africa, and either kill or leave them as suddenly as
D'Arnot's had left him.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Two days after, D'Arnot was tottering about the amphitheater,
Tarzan's strong arm about him to keep him from falling.</p>

<p>They sat beneath the shade of a great tree, and Tarzan found
some smooth bark that they might converse.</p>

<p>D'Arnot wrote the first message:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">What can I do to repay you
for all that you have done for me?</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>And Tarzan, in reply:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Teach me to speak the
language of men.</SPAN></p>

<p><BR> And so D'Arnot commenced at once, pointing out familiar
objects and repeating their names in French, for he thought that
it would be easier to teach this man his own language, since he
understood it himself best of all.</p>

<p>It meant nothing to Tarzan, of course, for he could not tell
one language from another, so when he pointed to the word man
which he had printed upon a piece of bark he learned from D'Arnot
that it was pronounced <i>homme,</i> and in the same way he was
taught to pronounce ape, <i>singe</i>, and tree,
<i>arbre</i>.</p>

<p>He was a most eager student, and in two more days had mastered
so much French that he could speak little sentences such as:
"That is a tree," "this is grass," "I am hungry," and the like,
but D'Arnot found that it was difficult to teach him the French
construction upon a foundation of English.</p>

<p>The Frenchman wrote little lessons for him in English and had
Tarzan repeat them in French, but as a literal translation was
usually very poor French Tarzan was often confused.</p>

<p>D'Arnot realized now that he had made a mistake, but it seemed
too late to go back and do it all over again and force Tarzan to
unlearn all that he had learned, especially as they were rapidly
approaching a point where they would be able to converse.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On the third day after the fever broke Tarzan wrote a message
asking D'Arnot if he felt strong enough to be carried back to the
cabin. Tarzan was as anxious to go as D'Arnot, for he longed to
see Jane Porter again.</p>

<p>It had been hard for him to remain with the Frenchman all
these days for that very reason, and that he had unselfishly done
so spoke more glowingly for his nobility of character than even
did his rescuing of the French officer from Mbonga's
clutches.</p>

<p>D'Arnot, only too willing to attempt the journey, wrote:</p>
<BR>

<p class="quote"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">But you cannot carry me all
the distance through this tangled forest.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>Tarzan laughed.</p>

<p><i>"Mais oui,"</i> he said, and D'Arnot laughed aloud to hear
the phrase that he used so often glide from Tarzan's tongue.</p>

<p>So they set out, D'Arnot marveling as had Clayton and Jane
Porter at the wondrous strength and agility of the ape-man.</p>

<p>Mid-afternoon brought them to the clearing, and as Tarzan
dropped to earth from the branches of the last tree his heart
leaped and bounded against his ribs in anticipation of seeing
Jane Porter so soon again.</p>

<p>No one was in sight without the cabin, and D'Arnot was
perplexed to note that neither the cruiser nor the <i>Arrow</i>
was at anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>An atmosphere of loneliness pervaded the spot, which caught
suddenly at both men as they strode toward the cabin.</p>

<p>Neither spoke, yet both knew before they opened the closed
door what they would find beyond.</p>

<p>Tarzan lifted the latch and pushed the great door in upon its
wooden hinges. It was as they had feared. The cabin was
deserted.</p>

<p>The men turned and looked at one another. D'Arnot knew that
his people thought him dead; but Tarzan thought only of the woman
who had kissed him in love and now had fled from him while he was
serving one of her people.</p>

<p>A great bitterness rose in his heart. He would go away, far
into the jungle and join his tribe. Never would he see one of his
own kind again; nor could he bear the thought of returning to the
cabin. He would leave that forever behind him with the great
hopes he had nursed there of finding his own race and becoming a
man among men.</p>

<p>And the Frenchman? D'Arnot? What of him? He could get along as
Tarzan had. Tarzan did not want to see him any more. He wanted to get
away from everything that might remind him of Jane Porter.</p>

<p>As Tarzan stood upon the threshold, brooding, D'Arnot had
entered the cabin. Many comforts he saw that had been left
behind. He recognized numerous articles from the cruiser&mdash;a
camp oven, some kitchen utensils, a rifle and many rounds of
ammunition, canned foods, blankets, two chairs and a cot&mdash;and several books and periodicals, mostly American.</p>

<p>"They must intend returning," thought D'Arnot.</p>

<p>He walked over to the table that John Clayton had built so
many years before to serve as a desk, and on it he saw two notes
addressed to Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>One was in a strong masculine hand and was unsealed. The
other, in a woman's hand, was sealed.</p>

<p>"Here are two messages for you, Tarzan of the Apes," cried
D'Arnot, turning toward the door; but his companion was not
there.</p>

<p>D'Arnot walked to the door and looked out. Tarzan was nowhere
in sight. He called aloud but there was no response.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> exclaimed D'Arnot, "he has left me. I feel
it. He has gone back into his jungle and left me here alone."</p>

<p>And then he remembered the look on Tarzan's face when they had
discovered that the cabin was empty&mdash;such a look as the
hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has wantonly
brought down.</p>

<p>The man had been hard hit&mdash;D'Arnot realized it
now&mdash;but why? He could not understand.</p>

<p>The Frenchman looked about him. The loneliness and the horror
of the place commenced to get on his nerves&mdash;already
weakened by the ordeal of suffering and sickness he had passed
through.</p>

<p>To be left here alone beside this awful jungle&mdash;never to
hear a human voice or see a human face&mdash;in constant dread of
savage beasts and more terribly savage men&mdash;a prey to
solitude and hopelessness. It was awful.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>And far to the east Tarzan of the Apes was speeding through
the middle terrace back to his tribe. Never had he traveled with
such reckless speed. He felt that he was running away from
himself&mdash;that by hurtling through the forest like a
frightened squirrel he was escaping from his own thoughts. But no
matter how fast he went he found them always with him.</p>

<p>He passed above the sinuous body of Sabor, the lioness, going
in the opposite direction; toward the cabin, thought Tarzan.</p>

<p>What could D'Arnot do against Sabor&mdash;or if Bolgani, the
gorilla, should come upon him&mdash;or Numa, the lion, or cruel
Sheeta?</p>

<p>Tarzan paused in his flight.</p>

<p>"What are you, Tarzan?" he asked aloud. "An ape or a man?"</p>

<p>"If you are an ape you will do as the apes would
do&mdash;leave one of your kind to die in the jungle if it suited
your whim to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>"If you are a man, you will return to protect your kind. You
will not run away from one of your own people, because one of
them has run away from you."</p>

<p><br> D'Arnot closed the cabin door. He was very nervous. Even
brave men, and D'Arnot was a brave man, are sometimes frightened
by solitude.</p>

<p>He loaded one of the rifles and placed it within easy reach.
Then he went to the desk and took up the unsealed letter
addressed to Tarzan.</p>

<p>Possibly it contained word that his people had but left the
beach temporarily. He felt that it would be no breach of ethics
to read this letter, so he took the enclosure from the envelope
and read:</p> <BR>

<p class="letter">To <SPAN CLASS="smcap">Tarzan of the
Apes</SPAN>:

<p class="letter">We thank you for the use of your cabin, and are
sorry that you did not permit us the pleasure of seeing and
thanking you in person.

<p class="letter">We have harmed nothing, but have left many
things for you which may add to your comfort and safety here in
your lonely home.

<p class="letter">If you know the strange white man who saved our
lives so many times, and brought us food, and if you can converse
with him, thank him, also, for his kindness.

<p class="letter">We sail within the hour, never to return; but
we wish you and that other jungle friend to know that we shall
always thank you for what you did for strangers on your shore,
and that we should have done infinitely more to reward you both
had you given us the opportunity.

<p class="letter">Very respectfully,

<p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Wm. Cecil
Clayton</SPAN>.</p>

<BR>



<p>"'Never to return,'" muttered D'Arnot, and threw himself face
downward upon the cot.</p>

<p>An hour later he started up, listening. Something was at the
door trying to enter.</p>

<p>D'Arnot reached for the loaded rifle and placed it to his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and the interior of the cabin was very dark;
but the man could see the latch moving from its place.</p>

<p>He felt his hair rising upon his scalp.</p>

<p>Gently the door opened until a thin crack showed something
standing just without.</p>

<p>D'Arnot sighted along the blue barrel at the crack of the
door&mdash;and then he pulled the trigger.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch24" name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; LOST TREASURE</h2>

<p class="first"> WHEN the expedition returned, following their
fruitless endeavor to succor D'Arnot, Captain Dufranne was
anxious to steam away as quickly as possible, and all save Jane
Porter had acquiesced.</p>

<p>"No," she said, determinedly, "I shall not go, nor should you,
for there are two friends in that jungle who will come out of it
some day expecting to find us awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Your officer, Captain Dufranne, is one of them, and the
forest man who has saved the lives of every member of my father's
party is the other.</p>

<p>"He left me at the edge of the jungle two days ago to hasten
to the aid of my father and Mr. Clayton, as he thought, and he
has stayed to rescue Lieutenant D'Arnot; of that you may be
sure.</p>

<p>"Had he been too late to be of service to the lieutenant he
would have been back before now&mdash;the fact that he is not
back is sufficient proof to me that he is delayed because
Lieutenant D'Arnot is wounded, or he has had to follow his
captors further than the village which your sailors
attacked."</p>

<p>"But poor D'Arnot's uniform and all his belongings were found
in that village, Miss Porter," argued the captain, "and the
natives showed great excitement when questioned as to the white
man's fate."</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain, but they did not admit that he was dead, and as
for his clothes and accoutrements being in their
possession&mdash;why more civilized peoples than these poor
savage negroes strip their prisoners of every article of value
whether they intend killing them or not.</p>

<p>"Even the soldiers of my own dear South looted not only the
living but the dead. It is strong circumstantial evidence, I will
admit, but it is not positive proof."</p>

<p>"Possibly your forest man, himself, was captured or killed by
the savages," suggested Captain Dufranne.</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"You do not know him," she replied, a little thrill of pride
setting her nerves a-tingle at the thought that she spoke of her
own.</p>

<p>"I admit that he would be worth waiting for, this super-man of
yours," laughed the captain. "I most certainly should like to see
him."</p>

<p>"Then wait for him, my dear captain," urged the girl, "for I
intend doing so."</p>

<p>The Frenchman would have been a very much surprised man could
he have interpreted the true meaning of the girl's words.</p>

<p>They had been walking from the beach toward the cabin as they
talked, and now they joined a little group sitting on camp stools
in the shade of a great tree beside the cabin.</p>

<p>Professor Porter was there, and Mr. Philander and Clayton,
with Lieutenant Charpentier and two of his brother officers,
while Esmeralda hovered in the background, ever and anon
venturing opinions and comments with the freedom of an old and
much-indulged family servant.</p>

<p>The officers arose and saluted as their superior approached,
and Clayton surrendered his camp stool to Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"We were just discussing poor Paul's fate," said Captain
Dufranne. "Miss Porter insists that we have no absolute proof of
his death&mdash;nor have we. And on the other hand she maintains
that the continued absence of your omnipotent jungle friend
indicates that D'Arnot is still in need of his services, either
because he is wounded, or still is a prisoner in a more distant
native village."</p>

<p>"It has been suggested," ventured Lieutenant Charpentier,
"that the wild man may have been a member of the tribe of blacks
who attacked our party&mdash;that he was hastening to aid
<i>them</i>&mdash;his own people."</p>

<p>Jane Porter shot a quick glance at Clayton.</p>

<p>"It seems vastly more reasonable," said Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"I do not agree with you," objected Mr. Philander. "He had
ample opportunity to harm us himself, or to lead his people
against us. Instead, during our long residence here, he has been
uniformly consistent in his role of protector and provider."</p>

<p>"That is true," interjected Clayton, "yet we must not overlook
the fact that except for himself the only human beings within
hundreds of miles are savage cannibals. He was armed precisely as
are they, which indicates that he has maintained relations of
some nature with them, and the fact that he is but one against
possibly thousands suggests that these relations could scarcely
have been other than friendly."</p>

<p>"It seems improbable then that he is not connected with them,"
remarked the captain; "possibly a member of this tribe."</p>

<p>"Or," added another of the officers, "that otherwise he could
even have lived a sufficient length of time among the savage
denizens of the jungle, brute and human, to have become
proficient in woodcraft, or in the use of African weapons."</p>

<p>"You are judging him according to your own standards,
gentlemen," said Jane Porter. "An ordinary white man such as any
of you&mdash;pardon me, I did not mean just that&mdash;rather, a
white man above the ordinary in physique and intelligence could
never, I grant you, have lived a year alone and naked in this
tropical jungle; but this man not only surpasses the average
white man in strength and agility, but so far transcends our
trained athletes and 'strong men' as they surpass a day-old babe;
and his courage and ferocity in battle are those of the wild
beast."</p>

<p>"He has certainly won a loyal champion, Miss Porter," said
Captain Dufranne, laughing. "I am sure that there be none of us
here but would willingly face death a hundred times in its most
terrifying forms to deserve the tributes of one even half so
loyal&mdash;or so beautiful."</p>

<p>"You would not wonder that I defend him," said the girl,
"could you have seen him as I saw him, battling in my behalf with
that huge hairy brute.</p>

<p>"Could you have seen him charge the monster as a bull might
charge a grizzly&mdash;absolutely without sign of fear or
hesitation&mdash;you would have believed him more than human.</p>

<p>"Could you have seen those mighty muscles knotting under the
brown skin&mdash;could you have seen them force back those awful
fangs&mdash;you too would have thought him invincible.</p>

<p>"And could you have seen the chivalrous treatment which he
accorded a strange girl of a strange race, you would feel the
same absolute confidence in him that I feel."</p>

<p>"You have won your suit, my fair pleader," cried the captain.
"This court finds the defendant not guilty, and the cruiser
shall wait a few days longer that he may have an opportunity to
come and thank the divine Portia."</p>

<p>"Fo' de Lawd's sake honey," cried Esmeralda. "You all doan
mean to tell <i>me</i> dat youse a-goin' to stay right yere in
dis yere lan' of carnivable animals when you all done got de
oppahtunity to escapade on dat crosier? Doan yo' tell me
<i>dat</i>, honey."</p>

<p>"Why, Esmeralda! You should be ashamed of yourself," cried
Jane Porter. "Is this any way to show your gratitude to the man
who saved your life twice?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Jane, das all jes' as yo' say; but dat dere fores'
lawd never did save us to stay yere. He done save us so we all
could get <i>away</i> from yere. Ah expec' he be mighty peevish
when he fin' we ain't got no mo' sense 'n to stay right yere
after he done give us de chanct to get away.</p>

<p>"Ah hoped Ah'd never have to sleep in dis yere geological
garden another night and listen to all dem lonesome noises dat
come out of dat jumble after dark."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you a bit, Esmeralda," said Clayton, "and you
certainly did hit it off right when you called them 'lonesome'
noises. I never have been able to find the right word for them
but that's it, don't you know, lonesome noises."</p>

<p>"You and Esmeralda had better go and live on the cruiser,"
said Jane Porter, in fine scorn. "What would you think if you
<i>had</i> to live all of your life in that jungle as our forest
man has done?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'd be a blooming bounder as a wild man," laughed
Clayton, ruefully. "Those noises at night make the hair on my
head bristle. I suppose that I should be ashamed to admit it, but
it's the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Lieutenant Charpentier. "I
never thought much about fear and that sort of thing&mdash;never
tried to determine whether I was a coward or a brave man; but the
other night as we lay in the jungle there after poor D'Arnot was
taken, and those jungle noises rose and fell around us I began to
think that I was a coward indeed. It was not the roaring and
growling of the big beasts that affected me so much as it was the
stealthy noises&mdash;the ones that you heard suddenly close by
and then listened vainly for a repetition of&mdash;the
unaccountable sounds as of a great body moving almost
noiselessly, and the knowledge that you didn't <i>know</i> how
close it was, or whether it were creeping closer after you ceased
to hear it? It was those noises&mdash;and the eyes.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!</i> I shall see them in the dark forever&mdash;the eyes that you see, and those that you don't see, but feel;
ah, they are the worst."</p>

<p>All were silent for a moment, and then Jane Porter spoke.</p>

<p>"And he is out there," she said, in an awe-hushed whisper.
"Those eyes will be glaring at him to-night, and at your comrade
Lieutenant D'Arnot. Can you leave them, gentlemen, without at
least rendering them the passive succor which remaining here a
few days longer might insure them?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, child," said Professor Porter. "Captain Dufranne is
willing to remain, and for my part I am perfectly willing,
perfectly willing&mdash;as I always have been&mdash;to humor your
childish whims."</p>

<p>"We can utilize the morrow in recovering the chest,
Professor," suggested Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so, Mr. Philander, I had almost forgotten the
treasure," exclaimed Professor Porter. "Possibly we can borrow
some men from Captain Dufranne to assist us, and one of the
prisoners to point out the location of the chest."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, my dear Professor, we are all yours to
command," said the captain.</p>

<p>And so it was arranged that on the next day Lieutenant
Charpentier was to take a detail of ten men, and one of the
mutineers of the <i>Arrow</i> as a guide, and unearth the
treasure; and that the cruiser would remain for a full week in
the little harbor. At the end of that time it was to be assumed
that D'Arnot was truly dead, and that the forest man would not
return while they remained. Then the two vessels were to leave
with all the party.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Professor Porter did not accompany the treasure-seekers on the
following day, but when he saw them returning empty-handed toward
noon, he hastened forward to meet them&mdash;his usual
preoccupied indifference entirely vanished, and in its place a
nervous and excited manner.</p>

<p>"Where is the treasure?" he cried to Clayton, while yet a
hundred feet separated them.</p>

<p>Clayton shook his head.</p>

<p>"Gone," he said, as he neared the professor.</p>

<p>"Gone! It cannot be. Who could have taken it?" cried Professor
Porter.</p>

<p>"God only knows, Professor," replied Clayton. "We might have
thought the fellow who guided us was lying about the location,
but his surprise and consternation on finding no chest beneath
the body of the murdered Snipes were too real to be feigned.</p>

<p>"And then our spades showed us that <i>something</i> had been
buried beneath the corpse, for a hole had been there and it had
been filled with loose earth."</p>

<p>"But who could have taken it?" repeated Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"Suspicion might naturally fall on the men of the cruiser,"
said Lieutenant Charpentier, "but for the fact that sub-lieutenant Janviers here assures me that no men have had shore
leave&mdash;that none has been on shore since we anchored here
except under command of an officer.</p>

<p>"I do not know that you would suspect our men, but I am glad
that there is now no chance for suspicion to fall on them," he
concluded.</p>

<p>"It would never have occurred to me to suspect the men to whom
we owe so much," replied Professor Porter, graciously. "I would
as soon suspect my dear Clayton here, or Mr. Philander."</p>

<p>The Frenchmen smiled, both officers and sailors. It was plain
to see that a burden had been lifted from their minds.</p>

<p>"The treasure has been gone some time," continued Clayton. "In
fact the body fell apart as we lifted it, which indicates that
whoever removed the treasure did so while the corpse was still
fresh, for it was intact when we first uncovered it."</p>

<p>"There must have been several in the party," said Jane Porter,
who had joined them. "You remember that it took four men to carry
it."</p>

<p>"By jove!" cried Clayton. "That's right. It must have been
done by a party of blacks. Probably one of them saw the men bury
the chest and then returned immediately after with a party of his
friends, and carried it off."</p>

<p>"Speculation is futile," said Professor Porter, sadly. "The
chest is gone. We shall never see it anymore, nor the treasure that
was in it."</p>

<p>Only Jane Porter knew what the loss meant to her father, and
none there knew what it meant to her.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Six days later Captain Dufranne announced that they would sail
early on the morrow.</p>

<p>Jane Porter would have begged for a further reprieve, had it
not been that she too had began to believe that her forest lover
would return no more.</p>

<p>In spite of herself she began to entertain doubts and fears.
The reasonableness of the arguments of these disinterested French
officers commenced to convince her against her will.</p>

<p>That he was a cannibal she would not believe, but that he was
an adopted member of some savage tribe at length seemed possible
to her.</p>

<p>She would not admit that he could be dead. It was impossible
to believe that that perfect body, so filled with triumphant
life, could ever cease to harbor the vital spark&mdash;as soon
believe that immortality were dust.</p>

<p>As Jane Porter permitted herself to harbor these thoughts,
others equally unwelcome forced themselves upon her.</p>

<p>If he belonged to some savage tribe he had a savage
wife&mdash;a dozen of them perhaps&mdash;and wild, half-caste
children. The girl shuddered, and when they told her that the
cruiser would sail on the morrow she was almost glad.</p>

<p>It was she, though, who suggested that arms, ammunition,
supplies and comforts be left behind in the cabin, ostensibly for
that intangible personality who had signed himself Tarzan of the
Apes, and for D'Arnot should he still be living, but really, she
hoped, for her forest god&mdash;even though his feet should prove
of clay.</p>

<p>And at the last minute she left a message for him, to be
transmitted by Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>Jane Porter was the last to leave the cabin, returning on some
trivial pretext, after the others had started for the boat.</p>

<p>She kneeled down beside the bed in which she had spent so many
nights, and offered up a prayer for the safety of her primeval
man, and crushing his locket to her lips she murmured:</p>

<p>"I love you, and because I love you I believe in you. But if I
did not believe, still should I love. May God have pity on my
soul that I should acknowledge it. Had you come back for me, and
there had been no other way, I would have gone into the jungle
with you&mdash;forever."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch25" name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE OUTPOST OF THE
WORLD</h2>

<p class="first"> WITH the report of his gun D'Arnot saw the door
fly open and the figure of a man pitch headlong within onto the
cabin floor.</p>

<p>The Frenchman in his panic raised his gun to fire again into
the prostrate form, but suddenly in the half dusk of the open
door he saw that the man was white and in another instant
realized that he had shot his friend and protector, Tarzan of the
Apes.</p>

<p>With a cry of anguish D'Arnot sprang to the ape-man's side,
and kneeling, lifted the black head in his arms&mdash;calling
Tarzan's name aloud.</p>

<p>There was no response, and then D'Arnot placed his ear above
the man's heart. To his joy he heard its steady beating
beneath.</p>

<p>Carefully he lifted Tarzan to the cot, and then, after closing
and bolting the door, he lighted one of the lamps and examined
the wound.</p>

<p>The bullet had struck a glancing blow upon the skull. There
was an ugly flesh wound, but no signs of a fracture of the
skull.</p>

<p>D'Arnot breathed a sigh of relief, and went about bathing the
blood from Tarzan's face.</p>

<p>Soon the cool water revived him, and presently he opened his
eyes to look in questioning surprise at D'Arnot.</p>

<p>The latter had bound the wound with pieces of cloth, and as he
saw that Tarzan had regained consciousness he arose and going to
the table wrote a message, which he handed to the ape-man,
explaining the terrible mistake he had made and how thankful he
was that the wound was not more serious.</p>

<p>Tarzan, after reading the message, sat on the edge of the
couch and laughed.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said in French, and then, his vocabulary
failing him, he wrote:</p> <BR>

<p class="note"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">You should have seen what
Bolgani did to me, and Kerchak, and Terkoz, before I killed
them&mdash;then you would laugh at such a little
scratch.</SPAN></p> <BR>

<p>D'Arnot handed Tarzan the two messages that had been left for
him.</p>

<p>Tarzan read the first one through with a look of sorrow on his
face. The second one he turned over and over, searching for an
opening&mdash;he had never seen a sealed envelope before. At
length he handed it to D'Arnot.</p>

<p>The Frenchman had been watching him, and knew that Tarzan was
puzzled over the envelope. How strange it seemed that to a full-grown white man an envelope was a mystery. D'Arnot opened it and
handed the letter back to Tarzan.</p>

<p>Sitting on a camp stool the ape-man spread the written sheet
before him and read:</p> <BR>


<P class="letter">To <SPAN CLASS="smcap">Tarzan of the
Apes</SPAN>:</P>

<P class="letter">Before I leave let me add my thanks to those of
Mr. Clayton for the kindness you have shown in permitting us the
use of your cabin.</P>

<P class="letter">That you never came to make friends with us has
been a great regret to us. We should have liked so much to have
seen and thanked our host.</P>

<P class="letter">There is another I should like to thank also,
but he did not come back, though I cannot believe that he is
dead.</P>

<P class="letter">I do not know his name. He is the great white
giant who wore the diamond locket upon his breast.</P>

<P class="letter">If you know him and can speak his language
carry my thanks to him, and tell him that I waited seven days for
him to return.</P>

<P class="letter">Tell him, also, that in my home in America, in
the city of Baltimore, there will always be a welcome for him if
he cares to come.</P>

<P class="letter">I found a note you wrote me lying among the
leaves beneath a tree near the cabin. I do not know how you
learned to love me, who have never spoken to me, and I am very
sorry if it is true, for I have already given my heart to
another.</P>

<P class="letter">But know that I am always your friend,</P>

<P class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Jane Porter</SPAN>.</P>

<p><BR> Tarzan sat with gaze fixed upon the floor for nearly an
hour. It was evident to him from the notes that they did not know
that he and Tarzan of the Apes were one and the same.</p>

<p>"I have given my heart to another," he repeated over and over
again to himself.</p>

<p>Then she did not love him! How could she have pretended love,
and raised him to such a pinnacle of hope only to cast him down
to such utter depths of despair!</p>

<p>Maybe her kisses were only signs of friendship. How did he
know, who knew nothing of the customs of human beings?</p>

<p>Suddenly he arose, and, bidding D'Arnot good night as he had
learned to do, threw himself upon the couch of ferns that had
been Jane Porter's.</p>

<p>D'Arnot extinguished the lamp, and lay down upon the cot.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>For a week they did little but rest; D'Arnot coaching Tarzan
in French. At the end of that time the two men could converse
quite easily.</p>

<p>One night, as they were sitting within the cabin before
retiring, Tarzan turned to D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Where is America?" he said.</p>

<p>D'Arnot pointed toward the northwest.</p>

<p>"Many thousands of miles across the ocean," he replied.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"I am going there."</p>

<p>D'Arnot shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, my friend," he said.</p>

<p>Tarzan rose, and, going to one of the cupboards, returned with
a well-thumbed geography book.</p>

<p>Turning to a map of the world, he said:</p>

<p>"I have never quite understood all this; explain it to me,
please."</p>

<p>When D'Arnot had done so, showing him that the blue
represented all the water on the earth, and the bits of other
colors the continents and islands, Tarzan asked him to point out
the spot where they now were.</p>

<p>D'Arnot did so.</p>

<p>"Now point out America," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>And as D'Arnot placed his finger upon North America, Tarzan
smiled and laid his palm upon the page, spanning the great ocean
that lay between the two continents.</p>

<p>"You see it is not so very far," he said; "scarce the width of
my hand."</p>

<p>D'Arnot laughed. How could he make the man understand?</p>

<p>Then he took a pencil and made a tiny point upon the shore of
Africa.</p>

<p>"This little mark," he said, "is many times larger upon this
map than your cabin is upon the earth. Do you see now how very
far it is?"</p>

<p>Tarzan thought for a long time.</p>

<p>"Do any white men live in Africa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where are the nearest?"</p>

<p>D'Arnot pointed out a spot on the shore just north of
them.</p>

<p>"So close?" asked Tarzan, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," said D'Arnot; "but it is not close."</p>

<p>"Have they big boats to cross the ocean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We shall go there tomorrow," announced Tarzan.</p>

<p>Again D'Arnot smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is too far. We should die long before we reached
them."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to stay here then forever?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No," said D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Then we shall start tomorrow. I do not like it here any longer. I
should rather die than remain here."</p>

<p>"Well," answered D'Arnot, with a shrug, "I do not know, my
friend, but that I also would rather die than remain here. If you
go, I shall go with you."</p>

<p>"It is settled then," said Tarzan. "I shall start for America
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"How will you get to America without money?" asked
D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"What is money?" inquired Tarzan.</p>

<p>It took a long time to make him understand even
imperfectly.</p>

<p>"How do men get money?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"They work for it."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will work for it, then."</p>

<p>"No, my friend," returned D'Arnot, "you need not worry about
money, nor need you work for it. I have enough for
two&mdash;enough for twenty. Much more than is good for one man,
and you shall have all you need if ever we reach
civilization."</p>

<p>So on the following day they started north along the shore.
Each man carrying a rifle and ammunition, beside bedding and some
food and cooking utensils.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to Tarzan a most useless encumbrance, so he
threw his away.</p>

<p>"But you must learn to eat cooked food, my friend,"
remonstrated D'Arnot. "No civilized men eat raw flesh."</p>

<p>"There will be time enough when I reach civilization," said
Tarzan. "I do not like the things and they only spoil the taste
of good meat."</p>

<p><BR> For a month they traveled north. Sometimes finding food
in plenty and again going hungry for days.</p>

<p>They saw no signs of natives nor were they molested by wild
beasts. Their journey was a miracle of ease.</p>

<p>Tarzan asked questions and learned rapidly. D'Arnot taught him
many of the refinements of civilization&mdash;even to the use of
knife and fork; but sometimes Tarzan would drop them in disgust
and grasp his food in his strong brown hands, tearing it with his
molars like a wild beast.</p>

<p>Then D'Arnot would expostulate with him, saying:</p>

<p>"You must not eat like a brute, Tarzan, while I am trying to
make a gentleman of you. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Gentlemen do not
thus&mdash;it is terrible."</p>

<p>Tarzan would grin sheepishly and pick up his knife and fork
again, but at heart he hated them.</p>

<p>On the journey he told D'Arnot about the great chest he had
seen the sailors bury; of how he had dug it up and carried it to
the gathering place of the apes and buried it there.</p>

<p>"It must be the treasure chest of Professor Porter," said
D'Arnot. "It is too bad, but of course you did not know."</p>

<p>Then Tarzan recalled the letter written by Jane Porter to her
friend&mdash;the one he had stolen when they first came to his
cabin, and now he knew what was in the chest and what it meant to
Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we shall go back after it," he announced to
D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Go back?" exclaimed D'Arnot. "But, my dear fellow, we have
now been three weeks upon the march. It would require three more
to return to the treasure, and then, with that enormous weight
which required, you say, four sailors to carry, it would be
months before we had again reached this spot."</p>

<p>"It must be done, my friend," insisted Tarzan. "You may go on
toward civilization, and I will return for the treasure. I can go
very much faster alone."</p>

<p>"I have a better plan, Tarzan," exclaimed D'Arnot. "We shall
go on together to the nearest settlement, and there we will
charter a boat and sail back down the coast for the treasure and
so transport it easily.</p>

<p>"That will be safer and quicker and also not require us to be
separated. What do you think of that plan?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tarzan. "The treasure will be there whenever
we go for it; and while I could fetch it now, and catch up with
you in a moon or two, I shall feel safer for you to know that you
are not alone on the trail.</p>

<p>"When I see how helpless you are, D'Arnot, I often wonder how
the human race has escaped annihilation all these ages which you
tell me about. Why, Sabor, single handed, could exterminate a
thousand of you."</p>

<p>D'Arnot laughed.</p>

<p>"You will think more highly of your genus when you have seen
its armies and navies, its great cities, and its mighty
engineering works. Then you will realize that it is mind, and not
muscle, that makes the human animal greater than the mighty
beasts of your jungle.</p>

<p>"Alone and unarmed, a single man is no match for any of the
larger beasts; but if ten men were together, they would combine
their wits and their muscles against their savage enemies, while
the beasts, being unable to reason, would never think of
combining against the men.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, Tarzan of the Apes, how long would you have lasted
in the savage wilderness?"</p>

<p>"You are right, D'Arnot," replied Tarzan, "for if Kerchak had
come to Tublat's aid that night at the Dum-Dum, there would have
been an end of me. But Kerchak could never think far enough ahead
to take advantage of any such opportunity.</p>

<p>"Even Kala, my mother, could never plan ahead. She simply ate
what she needed when she needed it, and if the supply was very
scarce, even though she found plenty for several meals, she would
never gather any ahead.</p>

<p>"I remember that she used to think it very silly of me to
burden myself with extra food upon the march, though she was
quite glad to eat it with me, if the way chanced to be barren of
sustenance."</p>

<p>"Then you knew your mother, Tarzan?" asked D'Arnot, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. She was a great, fine ape, larger than I, and weighing
twice as much."</p>

<p>"And your father?" asked D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"I did not know him. Kala told me he was a white ape, and
hairless like myself. I know now that he must have been a white
man."</p>

<p>D'Arnot looked long and earnestly at his companion.</p>

<p>"Tarzan," he said at length, "it is impossible that the ape,
Kala, was your mother. If such a thing can be, which I doubt, you
would have inherited some of the characteristics of the ape, but
you have not&mdash;you are pure man, and, I should say, the
offspring of highly bred and intelligent parents.</p>

<p>"Have you not the slightest clue to your past?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No writings in the cabin that might have told something of
the lives of its original inmates?"</p>

<p>"I have read everything that was in the cabin with the
exception of one book which I know now to be written in a
language other than English. Possibly you can read it."</p>

<p>Tarzan fished the little black diary from the bottom of his
quiver, and handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>D'Arnot glanced at the title page.</p>

<p>"It is the diary of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, an English
nobleman, and it is written in French," he said.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to read the diary that had been written over
twenty years before, and which recorded the details of the story
which we already know&mdash;the story of adventure, hardships and
sorrow of John Clayton and his wife Alice, from the day they left
England until an hour before he was struck down by Kerchak.</p>

<p>D'Arnot read aloud. At times his voice broke, and he was
forced to stop reading for the pitiful, hopelessness that spoke
between the lines.</p>

<p>Occasionally he glanced at Tarzan; but the ape-man sat upon
his haunches, like a carven image, his eyes fixed upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Only when the little babe was mentioned did the tone of the
diary alter from the habitual note of despair which had crept
into it by degrees after the first two months upon the shore.</p>

<p>Then the passages were tinged with a subdued happiness that
was even sadder than the rest.</p>

<p>One entry showed an almost hopeful spirit.</p> <BR>

<p class="letter">To-day our little boy is six months old. He is
sitting in Alice's lap beside the table where I am
writing&mdash;a happy, healthy, perfect child.</p>

<p class="letter">Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see
him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world&mdash;the
second John Clayton&mdash;and bringing added honors to the house
of Greystoke.</p>

<p class="letter">There&mdash;as though to give my prophecy the
weight of his endorsement&mdash;he has grabbed my pen in his
chubby fist and with his ink-begrimed little fingers has placed
the seal of his tiny finger prints upon the page.</p> <BR>

<p>And there, on the margin of the page, were the partially
blurred imprints of four wee fingers and the outer half of the
thumb.</p>

<p>When D'Arnot had finished the diary the two men sat in silence
for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Well! Tarzan of the Apes, what think you?" asked D'Arnot.
"Does not this little book clear up the mystery of your
parentage?</p>

<p>"Why, man, you are Lord Greystoke."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head.</p>

<p>"The book speaks of but one child," he replied. "Its little
skeleton lay in the crib, where it died crying for nourishment,
from the first time I entered the cabin until Professor Porter's
party buried it, with its father and mother, beside the
cabin.</p>

<p>"No, that was the babe the book speaks of&mdash;and the
mystery of my origin is deeper than before, for I have thought
much of late of the possibility of that cabin having been my
birthplace.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that Kala spoke the truth," he concluded
sadly.</p>

<p>D'Arnot shook his head. He was unconvinced, and in his mind
had sprung the determination to prove the correctness of his
theory, for he had discovered the key which alone could unlock
the mystery, or consign it forever to the realms of the
unfathomable.</p>

<p><BR> A week later the two men came suddenly upon a clearing in
the forest.</p>

<p>In the distance were several buildings surrounded by a strong
palisade. Between them and the enclosure stretched a cultivated
field in which a number of negroes were working.</p>

<p>The two halted at the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p>Tarzan fitted his bow with a poisoned arrow, but D'Arnot
placed a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"What would you do, Tarzan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They will try to kill us if they see us," replied Tarzan. "I
prefer to be the killer."</p>

<p>"Maybe they are friends," suggested D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"They are black," was Tarzan's only reply.</p>

<p>And again he drew back his shaft.</p>

<p>"You must not, Tarzan!" cried D'Arnot. "White men do not kill
wantonly. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> but you have much to learn.</p>

<p>"I pity the ruffler who crosses you, my wild man, when I take
you to Paris. I will have my hands full keeping your neck from
beneath the guillotine."</p>

<p>Tarzan lowered his bow and smiled.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I should kill the blacks back there in my
jungle, yet not kill them here. Suppose Numa, the lion, should
spring out upon us, I should say, then, I presume: Good morning,
Monsieur Numa, how is Madame Numa, eh?"</p>

<p>"Wait until the blacks spring upon you," replied D'Arnot,
"then you may kill them. Do not assume that men are your enemies
until they prove it."</p>

<p>"Come," said Tarzan, "let us go and present ourselves to be
killed," and he started straight across the field, his head high
held and the tropical sun beating upon his smooth, brown
skin.</p>

<p>Behind him came D'Arnot, clothed in some garments which had
been discarded at the cabin by Clayton when the officers of the
French cruiser had fitted him out in more presentable
fashion.</p>

<p>Presently one of the blacks looked up, and beholding Tarzan,
turned, shrieking, toward the palisade.</p>

<p>In an instant the air was filled with cries of terror from the
fleeing gardeners, but before any had reached the palisade a
white man emerged from the enclosure, rifle in hand, to discover
the cause of the commotion.</p>

<p>What he saw brought his rifle to his shoulder, and Tarzan of
the Apes would have felt cold lead once again had not D'Arnot
cried loudly to the man with the leveled gun:</p>

<p>"Do not fire! We are friends!"</p>

<p>"Halt, then!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Stop, Tarzan!" cried D'Arnot. "He thinks we are enemies."</p>

<p>Tarzan dropped into a walk, and together he and D'Arnot
advanced toward the white man by the gate.</p>

<p>The latter eyed them in puzzled bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What manner of men are you?" he asked, in French.</p>

<p>"White men," replied D'Arnot. "We have been lost in the jungle
for a long time."</p>

<p>The man had lowered his rifle and now advanced with
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"I am Father Constantine of the French Mission here," he said,
"and I am glad to welcome you."</p>

<p>"This is Monsieur Tarzan, Father Constantine," replied
D'Arnot, indicating the ape-man; and as the priest extended his
hand to Tarzan, D'Arnot added: "and I am Paul D'Arnot, of the
French Navy."</p>

<p>Father Constantine took the hand which Tarzan extended in
imitation of the priest's act, while the latter took in the
superb physique and handsome face in one quick, keen glance.</p>

<p>And thus came Tarzan of the Apes to the first outpost of
civilization.</p>

<p>For a week they remained there, and the ape-man, keenly
observant, learned much of the ways of men; while black women
sewed upon white duck garments for himself and D'Arnot that they
might continue their journey properly clothed.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch26" name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE HEIGHT OF
CIVILIZATION</h2>

<p class="first"> ANOTHER month brought them to a little group of
buildings at the mouth of a wide river, and there Tarzan saw many
boats, and was filled with the old timidity of the wild thing by
the sight of many men.</p>

<p>Gradually he became accustomed to the strange noises and the
odd ways of civilization, so that presently none might know that
two short months before, this handsome Frenchman in immaculate
white ducks, who laughed and chatted with the gayest of them, had
been swinging naked through primeval forests to pounce upon some
unwary victim, which, raw, was to fill his savage belly.</p>

<p>The knife and fork, so contemptuously flung aside a month
before, Tarzan now manipulated as exquisitely as did the polished
D'Arnot.</p>

<p>So apt a pupil had he been that the young Frenchman had
labored assiduously to make of Tarzan of the Apes a polished
gentleman in so far as nicety of manners and speech were
concerned.</p>

<p>"God made you a gentleman at heart, my friend," D'Arnot had
said; "but we want His works to show upon the exterior also."</p>

<p>As soon as they had reached the little port, D'Arnot had
cabled his government of his safety, and requested a three-months' leave, which had been granted.</p>

<p>He had also cabled his bankers for funds, and the enforced
wait of a month, under which both chafed, was due to their
inability to charter a vessel for the return to Tarzan's jungle
after the treasure.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>During their stay at the coast town "Monsieur Tarzan" became
the wonder of both whites and blacks because of several
occurrences which to Tarzan seemed the merest of nothings.</p>

<p>Once a huge black, crazed by drink, had run amuck and
terrorized the town, until his evil star had led him to where the
black-haired French giant lolled upon the veranda of the
hotel.</p>

<p>Mounting the broad steps, with brandishing knife, the negro
made straight for a party of four men sitting at a table sipping
the inevitable absinthe.</p>

<p>Shouting in alarm, the four took to their heels, and then the
black spied Tarzan.</p>

<p>With a roar he charged the ape-man, while half a hundred heads
peered from sheltering windows and doorways to witness the
butchering of the poor Frenchman by the giant black.</p>

<p>Tarzan met the rush with the fighting smile that the joy of
battle always brought to his lips.</p>

<p>As the negro closed upon him, steel muscles gripped the black
wrist of the uplifted knife-hand, and a single swift wrench left
the hand dangling below a broken bone.</p>

<p>With the pain and surprise, the madness left the black man,
and as Tarzan dropped back into his chair the fellow turned,
crying with agony, and dashed wildly toward the native
village.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>On another occasion as Tarzan and D'Arnot sat at dinner with a
number of other whites, the talk fell upon lions and lion
hunting.</p>

<p>Opinion was divided as to the bravery of the king of
beasts&mdash;some maintaining that he was an arrant coward, but
all agreeing that it was with a feeling of greater security that
they gripped their express rifles when the monarch of the jungle
roared about a camp at night.</p>

<p>D'Arnot and Tarzan had agreed that his past be kept secret,
and so none other than the French officer knew of the ape-man's
familiarity with the beasts of the jungle.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Tarzan has not expressed himself," said one of the
party. "A man of his prowess who has spent some time in Africa,
as I understand Monsieur Tarzan has, must have had experiences
with lions&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"Some," replied Tarzan, dryly. "Enough to know that each of
you are right in your judgment of the characteristics of the
lions&mdash;you have met. But one might as well judge all blacks
by the fellow who ran amuck last week, or decide that all whites
are cowards because one has met a cowardly white.</p>

<p>"There is as much individuality among the lower orders,
gentlemen, as there is among ourselves.</p>

<p>"To-day we may go out and stumble upon a lion which is over-timid&mdash;he runs away from us. To-morrow we may meet his uncle
or his twin brother, and our friends wonder why we do not return
from the jungle.</p>

<p>"For myself, I always assume that a lion is ferocious, and so
I am never caught off my guard."</p>

<p>"There would be little pleasure in hunting," retorted the
first speaker, "if one is afraid of the thing he hunts."</p>

<p>D'Arnot smiled. Tarzan afraid!</p>

<p>"I do not exactly understand what you mean by fear," said
Tarzan. "Like lions, fear is a different thing in different men,
but to me the only pleasure in the hunt is the knowledge that the
hunted thing has power to harm me as much as I have to harm
him.</p>

<p>"If I went out with a couple of rifles and a gun bearer, and
twenty or thirty beaters, to hunt a lion, I should not feel that
the lion had much chance, and so the pleasure of the hunt would
be lessened in proportion to the increased safety which I
felt."</p>

<p>"Then I am to take it that Monsieur Tarzan would prefer to go
naked into the jungle, armed only with a jackknife, to kill the
king of beasts," laughed the other, good naturedly, but with the
merest touch of sarcasm in his tone.</p>

<p>"And a piece of rope," added Tarzan.</p>

<p>Just then the deep roar of a lion sounded from the distant
jungle, as though to challenge whoever dared enter the lists with
him.</p>

<p>"There is your opportunity, Monsieur Tarzan," bantered the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>"I am not hungry," said Tarzan simply.</p>

<p>The men laughed, all but D'Arnot. He alone knew that a savage
beast had spoken its simple reason through the lips of the ape-man.</p>

<p>"But you are afraid, just as any of us would be, to go out
there naked, armed only with a knife and a piece of rope," said
the banterer. "Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Tarzan. "Only a fool performs any act without
reason."</p>

<p>"Five thousand francs is a reason," said the other. "I wager
you that amount you cannot bring back a lion from the jungle
under the conditions we have named&mdash;naked and armed only
with a knife and a piece of rope."</p>

<p>Tarzan glanced toward D'Arnot and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Make it ten thousand," said D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Done," replied the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan arose.</p>

<p>"I shall have to leave my clothes at the edge of the
settlement, so that if I do not return before daylight I shall
have something to wear through the streets."</p>

<p>"You are not going now," exclaimed the wagerer&mdash;"at
night?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Tarzan. "Numa walks abroad at night&mdash;it
will be easier to find him."</p>

<p>"No," said the other, "I do not want your blood upon my hands.
It will be foolhardy enough if you go forth by day."</p>

<p>"I shall go now," replied Tarzan, and went to his room for his
knife and rope.</p>

<p>The men accompanied him to the edge of the jungle, where he
left his clothes in a small storehouse.</p>

<p>But when he would have entered the blackness of the
undergrowth they tried to dissuade him; and the wagerer was most
insistent of all that he abandon his foolhardy venture.</p>

<p>"I will accede that you have won," he said, "and the ten
thousand francs are yours if you will but give up this foolish
attempt, which can only end in your death."</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed, and in another moment the jungle had swallowed
him.</p>

<p>The men stood silent for some moments and then slowly turned
and walked back to the hotel veranda.</p>

<p>Tarzan had no sooner entered the jungle than he took to the
trees, and it was with a feeling of exultant freedom that he
swung once more through the forest branches.</p>

<p>This was life! Ah, how he loved it! Civilization held nothing
like this in its narrow and circumscribed sphere, hemmed in by
restrictions and conventionalities. Even clothes were a
hinderance and a nuisance.</p>

<p>At last he was free. He had not realized what a prisoner he
had been.</p>

<p>How easy it would be to circle back to the coast, and then
make toward the south and his own jungle and cabin.</p>

<p>Now he caught the scent of Numa, for he was traveling up wind.
Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded
feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body through the
undergrowth.</p>

<p>Tarzan came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently
stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight.</p>

<p>Then the quick noose settled and tightened about the tawny
throat, and, as he had done it a hundred times in the past,
Tarzan made fast the end to a strong branch and, while the beast
fought and clawed for freedom, dropped to the ground behind him,
and leaping upon the great back, plunged his long thin blade a
dozen times into the fierce heart.</p>

<p>Then with his foot upon the carcass of Numa, he raised his
voice in the awesome victory cry of his savage tribe.</p>

<p>For a moment Tarzan stood irresolute, swayed by conflicting
emotions of loyalty to D'Arnot and a mighty lust for the freedom
of his own jungle. At last the vision of a beautiful face, and
the memory of warm lips crushed to his dissolved the fascinating
picture he had been drawing of his old life.</p>

<p>The ape-man threw the warm carcass of Numa across his
shoulders and took to the trees once more.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>The men upon the veranda had sat for an hour, almost in
silence.</p>

<p>They had tried ineffectually to converse on various subjects,
and always the thing uppermost in the mind of each had caused the
conversation to lapse.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu,"</i> said the wagerer at length, "I can endure
it no longer. I am going into the jungle with my express and
bring back that mad man."</p>

<p>"I will go with you," said one.</p>

<p>"And I"&mdash;"And I"&mdash;"And I," chorused the others.</p>

<p>As though the suggestion had broken the spell of some horrid
nightmare they hastened to their various quarters, and presently
were headed toward the jungle&mdash;each man heavily armed.</p>

<p>"God! What was that?" suddenly cried one of the party, an
Englishman, as Tarzan's savage cry came faintly to their
ears.</p>

<p>"I heard the same thing once before," said a Belgian, "when I
was in the gorilla country. My carriers said it was the cry of a
great bull ape who has made a kill."</p>

<p>D'Arnot remembered Clayton's description of the awful roar
with which Tarzan had announced his kills, and he half smiled in
spite of the horror which filled him to think that the uncanny
sound could have issued from a human throat&mdash;from the lips
of his friend.</p>

<p>As the party stood finally near the edge of the jungle,
debating as to the best distribution of their forces, they were
startled by a low laugh near them, and turning, beheld advancing
toward them a giant figure bearing a dead lion upon its broad
shoulders.</p>

<p>Even D'Arnot was thunderstruck, for it seemed impossible that
the man could have so quickly dispatched a lion with the pitiful
weapons he had taken, or that alone he could have borne the huge
carcass through the tangled jungle.</p>

<p>The men crowded about Tarzan with many questions, but his only
answer was a laughing depreciation of his feat.</p>

<p>To Tarzan it was as though one should eulogize a butcher for
his heroism in killing a cow, for Tarzan had killed so often for
food and for self-preservation that the act seemed anything but
remarkable to him. But he was indeed a hero in the eyes of these
men&mdash;men accustomed to hunting big game.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he had won ten thousand francs, for D'Arnot
insisted that he keep it all.</p>

<p>This was a very important item to Tarzan, who was just
commencing to realize the power which lay behind the little
pieces of metal and paper which always changed hands when human
beings rode, or ate, or slept, or clothed themselves, or drank,
or worked, or played, or sheltered themselves from the rain or
cold or sun.</p>

<p>It had become evident to Tarzan that without money one must
die. D'Arnot had told him not to worry, since he had more than
enough for both, but the ape-man was learning many things and one
of them was that people looked down upon one who accepted money
from another without giving something of equal value in
exchange.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Shortly after the episode of the lion hunt, D'Arnot succeeded
in chartering an ancient tub for the coastwise trip to Tarzan's
land-locked harbor.</p>

<p>It was a happy morning for them both when the little vessel
weighed anchor and made for the open sea.</p>

<p>The trip to the beach was uneventful, and the morning after
they dropped anchor before the cabin, Tarzan, garbed once more in
his jungle regalia, and carrying a spade, set out alone for the
amphitheater of the apes where lay the treasure.</p>

<p>Late the next day he returned, bearing the great chest upon
his shoulder, and at sunrise the little vessel was worked through
the harbor's mouth and took up her northward journey.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Three weeks later Tarzan and D'Arnot were passengers on board
a French steamer bound for Lyons, and after a few days in that
city D'Arnot took Tarzan to Paris.</p>

<p>The ape-man was anxious to proceed to America, but D'Arnot
insisted that he must accompany him to Paris first, nor would he
divulge the nature of the urgent necessity upon which he based
his demand.</p>

<p>One of the first things which D'Arnot accomplished after their
arrival was to arrange to visit a high official of the police
department, an old friend; and to take Tarzan with him.</p>

<p>Adroitly D'Arnot led the conversation from point to point
until the policeman had explained to the interested Tarzan many
of the methods in vogue for apprehending and identifying
criminals.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting to Tarzan was the part played by
finger prints in this fascinating science.</p>

<p>"But of what value are these imprints," asked Tarzan, "when,
after a few years the lines upon the fingers are entirely changed
by the wearing out of the old tissue and the growth of new?"</p>

<p>"The lines never change," replied the official. "From infancy
to senility the finger prints of an individual change only in
size, except as injuries alter the loops and whorls. But if
imprints have been taken of the thumb and four fingers of both
hands one must needs lose all entirely to escape
identification."</p>

<p>"It is marvellous," exclaimed D'Arnot. "I wonder what the
lines upon my own fingers may resemble."</p>

<p>"We can soon see," replied the police officer, and ringing a
bell he summoned an assistant to whom he issued a few
directions.</p>

<p>The man left the room, but presently returned with a little
hardwood box which he placed on his superior's desk.</p>

<p>"Now," said the officer, "you shall have your finger prints in
a second."</p>

<p>He drew from the little case a square of plate glass, a little
tube of thick ink, a rubber roller, and a few snowy white
cards.</p>

<p>Squeezing a drop of ink onto the glass, he spread it back and
forth with the rubber roller until the entire surface of the
glass was covered to his satisfaction with a very thin and
uniform layer of ink.</p>

<p>"Place the four fingers of your right hand upon the glass,
thus," he said to D'Arnot. "Now the thumb. That is right. Now
place them in just the same position upon this card, here,
no&mdash;a little to the right. We must leave room for the thumb
and the fingers of the left hand. There, that's it. Now the same
with the left."</p>

<p>"Come, Tarzan," cried D'Arnot, "let's see what your whorls
look like."</p>

<p>Tarzan complied readily, asking many questions of the officer
during the operation.</p>

<p>"Do finger prints show racial characteristics?" he asked.
"Could you determine, for example, solely from finger prints
whether the subject was Negro or Caucasian?"</p>

<p>"I think not," replied the officer, "although some claim that
those of the negro are less complex."</p>

<p>"Could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those of a
man?"</p>

<p>"Probably, because the ape's would be far simpler than those
of the higher organism."</p>

<p>"But a cross between an ape and a man might show the
characteristics of either progenitor?" continued Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think likely," responded the official; "but the
science has not progressed sufficiently to render it exact enough
in such matters. I should hate to trust its findings further than
to differentiate between individuals.</p>

<p>"There it is absolute. No two people born into the world
probably have ever had identical lines upon all their digits. It
is very doubtful if any single finger print will ever be exactly
duplicated by any finger other than the one which originally made
it."</p>

<p>"Does the comparison require much time or labor?" asked
D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Ordinarily but a few moments, if the impressions are
distinct."</p>

<p>D'Arnot drew a little black book from his pocket and commenced
turning the pages.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked at the book in surprise. How did D'Arnot come to
have his book?</p>

<p>Presently D'Arnot stopped at a page on which were five tiny
little smudges.</p>

<p>He handed the open book to the policeman.</p>

<p>"Are these imprints similar to mine or Monsieur Tarzan's, or
can you say that they are identical with either?"</p>

<p>The officer drew a powerful glass from his desk and examined
all three specimens carefully, making notations meanwhile upon a
pad of paper.</p>

<p>Tarzan realized now what was the meaning of their visit to the
police officer.</p>

<p>The answer to his life's riddle lay in these tiny marks.</p>

<p>With tense nerves he sat leaning forward in his chair, but
suddenly he relaxed and dropped back, smiling.</p>

<p>D'Arnot looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"You forget that for twenty years the dead body of the child
who made those finger prints lay in the cabin of his father, and
that all my life I have seen it lying there," said Tarzan
bitterly.</p>

<p>The policeman looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, captain, with your examination," said D'Arnot, "we
will tell you the story later&mdash;provided Monsieur Tarzan is
agreeable."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded his head.</p>

<p>"But you are mad, my dear D'Arnot," he insisted. "Those little
fingers are buried on the west coast of Africa."</p>

<p>"I do not know as to that, Tarzan," replied D'Arnot. "It is
possible, but if you are not the son of John Clayton then how in
heaven's name did you come into that God forsaken jungle where no
white man other than John Clayton had ever set foot?"</p>

<p>"You forget&mdash;Kala," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I do not even consider her," replied D'Arnot.</p>

<p>The friends had walked to the broad window overlooking the
boulevard as they talked. For sometime they stood there gazing
out upon the busy throng beneath, each wrapped in his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"It takes some time to compare finger prints," thought
D'Arnot, turning to look at the police officer.</p>

<p>To his astonishment he saw the official leaning back in his
chair hastily scanning the contents of the little black
diary.</p>

<p>D'Arnot coughed. The policeman looked up, and, catching his
eye, raised his finger to admonish silence.</p>

<p>D'Arnot turned back to the window, and presently the police
officer spoke.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said.</p>

<p>Both turned toward him.</p>

<p>"There is evidently a great deal at stake which must hinge to
a greater or lesser extent upon the absolute correctness of this
comparison. I therefore ask that you leave the entire matter in
my hands until Monsieur Desquerc, our expert, returns. It will be
but a matter of a few days."</p>

<p>"I had hoped to know at once," said D'Arnot. "Monsieur Tarzan
sails for America tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I will promise that you can cable him a report within two
weeks," replied the officer; "but what it will be I dare not say.
There are resemblances, yet, well, we had better leave it for
Monsieur Desquerc to solve."</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch27" name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE GIANT
AGAIN</h2>

<p class="first">A TAXICAB drew up before an old-fashioned
residence upon the outskirts of Baltimore.</p>

<p>A man of about forty, well built and with strong, regular
features, stepped out, and paying the chauffeur dismissed
him.</p>

<p>A moment later the passenger was entering the library of the
old home.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Canler!" exclaimed an old man, rising to greet
him.</p>

<p>"Good evening, my dear Professor," cried the man, extending a
cordial hand.</p>

<p>"Who admitted you?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"Esmeralda."</p>

<p>"Then she will acquaint Jane with the fact that you are here,"
said the old man.</p>

<p>"No, Professor," replied Canler, "for I came primarily to see
you."</p>

<p>"Ah, I am honored," said Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"Professor," continued Robert Canler, with great deliberation,
as though carefully weighing his words, "I have come this evening
to speak with you about Jane.</p>

<p>"You know my aspirations, and you have been generous enough to
approve my suit."</p>

<p>Professor Archimedes Q. Porter fidgeted in his armchair. The
subject always made him uncomfortable. He could not understand
why. Canler was a splendid match.</p>

<p>"But Jane," continued Canler, "I cannot understand her. She
puts me off first on one ground and then another. I have always
the feeling that she breathes a sigh of relief every time I bid
her good-by."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut," said Professor Porter. "Tut&mdash;tut, Mr.
Canler. Jane is a most obedient daughter. She will do precisely
as I tell her."</p>

<p>"Then I can still count on your support?" asked Canler, a tone
of relief marking his voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; certainly, sir," exclaimed Professor Porter.
"How could you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"There is young Clayton, you know," suggested Canler. "He has
been hanging about for months.</p>

<p>"I don't know that Jane cares for him; but beside his title
they say he has inherited a very considerable estate from his
father, and it might not be strange, if he finally won her,
unless&mdash;" and Canler paused.</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut, Mr. Canler; unless&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Unless, you see fit to request that Jane and I be married at
once," said Canler, slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"I have already suggested to Jane that it would be desirable,"
said Professor Porter sadly, "for we can no longer afford to keep
up this house, and live as her associations demand."</p>

<p>"What was her reply?" asked Canler.</p>

<p>"She said she was not ready to marry anyone yet," replied
Professor Porter, "and that we could go and live upon the farm in
northern Wisconsin which her mother left her.</p>

<p>"It is a little more than self-supporting. The tenants have
always made a living from it, and been able to send Jane a trifle
beside, each year.</p>

<p>"She is planning on our going up there the first of the week.
Philander and Mr. Clayton have already gone to get things in
readiness for us."</p>

<p>"Clayton has gone there?" exclaimed Canler, visibly chagrined.
"Why was I not told? I would gladly have gone and seen that every
comfort was provided."</p>

<p>"Jane feels that we are already too much in your debt, Mr.
Canler," said Professor Porter.</p>

<p>Canler was about to reply, when the sound of footsteps came
from the hall without, and Jane Porter entered the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!" she exclaimed, pausing on the
threshold. "I thought you were alone, papa."</p>

<p>"It is only I, Jane," said Canler, who had risen, "won't you
come in and join the family group? We were just speaking of
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jane Porter, entering and taking the chair
Canler placed for her. "I only wanted to tell papa that Tobey is
coming down from the college tomorrow to pack his books. I want
you to be sure, papa, to indicate all that you can do without
until fall. Please don't carry this entire library to Wisconsin,
as you would have carried it to Africa, if I had not put my foot
down."</p>

<p>"Was Tobey here?" asked Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I just left him. He and Esmeralda are exchanging
religious experiences on the back porch now."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut, I must see him at once!" cried the professor.
"Excuse me just a moment, children," and the old man hastened
from the room.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of earshot Canler turned to Jane
Porter.</p>

<p>"See here, Jane," he said bluntly. "How long is this thing
going on like this?</p>

<p>"You haven't refused to marry me, but you haven't promised
either.</p>

<p>"I want to get the license tomorrow, so that we can be married
quietly before you leave for Wisconsin. I don't care for any fuss
or feathers, and I'm sure you don't either."</p>

<p>The girl turned cold, but she held her head bravely.</p>

<p>"Your father wishes it, you know," added Canler.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>She spoke scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Do you realize that you are buying me, Mr. Canler?" she said
finally, and in a cold, level voice. "Buying me for a few paltry
dollars? Of course you do, Robert Canler, and the hope of just
such a contingency was in your mind when you loaned papa the
money for that hair-brained escapade, which but for a most
mysterious circumstance would have been surprisingly
successful.</p>

<p>"But you, Mr. Canler, would have been the most surprised. You
had no idea that the venture would succeed. You are too good a
business man for that. And you are too good a business man to
loan money for buried-treasure seeking, or to loan money without
security&mdash;unless you had some special object in view.</p>

<p>"You knew that without security you had a greater hold on the
honor of the Porters than with it. You knew the one best way to
force me to marry you, without seeming to force me.</p>

<p>"You have never mentioned the loan. In any other man I should
have thought that the prompting of a magnanimous and noble
character. But you are deep, Mr. Robert Canler. I know you better
than you think I know you.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly marry you if there is no other way, but let
us understand each other once and for all."</p>

<p>While she spoke Robert Canler had alternately flushed and
paled, and when she ceased speaking he arose, and with a cynical
smile upon his strong face, said:</p>

<p>"You surprise me, Jane. I thought you had more self-control&mdash;more pride.</p>

<p>"Of course you are right. I am buying you, and I knew that you
knew it, but I thought you would prefer to pretend that it was
otherwise. I should have thought your self-respect and your
Porter pride would have shrunk from admitting, even to yourself,
that you were a bought woman.</p>

<p>"But have it your own way, dear girl," he added lightly. "I am
going to have you, and that is all that interests me."</p>

<p>Without a word the girl turned and left the room.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Jane Porter was not married before she left with her father
and Esmeralda for her little Wisconsin farm, and as she coldly
bid Robert Canler good-by as her train pulled out, he called to
her that he would join them in a week or two.</p>

<p>At their destination they were met by Clayton and Mr.
Philander in a huge touring car belonging to the former, and
quickly whirled away through the dense northern woods toward the
little farm which the girl had not visited before since
childhood.</p>

<p>The farmhouse, which stood on a little elevation some hundred
yards from the tenant house, had undergone a complete
transformation, during the three weeks that Clayton and Mr.
Philander had been there.</p>

<p>The former had imported a small army of carpenters and
plasterers, plumbers and painters from a distant city, and what
had been but a dilapidated shell when they reached it was now a
cosy little two-story house filled with every modern convenience
procurable in so short a time.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Clayton, what have you done?" cried Jane Porter, her
heart sinking within her as she realized the probable size of the
expenditure that had been made.</p>

<p>"S-sh," cautioned Clayton. "Don't let your father guess. If
you don't tell him he will never notice, and I simply couldn't
think of him living in the terrible squalor and sordidness which
Mr. Philander and I found. It was so little when I would do so
much, Jane. For his sake, please, never mention it."</p>

<p>"But you know that we can't repay you," cried the girl. "Why
do you want to put me under such terrible obligations?"</p>

<p>"Don't, Jane," said Clayton sadly. "If it had been just you,
believe me, I wouldn't have done it, for I knew from the start
that it would only hurt me in your eyes, but I couldn't think of
that dear old man living in the hole we found here.</p>

<p>"Won't you please believe that I did it just for him and give
me that little crumb of pleasure at least?"</p>

<p>"I do believe you, Mr. Clayton," said the girl, "because I
know you are big enough and generous enough to have done it just
for him&mdash;and, oh Cecil, I wish I might repay you as you
deserve&mdash;as you would wish."</p>

<p>"Why can't you, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Because I love another."</p>

<p>"Canler?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But you are going to marry him. He told me as much before I
left Baltimore."</p>

<p>The girl winced.</p>

<p>"I do not love him," she said, almost proudly.</p>

<p>"Is it because of the money, Jane?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Then am I so much less desirable than Canler? I have money
enough, and far more, for every need," he said bitterly.</p>

<p>"I do not love you, Cecil," she said, "but I respect you. If I
must disgrace myself by such a bargain with any man, I prefer
that it be one I already despise. I should loathe the man to whom
I sold myself without love, whomsoever he might be.</p>

<p>"You will be happier," she concluded, "alone&mdash;with my
respect and friendship, than with me and my contempt."</p>

<p>He did not press the matter further, but if ever a man had
murder in his heart it was William Cecil Clayton, Lord Greystoke,
when, a week later, Robert Canler drew up before the farmhouse in
his purring six cylinder.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>A week passed; a tense, uneventful, but uncomfortable week for
all the inmates of the little Wisconsin farmhouse.</p>

<p>Canler was insistent that Jane marry him at once.</p>

<p>At length she gave in from sheer loathing of the continued and
hateful importuning.</p>

<p>It was agreed that on the morrow Canler was to drive to town
and bring back the license and a minister.</p>

<p>Clayton had wanted to leave as soon as the plan was announced,
but the girl's tired, hopeless look kept him. He could not desert
her.</p>

<p>Something might happen yet, he tried to console himself by
thinking. And in his heart, he knew that it would require but a
tiny spark to turn his hatred for Canler into the blood lust of
the killer.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>Early the next morning Canler set out for town.</p>

<p>In the east smoke could be seen lying low over the forest, for
a fire had been raging for a week not far from them, but the wind
still lay in the west and no danger threatened them.</p>

<p>About noon Jane Porter started off for a walk. She would not
let Clayton accompany her. She wanted to be alone, she said, and
he respected her wishes.</p>

<p>In the house Professor Porter and Mr. Philander were immersed
in an absorbing discussion of some weighty scientific problem.
Esmeralda dozed in the kitchen, and Clayton, heavy-eyed after a
sleepless night, threw himself down upon the couch in the living
room and soon dropped into a fitful slumber.</p>

<p>To the east the black smoke clouds rose higher into the
heavens, suddenly they eddied, and then commenced to drift
rapidly toward the west.</p>

<p>On and on they came. The inmates of the tenant house were
gone, for it was market day, and none there was to see the rapid
approach of the fiery demon.</p>

<p>Soon the flames had spanned the road to the south and cut off
Canler's return. A little fluctuation of the wind now carried the
path of the forest fire to the north, then blew back and the
flames nearly stood still as though held in leash by some master
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the north-east, a great black car came
careening down the road.</p>

<p>With a jolt it stopped before the cottage, and a black-haired
giant leaped out to run up onto the porch. Without a pause he
rushed into the house. On the couch lay Clayton. The man started
in surprise, but with a bound was at the side of the sleeping
man.</p>

<p>Shaking him roughly by the shoulder, he cried:</p>

<p>"My God, Clayton, are you all mad here? Don't you know you are
nearly surrounded by fire? Where is Miss Porter?"</p>

<p>Clayton sprang to his feet. He did not recognize the man, but
he understood the words and was upon the veranda in a bound.</p>

<p>"Scott!" he cried, and then, dashing back into the house,
"Jane! Jane! where are you?"</p>

<p>In an instant Esmeralda, Professor Porter and Mr. Philander
had joined the two men.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Jane?" cried Clayton, seizing Esmeralda by the
shoulders and shaking her roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gaberelle, Marse Clayton, she done gone for a walk."</p>

<p>"Hasn't she come back yet?" and, without waiting for a reply,
Clayton dashed out into the yard, followed by the others.</p>

<p>"Which way did she go?" cried the black-haired giant of
Esmeralda.</p>

<p>"Down dat road," cried the frightened black, pointing toward
the south where a mighty wall of roaring flames shut out the
view.</p>

<p>"Put these people in the other car," shouted the stranger to
Clayton. "I saw one as I drove up&mdash;and get them out of here
by the north road.</p>

<p>"I'll Leave my car here. If I find Miss Porter we shall need it. If
I don't, no one will need it. Do as I say," as Clayton hesitated,
and then they saw the lithe figure bound away across the clearing
toward the northwest where the forest still stood, untouched by
flame.</p>

<p>In each rose the unaccountable feeling that a great
responsibility had been raised from their shoulders; a kind of
implicit confidence in the power of the stranger to save Jane
Porter if she could be saved.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Professor Porter.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Clayton. "He called me by name and he
knew Jane, for he asked for her. And he called Esmeralda by
name."</p>

<p>"There was something most startlingly familiar about him,"
exclaimed Mr. Philander, "and yet, bless me, I know I never saw
him before."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut!" cried Professor Porter. "Most remarkable! Who
could it have been, and why do I feel that Jane is safe, now that
he has set out in search of her?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, Professor," said Clayton soberly, "but I
know I have the same uncanny feeling. But come," he cried, "we
must get out of here ourselves, or we shall be shut off," and
the party hastened toward Clayton's machine.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>When Jane Porter turned to retrace her steps homeward, she was
alarmed to note how near the smoke of the forest fire seemed, and
as she hastened onward, her alarm became almost a panic when she
perceived that the rushing flames were rapidly forcing their way
between herself and the cottage.</p>

<p>At length she was compelled to turn into the dense thicket and
attempt to force her way to the west in an effort to circle
around the flames and regain her home.</p>

<p>In a short time the futility of her attempt became apparent
and then her one hope lay in retracing her steps to the road and
flying for her life to the south toward the town.</p>

<p>The twenty minutes that it took her to regain the road was all
that had been needed to cut off her retreat as effectually as her
advance had been cut off before.</p>

<p>A short run down the road brought her to a horrified stand,
for there before her was another wall of flame. An arm of the
parent conflagration had shot out a half mile south of its mate
to embrace this tiny strip of road in its implacable
clutches.</p>

<p>Jane Porter knew that it was useless again to attempt to force
her way through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>She had tried it once, and failed. Now she realized that it
would be but a matter of minutes ere the whole space between the
enemy on the north and the enemy on the south would be a seething
mass of billowing flames.</p>

<p>Calmly the girl kneeled down in the dust of the roadway and
prayed to her Maker to give her strength to meet her fate
bravely, and to deliver her father and her friends from
death.</p>

<p>She did not think to pray for deliverance for herself; for she
knew there was no hope&mdash;not even God could save her now.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard her name being called aloud through the
forest:</p>

<p>"Jane! Jane Porter!" It rang strong and clear, but in a
strange voice.</p>

<p>"Here!" she called in reply. "Here! In the roadway!"</p>

<p>Then through the branches of the trees she saw a figure
swinging with the speed of a squirrel.</p>

<p>A veering of the wind blew a cloud of smoke about them and she
could no longer see the man who was speeding toward her, but
suddenly she felt a great arm about her. Then she was lifted up,
and she felt the rushing of the wind and the occasional brush of
a branch as she was borne along.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes.</p>

<p>Far below her lay the undergrowth and the hard earth.</p>

<p>About her was the waving foliage of the forest.</p>

<p>From tree to tree swung the giant figure which bore her, and
it seemed to Jane Porter that she was living over in a dream the
experience that had been hers in that far African jungle.</p>

<p>Oh, if it were but the same man who had borne her so swiftly
through the tangled verdure on that other day; but that were
impossible. Yet who else in all the world was there with the
strength and agility to do what this man was now doing?</p>

<p>She stole a sudden glance at the face close to hers, and then
she gave a little frightened gasp&mdash;it was he!</p>

<p>"My man!" she murmured. "No, it is the delirium which precedes
death."</p>

<p>She must have spoken aloud, for the eyes that bent
occasionally to hers lighted with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, your man, Jane Porter; your savage, primeval man come
out of the jungle to claim his mate&mdash;the woman who ran away
from him," he added almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"I did not run away," she whispered. "I would only consent to
leave when they had waited a week for you to return."</p>

<p>They had come to a point beyond the fire now, and he had
turned back to the clearing.</p>

<p>Side by side they were walking toward the cottage. The wind
had changed once more and the fire was burning back upon
itself&mdash;another hour like that and it would be burned
out.</p>

<p>"Why did you not return?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I was nursing D'Arnot. He was badly wounded."</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew it!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"They said you had gone to join the blacks&mdash;that they
were your people."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"But you did not believe them, Jane?"</p>

<p>"No;&mdash;what shall I call you?" she asked. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"I was Tarzan of the Apes when you first knew me," he
said.</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes!" she cried&mdash;"and that was your note
I answered when I left?"</p>

<p>"Yes, whose did you think it was?"</p>

<p>"I did not know; only that it could not be yours, for Tarzan
of the Apes had written in English, and you could not understand
a word of any language."</p>

<p>Again he laughed.</p>

<p>"It is a long story, but it was I who wrote what I could not
speak&mdash;and now D'Arnot has made matters worse by teaching me
to speak French instead of English."</p>

<p>"Come," he added, "jump into my car, we must overtake your
father, they are only a little way ahead."</p>

<p>As they drove along, he said:</p>

<p>"Then when you said in your note to Tarzan of the Apes that
you loved another&mdash;you might have meant me?"</p>

<p>"I might have," she answered, simply.</p>

<p>"But in Baltimore&mdash;Oh, how I have searched for
you&mdash;they told me you would possibly be married by now. That
a man named Canler had come up here to wed you. Is that
true?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you love him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you love me?"</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"I am promised to another. I cannot answer you, Tarzan of the
Apes," she cried.</p>

<p>"You have answered. Now, tell me why you would marry one you
do not love."</p>

<p>"My father owes him money."</p>

<p>Suddenly there came back to Tarzan the memory of the letter he
had read&mdash;and the name Robert Canler and the hinted trouble
which he had been unable to understand then.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"If your father had not lost the treasure you would not feel
forced to keep your promise to this man Canler?"</p>

<p>"I could ask him to release me."</p>

<p>"And if he refused?"</p>

<p>"I have given my promise."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. The car was plunging along the
uneven road at a reckless pace, for the fire showed threateningly
at their right, and another change of the wind might sweep it on
with raging fury across this one avenue of escape.</p>

<p>Finally they passed the danger point, and Tarzan reduced their
speed.</p>

<p>"Suppose I should ask him?" ventured Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He would scarcely accede to the demand of a stranger," said
the girl. "Especially one who wanted me himself."</p>

<p>"Terkoz did," said Tarzan, grimly.</p>

<p>Jane Porter shuddered and looked fearfully up at the giant
figure beside her, for she knew that he meant the great
anthropoid he had killed in her defense.</p>

<p>"This is not an African jungle," she said. "You are no longer
a savage beast. You are a gentleman, and gentlemen do not kill in
cold blood."</p>

<p>"I am still a wild beast at heart," he said, in a low voice,
as though to himself.</p>

<p>Again they were silent for a time.</p>

<p>"Jane Porter," said the man, at length, "if you were free,
would you marry me?"</p>

<p>She did not reply at once, but he waited patiently.</p>

<p>The girl was trying to collect her thoughts.</p>

<p>What did she know of this strange creature at her side? What
did he know of himself? Who was he? Who were his parents?</p>

<p>Why, his very name echoed his mysterious origin and his savage
life.</p>

<p>He had no name. Could she be happy with this jungle waif?
Could she find anything in common with a husband whose life had
been spent in the tree tops of an African wilderness, frolicking
and fighting with fierce anthropoids; tearing his food from the
quivering flank of fresh-killed prey, sinking his strong teeth
into raw flesh, and tearing away his portion while his mates
growled and fought about him for their share?</p>

<p>Could he ever rise to her social sphere? Could she bear to
think of sinking to his? Would either be happy in such a horrible
misalliance?</p>

<p>"You do not answer," he said. "Do you shrink from wounding
me?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what answer to make," said Jane Porter sadly.
"I do not know my own mind."</p>

<p>"You do not love me, then?" he asked, in a level tone.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me. You will be happier without me. You were never
meant for the formal restrictions and conventionalities of
society&mdash;civilization would become irksome to you, and in a
little while you would long for the freedom of your old
life&mdash;a life to which I am as totally unfitted as you to
mine."</p>

<p>"I think I understand you," he replied quietly. "I shall not
urge you, for I would rather see you happy than to be happy
myself.</p>

<p>"I see now that you could not be happy with&mdash;an ape."</p>

<p>There was just the faintest tinge of bitterness in his
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't," she remonstrated. "Don't say that. You do not
understand."</p>

<p>But before she could go on a sudden turn in the road brought
them into the midst of a little hamlet.</p>

<p>Before them stood Clayton's car surrounded by the party he had
brought from the cottage.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="ch28" name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; CONCLUSION</h2>

<p class="first"> AT THE sight of Jane Porter, cries of relief
and delight broke from every lip, and as Tarzan's car stopped
beside the other, Professor Porter caught his daughter in his
arms.</p>

<p>For a moment no one noticed Tarzan, sitting silently in his
seat.</p>

<p>Clayton was the first to remember, and, turning, held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"How can we ever thank you?" he exclaimed. "You have saved us
all.</p>

<p>"You called me by name at the cottage, but I do not seem to
recall yours, though there is something very familiar about
you.</p>

<p>"It is as though I had known you well under very different
conditions a long time ago."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled as he took the proferred hand.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Monsieur Clayton," he said, in French.
"You will pardon me if I do not speak to you in English. I am
just learning it, and while I understand it fairly well I speak
it very poorly."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" insisted Clayton, speaking in French this
time himself.</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>Clayton started back in surprise.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "It is true."</p>

<p>And Professor Porter and Mr. Philander pressed forward to add
their thanks to Clayton's, and to voice their surprise and
pleasure at seeing their jungle friend so far from his savage
home.</p>

<p>The party now entered the modest little hostelry, where
Clayton soon made arrangements for their entertainment.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>They were sitting in the little, stuffy parlor when the
distant chugging of an approaching automobile caught their
attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Philander, who was sitting near the window, looked out as
the machine drew in sight, finally stopping beside the other
cars.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Mr. Philander, a shade of annoyance in his
tone. "It is Mr. Canler. I had hoped, er&mdash;I had thought
or&mdash;er&mdash;how very happy we should be that he was not
caught in the fire," he ended lamely.</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut! Mr. Philander," said Professor Porter.
"Tut&mdash;tut! I have often admonished my pupils to count ten
before speaking. Were I you, Mr. Philander, I should count at
least a thousand, and then maintain a discreet silence."</p>

<p>"Bless me, yes!" acquiesced Mr. Philander. "But who is the
clerical-appearing gentleman with him?"</p>

<p>Jane Porter blanched.</p>

<p>Clayton moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>Professor Porter removed his spectacles nervously, and
breathed upon them, but replaced them on his nose without
wiping.</p>

<p>The ubiquitous Esmeralda grunted.</p>

<p>Only Tarzan did not comprehend.</p>

<p>Presently Robert Canler burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he cried. "I feared the worst, until I saw your
car, Clayton. I was cut off on the south road and had to go away
back to town, and then strike east to this road. I thought we'd
never reach the cottage."</p>

<p>No one seemed to enthuse much. Tarzan eyed Robert Canler as
Sabor eyes her prey.</p>

<p>Jane Porter glanced at him and coughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Canler," she said, "this is Monsieur Tarzan, an old
friend."</p>

<p>Canler turned and extended his hand. Tarzan rose and bowed as
only D'Arnot could have taught a gentleman to do it, but he did
not seem to see Canler's hand.</p>

<p>Nor did Canler appear to notice the oversight.</p>

<p>"This is the Reverend Mr. Tousley, Jane," said Canler, turning
to the clerical party behind him. "Mr. Tousley, Miss Porter."</p>

<p>Mr. Tousley bowed and beamed.</p>

<p>Canler introduced him to the others.</p>

<p>"We can have the ceremony at once, Jane," said Canler. "Then
you and I can catch the midnight train in town."</p>

<p>Tarzan understood the plan instantly. He glanced out of half-closed eyes at Jane Porter, but he did not move.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. The room was tense with the silence of
taut nerves.</p>

<p>All eyes turned toward Jane Porter, awaiting her reply.</p>

<p>"Can't we wait a few days?" she asked. "I am all unstrung. I
have been through so much today."</p>

<p>Canler felt the hostility that emanated from each member of
the party. It made him angry.</p>

<p>"We have waited as long as I intend to wait," he said roughly.
"You have promised to marry me. I shall be played with no longer.
I have the license and here is the preacher. Come Mr. Tousley;
come Jane. There are witnesses aplenty&mdash;more than enough,"
he added with a disagreeable inflection, and taking Jane Porter
by the arm, he started to lead her toward the waiting
minister.</p>

<p>But scarcely had he taken a single step ere a heavy hand
closed upon his arm with a grip of steel.</p>

<p>Another hand shot to his throat and in a moment he was being
shaken high above the floor, as a cat might shake a mouse.</p>

<p>Jane Porter turned in horrified surprise toward Tarzan.</p>

<p>And, as she looked into his face, she saw the crimson band
upon his forehead that she had seen that other day in far distant
Africa, when Tarzan of the Apes had closed in mortal combat with
the great anthropoid&mdash;Terkoz.</p>

<p>She knew that murder lay in that savage heart, and with a
little cry of horror she sprang forward to plead with the ape-man. But her fears were more for Tarzan than for Canler. She
realized the stern retribution which justice metes to the
murderer.</p>

<p>Before she could reach them, however, Clayton had jumped to
Tarzan's side and attempted to drag Canler from his grasp.</p>

<p>With a single sweep of one mighty arm the Englishman was
hurled across the room, and then Jane Porter laid a firm white
hand upon Tarzan's wrist, and looked up into his eyes.</p>

<p>"For my sake," she said.</p>

<p>The grasp upon Canler's throat relaxed.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked down into the beautiful face before him.</p>

<p>"Do you wish this to live?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"I do not wish him to die at your hands, my friend," she
replied. "I do not wish you to become a murderer."</p>

<p>Tarzan removed his hand from Canler's throat.</p>

<p>"Do you release her from her promise?" he asked. "It is the
price of your life."</p>

<p>Canler, gasping for breath, nodded.</p>

<p>"Will you go away and never molest her further?"</p>

<p>Again the man nodded his head, his face distorted by fear of
the death that had been so close.</p>

<p>Tarzan released him, and Canler staggered toward the door. In
another moment he was gone, and the terror-stricken preacher with
him.</p>

<p>Tarzan turned toward Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"May I speak with you for a moment, alone," he asked.</p>

<p>The girl nodded and started toward the door leading to the
narrow veranda of the little hotel. She passed out to await
Tarzan and so did not hear the conversation which followed.</p>

<p>"Wait," cried Professor Porter, as Tarzan was about to
follow.</p>

<p>The professor had been stricken dumb with surprise by the
rapid developments of the past few minutes.</p>

<p>"Before we go further, sir, I should like an explanation of
the events which have just transpired.</p>

<p>"By what right, sir, did you interfere between my daughter and
Mr. Canler?</p>

<p>"I had promised him her hand, sir, and regardless of our
personal likes or dislikes, sir, that promise must be kept."</p>

<p>"I interfered, Professor Porter," replied Tarzan, "because
your daughter does not love Mr. Canler&mdash;she does not wish to
marry him. That is enough for me to know."</p>

<p>"You do not know what you have done," said Professor Porter.
"Now he will doubtless refuse to marry her."</p>

<p>"He most certainly will," said Tarzan, emphatically.</p>

<p>"And further," added Tarzan, "you need not fear that your
pride will suffer, Professor Porter, for you will be able to pay
the Canler person what you owe him the moment you reach
home."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;tut, sir!" exclaimed Professor Porter. "What do you
mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"Your treasure has been found," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is that you are saying?" cried the professor.
"You are mad, man. It cannot be."</p>

<p>"It is, though. It was I who stole it, not knowing either its
value or to whom it belonged. I saw the sailors bury it, and,
ape-like, I had to dig it up and bury it again elsewhere.</p>

<p>"When D'Arnot told me what it was and what it meant to you I
returned to the jungle and recovered it. It had caused so much
crime and suffering and sorrow that D'Arnot thought it best not
to attempt to bring the treasure itself on here, as had been my
intention, so I have brought a letter of credit instead.</p>

<p>"Here it is, Professor Porter," and Tarzan drew an envelope
from his pocket and handed it to the astonished Professor, "two
hundred and forty-one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"The treasure was most carefully appraised by experts, but
lest there should be any question in your mind, D'Arnot himself
bought it and is holding it for you, should you prefer the
treasure to the credit."</p>

<p>"To the already great burden of the obligations we owe you,
sir," said Professor Porter, with trembling voice, "is now added
this greatest of all services. You have given me the means to
save my honor."</p>

<p>Clayton, who had left the room a moment after Canler, now
returned.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said. "I think we had better try to reach town
before dark and take the first train out of this forest. A native
just rode by from the north, who reports that the fire is moving
slowly in this direction."</p>

<p>This announcement broke up further conversation, and the
entire party went out to the waiting machines.</p>

<p>Clayton, with Jane Porter, the professor and Esmeralda
occupied Clayton's car, while Tarzan took Mr. Philander in with
him.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed Mr. Philander, as the car moved off
after Clayton's machine. "Who would ever have thought it
possible! The last time I saw you you were a veritable wild man,
skipping about among the branches of a tropical African forest,
and now you are driving me along a Wisconsin road in a French
automobile. Bless me! But it is most remarkable."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Tarzan, and then, after a pause; "Mr.
Philander, do you recall any of the details of the finding and
burying of three skeletons found in my cabin beside that African
jungle?"</p>

<p>"Very distinctly, sir, very distinctly," replied Mr.
Philander.</p>

<p>"Was there anything peculiar about any of those
skeletons?"</p>

<p>Mr. Philander eyed Tarzan narrowly.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"It means a great deal to me to know," replied Tarzan. "Your
answer may clear up a mystery. It can do no worse, at any rate,
than to leave it still a mystery.</p>

<p>"I have been entertaining a theory concerning those skeletons
for the past two months, and I want you to answer my question to
the best of your knowledge&mdash;were the three skeletons you
buried all human skeletons?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Philander, "the smallest one, the one found in
the crib, was the skeleton of an anthropoid ape."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tarzan.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>In the car ahead, Jane Porter was thinking fast and furiously.
She had felt the purpose for which Tarzan had asked a few words
with her, and she knew that she must be prepared to give him an
answer in the very near future.</p>

<p>He was not the sort of person one could put off, and somehow
that very thought made her wonder if she did not really fear
him.</p>

<p>And could she love where she feared?</p>

<p>She realized the spell that had been upon her in the depths of
that far-off jungle, but there was no spell of enchantment now in
prosaic Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Nor did the immaculate young Frenchman appeal to the primal
woman in her, as had the stalwart forest god.</p>

<p>Did she love him? She did not know&mdash;now.</p>

<p>She glanced at Clayton out of the corner of her eye. Was not
here a man trained in the same school of environment in which she
had been trained&mdash;a man with social position and culture
such as she had been taught to consider as the prime essentials
to congenial association?</p>

<p>Did not her best judgment point to this young English
nobleman, whose love she knew to be of the sort a civilized woman
should crave, as the logical mate for such as herself?</p>

<p>Could she love Clayton? She could see no reason why she could
not. Jane Porter was not coldly calculating by nature, but
training, environment and heredity had all combined to teach her
to reason even in matters of the heart.</p>

<p>That she had been carried off her feet by the strength of the
young giant when his great arms were about her in the distant
African forest, and again today, in the Wisconsin woods, seemed
to her only attributable to a temporary mental reversion to type
on her part&mdash;to the psychological appeal of the primeval man
to the primeval woman in her nature.</p>

<p>If he should never touch her again, she reasoned, she would
never feel attracted toward him. She had not loved him, then. It
had been nothing more than a passing hallucination, superinduced
by excitement and by personal contact.</p>

<p>Excitement would not always mark their future relations,
should she marry him, and the power of personal contact
eventually would be dulled by familiarity.</p>

<p>Again she glanced at Clayton. He was very handsome and every
inch a gentleman. She should be very proud of such a husband.</p>

<p>And then he spoke&mdash;a minute sooner or a minute later
might have made all the difference in the world to three
lives&mdash;but chance stepped in and pointed out to Clayton the
psychological moment.</p>

<p>"You are free now, Jane," he said. "Won't you say yes&mdash;I
will devote my life to making you very happy."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p class="cp">*</p>

<p>That evening in the little waiting room at the station Tarzan
caught Jane Porter alone for a moment.</p>

<p>"You are free now, Jane," he said, "and I have come across the
ages out of the dim and distant past from the lair of the
primeval man to claim you&mdash;for your sake I have become a
civilized man&mdash;for your sake I have crossed oceans and
continents&mdash;for your sake I will be whatever you will me to
be. I can make you happy, Jane, in the life you know and love
best. Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>For the first time she realized the depths of the man's
love&mdash;all that he had accomplished in so short a time solely
for love of her. Turning her head she buried her face in her
arms.</p>

<p>What had she done? Because she had been afraid she might
succumb to the pleas of this giant, she had burned her bridges
behind her&mdash;in her groundless apprehension that she might
make a terrible mistake, she had made a worse one.</p>

<p>And then she told him all&mdash;told him the truth word by
word, without attempting to shield herself or condone her
error.</p>

<p>"What can we do?" he asked. "You have admitted that you love
me. You know that I love you; but I do not know the ethics of
society by which you are governed. I shall leave the decision to
you, for you know best what will be for your eventual
welfare."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell him, Tarzan," she said. "He, too, loves me, and
he is a good man. I could never face you nor any other honest
person if I repudiated my promise to Mr. Clayton.</p>

<p>"I shall have to keep it&mdash;and you must help me bear the
burden, though we may not see each other again after
tonight."</p>

<p>The others were entering the room now and Tarzan turned toward
the little window.</p>

<p>But he saw nothing without&mdash;within he saw a patch of
greensward surrounded by a matted mass of gorgeous tropical
plants and flowers, and, above, the waving foliage of mighty
trees, and, over all, the blue of an equatorial sky.</p>

<p>In the center of the greensward a young woman sat upon a
little mound of earth, and beside her sat a young giant. They ate
pleasant fruit and looked into each other's eyes and smiled. They
were very happy, and they were all alone.</p>

<p>His thoughts were broken in upon by the station agent who
entered, asking if there was a gentleman by the name of Tarzan in
the party.</p>

<p>"I am Monsieur Tarzan," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Here is a message for you, forwarded from Baltimore; it is a
cablegram from Paris."</p>

<p>Tarzan took the envelope and tore it open. The message was
from D'Arnot.</p>

<p>It read:</p> <BR>

<p class="telegram">FINGERPRINTS PROVE YOU GREYSTOKE.
CONGRATULATIONS. D'ARNOT.</p> <BR>

<p>As Tarzan finished reading Clayton entered and came toward him
with extended hand.</p>

<p>Here was the man who had Tarzan's title, and Tarzan's estates,
and was going to marry the woman whom Tarzan loved&mdash;the
woman who loved Tarzan. A single word from Tarzan would make a
great difference in this man's life.</p>

<p>It would take away his title and his lands and his castles,
and&mdash;it would take them away from Jane Porter also.</p>

<p>"I say, old man," cried Clayton, "I haven't had a chance to
thank you for all you've done for us. It seems as though you had
your hands full saving our lives in Africa and here.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad you came on here. We must get better
acquainted. I often thought about you, you know, and the
remarkable circumstances of your environment.</p>

<p>"If it's any of my business, how the devil did you ever get
into that bally jungle?"</p>

<p>"I was born there," said Tarzan, quietly. "My mother was an
ape, and of course she couldn't tell me much about it. I never
knew who my father was."</p>
