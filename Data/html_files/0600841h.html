<h2><a id="pt1"></a>PART I.</h2>

<p class="cp">"The wise men know what wicked things<br>
Are written on the sky;<br>
They trim sad lamps, they touch sad strings<br>
Hearing the heavy purple wings<br>
When the forgotten Seraph kings<br>
Still plot how God shall die."<br>
&mdash;Chesterton.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">1. &mdash; A MAN COMES SEEKING</a></h2>

<p class="first">A GREAT black shadow lay across the land, cleaving
the red flame of the red sunset. To the man who toiled up the
jungle trail it loomed like a symbol of death and horror, a menace
brooding and terrible, like the shadow of a stealthy assassin flung
upon some candle-lit wall.</p>

<p>Yet it was only the shadow of the great crag which reared up in
front of him, the first outpost of the grim foothills which were
his goal. He halted a moment at its foot, staring upward where it
rose blackly limned against the dying sun. He could have sworn that
he caught the hint of a movement at the top, as he stared, hand
shielding his eyes, but the fading glare dazzled him and he could
not be sure. Was it a man who darted to cover? A man,
or&mdash;?</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and fell to examining the rough trail
which led up and over the brow of the crag. At first glance it
seemed that only a mountain goat could scale it, but closer
investigation showed numbers of finger holds drilled into the solid
rock. It would be a task to try his powers to the utmost but he had
not come a thousand miles to turn back now.</p>

<p>He dropped the large pouch he wore at his shoulder, and laid
down the clumsy musket, retaining only his long rapier, dagger, and
one of his pistols; these he strapped behind him, and without a
backward glance over the darkening trail he had come, he started
the long ascent.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, long-armed and iron-muscled, yet again and
again he was forced to halt in his upward climb and rest for a
moment, clinging like an ant to the precipitous face of the cliff.
Night fell swiftly and the crag above him was a shadowy blur in
which he was forced to feel with his fingers, blindly, for the
holes which served him as a precarious ladder.</p>

<p>Below him, the night noises of the tropical jungle broke forth,
yet it appeared to him that even these sounds were subdued and
hushed, as though the great black hills looming above threw a spell
of silence and fear even over the jungle creatures.</p>

<p>On up he struggled, and now to make his way harder, the cliff
bulged outward near its summit, and the strain on nerve and muscle
became heart-breaking. Time and again a hold slipped and he escaped
falling by a hair's breadth. But every fibre in his lean hard body
was perfectly co-ordinated, and his fingers were like steel talons
with the grip of a vice. His progress grew slower and slower but on
he went until at last he saw the cliff's brow splitting the stars a
scant twenty feet above him.</p>

<p>And even as he looked, a vague bulk heaved into view, toppled on
the edge and hurtled down toward him with a great rush of air about
it. Flesh crawling, he flattened himself against the cliff's face
and felt a heavy blow against his shoulder, only a glancing blow,
but even so it nearly tore him from his hold, and as he fought
desperately to right himself, he heard a reverberating crash among
the rocks far below. Cold sweat beading his brow, he looked up.
Who&mdash;or what&mdash;had shoved that boulder over the cliff
edge? He was brave, as the bones on many a battlefield could
testify, but the thought of dying like a sheep, helpless and with
no chance of resistance, turned his blood cold.</p>

<p>Then a wave of fury supplanted his fear and he renewed his climb
with reckless speed. The expected second boulder did not come,
however, and no living thing met his sight as he clambered up over
the edge and leaped erect, sword flashing from its scabbard.</p>

<p>He stood upon a sort of plateau which debouched into a very
broken hilly country some half mile to the west. The crag he had
just mounted jutted out from the rest of the heights like a sullen
promontory, looming above the sea of waving foliage below, now dark
and mysterious in the tropic night.</p>

<p>Silence ruled here in absolute sovereignty. No breeze stirred
the sombre depths below, and no footfall rustled amid the stunted
bushes which cloaked the plateau, yet that boulder which had almost
hurled the climber to his death had not fallen by chance. What
beings moved among these grim hills? The tropical darkness fell
about the lone wanderer like a heavy veil through which the yellow
stars blinked evilly. The steams of the rotting jungle vegetation
floated up to him as tangible as a thick fog, and making a wry face
he strode away from the cliff, heading boldly across the plateau,
sword in one hand and pistol in the other.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable feeling of being watched in the very
air. The silence remained unbroken save for the soft swishing that
marked the stranger's cat-like tread through the tall upland grass,
yet the man sensed that living things glided before and behind him
and on each side. Whether man or beast trailed him he knew not, nor
did he care over-much, for he was prepared to fight human or devil
who barred his way. Occasionally he halted and glanced
challengingly about him, but nothing met his eye except the shrubs
which crouched like short dark ghosts about his trail, blended and
blurred in the thick, hot darkness through which the very stars
seemed to struggle, redly.</p>

<p>At last he came to the place where the plateau broke into the
higher slopes and there he saw a clump of trees blocked out solidly
in the lesser shadows. He approached warily, then halted as his
gaze, growing somewhat accustomed to the darkness, made out a vague
form among the sombre trunks which was not a part of them. He
hesitated. The figure neither advanced nor fled. A dim form of
silent menace, it lurked as if in wait. A brooding horror hung over
that still cluster of trees.</p>

<p><br>
THE stranger advanced warily, blade extended, closer, straining
his eyes for some hint of threatening motion. He decided that the
figure was human but he was puzzled at its lack of movement. Then
the reason became apparent&mdash;it was the corpse of a black man
that stood among those trees, held erect by spears through his
body, nailing him to the boles. One arm was extended in front of
him, held in place along a great branch by a dagger through the
wrist, the index finger straight as if the corpse pointed
stiffly&mdash;back along the way the stranger had come.</p>

<p>The meaning was obvious; that mute grim signpost could have but
one significance&mdash;death lay beyond. The man who stood gazing
upon that grisly warning rarely laughed, but now he allowed himself
the luxury of a sardonic smile. A thousand miles of land and
sea&mdash;ocean travel and jungle travel&mdash;and now they
expected to turn him back with such mummery&mdash;whoever they
were.</p>

<p>He resisted the temptation to salute the corpse, as an action
wanting in decorum, and pushed on boldly through the grove, half
expecting an attack from the rear or an ambush.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort occurred, however, and emerging from the
trees, he found himself at the foot of a rugged incline, the first
of a series of slopes. He strode stolidly upward in the night, nor
did he even pause to reflect how unusual his actions must have
appeared to a sensible man. The average man would have camped at
the foot of the crag and waited for morning before even attempting
to scale the cliffs. But this was no ordinary man. Once his
objective was in sight, he followed the straightest line to it,
without a thought of obstacles, whether day or night. What was to
be done, must be done. He had reached the outposts of the kingdom
of fear at dusk, and invading its inmost recesses by night seemed
to follow as a matter of course.</p>

<p>As he went up the boulder-strewn slopes the moon rose, lending
its air of illusion, and in its light the broken hills ahead loomed
up like the black spires of wizards' castles. He kept his eyes
fixed on the dim trail he was following, for he knew not when
another boulder might come hurtling down the inclines. He expected
an attack of any sort and, naturally, it was the unexpected which
really happened.</p>

<p>Suddenly from behind a great rock stepped a man, an ebony giant
in the pale moonlight, a long spear blade gleaming silver in his
hand, his headpiece of ostrich plumes floating above him like a
white cloud. He lifted the spear in a ponderous salute, and spoke
in the dialect of the river-tribes:</p>

<p>"This is not the white man's land. Who is my white brother in
his own kraal and why does he come into the Land of Skulls?"</p>

<p>"My name is Solomon Kane." the white man answered in the same
language. "I seek the vampire queen of Negari."</p>

<p>"Few seek. Fewer find. None return," answered the other
cryptically.</p>

<p>"Will you lead me to her?"</p>

<p>"You bear a long dagger in your right hand. There are no
lions&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"A serpent dislodged a boulder. I thought to find snakes in the
bushes."</p>

<p>The giant acknowledged this interchange of subtleties with a
grim smile, and a brief silence fell.</p>

<p>"Your life," said the black man presently, "is in my hand."</p>

<p>Kane smiled thinly. "I carry the lives of many warriors in my
hand."</p>

<p>The negro's gaze travelled uncertainly up and down the shimmery
length of the Englishman's sword. Then he shrugged his mighty
shoulders and let his spear point sink to the earth.</p>

<p>"You bear no gifts," said he; "but follow me and I will lead you
to the Terrible One, the Mistress of Doom, The Red Woman, Nakari,
who rules the land of Negari."</p>

<p>He stepped aside, and motioned Kane to precede him, but the
Englishman, his mind on a spear-thrust in the back, shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Who am I that I should walk in front of my brother? We be two
chiefs&mdash;let us walk side by side."</p>

<p>In his heart Kane railed that he should be forced to use such
unsavoury diplomacy with a black savage, but he showed no sign.
The giant bowed with a certain barbaric majesty and together they
went up the hill trail, unspeaking.</p>

<p>Kane was aware that men were stepping from hiding places and
falling in behind them, and a surreptitious glance over his
shoulder showed him some two score black warriors trailing out behind
them in two wedge-shaped lines. The moonlight glittered on black
bodies, on waving headgears and long, cruel spear blades.</p>

<p>"My brothers are like leopards," said Kane courteously; "they
lie in the low bushes and no eyes see them; they steal through the
high grass and no man hears their coming."</p>

<p>The black chief acknowledged the compliment with a courtly
inclination of his lion-like head, that set the plumes
whispering.</p>

<p>"The mountain leopard is our brother, oh chieftain. Our feet are
like drifting smoke but our arms are like iron. When they strike,
blood drips red and men die."</p>

<p>Kane sensed an undercurrent of menace in the tone. There was no
actual hint of threat on which he might base his suspicions, but
the sinister minor note was there. He said no more for a space and
the strange band moved silently upward in the moonlight like a
cavalcade of spectres.</p>

<p>The trail grew steeper and more rocky, winding in and out among
crags and gigantic boulders. Suddenly a great chasm opened before
them, spanned by a natural bridge of rock, at the foot of which the
leader halted.</p>

<p>Kane stared at the abyss curiously. It was some forty feet wide,
and looking down, his gaze was swallowed by impenetrable blackness,
hundreds of feet deep, he knew. On the other side rose crags dark
and forbidding.</p>

<p>"Here," said the black chief, "begin the true borders of Nakari's
realm."</p>

<p>Kane was aware that the warriors were casually closing in on
him. His fingers instinctively tightened about the hilt of the
rapier which he had not sheathed. The air was suddenly
super-charged with tension.</p>

<p>"Here, too," the black man said, "they who bring no gifts to
Nakari&mdash;die!"</p>

<p>The last word was a shriek, as if the thought had transformed
the speaker into a maniac, and as he screamed it, the great black arm
went back and then forward with a ripple of mighty muscles, and the
long spear leaped at Kane's breast.</p>

<p>Only a born fighter could have avoided that thrust. Kane's
instinctive action saved his life&mdash;the great blade grazed his
ribs as he swayed aside and returned the blow with a flashing
thrust that killed a warrior who jostled between him and the chief
at that instant.</p>

<p>Spears flashed in the moonlight and Kane, parrying one and
bending under the thrust of another, sprang out upon the narrow
bridge where only one could come at him at a time.</p>

<p>None cared to be first. They stood upon the brink and thrust at
him, crowding forward when he retreated, giving back when he
pressed them. Their spears were longer than his rapier, but he more
than made up for the difference and the great odds by his
scintillant skill and the cold ferocity of his attack.</p>

<p>They wavered back and forth and then suddenly a black giant leaped
from among his fellows and charged out upon the bridge like a wild
buffalo, shoulders hunched, spear held, low eyes gleaming with a
look not wholly sane. Kane leaped back before the onslaught, leaped
back again, striving to avoid that stabbing spear and to find an
opening for his point. He sprang to one side and found himself
reeling on the edge of the bridge with eternity gaping beneath him.
The warriors yelled in savage exultation as he swayed and fought
for his balance, and the giant on the bridge roared and plunged at
his rocking foe.</p>

<p>Kane parried with all his strength&mdash;a feat few swordsman
could have accomplished, off balance as he was&mdash;saw the cruel
spear blade flash by his cheek&mdash;felt himself falling backward
into the abyss. A desperate effort, and he gripped the spear shaft,
righted himself and ran the spearman through the body. The giant's
great red cavern of a mouth spouted blood and with a dying effort
he hurled himself blindly against his foe. Kane, with his heels
over the bridge's edge, was unable to avoid him and they toppled
over together, to disappear silently into the depths below.</p>

<p>So swiftly had it all happened that the warriors stood stunned.
The giant's roar of triumph had scarcely died on his lips before
the two were falling into the darkness. Now the rest of the natives
came out on the bridge to peer down curiously, but no sound came up
from the dark void.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">2. &mdash; THE PEOPLE OF THE
STALKING DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="cp">"Their gods were sadder than the sea<br>
Gods of wandering will,<br>
Who cried for blood like beasts at night<br>
Sadly, from hill to hill."<br>
&mdash;Chesterton.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p class="first">AS Kane fell he followed his fighting instinct,
twisting in midair so that when he struck, were it ten or a
thousand feet below, he would land on top of the man who fell with
him.</p>

<p>The end came suddenly&mdash;much more suddenly than the
Englishman had thought for. He lay half stunned for an instant,
then looking up, saw dimly the narrow bridge banding the sky above
him, and the forms of the warriors, limned in the moonlight and
grotesquely foreshortened as they leaned over the edge. He lay
still, knowing that the beams of the moon did not pierce the deeps
in which he was hidden, and that to those watchers he was
invisible. Then when they vanished from view he began to review his
present plight. The black man was dead, and only for the fact that
his corpse had cushioned the fall, Kane would have been dead
likewise, for they had fallen a considerable distance. As it was,
the Englishman was stiff and bruised.</p>

<p>He drew his sword from the native's body, thankful that it had
not been broken, and began to grope about in the darkness. His hand
encountered the edge of what seemed a cliff. He had thought that he
was on the bottom of the chasm and that its impression of great
depth had been a delusion, but now he decided that he had fallen on
a ledge, part of the way down. He dropped a small stone over the
side, and after what seemed a very long time he heard the faint
sound of its striking far below.</p>

<p>Somewhat at a loss as to how to proceed, he drew flint and steel
from his belt and struck them to some tinder, warily shielding the
light with his hands. The faint illumination showed a large ledge
jutting out from the side of the cliff, that is, the side next to
the hills, to which he had been attempting to cross. He had fallen
close to the edge and it was only by the narrowest margin that he
had escaped sliding off it, not knowing his position.</p>

<p>Crouching there, his eyes seeking to accustom themselves to the
abysmal gloom, he made out what seemed to be a darker shadow in the
shadows of the wall. On closer examination he found it to be an
opening large enough to admit his body standing erect. A cavern, he
assumed, and though its appearance was dark and forbidding in the
extreme, he entered, groping his way when the tinder burned
out.</p>

<p>Where it led to, he naturally had no idea, but any action was
preferable to sitting still until the mountain vultures plucked his
bones. For a long way the cave floor tilted upward&mdash;solid rock
beneath his feet&mdash;and Kane made his way with some difficulty
up the rather steep slant, slipping and sliding now and then. The
cavern seemed a large one, for at no time after entering it could
he touch the roof, nor could he, with a hand on one wall, reach the
other.</p>

<p>At last the floor became level and Kane sensed that the cave was
much larger there. The air seemed better, though the darkness was
just as impenetrable. Suddenly he stopped dead in his tracks. From
somewhere in front of him there came a strange indescribable
rustling. Without warning something smote him in the face and
slashed wildly. All about him sounded the eerie murmurings of many
small wings and suddenly Kane smiled crookedly, amused, relieved
and chagrined. Bats, of course. The cave was swarming with them.
Still, it was a shaky experience, and as he went on and the wings
whispered through the vast emptiness of the great cavern, Kane's
mind found space to dally with a bizarre thought&mdash;had he
wandered into Hell by some strange means, and were these in truth
bats, or were they lost souls winging through everlasting
night?</p>

<p>Then, thought Solomon Kane, I will soon confront Satan
himself&mdash;and even as he thought this, his nostrils were
assailed by a horrid scent, fetid and repellent. The scent grew as
he went slowly on, and Kane swore softly, though he was not a
profane man. He sensed that the smell betokened some hidden threat,
some unseen malevolence, inhuman and deathly, and his sombre mind
sprang at supernatural conclusions. However, he felt perfect
confidence in his ability to cope with any fiend or demon, armoured
as he was in unshakable faith of creed and the knowledge of the
rightness of his cause.</p>

<p>What followed happened suddenly. He was groping his way along
when in front of him two narrow yellow eyes leaped up in the
darkness&mdash;eyes that were cold and expressionless, too
hideously close-set for human eyes and too high for any four-legged
beast. What horror had thus reared itself up in front of him?</p>

<p>This is Satan, thought Kane as the eyes swayed above him, and
the next instant he was battling for his life with the darkness
that seemed to have taken tangible form and thrown itself about his
body and limbs in great slimy coils. Those coils lapped his sword
arm and rendered it useless; with the other hand he groped for
dagger or pistol, flesh crawling as his fingers slipped from slick
scales, while the hissing of the monster filled the cavern with a
cold paean of terror.</p>

<p>There in the black dark to the accompaniment of the bats'
leathery rustlings, Kane fought like a rat in the grip of a
mouse-snake, and he could feel his ribs giving and his breath going
before his frantic left hand closed on his dagger hilt.</p>

<p>Then with a volcanic twist and wrench of his steel-thewed body
he tore his left arm partly free and plunged the keen blade again
and again to the hilt in the sinuous writhing terror which
enveloped him, feeling at last the quivering coils loosen and slide
from his limbs to lie about his feet like huge cables.</p>

<p>The mighty serpent lashed wildly in its death struggles, and
Kane, avoiding its bone-shattering blows, reeled away in the
darkness, labouring for breath. If his antagonist had not been
Satan himself, it had been Satan's nearest earthly satellite,
thought Solomon, hoping devoutly that he would not be called upon
to battle another in the darkness there.</p>

<p><br>
IT seemed to him that he had been walking through the blackness
for ages, and he began to wonder if there were any end to the cave,
when a glimmer of light pierced the darkness. He thought it to be
an outer entrance a great way off, and started forward swiftly, but
to his astonishment, he brought up short against a blank wall after
taking a few strides.</p>

<p>Then he perceived that the light came through a narrow crack in
the wall, and feeling over this wall he found it to be of different
material from the rest of the cave, consisting, apparently, of
regular blocks of stone joined together with mortar of some
sort&mdash;an indubitably man-built wall.</p>

<p>The light streamed between two of these stones where the mortar
had crumbled away. Kane ran his hands over the surface with an
interest beyond his present needs. The work seemed very old and
very much superior to what might be expected of a tribe of ignorant
savages.</p>

<p>He felt the thrill of the explorer and discoverer. Certainly no
white man had ever seen this place and lived to tell of it, for
when he had landed on the dank West Coast some months before,
preparing to plunge into the interior, he had had no hint of such a
country as this. The few white men who knew anything at all of
Africa with whom he had talked, had never even mentioned the Land
of Skulls, or the she-fiend who ruled it.</p>

<p>Kane thrust against the wall cautiously. The structure seemed
weakened from age&mdash;a vigorous shove and it gave perceptibly.
He hurled himself against it with all his weight&mdash;and a whole
section of wall gave way with a crash, precipitating him into a
dimly lighted corridor amid a heap of stone, dust and mortar.</p>

<p>He sprang up and looked about, expecting the noise to bring a
horde of wild spearmen. Utter silence reigned. The corridor in
which he now stood was much like a long narrow cave itself, save
that it was the work of man. It was several feet wide and the roof
was many feet above his head. Dust lay ankle-deep on the floor as
if no foot had trod there for countless centuries, and the dim
light, Kane decided, filtered in somehow through the roof or
ceiling, for nowhere did he see any doors or windows. At last he
decided the source was the ceiling itself, which was of a peculiar
phosphorescent quality.</p>

<p>He set off down the corridor, feeling uncomfortably like a grey
ghost moving along the grey halls of death and decay. The evident
antiquity of his surroundings depressed him, making him sense
vaguely the fleeting and futile existence of mankind. That he was
now on top of the earth he believed, since light of a sort came in,
but where, he could not even offer a conjecture. This was a land of
enchantment&mdash;a land of horror and fearful mysteries, the
jungle and river natives had said, and he had gotten whispered
hints of its terrors ever since he had set his back to the Slave
Coast and ventured into the hinterlands alone.</p>

<p>Now and then he caught a low indistinct murmur which seemed to
come through one of the walls, and he at last came to the
conclusion that he had stumbled onto a secret passage in some
castle or house. The natives who had dared speak to him of Negari,
had whispered of a ju-ju city built of stone, set high amid the
grim black crags of the fetish hills.</p>

<p>Then, thought Kane, it may be that I have blundered upon the
very thing I sought and am in the midst of that city of terror. He
halted, and choosing a place at random, began to loosen the mortar
with his dagger. As he worked he again heard that low murmur,
increasing in volume as he bored through the wall, and presently
the point pierced through, and looking through the aperture it had
made, he saw a strange and fantastic scene.</p>

<p>He was looking into a great chamber, whose walls and floors were
of stone, and whose mighty roof was upheld by gigantic stone
columns, strangely carved. Ranks of feathered black warriors lined
the walls and a double column of them stood like statues before a
throne set between two stone dragons which were larger than
elephants. These men he recognized, by their bearing and general
appearance, to be tribesmen of the warriors he had fought at the
chasm. But his gaze was drawn irresistibly to the great,
grotesquely ornamented throne. There, dwarfed by the ponderous
splendour about her, a woman reclined. A black woman she was, young
and of a tigerish comeliness. She was naked except for a beplumed
helmet, armbands, anklets and a girdle of coloured ostrich
feathers, and she sprawled upon the silken cushions with her limbs
thrown about in voluptuous abandon.</p>

<p>Even at that distance Kane could make out that her features were
regal yet barbaric, haughty and imperious, yet sensual, and with a
touch of ruthless cruelty about the curl of full red lips. Kane
felt his pulse quicken. This could be no other than she whose
crimes had become almost mythical&mdash;Nakari of Negari, demon
queen of a demon city, whose monstrous lust for blood had set half
a continent shivering.</p>

<p>At least she seemed human enough; the tales of the fearful river
tribes had lent her a supernatural aspect. Kane had half expected
to see a loathsome semi-human monster out of some past and
demoniacal age.</p>

<p>The Englishman gazed, fascinated though repelled. Not even in
the courts of Europe had he seen such grandeur. The chamber and all
its accoutrements, from the carven serpents twined about the bases
of the pillars to the dimly seen dragons on the shadowy ceiling,
were fashioned on a gigantic scale. The splendour was
awesome&mdash;elephantine&mdash;inhumanly oversized, and almost
numbing to the mind which sought to measure and conceive the
magnitude thereof. To Kane it seemed that these things must have
been the work of gods rather than men, for this chamber alone would
dwarf most of the castles he had known in Europe.</p>

<p>The black people who thronged that mighty room seemed
grotesquely incongruous. They were not the architects of that
ancient place.</p>

<p>As Kane realized this, the sinister importance of Queen Nakari
dwindled. Sprawled on that august throne in the midst of the
terrific glory of another age, she seemed to assume her true
proportions, a spoiled, petulant child engaged in a game of
make-believe and using for her sport a toy discarded by her elders.
And at the same time a thought entered Kane's mind&mdash;who were
these elders?</p>

<p>Still, the child could become deadly in her game, as the
Englishman soon saw.</p>

<p>A tall, massive black came through the ranks fronting the
throne, and after prostrating himself four times before it,
remained on his knees, evidently waiting permission to speak. The
queen's air of lazy indifference fell from her, and she
straightened with a quick lithe motion that reminded Kane of a
leopardess springing erect. She spoke, and the words came faintly
to him as he strained his faculties to hear. She spoke in a
language very similar to that of the river tribes.</p>

<p>"Speak!"</p>

<p>"Great and Terrible One," said the kneeling warrior, and Kane
recognized him as the chief who had first accosted him on the
plateau&mdash;the chief of the guards on the cliffs, "let not the
fire of your fury consume your slave."</p>

<p>The young woman's eyes narrowed viciously.</p>

<p>"You know why you were summoned, son of a vulture?"</p>

<p>"Fire of Beauty, the stranger brought no gifts."</p>

<p>"No gifts?" she spat out the words. "What have I to do with
gifts? I bade you slay all black men who came empty-handed&mdash;
did I tell you to slay white men?"</p>

<p>"Gazelle of Negari, he came climbing the crags in the night like
an assassin, with a dagger as long as a man's arm in his hand. The
boulder we hurled down missed him, and we met him upon the plateau
and took him to the Bridge-Across-the-Sky, where, as is the custom,
we thought to slay him; for it was your word that you were weary of
men who came wooing you."</p>

<p>"Black men, fool," she snarled; "Black men!"</p>

<p>"Your slave did not know, Queen of Beauty. The strange man
fought like a mountain leopard. Two men he slew and fell with the
last one into the chasm, and so he perished, Star of Negari."</p>

<p>"Aye," the queen's tone was venomous. "The first great man who
ever came to Negari! One who might have&mdash;rise, fool!"</p>

<p>The man got to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mighty Lioness, might not this one have come
seeking&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was never completed. Even as he straightened,
Nakari made a swift gesture with her hand. Two warriors plunged
from the silent ranks and two spears crossed in the chief's body
before he could turn. A gurgling scream burst from his lips, blood
spurted high in the air and the corpse fell flatly at the foot of
the great throne.</p>

<p>The ranks never wavered, but Kane caught the sidelong flash of
strangely red eyes and the involuntary wetting of thick lips.
Nakari had half risen as the spears flashed, and now she sank back,
an expression of cruel satisfaction on her beautiful face and a
strange brooding gleam in her scintillant eyes.</p>

<p>An indifferent wave of her hand and the corpse was dragged away
by the heels, the dead arms trailing limply in the wide smear of
blood left by the passage of the body. Kane could see other wide
stains crossing the stone floor, some almost indistinct, others
less dim. How many wild scenes of blood and cruel frenzy had the
great stone throne-dragons looked upon with their carven eyes?</p>

<p>He did not doubt, now, the tales told him by the river tribes.
These people were bred in rapine and horror. Their prowess had
burst their brains. They lived, like some terrible beast, only to
destroy. There were strange gleams behind their eyes which at times
lit those eyes with up-leading flames and shadows of Hell. What had
the river tribes said of these mountain people who had ravaged them
for countless centuries?</p>

<p>"That they were henchmen of death, who stalked among them, and
whom they worshipped."</p>

<p>Still the thought hovered in Kane's mind as he watched&mdash;who
built this place, and why were these people evidently in
possession? Fighting men such as they were could not have reached
the culture evidenced by these carvings. Yet the river tribes had
spoken of no other men than those upon which he now looked.</p>

<p><br>
THE Englishman tore himself away from the fascination of the
barbaric scene with an effort. He had no time to waste; as long as
they thought him dead, he had more chance of eluding possible
guards and seeking what he had come to find. He turned and set off
down the dim corridor. No plan of action offered itself to his mind
and one direction was as good as another. The passage did not run
straight; it turned and twisted, following the line of the walls,
Kane supposed, and found time to wonder at the evident enormous
thickness of those walls. He expected at any moment to meet some
guard or slave, but as the corridors continued to stretch empty
before him, with the dusty floors unmarked by any footprint, he
decided that either the passages were unknown to the people of
Negari or else for some reason were never used.</p>

<p>He kept a close lookout for secret doors, and at last found one,
made fast on the inner side with a rusty bolt set in a groove of
the wall. This he manipulated cautiously, and presently with a
creaking which seemed terrifically loud in the stillness the door
swung inward. Looking out he saw no one, and stepping warily
through the opening, he drew the door to behind him, noting that it
assumed the part of a fantastic picture painted on the wall. He
scraped a mark with his dagger at the point where he believed the
hidden spring to be on the outer side, for he knew not when he
might need to use the passage again.</p>

<p>He was in a great hall, through which ran a maze of giant
pillars much like those of the throne chamber. Among them he felt
like a child in some great forest, yet they gave him some slight
sense of security since he believed that, gliding among them like a
ghost through a jungle, he could elude the black people in spite of
their craft.</p>

<p>He set off, choosing his direction at random and going
carefully. Once he heard a mutter of voices, and leaping upon the
base of a column, clung there while two black women passed directly
beneath him, but besides these he encountered no one. It was an
uncanny sensation, passing through this vast hall which seemed
empty of human life, but in some other part of which Kane knew
there might be throngs of people, hidden from sight by the
pillars.</p>

<p>At last, after what seemed an eternity of following these
monstrous mazes, he came upon a huge wall which seemed to be either
a side of the hall, or a partition, and continuing along this, he
saw in front of him a doorway before which two spearmen stood like
black statues.</p>

<p>Kane, peering about the corner of a column base, made out two
windows high in the wall, one on each side of the door, and noting
the ornate carvings which covered the walls, determined on a
desperate plan.</p>

<p>He felt it imperative that he should see what lay within that
room. The fact that it was guarded suggested that the room beyond
the door was either a treasure chamber or a dungeon, and he felt
sure that his ultimate goal would prove to be a dungeon.</p>

<p>Kane retreated to a point out of sight of the guards and began
to scale the wall, using the deep carvings for hand and foot holds.
It proved even easier than he had hoped, and having climbed to a
point level with the windows, he crawled cautiously along a
horizontal line, feeling like an ant on a wall.</p>

<p>The guards far below him never looked up, and finally he reached
the nearer window and drew himself up over the sill. He looked down
into a large room, empty of life, but equipped in a manner sensuous
and barbaric. Silken couches and velvet cushions dotted the floor
in profusion, and tapestries heavy with gold work hung upon tile
walls. The ceiling too was worked in gold.</p>

<p>Strangely incongruous, crude trinkets of ivory and ironwood,
unmistakably savage in workmanship, littered the place, symbolic
enough of this strange kingdom where signs of barbarism vied with a
strange culture. The outer door was shut and in the wall opposite
was another door, also closed.</p>

<p>Kane descended from the window, sliding down the edge of a
tapestry as a sailor slides down a sail-rope, and crossed the room.
His feet sank noiselessly into the deep fabric of the rug which
covered the floor, and which, like all the other furnishings,
seemed ancient to the point of decay.</p>

<p>At the door he hesitated. To step into the next room might be a
desperately hazardous thing to do; should it prove to be filled
with black men, his escape was cut off by the spearmen outside the
other door. Still, he was used to taking all sorts of wild chances,
and now, sword in hand, he flung the door open with a suddenness
intended to numb with surprise for an instant any foe who might be
on the other side.</p>

<p>Kane took a swift step within, ready for anything&mdash;then
halted suddenly, struck speechless and motionless for a second. He
had come thousands of miles in search of something, and there
before him lay the object of his search.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">3. &mdash; LILITH</a></h2>

<p class="cp">"Lady of mystery, what is thy history?<br>
&mdash;Viereck.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">A COUCH stood in the middle of the room, and on
its silken surface lay a woman&mdash;a woman whose skin was fair
and whose reddish gold hair fell about her bare shoulders. She now
sprang erect, fright flooding her fine grey eyes, lips parted to
utter a cry which she as suddenly checked.</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed. "How did you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Solomon Kane closed the door behind him and came toward her, a
rare smile on his dark face.</p>

<p>"You remember me, do you not, Marylin?"</p>

<p>The fear had already faded from her eyes even before he spoke,
to be replaced by a look of incredible wonder and dazed
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Captain Kane! I can not understand&mdash;it seemed no one would
ever come&mdash;"</p>

<p>She drew a small hand wearily across her brow, swaying
suddenly.</p>

<p>Kane caught her in his arms&mdash;she was only a child&mdash;and
laid her gently on the couch. There, chafing her wrists gently, he
talked in a low hurried monotone, keeping an eye on the door all
the time&mdash;which door, by the way, seemed to be the only
entrance or egress from the room. While he talked he mechanically
took in the chamber, noting that it was almost a duplicate of the
outer room as regards hangings and general furnishings.</p>

<p>"First," said he, "before, we go into any other matters, tell
me, are you closely guarded?"</p>

<p>"Very closely, sir," she murmured hopelessly, "I know not how
you came here, but we can never escape."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you swiftly how I came to be here, and mayhap you
will be more hopeful when I tell you of the difficulties already
overcome. Lie still now, Marylin, and I will tell you how I came to
seek an English heiress in the devil city of Negari.</p>

<p>"I killed Sir John Taferal in a duel. As to the reason, 'tis
neither here nor there, but slander and a black lie lay behind it.
Ere he died he confessed that he had committed a foul crime some
years agone. You remember, of course, the affection cherished for
you by your cousin, old Lord Hildred Taferal, Sir John's uncle? Sir
John feared that the old lord, dying without issue, might leave the
great Taferal estates to you.</p>

<p>"Years ago you disappeared, and Sir John spread the rumour that
you had drowned. Yet when he lay dying with my rapier through his
body, he gasped out that he had kidnapped you and sold you to a
Barbary rover, whom he named&mdash;a bloody pirate whose name has
not been unknown on England's coasts aforetime. So I came seeking
you, and a long weary trail it has been, stretching into long
leagues and bitter years.</p>

<p>"First I sailed the seas searching for El Gar, the Barbary
corsair named by Sir John. I found him in the crash and roar of an
ocean battle; he died, but even as he lay dying he told me that he
had sold you in turn to a merchant out of Stamboul. So to the
Levant I went and there by chance came upon a Greek sailor whom the
Moors had crucified on the shore for piracy. I cut him down and
asked him the question I asked all men&mdash;if he had in his
wanderings seen a captive English girl-child with yellow curls. I
learned that he had been one of the crew of the Stamboul merchants,
and that she had, on her homeward voyage, been set upon by a
Portuguese slaver and sunk&mdash;this renegade Greek and the child
being among the few who were taken aboard the slaver.</p>

<p>"This slaver then, cruising south for black ivory, had been
ambushed in a small bay on the African West Coast, and of your
further fate the Greek knew nothing, for he had escaped the general
massacre, and taking to sea in an open boat, had been taken up by a
ship of Genoese freebooters.</p>

<p>"To the West Coast, then, I came, on the slim chance that you
still lived, and there heard among the natives that some years ago
a white child had been taken from a ship whose crew had been slain,
and sent inland as a part of the tribute the shore tribes paid to
the upper river chiefs.</p>

<p>"Then all traces ceased. For months I wandered without a clue as
to your whereabouts, nay, without a hint that you even lived. Then
I chanced to hear among the river tribes of the demon city Negari
and the evil queen who kept a foreign woman for a slave. I came
here."</p>

<p>Kane's matter-of-fact tone, his unfurbished narration, gave no
hint of the full meaning of that tale&mdash;of what lay behind
those calm and measured words&mdash;the sea-fights and the land
fights&mdash;the years of privation and heart-breaking toil, the
ceaseless danger, the everlasting wandering through hostile and
unknown lands, the tedious and deadening labour of ferreting out
the information he wished from ignorant, sullen and unfriendly
savages, black and white.</p>

<p>"I came here," said Kane simply, but what a world of courage and
effort was symbolized by that phrase! A long red trail, black
shadows and crimson shadows weaving a devil's dance&mdash;marked by
flashing swords and the smoke of battle&mdash;by faltering words
falling like drops of blood from the lips of dying men.</p>

<p>Not a consciously dramatic man, certainly, was Solomon Kane. He
told his tale in the same manner in which he had overcome terrific
obstacles&mdash;coldly, briefly and without heroics.</p>

<p>"You see, Marylin," he concluded gently, "I have not come this
far and done this much, to now meet with defeat. Take heart, child.
We will find a way out of this fearful place."</p>

<p>"Sir John took me on his saddlebow." the girl said dazedly, and
speaking slowly as if her native language came strangely to her
from years of unuse, as she framed in halting words an English
evening of long ago. "He carried me to the seashore where a
galley's boat waited, filled with fierce men, dark and moustached
and having scimitars, and great rings to the fingers. The captain,
a Moslem with a face like a hawk, took me, a-weeping with fear, and
bore me to his galley. Yet he was kind to me in his way, I being
little more than a baby, and at last sold me to a Turkish merchant,
as he told you. This merchant he met off the southern coast of
France, after many days of sea travel.</p>

<p>"This man did not use me badly, yet I feared him, for he was a
man of cruel countenance and made me understand that I was to be
sold to a black sultan of the Moors. However, in the Gates of
Hercules his ship was set upon by a Cadiz slaver and things came
about as you have said.</p>

<p>"The captain of the slaver believed me to be the child of some
wealthy English family and intended holding me for ransom, but in a
grim darksome bay on the African coast he perished with all his men
except the Greek you have mentioned, and I was taken captive by a
savage chieftain.</p>

<p>"I was terribly afraid and thought he would slay me, but he did
me no harm and sent me upcountry with an escort, who also bore much
loot taken from the ship. This loot, together with myself, was, as
you know, intended for a powerful king of the river peoples. But it
never reached him, for a roving band of Negari fell upon the beach
warriors and slew them all. Then I was taken to this city, and have
since remained, slave to Queen Nakari.</p>

<p>"How I have lived through all those terrible scenes of battle
and cruelty and murder, I know not."</p>

<p>"A providence has watched over you, child," said Kane, "the
power which doth care for weak women and helpless children, which
led me to you in spite of all hindrances, and which shall yet lead
us forth from this place, God willing."</p>

<p>"My people!" she exclaimed suddenly like one awaking from a
dream, "what of them?"</p>

<p>"All in good health and fortune, child, save that they have
sorrowed for you through the long years. Nay, old Sir Hildred hath
the gout and doth so swear thereat that I fear for his soul at
times. Yet methinks that the sight of you, little Marylin, would
mend him."</p>

<p>"Still, Captain Kane," said the girl, "I can not understand why
you came alone."</p>

<p>"Your brothers would have come with me, child, but it was not
sure that you lived, and I was loth that any other Taferal should
die in a land far from good English soil. I rid the country of an
evil Taferal&mdash;'twas but just I should restore in his place a
good Taferal, if so be she still lived&mdash;I, and I alone."</p>

<p>This explanation Kane himself believed. He never sought to
analyse his motives and he never wavered once his mind was made up.
Though he always acted on impulse, he firmly believed that all his
actions were governed by cold and logical reasonings. He was a man
born out of his time&mdash;a strange blending of Puritan and
Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a
touch of the pagan, though the last assertion would have shocked
him unspeakably. An atavist of the days of blind chivalry he was, a
knight errant in the sombre clothes of a fanatic. A hunger in his
soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all
weaker things, avenge all crimes against right and justice. Wayward
and restless as the wind, he was consistent in only one
respect&mdash;he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such
was Solomon Kane.</p>

<p>"Marylin," he now said kindly, taking her small hands in his
sword-calloused fingers, "methinks you have changed greatly in the
years. You were a rosy and chubby little maid when I used to dandle
you on my knee in old England. Now you seem drawn and pale of face,
though you are beautiful as the nymphs of the heathen books. There
are haunting ghosts in your eyes, child&mdash;do they misuse you
here?"</p>

<p><br>
SHE lay back on the couch and the blood drained slowly from her
already pallid features until she was deathly white. Kane bent over
her, startled. Her voice came in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Ask me not. There are deeds better hidden in the darkness of
night and forgetfulness. There are sights which blast the eyes and
leave their burning mark forever on the brain. The walls of ancient
cities, recked not of by men, have looked upon scenes not to be
spoken of, even in whispers."</p>

<p>Her eyes closed wearily and Kane's troubled, sombre eyes
unconsciously traced the thin blue lines of her veins, prominent
against the unnatural whiteness of her skin.</p>

<p>"Here is some demoniacal thing," he muttered. "A
mystery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye," murmured the girl, "a mystery that was old when Egypt was
young! And nameless evil more ancient than dark Babylon&mdash;that
spawned in terrible black cities when the world was young and
strange."</p>

<p>Kane frowned, troubled. At the girl's strange words he felt an
eery crawling fear at the back of his brain, as if dim racial
memories stirred in the eon-deep gulfs, conjuring up grim chaotic
visions, illusive and nightmarish.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marylin sat erect, her eyes flaring wide with fright.
Kane heard a door open somewhere.</p>

<p>"Nakari!" whispered the girl urgently. "Swift! She must not find
you here! Hide quickly, and&mdash;" as Kane turned "&mdash;keep
silent, whatever may chance!"</p>

<p>She lay back on the couch, feigning slumber as Kane crossed the
room and concealed himself behind some tapestries which, hanging
upon the wall, hid a niche that might have once held a statue of
some sort.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done so when the single door of the room opened
and a strange barbaric figure stood framed in it. Nakari, queen of
Negari, had come to her slave.</p>

<p>The black woman was clad as she had been when he had seen her on the
throne, and the coloured armlets and anklets clanked as she closed
the door behind her and came into the room. She moved with the easy
sinuousness of a she-leopard and in spite of himself the watcher
was struck with admiration for her lithe beauty. Yet at the same
time a shudder of repulsion shook him, for her eyes gleamed with
vibrant and magnetic evil, older than the world.</p>

<p>"Lilith!" thought Kane. "She is beautiful and terrible as
Purgatory. She is Lilith&mdash;that foul, lovely woman of ancient
legend."</p>

<p>Nakari halted by the couch, stood looking down upon her captive
for a moment, then with an enigmatic smile, bent and shook her.
Marylin opened her eyes, sat up, then slipped from her couch and
knelt before her black mistress&mdash;an act which caused Kane to
curse beneath his breath. The queen laughed and, seating herself
upon the couch, motioned the girl to rise, and then put an arm
about her waist and drew her upon her lap. Kane watched, puzzled,
while Nakari caressed the girl in a lazy, amused manner. This might
be affection, but to Kane it seemed more like a sated leopard
teasing its victim. There was an air of mockery and studied cruelty
about the whole affair.</p>

<p>"You are very soft and pretty, Mara," Nakari murmured lazily,
"much prettier than the black girls who serve me. The time
approaches, little one, for your nuptial. And a fairer bride has
never been borne up the Black Stairs."</p>

<p>Marylin began to tremble and Kane thought she was going to
faint. Nakari's eyes gleamed strangely beneath her long-lashed
drooping lids, and her full red lips curved in a faint tantalizing
smile. Her every action seemed fraught with some sinister meaning.
Kane began to sweat profusely.</p>

<p>"Mara," said the black queen, "you are honoured above all other girls,
and yet you are not content. Think how the girls of Negari will
envy you, Mara, when the priests sing the nuptial song and the Moon
of Skulls looks over the black crest of the Tower of Death. Think,
little bride of the Master, how many girls have given their lives
to be his bride!"</p>

<p>And Nakari laughed in her hateful, musical way as at a rare
jest. And then suddenly she stopped short. Her eyes narrowed to
slits as they swept the room, and her whole body tensed. Her hand
went to her girdle and came away with a long thin dagger. Kane
sighted along the barrel of his pistol, finger against the trigger.
Only a natural hesitancy against shooting a woman kept him from
sending death into the black heart of Nakari, for he believed that
she was about to murder the girl.</p>

<p>Then, with a lithe, cat-like motion, she thrust the girl from
her knees and bounded back across the room, her eyes fixed with
blazing intensity on the tapestry behind which Kane stood. Had
those keen eyes discovered him? He quickly learned.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" she rapped out fiercely. "Who hides behind those
hangings? I do not see you nor hear you, but I know someone is
there!"</p>

<p>Kane remained silent. Nakari's wild beast instinct had betrayed
him, and he was uncertain as to what course to follow. His next
actions depended on the queen.</p>

<p>"Mara!" Nakari's voice slashed like a whip, "who is behind those
hangings? Answer me! Shall I give you a taste of the whip
again?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed incapable of speech. She cowered where she had
fallen, her beautiful eyes full of terror. Nakari, her blazing gaze
never wavering, reached behind her with her free hand and gripped a
cord hanging from the wall. She jerked viciously. Kane felt the
tapestries whip back on either side of him, and he stood
revealed.</p>

<p>For a moment the strange tableau held&mdash;the gaunt adventurer
in his blood-stained, tattered garments, the long pistol gripped in
his right hand&mdash;across the room the black queen in her
barbaric finery, one arm still lifted to the cord, the other hand
holding the dagger in front of her&mdash;the imprisoned girl
cowering on the floor.</p>

<p>Then Kane spoke: "Keep silent, Nakari, or you die!"</p>

<p>The queen seemed numbed and struck speechless by the sudden
apparition. Kane stepped from among the tapestries and slowly
approached her.</p>

<p>"You!" she found her voice at last. "You must be he of whom the
guardsmen spake! There are not two other white men in Negari! They
said you fell to your death! How then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" Kane's voice cut in harshly on her amazed babblings;
he knew that the pistol meant nothing to her, but she sensed the
threat of the long blade in his left hand. "Marylin," still
unconsciously speaking in the river tribes' language, "take cords
from the hangings and bind her&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about the middle of the chamber now. Nakari's face had
lost much of its helpless bewilderment and into her blazing eyes
stole a crafty gleam. She deliberately let her dagger fall as in
token of surrender, then suddenly her hands shot high above her
head and gripped another thick cord. Kane heard Marylin scream, but
before he could pull the trigger or even think, the floor fell
beneath his feet and he shot down into abysmal blackness. He did
not fall far and he landed on his feet; but the force of the fall
sent him to his knees and even as he went down, sensing a presence
in the darkness beside him, something crashed against his skull and
he dropped into a yet blacker abyss of unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="first">SLOWLY Kane drifted back from the dim realms where
the unseen assailant's bludgeon had hurled him. Something hindered
the motion of his hands, and there was a metallic clanking when he
sought to raise them to his aching, throbbing head.</p>

<p>He lay in utter darkness, but he could not determine whether
this was absence of light, or whether he was still blinded by the
blow. He dazedly collected his scattered faculties and realized
that he was lying on a damp stone floor, shackled by wrist and
ankle with heavy iron chains which were rough and rusty to the
touch.</p>

<p>How long he lay there, he never knew. The silence was broken
only by the drumming pulse in his own aching head and the scamper
and chattering of rats. At last a red glow sprang up in the
darkness and grew before his eyes. Framed in the grisly radiance
rose the sinister and sardonic face of Nakari. Kane shook his head,
striving to rid himself of the illusion. But the light grew and as
his eyes accustomed themselves to it, he saw that it emanated from
a torch borne in the hand of the queen.</p>

<p>In the illumination he now saw that he lay in a small dank cell
whose walls, ceiling and floor were of stone. The heavy chains
which held him captive were made fast to metal rings set deep in
the wall. There was but one door, which was apparently of
bronze.</p>

<p>Nakari set the torch in a niche near the door, and coming
forward, stood over her captive, gazing down at him in a manner
rather speculating than mocking.</p>

<p>"You are he who fought the men on the cliff." The remark was an
assertion rather than a question. "They said you fell into the
abyss&mdash;did they lie? Did you bribe them to lie? Or how did you
escape? Are you a magician and did you fly to the bottom of the
chasm and then fly to my palace? Speak!"</p>

<p>Kane remained silent. Nakari cursed.</p>

<p>"Speak or I will have your eyes torn out! I will cut your
fingers off and burn your feet!"</p>

<p>She kicked him viciously, but Kane lay silent, his deep sombre
eyes boring up into her face, until the feral gleam faded from her
eyes to be replaced by an avid interest and wonder.</p>

<p>She seated herself on a stone bench, resting her elbows on her
knees and her chin on her hands.</p>

<p>"I never saw a white man before," she said. "Are all white men
like you? Bah! That cannot be! Most men are fools, black or white.
I know most black men are fools, and white men are not gods as the
river tribes say&mdash;they are only men. I, who know all the ancient mysteries,
say they are only men.</p>

<p>"But white men have strange mysteries too, they tell
me&mdash;the wanderers of the river tribes and Mara. They have war
clubs that make a noise like thunder and kill afar off&mdash;that
thing which you held in your right hand, was that one of those
clubs?"</p>

<p>Kane permitted himself a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Nakari, if you know all mysteries, how can I tell you aught
that you know not already?"</p>

<p>"How deep and cold and strange your eyes are!" the queen said as
if he had not spoken. "How strange your whole appearance
is&mdash;and you have the bearing of a king! You do not fear
me&mdash;I never met a man who neither loved nor feared me. You
would never fear me, but you could learn to love me. Look at me,
bold one&mdash;am I not beautiful?"</p>

<p>"You are beautiful," answered Kane.</p>

<p>Nakari smiled and then frowned. "The way you say that, it is no
compliment. You hate me, do you not?"</p>

<p>"As a man hates a serpent," Kane replied bluntly.</p>

<p>Nakari's eyes blazed with almost insane fury. Her hands clenched
until the long nails sank into the palms; then as quickly as her
anger had arisen, it ebbed away.</p>

<p>"You have the heart of a king." she said calmly, "else you would
fear me. Are you a king in your land?"</p>

<p>"I am only a landless wanderer."</p>

<p>"You might be a king here," Nakari said slowly.</p>

<p>Kane laughed grimly. "Do you offer me my life?"</p>

<p>"I offer you more than that!"</p>

<p>Kane's eyes narrowed as the queen leaned toward him, vibrant
with suppressed excitement."Kane, what is it that you want more
than anything else in the world?"</p>

<p>"To take the white girl you call Mara, and go."</p>

<p>Nakari sank back with an impatient exclamation.</p>

<p>"You can not have her; she is the promised bride of the Master.
Even I could not save her, even if I wished. Forget her. I will
help you forget her. Listen, listen to the words of Nakari, queen
of Negari! You say you are a landless man&mdash;I will make you a
king! I will give you the world for a toy! "No, no! Keep silent
until I have finished," she rushed on, her words tumbling over each
other in her eagerness. Her eyes blazed, her whole body quivered
with dynamic intensity. "I have talked to travellers, to captives
and slaves, men from far countries. I know that this land of
mountains and rivers and jungle is not all the world. There are
far-off nations and cities, and kings and queens to be crushed and
broken.</p>

<p>"Negari is fading, her might is crumbling, but a strong man
beside her queen might build it up again&mdash;might restore all
her vanishing glory. Listen, Kane! Sit by me on the throne of
Negari! Send afar to your people for the thunder-clubs to arm my
warriors! My nation is still lord of central Africa. Together we
will band the conquered tribes&mdash;call back the days when the
realm of ancient Negari spanned the land from sea to sea! We will
subjugate all the tribes of the river, the plain and the sea-shore,
and instead of slaying them all, we will make one mighty army of
them! And then, when all Africa is under our heel, we will sweep
forth upon the world like a hungry lion to rend and tear and
destroy!"</p>

<p>Solomon's brain reeled. Perhaps it was the woman's fierce
magnetic personality, the dynamic power she instilled in her fiery
words, but at the moment her wild plan seemed not at all wild and
impossible. Lurid and chaotic visions flamed through the Puritan's
brain&mdash;Europe torn by civil and religious strife, divided
against herself, betrayed by her rulers, tottering&mdash;aye,
Europe was in desperate straits now, and might prove an easy victim
for some strong savage race of conquerors. What man can say
truthfully that in his heart there lurks not a yearning for power
and conquest?</p>

<p>For a moment the Devil sorely tempted Solomon Kane. Then before
his mind's eye rose the wistful, sad face of Marylin Taferal, and
Solomon cursed.</p>

<p>"Out on ye, daughter of Satan! Avaunt! Am I a beast of the
forest to lead your black devils against mine own people? Nay, no
beast ever did so. Begone! If you wish my friendship, set me free
and let me go with the girl."</p>

<p>Nakari leaped like a tiger-cat to her feet, her eyes flaming now
with passionate fury. A dagger gleamed in her hand and she raised
it high above Kane's breast with a feline scream of hate. A moment
she hovered like a shadow of death above him; then her arm sank and
she laughed. "Freedom? She will find her freedom when the Moon of
Skulls leers down on the black altar. As for you, you shall rot in
this dungeon. You are a fool; Africa's greatest queen has offered
you her love and the empire of the world&mdash;and you revile her!
You love the slave girl, perhaps? Until the Moon of Skulls she is
mine and I leave you to think about this: that she shall be
punished as I have punished her before&mdash;hung up by her wrists,
naked, and whipped until she swoons!"</p>

<p>Nakari laughed as Kane tore savagely at his shackles. She
crossed to the door, opened it, then hesitated and turned back for
another word.</p>

<p>"This is a foul place, bold one, and maybe you hate me the more
for chaining you here. Maybe in Nakari's beautiful throne room,
with wealth and luxury spread before you, you will look upon her
with more favour. Very soon I shall send for you, but first I will
leave you here awhile to reflect. Remember&mdash;love Nakari and
the kingdom of the world is yours; hate her&mdash;this cell is your
realm."</p>

<p>The bronze door clanged sullenly, but more hateful to the
imprisoned Englishman was the venomous, silvery laugh of
Nakari.</p>

<p><br>
TIME passed slowly in the darkness. After what seemed a long
time the door opened again, this time to admit a huge warrior who
brought food and a sort of thin wine. Kane ate and drank ravenously
and afterward slept. The strain of the last few days had worn him
greatly, mentally and physically, but when he awoke he felt fresh
and strong.</p>

<p>Again the door opened and two great black warriors entered. In
the light of the torches they bore, Kane saw that they were giants,
clad in loin-cloths and ostrich plume headgear, and bearing long
spears in their hands.</p>

<p>"Nakari wishes you to come to her, white man," was all they
said, as they took off his shackles. He arose, exultant in even
brief freedom, his keen brain working fiercely for a way of
escape.</p>

<p>Evidently the fame of his prowess had spread, for the two
warriors showed great respect for him. They motioned him to precede
them, and walked carefully behind him, the points of their spears
boring into his back. Though they were two to one, and he was
unarmed, they were taking no chances. The gazes they directed at
him were full of awe and suspicion.</p>

<p>Down a long, dark corridor they went, his captors guiding him
with light prods of their spears, up a narrow winding stair, down
another passageway, up another stair, and then they emerged into
the vast maze of gigantic pillars into which Kane had first come.
As they started down this huge hall, Kane's eyes suddenly fell on a
strange and fantastic picture painted on the wall ahead of him. His
heart gave a sudden leap as he recognized it. It was some distance
in front of him and he edged imperceptibly toward the wall until he
and his guards were walking along very close to it. Now he was
almost abreast of the picture and could even make out the mark his
dagger had made upon it.</p>

<p>The warriors following Kane were amazed to hear him gasp
suddenly like a man struck by a spear. He wavered in his stride and
began clutching at the air for support.</p>

<p>They eyed each other doubtfully and prodded him, but he cried
out like a dying man and slowly crumpled to the floor, where he lay
in a strange, unnatural position, one leg doubled back under him
and one arm half-supporting his lolling body.</p>

<p>The guards looked at him fearfully. To all appearances he was
dying, but there was no wound upon him. They threatened him with
their spears, but he paid no heed. Then they lowered their weapons
uncertainly and one of them bent over him.</p>

<p>Then it happened. The instant the black stooped forward, Kane
came up like a steel spring released. His right fist following his
motion curved up from the hip in a whistling half-circle and
crashed against the black giant's jaw. Delivered with all the power of
arm and shoulder, propelled by the upthrust of the powerful legs as
Kane straightened, the blow was like that of a sling-shot. The
guard slumped to the floor, unconscious before his knees gave
way.</p>

<p>The other warrior plunged forward with a bellow, but even as his
victim fell, Kane twisted aside, and his frantic hand found the
secret spring in the painting and pressed.</p>

<p>All happened in the breath of a second. Quick as the warrior
was, Kane was quicker, for he moved with the dynamic speed of a
famished wolf. For an instant, the falling body of the senseless
black hindered the other warrior's thrust, and in that instant Kane
felt the hidden door give way. From the corner of his eye he saw a
long gleam of steel shooting for his heart. He twisted about and
hurled himself against the door, vanishing through it even as the
stabbing spear slit the skin on his shoulder.</p>

<p>To the dazed and bewildered warrior, standing there with weapon
upraised for another thrust, it seemed as if his prisoner had
simply vanished through a solid wall, for only a fantastic picture
met his gaze and this did not give to his efforts.</p>

<h3>THE STORY THUS FAR</h3>

<p class="first">SOLOMON KANE, and English Puritan adenturer,
searches for Marylin Taferel, who has been sold by her
treacherous guardian to Moslem slave-traders, and finds her in
the interior of Africa, where she is slave to Nakari, the black
vampire queen of the nightmare city of Negari. Kane is captured
but escapes through a panel in the walls of the underground
passages of Negari. Marylin is made ready to be sacrificed to
Nakura, God of the Skull, at the full of the moon.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">5. &mdash; "FOR A THOUSAND
YEARS&mdash;"</a></h2>

<p class="cp">The blind gods roar and rave and dream<br>
Of all cities under the sea." &mdash;Chesterton.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">KANE slammed the hidden door shut behind him,
jammed down the spring and for a moment leaned against it, every
muscle tensed, expecting to hold it against the efforts of a
horde of spearmen. But nothing of the sort materialized. He heard
the black warrior fumbling outside for a time; then that sound,
too, ceased. It seemed impossible that these people should have
lived in this palace as long as they had without discovering the
secret doors and passages, but it was a conclusion which forced
itself upon Kane's mind.</p>

<p>At last he decided that he was safe from pursuit for the time
being, and turning, started down the long, narrow corridor with its
eon-old dust and its dim grey light. He felt baffled and furious,
though he was free from Nakari's shackles. He had no idea how long
he had been in the palace; it seemed ages. It must be day now, for
it was light in the outer halls, and he had seen no torches after
they had left the subterranean dungeons.</p>

<p>He wondered if Nakari had carried out her threat of vengeance on
the helpless girl, and swore passionately. Free for the time being,
yes; but unarmed and hunted through this infernal palace like a
rat. How could he aid either himself or Marylin? But his confidence
never faltered. He was in the right, and some way would present
itself.</p>

<p>Suddenly a narrow stairway branched off the main passageway, and
up this he went, the light growing stronger and stronger until he
stood in the full glare of the African sunlight. The stair
terminated in a sort of small landing directly in front of which
was a tiny window, heavily barred. Through this he saw the blue sky
tinted gold with the blazing sunlight; the sight was like wine to
him and he drew in deep breaths of fresh, untainted air, breathing
deep as if to rid his lungs of the aura of dust and decayed
grandeur through which he had been passing.</p>

<p>He was looking out over a weird and bizarre landscape. Far to
the right and the left loomed up great black crags and beneath them
there reared castles and towers of stone, of strange
architecture&mdash;it was as if giants from some other planet had
thrown them up in a wild and chaotic debauch of creation. These
buildings were backed solidly against the cliffs, and Kane knew
that Nakari's palace also must be built into the wall of the crag
behind it. He seemed to be in the front of that palace in a sort of
minaret built on the outer wall. But there was only one window in
it and his view was limited.</p>

<p>Far below him through the winding and narrow streets of that
strange city, swarms of black people went to and fro, seeming
like black ants to the watcher above. East, north and south, the
cliffs formed a natural bulwark; only to the west was a built
wall.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking west. Kane turned reluctantly from the
barred window and went down the stairs again. Again he paced down
the narrow grey corridor, aimlessly and planlessly, for what seemed
miles and miles. He descended lower and lower into passages that
lay below passages. The light grew dimmer, and a dank slime
appeared on the walls. Then Kane halted, a faint sound from beyond
the wall arresting him. What was that? A faint rattle&mdash;the
rattle of chains.</p>

<p>Kane leaned close to the wall, and in the semi-darkness his hand
encountered a rusty spring. He worked at it cautiously and
presently felt the hidden door it betokened swing inward. He gazed
out warily.</p>

<p>He was looking into a cell, the counterpart of the one in
which he had been confined. A smouldering torch was thrust into a
niche on the wall, and by its lurid and flickering light he made
out a form on the floor, shackled wrist and ankle as he had been
shackled. A man; at first Kane thought him to be a negro, but a
second glance made him doubt. The hair was too straight, the
features too regular. Negroid, yes, but some alien blood in his
veins had sharpened those features and had given the man that
high, magnificent forehead and those vibrant eyes which stared at
Kane so intensely. The skin was dark, but not black.</p>

<p>The man spoke in an unfamiliar dialect, one which was strangely
distinct and clear-cut in contrast to the guttural jargon of the
black people with whom Kane was familiar. The Englishman spoke in
English, and then in the language of the river tribes.</p>

<p>"You who come through the ancient door," said the other in the
latter dialect, "who are you? You are no black man&mdash;at first I
thought you one of the Old Race, but now I see you are not as they.
Whence come you?"</p>

<p>"I am Solomon Kane," said the Puritan, "a prisoner in this
devil-city. I come from far across the blue salt sea."</p>

<p>The man's eyes lighted at the word.</p>

<p>"The sea! The ancient and everlasting! The sea which I have
never seen, but which cradled the glory of my ancestors! Tell me,
stranger, have you, like they, sailed across the breast of the
great blue monster, and have your eyes looked on the golden spires
of Atlantis and the crimson walls of Mu?"</p>

<p>"Truly," answered Solomon uncertainly. "I have sailed the seas,
even to Hindustan and Cathay, but of the countries you mention I
know nothing."</p>

<p>"Nay," the other sighed. "I dream&mdash;I dream. Already the
shadow of the great night falls across my brain and my words
wander. Stranger, there have been times when these cold walls and
floor have seemed to melt into green, surging deeps and my soul was
filled with the deep booming of the everlasting sea. I who have
never seen the sea!"</p>

<p>Kane shuddered involuntarily. Surely this man was insane.
Suddenly the other shot out a withered, claw-like hand and gripped
his arm, despite the hampering chain.</p>

<p>"You whose skin is so strangely fair! Have you seen Nakari, the
she-fiend who rules this crumbling city?"</p>

<p>"I have seen her," said Kane grimly, "and now I flee like a
hunted rat from her murderers."</p>

<p>"You hate her!" the other cried. "Ha, I know! You seek Mara, the
white girl who is her slave?"</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"Listen," the shackled one spoke with strange solemnity. "I am
dying. Nakari's rack has done its work. I die and with me dies the
shadow of the glory that was my nation's. For I am the last of my
race. In all the world there is none like me. Hark now, to the
voice of a dying race."</p>

<p>And Kane, leaning there in the flickering semi-darkness of the
cell, heard the strangest tale to which man has ever listened,
brought out of the mist of the dim dawn ages by the lips of
delirium. Clear and distinct the words fell from the dying man and
Kane alternately burned and froze as vista after gigantic vista of
time and space swept up before him.</p>

<p><br>
"LONG aeons ago&mdash;ages, ages ago&mdash;the empire of my race
rose proudly above the waves. So long ago was it that no man
remembers an ancestor who remembered it. In a great land to the
west our cities rose. Our golden spires split the stars; our
purple-prowed galleys broke the waves around the world, looting the
sunset for its treasure and the sunrise for its wealth.</p>

<p>"Our legions swept forth to the north and to the south, to the
west and the east, and none could stand before them. Our cities
banded the world; we sent our colonies to all lands to subdue all
savages, red, white or black, and enslave them. They toiled for us
in the mines and at the galley's oars. All over the world the
people of Atlantis reigned supreme. We were a sea-people, and we
delved the deeps of all the oceans. The mysteries were known to us,
and the secret things of land and sea and sky. We read the stars
and were wise. Sons of the sea, we exalted him above all
others.</p>

<p>"We worshipped Valka and Hotah, Honen and Golgor. Many virgins,
many strong youths, died on their altars and the smoke of the
shrines blotted out the sun. Then the sea rose and shook himself.
He thundered from his abyss and the thrones of the world fell
before him! New lands rose from the deep and Atlantis and Mu were
swallowed up by the gulf. The green sea roared through the fanes
and the castles, and the sea-weed encrusted the golden spires and
the topaz towers. The empire of Atlantis vanished and was
forgotten, passing into the everlasting gulf of time and oblivion.
Likewise the colony cities in barbaric lands, cut off from their
mother kingdom, perished. The black savage rose and burned and
destroyed until in all the world only the colony city of Negari
remained as a symbol of the lost empire.</p>

<p>"Here my ancestors ruled as kings, and the ancestors of
Nakari&mdash;the she-cat&mdash;bent the knee of slavery to them.
Years passed, stretching into centuries. The empire of Negari
dwindled. Tribe after tribe rose and flung off the chains, pressing
the lines back from the sea, until at last the sons of Atlantis
gave way entirely and retreated into the city itself&mdash;the last
stronghold of the race. Conquerors no longer, hemmed in by
ferocious tribes, yet they held those tribes at bay for a thousand
years. Negari was invincible from without; her walls held firm; but
within evil influences were at work.</p>

<p>"The sons of Atlantis had brought their black slaves into the city
with them. The rulers were warriors, scholars, priests, artisans;
they did no menial work. For that they depended upon the slaves.
There were more of these slaves than there were masters. And they
increased while the sons of Atlantis dwindled.</p>

<p>"They mixed with each other more and more as the race
degenerated until at last only the priestcraft was free of the
taint of black blood. Rulers sat on the throne of Negari who
possessed little of the blood of Atlantis, and these allowed more
and more wild tribesmen to enter the city in the guise of servants,
mercenaries and friends.</p>

<p>"Then came a day when these fierce slaves revolted and slew all
who bore a trace of the blood of Atlantis, except the priests and
their families. These they imprisoned as 'fetish people'. For a
thousand years savages have ruled in Negari, their kings guided by
the captive priests, who though prisoners, were yet the masters of
kings. For a thousand years black men have ruled in Negari,
their kings guided by the captive brown priests, who though
prisoners, were yet the masters of kings."</p>

<p>Kane listened enthralled. To his imaginative mind, the tale
burned and lived with strange fire from cosmic time and space.</p>

<p>"After all the sons of Atlantis, save the priests, were dead,
there rose a great black king to the defiled throne of ancient Negari. He
was a tiger and his warriors were like leopards. They called
themselves Negari, ravishing even the name of their former masters,
and none could stand before them. They swept the land from sea to
sea, and the smoke of destruction put out the stars. The great
river ran red and the black lords of Negari strode above the corpses
of their black foes. Then the great king died and the black empire
crumbled, even as the Atlantean kingdom of Negari had crumbled.</p>

<p>"They were skilled in war. The dead sons of Atlantis, their
former masters, had trained them well in the ways of battle, and
against the wild tribesmen they were invincible. But only the ways
of war had they learned, and the empire was torn with civil strife.
Murder and intrigue stalked redhanded through the palaces and the
streets, and the boundaries of the empire dwindled and dwindled.
All the while, black kings with red, frenzied brains sat on the
throne, and behind the curtains, unseen but greatly feared, the
Atlantean priests guided the nation, holding it together, keeping
it from absolute destruction.</p>

<p>"Prisoners in the city were we, for there was nowhere else in
the world to go. We moved like ghosts through the secret passages
in the walls and under the earth, spying on intrigue and doing
secret magic. We upheld the cause of the royal family&mdash;the
descendants of that tiger-like king of long ago&mdash;against all
plotting chiefs, and grim are the tales which these silent walls
could tell. Fpr these black people are not a other negroes. A
latent insanity lurks in the brains of every one. They have tasted
so deeply and so long of slaughter and victory that they are as
human leopards, forever thirsting for blood. On their myriad
wretched slaves they have sated all lusts and desires until they
have become foul and terrible beasts, forever seeking some new
sensation, forever quenching their fearful thirsts in blood.</p>

<p>"Like a lion have they lurked in these crags for a thousand
years, to rush forth and ravage the jungle and river people,
enslaving and destroying. They are still invincible from without,
though their possessions have dwindled to the very walls of this
city, and their former great conquests and invasions have dwindled
to raids for slaves.</p>

<p>"But as they faded, so too faded their secret masters, the
Atlantean priests. One by one they died, until only I remained. In
the last century they too have mixed with their rulers and slaves,
and now&mdash;oh, black the shame upon me!&mdash;I, the last son of
Atlantis, bear in my veins the taint of barbarian blood. They died;
I remained, doing magic and guiding the black kings, I the last
priest of Negari. Then the she-fiend, Nakari, arose."</p>

<p>Kane leaned forward with quickened interest. New life surged
into the tale as it touched upon his own time.</p>

<p>"Nakari!" the name was spat as a snake hisses; "slave and the
daughter of a slave! Yet she prevailed when her hour came and all
the royal family died.</p>

<p>"And me, the last son of Atlantis, me she prisoned and chained.
She feared not the silent Atlantean priests, for she was the
daughter of a Satellite&mdash;one of the lesser priests, black
men who did the menial work of the brown
masters&mdash;performing the lesser sacrifices, divining from the
livers of fowls and serpents and keeping the holy fires for ever
burning. Much she knew of us and our ways, and evil ambition burned
in her.</p>

<p>"As a child she danced in the March of the New Moon, and as a
young girl she was one of the Starmaidens. Much of the lesser
mysteries was known to her, and more she learned, spying upon the
secret rites of the priests who enacted hidden rituals that were
old when the earth was young.</p>

<p>"For the remnants of Atlantis secretly kept alive the old
worships of Valka and Hotah, Honen and Golgor, long forgotten and
not to be understood by these black people whose ancestors died
screaming on their altars. Alone of all the savage Negari, she
feared us not. Nakari not only overthrew the king and set herself
on the throne, but she dominated the priests&mdash;the black Satellites
and the few Atlantean masters who were left. All these last, save
me, died beneath the daggers of her assassins or on her racks. She
alone of all the myriad black thousands who have lived and died
between these walls guessed at the hidden passages and subterranean
corridors, secrets which we of the priestcraft had guarded
jealously from the people for a thousand years.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Blind, black fools! To pass an ageless age in this
city, yet never to learn of the secrets thereof! Black apes&mdash;fools!
Not even the lesser black priests know of the long grey corridors, lit by
phosphorescent ceilings, through which in bygone ages strange forms
have glided silently. For our ancestors built Negari as they built
Atlantis on a mighty scale and with an unknown art. Not for men
alone did we build, but for the gods who moved unseen among us. And
deep the secrets these ancient walls hold!</p>

<p>"Torture could not wring these secrets from our lips, but
shackled in her dungeons, we trod our hidden corridors no more. For
years the dust has gathered there, untouched by human foot, while
we, and finally I alone, lay chained in these foul cells. And among
the temples and the dark, mysterious shrines of old, move vile black
Satellites, elevated by Nakari to glories that were once
mine&mdash;for I am the last Atlantean high priest.</p>

<p>"Black will be their doom, and red will be their ruin! Valka
and Golgor, gods lost and forgotten, whose memory shall die with
me, strike down their walls and humble them unto the dust! Break
the altars of their blind pagan gods&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kane realized that the man was wandering in his mind. The keen
brain had begun to crumble at last.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said he; "you mentioned the fair girl. Mara. What do
you know of her?"</p>

<p><br>
"SHE was brought to Negari years ago by raiders," the other
answered, "only a few years after the rise of the black queen,
whose slave she is. Little of her I know, for shortly after her
arrival, Nakari turned on me&mdash;and the years that lie between
have been grim black years, shot red with torture and agony. Here I
have lain, hampered by my chains from escape which lay in that door
through which you entered&mdash;and for the knowledge of which
Nakari has torn me on racks and suspended me over slow fires."</p>

<p>Kane shuddered. "You know not if they have so misused the white
girl? Her eyes are haunted and she has wasted away."</p>

<p>"She has danced with the Starmaidens at Nakari's command, and
has looked on the bloody and terrible rites of the Black Temple.
She has lived for years among a people with whom blood is cheaper
than water, who delight in slaughter and foul torture, and such
sights as she has looked upon would blast the eyes and wither the
flesh of strong men. She has seen the victims of Nakura die amid
horrid torments, and the sight is burned forever in the brain of
the beholder. The rites of the Atlanteans the savages took whereby
to honour their own crude gods, and though the essence of those
rites is lost in the wasting years, yet even Nakari's black apes
perform them; they are not such as men can look on, unshaken."</p>

<p>Kane was thinking, "A fair day for the world when this Atlantis
sank, for most certainly it bred a race of strange and unknown
evil." Aloud he said, "Who is this Master of whom Nakari spake, and
what meant she by calling Mara his bride?"</p>

<p>"Nakura&mdash;Nakura. The skull of evil, the symbol of Death
that they worship. What know these savages of the gods of sea-girt
Atlantis? What know they of the dread and unseen gods whom their
masters worshipped with majestic and mysterious rites? They
understand not of the unseen essence, the invisible deity that
reigns in the air and the elements; they must worship a material
object, endowed with human shape. Nakura was the last great wizard
of Atlantean Negari. A renegade he was, who conspired against his
own people and aided the revolt of the black beasts. In life they
followed him and in death they deified him. High in the Tower of
Death his fleshless skull is set, and on that skull hinge the
brains of all the people of Negari.</p>

<p>"Nay, we of Atlantis worshipped Death, but we likewise
worshipped Life. These people worship only Death and call
themselves Sons of Death. And the skull of Nakura has been to them
for a thousand years the symbol of their power, the evidence of
their greatness."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," Kane broke in impatiently on these ramblings,
"that they will sacrifice the girl to their god?"</p>

<p>"In the Moon of Skulls she will die on the Black Altar."</p>

<p>"What in God's name is this Moon of Skulls?" Kane cried
passionately.</p>

<p>"The full moon. At the full of each moon, which we name the Moon
of Skulls, a virgin dies on the Black Altar before the Tower of
Death, where centuries ago, virgins died in honour of Golgor, the
god of Atlantis. Now from the face of the tower that once housed
the glory of Golgor, leers down the skull of the renegade wizard,
and the people believe that his brain still lives therein to guide
the star of the city. For look ye, stranger, when the full moon
gleams over the rim of the tower and the chant of the priests falls
silent, then from the skull of Nakura thunders a great voice,
raised in an ancient Atlantean chant, and the people fall on their
faces before it.</p>

<p>"But hark, there is a secret way, a stair leading up to a hidden
niche behind the skull, and there a priest lurks and chants. In
days gone by one of the sons of Atlantis had this office, and by
all rights of men and gods it should be mine this day. For though
we sons of Atlantis worshipped our ancient gods in secret, the
black people would have none of them. To hold our power we were devotees
to their foul gods and we sang and sacrificed to him whose memory
we cursed.</p>

<p>"But Nakari discovered the secret, known before only to the
Atlantean priests, and now one of her black Satellites mounts the hidden
stair and yammers forth the strange and terrible chant which is but
meaningless gibberish to him, as to those who hear it. I, and only
I, know its grim and fearful meaning."</p>

<p>Kane's brain whirled in his efforts to formulate some plan of
action. For the first time during the whole search for the girl, he
felt himself against a blank wall. The palace was a labyrinth, a
maze in which he could decide no direction. The corridors seemed to
run without plan or purpose, and how could he find Marylin,
prisoned as she doubtless was in one of the myriad chambers or
cells? Or had she already passed over the borderline of life, or
succumbed to the brutal torture-lust of Nakari?</p>

<p>He scarcely heard the ravings and mutterings of the dying
man.</p>

<p>"Stranger, do you indeed live or are you but one of the ghosts
which have haunted me of late, stealing through the darkness of
my cell? Nay, you are flesh and blood&mdash;but you are a savage,
even as Nakari's race are black savages. Aeons ago when your
ancestors were defending their caves against the tiger and the
mammoth, with crude spears of flint, the gold spires of my people
split the stars. They are gone and forgotten, and the world is a
waste of barbarians, white and black. Let me, too, pass as a
dream that is forgotten in the mists of the ages&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kane rose and paced the cell. His fingers closed like steel
talons as on a sword hilt and a blind red wave of fury surged
through his brain. Oh God! to get his foes before the keen blade
that had been taken from him&mdash;to face the whole city, one man
against them all&mdash;</p>

<p>Kane pressed his hands against his temples.</p>

<p>"The moon was nearly full when last I saw it. But I know not how
long ago that was. I know not how long I have been in this accursed
palace, or how long I lay in that dungeon where Nakari threw me.
The time of full moon may be past, and&mdash;oh merciful
God!&mdash;Marylin may be dead already."</p>

<p>"Tonight is the Moon of Skulls," muttered the other; "I heard
one of my jailers speak of it."</p>

<p>Kane gripped the dying man's shoulder with unconscious
force.</p>

<p>"If you hate Nakari or love mankind, in God's name tell me how
to save the child."</p>

<p>"Love mankind?" the priest laughed insanely. "What has a son of
Atlantis and a priest of forgotten Golgor to do with love? What are
mortals but food for the jaws of the black gods? Softer girls than your
Mara have died screaming beneath these hands and my heart was as
iron to their cries. Yet hate&mdash;" the strange eyes flamed with
fearful light "&mdash;for hate I will tell you what you wish to
know!</p>

<p>"Go to the Tower of Death when the moon is risen. Slay the black
priest who lurks behind the skull of Nakura, and then when the
chanting of the worshippers below ceases, and the masked slayer
beside the Black Altar raises the sacrificial dagger, speak in a
loud voice that the people can understand, bidding them set free
the victim and offer up instead, Nakari, queen of Negari!</p>

<p>"As for the rest, afterward you must rely on your own craft and
prowess if you come free."</p>

<p>Kane shook him.</p>

<p>"Swift! Tell me how I am to reach this tower!"</p>

<p>"Go back through the door whence you came." The man was sinking
fast, his words dropped to whispers. "Turn to the left and go a
hundred paces. Mount the stair you come to, as high as it goes. In
the corridor where it ceases go straight for another hundred paces,
and when you come to what seems a blank wall, feel over it until
you find a projecting spring. Press this and enter the door which
will open. You will then be out of the palace and in the cliffs
against which it is built, and in the only one of the secret
corridors known to the people of Negari. Turn to your right and go
straight down the passage for five hundred paces. There you will
come to a stair, which leads up to the niche behind the skull. The
Tower of Death is built into the cliff and projects above it. There
are two stairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice trailed out. Kane leaned forward and shook
the man, and the priest suddenly rose up with a great effort. His
eyes blazed with a wild and unearthly light and he flung his
shackled arms wide.</p>

<p>"The sea!" he cried in a great voice. "The golden spires of
Atlantis and the sun on the deep blue waters! I come!"</p>

<p>And as Kane reached to lay him down again, he slumped back,
dead.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">6. &mdash; THE SHATTERING OF THE
SKULL</a></h2>

<p class="cp">"By thought a crawling ruin,<br>
By life a leaping mire,<br>
By a broken heart in the breast of the world,<br>
And the end of the world's desire."<br>
&mdash;Chesterton</p>

<br>

<p class="first">KANE wiped the cold sweat from his pale brow as he
hurried down the shadowy passage. Outside this horrible palace it
must be night. Even now the full moon&mdash;the grim Moon of
Skulls&mdash;might be rising above the horizon. He paced off a
hundred paces and came upon the stair the dying priest had
mentioned.</p>

<p>This he mounted, and coming into the corridor above, he measured
off another hundred paces and brought up short against what
appeared to be a doorless wall. It seemed an age before his frantic
fingers found a piece of projecting metal. There was a creak of
rusty hinges as the hidden door swung open and Kane looked into a
passageway darker than the one in which he stood.</p>

<p>He entered, and when the door shut behind him he turned to his
right and groped his way along for five hundred paces. There the
corridor was lighter; light sifted in from without, and Kane
discerned a stairway. Up this he went for several steps, then
halted, baffled. At a sort of landing the stairway became two, one
leading away to the left, the other to the right. Kane cursed. He
felt that he could not afford to make a mistake&mdash;time was too
precious&mdash;but how was he to know which would lead him to the
niche where the priest hid?</p>

<p>The Atlantean had been about to tell him of these stairs when
struck by the delirium which precedes death, and Kane wished
fervently that he had lived only a few moments longer.</p>

<p>At any rate, he had no time to waste; right or wrong, he must
chance it. He chose the right hand stair and ran swiftly up it. No
time for caution now.</p>

<p>He felt instinctively that the time of sacrifice was close at
hand. He came into another passage and discerned by the change in
masonry that he was out of the cliffs again and in some
building&mdash;presumably the Tower of Death. He expected any
moment to come upon another stair, and suddenly his expectations
were realized&mdash;but instead of up, it led down. From somewhere
in front of him Kane heard a vague, rhythmic murmur and a cold hand
gripped his heart. The chanting of the worshippers before&mdash;the
Black Altar!</p>

<p>He raced forward recklessly, rounded a turn in the corridor,
brought up short against a door and looked through a tiny aperture.
His heart sank. He had chosen the wrong stair and had wandered into
some other building adjoining the Tower of Death.</p>

<p>He looked upon a grim and terrible scene. In a wide open space
before a great black tower whose spire rose above the crags behind
it, two long lines of savage dancers swayed and writhed. Their
voices rose in a strange meaningless chant, and they did not move
from their tracks.</p>

<p>From their knees upward their bodies swayed in fantastic
rhythmical motions, and in their hands torches tossed and whirled,
shedding a lurid shifting red light over the scene. Behind them
were ranged a vast concourse of people who stood silent.</p>

<p>The dancing torchlight gleamed on a sea of glittering eyes and
black faces. In front of the dancers rose the Tower of Death,
gigantically tall, black and horrific. No door or window opened in
its face, but high on the wall in a sort of ornamented frame there
leered a grim symbol of death and decay. The skull of Nakura! A
faint, eery glow surrounded it, lit somehow from within the tower,
Kane knew, and wondered by what strange art the priests had kept
the skull from decay and dissolution so long.</p>

<p>But it was neither the skull nor the tower which gripped the
Puritan's horrified gaze and held it. Between the converging lines
of yelling, swaying worshippers there rose a great black altar. On
this altar lay a slim, white shape.</p>

<p>"Marylin!" the word burst from Kane's lips in a great sob.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood frozen, helpless, struck blind. No time
now to retrace his steps and find the niche where the skull priest
lurked.</p>

<p>Even now a faint glow was apparent behind the spire of the
tower, etching that spire blackly against the sky. The moon had
risen. The chant of the dancers soared up to a frenzy of sound, and
from the silent watchers behind them began a sinister low rumble of
drums. To Kane's dazed mind it seemed that he looked on some red
debauch of a lower Hell.</p>

<p>What ghastly worship of past aeons did these perverted and
degenerate rites symbolize? Kane knew that these black people aped the
rituals of their former masters in their crude way, and even in his
despair he found time to shudder at the thought of what those
original rites must have been.</p>

<p>Now a fearful shape rose up beside the altar where lay the
silent girl. A tall black man, entirely naked save for a hideous
painted mask on his face and a great head-dress of waving plumes.
The drone of the chant sank low for an instant, then rose up again
to wilder heights. Was it the vibrations of their song that made
the floor quiver beneath Kane's feet?</p>

<p>Kane with shaking fingers began to unbar the door. Naught to do
now but to rush out barehanded and die beside the girl he could not
save. Then his gaze was blocked by a giant form which shouldered in
front of the door. A huge black man, a chief by his bearing and apparel,
leaned idly against the wall as he watched the proceedings. Kane's
heart gave a great leap. This was too good to be true! Thrust in
the black man's girdle was the pistol that he himself had carried! He
knew that his weapons must have been divided among his captors.
This pistol meant nothing to the chief, but he must have been taken
by its strange shape and was carrying it as savages will wear
useless trinkets. Or perhaps he thought it a sort of war-club. At
any rate, there it was. And again, floor and building seemed to
tremble.</p>

<p>Kane pulled the door silently inward and crouched in the shadows
behind his victim like a great brooding tiger.</p>

<p>His brain worked swiftly and formulated his plan of action.
There was a dagger in the girdle beside the pistol; the black man's
back was turned squarely to him and he must strike from the left to
reach the heart and silence him quickly. All this passed through
Solomon's brain in a flash as he crouched.</p>

<p>The black man was not aware of his foe's presence until Kane's lean
right hand shot across his shoulder and clamped on his mouth,
jerking him backward. At the same instant the Puritan's left hand
tore the dagger from the girdle and with one desperate plunge sank
the keen blade home.</p>

<p>The black crumpled without a sound and in an instant Kane's
pistol was in its owner's hand. A second's investigation showed
that it was still loaded and the flint still in place.</p>

<p>No one had seen the swift murder. Those few who stood near the
doorway were all facing the Black Altar, enwrapped in the drama,
which was there unfolding. As Kane stepped across the corpse, the
chanting of the dancers ceased abruptly. In the instant of silence
which followed, Kane heard, above the pounding of his own pulse,
the night wind rustle the death-like plumes of the masked horror
beside the altar. A rim of the moon glowed above the spire.</p>

<p>Then, from high up on the face of the Tower of Death, a deep
voice boomed out in a strange chant. Mayhap the black priest who spoke
behind the skull knew not what his words meant, but Kane believed
that he at least mimicked the very intonation of those long-dead
Atlantean acolytes. Deep, mystic, resonant the voice sounded out,
like the endless flowing of long tides on the broad white
beaches.</p>

<p>The masked one beside the altar drew himself up to his great
height and raised a long, glimmering blade. Kane recognized his own
sword, even as he levelled his pistol and fired&mdash;not at the
masked priest but full at the skull which gleamed in the face of
the tower. For in one blinding flash of intuition he remembered the
dying Atlantean's words: "Their brains hinge on the skull of
Nakura!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the crack of the pistol came a shattering
crash; the dry skull flew into a thousand pieces and vanished, and
behind it the chant broke off short in a death shriek. The rapier
fell from the hand of the masked priest and many of the dancers
crumpled to the earth, the others halting short, spellbound.
Through the deathly silence which reigned for an instant, Kane
rushed toward the altar; then all Hell broke loose.</p>

<p>A babel of bestial screams rose to the shuddering stars. For
centuries, only their faith in the dead Nakura had held together
the blood-drenched brains of the black Negari. Now their symbol
had vanished, had been blasted into nothing before their eyes. It
was to them as if the skies had split, the moon fallen and the
world ended. All the red visions which lurked at the backs of their
corroded brains leaped into fearful life, all the latent insanity
which was their heritage rose to claim its own, and Kane looked
upon a whole nation turned to bellowing maniacs.</p>

<p>Screaming and roaring they turned on each other, men and women,
tearing with frenzied fingernails, stabbing with spears and with
daggers, beating each other with the flaming torches, while over
all rose the roar of frantic human beasts.</p>

<p>With clubbed pistol Kane battered his way through the surging,
writhing ocean of flesh, to the foot of the altar stairs. Nails
raked him, knives slashed at him, torches scorched his garments,
but he paid no heed.</p>

<p>Then as he reached the altar, a terrible figure broke from the
struggling mass and charged him. Nakari, queen of Negari, crazed as
any of her subjects, rushed upon the Englishman with dagger bared
and eyes horribly aflame.</p>

<p>"You shall not escape this time!" she was screaming, but before
she reached him a great black giant, dripping blood and blind from a
gash across his eyes, reeled across her path and lurched into
her.</p>

<p>She screamed like a wounded cat and struck her dagger into him,
and then groping hands closed on her. The blind giant whirled her
on high with one dying effort, and her last scream knifed the din
of battle as Nakari, last queen of Negari, crashed against the
stones of the altar and fell shattered and dead at Kane's feet.</p>

<p><br>
KANE sprang up the black steps, worn deep by the feet of myriad
priests and victims, and as he came, the masked figure, who had
stood like one turned to stone, came suddenly to life. He bent
swiftly, caught up the sword he had dropped and thrust savagely at
the charging Englishman. But the dynamic quickness of Solomon Kane
was such as few men could match. A twist and sway of his steely
body and he was inside the thrust, and as the blade slid harmlessly
between arm and chest, he brought down the heavy pistol barrel
among the waving plumes, crushing head-dress, mask and skull with
one blow.</p>

<p>Then ere he turned to the fainting girl who lay bound on the
altar, he flung aside the shattered pistol and snatched his stolen
sword from the nerveless hand which still grasped it, feeling a
fierce thrill of renewed confidence at the familiar feel of the
hilt.</p>

<p>Marylin lay white and silent, her death-like face turned blindly
to the light of the moon which shone calmly down on the frenzied
scene. At first Kane thought her to be dead, but his searching
fingers detected a faint flutter of pulse.</p>

<p>He cut her bonds and lifted her tenderly&mdash;only to drop her
again and whirl as a hideous, blood-stained figure of insanity came
leaping and gibbering up the steps. Full upon Kane's outthrust
blade the creature ran, and toppled back into the red swirl below,
clawing beast-like at its mortal wound.</p>

<p>Then beneath Kane's feet the altar rocked; a sudden tremor
hurled him to his knees and his horrified eyes beheld the Tower of
Death sway to and fro.</p>

<p>Some horror of Nature was taking place, and this fact pierced
the crumbling brains of the fiends who fought and screamed below. A
new element entered into their shrieking, and then the Tower of
Death swayed far out with a terrible and awesome
majesty&mdash;broke from the rocking crags and&mdash;gave way with
a thunder of crashing worlds. Great stones and shards of masonry
came raining down, bringing death and destruction to hundreds of
screaming humans below.</p>

<p>One of these stones crashed to pieces on the altar beside Kane,
showering him with dust.</p>

<p>"Earthquake!" he gasped, and smitten by this new terror he
caught up the senseless girl and plunged recklessly down the
cracking steps, hacking and stabbing a way through the crimson
whirlpools of bestial humanity that still tore and ravened.</p>

<p>The rest was a red nightmare in which Kane's dazed brain refused
to record all its horrors. It seemed that for screaming crimson
centuries he reeled through narrow winding streets where bellowing,
screeching black demons battled and died, among titanic walls and black
columns that rocked against the sky and crashed to ruin about him,
while the earth heaved and trembled beneath his staggering feet and
the thunder of crashing towers filled the world.</p>

<p>Gibbering fiends in human shape clutched and clawed at him, to
fade before his flailing sword, and falling stones bruised and
battered him. He crouched as he reeled along, covering the girl
with his body as best he could, sheltering her alike from blind
stone and blinder human.</p>

<p>At last, when it seemed mortal endurance had reached its limit,
he saw the great black outer wall of the city loom before him, rent
from earth to parapet and tottering for its fall. He dashed through
a crevice, and gathering his efforts, made one last sprint. And
scarce was he out of reach than the wall crashed, falling inward
like a great black wave.</p>

<p>The night wind was in his face and behind him rose the clamour
of the doomed city as Kane staggered down the hill path that
trembled beneath his feet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">7. &mdash; THE FAITH OF
SOLOMON</a></h2>

<p class="cp">"The last lost giant, even God,<br>
Is risen against the world."<br>
&mdash;Chesterton</p>

<br>

<p class="first">DAWN lay like a cool white hand on the brow of
Solomon Kane. The nightmares faded from his soul as he breathed
deep of the morning wind which blew up from the jungle far below
his feet&mdash;a wind laden with the musk of decaying vegetation.
Yet it was like the breath of life to him, for the scents were
those of the clean natural disintegration of outdoor things, not
the loathsome aura of decadent antiquity that lurks in the walls of
eon-old cities&mdash;Kane shuddered involuntarily.</p>

<p>He bent over the sleeping girl who lay at his feet, arranged as
comfortably as possible with the few soft tree branches he had been
able to find for her bed. Now she opened her eyes and stared about
wildly for an instant; then as her gaze met the face of Solomon,
lighted by one of his rare smiles, she gave a little sob of
thankfulness and clung to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Kane! Have we in truth escaped from yon fearful
city? Now it seems all like a dream&mdash;after you fell through
the secret door in my chamber Nakari later went to your dungeon as
she told me&mdash;and returned in vile humour. She said you were a
fool, for she had offered you the kingdom of the world and you had
but insulted her. She screamed and raved and cursed like one insane
and swore that she would yet, alone, build a great empire of
Negari.</p>

<p>"Then she turned on me and reviled me, saying that you held
me&mdash;a slave&mdash;in more esteem than a queen and all her
glory. And in spite of my pleas she took me across her knees and
whipped me until I swooned.</p>

<p>"Afterward I lay half senseless for a long time, and was only
dimly aware that men came to Nakari and said that you had escaped.
They said you were a sorcerer, for you faded through a solid wall
like a ghost. But Nakari killed the men who had brought you from
the cell, and for hours she was like a wild beast.</p>

<p>"How long I lay thus I know not. In those terrible rooms and
corridors where no natural sunlight ever entered, one lost all
track of time. But from the time you were captured by Nakari and
the time that I was placed on the altar, at least a day and a night
and another day must have passed. It was only a few hours before
the sacrifice that word came you had escaped.</p>

<p>"Nakari and her Starmaidens came to prepare me for the rite." At
the bare memory of that fearful ordeal she whimpered and hid her
face in her hands. "I must have been drugged. I only know that they
clothed me in the white robe of the sacrifice and carried me into a
great black chamber filled with horrid statues.</p>

<p>"There I lay for a space like one in a trance, while the women
performed various strange and shameful rites according to their
grim religion. Then I fell into a swoon, and when I emerged I was
lying bound on the Black Altar&mdash;the torches were tossing and
the devotees chanting&mdash;behind the Tower of Death the rising
moon was beginning to glow&mdash;all this I knew faintly, as in a
deep dream. And as in a dream I saw the glowing skull high on the
tower&mdash;and the gaunt black naked priest holding a sword above my
heart, then I knew no more. What happened?"</p>

<p>"At about that moment," Kane answered, "I emerged from a
building wherein I had wandered by mistake, and blasted their
hellish skull to atoms with a pistol ball. Whereupon, all these
people, being cursed from birth by demons, and being likewise
possessed of devils, fell to slaying one another; in the midst of
the tumult an earthquake cometh to pass which shakes the walls
down. Then I snatch you up, and running at random, come upon a rent
in the outer wall and thereby escape, carrying you, who seem in a
swoon.</p>

<p>"Once only you awoke, after I had crossed the
Bridge-Across-the-Sky, as the black people of Negari called it, which was
crumbling beneath our feet by reason of the earthquake. After I had
come to these cliffs, but dared not descend them in the darkness,
the moon being nigh to setting by that time, you awoke and screamed
and clung to me, whereupon I soothed you as best I might, and after
a time you fell into a natural sleep."</p>

<p>"And now what?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"England!" Kane's deep eyes lighted at the word. "I find it hard
to remain in the land of my birth for more than a month at a time;
yet though I am cursed with the wanderlust, 'tis a name which ever
rouses a glow in my bosom. And how of you, child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, heaven!" she cried, clasping her small hands. "Home!
Something of which to be dreamed&mdash;never attained, I fear. Oh,
Captain Kane, how shall we gain through all the vast leagues of
jungle which lie between this place and the coast?"</p>

<p>"Marylin," said Kane gently, stroking her curly hair, "methinks
you lack somewhat in faith, both in Providence and in me. Nay,
alone I am a weak creature, having no strength or might in me; yet
in times past hath God made me a great vessel of wrath and a sword
of deliverance. And, I trust, shall do so again.</p>

<p>"Look you, little Marylin: in the last few hours as it were, we
have seen the passing of an evil race and the fall of a foul black
empire. Men died by thousands about us, and the earth rose beneath
our feet, hurling down towers that broke the heavens; yea, death
fell about us in a red rain, yet we escaped unscathed.</p>

<p>"Therein is more than the hand of man! Nay, a Power&mdash;the
mightiest Power! That which guided me across the world, straight to
that demon city&mdash;which led me to your chamber&mdash;which
aided me to escape again and led me to the one man in all the city
who would give the information I must have, the strange, evil
priest of an elder race who lay dying in a subterranean
cell&mdash;and which guided me to the outer wall, as I ran blindly
and at random&mdash;for should I have come under the cliffs which
formed the rest of the wall, we had surely perished. That same
Power brought us safely out of the dying city, and safe across the
rocking bridge&mdash;which shattered and sundered down into the
chasm just as my feet touched solid earth!</p>

<p>"Think you that having led me this far, and accomplished such
wonders, the Power will strike us down now? Nay! Evil flourishes
and rules in the cities of men and the waste places of the world,
but anon the great giant that is God rises and smites for the
righteous, and they lay faith in him.</p>

<p>"I say this: this cliff shall we descend in safety, and yon dank
jungle traverse in safety, and it is as sure that in old Devon your
people shall clasp you again to their bosom, as that you stand
here."</p>

<p>And now for the first time Marylin smiled, with the quick
eagerness of a normal young girl, and Kane sighed in relief.
Already the ghosts were fading from her haunted eyes, and Kane
looked to the day when her horrible experiences should be as a
dimming dream. One glance he flung behind him, where beyond the
scowling hills the lost city of Negari lay shattered and silent,
amid the ruins of her own walls and the fallen crags which had kept
her invincible so long, but which had at last betrayed her to her
doom.</p>

<p>A momentary pang smote him as he thought of the myriad of
crushed, still forms lying amid those ruins; then the blasting
memory of their evil crimes surged over him and his eyes
hardened.</p>

<p>"And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the
midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the windows from
on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.</p>

<p>"For Thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defended city a
ruin; a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
built.</p>

<p>"Moreover, the multitude of Thy stranger shall be like small
dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that
passeth suddenly away; yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</p>

<p>"Stay yourselves and wonder; cry ye out and cry; they are
drunken but not with wine; they stagger but not with strong
drink.</p>

<p>"Verily, Marylin," said Kane with a sigh, "with mine own eyes
have I seen the prophecies of Isaiah come to pass. They were
drunken but not with wine. Nay, blood was their drink and in that
red flood they dipped deep and terribly."</p>

<p>Then taking the girl by the hand he started toward the edge of
the cliff. At this very point had he ascended in the
night&mdash;how long ago it seemed.</p>

<p>Kane's clothing hung in tatters about him. He was torn,
scratched and bruised. But in his eyes shone the clear calm light
of serenity as the sun came up, flooding cliffs and jungle with a
golden light that was like a promise of joy and happiness.</p>
