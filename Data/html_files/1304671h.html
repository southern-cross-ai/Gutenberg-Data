  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">"THE white wolf leaped, straight for his throat. With a
  tremendous effort Count Orloff overcame the paralysis of terror that bound
  him and pressed the trigger of his gun. Just in time! For even as the beast
  collapsed in mid-air his fangs clamped about the Count's neck and scratched,
  barely scratched, the skin.</p>

  <p>"The great shaggy body crashed to the ground. Momentarily a vertigo
  blinded Orloff. Then his sight cleared. He bent to the body stretched at his
  feet, and staggered back. This was no wolf that lay there, stiff in death. It
  was a man&mdash;the swarthy wood-chopper who had misdirected him into the
  lonely forest path!"</p>

  <p>A murmur of applause ran around the candle-lighted table as I ended. I
  sipped my cordial and congratulated myself. I had put the tale over well.
  Then Elnore Lansdowne gurgled, she of the diamond tiara and the triple
  chins.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Ashton, I think that was just the most adorable ghost story I've
  ever heard. You must tell us another. You really must."</p>

  <p>My fingers tightened on the napkin in my lap, and I felt my face flush.
  But Irma Stanton, practiced hostess as she is, averted the impending
  explosion.</p>

  <p>"A little later, dear," she said sweetly. "If you don't mind. We shall be
  more comfortable in the drawing room." She gathered eyes with her own and
  rose. Chairs scraped and a confused gabble covered her whisper to me. "Now be
  good, Earl. Remember it's all in the sweet service of publicity."</p>

  <p>But I'd had enough. I slipped through a door and got up to Rand's library
  unobserved, or so I thought. The door firmly shut, I sunk into one of the big
  chairs and lit a Hoya. I swore I should never write another book. I had tried
  to get across some of the eerie fascination of the stories I had tracked down
  for these ten years, the legends of men and women who change into wolves by
  night and run with the gray packs that raven under the moon. I had tried to
  put the spine-tingling strangeness of it on paper&mdash;and my reward has
  been the powder-scented adulation of women like that flesh-pillowed,
  simpering Mrs. Lansdowne. Pah!</p>

  <p>Behind me the door opened. I didn't turn at the sound. The only
  illumination came from the flickering hearth-fire, and the chair's high back
  was between me and the entrance. Perhaps the interloper would think the room
  deserted. But I forgot the wavering line of smoke rising from my cigar,
  betraying my covert. Silk swished in a long arc around to my left and Lisa
  Mountenoy came drifting out of shadow into the unsteady glow.</p>

  <p>She stood there, quite unmoving, her tall slimness sheathed in black that
  merged with the darkness behind her, so that her white arms and shoulders and
  the small pale oval of her face seemed disembodied. Her eyes, black as her
  close-coifed hair, brooded, and even in the faint smile that touched the
  corners of her little mouth there was a hint of sadness. So fitting, somehow,
  was she to that fire-shadowed room and my mood that I did not resent her. Nor
  did I rise or stir at all, but waited.</p>

  <p>A knot popped in the burning log and kindling resin flared, outlining her
  figure, making her real. I started to rise. "This seat is very
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, but I'll sit here." I hadn't noticed the other chair beside
  mine. She sank into it. "I hope you don't mind my intrusion."</p>

  <p>"Intrusion! Your presence is far from that. It makes the trinity complete.
  A good cigar, a glowing fire, a beautiful woman. What more can a man
  desire?"</p>

  <p>"You are more than kind. But I am going to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>"Disappoint me? How could you possibly do that?"</p>

  <p>"Easily. You are thinking 'I hope she'll have sense enough to keep quiet.
  It won't be so bad if she does.' But I'm going to talk, and about your book
  too."</p>

  <p>I sighed. "Must you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But perhaps when I am through you will not be sorry as you are just
  now. Tell me, Mr. Ashton, do you believe there is any truth in the idea of
  the werewolf?"</p>

  <p>I took a long puff. At least she wasn't going to gush about how thrilling
  my tales were.</p>

  <p>"Reasoningly, I do not. There is no scientific justification for it. Yet
  sometimes I wonder. The legend is so universal, so deeply rooted in all
  folklore. Sometimes it changes to correspond with the fauna of the locality.
  In Burma, for instance, they whisper of tiger-women, in Abyssinia of
  lion-men. In the Cape Country tales are told of silver-pelted beasts who lead
  the wild-dog packs by night but return to their human beds with the first
  touch of sun on the veldt. Can it be possible that there is no basis at all
  for so widespread a myth? But I have never been able to authenticate one of
  the innumerable instances of which I have been told."</p>

  <p>She was queerly insistent. "You are not certain then, that the thing is
  impossible?"</p>

  <p>"Certain?" I shrugged. "Death, they say, is certain. Yet in Haiti silent
  figures laboring in the fields were pointed out to me as men who had been
  buried months before. I have seen and heard unbelievable things in all the
  ancient countries of the world. Only here in new America is everything
  certain, everything explained."</p>

  <p>Sap dripped from the end of an un-caught log and hissed on the red embers.
  Mrs. Mountenoy's hands twisted, one within the other, in her lap. Her face
  was hidden in the embrasure of her chair but there was in her voice a
  palpable effort at control.</p>

  <p>"It may be so," she whispered to herself. "It may be so." Suddenly I was
  aware that hers had been no aimless query, that to her some vast import had
  rested in my reply.</p>

  <p>"What may be so?"</p>

  <p>She made no direct answer but seemed to be nerving herself to some
  decision. After a while she spoke, her tones low yet vibrant with urgency.
  "Will you help me, Mr. Ashton?"</p>

  <p>"How?" I exclaimed. "What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Trouble? That is a weak word." She leaned forward into the light. Her
  pupils dilated and a little muscle twitched in her cheek. "Only you, I think,
  in all the world can help me. Will you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. In any way I can." Even now I cannot see how I could have made
  any other response.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" The tension in her face eased. "I knew you would not
  refuse."</p>

  <p>I tried to be matter-of-fact. "Now tell me about it. Just what is it you
  want me to do for you?"</p>

  <p>Again there was silence while she seemed to search for words. Finally her
  slender hands went out in a little gesture of helplessness. "I can't say it.
  It would sound silly, hysterical. You must come and see for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"At my home. Come now, tonight. It's only a short distance, we can drive
  there in twenty minutes. I have a room prepared for you."</p>

  <p>I drew back slightly. After all I knew nothing of this woman, had been
  introduced to her only this very evening. And Irma had not been over friendly
  to her. My thought must have been reflected in my face, for she answered it.
  "My husband will be waiting up for us, I told him I hoped to bring you back
  with me."</p>

  <p>"But can't it wait till Monday? I'm supposed to be here for the weekend
  and Mrs. Stanton will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Forgive you. I'll go and make it right with her." Before I could
  voice any further protest she was up and out of the room. What she said to
  Irma I never found out, but in minutes she was at the door with my hat and
  stick. "Your bag is in my car," she said breathlessly. "Come. We'll go out
  the side entrance."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WE did not talk as, taut behind the wheel, Mrs. Mountenoy
  shot the roadster through the home-bound traffic on the North Country road.
  We passed through a town and I glimpsed an illuminated clock face, saw that
  is was just ten. We turned sharp right and were bumping along an unpaved
  lane. The foliage of the North Shore dropped behind, and gaunt pine barrens
  stretched away on both sides, bleakly desolate under the stars' cold light.
  Just ahead a dark bulk loomed against the sky. Its outline sharpened and I
  saw it as a long, low-sprawling house.</p>

  <p>The road curved to its further side, and there were two windows, yellow
  with light. The car skidded to a halt.</p>

  <p>I got my bag out of the rumble, followed the crunch of Lisa Mountenoy's
  shoes on the gravel path. I caught up with her at the door. She was crouched
  against it, her ear against a panel. As I reached her she gasped almost
  inaudibly, I thought with relief. The key in her hand slid soundlessly into
  its lock and she turned it slowly, carefully, as if striving to avoid giving
  warning to someone within. I caught the contagion and tiptoed after her into
  the dark hall, groped with my bag for a clear space before setting it down.
  To the right a thin yellow line near the floor indicated the lighted room.
  Again she listened for a moment, breathlessly. Then, apparently satisfied,
  she threw the door open.</p>

  <p>"I'm back, dears," she called. "And I've brought a guest with me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard your car. You are early." The speaker rose from a low chess
  table. I had an impression that his white hair brushed the rafters of the
  ceiling, he was so tall. His voice was high-pitched, querulous. And from his
  gaunt, almost emaciated frame his clothes hung loosely. Deep seams cut into
  his cheeks, and fine wrinkles radiated from his washed-out, bleared eyes. I
  was conscious of a shock of dismay. Could this be her husband? Why, he was at
  least twenty years older.</p>

  <p>"This is Earl Ashton, dear, the author of 'Trail of the Werewolf.' My
  husband, Mr. Ashton."</p>

  <p>His bony hand was icy in mine. "I have read your work with a great deal of
  interest. I am honored by this unexpected pleasure."</p>

  <p>Queer. Hadn't she said that he knew she would bring me? I mumbled
  something.</p>

  <p>"And this is Carl." A lad of about sixteen, with strikingly blond hair
  brushed back from a high white forehead. There was a look of pain in his blue
  eyes and his sensitive lips were rather too tightly compressed for his youth,
  his pinched, sharp-chinned face too pale. "Ought you to be still up?"</p>

  <p>The boy flushed. "It is late, Lisa, I know. But I just wanted to finish
  this game. I had him almost beaten."</p>

  <p>Her tone was anything but gentle as she snapped peremptorily, "Well, say
  good-night and turn in." Resentment flared in Carl's eyes as he slammed the
  door through which we had entered. The old man winced too. But in the next
  moment she was graciousness itself.</p>

  <p>"Do make yourself comfortable, Mr. Ashton, while I get you a drink. I
  don't want you to regret being kidnapped. I did just that, Roy, plucked him
  right out of Irma Stanton's house at the point of a gun."</p>

  <p>Something grim in Mountenoy's frosty smile. "I don't doubt it. And if he
  had resisted you would have dragged his mangled corpse here."</p>

  <p>Her laugh was forced. "You see what you escaped. Now aren't you glad you
  came peaceably?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am glad," I lied. Already I was uncomfortable, feeling myself
  caught in the swirl of some scarce-hidden family tempest. "Glad to have come
  here on any terms."</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant enough room, oak-paneled, book-lined. The chairs, the
  table, a secretary in the corner, were museum pieces. Evidences of wealth
  here, despite the apparent absence of servants. Yet I could sense unease and
  a furtive&mdash;fear. That was it, I realized. These people were afraid of
  something. Nor was it the usual banal distrust of one another when age weds
  youth. It was something more fundamental, more&mdash;ghastly. They were
  listening&mdash;both of them&mdash;listening for something they dreaded to
  hear.</p>

  <p>The Scotch was real, and as I doused it with Club Perrier and drank with
  the two my discomfort passed away. The conversation turned, of course, to my
  work, and I told them one or two stories that had been crowded out of the
  volume. Roy Mountenoy countered with a tale or so of his own, and we drifted
  into a discussion of folk legends in general. My hosts displayed a surprising
  familiarity with the subject. I began to enjoy myself, riding my hobby to a
  fare-you-well. The "Trail" was on the table, a first edition, and I riffled
  the pages as we talked.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly I noticed that their attention had strayed, that her smile
  was fixed, unnatural, and that his eyes kept wandering to the windows across
  the room from me. I finished my remarks with a question. Neither replied, and
  there was a momentary silence.</p>

  <p>Distinctly, from just outside the windows, I heard faint sounds, a
  scratching of claws on stone, some animal sniffing at the sash. A glance
  passed between husband and wife, a swift unspoken entreaty and assent. Mrs.
  Mountenoy rose with a tight-lipped; "Will you excuse me a moment?" and went
  out the way Carl had gone. Mountenoy started talking but what he said was
  germane to something that had passed minutes before.</p>

  <p>Somehow I was immensely relieved when Lisa Mountenoy returned. Once more
  there was a silent interchange between them. An almost imperceptible negative
  shake of her head. What little color the other had drained from his face,
  left his seamed countenance yellow, jaundiced. I noticed that the hand on his
  knee trembled slightly. Our talk lost its spontaneity, there were long
  interludes. Whatever it was that had been sniffing at the windows had gone.
  But I heard a dog howling, somewhere far off.</p>

  <p>We were waiting, all three of us, waiting for something to happen. I did
  not know what it was, except that it must be the reason for my presence. Yes,
  something more I was certain of. Roy Mountenoy hoped desperately that it
  would not eventuate, hoped against hope...</p>

  <p>Heavy footsteps crunched from the path. Mountenoy's head twisted sharply
  to the sound, and his lips went white. It seemed to me that red flame glowed
  in the black depths of Lisa's eyes. There was a knock at the outer door.</p>

  <p>Mountenoy pushed himself up out of the chair, went to answer the summons.
  Once I saw a captured Chinese bandit walk proudly alone to where the axeman
  waited. It was like that. He left the room-door open, and I could see him
  fumble at the knob outside. There was a chill in the breeze that came into
  the room, although the night had been warm.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Keller. Come in." His utterance was muffled.</p>

  <p>"Damn right I'll come in." A stocky, roughly dressed individual thrust
  into the foyer, his round face florid in the light from our room. He shoved
  what seemed a bundle of feathers almost into Mountenoy's face. "There's some
  more of your dog's work. Best layer I've got. He hauled her right off the
  roost."</p>

  <p>The other took a backward step, raised a protesting hand. "But I have no
  dog. I have no dog, I tell you." Incomprehensible agony twanged his vocal
  cords.</p>

  <p>"Say listen, that won't go down. Not no more. I believed you the last
  time, but tonight I saw the murderin' cur slink straight here an' jump over
  your hedge. Big fellow he is too, with a kind of whitish coat. He's here in
  this house right this minute."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I give you my word we own no dog." Curious how
  unconvincing he sounded. "Both Mrs. Mountenoy and I dislike the brutes."</p>

  <p>Keller fairly spluttered. "Don't you 'dear fellow' me, and don't you lie
  to me neither. It won't go down. Either you shoot that dog tonight or I go
  down to Mineola in the morning and get the sheriff to come up and do it.</p>

  <p>"I ain't going to have my hens killed by no dog to satisfy you. There's
  been a ewe murdered too, Eli Hunt tells me, down on his north pasture. The
  beast is dangerous. Next thing you know he'll be tearing the throat of some
  kid."</p>

  <p>I heard the woman gasp at that. Mountenoy shrank back as if to avoid a
  blow. A single drop of blood dripped from the fowl and made a glistening spot
  on the floor. "Well, which is it goin' to be?" the farmer growled. "You, or
  the sheriff?"</p>

  <p>Mountenoy put a hand on Keller's sleeve. "Look here. Don't do that," he
  pleaded. "Don't go to the authorities. We have no dog, but they will make a
  lot of trouble and I&mdash;I am a sick man. I couldn't stand it. I'll pay for
  your hens, I'll pay twice, three times their value. For Hunt's sheep too.
  Tell him. Come, be a good fellow." He got a wallet out of his breast pocket,
  pulled bills from it. "Here's fifty dollars, will that be enough?" He pushed
  the money into the other's fist. Keller muttered something I did not catch.
  But he turned to the door and went out.</p>

  <p>Mountenoy came in to us. More than ever he looked an old, broken man. His
  gaze caught and held that of his wife, and there was a piteous appeal in it.
  He slumped into his chair, buried his face in his hands. "Roy," she jerked
  out. "Go look." He heaved to his feet, went across the foyer to the first
  door. He opened it cautiously, peered within and came back.</p>

  <p>"There," he said. "Asleep." He stood in the doorway, swaying.</p>

  <p>Lisa Mountenoy's voice was tight in her throat. "Roy, you heard what he
  said&mdash;about children. Do you think&mdash;" Her hand came up to her heart
  in a curious gesture whose meaning I could not read.</p>

  <p>He bowed his head, and his hands dropped to his sides, palms out.
  "Tomorrow I put bars on the window," thickly, "and a padlock on the
  door."</p>

  <p>She turned to me. "What do you think, Earl?" Sometime during the evening's
  talk we had gotten to first names. "Will it do any good?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean." I was tired of her obliqueness, was
  determined to make her speak plainly.</p>

  <p>Again that vague smile, just touching the tips of her lip-wings. "Of
  course you do. You are neither blind nor deaf. You know we fear that Carl is
  a&mdash;werewolf."</p>

  <p>Mountenoy reached for the door-jamb, and his knuckles whitened as his bony
  fingers gripped it.</p>

  <p>"No," he groaned, "no!" Every line of his taut body demanded reassurance
  from me, denial. But his eyes were hopeless, agonized.</p>

  <p>"Roy dear, aren't you convinced yet? Surely there is no escaping after
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," I put in.</p>

  <p>"You tell him, Roy."</p>

  <p>"But, Lisa," Mountenoy protested, "why should we involve Mr. Ashton? After
  all, our worries are of no interest to him."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary! If I can be of any assistance I shall be only too
  happy."</p>

  <p>"It was on that understanding Earl came here, Roy."</p>

  <p>Mountenoy gave in. "Very well." He moved a chair and sat down. I noticed
  that he had a full view of the door across the entrance vestibule. "If you
  can help us, I shall be very grateful."</p>

  <p>"No reason for that. I am vastly interested. This whole thing is right up
  my alley."</p>

  <p>"Two weeks ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better start further back," Lisa interjected. "Earl
  should know the background."</p>

  <p>Pain crossed the old man's face, but he commenced again.</p>

  <p>"Carl is my son but not Lisa's. I met his mother abroad, in a small
  fishing village in Norway, while I was there on business."</p>

  <p>"When Roy retired he had become the largest importer of cod liver oil in
  America," Lisa explained. "But he was just beginning then."</p>

  <p>Mountenoy ignored the interruption. "We were married and a year later
  Helda died in giving birth to Carl. It was imperative that I return to
  America at once and I left the boy with Helda's parents. I visited him only
  infrequently, but I managed to see that he was taught English and something
  of American customs. I hoped always to bring him here but one thing after
  another prevented. It was only two years ago, when Lisa and I were wedded,
  that I did so.</p>

  <p>"Some months ago I retired, and we bought this place, thinking to find
  peace and rest. At first it was all that I had hoped for, although I am
  afraid Lisa rather chafed at being so out of the social whirl."</p>

  <p>"I was a little lonely, but as long as Roy had what he wanted I was

  <p>I wondered just how true that was. I could not quite fit Lisa Mountenoy
  into any picture of bucolic calm, but certainly she seemed a devoted
  wife.</p>

  <p>"Two weeks ago Lisa had occasion to go to Carl's room for something after
  he had retired and found that he was not there. He was nowhere about the
  house or grounds, although none of his clothes were missing. I was in the
  city, returned at midnight to find her terribly agitated but waiting for me
  before communicating with the police. I looked in his chamber before doing
  so, and there he was, asleep. We wakened him and he denied absolutely having
  left his room. We were at a loss to account for the occurrence but finally
  set it down to sleep-walking."</p>

  <p>"There were no tracks outside," Lisa murmured, "and the door was
  locked."</p>

  <p>"Could he have gone out through the window?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mountenoy snatched at the suggestion. "That was my own
  conclusion."</p>

  <p>"There is a flower bed there, and no tracks." Her hands twisted, one
  within the other. "Except the dog's."</p>

  <p>"You had a dog at the time?"</p>

  <p>"No! I have never owned one. It must have been some stray."</p>

  <p>"That afternoon Ethel, our cook, came back from her shopping in the
  village with gossip of some hens on a neighboring farm having been killed by
  a marauding dog. The farmer, Elmer Keller, had shot at the animal but with
  apparently no effect. We paid very little attention to the story&mdash;till
  later."</p>

  <p>"The next night we watched Carl's room, but nothing happened. The
  following night the same and our vigilance relaxed. But on the morning after
  the third night we again heard of a canine raid on Kellar's hen-house&mdash;and
  Ethel found a bloody feather under the boy's bed. Keller was
  here in the afternoon. All the known dogs in the vicinity had been accounted
  for, he said. Had we any? He did not appear to believe my denial but he went
  away.</p>

  <p>"There weren't any more incidents that week. But Lisa heard of your book,
  purchased a copy, and insisted that we read it together. There was one
  chapter particularly that hit us with terrific force. You remember the tale
  that was told you at Storvaagen? The wolf that mangled a man and was chased
  off a cliff by the villagers."</p>

  <p>I stirred. "Yes. In the morning they found the crushed body of the boy
  Svedin on the rocks below but there was no trace of the wolf."</p>

  <p>Mountenoy raised bleak eyes to mine. "My first wife's maiden name was
  Svedin. The town where Carl was born and raised is Storvaagen." He said it
  quietly, but somehow the words rippled the following silence like little
  circular waves sent out by a stone dropped into a black pool.</p>

  <p>"That happened a hundred and fifty years ago. Those Norse families
  certainly cling to their homes." The remark was ridiculous, but I had to say
  something. Lisa answered it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Carl objected strenuously to leaving his grandparents, and he has
  not been happy here. He seems to have a natural affection for Roy, but I
  haven't been able to win him. As a matter of fact I am very much afraid
  he&mdash;resents me."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand him, Lisa. It is just his reticence, his cold Northern
  blood. But all this doesn't interest Earl." Roy stopped the discussion and
  resumed his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Last Saturday I was called away. My successors had gotten into a labor
  tangle in St. Louis, appealed to me, the men would trust only me. I could not
  refuse to go. Lisa's letters told me of her mounting perturbation. Time and
  again during the week the dog had been on the prowl and each time Carl had
  been absent from his bed. I returned this afternoon to find Ethel sitting on
  her luggage, waiting for me. Last night she had seen a big white dog skulking
  in the hall, she wouldn't sleep here again. And tonight&mdash;well, you heard
  and saw."</p>

  <p>Again he buried his face in his hands. "I learned that you were to be at
  the Stanton's," Lisa said. "And I literally forced an invitation from Irma.
  She doesn't like me. I was determined to meet you, to get you here tonight.
  You are the only one in the country who would understand, who would not think
  us insane. And I am afraid, deathly afraid. The Storvaagen Werewolf started
  out by killing sheep, didn't he, before he killed a man? And Carl&mdash;hates
  me."</p>

  <p>Mountenoy started up, his face working. "He won't hurt you, Lisa, he
  won't!" His voice was harsh, his eyes staring. "God help me, I'll kill him
  with my own hands if he attempts it."</p>

  <p>So far had this retired businessman, this seller of fish oil, come!</p>

  <p>I tried to calm him. "Even if your suspicions are correct I don't believe
  there is any danger tonight. He has already been out, doubtless he will sleep
  quietly now till morning."</p>

  <p>She caught me up. "Then you think he really is a werewolf."</p>

  <p>"I scarcely know what to think. It is incredible. Yet, as I told you
  before, I have long passed the stage of stigmatising any tale, however wild,
  as impossible. The boy comes from the very fountainhead of the legend, has
  undoubtedly heard the story of the Storvaagen Werewolf time and again.
  Possibly there is an ancestral taint in his blood, reawakened by the
  disturbance of his forced migration." I shrugged. "I should like to mull it
  over through the night. I may have some solution by the morning."</p>

  <p>They couldn't very well do anything but acquiesce. After all, I was their
  guest.</p>

  <p>The house was only one story and the bedrooms opened on a long corridor
  that began at the left of the entrance lobby. The first, as I had already
  gathered, was Carl's. Next came Lisa's chamber, connecting through a
  dressing-room with Mountenoy's. The guest room was at the extreme end.
  "Rather an unusual arrangement for a house as large as this," Roy said. "But
  it is attractive to one for whom stair-climbing has become a task." He smiled
  wryly.</p>

  <p>As I undressed my thoughts were occupied not with the outré story I had
  heard, but perversely enough with an inconsequential trifle. The first
  edition of "Trail of the Werewolf" in the living room had Mentano's stamp on
  the flyleaf. Like all first authors I had visited that famous bookshop three
  days after the publication date in the guise of a purchaser. A clerk had told
  me that the first edition had been sold out, and had offered me a competing
  work. That had been four weeks ago. Yet Lisa Mountenoy had bought a copy
  there within two weeks. I had heard of bookclerks being subsidized; had that
  happened here? I must speak to Rand about it.</p>

  <p>As is my habit, I fell soundly asleep as soon as my head touched the
  pillow. I awoke with a start. Only the faintly lighter oblong of the window
  broke the darkness; only the shrilling of crickets the silence. But I had a
  strange sense of something inimical lurking close by. I lay quite still and
  searched the dark with my eyes.</p>

  <p>Then I heard it&mdash;a soft pad, pad of animal feet, a click of claws
  against wood! Not in the room. Inside the house. At my door! A soft body
  thumped against the panels. I recalled there had been no key in the
  lock&mdash;was it coming in? Was there any possible weapon in the room? None
  that I could remember, none that I could find instantly in the dark.</p>

  <p>I slid a hand over the side of the bed, to the floor, gripped a shoe. That
  wouldn't help much against a&mdash;against what was at the door.</p>

  <p>There was the faintest possible creaks, and a snuffing close along the
  threshold. I had the covers off me now, was taut for a spring. But the latch
  held! The footsteps padded away. Held breath popped from between my lips, and
  courage came back. I was out of the bed, at the door, was jerking it open. I
  <i>must</i> see what had made those sounds!</p>

  <p>The corridor was unlit, save for one small light at the other end. I saw a
  flickering shadow there, momentarily, then it disappeared&mdash;into a room.
  Lisa's or Carl's? I could not tell, drowsiness&mdash;the
  dimness&mdash;confused me.</p>

  <p>I went down the hall, my bare feet thudding against the parquet. Both
  doors were closed. I listened at Carl's, heard the long breathing of sleep.
  From behind Lisa's came the rustling of a sheet, creak of a bed spring as the
  dreamer turned.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly I was conscious of the figure I made, in pajamas, one shoe
  tight-gripped in a shaking hand, listening at a woman's door in a strange
  house. The realization jarred me to normalcy.</p>

  <p>Was I sure I had heard those sounds at all, seen that moving shadow?
  Wakened in unfamiliar surroundings, had I not imagined them? After all, the
  evening had not been one to give me quiet nerves.</p>

  <p>I got back to my own chamber as soundlessly as I could. I was sure now
  that I was making a fool of myself, had allowed the neurotic imaginings of an
  overwrought woman to sway me off-balance. My foot touched the threshold, felt
  wetness. I bent to it. All along the flat board was a dribble of foam. The
  dripped slavering of a dog!</p>

  <p>I stared at it, my hair prickling. And scream after scream ripped the
  silence behind me! Then words&mdash;"Roy! Roy! The dog! Roy! He's in here!
  The dog!" I whirled to the sounds&mdash;from Lisa's room&mdash;dashed to her
  door, flung it open.</p>

  <p>Light swept in, obliquely. Mountenoy burst through the dressing-room door,
  in nightshirt, hair tousled, eyes staring, a gun in his hand. The bed was
  empty! But he looked to the window. Lisa was there&mdash;leaning out!</p>

  <p>She turned to us, slowly. Her form was silhouetted against the pale
  star-glimmer. She stood there, gazing at us. A long shudder ran through
  her.</p>

  <p>"Lisa. What is it? Lisa my dear?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was thin, strained, hysterical.</p>

  <p>"The dog! I woke and saw it&mdash;crouched to spring." Her arm rose, her
  long hand pointed to the floor at my feet. "Right there. Its eyes were like
  flames. I screamed and it twisted&mdash;leaped through the window."</p>

  <p>"You watched it. Where did it go?"</p>

  <p>She was silent, holding him with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Lisa, tell me. Where did it go?"</p>

  <p>"It went&mdash;oh Roy&mdash;it went into Carl's window&mdash;into his
  room."</p>

  <p>"Into my room&mdash;what&mdash;what's happened?" A drowsy voice in the
  doorway behind. I whirled to it, whirled back to Roy's unintelligible shout,
  insensate, furious.</p>

  <p>In a flash I saw his gun sweep up, pointing at Carl; saw <i>her</i> face
  over Roy's shoulder, and sprang, grasping the gun, thrusting it down. The
  bullet roared into the floor.</p>

  <p>"He's your son, man, your son!" I yelled and jerked the weapon from
  him.</p>

  <p>His skinny hand snatched at it, his thin lips were drawn back from his
  teeth in a snarl. "Give it to me, give it to me. Son or not, I'll kill him.
  Kill him before he kills her, kills my wife and my child."</p>

  <p>Now I understood. Fending the old man off I looked at her. God! May I
  never again look into a face with such malice, such hate, blazing in it.</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" I asked her as calmly as I could.</p>

  <p>Her lips moved, soundlessly. But the swift dart of her eyes was enough. I
  pulled away from Mountenoy, stepped to a mirror-covered closet door, jerked
  it open.</p>

  <p>There, chained to the floor, its snout bound tight by a gray silk
  stocking, was a huge white dog.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I should have guessed it before, when Mountenoy told his story. I
  realize now that the essential part of the werewolf idea, Carl's absence from
  his bed when the dog was loose, depended on her unsupported word. How
  dexterously she had managed that!</p>

  <p>She would not herself kill the interloper, the alien who must share with
  her and her unborn child that for which she had sold herself in marriage to a
  dotard. She was afraid&mdash;afraid not of the deed but of the punishment. I
  wonder how many nights she lay awake, thinking, thinking, rejecting one plan
  after another while the old man snored. No, she could not do it.</p>

  <p>And then by some ill chance she bought and read my book. The place, the
  name, in that old Norse tale leaped out at her from its page...</p>

  <p>The slow, insidious development of her scheme to slay the boy by his
  father's hand is obvious. Except for one thing. Why did she bring me there? I
  asked her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see? Would we have been believed when we said that Roy killed
  Carl because he was a werewolf? But you&mdash;the authority in that
  field..."</p>

  <p>That was her mistake. Because, at the last, I realized that she had read
  "Trail of the Werewolf" long before she told Roy she had bought it. Because I
  knew then she had lied, that the whole thing was a lie. And her face, flaring
  in mad triumph, had set off the instantaneous explosion of thought that had
  thrown me at Roy's hand just in time to send the bullet harmlessly into the
  floor.</p>
