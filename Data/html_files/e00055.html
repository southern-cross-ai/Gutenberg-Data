<h2>CHAPTER 1. FROM GANTHEAUME BAY TO THE HUTT RIVER.</h2>

<p>WRECK OF THE SECOND BOAT IN GANTHEAUME BAY.</p>

<p>A few moments were sufficient to enable us all to recollect
ourselves: two men endeavoured to keep the boat's stern on to the
sea, whilst the rest of us lightened her by carrying everything
we could on shore, after which we hauled her up. The custom had
always been for the other boat to lie off until I made the signal
for them to run in, and it accordingly was now waiting outside
the breakers. Her crew had not seen our misfortunes owing to the
height of the surf, which, when we were under it, shut us out
from their view, and now perceiving that we were on shore and the
boat hauled up, they concluded all was right; and notwithstanding
I made every possible sign to them not to beach, running as far
as I could venture into the sea and shouting out to them, my
voice was drowned by the roar of the surge, and I saw them
bounding on to, what I thought, certain destruction. We of course
were all turned to render assistance. They fortunately kept
rather to the south of the spot on which we had beached, and
where it was much less rocky, so that the danger they incurred in
reaching the shore was slight in comparison to ours; yet some of
the planks of this boat were split throughout their entire
length.</p>

<p>EXPLORE IN ITS VICINITY. COUNTRY ABOUT GANTHEAUME BAY.
GEOLOGICAL REMARKS. CROSS A DISTRICT OF RED SANDSTONE.</p>

<p>Whilst all hands were employed in endeavouring to repair
damages I ascended a hill to reconnoitre our present position and
found we were in a country of a pleasing and romantic appearance,
and although the land was not good the nature of the soil made me
aware that we were most probably in the vicinity of a large tract
of better quality; indeed this was the only part of South-west
Australia in which I had met with the ancient red sandstone of
the north-west coast; immediately behind the sandhills on which I
stood was a thick Casuarina scrub which sloped down into a deep
valley, and beyond this rose lofty and fantastic hills. After I
had for some time looked round on this scene I returned to the
party and received the report of the carpenters, who, having
examined the boats, stated their inability to render either of
them fit for sea. To this I had already made up my mind; and even
if the boats had been uninjured I doubt whether we could ever
have got them off again through the tremendous surf which was
breaking on this part of the shore; whilst to have moved them to
any distance would, in our present weak and enfeebled state, have
been utterly impossible.</p>

<p>ESTUARY AND LANDING-PLACE AND SCENERY ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>No resource was now left to us but to endeavour to reach Perth
by walking; yet when I looked at the sickly faces of some of the
party and saw their wasted forms I much doubted if they retained
strength to execute such a task; but they themselves were in high
spirits and talked of the undertaking as a mere trifle. I gave
orders for the necessary preparations to be made and then started
with two or three hands to search for water. On reaching the
valley I have before mentioned we found a small stream, and
following this to the northward for about a mile came out upon
one of the most romantic and picturesque-looking estuaries I had
yet seen: its shores abounded with springs and were bordered by
native paths, whilst the drooping foliage of several large sorts
of Casuarina, the number of wild swans on its placid bosom, and
the natives fishing in the distance, unconscious of our presence,
imparted to the whole scene a quiet and a charm which was deeply
felt by those who had now for so many days been either tossed
about by the winds and waves or had long been wandering over
barren and inhospitable shores. We did not indeed find much good
land about this estuary, but there were rich flats upon each side
of it, whilst the nature of the rocks and the lofty and peculiar
character of the distant hills gave promise of the most fertile
region I had yet seen in extra-tropical Australia.</p>

<p>We followed the shores of the estuary to the northward and
eastward until we saw a point where it appeared to separate into
two branches. The natives decamped as soon as they observed us
coming, and Kaiber, who watched them with the most intense
interest, indulged in various speculations as to the number they
would bring back when they returned. We joined the party and
traced the shores of the estuary to its mouth, which turned out
to be the opening we saw in the morning: this mouth is completely
sheltered by a line of breakers and reefs, which, although they
present a most formidable appearance from the sea, can be doubled
by keeping pretty close along the shore in approaching the mouth
of the river. Owing to this reef there are no breakers on the
bar, but its mouth is very narrow and so shoal that I doubt if a
boat could be got in at any other time than high water: some of
the sailors with me however thought otherwise; but there is at
all events convenient landing at this point under the shelter of
the reef.</p>

<p>FERTILE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>April 2.</p>

<p>The men not having quite completed their preparations for
starting, I moved off at dawn to resume the survey of Gantheaume
Bay and its vicinity. The estuary appeared this morning even more
lovely than yesterday, and as the heavy morning mists arose,
unfolding its beauties to our view, all those feelings came
thrilling through my mind which explorers alone can know;
flowering shrubs and trees, drooping foliage, a wide and placid
expanse of water met the view; trickling springs and fertile
flats were passed over by us; there was much barren land visible
in the distance, though many a sign and token might lead the
practical explorer to hope that he was about to enter upon a
tract of an extent and fertility yet unknown in south-west
Australia. A total change had taken place in the geological
formation of the land: a rock as yet unobserved in the south-west
portion of the continent occupied the principal place here; and
with this rock was associated limestone; the springs had a strong
sulphureous smell, and the lofty broken character of the distant
mountains had an almost grand appearance to those who had so long
wandered through low and level countries.</p>

<p>Each step I took rendered my spirits more buoyant and elastic,
and each hill, the position of which I fixed, gave me, from its
appearance, renewed hopes. Under such agreeable circumstances the
morning wore rapidly away, and, having rendered my survey as
complete as I could, we returned to the boats.</p>

<p>COMMENCE THE MARCH TO PERTH. PROVISIONS DIVIDED.</p>

<p>We were now all ready to commence our toilsome journey; the
provisions had been shared out; twenty pounds of flour and one
pound of salt provisions per man, being all that was left. What I
have here designated by the name of flour was quite unworthy of
being so called. It was of a dark yellowish brown colour, and had
such a sour fermented taste that nothing but absolute necessity
could induce anyone to eat it. The party however were in high
spirits; they talked of a walk of three hundred miles in a direct
line through the country (without taking hills, valleys, and
necessary deviations into account) as a trifle, and in
imagination were already feasting at home and taking their ease
after the toils they had undergone.</p>

<p>I gave them all warning of the many difficulties they had yet
to encounter, and did this not with the intention of damping
their ardour but in the hope of inducing them to abandon some
portion of the loads they intended to carry. I entrusted a small
pocket chronometer to Mr. Walker, and another to Corporals Coles
and Auger; and to Ruston I gave charge of a pocket-sextant which
belonged to the Surveyor-General at Perth. Coles and Auger also
undertook to carry a large sextant, turn about; all my own
papers, such charts as I thought necessary, and some smaller
instruments I bore myself; but Kaiber, in order to relieve me,
took charge of my gun and some other articles. Mr. Smith carried
his sketchbook and box of colours. I ought here to state that, in
all the difficulties which beset those individuals to whom I
entrusted anything, they never, except on one occasion, and by my
orders, abandoned it: indeed I do not believe that there is a
stronger instance of fidelity and perseverance than was evinced
by some of the party in retaining, under every difficulty,
possession of that which they had promised to preserve for
me.</p>

<p>PICTURESQUE HALTING-PLACE.</p>

<p>Our loads having been hoisted on our shoulders away we moved.
I had before chosen my line of route, and the plan I had resolved
to adopt was to walk on slowly but continuously for an hour, and
then to halt for ten minutes; during which interval of time the
men could rest and relieve themselves from the weight of their
burdens whilst I could enter what notes and bearings I had taken
during the preceding hour.</p>

<p>We were embarrassed for the first portion of our journey this
afternoon by a thick scrub, through which we could only make our
way with great difficulty, but on coming to a watercourse running
into the southern part of Gantheaume Bay from the south-east I
turned up its bed, and we were then able to move along with
tolerable facility. This watercourse ran at the bottom of a red
sandstone ravine resembling the old red sandstone of England; and
the remainder of the evening was spent in clambering about the
rocks and endeavouring to avoid such natural obstacles as impeded
our route. Our progress was slow, and just before nightfall I
turned up a branch ravine trending to the southward, when we soon
found ourselves at the foot of a lofty cascade down which a
little water was slowly dropping; and on climbing to its summit
it appeared to be so well adapted for a halting-place for the
night that I determined to remain here. The men made themselves
comfortable near the waterholes, and Mr. Smith and myself crept
into a little cave which occasionally served as a resting-place
for the natives, the remains of whose fires were scattered about.
A wild woodland and rocky scenery was around us; and when the
moon rose and shed her pale light over all I sat with Mr. Smith
on the edge of the waterfall, gazing alternately into the dim
woody abyss below, and at the red fires and picturesque groups of
men, than which fancy could scarcely image a wilder scene.</p>

<p>NATIVE PATH AND WELL.</p>

<p>April 3.</p>

<p>Before the day had fully dawned we were under weigh. Our
course for the first mile or two was embarrassed by ravines and
scrub similar to that we had yesterday met with; our progress was
therefore very slow, but we at length emerged on elevated sandy
downs, thickly clothed with banksia trees, and across these we
came upon a well-beaten native path running to the south by east,
which was exactly our line of route. We had not followed this
path for more than four miles when we found a most
romantically-situated native well, surrounded by shrubs and
graceful wattle trees, and of a depth and size such as we had
never before observed. Here then we seated ourselves, and upon
such scanty fare as we had made a sparing breakfast. This however
but very insufficiently supplied our wants; and as we sat at this
little well, thus surrounded with such fairy scenery, a variety
of philosophic reflections crossed our minds and found vent in
words. Nothing could be more delightfully romantic than our
present position. Both as regarded danger, scenery, savages, and
unknown lands, we were in precisely the situation in which Mr.
Cooper and other novelists delight to depict their travellers,
with this one woeful difference--our wallets were empty. It was
in vain I fumbled about in mine; I could neither find the remains
of a venison pasty, a fat buffalo's hump, or any other delicacy:
indeed I had not the means of keeping life and soul together for
many days longer. Deeply did we regret that we were not favoured
for a few days with the company of Mr. Cooper, that he might in
our present difficulties fully initiate us into the mysterious,
nay, almost miraculous means by which his travellers, even in the
most dreary wilds, always contrived to draw forth from their
stock of provender such dainties that the bare recollection of
them made our mouths water; but the necessities of the moment
would not permit me for more than a few minutes to indulge in
these speculations, and we turned therefore from seductive
travels of the imagination to the more stringent ones of
reality.</p>

<p>HEAVY LOADS CARRIED BY THE MEN.</p>

<p>I now entreated the men to disencumber themselves of a portion
of the loads which they were attempting to carry. Urged by a
miscalculating desire of gain, when the boats were abandoned they
had laid hands upon canvas and what else they thought would sell
at Perth, and some of them appeared to be resolved rather to risk
their lives than the booty they were bending under. The more
tractable threw away the articles I told them to get rid of; but
neither entreaties nor menaces prevailed with the others.</p>

<p>For the next three miles we still followed the native path
which continued to run south by east. The whole of this distance
was over open sandy downs, abounding in kangaroos; but we now
suddenly emerged into a rich limestone country of gently sloping
hills and valleys, affording, even at this season of the year,
fair feed for sheep or cattle, and we found springs of water at
every few hundred yards, generally situated at the edge of a
large clump of trees.</p>

<p>After having for some time rested here I quitted the native
path, which trended too much to the eastward, and, leaving also
the direction of the limestone country which ran inland, we
continued a south by east course over a gravelly tableland in
places covered with beds of clay on which rested ponds of water.
The country here was perfectly open, with clumps of trees to the
eastward. Emus and kangaroos were wandering about the plains.</p>

<p>DIFFICULT SCRUB.</p>

<p>Two miles more brought us to an almost impenetrable belt of
scrub which lay east and west, directly athwart our path, so that
we were obliged to face it; and in two hours and a half I had
forced my way through it. The others followed, slowly emerging
from the bush after me and, as we were all totally exhausted, as
well as dreadfully torn and bruised, we halted at its edge for
the night, and lighting our fires lay down to court that repose
we had so fairly earned. We had however only walked fifteen and a
half miles today.</p>

<p>April 4.</p>

<p>I again this morning used every effort to induce some more of
the men to abandon a portion of their loads. I represented to
them their weak state, the small supply of provisions they had
with them, and the difficulty they already found in keeping up
with the party; but all these arguments and every other I could
make use of were unavailing; the tenacity with which they clung
to a worthless property, even at the risk of their lives, is
almost incredible, and it is to be borne in mind that this
property was not their own, but what they had taken from the
wreck of the boats. Did I even induce one to throw anything away
another avaricious fellow would pick it up; and their thoughts
and conversation, instead of running upon making the best of
their way home and saying their lives, consisted in conjectures
as to what they would realize from their ill-gotten and
embarrassing booty.</p>

<p>SUPERIOR NATIVE PATH AND WELLS.</p>

<p>The course I pursued was one of 180 degrees and we soon fell
in with the native path which we had quitted yesterday; but it
now became wide, well beaten, and differing altogether by its
permanent character from any I had seen in the southern portion
of this continent. For the first five miles we traversed scrubby
stony hills, thickly wooded with banksia trees; but the limestone
here again cropped out and we entered a very fertile valley,
running north and south and terminating in a larger one which
drained the country from east to west. This valley is remarkable
as containing one Xanthorrhoea (grass-tree) being the farthest
point to the north at which I have found this tree. In it also
was a gigantic ant's nest, being the most southerly one I had yet
seen. All these circumstances convinced me that we were about to
enter a very interesting region. And as we wound along the native
path my wonder augmented; the path increased in breadth and in
its beaten appearance, whilst along the side of it we found
frequent wells, some of which were ten and twelve feet deep and
were altogether executed in a superior manner.</p>

<p>NATIVE WARRAN GROUND. PLAINS ABOUNDING IN THE WARRAN
PLANT.</p>

<p>We now crossed the dry bed of a stream and from that emerged
upon a tract of light fertile soil, quite overrun with warran
plants,* the root of which is a favourite article of food with
the natives. This was the first time we had yet seen this plant
on our journey, and now for three and a half consecutive miles we
traversed a fertile piece of land literally perforated with the
holes the natives had made to dig this root; indeed we could with
difficulty walk across it on that account, whilst this tract
extended east and west as far as we could see.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The Warran in a species of Dioscorea, a
sort of yam like the sweet potato. It is known by the same name
both on the east and west side of the continent.)</blockquote>

<p>It was now evident that we had entered the most
thickly-populated district of Australia that I had yet observed,
and moreover one which must have been inhabited for a long series
of years, for more had here been done to secure a provision from
the ground by hard manual labour than I could have believed it in
the power of uncivilised man to accomplish. After crossing a low
limestone range we came down upon another equally fertile warran
ground, bounded eastward by a high range of rocky limestone
hills, luxuriantly grassed, and westward by a low range of
similar formation. The native path about two miles further on
crossed this latter range, and we found ourselves in a grassy
valley, about four miles wide, bounded seawards by sandy downs.
Along its centre lay a chain of reedy freshwater swamps, and
native paths ran in from all quarters to one main line of
communication leading to the southward.</p>

<p>DANGERS OF DELAY.</p>

<p>In these swamps we first found the yunjid, or flag (a species
of typha) and the sow-thistle of the southern districts; one we
came to was a thick tea-tree swamp, extremely picturesque, and
producing abundance of these plants, some of which were collected
by the men to eat in the evening. To my surprise Mr. Walker here
came up to me and asked if I did not think it would be better to
halt for a day or two at places of this kind to allow the men to
refresh themselves. The idea of men halting and wasting their
strength and energies in searching for native food whilst they
had so fearful a journey before them, and no supplies, appeared
to me to be preposterous in the extreme: to obtain a sufficiency
of food, even for a native, requires in Australia a great degree
of skill and knowledge of the productions of the country; but for
a European, utterly unaccustomed to this species of labour and
totally unacquainted with the productions of the land, to obtain
enough to support life for any period, whilst at the same time he
has to search for water, is quite impossible. Even Kaiber, from
his ignorance of the roots, declared that he should starve in
this country. I saw therefore that did I adopt the proposed plan
of travelling only a few miles a day, and occasionally halting
for a day or two to refresh ourselves upon some thistles and
periwinkles, I should infallibly sacrifice the lives of the whole
party; and under this impression I declined to accede to the
suggestion. Amongst indolent and worn-out men however it
subsequently became an extremely popular notion, and, as future
events clearly showed, a fatally erroneous one. I from the first
opposed it both by my words and example; and in this instance, as
soon as I conceived that the men were sufficiently rested, I
moved on.</p>

<p>PICTURESQUE ESTUARY.</p>

<p>After travelling another mile we found ourselves at the head
of a large and picturesque estuary which lay north and south; the
native path ran along its shores, which were of great richness
and beauty, and the estuary itself lay to our west and was about
two miles across; on the east a series of rich undercliff
limestone hills gradually rose into lofty and precipitate ranges,
between which and the estuary was the fertile valley along which
we wound our weary way; while groups of graceful acacias with
their airy and delicate foliage gave a great charm to this
beautiful spot. We moved slowly along, and ere we had made two
miles more the shades of night began to fall and I halted the
party.</p>

<p>RICH AND FERTILE DISTRICT.</p>

<p>The abundance of grass which grew around enabled us to enjoy
the almost unknown luxury of a soft bed, yet as I lay down my
thoughts were far from pleasant when I found that we had only
walked twelve miles today, and this distance had been
accomplished by several of the party with the greatest
difficulty. Three of them were the men who carried those heavy
loads which I could not yet induce them to abandon; now I could
not but reflect that, if their difficulty was so great in walking
in a country abounding with water, that it would be almost
impossible for them to get along in one where it was scarce;
moreover the mere physical exertion of getting unwilling men to
move by persuasions and entreaties was harassing in the extreme,
and indeed had so agitated me that the night had nearly worn away
ere I closed my eyes. The rich flats we were on today have
apparently at no distant period formed part of the head of the
estuary.</p>

<p>April 5.</p>

<p>Such a heavy dew had fallen during the night that when I got
up in the morning I found my clothes completely saturated, and
everything looked so verdant and flourishing compared to the
parched up country which existed to the north of us, and that
which I knew lay to the south, that I tried to find a
satisfactory reason to explain so strange a circumstance, but
without success. It seemed certain however that we stood in the
richest province of South-west Australia, and one which so
differs from the other portions of it in its geological
characters, in the elevations of its mountains which lie close to
the sea coast, in the fertility of its soil, and the density of
its native population, that we appeared to be moving upon another
continent. As yet however the only means I had of judging of the
large number of natives inhabiting this district had been from
their paths and warran grounds, but it was most probable that we
should ere long fall in with some of them.</p>

<p>We started at dawn pursuing a south-south-east direction, and
at the end of one mile rounded a bluff point; the limestone hills
to the eastward gradually decreased in elevation and we ascended
one of them to gain a view of the surrounding country. I found
that the summit of this range consisted of a terrace about half a
mile wide, richly grassed and ornamented with clumps of mimosas;
to the eastward rose a precisely similar limestone terrace,
whilst to the westward lay the estuary with its verdant and
extensive flats.</p>

<p>APPEARANCE OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>As we wound our way along this terrace a large party of
natives suddenly appeared on the high ground to the eastward of
us. They evinced no fear whatever but advanced to within about
two hundred yards, when I went forward with Kaiber to induce them
to hold an interview with us; this however I could not bring
about, for whenever I advanced they retreated, and when I retired
they advanced; they also now began to shout out to their distant
fellows, and these again cooeed to others still farther off,
until the calls were lost in the distance, whilst fresh
reinforcements of natives came trooping in from all
directions.</p>

<p>INDICATIONS OF HOSTILITY. PROGRESS OPPOSED BY NATIVES.</p>

<p>Our situation was growing critical for had any of the party
been wounded we could not attempt to save his life by remaining
with him without the almost certain danger of losing our own,
whilst on the other hand to have abandoned him under such
circumstances would have been impossible. I was most anxious to
get rid of these natives in peace, as they now could not be
induced to come to us, being most probably fearful of our
numbers. I hoped therefore they would let us go quietly on our
way and moved the party forward; but they now followed us with
loud shouts, whilst those in the distance came running up. I
again halted but they would hold no communication, and when in
despair I again moved the party on we saw a number hastening to
occupy a thick scrub through which we had to pass. The men now
became so dissatisfied and alarmed that I found I should be
unable much longer to restrain them from firing if I did not
disperse the natives.</p>

<p>I therefore halted the party, and cocking my gun moved rapidly
towards them, motioning them away; they retired as I advanced,
but directly I turned they again followed us; I now ran towards
them with my gun pointed, when they made off before me once more,
and in order to complete their dispersion I had intended to fire
over their heads; but to my great mortification and their intense
delight, my gun snapped, and, as they found the weapon I had with
me, and with which I had menaced them in so authoritative a
manner, appeared to produce no effect, they took courage, and,
turning about, made faces at me and an insulting noise which was
meant to imitate the snapping of the gun. Their inimical
intentions now became more manifest; I however ran at them again,
and fired my second barrel over their heads, which caused a rapid
retreat; but they halted on a rising ground about three hundred
yards from us, and finding on the muster of their forces that
they had sustained no damage, they made preparations, as if
resolved to commence hostilities in earnest.</p>

<p>NATIVES DISPERSED.</p>

<p>As these natives had now unfortunately learnt to despise our
weapons I was compelled to act promptly, or blood would
undoubtedly have been shed. I therefore took my rifle from Coles
and, directing it at a heap of closely matted dead bushes which
were distant two or three yards to the right of their main body,
I drove a ball right through it: the dry rotten boughs crackled,
and flew in all directions, whilst our enemy, utterly confounded
at this distant, novel, and unfair mode of warfare, fled from the
field in confusion, the majority of our party rejoicing at the
bloodless victory: we then wended our way along the native path
which led us down to the flats bordering the estuary, and finding
there an underground stream of water bubbling along through a
limestone cavity and having several openings upwards, we halted
to refresh ourselves.</p>

<p>I had hoped that finding hostile natives in our vicinity would
have made the stragglers keep up better with the party, but they
would neither hasten on nor throw away their loads, so that my
patience was sorely tried; a man of the name of Stiles was the
worst; nothing could induce him to move along, and even the
threat of leaving him behind produced no effect; I however kept
pushing steadily onwards, for I never thought of the length of
the journey we had to perform without trembling for the result.
We were now walking on a course of 180 degrees, and followed this
line for two miles and a half through a similar country. We still
found many native paths running along the estuary, and saw the
natives fishing, but they carefully avoided us, making off for
the high lands as fast as they could.</p>

<p>ESTUARY OF THE HUTT RIVER. DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY AND
SCENERY.</p>

<p>The estuary became narrower here, and shortly after seeing
these natives we came upon a river running into it from the
eastward; its mouth was about forty yards wide, the stream
strong, but the water brackish, and it flowed through a very deep
ravine, having steep limestone hills on each side: many
wild-fowls were on the river, but we could not get a shot at
them. Being unable to ford the river here we followed it in a
south-east direction for two miles, and in this distance passed
two native villages, or, as the men termed them, towns, the huts
of which they were composed differed from those in the southern
districts in being much larger, more strongly built, and very
nicely plastered over the outside with clay and clods of turf, so
that although now uninhabited they were evidently intended for
fixed places of residence. This again showed a marked difference
between the habits of the natives of this part of Australia and
the south-western portions of the continent; for these superior
huts, well marked roads, deeply sunk wells, and extensive warran
grounds, all spoke of a large and comparatively-speaking resident
population, and the cause of this undoubtedly must have been the
great facilities for procuring food in so rich a soil.</p>

<p>MOUNT VICTORIA AND MOUNT ALBERT.</p>

<p>We now came to two very remarkable hills bearing north-east of
us and distant about three miles, which I have named Mount
Victoria and Mount Albert. They lay about one mile apart, and
were of the form shown in Illustration 2, which will give a good
idea of the flat-topped hills hereabouts.</p>

<p><b>2. Mount Victoria and Mount Albert.</b></p>
</center>

<p>THE HUTT RIVER.</p>

<p>The river still ran in a deep wooded valley bordered by rich
flats, high hills lying both to the right and left of our line of
route. Two miles and a half more on a course of 135 degrees
brought us out on some gravelly barren plains, and just before
coming to these, and in passing through a scrub, we raised a
flight of white cockatoos, of a species new to me. One of the men
got an ineffectual shot at them.</p>

<p>FIRST HILLS OF THE SOUTHERN IRONSTONE FORMATION.</p>

<p>After traversing these plains for two miles in a south-east
direction we came upon a valley through which flowed a branch of
the river we had this day discovered, running in a bed of fifty
yards across, and having in its centre a rapid stream falling in
small cascades; it appeared at times subject to extensive
inundations, and here its course was through barren plains
covered with rocks piled up in strange fantastic masses, and the
bed was composed of that kind of red sandstone which at Perth is
called ironstone; this being the farthest point north at which I
have remarked it.</p>

<p>A number of grass-trees (Xanthorrhoea) grew near the spot
where we had halted; they appeared unhealthy and stunted, but
indeed I suspect they are a new and undescribed variety. Being
desirous of procuring anything I could for the men to eat I had
the tops of some of these trees cut off and boiled, they were
however still so hard that to chew them was impossible, and it
was evident that we had not yet reached a parallel of latitude
calculated to produce tender-topped grass trees.</p>

<p>I knew our latitude and position this night exactly, as I had
seen Mount Naturaliste of the French in the course of the day.
There could be no doubt whatever that we were in a very
remarkable district, for we stood upon the point where the
geological formations of the north-western and south-western
portions of the continent were associated together, and the flora
of which was so made up of those of both that it was impossible
to tell which predominated. There were many other interesting
circumstances connected with the surrounding country, some of
which have been already mentioned. I named the river and estuary
now discovered the Hutt after William Hutt, Esquire, M.P.,
brother of His Excellency the Governor of Western Australia.</p>

<p>INDISPOSITION OF MR. SMITH.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith this day complained of weakness, not sufficiently
however in the least to alarm me. He had hitherto been nearly
always in the rear of the party without lagging, but I thought
two of the men in a much weaker state than he was.</p>

<p><a name="chapter2"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2. FROM THE HUTT RIVER TO WATER PEAK.</h2>

<p>WILD TURKEYS SEEN.</p>

<p>April 6.</p>

<p>We moved off this morning on a course of 180 degrees. The
first mile of our journey was over low scrubby ironstone hills.
We then came down upon rich flats through which the main branch
of the Hutt ran; and followed the course of this branch for about
two miles. It was not running but there were many pools with
water in its bed: the flats were rich and grassy and on the hills
to the westward (the Menai Hills) we descried wild turkeys, being
the farthest point north at which I had seen this bird.</p>

<p>As I saw that the ground in front of us was very steep and
abrupt, so that the weak and weary would have found it a
difficult task to master such an ascent, I turned off on a course
of 168 degrees, ascending a sandy tableland covered with scrub.
When we had walked three miles in this direction the table-hill
of Captain King bore east by south distant five miles. We now
proceeded parallel to the sea, which was distant one mile through
an indifferent country. This course continued for about five
miles, and on the ranges to the eastward the country still
appeared to be grassy and good.</p>

<p>RELUCTANCE OF THE MEN TO HASTEN ONWARDS. DIFFICULTY OF URGING
THE PARTY FORWARD.</p>

<p>Although we had walked very slowly many of the party were
completely exhausted, and one or two of the discontented ones
pretended to be dreadfully in want of water, notwithstanding they
carried canteens and had only walked eight miles since leaving
the bank of a river; I was therefore obliged to halt, and could
not get them to move for three hours. I am sorry to say that some
who should have known much better endeavoured to instil into the
minds of the men that it was preferable only to walk a few miles
a day and not to waste their strength by long marches; utterly
forgetting that most of the party had now only seven or eight
pounds of fermented flour left, and that if they did not make
play whilst they had strength their eventually reaching Perth was
quite hopeless. This however was a very popular doctrine for
thoughtless and weary men, who were overloaded and yet from a
feeling of avarice would not abandon any portion of what they
were carrying. The majority of the party not only adopted these
views in theory but doggedly carried them into practice; and from
this moment I abandoned all hope of getting the whole party into
the settled districts in safety. Poor fellows! most of them paid
dearly for the mistaken notions they now adopted. Mr. Smith, with
his usual spirit, was for pushing on, although his strength was
inadequate to the task. I laid under the shade of a bush lost in
gloomy reveries and temporary unpopularity; Kaiber by my side
lulled me with native songs composed for the occasion, and in
prospective I saw all the dread sufferings which were to befall
the doomed men who sat around me, confident of their success
under the new plan; but like all prophets I was without honour
amongst my own acquaintance; and after considering the matter
under every point of view I thought it better for the moment to
succumb to the general feeling, yet to lose no opportunity on
every subsequent occasion of endeavouring to rouse the party into
a degree of energy suited to our desperate circumstances.</p>

<p>At the end of the three hours I again begged several of the
party, who appeared to be in an exhausted state, to abandon a
portion of their useless loads; but they were quite sure that by
making short marches, not exhausting their strength, and now and
then halting for a day or two to refresh, they could carry them
into Perth, and therefore refused to part with them. Mr. Smith
and myself found that stopping in this way and getting cold
rendered our limbs so stiff and painful when we walked on again
that we could scarcely move; and I suspect that such was the case
with the other men, for when we started again I could hardly get
them along. One man of the name of Stiles, who was a stout
supporter of the new theory, made us stop for him nearly every
five minutes.</p>

<p>THE BOWES RIVER.</p>

<p>After walking one mile we fortunately came to a very deep
valley, having such steep limestone cliffs on each side that it
assumed quite the character of a ravine: it was about a mile wide
and in it was a watercourse winding through deep flats. We
however only found water in pools; the course of the stream was
very tortuous and its mouth was almost blocked up by sandhills.
The valley itself was both picturesque and fertile, and the
appearance of the country to the east and north-east was highly
promising. The stream I called the Bowes.</p>

<p>NATIVE RESTING-PLACE. NATIVE HUTS.</p>

<p>This spot was a favourite halting-place of the natives; and
from the number of huts and other indications which we saw the
district must be very densely populated. The huts were of the
same superior construction as those which we had seen near the
Hutt, and the traces were very recent, but the natives themselves
were either at a distance or kept carefully out of our way. The
valley that we were now in, as well as the other limestone
valleys in this province, partook exactly of the character of
those in the carboniferous limestone districts of England
inasmuch as they were deep gorges, or ravines, now traversed by
watercourses or streams apparently much too insignificant to have
grooved them out.</p>

<p>PROVOKING INDOLENCE OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>Our finding water here was fortunate for I now showed the men
that, had they walked one mile farther instead of halting in the
manner they had done, they would have had abundance of it, and
would have been, at this moment, at least, five miles nearer
home. I also directed Mr. Walker to examine Stiles and to state
whether he was in good health or not. He did so and reported him
quite well. I therefore when we started again gave Stiles warning
that I should not halt every minute for him but would leave him
behind, at the same time ordering him to walk in front of the
party, next after me.</p>

<p>I continued a course of 180 degrees up a steep limestone
range, behind which apparently ran a branch of the watercourse we
had just passed: a good country lay to the eastward of us. Stiles
now delayed us so much that some of his comrades spoke to him
very warmly on the subject, whilst others still held to the
opinion that walking a few miles a day and sometimes halting a
day or two to refresh was the true mode of proceeding. We only
made two miles this evening and I threw myself on the ground so
worn and harassed that I could not sleep.</p>

<p>AN EXTENSIVE FERTILE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>Sunday April 7.</p>

<p>Before the sun had appeared above the horizon I managed to get
the party fairly started, and we followed a course of 180 degrees
over elevated sandy downs which rested on a limestone formation.
The first four miles of our journey was not very encouraging; we
could only see as far to the eastward as the flat-topped range;
and although the slopes of these hills looked very fertile I had
no means of judging how far back this good country extended; we
had however been creeping gradually up an ascent, and when we
gained the summit of this I turned to look to the northward after
the straggling party, who were slowly mounting the hill, some of
them staggering along under loads so heavy that I should have
hated the tyranny of any man who could have compelled them to
carry such a weight; but as it was I could only grieve to see
men, from the hope of gain, rushing so inevitably on their fate.
Having gazed till weary at this painful picture of the weakness
of human nature, I turned to the north-eastward, and there burst
upon my sight a most enchanting view. In the far east, that is,
some twenty or five-and-twenty miles away, stretched a lofty
chain of mountains, flat-topped and so regular in their outline
that they appeared rather the work of art than of nature. Between
this range and the nearest one lay a large rich valley vying with
the most fertile I have ever seen in an extra-tropical country.
In front of us lay another valley which drained a portion of the
large one, and in both rose gently swelling hills and picturesque
peaks, wooded in the most romantic manner. Whilst I stood and
looked on this scene, my woes were forgotten. Such moments as
these repay an explorer for much toil and trouble.</p>

<p>THE VICTORIA RANGE AND DISTRICT. THE PROVINCE OF VICTORIA.</p>

<p>The distant range I at once named the Victoria in honour of
Her Majesty; and being now certain that the district we were in
was one of the most fertile in Australia I named it the Province
of Victoria. There is no other part of extra-tropical Australia
which can boast of the same number of streams in an equal extent
of coast frontage, or which has such elevated land so near the
sea; and I have seen no other which has so large an extent of
good country. It is however bounded both to the north and south
by comparatively-speaking unproductive districts; but what the
character of the country to the north-east and south-east may be
still remains to be ascertained.</p>

<p>Another mile on a course of 180 degrees brought us to the
valley in our front; it was of the same rich and romantic
character as that which I have just described, being in depth
about two hundred feet, down limestone rocks, in places assuming
the character of cliffs. In its bottom was a watercourse
containing water in pools only; but it must be borne in mind that
it was now the very end of the dry season. The party all came up,
and we laid ourselves down under the grateful shade of the
mimosas. Those who chose took their fill of water. I had made a
rule never to taste it except to wash out my mouth from sunrise
until we halted for the night; for I found that drinking water
promoted profuse perspiration and more ardent thirst, and I
preferred practising a little self-denial to enduring the greater
pangs arising from indulgence.</p>

<p>Whilst I stretched my weary length along under the pleasant
shade I saw in fancy busy crowds throng the scenes I was then
amongst. I pictured to myself the bleating sheep and lowing herds
wandering over these fertile hills; and I chose the very spot on
which my house should stand, surrounded with as fine an
amphitheatre of verdant land as the eye of man has ever gazed on.
The view was backed by the Victoria Range, whilst seaward you
looked out through a romantic glen upon the great Indian Ocean. I
knew that within four or five years civilization would have
followed my tracks, and that rude nature and the savage would no
longer reign supreme over so fine a territory. Mr. Smith entered
eagerly into my thoughts and views: together we built these
castles in the air, trusting we should see happy results spring
from our present sufferings and labours, but within a few weeks
from this day he died in the wilds he was exploring.</p>

<p>THE BULLER RIVER.</p>

<p>The stream we were on I named the Buller; we rested some time
by it and when we moved on some of the advocates of the eight or
ten mile a day system very unwillingly followed the party. We
fell in with a native path which wound up through a thick scrub
in pleasing sinuosities, and emerged upon a tableland similar to
the one we had traversed this morning.</p>

<p>THE CHAPMAN RIVER.</p>

<p>I now followed a course of 169 degrees, and after walking
three miles more we arrived at the edge of a valley of the same
character as that wherein the Buller flowed, and through it we
had another view of the fertile country to the eastward: into
this valley we descended and, finding a watercourse running
through it with water in pools, I seated myself with such of the
party as were up, about half a quarter of a mile from the Mount
Fairfax of Captain King, and named this stream the Chapman.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR A MISSING MAN.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker now came up with the remainder of the party and
reported that Stiles was missing. As he could have no difficulty
in finding us I merely took the precaution to make the men sit in
such positions that he could distinguish us from the summit of
the opposite cliffs when he arrived there, and we patiently
awaited that moment. Time however wore on, and some of the men
finding a species of geranium with a root not unlike a very small
and tough parsnip, we prepared and ate several messes of this
plant. At length, no signs of Stiles having been seen, I sent Mr.
Walker, Corporal Auger, and Kaiber to the top of the cliffs we
had descended to try if they could discern anything of him or his
tracks. During their absence I expressed, in the hearing of some
of the men, my anxiety lest he should have lingered behind and
have fallen in with the natives; upon which they smiled and said
that "Tom Stiles was a man who did not care about the natives;
and that only that morning he had said he didn't mind for all the
natives in the island, d--- them;" and that they thought he had
stopped behind on purpose.</p>

<p>GATHERING OF NATIVES. SCENE WITH NATIVES.</p>

<p>The absence of Mr. Walker and his party continued much longer
than I expected, and just at the moment that I had become rather
alarmed about it Coles reported to me that he saw natives on the
opposite cliff, jumping about and running up and down brandishing
their spears in the manner they do before and after a fight.
Coles was at this time posted as sentry on a terrace just above
where we were, and the ascent to which was very difficult. I got
up on this as fast as I could; it was only two or three yards
broad and ran apparently along the whole length of the valley.
The natives used it as a path, and a very steep hill rose behind
it. I could not however make out the natives, and as the opposite
cliffs were a long way off I thought that Coles might have been
mistaken. When I told him this he merely said "Look there, then,
Sir," and pointed to the top of Mount Fairfax, distant about 400
yards due north of us, and sure enough there were a party of
natives, well armed and going through a variety of ceremonies
which the experience of centuries had proved to be highly
efficacious in getting rid of evil spirits. In the present
instance however their wonted efficacy failed, but the natives
appeared every moment to be getting more vehement in their
gestures.</p>

<p>Our situation by no means pleased me: Stiles and a separate
party of our own men had mysteriously disappeared in the
direction where Coles had first seen the natives, by whom we were
in a manner surrounded, and that in an abominable position, for
they could steal amongst the underwood close above us in our
rear, and annoy us with missiles of all sorts; whilst from the
extent and thickness of the scrub it was impossible to occupy it
effectually against treacherous (or rather, bold and skilful)
enemies. On the other hand I could not quit my present position
and occupy a more favourable one, for, in the event of Mr. Walker
and Corporal Auger being pressed by the natives and retreating on
us, it was our duty to be at that spot where they would calculate
on finding us and an effectual assistance. I made therefore the
best disposition of my little force I could, and, occupying the
centre of the party, I had the satisfaction of seeing our wild
friends on Mount Fairfax, blowing strongly at us and capering
more furiously than ever when they beheld our unaccountable
manoeuvres.</p>

<p>THEIR MANOEUVRES.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that poor Kaiber was absent, for so fearful
an exhibition of sorcery would have altogether upset his nerves;
but the British soldiers and sailors I had with me remained
surprisingly calm; whilst the natives, having exhibited their
antics for a few minutes more, suddenly withdrew in a hurried
manner. I therefore made up my mind for a surprise, and we
anxiously waited to see from what quarter the attack would
come.</p>

<p>CONTINUATION OF SEARCH FOR THE MISSING MAN. RETURN OF PARTY
FROM SEARCH.</p>

<p>The cause of their disappearance was however soon explained.
Mr. Walker, Corporal Auger, and Kaiber came winding down the
hills under Mount Fairfax, and gave the following account of
their proceedings: On ascending the cliffs opposite to us they
had found Stiles's tracks, and had followed them until they
reached the sea beach; on passing the stream on their way there
they found a place where he had halted and made up all his flour
into dampers; but on coming out on the shore they saw a large
party of natives seated on the sandhills in front, whilst others
were fishing in the sea at this point; and the tracks of Stiles
turned off into the interior: this hero, who wished to encounter
all the natives of the island single-handed, had evidently fled
from them. Mr. Walker had been unable to follow his tracks any
further and had therefore thought it most prudent to return to
the main party.</p>

<p>From the circumstances of Stiles having thrown away part of
his clothes, and having made such a large quantity of dough to
bake into dampers at the first convenient opportunity, together
with various expressions he had dropped in the presence of the
men, there could be no doubt but that he had purposely quitted
the party; yet to abandon him to his fate amongst natives, who
were by no means friendly in their gestures and appearance,
required a degree of resolution I was unprepared at that moment
to exercise. To leave him without a search was to sacrifice one
life, to allow one man to perish, whilst occupying one or two
days in looking for him would merely increase the temporary
sufferings of the rest; whilst the loss of time would probably
occasion no other bad result than a little more personal
privation; and this, in order to try to save the life of a
fellow-creature, I conceived it to be my own duty and that of the
rest of the party to undergo. Influenced by these reasons I
desired all hands to prepare to start in search of Stiles.</p>

<p>Strange however to say, my resolution was scarcely made known
ere much grumbling arose; and this chiefly amongst those men who
had lately been loudest in their praises of the system of only
marching a few miles a day and occasionally halting for a day or
two where we could get native roots to eat, in fact, amongst
those whose foolish ideas had led Stiles to desert the party. We
however moved on in the direction of the spot where Kaiber had
lost the tracks, and on our way over the high ground we met a
native with his spear and a handful of fish; he was lost in
thought and we were close to him before he saw us: when he did so
he took no notice whatever of us, but without even quickening his
pace continued in his original line of direction, which crossed
ours obliquely. As he evidently did not wish to communicate with
us I directed the men not to take the least notice of him, and
thus we passed one another. He must have been a very brave fellow
to act so coolly as he did when an array so strange to him met
his eye.</p>

<p>ANOTHER PARTY OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>On arriving at the beach to the south of a bay or harbour,*
which the pressure of circumstances precluded me from examining,
we could find nothing of Stiles's tracks: he appeared to have
gone off due east in the hope of crossing our route, but, being
in advance of us, and consequently not finding our traces, it was
impossible to say in which direction he might have turned. The
natives now mustered a very large force and occupied the high
hills (almost cliffs) which lay a few hundred yards to our left,
and, as they had such an advantageous position and could at any
moment surprise us amongst the low sandhills where we were
searching for Stiles's footsteps, our situation was one of great
danger. At length, finding it impossible to keep the men steady,
I moved them up to the higher ground, where we could have met the
natives upon a footing of equality. They appeared, although very
numerous, to be now by no means hostile, merely standing on a
high hill, watching us and calling out "Yoongar kaw," or "Oh,
people!" whilst Kaiber, who knew nothing of their vile magical
practices, and therefore regarded them as mere ordinary flesh and
blood, was very ready to communicate with them; but as they made
no other advances, I thought it better merely to remain near them
for the night, occasionally firing a gun in hopes Stiles might
hear it, and with this intention I selected a spot for our
encampment.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. For a further description of this
harbour, which has been since denominated Port Grey, see the
account of the schooner Champion's Expedition in the 6th
chapter.)</blockquote>

<p>April 8.</p>

<p>We started very early this morning and Kaiber exerted himself
to the utmost to find Stiles's traces. At the end of three miles,
on a course of 180 degrees, we descended from the elevated
scrubby plains we had been moving along to the lowlands, and on
reaching this came upon the bed of a small watercourse. I here
halted the party; and as it was uncertain when we might again
fall in with water I commenced a search for it with Kaiber, but
after travelling rapidly over a good deal of ground without
seeing either water or any traces of Stiles we rejoined the party
very much fatigued.</p>

<p>THE MAN FOUND.</p>

<p>For the next two and a half miles we wound along low, grassy,
swampy plains, thinly wooded with clumps of Acacias, and then
entered upon low scrubby plains bounding the sea-shore. I here
caught sight of Stiles just ahead of us and coming in from the
eastward: he was very glad once more to find himself in safety;
and his comrades seemed pleased to see him again, although many a
suppressed murmur had met my ears during our morning's walk at
the trouble I was taking to look for him.</p>

<p>THE GREENOUGH RIVER.</p>

<p>Four miles further over similar plains in a south by east
direction brought us to a river, about five-and-twenty yards
wide, which I named the Greenough; and travelling up it a short
distance we found a spot where we could cross by stepping from
rock to rock. Its waters were quite salt. I continued our route
for about three miles, when I found it was impossible to induce
some of the men to walk any further; they laid sullenly down and
were so fully convinced that I was pursuing a wrong system in
marching so far in a day, and never halting for two or three days
to refresh, as they wished, that I could do nothing with them,
and was therefore forced to sit down too. Corporal Auger soon
afterwards found water near us, and I moved the party down to
it.</p>

<p>Finding water in some degree revived their spirits and I
contrived to get them to proceed seven miles more before
nightfall, the way being over sandy open plains very favourable
for walking.</p>

<p>MORE NATIVE HUTS.</p>

<p>We passed a large assemblage of native huts of the same
permanent character as those I have before mentioned: there were
two groups of those houses close together in a sequestered nook
in a wood, which taken collectively would have contained at least
a hundred and fifty natives. We halted for the night in the dry
bed of a watercourse, abounding in grass, so that we again
enjoyed the luxury of a soft bed. At first I thought that we were
near natives from hearing a plaintive cry like that of a child,
but Kaiber assured me that it was the cry of the young of the
wild turkey.</p>

<p>CROSS THE HEADS OF TWO BAYS.</p>

<p>In the course of this day we travelled across the heads of two
bays, which were indistinctly visible through the woods.</p>

<p>FERTILE VALLEY.</p>

<p>April 9.</p>

<p>The first three miles of our route this day lay over sandy
scrubby plains; we saw however a good country to the eastward. I
found that a man of the name of Charley Woods was much knocked
up; he was a supporter of the eight or nine miles a day system,
and had a very heavy load with no portion of which could I induce
him to part; he however insisted on sitting down every half mile
and detaining the party, and as I found that they got more worn
out and weaker, and the impression in favour of long rests and
short marches became much stronger, I thought it more prudent to
acquiesce for the present.</p>

<p>We now reached a very thick belt of trees, pushing through
which was a task of great difficulty, but at length we emerged
upon some clear hills overlooking a very extensive and fertile
valley, from which arose so dense a fog that portions of it
appeared to be a large lake. Into this valley we descended, and
the remainder of the day until near noon was spent by me in
endeavouring to get the men to move.</p>

<p>THE IRWIN RIVER. AUSTRALIND.</p>

<p>We this morning for the first time met with Zamia trees, and
about 12 P.M. came down upon the large sandy bed of a dried up
river which I named the Irwin after my friend Major Irwin, the
Commandant at Swan River; following this for half a mile we found
a native well, dug to a considerable depth in the bed, but all
our scraping here was vain. Water was found at a great depth, but
so shallow that we could not dip it up. Some of the men saw four
native boys playing in the grassy plains near us; directly
however the little fellows perceived us, they scampered off at
their utmost speed, and no doubt ever since that period they have
been firm believers in the existence of ghosts.</p>

<p>The men now began to complain much of the want of water, and I
for some time followed the traces of these native boys, who had
come from the southward and eastward, in the hope that their
tracks would lead us to it, but the grumbling and discontent of
some of the men was so great that I found it almost impossible to
induce them to move. My object was to get them to walk to a high
peaked hill distant about five miles from us in a due south-east
direction, and under which I felt certain, from its height, that
we should find water, but I was obliged at last to give up this
idea: Charles Woods would not stir at all, and several of the men
followed his example; they laid down on the ground and no
inducement could prevail on them either to move or to abandon a
portion of their loads; and this obstinacy on their part was
accompanied in some instances with the most blasphemous and
horrid expressions. Indeed I could not conceal from myself the
fact of its being the general impression that my mode of
proceeding was "killing the men," and that consequently some of
them had arrived at the resolution of compelling me by their
conduct to adopt their favourite system of short marches and long
halts. But I was still aware of the disastrous consequences which
must necessarily result from such a mode of proceeding, and
determined to have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon I managed to get the party to
move about a mile and a half in an easterly direction, but they
here again sat down and could neither be induced to walk or to
part with their bundles.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR WATER.</p>

<p>As they had not tasted water today I selected the best
walkers, namely, Corporals Auger and Coles, Hackney, Henry Woods,
and Kaiber, and went off to look for some to bring to the rest.
We were now on a well-beaten native path which traversed a
fertile tract of country, and along this we continued our route,
walking as rapidly as we could, for night was coming on apace.
From this path we made frequent divergencies but found no water;
in one instance we met with a native well of great depth, where a
party of them had been drinking a few days before, but it was now
quite dry.</p>

<p>FIND IT AT WATER PEAK. WATER PEAK HILL.</p>

<p>We therefore continued our search, and just as it was growing
dark had made about seven miles of a circuitous course and found
ourselves at the foot of the high-peaked hill seen this morning,
named by me Water Peak. I still hurried along the native path,
and was so wrapped up in the thoughts of our present position
that I passed, without seeing it, a beautiful spring that rose to
within a few inches of the surface. Near this the natives had
built a small hut, covered with boughs, concealed in which they
might kill the birds and animals which came to drink at this lone
water; the keen eye of Coles in a moment detected the little
pool, and our thirst was soon assuaged.</p>

<p>For a few minutes we lay on the bank of this clear spring,
resting our wearied limbs and admiring the scenery around us.
There is a something in the wild luxuriance of a totally new and
uncultivated country which words cannot convey to the inhabitant
of an old and civilized land, the rich and graceful forms of the
trees, the massy moss-grown trunks which cumber the soil, the
tree half uptorn by some furious gale and still remaining in the
falling posture in which the winds have left it, the drooping
disorder of dead and dying branches, the mingling of rich grasses
and useless weeds, all declare that here man knows not the
luxuries the soil can yield him: it was over such a scene,
rendered still more lovely by the falling shadows of night, that
our eyes now wandered.</p>

<p>BENIGHTED IN RETURNING TO THE PARTY.</p>

<p>I roused the men again and we commenced our return to the
party, loaded with a supply of water. It was now dark and we soon
wandered from the path. Kaiber took a star for his guide and led
us straight across the country; but our route lay through a
warran ground, full of holes, and in the darkness of the night we
every now and then had a tremendous tumble, so that at the end of
about four miles I thought that it would be imprudent to proceed
farther, as we every moment were in danger of breaking a limb or
seriously injuring ourselves. I therefore halted for the night,
and as we were unable to light a fire both on account of the
heavy dew and of having no proper materials with us, the first
portion of it passed wretchedly enough, indeed, weary as I was, I
found it necessary to walk about in order to preserve some slight
degree of warmth in my frame.</p>

<p>At length however the men, who were much too cold to sleep,
got up and, renewing their efforts, succeeded in kindling a
blaze. Kaiber soon collected plenty of wood, and as I was unable
to sleep I passed the night in meditating on our present
state.</p>

<p>POSITION AND PROSPECTS.</p>

<p>I felt sure that if the men persisted in their resolution of
moving slowly a lingering and dreadful death awaited us all; yet
my opinion was a solitary one. Mr. Walker had in many instances
plainly and publicly shown that he on this point differed with
me; and he was a medical man, and one who certainly never shrank
from any danger or toil which he thought it his duty to
encounter. The most therefore I could say against those who were
opposed to my system of moving was that I conceived them to be
guilty of a grievous error in judgment; but it was not until our
separate opinions had been tested by the future that it could be
definitely pronounced who was right. Nevertheless those who have
been much with men compelled to make long marches cannot fail to
have remarked how readily and foolishly they find excuses to
enable them to obtain a halt, and such persons would probably
have agreed with me in suspecting that natural indolence of
disposition, strengthened by fatigue and privation, might induce
men to adopt, without a very strict investigation, any opinion
falling in with their immediate feelings of feebleness.</p>

<p>Being firmly convinced that these men intended to pursue a
plan of operations which would entail great misery both upon
themselves and the others, I considered that I ought undoubtedly
to endeavour to save them from the danger which I foresaw
impending over them; and this could only be accomplished by my
making forced marches to Perth and sending out supplies to meet
them before they were reduced to the last extremities. Had I
foreseen a week ago that I should be compelled eventually to
adopt such a step I would then have taken with me all such as
were willing to march and have left the others; but this time had
passed. My movement to Perth must now be accomplished with the
greatest expedition or it would be useless; and to take anyone
with me who was so much reduced as to have delayed, impeded, or
perhaps altogether to have arrested our progress, would have
sacrificed the lives of all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3. FROM WATER PEAK TO GAIRDNER'S RANGE.</h2>

<p>RETURN TO THE PARTY.</p>

<p>April 10.</p>

<p>The morning's dawn found us in the vicinity of our comrades,
and, just as the thick grey mists began heavily to ascend from
the low plains on which I had left the party, we emerged from the
bush upon the native path down which we had travelled the
preceding evening; here I turned northward, and a few minutes
more placed the party in our view. Some of them were missing. I
felt alarmed lest a new misfortune had happened and, hurrying on,
eagerly asked where they were. The answer given will describe
more truly their position than the most minute detail could do;
it was: "They are just gone into the bush to suck grass, Sir."
This semblance of extreme thirst must however, I suspect, have
been in some measure a piece of affectation upon their parts, for
upon the morning of the day before they had had a plentiful
supply of water: whether however their extreme sufferings were
true or feigned mattered not, we fully supplied their wants; and
then I immediately ordered preparations to be made for our
further progress.</p>

<p>We moved on in the direction of the spring of water which lay
about half a mile to the eastward of our true line of route. Our
movements were soon again delayed by Woods, who began as usual to
lie down and declare his inability to proceed any further.</p>

<p>DELAYS CAUSED BY USELESS BAGGAGE. DESTRUCTION OF USELESS
BAGGAGE.</p>

<p>I desired him to leave behind the heavy load he was carrying;
but as upon former occasions he again declared his determination
to die rather than part with this mysterious bundle, which
appeared to possess an extraordinary value in his estimation. It
was easy to see from his appearance that he was now really ill
and unable to carry such a weight as he was striving to do. At
length he again laid himself down, declaring that he was dying,
and, as I determined no longer to see his life endangered by his
so obstinately insisting on carrying this bundle, I took it up,
and, informing him of my intention to pay him the full value of
any property of his that I might destroy, I proceeded to open it
with the intention of throwing all useless articles away.</p>

<p>Upon this announcement of mine he burst into tears, deplored
alternately his dying state and the loss of the bundle, and then
poured forth a torrent of invectives against me, in the midst of
which I quietly went on unfolding the treasured parcel and
exposing to view the following articles: Three yards of thick
heavy canvas; some duck which he had purloined; a large roll of
sewing thread, ditto; a thick pea jacket which I had abandoned at
the boats, and had, at his request, given to him; and various
other old pieces of canvas and duck; also a great part of the
cordage of one of the boats, which he had taken without
permission.</p>

<p>When these various articles were produced it was difficult to
tell which was the prevailing sentiment in the minds of some of
the party--mirth at thus seeing the contents of the mysterious
bundle exposed, or indignation that a man should have been so
foolish as to endanger his own life and delay our movements for
the sake of such a collection of trash. A pair of shoes and one
or two useful articles were retained, the remainder were thrown
away, and in a few minutes we were again under weigh for the
spring of water.</p>

<p>HALT AT WATER PEAK.</p>

<p>Another hour's march brought us to the spring; and those who
with me had been marching through a great part of the night
gladly laid down to rest; but I soon roused myself again, being
urged by the pangs of hunger. Fortunately I had shot a crow in
the morning, and now, gathering a few wild greens that grew about
the water, I cooked a breakfast for myself and the native without
being obliged to draw upon my little store of flour. This frugal
repast having been washed down by a few mouthfuls of water, I
resumed my meditations of the previous night.</p>

<p>CRITICAL SITUATION.</p>

<p>The following appeared to be our true position. We were about
one hundred and ninety miles from Perth, in a direct line
measured through the air. None of the party had more than six or
seven pounds of flour left; whilst I had myself but one pound and
a half, and half a pound of arrowroot; the native had nothing
left and was wholly dependant on me for his subsistence. Now we
had been seven days on our route, and had made but little more
than seventy miles, and as the men were much weaker than when
they first started it appeared to me to be extremely
problematical whether we should ever reach Perth unless some plan
different from what we had hitherto pursued was adopted. And even
granting that we did eventually make this point, it was evident
that we must previously be subjected to wants and necessities of
the most cruel and distressing nature.</p>

<p>NEW PLAN OF PROCEEDING.</p>

<p>Yet it was quite manifest from recent events that the majority
of the party had not only made up their minds not to accelerate
their movements, but had fully resolved to compel me to pursue
their system of short marches and long halts. Being fully aware
of the danger which threatened them, it remained for me to act
with that decision which circumstances appeared to require, and
to proceed by rapid and forced marches to Perth, whence
assistance could be sent out to the remainder. For this purpose
it was necessary that all those who accompanied me should be good
walkers and resolute men; for if any accident happened to the
portion of the party I took with me, arising either from want of
energy, want of discipline, or any other causes, that portion of
the party which remained behind would have been reduced to the
last extremity.</p>

<p>DIVIDE THE PARTY, AND PROCEED WITH THE STRONGEST TO PERTH FOR
ASSISTANCE. ARRANGEMENTS AT STARTING.</p>

<p>Having formed this resolution, it became necessary to make a
selection of those who were to accompany me. In determining
however upon this point I had but little difficulty; for it was
evident that those men who during our late toils had shown
themselves the most capable of enduring hardships, privations,
and the fatigue of long and rapid marches, were those who were
the best suited for the service I now destined them for. The
following was the division I made of the party: I named:</p>

<p>Corporal Auger, Corporal Coles, H. Woods, W. Hackney, Kaiber,
the native,</p>

<p>as those who were to accompany me, and left the remainder
under the command of Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>EMBARRASSMENT REGARDING THE CHART.</p>

<p>In making my arrangements with Mr. Walker a very serious
difficulty arose upon his part, and one from which I immediately
augured the worst of consequences. On quitting the boats I
brought away with me Captain King's chart of the coast between
North-west Cape and Cape Leeuwin, and had hitherto carried it
along with my papers and sketches. I wished Mr. Walker to take
this chart with him for the purpose of recognising his position
by means of the islands and headlands as he advanced along the
coast. No inducements upon my part could however persuade him to
take charge of it. It was in vain that I urged on him the well
known fact that nothing encourages men in a long journey so much
as knowing the exact distance they have travelled and what extent
of country they have still left to traverse. It was in vain that
I assured him he would, from his inexperience in calculating
distances in the bush, soon get confused in his reckoning; and
that the men, finding out his error, would lose all trust and
confidence in him, whence would spring want of discipline and
disorders of various kinds; he knew that I much valued this chart
and had apparently taken it into his head that I wished to
disencumber myself of it and to entail the duty of carrying it on
him.</p>

<p>He at length proposed to me to allow him to cut the chart up,
in which case he said he would carry on the part he wanted and
leave the rest. I would not however part with so valuable a
document, for it contained my route up to that point, and the
public utility of the expedition mainly depended on the
preservation of it. He next requested me to make a copy of it for
him; this I assured him under existing circumstances it was
utterly impossible for me to do with sufficient accuracy to
answer the intended purpose, and I therefore would not attempt
it. He then applied to Mr. Smith, who coincided in my opinion;
but ever willing to oblige he made as accurate a copy as he
could, which I in vain represented to Mr. Walker he would find
utterly useless. His unreasonable reluctance however I could not
overcome.</p>

<p>POINT OF RENDEZVOUS FIXED.</p>

<p>The next matter to arrange was what place should be fixed on
as the point of rendezvous to which assistance was to be sent to
those who were left to follow with Mr. Walker. This was soon
arranged. Mr. Smith had previously been with me to a place called
Goonmarrarup, on the Moore River about fifty-five miles to the
north of Perth; and it was agreed that the party should proceed
along the coast as they best could until they made the Moore
River, where I would have another party stationed with provisions
to meet them; and in order that they might not pass this river it
was settled that the party who went out to meet them should
separate into two, one of which would remain at this point on the
Moore River, about twelve miles from the sea, whilst the other
was to proceed down to it, leaving, besides their tracks, marks
to show where they had passed; and then, in the event of not
finding those they were in search of, this last detachment was to
push still further northward to look for them.</p>

<p>As soon as the arrangements were concluded I assembled the men
and publicly repeated these directions to them; and to such as
Clotworthy I addressed strong admonitions as to their future
conduct. Many of them did not appear to be in the least aware of
the critical situation they were placed in; I however entertained
great fears for the safety of some of them. Poor Smith was at
this time in a very delicate state of health, and his courage and
gentleness had so endeared him to me that the sight of his sickly
face made me long to be on the march to send out help to him. For
Mr. Walker I had no fear; I have never known anyone endowed with
a greater degree of patient endurance; indeed had he not, from a
mistaken good nature, been too familiar with the men, no one
could have been more admirably adapted for the trying position in
which he was placed; and even as events turned out I doubt if
anyone could have been found who would have endured more, or
would have gone through greater exertions to save those under his
command.</p>

<p>The party I left, and who were not required to proceed by
forced marches, consisted of:</p>

<p>Mr. Walker,<br>
Mr. Smith,<br>
Thomas Ruston,<br>
C. Woods,<br>
T. Stiles,<br>
A. Clotworthy.</p>

<p>SEPARATION OF THE PARTY. ADVICE TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND.</p>

<p>Before parting with Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith I again urged
them to push steadily onwards and never to idle for an instant;
but I do not think that either of them were fully aware of the
dangers they had to contend with. Poor Smith, as he squeezed my
hand, begged me to send out a horse for him, if one could be
procured, and also some tobacco; he said the only thing he
dreaded was want of water.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker smiled and told me to look out for myself that he
was not in Perth before me, and several others seemed to
participate in his feeling and to regard my plan of proceeding as
the height of folly.</p>

<p>I left with Mr. Walker's party everything that was really
useful, such as the cooking saucepan and the only hatchet we had.
These were very valuable to them, for had they come into a
grass-tree country they might have subsisted for a long time upon
the tops of these trees, as Mr. Elliott did upon a former
occasion; for he together with two men lived upon them for
fourteen days. This very useful implement they however threw away
the second day after we parted. We also left them all the
fishing-hooks.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker's party instantly commenced on the system of
halting, and instead of moving on in the afternoon remained where
they were that day for the purpose of resting themselves.</p>

<p>The country we travelled over for the first two miles was
pretty good, being a series of grassy plains. At this point we
came to a belt of thick wood which we found exceedingly difficult
to traverse. We then continued our south by east course for four
miles further over undulating sandy downs, and halted for the
night in a small clump of Banksia trees which afforded plenty of
wood for our fires.</p>

<p>April 11.</p>

<p>About an hour before daylight I roused the party, and as soon
as it was light enough to distinguish the surrounding objects we
started. Our route lay along a series of undulating sandy hills
which sloped down to a fertile plain, four or five miles in
width, on the western side of which rose a low range of dunes,
and beyond these was the sea. We found the walking along these
hills very difficult on account of the prickly scrub with which
they were covered, and the general appearance of the country to
the eastward was barren and unpromising.</p>

<p>COURSE IMPEDED BY A THICK WOOD.</p>

<p>The course I pursued was about south by east, but we soon
found ourselves embarrassed in thick woods through which it was
almost impossible to force a way: the trees were not large but so
matted together that it required my utmost exertions to prevail
upon the men to persist in pushing through them, indeed it will
afterwards be found that these woods had a most disastrous effect
upon the spirits of that portion of the party which followed me.
It was however absolutely necessary to make our way through one
of these which formed a belt of nearly a mile in width, running
almost east and west as far as the eye could see in each
direction.</p>

<p>I therefore gave a bold plunge into the bushes, followed by
the native and slowly by the other men, who kept alternately
groaning from fatigue and pain and uttering imprecations against
the country they were in. Having cleared this wood I turned
rather more inland, and we pursued our route over barren scrubby
plains, and, after having travelled about fifteen miles over this
uninteresting description of country, we suddenly found ourselves
on the top of a low range which overlooked a most luxuriant
valley of about three miles in width, its general direction
appearing to be from the east-south-east.</p>

<p>THE ARROWSMITH RIVER.</p>

<p>I immediately knew from the appearance of the country that we
were near some large river; and whilst descending into the valley
I indulged in speculations as to the size of that we were about
to discover, and as to whether Providence would grant me once
again to drink a draught of cool river water.</p>

<p>I soon however began to fear that my expectations were to be
disappointed. We had already proceeded more than two miles of the
distance across the valley; and although the soil was rich and
good we had yet seen nothing but dry watercourses, inconsiderable
in themselves yet apparently when united forming a large river. I
still however entertained hopes of finding water, for I saw
numerous tracks of natives about, and the whole of this valley
was an extensive warran ground in which they had that very
morning been digging for their favourite root.</p>

<p>At length, just as my patience began to wear out, we ascended,
out of a dry watercourse, a rise rather more elevated than the
others we had met with in crossing the valley; and from the
summit of this a curious sight met our view: beneath us lay the
dry bed of a large river, its depth at this point being between
forty and fifty feet, and its breadth upwards of three hundred
yards; it was at times subject to terrific inundations; for along
its banks lay the trunks of immense trees, giants of the forest
which had been washed down from the interior in the season of the
floods; yet nothing now met our craving eyes but a vast sandy
channel which scorched our eyeballs as the rays of the sun were
reflected back from its white glistening bed.</p>

<p>WATER FOUND IN IT BY DIGGING.</p>

<p>I picked out the most shady spot I could for the men to halt
at, then descended into the bed of the river to search, with the
native, for water; and immediately on scraping a hole a few
inches deep in the bed of the river the water came streaming into
it, for the sand composing the bottom of the watercourse was
completely saturated, and I afterwards found that there were
large pools of it immediately above and below where we were.</p>

<p>The wants of the men having been thus supplied I determined,
as it was intensely hot, to halt for an hour or two; we each of
us therefore ate a little doughboy, or piece of damper, and the
men then lay down to rest. As I sat musing alone the first
thought that struck me was how providentially it happened that we
had not fallen in with this river in the season of the floods, as
our crossing it then would have been utterly impossible.</p>

<p>APPROACH OF NATIVES TO THE RIVER.</p>

<p>But my reveries were soon disturbed by hearing the call of a
native from the opposite bank, and I roused up poor Kaiber from
his sleep that he might ascertain what was going on upon the
other side. His quick eyes soon detected natives moving about
amongst the bushes; but on farther examination he ascertained
that there was only one man, who walked as if he had been
wounded, the rest of the party being made up of women and
children, who were digging for roots. They were quite unconscious
of our presence, and we lay snugly behind a bush, watching all
their movements. As soon as they had dug a sufficient quantity of
roots for their purpose they descended to the bed of the river
and walked up to a pool about one hundred yards above our
position, where they all drank and then sat down to cook their
roots. I ordered the men to keep themselves as quiet as possible
so that we in no way disturbed these poor creatures; and when at
length the party moved off we passed them in a diagonal direction
so as to give them an opportunity of seeing us without
frightening them. When first we emerged into view they began to
run away; but when they saw that we still moved steadily on
without noticing them they were no longer alarmed, but stood
still, gazing at us with the greatest wonder and amazement; the
youngest children standing behind their mothers, peeping
cautiously out at us; and many a strange thought must have passed
through the breasts of these natives as they saw us wind in
regular order up the opposite hill. This tribe was the most
northern one that I had seen wear the kangaroo-skin cloak.</p>

<p>Another mile and a half in a south by east direction brought
us to a low range to the south of this river, which I named the
Arrowsmith River after Mr. John Arrowsmith, the distinguished
geographer. From this range we had a fine view of the rich
valleys drained by this important stream.</p>

<p>MOUNT HORNER.</p>

<p>These valleys ran nearly north and south between the interior
range and the sandy limestone range parallel to the coast on
which we now were; but the river must also, of course, from its
magnitude, penetrate the interior range, which was only distant
about sixteen miles from us. A very remarkable peak in the
latter, which bore east-north-east from this point, I named Mount
Horner, after my friend Leonard Horner, Esquire.</p>

<p>It appears from the report of the party who came along the
coast that this river loses itself in a large lake, between which
and the sea a great bar of dry sand intervenes in the dry season;
there is however a very fair proportion of good country in the
neighbourhood of the Arrowsmith.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening we travelled six and a half miles
further in a south-south-east direction, over barren, sandy,
scrubby plains, which extended on all sides as far as the eye
could see, and even the interior range appeared to be perfectly
bare. Towards nightfall we were all quite worn out from the
difficulty we had experienced in walking through the prickly
scrub, yet I could see no place that afforded sufficient wood to
enable us to make a fire and, as most of us had no covering with
us, and the nights were intensely cold, we had every prospect of
passing a most wretched one; but at length I spied two clumps of
Banksia trees, the nearest of which we just reached as it became
quite dark. The other clump was about a quarter of a mile to the
eastward of us, at which I soon distinguished native fires; as
the men were however much exhausted I thought it better not to
mention this circumstance to them, and Kaiber and myself, who
always slept at a little fire alone, kept a good look out during
the night.</p>

<p>This evening we found the Bohn or Boh-rne, a native esculent
root, and it is the most northern point at which I have met with
it.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. A small red root somewhat resembling in
flavour a mild onion.)</blockquote>

<p>April 12.</p>

<p>Before dawn this morning our native neighbours, who doubtless
were not pleased at our sleeping so near them, began to cooee to
each other, which is their usual signal for collecting their
forces; and, as our safety depended upon none of the party being
incapacitated by a wound or other cause from proceeding with the
utmost rapidity, I at once roused the men and we resumed our
way.</p>

<p>CONTINUE OUR ROUTE.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we made a march of twenty-five miles
in a south-south-east direction, the whole of this distance being
across elevated undulating sandy plains, covered with a thick
prickly scrub, about two and a half feet high; these plains were
however occasionally studded with a few Banksia trees, but
anything more dark, cheerless, and barren than their general
appearance can scarcely be conceived.</p>

<p>About half an hour before sunset we came to the bed of a dry
watercourse, the direction of which was from south-east to north,
so that it was probably a tributary of the Arrowsmith. We were
fortunate enough to find a small pool of water in it, yet the
large flights of birds of every description that came here for
the purpose of drinking showed the rarity of water in these
parts. We made several attempts to get a shot at them but they
were so wild, and we were so worn out and weak, that all our
exertions were unsuccessful. In the course of the evening one of
the men made up my last pound of flour into a damper for me, and
I supped on a spoonful of arrowroot.</p>

<p>SERIOUS ROBBBRY BY A RAT.</p>

<p>April 13.</p>

<p>On waking up this morning I found that in the night a rat had
gnawed a hole in the canvas bag in which my little damper was
placed, and had eaten more than half of it; this was a very
serious misfortune as all my provisions were now reduced to three
table-spoonfuls of arrowroot and the morsel of damper left me by
the rat. As I had shared my provisions with the native my
situation was far worse than that of any of the others, and he,
poor fellow, had become so dispirited and weak that he was
incapable of searching for his food. Indeed the productions of
the country through which he had hitherto passed were so
different from those of the one in which he had lived that the
various kinds of roots and vegetables were, with one or two
exceptions, quite unknown to him.</p>

<p>We made a very good march of it this morning, having travelled
nineteen miles in a nearly south direction before 12 o'clock.
Soon after starting we sighted Mount Perron, distant about two
and twenty miles and, seen over the waste and barren plains which
surrounded us, it was a very remarkable object.</p>

<p>We halted at noon for about two hours, during which time I
made my breakfast with Kaiber, sharing my remaining portion of
damper between us. It was almost a satisfaction to me when it was
gone, for, tormented by the pangs of hunger, as I had now been
for many days, I found that nearly the whole of my time was
passed in struggling with myself as to whether I should eat at
once all the provisions I had left or refrain till a future hour.
Having completed this last morsel I occupied myself for a little
with my journal, then read a few chapters in the New Testament
and, having fulfilled these duties, I felt myself as contented
and cheerful as I had ever been in the most fortunate moments of
my life.</p>

<p>GAIRDNER'S RANGE.</p>

<p>Soon after two P.M. we resumed our journey, travelling for
about eight miles in a due south direction over plains similar to
those we had passed yesterday and this morning, and then began to
ascend a red sandstone range of the same description as the Perth
ironstone and thinly studded with black bay trees. I named this
range Gairdner's Range after my friend Gordon Gairdner, Esquire,
of the Colonial Office and, after continuing a gradual ascent for
about four miles, I found that we were in the neighbourhood of a
forest, at the outskirts of which I chose a spot for our
halting-place, which afforded plenty of firewood but was
deficient in water. As we had now however marched thirty-one
miles without seeing water, and were all perfectly worn out, I
judged it more prudent to halt where we were.</p>

<p>FIND SOME EDIBLE ZAMIA NUTS.</p>

<p>Kaiber here brought in some of the nuts of the Zamia tree;
they were dry and therefore in a fit state to eat. I accordingly
shared them amongst the party. Several of the men then straggled
off to look for more, and were imprudent enough, before I found
out what they were doing, to eat several of the nuts which were
not sufficiently dried, the consequences of which were that they
were seized with violent fits of vomiting accompanied by vertigo
and other distressing symptoms; these however gradually abated
during the night, and in the morning, although rendered more weak
than they were before, the poor fellows were still able to resume
their march.</p>

<p>GENEROUS CONDUCT OF ONE OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>Soon after the fires had been lighted I was sitting alone by
mine, as the shadows of night were just falling over the wild
hilly scenery with which we were surrounded; I had no water to
cook a portion of the three spoonfuls of arrowroot yet left me,
and I saw each of the others preparing his scanty portion of
food. The native had at this time gone away to look for Zamia
nuts, and it may be imagined that many almost undefined feelings
at such a time thronged rapidly through my mind. Whilst thus
thinking I heard Hackney propose to Woods to offer me a share of
their little store of food: "No," said Woods; "everyone for
himself under these circumstances; let Mr. Grey do as well as he
can and I will do the same." "Well then I shall give him some of
mine at all events," said Hackney; and a few minutes afterwards
he came up to my fire and pressed me to accept a morsel of damper
about the size of a walnut. I hesitated at first whether to do so
or not, but, being aware that when we came into a country where
game was to be found I could, by means of my gun, provide enough
amply to repay this lad, I took it, after several refusals and
having it as often warmly pressed upon me.</p>

<p>I was much affected by the kindness of Hackney, who was a
young American; and I regret to add that I felt more hurt than I
ought to have done at the remark of Woods.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4. FROM GAIRDNER'S RANGE TO PERTH.</h2>

<p>THE HILL RIVER.</p>

<p>Sunday April 14.</p>

<p>We travelled about fourteen miles due south over a range of
high ironstone hills which were occasionally clothed with
grass-trees. The scrub was however still thick, prickly, and very
difficult to penetrate; the heat was intense and the whole party
were getting very weak. About noon, and when we had just gained a
commanding summit, I looked back at Mount Perron, now several
miles in our rear; from this point we began to descend into an
extensive valley, and at the end of fourteen miles reached a
small river which I named the Hill.</p>

<p>DISCOVERY AND PILLAGE OF A NATIVE PROVISION STORE.</p>

<p>We halted at the first pool we came to and the men, who had a
little flour left, boiled two tablespoonfuls of this in about a
pint and a half of water, thus making what they called soup. In
the meantime Kaiber came in and told me that he had found some
holes in which the natives had, according to their custom, buried
a store of By-yu nuts,* and he at the same time requested
permission to steal them.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The nut of the Zamia tree.)</blockquote>

<p>I reflected for some time on his proposal; I was reluctant to
mark the first approach of civilized man to this country of a
savage race by an unprovoked act of pillage and robbery; yet we
were now in the desert, on the point of perishing for want of
food, the pangs of hunger gnawing us even in our very sleep, and
with the means of temporary relief at hand. I asked myself if I
should be acting justly or humanely by the others, whose lives
were at stake if I allowed them to pass by the store, which
seemed providentially offered to us, without pointing it out.</p>

<p>In my perplexity I turned to Kaiber: his answer was, "If we
take all, this people will be angered greatly; they will say,
'What thief has stolen here: track his footsteps, spear him
through the heart; wherefore has he stolen our hidden food?' But
if we take what is buried in one hole they will say, 'Hungry
people have been here; they were very empty, and now their
bellies are full; they may be sorcerers; now they will not eat us
as we sleep.'" Good, it is good, Kaiber," I replied; "come with
me and we will rob one hole." And accordingly we went and took
the contents of one, leaving three others undisturbed. I brought
back these nuts to the men and we shared them amongst us.</p>

<p>We were so weary that we did not start until late in the
afternoon, and then travelled south by east down the course of
the river, making about six miles. It was joined by many small
tributaries and now became a running stream flowing through a
deep grassy valley in which were many large flats. In the course
of the afternoon some of the men had a shot at a native dog; he
was a fine fat fellow; but they were unsuccessful and never did I
feel more disappointed than when I saw him cantering away
desperately frightened but perfectly uninjured. I was
sufficiently fortunate to shoot a hawk just before nightfall, and
we then halted by the side of the river, lighted our fires, and
laid down to sleep.</p>

<p>April 15.</p>

<p>In the course of the night I had cooked the hawk which I shot
yesterday and before starting divided it as follows: I gave the
head, entrails, and shanks to the native; then cutting the
residue in half I gave one part to Hackney, who had so generously
shared his morsel of damper with me, and kept the remaining
portion for myself. Poor Hackney's wan and wasted countenance
glowed with pleasure when this acceptable gift was placed in his
hands, and I felt no slight degree of satisfaction in having an
opportunity of showing him that I felt grateful for his act of
generosity to me.</p>

<p>We now followed the course of the river for about two miles
further and saw a considerable quantity of good land along its
banks, clothed with feed for stock; but I cannot tell how far
back this extends.</p>

<p>The river now ran away nearly due west under a low range of
hills; and still adhering to my original plan I quitted its banks
and continued my course straight for Perth, travelling in a south
by east direction. The next two and a half miles led us to the
top of a low range. The whole tract of country between this point
and the river was arid and barren in the extreme, being devoid of
all vegetation but a stunted prickly scrub, and on it we saw no
signs either of animal life or water. We here for the first time
since quitting Moresby's Flat-topped Range saw that the one to
the east of us became well wooded, the interval between these two
points having been completely bare of trees.</p>

<p>BARREN COUNTRY.</p>

<p>I now halted for about an hour and a half to rest the wearied
men, and then again commenced our route over this barren waste.
For the next twelve miles we travelled down a gentle descent
leading to a very deep valley, and late in the evening reached
some dried up swamps where we made an ineffectual search for
water; we however saw here some parakeets, and I was lucky enough
to kill one which was about the size of a thrush; several of the
men also got shots at these little birds, but without success. As
the day had been intensely hot and we had tasted no water since
morning we suffered a great deal from want of it, but were at
length compelled by darkness to lie down to rest without finding
any.</p>

<p>DRY BED OF THE SMITH RIVER.</p>

<p>April 16.</p>

<p>We had not travelled above two miles this morning in an
east-south-east direction when I found that we had reached the
bottom of the valley into which we had yesterday evening
commenced our descent. In this valley lay the dried up bed of a
considerable stream, which I have named the Smith after my
unfortunate friend. Its direction was from north-east to
south.</p>

<p>LONG AND UTTER DESTITUTION OF FOOD AND WATER. SUFFERINGS FROM
THIRST.</p>

<p>As we were now suffering a good deal from thirst we made a
search in both directions along the bed, but although there were
many pools (some of them being twelve or fourteen feet deep) we
could not find the slightest indication of water having stood in
them for a considerable time: in the bottom of one of the deepest
of these pools was a native well, dug to the depth of about seven
feet, but even at this distance below the surface we could see no
signs whatever of water. There was much good land in the valley
through which this watercourse wound, but all was barren and
arid. In the course of the morning we had seen a flight of
cockatoos coming from the eastward down the valley in which the
bed of the river lay, which at the time made me imagine that
water would be found in that direction in the interior, and the
natives subsequently stated that such was the case, but our
circumstances would not admit such a deviation from our course in
a search which if unsuccessful would have proved fatal.</p>

<p>DISTRESSING SEARCH FOR WATER.</p>

<p>The sun had by this time become intensely hot, and the poor
fellows grew faint for want of water, whilst it aggravated their
sufferings that they stood upon the brink of a river, or wandered
along its banks with eager piercing eyes, and an air of intense
scrutinizing watchfulness peculiar to those who search for that
on which their lives depend. One while they explored a shallow
stony part of the bed, which was parched up and blackened by the
fiery sun; their steps were slow and listless, and I could
plainly see how faint, weak, and weary they were; the next minute
another pool would be discerned ahead, the depth of which the eye
could not at a distance reach; now they hurried on towards it
with a dreadful look of eager anxiety, the pool was reached, the
bottom seen, but, alas! no water; then they paused and looked one
at the other with an air of utter despair. As long as they
remained on the banks of this river bed a glimmering of hope
remained; but I felt convinced from the general appearance of the
country that there was not the slightest probability of our
finding water there, and resolved therefore still to continue a
direct route. When I gave this order the weak-minded quailed
before it: they would rather have perished in wandering up and
down those arid and inhospitable banks than have made a great
effort and have torn themselves away from the vain and delusive
hopes this watercourse held out to them.</p>

<p>With great pain I witnessed and bore my part in this
distressing scene, but I at the moment felt that it would be
necessary to save my energies for other occasions; suspecting
that we were in a great tract of desert country, a large portion
of which must still be passed ere we could hope for any
alleviation from our sufferings; and I therefore at once
commenced carrying into execution the order I had given, by
walking on in a south by east direction. In about two miles we
had gained the summit of the low range which bounded to the
southward the valley where we had so vainly searched for water,
and for the next ten miles we travelled over elevated sandy
barren plains, thinly wooded with occasional clumps of Banksia
trees.</p>

<p>DRY TEA-TREE SWAMP.</p>

<p>On our left was a lofty and well wooded range, distant only
about four miles, and on our right lay extensive plains, the
western extremity of which, distant about sixteen miles from us,
was by the sea; these plains appeared tolerably fertile, being
covered with tea-tree swamps, now apparently dried up. I still
was led on by the hope, raised by the height of the range on our
left, that we might find water issuing from it towards the coast,
and had therefore not searched the plains which lay between us
and the sea, indeed I felt fully convinced that the swamps we saw
were all perfectly dry and the native coincided in my opinion;
about an hour before sunset however we descended towards the
plains, and turning due west we reached them in about half an
hour, but found all the swamps quite destitute of water. As soon
as it became dark I lit my fire and laid down by it, advising the
others to pursue the same course and to preserve their energies
for the morrow. But such advice was thrown away upon men almost
perishing with thirst, and every now and then throughout the
night I heard their weak husky voices as they wandered from swamp
to swamp in the neighbourhood, digging holes with pointed sticks
in a vain search.</p>

<p>NATIVE SONGS.</p>

<p>Poor Kaiber alone lay crouching by my fire, occasionally
feeding it with fresh fuel and chanting to himself these two
songs, in his own language:</p>

<p>Thither, mother oh, I return again,<br>
Thither oh, I return again.</p>

<p>The other had been sung by the mother of Miago, a native who
had accompanied Captain Wickham in the Beagle from the Swan
River, and it had made a great impression on the natives.</p>

<p>Whither does that lone ship wander,<br>
My young son I shall never see again.<br>
Whither does that lone ship wander.</p>

<p>EXTREME FEEBLENESS OF THE PARTY.</p>

<p>The night wore heavily on; sleepless sufferers were around me,
and I myself began to feel very anxious as to what the next day
might bring. The men had now been already one night and two days
without tasting a single drop of water or food of any kind
whatever, for as the only provisions they had left was a spoonful
or two of flour each it was impossible for them to cook this
without water; indeed only two of them had even this small supply
of flour left, and the rest were wholly destitute.</p>

<p>I personally suffered far less than any of the others with the
exception of the native, and this for several reasons. In the
first place I had been long accustomed to subsist on a very small
quantity of water, and secondly I had always kept my mind
occupied and amused instead of giving way to desponding or gloomy
thoughts. When we halted and the others laid wearily down,
brooding over their melancholy situation, I employed myself in
writing up my journal, which was most scrupulously kept; and this
duty being concluded I had recourse to a small New Testament, my
companion throughout all my wanderings, and from this latter I
drank in such deep draughts of comfort that my spirits were
always good.</p>

<p>DANGER OF PERISHING FOR WANT OF WATER.</p>

<p>April 17.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half before dawn we started in a south by
east direction, the native leading the way, for it was yet too
dark for me to select points to march upon. As we moved along we
moistened our mouths by sucking a few drops of dew from the
shrubs and reeds, but even this miserable resource failed us
almost immediately after sunrise. The men were so worn out from
fatigue and want of food and water that I could get them but a
few hundred yards at a time, then some one of them would sit down
and beg me so earnestly to stop for a few minutes that I could
not refuse acceding to the request; when however I thus halted
the native in every instance expressed his indignation, telling
me that it was sacrificing his safety as well as those of the
others who were able to move, for that if we did not find water
ere night the whole party would die. He was indeed as weak from
want of food as any of us, for we had made such rapid and lengthy
marches in the hope of speedily forwarding assistance to those
left behind that when we came at night to the conclusion of our
day's journey Kaiber was too much exhausted to think of looking
for food.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon the men were so completely
exhausted that it was impossible to induce them to move, and at
this period I found that we had only made about eight miles in a
south by east direction, over plains studded with small sandy
hills and the beds of dried up tea-tree swamps.</p>

<p>When I halted the sun was intensely powerful; the groans and
exclamations of some of the men were painful in the extreme; but
my feelings were still more agonized when I saw the poor
creatures driven, by the want of water, to drink their own ----,
the last sad and revolting resource of thirst!</p>

<p>UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR WATER WITH KAIBER.</p>

<p>Unable to bear these distressing scenes any longer I ordered
Kaiber to accompany me, and notwithstanding the heat and my own
weariness I left the others lying down in such slight shade as
the stunted banksias afforded, and throwing aside all my
ammunition, papers, etc., started with him in search of water,
carrying nothing but my double-barrelled gun. We proceeded
towards the sea. As the natives have the faculty, even in the
trackless woods which they have never before been in, of
returning direct to any spot they have left by however circuitous
a course they may have travelled after quitting it, I paid no
attention to the direction we were moving in but followed Kaiber,
who roamed from spot to spot in the vain search of water; but we
found not a drop. The same arid barren country seemed spread on
every side; and when at length I began occasionally to stumble
and fall from weakness hope abandoned me, and I determined to
return direct to my comrades and get them to make one more effort
to proceed and search for it in a southerly direction.</p>

<p>TREACHEROUS INTENTIONS OF KAIBER, THE NATIVE.</p>

<p>I therefore told Kaiber that such was my intention, and
directed him to guide me to the party. With apparent alacrity he
obeyed my orders; but after leading me about some time in an
extraordinary manner he told me that he had lost his way and
could not find them. His look was so very plausible when he said
this, and he seemed so grieved at the circumstance, that for a
moment I believed his tale; but I felt convinced that we could
not be at any very great distance from them and therefore fired
one barrel of my gun; the echo of this sound, never heard in
these solitudes before, rang loudly through the woods, remoter
distances caught it up, and at length it gradually died away:
anxiously did I now listen for a repetition of the report, for I
knew, were they within hearing, the men would instantly fire
again to acknowledge the signal I had made; but minute after
minute passed on and no answering signal struck my ear. I sat
down and applied my ear to the ground; every sense became
absorbed in the single one of hearing, but not the remotest sound
that I could distinguish broke the frightful solitude of these
vast woods. I remained seated on the ground for a few minutes,
still hearing no answer to my shot, till the conviction gradually
forced itself on my mind that the native had been leading me
astray. Only two cases could have occurred: either he had done so
purposely, for he could not, by any accidental mistake, have
taken me to such a distance as to prevent the party in these
silent woods hearing the report of my gun, or otherwise the men
had of themselves moved away from the place where I had left
them. But I felt assured that this latter supposition was not
correct, for ever since I quitted the other portion of the party
I had maintained so strict a discipline that no man ever
separated from the rest without my permission; indeed I had
increased my strictness in these respects exactly in proportion
to our increasing difficulties; and I moreover felt sure that
some of the men were by far too much attached to me ever to
abandon me in such a manner.</p>

<p>My situation however was undoubtedly very critical, not as far
as regarded my own safety, for I was not now more than eighty
miles from the nearest settler's hut; but was it possible for me
to return alone to my countrymen and to say that I had lost all
my comrades? that I had saved myself and left the others to
perish? Yet I knew that unless I sent assistance to the first
party I had left the majority of them could not survive; and from
the state I had, about an hour and a half ago, left the others
in, it appeared more than probable that they might wait and wait
anxiously, expecting my return, until too weak to move, and thus
die miserably in the woods.</p>

<p>These thoughts thronged rapidly through my mind. Indeed I was
obliged to do all things quickly now for I felt that my existence
depended upon my finding water within the next three or four
hours. The native sat opposite to me on the ground, his keen
savage eye watching the expression of my countenance, as each
thought flitted across it. I saw that he was trying to read my
feelings; and he at length thus broke the silence:</p>

<p>"Mr. Grey, today we can walk and may yet not die but drink
water; tomorrow you and I will be two dead men, if we walk not
now, for we shall then be weak and unable. The others sit down
too much; they are weak and cannot walk: if we remain with them
we shall all die; but we two are still strong; let us walk. There
lies the sea; to that the streams run; it is long since we have
crossed a river: go quickly, and before the next sun gets up we
shall cross another running water." He paused for a minute,
looking steadfastly at me, and then added, "You must leave the
others, for I know not where they are, and we shall die in trying
to find them."</p>

<p>HIS DESIGNS FRUSTRATED.</p>

<p>I now knew that he was playing me false and that he had
purposely led me astray. He was too great a coward to move on
alone for fear of other natives and, dreading to lose his life by
thirst, he had hit upon this expedient of inducing me to abandon
the others and to proceed with him. "Do you see the sun, Kaiber,
and where it now stands?" I replied to him. "Yes," was his
answer. "Then if you have not led me to the party before that sun
falls behind the hills I will shoot you; as it begins to sink you
die." I said these words, looking at him steadily in the face,
and with the full intention of putting my threat into execution.
He saw this, and yet strove to appear unconcerned, and with a
forced laugh said, "You play. From daylight until now you and I
have walked; we have wasted our strength now in looking for water
for the others. But a short time, and we shall be dead; and you
say, search for men whom I cannot find; you tell me, look; and I
know not where to look." I now lost all patience with him and
replied: "Kaiber, deceive as you will, you cannot deceive me;
follow back our tracks instantly to the point from whence we
started: if you do not find them, as the sun falls you die." "I
am wearied," answered he; "for three days I have not either eaten
or drunk, far have we wandered since we left them, and very
distant from us are they now sitting." I could bear this no
longer, and, starting up, said, "You deceive: the sun falls! just
now I spoke: Koolyum, nganga dabbut--garrum wangaga." Again he
forced a laugh and said, "Surely, you play." I answered shortly,
"Did I ever tell you a lie, Kaiber? I now speak the truth."</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE PARTY WITHOUT WATER.</p>

<p>He seemed, when he saw that I was so determined, to feel a
little uncomfortable, and shifting his position moved rather
further from me; this motion on his part induced me to conceive
that he intended to run away; in which case I could never again
have hoped to rejoin the party; I therefore instantly cocked the
remaining barrel of my gun and presented it at him, telling him
that if he ever moved from me further than a certain tree which I
pointed out I would forthwith shoot him, instead of waiting until
sunset as I had originally intended. The decided manner in which
I announced this to my friend Kaiber had the desired effect. He
made a few protestations as to the folly of my conduct; lamented
most loudly that his mother, and the Dandalup (a river of his own
land) were so far removed from him; asserted vehemently that the
natives of these parts were bandy-legged, rough-tongued beings;
that they eat earth and drank no water; and, winding-up with a
fervent wish that he might catch one of them wandering anywhere
between Pinjarup and Mandurup, in which case he would spear his
heart, his kidney, and his liver, he sulkily resumed his route
and led me straight back to the party in about an hour.</p>

<p>DISTRESSING SYMPTOMS OF EXTREME THIRST.</p>

<p>The men, who had been much surprised at the length of my
absence, were at first buoyed up with the hope that I had found
water; but this hope had at last died away, and they knew not
what to conjecture. They were all reduced to the last degree of
weakness and want; indeed I myself was at this period suffering
from the most distressing symptoms of thirst; not only was my
mouth parched, burning, and devoid of moisture, but the senses of
sight and hearing became much affected; I could scarcely
recognise the voices of the rest; and when uncouth unnatural
tones struck upon my ear it took me some time to collect my
thoughts in order to understand what was said, somewhat in the
way in which one is obliged to act when roused suddenly from a
deep sleep. In the same manner my sight had become feeble and
indistinct; but by far the most distressing sensation was that
experienced upon rising up after having rested for a few moments.
I then felt the blood rush violently to the head, and the feeling
produced was as if it were driven by a forcing-pump through all
my veins.</p>

<p>LAST EFFORTS.</p>

<p>Previously to starting again I gave the men orders, which I
believed at the time would be, to some at least, the last. I did
not attempt to hide from them the dangers which surrounded us;
but stating these I represented that matters had now arrived at
such a crisis that, in the event of any of them being unable to
proceed, it would be wrong to expect the others to halt on their
account; and I therefore called upon all to exert their utmost
energies and boldly to make a last struggle for their lives. My
intention, I told them, was to proceed slowly but steadily to the
southward, and never once to halt until I dropped or reached
water; even in the event of any being unable to keep up I warned
them that I should not wait for them but still pursue a steady
and undeviating course until water was found; but as soon as I
had slaked my own thirst I would return and bring assistance to
those who might have been unable to come on with me.</p>

<p>PAINFUL MARCH.</p>

<p>Having thus imparted my intentions I ordered them to throw
away every superfluous article; and a very valuable sextant,
which had hitherto been carried turn about by Corporals Auger and
Coles, was here abandoned. These our preparations having been
made we moved slowly on in sad procession, and never shall I
forget the wild and haggard looks of those that followed me;
reason had begun to hold but a very slight influence over some,
and I feel assured that had it not been for the force of that
discipline which I rigidly maintained some of the party must now
have lost their lives. As it was, not a word of complaint was
heard as to the plan I pursued or the route I took; but they all
reeled and staggered after me, the silence being only broken by
groans and exclamations. I preserved a slow uniform pace,
proceeding still in a south by east direction, that is, in a
straight line for Perth. The same sandy sterile country was
around, thinly clothed with Banksia trees.</p>

<p>We had marched for about an hour and a quarter and in this
time had only made two miles, when we suddenly arrived upon the
edge of a dried-up bed of a sedgy swamp, which lay in the centre
of a small plain, where we saw the foot-mark of a native
imprinted on the sand, and again our hearts beat with hope, for
this sign appeared to announce that we were once more entering
the regions of animal life. We soon found that another part of
the swamp was thickly marked with the footsteps of women and
children; and as no water-baskets were scattered about no doubt
could exist but that we were in the vicinity of water. We soon
discovered several native wells dug in the bed of the swamp; but
these were all dry, and I began again to fear that I was
disappointed, when Kaiber suddenly started up from a thick bed of
reeds and made me a sign which was unobserved by the others, as
was evidently his intention.</p>

<p>FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF A MOIST MUD-HOLE. PROVIDENTIAL
SUPPLY.</p>

<p>I hurried up and found him with his head buried in a small
hole of moist mud, for I can call it nothing else. I very
deliberately raised Kaiber by the hair, as all expostulations to
him were useless, and then called up the others.</p>

<p>Kaiber had completely swelled himself out with this thick
muddy liquid, and from the mark upon the sides of the hole had
evidently consumed more than half of the total supply. I first of
all took some of this moist mud in my mouth, but finding a
difficulty in swallowing it, as it was so thick, I strained a
portion through a handkerchief. We had thirsted with an intense
and burning thirst for three days and two nights, during the
greater portion of which time we had been taking violent exercise
under a fierce sun. To conceive the delight of the men when they
arrived at this little hole of mud would be difficult. Each, as
he came up and cast his wearied limbs on the ground beside the
hole, uttered these words: "Thank God;" and then greedily
swallowed a few mouthfuls of the liquid mud, protesting that it
was the most delicious water and had a peculiar flavour which
rendered it far superior to any other he had ever tasted.</p>

<p>DANGER OF PERISHING FROM HUNGER.</p>

<p>But it required some time before their faculties were
sufficiently recovered to allow them duly to estimate the
magnitude of the danger they had escaped. The small portion of
muddy water in the hole was soon finished, and then by scraping
it out clean we found that water began slowly to trickle into it
again. The men now laid themselves down almost in a state of
stupefaction, and rested by their treasured pool. I felt however
that great calls upon my energies might still arise, and
therefore, retiring a little apart with the native, I first of
all returned hearty thanks to my Maker for the dangers and
sufferings he had thus brought me through, and then tottered on
with my gun in search of food. As might have been expected, game
was here plentiful: numerous pigeons and other birds came down at
nightfall (which was now the hour) for the purpose of drinking at
this lone pool, and the numbers of birds of different kinds that
congregated here was a most convincing proof of the general
aridity of this part of the country. Indeed the natives
subsequently reported that the tract we had just traversed was at
this season of the year totally devoid of water. It was in vain
now that I raised the gun, for my tremulous hand shook so that I
could not for a moment cover the bird I aimed at, and after one
or two ineffectual attempts to kill something I was obliged to
desist in despair.</p>

<p>PANGS OF HUNGER.</p>

<p>I now dreaded that I had only escaped the pains of death by
thirst in order to perish of hunger, and for a moment regretted
that I had not died ere I found water, for I firmly believed,
from the state of weakness I was then reduced to, that the
bitterness of death had passed. But a short period sufficed to
smother these unmanly and unchristian feelings in my breast, and,
seeing a flight of black cockatoos soaring about in the air, I
determined to watch them to their roosting-place, and then
favoured by the darkness of night to steal upon them. On my
return to the party I found the men sitting by the hole of water,
anxiously watching until they again saw a little black mud in it,
which they then eagerly swallowed.</p>

<p>I found some difficulty in inducing them to light their fire
and to choose a situation where they could repose for the night,
but, having accomplished this, I sat down by my own, hand-rubbing
my limbs until it should grow rather darker. At length I had the
pleasure of seeing that the black cockatoos, who found we were
not likely to leave them in possession of the water, had taken up
their position for the night in a large clump of trees distant
not more than half a mile, and I hereupon started with Kaiber to
try and get a shot at them.</p>

<p>SHOOT AND COOK A COCKATOO.</p>

<p>After about an hour's wandering and excitement such only as
the desperate gambler can know whose life depends upon the stake
for which he plays, I succeeded in getting a shot into a whole
flight of roosting and snoring black cockatoos, and one fell. I
pounced in triumph on it and received a bite which, famishing as
I was, somewhat damped my ardour; Kaiber however hit it upon the
head with a stick, and we then bore it off to our fire.</p>

<p>The men had cooked one spoonful of flour each in the liquid
mud which the pool afforded, and assured me that they found this
thick water very nourishing; whence I concluded that the large
portion of mud it contained in some degree gratified the cravings
of the stomach. Kaiber soon plucked the cockatoo and roasted it:
I gave him the entrails, the feet, and the first joint of the
legs, eating the head and thighs myself and reserving the other
portions as a store against future emergencies. I now felt
assured that my life was saved and, rendering thanks to God for
his many mercies, I laid down by the fire to watch for the first
appearance of dawn.</p>

<p>April 18.</p>

<p>The men slept but little during the night: every now and then
one of them visited the hole of mud and water to see if a little
of this fluid had drained into it, and about an hour before
daylight I roused them up to proceed upon their journey. They
were dreadfully feeble though upon the whole stronger than they
had been for the last three days. We now entered upon a more
hilly country than we had traversed yesterday; the hills were
steep, being composed of sand and recent limestone, whilst the
valleys were thickly wooded with grass-trees and stunted
Banksias. The general line of route I followed was south by east,
and we had not travelled more than nine miles when we came
suddenly upon a valley with a river running rapidly through it.
The sight of this cheered us up; and when on tasting the water we
found it excellent, and saw adhering to the banks a species of
freshwater mussel (Unio) called by the natives Maraylya, our joy
was complete.</p>

<p>SUPERSTITIOUS FEELINGS OF KAIBER REGARDING MUSSELS.</p>

<p>I proceeded therefore to collect wood for my fire and ordered
Kaiber to make haste and gather some of these mussels, an order
which, considering the hungry state he was in, I imagined he
would gladly have obeyed; but to my astonishment he refused
positively to touch one of them, and evidently regarded them with
a superstitious dread and abhorrence. My arguments to induce him
to move were all thrown away; he constantly affirmed that if he
touched these shellfish through their agency the Boyl-yas* would
acquire some mysterious influence over him, which would end in
his death. He could not state a recent instance of any ill
effects having happened from handling or catching the mussel; but
when I taunted him with this he very shrewdly replied that his
inability to do so only arose from the fact of nobody being
"wooden-headed enough" to meddle with them, and that he intended
to have nothing whatever to do with them. This much he assured me
was certain: that a very very long time ago some natives had
eaten them, and that bad spirits had immediately killed them for
so doing.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The Boyl-ya is the native
sorcerer.)</blockquote>

<p>Kaiber was a great deal too sensible a fellow to be allowed to
remain a prey to so ridiculous a superstition as this was; I
therefore ordered him instantly to go and bring some of these
mussels to me; that I intended to eat them, but that he could in
this respect please himself. He hereupon, after thinking for a
moment or two, got up to obey me, and walked away for this
purpose; but I heard him, whilst occupied in the task, lamenting
his fate most bitterly. It was true, he said, that he had not
died either of hunger or thirst, but this was all owing to his
courage and strong sinews, yet what would these avail against the
supernatural powers of the boyl-yas. "They will eat me at night,
whilst, worn out by fatigue, I must sleep." Amidst these and
sundry other similar exclamations he brought the mussels to me:
by this time my fire was prepared, and in a few minutes I was
making such a meal as the weak state of my stomach would admit
of. No inducement of mine could however prevail upon Kaiber to
share with me, and I therefore handed him the remains of the
cockatoo.</p>

<p>As soon as my repast was concluded I walked about three miles
up the river in the hopes of getting a duck, Kaiber accompanying
me. We saw several but killed none. There were some fine reaches
in the river, as well as some good flats along its banks.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled about three miles in a south by
east direction, and then came to the bed of a small stream, which
ran from east to west but was now merely a chain of pools. Across
the bed where we passed it was a native weir. Our route during
the whole evening lay over hills of a nature similar to those we
passed yesterday. We did not halt until it was so dark that we
could not see to walk, and then just dropped at the spot where we
ceased to move.</p>

<p>DISTRESS FROM COLD.</p>

<p>The men made their fire and I lighted mine from theirs; but
scarcely was this done ere the rain fell in torrents. I had no
blankets or protection of any kind against this, and Kaiber was
in the same predicament; so that when the fire was extinguished
our position became pitiable in the extreme, for I know not if I
ever before suffered so much from cold; and to add to my
annoyance I every now and then heard Kaiber chattering to
himself, under its effects, rather than singing:</p>

<p>Oh wherefore did he eat the mussels?<br>
Now the boyl-yas storms and thunder make;<br>
Oh wherefore would he eat the mussels?"</p>

<p>At last I so completely lost my temper that I roared out, "You
stone-headed fellow, Kaiber, if you talk of mussels again, I'll
beat you." "What spoke I this morning?" replied Kaiber; "you are
stone-headed. We shall be dead directly; wherefore ate you the
mussels?" This was beyond what my patience in my present starved
state could endure, so I got up and began to grope about for a
stick or something to throw in the direction of the chattering
blockhead; but he begged me to remain quiet, promising faithfully
to make no more mention of the mussels. I therefore squatted
down, in a state of the most abject wretchedness.</p>

<p>CRIPPLED STATE OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>I nearly expired from cold and pain during this inclement
night; the rheumatism in the hip in which I had been wounded was
dreadful, and I lost the power of moving my extremities from
cold. Kaiber must have suffered even more for he had nothing but
a shirt on, whereas I had also a pair of trousers. The men were
in somewhat better condition for they had a blanket, or rather a
piece of one, between each two, and lying together they afforded
one another mutual warmth. The long starvation which we had
undergone had totally unfitted us all to cope with anything like
cold.</p>

<p>April 19.</p>

<p>The rain and clouds protracted the morning dawn until late,
which somewhat lengthened our miseries. As soon however as it was
light enough to see our way we started, and moved slowly onwards
in a south by east direction. The men were all completely
crippled from the cold of the night, and it was with the greatest
difficulty I could get either them or the native to move. My own
energies were however only raised from these calls upon them, and
I cheered them on as well as I could. Corporal Coles, my faithful
and tried companion in all my wanderings, could scarcely crawl
along. The flesh was completely torn away from one of his heels,
and the irritation caused by this had produced a large swelling
in the groin. Nothing but his own strong fortitude, aided by the
encouragement given him by myself and his comrades, could have
made him move under his great agony.</p>

<p>Still however we advanced slowly; other lives depended on our
exertions; and whenever I reminded the men of this for a minute
or two they quickened their pace. Pale, wasted, and weak, we
still crawled onwards in the straight line for Perth, which I
assured them they would reach on Saturday night or Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>RIVER OF RUNNING WATER. PASS THE MOORE RIVER.</p>

<p>About two hours and a half after starting we crossed the
southern branch of the Moore River, which was running strong; but
the rain, which had only just ceased, prevented our being
thirsty.</p>

<p>The whole of this day's route lay over hills similar to those
we had found yesterday. We moved on, occasionally halting for a
few minutes, until it was so dark we could no longer see, and
then laid down, having again this day tasted no food.</p>

<p>MISERY FROM RAIN AND COLD.</p>

<p>It rained hard all night and our miseries of the last one were
repeated. We were also less able to bear them, being weaker from
longer abstinence. This day we travelled about one-and-twenty
miles.</p>

<p>DESPONDING FEELINGS.</p>

<p>April 20.</p>

<p>This morning we rose again, weak and stiffened from the cold
and wet; life had long ceased to have any charms for me, and I
fancy that the others must have experienced a similar feeling. A
disinclination to move pervaded the whole, and I had much the
same desire to sink into the sleep of death, that one feels to
take a second slumber of a morning after great fatigue. My life
was not worth the magnitude of the effort that it cost me to
move; but other lives depended on mine, so I rose up weak and
giddy and by degrees induced the rest to start also. Poor Coles
however was in a dreadful state.</p>

<p>The country through which we were travelling is intersected by
a long line of lakes which run nearly parallel to the sea for a
distance of about forty-five miles. One of the party had
travelled in the same direction with me before, but we had then
kept along the edge of the lakes. He had imagined however that
they were only two or three miles distant from the sea, whereas
many of them were as much as eight or ten. The route we were
pursuing was about midway between the lakes and the sea, and this
man seeing nothing of the lakes could not be convinced that I was
right in the position I said we then were; for I assured the men
they were not more than twenty-seven or twenty-eight miles to the
north of Perth; but I heard him relating his doubts, which tended
to discourage the others very much.</p>

<p>A PARTY OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>We however walked on as well as we could until near noon, at
which time, from excessive weakness, we had not made more than
eight miles, or about a mile and a quarter an hour, when we
suddenly came out on the bed of a dried-up swamp, now looking
like a desert of white sand studded with reeds. The forms of
natives were seen wandering about this, one mile from us, who
were searching for frogs. There was a very numerous party, and
they did not appear at all inclined to approach us. Now it was
very evident that if we were so near Perth as I imagined these
natives must be well acquainted with Europeans; for although but
very little was known of the country to the north of Perth, and
the farthest settlement in that direction was only four miles
from the town, still the natives must, from mere curiosity, have
been frequently in the settlement.</p>

<p>JOYFUL INTERVIEW WITH A FRIENDLY TRIBE. KAIBER'S OPINION OF
THEM.</p>

<p>We therefore approached them but as we came near they
withdrew. Kaiber was now called into consultation; he scrutinised
them long and carefully, and then announced that they were
"mondak yoongar," wild natives; and, after a second survey of
them, declared that they had the "mondak kurrang kombar," or
great bush fury, on them, or rather, were subject to wild
untutored rage. After making this announcement he squatted down
under a bush to conceal himself, and then recapitulating rapidly
all the dangers we had gone through, conjured me not to bring him
into a fresh scrape by having anything to do with such a numerous
party of his countrymen in our present weak state.</p>

<p>The men, who understood enough of what he was saying to know
that he thought these natives had never seen Europeans, became
extremely uneasy and begged me to allow them to fire a gun as a
signal to them: "For if we are so near Perth as you suppose,
Sir," they said to me, "these natives will come to us." Kaiber
hereupon told me that the instant the gun was fired he should run
away. This was rather too ridiculous a threat when the coward was
afraid to move five yards from us; I therefore ordered a gun to
be fired, and then, telling the men to remain steady and prepared
in case of accident, I walked off towards the natives, Kaiber, in
the meanwhile, sitting on his haunches under cover, muttering to
himself, "The swan, the big head, the stone forehead;" and, as
these denunciations reached me, I could not, even in all my
misery, forbear smiling at them.</p>

<p>DISCOVERED TO BE FRIENDS.</p>

<p>The natives no sooner heard the gun and saw me approaching
than they came running to me. Presently Kaiber called out to me,
"Mr. Grey, Mr. Grey, nadjoo watto, nginnee yalga nginnow," "Mr.
Grey, Mr. Grey, I am going to them; you sit here a little;" and
he then, with his long thin ungainly legs, bounded by me like a
deer. "Imbat, friend," I heard him cry out, as a young man came
running up to him. I grew giddy; I knew Imbat by name, and felt
assured that at all events the lives of a great portion of my
party were safe. In a few minutes Kaiber had given an outline of
our adventures and present state. Fearing such mischances as had
really happened to me, I had, previously to my departure to the
north, done my utmost to cultivate the friendship of the northern
natives; and most of them, even to the distance of sixty or
seventy miles from Perth in that direction, had received presents
from me. My name was well known amongst them as a tried friend,
although indeed my common denomination was "Wokeley brudder," or
Oakley's brother; for, from my giving them flour, they concluded
that I was a relation of the baker of that name at Perth.</p>

<p>HOSPITABLE RECEPTION BY THEM.</p>

<p>The women were soon called up, bark baskets of frogs opened
for us, by-yu nuts roasted, and as a special delicacy I obtained
a small fresh-water tortoise. "Now, friend, sleep whilst I cook,"
said Imbat, and lighting a fire he made me lie down and try to
slumber whilst he roasted some frogs and the turtle for me. I was
not over-well pleased at the skill he chose to exhibit in his
cookery, for he thereby delayed me for a longer time than was
agreeable, but we were all soon regaling on this native fare.</p>

<p>Anxious questions were put by the men as to their distance
from Perth, and the natives all told them they would see it the
next morning, "whilst the sun was still small;" and on further
enquiry it turned out that a kangaroo hunter of the name of
Porley was at a hut distant only seven miles from us, and
according to the account of the natives he had a supply of
provisions with him. As soon therefore as I had a little
recruited my strength I started on with Imbat to the hut, leaving
the men to follow in company with the other natives as rapidly as
their strength would allow them. Imbat carried my gun and
everything but a book or two and my papers, which, being precious
documents, I had never trusted out of my own possession, however
heavy my labours and misfortunes had been. He moved merrily
along, trying to win me from my moody thoughts by relating all
the news of the settlement both as concerned the Europeans and
natives; for like all other idle people the natives are great
gossips and really love a little scandal. Worn out from fatigue,
I was rather petulant and ill-tempered, but Imbat talked on
unmindful of this, or only laughed at me, and jeered me for
it.</p>

<p>IMBAT'S NOTIONS.</p>

<p>My intentions in going on were to have everything prepared for
the men on their arrival at the hut; but when I reached it I
found it deserted, the owner having returned to Perth. I however
lit a fire and laid down, Imbat again beginning to cook, and then
chattering: "What for do you who have plenty to eat and much
money walk so far away in the bush?" I felt amazingly annoyed at
this question and therefore did not answer him. "You are thin,"
said he, "your shanks are long, your belly is small, you had
plenty to eat at home, why did you not stop there?" I was vexed
at his personalities, besides which it is impossible to make a
native understand our love of travel. I therefore replied,
"Imbat, you comprehend nothing, you know nothing." "I know
nothing!" answered he; "I know how to keep myself fat; the young
women look at me and say, Imbat is very handsome, he is fat. They
will look at you and say, He not good, long legs, what do you
know? where is your fat? what for do you know so much if you
can't keep fat? I know how to stay at home and not to walk too
far in the bush. Where is your fat?" "You know how to talk; long
tongue;" was my reply; upon which Imbat, forgetting his anger,
burst into a roar of laughter, and saying, "and I know how to
make you fat," began stuffing me with frogs, barde, and by-yu
nuts. The rest of the party arrived just before nightfall, and,
searching the hut, found a paper of tea, and an old tin pot in
which they cooked some, and then eating frogs, etc., for their
supper, we all laid down to sleep, and in the silence of the
night I rendered fervent thanks to my Maker who had again brought
us so near the haven where we would be."</p>

<p>OPINIONS OF THE MEN REGARDING THE FATE OF OUR OTHER PARTY.</p>

<p>April 21.</p>

<p>It had rained all night but we had been a little sheltered by
the hut; though from the state of anxiety we were in sleep did
not visit our eyes. This was the first time since I had been out
that I had slept so near the men as to be able to overhear their
conversation; but the rain forced us all to seek the shelter of
the same little hut, and I thus gathered the different stories
that they narrated to one another. Their speculations and
conjectures naturally ran upon our absent comrades; some imagined
that they were within a day or two's march of us, but another
party held firmly to the opinion that we should never see them
more.</p>

<p>SUPERSTITIONS OF MY MEN.</p>

<p>They could give no apparently satisfactory reason for holding
this opinion, and, as there was evidently some deep mystery
connected with it, I kept on pressing my servant Coles in order
to induce him to tell me whence it arose. At last it came out
that Mr. Walker had had a dream, when we were on the shores of
Shark Bay and before we had commenced our return home, that some
dreadful misfortune had befallen us and that Mr. Smith, Thomas
Ruston, and he himself, were endeavouring to make the Isle of
France in a boat, when Mr. Smith died, and the remaining two had
eaten his body. Mr. Walker had, with the utmost imprudence,
related this dream to some of the men, and they, with that
superstition which is so common amongst sailors and Englishmen of
the lower orders, had attached a great degree of importance to
it; many circumstances which had hitherto been unexplained to me
now flashed upon my mind; poor Mr. Smith had been very ill at the
time Mr. Walker had related this inauspicious dream, and at that
period an extraordinary degree of despondency had crept over him,
so much so that some of the men imagined he had become deranged.
When also we were working our way down the eastern coast of Shark
Bay in the boats others of the party had got into a very
desponding state, one of whom, Henry Woods, had even gone so far
as to tell me when I remonstrated with him on this point that he
knew that the greater part of us wore doomed, and that our lives
were worth nothing.</p>

<p>My anxiety for those I had left behind me now increased, and
about an hour and a half before daylight I started for Perth with
Imbat, leaving the others to follow as rapidly as they could, and
telling them that I would have food ready for them at Williams's
cottage, who was the settler living farthest north from Perth. In
about an hour and a half I reached Williams's hut, which I
entered, and found his wife and another woman at breakfast.</p>

<p>I had often got a drink of milk at this cottage when I had
before been at Perth, and I flattered myself that Mrs. Williams
would recollect me; little calculating how strangely want and
suffering had changed my appearance. The two women only stared
with the utmost surprise and said, "Why, Magic, what's the matter
with you?" (They alluded to a crazy Malay who used to visit the
outsettler's houses, and who had somehow or the other acquired
the nickname of Magic.) I was rather hurt at my reception and
said, "I am not Magic;" at this they both burst into a roar of
laughter and Mrs. Williams said, "Well, then, my good man, who
are you?" "One who is almost starved," was my reply. "Will you
take this then," said my hostess, handing me a cup of tea she was
raising to her lips. "With all my heart and soul, and God reward
you for it," was my answer, and I swallowed the delicious
draught. Imbat, who had been to search for Williams, now came in
and explained who I was; in a few minutes more I was seated at a
comfortable breakfast; water was put on to boil, and by the time
the things were prepared the rest of the party came up. ARRIVAL
AND RECEPTION AT PERTH. NOT RECOGNIZED BY MY FRIENDS.</p>

<p>I now washed and made myself as clean as possible. I could
obtain no conveyance to take us on to Perth and therefore started
to walk in with Imbat, leaving the others to complete their
breakfast; but I soon found myself dreadfully ill from having
eaten too profusely; still I pushed on as well as I could, and in
about an hour and a half reached the house of my friend, L.
Samson, Esquire. He could not believe it was me whom he beheld,
but having convinced himself of the fact he made me swallow about
a tea-spoonful of brandy, and, recruited by this, I was
sufficiently recovered to wait upon His Excellency the Governor
in order to have immediate steps taken to send off a party in
search of my missing comrades.</p>

<p>The Governor could scarcely credit his sight when he beheld
the miserable object that stood before him; but in this as in all
other instances in which I have known him the goodness of his
heart shone conspicuous; not only was every kindness shown me but
immediate steps were taken to forward assistance to those who
were still in the bush. Having thus far performed my duty I
retired to press a bed once more, having for nearly three
consecutive months slept in the open air, on the ground just at
the spot where my day's hardship had terminated. So changed was I
that those of my friends who had heard of my arrival and were
coming to congratulate me passed me in the street, whilst others
to whom I went up and held out my hand drew back in horror and
said, "I beg your pardon, who are you?"</p>

<p>Ere I was in bed the remainder of the men who were journeying
with me arrived, and it had thus pleased Providence to conduct
six of us through great suffering and want to the termination of
our miseries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5. FROM WATER PEAK TO PERTH.</h2>

<p>(MR. WALKER'S PARTY.)</p>

<p>PARTY SENT IN SEARCH FROM PERTH.</p>

<p>I arrived at Perth on the 21st of April and not a moment was
lost in preparing a party to go in search of the men I had left
with Mr. Walker, and who, it will be recollected, were instructed
to proceed along the coast until they made the Moore River, where
assistance was to be sent out to them from Perth.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR THE OTHER PARTY.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 23rd of April Lieutenant Mortimer of the
21st regiment and Mr. Spofforth, with four soldiers, left Perth
and arrived on the Moore River in two days; but after traversing
its banks in vain for two days more they abandoned all hope of
finding those they were in search of there, and pursued a
straight course about 25 miles further north, when they fell in
with another river where they formed a depot, and detours were
made in various directions for several days without any
avail.</p>

<p>RETURN WITH CHARLES WOODS.</p>

<p>At length, on one of these excursions, the seaman Charles
Woods, one of my party, was found by Mr. Spofforth, lying on the
beach, wrapped in his blanket and fast asleep. He soon awoke and
was not a little delighted to recognise Mr. Spofforth whom he had
seen before at Fremantle. By the account Woods gave it appears
that from the period of my departure much disorder and discontent
at the direction of their course prevailed among the men. They
frequently left the beach and wandered inland to procure water
and food, not sufficiently exerting themselves to advance
southward. They had succeeded, he said, in procuring upon the
whole about a dozen birds, a crab, and eighteen fish. On the 21st
of April Mr. Walker, who had frequently exerted himself in
procuring firewood and water for the weaker of the party, divided
two dough cakes still remaining in his possession among them all.
They were then upon the beach, and though still at a great
distance from the appointed place of rendezvous the men were very
unwilling to distress themselves to reach it, being persuaded
they should be tracked, wherever they might be, by the natives
whom I should send to their help. Woods, being dissatisfied with
their slow progress, now quitted them at a place where, he says,
they had to go round two very deep bays close together, which
took him a whole day; and it was owing to his having obeyed my
instructions more strictly than the others that he was found by
Mr. Spofforth. Woods, who seemed to have a singularly accurate
idea of the distance he was from Perth when found, added that he
thought he could have walked to it had he not been discovered,
although he had nothing to eat but a few native figs; and that he
thought the whole of the party were getting more accustomed to
native food and were latterly better than they had been at first;
he said he felt so himself.</p>

<p>SECOND PARTY IN SEARCH, UNDER MR. ROE.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Mortimer's party, having made every exertion but in
vain to find the five remaining persons, were compelled at the
end of a fortnight by want of provisions to return to Perth,
where they arrived on the 6th of May; and early the next morning
the Surveyor-General, Mr. Roe, accompanied by Mr. Spofforth (who
again volunteered his services) four men, and two native youths,
with five horses, set out in search of those still missing.</p>

<p>ARRIVAL OF MR. WALKER AT PERTH. JOURNAL OF MR. WALKER'S
PARTY.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, two days after the departure of Mr. Roe's
party, Mr. Walker came into Perth alone, and from his statement,
together with what was gleaned subsequently from the other men, I
shall here briefly narrate what befel them after my departure on
the 10th of April.</p>

<p>NARRATIVE OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS FROM WATER PEAK.</p>

<p>On the next day they started at dawn and soon came to a great
deal of scrub; this was the belt of thick wood mentioned in my
journal. Mr. Walker says the men, being disheartened at this,
they went down to the beach and halted about a mile from it;
Water Peak Hill being distant about fifteen miles. Woods said
much discontent was caused amongst the men by its being conceived
that they were following a bad course; or, according to Ruston's
expression, that "the steering was very bad."</p>

<p>April 12.</p>

<p>They found a river with pools of water in coarse gravel in
which they caught here two small fish, and travelled six miles
through the scrub along a native path.</p>

<p>April 13.</p>

<p>They started and went down towards the beach. The men cut and
cooked some greens but found no water. Travelled twelve or
fourteen miles along the beach.</p>

<p>Sunday April 14.</p>

<p>They shot a pigeon, two red-bills, and a hawk. In the
afternoon it rained, and they travelled along the beach and got
some cockles, and found a fine stream of water running out from
under the rocks. They then got under the scrub to keep the rain
off, having made about eight miles.</p>

<p>April 15.</p>

<p>They again came out on the beach and kept along it. Good
travelling. Made a march of nearly twenty miles.</p>

<p>EXTREME DISTRESS FROM HUNGER AND THIRST.</p>

<p>April 16.</p>

<p>They continued on the beach till they came to a good place for
fishing and caught eighteen. Mr. Walker shot a bird. After eating
the fish, they were all very thirsty.</p>

<p>April 17.</p>

<p>Went into the interior about midday and found a native well
six miles inland; also a large cave in the rocks. The party here
procured and ate some Zamia nuts.</p>

<p>April 18.</p>

<p>They were all sick from the nuts, and turned back to the beach
about four miles but did not reach it.</p>

<p>April 19.</p>

<p>This morning they reached the beach and travelled on until
they came to some high rocks from whence they saw an immense
tract of sand. Again this evening they went into the interior to
find water. Boiled some young trees and ate them.</p>

<p>April 20.</p>

<p>They were travelling into the interior along the steep banks
of a river running nearly east. Got plenty of green stuff to eat.
They had now two guns and the means of getting fire, but the
powder and shot was nearly expended. The axe I left with them had
been lost soon after.</p>

<p>April 21.</p>

<p>Woods left the others to proceed alone.</p>

<p>April 22.</p>

<p>Being the day after Woods left they went into the interior
about six miles from the coast and there found a river, which Mr.
Walker and Mr. Smith thought was the Karpan (the Moore). This
river was standing in pools, and there was a great rush of water
from the hills; they traced the bed up for two or three miles,
where it came out from some very high hills, when Mr. Smith said
he was certain that it was not the Karpan. They then made a south
by west course, and thought where they came out was 12 miles
below where Woods left them; and that the river was nearly
halfway between these two points.</p>

<p>They now again turned into the interior, being, as they
thought, at the bay to the south of Jurieu Bay.</p>

<p>April 23.</p>

<p>They returned and kept along the beach, made about fifteen
miles, when they halted close to it.</p>

<p>April 24.</p>

<p>They went on for five or six miles, then halted and made a
fire with the end of a spar.</p>

<p>April 25.</p>

<p>They travelled two or three hundred yards. Mr. Walker went
back for the end of the spar and Mr. Smith cut some firewood.
There they halted, catching fish and crabs.</p>

<p>April 26 and 27.</p>

<p>Still halted at this spot, fishing, and caught parrot-fish,
rock-cod, etc.; so that they had as much fish as they could use,
and found fresh water in the holes of the rocks.</p>

<p>April 28.</p>

<p>They started at dawn and went on for a mile. Ruston was taken
ill from the number of crabs he had eaten, and Mr. Walker stopped
with him whilst the other three went on a mile ahead and got fish
and periwinkles. Mr. Smith, Stiles, and Clotworthy had a little
water left; Ruston and Mr. Walker had canteens half-full. Ruston
got better in the evening but they did not proceed until the next
morning.</p>

<p>April 29.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker moved on with Ruston about a mile and there found
Mr. Smith clambering up some rocks, and having plenty of
periwinkles, of which he gave them some. Clotworthy had stopped
up all night and had picked up enough for four or five days. At
night at low tide they got nearly fresh water running out from
under the rocks.</p>

<p>April 30.</p>

<p>They still halted, living on the periwinkles; but this evening
the water was more salt.</p>

<p>May 1.</p>

<p>This day the party separated into two portions and did not
meet again until the 2nd, on which day Mr. Walker left them by
agreement, he being the strongest of the party. His object was to
proceed as expeditiously as he could to Fremantle and send from
thence a boat and fresh water for the relief of the rest. The
party he left behind having agreed to keep a constant look out on
the beach and hoist concerted signals.</p>

<p>For two days after Mr. Walker left them it appears they
wandered about to look for water and then fished. They
fortunately fell in with a cask of water, washed up on the beach,
from which they filled their canteens, roasted the fish and
started on again, but made no distance. This lasted for several
days. They subsisted by picking up a few shellfish and some dead
birds which had been washed ashore, and they ate a sort of cane
that grows near the beach, and the Hottentot fig.</p>

<p>DEATH OF MR. SMITH.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith now gradually became exhausted, and at last one
evening sat down on a bank, and said he could not go on. He was
behind the party with Ruston, who thought he was dying, and went
on and told the other men. The next morning Ruston went back to
try and find where Mr. Smith was, but was so weak that (as he
thought) he did not go far enough, and did not find him. Mr.
Smith seems to have crawled up into the bush, a little on one
side of their route, and there died.</p>

<p>TIMELY DISCOVERY OF THE REST BY MR. ROE. MR. ROE'S REPORT.</p>

<p>Four days after the rest were picked up by Mr. Roe's party,
whose proceedings I shall now relate from his own interesting
report; premising that the men had then been three days without
water and four days without food, and had nothing to eat but the
sweet cane that grows near the beach.</p>

<p>MR. ROE PROCEEDS IN SEARCH OF THE MISSING MEN.</p>

<p>Mr. Roe says:</p>

<p>Leaving Perth early on the 8th instant, accompanied by Mr. E.
Spofforth and four men, with the native youths Warrup and Wyip,
and five horses, we travelled in a north by west direction along
a chain of beautiful lakes, from three to ten miles apart, and
surrounded by good soil and grass to a short distance; and in the
middle of the third day reached Neergabby on the Garban River,
about 52 miles distant. Giving our horses an hour's rest, I rode
forward twelve miles with Mr. Spofforth and Warrup to the mouth
of the river, where we hoped to find some traces of the
absentees; but to our disappointment and regret not a footmark
was to be seen on the sand except those of Woods, and the written
directions which had been placed conspicuously on sticks so as to
intercept the track of the wanderers were either untouched or
washed down by the high tides. Replacing these with full
instructions how to proceed, we returned to our camp at
Neergabby, where we were joined by some natives of the district,
from whom however no information whatever could be obtained
respecting the objects of our search. Inferring from these
circumstances that they could not yet have reached so far south,
and that they might probably have quitted the beach for the
purpose of seeking fresh water inland, we lost no time in pushing
on to the northward, and at sunset of the 11th took up our
bivouac at Barrumbur on the Moore River, seventeen miles in
advance, where excellent water was found in deep pools and our
horses revelled in luxuriant pasturage. Between the two rivers
there is a great extent of level country, so much under water in
wet weather as to be then totally impassable with horses or
carts, and the beds of the rivers (near which there is generally
good cattle feed) assume the form of deep sandy pools, a few
yards apart and grooved to the depth of 25 or 30 feet below the
level of the banks.</p>

<p>Being desirous of penetrating the country further to the north
before we again visited the beach, which was computed to be about
fifteen miles distant with no water or feed for our horses in the
intermediate space, we buried half our provisions, etc., in a
hole beneath our temporary shelter, which was then fired in order
to lull the suspicion of the natives; and our sable companions
having secreted the pannier-baskets and packsaddles among the
adjoining bushes in such a way as to defy discovery, we trusted
to Providence for the result, and next morning resumed our
northern route. Leaving the extensive shallow lakes of Garbanup,
at this time quite dry, about two miles on our left, we traversed
a more hilly and dry sandy district than before, and had an
elevated mountainous country fifteen or twenty miles to the
eastward. We had now entered upon the inhospitable tract in which
Mr. Grey and his party had been so much distressed for water on
the homeward journey, and their feet-marks were distinctly
recognised by our natives around a swampy space in search of
some. At the end of sixteen miles we reached Nowergup, a small
rushy lake, at this time quite dry and dusty at the surface, but
having at its north end a small well, seven feet deep, containing
about a gallon of stinking water. Although this proved very
palatable after a dry day's journey, it was by no means adapted
to the wants of five horses, and we gladly accepted the services
of one of the natives of the district to conduct us to a larger
quantity. Our way to it led over a mile and a quarter of nearly
level country, entirely under water in winter, and covered with
rushes and tea-trees. At the lowest level was a well with
abundance of water two feet below the surface, near which we
immediately took up our quarters and learnt that the spot was
called by them Bookernyup. We were also given to understand that
the country to the northward and westward was at this time of the
year entirely without water, and that none was to be found nearer
than a river "far away" in the north-east.</p>

<p>This account by no means lessened our fears for the poor
fellows of whom we were in search, and led us to determine on
leaving the party here, and making a forced march of two or three
days to the north-west with the smallest possible supplies, in
the hope of reaching the spot where the absentees had been left
by Woods, and which we supposed to be the vicinity of Jurieu
Bay.</p>

<p>SUCCEEDS IN FINDING THEIR TRACES.</p>

<p>Previous however to putting this plan into execution, it was
considered advisable to visit the beach again, fifteen or sixteen
miles distant, on doing which next morning, with Mr. Spofforth
and Warrup, we had the satisfaction to find the feet-marks of
five men on the sand, taking a southerly direction. Warrup having
pronounced them to be without doubt the footsteps of white men,
and not more than two or three days old, we followed them eagerly
along the shore for a mile, and then came to an empty cask that
had been washed on shore, together with several broken bottles
and a stone jar. On further examination part of the head of the
cask was found much cut with a knife, as if used for a plate, and
near the extinct embers of a small fire lay the bones of a fish,
which Warrup concluded had been picked on the morning of the
previous day. Rejoiced at having now got upon the right track,
and being unwilling to lose time by following it up from this
spot, we took a good look round and returned to our camp at
Bookernyup by sunset, from whence we next morning started early
in a southerly direction, took up safely everything we had
concealed on the Moore River, and shortly after dark had
completed 24 miles to a place called Kadjelup, where we halted on
some deep pools similar to those at Barrumbur.</p>

<p>Breakfasting early on the 15th, the baggage was despatched
forward to Neergabby, and at daybreak Mr. Spofforth, Kinchela (a
private of the 21st regiment) and Warrup accompanied me on
horseback to the beach, which we found eleven miles off, but to
our great disappointment a very high tide had totally obliterated
all marks from the sand and left us in perplexity and doubt.
Concluding however that the missing party must be in advance of
us, and that they could not fail to observe the papers which had
been offered to their notice at the mouth of the Garban River, we
turned our steps that way; left a paper of directions in the
event of their being behind us, and carefully examined both beach
and sandhills, as well as the country immediately in rear of
them. Twelve miles brought us to the mouth of the river, and
there we found everything as we had placed it--not a mark near
the beach except the footsteps of the native dog prowling about
the sandhills, and nothing which could lead to a belief that the
spot had been visited since we last left it. Somewhat
disappointed, although rejoicing in having now hemmed the
unfortunate absentees up into a narrow limit, within which we
knew they MUST be wandering towards Perth, we joined our party at
Neergabby shortly after dark, and observed on our way the traces
of five natives who were confidently said by Warrup to be Perth
natives, sent to look after us with intelligence. They had come
along the coast from the south as far as the mouth of the river,
and had struck inland to the south-east on their return. The
conclusions of this intelligent lad on the occasion were
afterwards found to be strictly correct, even to the names of the
men who composed the party.</p>

<p>PROVIDENTIAL DISCOVERY OF THEM.</p>

<p>The early morning of the 16th found us all in busy preparation
for the day's proceedings and relying with reasonable confidence
on a successful issue to our exertions. The remainder of the
party were sent back with one horse to Kadjelup, whilst my
indefatigable companion Mr. Spofforth accompanied me, with
Kinchela and the two natives and four horses, to resume our
examination of the beach to the north. Fifteen miles in a
north-west direction brought us to the desired spot, but still no
sign was apparent of its having been visited by any human being
since ourselves; we however commenced a close examination to the
northward, and at the end of a mile and a half had the infinite
satisfaction of falling in with three of the missing party, in
the persons of Ruston, Stiles, and Clotworthy, who had formed a
portion of the wrecked boats' crews.</p>

<p>THEIR MISERABLE CONDITION.</p>

<p>The state of distress and exhaustion in which they were found
on the beach was truly pitiable and moving. With scarcely
strength to drag one foot after the other they had marched about
a mile and a half that morning until they encountered the bold
rocky projection of land at which we discovered them, and the
passing of which they had given up as utterly hopeless from want
of sufficient strength to climb over it. Having been three days
without water except their own and the seawater, the former of
which they had saved in their canteens, and emptied out before
us, and their only food being such nourishment as they could
obtain from chewing a coarse rushy plant which grew about
high-water mark, it cannot be matter of surprise that they were
almost frantic after water, and that the portions of it which we
sparingly administered to them, mixed with a little brandy, were
most eagerly seized. Indeed the greatest firmness and forbearance
were necessary on our part to prevent the unfortunate sufferers
from committing fatal excesses. They declared their extremity to
have been so great that no chance had appeared to them of
surviving the next awful night, or of getting a foot beyond their
present position; and, to his credit be it said, one of them* had
been on his knees only ten minutes before they were rescued,
supplicating with uplifted hands that aid and assistance which
had thus, through Divine Providence, been so opportunely afforded
them.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Ruston.)</blockquote>

<p>SEARCH FOR MR. SMITH.</p>

<p>In answer to our anxious enquiries respecting Mr. Walker and
Mr. Smith we learnt that the former, being much the strongest of
the party, had, at their request, made the best of his way
towards Perth ten days since, in order to send them out
assistance, and that Mr. Smith, having been totally unable to
proceed with them any further, had remained behind, in a dying
state, four days ago. Touched by this distressing intelligence,
and sensibly alive to the value of time, we lost not a moment in
lifting our three light weights on our horses, and by supporting
them in their seats conveyed them over the sandhills to the more
level space behind, where sufficient brushwood was scattered
about for maintaining a fire. Here Mr. Spofforth kindly undertook
their charge, while I should proceed with Kinchela and Warrup in
search of poor Smith.</p>

<p>Ruston having expressed himself very anxious to accompany us,
and fearing that we might not otherwise accomplish our object,
after receiving some suitable refreshment, he was mounted, and we
all set off at as quick a pace as he could manage. At the end of
three miles a good view of the coast to the northward was opened
to us from the summit of a rising ground, and Ruston pointed out,
at the distance of 24 miles, an island near which he said young
Smith had been left. As this was far beyond the six or seven
miles of which they had at first spoken, and totally precluded
the possibility of my returning that night with the water-kegs
which I had taken to be filled at some wells which they had seen
in the vicinity, I relinquished all idea of proceeding, while the
sun was then touching the horizon, and we accordingly rejoined
Mr. Spofforth and his charge. We were now perfectly satisfied of
the wandering inconsistency in the conversation of the three
rescued men, who were evidently to a considerable extent
delirious or light-headed. Being too sore in body and excited in
mind to admit much sleep to their assistance, they were full of
their expressions of thankfulness for their timely deliverance,
and at length terminated a long and weary night.</p>

<p>DISCOVERY OF HIS BODY.</p>

<p>The morrow's dawn found me on my way with Kinchela and Warrup
to search for poor Smith, while Mr. Spofforth proceeded with the
three rescued men and Wyip to join our party at Kadjelup, 12
miles off. At the distance of a mile and a half we found the guns
of Mr. Walker and Mr. Smith, which the men had buried among the
sandhills from inability to carry them any further. A close
scrutiny of the beach brought us, at the end of ten miles, to a
spot where Warrup observed the traces of feet in the sand.
Following them up, they ascended a bare sandhill to the height of
twelve or fourteen feet, turned short round to the left, and
there terminated at the unfortunate object of our search,
extended on his back, lifeless, in the midst of a thick bush,
where he seemed to have laid himself down to sleep,
half-enveloped in his blanket. The poor fellow's last bed
appeared to have been selected by himself; and at the distance of
three or four yards from him lay all the trifling articles which
had constituted his travelling equipage. These were his wooden
canteen, his brown felt hat, and haversack, containing his
journal, shoes, tinder, steel, gun-screw, a few small canvas bags
which he had used for carrying shellfish, and a small bag with
thread, needles, and buttons. Life seemed to have been extinct
rather more than two days; and from the position of the head,
which had fallen considerably below the level of the body, we
were led to conclude that a rush of blood into the brain had
caused his death, and at last without much suffering.</p>

<p>BURIAL OF MR. SMITH.</p>

<p>With the help of the soldier and Warrup we made a grave with
our hands and buried poor Smith deep in a sandhill near the
shore, about seventy-six miles to the north of Swan River. Even
Warrup, notwithstanding the general apathy of the native
character, wept like a child over the untimely fate of this young
man, from whom he had formerly received kindness. Smoothing over
his solitary bed, and placing at the head of his grave a piece of
wood found upon the beach, we pursued our melancholy way half a
mile to the northward, where we found the water to which we had
been directed by digging 12 inches in the sand at the
commencement of a considerable sheet of bare sand, extending at
least four miles into the interior. In the course of the evening
we rejoined our party on the Moore River. Next day we halted at
Kadjelup; and on the 19th we separated at Neergabby once more,
Mr. Spofforth to conduct the remainder of the party home with as
much celerity as they could travel, whilst I proceeded with
Kinchela and Warrup to examine the coast from the mouth of the
Moore River for any traces of Mr. Walker, of whose fate we were
in total ignorance. By noon of the 22nd we had arrived within 12
miles of Perth without remarking the least trace of the supposed
absentee, when we were met by Mr. Hunt the constable with the
pleasing intelligence that Mr. Walker had reached Perth on the
9th instant. In the evening we arrived at the same place, and
found that Mr. Spofforth had brought in his charge the day
before.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION OF THE EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>If Mr. Roe's party had been delayed only a few hours there is
every probability that from the debilitated state in which the
men were found they would all have perished.</p>

<p>I deeply regretted the death of poor Frederic Smith, who had
come out from England expressly for the purpose of joining me,
led solely by the spirit of enterprise, and not with any view of
settling. He was the most youthful of the party, being only 18
years of age, and thence was less capable than the others of
bearing up against long-continued want and fatigue, and the
excessive heat of the climate, under which he gradually wasted
away until death terminated his sufferings. When aroused by
danger or stimulated by a sense of duty he was as bold as a lion,
whilst his manner to me was ever gentleness itself, as indeed it
was to all.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. He was the eldest son of Octavius Smith,
Esquire, of Thames Bank, and grandson of the late William Smith,
Esquire, long known in political life as Member for
Norwich.)</blockquote>

<p>Upon the final return of the expedition a desire was expressed
by some gentlemen of the colony of Western Australia to remove
Mr. Smith's remains to Perth; but upon mature reflection I
declined their friendly proposal, preferring rather to let him
rest close by the spot where he died, having given the name of my
ill-fated friend to a river which hides itself in the sandy
plains near where he fell so early a sacrifice to his gallant and
enterprising spirit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6. SUMMARY OF DISCOVERIES.</h2>

<p>RIVERS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES DISCOVERED.</p>

<p>Having now brought the narrative of my expedition along the
western shores of Australia to a close I shall here retrace in a
brief summary the principal geographical discoveries to which it
led.</p>

<p>The country examined during this expedition lies between Cape
Cuvier and Swan River, having for its longitudinal limits the
parallel of 24 degrees and that of 32 degrees south latitude, and
the expedition combined two objects: the examination and nautical
survey of such parts of the coast lying between these limits as
were imperfectly known, and the exploration of such parts of the
continent as might on examination appear worthy of particular
notice.</p>

<p>RIVERS DISCOVERED.</p>

<p>In the course of my explorations ten rivers, which are, when
considered with reference to the other known ones of Western
Australia, of considerable importance, were discovered, some of
them being larger than any yet found in the south-west of this
continent; many smaller streams were also found.</p>

<p>The larger rivers I have named:</p>

<p>The Gascoyne,<br>
The Murchison,<br>
The Hutt,<br>
The Bowes,<br>
The Buller,<br>
The Chapman,<br>
The Greenough,<br>
The Irwin,<br>
The Arrowsmith,<br>
The Smith.</p>

<p>Two mountain ranges were discovered; one at the northern
extremity of the Darling Range and about thirty miles to the
eastward of it, lofty and altogether differing in character from
the Darling, which at this point, where its direction is nearly
north and south, is called Moresby's Flat-topped Range.</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of naming this northern range, after
her most gracious Majesty, The Victoria Range; and the extensive
district of fertile country extending from its base to the sea,
and having a length of more than fifty miles in a north and south
direction, I have also named the Province of Victoria, trusting
that her Majesty will not object to bestow her name upon one of
the finest provinces in this her new, vast, and almost unknown
empire; and which, protected in its very birth and infancy by her
fostering hand, will doubtless ere long attain to no mean destiny
among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>The other range is thrown off in a westerly direction from the
Darling Range; it is about forty miles in length from north to
south, of a bare, sterile, and barren nature, and terminates
seaward in Mount Perron and Mount Lesueur; to this range I have
given the name of Gairdner's Range: it forms a very important
feature in the geography of this part of Australia.</p>

<p>DISTRICTS OF BABBAGE AND VICTORIA.</p>

<p>Three extensive districts of good country were also found in
the course of this expedition, the Province of Victoria, before
alluded to, the district of Babbage, and another adjacent to
Perth, to which I have not affixed a name.</p>

<p>The district of Babbage is situated on and near the river
Gascoyne, which stream discharges itself in the central part of
the main that fronts Shark Bay, and may indeed almost be recorded
as the central point of the western coast of Australia; thus at
once occupying the most commanding position in Shark Bay and one
of the most interesting points on that coast; it is moreover the
key to a very fine district which is the only one in that vast
inlet that appears well adapted to the purposes of
colonization.</p>

<p>COAST OF SHARK BAY.</p>

<p>Immediately to the south of the southern mouth of this river
commences a line of shoals which at low-water are nearly dry,
extending to a distance of from two to four miles from the coast
and running with scarcely any intermission round the bay: except
at high-water it is therefore impossible to approach the greater
part of the coast, even in the smallest boat, unless by tracking
it over those flats, which proceeding is not unattended with
danger, for, if it comes on to blow at all hard, owing to the
shoalness of the water, the whole of them becomes a mass of
broken billows. I feel convinced it was owing to this
circumstance that the navigators who had previously visited this
bay left so large a portion of its coast unexplored.</p>

<p>The shoals in the vicinity of the mouth of this river, as well
as those in the river itself, have many snags upon them; and on
the coast of Bernier Island, opposite to the main, we found the
remains of large trees which had been washed down the river and
had then been drifted across the bay. It was that circumstance
which first convinced me that a large river existed hereabouts,
and induced me so minutely to examine the coast.</p>

<p>This occurrence of driftwood in the neighbourhood of large
rivers is a circumstance unknown upon the south-western shores of
this continent. I however observed it in Prince Regent's River
and other rivers to the north, as well as in the Arrowsmith. This
latter however is the most southern river in which I have
remarked it, and it certainly is an evidence of the existence of
timber of a much lighter description than has hitherto been known
in this part of the continent.</p>

<p>MOUTHS OF THE GASCOYNE.</p>

<p>The southern mouth of the Gascoyne is however completely free
from shoals, and has seven feet water on the bar at low tide.
There is also a channel in it which has never less than this
depth of water for about four miles from its mouth, after which
it is only navigable for small boats in the dry season, and that
merely for a short distance.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty which presents itself in entering the
southern mouth arises from what in America are termed snags, that
is, large trees, the roots of which are firmly planted in the bed
of the river, whilst the branches project up the stream, and are
likely to pierce any boat in its passage down. These snags are
however more to be feared at the time of high-water than at any
other period, for they have generally become fixed upon shoals as
they originally descended the river, and at low water can easily
be seen.</p>

<p>The northern mouth of the Gascoyne is more difficult of
entrance than its southern one, being narrower and more shoal. I
still however think that at high water it could be entered by
small craft; but as my examination of it was hurried and
imperfect from our being pressed for provisions at the time I was
there, the opinion I have given above must be received with
caution.</p>

<p>Our visit to this river took place at the close of a season
which had been preceded by the driest one known since the
occupation of the western coasts by Europeans. There was
consequently but little fresh water in the bed of the river, and
this only in small pools; but the breadth of its main channel
(for it sometimes had several) was where I measured it upwards of
three hundred yards, and this measurement was made in a part
which was by no means the widest.</p>

<p>THE COUNTRY ADJACENT.</p>

<p>The bed of the river was composed of fine white sand. The
country had a gentle slope from the interior, and no land of any
great elevation was visible from the farthest point I attained,
distant about fifteen miles from the coast.</p>

<p>Plains of a rich reddish loam bordered the river on each side.
These were occasionally broken by low, gently-rounded hills,
composed of the same soil. Freshwater lagoons, frequented by
wild-fowl, were found in several places; and during the course of
my walks, which extended for several miles in various directions,
I saw no termination to this good land except on approaching the
sea, where the salt marshes always commenced; but along the
southern bank of the river, to the point where its mouth actually
disembogued into the open bay, the land was of a fertile
description: the country, even in the dry season, during which we
were there, being covered with rich grass.</p>

<p>I ought here to state that this river is the most southern one
that I have ascertained to be deficient in that universal
characteristic of all those in the south-west of this continent:
an estuary. I must observe that I have not seen the mouths of
three or four of the rivers before enumerated, and cannot
therefore say that some of them may not terminate in estuaries;
but the Gascoyne discharges its waters by two mouths of
considerable magnitude, between which lies Babbage Island, the
southern mouth being in latitude 24 degrees 57 minutes.</p>

<p>This is also the most southern river on the western side of
this continent where the rise and fall of tide is sufficiently
great to exercise any influence upon it relatively to the
purposes of navigation. Hence it would appear that the presence
of estuaries at the mouths of rivers on this coast is in some way
connected with the amount of tidal elevation at the points where
they are found. The rise and fall here was about five and a half
feet; but there is only one full tide in twenty-four hours. The
first tide rises to a certain point, and it has scarcely
commenced to ebb, ere the second comes slowly in, so that, to a
careless observer, only one tide is perceptible.</p>

<p>PROVINCE OF VICTORIA.</p>

<p>The province of Victoria is situated between the parallels of
27 degrees 30 minutes and 29 degrees 30 minutes south latitude;
its most considerable river is the Hutt, which disembogues into a
large estuary. A few miles above the estuary the river separates
into two branches, both of which were running strong at the time
we passed them.</p>

<p>Previously to our reaching the Hutt our boats had all been
wrecked; I had therefore no opportunity of examining whether the
estuary of this river was navigable or not; from its size however
I should be inclined to the affirmative. The other principal
streams which drain this district are the Buller, and the
Murchison.</p>

<p>One remarkable feature in the province of Victoria is that the
carboniferous series is here developed throughout a tract of
Western Australia extending in latitude from the bottom of
Geographe Bay to near Cape Cuvier, and which I have carefully
examined. The tract above alluded to is the only one in which I
have yet found the rocks belonging to this series: this
circumstance therefore imparts a very high degree of interest to
the district in question.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks after my return from the province of
Victoria applications from settlers were made to the Government
of Western Australia to permit them to occupy a district which
had been so highly spoken of; this application was however
unsuccessful, but an expedition was subsequently sent there to
ascertain if there was a navigable entrance to the Hutt River. In
this object the expedition was unsuccessful, but the vessel
touched at the Abrolhos Islands and at some parts of the adjacent
coast, including Port Grey.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. See above. [The coast to the eastward of
the Abrolhos has been since examined by H.M.'s surveying vessel
the Beagle, Captain Wickham, R.N., and while these sheets were
passing through the press an account of the survey of Port Grey,
under the appellation of Champion Bay, appeared in the Nautical
Magazine for July 1841 page 443, from which periodical it has
been copied into Appendix B at the end of this volume.

<p>MR. MOORE'S JOURNAL. MR. MOORE'S VOYAGE TO HOUTMAN'S ABROLHOS
AND PORT GREY.</p>

<p>An account of some of the places visited was subsequently
published in the Perth Gazette, being contained in extracts from
the journal of G.F. Moore, Esquire, the Queen's Advocate at
Perth, who sailed with the expedition; and as Mr. Moore's
description contains several points of novelty and interest these
extracts are again transcribed below.</p>

<p>EXPEDITION TO THE NORTHWARD.</p>

<p>After Captain Grey had the misfortune to have his boats
wrecked in Gantheaume Bay, having started thence with his party
and walked to Perth, he reported that he had passed over
extensive tracts of fertile country in the neighbourhood of
Moresby's Flat-topped Range, where there are several rivers, one
of which (the largest) he had called the Hutt River, after His
Excellency the Governor. His Excellency having directed the
Champion schooner to proceed to explore the coast with a view to
ascertain whether there was any practicable entrance to the
river, and whether there was any harbour, shelter, or anchorage
in that neighbourhood, also what sort of anchorage there was
about the Houtman's Abrolhos, it appeared very desirable that
such an opportunity should be taken advantage of to obtain, at
the same time, as much information as circumstances would permit
as to the nature and quality of the soil and its general
capabilities with reference to its eligibility as a district to
be occupied by settlers. With this view G.F. Moore, Esquire,
embarked on the trip.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE ABROLHOS ISLANDS.</p>

<p>The Abrolhos. Latitude by a good sight on shore, 288 degrees
45 minutes, subsequently corrected to 288 degrees 40 minutes.</p>

<p>That part of the Abrolhos where we anchored seems to consist
of a number of small islets, perhaps 10 or 12, lying something in
the form of an irregularly shaped horse's shoe, extending for a
space of perhaps 20 miles in a north and south direction.</p>

<p>These islets, which are raised only from 10 to 12 feet above
the level of the sea, are a mere mass of coral and shells with a
very small variety of plants struggling to establish themselves
upon some of them. I was rather surprised to find a few plants of
the common groundsel on one of the barest. It is not improbable
that these islets are upon the outer rim of the crater of a
volcano, and that not only the entire outer rim, but also a large
space, both interior and exterior, will eventually be elevated.
Nothing can exceed the beauty of the different sorts of coral as
seen under the clear smooth water. We broke of many specimens of
the branch- or tree-coral, which seemed to be in full vigour of
life and activity. These islets appear to be a favourite resort
of seals, many of which we saw, but of the sort called
hair-seals. The sailors knocked many of them upon the head with
clubs as they lay sleeping on the shores. One of these afforded
much sport, though rather of a barbarous sort if one had taken
time to think at all on the subject. Sleeping on the brink of a
small lagoon in the interior of one of these islands, he was
roused by the approaching footsteps of his enemy. Seeing the man
close to him, with upraised club over his head, he dropped into
the water. This was so shallow as not to protect him from the
stones that were hurled at him from all sides, and so small that
he was completely surrounded. Finding his retreat cut off he
boldly stood up and seemed deliberately to scan the most
practicable mode of breaking his way through us all, but he was
so incessantly plied with stones as entirely to distract him.
When a well-aimed blow struck him he wreaked his vengeance on the
stone, and, diving after it to the bottom, gnashed upon it with
his teeth. At last a gun was brought by one of the party and a
well-directed shot under the ear laid him dead. Rock oysters of a
large size and delicious flavour were found in great abundance.
Range of thermometer 67 to 82 degrees.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 12th continued to explore the several islands;
unable to land upon the first we approached on account of a reef
which ran all round it. This was one which lay at the north-east
extremity of the Horseshoe. It was high and sandy, but with some
vegetation on the surface, and we saw many large seals sleeping
on the sandy beach. After this, visited five or six in
succession, all of the same formation, some being mere masses of
loose coral and dead shells.</p>

<p>SINGULAR CORAL FORMATIONS.</p>

<p>In passing from island to island we had many opportunities of
observing the different formation and shape of several species of
coral; some stood in masses of the brain-stone and cockscomb
coral, some like petrified sponge, some like fans, some again of
the branch-coral interlaced and intertwined in every direction;
again, some broad flat masses lying layer over layer, like huge
sea-lichens, again many presented the appearance of a fungus or
great sea-mushroom, with a broad-spreading head springing from a
small thick base. It is not a little singular that many of the
growing islets which are nearly level with the surface of the
water have a similar form, not rising from the bottom with a
perpendicular side, but with broad overhanging heads resting upon
a small base. In many places we passed over some of these
isolated sea-mushrooms, upon which there was barely water for a
small boat, where one step over the ledge would be in the deep
sea, and you might see the hollows underneath as if looking under
an umbrella. Birds were abundant on most of the isles, and on two
of them were hawks' nests, raised to the height of four feet by
an accumulation of sticks, stones, and shells. This day there was
but little breeze; the thermometer ranged from 76 to 86
degrees.</p>

<p>COAST UNDER THE MENAI HILLS.</p>

<p>Saturday morning January 25.</p>

<p>Stood in close along the shore opposite to the Table Hill and
the Menai Hills, and examined the coast from the rigging. There
are two openings of rivers laid down in the chart, that to the
south being the larger, and both nearly abreast of Table Hill and
only a few miles distant from one another; and besides these
Captain Grey had marked down in another chart a considerable
river, with a large estuary, close to the north of the Menai
Hills, which he had called the Hutt River. As we were just on
that part of the coast where all these are laid down we were the
more anxious and eager. We saw three openings on the west range,
but in truth very small, and after anchoring nearly opposite to
the northern one we went in the boat directly for it. There was a
continuous sandy beach the whole way across it, and the surf was
running high, so that it was not very easy to land.</p>

<p>LAND ON THE COAST.</p>

<p>Just as we were considering about how to effect a landing we
observed a number of natives on the hills and behind the beach,
evidently watching our motions. As we stood along the beach,
looking for a landing-place, they followed and became more bold;
they shouted and made gestures, which were certainly not like
those of encouragement; but still as we pulled on, they followed,
till we counted forty-nine men, but they appeared to have left
their spears behind them. Finding this, we thought it well to
parley with them, when we backed in close to the shore, holding
up our hands making signs of peace, and calling out in the Swan
River language that we were friends and would give them bread. I
flung apiece of biscuit on the beach, and some waded into the
water and threw in their fur belts and other ornaments, when we
commenced a system of barter immediately. They had no spears and
few throwing sticks; nor had they with them either cloaks, or
hammers, or shields, or any other weapon that we could see. They
seemed to like the bread very much, for they followed us for many
miles, still making signs to land, but the surf was so high we
could not venture in the face of so many of them. At last, having
passed the opening of the second river, and having come to a
smooth place, I jumped out upon the beach and was soon followed
by the Captain.</p>

<p>INTERVIEW WITH NATIVES.</p>

<p>They evinced a considerable deal of uneasiness at first, and
looked with much jealousy at the gun as something suspicious.
They wished me to part with it, but I sat down and intimated that
I would keep it on the ground beside me. I addressed them in the
Swan River native language, and they spoke much in return, but I
must say that our language seemed to be mutually unintelligible.
At last, by watching their mode of intonation, and accommodating
myself to their dialect, I managed to succeed a little better. In
this way they understood my inquiries for water, and their answer
at last was precisely in the Swan River language, "Gaipbi jeral,"
(water to the north.) Their great anxiety at first seemed to be
to know whether we were women. In answer I pointed to our beards,
when they pulled their beards and said, "Nanya patta," by which
name I have heard it called at Swan River also. Then they pointed
to some young lads in the boat and asked were they women. No; I
said they were "golambiddy" (boys) which they seemed to
understand. I saw them eating the fruit of the mesembryanthemum
(the Hottentot fig) but they did not understand either of the
names used for it at Swan River, golboys, or mejaruk. They called
it by a different name. After a little they volunteered to take
us to water, and we walked along the beach with them, clustering
about us with a show of friendship that was even more familiar
than agreeable. One of them repeatedly asked me were we dead? at
least so I understood him. At length we approached the opening of
the river, in which they indicated the water to be, but how were
our great hopes disappointed when they led us to a little hole
scraped in the bed of the river containing about a pint of water.
We afterwards saw several other holes of the same sort with more
or less water in them; and it will be well to bear in mind that
some of these were not fifty yards from the beach, and it is
quite possible that if they were dug out a good supply of water
might be obtained.</p>

<p>ADVANCE INTO THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>They then wished us to go up the valley of the river with
them, but we ascended a high hill to the north side, being
desirous of getting a view and in hopes of seeing the large
estuary pencilled on the chart by Captain Grey. From this hill we
had an extensive view of all the country to the west and north of
the Menai Hills. The whole face of the country looked grassy, and
thinly sprinkled over with what may be acacias, probably the
mangart, or raspberry-jam-scented wood, as it had just that
appearance, and a kily which we had got from the natives in the
morning was made of that wood. But there was not even a drop of
water visible, nor any sign of a large river, though this is just
the position assigned to the Hutt River; but certainly it is
quite possible that nearer the source of these rivers there may
be larger reservoirs and more water, which may be to a great
degree absorbed before it reaches the sea, as we find this to be
the case with many of the rivers of this country. In the meantime
the natives seemed dissatisfied about our going on the hills, and
offended, and were very importunate with us to go down to the low
grounds in the valley. "Koa yeka" ("Come this way," as I
understood it) was their constant call; and when at last we did
consent, as we were going down the side of a steep, rocky
limestone hill, I could not help feeling that we were very much
in their power. Looking round suddenly upon one occasion I
observed a man making gestures with his feet at the head of the
Captain, as if showing to the rest how he could knock him down
easily. The man seemed uneasy at being detected, but I laughed it
off as a joke, which probably it was after all; but their manner
seemed to have changed considerably. When we arrived at the level
ground they became very urgent that we should "sit down in the
shade," "maloka nineka" (a Swan River man would say "malok
nginnow"). They caught hold of us and pulled us, and wanted very
much to get the guns from us. Thinking it most prudent to return
to the boat we turned with that intention, when they did
everything they could, short of using force, to prevent us. They
stood in our way, they caught us in their arms, they pushed us,
they tried to snatch or seize our guns, but we persisted steadily
and good-humouredly to make our way back towards the boat. One
old man wished me to approach the brink of the high ground
overlooking the bed of the river, but seeing that it was a
perpendicular precipice to which he was leading, or rather
pushing me, I suddenly clasped him with one arm and walked away
from it, at which the rest set up a shout of laughter. His
intentions may have been perfectly friendly but I certainly did
not feel confident that they were so. I intimated that when we
got to the boat we should give them some more bread; and I felt
that the knowledge that the bread was in the boat was likely to
be very much in our favour and to contribute mainly to our
safety. My fear was that they had sent for their spears and
wished to detain us till they came. However we arrived at the
beach where the boat was standing outside of the surf waiting for
us.</p>

<p>RETURN TO THE VESSEL.</p>

<p>On our return to the ship I proposed that we should now touch
at the more northern river where we were deterred from landing by
their first appearance. We went therefore to the mouth of the
river, which is completely blocked up by sandhills, with two or
three small gaps through which water appeared to have made its
way at some time; but the entire of the bed of the river, which
was only a few yards wide, was covered with growing samphire.
There were two or three small pools of very salt water above
this, but no fresh water visible. We took a hasty view from a
high sandhill. The interior, where we could see anything of it,
looked grassy, and there was some grass even on the sandhills
near the beach; but our view was very limited and hurried. We had
no sooner returned to the boat than we saw a party coming along
the beach about a quarter of a mile away, and another party on
the top of the hill above, where we first saw them and where we
supposed their weapons to have been left. They shouted, we went
on board.</p>

<p>SAIL TO THE SOUTHWARD. PORT GREY.</p>

<p>Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Weighed anchor and stood to the south to examine a bay
opposite the southern part of Moresby's Flat-topped Range. This
bay, which is not laid down in the charts, was found to be an
excellent anchorage, completely sheltered from all southerly
winds, which are the prevailing winds on this coast at this time
of the year, and also much protected by a reef running north and
south from the extreme point of the bay. This reef or bank was
found to have from three to five fathoms upon it, and within it
there was seven fathoms, even near to the shore, at the bottom of
the bay; and there is no appearance of any heavy sea or violent
action of the water on the beach at any time of the year.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The report of this bay by the Master of
the Champion is as follows: 26th January 1840. Anchored in a bay
not laid down in the charts, lying in latitude 28 degrees 50
minutes, the north land bearing north-north-west, and the south
point south-west. A reef breaks off the point, the north part of
which bore west-south-west; but it extends far more to the north,
and breaks, I presume, in bad weather. The reefs extend also a
great way to the westward of this point. We anchored about half a
mile from the shore in seven fathoms water, and about three miles
from the head of the bay. The soundings are exceedingly even for
five miles, carrying seven fathoms, never varying: just before,
we carried four and five, when, I think, we passed over the reef,
which appears to me to join the main at that distance from the
south-west point. The beach does not show the least sign of any
sea. Found two posts stuck up in it. I consider this bay an
excellent anchorage during summer; and, I think, from the
appearance of the beach, it must be safe in winter.)</blockquote>

<p>SEA VIEW OF AUSTRALIND. APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>To the south of the tongue of land which forms the bay there
is also another bay, which would be completely sheltered from all
northerly winds so as to combine between the two bays perfect
shelter at all seasons of the year. From the deck of the schooner
where she lay we had a view of the entire slope of ground from
the beach to the top of the range, about five or six miles
distant. The range seems to consist of isolated hills rising from
an elevated plain. Judging by the eye at that distance, the
entire space as far as we had any opportunity of seeing, after
going a little way back from the coast, on the slope to the
hills, upon the hills, among the hills, beyond the hills, and, in
short, everywhere, as far as the eye could discern, appeared a
grassy country, thinly sprinkled with some low trees or shrubs,
perhaps the acacia. If this be the case, and that there be water
sufficient, of which there is no reason to doubt, this may
certainly turn out to be the finest district for sheep pasture
that this colony can possess. What may be the breadth of this
district, how far it may extend into the interior, of course
nothing can be known or said; but from what I have now seen, and
from what Captain Grey has seen on a former occasion, there is
little doubt that it extends north and south from the northern
part of the Menai Hills as far south as the River Arrowsmith, a
distance of more than 80 miles. To the south of that river comes
the range of hills which Captain Grey has called Gairdner's
Range, and which is supposed to be the northern termination of
the Darling Range; if so it is very probable that, by keeping on
the east side of the Darling Range a continuation of pastoral
country might be found all the way to Moresby's Flat-topped
Range. In coming to our anchorage this morning we passed the
opening of another river, that which is laid down in Captain
King's charts as the largest. From what we saw of it I do not
think that much water can issue from it either, although its bed
looked larger and better defined than any we had seen hitherto.
The man from the mast-head said he saw the sandy beach all across
it. But the Captain, being anxious to examine the anchorage in
the bay, did not wish to come to anchor sooner, so we passed on,
perhaps 10 or 12 miles to the south of it. Just as they were
about to let go the small anchor, which had been used since the
first was broken, it was discovered that it also was broken
nearly through, so we had to drop a large and heavy one, being
the only one now remaining in the ship. We then landed in the
boat, and saw two pieces of ship's timbers set up in the sand of
the beach, about half a mile from each other. Dug and examined
under and about the largest of them in hopes of finding some
directions, probably about fresh water, but found none. Examined
a place where the tea-tree and wattles were very green and
luxuriant looking; it appeared like a swamp in winter, but quite
dry now. Was struck by the singularity of some tea-trees growing,
of a large size, both up the sides and on the tops of high
sandhills, but which appeared to rest upon limestone. Got a view
to the east and south of the range. The country presented the
same appearance as before. It must be remarked that the grass was
all parched and withered and of a yellow straw colour; and it was
from this colour principally that we judged of its existence on
the distant grounds. Those who have once seen tracts of withered
grass will not readily mistake its appearance; but the green of
the shrubs was extremely vivid. One observation which we had
repeated occasion to make was the constant heavy dews which fell
at night on this coast, rendering everything about the ship quite
wet. The wind was off the land. The country all around seemed to
be on fire in the morning. The thermometer, as I stood on the
deck, was 94 degrees. In the evening the wind came round to the
north-west, and, desirous of availing ourselves of such a
favourable breeze, we got on board and set sail, but were obliged
to stand well out to sea to clear the reefs. Towards night it
fell calm again, and there was some lightning in the north.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH OF SWAN RIVER.</p>

<p>The third district lies immediately to the north of Perth. It
contains four rivers:</p>

<p>The Norcott,<br>
The Moore,<br>
The Smith,<br>
The Hill.</p>

<p>The Norcott and Moore Rivers, about fifty miles to the north
of Perth, were before known; and about twenty-five miles to the
north of Moore River is the Smith. The Hill comes out of
Gairdner's Range, the natural northern limit of this district,
which is connected with Perth by a chain of freshwater lakes, the
greatest distance between any two of them being not more than
from five to six miles. The whole of this district is therefore
fit for location, and affords a gratifying proof that the
flourishing colony of the Swan is by no means deficient in good
and immediately available land.</p>

<p>The circumstance also of this district being so abundantly
supplied with water, even at the end of an uncommonly dry season,
which was the period I traversed it in, much enhances its value.
It must, as the number of horned stock in the colony of Western
Australia increases, be the first occupied; for it is nearer to a
market than any other open to location, and affords both water
and food for cattle in good supply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7. VOYAGE HOMEWARDS.</h2>

<p>Before quitting the Mauritius, in August 1838, I had written
to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, reporting my
intention to proceed to the Swan River, and then, as
circumstances might guide me, either to return from thence at
once to the north-west coast, or, should that not be feasible, to
await further instructions from England; adding that, in the
latter event, I should attempt in the meantime to pass the range
to the north-east of the Swan, and endeavour to ascertain in what
direction the streams thrown off from this range towards the
interior might flow.</p>

<p>I have already stated the incidents that prevented me from
following out the first of these plans, as well as those which
led me to adopt the project of the voyage to Shark Bay in lieu of
an inland journey such as the second; and now that this last
expedition was brought to a close I had yet to await, for some
time, the answer to my communication from the Mauritius, which
was to guide my future proceedings. The interval between my
return to Perth and the period at which a reply might be expected
appeared too short to allow of my carrying out any comprehensive
plan of exploration, and I therefore resolved to employ it in
endeavouring to extend my knowledge of the native character and
language, as well as of the general position and prospects of the
colony.</p>

<p>At this time, the death of Sir Robert Spencer, the Government
Resident at King George's Sound, having caused a vacancy in that
appointment, I was induced, at the offer of Mr. Hutt, to assume
the temporary duties, with a two-fold desire of rendering what
public services I could during my unavoidable period of inaction
in the country, as well as of enlarging my opportunities of
observation on the aboriginal race.</p>

<p>In these occupations I remained, until the receipt of a reply
from the Secretary of State, which, after speaking in terms of
flattering approbation of my past exertions, notified that, for
the present, Her Majesty's Ministers did not think it desirable
that the researches in the north-west should be prosecuted
further.</p>

<p>PREPARE TO RETURN TO ENGLAND.</p>

<p>On the receipt of this I made preparations for returning to
England, but, no favourable opportunity offering from the western
settlements, as soon as I was relieved from my duties as
Resident, I embarked for South Australia in the hope of obtaining
from thence a more speedy passage than the other colony seemed
likely to afford.</p>

<p>After a short stay at Adelaide I finally sailed for England on
the 11th April 1840, and reached this country in September
following.</p>

<p>NATURAL HISTORY.</p>

<p>The leisure of the voyage afforded me the means of making some
additions to my former observations on the Natural History of the
seas we traversed, the chief results of which will be briefly
given in this chapter, together with some casual observations
which I was enabled to make on the Geology of St. Helena in
consequence of the vessel touching there.</p>

<p>June 2 1840. At sea: south latitude 20 degrees 0 minutes; east
longitude 58 degrees 47 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>I caught a species of shrimp (Penaeus) of a delicate prussian
blue colour, which was more brilliant at the extremities, and
gradually paled towards the centre of the animal. There was not
the slightest shade of any other colour about it, but it turned
pink in some places directly it was put into spirits; it had four
anterior and four posterior legs on each side.</p>

<p>Total length 1.45 inches.<br>
Length of apparatus on head 0.17 inches.<br>
Length of tail 0.25 inches.<br>
Head and connected apparatus 0.52 inches.<br>
Tail and body to commencement of first ring 0.48 inches.</p>

<p>June 13. South latitude 27 degrees 4 minutes; east longitude
47 degrees 38 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>A species of animal (Alima hyalina ?) was caught resembling a
scorpion, having six legs, three on each side; the first pair of
legs were provided with claws, like a lobster; its tail exactly
resembled that of a scorpion; the sac or bag near the extremity
of the tail was of a light red colour, and it tried to strike
with its tail, as if for the purpose of stinging. Eyes pale blue,
and prominent; body nearly diaphanous, with pale red spots.</p>

<p>Total length 0.33 inches.<br>
Length of body 0.20 inches.<br>
Breadth across from eye to eye 0.13 inches.<br>
Breadth of body 0.14 inches.</p>

<p>Several of the animals which I supposed to be the Velella of
Lamarck, and some of which had been caught on the 11th of
November 1837 were also found today. Caught also a species of
animal which I had found on October 22 1837, in south latitude 37
degrees 44; east longitude 38 minutes; and again on November 12
1837, in south latitude 30 degrees 11 minutes; east longitude 100
degrees 31 minutes 30 seconds. It resembles in shape and size a
large grape.</p>

<p>Extreme length 0.5 inches. Breadth 0.45 inches. Total
circumference round broadest part 1.30 inches.</p>

<p>Colour brownish blue; but there were round it twenty very
narrow brownish yellow stripes, equidistant from each other, and
not quite reaching either extremity of the animal.</p>

<p>June 16. South latitude 28 degrees 46 minutes; east longitude
42 degrees 3 minutes.</p>

<p>We caught an animal this afternoon somewhat resembling a
shrimp (Erichthus vitreus)* covered with a shield: we had caught
a similar one on the 12th of November 1837. From measurements
taken from the living animal the dimensions were:</p>

<p>Length from tip of tail to tip of spine, in front of head 1.15
inches.<br>
Ditto of spine 0.23 inches.<br>
Ditto from tip of tail to bottom of last scale 0.2 inches.<br>
Ditto from tip of spear to end of shield 0.7 inches.</p>

<p>The temperature of the water at 6 P.M. was 71 degrees
Fahrenheit; of the air 74 degrees.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. See Illustration 8 volume
1.)</blockquote>

<p>The shield was perfectly air-coloured and diaphanous, and
extended for some distance beyond the head and the upper parts of
the body; the body itself was of a pale delicate blue, and it
threw a very light bluish tinge upon the shield; the eyes were
jet black, and placed at the end of a tube like those of the
lobster; the tip of the spear was of a light red colour. Caught
also this day the lower portion of a species of Diphyes, the same
I had found on the 13th of November 1837 in south latitude 30
degrees 7; east longitude 100 degrees 50 minutes 10 seconds. The
total length of this was 0.5 inches.</p>

<p>Caught also two minute animals resembling a species of shrimp
(Penaeus); colour of both pale blue. The tail of the largest when
examined in a microscope precisely resembled in appearance the
fin of a fish. I did not examine the smaller one. Dimensions of
the largest:</p>

<p>Total length 0.2 inches.<br>
Length of feelers 0.15 inches.</p>

<p>Of smallest:</p>

<p>Total length 0.13 inches.</p>

<p>When put into eau-de-cologne these animals changed to a pink
colour.</p>

<p>June 17. South latitude 29 degrees 19 minutes; east longitude
40 degrees 19 minutes.</p>

<p><b>3. Glaucus, Sp.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Caught a specimen of Glaucus.</p>

<p>Total length 0.35 inches.</p>

<p>Colour down the back deep indigo blue; stomach bluish white;
sides bluish white (silvery) like a frog; tail tapering to a
point; its head resembled that of a frog, and when out of the
water it sat on its tentaculae, and raised its head and the fore
part of its body, moving its head (a) from side to side; the
tentaculae were all so delicate that they fell off, it had
apparently eight on each extremity; it belonged to the same
family as the animal I caught on the 14th of November 1837, in
south latitude 29 degrees 26 minutes; east longitude 101 degrees
32 minutes.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. See Illustration 10 volume
1.)</blockquote>

<p>June 23. South latitude 32 degrees 53 minutes; east longitude
29 degrees 45 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>We for the first time saw Cape Pigeons and the Albatross.</p>

<p>June 27. ) South latitude 35 degrees 41 minutes; east
longitude 25 degrees 13 minutes 20. June 28. ) South latitude 35
degrees 15 minutes; east longitude 23 degrees 26 minutes.</p>

<p>Upon these two days we were in a rapid current, which we
entered on the morning of the 27th, and on neither could we see
the slightest signs of any of the acalepha class; but on the
29th, on which day we experienced no current, we found the
greatest abundance of these animals; it appeared as if they had
collected in large quantities at the edges of the current; and on
the western side of it we found many animals which I had not seen
on the opposite one.</p>

<p>June 29. South latitude 35 degrees 31 minutes; east longitude
22 degrees 20 minutes 30 seconds.</p>

<p>The specimens caught were a minute fish, 0.35 inch in length;
colour, back and upper half of sides, deep indigo; belly and
lower half of sides, silver colour. Also two sorts of barnacles
(Anatifa) which I got near the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>We caught today a great number of the animals (Glaucus) I have
mentioned above as having been taken on the 17th of June, as well
as on other occasions. I observed these animals in the water, and
found that their long silk-like antennae had, when uninjured, a
length of five or six inches; they swim with the rounded part
first, and the long antennae trailing after them like tails; the
progressive motion is produced by introducing water into certain
sacs, or cavities, and expelling it by a contraction of the
muscles with great violence. I observed their motions from a boat
at first, and afterwards when they were in a glass of water. I
counted the number of times they expelled water in a given time
when swimming, and found the mean of several observations by a
chronometer to give ten strokes in twelve and a half seconds.</p>

<p>We caught again many little animals which I had found on the
15th of October 1837; south latitude 37 degrees 28 minutes, east
longitude 21 degrees 19 minutes; they were shaped like an
octagonal crystal, terminating in a point, containing a brilliant
blue colouring matter, they were about 0.4 inches in length, and
were, when undisturbed, arranged in long strings, only the length
of a single animal in thickness, and of the breadth of two of
them abreast; they swam with the blue-pointed ends downwards,
which then looked at a distance like the legs of a caterpillar,
and the long string somewhat resembled a long gelatinous band in
appearance as it passed through the water; but directly it was
touched the animals separated themselves from one another. These
strings were sometimes seen several feet in length.</p>

<p>We caught large quantities of these animals at one time, and
found:</p>

<p>The temperature of the water 65 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
The temperature of the air 75 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
The temperature of the animals 66 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>We caught also a fish (Orthogariscus) which the seamen called
a devil-fish.</p>

<p>The length of it was 6 feet 2 inches.<br>
Breadth from fin to fin 3 feet 6 inches.<br>
Length from tip of nose to pectoral fin 2 feet.<br>
Thickness through the breast 1 foot 6 inches.</p>

<p>This fish was infested about its nose with a kind of parasite
(Lernaea) having two long thin tails. The sailors stated that
these animals frequently cause large sores about the nose of the
fish, and that when suffering from this, it will allow the
sea-birds to sit on it, and peck away at the affected part. The
habit of the fish is to swim during calms with one of the hind
fins out of water, and it is then harpooned from a boat. I have
myself seen petrels perched upon them; and directly one of these
fish was hoisted on board the sailors looked for the parasites
and found them. Their dimensions were:</p>

<p>Total length 1.0 inch.<br>
Length of tails 0.57 inches.<br>
Ditto of fore part of body 0.25 inches.<br>
Ditto of hind part of body 0.15 inches.<br>
Breadth across body 0.25 inches.</p>

<p>They were covered with a transparent shell, marked with grey
spots and lines; the hind part of the body, near the tail, being
darker than the fore part, as though the intestines were seated
there. These little creatures adhered strongly to any substance
that they were laid on, and caused an irritating feeling to the
skin if placed on it; they swam with great rapidity when put into
seawater, and in their movements in swimming much resembled a
tadpole; their tails were merely long transparent fibres.</p>

<p>We caught also several transparent bodies, shaped like a
balloon (Beroe ?) These consisted merely of a sac. At the flat
end of the spheroid was a small ring of a pink colour, from which
ran lines forming the ribs, which supported the sides of the
animal. There were eight of these: they possessed great
irritability, and if the animal was at all injured, a rapid and
continued motion was propagated all along them. Some of these
animals were between two and three inches in length, but they
were so delicate that it was impossible to examine them, for they
fell to pieces directly they were touched. Only one of these ribs
was, at times, affected at the same moment, so that they appeared
each to be capable of an independent movement.</p>

<p>We caught also many small insects, and some shrimp-like
animals.</p>

<p>The sea was full of some things resembling hairs, but which
broke the moment they were touched.</p>

<p>On this evening we placed a large number of acalepha in a
bucket, and on agitating the water it became a mass of
phosphorescent light. It is strange that these animals should
never emit this light without being irritated.</p>

<p>July 1. South latitude 35 degrees 51 minutes; east longitude
18 degrees 56 minutes; average temperature of water, 65
degrees.</p>

<p>This day many specimens of different kinds were taken; and
amongst them a shellfish (Hyalea) the same as that caught on the
13th November 1837, in south latitude 30 degrees 7 minutes; east
longitude 100 degrees 50 minutes 10 seconds. This fish today put
out the apparatus with which it swam. It consisted of two broad
transparent wings, shaped like the first pair of wings of a
butterfly, and which it moved in a precisely similar manner. Its
shell was of a delicate pale transparent brown colour, with a jet
black spot in the centre. (See Illustration 6 volume 1 Figure 1.)
We also caught an animal of a precisely similar form and colour
with this, but which was not provided with a shell.</p>

<p>The other specimens were:</p>

<p>1. A shell (Janthina)* the same as was caught on November 14
1837, and on several other occasions, with its swimming apparatus
attached.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The corresponding figure, Illustration 9
volume 1, should have been inverted.)</blockquote>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-03a"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-03a.jpg"></p>

<p><b>3a. Janthina.</b></p>
</center>

<p>2. Several of the small shells which resemble belemnites
(Creseis) which were first taken on the 14th November 1837. I
this day preserved one of these with its swimming apparatus
expanded.</p>

<p>3. An animal without a shell, which had a sort of transparent
horny covering, and when alarmed and not in motion folded itself
up.</p>

<p>4. A tube 3.2 inches in length, perfectly transparent, and
swelling out to a little knob at each extremity; but these knobs
were of the same colour as the body.</p>

<p>5. Some delicate white shells (Atalanta) or very hard
gelatinous animals, 0.2 inches in length, 0.2 wide, and 0.15
thick; they had three ridges of short spines on them, one down
each edge, and one ridge running down the centre of the shell or
back.</p>

<p>6. Some perfectly spherical transparent bodies, 0.18 inches in
diameter; these neither moved nor showed any signs of life when
placed in salt water, but another animal, exactly resembling them
in shape and colour, with the exception of having some light
brown spots on it, unrolled itself like a wood-louse, and then
swam nimbly about. They all turned as white as eggs soon after
they were put into spirits.</p>

<p>We caught also several species of an animal with two
tentaculae, which had been also taken on the 17th June, some of
these were very large and beautiful, being of the most delicate
amber colour.</p>

<p>Also many different sorts of medusa, particularly tubes of
about 0.5 inches in length, with an apparatus shaped like a
proboscis at one extremity of it. These I have not attempted to
describe. In general the animals we caught this day differed
altogether from those we had hitherto found during this voyage.
Some few were the same, but the great majority were new.</p>

<p>Many of the medusae and small gelatinous animals must be
endowed with very acute sensibilities and perceptions, for they
evinced extreme timidity if any substance approached them, and
when plunged alive into spirits, their rapid movements and
violent contortions repeatedly indicated acute pain; indeed so
clearly that on this point there could be no mistake.</p>

<p>A mass of gelatinous animals, caught this day, gave out a
slight electric shock. Some of them were shaped like the portions
of an orange, and they evidently were formed to fit into one
another in the manner in which they were found, although they
separated directly they were touched.</p>

<p>July 2. South latitude 35 degrees 58 minutes; east longitude
17 degrees 54 minutes.</p>

<p>This day the ship went so fast that we could not catch
anything. The acalephae were not so numerous as they had been
further to the north, but we saw more and larger medusae than I
had ever before remarked. It indeed appeared as if the acalephae
diminished and the medusae increased in number after passing the
36th degree of south latitude.</p>

<p>July 12. ) South latitude 23 degrees 2 minutes; east longitude
0 degrees 26 minutes 45 seconds. July 13. ) South latitude 21
degrees 55 minutes; west longitude 0 degrees 44 minutes.</p>

<p>The vessel went slowly through the water, but although the net
was kept towing we could catch nothing, and there was no
appearance of anything being in the sea.</p>

<p>July 14. South latitude 20 degrees 52 minutes; west longitude
1 degree 49 minutes.</p>

<p>This day we caught a Velella of the following dimensions:</p>

<p>Length of interior cartilage 1.1 inches.<br>
Breadth of interior cartilage 0.5 inches.<br>
Total length of blue base 1.7 inches.<br>
Breadth of blue base 1.0 inches.<br>
Height of centre of crest 0.5 inches.<br>
Rim round crest, in breadth 0.55 inches.</p>

<p>This animal differed from those caught on the 11th November
1837, in the following particulars: It was much larger. The base
of the animal consisted of two parts. The centre portion was an
elliptically-formed cartilage, elevated in the centre, and marked
with eighteen concentric striae, which became thinner and thinner
as they approached the centre. No striae were visible on the
elevated crest with which the animal swims, but this crest was
furnished or fringed with a thin moveable flap, 0.55 inches in
breadth, which ran quite round it. The animal has the power of
flapping this to and fro constantly, as a fish does its tail.</p>

<p>The outer portion of the base was of a pale prussian blue
colour, increasing in depth of shade both to the outer and inner
edges. Many minute black spots were dotted all over this. The
underside of the outer base was of a very dark prussian blue
colour, and its lower interior edge was furnished with rows of
blue tentaculae, which the animal uses as an elephant does its
trunk. The whole interior surface of the oval cartilage is
furnished with successive rows of white tentaculae, and in the
centre is a long thin white tube, apparently its mouth.</p>

<p>These animals always swim in company. You see a number
together, varying from four or five to twenty or thirty; these
are all within a few feet of one another, and you may then pass
over several miles and not see any more.</p>

<p>They produce countless numbers of little eggs, of a pale brown
colour; these are apparently deposited from the interior white
tentaculae, and cannot be estimated they are so numerous.</p>

<p>We also caught a minute fish, 0.6 inches in length; a minute
species of nautilus, blue, marked with striae, or grooved, and
thus different from what we caught on the 15th; a shrimp-like
species of animal 0.5 inches in length; the lower part of a
species of Diphyes, which had been caught on the 12th and 13th of
November 1837; some minute animals, appearing to be the young of
the larger species of Velella which we had taken; they were, like
this animal, at first blue, but turned red soon after being put
into spirits; also a very minute pale blue species of nautilus, I
think the young of the kind we caught on the 15th July.</p>

<p>Caught a number of gelatinous animals, differing however
apparently in species from any we had found before. Some were of
the family of crystal-shaped animals with blue spots, so often
mentioned in this journal; also several animals of the family
figured June 17th, but which differed from them in the colour of
their spots. We caught today a Portuguese man of war (Physalis)
of a very different species from those which we had taken in the
Indian ocean. This one had a much larger sac, or float, than the
others, and the float was furnished with a crest.</p>

<p>July 15. South latitude 20 degrees 20 minutes; west longitude
2 degrees 17 minutes.</p>

<p>The same animals mentioned in the last paragraph of July 14th
were again caught this day. A great number of the Velella were
also taken.</p>

<p>Caught a small fish:</p>

<p>Length 1.2 inches.<br>
Breadth over roundest part 0.48 inches.</p>

<p>For a particular description, and figure of a finer specimen,
see below. The mouth and eyes of this fish were placed in a
curious manner. Its food appeared to be the same as that of the
other fish taken this day.</p>

<p>Caught two curious little crabs (Nautilograpsus) one pale
blue, and the other of a pale pink colour: also, another little
pale blue crab:</p>

<p>Length of antennae 0.15 inches.<br>
Length of body 0.34 inches.<br>
Breadth of ditto 0.12 inches.</p>

<p>Caught a small animal shaped like a wood-louse (Cymothoa)
having nine rings apparent on the back, and I think seven legs on
each side, also, a tail-like fin on each side, which, when closed
under its belly, formed a sort of shield for the lower part of
the abdomen. Antennae, transparent with pale brown tips, and a
few pale brown spots in them, colour pale blue down centre of the
back, dark prussian blue on each side. It had the power of
rolling itself up nearly double; in the same manner as a
wood-louse, but not quite so close; eyes distinct and prominent.
It lived a long time out of water, and appeared to me exactly
like an animal I caught on the 21st November 1837, in south
latitude 24 degrees 19 minutes; east longitude 107 degrees 8
minutes.</p>

<p>We also this day caught a Janthina. They have a little valve
for the purpose of taking in air, with which to expand their
float. These animals go in company. They emit when touched a
brilliant scarlet dye. A similar animal caught on the 20th
November 1837, in south latitude 25 degrees 12 minutes; east
longitude 106 degrees 49 minutes, emitted a violet-coloured dye.
The emission of this evidently depends upon their being
irritated, as I found by many experiments.</p>

<p>The method in which this animal fills its float is curious, it
throws it back, and gradually lifts the lip of the valve out of
water, until the valve stands vertical, it then closes the valve
tightly round a globule of air, around which it folds, by means
of the most complex and delicate machinery. The valve is then
bent over until it touches the edge of the float nearest the
head, and when it is in this position, the portion of it which is
inflated with air looks like a bladder, the air gradually is
expelled into the float, and as this process takes place the
bladder in the valve diminishes, and the valve becomes by degrees
like a lip pushed forwards until it lies flat on the float. The
valve is composed of two portions, a cup and a lip. The time
occupied from first removing the valve from the float, until the
inflation, and the expulsion of air into the float being
completed, so that the valve begins to move again, is 61 seconds,
from the mean of several experiments.</p>

<p>These animals have also the power of compressing the valve
into a hollow tube, which they elevate above the water like a
funnel, and draw down air through it.</p>

<p>The colouring matter which they emit has no stinging, electric
or deleterious properties whatever, that I could discover. I
found that when this colouring matter was mixed with water, it
became of a deep blue. In those which I caught in November 1837,
I may have been deceived, and the colouring matter might also
possibly have been scarlet directly it was emitted. It is
difficult to conceive what use this liquid can be to the fish
against its foes, yet it certainly uses it as a means of
defence.</p>

<p>To one of these shells, the fish in which was alive and well,
we found attached a number of barnacles, some of which were of
large size.</p>

<p>This sort of Janthina was very abundant; today we caught
eight, and saw great numbers of them: yesterday we caught a
smaller one of a different species. (Janthina exigua.)</p>

<p>This kind of Janthina is attached to its float by a sort of
peduncle, which it has the power of elongating, so that the fish
itself sinks, with its shell, and yet remains attached to the
float, which continues at the surface. In one instance, I saw
this peduncle elongated to a length of 0.9 inches. It may, of
course, have the power of sinking itself much lower than I have
seen it do. When it is in this state, the apparatus with which it
fills the float remains behind the peduncle in a state of perfect
quiescence.</p>

<p>The scarlet fluid emitted by this animal is of such a
consistency that it can be drawn away from it out of the water,
like a glutinous thread.</p>

<p>A part of the animal requires attention, it is composed of an
outer cup, or circular lip, which it has the power of contracting
or expanding in the same manner as the valve; and when opened out
like a cup, an orifice can be seen at the bottom of it. It can
also expand, and make broad the arm; and it then appears to use
them as sails.</p>

<p>This species of Janthina, I afterwards found, has the power of
in some manner taking in by suction a quantity of water, which it
can suddenly expel again with great violence, sending it out as
if from a squirt.</p>

<p>We caught, also, an extraordinary fish this day. Its mouth has
the appearance of being situated on its back; a fin, 0.4 inches
in length, projected directly out from one side of the fish, and
there was every appearance of a perfectly similar one having been
torn from the other side; a hard horny membrane projected from
underneath the stomach of the animal, being apparently a sort of
fin.</p>

<p>Its colour was of a silvery metallic lustre, having in parts a
burnished appearance, except where it is shaded (see Illustration
5 and below) and then it was of a dark green colour; the tail was
perfectly transparent, except just where it joined the body, and
there, where the shaded line is, it was dark green.</p>

<p>This fish was swimming about, apparently preying on the
tentaculae of the barnacles, of which there were numbers round
the ship attached to the dead Velella, some of which I had caught
yesterday; it appears therefore probable that its mouth was
placed in so extraordinary a position to enable it to seize this
pendant prey.</p>

<p>We caught this day a number of Velella, which are furnished
with crests; some of them were dead, and nearly always when such
was the case we found a species of barnacle attached in great
numbers to them. When these animals had only recently died, so
that the whole of their blue base had not been detached from
them, the barnacles were generally very minute, so that the naked
eye could only just detect them, and there were no large
barnacles on the same fish: now, how did the minute ones get
there? As the barnacles grew larger, the remains of the velella
changed into large excrescences, half the size of a walnut.</p>

<p>We caught also several little animals, all of the same
species, which swam about on the surface of the water with the
greatest rapidity, performing the same kind of evolutions that we
see in a little black and white insect (Gyrinus) which swims on
the top of tranquil pools in England.</p>

<p>July 16.</p>

<p>This day a curious animal was caught, perfectly diaphanous;
total length 0.8 inch; length of third leg, 0.4 inch; this was
provided with a claw like a crab; head shaped like a grasshopper,
0.2 inch in length, and placed like the head of a grasshopper, at
right angles to the body; eyes black and prominent, apparently
four, two on each side; first and second legs of nearly the same
length; the third leg nearly double the length of either of the
others; five on each side. The top of the head is divided into
two prominent knobs, one on each side, which, viewed through a
microscope, appear to be minutely reticulated.</p>

<p>The animal may be considered as consisting of four portions:
the head; the upper part of the body, 0.18 inch in length, and
divided into five rings; the lower part, consisting of one
shield-like portion, 0.12 inch in length, the body at the lower
portions of this decreases almost to the thickness of a thread;
the tail, 0.3 inch in length, and divided into three shield-like
pieces, laid one over the other as in the shrimp (imbricated); at
the lower extremity of each of these scales there is on each side
a fin-like leg, in addition to those above-mentioned. Breadth of
the animal across its head, 0.2 inch, and this was the broadest
part of it. It lived for some time out of water, and even when
put into spirits, it swam in an extraordinary manner, falling
head over heels every time, which motion it accomplished by
swimming on its back and making rapid strokes with the fin-like
legs with which it is provided behind.</p>

<p>We also caught today several little crabs and barnacles. I
kept one specimen, to show old and young barnacles attached to
the same Velella.</p>

<p>The sea was, this morning, covered in places with fleets of
the Velella of Lamarck; also with great numbers of the species of
Janthina which I described yesterday; to both of these kinds of
animals large clusters of barnacles were frequently attached.
These barnacles preyed on the different gelatinous animals which
were swimming about. It was curious to see them seize on these
with their hooked tentaculae and draw them in, whilst the
acalepha, or gelatinous animal, contracted and dilated itself
with all its might and main, endeavouring to escape. We saw two
or three times very large shoals of porpoises ahead of us, and
when we reached the spot where they had been we found the sea
quite cleared of the animals with which it was covered in other
places, so that we imagined the porpoises must have been feeding
on them. We saw also a whale and a shark today.</p>

<p>Although these little floating animals were so numerous there
were but very few of the gelatinous species to be seen, and they
were chiefly of the larger sorts. I saw one of the species
(Glaucus) of which I have given a sketch, on the 17th of June.
Like all the animals of this species which we caught to the
westward of the Cape it had a red intestinal spot in it; but
excepting in its great size it differed in no respect from the
others which I had seen: this one was at least a foot in
length.</p>

<p>A number of black minute animals were caught, which, at a
rapid glance, looked not unlike fleas with long feelers or
antennae.</p>

<p>We caught also this day an animal (Salpa) which consisted of a
gelatinous transparent bag, having an orifice provided with a
valve that opened and closed the orifice at pleasure; there was
no other opening to the sac that I could discover; I passed the
end of a pencil down it, but although it passed readily through
the valve it could not at first pass through the bottom of the
gelatinous sac; but I afterwards found that this was an error,
and that the pencil could be passed right through the body of the
animal, which was provided with a valve at each end. I found also
that the united animals had the power of swimming with either end
foremost. There was an intestinal tube in the animal of a dark
reddish brown colour. This animal appeared to exist very badly
alone, fourteen of them were always found united together by a
plane; they then formed a mass shaped like half an orange and
having a cup at its upper surface; the intestinal canals, when
they are in this position, are all brought near to one another,
and the whole mass looks not unlike a flower; they are united to
one another by so thick a fluid that it is very difficult to
separate them. If one or more are torn away from the mass the
outside ones immediately join together and form a united mass
again, of the original shape. They open the orifices at different
times: that is, two or three open theirs at the moment that some
of the others are closing, so that no regular or simultaneous
movement takes place between the different animals. This
irregular movement of the animals gives to the whole body an
irregular rotatory motion; but when one is separated from the
others it can only drive itself round and round upon its own
centre, and has not the faculty of propelling itself as the other
acalepha have. They also swim with either end foremost, in the
manner the other acalepha do.</p>

<p>We saw also some animals of this class, and nearly as large as
the ones I have just described, but they differed in their form
and mode of attachment, and joined themselves in long strings,
two deep, so as to look like gelatinous snakes. I have before
described animals of this class with blue spots. I think that a
good mode of classifying these animals would be from their form
of arrangement when united.</p>

<p>July 17. South latitude 19 degrees 47 minutes; west longitude
3 degrees 5 minutes 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Found a small animal (Cymothoa) like a wood-louse, similar to
the one we caught on the 15th of this month and to another taken
on the 21st of November 1837. It had seven legs on each side,
besides the five which when taken out of the water it folded over
its abdomen; the colour the same as before described.</p>

<p>Length 0.52 inch.<br>
Width over broadest part 0.2 inch.<br>
Length of antennae 0.2 inch.</p>

<p><b>4. Cymothoa, Sp.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Illustration 4, exactly the size of life, gives a good idea of
it. It lived out of the water for two or three hours and did not
die until put into spirits; it ran about on the table as well as
it swam in the water, so that it was evidently amphibious. It
swam about from a dead shell of the Velella, to a nautilus, and
from that again to some barnacles; each shell that it reached it
climbed up, and folding up its fins ran all over it, so that it
appeared like a little navigator which was roving from island to
island in the ocean, seeking food and nourishment from all of
them. Are not the ways of nature very wonderful? This little
animal was at least 500 miles from any land, as we term it, yet
it was surrounded by sunny islands, teeming for it with the most
delicious food, and where it either basked in the warm daylight,
or shaded itself in some oozy recess, as seemed most pleasant to
it.</p>

<p>When walking on these substances it used its antennae exactly
as insects do, and showed an extraordinary degree of
susceptibility when touched. I do not know that I have ever seen
an animal which more decidedly evinced an acute sense of feeling
and dread of pain.</p>

<p>The animal here described belongs equally to the Indian and
Atlantic Oceans, and appears, as far as my experience goes, never
to venture to the south of 25 degrees south latitude. This is now
the third species of animals which I have found to be common to
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and which never venture beyond
the warmer latitudes.</p>

<p>The question is how they got round the Cape of Good Hope, or
Cape Horn?</p>

<p>Might we not hence infer that there was a time when the
continent of Africa did not exist? and might not this argument be
much extended? It could be combated by none of those causes which
are advanced relative to the distribution of species on land;
for,</p>

<p>1. The temperature of the water in southern latitudes is very
cold at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>2. These animals are extremely susceptible of all changes of
temperature.</p>

<p>3. They have no means of warming themselves by exercise or
motion.</p>

<p>4. The species of food which they subsist on is confined to
the latitudes in which they themselves live.</p>

<p>5. They would have to traverse great distances in ungenial
climes, and contend against adverse winds, the children of placid
seas and genial suns hurried into giant waves and chilling
storms.</p>

<p>6. It is not probable that they are swept along in currents,
from the circumstance that in the one which flows along the coast
to the eastward of the Cape we could find none of them, whilst
upon its very edge they were in abundance.</p>

<p>Could however their eggs be swept along by a current, and
after having been wave-tossed for months or years, be at last
borne into waters sufficiently warm to hatch them, and the
animals, finding themselves in a genial climate, have increased
and multiplied?</p>

<p>The numerous little animals of the species which I have always
considered to be the Velella of Lamarck went sailing merrily by
us today; the least breath of wind made them turn round and
round; and this was their mode of progression, the animal moved
its little sail which I have before mentioned, and worked its
tentaculae so vigorously as to make ripples in the water, in the
midst of which it went buoyantly floating along.</p>

<p>Caught another fish (Stenopteryx Illustration 5) of the same
species as that found on the 15th of July. The accompanying
figure is drawn from minute measurements. The length of this
specimen was 2.5 inches, its thickness through the thickest part
0.38.</p>

<p>What I had before imagined to be either a spine or fin turned
out to be a pectoral fin.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-05"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-05.jpg"></p>

<p><b>5. Stenopteryx, Sp.</b></p>
</center>

<p>It thus has two pectoral, one dorsal, and one ventral fin,
properly speaking; but the greater part of the body is surrounded
by some cartilaginous substance which it probably uses as a fin;
under the line b c there is a curved portion of this matter, and
above and attached to the fish is a line of round white silvery
scales, about ten in number.</p>

<p>Between a and b there is another curved mass of transparent
cartilaginous substance, along the bottom of which runs a spine
to which is attached a fringe-like fin. There is a spine upon the
back; the eye is very prominent and bright; upon the back,
between the eye and the spine, there are successive stripes of
purple and burnished gold, so that this little animal is one of
the most gorgeously coloured denizens of the ocean. It swims
about amongst the purple barnacles and pink nautili, seeking on
the shores of these shining islands its prey, the curious
formation of its mouth being admirably adapted to enable it,
whilst swimming under these painted floating islands, to crop off
what it lists.</p>

<p>There were scarcely any gelatinous animals in the sea this
day; but many Janthina shells and Velella were round the ship, to
which were attached barnacles of different species; amongst this
group of islands numerous crabs were swimming about and running
over them. Animals resembling a wood-louse were also in the sea,
swimming and running about the floating shells and barnacles.</p>

<p>We caught also a new species of Janthina, the float of which,
instead of being nearly round and extending over the shell on
each side, was spread like a spiral fold from the shell; the
breadth of this fold was 0.45 inch, close to the mouth of the
shell, and it gradually tapered off to a point, its length being
3.6 inches. This float being curved round like the tail of an
animal, the whole thing bore the appearance of being a sort of
snake, of which the shell was the head; the sailors called them
caterpillars before I had examined them. The float was composed
of two parts, one of which was only froth and the other was
apparently some extraneous substance attached to the froth. The
shell is very different from those of the other nautili in being
much more deeply indented with circular striae.</p>

<p>July 18. South latitude 19 degrees 49 minutes; west longitude
3 degrees 10 minutes 15 seconds.</p>

<p>We have lately caught several specimens of Creseis. Each
consists of a cylindrical tube, increasing in size from its
broadest extremity to the centre where it is thickest, and
decreasing from the centre to its other extremity, where it
becomes a fine point. It is throughout its extent gelatinous,
transparent, and of strong consistency.</p>

<p>There is apparently a valve at its broadest extremity.</p>

<p>Length 1.1 inch.<br>
Breadth in centre 0.1 inch.<br>
Breadth at mouth of wide extremity 0.08 inch.</p>

<p>We have several times caught a triangular, transparent,
gelatinous animal; it is 0.18 inch in thickness, and in the outer
pulpy gelatinous mass there is an interior sac, and strong
muscular bands are marked across this. The sac is composed of
three lobes, two of which have apparently no external opening,
whilst at the end of the main lobe there is one which closes with
a valve; through this I have seen them take in little animals,
which reached no farther than the centre, from which the lobes
radiate, when the sac became violently agitated, and made strong
efforts to expel the foreign substance. This animal was very
sensitive, more particularly about the opening of the
entrance.</p>

<p>We caught today the lower part of the species of Diphyes which
we had found on the 13th November 1837, in 30 degrees 7 minutes
south latitude, in the Indian Ocean. This animal is thus
distributed over a wide range.</p>

<p>We also found a very minute species of the animal similar to
one which we caught on July 1st 1840. Those we caught today were
scarcely 0.05 inches in diameter. They unfolded little wings and
flew with them in precisely the way those did which I described
on that day.</p>

<p>Nothing I have seen is more remarkable than the flight of
these little animals; their wings are milk white and very large
for their body, and as they fly, the ends, from their pliancy,
bend over, which imparts to the motion a very graceful
appearance; these wings are composed of a very fine membrane like
that forming the wings of a bat. At one time these little animals
hovered over a single spot like a bird of prey in the air,
flapping their wings in just the same manner. At another time
they darted forward with great rapidity, and the vibration of
their wings was so rapid that I could not count them. When folded
up they look like very minute gelatinous animals with a black
internal spot, but when touched their shell can be felt. We saw a
shoal of whales today.</p>

<p>We have caught lately a great many small animals, of which the
following is the description; they swim about from one floating
substance to another and are eaten by the little crabs which are
numerous in these seas.</p>

<p>Length of body 0.18 inch.<br>
Length of anterior part of body 0.1 inch.<br>
Length of posterior part of body 0.08 inch.<br>
Length of tail 0.08 inch.<br>
Breadth across back 0.05 inch.<br>
Depth from back to bottom of breast 0.06 inch.<br>
</p>

<p>Head and eyes, deep brilliant prussian blue; body brilliant
prussian blue with a bluish green stripe on each side; tail
white. Seen through a microscope these animals appear to be a
beautiful dark burnished blue mottled with silver. The head is
remarkably round and regular.</p>

<p>The body is divided into two portions. The anterior portion is
made up of six rings or shields, which lap over one another, and
it is furnished with three legs on each side which terminate in a
hooked claw; the posterior part is covered by three shields, and
there was only one leg on each side. I could not make out any
tentaculae or antennae.</p>

<p>I was much struck by a curious circumstance today. As we
caught a great many gelatinous animals I thought this a good
opportunity of taking their temperature, which, after an
observation so carefully made that no error could occur, was
found to be 66 degrees 5 Fahrenheit, the temperature of the air
at the same time being 74 degrees. The temperature of the water
was now taken and was found to be 2 degrees 5 minutes more than
that of the animals; thus giving these animals a temperature
lower than that of the fluid in which they were immersed. I
conceived that some error must have been made in the temperature
of the water, it was therefore taken again and found to be 69
degrees as before; this appeared to me so remarkable that I drew
up a table of all the experiments which had been made on this
subject, the result of which is that the mean temperature of
these kinds of animals appears to be 64 degrees 9 minutes
Fahrenheit; and that the greatest variation in excess is 1 degree
7 minutes; and in defect 2 degrees 9 minutes Fahrenheit. Is it
possible, then, that an animal can live in a fluid, the
temperature of which is constantly varying, and preserve nearly a
mean heat?</p>

<p>In the following tables I have entered every experiment but
one which was made on the 17th of June, and in which I believe
the animals to have been kept too long out of water.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-31"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-31.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>This last experiment was made from a sickly specimen which had
been kept for some time in the water: the temperature of water
above given is for that in which this animal was kept.</p>

<p>We caught again today many animals of the same family
(Glaucus) as those of which a description is given in the journal
for the 17th of June.</p>

<p>Also many shrimp-like animals (Alima) the bodies of which were
divided distinctly into an interior and posterior portion; all
the shrimp-like animals which we have caught whose bodies are
thus divided swim by doubling up the posterior part close to the
anterior, and then giving a stroke with great rapidity outwards.
These little animals are very susceptible, and when they have
been in the least injured their limbs remain in so constant a
state of tremor that the motion communicated by them resembles
that which would be caused by the passage of a rapid succession
of electric shocks, rather than any other I am acquainted
with.</p>

<p>GEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT ST. HELENA.</p>

<p>July 21.</p>

<p>After visiting Longwood and Napoleon's tomb we rode to
Flagstaff Hill to search for fossil shells. The whole soil that I
saw was composed of decomposed old volcanic rocks; but I saw no
rock but basalt in different stages of decomposition; sometimes
it assumed the form of porphyry. I also saw veins of quartz,
gypsum, and jasper. On a part of Flagstaff Hill there was a thin
stratum of calcareous earth, in which shells are found. My hip
was so painful that I could not climb to the point where these
were, but an artillery soldier ascended and brought down some,
and of these I had several specimens given me; they are found
associated with bones which are apparently those of birds. None
of these bones were given to me but I saw and examined several
specimens. The shells are very numerous at this point.</p>

<p>On returning into town I found several specimens of dead land
shells, apparently recent; these lay on the sides of the hills,
partly buried in the soil, and bore the appearance of having been
washed into this position by the heavy rains.</p>

<p>July 22.</p>

<p>Rode over in the morning to Longwood, and then proceeded to
Gregory's Valley, lying between Longwood and The Barn. This
valley, nearly 1700 feet in depth, appears at one period to have
been the scene of great volcanic disturbances. The lowest rock I
saw was a compact porphyritic one. The upper strata of basalt
were in a state of rapid decomposition; but the whole of the
valley was traversed by basaltic dykes in every direction; these
crossed one another in such a way that it was easy to tell their
relative ages; for instance several of them were in the form
of:</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-06"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-06.jpg"></p>

<p><b>6. Form of basaltic dykes at Gregory's Valley, St.
Helena.</b></p>
</center>

<p>So that one had been forced from its position by another long
subsequently to its formation.</p>

<p>The general form of Gregory's Valley is a large basin bounded
by a lofty precipitous mountain on one side called The Barn, and
having a very narrow opening seaward, through which a small
stream has cut its way. A remarkable circumstance connected with
the basaltic dykes is that they are composed of a more compact
basaltic rock than the basalt which they penetrate, so that
whilst the rock has mouldered away these basaltic dykes have
remained standing; and, as in the progress of their decay they
split up, they present the appearances of walls built by human
hands, with regular layers of stones, and which traverse the
ravines of the island in all directions.</p>

<p>As might be expected, I found regular basaltic crystals in
this valley, and also a variety of quartz ore, and other
crystals, in the veins traversing the basalt. I also found the
following remarkable section:</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-07"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-07.jpg"></p>

<p><b>7. Geological Section from Gregory's Valley, St.
Helena.</b></p>
</center>

<p>This was in a side valley or ravine leading from Gregory's
Valley in a southerly direction.</p>

<p>On going down to the sea I found many species of starfish. I
brought away three species of these with me. Two Species
Pentagonal; one species Quadrilateral.</p>

<p>First species Pentagonal length of side 0.55 inch.<br>
Second species Pentagonal length of side 0.50 inch.<br>
Quadrilateral length of side 0.55 inch.</p>

<p>I found a sort of worm in the coral which had the power of
extending its head like an English worm; its body then appeared
to be composed of two portions, the fore part being much slighter
than the other. Its dimensions were:</p>

<p>Length of fore part of body 0.4 inch.<br>
Length of hind part 0.6 inch.<br>
Breadth, or diameter of cylinder 0.1 inch.</p>

<p>In the coral there was also another insect, not unlike a
centipede.</p>

<p>Length 0.9 inch.<br>
Breadth at head 0.08 inch.</p>

<p>In the inmost recesses of the coral there was a minute bivalve
shell and also a very minute species of crab.</p>

<p>One remarkable circumstance relating to St. Helena is that it
is of a basaltic formation exactly resembling that of the Isle of
France and the North-west of New Holland; and that, although so
widely separated in longitude, these places lie in nearly the
same latitude.</p>

<p>When you quit the sandstone ranges of the North-west of
Australia reptiles which have been before very numerous at once
become scarce. I never saw a snake in this great basaltic
district although there were plenty in the sandstone. This
however is only negative evidence. Brookes, in his History of St.
Helena (second edition page 24) says: "There are neither frogs,
toads, nor snakes in the island." In the Isle of Bourbon there
are neither toads nor snakes. In the Mauritius likewise there are
neither toads nor snakes, and only one species of frog, whilst
the bones of the land tortoise (Testudo indica) are only found in
a fossil state. Also, the highest land in St. Helena is 2800
feet; in the Mauritius about 2900 feet (scarcely); and in the
volcanic district of North-west Australia about the same
height.</p>

<p>July 26. At sea.</p>

<p>We caught a great variety of shrimp-like animals; these little
things when disturbed emitted a brilliant phosphorescent light.
We saw scarcely any gelatinous animals.</p>

<p>July 29.</p>

<p>Caught two small crabs (Nautilograpsus); these species have
the power of swimming by means of the fringe-like fins with which
their legs are provided. Several other crabs were also caught;
some with their eggs attached, and two varieties of shrimp-like
animals with eggs. Where these were abundant the sea was very
luminous. Four or five of these were of a brilliant prussian blue
colour, with silver-coloured spots on the back; others were of a
very delicate pink colour; the tentaculae of both of them were of
a delicate prussian blue colour.</p>

<p>We also caught a species of small Janthina, nearly resembling
those we had found before, but they were larger; moreover the
species of barnacle attached to them was totally different from
any we had before found, as if each species of nautilus had its
own kind of parasite. This is worthy of attention.</p>

<p>August 8.</p>

<p>We found a species of Halobates which swam rapidly with the
short legs foremost, and the foremost legs appeared to be
furnished with a fringe to give them that power. The colour of
the legs, dark prussian blue; body of a silver colour in front,
with a prussian blue colour behind; under part of the body, near
the tail, three consecutive striae of a silver colour, separated
from one another by a line of prussian blue. I have never seen
this animal before.</p>

<p>August 9.</p>

<p>Caught two or three small insects, somewhat resembling a bug,
of a dirty brick colour and several minute species of Diphyes and
small jellyfish.</p>

<p>August 19.</p>

<p>Caught a small Janthina nearly resembling those we had
formerly seen, also a small crab, two new species of gelatinous
animals, and a Velella.</p>

<p>August 20.</p>

<p>Several fish, resembling an eel in shape, were caught today;
they were of different sizes, and some of them gave a slight
shock on being touched. They were marked across the back with
alternate striae of silver, and various shades of brown and
black, though there were scarce two marked exactly alike. They
had a transparent dorsal and two pectoral fins, which were all I
observed, and a long thin snout or beak; the mouth was just at
the end of it, on the top: some of them were thorny on the back;
we caught also some crabs; a very minute blue fish; a black and
red insect resembling a flea; a species of Diphyes; a very small
kind of polypus; and one or two small jellyfish. A land bird flew
on board today.</p>

<p>In 26 degrees north latitude we entered a portion of the sea
covered with patches of seaweed, around which swarmed numerous
eel-like fish, crabs, shrimps, and little blue fish; these last
swam under those floating islands, sometimes leaving them for a
little distance, but they always returned or swam to another: the
crabs crawled in and out amongst the seaweed, and other fish of a
large size came to these spots to deposit their spawn, so that we
were in an archipelago of floating islands teeming with busy
inhabitants and animal enjoyment.</p>

<p>August 21.</p>

<p>There were a great many crabs of different kinds and sizes
caught today; two kinds of shrimps, one marked across with
alternate striae of silver and dark brown; it had no antennae,
and had apparently been hurt, as I could only see some very short
legs; the rest appeared to be of the same kind as others recently
caught, except being of a lighter colour. Some eel-fish of the
same kind as yesterday. There were two other small blue insects
caught; unfortunately none have been preserved as they were put
in the same glass with the shrimps and were instantly eaten by
them. The crabs also ate two small blue fish that were caught. No
jellyfish were seen.</p>

<p>August 24.</p>

<p>Some of the eel-like fish, two or three shrimps, a new species
of dypha, various kinds of crabs, and a large species of
Physalis, were caught today.</p>

<p>August 25.</p>

<p>Caught various kinds of crabs, some minute shells, and a small
curious insect, quite new to me, of a bright blue colour; the
shrimps appear to be very fond of these insects, seizing them the
instant they are put into the glass with them. We caught shrimps
of all colours and sizes, many of them very beautiful; some were
of a pale gold colour with bright blue spots; others with
different shades of brown, and blue, white, or red spots. They
all turned a dark red on being put into spirits. The smaller
kinds had a round ball or excrescence on one side just below the
head. I observed today that the eel-fish carries its eggs in a
bag under the belly; the eggs were of a bright red colour. Two
barnacles were caught; also a new and very remarkable fish.</p>

<p>August 28.</p>

<p>Caught today two of the fish of the same kind as the one taken
on the 25th. It had a dorsal fin with 14 spines; a ventral fin; a
tail, 16 spines; and in addition to these it had four pectoral
fins resembling the claws of a frog, which it used much in the
same manner that a lizard uses its claws. The upper pair of these
were divided into two joints, the lower one of which was a
perfect hand, terminating in ten claws, with which it could seize
hold of any object, or expand and use it as a broad paddle, or
fin. At the point where these arms are inserted into the body and
immediately behind them are placed two tubes, one behind each
arm. These form its gills, through which it expels the water
taken in at its mouth; the lower pair of arms have only one
apparent joint, and each of these hands are furnished with five
claws; it has two protuberances which look like horns, one
projects immediately between the eyes, and the other is situated
between this and the dorsal fin, these are covered with little
spines and it carries them erect. Its colour is pale yellow with
brown spots and stripes on it; the spots about the head and upper
arms are much darker than the others; about the stomach are
little things resembling the wattles of the wattle-bird, they are
of a brilliant white colour. It feeds on small shrimps, climbs
about the weeds like a lizard, and at times swims like a fish and
is very rapid and strong in its motions. It swells out the
membranes about the spot where its gills ought to be, so as to
puff itself out like a toad when it takes water in: its colour
resembles that of the common English frog, and it looks
remarkably like one when it sits on a piece of weed, resting on
its claws and puffing out its cheeks. There are several lines of
red stripes at the bottom of its stomach.</p>

<p>We caught also a great many shrimps and crabs; some of the
shrimps were boiled and proved to be very good eating.</p>

<p>August 30.</p>

<p>At 5 hours 30 minutes P.M. a pine tree passed us, covered with
barnacles and surrounded by fish, which swam about this floating
island, eating such things as fell from it.</p>

<p>No portion of the globe is more thickly inhabited, or affords,
in proportion to its size, a greater amount of animal enjoyment
than did this wave-tossed isle. On it were innumerable barnacles,
several species of teredo, one of which, having its head shaped
like a screw split into two equal portions, I believe to have
been quite new. Many varieties of crab and minute insects shaped
like a slug fed on the seaweed growing on the log.</p>

<p>These last animals were of different lengths. They were shaped
like a caterpillar and composed of fifty-six rings; the stomach
could only be distinguished from the back by a sort of
excrescence which grew on the latter; each ring or division of
the body was furnished with two pairs of legs, one pair pointing
downwards from the stomach, the other pair projecting from the
back; these legs were composed of bristles, and by sticking them
into the timber they were able to maintain their hold and to walk
along. In thus progressing they drew into a case the legs of the
rings they were going to move, and pushed them forward by means
of the other legs, and then, letting down the legs they had drawn
into the case, they stuck them into the wood and made good their
ground. Their habit was to lie about amongst the weeds that grew
on the tree or to creep into some large holes that were in it.
They did not die when I took them out of water but lived for
sixteen hours, and were then as well and strong as ever, only
dying after they had been put into spirits.</p>

<p>I got also two pieces of stones from the roots of this tree;
they were small, quite angular, and had been carried this
distance from the continent of America without any appearance of
being water-worn. This must often take place when trees are blown
down and washed away by floods, and in this manner angular pieces
of stone may be conveyed many miles from the rock from which they
were derived by the agency of water, and yet not be
water-worn.</p>

<p>August 31.</p>

<p>At 11 hours 30 minutes A.M. we found a portion of the timber
of a ship on the water, containing animals similar to those on
the pine-tree yesterday: this was perforated through and through
by different species of teredo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8. THE OVERLANDERS.</h2>

<p>CLASS OF PERSONS.</p>

<p>It is to be expected that a totally new state of things will,
in recently settled countries, give rise to different orders or
classes of men unknown in older lands, but who have been called
into existence by novel circumstances, and whose energies have
been so developed as best to suit the modifications which these
hitherto unexperienced causes may produce. In collecting
information regarding the condition of our settlements in
Australia my attention was particularly drawn to the mode of life
pursued by some of my enterprising fellow-countrymen, known there
under the denomination of Overlanders, and which is characterised
by several remarkable peculiarities well deserving of
observation, particularly at a time when so many young and
adventurous spirits are looking towards that continent as the
land of their future fortunes and home.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE OVERLANDERS.</p>

<p>The Overlanders are nearly all men in the prime of youth,
whose occupation it is to convey large herds of stock from market
to market and from colony to colony. Urged on by the hope of
profit, they have overcome difficulties of no ordinary kind,
which have made the more timid and weak-hearted quail, and
relinquish the enterprises in which they were engaged; whilst the
resolute and undaunted have persevered, and the reward they have
obtained is wealth, self-confidence in difficulties and dangers,
and a fund of accurate information on many interesting points.
Hence almost every Overlander you meet is a remarkable man.</p>

<p>The Overlanders are generally descended from good families,
have received a liberal education (Etonians and Oxonians are to
be found amongst them) and even at their first start in the
colonies were possessed of what is considered an independence.
Their grandfathers and fathers have been men distinguished in the
land and sea service of their country; and these worthy scions of
the ancient stock, finding no outlet for their enterprise and
love of adventure at home, have sought it in a distant land;
amongst them therefore is to be found a degree of polish and
frankness rarely to be looked for in such a mode of life, and in
the distant desert you unexpectedly stumble on a finished
gentleman.</p>

<p>THEIR ADVENTUROUS MODE OF LIFE.</p>

<p>The life of an Overlander in the bush is one of great
excitement which constantly calls every energy into action, is
full of romantic and novel situations, and habituates the mind to
self-possession and command. The large and stately herd of cattle
is at least a fine if not even an imposing sight. The fierce and
deadly contests which at times take place with the natives, when
two or three hardy Europeans stand opposed to an apparently
overwhelming majority of blacks, call for a large share of
personal courage and decision; whilst the savage yells and
diabolic whoops of the barbarians in their onsets, their
fantastically painted forms, their quivering spears, their
contortions, and shifting of their bodies, and their wild leaps,
attach a species of romance to these encounters which affords
plentiful matter for after-meditation. As the love of war, of
gaming, or of any other species of violent excitement, grows upon
the mind from indulgence, so does the love of roving grow upon
the Overlanders, and few or none of them ever talk of leading a
settled life.</p>

<p>SUDDEN ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH.</p>

<p>And it is not to be wondered at that the young and ardent
eagerly embrace a line of life so replete with exciting events
and incidents, and which at once enriches the successful
speculator, and fills with plenty and prosperity the region which
he enters. The first individual who opens a market, which no
other Overlander has yet visited, rides into the district an ill
clothed way-worn traveller; the residents do not at first deign
to cast a glance upon him till presently it is noised about that
an overland party has arrived, that a route from the stock
districts has been formed, and that the incalculable advantage of
abundance of cattle at a cheap rate has been secured; landed
property instantaneously rises, perhaps to double the value it
had a few hours before; numbers of persons find themselves
suddenly made rich without an exertion on their own part, and
from all sides individuals flock to see their benefactor. The ill
clothed way-worn traveller now finds himself at once invested
with the dignity of a conqueror. On all hands he is feted,
dinners are given to him, a piece of plate presented, and as he
feels the sweets of renown and of the wealth which he has won he
meditates fresh conquests on the trackless desert, new adventures
with his tried stockmen, and further acquisitions of riches.</p>

</center>

<p>EFFECTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISES.</p>

<p>Then comes a strange change over the unoccupied Overlander; he
has brought with him every head of stock which he could muster,
and in the course of a few days his last beast is disposed of;
his establishment is broken up, he awakes some morning and finds
himself a rich man, but he has no stock; he has so much money but
no cattle. He no longer follows the long array of his stately
herd and bleating flocks, his loaded drays and bearded stockmen,
through the free wilderness; no longer regulates and watches
their perilous course through the intricate ford of a deep river,
or stands upon some solitary hill to reconnoitre the trackless
country and select the line along which the motley assemblage is
to pass. He is now an idle unoccupied gentleman, the inhabitant
of a boarding-house, with no object in the world before him; but
ere long the plans of fresh achievements and speculations are
sketched out. You see a muster of bearded weather-beaten men,
carrying short-handled whips. The Overlander enters the group, a
short consultation takes place, and in a day or two more himself
and his followers are under weigh for some district where he can
purchase stock cheapest and make a good start for another
market.</p>

<p>MAGNITUDE OF THEIR OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the operations of the Overlanders would
scarcely be credited; a whole fortune is risked, and in the
wilderness: its safety depends upon good guidance; yet far from
being intimidated by the thought the adventurers are only
stimulated to a greater degree of activity. The stock of an
Overlander is the capital which he has invested in a single
speculation; and to give an idea of the amount of this I will
show, at a moderate estimate, the value of a herd, the property
of an Overlander who arrived in Adelaide in the month of March
1840 from the district of Illawarra, New South Wales.</p>

<p>HORNED CATTLE.</p>

<p>260 Cows, many broken in.<br>
230 Bullocks, 3 1/2 years old and upwards.<br>
190 Steers, 2 1/2 years old and upwards.<br>
39 Steers, 1 1/2 years old and upwards.<br>
70 Heifers, two to three years old.<br>
32 Heifers, one to two years old.<br>
9 Bulls.<br>
5 Calves.<br>
20 Working Bullocks, two shafters.</p>

<p>855 Total head of Horned Cattle.</p>

<p>HORSES.</p>

<p>22 Mares, all in foal, 3 to 5 years old.<br>
5 do., 5 to 8 years old.<br>
7 Fillies, do., 2 to 3 years old.<br>
3 do., rising 3 years, not in foal.<br>
5 do., rising 2 years, not in foal.<br>
10 Saddle and Draught Horses.<br>
5 Colts, rising 4 years old.<br>
1 Colt, rising 3 years old.<br>
1 Colt, rising 2 years old.<br>
1 Blood Stallion.<br>
1 Draught entire Horse.<br>
1 Entire Pony.</p>

<p>62 Total number of Horses.</p>

<p>900 Fat Wethers.</p>

<p>AMOUNT OF STOCK VENTURES.</p>

<p>Now, striking a low average, the value in pounds of this herd
of cattle, horses, and sheep, in South Australia, was:</p>

<p>Horned Stock 8,550.<br>
Horses 3,720.<br>
Wethers 1,575.</p>

<p>Total: 13,845 pounds.</p>

<p>But between this and an ordinary mercantile risk no parallel
can be drawn. A merchant insures his cargo so that his total loss
can but be a small portion of the whole. The Overlander cannot do
this with his stock and runs a far greater proportionate risk. It
must also be borne in mind that the statement of the herd, which
I have above given, does not include all that started for South
Australia, but only the survivors, who, after traversing so many
hundred miles, reached in safety the destined mart.</p>

<p>INFLUX OF STOCK TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>When the Overlanders drive sheep alone, without horned stock
or horses, the number of heads is much increased, as from 8000 to
12,000 sheep are brought over at one time. They are driven in
separate flocks of about 1000 each, and these follow one another
in regular succession. The value of a flock of 6000 sheep cannot
be estimated under 10,500 pounds.</p>

<p>RAPID INCREASE OF WEALTH IN NEW SETTLEMENTS.</p>

<p>So much for the operations of single parties; but when once a
road to a new market is opened numbers follow up the tracks of
the first hardy adventurer, and the operations of the whole
combined are not less startling in their magnitude than are those
of enterprising individuals. From New South Wales into the
province of South Australia the Overlanders introduced, in
1839:</p>

<p>4,200 Head of Horned Cattle,<br>
130 Horses,<br>
35,000 Sheep;</p>

<p>and within the three succeeding months of 1840, upwards
of:</p>

<p>7,000 Head of Horned Cattle,<br>
100 Horses,<br>
25,000 Sheep;</p>

<p>making, in fifteen months, a total of:</p>

<p>11,200 Head of Horned Cattle,<br>
230 Horses,<br>
60,000 Sheep.</p>

<p>The value in pounds of the above stock being in the whole
about:</p>

<p>Horned Cattle 112,000,<br>
Horses 13,800,<br>
Sheep 105,000,</p>

<p>Total: 230,800 pounds.</p>

<p>And this wonderful amount of stock was brought into a country
which, three years before, only resounded to the war-cry of the
naked savage; and the soil of which, hardened, baked, and
unstirred for centuries, nursed not within its bosom seeds from
which a plenteous harvest might spring, but, as if irritated by
neglect and indifference, gave forth unwillingly only acid roots
and scanty bulbs.</p>

<p>PROSPERITY CREATED BY THE OVERLANDER.</p>

<p>The first entrance of an Overlander into a district may be
compared to the rising of the Nile upon the thirsty land of
Egypt; then does the country bear fruit and the land give forth
her increase, he enters the district silently, noiselessly,
unexpectedly, but his influence is soon felt everywhere; merchant
vessels can now obtain cargoes of wool, and no longer sail empty
away. England receives raw materials, and in exchange are sent
out luxuries and manufactured goods. New clearings are made by
the farmer, who has now abundance of manure; the artisan plies
useful trades, and ceases to labour in the place of beasts of
draught or burden; hateful scurvy, the scourge of new colonies,
is expelled, not by medicine, but by fresh meat, milk, and
vegetables. But the worker of all this good is unmindful of it;
he has bargained to get the highest price he can for his stock,
and is already plotting new enterprises; he sought to serve
himself, not others, and has accomplished both.</p>

<p>The first Overlander having entered a district nothing can
check the tide that follows on. It is in vain for him to declare
(perhaps really conscientiously) that he conceives the risk of
loss of stock to be so great that none should undertake the
journey; this is only ascribed to his cupidity and a desire to
keep others out of the market; HE has done it, and why cannot
more? This argument is irresistible, and adventurer after
adventurer marches upon his track.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF HIS SUCCESS UPON OTHERS.</p>

<p>Now comes a hurrying into the new district of speculators from
the old colonies: the fact of a road being found to it from the
stock country is a guarantee that it will succeed, and it is in a
new settlement that the largest profits are realized. These
arrivals bring with them from the older colonies experience,
capital, and extensive connexions; fresh sources of industry and
speculation are at once opened up by them; all town-land and
landed property to be purchased at a cheap rate they secure;
money circulates from hand to hand, and an impetus is given, and
a progress made, which must be seen to be credited.</p>

<p>OPENINGS TO WEALTH IN NEW COLONIES.</p>

<p>The tide of emigration coming in from the older colonies is a
certain sign of rapid success; those who arrive from these places
are men who have done well in the first country of their
adoption; but to this they had repaired when it was thinly
inhabited, when land was of very low value and to be procured
near the capital; there they have realized largely, but it
appears to them that nearly all the good things have now been
picked up; property has attained such a value that it rises but
slowly, indeed is almost stationary in price; and the country is
so largely stocked that they are driven to establish their
sheep-stations at such a distance from the sea coast that the
expense of the transport of their wool thither greatly detracts
from its value. Under these circumstances once again do they
emigrate, to repeat in a new land the operations which have
before yielded them so lucrative a return; and, strong in past
experience, they smile at the errors committed by the younger
settlers, from which they reap many advantages.</p>

<p>ITS EFFECTS UPON ALL CLASSES.</p>

<p>But time and intellect are all worth much more in Australia
than they are in England, and everyone can realize upon his
capital and speculate profitably upon his intelligence, activity,
and strength; for all of these he gets paid, hence but few men
are willing to follow professions. Clergymen too often turn
farmers and speculators, even if they do not altogether throw
aside their sacred character. Medical men but rarely pursue their
practice, when such remunerating fields of enterprise are laid
open to them; soldiers abandon their calling; and the government
officers are all virtually farmers and stock-owners.</p>

<p>This is to be expected, from the character of man. In a new
colony everything increases rapidly in worth--a landed estate
which can be bought in the early stages of its existence at a
mere nominal price grows yearly in value without a penny being
expended upon it; stock increases in a geometrical ratio, at
little or no cost, for there is plenty of land to pasture them
upon. Nothing of this kind either does or can take place in
England; and when the settler finds how changed his prospects
are, and how new means of acquiring wealth are opened to him, he
too often devotes his every thought and energy to the one object;
and so far will this passion lead men that I have known an
honourable member of council and leading magistrate in a colony
take out a retail license, and add to his already vast wealth
from the profits of a gin shop.</p>

<p>But as stock is that species of property from which the
largest returns are realized, and that with the least labour, it
is to this branch of industry that settlers generally direct
their attention; indeed until plenty of stock is introduced into
a new colony its success is wavering and uncertain, and its
inhabitants are generally compelled to undergo a degree of
poverty and privation which contrasts strangely with the
affluence of the people occupying the more settled countries. The
degree of care and attention which is bestowed upon the breeding
of stock necessarily ensures both a constant supply of it and its
rapid diffusion over all accessible portions of the
continent.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to convey to a mind which has never
contemplated the subject an idea of the rapid advance of stock
stations over the continent of Australia; there is something
about it which bears an almost fabulous character; and the same
circumstance takes place with regard to the rise in the price of
town and country lands. Those who have not witnessed such things
can scarcely give credit to them. In Western Australia town land
was bought for twenty-three pounds an acre in the month of
December 1839; and in the month of February 1840, large
importations of stock having taken place, the same land was sold
for sixty pounds an acre. But in other colonies, where overland
communication takes place, this would be regarded as a very small
increase in price for a new colony; there are many instances in
South Australia of people realizing, in less than two years, sums
of money to the amount of from ten to twelve thousand pounds from
the sale of town acres in the city of Adelaide.</p>

<p>RAPID SPREAD OF STOCK STATIONS.</p>

<p>To endeavour to give some idea of the rapid extension of stock
stations over the face of the country I must begin by premising
that farming stock somewhat more than double themselves in two
years; or at the end of two years they occupy double the space of
territory; at the end of four years, four times; at the end of
six years, eight times; at the end of eight years, sixteen times;
and thus, at the end of ten years, thirty-two times the space of
country which was originally taken up by stock becomes occupied
by civilized man.</p>

<p>Exactly in the same ratio as the amount of occupied territory
increases so does the amount of wealth in the country advance, as
well as the demand for labour; and the natural increase of
population falling far short of this, and not supplying a
sufficient number of persons to absorb the wealth which the
country is capable of producing, a demand for emigration arises,
and a stimulus to it is given by the ease with which wealth and
comfort are acquired in the Australasian colonies.</p>

<p>COURSE OF THE OVERLANDERS THROUGH AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>If the reader casts his eye upon a general map of Australia it
will be an easy task to follow the march of stock for the last
four years:</p>

<p>Port Phillip was occupied in 1836,<br>
Portland Bay in 1835,<br>
South Australia in December 1836.</p>

<p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>The first step taken by the Overlanders was the connexion of
Port Phillip with Sydney, and they thus, as it were, established
a great base line from which their subsequent operations could be
carried on; at this period they did not however bear the name of
Overlanders, which was only given to them after Adelaide had been
reached in 1838.</p>

<p>EARLY ENTERPRISES OF THE OVERLANDERS.</p>

<p>The Overlanders had hitherto been occupied in merely pushing
their stock stations to different portions of the colony of New
South Wales; but a new and fertile field for enterprise opened to
them in the establishment of the colony of South Australia, which
as before stated was in December 1836; and many an enterprising
mind instantly turned thitherward with earnest longings which
soon ripened into action. In November 1837, that is, in eleven
months from the foundation of the new colony, several hardy
adventurers had laid, matured, and commenced carrying into
operation plans which some deemed insane when they heard of the
amount of capital invested in so new an undertaking, but which
were undertaken by the adventurers in full confidence in their
own powers.</p>

<p>THEIR FIRST EXPEDITIONS TO ADELAIDE, AND TO THE WESTWARD OF
PORT LINCOLN.</p>

<p>Two expeditions started almost at the same time for this new
market. In February 1838 Mr. Hawdon moved from the Goulburn and
Mr. Eyre from Port Phillip. In April 1838 Mr. Hawdon arrived in
Adelaide and shortly afterwards was followed by Mr. Eyre, who had
attempted to take a direct route from Port Phillip to Adelaide,
but coming upon an impassable country he had been compelled to
turn to the northward, and then to make it by the same route
which Mr. Hawdon had pursued. Just eight years before this period
a hardy party of explorers under Captain Sturt had first ventured
in a whale-boat to descend a river traversing this unknown land.
Rapidly had the fruits of this enterprise ripened to maturity;
the river was now made a highway of commerce, a connecting link
between two countries.</p>

<p>In the remaining portion of 1838 and in 1839 the energies of
the Overlanders were fully employed in supplying South Australia
with stock; and during this period several new and shorter lines
of route were struck out, the last great improvement of this kind
being made by the adventurous C. Bonney, Esquire, who connected
Port Phillip with Adelaide by a direct road running nearly
parallel to the coast, so that the portion of the continent of
Australia which lies between Moreton Bay and Adelaide is now
connected by a passable route.</p>

</center>

<p>During 1839 it was felt however that the markets of South
Australia no longer afforded such large profits; but Port Lincoln
was then occupied and a new country opened, to which cattle and
sheep were conveyed across Spencer's Gulf. This for a time
afforded some employment to the Overlanders; but their spirits
were secretly chafed by the thought that the limits of their
career were attained. Several expeditions to the westward of Port
Lincoln were undertaken, and in August 1839 Mr. Eyre, still
anxious to open a new market, pushed as far to the westward as
Denial Bay; but the journey to King George's Sound seemed so vast
an undertaking that although such a scheme was often contemplated
the hazard and risk of property appeared, even to a daring
Overlander, to be too great.</p>

<p>Yet although none ventured, many an eager heart turned that
way, and many a thoughtful face lighted up when a promising plan
was unfolded.</p>

<p>Whilst the Overlanders were thus speculating upon the
possibility of connecting the Eastern and Western portions of
Australia by one great line of communication, the new settlements
of South Australia and Port Phillip were making such rapid
advances in prosperity as almost exceed belief.</p>

<p>The settlements of Swan River and King George's Sound, which
had now been established nearly ten years, were truly in a most
miserable condition. So late as the month of September 1839, when
I landed at King George's Sound to assume the situation of
Government Resident there, the population had been in a state
bordering upon want.</p>

<p>But in the lapse of years the mismanagement and other causes
which had weighed down the settlers in Western Australia had been
swept away; and in 1839 an ameliorated system began to be
introduced, the energies and resources of the colony were allowed
to unfold and develop themselves, and a period of colonial
prosperity commenced which bids fair, if not again checked, to
run as rapid and astonishing a career as it has done in South
Australia and Port Phillip.</p>

<p>IMPORT STOCK TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>These changes were not unmarked by the Overlanders. Those
symptoms of uneasiness which always precede new eras of events
began to exhibit themselves at both ends of the proposed line of
communication. My official situation enabled me greatly to
forward these, and all persons who landed at the Sound on their
passage to South Australia recognised the advantages to be
derived from shipping stock to it from Adelaide, and thus
avoiding the passage to Swan River round Cape Leeuwin; these
persons carried numerous representations to this effect to some
of the principal stock-proprietors of South Australia; and at the
same time Dr. Harris, one of the oldest and most adventurous of
the Swan River settlers, drove a flock of sheep overland from
King George's Sound to the inland districts of the Swan River,
thus demonstrating the feasibility of this part of the plan. The
news of his safe arrival at Swan River had only just reached the
Sound when Mr. Eyre arrived in Princess Royal Harbour with a
vessel laden with sheep; he was followed in a few days by
Lieutenant Mundy, who came in a larger one laden with horned
stock and sheep; and they immediately despatched another vessel
for 1000 more sheep.</p>

<p>STATE OF THE CATTLE MARKET THERE.</p>

<p>Thus was a sort of communication established between the two
colonies; but the profits arising from the sale of stock brought
in a vessel were in a great measure absorbed by the expenses of
transport, and in the winter season the passage is too rough to
allow of the risk of shipping stock. Were they driven overland,
instead of being transported by sea, horned stock could be sold
at about 5 pounds per head, and sheep for 15 shillings per head
less. Moreover the price of the different colonial markets would
be equalised, and new settlers in all the colonies would start
with an equal chance; whereas at present if two settlers with
equal means go the one to Western and the other to Southern
Australia, for every 100 head of horned stock and 100 head of
sheep that the settler in Western Australia can buy with his
capital the settler in Southern Australia can buy 200 head of
horned cattle and 800 of sheep; this scarcely appears to create
so vast a difference between the two as it really does until we
regard the relative position of the two settlers at the end of
some given term of years, for instance five; they would then
stand thus: TABLE OF RELATIVE VALUES OF SOUTHERN AND WESTERN
AUSTRALIAN STOCK.</p>

<p>GENERAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPREAD OF COMMERCE AND
EMIGRATION.</p>

<p>The rapidity of communication from point to point has
introduced such vast effects in the march of improvement among
distant lands as only eye-witnesses can believe. The merchant in
London who lays on a vessel for a certain port regards the affair
as a mere mercantile speculation, but could he trace out the
results he effects in their remotest ramifications he would stand
astonished at the changes he produces. With the wizard wand of
commerce he touches a lone and trackless forest, and at his
bidding cities arise, and the hum and dust of trade collect, away
are swept ancient races; antique laws and customs moulder into
oblivion. The strongholds of murder and superstition are
cleansed, and the Gospel is preached amongst ignorant and savage
men. The ruder languages disappear successively, and the tongue
of England alone is heard around.</p>

<p>Such are the ultimate effects of the daily occupations of many
men in the City of London, who, seated in a dark and dingy
counting-house in pursuit of gain, form and execute schemes the
eventual tenor and bearing of which are not to enrich themselves
but the human race. No doubt amongst the mass are noble minds who
have a perception of the true object of their calling, who feel a
just and laudable pride that they are the employers and
benefactors of mankind; whose names, even amongst distant hordes
of untaught men, pass current, as a security for probity and
honour; who write a few lines in London and move the antipodes;
who within the last fifty years have either actually erected or
laid the stable foundation of six great empires, offsets of that
strong nation who, together with her progeny, is overspreading
the earth, not by the sword but by the gentle arts of peace and
beneficence.</p>

<p>GENERAL RESULTS OF GREAT MERCANTILE OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>In the earlier Colonies, founded by the great maritime powers
of the world, national hatred prevailed to a great degree,
although war existed not between the parent states: still, at
distant points removed from the immediate control of the law, the
hatred of races found vent, cruelties were committed, reprisals
took place, and Europeans warred one upon another. But England
and America, as they progress in these regions, spread a common
language and a common faith, and no national antipathies can be
strictly said to exist between them.</p>

<p>TRADE OF THE AMERICANS WITH OUT-STATIONS.</p>

<p>The Americans, who are decidedly a more enterprising
mercantile people than ourselves, have almost engrossed the
profits of the seas surrounding the Indian Archipelago and the
western and south-western portions of New Holland. Their vessels
in these parts are to ours in the ratio of at least ten to one.
They constantly frequent the out-stations of Western Australia;
supply the wants of those retired portions of the world, and
where, legitimately, the British manufacturer should command the
market, little besides the produce of America is to be seen. The
settlers at these stations derive the largest portions of their
supplies from the American whalers, who give them in exchange for
potatoes and vegetables--and this species of barter is so
profitable to both parties that it would be impossible to prevent
it (nay the attempt would be cruel) by any other means than by
inducing British whalers and merchant-vessels to secure some
portion of those advantages which are at present wholly
monopolized by others.</p>

<p>EFFECTS OF THE SPIRIT OF SPECULATION.</p>

<p>The masters of the American whalers participate in a great
degree in the feelings of the out-settlers; from the impressions
generated in their infancy they are disposed to look with a
fraternal eye upon the few adventurous spirits who have located
themselves far from their fellow men to reclaim a home from the
wilderness. They have seen, lived amongst, and shared the
benefits which result from such commencements, and it is not
therefore to be wondered at that at all the out-stations the most
friendly relations exist between the settlers and the American
whalers; and when, during the five months of the bay whaling
season, an American vessel lays at anchor in some bay where there
are one or two settlers' families, a constant exchange of mutual
acts of kindness takes place, equally creditable to both parties;
whence result friendship, and perhaps an intermarriage; and when
the period of the vessel's sailing arrives there are numerous
deserters from her crew, who readily find employment at the
different sheep stations.</p>

<p>DIFFUSION OF EMIGRATION.</p>

<p>Thus a species of emigration of which nothing is known in
England takes place in the colonies. Men, from the force of
poverty, from the desire of gain, or of founding a family and
property in a new land, or for some other reason, quit their
homes and enter another portion of the globe. There they find
many who, having in the commencement of a settlement realized the
largest profits, are discontented with the percentage they can
now gain upon their capital; and what to the newcomer appears to
be a highly remunerating return they despise; gladly therefore do
they dispose of everything to the new emigrants and, animated by
that restless spirit of adventure which is common to all first
settlers, away they start for the last new colony or for
unsettled lands--New Zealand, the Sandwich Islands, the Indian
Archipelago, it matters not which--a fresh field of speculation
has been opened, the tide of emigration from Europe seems to be
setting towards a certain quarter where there are numerous new
arrivals who can never compete with old and practised colonists.
He who has seen several cities rise can judge to a nicety, from
local circumstances, upon what site the capital of the new
province must be built; and in the same way he can foresee which
must become the business street, and hence knows exactly the
relative value of every acre of land in the province. In vain for
him are reports spread that the capital is to be built in such or
such a spot, he but encourages them; in the meantime rapidly and
noiselessly his purchases are made, and a fresh acquisition of
fortune secured.</p>

<p>This class of men, amongst whom are many Overlanders, are
never satisfied or settled; they are constantly engaged in
contemplating changes in the prosperity of colonies and means of
enriching themselves, they positively disregard personal comfort,
and a restless spirit of activity and love of change animates
them wholly. In these respects there is a great similarity of
character between them and the Americans, and it is inconceivable
in how short a period of time such a change is brought about.</p>

<h3>THE ABORIGINES.</h3>

<p><a name="chapter9"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9. NATIVE LANGUAGE.</h2>

<p>RADICAL UNITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE
CONTINENT.</p>

<p>In the preceding narrative of my Expeditions I have
occasionally introduced some casual incidents relating to the
manners and social condition of the natives of Australia, a race
generally considered to occupy too low a position in the scale of
humanity to be worthy of any peculiar regard. In the following
pages I shall bring together such observations as my intercourse
with them enabled me to collect; arranging my remarks under the
heads of Language, traditional or customary Laws, and social
Habits and Manners; and to these I shall add some desultory
anecdotes illustrative of their superstitions, and of some other
peculiarities of thought and action; and shall conclude with a
short review of the influence that the settlement of Europeans
among them has, or is likely to have, on their condition.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF A CONTRARY OPINION.</p>

<p>It has hitherto been very generally believed that the
languages spoken in different portions of the continent of
Australia are radically distinct; and as such a circumstance,
were it really the case, would tend to prove that its inhabitants
originated from several separate races, it becomes rather an
important matter to set this question at rest, and to endeavour
to show from what cause so erroneous an opinion originated.</p>

<p>The arguments which prove that all the Australian dialects
have a common root are:</p>

<p>1. A general similarity of sound and structure of words in the
different portions of Australia, as far as yet ascertained</p>

<p>2. The recurrence of the same word with the same
signification, to be traced, in many instances, round the entire
continent, but undergoing, of course, in so vast an extent of
country, various modifications;</p>

<p>3. The same names of natives occurring frequently at totally
opposite portions of the continent. Now, in all parts of it which
are known to Europeans, it is ascertained that the natives name
their children from any remarkable circumstance which may occur
soon after their birth; such being the case, an accordance of the
names of natives is a proof of a similarity of dialect.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF ERROR IN ENQUIRERS.</p>

<p>The chief cause of the misapprehension which has so long
existed with regard to the point under consideration is that the
language of the aborigines of Australia abounds in synonymes,
many of which are, for a time, altogether local; so that, for
instance, the inhabitants of a particular district will use one
word for water, whilst those of a neighbouring district will
apply another, which appears to be a totally different one. But
when I found out that in such instances as these both tribes
understood the words which either made use of, and merely
employed another one, from temporary fashion and caprice, I felt
convinced that the language generally spoken to Europeans by the
natives of any one small district could not be considered as a
fair specimen of the general language of that part of Australia,
and therefore in the vocabulary which I compiled in Western
Australia I introduced words collected from a very extensive
tract of country.</p>

<p>Again, in getting the names of the parts of the body, etc.,
from the natives, many causes of error arise; for they have names
for almost every minute portion of the human frame: thus, in
asking the name for the arm, one stranger would get the name for
the upper arm, another for the lower arm, another for the right
arm, another for the left arm, etc.; and it therefore seems most
probable that in the earlier stages of the inquiry into the
nature of the language of this people these circumstances
contributed mainly to the erroneous conclusion that languages
radically different were spoken in remote parts of the
continent.</p>

<p>PROOFS OF IDENTITY OF THE LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE
CONTINENT.</p>

<p>One singularity in the dialects spoken by the aborigines in
different portions of Australia is that those of districts widely
removed from one another sometimes assimilate very closely,
whilst the dialects spoken in the intermediate ones differ
considerably from either of them. The same circumstances take
place with regard to their rites and customs; but as this appears
rather to belong to the question of the means by which this race
was distributed over so extensive a tract of country, I will not
now enter into it, but merely adduce sufficient evidence to prove
that a language radically the same is spoken over the whole
continent.</p>

<p>If then we start from Perth in Western Australia, following
the coast in a southerly direction, it will be found that between
Perth and King George's Sound a common language is spoken, made
up of several dialects, scarcely differing from one another in
any material points and gradually merging into the dialects of
these two places, as the points considered are nearer to one or
the other.</p>

<p>The principal causes of difference between the dialects of
these two places are, 1st, that at King George's Sound the
terminating syllable of all names is dropped; and 2nd, that all
verbs, with a very few exceptions, end in gur, instead of the
varying termination which is given to them at Perth. Any person
who can speak the Perth dialect will, by observing these two
rules, be able to converse freely with the natives of King
George's Sound.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-34"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-34.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>From these examples it will be seen that the King George's
Sound dialect is the simplest of the two; and indeed I am
inclined to believe that the dialect there spoken is more simple
than that in use at any other portion of the continent.</p>

<p>If we now proceed to Adelaide in South Australia we still find
the same language spoken, but the dialect here is considerably
softened; the hard g of Perth is exchanged for k, and b becomes p
and w. Many of the nouns take -anga as a termination, and the
verbs take -andi and -endi. This addition of soft terminations
and a general sweetness of sound appear to be the peculiar
characteristics of the Adelaide dialect. No large vocabulary of
this language has yet been published, but one-eighth of the words
known as belonging to the Perth dialect have been found also in
that of Adelaide; we may therefore fairly conclude that when the
latter language is better known a still greater degree of
identity will be found to exist.</p>

<p>Natives from several parts of the Murray and Murrumbidgee and
from Port Phillip have been brought into communication with
natives from King George's Sound, scanty vocabularies from some
of these points are also extant, and the amount of evidence thus
gained clearly establishes that the several dialects are all
derived from a common root.</p>

<p>The labours of Mr. Threlkeld in the vicinity of Hunter's River
and Lake Macquarie enable us to compare the language of that
portion of Australia with those of the other points which we have
just considered, and the result of this comparison also shows
that the languages are radically the same.</p>

<p>TABLES OF EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>The following Tables will give a sufficient number of words
common to those four dialects to show the degree of similarity
which exists among them.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="grey2-29"></a><img alt="" src="/ebooks/e00055-images/grey2-29.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>VARIATIONS OF DIALECT.</p>

<p>Now before proceeding farther and thus entering upon ground
which is very little known, there are several important
circumstances worthy of consideration. In the vast extent of
country which is comprised between the points embraced in these
tables it was to have been expected that very great variations of
dialect would have been found. If we only reflect upon the
differences of dialect existing between the several counties of
England, so limited in extent, how much greater were the
variations to have been reasonably anticipated in a country
between two and three thousand miles across, where an unwritten
language is in use, and where no communication whatever takes
place between the inhabitants of distant portions: moreover in
this great extent the vegetation becomes totally different;
birds, reptiles, and quadrupeds inhabit one portion of the
continent which are unknown in another, and external nature
altogether changes. Under these circumstances many new words must
have been invented, and new terms must constantly have been
introduced as the population spread across the country, and as
those who were constantly pushing on from the outskirts of the
inhabited parts ceased to communicate with the districts which
had been first peopled, these changes must have been unknown to
the original inhabitants of the continent and to those of their
descendants who successively inhabited their territory.</p>

<p>If for instance this country was first peopled from the north
or the tropical parts, the most remote inhabitants of the
southern portions must have invented terms for snow, ice, hail,
intense cold, etc., as well as for every tree and bird, for every
fish and reptile, and for every insect; all the compound and
comparative terms derived from these, as well as the original
words, we ought therefore to expect to find totally different in
the languages of the north and south, of the east and west; and
from whatever portion of the continent we imagine the first
inhabitants to have proceeded the same reasoning holds good.</p>

<p>RADICAL IDENTITY OF THE PRONOUNS.</p>

<p>But personal terms, such as the parts of the body, the
pronouns, etc., and also verbs describing ordinary actions, ought
not to be expected to vary in the same degree; and we shall
accordingly find that it is chiefly in words of these and similar
classes that the greatest degree of resemblance is found to
exist. With regard to the pronouns this is very remarkable. In
the singular, plural, and dual numbers they almost coincide in
Western Australia, South Australia, and Sydney. The following
table of the pronouns as used in those places will show this:</p>

<p>TABLE OF PRONOUNS.</p>

</center>

<p>DIFFERENCES OF DIALECT EXPLAINED. EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>To those who have not considered this circumstance languages
have frequently appeared to be quite different which in reality
are closely assimilated. Two instances will explain my meaning.
The natives in the vicinity of Perth generally use the word
gab-by, or kuyp-e, for water, but those inhabiting a district
only twelve or fourteen miles distant from Perth adopt the word
kow-win; the word used by the natives in the vicinity of Adelaide
in South Australia for water is kauw-ee. Now, on comparing these
words it might have been hastily concluded that the languages of
West and South Australia were without affinity; but in fact the
variation does not constitute any essential difference, for,
considering the interchangeable nature of the consonants b, p,
and w, and of g and k, which affect different dialects, we shall
find the words gab-by, kuyp-e, kow-win and kauw-ee to be only
different forms from one root. One instance of another kind may
be given. The word for the sun at Perth is nganga, whilst at
Adelaide it is tin-dee; but the word used by the natives at
Encounter Bay, South Australia, thirty-six miles from Adelaide,
is ngon-ge, and the word used in the southern districts of
Western Australia for the stars is tiendee: thus by extending the
vocabularies of the two places the identity of the language is
shown.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF ERROR IN FORMER ENQUIRERS.</p>

<p>Up to the present time we have had only very meagre
vocabularies, collected by passing strangers, each of whom
adopted his own system of orthography, and the comparisons formed
from such compilations must necessarily have been erroneous in
the highest degree. Moreover in many instances these strangers
were grossly imposed upon. One gentleman published a vocabulary
of the King George's Sound dialect which has been largely quoted
from by other writers; in this the numerals as high as ten are
given, although the natives only count to four; and the
translations of some words which he has put down as numbers are
very humorous, such as: What do you mean? Get out, etc.</p>

<p>COMMON ORIGIN OF NATIVE POPULATION.</p>

<p>Many words spoken by the natives at Shark Bay are the same as
those used by the natives at Perth, and the dialect in use in the
Province of Victoria appears very nearly to assimilate to the
latter, as is shown in the extracts from Mr. Moore's journal at
page 120. Having thus traced the entire of the coastline of the
continent of Australia, it appears that a language the same in
root is spoken throughout this vast extent of country; and from
the general agreement in this as well as in personal appearance,
rites, and ceremonies, we may fairly infer a community of origin
for the aborigines. This being admitted, two other questions will
arise.</p>

<p>How were they disseminated over the continent?</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>At what period, and from what quarter, did they arrive upon
it?</p>

<p><a name="chapter10"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10. THEIR TRADITIONAL LAWS.</h2>

<p>ERRORS OF THEORETICAL WRITERS REGARDING THE SAVAGE STATE.</p>

<p>No question has, in as far as I can apprehend the subject,
been so utterly misunderstood and misrepresented as the one
relating to the customs and traditional laws of savage races.
Deistical writers and philosophers of great note but small
experience have built up whole theories, and have either
overturned or striven to overturn ancient faiths and wholesome
laws by arguments deduced, in the first instance, from the
consideration of man in his simple or savage state; and from
false premises they have deduced, logically, argument from
argument, until even the most unwilling have begun to doubt.</p>

<p>COMPLEX LAWS OF SAVAGE LIFE.</p>

<p>But to believe that man in a savage state is endowed with
freedom either of thought or action is erroneous in the highest
degree. He is in reality subjected to complex laws which not only
deprive him of all free agency of thought, but at the same time,
by allowing no scope whatever for the development of intellect,
benevolence, or any other great moral qualification, they
necessarily bind him down in a hopeless state of barbarism from
which it is impossible for man to emerge so long as he is
enthralled by these customs; which, on the other hand, are so
ingeniously devised as to have a direct tendency to annihilate
any effort that is made to overthrow them.</p>

<p>This people reject in practice all idea of the equality of
persons or classes; they make indeed no verbal distinctions upon
this point, and if asked, were all men equal? they would be
unable to comprehend the question; but there is no race that
imposes more irksome restraints upon certain classes of the
community.</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE NATIVE CUSTOMS. THEIR GENERALITY.</p>

<p>The whole tendency of their superstitions and traditional
regulations is to produce the effect of depriving certain classes
of benefits which are enjoyed by others; and this monopolizing of
advantages often possesses amongst savages many characteristics
which violate all the holier feelings of our nature, and excite a
disgust of which it is divested in civilized life. In the latter
case we see certain privileges even hereditarily enjoyed; but the
weak and strong, the rich and poor, the young and old have paths
of honourable ambition laid open to them by entering on which
they can gain like immunities. While in the savage condition we
find the female sex, the young, and the weak, condemned to a
hopeless state of degradation and to a lasting deprivation of
particular advantages merely because they are defenceless; and
what they are deprived of is given to others merely because they
are old or strong: and this is not effected by personal violence,
depending upon momentary caprice and individual disposition (in
which case it might be considered as the consequence of a state
of equality) but it is enforced upon the natives of Australia by
traditional laws and customs which are by them considered as
valid and binding as our laws are by us.</p>

<p>CONSIDERATIONS ON THEIR ORIGIN.</p>

<p>The laws and customs alluded to cannot be considered as mere
local institutions, for travellers and residents in the northern
provinces of the colony of New South Wales describe as existing
there usages nearly identical with those which regulate the
proceedings of the natives occupying the west of the continent.
And these testimonies cannot be doubted for they are incidentally
introduced without any theoretical bias and in ignorance of the
conformity they tend to prove. Natives from the country about the
Murrumbidgee have described to me Australian customs as being in
force there which exhibit the same accordance with those I found
in the west; and I have myself ascertained their existence on
several other portions of the continent. But it is remarkable
that, although so many persons have described isolated customs of
this people, no one has yet taken the trouble to digest them into
one mass, and to exhibit them in the aggregate, so that an
inference might be drawn as to how far the state in which the
natives of Australia are at present found is caused by the
institutions to which they are subjected.</p>

<p>We find then, in Australia, the remarkable fact that the
inhabitants of a tract of country nearly two thousand miles in
breadth are governed by the same institutions: and what renders
this more singular is that the people submitted to them are not
subjected by written rules of faith, which the chiefs of each
race may interpret and modify according to their will; as is the
case with those who are governed by the Koran or other similar
codes; but in this instance mere oral traditions are handed down,
which teach that certain rules of conduct are to be observed
under certain penalties, and without the aid of fixed records, or
the intervention of a succession of authorized depositaries and
expounders these laws have been transmitted from father to son
through unknown generations, and are fixed in the minds of the
people as sacred and unalterable.</p>

<p>DEISTICAL REVERIES CONFUTED BY EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p>One common mode of argument among deistical writers is to
imagine barbarous man let loose upon the earth without undergoing
any previous preparation for the scene upon which he was about to
enter; and they then trace out how, urged on by his necessities
and aided by his senses, he successively discovered the natural
productions necessary for his subsistence and the arts which
ministered to his wants, until step by step he mounted to the
pinnacle of civilization. But these are merely reveries of the
closet, dreams of the inexperienced, and have no real foundation
in as far at least as Australia is concerned. That the first
natives who were placed on that continent must have been
instructed how to provide for their wants, how to form weapons
suited to their circumstances, how to select roots, and to
capture animals fitted for food, has been demonstrated over and
over again, but at no time more forcibly than when the portion of
my party, under Mr. Walker, were coming overland from Gantheaume
Bay to Perth. In this case six full-grown men, provided with
knives, fishing-hooks and lines, a kettle, vessels to hold water
and cook their food, arms, and a small quantity of ammunition,
and many of them possessing considerable experience in the bush,
must all have perished from hunger had not timely assistance
reached them; and this from their ignorance as to which of the
productions surrounding them would serve to support life, and not
from neglect in making the requisite experiments to endeavour to
ascertain this, for the poor fellows ate everything they could
find which appeared to afford sustenance; yet notwithstanding all
the comparative advantages they were in possession of, if the
relief sent from Perth had not reached them, death must have
overtaken all. The same result has frequently occurred under
nearly similar circumstances. If then men, full-grown, in the
complete possession of all their faculties, provided with fire
and many useful implements, and aided by considerable experience,
from ignorance of the natural productions of a country, and the
means of procuring these, die from hunger ere they can learn how
to supply their wants, is it probable that an unarmed, naked,
untaught man, who knew not even how to make his senses act in
concert until he had from experience acquired this knowledge,
could by any possibility have avoided a fate, which would
inevitably overtake the European in possession of all his
superior energies of mind and character, if he chance not to fall
in with friendly natives.</p>

<p>ENQUIRY INTO THE ORIGIN OF THE NATIVE LAWS.</p>

<p>The laws of this people are unfitted for the government of a
single isolated family, some of them being only adapted for the
regulation of an assemblage of families; they could therefore not
have been a series of rules given by the first father to his
children: again, they could not have been rules given by an
assembly of the first fathers to their children, for there are
these remarkable features about them that some are of such a
nature as to compel those subject to them to remain in a state of
barbarism, whilst others are adapted to the wants and necessities
of savage RACES, as well as to prevent too close intermarriages
of a people who preserve no written or symbolical records of any
kind; and in all these instances the desired ends are obtained by
the simplest means, so that we are necessitated to admit that,
when these rules were planned it was foreseen that the race
submitted to them would be savages, and under this foresight the
necessary provision was made for the event.</p>

<p>We cannot argue that this race was originally in a state of
civilization, and that from the introduction of certain laws
amongst them, the tendency of which was to reduce them to a state
of barbarism, or from some other cause, they had gradually sunk
to their present condition; for in that case how could those laws
which provide solely for the necessities of a people in their
present state have been introduced amongst them? Neither could
they have been invented according to necessities and emergencies
which a savage state has produced, for under such circumstances
it is impossible that they could have been promulgated and
enforced throughout so wide a range of country, and amongst a
dispersed race of barbarians of such a variety of dispositions,
who acknowledge no chief or lawgiver, and are so
characteristically impatient of restraint.</p>

<p>Without in this place attempting to form and to support any
theories founded upon the views I have just put forward, I may
state my impression that it would seem, from the laws and customs
of the natives of Australia, to have been willed that this people
should until a certain period remain in their present condition,
which is consequently not the result of mere accident, or of the
natural constitution of man. From the peculiar nature of their
institutions it was impossible that they could emerge from a
state of barbarism whilst these remained in force, and from the
tenacity and undeviating strictness with which they are retained,
and the strong power they hold over the savage mind, it seems
equally impossible that they could have been abrogated, or even
altered, until the race subjected to them came into contact with
a civilized community whose presence might exercise a new
influence, under which the ancient system would expire or be
swept away.</p>

<p>We may, I think, fairly produce this as a proof that the
progress of civilization over the earth has been directed, set
bounds to, and regulated by certain laws framed by Infinite
wisdom; and, although such views may by some be deemed visionary,
I feel some confidence that these laws are as certain and
definite as those which control the movements of the heavenly
bodies. I believe moreover, that they are capable in some degree
of being studied and reduced to order, although no attempt to do
so has hitherto been made; and the institutions of barbarous
races, their probable origin, the effects they have upon the
people submitted to them, the evidences of design which they
contain, and other similar questions, are those points to which
in this enquiry attention should be particularly directed.</p>

<p>CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.</p>

<p>The progress of events and the rapid march of science in our
country are very wonderful, but the progress of events in the
eastern hemisphere at the present moment is still more amazing:
Christianity and civilization are marching over the world with a
rapidity not fully known or estimated by any one nation; the
English are scarcely aware what has been effected by their own
missionaries and commerce, and they are utterly ignorant of what
has been already done, and is now doing, by the Americans, Dutch,
and Portuguese.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11. LAWS OF RELATIONSHIP, MARRIAGE, AND
INHERITANCE.</h2>

<p>RELATIONSHIP AND MARRIAGE. DIVISION OF FAMILIES.</p>

<p>Traditional Laws of Relationship and Marriage.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts connected with the natives is
that they are divided into certain great families, all the
members of which bear the same names, as a family, or second
name: the principal branches of these families, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, are the:</p>

<p>Ballaroke<br>
Tdondarup<br>
Ngotak<br>
Nagarnook<br>
Nogonyuk<br>
Mongalung<br>
Narrangur.</p>

<p>But in different districts the members of these families give
a local name to the one to which they belong, which is understood
in that district to indicate some particular branch of the
principal family. The most common local names are:</p>

<p>Didaroke<br>
Gwerrinjoke<br>
Maleoke<br>
Waddaroke<br>
Djekoke<br>
Kotejumeno<br>
Namyungo<br>
Yungaree.</p>

<p>These family names are common over a great portion of the
continent; for instance, on the Western coast, in a tract of
country extending between four and five hundred miles in
latitude, members of all these families are found. In South
Australia I met a man who said that he belonged to one of them,
and Captain Flinders mentions Yungaree as the name of a native in
the gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<p>LAW OF MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>These family names are perpetuated and spread through the
country by the operation of two remarkable laws:</p>

<p>1. That children of either sex always take the family name of
their mother.</p>

<p>2. That a man cannot marry a woman of his own family name.</p>

<p>COINCIDENT INSTITUTIONS AMONGST THE NORTH AMERICAN
INDIANS.</p>

<p>But not the least singular circumstance connected with these
institutions is their coincidence with those of the North
American Indians, which are thus stated in the Archaeologia
Americana:*</p>

<p>Independent of political or geographical divisions, that into
families or clans has been established from time immemorial. At
what time and in what manner the division was first made is not
known. At present, or till very lately, every nation was divided
into a number of clans, varying in the several nations from three
to eight or ten, the members of which respectively were dispersed
indiscriminately throughout the whole nation. It has been fully
ascertained that the inviolable regulations by which those clans
were perpetuated amongst the southern nations were, first, that
no man could marry in his own clan; secondly, that every child
belongs to his or her mother's clan. Among the Choctaws there are
two great divisions, each of which is subdivided into four clans,
and no man can marry in any of the four clans belonging to his
division. The restriction among the Cherokees, the Creeks, and
the Natches, does not extend beyond the clan to which the man
belongs.</p>

<p>There are sufficient proofs, that the same division into
clans, commonly called tribes, exists among almost all the other
Indian nations. But it is not so clear that they are subject to
the same regulations which prevail amongst the southern
Indians.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Volume 2 page 109.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A similar law of consanguinity seems to be inferred in
Abraham's reply to Abimelech (Genesis 20:12) And yet indeed she
is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the
daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.</p>

<p>FAMILY NAMES AND SIGNS. ORIGIN OF FAMILY NAMES.</p>

<p>The origin of these family names is attributed by the natives
to different causes, but I think that enough is not yet known on
the subject to enable us to form an accurate opinion on this
point. One origin frequently assigned by the natives is that they
were derived from some vegetable or animal being very common in
the district which the family inhabited, and that hence the name
of this animal or vegetable became applied to the family. I have
in my published vocabulary of the native language, under each
family name, given its derivations as far as I could collect them
from the statements of the natives.</p>

<p>But as each family adopts some animal or vegetable as their
crest or sign, or Kobong, as they call it, I imagine it more
likely that these have been named after the families than that
the families have been named after them.</p>

<p>SECOND COINCIDENCE.</p>

<p>A certain mysterious connection exists between a family and
its kobong, so that a member of the family will never kill an
animal of the species to which his kobong belongs, should he find
it asleep; indeed he always kills it reluctantly, and never
without affording it a chance to escape. This arises from the
family belief that some one individual of the species is their
nearest friend, to kill whom would be a great crime, and to be
carefully avoided. Similarly a native who has a vegetable for his
kobong may not gather it under certain circumstances and at a
particular period of the year. The North American Indians have
this same custom of taking some animal as their sign. Thus it is
stated in the Archaeologia Americana:* "Each tribe has the name
of some animal. Among the Hurons the first tribe is that of the
bear; the two others of the wolf and turtle. The Iroquois nation
has the same divisions, only the turtle family is divided into
two, the great and the little." And again, in speaking of the
Sioux tribes:** "Each of these derives its name from some animal,
part of an animal, or other substance which is considered as the
peculiar sacred object or medicine, as the Canadians call it, of
each band respectively." To this we may add the testimony of John
Long, who says,*** "one part of the religious superstition of the
savages consists in each of them having his totem, or favourite
spirit, which he believes watches over him. This totem they
conceive assumes the shape of some beast or other, and therefore
they never kill, hunt, or eat the animal whose form they think
the totem bears."</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Volume 2 page 109 quoting from Charlevoix
volume 3 page 266.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(**Footnote. Ibid page 110 quoting from Major Long's
Exp. volume 1 chapter 15.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(***Footnote. Voyages and Travels page
86.)</blockquote>

<p>Civilized nations, in their heraldic bearings, preserve traces
of the same custom.</p>

<p>BETROTHMENTS AND MARRIAGES.</p>

<p>Female children are always betrothed within a few days after
their birth; and from the moment they are betrothed the parents
cease to have any control over the future settlement of their
child. Should the first husband die before the girl has attained
the years of puberty she then belongs to his heir.</p>

<p>A girl lives with her husband at any age she pleases, no
control whatever is in this way placed upon her inclinations.</p>

<p>WIDOWS.</p>

<p>When a native dies his brother inherits his wives and
children, but his brother must be of the same family name as
himself. The widow goes to her second husband's hut three days
after the death of her first.</p>

<p>The old men manage to keep the females a good deal amongst
themselves, giving their daughters to one another, and the more
female children they have the greater chance have they of getting
another wife by this sort of exchange; but the women have
generally some favourite amongst the young men, always looking
forward to be his wife at the death of her husband.</p>

<p>OBLIGATIONS OF RELATIONSHIP. DIVISION OF FAMILY BRANCHES.</p>

<p>But a most remarkable law is that which obliges families
connected by blood upon the female side to join for the purpose
of defence and avenging crimes; and as the father marries several
wives, and very often all of different families, his children are
repeatedly all divided amongst themselves; no common bond of
union exists between them, and this custom alone would be
sufficient to prevent this people ever emerging from the savage
state.</p>

<p>As their laws are principally made up of sets of obligations
due from members of the same great family towards one
another--which obligations of family names are much stronger than
those of blood--it is evident that a vast influence upon the
manners and state of this people must be brought about by this
arrangement into classes. I therefore devoted a great portion of
my attention to this point, but the mass of materials I have
collected is so large that it would occupy much more time to
arrange it than I have been able to spare so as to do full
justice to the subject; but in order to give an accurate idea of
the nature of the enquiries I pursued I have given in the
Appendix A a short genealogical list which will show the manner
in which a native gives birth to a progeny of a totally different
family name to himself; so that a district of country never
remains for two successive generations in the same family. These
observations, as well as others made with regard to the natives,
can be only considered to apply, as yet, to that portion of
Western Australia lying between the 30th and 35th parallels of
south latitude unless the contrary is expressly stated; though I
think there is strong reason to suppose that they will, in
general, be found to obtain throughout the continent.</p>

<p>DIFFICULTY OF PURSUING THE ENQUIRY.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any person not well acquainted with the
language of the natives and who does not possess great personal
influence over them to pursue an inquiry of this nature; for one
of the customs most rigidly observed and enforced amongst them is
never to mention the name of a deceased person, male or female.
In an inquiry therefore which principally turns upon the names of
their ancestors this prejudice must be every moment violated, and
a very great difficulty has thus to be encountered in the outset.
The only circumstance which at all enabled me to overcome this
was that the longer a person has been dead the less repugnance do
they evince in uttering his name. I therefore in the first
instance endeavoured to ascertain only the oldest names on
record; and on subsequent occasions, when I found a native alone
and in a loquacious humour, I succeeded in filling up some of the
blanks. Occasionally round their fires at night I managed to
involve them in disputes regarding their ancestors, and on these
occasions gleaned much of the information of which I was in
want.</p>

<p>LAWS OF LANDED PROPERTY. RIGHTS AND BOUNDARIES. PROPERTY
VESTED IN INDIVIDUALS.</p>

<p>Traditional Laws relative to Landed Property.</p>

<p>Landed property does not belong to a tribe, or to several
families, but to a single male; and the limits of his property
are so accurately defined that every native knows those of his
own land, and can point out the various objects which mark his
boundary. I cannot establish the fact and the universality of
this institution better than by the following letter addressed by
Dr. Lang, the Principal of Sydney College, New South Wales, to
Dr. Hodgkin, the zealous advocate of the Aboriginal Races:*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Extracted from the Reports of the
Aboriginal Protection Society.)</blockquote>

<p>Liverpool, 15th November 1840.</p>

<p>My Dear Friend,</p>

<p>In reply to the question which you proposed to me some time
ago in the course of conversation in London, and of which you
have reminded me in the letter I had the pleasure of receiving
from you yesterday, with the pamphlets and letters for America,
namely, Whether the Aborigines of the Australian continent have
any idea of property in land, I beg to answer most decidedly in
the affirmative. It is well known that these Aborigines in no
instance cultivate the soil, but subsist entirely by hunting and
fishing, and on the wild roots they find in certain localities
(especially the common fern) with occasionally a little wild
honey; indigenous fruits being exceedingly rare. The whole race
is divided into tribes, more or less numerous, according to
circumstances, and designated from the localities they inhabit;
for although universally a wandering race, with respect to places
of habitation, their wanderings are circumscribed by certain
well-defined limits, beyond which they seldom pass, except for
purposes of war or festivity. In short, every tribe has its own
district, the boundaries of which are well known to the natives
generally; and within that district all the wild animals are
considered as much the property of the tribe inhabiting, or
rather ranging on, its whole extent, as the flocks of sheep and
herds of cattle that have been introduced into the country by
adventurous Europeans are held by European law and usage the
property of their respective owners. In fact, as the country is
occupied chiefly for pastoral purposes, the difference between
the Aboriginal and the European ideas of property in the soil is
more imaginary than real, the native grass affording subsistence
to the kangaroos of the natives as well as to the wild cattle of
the Europeans, and the only difference indeed being that the
former are not branded with a particular mark like the latter,
and are somewhat wilder and more difficult to catch.</p>

<p>EFFECTS OF EUROPEAN APPROPRIATION.</p>

<p>Nay, as the European regards the intrusion of any other white
man upon the cattle-run, of which European law and usage have
made him the possessor, and gets it punished as a trespass, the
Aborigines of the particular tribe inhabiting a particular
district regard the intrusion of any other tribe of Aborigines
upon that district, for the purposes of kangaroo hunting, etc.,
as an intrusion to be resisted and punished by force of arms. In
short this is the frequent cause of Aboriginal, as it is of
European wars; man, in his natural state, being very much alike
in all conditions--jealous of his rights and exceedingly
pugnacious. It is true the European intruders pay no respect to
these Aboriginal divisions of the territory, the black native
being often hunted off his own ground or destroyed by European
violence, dissipation, or disease, just as his kangaroos are
driven off that ground by the European's black cattle; but this
surely does not alter the case as to the right of the
Aborigines.</p>

<p>UNIVERSALITY OF THIS CUSTOM.</p>

<p>But particular districts are not merely the property of
particular tribes; particular sections or portions of these
districts are universally recognised by the natives as the
property of individual members of these tribes; and when the
owner of such a section or portion of territory (as I ascertained
was the case at King George's Island) has determined on burning
off the grass on his land, which is done for the double purpose
of enabling the natives to take the older animals more easily,
and to provide a new crop of sweeter grass for the rising
generation of the forest, not only all the other individuals of
his own tribe, but whole tribes from other districts, are invited
to the hunting party and the feast and dance, or corroboree that
ensue; the wild animals on the ground being all considered the
property of the owner of the land. I have often heard natives
myself tell me, in answer to my own questions on the subject, who
were the Aboriginal owners of particular tracts of land now held
by Europeans; and indeed this idea of property in the soil, FOR
HUNTING PURPOSES, is universal among the Aborigines. They seldom
complain of the intrusion of Europeans; on the contrary, they are
pleased at their sitting down, as they call it, on their land:
they do not perceive that their own circumstances are thereby
sadly altered for the worse in most cases; that their means of
subsistence are gradually more and more limited, and their
numbers rapidly diminished: in short, in the simplicity of their
hearts, they take the frozen adder in their bosom, and it stings
them to death. They look for a benefit or blessing from European
intercourse, and it becomes their ruin.</p>

<p>If I had had a little more leisure I would have written more
at length and in a style more worthy of your perusal; but you may
take it as certain, at all events, that the Aborigines of
Australia HAVE an idea of property in the soil in their native
and original state, and that that idea is, in reality, not very
different from that of the European proprietors of sheep and
cattle, by whom they have, in so many instances been
dispossessed, without the slightest consideration of their rights
or feelings.</p>

<p>Indeed the infinity of the native names of places, all of
which are descriptive and appropriate, is of itself a prima facie
evidence of their having strong ideas of property in the soil;
for it is only where such ideas are entertained and acted on that
we find, as is certainly the case in Australia, Nullum sine
nomine saxum.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Friend,</p>

<p>Your's very sincerely,</p>

<p>JOHN DUNMORE LANG.</p>

<p>To Dr. Hodgkin.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>LAWS OF INHERITANCE AND TRESPASS. LINE OF INHERITANCE.</p>

<p>A father divides his land during his lifetime, fairly
apportioning it amongst his several sons, and at as early an age
as fourteen or fifteen they can point out the portion which they
are eventually to inherit.</p>

<p>If the males of a family become extinct the male children of
the daughters inherit their grandfather's land.</p>

<p>CERTAIN LAWS REGARDING ARTICLES OF FOOD.</p>

<p>The punishment of trespass for the purpose of hunting, is
invariably death, if taken in the fact, and at the very least an
obstinate contest ensues. If the trespasser is not taken in the
fact, but is recognised from his footmarks, or from any other
circumstance, and is ever caught in a defenceless state, he is
probably killed; but if he appears attended by his friends he is
speared through the thigh, in a manner which will be mentioned
under the head of punishments.</p>

<p>There are other laws intended for the preservation of food,
such as that which enjoins that:</p>

<p>1. No vegetable production used by the natives as food should
be plucked or gathered when bearing seed.</p>

<p>2. That certain classes of natives should not eat particular
articles of food; this restriction being tantamount to game laws,
which preserve certain choice and scarce articles of food from
being so generally destroyed as those which are more
abundant.</p>

<p>3. The law regarding the family kobongs, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Independent of these laws there are certain articles of food
which they reject in one portion of the continent and which are
eaten in another; and that this rejection does not arise from the
noxious qualities of the article is plain, for it is sometimes
not only of an innocent nature but both palatable and nutritious:
I may take for example the unio, which the natives of South-west
Australia will not eat because, according to a tradition, a long
time ago some natives ate them and died through the agency of
certain sorcerers who looked upon that shellfish as their
peculiar property.</p>

<p><a name="chapter12"></a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12. CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS.</h2>

<p>Laws relative to Deaths and Punishments.</p>

<p>SUPERSTITIOUS REVENGE OF NATURAL DEATH. The natives do not
allow that there is such a thing as a death from natural causes;
they believe that were it not for murderers or the malignity of
sorcerers they might live for ever: hence:</p>

<p>When a native dies from the effect of an accident or from some
natural cause they use a variety of superstitious ceremonies to
ascertain in what direction the sorcerer lives, whose evil
practices have brought about the death of their relative; this
point being satisfactorily settled by friendly sorcerers, they
then attach the crime to some individual, and the funeral
obsequies are scarcely concluded ere they start to avenge their
supposed wrongs.</p>

<p>MURDER.</p>

<p>If a native is slain by another wilfully they kill the
murderer or any of his friends they can lay hands on.</p>

<p>If a native kills another accidentally he is punished
according to the circumstances of the case; for instance, if, in
inflicting spear wounds as a punishment for some offence, one of
the agents should spear the culprit through the thigh, and
accidentally so injure the femoral artery that he dies, the man
who did so would have to submit to be speared through both thighs
himself.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF A CRIME COMMITTED.</p>

<p>The first great principle with regard to punishments is that
all the relatives of a culprit, in the event of his not being
found, are implicated in his guilt; if therefore the principal
cannot be caught his brother or father will answer nearly as
well, and failing these, any other male or female relatives who
may fall into the hands of the avenging party.</p>

<p>When therefore it is known among the natives that any crime
which calls for a very heavy measure of punishment has been
committed great and widespread consternation prevails; and when
it is further ascertained that the culprit has escaped everyone
in the remotest degree connected with him becomes filled with
anxiety, for it is impossible to tell in what direction the blow
will fall. The brothers of the criminal conceive themselves to be
quite as guilty as he is, and only those who are jee-dyte, or
unconnected with the family of the guilty person, believe
themselves in safety. Little children of seven or eight years
old, if, whilst playing, they hear that some murder has taken
place, can in a moment tell whether or not they are jee-dyte,
and, even at this tender age take their measures accordingly.</p>

<p>DUTY OF REVENGE.</p>

<p>The moment any great crime has been committed those who have
witnessed it raise loud cries, which are taken up by more distant
natives and are echoed widely through the woods. The nature of
these cries indicates who has been the guilty party, who the
sufferer, and those who are jee-dyte; whilst those who are
involved in the guilt direct one another by their calls to what
point to repair and muster their several forces: the culprit and
generally his brothers and near relatives seek safety in a
precipitate flight.</p>

<p>If a native has been slain his near male relations give way to
the most violent paroxysms of rage, and are forcibly held by
their friends to prevent them doing some injury to the
bystanders; they then go and confront the body of those who are
the relatives of the murderer, and a stormy altercation takes
place; this generally however is terminated in an amicable way,
by the parties uniting to go in search of the culprit. It is
obviously the interest of every one that he should be caught and
punished; for until this takes place the whole of his connexions
are in danger.</p>

<p>The holiest duty a native is called on to perform is that of
avenging the death of his nearest relation, for it is his
peculiar duty to do so: until he has fulfilled this task he is
constantly taunted by the old women; his wives, if he be married,
would soon quit him; if he is unmarried not a single young woman
would speak to him; his mother would constantly cry and lament
she should ever have given birth to so degenerate a son; his
father would treat him with contempt, and reproaches would
constantly be sounded in his ear.</p>

<p>PURSUIT OF A CRIMINAL.</p>

<p>Directly therefore the funeral ceremonies have been performed
the avenging parties start in pursuit of the murderer, and follow
his footsteps with rapidity and energy fitting so important an
occasion; unweariedly and relentlessly they press like
bloodhounds upon the track, and perform journeys of a great
length with a speed which would scarcely be credited; forgetting
in this instance their usual caution, they trespass on other
natives' ground, and all other passions and feelings appear to be
absorbed in a burning thirst for vengeance. They sleep at night
upon the track which they had been prevented by the darkness from
following further, and with the first pale light of morning
pursue it from the same point.</p>

<p>IMPLICATION OF A MURDERER'S FAMILY IN HIS CRIME.</p>

<p>When such energy is displayed success must of course often
follow, and the overtaken criminal then falls, pierced by many
spears; but should he elude his pursuers they wreak their
vengeance on any native they meet. The murderer has naturally
fled to the land of his friends to claim their hospitality;
sometimes this is afforded him, and sometimes he is treacherously
given up to his foes; but should the criminal escape, the
pursuing party rarely return from an excursion of this nature
without shedding blood: their not finding the guilty individual
only inflames still more their anger, which they wreak on
children or any unfortunate individual who may fall into their
hands.</p>

<p>BREACHES OF THE LAWS OF MARRIAGE. STEALING A WIFE.</p>

<p>Stealing a wife is generally punished with death. If the woman
is not returned within a certain period either her seducer or one
of his relatives is certain eventually to be slain.</p>

<p>BREACH OF MARRIAGE LAWS.</p>

<p>The crime of adultery is punished severely, often with death.
Anything approaching the crime of incest, in which they include
marriages out of the right line, they hold in the greatest
abhorrence, closely assimilating in this last point with the
North American Indians, of whom it is said in the Archaeologia
Americana:</p>

<p>They profess to consider it highly criminal for a man to marry
a woman whose totem (family name) is the same as his own, and
they relate instances when young men, for a violation of this
rule, have been put to death by their own nearest relatives.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Volume 2 page 110 quoting from Tanner's
Narrative page 313.)</blockquote>

<p>And again: According to their own account, the Indian nations
were divided into tribes for no other purpose than that no one
might ever, either through temptation or mistake, marry a near
relation, which at present is scarcely possible, for whoever
intends to marry must take a person of a different tribe.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Ibid.)</blockquote>

<p>The same feeling was remarked by Dobrizhoffer in South
America; for, speaking of an interview with a native tribe to
whom he was preaching, he says:</p>

<p>The old man, when he heard from me that marriage with
relations was forbidden, exclaimed, "Thou sayest well, father,
such marriages are abominable; but that we know already." From
which I discovered that incestuous connexions are more execrable
to these savages than murder or robbery.*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Account of the Abipones Volume 1 page
69.)</blockquote>

<p>PUNISHMENT OF SECONDARY OFFENCES. ORDEAL AND PUNISHMENT FOR
OTHER TRANSGRESSIONS.</p>

<p>Any other crime may be compounded for by the criminal
appearing and submitting himself to the ordeal of having spears
thrown at him by all such persons as conceive themselves to have
been aggrieved, or by permitting spears to be thrust through
certain parts of his body; such as through the thigh, or the calf
of the leg, or under the arm. The part which is to be pierced by
a spear is fixed for all common crimes, and a native who has
incurred this penalty sometimes quietly holds out his leg for the
injured party to thrust his spear through.</p>

<p>When a native, after having absconded for fear of the
consequences of some crime which he has committed, comes in to
undergo the ordeal of having spears thrown at him, a large
assemblage of his fellows takes place; their bodies are daubed
with paint which is put on in the most fantastic forms, their
weapons are polished, sharpened, and rendered thoroughly
efficient; at the appointed time young and old repair to the
place of ordeal, and the wild beauty of the scenery, the painted
forms of the natives, the savage cries and shouts of exultation
which are raised as the culprit dexterously parries, or by rapid
leaps and contortions of his body avoids the clouds of spears
which are hurled at him, all combine to form a singular scene to
which there is no parallel in civilized life. If the criminal is
wounded in a degree judged sufficient for the crime he has
committed his guilt is wiped away; or if none of the spears
thrown at him (for there is a regulated number which each may
throw) take effect he is equally pardoned.</p>

<p>But no sooner is this main part of the ceremony over than two
or three duels take place between some individuals who have
quarrels of their own to settle; after these combatants have
thrown a few spears some of their friends rush in and hold them
in their arms, when the etiquette on such occasions is to
struggle violently for a few minutes, as if anxious to renew the
contest, and then to submit quietly to superior force and cease
the combat.</p>

<p>NATIVE APATHY UNDER COMMON WOUNDS. ANECDOTE.</p>

<p>The natives pay but little regard to the wounds they receive
in duels or which are inflicted on them as punishments; their
sufferings from all injuries are much less than those which
Europeans would undergo in similar circumstances; this may
probably arise from their abstemious mode of life, and from their
never using any other beverage than water. A striking instance of
their apathy with regard to wounds was shown on one occasion in a
fight which took place in the village of Perth in Western
Australia. A native man received a wound in that portion of his
frame which is only presented to enemies when in the act of
flight, and the spear which was barbed remained sticking in the
wound; a gentleman who was standing by watching the fray regarded
the man with looks of pity and commiseration, which the native
perceiving, came up to him, holding the spear (still in the
wound) in one hand, and turning round so as to expose the injury
he had received, said, in the most moving terms, "Poor fellow,
sixpence give it 'um."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13. SOCIAL CONDITION AND DOMESTIC HABITS.</h2>

<p>POPULATION.</p>

<p>Several writers have given calculations as to the number of
native inhabitants to each square mile in Australia. Now,
although I have done my utmost to draw up tables which might even
convey an approximate result, I have found the number of
inhabitants to a square mile to vary so much from district to
district, from season to season, and to depend upon so great a
variety of local circumstances, that I am unable to give any
computation which I believe would even nearly approach the truth;
and as I feel no confidence in the results which I have obtained,
after a great deal of labour, I cannot be expected to attach much
importance to those which, to my own knowledge, have in several
instances been arrived at by others from mere guesswork.</p>

<p>NATURAL PERIOD OF LIFE.</p>

<p>With regard to the age occasionally attained by the natives I
believe very erroneous ideas have been prevalent, for so far am I
from considering them to be short-lived that I am certain they
frequently attain the age of seventy years and upwards. As they
themselves have no knowledge whatever of their age it is manifest
that merely speculative ideas upon this point must be useless;
the means therefore that I adopted to arrive at a probable
conclusion may be illustrated by an example: In the table I have
given of a family descending from two natives, Nardooitch, and
Kimbeyenung (Appendix A) the name of Yenna will be found as one
of Wundall's children; now (1840) Yenna is a young man of about
twenty years of age, and from the usual habits of the natives we
must allow that his father, Beewullo, was at least twenty-three
years old by the time he had married and had a child; such being
the case, Beewullo must now be about forty-three, and Jeebar his
father must by the same reasoning be about sixty-six, yet he is
alive and in perfect health, and his elder brother Nogongo is
likewise alive, and as upright as possible, although the
infirmities of old age are creeping on him. Nogongo must be now
at least sixty-eight years old, yet I have seen two other natives
who, by his and their own account, are older than he is; and on
making a calculation, in the way I have just done, to ascertain
their age, it appeared that one of them was sixty-nine and the
other seventy-one; so that, although probably none of these
estimates are quite correct, I still think that we are at liberty
to infer, from various instances of this kind, that the natives
sometimes attain a very advanced age; yet were these instances of
longevity contrasted with the great number of deaths which take
place during the period of infancy, there can be no doubt
whatever that the average duration of life amongst these savage
tribes falls far short of that enjoyed by civilized races. There
is however one species of death unknown to these barbarians and
that is suicide. I believe they have no idea that such a thing as
a person's putting an end to his own life could ever occur:
whenever I have interrogated them on this point they have
invariably laughed at me and treated my question as a joke.</p>

<p>CONDITION OF OLD AGE.</p>

<p>The period of old age must be as happy as any other time in
the life of a savage, if not more so. Aged men are always treated
with great respect; they rarely take a part in any fray; they are
privileged to eat certain kinds of food which the young men may
not touch; and they seldom appear to suffer much from the
infirmities and diseases to which the aged are generally subject
amongst us.</p>

<p>CONDITION OF YOUNG WOMEN.</p>

<p>Should a female be possessed of considerable personal
attractions the first years of her life must necessarily be very
unhappy. In her early infancy she is betrothed to some man, even
at this period advanced in years, and by whom, as she approaches
the age of puberty, she is watched with a degree of vigilance and
care which increases in proportion to the disparity of years
between them; it is probably from this circumstance that so many
of them are addicted to intrigues, in which, if they are detected
by their husbands, death, or a spear through some portion of the
body is their certain fate; indeed the bare suspicion of
infidelity upon their part is enough to ensure to them the most
cruel and brutal treatment. For these causes during youth they
are compelled, whether pregnant or not, to accompany their
husbands in all their excursions, and are thus subject to violent
and continued exercise and fatigue at periods when repose is
indispensable.</p>

<p>But even supposing a woman to give no encouragement to her
admirers, many plots are always laid to carry her off, and in the
encounters which result from these she is almost certain to
receive some violent injury, for each of the combatants orders
her to follow him, and in the event of her refusing throws a
spear at her. The early life of a young woman at all celebrated
for beauty is generally one continued series of captivity to
different masters, of ghastly wounds, of wanderings in strange
families, of rapid flights, of bad treatment from other females
amongst whom she is brought a stranger by her captor; and rarely
do you see a form of unusual grace and elegance but it is marked
and scarred by the furrows of old wounds; and many a female thus
wanders several hundred miles from the home of her infancy, being
carried off successively to distant and more distant points.</p>

<p>These various circumstances render miscarriages more frequent
amongst these uncivilized tribes than amongst European nations,
and the first years and bloom of a female generally elapse before
she has any children; but then a fresh cause exists to prevent
their having very large families, which is that, from the nature
of the food used by the natives, it is necessary that a child
should have good strong teeth before it can be even partially
weaned. The native women therefore suckle their children until
they are past the age of two or three years, and it is by no
means uncommon to see a fine healthy child leave off playing and
run up to its mother to take the breast.</p>

<p>The native women suffer much less pain during the period of
labour than Europeans; directly the child is born, it is wrapped
in opossum skins, and strings made of the fur of this animal are
tied like bracelets round the infant's wrists and ankles, with
the intention of rendering it, by some supernatural means, a
stronger and a finer child. They are always much prouder of a
male than of a female child.</p>

<p>AVERAGE NUMBERS AND PROPORTION OF BIRTHS.</p>

<p>Forty-one females, of whose families I have obtained (from
themselves and others) lists upon the accuracy of which I can
rely, had 188 children, or about 4.6 children each. The greatest
number born by any one female was 7, and only three had had so
large a family as this; but with the exception of one woman they
had all born more than one child. All those who were included in
this list were past the age of child-bearing at the time it was
drawn up.</p>

<p>To ascertain the proportion of male to female children I drew
up another list of 222 births, and out of these there were 93
females and 129 males, or about 1 female to every 1.3 males.</p>

<p>I have known four instances of native women having twins, but
I have never heard of a greater number of children at one birth.
Should a child be born with any natural deformity it is
frequently killed by its parents soon afterwards. In the only
instances of this kind which have come within my own knowledge
the child has been drowned.</p>

<p>LUNATICS AND IDIOTS.</p>

<p>Idiots are rarely found amongst the natives; in two cases I
however observed persons of very deficient intellect. Mad people
are unknown, and this very naturally, for very few freaks of
madness could be committed by a lunatic ere he would fall a
sacrifice to the violence and indignation of his fellows. Persons
of very delicate and feeble constitutions are also rare, as those
who survive the hardships to which they are exposed in their
childhood must possess an iron frame. The deaths amongst the
children, particularly during early infancy, are as far as I can
judge much more numerous in proportion to the number of births
than they are in civilized nations.</p>

<p>INFLUENCE OF POLYGAMY ON SOCIAL HABITS.</p>

<p>The social habits of the natives of Australia are necessarily
modified by the extent to which polygamy is permitted and
practised amongst them. The very unequal distribution of the
female sex, which arises from this cause, has rendered prevalent
the custom of stealing wives; and as women are of great value,
not only on account of the personal attachment which they might
be supposed to excite, but from the fact of all laborious tasks
being performed, and a great portion of the food of the family
being also collected by them, every precaution is taken to
prevent them from forming any acquaintances which would be likely
to terminate in their abduction.</p>

<p>A stern and vigilant jealousy is commonly felt by every
married man; he cannot, from the roving nature of their mode of
life, surround his wives with the walls of a seraglio, but custom
and etiquette have drawn about them barriers nearly as
impassable. When a certain number of families are collected
together they encamp at a common spot; and each family has a
separate hut, or perhaps two. At these huts sleep the father of
the family, his wives, the female children who have not yet
joined their husbands, and very young boys; occasionally female
relatives, who from some temporary cause have no male protector
with them, also sleep at this fire; but the young men and boys of
ten years old and upwards are obliged to sleep in their own
portion of the encampment, where they themselves, or more
generally, some of their mothers, build for them two or three
huts, in which those related within certain degrees of
consanguinity sleep together.</p>

<p>SOCIAL CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>When strangers are with a party upon a visit, if attended by
their wives, they sleep in their own huts, which are placed among
those of the married people; but if their wives are not with
them, or if they are unmarried, they sleep at the fire of the
young men.</p>

<p>MODE OF CONVERSATIONAL INTERCOURSE. MODE OF RECITING
EVENTS.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances is a strange native allowed to approach
the fire of a married man; in the daytime they hunt or occupy
themselves with the men, and at night they either sit at their
own fire, or that of the young men. Their huts being placed at a
little distance from one another, such an arrangement would
appear to put an end to anything like social intercourse or
conversation; but they have invented a means of overcoming this
difficulty by making a species of chant, or recitative, their
customary mode of address to each other. In an encampment at
night the young men recount to one another their love adventures
and stories; and the old men quarrel with their wives or play
with their children; suddenly a deep wild chant rises on the ear,
in which some newly-arrived native relates the incidents of his
journey, or an old man calls to their remembrance scenes of other
days, or reminds them that some death remains unavenged: this is
done in a loud recitative, and the instant it is commenced every
other sound is hushed. A native, while thus chanting, is rarely
or never interrupted, and when he has concluded another replies
in the same tone until the conversation, still conducted in this
manner, becomes general.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF JEALOUSY.</p>

<p>In the meantime individuals both male and female move about
from fire to fire, paying visits, and whispering scandal to one
another; but these visits are so arranged that none can approach
a fire to which, by the established usages of society, they have
not a right to go; the younger females however, who are much
addicted to intrigue, find at times opportunity to exchange a
word or a glance with some favoured lover, but woe to her if her
watchful husband should detect her in the act. A spear through
the calf of the leg is the least punishment that awaits her; and
if her husband feels himself strong enough, either from personal
skill or from the number of friends he has present, to inflict
punishment upon her paramour, he does it in the most summary
manner, throwing as many spears at his legs as he has an
opportunity of doing before others catch hold of him and prevent
his committing farther acts of violence. A good deal of tact is
required under these circumstances to ascertain whether a spear
can safely be thrown at a man or not; but I have remarked as a
general rule that a native, if irritated by another, invariably
throws a spear at him if he has a friend or brother near the
offender at the time; the chances then being that this friend or
brother will catch hold of the man attacked before he can throw a
spear in return. As for the poor female no one takes her part
whether she is innocent or guilty; the established and very
equitable law with regard to women being, "If I beat your mother,
then you beat mine: if I beat your wife, then you beat mine,"
etc. etc. So that by judiciously conducting arrangements a native
can spear one aggressor himself and get the other speared for him
without undergoing any personal trouble or inconvenience, or
without in the least suffering in her good graces.</p>

<p>DANCES.</p>

<p>Should it be the intention of the natives to have a dance the
arrangements are somewhat different. In this case the young men
retire early in the afternoon to some spot suited to their
purpose, where they paint and deck themselves out in the most
grotesque manner. After dark they return to the encampment near
which the dance takes place. At these entertainments the same
rules of etiquette are strictly observed: the females sit in a
group apart, generally behind the old men; the performers are on
the side of the fire opposite to them; in one or two dances the
women take a part in the song, but they never dance themselves,
nor are the young men allowed to approach them. It is all fair
for the dancers to do their utmost, by the arrangement of paint
and ornaments, to show off their personal attractions, and they
sometimes avail themselves of this privilege in the most
ludicrous manner; but they are permitted to hold no converse
whatever with any but their mothers and sisters.</p>

<p>CEREMONIES ON MEETING. CUSTOMS IN MEETING AFTER ABSENCE.</p>

<p>The ceremonies they observe at first meeting one another after
absence are remarkable. When a native and his wives enter an
encampment of friends whom they have not for some time seen, they
proceed straight to the hut of some relative or intimate friend
without bestowing even a glance upon any others whom they may
pass: having reached the hut the man at once seats himself at the
fire without taking the least notice of anyone in it, whilst his
wives crouch upon the earth at a respectful distance behind him,
keeping their eyes fixed upon the ground; solemn silence now
ensues, all countenances wear an unspeakable gloom and gravity
and all eyes are directed to the earth; in about ten minutes the
nearest blood relation of any individual who has died since the
stranger has visited his friends advances to him with a measured
pace, and without speaking seats himself cross-legged on his
thighs, under which he places his hands, at the same time
pressing his breast to the stranger's; thus seated they
mournfully avert their faces from one another and preserve a
perfect silence; no single word or sign of recognition passes
between them, and after they have remained thus seated for
several minutes the native who had come to announce the death
rises slowly and retires with the same gravity with which he had
approached; other males of the family now successively approach
the stranger, going through precisely the same ceremonies, none
of them venturing to interchange a single word with him.</p>

<p>This part of the ceremony having been completed, the nearest
female relative of the deceased approaches the stranger and,
throwing herself upon her knees before him, she embraces his
knees with her left arm whilst with the nails of her right hand
she scratches her cheek and nose until the blood drops from them,
at the same time raising the most piteous cries and lamentations.
After a few minutes she rises and approaches his wife and seats
herself on the ground in front of her; the two now encircle one
another with their left arms, resting their heads on each other's
shoulders, whilst they scratch their faces with their right hands
and cry and wail in a tone which excites in the minds of all who
hear them sensations of deep grief; indeed I know of no sound
(not even excepting the Irish howl) which so fully expresses the
passion of deep sorrow as this lament of the native women. When
their cry is completed the resident native woman rises from the
ground and slowly walks from the wife of the one who has returned
to the camp; the other female relatives of the deceased then
advance in turn, and go through the same form.</p>

<p>The returned absentee is now at liberty to speak, and some of
the party in recitative recount to him all the leading facts that
have occurred since their last meeting; they are however very
careful not to mention the name of the person who is dead, but
describe him by his attributes and family in such a manner as to
leave no doubt in the mind of the hearer; but to name aloud one
who is departed would be a gross violation of their most sacred
prejudices, and they carefully abstain from it.</p>

<p>CEREMONIES ON MEETING IN THE BUSH.</p>

<p>If natives meet in the bush the foregoing ceremonies are in
part observed: both parties at their first meeting sit down at a
distance from one another, preserving a profound silence and
keeping their eyes fixed on the ground; after a time one of them
commences a chant about himself and from what great family he has
sprung; they then approach one another, and if there is a death
to communicate the men press breast to breast, and knee to knee,
remaining for some time with averted faces, lost in melancholy
thoughts; when they separate the women approach and kneel,
scratching their faces and crying in the way I have above
described. Should no relative have died upon either side the men,
after rising up, approach one another and enter into
conversation; whilst the elder married females, if they like a
stranger, embrace him affectionately and give him a loud-sounding
kiss upon each cheek; on several occasions I have had to submit
myself, with as good a grace as I could, to this salutation.</p>

<p>In these casual meetings of natives it occasionally happens
that several women kneel together, crying and embracing the knees
of some old savage, who stands erect in the midst of the group,
with a proud and lordly air, whilst they cower to the earth
around him; sometimes they have children slung at their backs,
and these little things may be seen unconsciously playing with
their mothers' hair whilst this mournful scene is enacting.</p>

<p>PUNCTILIOS OF FORM.</p>

<p>Some old women are scrupulously punctilious about the
performance of all these matters of etiquette, attaching a degree
of importance to them which, in the eyes of civilized man,
approaches the ludicrous; but they look upon them in a very
different light. I have seen a number of these sticklers for form
kneeling round a little boy not more than six or seven years old,
lamenting most bitterly, the little fellow meanwhile preserving
in his countenance and bearing all the gravity and dignity which
a man could have exhibited.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14. FOOD AND HUNTING.</h2>

<p>ERRORS REGARDING SCARCITY OF FOOD OF NATIVES.</p>

<p>The mistake very commonly made with regard to the natives of
Australia is to imagine that they have small means of
subsistence, or are at times greatly pressed for want of food: I
could produce many almost humorous instances of the errors which
travellers have fallen into upon this point. They lament in their
journals that the unfortunate Aborigines should be reduced by
famine to the miserable necessity of subsisting on certain sorts
of food which they have found near their huts; whereas in many
instances the articles thus quoted by them are those which the
natives most prize, and are really neither deficient in flavour
nor nutritious qualities. I will give one remarkable example of
an error of this kind into which a traveller of great ability has
fallen; but this will only render palpable the ignorance that has
prevailed with regard to the habits and customs of this people
when in their wild state, for those who frequent European towns
and the outskirts of population are soon compelled by the force
of circumstances to depart, in a great measure, from their
original habits.</p>

<p>Captain Sturt, to whom I allude, says in his travels (volume 1
page 118):</p>

<p>Among other things we found a number of bark troughs filled
with the gum of the mimosa, and vast quantities of gum made into
cakes upon the ground. From this it would appear that these
unfortunate creatures were reduced to the last extremity, and,
being unable to procure any other nourishment, had been obliged
to collect this mucilaginous food.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The gum of the mimosa, thus referred to, is a favourite
article of food amongst the natives, and when it is in season
they assemble in large numbers upon plains of the character
previously described by Captain Sturt in order to enjoy this
luxury. The profusion in which this gum is found enables large
bodies to meet together, which, from their subsistence being
derived from wild animals and vegetables of spontaneous growth,
they can only do when some particular article is in full season,
or when a whale is thrown ashore. In order more fully to show how
little the habits of this people have been understood I may state
with regard to this very gum, called by the natives kwon-nat,
that about the time the above account was published by Captain
Sturt an expedition was sent out from King George's Sound in
Western Australia in order to discover what was the nature of the
article of food so loudly praised by them, and which they stated
was to be found in certain districts in great profusion; the
belief at that time being, from the accounts given of it, that it
could be only a new and valuable species of grain. The exploring
party did not attain their object, and to this day many of the
settlers believe the kwon-nat to be a kind of corn.</p>

<p>FOOD PLENTIFUL. VARIETIES OF IT IN DIFFERENT LATITUDES.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the natives live well; in some districts
there may at particular seasons of the year be a deficiency of
food, but if such is the case these tracts are at those times
deserted. It is however utterly impossible for a traveller or
even for a strange native to judge whether a district affords an
abundance of food or the contrary; for in traversing extensive
parts of Australia I have found the sorts of food vary from
latitude to latitude, so that the vegetable productions used by
the Aborigines in one are totally different to those in another;
if therefore a stranger has no one to point out to him the
vegetable productions, the soil beneath his feet may teem with
food whilst he starves. The same rule holds good with regard to
animal productions; for example in the southern parts of the
continent the Xanthorrhoea affords an inexhaustible supply of
fragrant grubs, which an epicure would delight in when once he
has so far conquered his prejudices as to taste them; whilst in
proceeding to the northward these trees decline in health and
growth, until about the parallel of Gantheaume Bay they totally
disappear, and even a native finds himself cut off from his
ordinary supplies of insects; the same circumstances taking place
with regard to the roots and other kinds of food at the same
time, the traveller necessarily finds himself reduced to cruel
extremities. A native from the plains, taken into an elevated
mountainous district near his own country for the first time, is
equally at fault.</p>

<p>VARIED WITH THE SEASONS.</p>

<p>But in his own district a native is very differently situated;
he knows exactly what it produces, the proper time at which the
several articles are in season, and the readiest means of
procuring them. According to these circumstances he regulates his
visits to the different portions of his hunting ground; and I can
only state that I have always found the greatest abundance in
their huts.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF OCCASIONAL WANT.</p>

<p>There are however two periods of the year when they are at
times subjected to the pangs of hunger: these are in the hottest
time of summer and in the height of the rainy season. At the
former period the heat renders them so excessively indolent that
until forced by want they will not move, and at the latter they
suffer so severely from the cold and rain that I have known them
remain for two successive days at their huts without quitting the
fire; and even when they do quit it they always carry a
fire-stick with them, which greatly embarrasses their movements.
In all ordinary seasons however they can obtain in two or three
hours a sufficient supply of food for the day, but their usual
custom is to roam indolently from spot to spot, lazily collecting
it as they wander along.</p>

<p>LIST OF EDIBLE ARTICLES.</p>

<p>That an accurate idea may be formed of the quantity and kinds
of food which they obtain, I have given below a list of those in
use amongst the aborigines of South-western Australia which I
have seen them collect and eat; and I will, in the order in which
they stand on this list, show the mode of obtaining them, and the
way in which they are cooked.</p>

<p>Different articles of food eaten by the natives of Western
Australia:</p>

<pre>
Six sorts of kangaroo.
Twenty-nine sorts of fish.
One kind of whale.
Two species of seal.
Wild dogs.
Three kinds of turtle.
Emus, wild turkeys, and birds of every kind.
Two species of opossum.
Eleven kinds of frogs.
Four kinds of freshwater shellfish.
All saltwater shellfish, except oysters.
Four kinds of grubs.
Eggs of every species of bird or lizard.
Five animals, something smaller in size than rabbits.
Eight sorts of snakes.
Seven sorts of iguana.
Nine species of mice and small rats.
Twenty-nine sorts of roots.
Seven kinds of fungus.
Four sorts of gum.
Two sorts of manna.
Two species of by-yu, or the nut of the Zamia palm.
Two species of mesembryanthemum.
Two kinds of nut.
Four sorts of fruit.
The flower of several species of Banksia.
One kind of earth, which they pound and mix with the root of the mene.
The seeds of several species of leguminous plants.
</pre>

<p>It will be necessary however before commencing this sketch to
give an outline of the weapons and implements with which the
different animals are caught and killed, and the vegetable
productions procured.</p>

<p>EQUIPMENT FOR A HUNT. IMPLEMENTS FOR DESTROYING ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The natives nearly always carry the whole of their worldly
property about with them, and the Australian hunter is thus
equipped: round his middle is wound, in many folds, a cord spun
from the fur of the opossum, which forms a warm, soft and elastic
belt of an inch in thickness, in which are stuck his hatchet, his
kiley or boomerang, and a short heavy stick to throw at the
smaller animals. His hatchet is so ingeniously placed that the
head of it rests exactly on the centre of his back, whilst its
thin short handle descends along the backbone. In his hand he
carries his throwing-stick and several spears, headed in two or
three different manners so that they are equally adapted to war
or the chase. A warm kangaroo skin cloak completes his equipment
in the southern portions of the continent; but I have never seen
a native with a cloak anywhere to the north of 29 degrees south
latitude.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION AND USE OF THE WEAPONS.</p>

<p>These weapons, although apparently so simple, are admirably
adapted for the purposes they are intended to serve. The spear
when projected from the throwing-stick forms as effectual a
weapon as the bow and arrow, whilst at the same time it is much
less liable to be injured, and it possesses over the bow and
arrow the advantage of being useful to poke out kangaroo-rats and
opossums from hollow trees, to knock off gum from high branches,
to pull down the cones from the Banksia trees, and for many other
purposes.</p>

<p>The hatchet is used to cut up the larger kinds of game and to
make holes in the trees the owner is about to climb. The kiley is
thrown into flights of wild-fowl and cockatoos, and with the
dow-uk, a short heavy stick, they knock over the smaller kinds of
game much in the same manner that poachers do hares and rabbits
in England.</p>

<p>CONTENTS OF THE WOMEN'S BAG OR WALLET.</p>

<p>Thus equipped the father of the family stalks forth, and at a
respectful distance behind him follow the women; a long thick
stick, the point of which has been hardened in the fire, is in
each of their hands, a child or two fixed in their bags or upon
their shoulders, and in the deep recesses of these mysterious
bags they carry moreover sundry articles which constitute the
wealth of the Australian savage. These are however worthy of a
particular enumeration, as this will make plain the domestic
economy of one of these barbarian housewives.</p>

<p>The contents of a native woman's bag are: A flat stone to
pound roots with; earth to mix with the pounded roots; quartz,
for the purpose of making spears and knives; stones for hatchets;
prepared cakes of gum, to make and mend weapons and implements;
kangaroo sinews to make spears and to sew with; needles made of
the shin-bones of kangaroos, with which they sew their cloaks,
bags, etc.; opossum hair to be spun into waist belts; shavings of
kangaroo skins to polish spears, etc.; the shell of a species of
mussel to cut hair, etc., with; native knives; a native hatchet;
pipe-clay; red ochre, or burnt clay; yellow ochre, a piece of
paperbark to carry water in; waistbands and spare ornaments;
pieces of quartz which the native doctors have extracted from
their patients, and thus cured them from diseases; these they
preserve as carefully as Europeans do relics. Banksia cones
(small ones) or pieces of a dry white species of fungus to kindle
fire with rapidly and to convey it from place to place; grease,
if they can procure it from a whale, or from any other source;
the spare weapons of their husbands, or the pieces of wood from
which these are to be manufactured; the roots, etc., which they
have collected during the day. Skins not yet prepared for cloaks
are generally carried between the bag and the back, so as to form
a sort of cushion for the bag to rest on.</p>

<p>In general each woman carries a lighted fire-stick, or brand,
under her cloak and in her hand.</p>

<p>DIFFERENT METHODS OF CATCHING KANGAROOS.</p>

<p>Imagining several parties of this kind, headed by one of the
young men, to be moving through the woods, let us follow them and
watch their mode of procuring and cooking their different
varieties of food.</p>

<p>MANNER OF HUNTING A KANGAROO SINGLY.</p>

<p>The moment an Australian savage commences his day's hunting
his whole manner and appearance undergo a wondrous change: his
eyes, before heavy and listless, brighten up, and are never for a
moment fixed on one object; his gait and movements, which were
indolent and slow, become quick and restless yet noiseless; he
moves along with a rapid stealthy pace, his glance roving from
side to side in a vigilant uneasy manner, arising from his
eagerness to detect signs of game and his fears of hidden foes.
The earth, the water, the trees, the skies, each are in turn
subjected to a rigid scrutiny, and from the most insignificant
circumstances he deduces omens. His head is held erect and his
progress is uncertain, in a moment his pace is checked, he stands
in precisely the position of motion as if suddenly transfixed,
nothing about him stirs but his eyes, they glance uneasily from
side to side whilst the head and every muscle seem immoveable;
but the white eyeballs may be seen in rapid motion, whilst all
his faculties are concentrated, and his whole soul is absorbed in
the senses of sight and hearing. His wives, who are at some
distance behind him, the moment they see him assume this attitude
fall to the ground as if they had been shot; their children cower
by them, and their little faces express an earnestness and
anxiousness which is far beyond their years; at length a
suppressed whistle is given by one of the women, which denotes
that she sees a kangaroo near her husband. All is again silence
and quietude; and an unpractised European would ride within a few
yards of the group and not perceive a living thing.</p>

<p>Looking about a hundred yards to the right of the native, you
will see a kangaroo erect upon its hind legs and supported by its
tail; it is reared to its utmost height, so that its head is
between five and six feet above the ground--its short fore-paws
hang by its side, its ears are pointed, it is listening as
carefully as the native, and you see a little head peering out
from its pouch to enquire what has alarmed its mother; but the
native moves not, you cannot tell whether it is a human being or
the charred trunk of a burnt tree which is before you, and for
several minutes the whole group preserve their relative position;
at length the kangaroo becomes reassured, drops upon its
fore-paws, gives an awkward leap or two, and goes on feeding, the
little inhabitant of its pouch stretching its head farther out,
tasting the grass its mother is eating, and evidently debating
whether or not it is safe to venture out of its resting place and
gamble about amongst the green dewy herbage.</p>

<p>Meantime the native moves not until the kangaroo, having two
or three times resumed the attitude of listening, and having like
a monkey scratched its side with its fore-paw, at length once
more abandons itself in perfect security to its feed, and
playfully smells and rubs its little one. Now the watchful
savage, keeping his body unmoved, fixes the spear first in the
throwing-stick, and then raises his arms in the attitude of
throwing, from which they are never again moved until the
kangaroo dies or runs away; his spear being properly secured, he
advances slowly and stealthily towards his prey, no part moving
but his legs; whenever the kangaroo looks round he stands
motionless in the position he is in when it first raises its
head, until the animal, again assured of its safety, gives a skip
or two and goes on feeding; again the native advances, and this
scene is repeated many times until the whistling spear penetrates
the devoted animal; then the wood rings with shouts; women and
children all join pell-mell in the chase; the kangaroo, weak from
the loss of blood, and embarrassed by the long spear which
catches in the brushwood as it flies, at length turns on its
pursuers, and to secure its rear places its back against a tree,
preparing at the same time to rend open the breast and entrails
of its pursuer by seizing him in its fore-paws and kicking with
its hind legs and claws; but the wily native keeps clear of so
murderous an embrace, and from the distance of a few yards throws
spears into its breast until the exhausted animal falls and is
then soon despatched; when, with the assistance of his wives, he
takes its forelegs over his left, and the hind legs over his
right shoulder, and totters with his burden to some convenient
resting place, where they can enjoy their meal.</p>

<p>HUNTING IN PARTIES IN THE BUSH.</p>

<p>The chase of the kangaroo conducted by a number of natives is
a much more lively and noisy affair, but it is not to my taste
nearly so interesting. When a single native hunts you see the
whole energy and perseverance of which a savage is capable called
forth, and his graceful movements, cautious advance, the air of
quietude and repose which pervade his frame when his prey is
alarmed, all involuntarily call forth your admiration and compel
you to murmur to yourself, "how beautiful, how very beautiful."
But where a party hunt there is more bustle and animation in the
scene; and this kind of hunting is called "Yowart-a-kaipoon," or
kangaroo-surrounding. The animals which are to be killed by a
party who proceed for this purpose are either surprised in a
thick bushy place, where they have retired to lie down in the
heat of the day, or else in an open plain; in the former case
they are tracked to their retreat, and the party then encircling
it first ascertain that they have not quitted it; as each native
takes up his position he gives a low whistle, and when the
blockade is completed they fire the bushes; the frighted animals
now fly from the flames in the direction of the open plains, but
no sooner do they reach the outskirts of the wood than the bushes
are fired in the direction in which they are running, and they
are driven back by loud calls and terrific cries, which augment
their terror, and they run wildly about; until, becoming maddened
by fear, they make a rush through the midst of their enemies, who
allow but few of their victims to escape.</p>

<p>IN THE PLAINS.</p>

<p>When kangaroos are surrounded upon a plain the point generally
chosen is an open bottom surrounded by wood; each native has his
position assigned him by some of the elder ones, and a great deal
of art and caution are sometimes required to gain it; for this
end they avail themselves of every inequality of the ground, of
every bush, of every shrub, and as there are so many witnesses of
their skill and cunning they put forth all their art to approach
as near the kangaroos as possible without disturbing them, and
thus the circle narrows in around the unconscious animals, till
at last some one of them becomes alarmed and bounds away, but ere
it has proceeded many yards its flight is arrested by a savage
with fearful yells; terrified it sits down with its frightened
comrades to look for a means of escape, but armed natives
brandishing their spears and raising loud cries come running in
upon them from every side; and ere the animals have recovered the
first moments of terror and surprise a slaughter has already
commenced, which seldom terminates before the greater number of
them have fallen.</p>

<p>These great public hunts or battues are conducted under
certain rules. The proprietor of the land must have invited the
other natives, and must be present himself, for should these
regulations be violated a very bloody fight is certain to take
place. The first spear which strikes a kangaroo determines whose
property the dead animal is to be; it being no matter how slight
the wound may have been; even if a boy threw the spear the rule
holds good, and if the animal killed is one which by their laws a
boy is not allowed to eat, then his right passes on to his father
or eldest male relation. The cries of the hunters, as they ring
through the ancient woods, are very expressive and beautiful,
each different intonation belonging to a particular period of the
hunt. And what renders them peculiarly effective is that, instead
of beginning as we always do with a soft aspiration, as in Hollo,
Ho, etc., their cries always commence with a harsh sound, as kau;
and this circumstance enables them to talk at a great distance so
as to be perfectly intelligible to one another. Sometimes in deep
wooded valleys I have heard gentle fairy-like sounds coming down
from the heights, and rendered so soft and sweet by distance that
one might readily have fancied them to be supernatural, yet the
natives with me readily understood them, and shouted back their
reply: this harsh commencement of their shout gives one also a
terrible start when surprised in a murderous attack.</p>

<p>HUNTING KANGAROO BY THE TRACKS.</p>

<p>Four other modes of taking kangaroos are practised by the
natives: these are, catching them in nets, in pitfalls, lying in
wait near their watering places until they come to drink, and
constantly following their tracks until the animals are so
wearied out that they will allow the huntsman to approach near
enough to spear them. Of these four modes the last two are the
most interesting, and the former is thus practised: in a dry
district, where numerous animals congregate from a great distance
to drink at a solitary water, the huntsman constructs a rude
shelter in which for hours he remains concealed and motionless
until the thirsty animals approach; kangaroos, cockatoos,
pigeons, and all other beings that run and fly are in this case
indiscriminately sacrificed, and the patient endurance of the
hunter is generally richly rewarded by the booty he obtains.</p>

<p>But the mode of tracking a kangaroo until it is wearied out is
the one which beyond all others excites the admiration of the
natives; this calls out every qualification prized by savages:
skill in tracking, endurance of hunger and thirst, unwearied
bodily exertion, and lasting perseverance. To perform this feat a
native starts upon the tracks of a kangaroo, which he follows
until he sights it, when it flies timidly before him; again he
pursues the track, and again the animal bounds from him; and this
is repeated until nightfall, when the native lights his fire and
sleeps upon the track; with the first light of day the hunt is
resumed, and towards the close of the second day, or in the
course of the third, the kangaroo falls a victim to its pursuer.
None but a skilful huntsman in the pride of youth and strength
can perform this feat, and one who has frequently practised it
always enjoys great renown amongst his fellows.</p>

<p>COOKING A KANGAROO.</p>

<p>Before they commence cooking the kangaroo an incision is made
round the base of the tail to the bone, and another incision skin
deep round the tip. The skin is then pulled away from the other
part with all the sinews of the tail attached to it, and these
are drawn carefully out and at once rolled round the dowuk, so as
to keep them stretched: their future use is either to sew cloaks
and bags, or to make spears.</p>

<p>Two modes of cooking the kangaroo are common; the first is to
make an oven by digging a hole in the sand, in which a fire is
lighted; when the sand is well heated and a large heap of ashes
is collected the hole is scraped out and the kangaroo is placed
in it, skin and all; it is then covered over with ashes, and a
slow fire is kept up above it; when sufficiently baked it is
taken out and laid upon its back; the first incision is made
directly down from between the forearms to the bottom of the
abdomen, the intestines are then removed, and the whole of the
juice or gravy is left in the body of the animal. This is
carefully taken out and the body is then cut up and eaten.</p>

<p>The other mode is simply to kill the kangaroo and then to
broil the different portions of it on the fire: certain parts are
considered great delicacies, and these the young men are
forbidden to eat; such are the blood, the entrails, and the
marrow. The blood is always carefully collected in one of the
intestines so as to form a long sausage and is afterwards eaten
by the most influential man present.</p>

<p>METHODS OF TAKING AND COOKING FISH.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing list that the smaller sorts
of fish eaten by the natives are very numerous: there are however
several kinds which from superstitious prejudices they will not
touch; amongst these are the Bamba, or stingray. I should here
observe that these prejudices are local, and I have seen them
reject at one portion of the continent articles of food which at
a distant part they will eat readily.</p>

<p>Three modes of taking fish are commonly practised: spearing
them; catching them by means of a weir; and taking them in a net.
A party of natives spearing fish in one of their large shallow
estuaries is an extremely picturesque sight; they follow all the
tortuous windings of the fish they are pursuing, as it darts
about in the water, with great rapidity; and, the object of their
pursuit being concealed from a distant spectator, they appear to
be running about in the sea and dashing up the foam for no
conceivable cause or reason. Notwithstanding the speed they are
running with and the smallness of the object, in striking they
rarely miss their aim. In deep rivers or in the sea the mode of
spearing fish varies according to the circumstances of the case;
sometimes it is done by diving, sometimes by sitting on a rock or
tree and watching them as they pass underneath; but in all cases
astonishment is excited to see the celerity and accuracy with
which the eye and hand act in the nicest unison.</p>

<p>Weirs are only constructed across places which are left nearly
dry at low-water, or when the floods subside; and the way in
which fish are taken in the net offers nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>METHODS OF COOKING FISH.</p>

<p>If the fish are not cooked by being merely thrown on the fire
and broiled they dress them in a manner worthy of being adopted
by the most civilized nations; this is called "Yudarn dookoon,"
or "tying-up cooking." A piece of thick and tender paperbark is
selected and torn into an oblong form; the fish is laid in this,
and the bark wrapped round it as paper is folded round a cutlet;
strings formed of grass are then wound tightly about the bark and
fish, which is then slowly baked in heated sand covered with hot
ashes; when it is completed the bark is opened and serves as a
dish: it is of course full of juice and gravy, not a drop of
which has escaped. Several of the smaller sorts of freshwater
fish, in size and taste resembling white-bait, are really
delicious when cooked in this manner; they occasionally also
dress pieces of kangaroo and other meats in the same way.</p>

<p>FEASTING ON A STRANDED WHALE.</p>

<p>A whale is the greatest delicacy that a native can partake of,
and, whilst standing beside the giant frame of one of these
monsters of the deep, he can only be compared to a mouse standing
before a huge plum-cake; in either case the mass of the food
compared to that of the consumer is enormous. It is impossible
for civilized man to enter into the feelings of the savage under
these circumstances, for he has never been similarly situated. He
never has had such a quantity of food that he doats on placed at
once before him; hence when a native proprietor of an estate in
Australia finds a whale thrown ashore upon his property his whole
feelings undergo a sudden revulsion. Instead of being churlishly
afraid of the slightest aggression on his property his heart
expands with benevolence, and he longs to see his friends about
him; so he falls to work with his wives and kindles large fires
to give notice of the joyful event.</p>

<p>This duty being performed, he rubs himself all over with the
blubber, then anoints his favourite wives, and thus prepared cuts
his way through the blubber into the flesh or beef, the grain of
which is about as firm as a goose-quill, of this he selects the
nicest morsels, and either broils them on the fire or cooks them
as kabobs by cutting them into small pieces and spitting them on
a pointed stick.</p>

<p>By and bye other natives come gaily trooping in from all
quarters: by night they dance and sing, and by day they eat and
sleep, and for days this revelry continues unchecked, until they
at last fairly eat their way into the whale, and you see them
climbing in and about the stinking carcase, choosing tit-bits. In
general the natives are very particular about not eating meat
that is fly-blown or tainted, but when a whale is in question
this nicety of appetite vanishes. I attribute this to their
disliking in the first instance to leave the carcase, and then
gradually getting accustomed to its smell; but whatever may be
the reason they remain by the carcase for many days, rubbed from
head to foot with stinking blubber, gorged to repletion with
putrid meat, out of temper from indigestion, and therefore
engaged in constant frays, suffering from a cutaneous disorder by
high feeding, and altogether a disgusting spectacle. There is no
sight in the world more revolting than to see a young and
gracefully formed native girl stepping out of the carcase of a
putrid whale. When they at last quit their feast they carry off
as much as they can stagger under, to eat upon the way, and to
take as a rarity to their distant friends.</p>

<p>MODE OF KILLING SEALS AND WILD DOGS.</p>

<p>Killing seals is, from the habits of these animals,
necessarily an exciting species of hunting in the southern and
western portions of the continent. It is only enjoyed by the
natives when they can surprise a seal upon the beach or in the
surf, or when they swim off to some of the small rocky islands
which are connected with the main by reefs, and are at no great
distance from it; they are themselves fond of this sport, and the
clambering about the wild rocks of their native shore, at one
time leaping from rock to rock, spearing fish that lie in the
quiet pools, in the next moment dashing into the boisterous surf
to spear a large fish, to battle with a seal, or to turn a
turtle, cannot but be an exhilarating occupation; and when to
this we add that their steps are followed by a wife and children,
as dear to them as ours are to us, who are witnesses of their
agility and prowess, and who, when the game is killed, will help
to light the fire in which it is to be cooked, and drag it to the
resting-place, where the father romps with the little ones until
the meal is prepared, and that all this takes place in a climate
so mild and genial that a house is not necessary, we shall
perhaps the less wonder that it should be so difficult to induce
a savage to embrace the customs of civilized life.</p>

<p>There is nothing peculiar in their mode of killing wild dogs;
puppies are of course the greatest delicacy, and are often
feasted on; they sometimes however save these in order to keep
them in a domesticated state, and in this case one of the elder
females of the family suckles them at her own breast and soon
grows almost as fond of them as of children. A dog is baked whole
in the same manner as a kangaroo; it is laid on its back in the
hole in the heated sand, and its nose, fore-paws and hind-paws
are left sticking out of the ashes which are scraped over it, so
that it bears rather a ludicrous appearance.</p>

<p>MODE OF KILLING TURTLE AND COCKATOOS.</p>

<p>The green turtle are surprised by the natives on the beach
when they come to lay their eggs, and are very rarely taken much
to the south of Shark Bay, but freshwater turtle are extremely
abundant, and are in high season about December and January. At
this time the natives assemble near the freshwater lakes and
lagoons in large numbers; these natural reservoirs are then
shrunk to their lowest limits from evaporation and other causes,
and are thickly overgrown with reeds and rushes. Among these the
natives wade with stealthy pace, so stealthy that they even creep
upon wild-fowl and spear them. The habits of the turtle are to
swim lazily along near the surface of the water, about half
immersed, biting and smelling at the various aquatic plants which
they pass, and turning their long ungainly necks in all
directions. When alarmed by the approach of a native the turtle
instantly sinks to the bottom like a stone, and its pursuer,
putting out his foot, the toes of which he uses to seize
anything, just as we do our fingers, gropes about with it in the
weeds, until he feels the turtle, and then, holding it to the
ground, plunges his hands and arms in and seizes his prey. I have
known two or three of them to catch fourteen turtle, none of
which weighed less than one, and many of them as much as two or
three pounds, in the course of a very short time.</p>

<p>These freshwater turtle are cooked by being baked, shell and
all, in the hot ashes; when they are done a single pull removes
the bottom shell, and the whole animal remains in the upper one,
which serves as a dish. They are generally very fat, and are
really delicate and delicious eating; the natives are extremely
fond of them, and the turtle season is looked forward to by them
as a very important period of the year.</p>

<p>BIRDS. Birds form a very considerable article of food for the
natives, and their modes of killing them are so various that it
would be impossible to enumerate them all. Emus are killed in
precisely the same manner as kangaroos, but as they are more
prized by the natives a greater degree of excitement prevails
when an emu is slain; shout succeeds shout, and the distant
natives take up the cry until it is sometimes re-echoed for
miles: yet the feast which follows the death is a very exclusive
one; the flesh is by far too delicious to be made a common
article of food, hence heavy penalties are pronounced against
young men and unauthorized persons who venture to touch it, and
these are invariably rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>KILLING COCKATOOS.</p>

<p>Perhaps as fine a sight as can be seen in the whole circle of
native sports is the killing cockatoos with the kiley, or
boomerang. A native perceives a large flight of cockatoos in a
forest which encircles a lagoon; the expanse of water affords an
open clear space above it, unencumbered with trees, but which
raise their gigantic forms all around, more vigorous in their
growth from the damp soil in which they flourish; and in their
leafy summits sit a countless number of cockatoos, screaming and
flying from tree to tree, as they make their arrangements for a
night's sound sleep. The native throws aside his cloak so that he
may not even have this slight covering to impede his motions,
draws his kiley from his belt, and with a noiseless, elastic step
approaches the lagoon, creeping from tree to tree, from bush to
bush, and disturbing the birds as little as possible; their
sentinels however take the alarm, the cockatoos farthest from the
water fly to the trees near its edge, and thus they keep
concentrating their forces as the native advances; they are aware
that danger is at hand but are ignorant of its nature. At length
the pursuer almost reaches the edge of the water, and the scared
cockatoos, with wild cries, spring into the air; at the same
instant the native raises his right hand high over his shoulder,
and, bounding forward with his utmost speed for a few paces to
give impetus to his blow, the kiley quits his hand as if it would
strike the water, but when it has almost touched the unruffled
surface of the lake it spins upwards with inconceivable velocity,
and with the strangest contortions. In vain the terrified
cockatoos strive to avoid it; it sweeps wildly and uncertainly
through the air, and so eccentric are its motions that it
requires but a slight stretch of the imagination to fancy it
endowed with life, and with fell swoops is in rapid pursuit of
the devoted birds, some of whom are almost certain to be brought
screaming to the earth.</p>

<p>But the wily savage has not yet done with them. He avails
himself of the extraordinary attachment which these birds have
for one another, and, fastening a wounded one to a tree, so that
its cries may induce its companions to return, he watches his
opportunity by throwing his kiley or spear to add another bird or
two to the booty he has already obtained.</p>

<p>MODE OF KILLING WILD-FOWL.</p>

<p>The various kinds of wild-fowl with which the rivers and
lagoons of Australia abound afford a never-failing supply of food
to the natives, and many are the arts to which they have recourse
to entrap these wary birds. During the period of the moulting
season they catch many black swans. Some of the young men lie for
hours in ambush on the banks until the unconscious swans have
ventured so far into shallow water that they can run round them
and cut off their retreat. When this auspicious moment arrives,
with loud shouts the men dash in, and whilst one party intercepts
the birds, so that they cannot get into the deeps, a second soon
runs them down. In the same manner they take the young cygnets;
and these I believe to be as good eating and as delicate an
article of food as any country can produce.</p>

<p>It is also an interesting sight to see the natives creep after
wild-fowl, and under cover of the reeds and bushes get so near
that they can either spear them or catch them with a noose. A
reedy lagoon lies at your feet, almost surrounded by rocky cliffs
and dusky woods; there are some small open spaces of water, but
generally it is so thickly overgrown with high reeds that it
looks rather like a swampy wood than a lake; in the distance you
see curling up a thin cloud of blue smoke, which indicates that a
native encampment is at hand. The forms of many wild-fowl are
seen swimming about among the reeds, for a moment caught sight
of, and in the next lost in the dusky green of the vegetation.
Every now and then a small party of them rise up, and after
winging their way two or three times round the lagoon, at the
same time giving a series of their quack, quack, which are loudly
responded to from the recesses of the reeds, they again settle
down in another part of it.</p>

<p>This circumstance and a few other signs induce a sportsman to
suspect that there is some mischief afloat, and his doubts are
soon set at rest: upon some bough of a tree, which stretches far
out over the water and thus affords its occupant a view of all
that is passing in the lake below, he sees extended the form of
an aged native, his white locks fluttering in the breeze; he is
too old to take a part in the sport that is going on, but watches
every movement with the most intense interest, and by well-known
signs directs the movements of the hunters, who may now be seen
creeping noiselessly through the water, and at times they appear
so black and still that even a practised huntsman doubts for a
moment whether it is a man or the stump of a tree which he looks
on. The natives are sometimes very successful in this kind of
hunting: I have known a single man spear or noose ten wild-fowl,
of different sorts, in an hour and a half or two hours' time.</p>

<p>One very dexterous feat which the natives perform is to kill a
bird as it flies from the nest. This is executed by two men, one
of whom, placing himself under the nest, throws a spear through
its centre, so as to hit the bird in the breast, which,
frightened and slightly wounded, flies out, and is then struck to
the ground by the dow-uk, which the other native hurls at it as
it quits the tree. They are such good shots with these short,
heavy sticks that pigeons, quails, and even the smallest birds,
are usually knocked over with them; and I have often seen them
kill a pigeon with a spear, at the distance of about thirty
paces.</p>

<p>MODES OF COOKING BIRDS.</p>

<p>Birds are generally cooked by plucking them and throwing them
on the fire, certain portions of the entrails being considered a
great delicacy: but when they wish to dress a bird very nicely
they first of all draw it and cook the entrails separately; a
triangle is then formed round the bird by three red-hot pieces of
stick, against which ashes are placed. Hot coals are also stuffed
into the inside of the bird, and it is thus rapidly cooked and
left full of gravy. Wild-fowl dressed in this way on a clean
piece of bark form as good a dish as I have ever eaten.</p>

<p>OPOSSUM HUNTING.</p>

<p>Opossum hunting is pursued either by day or during a moonlight
night. A stranger cannot but be favourably impressed with regard
to the quickness of a native in discovering whether or not an
opossum has ascended a tree. The savage carelessly walks up to
some massive trunk which he thinks bears a suspicious appearance,
his hands are placed thoughtlessly behind his back, whilst his
dark eye glances over the bark; suddenly it is for one moment
stationary, and he looks eagerly at the tree, for he has detected
the holes made by the nails of an opossum in its ascent; he now
seeks for one of these foot-marks, which has a little sand
attached to it, and gently blows the sand, but it sticks
together, and does not easily move away, this is a proof that the
animal has climbed the tree the same morning, for otherwise the
sand would have been dried up by the heat of the sun, and, not
being held together by dampness, would have been readily swept
away before his breath. Having by this examination of signs,
which an unskilled European in vain strains his eyes to detect,
convinced himself that the opossum is in some hole of the tree,
the native pulls his hatchet from his girdle and, cutting a small
notch in the bark about four feet from the ground, he places the
great toe of his right foot in it, throws his right arm round the
tree, and with his left hand sticks the point handle of the
hatchet into the bark as high up as he can reach, and thus forms
a stay to drag himself up with; having made good this step he
cuts another for his left foot, and thus proceeds until he has
ascended to the hole where the opossum is hid, which is then
compelled by smoke, or by being poked out, to quit its
hiding-place, when, the native catching hold of its tail, dashes
it down on the ground and quietly descends after it. As the
opossum gives a very severe and painful bite the natives are
careful to lay hold of it in such a manner as to run the least
possible danger of being seized by its teeth.</p>

<p>Opossum hunting by moonlight, excepting in the beauty of the
spectacle, offers no feature different from what I have above
described; the dusky forms of the natives moving about in the
gloomy woods and gazing up into the trees to detect an animal
feeding, whilst in the distance natives with firesticks come
creeping after them, is a picturesque sight, and it is also
pretty to see the dark body of the native against the moonlight
as he climbs the tree, forcing the poor opossum to retreat to the
very end of some branch, whence he is shaken off or knocked down
with a stick. The natives themselves like these moonlight
expeditions and speak with enthusiasm of them. They are
particularly fond of spearing fish at certain seasons of the
year, in which case they go along the shoal water with a light,
and proceed exactly in the manner still practised in Scotland and
Ireland.</p>

<p>CATCHING FROGS. METHOD OF TAKING SHELLFISH.</p>

<p>The season of the year in which the natives catch the greatest
quantity of frogs and freshwater shellfish is when the swamps are
nearly dried up; these animals then bury themselves in holes in
the mud, and the native women with their long sticks and long
thin arms, which they plunge up to the shoulder in the slime,
manage to drag them out; at all seasons however they catch some
of these animals, but in summer a whole troop of native women may
be seen paddling about in a swamp, slapping themselves to kill
the mosquitoes and sandflies, and every now and then plunging
their arms down into the mud, and dragging forth their prey. I
have often seen them with ten or twelve pounds weight of frogs in
their bag.</p>

<p>Frogs are cooked on a slow fire of wood ashes. They are then
held in one hand by the hind legs, and a dexterous pinch with the
finger and thumb of the other at once removes the lower portion
of the intestines. The remainder of the animal is then taken at a
mouthful and fairly eaten from the head to the toes.</p>

<p>The freshwater shellfish vary in size from that of a prawn to
a large crayfish; the smallest are the best, and when nicely
roasted there is no difference in taste between them and a
shrimp. It is worthy of remark that the natives in the
south-western part of Australia will not touch freshwater
mussels, which are very abundant in the rivers, whilst in the
north-western part of the continent they form a staple article of
food.</p>

<p>GRUBS AND WALLABIES.</p>

<p>Grubs are principally procured by the natives from the
Xanthorrhoea or grass-tree, but they are also found in
wattle-trees, and in dead timber; those found in the grass-tree
have a fragrant aromatic flavour and taste very like a nice nut.
Their presence in a tree is thus ascertained: if the top of the
tree is observed to be dead the native gives it a few sharp kicks
with his foot, when, if it contains any barde or grubs, it begins
to give, and if this takes place he pushes the tree over, and,
gradually breaking it to pieces with his hammer, he extracts the
grubs, of which sometimes more than a hundred are found in a
single tree.</p>

<p>Until the top of the tree is dead it is not a proper
receptacle for these animals. The natives are therefore in the
habit of breaking off the tops of the grass-trees on their land
at a particular season of the year in order that they may have an
abundance of this highly-prized article of food. If two or more
men have a right to hunt over the same portion of ground, and one
of them breaks off the tops of certain trees, by their laws the
grubs in these are his property and no one else has a right to
touch the tree. No mistake on this point can occur, for if the
top of the tree dies naturally it still remains in its original
position, whereas a native who thus prepares the tree knocks it
off altogether; an instance occurred at King George's Sound of a
native travelling between thirty and forty miles to lay a
complaint before the Resident that another had been guilty of
this unpardonable breach of honesty, and, notwithstanding it had
been clearly brought home to him, still stoutly refused to make
any amends.</p>

<p>When there is a grub in a wattle-tree its diseased state,
which produces excrescences, soon betrays this circumstance to
the watchful eyes of a native, and an animal much larger than
those found in the grass-tree is soon extracted; they seldom
however find more than one or two of these in the same tree.</p>

<p>Grubs are either eaten raw or roasted; they are best roasted
tied up in a piece of bark in the manner in which I have before
stated that they cook their fish. If the natives are taunted with
eating such a disgusting species of food as these grubs appear to
Europeans they invariably retort by accusing us of eating raw
oysters, which they regard with perfect horror.</p>

<p>HUNTING THE SMALLER ANIMALS.</p>

<p>The smaller species of animals are either caught by surprising
them in their seats or by burning the bush. A native hunting for
food has his eyes in constant motion and nothing escapes them; he
sees a kangaroo-rat Sitting in a bush, and he walks towards it as
if about to pass it carelessly, but suddenly, when on one side of
it, he stamps on the bush with all his force, and crushes the
little animal to death; should it be rapid enough in its
movements to avoid this blow he hurls his dow-uk at it as it
scampers off, and should he not hit it he runs after and tracks
it to some dead hollow tree, lying on the ground, in which it has
taken shelter, and with the aid of his spear, which is about ten
feet long, he draws it out.</p>

<p>Another very ingenious mode of taking wallaby and the smaller
kind of kangaroos is to select a thick bushy place where there
are plenty of these animals; the bushes are then broken down in a
circle round the spot where they intend to hunt, so as to form a
space of broken scrub about ten feet wide all round a thick bush,
they thus not only destroy the runs of the animals but form with
the fallen bushes a place which so embarrasses and entangles them
that they find great difficulty in passing it; indeed when these
preparations have been made the natives fire the bush and the
frightened animals, finding their runs stopped up, rush into the
fallen branches, where every jump which they make upon their hind
legs only involves them in greater difficulties, so that they
fall an easy prey to their pursuers.</p>

<p>Some of the smaller animals such as the dal-gyte, an animal
about the size of a weasel, burrow in the earth; these the
natives surprise when they are feeding or dig them from their
burrows. They are all cooked by having their fur singed off and
being roasted on the fire; to the taste of a native the skinning
a small animal would be an abomination, and I must really confess
that a kangaroo-rat, nicely singed and cooked by them, is not a
bad dish for a hungry traveller.</p>

<p>Although the natives could in many districts procure native
salt, and most certainly from its abundance cannot be
unacquainted with it, they never use it until they have seen
Europeans do so, and even then do not at first like it. They also
dislike mustard, sauces, etc., when they first eat them, and
indeed nothing can be more ludicrous than their grimaces are the
first time mustard is given to them upon a piece of meat.</p>

<p>ROOTS EATEN BY NATIVES. EDIBLE ROOTS AND SEEDS.</p>

<p>The roots eaten by the natives belong to the following
genera:</p>

<p>Dioscorea, two species.<br>
Haemadorum, several species, as the Mene, Ngool-ya, Mudja, etc.
etc.<br>
Geranium, several species.<br>
Boerhaavia, two species.<br>
Typha, two species.<br>
Orchis, several species.</p>

<p>RULES FOR GATHERING ROOTS AND PLANTS.</p>

<p>Some of these are in season in every period of the year and
the natives regulate their visits to the different districts
accordingly. Those plants which grow in a stiff soil cannot be
dug up by their implements without great difficulty in the heat
of the dry season, but those which grow in a loose sandy soil can
be obtained at all times. The natives have however a law that no
plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered; they
then call them (for example) the mother of Bohn, the mother of
Mudja, etc.; and so strict are they in their observance of this
rule that I have never seen a native violate it unless requested
by an European, and even then they betray a great dislike to do
so.</p>

<p>The abundance of these roots varies, of course, with the
nature of the soil, etc., but when there is a scarcity of any one
of them this is amply provided for by the abundance of others. In
the Province of Victoria, as already stated, I have seen tracts
of land, several square miles in extent, so thickly studded with
holes where the natives had been digging up yams (Dioscorea) that
it was difficult to walk across it. Again, in the sandy desert
country which surrounds for many miles the town of Perth, in
Western Australia, the different species of Haemadorum are very
plentiful.</p>

<p>GATHERING AND COOKING ROOTS. MODE OF COOKING AND PREPARING
THEM.</p>

<p>It is generally considered the province of women to dig roots,
and for this purpose they carry a long pointed stick which is
held in the right hand and driven firmly into the ground, where
it is shaken so as to loosen the earth, which is scooped up and
thrown out with the fingers of the left hand, and in this manner
they dig with great rapidity. But the labour in proportion to the
amount obtained is great. To get a yam about half an inch in
circumference and a foot in length they have to dig a hole above
a foot square and two feet in depth; a considerable portion of
the time of the women and children is therefore passed in this
employment. If the men are absent upon any expedition the females
are left in charge of one who is old or sick; and in traversing
the bush you often stumble on a large party of them, scattered
about in the forest, digging roots, and collecting the different
species of fungus.</p>

<p>The roots are eaten raw or roasted in the fire; in either case
they are, most of them, very good. Some have the taste of a mild
onion, and others have almost the taste and appearance of a small
English potato, but of these only a single root is attached to
each plant: the mene has rather an acid taste and when eaten
alone is said, by the natives, to cause dysentery; they never use
it in the southern districts without pounding it between two
stones and sprinkling over it a few pinches of an earth which
they consider extremely good and nutritious; they then pound the
mould and root together into a paste, and swallow it as a bonne
bouche, the noxious qualities of the plant being destroyed by the
earth.</p>

<p>Many other roots are pounded between flat stones into a paste
and are then made into a cake and baked. The two roots which
taste the best, when cooked in this way, are the jee-ta and
yunjid.</p>

<p>The former of these resembles in appearance and taste the
unripe seeds of Indian corn; it is in season in June and is
really very palatable. The latter is the root of a species of
flag, and consists of a case enclosing a multitude of tender
filaments, with nodules of farinaceous matter adhering to them.
These are collected into a mass by pounding the root, and the
cake formed from the paste is very nice. The natives must be
admitted to bestow a sort of cultivation upon this root, as they
frequently burn the leaves of the plant in the dry seasons in
order to improve it.</p>

<p>EDIBLE FUNGI AND GUMS.</p>

<p>The different kinds of fungus are very good. In certain
seasons of the year they are abundant and the natives eat them
greedily.</p>

<p>Kwon-nat is the kind of gum which most abounds and is
considered the nicest article of food. It is a species of
gum-tragacynth. In the summer months the acacias growing in
swampy plains are literally loaded with this gum, and the natives
assemble in numbers to partake of this favourite esculent. As but
few places afford a sufficient supply of food to support a large
assemblage of persons these Kwon-nat grounds are generally the
spots at which their annual barter meetings are held, and during
these fun, frolic, and quarrelling of every description
prevail.</p>

<p>POISONOUS NUTS.</p>

<p>No article of food used by the natives is more deserving of
notice than the by-yu. This name is applied to the pulp of the
nut of a species of palm which, in its natural state, acts as a
most violent emetic and cathartic; the natives themselves
consider it as a rank poison: they however are acquainted with a
very artificial method of preparing it, by which it is completely
deprived of its noxious qualities and then becomes an agreeable
and nutritious article of food. Europeans who are not acquainted
with this mode of preparing the nut, the stones of which they
find lying about the fireplaces of the natives, are frequently
tempted to eat it in its natural state, but they invariably pay a
severe penalty for the mistake. The following extract, from
Captain Cook's * first voyage, gives one instance of this:</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Volume 2 page 624.)</blockquote>

<p>The third sort, which, like the second, is found only in the
Northern parts, seldom grows more than ten feet high, with small
pinnated leaves, resembling those of some kind of fern; it bears
no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the size of a
large chestnut, but rounder. As the hulls of these were found
scattered round the places where the Indians had made their fires
it was taken for granted that they were fit to eat; however those
who made the experiment paid dear for their knowledge to the
contrary, for they operated both as an emetic and cathartic, with
great violence: still however it was not doubted but they were
eaten by the Indians, and, in order to determine this more
clearly, they were carried to the hogs, who might be supposed to
have a constitution as strong as the Indians, although the ship's
people had not. The hogs ate them indeed, and for some time
apparently without suffering any inconvenience, but in about a
week they were so much disordered that two of them died; the rest
were recovered with great difficulty. It is probable however that
the poisonous quality of these nuts may lie in the juice, like
that of the cassada of the West Indies, and that the pulp, when
dried, may be not only wholesome but nutritious.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>MODE OF RENDERING THEM INNOXIOUS.</p>

<p>The native women collect the nuts from the palms in the month
of March, and, having placed them in some shallow pool of water,
they leave them to soak for several days. When they have
ascertained that the by-yu has been immersed in water for a
sufficient time they dig, in a dry sandy place, holes which they
call mor-dak; these holes are about the depth that a person's
arms can reach, and one foot in diameter; they line them with
rushes and fill them up with the nuts, over which they sprinkle a
little sand, and then cover the holes nicely over with the tops
of the grass-tree; in about a fortnight the pulp which encases
the nut becomes quite dry, and it is then fit to eat, but if
eaten before that it produces the effects already described. The
natives eat this pulp both raw and roasted; in the latter state
they taste quite as well as a chestnut. The process which these
nuts undergo in the hands of the natives has no effect upon the
kernel, which still acts both as a strong emetic and
cathartic.</p>

<p>I have taken some trouble to ascertain if any traditional
notion exists amongst the natives which would in any way account
for their having first obtained a knowledge of the means by which
they could render the deleterious pulp of the Zamia nut a useful
article of food; but in this, as in all other similar instances,
they are very unwilling to confess their ignorance of a thing,
and rather than do so will often invent a tradition. Hence many
intelligent persons have raised most absurd theories and have
committed lamentable errors.</p>

<p>ROVING HABITS DEPENDANT ON FOOD.</p>

<p>The other kinds of food which I have mentioned on the list
scarcely require a particular description. They are collected by
the people as they rove from spot to spot, and are rather used as
adjuncts to help out a meal than as staple articles of provision;
several of them are however much liked by the natives, and they
always regulate the visits to their hunting grounds so as to be
at any part which plentifully produces a certain sort of food at
the time this article is in full season: this roving habit
produces a similar character in the kangaroos, emus, and other
sorts of game which are never driven more from one part than from
another. In fact they are kept in a constant state of movement
from place to place; but directly a European settles down in the
country his constant residence in one spot soon sends the animals
away from it, and although he may in no other way interfere with
the natives the mere circumstance of his residing there does the
man on whose land he settles the injury of depriving him of his
ordinary means of subsistence.</p>

<p>EDIBLE PRODUCTIONS VARY IN DIPFERENT DISTRICTS. COMMON RIGHTS
IN CERTAIN FOOD.</p>

<p>If the land of any native is deficient in any particular
article of food, such as, by-yu, mun-gyte (Banksia flowers) etc.,
he makes a point of visiting some neighbour whose property is
productive in this particular article at the period in which it
is in perfection; and there are even some tracts of land which
abound in gum, kwon-nat, etc., which numerous families appear to
have an acknowledged right to visit at the period of the year
when this article is in season, although they are not allowed to
come there at any other time. This is a curious point and might
throw some further light upon the subject of their families or
lines of descent.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the articles of food I have
enumerated in this chapter belong only to a particular district
of about two hundred miles in extent, for every degree of
latitude some articles would disappear from the list, whilst
other new ones would enter into it. For instance on the
north-west coast they eat a species of oyster (unio) the almonds
of the pandanus, wild grapes, guavas, the excellent fruit of a
species of capparis, and many other articles which are not known
upon the south-west coast; but these are procured and cooked in
the same manner as the articles which I have already enumerated.
My object being merely to give such an outline as would enable
the reader to understand well the mode of life of an Australian
savage, I did not think such particular details necessary as I
should have been led into, had I enumerated all the sorts of food
which I have seen eaten by the natives in Australia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15. SONGS AND POETRY.</h2>

<p>GENERAL PRACTICE OF SINGING. TRADITIONAL SONGS.</p>

<p>Like all other savage races the natives of Western Australia
are very fond of singing and dancing: to a sulky old native his
song is what a quid of tobacco is to a sailor; is he angry, he
sings; is he glad, he sings; is he hungry, he sings; if he is
full, provided he is not so full as to be in a state of stupor,
he sings more lustily than ever; and it is the peculiar character
of their songs which renders them under all circumstances so
solacing to them. The songs are short, containing generally only
one or two ideas, and are constantly repeated over and over again
in a manner doubtless grating to the untutored ear of a European,
but to one skilled in Australian music lulling and harmonious in
the extreme, and producing much the same effect as the singing of
a nurse does upon a child.</p>

<p>SONG OF AN OLD MAN IN WRATH. SCENE PRODUCED BY IT.</p>

<p>Nothing can give a better idea of the character of these
people than their songs. In England an elderly gentleman, who has
been at all put out of his way by encroachments and trespasses
upon his property, sits over his fire in the evening, sipping his
port and brooding over vengeance by means of the law; but the law
is tortuous, expensive, and uncertain; his revenge is very
distant from him; under these circumstances the more the elderly
gentleman talks the more irate he becomes. Very different is the
conduct of the elderly Australian gentleman. He comes to his hut
at night in a towering passion; tucks his legs under him, and
seats himself upon his heels before the fire; he calls to his
wife for pieces of quartz and some dried kangaroo sinews, then
forthwith begins sharpening and polishing his spears, and whilst
thus occupied, sings to himself:</p>

<p>I'll spear his liver,<br>
I'll spear his lights,<br>
I'll spear his heart,<br>
I'll spear his thigh,<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>After a while he pauses and examines the point he has been
working at; it is very sharp, and he gives a grunt of
satisfaction. His wives now chime in:</p>

<p>The wooden-headed,<br>
Bandy-legged,<br>
Thin-thighed fellows--<br>
The bone-rumped,<br>
Long-shinned,<br>
Thin-thighed fellows.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looks rather more murderous but withal more
pleasant, and as he begins to sharpen his second spear he chants
out:</p>

<p>I'll spear their liver,<br>
I'll spear their bowels,<br>
I'll spear their hearts,<br>
I'll spear their loins.</p>

<p>As he warms on the subject he ships his spear in the
throwing-stick, quivers it in the air, and imitates rapidly the
adventures of the fight of the coming day: then the recollections
of the deeds of his youth rush through his mind; he changes his
measure to a sort of recitative, and commences an account of some
celebrated fray of bygone times; the children and young men crowd
round from the neighbouring huts, the old gentleman becomes more
and more vociferous, first he sticks his spear point under his
arm and lies on his side to imitate a man dying, yet chanting
away furiously all the time, then he grows still more animated,
occasionally adjusting his spear with his throwing-stick and
quivering it with a peculiar grace. The young women now come
timidly up to see what is going on; little flirtations take place
in the background, whereat the very elderly gentlemen with very
young wives, whose dignity would be compromised by appearing to
take an interest in passing events, and who have therefore
remained seated in their own huts, wax jealous, and despatch
their mothers and aged wives to look after the younger ladies.
These venerable females have a dread of evil spirits, and
consequently will not move from the fire without carrying a
fire-stick in their hands; the bush is now dotted about with
these little moving points of fire, all making for a common
centre, at which are congregated old and young; jest follows
jest, one peal of laughter rings close upon the heels of another,
the elderly gentleman is loudly applauded by the bystanders, and,
having fairly sung the wrath out of himself, he assists in
getting up the dances and songs with which their evening
terminates.</p>

<p>INFLUENCE OF THEIR SONGS.</p>

<p>Is a native afraid, he sings himself full of courage; in fact
under all circumstances he finds aid and comfort from a song.
Their songs are therefore naturally varied in their form; but
they are all concise and convey in the simplest manner the most
moving ideas: by a song or wild chant composed under the
excitement of the moment the women irritate the men to acts of
vengeance; and four or five mischievously inclined old women can
soon stir up forty or fifty men to any deed of blood by means of
their chants, which are accompanied by tears and groans, until
the men are worked into a perfect state of frenzy.</p>

<p>NATIVE POETS.</p>

<p>A true poet in Australia is highly appreciated. Simple as
their songs appear, there are in them many niceties which a
European cannot detect; it is probable that what is most highly
estimated by this people is that the cadence of the song, and the
wild air to which it is chanted, should express well to their
ideas the feelings and passions intended to predominate in the
mind at the moment in which it is sung: hence we find that the
compositions of some of these poets pass from family to family,
and from district to district, until they have very probably
traversed the whole continent; the natives themselves having at
last no idea of the point where they originated, or of the
meaning of the words which they sing, successive changes of
dialect having so altered the song that probably not one of the
original words remains; but they sing sounds analogous to these,
to the proper air. And this is not confined to Western Australia,
for Mr. Threlkeld, in his Australian Grammar,* says:</p>

<p>There are poets among them who compose songs which are sung
and danced to by their own tribe in the first place, after which
other tribes learn the song and dance, which itinerates from
tribe to tribe throughout the country, until, from change of
dialect, the very words are not understood by the blacks.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Page 90.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A family seldom make a distant friendly visit to other tribes,
but they bring back a new song or two with them, and these, for a
time, are quite as much the rage as a new fashionable song in
England. Occasionally the songs also bear the name of the poet
who composed them, though this is not often the case; there are
however two or three poets in Australia who enjoy a great
celebrity, but whether they are living, or belonged to ancient
times, or whether they are merely imaginary beings I have never
been able to discover.</p>

<p>DISREGARD OF EUROPEAN MUSIC. NATIVE OPINION OF EUROPEAN
SINGING.</p>

<p>Their own songs are, according to their idea, the very
perfection of harmony, rude and discordant as they are to our
ears; perhaps no more extraordinary instance of the force of
habit and diversity of taste than this could be advanced. A
native sings joyously the most barbarous and savage sounds, which
rend asunder the refined ears of the European, who turns away in
agony from the discordant noise while the surrounding natives
loudly applaud as soon as the singer has concluded. But should
the astounded European endeavour to charm these wild men by one
of his refined and elegant lays they would laugh at it as a
combination of silly and effeminate notes, and for weeks
afterwards entertain their distant friends, at their casual
meetings, by mimicking the tone and attitude of the white man; an
exhibition which never fails to draw down loud shouts of
applause.</p>

<p>Some of the natives are not however insensible to the charms
of our music. Warrup, a native youth who lived with me for
several months as a servant, once accompanied me to an amateur
theatre at Perth, and when the actors came forward and sang God
save the Queen he burst into tears. He certainly could not have
comprehended the words of the song, and therefore must have been
affected by the music alone.</p>

<p>ADAPTATION OF DANCES TO THEIR SONGS.</p>

<p>The only accompaniment to their songs used in the southern
parts of the continent is the clapping of hands or the beating of
a short round stick against the flat board with which they throw
their spears; in this latter case the rounded stick is held in
its centre, between the fingers and thumb of the right hand, and
its ends are alternately struck against the flat board in such a
manner as to produce a rude kind of music, in time to the air
they are singing. Although this appears to be so very simple an
instrument it requires some practice to beat the time accurately,
and by young men who desire to have the reputation of being
exquisites this is considered to be a very necessary
accomplishment.</p>

<p>Some songs have a peculiar dance connected with them; this
however is not always the case, and I have occasionally seen the
same dance adapted to different songs.</p>

<p>Having given this general outline of their songs I will now
add such a selection of them as will convey some idea of the
character of their poetry, at the same time there is reason to
believe that a good deal of it is traditional, and may date its
origin from a very remote epoch. Some of their dances have also a
very peculiar mystical character about them, and these they very
unwillingly exhibit in the presence of Europeans.</p>

<p>The following is a very favourite song of the natives to the
north of Perth; it is sung to a wild and plaintive air, and
relates to some action of a native who lived in that part of the
continent, of the name of Warbunga. A little boy, a descendant of
his, is still living, who bears the same name.</p>

<p>SPECIMENS OF SONGS. EXAMPLES OF SONGS FOR VARIOUS
OCCASIONS.</p>

<p>Kad-ju bar-dook,<br>
War-bung-a-loo,<br>
War-bung-a-loo.<br>
Kad-ju bar-dook,<br>
War-bung-a-loo,<br>
War-bung-a-loo,<br>
War-bung-a-loo.</p>

<p>They then commence again, constantly repeating these words in
the same order.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>Thy hatchet is near thee,<br>
Oh Warbunga,<br>
Oh Warbunga.<br>
Thy hatchet is near thee,<br>
Warbunga-ho,<br>
Warbunga-ho,<br>
Warbunga-ho.</p>

<p>A favourite song of the natives in the district of the Murray
in Western Australia is:</p>

<p>Kar-ro yool, i, yool-a!<br>
Kar-ro yool, i, yool-a!<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>And these words they go on singing for an hour together, in
the event of the absence of any of their relatives or friends
upon a hunting or war excursion.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>Return hither, hither ho!<br>
Return hither, hither ho!</p>

<p>The following is a very good specimen of one of their comic
songs. It is often sung by the natives in the vicinity of King
George's Sound.</p>

<p>Mat-ta, mat-ta,<br>
Yungore bya,<br>
Mat-ta, mat-ta,<br>
Yungore bya,<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>Oh what legs, oh what legs,<br>
The Kangaroo-rumped fellows,<br>
Oh what legs, oh what legs,<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>FUNERAL CHANT.</p>

<p>Nothing can awake in the breast more melancholy feelings than
the funeral chants of these people. They are sung by a whole
chorus of females of all ages and the effect produced upon the
bystanders by this wild music is indescribable. I will give one
chant which I have heard sung upon several occasions.</p>

<p>The young women sing: Kar-dang.<br>
The old women sing: Mam-mul.<br>
Together: gar-ro.<br>
Me-la nad-jo<br>
Nung-a-broo.<br>
Kar-dang.<br>
Mam-mul.<br>
Together: gar-ro.<br>
Me-la nad-jo<br>
Nung-a-broo.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>My young brother<br>
My young son<br>
(again)<br>
In future shall I<br>
never see.<br>
My young brother<br>
My young son<br>
(again)<br>
In future shall I<br>
never see.</p>

<p>WAR-CHANTS. INFLUENCE OF SONGS IN ROUSING THE ANGRY PASSIONS
OF THE MEN.</p>

<p>In this chant the old and young women respectively sing "my
young son," and, "my young brother:" the metre and rhyme are also
very carefully preserved, and the word Kardang is evidently
expressly selected for this purpose; for were they speaking in
prose they would use a term denoting eldest brother, youngest
brother, second brother, or some similar one; whilst I have heard
the word Kardang always used in this chant whether the deceased
was the first, second, or third brother.</p>

<p>The men have also certain war-chants or songs; these they sing
as they go walking rapidly to and fro, quivering their spears in
order to work themselves up into a passion. The following is a
very common one:</p>

<p>Yu-do dan-na,<br>
Nan-do dan-na,<br>
My-eree dan-na,<br>
Goor-doo dan-na,<br>
Boon-gal-la dan-na,<br>
Gonog-o dan-na,<br>
Dow-al dan-na,<br>
Nar-ra dan-na.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>Spear his forehead,<br>
Spear his breast,<br>
Spear his liver,<br>
Spear his heart,<br>
Spear his loins,<br>
Spear his shoulder,<br>
Spear his thigh,<br>
Spear his ribs,<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Thus rapidly enumerating all the parts in which they intend to
strike their enemies.</p>

<p>It is very rarely that any remarkable circumstance occurs but
songs are composed in order to perpetuate the remembrance of it.
For example, when Miago, the first native who ever quitted Perth,
was taken away in H.M. surveying vessel Beagle in 1838, the
following song was composed by a native and was constantly sung
by his mother (at least so she says) during his absence, and it
has ever since been a great favourite:</p>

<p>Ship bal win-jal bat-tar-dal gool-an-een,<br>
Ship bal win-jal bat-tar-dal gool-an-een.<br>
etc. etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Whither is that lone ship wandering,<br>
Whither is that lone ship wandering,<br>
etc. etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Again, on Miago's safe return, the song given below was
composed by a native after he had heard Miago recount his
adventures:</p>

<p>Kan-de maar-o, kan-de maar-a-lo,<br>
Tsail-o mar-ra, tsail-o mar-ra-lo.<br>
etc. etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Unsteadily shifts the wind-o, unsteadily shifts the wind-o,
The sails-o handle, the sails-o handle-ho.</p>

<p>I will now add several other songs which are composed in
different dialects; these will serve both as examples of their
metre and style of poetry and as specimens for the purpose of
comparison with the songs of the natives of the other portions of
the continent.</p>

<p>Number 1.</p>

<p>One voice:<br>
Djal-lee-lee-na.</p>

<p>Chorus:<br>
Mong-a-da, mong-a-da,<br>
Mong-a-da, mong-a-da,<br>
Mong-a-da, mong-a-da.</p>

<p>One voice:<br>
Eee-dal-lee-na.</p>

<p>Chorus:<br>
Wun-a-da, wun-a-da,<br>
Wun-a-da, wun-a-da,<br>
Wun-a-da, wun-a-da.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>They all join in the chorus of:</p>

<p>Mong-a-da, etc. etc.<br>
Wun-a-da, etc. etc.</p>

<p>And clap their hands in time to the air to which this chorus
is sung, so that the effect produced is very good. I am unable to
render this song into English.</p>

<p>Number 2.</p>

<p>Dow-al nid-ja kotiay bool-a,<br>
Woor-ar wur-rang-een,<br>
Dow-al nid-ja kotiay bool-a,<br>
Woor-ar wur-rang-een<br>
Dow-al nid-ja kotiay bool-a,<br>
Woor-ar wur-rang-een.</p>

<p>These lines are repeated three times more, and then follows
the chorus:</p>

<p>Chorus:<br>
Ban-yee wur-rang-een,<br>
Koong-arree, wur-rang-een,<br>
Ban-yee wur-rang-een,<br>
Koong-arree, war-rang-een.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Number 3.</p>

<p>Kat-ta ga-roo,<br>
Ngia<br>
Bur-na-ri-noo.<br>
Yar-dig-o-roo,<br>
Ngia<br>
Bur-na-ri-noo.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Number 4.</p>

<p>Yerib-a-balo, may-il boyne ga-ree,<br>
Yerib-a-balo, may-il boyne ga-ree.<br>
etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Number 5.</p>

<p>Mar-ra boor-ba, boor-ba nung-a,<br>
Mar-ra gul-ga, gul-ga nung-a.</p>

<p>SONGS AND EXTEMPORANEOUS CHANTS.</p>

<p>These songs give however no idea of the manner in which they
chant forth their feelings. When irritated by any passionate
emotions they then pour out with the greatest volubility torrents
of reproach, all in a measured cadence and with at least the same
number of syllables in each line, but even the rhyme is generally
preserved; the two following translations of chants of this sort
are rendered as literally into English as the great difference
between the languages permits.</p>

<p>CHANTS OF JEALOUSY AND REPROACH.</p>

<p>The reader must imagine a little hut, formed of sticks fixed
slanting into the ground with pieces of bark resting against
them, so as to form a rude shelter from the wind; underneath this
were seated round a fire five persons--an old man, and his four
wives; one of these was considerably younger than the others, and
being a new acquisition, all but herself were treated with cold
neglect. One of her rivals had resolved not to submit patiently
to this, and when she saw her husband's cloak spread to form a
couch for the newcomer she commenced chanting as follows,
addressing old Weer-ang her husband:</p>

<p>Wherefore came you, Weerang,<br>
In my beauty's pride,<br>
Stealing cautiously<br>
Like the tawny boreang,*<br>
On an unwilling bride.<br>
'Twas thus you stole me<br>
From one who loved me tenderly:<br>
A better man he was than thee,<br>
Who having forced me thus to wed,<br>
Now so oft deserts my bed.</p>

<p>Yang, yang, yang, yoh--</p>

<p>Oh where is he who won<br>
My youthful heart,<br>
Who oft used to bless,<br>
And call me loved one:<br>
You Weerang tore apart,<br>
From his fond caress,<br>
Her, whom you now desert and shun;<br>
Out upon thee faithless one:<br>
Oh may the Boyl-yas** bite and tear,<br>
Her, whom you take your bed to share.</p>

<p>Yang, yang, yang, yoh--</p>

<p>Wherefore does she slumber<br>
Upon thy breast,<br>
Once again to-night,<br>
Whilst I must number<br>
Hours of sad unrest,<br>
And broken plight.<br>
Is it for this that I rebuke<br>
Young men, who dare at me to look?<br>
Whilst she, replete with arts and wiles,<br>
Dishonours you and still beguiles.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Boreang is the word for a male native
dog.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(**Footnote. Boyl-ya is the native name for a
sorcerer.)</blockquote>

<p>This attack upon her character was more than the younger
female could be expected to submit to, she therefore in return
chanted:</p>

<p>Oh, you lying, artful one,<br>
Wag away your dirty tongue,<br>
I have watched your tell-tale eyes,<br>
Beaming love without disguise:<br>
I've seen young Imbat nod and wink,<br>
Oftener perhaps than you may think.</p>

<p>What further she might have said I know not; but a blow upon
the head from her rival, which was given with the stick the women
dig up the roots with, brought on a general engagement, and the
dispute was finally settled by the husband beating several of his
wives severely about the head with a hammer.</p>

<p>The ferocity of the women when they are excited exceeds that
of the men; they deal dreadful blows at one another with their
long sticks, and if ever the husband is about to spear or beat
one of his wives the others are certain to set on her and treat
her with great inhumanity.</p>

<p>CHANT EXCITING TO REVENGE.</p>

<p>The next translation is that of a chant sung by an old woman
to incite the men to avenge the death of a young man who died
from a natural cause, but whose death she attributed to
witchcraft and sorcery; the natives, who listened to her
attentively, called her chanting goranween, or abusing. She stood
with her legs wide apart, waving her wanna, or long digging stick
in the air, and rocking her body to and fro, whilst her
kangaroo-skin cloak floated behind her in the wind. She was thus
quite the beau ideal of a witch. The following is the sense of
the words she used, at least as nearly as it is possible to
express their force and meaning in English.</p>

<p>The blear-eyed sorcerers of the north,<br>
Their vile enchantments sung and wove,<br>
And in the night they issued forth,<br>
A direful people-eating drove.<br>
Feasting on our loved one,<br>
With gore-dripping teeth and tongue,<br>
The wretches sat, and gnawed, and ate,<br>
Whilst their victim soundly slept.</p>

<p>Yho, yang, yho yang, yang yho.</p>

<p>Aye--unconsciously he rested<br>
In a slumber too profound;<br>
The vile boyl-yas sat and feasted<br>
On the victim they had bound<br>
In resistless lethargy.<br>
Mooli-go, our dear young brother,<br>
Where is another like to thee?<br>
Tenderly loved by thy mother,<br>
We again shall never see<br>
Mooli-go, our dear young brother,</p>

<p>Yho, yang yho, ho, ho.</p>

<p>Men, who ever bold have been,<br>
Are your long spears sharpened well?<br>
Is the keen quartz fixed anew?<br>
Let each shaft upon them tell.<br>
Poise your meer-ros long and true:<br>
Let the kileys whiz and whirl<br>
In strange contortions through the air;<br>
Heavy dow-uks at them hurl;<br>
Shout the yell they dread to hear.<br>
Let the young men leap on high,<br>
To avoid the quivering spear;<br>
Light of limb, and quick of eye,<br>
Who sees well has nought to fear.<br>
Let them shift, and let them leap,<br>
When the quick spear whistling flies;<br>
Woe to him who cannot leap!<br>
Woe to him who has bad eyes!</p>

<p>FEMALE ENERGY IN CHANTING.</p>

<p>When one of these old hags has entered upon a chant of this
kind nothing but complete exhaustion induces her to stop, and the
instant she pauses another takes up the burden of her song. The
effect some of them produce upon the assembled men is very great;
in fact these addresses of the old women are the cause of most of
the disturbances which take place. The above translations,
without being exactly literal, are as near the original as I
could render them. As they are entirely uttered on the spur of
the moment there is generally abundant evidence of passion and
feeling about them; and although I might have added a great
variety, I think that the above will give the English reader as
good an idea of the peculiar mode of address of this people as it
is in my power to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16. FUNERAL CEREMONIES, SUPERSTITIONS, AND REMARKABLE
CUSTOMS.</h2>

<p>DEATH AND BURIAL OF A NATIVE NEAR PERTH.</p>

<p>Friday June 14 1839.</p>

<p>Yenna came to me this afternoon to tell me that Mulligo was
now so ill there was but little chance of his living for many
hours longer, and further to request that I would accompany him
to see the sufferer. Nearly two months had elapsed since Mulligo
had severely injured his spine by a fall from a tree; and
immediately after the occurrence of this accident he had
completely lost the use of his lower extremities, and had day by
day declined until he was now reduced to a perfect skeleton. I
was therefore but little surprised at the intelligence which
Yenna brought me; and as I was anxious to see the ceremonies that
would accompany his last moments I at once started for the native
encampment.</p>

<p>CONTENTION FOR MULLIGO'S WIDOWS.</p>

<p>Mulligo was a Ngotak and had two wives, Kokoobung and
Mugarwit, both of the Ballaroke family, and neither of them
deficient either in youth, or in such personal charms as find
favour in the eyes of the natives. I anticipated therefore that
from some quarter or the other objections would be raised to
allowing Miago, the uterine brother of Mulligo (and therefore
also a Ngotak) to carry off unmolested two such attractive young
widows. According to native custom however they of right, upon
their husband's death, became the wives of Miago.</p>

<p>On approaching the point where Mulligo was lying, distant
about a mile from Perth, I found that my anticipations were
correct. I fell in with the encampment of the friends of a native
named Bennyyowlee, of the Tdondarup family. This native had
signified his intention of asserting his claims to the possession
of one of these young women, and even some of Miago's friends
were disposed to favour him. Bennyyowlee was absent at the
Canning River with a party of natives for the purpose of
procuring spears, and thus preparing himself for coming events.
His friends however had constructed their huts within a few
hundred yards of those of Mulligo's relatives, so that in the
event of the arrival of the Murraymen, who they were apprehensive
would make an attempt to carry off Mulligo's wives, they might be
able to assist Miago in his endeavours to prevent such an
outrage, whilst at the same time their proximity to his party
enabled them to see that no foul play took place.</p>

<p>As I passed them they endeavoured to impress upon my mind that
one wife was enough for Miago, and that if he surrendered the
other to Bennyyowlee they would assist him against the Murraymen.
I however resolved not to interfere in the business, and thus
telling them I bent my steps to the other encampment.</p>

<p>DYING SCENE IN HIS TENT.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found poor Mulligo sinking fast; his two wives
and his mother were watching by his side. He just recognised me,
and faintly and slowly said, "men-dyke boola nganya" (I am very
ill.) The native women near him were much alarmed because he
could not swallow, and to support him were slowly dropping water
into his ear. His last moment was evidently near at hand, and,
after having felt his pulse and paid him a few little attentions,
which always gratify them much, I turned away to examine the
dispositions of the encampment.</p>

<p>I found that Miago's hut was close to Mulligo's, and he
himself was present, ready to assert his right to the wives of
his dying brother should anyone appear to dispute his claims; he
was evidently well supported, for the Nagarnook family mustered
strong around his hut, and the two half-brothers of one of the
ladies in dispute were members of it. Weyup, the half-brother of
the other native girl, was also present, and therefore evidently
favoured Miago's cause. They were all in anxious expectation of
the return of Moorroongo, who had gone off with a party for the
purpose of cutting spears, with which the friends of his stepson
(Miago) might be able to act either offensively or defensively as
circumstances should require. As I conceived that there was every
possibility of Mulligo's having sufficient strength left to
linger through the night, and as the evening was fast closing in,
after a little casual conversation with the natives I returned
home.</p>

<p>MOURNING WOMEN. THEIR SONGS AND CEREMONIES.</p>

<p>June 15.</p>

<p>Soon after daybreak I reached the entrance of Mulligo's hut:
he was alive but his respiration was scarcely visible. His head
rested on his mother's knees, and her withered breasts now rested
on his lips as she leant crying over him; other women were seated
round, their heads all verging to a common centre over the wasted
frame of the dying man; they were crying bitterly and scratching
their cheeks, foreheads, and noses with their nails until the
blood trickled slowly from the wounds. The men in the front of
the huts were busied in finishing off their spears, ready for the
coming fight.</p>

<p>I stood for some time watching the mournful scene, but other
native females soon began to arrive; they came up in small
parties, generally by threes, marching slowly forward with their
wan-nas (a long stick they use for digging up roots) in their
hands; the eldest female walked first, and when they approached
within about thirty or forty yards of the hut in which the dying
man lay they raised the most piteous cries, and, hurrying their
pace, moved rapidly towards the point where the other women were
seated, recalling the custom alluded to by Jeremiah (9:17, 18)
Call for the wailing women that they may come, and let them make
haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down
with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>

<p>CEREMONY ON MULLIGO'S DEATH.</p>

<p>As they came up to the bark hut many of them struck it
violently with their wan-nas, producing by the blow a dull hollow
sound; they then seated themselves in the circle, scratching
their faces and joining in mournful chants, of which the one
already given above was that most frequently uttered, and which,
as I sat by the young men's fire, they slowly repeated to me.</p>

<p>The female relatives standing in the relation of mothers to
Mulligo, sang:</p>

<p>Mam-mul, Mam-mul,<br>
My son, my son.</p>

<p>Those in the relation of sister, sang:</p>

<p>Kar-dang, kar-dang.</p>

<p>And the next part was sung indifferently by both of them:</p>

<p>Garro. Nad-joo,<br>
Meela,<br>
Nung-a-broo.</p>

<p>Again, I shall<br>
Not see in future.</p>

<p>Then one of the women, having worked herself to a pitch of
frenzy, would now and then start up and, standing in front of the
hut whilst she waved her wan-na violently in the air, would chant
forth dire imprecations against certain boyl-yas, or magicians,
or rather wizards, who she believed to be the cause of the death
of poor Mulligo. Whilst thus chanting she faced and addressed her
words to the men who were grouped around their huts, and it was
strange to see the various effects produced on their minds by
these harangues working in their savage countenances: one while
they sat in mournful silence; again they grasped firmly and
quivered their spears; and by-and-bye a general "Ee-Ee"
(pronounced in their throat with the lips closed) burst forth as
sign of approbation at some affecting part of the speech.</p>

<p>Time wore on. Each withered beldame by turns addressed the
party, whilst the poor wretch, the tranquillity of whose dying
moments was interrupted by these scenes, gradually sank. At last
the vital spark departed, and that moment an old woman started
up, mad with grief and rage, tore the hut in which he had lain to
atoms, saying, "this is now no good;"* and then poured forth a
wild strain of imprecations against the before-mentioned
boyl-yas.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Burckhardt remarked a similar custom
among the Bedouin Arabs. He says: If the deceased have not left
any male heir, or that the whole property is transferred to
another family, or if his heir is a minor, and goes to live with
his uncle or some other relative, the tent posts are torn up
immediately after the man has expired, and the tent is
demolished. Travels in Arabia page 58.)</blockquote>

<p>As she proceeded the men became more and more excited, and at
last Moondee, the most violent of them, started forward and was
on the point of spearing one of Mulligo's wives; none of the men
attempted to interfere with him; but, as I anticipated, the women
seized him, and held him, so as to prevent him from executing his
purpose. This conduct on his part at first appeared to me to
arise from passion alone, but the reason of it was soon
explained.</p>

<p>SUPPOSED CAUSE OF HIS DECEASE.</p>

<p>It appears that some two or three months before this period
Weenat, a native of the upper part of the Swan, had stolen a
cloak belonging to Miago, Mulligo's brother, and had, according
to their belief, from malicious motives given this cloak to one
of the native sorcerers, or boyl-yas, who by this means acquired
some mysterious power over either Miago or his brother, but
selected the latter for his victim, when he fell and broke his
back. Another of these boyl-yas (according to the usual custom)
was called in to give his advice, and he applied fire to the
injured part. This treatment not succeeding, and the poor fellow
wasting daily away, the natives became convinced that the
unfriendly boyl-yas were in the habit of rendering themselves
invisible, and nightly descending for the purpose of feasting on
poor Mulligo's flesh whilst he slept, and being under the
influence of a charm he was not aware of what was taking place;
but Moondee chose to imagine that if his wife had been more
vigilant the boyl-yas might have been detected, and hence
intended to spear her in the leg as a punishment for her imputed
neglect.</p>

<p>As I have before stated the women prevented this outrage from
having effect, and the two trembling girls, neither of whom could
have been more than fifteen, fled into Perth, to take refuge in
some European's house. The native men and women, after their
departure, indulged in the most unlimited abuse of boyl-yas in
general, and of the Guildford boyl-yas in particular, against
whom, according to the idea of the natives, they had very strong
presumptive evidence from the circumstance of the cloak having
been stolen by a Guildford man. It was still very doubtful what
boyl-yas were the actual perpetrators of the crime, so they were
contented with vowing to kill a great many of them in some
direction or the other, as soon as anyone could detect that in
which the suspected ones retired. This resolution having been
formed the men went into Perth in order to see that no strange
natives stole either of the young widows, whilst the women lay
weeping over the dead body.</p>

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE FUNERAL. FORMATION OF THE GRAVE.</p>

<p>I accompanied the men into Perth, and in the course of an hour
was summoned by the natives to witness the funeral ceremony. They
had moved the body about half a mile from the spot where the man
died; the women still leant over it, uttering the words, yang,
yang, yang, and occasionally chanting a few sentences.</p>

<p>There were but few men present, as they were watching the
widows in Perth. Yenna and Warrup, the brothers-in-law of
Mulligo, were digging his grave, which as usual extended due east
and west; the Perth boyl-ya, Weeban by name, who, being a
relation of the deceased, could of course have had no hand in
occasioning his death, superintended the operations. They
commenced by digging with their sticks and hands several holes in
a straight line, and as deep as they could; they then united
them, and threw out the earth from the bottom of the pit thus
made; all the white sand was thrown carefully into two heaps,
nearly in the form of a European grave, and these heaps were
situated one at the head and the other at the foot of the hole
they were digging, whilst the dirty-coloured sand was thrown into
two other heaps, one on each side. The grave was very narrow,
only just wide enough to admit the body of the deceased. Old
Weeban paid the greatest possible attention to see that the east
and west direction of the grave was preserved, and if the least
deviation from this line occurred in the heaps of sand, either at
the head or foot, he made some of the natives rectify it by
sweeping the sand into its proper form with boughs of trees.</p>

<p>Before the digging of the grave was completed many Europeans
had arrived at the spot for the purpose of witnessing the
ceremony; the natives were not a little annoyed at this, however
they proceeded rapidly in their work, occasionally employing a
spade, but from the extreme narrowness of the grave, it was by no
means easy to make use of this tool. During the process of
digging, an insect having been thrown up, its motions were
watched with the most intense interest, and as this little animal
thought proper to crawl off in the direction of Guildford, an
additional proof was furnished to the natives of the guilt of the
boyl-yas of that place.</p>

<p>SUPERSTITIOUS RITES.</p>

<p>When the grave was completed, they set fire to some dried
leaves and twigs, then throwing them in they soon had a large
blaze in it: during this part of the ceremony old Weeban knelt on
the ground at the foot of the grave with his back turned towards
the east, and his head bowed to the earth, his whole attitude
denoting the most profound attention; the duty he had now to
perform was a very important one, being no less than to discover
in which direction the boyl-yas, when drawn out of the earth by
the fire, would take flight. Their departure was not audible to
common ears or visible to the eyes of ordinary mortals, but his
power of boyl-ya gaduk enabled him to distinguish these sights
and sounds which were invisible and inaudible to the
bystanders.</p>

<p>The fire roared for some time loudly in the grave, and every
eye rested anxiously on old Weeban; the hollow, almost
mysterious, sound of the flames as they rose from the narrow
aperture evidently had a powerful effect upon the superstitious
fears of the natives, and when he suddenly raised his meerro and
then let it fall over his shoulder in a due east direction (the
direction of Guildford) a grim smile of satisfaction passed over
the countenances of the young men, who now knew in what direction
to avenge the foul witchcraft which they felt assured had brought
about the death of their brother-in-law.</p>

<p>THE BURIAL.</p>

<p>The next part of their proceedings was to take the body of
Mulligo from the females: they raised it in a cloak; his old
mother made no effort to prevent its being removed, but
passionately and fervently kissed the cold rigid lips, which she
could never press to hers again. The body was then lowered into
the grave and seated upon a bed of leaves which had been laid
there directly the fire was extinguished, the face being,
according to custom, turned towards the east. The women still
remained grouped together, sobbing forth their mournful songs,
whilst the men placed small green boughs upon the body until they
had more than half filled up the grave with them; cross-pieces of
wood of considerable size were then fixed in the opposite sides
of the grave, green boughs placed on these, and the earth from
the two side heaps thrown in, until the grave was completed;
which then, owing to the heaps at the head and foot, presented
the appearance of three graves, nearly similar in size and form,
lying in a due east and west direction.</p>

<p>The men having now completed their task the women came with
bundles of blackboy tops which they had gathered, and laid these
down on the central heap so as to give it a green and pleasing
appearance; they placed neither meerro nor spear on the grave,
but whilst they were filling in the earth old Weeban and another
native sat on their hams at the head of it, facing the one to the
north, and the other to the south, their foreheads leaning on
their clasped hands, which rested on one end of a meerro whilst
the other end was placed on the ground. The ceremonies having
been thus concluded I returned to Perth.</p>

<p>WATCHING THE GRAVE.</p>

<p>Sunday June 16.</p>

<p>This evening I walked out to Mulligo's grave and found his old
mother seated there, crying bitterly. She had indeed good reason
to weep, for those infamous boyl-yas, not content with eating the
flesh of her son during his lifetime, and thereby causing his
death, had been detected by her in the very act of sitting round
his grave for the purpose of preying on his miserable remains.
There could, it appears, be no doubt of the truth of this strange
fact, for the poor old lady triumphantly pointed out their
tracks, at the spot from whence they sprang into the air, in the
direction of Guildford; but my eyes unfortunately were not good
enough to detect the slightest vestige of any traces, either
human or spiritual. However much this might have made me suspect
the old lady's veracity it had no such effect upon the natives,
and being now firmly convinced that the Guildford boyl-yas were
the guilty parties, they announced their intention of starting in
a few days for the purpose of putting Weenat to death.</p>

<p>CONTEST FOR MULLIGO'S WIDOWS.</p>

<p>June 17.</p>

<p>Miago ought, according to custom, to have allowed three full
days to elapse before his brother's widows entered his hut, but
as Bennyyowlee appeared resolved not to renounce his intention of
claiming the hand of one of the ladies Miago's friends thought it
more prudent to bring matters to a speedy issue, lest, in the
interim, his rival might carry of Mugawit, the young lady he was
desirous of possessing. On Monday evening therefore when I went
to the native encampment I found that the first forms of the
marriage ceremony had taken place, which were as follows:</p>

<p>Miago ordered the two widows of his brother to prepare his
hut, that as soon as the sun had set he might sleep there.
Bennyyowlee, who, with his friends and supporters were encamped
within a few yards of the other party, went up to Mugawit and
ordered her to follow him to his Mya, or bark hut; this she
declined doing, and he immediately speared her in the thigh.
Miago now, as in duty bound, threw a quartz-headed spear at
Bennyyowlee, which, if the latter had not most dexterously
avoided, must have proved fatal. A general disturbance would have
taken place had not I and several other Europeans come up at the
same moment and pacified Miago, whilst Bennyyowlee took advantage
of this temporary calm to evacuate the field, followed by
insulting shouts of laughter from Miago's friends.</p>

<p>A circumstance strongly illustrating the peculiar family
customs of this people occurred this evening. Moorroongo, Miago's
stepfather, was a Tdondarup, and as such stood in the relation of
matta-gyne to Bennyyowlee; his hut stood therefore amongst those
of this native's friends, and Miago's future wives remained in
the care of his mother, and of course amongst the friends of his
rival. When however Bennyyowlee departed Miago's mother and the
two native girls went over to the Ngotak and Nagarnook party, who
were, on this occasion, united. They then built a hut for Miago
and lighted a fire; the old mother herself swept out the hut, so
as to make it perfectly clean and nice; the brides then laid down
in it, one on each side, so as to leave a vacant place in the
centre for their new lord and master; and Miago's mother, having
seen all these arrangements completed, returned once more to the
hut of her husband. This was a remarkable instance of a
stepfather and son being by custom compelled to espouse opposite
sides of a quarrel because they bore different family names.</p>

<p>BURIAL OF A NATIVE IN THE LESCHENAULT DISTRICT. BURIAL AT THE
VASSE.</p>

<p>As these forms of interment have considerable interest and are
somewhat varied in their details in different localities, I have
subjoined the following account of the burial of a native, as
described in an extract of a letter from Mr. Bussel, a gentleman
resident near the Vasse River in Western Australia:</p>

<p>PROCESSION TO THE GRAVE.</p>

<p>The funeral is a wild and fearful ceremony. Before I had
finished in the stockyard the dead man was already removed and on
its way to the place of interment, about a quarter of a mile from
where the death took place,* and I left our house entirely guided
by the shrill wailing of the female natives as they followed,
mourning, after the two men who bore the body in their arms.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. He had been murdered by his countrymen
whilst tending Mr. Bussel's cattle.)</blockquote>

<p>The dirge, as distance blended all the voices, was very
plaintive, even musical; nor did the diminution of distance
destroy the harmony entirely; some of the chants were really
beautiful, but rendered perhaps too harsh for our ears in actual
contact: for as I joined myself to the procession, and became
susceptible of the trembling cadence of each separate
performer--the human voice in every key which the extremes of
youth and age might produce, there was a sensation effected which
I cannot well describe--a terrible jarring of the brain. The fact
that the involuntary tears rolled down the cheeks of those
infants who sat passively on their mothers' shoulders, not
appreciating the cause of lament, but merely as listeners, must
prove that these sounds are calculated to affect the nervous
system powerfully.</p>

<p>CEREMONIES ON INTERMENT.</p>

<p>The procession moved slowly on and at length arrived at the
place fixed upon for the burial. There had been a short silence
previous to coming thus far, as if to give the voice a rest; for
as the body touched the ground, and the bearers stood erect and
silent, a piercing shriek was given, and as this died away into a
chant some of the elder women lacerated their scalps with sharp
bones until the blood ran down their furrowed faces in actual
streams. The eldest of the bearers then stepped forward and
proceeded to dig the grave. I offered to get a spade, but they
would not have it; the digging stick was the proper tool, which
they used with greater despatch than from its imperfect nature
could have been expected at first sight. The earth being loosened
with this implement was then thrown out with the hands with great
dexterity, in complete showers so as to form, in the same line
with the grave, at both ends, two elongated banks, the sand
composing them so lightly hurled as to seem almost like
drift-sand on the seashore. In the throw, if perchance the right
limit was outstepped, the proper form was retained by
sweeping.</p>

<p>The digging, notwithstanding the art displayed, was very
tedious: they all sat in silence, and there were no chants to
understand, or to fancy one understood, or perhaps to make
meanings to.</p>

<p>But at length the grave was finished, and they then threw some
dry leaves into it, and, setting fire to them, while the blaze
was rising up, everyone present struck repeatedly a bundle of
spears with the mearu which they held with the butts downwards,
making a rattling noise. Then, when the fire had burnt out, they
placed the corpse beside the grave, and gashed their thighs, and
at the flowing of the blood they all said, "I have brought
blood," and they stamped the foot forcibly on the ground,
sprinkling the blood around them; then, wiping the wounds with a
wisp of leaves, they threw it, bloody as it was, on the dead man;
then a loud scream ensued and they lowered the body into the
grave, resting on the back, with the soles of the feet on the
ground and the knees bent; they filled the grave with soft
brushwood, and piled logs on this to a considerable height, being
very careful all the time to prevent any of the soil from falling
into the apertures; they then constructed a hut over the
woodstack, and one of the male relations got into it and said,
"Mya balung einya ngin-na" ("I sit in his house.") One of the
women then dropped a few live coals at his feet, and, having
stuck his dismantled meerro at the end of one of the mounds, they
left the place, retiring in a contrary direction from that in
which they came, chanting.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>BURIAL AT KING GEORGE's SOUND.</p>

<p>The two foregoing descriptions exhibit the native funeral
ceremonies as practised at Perth, and at the Vasse on the
sea-coast to the south of Perth. I shall now add a third
description of the usages at King George's Sound as given by Mr.
Scott Nind in the first volume of the Journal of the Royal
Geographical Society page 46:</p>

<p>Their funeral solemnities are accompanied by loud
lamentations. A grave is dug, about four feet long and three
wide, and perhaps a yard in depth; the earth that is removed is
arranged on one side of the grave in the form of a crescent; at
the bottom is placed some bark, and then small green boughs, and
upon this the body, ornamented and enveloped in its cloak, with
the knees bent up to the breast, and the arms crossed.* Over the
body are heaped more green boughs and bark, and the hole is then
filled with earth. Green boughs are placed over the earth, and
upon them are deposited the spears, knife, and hammer of the
deceased, together with the ornaments that belonged to him; his
throwing-stick on one side, and his curl (kiley) or towk (dowak)
on the other side of the mound. The mourners then carve circles
in the bark of the trees that grow near the grave, at the height
of six or seven feet from the ground; and, lastly, making a small
fire in front, they gather small boughs and carefully brush away
any portion of the earth that may adhere to them. The face is
coloured black or white, laid on in blotches across the forehead,
round the temples, and down the cheek bones, and these marks of
mourning are worn for a considerable time. They also cut the end
of the nose, and scratch it for the purpose of producing
tears.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Charlevoix, in describing the funeral of
the North American Indians, says: Le cadavre est expose a la
porte de la cabanne dans la posture qu'il doit avoir dans le
tombeau, et cette posture en plusieurs endroits est cela de
l'enfant dans la sein de sa mere. Nor was this custom confined to
these races, for, in the words of Cicero: Antiquissimum
sepulturae genus id fuisse videtur, quo apud Xenophontem Cyrus
utitur; redditur enim terrae corpus, et ita locatum ac situm,
quasi operimento matria obducitur. De Legibus 11
66.)</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>CUSTOMS OF SELF-LACERATION, AND OF REMAINING WATCHING AMONG
THE GRAVES.</p>

<p>The foregoing relations of the ceremonies practised at a
native funeral exhibit some instances of the way in which they
lacerate themselves in the exercise of certain superstitious
rites, a custom very prevalent throughout all the yet known parts
of Australia, and according with those described in the first
book of Kings chapter 18 verse 28: And they cried aloud, and cut
themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the
blood gushed out upon them.</p>

<p>And again, Jeremiah chapter 48 verse 37: For every head shall
be bald, and every beard clipped; upon all the hands shall be
cuttings, etc.</p>

<p>The natives of many parts of Australia when at a funeral cut
off portions of their beards, and, singeing these, throw them
upon the dead body; in some instances they cut off the beard of
the corpse, and, burning it, rub themselves and the body with the
singed portions of it.</p>

<p>"It may be also remarked," says Major Mitchell,* "that a
superstitious custom prevailed among the Gentiles in mourning for
the dead. They cut off their hair, and threw it into the
sepulchre with the bodies of their relations and friends, and
sometimes laid it upon the face or breast of the dead as an
offering to the infernal gods, whereby they thought to appease
them, and make them kind to the deceased." See Maimonides de Idol
112 1, 2, 5.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Australian Expedition volume 1 page 254
note.)</blockquote>

<p>It is enjoined in Deuteronomy chapter 14 verse 1: Ye are the
children of the Lord your God, ye shall not cut yourselves, nor
make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. Now the native
females invariably cut themselves and scratch their faces in
mourning for the dead; they also literally make a baldness
between their eyes, this being always one of the places where
they tear the skin with the finger nails.</p>

<p>The custom of remaining amongst the graves is found among the
natives of nearly all known portions of Australia. A similar
practice is reprehended in Isaiah chapter 45 verses 4 and 5: A
people that provoke me to anger continually to my face, that
sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick,
which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments. See
also on this subject, Lewis's Origines Hebraeae, volume 3 page
381.</p>

<p>In Australia the object supposed to be obtained by this custom
is a revelation as to what individual caused the death of the
deceased; this revelation is made either by the means of actual
visions or by dreams.</p>

<p>MYSTERIOUS BONES.</p>

<p>Although the natives of the different portions of Australia
have various modes of effecting the discovery of the sorcerers
who caused the death of the deceased, as well as different modes
of avenging his death, I feel sure that they have all one common
object in view. In another part of this work I have given an
account of an old woman watching by a grave with this intention;
I have frequently however seen their sorcerers fulfil this duty;
and the following extract from Mr. Threlkeld's Vocabulary will
show the prevalence of this custom on the eastern side of the
continent:*</p>

<p>Mur-ro-kun, the name of a mysterious bone which is obtained by
the Ka-ra-kul, a doctor or conjuror, three of which sleep on the
grave of a recently interred corpse; when in the night, during
their sleep, the dead person inserts a mysterious bone into each
thigh of the three doctors, who feel the puncture not more severe
than that of the sting of an ant. The bones remain in the flesh
of the doctors without any inconvenience to them, until they wish
to kill any person, when by unknown means, it is said and
believed, they destroy in a supernatural manner their ill-fated
victim by the mysterious bone, causing it to enter into their
bodies, and so occasion their death.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Threlkeld's Vocabulary page
88.)</blockquote>

<p>THE BOYL-YAS OR NATIVE SORCERERS.</p>

<p>I have already had occasion to mention incidentally, on more
than one occasion, the Boyl-yas, or native sorcerers, and their
supposed powers have a mighty influence upon the minds and
actions of the natives of Western Australia, in whose
superstitious belief the boyl-yas are objects of mysterious
dread. It is supposed that they can transport themselves through
the air at pleasure, and can render themselves invisible to all
but other boyl-yas. If they have a dislike to a native they can
kill him by stealing on him at night and consuming his flesh.
They enter him like pieces of quartz, and the pain they occasion
is always felt. Another boyl-ya has however the power of drawing
them out and curing the affected person by certain processes of
disenchantment. When this operation is effected the boyl-yas are
drawn out in the form of pieces of quartz, which are kept and
considered as great curiosities by the natives. All natural
illnesses are attributed to these boyl-yas, or to the Wau-guls,
hence the reason of some native being killed when another dies.
The individual dies either by the hands of another native, from
the effects of accident, or from some natural cause. In the first
case his death is avenged on his murderer, or on some near
relative of his; in either of the other two cases it is avenged
on some connexion of the supposed boyl-yas against whom they have
a spite.</p>

<p>KAIBER'S ACCOUNT OF THE BOYL-YAS.</p>

<p>Interested by an account I had received of the boyl-yas from
the women, after Mulligo's death, I endeavoured to obtain from
Kaiber a more ample statement of their belief relative to these
people. The difficulty I laboured under upon this head, as well
as the dread they entertain of these sorcerers, will be best
shown by the following account of his answers to my questions,
together with his incidental remarks:*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. His words were nearly as follows:<br>
 Boyl-ya yongar boyl-ya gaduk. Djerral, way-lo, wor-rar ngin
noween; Boyl-ya windoo; boko-djee wattoo; boorda nganya men-dyke

ngin-now. Yoongar mendyke, boyl-ya wal-byne, wal-byne, wal-byne,
etc. etc. boorda bar-rab-a-ra yoongar.)</blockquote>

<p>The boyl-yas are natives who have the power of boyl-ya; they
sit down to the northward, the eastward, and southward; the
boyl-yas are very bad, they walk away there (pointing to the
east). I shall be very ill presently.</p>

<p>The boyl-yas eat up a great many natives, they eat them up as
fire would; you and I will be very ill directly. The boyl-yas
have ears: by-and-by they will be greatly enraged. I'll tell you
no more.</p>

<p>The boyl-yas move stealthily, you sleep and they steal on you,
very stealthily the boyl-yas move. These boyl-yas are dreadfully
revengeful; by-and-by we shall be very ill. I'll not talk about
them.</p>

<p>They come moving along in the sky, cannot you let them alone.
I've already a terrible headache, by-and-by you and I will be two
dead men.</p>

<p>The natives cannot see them. The boyl-yas do not bite, they
feed stealthily; they do not eat the bones, but consume the
flesh. Just give me what you intend to give, and I'll walk
off.</p>

<p>The boyl-yas sit at the graves of natives in great numbers. If
natives are ill, the boyl-yas charm, charm, charm, charm, and
charm, and by and by the natives recover.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I could learn nothing further from him.</p>

<p>The Wau-gul is an imaginary aquatic monster, residing in fresh
water and endowed with supernatural power which enables it to
consume the natives, although it generally attacks females. The
person it selects for its victim pines away almost imperceptibly
and dies.</p>

<p>SUPERSTITION AND THEIR OPINION REGARDING THE NIGHTMARE.</p>

<p>The natives believe that the nightmare is caused by some evil
spirit. The way in which they get rid of this evil being is by
jumping up, seizing a lighted brand from the fire, twirling it
round the head, and muttering a variety of imprecations; they
then throw the stick away in the direction they conceive the
spirit to be in. Some of them have explained this custom to me by
stating that this evil spirit wants a light, and that when he
gets it he will go away. They however also take the precaution of
moving their position and getting as far as they can into the
group of natives who are sleeping round the fire.</p>

<p>If they are obliged to move away from the fire after dark,
either to get water or for any other purpose, they carry a light
with them and set fire to dry bushes as they go along.</p>

<p>VENERATION FOR CRYSTAL STONES.</p>

<p>The natives of South-western Australia likewise pay a respect,
almost amounting to veneration, to shining stones or pieces of
crystal, which they call Teyl. None but their sorcerers or
priests are allowed to touch these, and no bribe can induce an
unqualified native to lay his hand on them.</p>

<p>The accordance of this word in sound and signification with
the Baetyli mentioned in the following extract from Burder's
Oriental Customs (volume 1 page 16) is remarkable:</p>

<p>And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and
poured oil upon the top of it, and he called the name of that
place Bethel. Genesis 28:18.</p>

<p>From this conduct of Jacob and this Hebrew appellation, the
learned Bochart, with great ingenuity and reason, insists that
the name and veneration of the sacred stones called Baetyli, so
celebrated in all Pagan antiquity, were derived.</p>

<p>These Baetyli were stones of a round form, they were supposed
to be animated by means of magical incantations, with a portion
of the Deity; they were consulted on occasions of great and
pressing emergency as a kind of divine oracle, and were suspended
either round the neck or some other part of the body.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>That this veneration for certain pieces of quartz or crystal
is common over a very great portion of the continent is evident
from the following extracts from Threlkeld's Vocabulary, page
88:</p>

<p>Mur-ra-mai: The name of a round ball, about the size of a
cricket-ball, which the Aborigines carry in a small net suspended
from their girdles of opossum yarn. The women are not allowed to
see the internal part of the ball; it is used as a talisman
against sickness, and it is sent from tribe to tribe for hundreds
of miles on the sea-coast, and in the interior; one is now here
from Moreton Bay, the interior of which a black showed me
privately in my study, betraying considerable anxiety lest any
female should see its contents.</p>

<p>After unrolling many yards of woollen cord made from the fur
of the opossum, the contents proved to be a quartz-like substance
of the size of a pigeon's egg, he allowed me to break it and
retain a part. It is transparent like white sugar-candy; they
swallow the small crystalline particles which crumble off as a
preventative of sickness. It scratches glass, and does not
effervesce with acids. From another specimen the stone appears to
be agate of a milky hue, semi-pellucid, and strikes fire. The
vein from which it appears broken off is one inch and a quarter
thick. A third specimen contains a portion of cornelian,
partially crystallized, a fragment of chalcedony, and a fragment
of a crystal of white quartz.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>And again in Mitchell's Expeditions into Australia, volume 2
page 338: In these girdles the men, and especially their coradjes
or priests, frequently carry crystals of quartz or other shining
stones, which they hold in high estimation, and very unwillingly
show to anyone; invariably taking care, when they do unfold them,
that no woman shall see them.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>FORMS ON MAKING VOWS AND PLEDGES.</p>

<p>Genesis chapter 24 verse 9. And the servant put his hand under
the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that
matter.</p>

<p>This is exactly the form that is observed in South-western
Australia, when the natives swear amity to one another, or pledge
themselves to aid one another in avenging a death.</p>

<p>One native remains seated on the ground with his heels tucked
under him, in the Eastern manner; the one who is about to narrate
a death to him approaches slowly and with averted face, and seats
himself cross-legged upon the thighs of the other; they are thus
placed thigh to thigh, and squeezing their bodies together they
place breast to breast. Both then avert their faces, their eyes
frequently fill with tears, no single word is spoken; and the one
who is seated uppermost places his hands under the thighs of his
friend; having remained thus seated for a minute or two he rises
up and withdraws to a little distance without speaking, but an
inviolable pledge to avenge the death has by this ceremony passed
between the two.</p>

<p>One remarkable custom prevalent equally amongst the most
ancient nations of whom any records are preserved, and the modern
Australians, is that of naming children from some circumstance
connected with their birth or early infancy. Thus in Genesis
chapter 30 verse 11: And Leah said, A troop cometh, and she
called his name Gad; etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Burckhardt observed the same custom among the Bedouins and
says:</p>

<p>A name is given to the infant immediately on his birth; the
name is derived from some trifling accident, or from some object
which had struck the fancy of the mother or any of the women
present at the child's birth. Notes on the Bedouins, page 55.</p>

<p>CUSTOM OF CIRCUMCISION.</p>

<p>The natives of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and also those on the
eastern shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, practise the rite of
circumcision. That is, this remarkable rite is known to be
observed in two points of the continent of Australia exactly
opposite to one another, and which are separated by a distance of
about twelve hundred miles.</p>

<p>OTHER SCRIPTURAL CUSTOMS.</p>

<p>The injunctions contained in Deuteronomy chapter 23 verses 12
and 13 are literally fulfilled by the natives in several parts of
the continent. In addition to my own testimony on this point I
will refer to Wilson's Voyage round the World, page 165, where he
states:</p>

<p>They are cleanly in their manners, and in some respects
superior to the Europeans, fulfilling the injunction of Moses in
the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the twenty-third chapter of
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>This passage relates to the natives of Raffles Bay on the
extreme north of the continent of Australia, whereas I have
observed the custom in the South-western parts of Australia.</p>

<p>They also conform strictly to the injunctions in Leviticus
chapter 15 verse 19.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17. CHARACTERISTIC ANECDOTES.</h2>

<p>The following casual anecdotes, though trivial in themselves,
will assist in illustrating some of the peculiarities of the
native mind and character.</p>

<p>MIAGO'S IMAGINARY SPEECH AS GOVERNOR.</p>

<p>Speech that the native Miago would have addressed to the
aborigines of Perth if he had landed as Governor instead of His
Excellency Mr. Hutt. He came into my room directly after the
Governor had landed, and made this imaginary address.</p>

<p>Yiee, nap yongar Perth bak-ad-jee yuado--Moon-dee Moondee
gurrang, gurrang boola: Mir-ga-na, Mir-ga-na gurrang, gurrang
boola: Yal-gon-ga, Yal-gon-ga, gurrang, gurrang boola; yarn

<p>Waumma Governor yool: yahi Perth yongar bak-ad-jee yu-a-do;

<p>MIAGO'S SPEECH AS GOVERNOR.</p>

<p>Henceforth this people of Perth must not fight. Moon-dee,
Moon-dee, you are always quarrelling. Mir-ga-na, Mir-ga-na, you
are always quarrelling. Yal-gon-ga, Yal-gon-ga, you are
quarrelsome--what is the reason of this?</p>

<p>Bucklebury speared Wattup, what reason had he to be in such a
passion (or, why was he so very angry)?</p>

<p>Bun-bury, you are very quarrelsome.</p>

<p>The young men behave very well, the old ones are always
wrangling.</p>

<p>The young men paint themselves, and the women look at them;
the young men are not aware of this, but the old men are very
jealous--and being in a passion spear the young men--this is very
wrong.</p>

<p>Now another Governor is come, and you people of Perth must
fight no more. This is very good.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from a journal kept by me whilst
resident at King George's Sound.</p>

<p>ROBBERY BY PEERAT'S WIVES. TRANSACTIONS WITH THE NATIVES IN A
CASE OF POTATO STEALING.</p>

<p>Thursday January 23.</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast a soldier came to me with a complaint
that the natives had last night robbed his garden in the
settlement of nearly one hundred weight of potatoes; I was
determined to have here no repetition of scenes similar to what
had recently taken place; and therefore resolved to act promptly
and vigorously upon this first offence.</p>

<p>My first object was, in my punishment, not to involve the
innocent and guilty together, which is too often done by the
Europeans in these colonies.</p>

<p>I therefore got hold of an intelligent native of the name of
Moyee-e-nan, and, accompanied by him, visited the garden whence
the potatoes had been stolen; he found the tracks of three
natives and, availing himself of the faculty which they possess
of telling who has passed from their footmarks, he informed me
that the three thieves had been the two wives of a native of the
name Peerat, and a little boy named Dal-be-an, the son of Peerat.
Being now well acquainted with the natives I was well satisfied
that this evidence was of the most conclusive nature, and
proceeded to act upon it by trying to arrest the delinquents; but
I found that they had, immediately after committing the theft,
walked off into the bush, thereby hoping to avoid suspicion and
with the intention of remaining absent until the affair had blown
over.</p>

<p>MEASURES FOR APPREHENDING THEM.</p>

<p>My mind was soon made up to pursue my friend Peerat and his
fugitive wives, but it was necessary that I should proceed with
great caution in order not to alarm the guilty parties when they
saw us approaching, in which case I should have had no chance of
apprehending them; and I did not intend to adopt the popular
system of shooting them when they ran away. I therefore
determined to take no Europeans, but only four natives who could
track the delinquents.</p>

<p>Previously however to my quitting the town one gentleman
joined me, and thus reinforced we started on Peerat's tracks;
these we followed for about seven miles in a west by north
direction from the settlement, when we suddenly saw the bush set
on fire and thus became aware of our proximity to a party of
natives. My European friend was here unfortunately taken ill,
and, as the natives were evidently more numerous than I expected
to have found them, I was sorry to lose his services at this
period; he however faithfully promised to await my return, and I
thus knew that I had a point d'appui to retire on in the event of
anything taking place.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the natives I now pressed forward in the
direction of the fire, and, after proceeding for about two miles
further in a west by north direction, I fell in with several
natives, one of whom was old Tooleegatwalee, well known in the
settlement. I at once intimated to Mr. Tooleegatwalee and his
friends the object of my mission; I told them that Peerat's wives
and son had stolen potatoes, that I had come out to make them
prisoners, that if they were given up to me they should only
undergo the regular punishment for petty theft; but if they were
not delivered over that I would stop the regular allowance of
flour which was issued to all the natives every two months, thus
punishing them all; and that I would moreover return home, and
then come out with a party of soldiers and fire upon Peerat and
his party wherever I found them. This last part of my
announcement was made in a very decided tone, and with a most
ferocious look.</p>

<p>NATIVE DELIBERATIONS.</p>

<p>The natives hereupon entered into a deliberation amongst
themselves, and eventually were unanimously agreed on several
points, as follows:</p>

<p>1. That stealing potatoes was a very heinous offence, more
particularly in women.</p>

<p>2, That women were notorious thieves, and altogether worse
characters than men.</p>

<p>3, That beating women was an every-day occurrence.</p>

<p>4, That losing flour was a great bore; and</p>

<p>5, That in consequence of the above considerations, they would
give Peerat, his wives, and son, up to me.</p>

<p>Each of these propositions was lengthily discussed by them,
but when they were all agreed to, they came in a body and asked
me, did I speak the truth, and lie not, when I said that I myself
was not angry with Peerat and his wives, and that they should not
be killed but only slightly punished? I assured them that I told
the truth, and lied not. We then proceeded in a body in search of
Peerat, whom we found with some more natives about half a mile
further on.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION WITH PEERAT.</p>

<p>He waited quietly to receive us, not having indeed the
slightest idea of what was the object of my unexpected visit;
when however he heard what I wanted he abused his wives in most
unmeasured terms, and assured me that he would thrash them
soundly, but as to giving them up prisoners, or his son either,
that he declared he would not do; and then very openly and fairly
challenged any one of the other natives, or all of them together,
to take him up, assuring them that he would spear the first man
through the heart that attempted to lay a finger on him. I
interfered so far in this dispute as to announce to Peerat that I
considered my own person as sacred, and I then cocked both
barrels of my double-barrelled gun and concluded by assuring him
I should shoot him if he resisted me.</p>

<p>All native altercations are vociferous and noisy in the
extreme, and are usually accompanied with a great deal of running
and leaping about and quivering of spears; these circumstances I
now took advantage of, and, whilst the others threatened to spear
one another in all imaginable places, I wended my solitary way
towards Peerat's fire, where I discovered Master Dalbean, but
could see nothing whatever of the ladies, who, I presume, were
absent digging roots.</p>

<p>HIS PLEADINGS FOR HIS SON.</p>

<p>The young native was seized hold of before he could attempt to
escape, and, as I told him if he now moved I should shoot him, he
accompanied me very quietly; the others meanwhile capering about
and abusing one another in the distance. Peerat however soon
found out what had taken place and came running after me. These
natives are always ardently attached to their children, and this
the boy's father now evinced in the strongest manner: he first of
all declared that the boy had been asleep with him, and that it
was the mother only who had stolen; and he produced about a dozen
witnesses who all asserted that this was the case. I however
refuted this evidence by mentioning the fact of his footmarks
being in the garden. They then urged that Peerat's second wife
had also been engaged in the theft, and that she was just the
size of the boy; this however again was over-ruled from the fact
of her footmarks having been also seen there.</p>

<p>PEERAT'S SON SECURED.</p>

<p>The father now urged upon me the youth of the boy, and that he
was under the influence of the mother, and then fairly wept upon
his child's neck, who begged his father, and all the other
natives by name, to save him. I was now holding him by the wrist,
for the feeling of the public began at this affecting exhibition
to turn against me, even my own natives urging me to let the
little fellow go; had I followed the dictates of my own heart I
should have done so, but I knew that by being in this instance
very determined I should effect eventually much good. I therefore
held fast by my prisoner. I now saw some of the other natives
giving Peerat spears, which is always a sign that they espouse a
man's quarrel and expect him to make use of the weapons they give
him. As matters therefore now were rather a serious aspect, I
again told Peerat that I personally had no cause of quarrel with
him, but that I was resolved not to allow either the natives to
wrong the Europeans or the Europeans to wrong the natives; that
it was far better for the natives themselves that I, an impartial
person, should see that they were properly punished for theft,
than that the Europeans should fire indiscriminately upon them,
as had lately been done in another quarter; that I should now
talk no more, but that if he did not instantly take himself off
and bring his wives in to the settlement to be punished I would
shoot him. He proceeded again to answer me, but I cut him short
by saying that if he spoke again I would shoot him at once; I
thus had the last speech and therefore, as a matter of course,
was in possession of the public favour: Peerat was consequently
hurried off by his friends, whilst myself, the young prisoner,
and two of the natives who had accompanied me, started on our
return for the settlement.</p>

<p>Although the affair had so far terminated well I was by no
means sure that Peerat might not after my departure induce the
others to attempt a rescue. I therefore hurried on to the spot
where I had left my European friend, but I only found a slip of
paper on a tree, with the following words on it: "Returned slowly
to the settlement." We moved rapidly on again and reached Albany
without further adventure, and on our arrival I lodged Dalbean in
the jail.</p>

<p>January 24.</p>

<p>Peerat did not bring in his wives, and to all the
solicitations which were offered me on the part of the natives
for the release of my little prisoner I answered that, when
Peerat's wives were brought in and given over to the hands of
justice, I would punish the boy and release him; but if the other
delinquents were not given up I should conceive it to be a sign
that the natives were not satisfied with my decision, and
therefore send the boy on to Swan River to be tried. I further
added that, if Peerat did not in the course of the next day
appear with his wives, I should cease to act as mediator, and
taking a party of soldiers would go out and apprehend him.</p>

<p>HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE.</p>

<p>January 25.</p>

<p>This morning information was given me that little Dalbean had
made an attempt to break out of jail. I therefore went up to the
jail with another magistrate and found that the little fellow had
yesterday, during the absence of the turnkey, taken up a loose
stone from the floor and had battered a hole in the door with it.
It evinced altogether more strength and determination than one
could have supposed such a boy to have been endowed with. When I
taxed him with it he stoutly denied it, asserting that whilst he
was asleep sorcerers from the north, who had a spite against him,
had entered the cell through some airholes in the wall and had
done this; and in spite of all our cross-questioning and charging
him with falsehood he still persisted in the same tale, and
really appeared to think that he could persuade us of the truth
of the assertion. I told him that it was his duty to have taken
care that these sorcerers had not injured the door, and that in
future if he did not give the alarm when they came he should be
well whipped for neglect, and that in the meantime I had a great
mind to have him whipped for telling a story; I however satisfied
myself by giving him a severe lecture upon the crime of lying. He
defended himself upon this head by ingenious arguments,
altogether overlooking the abstract question of whether lying was
a virtue or a vice, and defending himself solely upon the plea of
its general usefulness and prevalence in the world. I got rather
worsted in the argument, and therefore, confining myself to
admonitions and a few common-place maxims, I departed.</p>

<p>PEERAT'S WIVES SURRENDERED. THEIR PUNISHMENT.</p>

<p>In the course of the forenoon Peerat presented himself at my
window. The tale he told was a very pitiful one. He had two
wives, and to govern them both required no ordinary ability; he
assured me that he had beaten them both soundly, but
notwithstanding he could not induce them to come into the
settlement until, finally losing his temper, he had threatened to
spear them, and had thus induced them to follow him; he assured
me that he had done nothing but weep and lament since he had last
seen me, at one time for the loss of his son, and then again at
the obstinacy and bad temper of his wives, and as some recompense
for his sufferings he begged to be allowed to beat his wives
himself.</p>

<p>I told him to bring them at once to the garden they had
robbed, and then, followed by several natives, I repaired to the
appointed place. The native women soon appeared, dreadfully cut
and mangled from the beating they had already suffered. One was a
nice-looking girl, about fourteen, but an incorrigible thief.
Peerat threw back his skin to give his arm fair play, and then,
brandishing his meerro, was going to hit her a tremendous blow
upon the head, which must have laid it open. The poor girl stood
with her back towards her husband, trembling and crying bitterly.
I caught Peerat's arm, picked up a little switch from the ground,
and told him to beat her on the shoulders with that. He gave her
two slight blows, or rather taps, in order to know where it was I
meant him to strike; but the poor girl cried so bitterly from
fear that I stopped him, told her that for this time she should
be pardoned, and then called the other woman up, but she had
already been severely beaten and had at that moment a little
child sitting on her shoulder, who cried piteously when he saw
his mother weeping, so I let her also go free. Before they
started however I gave them and the assembled natives a lecture,
talking to them in a ferocious style about my future intentions
in the event of robbery being committed, and warning them not to
judge of me from my present clemency.</p>

<p>During the five months I had been at King George's Sound this
was the first act of petty theft, or indeed of theft of any kind,
committed by the natives; there had on several occasions been as
many as two hundred in the settlement who had no means of
subsistence but a chance job from the colonists, and the
spontaneous productions of the earth, yet during that period the
only criminals had been those above mentioned, namely, a woman, a
girl, and a boy, who had rooted up some potatoes from a retired
garden, and they had even purposely left the large potatoes and
had only taken away the small ones, in the hope that by so doing
they would lessen the crime.</p>

<p>RELEASE OF PEERAT'S SON.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I walked up to the jail attended by Peerat,
his wives, and a crowd of natives, to release little Dalbean.
Peerat and myself alone entered the jail; I told the jailor to
hand him the whip, he took it, and said, "Yes, yes, I will strike
him; let not another beat him, Governor."</p>

<p>The door of the cell was then opened and the little boy was
led out: his father ran up to him, caught him in his arms, and
began kissing him; having done this he told him he was going to
beat him. The little fellow did not answer a word, but, standing
as firm and erect as possible, presented his back to him, the
father gave him one blow, and it was ended--justice was
satisfied; the criminals had surrendered to salutary laws, of
which they had but a vague and undefined knowledge. It was their
first offence; I explained to them the nature of the laws they
had broken, warned them to be careful in their future conduct,
and let them go. Little Dalbean, directly we got outside the
jail, walked up to me, took my hand, and squeezed it, and then
turned to his mother; he just looked at her, she cried, but did
not dare to kiss him, or to show any symptom of emotion; and the
whole party, after showering thanks innumerable upon my head,
moved off, saying, "What a good fellow--what a good fellow;" or,
to give a literal translation, "One good man--one good man."</p>

<p>Sunday January 26.</p>

<p>Old Manniotte, a native dressed in an old uniform, attended
the church service as usual this day and was apparently as
attentive as any other member of the congregation.</p>

<p>JUDICIAL CASE OF ASSAULT.</p>

<p>February 14.</p>

<p>This evening a native came up to me as I was in the
Commissary's house, and said: "Djanga kain nganya goree
bomb-gur"; "A white man has just struck me." At the same time he
showed me his side which was severely bruised. I accompanied him
to the beach and there found a number of liberty men from some
American whalers walking about. There were also several natives
on the beach who were in a state of great excitement, and came
hurrying up to me. I had sent for the constable, and as I was
coming up I saw a sailor moving off to the boats, on which the
natives all shouted out, "Now, now, walk away."</p>

<p>The natives were soon satisfied that strict justice would be
done them, and as the sailor who had struck the native was a man
belonging to the Russel, commanded by Captain Long, who had
previously taken me to Shark Bay, it was arranged with him that
the offender should be brought before me at 11 o'clock the next
day to answer the charge.</p>

<p>February 15.</p>

<p>This morning Taalwurt the native, attended by his various
friends, came to me before I went to the Courthouse, to insist
upon his right to speak first, as he appeared to think that a
great deal depended upon his having this advantage over his
opponent. I explained to him that, as plaintiff, this right of
course belonged to him, and he thereupon withdrew, followed by
his adherents. At the appointed hour I repaired to the Courthouse
and found the natives assembled; the Europeans had not yet
arrived. I called therefore upon Taalwurt for an information,
which was as follows:</p>

<p>THE ACCUSATION. ATTEMPTS AT ELOQUENCE. ADJUDICATION OF THE
CASE.</p>

<p>Colony of Western Australia, to wit: The information and
complaint of Taalwurt Tdondarup, of Albany, in the said Colony,
made before me, George Grey, Esquire, one of H.M. Justices of the
Peace in and for the said Colony, the fifteenth day of February,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty.</p>

<p>The said Taalwurt Tdondarup complaineth and saith:</p>

<p>"Nganya kype yoor-ril gool-gur, boye bomb-gur."</p>

<p>"I in the water carelessly walked along, a stone struck
me."</p>

<p>But at this point his eloquence totally deserted him, and he
was pulled back by his friends, who pushed forward another
native, and who stated as follows:</p>

<p>Lindoll Mongalung saith: "Wal-bur wat-to Taalwurt: Djanga
Taalwurt kyle-gut bomb-gur.</p>

<p>"Taalwurt djanga neyp bomb-gur, kyle-gut Taalwurt neyp
bomb-gur: Waum djanga Taalwurt matta boorn boola bomb-gur:
Taalwurt yoor-ril watto, waum djunga nar-rail ngob-barn boye
koombar bomb-gar."</p>

<p>"Along the beach was walking Taalwurt; one of the dead struck
him under the ear. Taalwurt then very slightly struck this one of
the dead; under the ear Taalwurt very lightly struck him. Another
of the dead then struck Taalwurt very forcibly on the legs with a
stick: Taalwurt went walking along quickly; another of the dead,
in the ribs with an exceedingly big stone, extremely hard hit
him."</p>

<p>A murmur of applause ran through the assembled natives. The
ngob-burn boye, koom-bur bomb-gur, or exceedingly big-stone,
extremely hard hit, was evidently regarded by them as a
masterpiece of eloquence; and the contrast between this and the
neyp bomb-gur, very gently struck, of Mr. Taalwurt, undoubtedly
evinced its superiority in their estimation; but as Taalwurt was
a stout able fellow, and one by no means given to deal gentle
blows when in a passion, I did not place implicit faith in this
poetical narration. I had however no doubt that Taalwurt had been
first struck and was thus the injured party; but now I knew he
had returned the blow I was also sure that he had given at least
as good a one as he had taken.</p>

<p>The case therefore did not tell in Taalwurt's favour as much
as I expected it would; and on the offender being produced, I
found that he was a native from the island of Timor, and not much
more civilized than his opponent. The mate of the vessel who came
up with him stated that the man bore an excellent character, and
that he was willing to make any compensation Taalwurt might
require. Before the case came on I had explained this to the King
George's Sound native, who compounded the matter for
half-a-crown, and then walked off with his friends, fully
resolved to get assaulted again upon the first good
opportunity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 18. INFLUENCE OF EUROPEANS ON THE NATIVES.</h2>

<p>CAUSES WHY IT HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN BENEFICIAL. INFLUENCE OF
EUROPEANS ON THE NATIVES.</p>

<p>After reviewing the condition of the Aborigines of Australia
as it appears to have existed from time immemorial it will not be
irrelevant to examine what change or melioration of their social
state is likely to arise from the settlement of a civilised
European race among them.</p>

<p>The colony of Swan River differing materially in the elements
of its population from those established in the eastern parts of
this continent and in Van Diemen's Land, a corresponding change
in the intercourse existing between the natives and the white
population might naturally be looked for.</p>

<p>In modern times, with the exception of the new settlement of
South Australia, no colony has been established upon principles
apparently so favourable for the development of the better
qualities of the Aborigines, and with so fair a chance of their
ultimate civilization.</p>

<p>The apparent advantages are that no convicts have been brought
to Western Australia to corrupt the manners of either sex, or to
lead them astray by their vicious example; and that a great want
of labour has been always felt, so that any assistance that could
have been procured from the natives would have been a material
benefit to the settlers. With these advantages we might have
hoped to see some important results.</p>

<p>I wish not to assert that the natives have been often treated
with wanton cruelty, but I do not hesitate to say that no real
amelioration of their condition has been effected, and that much
of negative evil and indirect injury has been inflicted on
them.</p>

<p>The first great fault committed was that no distinct rules and
regulations were drawn up for the protection of the Aborigines.
Their land is taken from them, and the only benefit given in
return is that they are made British subjects, that is, having a
right to the protection of British Laws, and at the same time
becoming amenable to them.</p>

<p>WRETCHED STATE OF THE NATIVE POPULATION.</p>

<p>All past experience has shown that the existence of two
different races in a country, one of which, from any local
circumstances, is considered inferior to the other, is one of the
greatest evils under which a nation can labour; a more striking
instance of which could not be adduced than is shown in the
present state of the free coloured population in America.</p>

<p>In contemplating, then, the future destiny of the Australian
races, at the same time laying aside all thought of their
amalgamation with Europeans, the prospect is most melancholy.
Only two cases can arise; either they must disappear before
advancing civilization, successively dying off ere the truths of
christianity or the benefits of civilization have produced any
effect on them, or they must exist in the midst of a superior
numerical population, a despised and inferior race; and none but
those who have visited a country in which such a race exists can
duly appreciate the evils both moral and physical which such a
degraded position entails upon them.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF THEIR DEPRESSED CONDITION. PREJUDICES AGAINST
THEM.</p>

<p>If we enquire into the causes which tend to retain them in
their present depressed condition we shall find that the chief
one is prejudice. The Australians have been most unfairly
represented as a very inferior race, in fact as one occupying a
scale in the creation which nearly places them on a level with
the brutes, and some years must elapse ere a prejudice so firmly
rooted as this can be altogether eradicated, but certainly a more
unfounded one never had possession of the public mind.</p>

<p>INADEQUACY OF SUPPORT BY LABOUR.</p>

<p>Amongst the evils which the natives suffer in their present
position one is an uncertain and irregular demand for their
labour, that is to say, they may one day have plenty of means for
exerting their industry afforded them by the settlers, and the
next their services are not required; so that they are
necessarily compelled to have recourse to their former irregular
and wandering habits.</p>

<p>Another is the very insufficient reward for the services they
render. As an example of this kind I will state the instance of a
man who worked during the whole season as hard and as well as any
white man at getting in the harvest for some settlers, and who
only received bread and sixpence a day whilst the ordinary
labourers would earn at least fifteen shillings. In many
instances they only receive a scanty allowance of food, so much
so that some settlers have told me that the natives left them
because they had not enough to eat.</p>

<p>The evil consequence of this is that a native, finding he can
gain as much by the combined methods of hunting and begging as he
can by working, naturally prefers the former and much more
attractive mode of procuring subsistence to the latter one.</p>

<p>Many of the natives have not only a good idea of the value of
money but even hoard it up for some particular purpose; several
of them have shown me their little treasure of a few shillings,
and have told me it was their intention to save more until they
had enough to buy a horse, a gun, or some wished-for article, but
their improvidence has always got the better of their
thriftiness, and this sum has eventually been spent in treating
their friends to bread and rice.</p>

<p>EVIL EFFECTS FROM THEIR FEROCIOUS CUSTOMS REMAINING
UNCHECKED.</p>

<p>Another evil is the very extraordinary position in which they
are placed with regard to two distinct sets of laws; that is,
they are allowed to exercise their own laws upon one another, and
are again held amenable to British law where British subjects are
concerned. Thus no protection is afforded them by the British law
against the violence or cruelty of one of their own race, and the
law has hitherto only been known to them as the means of
punishment, but never as a code from which they can claim
protection or benefit.</p>

<p>The following instances will prove my assertion: In the month
of October 1838 I saw early one morning some natives in the
public street in Perth, in the act of murdering a native woman,
close to the store of the Messrs. Habgood; many Europeans were
present, amongst others a constable; but there was no
interference on their part until eventually the life of the woman
was saved by the courage of Mr. Brown, a gardener in Perth, who
rushed in amongst the natives and knocked down the man who was
holding her; she then escaped into the house of the Messrs.
Habgood, who treated the poor creature with the utmost humanity.
She was however wounded in several places in the most severe and
ghastly manner.</p>

<p>A letter I received from Mr. A. Bussel (a settler in the
southern part of the colony) in May 1839 shows that the same
scenes are enacted all over it. In this case their cow-keeper
(the native whose burial is narrated above) was speared by the
others. He was at the time the hired servant of Europeans,
performing daily a stated service for them; yet they slew him in
open daylight, without any cause of provocation being given by
him.</p>

<p>Again, in October, 1838, the sister of a settler in the
northern district told me that, shortly before this period, she
had, as a female servant, a most interesting little native girl,
not more than ten or eleven years of age. This girl had just
learned all the duties belonging to her employment, and was
regarded in the family as a most useful servant, when some
natives, from a spirit of revenge, murdered this inoffensive
child in the most barbarous manner, close to the house; her
screams were actually heard by the Europeans under whose
protection and in whose service she was living, but they were not
in time to save her life. This same native had been guilty of
many other barbarous murders, one of which he had committed in
the district of the Upper Swan, in the actual presence of
Europeans. In June 1839 he was still at large, unmolested, even
occasionally visiting Perth.</p>

<p>CAUSES OF THEIR ATTACHMENT TO THEIR ROVING AND SAVAGE
LIFE.</p>

<p>Their fondness for the bush and the habits of savage life is
fixed and perpetuated by the immense boundary placed by
circumstances between themselves and the whites, which no
exertions on their part can overpass, and they consequently
relapse into a state of hopeless passive indifference.</p>

<p>I will state a remarkable instance of this: The officers of
the Beagle took away with them a native of the name of Miago, who
remained absent with them for several months. I saw him on the
north-west coast, on board the Beagle, apparently perfectly
civilized; he waited at the gun-room mess, was temperate (never
tasting spirits) attentive, cheerful, and remarkably clean in his
person. The next time I saw him was at Swan River, where he had
been left on the return of the Beagle. He was then again a
savage, almost naked, painted all over, and had been concerned in
several murders. Several persons here told me, "you see the taste
for a savage life was strong in him, and he took to the bush
again directly." Let us pause for a moment and consider.</p>

<p>Miago, when he was landed, had amongst the white people none
who would be truly friends of his. They would give him scraps
from their table, but the very outcasts of the whites would not
have treated him as an equal, they had no sympathy with him, he
could not have married a white woman, he had no certain means of
subsistence open to him, he never could have been either a
husband or a father if he had lived apart from his own people;
where amongst the whites was he to find one who would have filled
for him the place of his black mother, whom he is much attached
to? what white man would have been his brother? what white woman
his sister? He had two courses left open to him: he could either
have renounced all natural ties and have led a hopeless, joyless
life amongst the whites, ever a servant, ever an inferior being;
or he could renounce civilization and return to the friends of
his childhood, and to the habits of his youth. He chose the
latter course, and I think that I should have done the same.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS ON THE MEANS OF PROMOTING THEIR CIVILIZATION.</p>

<p>The information I had collected regarding the Aborigines of
Western Australia encouraged me to address a report to Lord John
Russell, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, embracing the
general principles which I considered would best promote the
civilization of the race. This report having been approved,
copies of it were sent to the Governors of the Australian and New
Zealand settlements, and with a transcript of it I shall now
conclude my work:*</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. [This letter has subsequently been
printed for Parliament at page 43 of the Sessional Paper Number
311 of 1841, the Colonization of New Zealand. ED.])</blockquote>

<p>Mauritius, June 4 1840.</p>

<p>MY LORD,</p>

<p>I have the honour to submit to your Lordship a report upon the
best means of promoting the civilization of the aboriginal
inhabitants of Australia, which report is founded upon a careful
study of the language, prejudices, and traditional customs of
this people.</p>

<p>Feeling anxious to render this report as complete as possible
I have delayed transmitting it to your Lordship until the latest
possible period; portions of it have in the interim been laid
before some of the local governments in Australia, and a few of
the suggestions contained in it have been already acted upon.</p>

<p>But as so small a portion of Australia is as yet occupied, and
the important task of so conducting the occupation of new
districts as to benefit the aborigines in the greatest possible
degree yet remains to be performed, I have thought that it would
be agreeable to your Lordship to be put in possession of all such
facts relating to this interesting subject as are at present
known.</p>

<p>None but general principles, equally applicable to all
portions of the continent of Australia, are embodied in this
report; and I am particularly solicitous that that portion of it
which commences at the 21st paragraph should receive
consideration from your Lordship, as the whole machinery required
to bring this plan into operation now exists in the different
Australian colonies, and its full development would entail no
expense whatever upon either the Home or local Governments.</p>

<p>I have, etc.,</p>

<p>(Signed) G. GREY,</p>

<p>Captain 83rd Regiment,</p>

<p>Commanding Australian Expedition.</p>

<p>Right Honourable Lord John Russell, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>REPORT UPON THE BEST MEANS OF PROMOTING THE CIVILIZATION OF
THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF AUSTRALIA.</p>

<p>1. The aborigines of Australia having hitherto resisted all
efforts which have been made for their civilization, it would
appear that, if they are capable of being civilized, it can be
shown that all the systems on which these efforts have been
founded contain some common error, or that each of them involved
some erroneous principle; the former supposition appears to be
the true one, for they all contained one common element, they all
started with one recognized principle, the presence of which in
the scheme must necessarily have entailed its failure.</p>

<p>2. This principle was that, although the natives should, as
far as European property and European subjects were concerned, be
made amenable to British laws, yet so long as they only exercised
their own customs upon themselves, and not too immediately in the
presence of Europeans, they should be allowed to do so with
impunity.</p>

<p>3. This principle originated in philanthropic motives and a
total ignorance of the peculiar traditional laws of this people,
which laws, differing from those of any other known race, have
necessarily imparted to the people subject to them a character
different from all other races; and hence arises the anomalous
state in which they have been found.</p>

<p>4. They are as apt and intelligent as any other race of men I
am acquainted with; they are subject to the same afflictions,
appetites, and passions as other men, yet in many points of
character they are totally dissimilar to them; and, from the
peculiar code of laws of this people, it would appear not only
impossible that any nation subject to them could ever emerge from
a savage state, but even that no race, however highly endowed,
however civilized, could in other respects remain long in a state
of civilization if they were submitted to the operation of such
barbarous customs.</p>

<p>5. The plea generally set up in defence of this principle is
that the natives of this country are a conquered people, and that
it is an act of generosity to allow them the full power of
exercising their own laws upon themselves; but this plea would
appear to be inadmissible; for, in the first place, savage and
traditional customs should not be confounded with a regular code
of laws; and secondly, when Great Britain insures to a conquered
country the privilege of preserving its own laws, all persons
resident in this territory become amenable to the same laws, and
proper persons are selected by the Government to watch over their
due and equitable administration; nothing of this kind either
exists or can exist with regard to the customs of the natives of
Australia; between these two cases then there is no apparent
analogy.</p>

<p>6. I would submit therefore that it is necessary from the
moment the aborigines of this country are declared British
subjects, they should, as far as possible, be taught that the
British laws are to supersede their own, so that any native who
is suffering under their own customs may have the power of an
appeal to those of Great Britain; or, to put this in its true
light, that all authorized persons should, in all instances, be
required to protect a native from the violence of his fellows,
even though they be in the execution of their own laws.</p>

<p>7. So long as this is not the case the older natives have at
their disposal the means of effectually preventing the
civilization of any individuals of their own tribe, and those
among them who may be inclined to adapt themselves to the
European habits and mode of life will be deterred from so doing
by their fear of the consequences that the displeasure of others
may draw down upon them.</p>

<p>8. So much importance am I disposed to attach to this point
that I do not hesitate to assert my full conviction that, whilst
those tribes which are in communication with Europeans are
allowed to execute their barbarous laws and customs upon one
another, so long will they remain hopelessly immersed in their
present state of barbarism: and, however unjust such a proceeding
might at first sight appear, I believe that the course pointed
out by true humanity would be to make them from the very
commencement amenable to the British laws, both as regards
themselves and Europeans; for I hold it to be imagining a
contradiction to suppose that individuals subject to savage and
barbarous laws can rise into a state of civilization which those
laws have a manifest tendency to destroy and overturn.</p>

<p>9. I have known many instances of natives who have been almost
or quite civilized being compelled by other natives to return to
the bush; more particularly girls who have been betrothed in
their infancy and who, on approaching the years of puberty, have
been compelled by their husbands to join them.</p>

<p>10. It is difficult to ascertain the exact effect the
institutions of a country produce upon the character of its
inhabitants; but it may be readily admitted that, if two savage
races of equal mental endowments, and with the same capacity for
civilization, were subject to two distinct sets of laws, the one
mild and favourable to the development of civilization, the other
bloodthirsty and opposed to it, the former race might gradually
be brought to a knowledge of Christianity and civilization,
whilst precisely similar efforts made with regard to the latter
might be attended with no beneficial result.</p>

<p>11. Again, it would be unfair to consider the laws of the
natives of Australia as any indication of the real character of
this people; for many races who were at one period subject to the
most barbarous laws have, since new institutions have been
introduced amongst them, taken their rank among the civilized
nations of the earth.</p>

<p>12. To punish the aborigines severely for the violation of
laws of which they are ignorant would be manifestly cruel and
unjust; but to punish them in the first instance slightly for the
violation of these laws would inflict no great injury on them,
whilst by always punishing them when guilty of a crime, without
reference to the length of period that had elapsed between its
perpetration and their apprehension, at the same time fully
explaining to them the measure of punishment that would await
them in the event of a second commission of the same fault, would
teach them gradually the laws to which they were henceforth to be
amenable, and would show them that crime was always eventually,
although it might be remotely, followed by punishment.</p>

<p>13. I imagine that this course would be more merciful than
that at present adopted; namely, to punish them for the violation
of a law they are ignorant of, when this violation affects a
European, and yet to allow them to commit this crime as often as
they like when it only regards themselves; for this latter course
teaches them not that certain actions, such, for instance, as
murder, etc., are generally criminal, but only that they are
criminal when exercised towards the white people, and the
impression consequently excited in their minds is that these acts
only excite our detestation when exercised towards ourselves, and
that their criminality consists not in having committed a certain
odious action, but in having violated our prejudices.</p>

<p>14. In the vicinity of towns where there is a certain judicial
force, and where, on account of the facility of obtaining food,
the natives always congregate, it would, by a steady and
determined line of conduct, be comparatively easy to enforce an
observance of the British laws; but, even partially to attain
this object in the remote and thinly settled districts, it is
necessary that each colony should possess an efficient mounted
police, a portion of whom should be constantly in movement from
district to district, whilst another portion, resident in a
central situation, should be ready to act instantly in any
direction where their presence was required. I do not apprehend
that this body need be numerous, for their utility would depend
more on their activity and efficiency than on their numbers. It
is absolutely necessary, for the cause of humanity and good
order, that such a force should exist; for so long as distant
settlers are left unprotected and are compelled to take care of
and avenge themselves, so long must great barbarities necessarily
be committed; and the only way to prevent great crime on the part
of the natives, and massacres of these poor creatures as the
punishment of such crimes, is to check and punish their excesses
in their infancy: it is only after becoming emboldened by
frequent petty successes that they have hitherto committed those
crimes which have drawn down so fearful a vengeance upon
them.</p>

<p>15. The greatest obstacle that presents itself in considering
the application of the British laws to these aborigines is the
fact that, from their ignorance of the nature of an oath, or of
the obligations it imposes, they are not competent to give
evidence before a court of justice; and hence in many cases it
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain
evidence on which a prisoner could be convicted.</p>

<p>16. One mode of evading this difficulty would be to empower
the court to receive evidence from the natives in all cases
relating solely to themselves without the witness being sworn,
only allowing testimony of this nature to hold good when borne
out by very strong circumstantial evidence; secondly to empower
the court always to receive evidence from natives called on by a
native prisoner in his defence, such evidence being subject to
the before-named restrictions.</p>

<p>17. The fact of the natives being unable to give testimony in
a court of justice is a great hardship on them, and they consider
it as such; the reason that occasions their disability for the
performance of this function is at present quite beyond their
comprehension, and it is impossible to explain it to them. I have
been a personal witness to a case in which a native was most
undeservedly punished, from the circumstance of the natives who
were the only persons who could speak as to certain exculpatory
facts not being permitted to give their evidence.</p>

<p>18. There are certain forms in our colonial courts of justice
as at present conducted which it is impossible to make a savage
comprehend. I attended one quarter-sessions at which a number of
natives were tried on a great variety of charges. Several of them
were induced to plead guilty, and on this admission of their
having committed the crime sentence was pronounced upon them. But
when others denied their guilt, and found that this denial
produced no corresponding result in their favour, whilst at the
same time they were not permitted to bring forward other natives
to deny it also, and to explain the matter for them, they became
perfectly confounded. I was subsequently applied to by several
intelligent natives to explain this mystery to them, but I failed
in giving such an explanation as would satisfy them.</p>

<p>19. The natives being ignorant of our laws, of the forms of
our courts of justice, of the language in which the proceedings
are conducted, and the sentence pronounced upon them, it would
appear that but a very imperfect protection is afforded them by
having present in the court merely an interpreter (very often an
ignorant man) who knows nothing of legal proceedings and can be
but very imperfectly acquainted with the native language: it must
also be borne in mind that the natives are not tried by a jury of
their peers, but by a jury having interests directly opposed to
their own, and who can scarcely avoid being in some degree
prejudiced against native offenders. From these considerations I
would suggest that it should be made binding upon the local
government in all instances (or at least in such instances as
affect life) to provide a counsel to defend native prisoners.</p>

<p>20. Some other principal preventives to the civilization of
the aborigines, in addition to those I have already stated,
are:</p>

<p>1. The existence of an uncertain and irregular demand for
their labour: thus they may have one day sufficient opportunity
afforded them for the exertion of their industry, whilst the next
day their services are not required, so that they are compelled
once more to have recourse to their former irregular and
wandering habits.</p>

<p>2. Their generally receiving a very inadequate reward for the
services they render; this, combined with their natural fondness
for the bush, induces them to prefer that mode of subsistence
which, whilst it is infinitely more agreeable and less laborious,
procures for them nearly as great a reward as living with white
people.</p>

<p>3. Their not being taught that different values are attached
to different degrees of labour, as well as to the skill and
neatness with which it is performed.</p>

<p>21. These impediments might all either be removed or modified
in some districts by the establishment of native institutions and
schools, but in forming a general plan for their removal which
would be equally applicable to all parts of a colony, a very
novel difficulty presents itself.</p>

<p>22. Imagining that a native child is perfectly capable of
being civilised, let it also be granted that, from proper
preventive measures having been adopted, this child has nothing
to fear from the vengeance of the other natives, so that it
stands in these respects nearly or altogether in the position of
a European.</p>

<p>23. If this native child is a boy who is to pay the individual
who undertakes to teach him some calling the fee usually given
with an apprentice; who will indemnify this person for the time
he spends in instructing the boy before he can derive any benefit
from his labour, or for the risk he incurs of the boy's services
being bestowed elsewhere as soon as they are worth having?</p>

<p>24. Until this difficulty is got over it appears evident that
the natives will only be employed in herding cattle, or in the
lowest order of manual labour which requires no skill, and for
which the reward they receive will be so small as scarcely to
offer an inducement to them to quit their present wandering mode
of life.</p>

<p>25. The remedy I would suggest for this evil would have
another advantage besides a tendency to ameliorate it, for it
would give the settlers a great and direct interest in the
aborigines without entailing any expense upon the Government. It
is founded on the following fact:</p>

<p>26. The Government, in order to create a supply of labour in
the colonies, have been in the habit of giving certain rewards to
those individuals who introduced labourers into them. Now it
would appear that he who reclaims one of the aborigines not only
adds another labourer to those who are already in the colony, but
further confers such a benefit on his fellow-settlers by
rendering one who was before a useless and dangerous being a
serviceable member of the community, that this circumstance alone
entitles him to a reward.</p>

<p>27. I would therefore propose that, on the production of the
hereafter-named documents, a settler should receive a certificate
entitling him to a certain sum, which should either be allowed to
reckon towards the completion of location duties, or else as a
remission certificate in the purchase of land, or, in lieu of
this, a grant of land; and that this sum or grant should be
regulated according to a table specifying the various
circumstances that are likely to occur, and drawn up by the local
government of each place where such regulation should be
introduced.</p>

<p>28. The documents to which I allude are these:</p>

<p>1. A deposition before the nearest magistrate to such
settler's house that a native or natives have been resident with
him constantly for the last six months, and have been employed in
stated species of labour.</p>

<p>2. A certificate from the government resident of the district
that, to the best of his belief, such statement is true, for
that, on his visiting this settler's house, the stated number of
natives were there, and were respectively occupied in the kinds
of labour described.</p>

<p>3. A certificate from the protector of aborigines that he has
visited this settler's house; that the stated number of natives
were resident there, and appeared to be progressing in the
knowledge of that branch of industry in which they were
respectively stated to be employed.</p>

<p>29. It would be further necessary that any settler who
intended to endeavour to reclaim natives should give a short
notice to the protector of aborigines previously to the
commencement of the first six months.</p>

<p>30. Could this plan be brought into operation the work of the
civilization of the aborigines would at once be commenced upon a
great scale; it would not be confined to a single institution,
but a variety of individuals, endowed with different talents and
capacities for this work, would at once be employed on it: it is
indeed rather suited and intended for the outskirts of
civilization, thinly populated by settlers, than for towns, yet
it is applicable to both situations; whilst its direct operation
would be to induce the settler adequately to remunerate the
native for, as well as to provide him with, a constant supply of
labour, and to use every exertion by kind and proper treatment to
attach him for as long a period as possible to his
establishment.</p>

<p>31. In considering the kinds of labour in which it would be
most advisable to engage natives it should be borne in mind that,
in remote districts where the European population is small, it
would be imprudent to induce many natives to congregate at any
one point, and the kinds of labour in which they should be there
engaged ought to be of such a nature as to have a tendency to
scatter them over the country, and to distribute them amongst the
separate establishments.</p>

<p>32. Whilst in the well-peopled districts, where a force
sufficient both to protect and control the aborigines exists,
they should be induced to assemble in great numbers, for they
work much more readily when employed in masses, and, by thus
assembling them on one point, their numbers are diminished in
those portions of the colony which have a small European
population, and they are concentrated at a spot where proper
means for their improvement can be provided.</p>

<p>33. The first of these principles has been strictly attended
to in the plan proposed in the 27th and following paragraphs of
this report; the second has been carried into successful
operation in Western Australia.</p>

<p>34. In order that the work on which the natives are employed
in the vicinity of towns should be of the most advantageous
nature it is necessary that it should be productive of benefit
both to themselves and the Government which employs them, so that
it cannot be complained of as a useless expense, whilst at the
same time it should be of such a kind as to accord with that love
of excitement and change which is so peculiar to this people.</p>

<p>35. Both of these ends would be attained by employing the
aborigines either in opening new roads or in repairing old lines
of communication; indeed this mode of employment is singularly
suited to the habits of this people; they might be kept
constantly moving from post to post, thus varying the scene of
their operations; one portion of the party might be employed in
hunting with kangaroo-dogs, or fishing, in order to supply the
others with fresh meat; and the species of labour in which the
main body were engaged might, if they wished it, be changed once
or twice in the course of the day to prevent their being wearied
by the monotonous character of their employment.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>36. Among other enactments which I believe would have a
tendency to promote the civilization of the aborigines, and which
are applicable to those districts in which for some time a great
intercourse has existed between the natives and Europeans, are
the following:</p>

<p>37. That any native who could produce a certificate (from the
protector of aborigines) of having been constantly employed at
the house of any settler or settlers, for a period of not less
than three years, should be entitled to a grant of land, the
extent of which should be fixed by the local government of the
colony to which such native should belong, and that, if possible,
this grant should be given in that district to which this native
by birth belonged.</p>

<p>That, in addition to this grant, he should receive a sum of
money, the amount of which should also be fixed by the local
government, and which should be drawn from the fund raised by the
sale of Government lands, and which sum should be expended in
goats, poultry, etc., so as to enable the native in some manner
to stock his land.</p>

<p>That any native, having only one wife, who produced a
certificate of the civil marriage contract having been performed
between himself and her, by the resident of the district to which
he belonged, should be entitled to a small reward.</p>

<p>That any natives who registered duly the birth of any of their
children should be entitled to a small reward.</p>

<p>That some competent person should be paid to instruct two
native boys in such a manner as to qualify them to act as
interpreters in courts of law, and that as soon as they are found
competent they should be employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>I believe that many other regulations, similar to these, would
be found to produce a very beneficial effect.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B.</h3>

<p>MOUNT FAIRFAX, THE WIZARD HILLS, AND CHAMPION BAY.</p>

<p>(From the Nautical Magazine for July 1841 page 443.)</p>

<p>The only part of the West coast (to the northward of Swan
River) that has been visited by the Beagle is that part
immediately to the eastward of the Abrolhos, and it is remarkable
from being under the high tableland of Moresby's Flat-topped
Range, which is a considerable elevation, and in clear weather is
visible from a ship's mast-head at the Abrolhos.</p>

<p>This range of hills extends north-north-west six miles from
Mount Fairfax, which, although a detached hill, may be considered
its southern extreme. Mount Fairfax is a table-topped hill, the
summit of which is an elevated part at its southern edge, and is
590 feet high. It is in latitude 28 degrees 45 1/4 minutes, and
longitude 1 degree 3 3/4 minutes west of Swan River, and 4 miles
from the coast. To the south-east of Moresby's Flat-topped Range
are the Wizard Hills, the highest of which, Wizard Peak, is 640
feet. It is in latitude 28 degrees 49 minutes 37 seconds south
and longitude 0 degrees 58 1/2 minutes west of Swan River. For 10
1/2 miles to the northward of Moresby's Flat-topped Range are
some remarkable detached ranges of tableland, from 500 to 600
feet high, at the northern extreme of which are the Menai Hills.
Some of them show as peaks, but appear only to be the gable ends,
as it were, of table-topped ridges.</p>

<p>In latitude 28 degrees 47 minutes south there is a narrow neck
of low land projecting about 1 3/4 miles from the coastline, to
the northward of which there is good anchorage in Champion
Bay.</p>

<p>Point Moore, which is the extreme of this low projection,
bears west 13 degrees south (magnetic) from Mount Fairfax, and
west 17 degrees north (magnetic) from Wizard Peak. The anchorage
is protected from the westward by a reef that extends upwards of
a mile to the northward from Point Moore: but half a mile to the
northward of the reef is a detached shoal patch which breaks
occasionally, between which and the reef there is a passage
through which the Beagle passed, and had not less than six
fathoms. But perhaps it would be advisable in standing into the
bay to pass to the northward of this danger, which may be done by
not bringing Mount Fairfax to bear to the southward of east 1/4
south (magnetic) until Point Moore bears south.</p>

<p>This bay is open to the northward, but, as the winds from that
quarter are not frequent, and then only in the winter season, it
may be considered as affording shelter from the prevailing winds
on the coast. The water is shoal in the head of the bay, but a
good anchorage may be taken three-quarters of a mile off shore in
four fathoms sandy bottom, with Point Moore bearing south 50
degrees west and a remarkable bare brown sandhill in the
south-east part of the bay, bearing south 31 degrees east. Mount
Fairfax will then bear north 87 minutes east, and the north
extreme of the reef from Point Moore north 50 minutes west.
Wizard Peak is not seen from this anchorage.</p>

<p>South of Point Moore is another bay formed by a continuation
of the same reef that shelters Champion Bay from the westward;
but it is quite exposed to the prevailing winds. From Champion
Bay the coast to the northward is sandy, and fronted by sandhills
slightly covered with shrubs. This description of coast continues
for nearly twenty miles. In latitude 28 degrees 25 minutes is a
remarkable white sand-patch 274 feet above the sea, between two
and three miles south of which is a deep ravine where there is
probably a stream of fresh water. Here the shore becomes steeper,
and rises abruptly from the sea, forming downs about 300 feet
high. Native fires were seen in this neighbourhood, and the
country had a more fertile appearance than in the vicinity of
Champion Bay. This part of the coast is bold too, and is free
from outlaying dangers, the depth of water from two to three
miles off shore being taken between 16 and 29 fathoms. High-water
at Champion Bay takes place on change days at 9 hours 30 minutes
P.M. nearly, and the range is from 12 to 24 inches. The stream of
tide is not perceptible, but there is generally a current along
the coast to the north-north-west from half a mile to one mile an
hour.</p>

<p>Champion Bay appears to be the only anchorage on the coast
between Swan River and Shark Bay: it is preferable to Gage's
Road, and may at no very distant period become of importance to
Western Australia in consequence of a considerable tract of fine
country having lately been discovered immediately to the eastward
of Moresby's Flat-topped Range.</p>

MAMMALIA OF AUSTRALIA, WITH NOTES ON SOME RECENTLY DISCOVERED
SPECIES, BY J.E. GRAY, F.R.S., ETC. ETC., IN A LETTER ADDRESSED
TO THE AUTHOR.</p>

<p>British Museum, 10th July 1841.</p>

<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>The very little attention which has hitherto been paid to the
distribution of the animals of Australia, and the very incorrect
manner in which the habitats of the different species are given
in collections and systematic works, have induced me to send you,
with the description of the new species recently brought from
that country, a table showing at one view the distribution of the
different species which have hitherto been recorded as found in
Australia, as far as the materials at my disposal will allow
me.</p>

any Museum; as, besides the specimens which we have been
collecting from different quarters, with the kind assistance of

Gould from different parts of this Continent; and these specimens
were all marked with the habitat immediately after they were
procured.</p>

<p>Glires 11.</p>

<p>This list shows the progress which has taken place in the
knowledge of the Australian animals; for only a few years ago it
was generally stated that the Australian dog was the only
non-Marsupial animal found on the continent.</p>

<p>The following species appear to be new to science.</p>

<p>Number 1. Rhinolophus megaphyllus, Gray Proceedings of the
Zoological Society 1834 52.</p>

<p>Brown, end of the hairs of the back with small, and on the
lower side of the body with longer, grey tips. Ears with two
hairy lines on each side. Wings with little tufts of short hairs
near the side of the body beneath. (Nose leaf destroyed.) Body, 2
inches 3-12; fore-arm, 1 11-12; tail 11-12; fore-legs, 9-12;
ears, 7-12.</p>

<p>Number 2. Scotophilus morio, Gray.</p>

<p>Back uniform, brownish black, scarcely paler beneath; cheeks
nearly black; underside of wings, and interfemoral membrane with
lines of hairs; heel bone elongated, slender; ears moderate
rounded; tragus oblong blunt; fore-arm bone, 1 10-12; shin bone,
9-12 of an inch.</p>

<p>Number 4. Scotophilus gouldii, Gray.</p>

<p>Blackish, hinder half of the back brownish; sides and abdomen
brownish ash; ears rather large, broad; tragus half ovate;
underside of the wings and interfemoral membrane with lines of
hairs.</p>

<p>Var. 1. Hinder part of the back greyish; sides of the abdomen
grey. Inhabits Australasia, Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>Number 5. Scotophilus australis, Gray.</p>

<p>Back blackish; tips of the hairs rather browner; beneath
rather paler on the sides of the abdomen; ears small; tragus oval
lanceolate, rather crescent-shaped; wings, with sixteen or
eighteen oblique cross lines of hairs under each fore-arm, and
scattered hairs on the sides of the body; fore-arm, bone, 1 5-12;
shin bone, 15-24. Var. rather larger fore-arm bone, 1 7-12; shin
bone, 17-24.</p>

<p>Number 6. Scotophilus pumilus, Gray.</p>

<p>Grey brown, base of the fur blackish, beneath paler; cheeks
blackish; ears small, rather thin, longer than the fur; tragus
elongate, half as long as the ears, rounded at the end; wings
nearly bald, except near the arm-pit; interfemoral membrane hairy
at the base; heel-bone elongate, two-thirds the length of the
margin of the interfemoral membrane. Head and body, 1 2-12; tail
11-12; fore-arm bone, 1 2-12.</p>

<p>This species, Mr. Gould notes, flies quick and low over
water.</p>

<p>Number 7. Molossus australis. See Gray, Magazine of Zoology
and Botany volume 2 501.</p>

<p>Number 15. Dasyurus viverrinus.</p>

<p>Mr. Gould has observed that the black and yellowish varieties
are sometimes found together in the same litter. There is an
intermediate variety, blackish, with olive tips to the hairs. Dr.
Shaw's specific name should be retained.</p>

<p>Number 18. Phascogale affinis, Gray.</p>

<p>Above brown, grizelled with yellowish-brown tips to the hairs;
beneath grey brown; under fur lead colour; tail short. Male
darker; length of body and head 6 1/2; tail 4 1/2. Female, length
of the body and head 4 1/2; tail 2 3/4 inches. Inhabits Tasman's
Peninsula, Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>This may be the same as P. minima of Geoffroy, but the tail is
longer for its size.</p>

<p>Number 19. Phascogale rufogaster, Gray.</p>

<p>Head grey; back and sides brown, with longer black hairs;
sides of the belly and feet bright rufous; lips and chin whitish;
under fur lead colour; tail end blackish-brown, slightly
pencilled. Body and head, 4; tail, 2 inches. Inhabits South
Australia, Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>Number 22. Phascogale leucogaster, Gray.</p>

<p>Head and shoulders grey, behind rather browner, with scattered
longer black-tipped hairs; chin and beneath pure white; feet
brownish grey. Body and head, 4; tail, 2 1/2 inches.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia, banks of the Canning River, April
1839, Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>More specimens and further observations may prove these to be
only local varieties of one species; but the specimens we have
from the same localities are similar in character, which is not
the case with the different specimens of Hepoona.</p>

<p>Number 26. Perameles fasciata, Gray.</p>

<p>Grey brown, rump with three black bands; tail white, with a
black streak along the upper side. Inhabits Liverpool Plains and
South Australia; smaller than P. gunnii.</p>

<p>Number 28. Perameles fusciventer, Gray.</p>

<p>Brown, yellow grizelled; tail above blackish, beneath grey;
head short, conical; belly grey brown, with broad rufous
channelled hairs. This species is like P. obesula in colour, but
the head is shorter, and the belly of that species is white, with
white bristles.</p>

<p>Number 37. Dromicia nana.</p>

<p>The dentition and the peculiar form and character of the tail
of this species at once point out that it should constitute a
distinct genus from the other Phalangers, from which it differs
in many of its habits.</p>

<p>Number 38. Hepoona cookii.</p>

<p>Specimens from the same locality differ from one another in
the extent of the white on the tail, in the darkness of the
colour of the fur, and in the limbs and sides of the body being
of the colour of the back, or more or less rufous. There are
either five or six species, or only one.</p>

<p>Number 39.</p>

<p>I have retained the name of Petaurista for the flying
Phalangers with hairy ears, as Dr. Shaw's Didelphis petaurus is
evidently the same as P. flaviventer, and has naked ears, like
the other species, and his name Petaurus should be used rather
than Mr. Waterhouse's Belideus for this genus.</p>

<p>Number 40.</p>

<p>Petaurista leucogaster, may only be a variety of P.
taguanoides.</p>

<p>Number 42. Petaurus macrourus.</p>

<p>This species is only known from the figures of Dr. Shaw. They
have a specimen of a young Petaurista taguanoides, under this
name, in the Paris Museum.</p>

<p>Number 43. Petaurus breviceps.</p>

<p>This is probably the species called P. peronii in Mr. G.
Bennett's catalogue of the Australian Museum. It may also be M.
Desmarest's; if this is so, the latter name will have to be
adopted, and the one first used erased from the list.</p>

<p>Number 47.</p>

<p>The Macropi with hairy muffles are found in grassy places,
while the Halmaturi are confined to the scrubs; and the
Petrogalae, or Rock-Kangaroos, to the rocky districts; the
latter, like Bettongia, sit with their tail between the legs. Mr.
Gould informs me the animals of the latter genus also use their
tails for the purpose of carrying the grass to their nests. The
tree Kangaroos of New Guinea have a tail somewhat like a
squirrel. These differences of habit show the propriety of
dividing this group of animals into genera.</p>

<p>Number 48. Macropus laniger.</p>

<p>This name must be rejected as the animal is not wool-bearing.
The skin in the Paris Museum is made up with the skin of a sheep.
M. Desmarest's description of the female M. rufogriseus in the
New Dictionary, very nearly agrees with this species, but Mr.
Gould is inclined to consider the specimen he was shown for that
species in the Paris Museum was M. major.</p>

<p>Number 57. Halmaturus elegans.</p>

<p>The description of Mr. Lambert is so short that it has
hitherto been considered impossible to determine it with
accuracy; but on comparing the coloured plate which is bound up
with Sir Joseph Banks' copy of the volume of the Transactions
containing the paper, now in the Museum Library, with the
specimens of kangaroos in the Museum collection, I have very
little doubt of its being intended for one which Mr. Gould
considers as identical with M. ruficollis of M. Desmarest. M.
Desmarest's animal is said to come from King's Island, in Bass
Strait, while Mr. Gould's animal, like the one Mr. Lambert
described, is from New South Wales. Mr. Gunn remarks that H.
billardieri is common in the locality indicated by M.
Desmarest.</p>

<p>Number 67. Petrogale brachyotis.</p>

<p>This species was discovered by Captain G. Grey, in his
expedition, and the specimens he collected he gave to Mr. Gould,
who described them, and is now about to figure them in his
forthcoming monograph of the species of kangaroos: a work which
will be as far superior to any other published on Mammalia in
beauty of design and accuracy in the execution of the plates as
his work on Birds has been to any that has hitherto appeared
either in England or on the Continent. The specimens are now in
the collection of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Number 84. Mus lutreola.</p>

<p>Back black and yellowish grizelled, with longer black hairs;
sides yellowish grey, beneath grey lead colour, under fur lead
colour; ears with scattered short adpressed hairs; whiskers
black; front teeth yellow; tail with short black adpressed
bristles; length of body and head 7, tail 4, hind-feet 1 1-4
inches. The water-rat of the South Australian Colonist. Inhabits
South Australia, River Torrens, Bass Strait, New South Wales;
Musquito Islands and Macdonald's River, Van Diemen's Land,
Tasman's Peninsula. J. Gould, Esquire.</p>

<p>Number 85. Mus greyii, Gray.</p>

<p>Fur brown, with close long slender pale-tipped black hairs;
sides yellowish-brown; throat and beneath yellowish; feet
whiteish; ears nearly naked, with close-pressed short greyish
hairs; tail with close-pressed brown hairs. Variety; belly rather
more greyish-white. Inhabits South Australia, June. Length, body
and head 6, tail 4 3/4, hind-feet 1 1/12 of an inch.</p>

<p>Number 86. Mus adelaidensis.</p>

<p>Fur soft, brown, with scattered rather longer black tipped
hairs, beneath pale grey brown; the under fur lead coloured;
whiskers black; ears moderate, covered with short close-pressed
hairs; tail elongate, brown; cutting teeth pale yellow,
compressed; body and head 3, tail 3 inches, hind-feet 8-12.
Inhabits South Australia. J. Gould, Esquire.</p>

<p>In examining the Geographical distribution of the Genera, as
exhibited in the foregoing table, as far as our present knowledge
of these animals extends we may state that the genera Choeropus,
Acrobates, Petaurista, Lagorchestes, Phascolarctos, Hapalotis,
and Pseudomys, are peculiar to New South Wales. The genus
Petaurus is also found in New South Wales, but not in the Island
of Van Diemen's Land and the rest of the continent, but one of
the species living there is also said to be an inhabitant of
Norfolk Island, where it may probably have been introduced.</p>

<p>The species of the genera Petrogale and Bettongia are common
to New South Wales, South Australia, and the North-west Coast;
but they are not found in Van Diemen's Land, and the genus
Myrmecobius appears to be peculiar to Western Australia, for it
is not by any means certain that the red shrew-mouse discovered
in Australia Felix by Sir T. Mitchell belongs to this genus.</p>

<p>The Genera Thylacinus, Diabolus, and Dromicia, are peculiar to
Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>The species of the genera Dasyurus and Perameles are very
abundant in Van Diemen's Land, but they have also representatives
which are found in New Holland.</p>

<p>The species of the genera Nyctophilus, Phalangista, Hepoona,
Phascogale, Macropus, Halmaturus, Hypsiprymnus, and Hydromys,
appear to be common to all parts of the continent, and also to
Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>The genera Echidna and Ornithorhynchus are found in New
Holland and Van Diemen's Land, but I have not heard of their
having been discovered in the Western or Southern parts of the
continent of Australia.</p>

<p>There are some of the genera of the non-Marsupial animals, as
Rhinolophus and Pteropus, which are common to various parts of
Australia and the different parts of the Old World, and others,
as Canis, Mus, Scotophilus, and Molossus, which are common to it
and to both Hemispheres. Two Marsupial genera, Halmaturus and
Perameles, have species found in New Guinea, but most probably,
when they have been more carefully examined, they will be found
to form a peculiar genus, allied to the Australian animals, as is
the case with the tree-kangaroos (Dendrolegus) and the Phalangers
(Cuscus) of that country. We have a specimen of the Halmaturus in
the British Museum, from the Leyden collection, but like many of
the specimens in that collection, where the zoological specimens
are made subservient to the anatomical predilections of the
conservator, it has no skull, and false claws, which renders it
impossible for me to define its characters. The tail has rings of
scales under the hair, but this is also the case with most
Halmaturi.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the consideration of the distribution of
the species, over the different districts of Australasia, it may
be remarked that this is a subject surrounded with considerable
difficulty, as different naturalists do not always apply the same
test to determine the distinction of the species, some
considering the differences found in the specimens from different
localities, as merely local varieties, and others regarding them
as distinct; and others again declaring that several specimens,
which cabinet naturalists are in the habit of regarding as only
accidental varieties from the examination of the skins, are quite
distinct when they are observed alive in their native habitat. In
the preceding list, when all the specimens I have seen from a
particular habitat have a similar and peculiar character, I have
considered them as species; on the contrary when the specimens
from the same locality offer variations among themselves, as in
those of the genus Hepoona, where the extent of the whiteness on
the tail, and the variation in the colour of the body appear to
differ in the specimens from the same place, I have regarded them
as belonging to the same species, believing it to be a variable
species which has an extensive range.</p>

<p>From the Table already given it appears that, of the species
found on the Australian Continent, 71 are confined to it, 12
common to it and Van Diemen's Land, and one common to it and
Norfolk Island; while of the 24 species found on Van Diemen's
Land, 11 are found in it alone.</p>

<p>The species common to the Australian Continent and Van
Diemen's Land, are:</p>

<p>2. Nyctophilus geoffroyii.</p>

<p>4. Scotophilus gouldii.</p>

<p>5. Scotophilus australis.</p>

<p>15. Dasyurus viverrinus.</p>

<p>The species common to Australia and Norfolk Island, but not
found in Van Diemen's Land is:</p>

<p>44. Petaurus sciureus.</p>

<p>The eleven species peculiar to Van Diemen's Land, are:</p>

<p>11. Thylacinus cynocephalus.</p>

have been introduced. It has been known in Van Diemen's Land some
years, and does not appear to have found its way to
Australia.</p>

<p>In the New South Wales district there have been recorded the
following: some of them may have a larger distribution on the
Continent, when these countries become better known, and some of
them (marked with a star*) are common to this district, and Van

<p>62. Halmaturus parma.</p>

<p>64 ? Halmaturus banksianus.</p>

<p>66. Petrogale robusta.</p>

<p>90. Hapalotis mitchellii.</p>

<p>92. Echidna aculeata.</p>

<p>94.* Ornithorhynchus paradoxus.</p>

<p>Two species are remarkable as being common to the East and
South sides of the Continent, namely:</p>

<p>48. Macropus laniger.</p>

<p>84. Mus lutreola.</p>

<p>26.* P. fasciata.</p>

<p>The latter is also found in Van Diemen's Land. And the four
following species are common to the South, West, and East sides
of the Continent:</p>

<p>5. Scotophilus australis.</p>

<p>32. Phalangista vulpina.</p>

<p>38. Hepoona cookii, and varieties.</p>

<p>81. Hydromys chrysogaster.</p>

<p>These are all also found in Van Diemens' Land, and may
therefore be considered as the most generally distributed of all
the Australian animals. Both the Phalangista and the Hepoona are
very variable in their colours, and may prove to comprise
different species when we are enabled to examine a larger number
of specimens from different localities.</p>

11.2. Soridia lineata (Gray).</b></p>
</center>

<p>I have been induced to add to the foregoing list the following
observations on the more obscure and hitherto unknown genera and
species.</p>

<p>RONIA, Gray. Head rather shelving, shielded with one
transverse frontal and two large vertebral plates, the hinder
largest; the rostral plates large, with two unequal superciliary
plates. The nasal plate triangular, interposed between the
rostral plate and the frontal ones, with the nostrils in its
centre; loreal plates two, square; labial plates large; ears
none, only a very indistinct sunk dot in their place. Body
cylindrical; tail conical, tapering. Scales smooth, ovate,
imbricate, those of the belly 6-sided. The front limbs very
small, rudimentary, undivided; the hinder limbs moderately
developed, ending in two very unequal toes, with distinct
claws.</p>

<p>35. Ronia catenulata, Gray, t. 4 f. 1.</p>

<p>Back grey, with eight series of small black dots, one dot on
the centre of each scale; cheeks black speckled; sides and
beneath whitish.</p>

<p>Body 3 1/2, tail 2 1/2 inches.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia. Mr. J. Gould.</p>

<p>The scales under the tail are rather larger, and the spots on
the tail are also rather larger than those on the back.</p>

<p>38. Lialis burtonii, t. 3 f. 1. Gray Proceedings of the
Zoological Society 1834 134. Dumeril and Bibron H. R. 831.</p>

<p>Pale brown, back with three longitudinal brown streaks, each
occupying half of two series of scales; the centre streak divided
into two over the nape and head, uniting together again over the
tip of the nose.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia. J. Gould.</p>

<p>Family Pygopidae.</p>

<p>Head short, with two or three pairs of narrow frontal shields,
similar to, and behind the nasal shield, with two odd large
vertebral shields; nostrils oblong, in the suture between the
outer angle of the nasal shield and the front loreal shields;
ears distinct, tympanum sunk; eyes surrounded with a series of
scales; belly with two or four series of broad 6-sided ventral
shields; tail with three series of broader shields, the central
the broadest; limbs two, rudimentary, undivided, scaly, on the
side of the vent; throat covered with small scales; lower labial
plates large.</p>

<p>Pygopus. The scales of the back keeled, with a series of
numerous praeanal pores; pupil round; the hinder limbs
elongate.</p>

<p>Delma. The scales smooth; praeanal pores none; pupil
elliptical, erect; hinder limbs short.</p>

<p>42. Soridia lineata, t. 3, f. 2.</p>

<p>M. Bibron in the work quoted observes: La Soridia lineata de
M. Gray n'est pas different d'une espece de Scincoiden du Cap que
nous avons vue dans la collection de M. Smith a Chatham et de
laquelle nous avions pris une description qui s'est
malheureusement egaree. Page 787. And again: Nous croyons que
c'est par erreur que M. Gray a indique cette espece comme
provenant de la Nouvelle Hollande, nous pensons plutot qu'elle
est originaire du Cap, et la meme que celle dont nous parlions
tout a l'heure ou le Scincoidien que d'accord avec le Dr. Smith
nous nous proposions d'appeller Praepeditus lineatus. Page
788.</p>

<p>I do not know what Dr. Smith's animal may be, but the account
of Praepeditus, given by M. Bibron, is only a translation of my
description of Soridia! It is not probable that this animal
should come both from Australia and the Cape. It is certainly
from New Holland.</p>

<p>44. APRASIA.</p>

<p>The head small, shielded; muzzle rounded, rather produced,
with two pairs of large frontal shields, covering the cheeks, a
large six-sided elongated vertebral shield, and a pair of small
superciliar shields; rostral and labial shields large, few; the
nostrils small, in the sutures between the tip of the front upper
labial, and the anterior frontal plates; eyes circular, edged
with a series of small scales; pupil round; ears none; body and
tail cylindrical, tapering, covered with hexangular scales, the
ventral shields rather broader; limbs none.</p>

<p>By some mistake the slip containing the description of this
genus in my synopsis of the slender-tongued Saurians got into the
wrong place with the Tiliquae instead of being near Anguis.</p>

<p>56. Grammatophora muricata.</p>

<p>The young animals have a series of small spines on each side
of the base of the tail, and a series of spots on each side of
the back.</p>

<p>Mr. Gould has brought home two very distinct local
varieties.</p>

<p>Var. 1 diemenensis. Young dark-coloured, with vermiculated
marks on the chin, chest, and abdomen. The adult dark, beneath
gray, varied with black spots placed in irregular lines.</p>

<p>Inhabits Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>Var. 2 adelaidensis. Young pale above and beneath, with three
broad diverging black lines on the chin, leaving an oblong spot
in the centre of the throat, with a broad streak on the chest
separated into three lines on the abdomen, which unite together
again on the pubis. The adult gray, with a few spots beneath.</p>

<p>58. Grammatophora decresii, Dumeril and Bibron, Erp. Gen. 4
472. ?</p>

<p>Tail conical, with nearly regular scales, the base rather
swollen, without any series of spines on the side; the nape and
back with a series of rather larger, low, compressed scales; back
with small sub-equal scales, and a few larger ones in cross
series; side of the head near the ears and side of neck with two
or three ridges crowned with short conical spines. In spirits
black, yellow spotted and varied, beneath gray, vermiculated with
blackish; tail black-ringed.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>So much smaller than G. muricata that I might have considered
them as young animals if one of them had not had the body filled
with well-formed eggs; and the tail is much shorter in comparison
than even in the young of that species.</p>

<p>They agree in most points with the description given by
Messieurs Dumeril and Bibron, but not in the colour and in the
size of the tail. The specimens in our collection greatly differ
in their colour, but are all very different from any other
species.</p>

<p>59. Grammatophora cristata. Nape with a crest of distinct,
rather short, curved, compressed, spinose scales; back and tail
with a series of compressed keeled scales, forming a slight keel;
occiput with separate short strong conical spines: sides of the
neck and back with folds crowned with series of short compressed
scales; base of the tail with some scattered larger scales. In
spirits, dull olive; crown black with large white spots, beneath
black; middle of the belly, and undersides of the base of the
tail white; tail with black rings at the end; feet whitish.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia. Mr. J. Gould.</p>

<p>The underside is coloured somewhat like G. maculatus (G.
gaimardii, Dumeril and Bibron) but the sides of the head near the
ears are spinose, and the nape is distinctly crested.</p>

<p>But as Dumeril and Bibron's species is only described from a
single specimen which is in a bad state, and has lost its
epidermis, and as the description itself, though long, refers
chiefly to parts which do not differ in the species of the genus,
this species may prove not to be different from it.</p>

<p>These authors, in giving the character of Grammatophora
gaimardii and G. decresii, appears to place great reliance on the
one having tubular and the other non-tubular femoral pores, which
is a fact entirely dependent on the state in which the animal
might be at the time when it was put into the spirits, as I have
verified by comparing numerous specimens of different reptiles
furnished with these pores.</p>

<p>But in this genus the size of the pores is apparently of less
importance than in many others, for they appear to be quite
invisible in some states of the animal: thus out of many
specimens of G. muricata brought by Mr. Gould from Van Diemen's
Land and Western Australia, eight specimens have no visible
pores; these specimens differ from the others in being of a
rather paler colour beneath. This state of the pores may entirely
depend on the manner in which they were preserved, for all these
specimens had a slit made into their abdomen to admit the
spirits; while in all the specimens in which this care had not
been taken the pores are distinctly seen, sometimes moderately
sized, and at others tubularly produced.</p>

<p><b>12. Moloch horridus (Gray).</b></p>
</center>

<p>60. MOLOCH, Gray.</p>

<p>Body depressed, covered with irregular, unequal, small,
granular plates, each furnished with a more or less prominent
central spine, and with a series of large, conical, convex, acute
spines; head and limbs covered with similar scales and spines;
head small, with very large spines over each of the eyebrows;
tail with irregular rings of large acute spines; femoral and
subanal pores none; teeth small, subequal; toes 5.5, short,
covered above and below with keeled scales; claws long,
acute.</p>

<p>The external appearance of this Lizard is the most ferocious
of any that I know, the horns of the head and the numerous spines
on the body giving it a most formidable aspect. The scales of the
back are small and unequal; they gradually increase in size as
they approach the base of the conical spines, which is surrounded
with a ring of larger scales with longer spines; the large spines
are conical; rather compressed, spinulose below, smooth and acute
at the tip, and are usually furnished with a sharp-toothed ridge
on the front edge, and sometimes on both. These spines only
consist of a horny sheath, placed on a fleshy process of the
exact form and appearance of the spines they bear.</p>

<p>The scales of the underside of the body are of the same form
as those of the back, and are furnished with similar but smaller
and less produced spines. The back of the neck of the two
specimens I have seen is furnished with a large rounded
protuberance like a cherry, covered with large granular spinous
scales, and armed on each side with a large conical spine; but I
do not know if this is common to the species or merely accidental
in these individuals; at any rate it adds considerably to the
singularity of their appearance.</p>

<p>I have named this genus, from its appearance, after "Moloch,
horrid king."</p>

<p>60. Moloch horridus, t. 2.</p>

<p>Pale yellow, marked with dark regular spots; sides and beneath
with black-edged dark red similar spots.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia. The Honourable Captain G. Grey,
and John Gould, Esquire.</p>

<p>The marks on the body are very definite, but from the
irregularity of their form they are not easily described.</p>

<p>The lips are dark brown, with two streaks up to the small
spines on the forehead; there is a dark cross-band from the base
of the two large horns over the eyebrows, running behind, and
then dividing into broad streaks, one along each side of the
centre of the back of the neck to between the shoulders, crossing
the nuchal swelling. In the middle of the back there is a very
large black patch nearly extending from side to side, and over
the loins are two oblong longitudinal black spots; the dark lines
commencing from the lower angle of each eye extend along the
upper part of each side to the upper part of the groin; the front
of the fore- and hind-legs, and the sides are marked with similar
dark bands.</p>

<p>A dark band commences from the hinder part of the lower lip,
merging in the throat, and expanding out so as to be united
together at the back part of the chin. There is a large rather
oblong spot in the centre of the chest and the hinder part of the
abdomen, separated from each other by a large somewhat triangular
spot on each side of the middle of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Body 4 1/2 inches.</p>

<p>This is the Spinous Lizard exhibited by Mr. Gould at the
meeting of the Zoological Society in October 1840.</p>

<p>64. Tropidonotus mairii, Gray.</p>

<p>Olive, beneath pale olive, vertebral scales darker, slightly
spotted; labial shield pale, dark edged. The dorsal and lateral
scales keeled, placed in longitudinal series; the keels
continued, equal; chin shields two pairs, long; throat scaly on
the sides, shielded in the middle; loreal shields equal; one high
anterior, and three small posterior ocular shields; temples
shielded; nostrils in the suture between the scales; the anterior
frontal narrow, moderate; eyes large, convex, pupil round.</p>

<p>Inhabits New Holland, Dr. Mair, 39th Regiment.</p>

<p>White, in the Appendix to his Journal, mentions and figures
two snakes (n. 1 and 2 page 258) but his descriptions are so
short, and his figures so indistinct, compared with what are now
required to determine the species of snakes, that I am unable to
apply them with certainty to any of the species here
recorded.</p>

<p>68. Naja bungaroides, var.</p>

<p>Brown. Varied with a few whitish cross bands; last series of
scales and beneath whitish ventral shield black in front;
subcaudal plates, one-rowed; throat scaly; chin shields two
pairs; eyes lateral, pupil round; front pair of frontal plates
short; nostrils lateral, in two small shields, loreal shields
none; one large anterior, and two moderate posterior ocular
shields; lower temporal shield in the labial ones. Scales quite
smooth, broad.</p>

<p>Inhabits New Holland. Dr. Mair.</p>

<p>69. Trimesurus leptocephalus.</p>

<p>Lacepede described this species twice, once as a Boa, and then
as a Trimesurus. Mr. Schlegel observes that there is one of
Baudin's original specimens in the Leyden collection, and that
the scales are not in the least keeled, though Lacepede described
them to be so. Lesson believing it to be an undescribed species
formed for it his genus Acanthophis; Wagler has also formed two
genera for this single species; and Cuvier formed from a variety
of it with subcaudal bands a third genus, under the name of
Oplocephalus.</p>

<p>70. Trimesurus olivaceus, Gray.</p>

<p>Olive-green, scales black; head dark with a black streak along
each side, enclosing the eyes and united by a black band across
the nape; lips, and beneath white; lips and chin black dotted,
front of ventral shields blackish, throat scaly, chin shields two
pairs. Under the epidermis bluish green; body elongate, tapering;
tail moderate tapering, subeaudal shields one-rowed, longer
towards the tip; scales all smooth, imbricated, subequal, rather
larger below; head small, rather tapering in front, rounded; eyes
rather small, pupil round, head shields normal; the nostrils
lateral in the suture between two shields, hinder shield
elongate; loreal shields none; one large anterior and two
moderate post-ocular shields; labial shields subequal, lower
temporal inserted.</p>

<p>Inhabits New Holland. Dr. Mair.</p>

<p>71. Calamaria diadema, t. 5 f. 3.</p>

<p>Body cylindrical, scales small; ventral shields brown,
rounded; tail rather short, tapering; subcaudal plates two,
round. Head small, indistinct, moderately long; head shields
normal, first frontal small; nostril lunate, in the middle of a
triangular nasal shield; no loreal; one rather large upper
anterior, two posterior ocular shields, lowest largest; temples
shielded; labial shield moderate. White dorsal scales with a
distinct brown edge; head and nape black, with a broad white
occipital band; beneath white.</p>

<p>New Holland. Dr. Mair.</p>

<p>72. Calamaria annulata, Gray. Snake, n. 2. White's Journal
Appendix 259 f. 2.</p>

<p>White (in spirits) with twenty-eight black rings (twenty-five
on the body and three on the tail;) head with two black bands,
one on the end of the nose and the other with the eyes in front
of it. Tip of the tail black; eyes small, pupil round; nostrils
in the centre of a shield, lateral, erect; loreal shields none;
one anterior oblique, and two small post-ocular shields.</p>

<p>Inhabits New Holland. Dr. Lewis.</p>

<p>74. Tortrix australis.</p>

<p>Pale olive, scales black-edged, on the sides widest; beneath
bluish, with a white edged black band across the end of the
muzzle; a white band before the front and back of the eyes, and a
triangular black spot at the lower hinder angle of the eyes;
pupil round; one large and two posterior ocular shields, no
loreal shields; nostrils lateral, in the suture between the two
nasal shields; scales smooth imbricate, those of the sides
larger, of the tail six-sided.</p>

<p>77. Elaps gouldii, Gray, t. 5 f. 1.</p>

<p>Pale yellowish; the scales of the back small, 6-sided, with a
dark anterior margin, giving the back a netted appearance. Top of
the head and nape black, with a yellow spot on the rostral scale
on each side just before the eyes. Head small, the occipital
plates large elongate; the nasal plate triangular; one moderate
anterior, and two subequal posterior ocular shields; six upper
and lower labial shields, the fourth under the eyes; eyes small,
pupil round. There is an indistinct small yellow spot behind the
upper part of the eye; but this may be an accidental variety, as
the spots on the two sides are not equally defined.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>This species resembles Calamaria diadema, which is also found
in Western Australia, but it is larger, and the head is larger in
comparison with the body, and in this species it is the base of
scales, while in the later it is the outer margin, that is
dark.</p>

<p><b>15. Chelodina oblonga (Gray).</b></p>
</center>

<p>78. Elaps lewisii, Gray.</p>

<p>Olive green, submetallic; edge of the scales blackish; upper
lip, chin, and ventral plates greenish-white; head moderate,
elongate, depressed; head shields normal; hinder frontal and
front of superciliary shield expanded on the sides, and bent down
on the cheeks. Nostrils in the suture between the two small nasal
plates. Loreal plates small oblong; one small front and two
smaller posterior oculars. Temples shielded; labial plates
moderate; chin shields two pair; middle of the throat shielded,
sides scaly. Eyes large, pupil rounded; body elongate,
sub-cylindrical, moderately thick, covered with cross bands of
elongated narrow scales. The vertebral series broad, six-sided,
long; of the nape, small, like those on the sides; of the tail,
broader and more uniform; ventral plates distinctly keeled and
erect on the sides. Tail elongate, tapering, with two rows of
shields, keeled on the sides.</p>

<p>80. Hydrus.</p>

<p>Captain G. Grey informs me that these snakes coil themselves
upon the shore, living on the seaweed, and that they lay their
eggs on the shore. They are often found asleep upon the sea, when
they are easily caught, as they cannot sink without first
throwing themselves on the back, probably to empty their large
vesicular lungs.</p>

<p>83. Platemys macquaria.</p>

<p>This species was originally indicated by Cuvier, from a single
specimen brought from the Macquarie River by Messieurs Lesson and
Garnot. It has been doubted if it really is an inhabitant of that
country, and might not have been imported from South America,
whence all the other species of the genus come, and sold to the
French collectors for a native species.</p>

<p>84. Hydraspis australis, t. 6.</p>

<p>Body ovate, back dark olive, rather convex, rounded on the
middle of the sides, with a narrow reflexed edge, shelving behind
with a broad expanded margin; vertebral shields broad, six-sided,
last subtriangular; beneath rather convex, yellow, shelving on
the sides; the second marginal plate with an angular lobe
produced into the suture between the vertebral and first costal
plates; claws sharp, black; skin of head and limbs smooth.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia ?</p>

<p>The back covered with conferva.</p>

<p>85. Chelodina longicollis.</p>

<p>Mr. Gould brought two large specimens of this species, which
are much more ovate and convex than Dr. Shaw's specimens. They
are 7 inches long by 6 wide. It may be a particular variety, or
they may become more ovate as they increase in size, The sternal
shields (in specimens preserved in brine) are pale yellow, with
black edges.</p>

<p>86. Chelodina oblonga, t. 7.</p>

<p>Shell oblong, rather contracted in front, with a broad
impression on the middle of the back; back olive brown, with
irregular anastomosing lines on the shields; beneath
reddish-yellow. The marginal plates longer than broad, the second
larger than the first and third; and rather angularly produced in
the middle of the inner edge, opposite the suture between the
first dorsal and first costal plate; the sternum high, flat,
strongly and sharply keeled on the sides.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>This species is at once known from Chelodina longicollis by
the form of its high, flat sternum, which is strongly keeled on
the sides, and by this part being of a uniform reddish colour,
without any dark margin to the plates; the hinder part of the
sternum is only slightly concavely truncated, and not deeply
notched.</p>

<p>It is also known from that old well-known species by its
oblong depressed form, and by the form of the marginal plates,
and especially from the second and eleventh marginal plates on
each side being placed more forwards, so that the centre of their
inner edge is opposite the suture of the first and last costal
plates with the dorsal ones; instead of their front margin, as is
the case with all the specimens of Chelodina longicollis I have
seen.</p>

<p>This species grows to a large size. Mr. Gould brought a
specimen which he gave to Mr. Bell, which is 11 inches long, and
the neck is nearly equally long, very thick, and studded with
large warts; the head is broad and depressed, covered with a thin
skin, like a Trionyx, and marked with small thin scales.</p>

<p>92. Cystignathus dorsalis.</p>

<p>The palatine teeth in a single large straight line, just
behind the inner nostrils; tongue large, slightly nicked behind,
the tympanum nearly hid under the skin; gray-brown (in spirits)
marbled with dark irregular spots, with a white streak down the
middle of the forehead and front of the back; sides pure white,
spotted and marbled with black; beneath white; toes elongate,
slender, tapering; back part of thighs brown, white speckled.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia. Mr. Gould.</p>

<p>This species is very distinct from C. peronii and C.
georgianus, the two Australian species described by Messieurs
Dumeril and Bibron. It agrees with the former in the disposition
of the palatine teeth.</p>

<p>HELIOPORUS, Gray.</p>

<p>Head short, swollen; eyes large, convex; palatine teeth in a
straight interrupted ridge between the two internal nostrils;
teeth very small; body swollen; skin of the back minutely
granular, of the belly smooth; legs rather short; toes 4.5,
short, warty beneath, quite free; the hind wrist with a large,
oblong, compressed, internal tubercle; the base of the inner
finger with a conical wart, ending in a small acute bony process;
tongue large, entire behind.</p>

<p>This genus has many of the characters of Cystignathus, but
differs from it in being warty and swollen, and in having short
toes like a toad.</p>

<p>94. Helioporus albo punctatus, t. 1 f. 2.</p>

<p>Lead-coloured (in spirits) with white spots; beneath dirty
white, with some small white warts at the angle of the mouth;

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>103. Hyla Adelaidensis, Gray, t. 8 f. 2.</p>

<p>Slender; fore-toes quite free, hinder toes webbed to the last
joint; (in spirits) gray-blue, with a series of small oblong
tubercles; the sides purple-brown with a white streak from the
underside of the eyes to the shoulders; sides of the belly and
region of the vent purplish, with small white spots; the hinder
side of the thighs purple-brown, with three large oblong white
spots; belly and under side of thighs granular; chin white,
brownish dotted; palatine teeth in two roundish groups between
the internal nostrils.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>104. Hyla binoculata, Gray, t. 8, f. 1.</p>

<p>Slender; fore-toes quite free; hinder toes webbed to the last
joint. Grayish white (in spirits) with a series of very small,
indistinct, oblong tubercles, with a dark streak from the
nostrils to the shoulder, enclosing the eyes, and a white streak
below it from the underside of the eye; sides purplish, with
small white spots; back of the thighs purple, with two yellow
spots; belly and underside of thighs whitish, granular.</p>

<p>Var. 1. Back of thighs with one or two additional yellow
spots.</p>

<p>Var. 2. Back bluish gray; back of the thighs with six or seven
small subequal yellow spots.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>UPEROLEIA, Gray.</p>

<p>Head large; palate quite toothless; upper jaw with small close
teeth; tympanum hid under the skin; toes of the fore and hind
feet elongate, slender, quite free; ankle with a roundish
external and a small conical inner tubercle; tongue small,
oblong, roundish, and entire behind.</p>

<p>This genus is most nearly allied to Leiuperus of Messieurs
Dumeril and Bibron, with which it agrees in having no teeth on
the palate, but it differs from it in the tympanum being quite
hid.</p>

<p>The internal nostrils are some distance in front of the
cross-ridge on which the palatine teeth are generally placed.</p>

<p>105. Uperoleia marmorata.</p>

<p>Black and green marbled, leaving a triangular greenish spot on
the forehead, beneath lead colour.</p>

<p>Inhabits Western Australia.</p>

<p>Dr. Tschudi has formed a genus under the name of Crinia, which
appears by his characters to be nearly related to the above; but
Messieurs Dumeril and Bibron (Erp. Gen. 8 416) observe that the
specimens he described have two very small groups of teeth on the
vomer.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX F.</h3>

<p>Notes on some Insects from King George's Sound, collected and
presented to the British Museum by CAPTAIN GEORGE GREY, by ADAM
WHITE, Esquire, British Museum, in a letter addressed to the
author.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>Fabricius was the first, or among the earliest, Entomologists
who described the Annulose animals of New Holland, New Zealand,
and the Pacific Islands. At the time he published his Systema
Entomologiae (1775) these parts of the world had been visited by
but few persons, and I believe that all the species he described
as coming from them he found in the collection which was made by
Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander on their well-known voyage with
Captain Cook; that collection was presented to the Linnean
Society of London. Several of the original specimens have been
figured in the works of Olivier and Donovan, and it is perhaps
unnecessary to say that modern Entomologists often refer to these
specimens as the typical examples. As far as I am aware the next
important addition to the Entomology of New Holland was made by
Dr. Schreibers of Vienna,* which was followed by that of Mr.
Marsham.** All the specimens described by these entomologists
were most probably collected by travellers touching only at
certain points on the coast.</p>

Tr. L.S. This contains 20 species, some of which however had been
previously described by Olivier under Paropsis, the appellation
now universally applied to this "convex-backed" genus. The
Reverend William Kirby in a note added the more latent
characters.)</blockquote>

<p>As New Holland became colonized and settlements increased
Entomology was not altogether neglected, for we find a resident,
John W. Lewin, A.L.S., of Paramatta, New South Wales, in 1805,
publishing an elegant and curious quarto volume of plates in
which he describes many species of crepuscular and nocturnal
Lepidoptera, in most cases figuring the insects in all their
stages; it is highly to be regretted that this interesting work
was not continued, and it is to be feared that want of
encouragement alone prevented the industrious and acute author
from persevering in the design of his work, which the title he
gave it* shows he intended to have made of a general nature on
the subject. The accounts of the habits of Cryptophasa and
Agarista are peculiarly interesting, and it is much to be wished
that some of the many entomologists now in New Holland and the
islands of the Pacific Ocean would publish similar notes (however
short) on the habits, etc., of the insects they may find.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Prodromus, etc., Natural History of
Lepidopterous Insects of New South Wales, collected, engraved,
and faithfully painted after nature by J.W.L. etc. London 1805

<p>Dr. Robert Brown, when on Flinders' voyage, collected many
interesting insects which were described by Kirby in the 12th
volume of the Linnean Transactions.* Several specimens were
deposited by this celebrated botanist in the British Museum. We
find Dr. Leach commencing the description of New Holland insects
in his Zoological Miscellany; and Macleay in his Horae
Entomologicae described many curious Lamellicornes. Since that
time the communication with the great South Continent has been so
uninterrupted that collections have been continually coming to
Europe, and scarcely a ship now arrives without some additions
being made to this branch of science.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Volume 12 1818 pages 454 to 478. A

Holland by Robert Brown, Esquire, F.R.S. etc., by the Reverend W.
Kirby, M.A., F.R.S. etc. 33 species described, 13 figured on tab.
23. Mr. Kirby, in his century of Insects published in the same
volume, described 17 New Holland species, and in the same
celebrated paper founded four new genera upon Australasian
Insects, Adelium, Rhinotia, Eurhinus and Rhinaria. He would have
described other genera but for his fear of interfering with
Germar's labours on the Curculionidae. N.B. Strongylium
chalconotum is from Brazil and not from Australasia as
indicated.)</blockquote>

<p>The French voyages of discovery under Freycinet,* Duperrey,
D'Urville, and Laplace have contributed very much to extend our
knowledge of the Natural History of the Southern islands, as the
publication of the History of the Voyages of the Uranie,
Coquille, Astrolabe, and Favorite, amply testify; we are more
especially indebted to Admiral D'Urville, who seems to unite the
seemingly incompatible duties of commander of an expedition with
an enthusiastic love of and search after insects. M.
Guerin-Meneville published the Annulose animals of the Voyage de
la Coquille, in which New Holland genera and species take a
prominent place. Dr. Boisduval described those collected on the
expedition of the Astrolabe, he also published the first Fauna
Entomologica of New Holland and the Pacific; in his two volumes
he gives a synoptical description of all the species he met with
in the Parisian collections, indicating also such as he found in
books whether he had seen the specimens or not. More detailed
descriptions are looked for on some future occasion by the
entomologists of this country from the learned and talented
author of so many well-known works.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Voyage autour du monde etc. sur les
corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne 1817 a 1820 Paris
1824 Partie Zoologie. Freycinet's Voyage, but for the lamentable
shipwreck of one of his vessels, would have added much to our
acquaintance with the Natural History of the places visited.
Messrs. Quoy and Gaymard, Medecins de l'expedition, published the
Zoological part of their notes. They refer with regret to the
disastrous accident which deprived them of large collections of
Insects made more particularly in the environs of Port Jackson.
They describe and figure but one insect from New Holland
(Curculio lemniscatus from Shark Bay) a spider from Port Jackson
(Aranea notacautha Quoy, Dolophones notacantha Walckenaer Apt. 1
383) in which the brown callosities at the end of the cylindrical
abdomen were taken for eyes, a position rectified by Walckenaer
as above and by Kirby in his Bridgewater Treatise where he gives
a copy of the French figure of this singular spider--Two
Crustacea, one (Ocypode convexus) from Dirk Hatterick's and the
other (Pagurus clibanarius) from Shark Bay, are all the Annulose
animals described or figured as coming from New Holland, from the
pitiable circumstance above alluded to.)</blockquote>

<p>The figures and descriptions of Guerin, though fewer in
number, are more detailed than those of Dr. Boisduval, who was
much limited for space.</p>

<p>It would take up too much time to give a tithe of the names of
the entomologists who have described New Holland insects* as
nearly every working student of insects abroad and at home has
added to the list.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The entomologist who would attempt to do
this must give a Universal Entomological Bibliography, as
scarcely a Journal or volume of Transactions of any Scientific
Society appears without containing fewer or more species from the
great Australasian Continent and its islands.)</blockquote>

<p>Messieurs Audouin, Blanchard, and Boisduval will shortly
publish descriptions of the insects etc. collected on D'Urville's
last voyage. Latreille, Dejean, Schoenherr, and Klug must be
specially particularized; Gory, Percheron, Chevrolat, Aube,
Serville, Reiche, Spinola, Fischer, and Mannerheim have all more
or less added to our acquaintance with the species. Many New
Holland Arachnida and Pacific Ocean Crustacea have been described
in the well-known works of the Baron Walckenaer and Dr. Milne
Edwards. In this country Kirby, Hope, Curtis, G.R. Gray,
Waterhouse, Shuckard, Newman, and Westwood have been the
principal scientific men who have attended to species of
annulosa. Bennett, Mr. Surgeon Hunter, Darwin and Major Mitchell,
when opportunities offered, collected many species and neglected
not the subject of their habits; the last-mentioned having also
described (specifically) one or two species in his interesting
work. Macleay's Appendix to Captain King's voyage* is universally
known.</p>

nodulosa. Carpophagus type C. Banksiae "would probably with
Linnaeus have been a Bruchus." Megamerus "has an affinity to
Sagra, but differs from that genus in having setiform antennae,
porrect mandibles, and securiform palpi, its habit is also
totally different, and more like that of some of those insects
which belong to the heterogeneous magazine called Prionus; it is
undoubtedly the most singular and novel form in Captain King's
collection." Type M. kingii.)</blockquote>

<p>Curtis and Haliday have published and are engaged in
publishing the description of Annulosa collected by Captain King,
while those collected by Mr. Darwin on the voyage of the Beagle
have been entrusted to Mr. Waterhouse, who has published
descriptions of some in the Entomological Society's Transactions
and in the Annals of Natural History. Hope's papers in the
Zoological Transactions and the Coleopterist's Manual are well
known, as are Mr. Newman's in different Magazines and Annals. We
rejoice to see in a late number of a small periodical sheet
exclusively devoted to Entomology* and edited by this gentleman a
letter from Mr. Davis, containing some interesting information
regarding the insects of Adelaide; and in the same periodical
there are many New Holland insects described. Much may be
expected from Messrs. Macleay and Swainson, both at present in
the South Sea islands, and it is to be hoped that in a short time
the fruits of their researches will be before the public. Mr.
Gould collected many insects on his Ornithological expedition to
New Holland, descriptions of which, from the pen of the Reverend
F.W. Hope, may shortly be looked for.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. The Entomologist, conducted by Edward
Newman. London Van Voorst in Monthly Numbers.)</blockquote>

<p>The north-west coast of New Holland has been but little
investigated, and yet in that quarter the late Allan Cunningham
gathered a rich harvest of rare and unknown species; but it would
take too much space to tell what parts have not been searched for
insects, suffice it to say that the Swan River settlement,
Kangaroo and Melville islands, Adelaide, Sydney, and Hobart Town
seem all peculiarly rich in species, and what may we not expect
from New Zealand, from the samples already given of its
entomology by Fabricius and Shuckard, not to mention others who
have described species from that locality.</p>

<p>We yet hope to see a general work on the subject similar to
the truly national work on the Birds and Kangaroos at present
publishing by Mr. Gould. Mr. G.R. Gray commenced such a work in
quarto, and the beautiful number illustrated by the late Charles
Curtis, containing species of Phasmidae, it is to be hoped will
not be left single.* I have only room to add that, owing to many
other occupations, I can at present give only a very imperfect
list of the species you have presented to the National Museum,
which were all collected by you on the shores of King George's
Sound. A.W.</p>

<p>COLEOPTERA.</p>

<p>CARENUM, Bon. Carenum perplexum.</p>

<p>I think this may be the Scarites cyaneus Fabricius described
from the Banksian Cabinet in 1775 (Systema Entomologiae page 249
g. 68 sp. 2.) It differs however from his description in the
appendiculated thorax (the sides of which are rounded) being
abruptly cut off behind, and in having the somewhat dilated
margin there, slightly emarginate. The general surface of the
thorax is not so bright in colour as the elytra, it has more of a
purple reflection; a dark greenish hue prevails over the elytra,
the anterior edge of each having, towards the margin, a slight
bend upwards, which forms a kind of tooth, projecting slightly
over the somewhat dilated margin of the elytra, along the margin
of these are at least eight points, at first seemingly impressed,
but when more particularly examined they appear to be raised and
to have an impressed line round each of them. The head is black,
the antennae and palpi piceous, the third joint in the former is
longer than the second or third, the terminal joints are (more
especially) furnished with pitchy hairs. Long. lin. 8.</p>

<p>Habitat King George's Sound. Captain George Grey.</p>

<p>The genus Carenum was founded by Fr. A. Bonelli in the second
part of his Observations Entomologiques, read the 3rd May 1813
and published in the Turin Transactions for 1813,* upon a
specimen contained in the Paris Museum of Natural History, which
he regarded as the Scarites cyaneus of Fabricius figured by
Olivier.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Memoires de l'Academie Imp. des Sciences
etc. page 479.)</blockquote>

<p>Guerin* has shown that the Arnidius marginatus Leach of the
letter-press to the Voyage de l'Astrolabe, page 33, is synonymous
with Carenum cyaneum of Bonelli, as he has seen the two
specimens, the former of which is in Dupont's collection.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Crust. Arachn. et Ins. of the voyage of
the Coquille avant-propos page 7.)</blockquote>

<p>M. Brulle* observes well that the Carenum cyaneum of Bonelli
must be different from the Scarites cyaneus of Fabricius, as both
these authors speak of its being blue (or deep blackish green)
over the whole upper surface, while in the C. cyaneum the blue is
confined to the margin of the elytra; besides Olivier expressly
states that the Scarites cyaneus is smaller than the Scarites
subterraneus, which will not at all suit the original specimen
from which the learned Bonelli derived his generic character. In
the British Museum is the original specimen of Arnidius
marginatus (catalogued by Dr. Leach) presented by J. Huey,
Esquire, and it is very different both in size and in colour from
the descriptions of Fabricius and Olivier, and the figure of the
latter,** all derived from the original specimen formerly
contained in the Banksian collection. Dr. Boisduval's concise
description (op. cit. page 2, page 23) answers the specimen so
named by Leach.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Histoire Naturelle des Ins. par Messieurs
Audouin and Brulle 5 page 64.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(**Footnote. Coleopt. 3 Number 36 l. 2 f.
17.)</blockquote>

<p>If the figure of Carenum cyaneum, given by Audonin and Brulle
in their Work (tome 5 plate 2 f. 6) be correctly drawn, it
differs very considerably from Leach's specimens of Arnidius,
which is a broader insect.</p>

<p>I have not been able to see the original specimen of the
Scarites cyaneus, so that in all probability it has been
destroyed; it is much to be desired that accurate figures and
descriptions were made and published of the original specimens
described by Linnaeus and Fabricius, which exist in the Banksian
and Smithian Cabinets in the possession of the Linnean Society,
as well as those to be found in the Hunterian and British
Museums. The genus Eutoma of Newman* seems to me to be synonymous
with Carenum, but different from Arnidius of Leach.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Entomological Magazine 5 page 170 Eu.

<p>CHLAENIUS, Bon.</p>

<p>Chlaenius greyianus, new species.</p>

<p>C. supra laete viridi-smaragdinus, elytris costis tribus,
suturaque elevatis cupreis, laevibus, interstitiis laevibus;
margine utraque linea punctorum impressorum instructa; subtus
piceo-niger, antennis pedibusque piceo-nigris.</p>

<p>I have named this beautiful species after the Governor of
South Australia; in the system it would come close to the
European Chlaenius quadrisulcatus, Illiger. (Dejean and Boisduval
Iconogr. et Histoire Naturelle des Coleopt. d'Europe 2 page 185
plate 94 f. 3) which it seems singularly to represent.</p>

<p>It is however rather a larger insect, and of a brighter green
above than any specimens of the other species which I have seen,
there is less of the coppery tinge about its upper surface. The
thorax is much narrower, the lateral margins can hardly be called
depressed, and they are not at all longitudinally scooped out
there, as they are in the C. quadrisulcatus. The elytra are very
distinctly sinuated towards the extremity, and the three elevated
ribs are smooth and of a coppery bronze colour, with the
intervening spaces smooth (at least not granulated as in the C.
quadrisulcatus) and have two longitudinal lines of impressed
points, one on each side of the smooth interval.</p>

<p>This short description may suffice to distinguish this
beautiful species.</p>

<p>Habitat Australia (King George's Sound) Captain George Grey,

<p>The specimens brought home by Captain Grey seem to me
identical with the above. Fabricius describes the thorax
(truncated in front and rounded behind) as having the anterior
margin rufous in the middle, it being wholly of a deep shining
black, and as Olivier (l.c.) remarks, the neck or narrowed collar
(qui joint la tete au corcelet) is rufous yellow as is the
squareish transverse head with a black spot on the crown. The
scutellum and elytra are minutely punctured or chagrined, and
hairy (except a small smooth oblong space on the shoulder of the
latter) and are black with a violet tinge; in one specimen the
elytra have scarcely any of the blue tinge, and the spot on the
shoulder is of a ferruginous hue; the wings are violaceous. Dr.
Leach had regarded this as a distinct subgenus, but as the name
he had given it is pre-occupied in Botany, and has not been
published with or without characters, as far as I am aware, I
have not given it.</p>

<p>CRYPTODUS, Macleay.</p>

<p>C. variolosus, Burmeister (Westwood Monograph ined.)</p>

<p>Smaller than Mr. Macleay's species and of a pitchy brown, it
is less depressed; the head is squarer and not so broad, the two
tubercles are more prominent, the mentum is deeply emarginate:
antennae nine-jointed; basal joint dilated, prothorax not so
transverse, much more closely punctured: the elytra are scarcely
dilated behind, shorter, and are covered with exceeding minute
punctures in addition to the larger ones.</p>

<p>Inhabits King George's Sound, Captain George Grey. (British
Museum.)</p>

<p>Mr. Westwood informed me that Professor Burmeister had sent
him a description of this species under the above-mentioned name;
the characters are the principal of those which will appear in
Mr. Westwood's elaborate memoir. I had written a description of
this species and assigned a name to it, which however I withdraw.
There are more than two species of this curious genus, first
published in the Horae Entomologicae.</p>

<p>Yellowish metallic green, legs darker. The head is somewhat
square, the transverse suture being rather indistinct; the margin
of the clypeus is distinctly reflexed. Antennae dark brown,
ten-jointed; 1st joint longest, thickened at the end, with
ferruginous hairs behind; 2nd rounded, thin; 3rd, 4th, and 5th,
with the separating lines very indistinct, those before the 3
lamellated joints short, transverse. Maxillary palpi with the
terminal joint dilated, rather blunt at the tip, depressed above,
and hollowed out at its base. Legs rather thick, the outer of the
two tarsal claws of the third pair of legs, cleft at the end,
anterior tibiae externally sub-tridentate. Thorax with the sides
somewhat angulated and narrowly margined, rounded behind, but the
sides of the posterior margin are straight, the surface is
minutely punctured and covered with brown hairs, the sternum of
the mesothorax is without a spine, or projecting angle; elytra in
some specimens of a rich, lively, metallic, yellowish green, in
other coppery green with the suture and margin dark green, the
surface chagreened and punctured. Underside of the body and legs
dark green, the former covered with ash-grey pubescence, or
rather longish soft hairs.</p>

<p>This insect seems to be one of those links which connect such
genera as Anoplognathus, Amblyterus and Brachysternus, and it is
very difficult to say to which of these genera it is most allied.
Professor Burmeister has begun to eradicate the Phyllophagous
genera of Beetles, and from his deep knowledge of Entomology, and
the particular acquaintance which he has with the principles of
general Zoology, as well as the thorough manner in which he means
to go through all the species, much light may soon be expected to
be thrown on the subject; how true is Darwin's remark, made in
speaking of a somewhat anomalous bird, "this, from its varied
relations, although at present offering only difficulties to the
systematic Naturalist, ultimately may assist in revealing the
grand scheme, common to the present and past ages, on which
organized beings have been created." (Journal and Remarks Voyage
of Beagle 3 page 112.)</p>

<p>BIPHYLLOCERA, g.n.</p>

<p>Antennae (seemingly) nine-jointed, the first joint long, much
thickened at the end, and furnished with several stiff hairs, the
five last are lamelliform, the lamellae in the male long, and
pinnated on one side; labium deeply grooved in the middle,
notched at the tip; palpi with the terminal joints longest,
sub-cylindrical; head moderate; clypeus separated by a distinct
line, basal part slightly hollowed out, as is the head between
the eyes; thorax short; elytra elongate, somewhat rounded on the
lateral edge, truncated at the end; legs slender; tibiae of first
pair anteriorly sub-tridentate, tibiae of second and third pairs
with many spines, claws of posterior tarsi entire, joints of
tarsi, slender, elongate.</p>

<p>In the system this would come at no great distance from the
genus Serica, the compound lamellated joints are, I believe, the
first noticed amongst Phyllophagous Coleoptera.</p>

<p>Shining, more especially on the head and clypeus, the crown of
the head very smooth, the space between the eyes with impressed
punctures, the clypeus slightly notched in front; antennae
pale-ferruginous; thorax with short rust-coloured hairs, and the
lateral margin slightly reflexed and paler than the dorsal part,
which is covered with short striolae, giving a squamulate
appearance to it; when narrowly examined, just above the rather
large and bluntish scutellum, there are some distinct scattered
punctures; thorax beneath covered with fulvous hairs.</p>

<p>There are two more or less injured specimens of this species
in the collection of the British Museum. In the same collection,
from the same locality, are two specimens of what I regarded as
the females of the B. kirbyana; they are larger and of a pale
brown; one of these is figured in the accompanying wood-cut
figure 2. In the lamellae of the antennae of the two specimens
there is considerable difference, so that probably there may be a
second species of Biphyllocera. I have given it the name of B.
fabriciana.</p>

and wide margin of elytra flat, the extreme edge somewhat turned
up, the sides of the elytra at base are somewhat straight, but
the edge soon gradually gets rounded off towards tip. Towards the
suture the elytron is raised so as to form a very prominent keel
down the back of elytra; the general surface of the elytra is
somewhat pustulose, and there are three slightly elevated,
longitudinal lines, nearly meeting (but indistinctly) behind on

on the back on each side of a longitudinal, elevated dorsal
line.</p>

<p>"It is found in the Xanthorrhoea. The grubs are white, have a
fragrant aromatic flavour, and form a favourite article of food
amongst the natives. They are eaten either raw or roasted, and
frequently form a sort of dessert after native repasts. The
presence of these grubs in a grass-tree is thus ascertained. If
the top of one of these trees is observed to be dead, the natives
give it a few sharp kicks with their feet, when, if it contains
any Barde, it begins to give way; if this takes place, they push
it over, and breaking the tree in pieces with their hammers,
extract the Barde." Captain Grey's manuscript.</p>

<p>This species belongs to Serville's second division, or may
possibly form a third, as in the males there exist rudiments of
wings. Each of the elytra has a clear space like a tympanum; the
upper part of the prothorax is smooth, the sides and posterior
part are very slightly bent back, the last segment of abdomen
notched at the end.</p>

<p>ONCORHINUS, Shuckard.</p>

<p>[Family Thynnidae Shuckard.]</p>

<p>My reasons for establishing the family Thynnidae I shall
expose in my monograph of that family, which would have been
published ere this but for the difficulty of procuring specimens
for dissection; and as I must for a similar reason defer the
positive character until I publish the synopsis of the whole, I
will give those negative ones which are comprised in the
differences which distinguish it from Scotaena of Klug, and from
which it may be separated by its much swollen and protuberant
clypeus, being considerably less emarginate. Genae scarcely
conspicuous. Antennae longer and more porrect; second submarginal
cell as long as the third; abdomen broader at the base, its
ventral surface concave; hypopygium scarcely carinated laterally,
and pygidium prominent and deeply emarginate, its lateral edges
produced into acute teeth. External differences apparently so
small, and which might elsewhere be deemed inadequate to the
establishment of genera, become important in this remarkable
family, from their being confirmed by the structure of the
trophi, and the strong distinctions exhibited in their females in
every instance that has yet presented itself to me, wherever I
have had the certainty of specific identity in these heterogynous
insects, from the direct observation of my friends in
Australia.</p>

<p>Oncorhinus xanthospilos, Shuckard.</p>

spot on each side of each segment of the abdomen, except the
terminal one--apex of the femora, the tibiae and tarsi, all
yellow; the posterior tibiae being only brown within, and the
extreme apex of the joints of their tarsi also brown.</p>

<p>Habitat King George's Sound. Length 11 lines, expansion of the

<p>It may perhaps be not altogether foreign to the purpose of
this list to say that in the collection of the British Museum
there are two specimens of this species from the North-west coast
of New Holland, where they were collected by the late Mr. Allan
Cunningham. The whole of his collection was bought by Mr.
Children, and many of the rare Lepidoptera in it were named by
Mr. G.R. Gray. Godart's description of the body agrees exactly
with the male in the national collection, les cotes et le bout de
l'abdomen d'un rouge-carmin tendre. Boisduval, in the standard
work above alluded to, says of this species, dessous et extremite
de l'abdomen d'un rouge carmin. FEMELLE SEMBLABLE AU MALE, sur
quatre individus que nous possedons, AUCUN NE VARIE. In one of
the Museum specimens (a female) the abdomen is nearly entirely
black, and the brown in both specimens is of the same rich deep
shade that is found in the Papilio polydorus. The abdomen may
possibly be that of some other species, as the specimen is not in
very good condition. I regard the specimens from the north-west
coast of New Holland as a slight local variety. Godart's
specimens came from the East Indies and Boisduval's from Timor. I
find that Monsieur W. de Haan, in the splendid work published at
Leyden on the Natural History of the Dutch colonies in the East
and West Indies, etc. has described and figured "the female" of
this species with the following note; his specimens were from
Timor-Kupang. On the lower side of both wings there is a carmine
anal spot placed at the end of the yellow band and gradually
running into it, this spot is larger and more deeply coloured in
the male than in the female; in the former it shows itself on the
upper side, along the inner edge, as a small streak which is not
visible in the latter (l.c. page 40). I may add that his figure
of the abdomen is red, and the specimens are larger than those in
the Museum (Bijdragen tot de Kennis der Papilionidea, in the
Verhandel. over de Natuurl. Geschied etc. Zool. No 3 tab. 4 f. 3

<p>Above, brownish black; upper wings varied with bluish grey
scales, many near the outer margin arranged into a somewhat
regular series; a transverse, slightly bent, white band runs from
near the outer edge close to the tip, to near the middle of the
wing; wings fringed with greyish and black; under wings brownish
black, with fulvescent orange spots and a band, one small spot
somewhat transverse, near the middle, beneath this a broadish
band extends from the anal margin nearly to the outer side of
wing, which is divided by a brown line, leaving an irregular
squareish spot, attenuated towards the outer margin; on the
margin are three differently-shaped dots beginning from the
internal margin, and in one of the specimens are four slight
lunules, growing fainter as they approach the outer margin.
Beneath, upper wings with two transverse fulvescent orange bands,
one near the centre, the other at the tip, broadest externally,
with three black spots, the outer largest running into it near
the margin, interiorly it is much contracted ending in spots; the
base of the wings is yellowish grey, under wings yellowish grey
at base, otherwise very similarly marked, the outer part of the
orange band having two longitudinal whitish lines on it; antennae
at base fringed with white; club brown. Body above silky
yellowish brown; borders of segments lighter; beneath, greyish
white.</p>

<p>Female alis longioribus, maculis albis triseriatis alarum

<p>The genus Hecatesia was founded by Boisduval in 1829,* upon a
singular Zygenidous insect sent to Latreille by Mr. Alexander
Macleay, from New Holland, in some part of which it does not seem
to be uncommon.</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Essai sur une Monographie des Zygenides
page 11.)</blockquote>

<p>The species H. fenestrata Boisduval (l.c. page 11 plate 1 f.
2) was brought by Mr. Hunter, Surgeon of Captain King's
expedition, and by him presented to the British Museum. Another
species has been described by the Baron Feisthamel in the voyage
of the Favorite (page 19 plate 5 f. 1) under the name of H.
thyridion.* Of this species there are specimens in the collection
presented to the British Museum, and I take the present
opportunity of describing the female of this species, only
remarking that it wants the fenestrated clear space in the upper
wing.**</p>

<blockquote>(*Footnote. Lepidopteres nouveau, etc. Supplement a
la Zoologie du voyage autour du monde de la Favorite sous le
commandement de M. Laplace capitaine de Fregate.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(**Footnote. At first, from the body being so much
more slender than in the fenestrated specimens, I thought it
might be the male but, on showing the specimen to Mr. Edward
Doubleday, he pronounced it a female.</blockquote>

<p>The H. thyridion is distinguished from the H. fenestrata by
its larger size, and a third yellowish white interrupted band
close to the base of the first pair of wings; the fenestrated
spot is narrower, more lunated, and is much smaller in proportion
than in the corresponding part in Dr. Boisduval's species. The
body beneath is girded with four yellowish white and black bands,
the black bands are continuous on the sides, while the white pass
on the sides into the deep ochry-yellow of the upper side; the
abdomen has a single row of black spots (at least seven) down the
middle, one at the base of each segment, the two nearest the
thorax have a whitish spot behind them.</p>

<p>The female of this species brought by Captain Grey has the
upper wings more developed; the three interrupted whitish bands
are composed, at least the two outer, of three spots, larger than
in the female; the little bluish white spots on the deep brown
part of the under side of the lower wing are also nearly
obsolete; the sides of the body are not fringed as in the male;
and the apical tuft is very small indeed.</p>

<p>The most marked character however is the want of the
fenestrated diaphanous spot in the upper wing, which being a most
prominent characteristic in the examples of this species already
recorded, makes it highly probable that they have all been
females, and that this is the first time that the male has been
alluded to.</p>

<p>The beautifully striated and waved surface of the glassy spot,
taken in connection with the fact of the noise made by the
insects possessing it, would seem to indicate that the
fenestrated spot must act as a tympanum.</p>

<p>Cossodes lyonetii, new species. Illustration 26 Insects 9.</p>

<p>Wings black, with violet, purple, and green reflections; upper
with a longitudinal line, broken by the black of the wing near
the base, the other part extending to the tip of the wing,
sinuated anteriorly, and elbowed posteriorly; near the posterior
margin are two irregular white spots, the upper sub-triangular,
the under squareish; on the apical margin are seven whiteish
spots, the first very minute, the second largest, the others
gradually diminishing towards the long white line where they
terminate. The fringe is black, slightly greyish on the edge; the
underside of the wing is greyish at the base, and on the inner
edge, then violet, the apical portion being of a silky yellowish
brown; the lower wings are purplish violet, the outer margin at
the base is whitish, the fringe is black at the base, at the end
white--the white forming a broader line than the black; beneath
it is violet black, and black with a greenish tinge. The thorax
and body in the specimen described is rubbed; the latter seems to
be blackish green, banded with white. I have seen a species
closely resembling the above in Dr. Boisduval's immense
collection.</p>

upper surface of first pair of wings fawn, with a reddish hue,
densely covered with hair-like scales, with shorter and somewhat
square scales beneath, the scales over the nervures, being
reddish; an indistinct line of seven obscure spots still more
indistinctly connected by a zigzag reddish line, runs across the
wing nearly parallel to its apical margin, and nearer the tip of
the wing than the middle. (In one of the two specimens this band
of spots is obsolete, or nearly so, as are the reddish coloured
nervures.) Second pair of wings of a blush red, the fringe fawn
coloured; underside of both wings, more of a brick colour than
the upper surface of second pair; the fringes fawn coloured; the
second pair with a very indistinct band, nearly parallel to the
posterior margin; the nerves on the first pair of wings are

<p>Antennae destroyed. Triangular tuft between the eyes, reddish
ochre, the sides brown; hairs on thorax white, with a yellowish
tinge. The upper wings have their general surface white, the
margin at the base being ochrey-orange; there are two black
parallel bands suffused towards the outer margin, and in this way
connected; a third somewhat diagonal band is in this manner also
connected with the second; near the margin there is also a
connection between the second and third bands by means of a
brownish band interspersed with white scales, and in this are two
subocellated spots, white, with an ochrey-orange roundish pupil;
the second just in front of the third band white in front, and
ochrey-orange behind; behind the third black band there comes a
narrow band of white scales, with an ochrey-orange spot at the
end near the outer margin. The tip of the wing is (broadly)
velvety brown, with eight marginal whitish spots; the fringe is
mixed with black and ochrey; the ochrey tingeing the posterior
margin of some of the outer spots.</p>

<p>The under wings are velvety brown; the base being obscurely
ochrey; the yellowish colour running up into brown; the fringe
behind is ochrey.</p>

<p>The under wings are ochrey at the base; the outer margin of

black hair; beneath there is a somewhat indistinct longitudinal
brownish band down the middle.</p>

<p>The hairs on the end of the body are longish, and not in a

<p>Since the figure of this was drawn from one of the two rather
injured specimens presented by Captain Grey, I have seen another
specimen in finer condition, from which I shall take the more
particular description of the bands on the upper wing.</p>

<p>The head and thorax are covered with long and close hairs; the
tuft between the eyes being of a brownish ochrey colour; the
sides blackish. The hairs on the fore-part of the thorax are
ochrey-brownish, gradually passing into white on its general
surface, which however has more or less of a yellowish tinge.</p>

<p>The upper wings are white and covered with longish loose
scales. Near the base is a narrowish transverse dark brown band,
with another considerably before the middle of the wing running
parallel to it; behind the middle there is a third band, the
inner extremity being at the same distance from the second band
as the second is from the first; but it gradually slopes away
towards the outer margin, and is thus nearly parallel to the
posterior margin, which has also a brown band, scolloped behind,
and with at least eight spots on the margin, which is of a
brownish yellow, as in the outer margin.</p>

<p>The under-wings, from the base to the middle, and (narrowly)
on the outer margin and behind, are brownish ochrey; the other
half of the wing is blackish brown, scolloped behind; and having
an indistinct ochrey band passing transverse through it, which
ochrey band has some darker-coloured scales mixed with it.</p>

<p>The undersides of both wings differ but little from the upper
sides; the upper pair more especially however have on the basal
and submarginal parts longish ochrey coloured hairs instead of
white scales.</p>

<p>The body above is, at the base, ochrey; the sides, and two or
three other segments brownish black, darkest just in front of the
large thick-set tuft of brownish orange hairs at the extremity;
beneath, down the middle, is a band of brownish orange, the
segments to the sides of this being black at the base and orange
at the tip; the legs are varied with black and ochrey white.</p>

<p>This seems congeneric with the Arcturus sparshalli of Mr.
Curtis, described in the 7th volume of the British Entomology,
folio 336, as a British insect; but there seems doubt of the
correctness of this. The name, having been pre-occupied in
Natural History, has been changed by Mr. Westwood to Trichetra,
in page 92 of the Generic Synopsis, appended to his Introduction
to the modern Classification of Insects.</p>

<p>The Bombyx tristis is figured (figure 2) on the same block
with the T. Nephthis.</p>

<p>Agagles amicus, new species.</p>

<p>A new species, at first sight resembling Leptosoma annulatum,
Boisduval (Voyage de l'Astrolabe 1 page 197 plate 5 figure 9) but
differs; the thorax having four longitudinal, narrow,
light-coloured lines, the band across the upper wings is more
continuous, and the circular spot on lower, larger. It is about
the same size, and has the body ringed with black and yellow; the
legs are brown; the femora on underside fringed with whitish
hairs, simply pectinated; many of the pectinations of the
antennae end in a bristle-like hair; palpi somewhat prominent;
last joint pointed.</p>
