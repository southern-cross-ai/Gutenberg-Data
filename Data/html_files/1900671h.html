<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>

A Wedding Is Announced.</h2>

<p class="first">ARTHUR WALSH hurried up the steps of Friars
Halt, across the big hall and along a passage to his father's
study. The footman looked after him in surprise. He had never
seen Mr. Arthur in a hurry before. Then he saw him pause before a
bowl of flowers as though enchanted by their beauty; and neither
had he ever seen him do that before. Arthur stood so long staring
at the delphinium spires that the footman had perforce to leave
him entranced. But Arthur was not spellbound. Once he cast a
glance at the study door that suggested an inexperienced lion
tamer about to enter the cage of his fiercest animal, and by no
means liking the prospect.</p>

<p>He was twenty-eight years old, fairly tall, and had a face
that began well in a good forehead, but ended in a weak chin.
Finally, after one more prolonged stare at the flowers, he opened
the door beside him and went on in. Colonel Walsh sat looking
into the fire, an open letter in his hand. He had a long thin
face with a tightly compressed mouth and steadfast grey eyes.
Taken together, eyes and mouth gave him a curiously daunting air.
Not to Colonel Walsh did people turn to ask the way. Not of him
would children inquire the time. He had never to suffer from the
club bore. One glance from him, and straggler, child or bore
passed on.</p>

<p>"Gerald is dead," Colonel Walsh said, turning to face his son.
His voice was deep and powerful.</p>

<p>For a second Arthur looked as though he could not place his
brother Gerald. "When did it happen?" he asked after a second.
"Poor old Gerald Where was it?"</p>

<p>"In Smyrna. Circus performance. The roof crashed in, and
Gerald was among the dead. His passport gave his name, and
Raeburn&mdash;who's consul there&mdash;identified the body."</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh spoke abruptly. Looking into Arthur's face, it
came to him with a sudden and quite unexpected wrench that
Gerald, the brilliant though unreliable, was dead, and that
Arthur, the dull one, alone remained to him. For he had but the
two sons.</p>

<p>"It seems only yesterday that he walked through that door
laughing and swinging his cap," Arthur said, drawing a deep
breath.</p>

<p>A spasm crossed his father's face.</p>

<p>"He lied to me," he said evenly, but with a suggestion in his
low tone of answering some accusation. "Lied He knew that is the
one thing I won't stand, yet he did it. You owned up. He lied!"
He drew a difficult breath as he added: "Gerald was given to
lying."</p>

<p>Arthur nodded. Gerald was. As a rule he had done it well, but
on the occasion in question his father had had inside knowledge,
and so Gerald had been turned adrift with his clothes and a
hundred pounds in money. That had been nearly three years ago.
And now Gerald was dead...Arthur looked almost curiously at his
father. The Colonel had clearly had a painful shock. One wouldn't
have thought he would have cared!</p>

<p>"I came in to tell you something, Pater," Arthur said
abruptly. "I'm afraid it's rather an inopportune moment..."</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh straightened up, looking inquiringly at him, his
formidable, narrow face as hawk-like as usual. "Well?"</p>

<p>His son looked at him with something harder in his eye than
one might have expected.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be married."</p>

<p>"And who is the lady?" Colonel Walsh leant forward sharply.
One would say that he guessed the name, or believed that he
did.</p>

<p>"You've never met her, I think. Her name is Violet Finch."</p>

<p>His father's face became blank. Colonel Walsh had felt certain
that now that Ann Lovelace was back in England, and unmarried,
Arthur would try his luck once again&mdash;and this time with
success. He had assumed that this would be the announcement. But
a Violet Finch...?</p>

<p>"And her people are?" inquired Colonel Walsh. "Nothing much,"
Arthur gave a little deprecatory smile. "Her father was a
barrister. He's dead. Her mother&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"She's not <i>the</i> Mrs. Finch surely?" the Colonel
interposed.</p>

<p>"I really can't possibly say whom you mean by that," was the
acid retort. "Violet's mother is lady who, left quite penniless,
started some night-clubs which for a time succeeded very well.
And therefore made her a lot of money&mdash;and enemies." Colonel
Walsh was grimly silent. So it was <i>the</i> Mrs. Finch! His
mouth was tighter lipped than usual. So tight that at a glance it
looked as though he had only one lip.</p>

<p>"You'll like Violet, Pater. She's as straight as&mdash;as you
are yourself. Outspoken&mdash;forthright&mdash;not at all a woman
of the world; but she has a vitality that I envy!" Arthur hurried
on.</p>

<p>"That's to the good," the Colonel commented. "Well, Arthur, I
won't pretend that I would not have been pleased if it had been
some one your aunt and I know, whose people we know; but any one
you love will receive the welcome due to my son's wife. When is
the wedding to be?"</p>

<p>"Next month. I don't want a long engagement, and Violet isn't
very happy at home. She's not in the least a <i>cabaret</i> girl,
sir. You don't need to be afraid of that."</p>

<p>"How did you come to meet her?" Colonel Walsh asked.</p>

<p>"At one of the Little Owls." Those were Mrs. Finch's famous
night-clubs. "She looked such a country girl, such a fish out of
water, that I wondered to see her there...I don't say I wasn't a
bit taken aback when I found out who she was&mdash;I didn't catch
her name when we were introduced but by that time I had talked to
her and&mdash;well, you can't explain these things, can you?" he
added with a deprecating laugh.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh agreed that you couldn't, then went into the
question of the increased income his son could expect at his
marriage. Colonel Walsh was a very wealthy man indeed.
Principally interested in tobacco, his range included many other
things as well. At the present moment Arthur was in his father's
head office and earned, or rather was paid, a salary of five
thousand a year. In addition to this he had his allowance of one
thousand. Quite a comfortable total, even in these days. He had
been in the Army, and at that time his father had considered a
thousand quite sufficient for his needs. Arthur had thought
otherwise, and there had finally come a night when the Colonel
faced him with a pile of bills before him and Arthur next morning
had sent in his papers. It was after that that he had entered his
father's office&mdash;and Gerald had gone abroad.</p>

<p>"I started some years ago," the Colonel went on, "a sort of
marriage fund for each of you two boys. Then when Gerald failed
me, and dropped out of the reckoning, the two funds were made
into one. It stands at fifty thousand now, and you shall have my
cheque for it as my wedding present."</p>

<p>"You're more than generous, Pater," Arthur said
gratefully.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh made a gesture. "I appreciate the way you've
kept nothing back about your future wife. If only Gerald had
realised that I'll overlook anything but deception, he would
probably be here alive to-day&mdash;not killed in an Asia Minor
circus."</p>

<p>Arthur nodded. He said nothing. Gerald had been "Gerald."
Handsome, debonair, careless of money, and of whether what he
said tallied with facts or not. The end had been inevitable, as
he had often warned Gerald that it must be.</p>

<p>When he was alone, the Colonel sat on his sad thoughts with
Gerald rather than with Arthur.</p>

<p>His sister, Lady Monkhouse, found him still there, staring
into the fire, his pipe practically out. She had not yet learnt
Arthur's news. Arthur had always been her favourite, but she
heard of his engagement with almost comic fury.</p>

<p>"<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i> to be caught by the daughter of that
dreadful woman!" She was inconsolable. "Oh, I saw her once; great
big, bouncing, noisy bold-eyed creature! If only Ann Lovelace had
taken him, when he was head over ears in love with her."</p>

<p>"In those days there was Gerald," Colonel Walsh said in a
level voice. "Arthur was the younger son&mdash;then."</p>

<p>Lady Monkhouse was shocked. Truths often had that effect on
her.</p>

<p>"Ann would have been a wonderful wife for Arthur," she went
on, "and he adored her..."</p>

<p>"At that time," finished the Colonel dryly. "Pity he couldn't
have taken a fancy to Kitty." Lady Monkhouse raised her nicely
plucked eyebrows. Kitty was the Colonel's niece, and lived with
them.</p>

<p>"Kitty," Lady Monkhouse said now. "Well, hardly! I think,
George, that Arthur is far too clever to be content with little
Kitty! Now Ann would be his intellectual equal, and socially, of
course&mdash;with her connections&mdash;she's the Duchess's
favourite niece&mdash;anything would have been possible...But
this Finch girl...! I can't believe it! I simply cannot!"</p>

<p>Arthur came in. "Talking about Violet?" he asked gaily.</p>

<p>His aunt looked sombrely back at him. "Don't expect me to
congratulate you," she said bitterly. "It would be a
mockery!"</p>

<p>Upon which there was a very fine family quarrel. Arthur,
usually very cautious in his words, raved about his aunt's
prejudices and Violet Finch's excellences, and his father took
his part. So did Kitty when she came in, lured, it must be
confessed, by curiosity at the loud tones of the talk. Kitty was
a pale-faced slip of a girl with big, brown eyes and an air of
youth and freshness and candour that far outweighed mere
prettiness in Colonel Walsh's opinion. He would have considered
Arthur a very lucky man indeed to have won Kitty. And he had
thought that Kitty's heart was turning a little to Arthur. Now he
hoped that he had been mistaken. He would not like to think her
young life hurt beneath his roof...</p>

<p>Arthur finally stalked away in a fine temper, leaving his aunt
looking rather ill-at-ease. She had spoken very hastily...she had
said some things anent Violet Finch and the family of Finch that
might well have been put differently; and some that were best not
put at all.</p>

<p>"I had no idea you knew so much about nightclubs," her brother
remarked dryly.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh had the masculine idea that family plain
speaking was his own prerogative, that as long as he did not
swear at things no one else should do so. He never could
understand why a king of Israel needed to get a prophet to curse
the people for him...That always seemed to him one of the few
things a man should do for himself, if done at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been to the Little Owls. A couple of years back
every one went. That Finch woman made a sinful amount of money
out of it. Simply incredible profits Thousands there every
night...They gambled for enormous stakes upstairs in her private
flat, it was whispered. Now I hear that the place is running down
as speedily as it shot up. And to think that Arthur&mdash;of all
young men! I thought <i>he,</i> at least, was sensible!"</p>

<p>Walsh winced. She was referring obliquely to Gerald, and
somehow&mdash;just now&mdash;it hurt.</p>

<p>"Look here, Kitty," Lady Monkhouse wound up. "You're going to
town for a week&mdash;to get your brother's flat ready for his
return. Do call on these Finches and give us your opinion of the
girl. I may be prejudiced, though I'm sure I'm not..."</p>

<p>Kitty raised no objection to this informal scrutiny of the
future Mrs. Arthur Walsh, agreeing to do so within the next few
days.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>

Violet Finch Wears Some Fine Pearls at a Dance.</h2>

<p class="first">THREE weeks later Mrs. Finch was giving a dance,
and apparently at the same time giving the lie to current rumours
of her being absolutely on the rocks. True, it was to celebrate
her daughter's engagement to Arthur Walsh, that wealthy catch,
but, even so, it was very lavish.</p>

<p>There was dancing in two splendid ballrooms, there was bridge
in half a dozen card-rooms, and there would be supper such as
only the Merveille Hotel could supply in its spacious supper-room. And there was also a Sicilian Marionette show which had
caught her guests' fancy.</p>

<p>Kitty Walsh had just been watching the marionettes. At first
with keen amusement; but suddenly they had become not funny at
all&mdash;instead, a sort of ghastly parody on life. They looked
so incredibly alive, their actions seemed too intelligent, and
yet they were only puppets that were dancing, and making love,
and even committing murders with such energy and dash. She shot a
glance at Ronald Mills beside her it had been his idea that in
lieu of another dance they should watch the Show for a while. He
caught her eye and followed her back into the ballroom.</p>

<p>"What do you think of them, Miss Walsh? Good, eh?"</p>

<p>Ronald Mills always spoke in a loud voice as though any one,
near or far, must be interested in his opinions, his questions,
his lightest utterance.</p>

<p>He was a long, thin man with a long, thin face, long, thin
lips, long, thin teeth, and a very cynical smile. Well turned
out, he always slouched, whether walking or sitting, and whenever
possible had a cigarette dangling from his lip.</p>

<p>In age he looked around thirty, but an extremely ripe thirty.
His voice was unexpectedly big and booming.</p>

<p>She did not reply. What <i>did</i> she think of them?</p>

<p>"You seen them, Walsh?" Mills called to her cousin, as the
latter passed them with his fiance.</p>

<p>They stopped at the question and came towards Kitty. Arthur's
blue eyes were twinkling like a mischievous schoolboy's below the
sandy eyebrows that seemed to begin indefinitely nowhere and end
vaguely nowhere&mdash;like his chin.</p>

<p>"Yes, funny show. Clever, and all that..."</p>

<p>"Did you like them?" Mills asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"I dunno. What did <i>you</i> think of them, Vi?"</p>

<p>"Lousy," came the instant answer, as Miss Finch surveyed
herself complacently over Arthur's shoulder in a wall-mirror.
Afterwards, Kitty thought that the two ropes of pearls around
Violet's throat should have been rubies, like drops of blood, so
singular and so sinister a part did they play in the tragedy that
followed. Violet Finch was handsome, in a heavy way. She had a
masterful eye, but she was looking her flamboyant best to-night.</p>

<p>"I didn't care much for them, either," echoed Arthur. And
Mills laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch came up. She had married a man called Gray, a year
ago, but she remained Mrs. Finch to every one but the registrar.
She was a little woman with deep-set eyes that were far too
bright and unwinking. She was very plain, and used no make-up.
Her dress was expensive enough, but carelessly put on. Her hands
were restless, always fingering things on herself or on anything
near her. She looked as though possessed of boundless
determination and driving power.</p>

<p>"I thought them positively frightening," she said, joining in
the talk, "actually sinister. I shouldn't like to be jerked about
by a string, would you, Artie?" She laughed at her own words, and
Mrs. Finch-Gray was more than plain, she was an ugly woman when
she laughed. Her sharp chin poked forward, her mouth looked loose
and frog-like.</p>

<p>Kitty was claimed for the dance and moved away. Arthur shook
his head vaguely. "Depends," he said cautiously.</p>

<p>"On what Vi thinks?" Mills asked with studied
carelessness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch&mdash;as people continued to call her&mdash;gave
him a sharply warning look that suggested anger. Mills was her
business partner.</p>

<p>"Naturally, any man's guided by what his fiance thinks," she
said smoothly.</p>

<p>"Guided like the marionettes?" Mills flashed back at her with
a suggestion of snapping his fingers at her vexation, as he
strode forward to a woman in purple and silver and eagerly asked
her to let him take her in to supper. This was Mrs. Yerkes, and
Mills hoped very much to marry Mrs. Yerkes.</p>

<p>Arthur wrinkled his forehead and looked after him, then at
Mrs. Finch.</p>

<p>"You two always sound to me as though you were sparring," he
murmured. "Well, Vi, I must let that tiresome Lady Brygitte
trample about on my toes for another round of the room." He moved
away. But Violet, too, stood looking after Mills.</p>

<p>"He's a bit too clever," she said darkly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And so sharp that he'll cut himself one of these
days," finished her mother. For the moment the two were alone in
a corner.</p>

<p>"You've got Arthur well broken in," Mrs. Finch murmured in a
tone of grudging praise&mdash;as to a pupil.</p>

<p>Violet tossed her head.</p>

<p>"And we don't need your cracking the whip all the time,
either!" she said ungratefully. "You and your marionettes! If it
had been any one but Arthur he might have turned nasty!"</p>

<p>"And that's the thanks I get, is it?" Mrs. Finch demanded in a
fierce whisper, as she thrust her face almost into her
daughter's.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think you could have brought it off by
yourself! It would be just like your conceit! No, no, my fine
lady! It's your mother who's put you where you are, and don't you
forget it!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't!" came from Violet, "and a nice fat sum of
money you managed to borrow on the strength of my engagement to a
rich man. Don't you suppose I know that?"</p>

<p>"And why not?" whispered her mother again. Then she fell
silent, a tired look coming over her face. "And not a penny of it
that I can stick to&mdash;yet," she went on. "These damned debts
I They're enough to break down a horse. Debts everywhere, and you
spending money like water. Who's to pay for that new car of
yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno," Violet said indifferently. "What about your new
Daimler?"</p>

<p>"I only 'bought' that for this dance!" Mrs. Finch spoke
meaningly and both women laughed outright. "I don't want dear
Artie to smell a rat, and know just how deeply in the soup we
really are, or would be, but for my having handled him just the
way I did. The Daimler will be taken back to-morrow. It's all
arranged. But I want a private word with you, Vi." Taking a key
from her jewelled bag, she led her daughter into an empty card-room which she unlocked, and closed the door, standing against
it.</p>

<p>"That sapphire pendant business was silly," she said then.
"Luckily I made you find it before things got serious." Her words
were light, but her eyes glittered. "By God!" She spoke with a
sudden outflaming of fury. "If you think I've climbed up almost
into safety to let you wreck me on its threshold, you don't know
me even yet, my girl!" Her face was a daunting revelation of what
she might be capable. Violet Finch stared at it in real fear.
Then the face changed. Her mother hung up the curtains again, as
it were, and spoke smoothly. "That aunt of his would be only too
glad to ferret out anything against you."</p>

<p>"She can't!" Violet said, chin in air.</p>

<p>"No, I've seen to that," her mother retorted. "But you would
have made a fool of yourself over Ronald Mills, if I hadn't
stopped you."</p>

<p>"That's past," Violet said sullenly, picking up a paper from
the table beside her.</p>

<p>"To go back, now, to the pendant," Mrs. Finch continued. "If I
ever catch you trying games of that kind again before you're
safely married to Arthur, you'll be sorry for yourself!" Again
that look of latent ferocity swept up for a second, glowed like a
red danger signal, and then dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" Violet said sullenly. And then in a tone of
intense surprise: "But what's my name doing here, on this
paper?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch would have snatched it from her, but in physical
strength Violet was her mother's superior.</p>

<p>"Why, it's something to do with my death!" She stared blankly
at the paper in her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Mrs. Finch said casually. "You knew, months ago,
that I was going to sell the Reversion to the thousand your
father left you a life interest in, which I bought from you last
year. Well, I'm selling it to Gray." She and Violet always
referred to her present husband by his surname. "For I must
scrape every possible farthing together just now. What are you
fussing about?"</p>

<p>"I'm not fussing&mdash;I'm asking." Violet laid the paper down
again as she spoke. "What a funny thing to be doing to-night!"</p>

<p>"My affairs come up for hearing in the Bankruptcy Court to-morrow," her mother replied with really amazing indifference.
"And I want to get rid of all I can to Gray first." She did not
add that that was precisely why she had married again. Violet
knew as much. So did Henry Gray.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not likely to do Gray much good," Violet laughed.
After all, she was too well satisfied to-night to be vexed for
long. "I feel as though I should live for another century." And
before going back to the ballroom she paused to adjust the pearls
afresh.</p>

<p>"They're to be mine," her mother said with a covetous look at
their lustre.</p>

<p>"No, they're to be heirlooms," Arthur says.</p>

<p>"That's why he doesn't give them outright to me," Violet
grumbled.</p>

<p>"I'll have a talk with him about them. 'Heirlooms,' indeed!"
Mrs. Finch snorted.</p>

<p>"You'll find out that there's a stone wall in Arthur that you
can't always climb over, mother. Even I can't," warned Violet as
she opened the door again and returned to the dancing.</p>

<p>Over and over she fingered the superb pearls around her
throat. She lifted her dark head still more proudly, and she had
an arrogant carriage at all times. There were plenty of young
women in the room, many of them prettier, most of them better
born. But it was she, Violet Finch, who had captured the rich
prize, Arthur Walsh.</p>

<p>Take Ann Lovelace, for instance, floating by at that minute in
one of the newest dances. She made you feel as though your
smartest clothes came from Woolworth's, yet she hadn't been able
to get Arthur away, though she had tried hard enough.</p>

<p>Ann raised her eyes as she was passing, and paused a moment.
They were light grey eyes, very clear and tranquil.</p>

<p>"How well you're looking to-night, Violet," she said kindly.
"Of course, those exquisite pearls are a joy in themselves, but
it isn't only the pearls, is it?" she murmured with a smile of
comprehension.</p>

<p>Ann had a heart-shaped face, beautifully featured, and framed
in light golden hair. She was a niece of the Duchess of
Axminster&mdash;a favourite niece, it was said. She looked the
part. Slender, witty, always charmingly dressed&mdash;she had an
air of fragile grace, every glimpse of which Violet detested
because it made her feel like a farmer's daughter in comparison.
And she had an uneasy doubt as to what lay behind that appearance
of friendliness which Ann had shown her since their meeting at
Friars Halt a fortnight before.</p>

<p>Kitty Walsh could have told her, but Kitty was no mischief
maker. She was, indeed, one of the very few people in the room
that evening who thought that her cousin was not making a bad
match. For Kitty rather liked Violet, though the liking did not
extend to Violet's mother&mdash;nor to Ronald Mills, the young
man who helped Mrs. Finch run the night-clubs that had once been
so incredibly profitable to her.</p>

<p>"Cleaned everybody out?" Kitty asked her uncle as he suddenly
appeared beside her.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh was known to be a formidable bridge player He
smiled a little. Kitty could always get that tribute from him.
"What are you staying on here for?" he asked genially. "You look
as though you belonged in the schoolroom, you know." And he
tweaked an end of the ribbon she wore round her long, full silk
gown.</p>

<p>"Ah, my looks are deceptive&mdash;like Ann's!" she said
lightly, and then coloured with vexation. The last words had
slipped out.</p>

<p>"How you do dislike Ann!" her uncle teased, But his eyes were
a little wistful as he glanced across at Ann's lovely figure in
its dress of silver and jade.</p>

<p>"I do," Kitty said frankly. "She never gives herself away; and
I hate people who never give themselves away!" She made a little
face at him as she changed the subject. "I suppose there's no
chance of Aunt Caroline altering her mind and turning up?" she
queried as she caught sight of her aunt's intimate friend coming
towards them.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh shook his head. His sister had refused to come.
The Colonel regretted the engagement, too. But he was no tyrant,
though he had cut his eldest son off with a shilling&mdash;or, to
be strictly accurate, with a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"Your aunt fears that Arthur's making a sad mistake. So does
Ambrose. So do I. But Arthur's been frank and straightforward
about the whole thing, so I don't intend to interfere."</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh and Kitty were close confidantes.</p>

<p>"What's the mother like?" he asked now, glancing that way.
"Looks like a respectable elderly governess. But what's she
really like?"</p>

<p>"I detested her when I spent those three days with her, you
know&mdash;when the flat had to have a new system of lighting put
in."</p>

<p>The Colonel nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you mean she was offensive?" He bristled.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! On the contrary. She was awfully pleasant to
me. But I don't think I've ever disliked any one quite so much
without any reason."</p>

<p>"Except Ann!" he chaffed back.</p>

<p>"Ann!" she said under her breath. "Violet Finch mayn't be all
you would like Arthur's wife to be," she continued softly, "but
she's ever so much better than Ann Lovelace. Ann's selfish. She
has a horrid temper. You remember that we were at Bedington
together, she and I. Oh, yes, she was 'Head Girl' in her last
year. But none the less there were plenty of others who felt just
as I did. Ann always intended to be 'Head Girl,' and so, of
course, she pulled it off."</p>

<p>"I think your aunt hopes she will still draw Arthur away from
Violet Finch."</p>

<p>"Not a chance!" Kitty said at once. "Arthur adores Violet.
Absolutely!" There was a something in her young voice that made
her uncle look away. It sounded like very far-off, very repressed
pain.</p>

<p>"Anyway, those pearls that Ann helped her choose look superb
ones," the Colonel said hurriedly. "On loan to-night, I take it,
as they're to be his wedding present?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're lent to her till then. She asked Ann to help her
choose them." Kitty did not add that the two strings of pearls in
question had been a staggering extravagance, even for so rich a
lover as was Arthur Walsh.</p>

<p>Lady Norton came up to them just then. She was the close
friend of her aunt whom Kitty had noticed a few moments
before.</p>

<p>The Colonel soon went back to the card tables and Lady Norton
drew Kitty down into a chair beside her. "I must say the
cocktails are worth coming for," she said with a grin, "as one
would expect. But who is the handsome man hovering around Mrs.
Finch?"</p>

<p>"That's Ronald Mills. He's a sort of manager of hers. Looks
after her night-clubs for her and so on..."</p>

<p>The other grunted and patted some fresh rouge on her cheek.
"Funny relations you're going to have, my child!" she said
frankly.</p>

<p>Kitty moved restlessly in her chair. "I think that's
ungenerous!" she said warmly. "Arthur isn't marrying to please
us. Why should he? He's most tremendously in love. And why not?
Violet has all sorts of sterling qualities. She'll make him a
splendid wife. He's been inclined to drift, you know, to take
life easy...Violet's a good fighter. She'll make him do his bit.
And that's what Arthur needs."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you <i>like</i> the girl?" Lady Norton
demanded incredulously. "Your aunt considers her impossible."</p>

<p>"But she's <i>not</i> impossible," Kitty said firmly. "She is
not, really! She's very outspoken&mdash;and forthright. Uncle
will love that in her. She's unselfish, too. She took no end of
trouble when I lost my sapphire pendant while I stayed over a
week-end with them. And it was Violet who finally unearthed it,
caught fast in a curtain fringe, just before I left."</p>

<p>"And do you also like her mother?" demanded Lady Norton
sarcastically. Kitty was silent.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Ann's mother, Lady Rosemary, would say about
her," Lady Norton went on meditatively&mdash;and meaningly. "She
was, you know, the cause of Ann's step-brother shooting himself.
Those night-clubs of hers were sinks of iniquity. I wanted to go
to one, out of curiosity. But we were stationed at Malta while
they were the rage. And now, of course, they've gone out
completely. I hear that Mrs. Finch won't have a bean left when
they're finally wound up." Lady Norton added with relish.</p>

<p>Kitty fidgeted silently. She did not care to be connected even
distantly with Mrs. Finch. And, as another partner came up to
release her, she took good care to keep away from her aunt's
friends for the rest of the evening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>

Pearls Can Be at Once Very Useful and Very Dangerous.</h2>

<p class="first">ON the following evening Violet was playing
bridge at Colonel Walsh's house in Grosvenor Square. He was
presenting the house to Arthur as a wedding gift, together with a
separate fund for its maintenance. Violet was very much to the
fore on this occasion. A trifle self-assertive, and more than a
trifle dictatorial.</p>

<p>But Arthur looked delighted to be allowed to breathe the same
air as his divinity. He played badly. Violet, as always, played
extremely well, and won quite a nice little sum from Ann Lovelace
and her partner.</p>

<p>Ann handed over a couple of notes with a smile. "Nothing can
resist you to-night, Violet. You ought to be at Grayham's," she
said a little later, when Violet happened to be alone with her,
making up in the cloakroom. Ann stretched out a lovely hand and
laid a caressing finger-tip for a second on one of the pearls as
they swung towards her at some movement of their wearer's.</p>

<p>"Where's that?" Violet asked.</p>

<p>"He's a man from South Africa. He has a flat close by, and
lets a few friends who, like himself, only enjoy high play, drop
in for it whenever they feel inclined. Care to have a look in
there? We'll slip away for half an hour."</p>

<p>They got their wraps, and sped quietly downstairs.</p>

<p>A word to her chauffeur, and Ann's car drew up at a house of
flats in Park Lane. "<i>Grayham,"</i> was murmured to the night
porter on duty, and they were shown to a lift. Upstairs, on the
top floor, their guide rang a certain bell and then
disappeared.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a footman who evidently recognised Ann,
for he led them down a short, broad corridor and opened a door at
the end. The two stepped into a large, closely-curtained room in
which <i>chemin de fer</i> and baccarat were in full swing.</p>

<p>There were no introductions. A tall, alert-faced man, rather
of the army type, just glanced up, bowed to Ann, and went on
dealing. No one else looked up at all.</p>

<p>Ann steered Violet to a small table in a bay window presided
over by a very tall, very broad-shouldered, very muscular-looking
servant.</p>

<p>"You take as many cardboard counters as you like," she
explained lightly. "The man stamps your name on each, for they're
as good as notes, and any which you don't use you yourself tear
up. It's only the ones you hand over that count as actual money.
Those of this colour represent each five pounds; those, ten;
those, fifty; those, one hundred. One-pound tokens? Oh, those
lilac-coloured? But, of course, they're very seldom used
here."</p>

<p>Violet helped herself well. She was feeling rich to-night. She
would be married this time next week, and Arthur had had very
generous settlements drawn up. She would be a very wealthy woman
in a few days now. And, although Arthur's solicitors had
stipulated in the settlements that he would not be responsible
for any debts incurred by her before their marriage, Violet could
smile at the stipulation. He was her abject slave, and he would
remain so, she knew.</p>

<p>She glanced at the clock. It was just past midnight as she
seated herself at the baccarat table. At first her luck was in.
But it deserted her presently. By that time it was three o'clock
in the morning, and Ann and she must return. Violet, however,
found this easier said than done. Mr. Grayham and a couple of
"friends" of his, at least, he called them so, moved incessantly
to and fro, entering in their note-books how much each departing
visitor owed, or was owed. Paying or receiving, accordingly, as
swiftly as bank clerks. Mr. Grayham now came over to Violet, to
whom he was introduced by Ann. Smiling genially, he said how much
he regretted that Miss Finch's first visit had resulted in a
deficit. Just a little matter of only four hundred and seventy-five pounds, however.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a cheque&mdash;" Violet said hastily&mdash;abruptly.
"I'll draw you a cheque for it."</p>

<p>"Delighted," murmured her host. "In this side-room." He held
open its door and the three stepped in. Shutting the door behind
him, he motioned the two young women to a writing-table and
comfortable arm-chairs.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you while you draw it," he murmured. Then he added
as in afterthought, "by the way, I hope you don't mind, but as
this is your guest's first visit, Miss Lovelace, will you write
me a line as sponsor for the cheque? You know our few rules."</p>

<p>"Certainly," Ann replied carelessly, and Mr. Grayham left
them.</p>

<p>Ann adjusted the pale pastel flowers that formed one of her
shoulder straps, and with which her cloak of silver cloth seemed
lined. Violet drew a deep breath as she picked up a pen.</p>

<p>"Of course, I can't guarantee your cheque without any security
for it," Ann said smilingly. "But if you're in a tight hole for
the moment I'll lend you the money with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you?" Violet's tone was effusively grateful.</p>

<p>"Certainly. On the shorter of your two pearl necklaces so
gorgeously displayed around your pretty throat. As I helped you
choose it, I don't need to have it valued first. Just over a
thousand pounds Arthur paid for it, I know. You're a lucky girl,
Violet. Well, would you like me to give Grayham my cheque
instead of drawing one yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks ever so!" Violet unfastened the string of lovely
pearls in question and stood playing with it, running the pearls
fondly through her well-manicured rather thick fingers, while
Ann, picking up a pen, drew her cheque for the four hundred and
seventy-five pounds. But, as Violet handed the pearls to her, Ann
asked her to sit down again for a moment more.</p>

<p>"You must give me a line, you know, to say that the pearls are
one of the two strings I saw bought, the Queen Charlotte's
pearls,' as they were called by the jeweller; and a further line
to say that they are your own property, that you have a perfect
right to raise a loan on them, and that you will redeem them
within a month after your marriage to Arthur, at latest."</p>

<p>"But surely all that's quite unnecessary between friends, as
we are," Violet exclaimed, with a confident smile.</p>

<p>"Absolutely necessary," was the cool and quite definite reply.
"To me, at least."</p>

<p>Violet met Ann's firm look and capitulated, though with an
inward curse. She wrote the words dictated, signed the paper,
handed it and the pearls to Ann, and received in return the
cheque; then they stepped back into the other room. Mr. Grayham
seemed to have eyes in the back of his head. He left one of his
friends to continue paying out notes, and was at their side in a
moment. Violet handed him Ann's cheque.</p>

<p>"Miss Finch will settle with me," Ann said lightly. Grayham
gave her a receipt, and saw them to the door, all smiles and
pleasant speeches.</p>

<p>At eleven next morning, Arthur was told that Miss Lovelace and
Miss Walsh had called and would like to see him.</p>

<p>The drawing-room in Grosvenor Square looked very pleasant that
sunny morning, but it was unmistakably the drawing-room of a
bachelor&mdash;or a widower. Arthur's mother had died at his
birth.</p>

<p>"Kitty, what's the matter?" Arthur began, before he was well
into the room.</p>

<p>Kitty shook her head. She looked uneasy. "Don't ask me. This
is Ann's show. She routed me out this morning and said I must
come along. That it was a family matter&mdash;a 'Walsh'
matter."</p>

<p>Ann Lovelace&mdash;dressed in cool-looking muslin and a large,
shady black hat&mdash;hesitated a moment perceptibly. Her long
gloves, matching her bag and shoes, were black, and she stood
smoothing them along her slender arms before she spoke.</p>

<p>"It's a very serious matter, I fear," she said at length,
hesitantly. "And I hate to speak of it, Arthur. Believe me, I do,
indeed, but I can't help myself. It's concerned with Violet
Finch."</p>

<p>"Then she ought to be present," Kitty broke in hotly.</p>

<p>Ann silenced her with a look&mdash;calm, but authoritative.
"Not at all! On the contrary, we must first decide what is best
to be done for all sakes. She borrowed close on five hundred
pounds from me last night. Oh&mdash;" in reply to a quick forward
step on Arthur's part. "It's not the money that troubles me! But
she asked me to lend it to her on the security of one of those
pearl necklaces you had given her. One of the 'Queen Charlotte's'
necklaces. I agreed, and suggested the smaller one." She
paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" snapped Arthur. His face had flushed deeply. Even the
whites of his eyes were suffused.</p>

<p>Kitty was speechless. What was coming? If she knew
Ann&mdash;and she did&mdash;it would be something very
clever&mdash;and very unpleasant for Violet Finch. For that Ann
Lovelace was no friend of Arthur's fiance, Kitty was
convinced.</p>

<p>With great deliberation Ann undid her black shopping bag with
its chased silver mount to let her slender, coral-nailed fingers
extract a string of pearls and a sheet of note-paper. "Here is
what she wrote, assuring me that these pearls are her own
property, and that she has therefore a perfect right to raise a
loan on them. Well, by merest chance, as it happens, I heard this
morning that the pearls are not at all Violet's as yet. That they
are only to become her own on her wedding day; and that even then
they are to be family heirlooms. Which means, of course, that she
had absolutely no right whatever to pledge them to me for the
requested loan."</p>

<p>"I will make that pledge good," Arthur declared instantly and
stiffly; and Kitty could have clapped him on the shoulder for the
championship, for his deep and loyal anger at the aspersion
against Violet.</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't doubt that you would," Ann said gently. "But I
don't see how we're going to get around a startling difficulty in
the way. These pearls aren't real. This is a necklace of
imitation pearls."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Arthur exclaimed rudely, furiously, while Kitty
caught her breath in, aghast.</p>

<p>Violet had certainly had no shadow of right to allege&mdash;as
she had in that paper; it lay on the table and Kitty was reading
it&mdash;that she owned the pearls; but that was as nothing to
this dreadful rider. In a few days the pearls given to Violet
provisionally were to be truly her own, as Arthur's wedding gift,
although to be held as an heirloom. But if there were any reality
in Ann's accusation&mdash;!</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense, and spiteful nonsense!" Arthur went
on still more roughly. "Of course these are the pearls I bought
as part of my wedding gift."</p>

<p>He reached out to seize them, but in a twinkling Ann had
slipped the string over her head and down inside her frock. She
had on an ostrich-feather boa, and it covered the clasp.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" Arthur exclaimed with clenching teeth, looking
as though he could have struck Violet's accuser.</p>

<p>"Arthur!" Ann said quietly, "I think you're growing a bit
Finchy yourself. <i>I</i> don't tell lies, nor cheat, nor steal.
For that so-called 'loan' was stolen from me. I've asked Violet
to meet me here without fail; and, as I hear some car driving up
in a great hurry, it's probably hers. Oh, I haven't any wish to
take her character away behind her back!" she finished with an
open sneer. "I tried to get the Colonel here, too but he couldn't
come."</p>

<p>The rage in Arthur's face again did Kitty good to see. But its
occasion was tragic. If Ann's charge had any foundation...I Could
it possibly have any? Ann was a serpent...Guile was her positive
genius...</p>

<p>Quick and not overlight feet could now be heard coming up the
stairs, and Violet was shown in. Was it that Kitty's eye was
distorted by the previous scene? Or did Violet usually dress with
greater care? Look less&mdash;well, yes, less common?</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" Violet demanded, as she entered, her
colour mounting and then paling sickeningly as she saw Ann
Lovelace. Kitty did not like that whitening face.</p>

<p>"Miss Finch, you got me to lend you close on five hundred
pounds on a sham security," Ann said clearly and haughtily.
"These aren't pearls at all. They're wax beads."</p>

<p>Kitty gave a sort of cry at this, and snatched in her turn at
the string around Ann's neck which the wearer was touching
scornfully.</p>

<p>"You liar! Or you've changed them!" Violet said hoarsely. And,
as she heard her, a great relief came to Kitty. Of course! Ann
had dug a pit, and was now about to fall into it herself. Kitty
had never before known Ann to go anything like as far as this.
But, given sufficient motive&mdash;and cover&mdash;there was
nothing sinister of which she believed her incapable.</p>

<p>"Ah!" came from Arthur. And his tone of relief told Kitty how
similarly he had been feeling. "Ah, I might have thought of
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Instead of believing her lies against me!" stormed
Violet.</p>

<p>"I didn't believe them, darling," he said swiftly. "But
neither did I dream of such an explanation."</p>

<p>"Not being an absolute fool, you didn't," Ann interrupted, for
hate was rising above dignified coolness. "How could I have had
pearls copied which were not in my possession? If you weigh this
string and the real one&mdash;if you even lay them side by
side&mdash;you'll find them apparently identical. I've been to
Rinks' this morning with that string, and they looked up their
books."</p>

<p>Here Violet grew abusive, shrilling out her version of the
affair. On Ann's insistence she had handed her the real pearls
last night and regretted it bitterly enough at the time. She
clutched Arthur's arm and assured him that she would never,
never, never touch a gambling card again. She shrieked at Ann's
perfidy in having taken her to a private gambling place for her
own ends.</p>

<p>Kitty had never admired Arthur so much as now. It was both
pain and pleasure to see how his hand covered Violet's, how he
held her close, how he soothed and tried to quiet her hysterical
rage.</p>

<p>And in the end Ann was beaten. Kitty had never hoped for this.
But Arthur refused to listen to her, and as Ann, forgetting other
things for the moment, leant far forward to assure Arthur that he
was making the mistake of his life in not believing her, the
beads swung free from her hands, and in a second, with a
swiftness and a force that delighted Kitty, though it startled
her, Violet had grabbed them, tugged the string in two, though it
was strongly knotted between each pearl, and thrust them into the
little silk handbag that she clutched tightly under her arm.</p>

<p>For a second Kitty thought Ann would actually spring at the
other girl. But her self-control held. Instead, she gave Violet a
look of such real and utter contempt that Kitty's faith wavered,
gave Arthur its mate, and then, head high, would have left the
room had not Arthur placed himself with his back to the door to
prevent it.</p>

<p>"No, you can't leave like that, Ann," he said, and spoke in
measured tones. "Not until you fully realise that if one word of
these false accusations of yours get about I shall bring an
action for libel&mdash;or rather my wife will."</p>

<p>Ann looked about her for the paper that had lain on the table.
It, too, was gone&mdash;into Arthur Walsh's pocket!</p>

<p>"You have no proofs!" His flaming eyes burnt out of his
deeply-flushed face as he spoke. He was in a rage of which Kitty
had never thought him capable.</p>

<p>"Here is my cheque for your loan. I insist on your taking it.
Violet regrets the whole transaction deeply. That, instead of
coming to me, she borrowed from you. But your tale about her
having got the loan from you on imitation pearls&mdash;" His
teeth clicked together audibly. The muscles on his cheeks bulged
for a second. Again Kitty felt that the natural man would have
liked to hit out at Ann, standing quite composedly, though very
white, before him.</p>

<p>For a second they stood face to face, then she made a gesture
with her hand, motioning him to step out of her way. But he held
his ground.</p>

<p>"I must have your promise, Ann, to keep absolute silence about
this whole scene and affair," he persisted. "You thought you
could disgrace Violet. You planned it all with devilish
cleverness. But it won't work. I believe she speaks the truth,
and I don't believe that you do, about the whole miserable
matter."</p>

<p>"Yet you carefully pocket the paper she signed?" Ann's voice
was contemptuous.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And she broke and pocketed the string of alleged pearls!"</p>

<p>For a second Ann's self-control shook again, but she said no
more, only stood a moment with head bent. Then she raised it to
add quietly:</p>

<p>"I thought you were making a dreadful mistake. But it seems
that it was <i>I</i> who made one. I see now that you and Miss
Finch are well matched. As for your cheque repaying me, I accept
it. I have no intention whatever&mdash;though <i>she</i>
had&mdash;of making your fiance a present of my loan."</p>

<p>Her tone was steel. Then she stopped herself and with a final
gesture of utter scorn for both, passed through the door which he
now held open for her departure.</p>

<p>"Darling!" Violet flung her arms around Arthur's neck. "My own
darling! That hateful creature! What awful lies! Oh, take me
away, where I shall never meet her again!"</p>

<p>"My own Violet!" Arthur said tenderly. "I'll take you home at
once. Forget the whole spiteful fiasco! But what about you, Kit?
Will you come, too?"</p>

<p>Kitty, however, promptly said she needed a walk. And she did.
A silent, almost forgotten spectator of the drama, she felt her
brain spinning as she recalled it. What would her uncle do? Would
he try to stop the marriage by cutting off Arthur's hugely
increased marriage allowance and revoking his gift of the capital
involved? As well as that of the Town house? Kitty wondered sadly
if a struggle were coming between the Colonel and this his second
and only surviving son? For Arthur would not give Violet
up&mdash;of that Kitty now felt sure. But what would her uncle's
attitude be? He was a broad-minded man, with but one
detestation&mdash;personal deceit, and especially of a lie to
him. That had cost him Gerald. Was it now&mdash;through Violet
Finch&mdash;to cost him Arthur? For Violet had set it down in
black and white that the pledged pearls were her actual
property...</p>

<p>Kitty thought that Violet might have considered that a very
trifling inaccuracy; but to her uncle there was no such thing as
a "trifling" untruth. And, apart from that, even for Violet Finch
it was surely no mere inaccuracy to say that wax imitations were
real pearls, and to borrow a considerable sum of money on
them...Kitty felt that she must get some clear idea of what had
really happened. She could not discuss it with her uncle. Arthur
might, but Kitty carried no guns that could cope with her
uncle's. Then she bethought herself of Ambrose Walsh, her cousin
and Arthur's.</p>

<p>Ambrose Walsh was a priest. He was only a little older than
Arthur himself, but brilliant, even as a boy. You never could
deceive Ambrose in the old days; and he was hardly likely to have
grown less clear-sighted with the years. He was home, from a
leper station, on sick leave, which he was using to write a book.
His few books were by way of being literary landmarks.</p>

<p>Kitty had always liked Ambrose. Fearless, honest, by character
he might have been Colonel Walsh's son instead of his nephew. She
would try for an interview with him in private. She had better
telephone first and find out if he could see her. For Father
Walsh was an important person. The lay brother who answered the
telephone asked her name. He told her that Father Walsh was
engaged for the moment and had an appointment for the next hour,
but if Miss Walsh could come then...? Kitty could and would. She
felt chilled at the thought of even the hour's delay, and half
regretted the impulse that had made her ring her cousin up. But,
having done so, she must keep the appointment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>

A Marriage Takes Place.</h2>

<p class="first">KITTY was before her time at the Priest's House
in Islington. She was shown into a very bare little waiting-room.
Three doors opened out of it. One was Ambrose Walsh's sitting-room, and she heard voices in conversation within it. Kitty
stiffened, for one voice was Ann's. Well, she might have known
it. Ambrose had been Ann's confessor for a few months. Ann would
be sure to want to get her story in first. Very likely she was
even enlisting Ambrose's help to give the Colonel her version of
what had happened. What <i>had</i> happened? Kitty asked herself
again. Who had been lying...? Something about Ann's exit had been
very telling...And, though it seemed incredible that Violet
should have done such a thing, yet how had the pearls been
imitated?</p>

<p>But against those doubts rose her old well-founded distrust of
Ann Lovelace. Ann of the quiet voice and effective manner, the
cool calm eyes, the subtle brain. Kitty had felt quite certain
that Ann meant to get triumphantly between Arthur and Violet
Finch, that she had secretly tried hard to do this during the
week they had all spent together at the Walsh's place in the
country.</p>

<p>For when Arthur wrote that he was bringing his fiance down for
a week's visit, his aunt had promptly asked Ann to come down,
too. Ann, with whom Arthur had been so madly in love, in the days
when Gerald was still at home. Handsome, careless, undependable
Gerald. The days when Arthur, though well off, was still only the
younger son. There was no entail in the family. The Colonel could
leave his really big fortune as he liked, but it was natural to
expect that the elder would get the lion's share. Also, Ann, at
that time, was all out to marry Lord Wilverstone. But there, too,
she failed. Lord Wilverstone married an old love of his, despite
Ann's cleverest counter-diplomacy. Kitty happened to know,
however, that Ann had nearly succeeded there.</p>

<p>Again her thoughts returned, now, to her present problem, as
she distantly heard the sound of Ann Lovelace's quiet but
"carrying" voice, speaking evidently with what, for Ann, amounted
to vehemence. Nor were the sounds misleading. For, inside, Father
Ambrose and Ann were facing each other dynamically at the two
ends of his mantelshelf. The Reverend Ambrose Walsh was solidly
built, physically, and something about his face, with its
strongly-marked features, suggested a character also firmly
built. Pale of face, with a beak of a nose, 'a flexible, long
upper lip and firm jaw&mdash;his brilliant and keenly-penetrating
eyes were fastened searchingly on his visitor's.</p>

<p>"It's a bad, sad business," he said regretfully when she
stepped speaking. His own voice had irrepressible warm
undertones. It suggested subdued but strong passions underneath.
Just as his face did. "A very bad, very sad business," he
repeated, half to himself. "But if it breaks his engagement to
such a character it may prove a blessing to him yet."</p>

<p>"It won't break it!" Ann said decisively. "Nothing can do
that. It's as if she had Arthur under a witch's spell."</p>

<p>"I wonder what his father, my uncle, will say," murmured
Ambrose Walsh reflectively.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur will swear to him by all his gods that Violet's an
innocent dove, that it's I, not she, that is the guilty one."</p>

<p>A very penetrating glance flashed for a second from Father
Ambrose's eyes, but Ann's were fastened on her gloves, as she
wrinkled and smoothed their gauntlets. "He once trusted and liked
me," she continued composedly; "but Violet Finch holds him, as I
said, just as though he were under some spell. He can't seem to
see or hear the truth, where she's concerned. You met her, I
remember, one afternoon down at Friar's Halt. Did you see
anything in her to account for such an infatuation?"</p>

<p>The priest made no answer and Ann moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to know all the facts, Father, so as to be able
to explain things to your uncle, Colonel Walsh." Ann had not come
for that reason at all. But she knew that Ambrose Walsh was
against the marriage; and she hoped that, learning from her what
more than sufficient reason he had for his opposition&mdash;he
would increase his personal pressure on Arthur to persuade him to
give up the girl. After all, Arthur, too, was a Catholic. Like
all the Walshes, at one time, he had been quite under his
cousin's influence.</p>

<p>Father Ambrose showed her out by a door that did not lead back
into the common sitting-room where Kitty sat impatiently counting
the minutes. Then he gravely welcomed his second visitor. His
eyes lit up as they shook hands, for he liked Kitty sincerely.
And whenever he saw her he saw not the charming young woman, but
his romping child cousin. Saw himself, too, again a mischievous
schoolboy making her walk the plank into a tub of water and
getting soundly thrashed for it afterwards, as well as in a score
of childhood's scenes.</p>

<p>He led her into his own little sitting-room and closed the
door. "Well, Kit? What brings you for the first time to see me
here?"</p>

<p>"I oughtn't to have come," she said to that. "Really, Ambrose,
I shouldn't take up your time, but I'm bewildered...and
frightened. Ann Lovelace has just left, hasn't she? Oh, never
mind," as he made no reply. "I know she has been here. I'm come
on the same matter...That accusation against Violet Finch about
the pearls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't think the charge of fraud is true?" he
questioned.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she replied promptly. "Partly because Ann
Lovelace is making it, and also because it's absolutely
incredible It makes Arthur's fiance just a common thief!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it would be the best thing that could happen to
Arthur if it could be shown to be true," Ambrose said in his
authoritative, crisp way. "I didn't say that to Ann, and I shan't
say it to Arthur, probably. But it's stern facts, Kit. I have met
Miss Finch, have talked with her, studied her. And I tell you
candidly&mdash;and confidentially&mdash;that if Arthur marries
her&mdash;he's doomed!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;!" Kitty demanded. But she knew how uncannily right
Ambrose's summing up of people and consequences used to prove in
the end.</p>

<p>"Because she's devoted, soul and body, to the World and the
Flesh&mdash;if not to the Devil. And because Arthur is only too
much inclined that way himself."</p>

<p>"You always wanted Arthur to be a priest, too!" Kitty said
resentfully.</p>

<p>He gave her a steely look. "Catherine"&mdash;Ambrose only
called her that when he wished to emphasise the fact that he was
speaking with authority&mdash;"stand aside! Have nothing to do
with the woman or the affair of her pearls. It is just possible
that Providence may be going to take a hand&mdash;to save Arthur
from damnation."</p>

<p>"Marriage with Violet Finch doesn't mean
damnation&mdash;necessarily," she protested indignantly. "I wish,
of course, that she were one of us. But she may come to
be&mdash;given time and fair play."</p>

<p>Ambrose looked very much the priest. His face stiffened, his
look grew inscrutable. He was clearly not taken with the notion
of a converted Violet.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Kitty felt done. She had come for
nothing. Ambrose had no light to shed on this matter. Or if he
had, he was keeping it for his own use. But she stood to her
guns.</p>

<p>"Ambrose, Ann, of course, has told you her version&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think she's told me the truth," he said deliberately,
dispassionately. "I questioned her closely."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't think she has!" Kitty blazed out. "Not by a
long, long lot! Ann Lovelace would do <i>anything</i> to get her
knife into Violet, to get Arthur from her&mdash;for herself!"</p>

<p>Her cousin, Ambrose, seemed, on this, to have grown very
chilling, very distant, as he looked down at her with eyes veiled
and inscrutable.</p>

<p>"At least, whatever may be her faults, she is a lady and a
religious woman at heart," he answered sternly.</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff, Ambrose!" Kitty said hotly, throwing off the awe
of the priest. "That's her cloak. She's just a&mdash;" But she
stopped herself. For the Reverend Ambrose Walsh did not seem to
hear her. She recognised clearly that his mind was definitely
closed to any further discussion of Violet's case.</p>

<p>"Evidently you're on Ann's side," she concluded coldly.</p>

<p>And at that Father Ambrose gave a fleeting smile as he said
calmly, "I'm on her side, certainly, if she can rightly prevent
Arthur's disastrous marriage to Miss Finch."</p>

<p>Kitty rose to leave. Coldly asking, as she glanced at his
writing-table overflowing with papers and books: "What is your
coming book about?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Church Militant</i>," he said in a ringing tone.
"There's far too much talk of converts slithering from the
Anglican Church into ours as though there were small difference
between them. I want the gates, on the contrary, to be barred and
locked, except to those who show the right credentials for
admission. I want there to be an end to marriages between
ourselves and heretics&mdash;no matter though we do get their
children, who are not worth the having, as a rule.</p>

<p>"I would rather&mdash;" He stopped himself. To Ambrose Walsh
the sheep and the goats were born to be separated. And only he
himself knew what a blow it had been to him to learn that his
cousin Arthur was going to marry outside his Church, even apart
from other considerations. There had been a time when he had seen
a great deal of Arthur...when he had cherished strong hopes of
getting him, too, to enter a Religious Life, either as a Priest
or as a Brother. But in these last years Arthur had drawn away
more and more from Ambrose, had left his letters unanswered, had
refused to be in when he called...To any one who knew Ambrose
Walsh at all, Arthur could have done nothing better calculated to
make his cousin more firmly determined on getting his own
way&mdash;even had there been no religious dynamic involved.</p>

<p>In silence he opened the door now for Kitty's departure and
she felt herself still in pinafores, morally, as she said good-bye to him. She went down at once to Friar's Halt, and saw, as
she stepped into Colonel Walsh's study, that he knew. He looked
as though he had had a great shock.</p>

<p>"You've seen Ann," she said without hesitation.</p>

<p>He nodded. "She met me going to my club." He paused as Arthur
came hurrying into the house and the room. He had driven Violet
home, and had had a hard task to convince her that to him she was
beyond suspicion, far above reproach. But he had succeeded in
doing so. Now, as soon as he saw his father's face, he, too, knew
that the Colonel had been met by Ann and her story.</p>

<p>His own face hardened; his back straightened; his jaw set.</p>

<p>"I'd like you to stay, Kitty," was his greeting, "as Violet's
friend. Thank God, you're not prejudiced against her!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," Kitty replied. Hearing which, the Colonel
wheeled on her.</p>

<p>"What? You don't believe&mdash;?" He checked himself. "Look
here," he began again, "I don't think we need drag you into this
harrowing question, Kitty, except for one vital query. Have you
ever known Ann Lovelace to tell a lie? I don't mean those polite,
stereotyped words which we all use as 'delighted' to meet people,
or 'sorry' to see them go, etcetera. I mean by a 'lie' a
deliberate, downright falsehood. Have you ever heard her utter
one?"</p>

<p>"No," Kitty answered reluctantly. "But I've known her do still
worse when it suited her game. I've known her so to put the truth
so that it sounded more false than any outright lie could
be."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite possible,"&mdash;agreed the Colonel promptly. "But
subtlety of that sort need not be considered here, even if a
fact. For here Ann makes certain definite assertions. She
declares that she lent a considerable sum of money to Miss Finch
on the pledged security of a certain necklace which was not, as
Miss Finch stated them to be, her own property, and which,
moreover, is not a string of real pearls, but a wax
<i>imitation.</i> Ann and I went to Rinks', and saw the assistant
manager who dealt with the affair. He assured me that the
necklace shown him by Miss Lovelace earlier this morning was an
exact facsimile of the shorter of the two necklaces which you,
Arthur, bought of them.</p>

<p>"He agreed, too, with Ann that such a copy could only have
been made from the original; and then only by an expert
craftsman. He also further affirmed that the imitation Ann showed
him was an exact duplicate of the original pearl necklace in
weight and colour. For Ann had made him go into the matter very
thoroughly indeed before coming to you, Arthur.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, I'm inexpressibly sorry for your terrible shock;
but I can't see that there's any possibility that Ann is not
telling the absolute truth about it. She says you have taken
possession of the paper written by Violet herself&mdash;" At this
point Colonel Walsh caught sight of aghast Kitty, and insisted on
her leaving them. He had quite forgotten her presence. And this
was no question of attitude to one or the other girl. It was a
question of actual facts; and the Colonel uncompromisingly held
that he and his only son must sift these to the bottom
together.</p>

<p>Kitty glanced back at her cousin. He looked like a man bracing
himself for a bitter struggle, but firmly determined not to yield
an inch of ground. And something in her leapt to meet this new
Arthur, while her heart seemed a stricken thing.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her, there was a second's silence,
then Arthur said: "I have just given Violet those pearls
outright, sir, though they will still be my wedding present to
her. So she has a perfect right to raise money on them in such a
position as she found herself in last night; a position, too,
into which she had been jockeyed by Ann Violet had no other way
of paying her gaming debt there and then. And, seeing that
clearly, she took it. Ann had grossly deceived her as to the
value of the discs with which they were playing. She had told her
that they represented shillings, whereas they were pounds.
<i>Violet's</i> no practised gambler, sir."</p>

<p>"Even though her mother had long kept what were essentially
gambling hells?" the Colonel asked gently, for he was desperately
sorry for his unhappy son.</p>

<p>"Just because of that, sir," Arthur said soberly. "I didn't
conceal from you that, had I known beforehand whose daughter she
was, I wouldn't have avoided her. But as it was...<i>and
is...</i> she's the only woman in the world for me. She's quite
incapable of the charge against her." He stopped. Arthur was
never given to long speeches. His father's eyes were unrelenting,
although his voice had real compunction in its tones.</p>

<p>"Sorry, my dear boy; but after what has come indubitably to
light there can be no going on with the wedding. Surely you must
see that, too?"</p>

<p>"I surely do <i>not,</i> sir!" Arthur's tones were no less
firm than his father's. "It's a vile plot, Ann Lovelace's plot
against Violet. I won't let her, or any one, come between me and
the girl I love! Violet's as true as steel. Honest, loyal,
honourable. Without a crooked fibre in her."</p>

<p>"She lied deliberately when she pledged those pearls as her
own property," the Colonel said in a grim voice. "No, no
"&mdash;as Arthur made a violent movement. "That's not all by a
long way. But it is a thing to which you can't shut your eyes.
<i>Ann</i> didn't write that I.O.U. Miss Finch wrote it herself,
alleging both that she owned the pearls and that the string which
she was handing over to Ann as security for the loan was one of
the two that Ann had helped her choose and seen taken. The value
of which Ann could therefore take on trust. And I cannot see any
loophole where Miss Finch wasn't lying about that last, too."</p>

<p>Arthur kept silent with an effort; but he looked furious and
obstinate.</p>

<p>"You know," the Colonel went on, "what I feel about a lie.
It's not prejudice. It's not attaching an exaggerated importance
to something that really means very little. All civilisation, all
intercourse, all business, is built up on the belief that you can
rely on a deliberate assertion. Why, Religion itself depends on
that! I cut your brother Gerald off as I did because he was a
deliberate liar; in other words, a moral leper. Do you mean to
tell me that you intend to choose such a leper for your wife? For
the mother of your children?"</p>

<p>"I maintain that it is Ann who is the 'moral leper' here,"
Arthur said hotly. "I deny absolutely that Violet was lying when
she scribbled down those words about being the owner of the
pearls. I had told her yesterday that they would be
hers&mdash;absolutely&mdash;on her wedding day. As for the
effective use that Ann made of an imitation necklace on which to
base her accusations against Violet, I intend to have that
curiously plausible production drastically investigated, you may
rest assured, Pater! And you may also rest assured that my wife's
honour will be irrefutably vindicated," Arthur's voice rang out.
And like Kitty, his father rated him the higher for his
unshakable and impassioned championship of the girl he loved. Yet
Colonel Walsh was no less convinced that his son was the victim
of a sheer infatuation.</p>

<p>"Love is often blind," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"I'm not blind!" Arthur exclaimed hotly. "Ann Lovelace hasn't
succeeded in pulling her unscrupulously clever wool over my eyes,
as she has, apparently, over yours, sir."</p>

<p>The Colonel took it quietly. He was too sorry for his son, too
certain that he would yet know the bitterness of awaking, to be
angry.</p>

<p>"How do you mean to prove your case?" he asked, "since you
intend to do so?"</p>

<p>"I mean to hand the whole thing over to a first-class private
investigator," was the firm reply.</p>

<p>"That's sensible!" The Colonel looked, and was relieved. But
he was sorrier still for Arthur. "I think you'd better let me see
about that," he said a little awkwardly.</p>

<p>Arthur's eyes flashed. "You can call in your own man, too,
sir, if you like. But I claim the right to be first in the field.
There's only one thing I do insist on. No steps must be taken
openly for at least a fortnight. Vi and I believe that this is
the only way to give my detective a chance to get at the root and
branches of the matter. I'm keen to have Victor Sewell take
charge of the investigation for me, and his secretary has told
me, over the phone, that Sewell won't be back in town for another
ten days. So everything must be at a standstill until then."</p>

<p>"Victor Sewell?" the colonel asked. "Never heard of him. Who
is he?"</p>

<p>"He's studied for the Bar, but he's private means and likes
problems. Just now he's clearing up a very private and difficult
matter at Oxford in which two college men are concerned," Arthur
replied. "That's in strict confidence, you know. He's a member of
White's. Incidentally, he's a son of the former Commissioner of
New Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Of <i>that</i> Sewell? Clever chap, the old general. Well, if
you think he can serve you in this sad affair&mdash;" The colonel
looked very pityingly at Arthur standing there before him all
fire and eagerness.</p>

<p>"He'll clear Vi, sir," the younger man spoke with a certainty
in his voice and face that made the father's heart ache for him.
"He'll find out the truth. But till then, Vi's to have fair
treatment from everybody. I'll put the fear of God into Ann if
she starts letting her tongue run away with her."</p>

<p>"Ann's tongue doesn't run loosely," the colonel said dryly to
that; "but I think I may possibly be able to persuade her to an
active truce. What about the insurance, though? Are you notifying
them that the smaller string seems lost?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet," Arthur said. "Both strings were insured up to
the hilt, of course. But Vi thinks that, if Ann does not suspect
us of setting investigations and detectives at work, her clever
wits will devise some way to plausibly return the real
pearls.</p>

<p>"Vi's a marvel, sir!" his son ejaculated. "Most girls, under
such an abominable charge, would be wanting Ann Lovelace's blood.
Yet Vi actually believes that Ann may have somehow been 'had'
too! I think she suspects her mother's partner, Mills, of having
had some hand in the exchange. But I, myself, don't agree there.
I used to know Mills rather well, at one time. It was he who
introduced me to the Little Owls. They were top-hole in those
days&mdash;I can't think Mills would have a hand in such an
injury to Violet. I used to be no end of jealous of him at first.
I thought Vi liked him best. However...no open move to be made
until Sewell takes the reins, to drive the whole thing straight
to the truth."</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh responded hopefully outwardly, but with a
sickening certainty that Arthur was riding for a terrible fall.
He went up to Town to see Ann, though, and found her not so easy
to deal with as he had hoped. In the end, however, he got her
promise to keep the whole affair absolutely to herself at
present. But he left her more than ever persuaded that she was
sincere and had really been duped by Violet Finch. Nevertheless,
it seemed to him odd that Ann&mdash;familiar with valuable
pearls&mdash;should not have instantly detected the "feel" of
imitation pearls when they were handed over to her.</p>

<p>This was on Wednesday. And on the following Saturday the
colonel received a terrible blow. It was a letter from Arthur
delivered by hand. In this his son stated that he had been
married to Violet Finch that morning at the Kingsway registry
office; and that they were on a flying "honeymoonette" in the
Engadine. They would be "back home on Tuesday next."</p>

<p>The Colonel sat very still. At first he felt as though he had
heard that Arthur had flung himself over a precipice. Then common
sense came to his aid. After all, marriages nowadays were
anything but permanent...And even did this one prove so, he must
hope for the best. There must be something sweet in Violet to
account for Arthur's indomitable devotion. And with sweetness
allied to spirit no wife could be a misfortune.</p>

<p>Kitty was away from home and he was glad that she, too, would
be gone until Tuesday. In reality she was back on Monday; and the
colonel told himself thankfully that he must have been mistaken
in thinking that she had secretly given her heart to Arthur. For
when she learnt the news Kitty took Arthur's part against his
aunt; who could not forgive him "his mad marriage to Violet
Finch!"</p>

<p>"You should cut him off! You did Gerald for far less!" Lady
Monkhouse said furiously to her brother.</p>

<p>Colonel Walsh winced, but he replied quietly: "Arthur has a
perfect right to follow the dictates of his heart. <i>He</i> did
not deceive me. I may agree that he is a besotted, if not
hoodwinked, young fool; but that's no reason for attempting to
make him see things as we do. Arthur is deeply in love with
Violet, my dear. I only hope he may prove to be right about her,
may be able to stay in love with her always. As to my Deed of
Gift on his marriage, it was executed a week ago; and so comes
into operation at once."</p>

<p>His sister snorted, but the colonel continued calmly: "He
writes that they are going to stay in Mrs. Finch's house in
Ennismore Gardens, when they get back, until the house in
Grosvenor Square can be redecorated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It didn't need any redecorating," snapped his sister; "but I
don't doubt that Finch woman needs the money. He'll pay her for
the use of hers."</p>

<p>The colonel said no more. He was lunching with Ambrose and
feared that he must listen to similar sentiments about the
marriage. But his nephew offered no comment beyond the
significant priestly aphorism that "God's ways are not our ways.
Neither are the devil's, unless we serve him."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>

A Private Investigator Is Called In.</h2>

<p class="first">THE wedding had been a very quiet one, even for
a registry office. Mrs. Finch, who had <i>been</i> away with
Mills superintending the sale of one of her Maidenhead clubs,
came up for it&mdash;after she had ascertained from her
solicitors that the settlements had been duly signed. Besides
which preliminary she had seen to it that both bridegroom and
bride executed each a will. Arthur's bequeathing to Violet
everything of which he should die possessed or entitled to; and
Violet's bequeathing similarly everything to her mother, Mrs.
Finch-Gray.</p>

<p>Only when these matters were all to her satisfaction did "Mrs.
Finch" instruct Ronald Mills&mdash;who had motored her up to
town&mdash;to fetch from their car her wedding present to her
new-made son-in-law. As she presented it, she said
apologetically:</p>

<p>"You insisted on such an unexpectedly sudden marriage, my dear
Arthur, that I was only able to lay my hands on what I hope may
prove useful." Adding sardonically, as she could not ignore his
blank look at the small picnic hamper for two which she held out
smilingly to him: "The wine is good and I made the sandwiches
myself."</p>

<p>Arthur perforce thanked her, promptly transferred the contents
of the little hamper to his suit-case, throwing the wickerwork
away. Violet was quite incapable of dealing with even such small
incidentals to her hasty wedding. She looked almost drunk with
joy as she kissed her mother and shook hands with Ronald Mills
and jumped laughingly, with Arthur's fond help, into the car
waiting to take them to Croydon Aerodrome.</p>

<p>On Tuesday they were back again. Mrs. Finch was still down at
Maidenhead with Mills, but the servants at the house in Ennismore
Gardens had everything ready for the young couple.</p>

<p>After many kisses, Arthur left Violet and went to hunt up
Victor Sewell at the latter's smart office at Buckingham Gardens.
He had assured Violet that he would do this the first moment they
were back in town.</p>

<p>Violet had not shown any impatience about it, but Arthur had
referred again and again to the situation as intolerable, one
which must be cleared up immediately, quite irrespective of the
loss of the necklace. He assured Violet over and over again that
she was not to worry, that Sewell would see to it that the whole
truth came out.</p>

<p>It was with a very lack-lustre eye that his young bride
thanked him. Violet, in truth, had quite lost the exultantly
rapturous look she had worn at her wedding. Indeed her whole
expression as she watched the cliffs of England show white below
them, and then the growing green of the trees and the silver
sheen of the Thames, looked as though she were nerving herself to
face trouble.</p>

<p>Arthur noticed it and pressed her hand. "Don't worry,
darling," he said in her ear, making an excuse of getting up to
look down at something below them. "Sewell has keen brains. He'll
dig out the truth."</p>

<p>But Violet swallowed something in her throat as she returned
his caress.</p>

<p>On calling, Arthur was shown at once into Victor Sewell's
professional office. A spacious but somewhat bare-looking room,
with a pair of comfortable arm-chairs, a knee-hole writing-table,
and very little else&mdash;that could be seen. For its
microphones and wall cameras were well concealed. But these
latter were not wanted now. Sewell knew and liked Arthur Walsh.
Apart from that, he was glad to be called in by him, for Colonel
Walsh's circle of friends included all the most influential names
in the British world of big finance.</p>

<p>Sewell himself was quite well off, but he had a liking for
investigation and was determined to make it a successful
business. He called himself a "Clearing Agent" because he would
only take defensive cases. Cases, that is, where he was engaged
to clear the good name of some aspersed person.</p>

<p>In physique he rather suggested an intelligent monkey. He had
a small dark face with a low forehead, crossed by innumerable
deep lines. When thinking he would raise his eyebrows, wrinkling
his forehead like a concertina, and gaze pensively at you from
deep-set melancholy brown eyes. In his movements, too, he was
quick and darting, as if mentally so. But his manner had
remarkable charm. He would listen in absolute silence to any
story; and yet, through his silence, by the eloquence of his eye
he could, when he wished, encourage and calm. Nothing seemed to
shock or even to surprise him.</p>

<p>Sewell was, as Arthur Walsh had informed his father, the son
of a former Commissioner of New Scotland Yard; but he did not
mean to rise by standing on his father's shoulders. Yet, should
the Yard's help be needed in his investigations, he could rely on
its doing all that it could to assist him. Sewell was not yet
six-and-twenty, but looked much older; a point which he rightly
regarded as an asset.</p>

<p>"Help yourself, my dear fellow," he said cordially to his
visitor, pushing towards him a tray of choice cigars and
cigarettes. And&mdash;confining his initial story to a bare
relation of Ann Lovelace's charges and assertions about the
affair to himself and to his father&mdash;Arthur paused there for
Sewell's comments or questions. The first being: "The pearls are
worth, intrinsically?"</p>

<p>To which his client replied by explaining in detail that on
entering the famous jeweller's shop he had stated that he was
looking for a handsome wedding present for his fiance, and had
been shown two necklace-strings of pearls, which had been the
late Queen Charlotte's favourite wear. He had taken them both,
paying five thousand pounds for the two; the smaller one, now in
question, was priced around one thousand. His fiance told him
that she herself had insured them up to the hilt; the insurance
to run from the date of their wedding.</p>

<p>"So she could prosecute, if need be?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she says she won't," Arthur replied. "Women have
queer reasonings, whether or not they are always intuitions. And
I'm half inclined to share her suspicion that her mother's
partner, Mills, is somehow at the bottom of the mystery. Though
he was by way of being rather a friend of mine at one time.
Ronald Mills&mdash;clever chap! Know him?"</p>

<p>"Just to speak to. A queer fish," Sewell said. "Nothing
actually known against him, yet more than a little rumoured
privately. But, of course, the devil of it is..." He hesitated;
his brows working in embarrassed cogitation.</p>

<p>"You mean Mrs. Finch?" Arthur said at once. "That he's a sort
of partner of hers? Or was. I believe they're winding up the
Little Owls. But I'm not going to let that stand in the way of
clearing my wife from any suspicion of doing a shady act. When
you know her, Sewell, you'll realise how simply impossible it is
to think of her as deceiving any one. But Miss Lovelace doesn't
really know her at all. Hasn't discovered her true character. My
cousin, Kitty Walsh&mdash;you know <i>her,</i> I think?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" Sewell said warmly.</p>

<p>"Well, she's on Violet's side. She knows her well, you see.
And as to Mrs. Finch...half of what's said against her is tittle-tattle, when not lies. Jealousy of her one-time amazing success;
complacent pleasure at her failure, now. Lots of people are like
that, you know. Claw on to those who're rising; trample on them
when they're down."</p>

<p>Sewell nodded.</p>

<p>"Besides, I haven't married Mrs. Finch," Arthur continued with
a smile. "And as to her partnership with Mills&mdash;after all,
she had to have some one in the swim to help her enterprise. And
Mills, as we know, has a dashed plausible way with him when he
chooses. While at one time he was hand in glove with plenty of
the right sort."</p>

<p>"No need to spare Mills," Sewell said. "But when can I see
Mrs. Walsh? I must have a talk with her, of course, before I can
start in for your wife. And I'd like to. I only take the kind of
case that clears people&mdash;as you know. And this looks likely
to prove one compact of counter-psychologies. Unusually
interesting but rather unusually hedged with difficulties."</p>

<p>"Plenty of psychology but not much subtlety about stealing a
valuable string of pearls if it could be managed, I should have
thought," objected Arthur Walsh, but added heartily how glad he
was, and how glad his young wife would be, to have Sewell
undertake her defence and complete vindication. Would Sewell come
back to lunch with them, as his wife also hoped?</p>

<p>Sewell had quite expected this invitation and had kept himself
free to accept it. Arthur accordingly drove him back with him.
Violet had arranged for her cousin-in-law, Kitty Walsh, to also
lunch with them. And Kitty was delighted to hear that Victor
Sewell&mdash;whom she had often met and sincerely liked&mdash;was
to ferret out the truth about the whole mystifying, unhappy
affair of the fraudulent pearls.</p>

<p>Sitting on together after lunch, Sewell put a number of
leading questions vital to his understanding of the case at
issue. His young hostess wore the remaining larger necklace, so
that he could judge for himself how fine its smaller mate must
be.</p>

<p>Violet herself unexpectedly surpassed Sewell's expectations
after all that he had heard confidentially whispered about his
friend's "registry marriage." She was handsome, evidently full of
vitality, and by no means wanting in brains. And although he
thought her utterly without personal charm, Arthur was clearly of
the opposite opinion on that point. Which, of course, was just as
it should be. Indeed his patent adoration, though he tried not to
let it show beyond conventional good taste, was almost pathetic
as Violet ordered him about, though playfully. And Sewell was
glad to see that whatever she said would be endorsed by Arthur,
who, of course, was formally his employer.</p>

<p>"I understand that you left the original necklace lying
overnight on your dressing-table," he jotted down in his
notebook. "And your door was probably unlocked?"</p>

<p>Violet laughed outright. "But of course I was at home, Mr.
Sewell. In my mother's house."</p>

<p>"I forgot," he murmured mendaciously, and then asked the names
of any guests in the house at the time.</p>

<p>Mills had been one, it appeared, but had left the second day
after the purchase of the pearls. Quite long enough, Sewell and
Arthur both thought, to get possession of the pearls and,
supposing him to know a skillful craftsman, to have him make a
copy of it.</p>

<p>"He had his man with him, I suppose?" Sewell asked.</p>

<p>"No. Ronald had had to let him go. He's badly hit by this
crash, you know. He's even given up his service suite and taken a
flat over one of Mr. Gray's garages. And for Ronald that means
horrid discomfort!" Violet's lip curled scornfully. She had
evidently small sympathy, if any liking, for Ronald Mills.</p>

<p>"I have heard a whisper?" Sewell said discreetly.</p>

<p>"Shouted <i>sub rosa,"</i> Violet laughed. "Mrs. Yerkes?
Ronald hopes to announce his engagement any day now. She's got no
end of money."</p>

<p>A little more desultory talk wound up the luncheon party for
Sewell and he took his leave, frankly keen to "get to work."
This, he proposed to himself, should be on Ronald Mills's
footsteps, whom he quite expected to find qualifying for the
criminal's place contrived for the then Miss Finch; if her
unacknowledged but circumstantially indicated suspicions had any
foundation in fact. The issue, however, must rest with the
parties vitally concerned. As a rule, his cases were not
permitted to get into the courts.</p>

<p>Kitty was booked for a dress fitting. Arthur had a very full
afternoon ahead of him. Violet got him to promise that he would
meet her at the Grosvenor Square House at six and see how the
drawing-room walls looked. She waved to him from the window, and
then turned away with a very eager, businesslike face. She had
till six to herself...Mills was with her mother. Her stepfather?
She could not be sure where he was. Probably at the garage in
George Street. So much the better. He never bothered her. He
never bothered any one. Mr. Gray's passion was engineering, and
he was generally to be found with his mechanics.</p>

<p>Violet looked at her watch, waited five minutes, and then went
to the telephone and rang up a Major Richards. Giving him the
number of Mills's flat in Stanley Mews, Mayfair, she added
directions as to how to find the address. "The door to the flats
over the garage is around the corner from the garage itself," she
said. "It's rarely locked, and I shall leave it so that you only
have to push it open when you reach it at four o'clock sharp.
You'll of course come prepared to 'complete?'" Apparently this
question received a satisfactory reply, for she hung up and
turned away&mdash;to find her mother standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Prepared to complete what?" Mrs. Finch asked, after a rather
tepid kiss on both sides.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a little deal," Violet said quickly, "over a short-term leasehold. But I had no idea you were coming back to-day.
How nice!"</p>

<p>"I'm off again at once," her mother responded, going to a
cabinet by the window and unlocking it with a tiny key which she
took from her purse. "I need some papers I left here," she
explained as she put a bunch in her bag.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you send that lazy hound, Ronald?" Violet asked in
an indifferent tone, but with a watchful eye. How much had her
mother overheard? You never could tell&mdash;with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got wind of some party Mrs. Yerkes is throwing, and
is running round trying to get invited. Well, 'bye till Friday,
Vi." And Mrs. Finch ran down the front steps and jumped into a
luxurious-looking car.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
Arthur Walsh Gets a Very Curious Message,<br>
and Scotland Yard Is Summoned to a Murder Case.</h2>

<p class="first">IT was at five o'clock that Mrs. Finch's
parlourmaid, when passing Violet's door, caught the click of a
key being turned in a lock inside the room, and then of a drawer
pulled open. That would be Violet's big wardrobe trunk, she
decided. Violet would never open the room door when that trunk
was unlocked, she had noticed, so, with a malicious grin on her
pert face, the maid tapped on it.</p>

<p>"Would you like any tea, madam?" she asked through it
solicitously. As on other occasions, there was no reply except
the turning-on of water into the fitted basin. This was Violet's
well-known little trick when she wanted to pretend that she had
not heard the knocking. The maid did not venture to knock again.
Had Mrs. Arthur Walsh wanted tea she would have ordered it. And
with an amused smile at the vexation that she was sure that she
had caused, Gwendolyn went on down to the servants' hall.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later the front-door bell rang. Answering it,
she found Ronald Mills on the doorstep. He had a latch-key and
generally used it; but he had forgotten it, he explained.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Walsh in, Gwennie?" he asked. "If so, I'd like to
welcome her home from her honeymoon."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She's up in her bedroom." The maid tripped upstairs
to deliver the message, but came down again in a minute to say
that Miss Violet, or rather Mrs. Walsh, must have just gone out.
"She was in, I know, not ten minutes ago," she added.</p>

<p>"Nuisance!" Mills said. "The fact is, Gwen, my dear, I wanted
to get a hint for my belated wedding present. What do you think
Mrs. Walsh would like best?"</p>

<p>Gwendolyn meditated. "Every lady likes a nice bit of
jewellery," she hazarded finally.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I want to get something that she and Mr.
Walsh can both use."</p>

<p>"What about' something for the table?" she suggested. "Cut
glass. You can never have too much cut glass. Much more genteel
than silver, to my mind."</p>

<p>Mills said that he would look up Walsh himself and see if he
could get his ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>"He might be at their house now being done up in Grosvenor
Square," the parlourmaid suggested. "Just by chance, like. Or at
one of his clubs."</p>

<p>"I'll try the house first. Might just catch them both there.
Good idea, Gwennie!" And going farther into the hall, Mills
promptly lifted down the telephone.</p>

<p>Walsh answered, and Mills asked if he might come along for a
word or two.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" Arthur's tone was not pressing, but Mills jumped
into his car and drove over at once.</p>

<p>Arthur met him civilly enough in the big drawing-room on the
first floor, which looked very bare and smelled very much of
fresh paint.</p>

<p>"I want to get some little trifle for a wedding present that
will please both of you," Mills explained as they shook hands.
"It was through me that you and Violet first met, really. I just
missed her in Ennismore Gardens." He explained about his calling
there for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Arthur said at once that he would prefer it to be something
for Violet alone.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what?" Mills urged. Then he caught sight of a recess
in which a hidden light lit up a large piece of Chinese
plate.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty bit of colour," he said admiringly. He had a
good eye for colour, and walked over to examine it closely.</p>

<p>Arthur kept step with him, glancing covertly at his watch as
he did so. "When did the maid think Vi would be back?" he asked.
But Mills only shook his head, and going up to the china cabinet
he began to talk very knowledgeably of its exhibited contents.
Mills knew a good deal about china. He knew a good deal about
everything that you might possibly buy cheap and sell dear.
Arthur's chill manner softened.</p>

<p>"Look at this bit," he said, taking a key from his pocket and
unlocking the cabinet. "Here's a nice little piece that I found
quite by chance." He held up the cup.</p>

<p>Mills was enthusiastic, but he did not take it in his hands.
"I sometimes drop things," he explained with a half laugh. "But I
don't think that it's Kang He, all the same..."</p>

<p>Arthur did and they argued the pros and cons stubbornly. Each
stuck to his own contention. Arthur had a book in the library
that would settle the dispute, and he went down to the ground
floor to fetch it. He found it and the passage he wanted and was
just about to take the book up to Mills when the telephone rang
shrilly. Mills also heard it and saw one instrument on the mantel
beside him&mdash;not yet again hidden in its ornamental shell. It
was evidently an extension of the one below in the library.</p>

<p>Mills lifted it off very quietly. He heard Arthur Walsh's
voice saying: "This is No. 300 Grosvenor Square. Who's
speaking?"</p>

<p>For a second there was no reply. Arthur thought he had been
cut off, and was just about to replace the receiver when he heard
a voice say urgently: "You are to gome at vunce to Stanley Mews.
Mrs. Valsh says so. She has left the doors of the house and the
flat unlocked. The segond-floor flat. She is there. Gome to her
at vunce!" There was a click as of a receiver hung up.</p>

<p>Arthur stood waiting a moment, but nothing more came. "You've
cut me off!" he said sharply in a tone of protesting and absolute
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What number, please?" asked a girl's voice. Evidently from
the exchange.</p>

<p>"You've cut me off!" Arthur said furiously. "Sorry. What
number was it?"</p>

<p>Arthur had no idea. The instrument was dead. He hung up. The
voice had had a strong German accent, or what we call German. It
might have been Scandinavian or Danish or Czecho-Slovakian. The
delivery had been rushing, and suggested a man tremendously
excited, who had but a second in which to get his message
understood. And the message itself...</p>

<p>He ran upstairs, and Arthur rarely ran. "Stanley Mews, isn't
that where you are now living, Mills?"

<p>Mills nodded.</p>

<p>"I've had a most extraordinary message from there, apparently
from Vi!" Walsh repeated it.</p>

<p>"She must have gone there with her mother," Mills said
carelessly. "Mrs. Finch has a. key to my new digs. Well, are you
off?"</p>

<p>"Just a moment." Arthur reached for the telephone. "What's its
number?"</p>

<p>Mills gave it. "But you'll be there quicker than&mdash;" he
began. Arthur silenced him by again asking for the number. Then
he answered Mills.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Vi. It's some fool's idea of a hoax. I put one over
on a chap at my club and he swore to get his own back. Can't get
an answer." He turned questioningly to Mills. "Exchange says she
can't get any reply. That proves it's a hoax. The chap was
telephoning from my club, or his own home." Arthur hung up, and
was turning away when the door opened and a servant entered to
say that Miss Catherine Walsh was below in her car and would like
a word with Mr. Walsh.</p>

<p>"I'm here myself," said a cordial voice behind the servant.
"May I come in? The sun's too hot to exist in the street. Oh, Mr.
Mills How do you do?" Kitty appended frigidly. How excited the
two men looked. Had they been quarrelling? She knew now that any
critical touch on Violet would infallibly rouse Arthur to
fury.</p>

<p>"Where's Vi, Arthur?" she asked her cousin. "I have a
conciliatory message for her from Aunt Caroline that must be
delivered at once. For aunt asks Vi to join her in her box at
Covent Garden to-night. She's waiting impatiently for Vi's
answer, and you know Aunt Caroline. Her invitation to be
delivered 'instantly if not sooner.'" Kitty sighed. Dear Aunt
Caroline was certainly fussy.</p>

<p>"Walsh has just had what purported to be an S.O.S. from
Violet," Mills interrupted. "If so, she's now at my flat in an
obscure but conveniently cheap place called Stanley Mews. It's
over a garage owned by Mr. Gray. Well, Walsh, you'd better be off
to my said humble digs, and find out whether the phone was a hoax
or not."</p>

<p>"But what was the message?" Kitty asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was some idiot's idea of an exquisitely good hoax,"
Arthur said scornfully. "And the better to camouflage his
identity he assumed a comical German accent telling me that 'Mrs.
Walsh' wanted me to come to her at Mills's flat 'at vunce,'
before he prevented me from giving him <i>my</i> idea of a joke
by hanging up, so that I couldn't ask another question."</p>

<p>"Vi might have got some one to telephone because she has had
an accident," Kitty said uneasily, "as apparently Mrs. Finch was
not with her to do it."</p>

<p>"Good God, what an awful thought!" Arthur jumped up from the
chair into which he had flung himself. "I must get there
instantly! Don't you come, Kitty," as she moved to go with him.
"It's a hoax, I feel sure&mdash;one of Eastcastle's choicest. But
still, your notion&mdash;Hurry, Mills, if you're coming as guide.
That'll do me a good turn, as I don't know the place. My car's
round the corner."</p>

<p>He kept his finger on the bell and ordered the man to bring
his car round at once. "You cut along back to Aunt Caroline," he
said kindly to his cousin; but Kitty utterly refused to be left
behind for any minutes of doubt, and they all bundled into
Arthur's waiting car. He stepped on the accelerator almost at
once, too, with a pressure that belied his assurances to Kitty,
and verbally to himself, that the phone-call could be nothing but
a hoax.</p>

<p><br>"Yes, Chief Inspector Pointer speaking," said a calm voice
at Scotland Yard in response to an agitated one coming through
the telephone beside him. Seated at his office table though the
speaker was, it could be seen that he was at least six feet in
height, with a bronzed clean-shaven face that conveyed assurances
of high intelligence and authority. The eyes were deep grey under
finely drawn brows, dark brown like the lashes. The chin square,
the lips looked equally capable of stern reserve or geniality.
And when he presently moved and rose, his lean frame did so with
the lithe unhurried swiftness of a powerful athlete at the acme
of fitness. An unexpectedly young man, too, was this Chief
Inspector Pointer; still, for all his professional renown, well
under middle age. Unmistakably, even at a glance, a man of brains
and formidable qualifications as a crime detective.</p>

<p>He listened intently, and then said quietly but with sharp
conciseness: "Been dead some hours, you think. Of course you'll
lock the door and guard it well from any intrusion whatsoever, or
by any one, any <i>one</i> whomsoever until I get there. How
about the window or windows? They look to the front, you say, and
another constable is watching them and the entrance to the house.
Good!"</p>

<p>Pointer hung up the phone, quickly but neatly tidied his
papers, weighted them, rolled down the self-locking top of his
writing-table, and went with long light steps down to a plain but
notably efficient dark-green car standing ready for him in the
inner courtyard of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The call had a quite special interest for him because the
young woman reported murdered in a little flat in Stanley Mews
was said to be the daughter of the notorious Mrs. Finch of the
Little Owls night-clubs, about which such constant complaints
used to reach the police. There might be no connection, but it
was odd that it should be her daughter...and that the owner of
the flat where the body had been found was the stepfather of the
dead woman.</p>

<p>The garage was run by a manager, a man called Cook, who bore a
very good reputation indeed. As did Mr. Gray, for that matter.
The manager was an ex-Service man who had risen to be a captain
in the War but who sensibly called himself plain "Mister"
nowadays. Cook was on the look-out for the Yard car. He stepped
forward to the kerb at once and greeted Pointer warmly.</p>

<p>"Why on my premises, Mr. Pointer?" he asked plaintively. "Why
not her own home? Or one of those gay and giddy clubs her mother
used to run? The entrance is round the corner for the upper
floors."</p>

<p>"Do they belong to your place too?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>Cook nodded. "Three floors let to three gents. Luckily two are
out at the moment. There's enough of a mob in there as it is.
Girl's young husband, raving mad. Girl's best friend fainting in
the corner and it is a nasty sight, even for you, Chief
Inspector. Tenant of the flat doing the splits all round to get
the police&mdash;me&mdash;you&mdash;and all the
world&mdash;here."</p>

<p>A second car had followed Pointer's and now drew up. Several
men slipped out and waited. Cook, the garage manager, showed the
way round the corner to a side door, out of sight from the garage
itself, which was used by the occupiers of the upper floors.</p>

<p>On the doorstep stood Arthur Walsh, looking distraught.</p>

<p>"That's her husband," Cook whispered. "It's his wife that's
murdered, and I thought we should need a strait-jacket."</p>

<p>Beside him was Ronald Mills. He, too, was white and shaken-looking. Pointer saw him turn and say something to a young girl
dimly visible in the lobby behind him; for the front door was
ajar.</p>

<p>Pointer <i>was</i> introduced by Cook, and Walsh said thickly:
"Get the man who did it, superintendent, and you'll have a friend
in me all my life!"</p>

<p>Mills said nothing except: "Shall I go up with you? They're my
rooms. Unfortunately&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can this young lady go home? It's been an awful shock for
her," Cook asked Pointer in an aside. "It's a Miss Walsh&mdash;a
cousin of his&mdash;" He nodded towards Arthur.</p>

<p>Pointer looked down into Kitty's face, as white as her
organdie frock. The frock was as spotless as the snow-white elbow
gloves. Not the frock for a murder, and not&mdash;by a long
way&mdash;the face for a murderess either. Traits never seen in
the face of a criminal were there: candour and sweetness and
horrified pity. Violence of deed or word would be impossible to
this young girl; though she now looked shattered by poignantly
deep sympathy.</p>

<p>"I'll see her as soon as it's possible," Pointer assented
gently. "Perhaps there's a room she can wait in?"</p>

<p>"There's my own room by the door, if you'll excuse its
disorder," Cook said, opening it.</p>

<p>Kitty thanked them both with white lips and sat down by a
table. There were two other doors in the passage. A back one
leading into the garage, another one leading down the stairs to
the kitchen offices.</p>

<p>"What are you delaying for?" Arthur Walsh demanded harshly,
his face working. "She's up there! <i>Murdered!</i> My
Violet!..."</p>

<p>"Shall I come up again?" Mills asked.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded, asked the manager to stop with Miss Walsh, and
followed Mills up the stairs, Arthur hard on his heels. Four of
the men from the Yard, who had come in the second car, followed
them in <i>a</i> compact group.</p>

<p>The constable standing guard outside the locked door upstairs
was sent down to help Cook keep a kindly but vigilant eye on Miss
Walsh's shocked state.</p>

<p>Before stepping in through the front door of the flat, Pointer
glanced up and down the narrow stairs. Its door was out of sight
from the door above, or the door below. The linoleum that covered
the landing looked neat and clean; no marks to suggest <i>a</i>
crime appeared on it. The door into the flat was varnished and
it, too, showed no marks on it. It opened directly into the
sitting-room; a fairly large and quite comfortable room. This was
the front room. The back room opening out of it had been divided
into a small bedroom and a tiny bathroom. These made up the whole
of the floor&mdash;and the flat.</p>

<p>In the front room before the fireplace lay the dead body of a
young woman, apparently a lady. She was lying in the oddly
shortened, crumpled-up way in which a body falls when it drops
where it had been standing. The whole top of the head was a
horrible sight. At least three terrific blows had been struck on
it; any one of which must have caused instant death. On the
mantel, almost over her head, was a modernist figure made from a
flexible strip of steel with a steel head fastened to one end.
The steel feet at the other end had been cast solidly in one with
a thick square base of the same metal. Lifting it up with his
gloves on, Pointer saw the red outline of the base on the marble.
The green felt gummed to the base was a welter of blood.</p>

<p>One of his men tested it for fingerprints. It showed none.
Then Pointer grasped it by the head and found what a terrible
weapon it then became. The four metal corners of the inch-thick
heavy steel base became so many steel axes. The flexible strip
gave a powerful spring to the whole. A mere child could kill with
it. But the child, Pointer reflected, would have had to know its
fell weight. For it looked light, almost fragile.</p>

<p>Meantime Arthur Walsh had pushed roughly past Pointer and
fallen unrestrainably down on his knees beneath the body. "Vi!
Vi, my darling!" he agonisedly implored it, and would have turned
the face up had not Pointer raised him, instead, to his feet.</p>

<p>"You'll only hinder us that way, sir," he said kindly but
warningly. "Tell me in as few words as possible how this
happened."</p>

<p>"But I haven't an idea," Arthur exclaimed with staring wild
eyes. "In God's name tell me, inspector
What&mdash;has&mdash;happened?" he asked in choking tones of
blank horror.</p>

<p>Pointer suggested that the distraught husband should go
downstairs and wait for him there. Arthur Walsh stared at him,
stared at the dreadful body of his young wife, and stumbled out
of the room, Mills beside him.</p>

<p>On the hearth-rug just in front of the body were some torn-up
scraps of paper. Pointer turned to his photographer: "I want a
close-up of those papers too," he ordered, although as far as
could be seen there was no writing on any of the bits.</p>

<p>While this was being done, Pointer stepped out on the landing
and looked interrogatively at the constable, who saluted again
and said rapidly:</p>

<p>"I was on my regular beat just round the corner from here,
sir, at a quarter to six, all but, when the gentleman who's in
the room behind you came rushing round the corner; and after him
Mr. Cook, that I know quite well. The first one caught hold of my
arm and gasped 'Murder!' And then Mr. Cook ran up and told me
that a young lady had been brutally killed in one of the little
flats over his garage. I turned to the entrance, and there was
the gentleman who's just now stumbled down the stairs, and a
young lady with him. They were beckoning madly to me from the top
step. I looked at my watch and noted that it was just a quarter
to six as I entered the front door, and followed the gentleman
and the young lady who had been beckoning to me, and had waited
for me on the top step. I found the body in there, quite dead and
fairly cool to the touch. I didn't disturb it in any way, sir, of
course; only touched the back of one of her hands. Then I blew my
whistle gently, and when P.C. 2479 got here a minute later I sent
him out to watch the house and immediately phoned to you, sir. A
moment after that P.C. 9641 hurried up and I stationed him to
watch the back of the premises."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>

Chief Inspector Pointer Gets to Work.</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER went on downstairs. He wanted to send
Kitty home as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Please tell me, Miss Walsh, just how you came to be here, and
exactly what you found had happened here. I am very sorry to ask
you for these facts, but I must. You gentlemen would wait
outside," he added to the two men who had kept silently
sympathetic company with her.</p>

<p>Alone with him, Kitty fixed on him a look of anguished horror
as she answered faintly but bravely:</p>

<p>"I came thinking it might be a joke&mdash;the message, I mean,
asking my cousin to come to her here at once...Mr. Mills was with
him and we all three came, expecting my cousin, Arthur Walsh, as
he quite believed, the intended victim of a stupid hoax or
practical joke. My cousin suspected a booby trap, and went in
first. But he gave an awful cry&mdash;a cry&mdash;" Kitty
unconsciously put her hands again over her ears at its
remembrance. Would she ever forget that cry of Arthur's, like the
scream of a mortally stricken animal?</p>

<p>Pointer decided to ask her only one more question now. Since
"we" meant the two others outside, presumably he could cover the
ground without her help.</p>

<p>"You saw no one about, and heard no other sound in the flat?"
he asked gently.</p>

<p>Kitty had not; and she was helped into a summoned taxi and
driven back at once to her own people.</p>

<p>Then Pointer heard again, from its semi-dazed recipient
himself, the bewildering phoned summons that finally&mdash;Arthur
explained briefly&mdash;brought him incredulously to where the
awful reality awaited him instead of the grotesque hoax he had
intended to "properly pay off." And Pointer got him to write out
for him the message exactly as it had sounded with its foreign
pronunciation. As nearly as he could now time it, Arthur said, he
had heard the last, suddenly cut-off word just before five-thirty.</p>

<p>Pointer let him off from further torture&mdash;as his
questions visibly inflicted it&mdash;as soon as his duty could,
permit.</p>

<p>Cook, the garage manager, confirmed events. Mills had called
him up on the house phone and he had found everything as already
recited, and the murdered girl's half-crazed young husband
fondling her shockingly struck-down form with wild caresses and
appeals to his murdered wife to speak to him, look at him. It was
an awful scene. The time, then, nearly quarter to six. He and
Mills had forcibly dragged him away; telling Walsh he "must not
move or touch" her before the police could see everything. At
least Cook had; and Mills, on his urging, had helped him.
"Besides," he added, "the barest glance made it only too sure
that there was, could be, no spark of life in the poor
thing."</p>

<p>Asking the husband to come in again, Pointer got from him a
spate of distracted details. "Who phoned to me from here? Chief
inspector, I shall go quite out of my mind unless you can tell me
that. It's what I'd give my life to know! Was it the murderer I
heard? Did he want to get at me by killing her? Was that why he
told me I was wanted? Or did she need me, and had she really
asked the speaker to give me that message...what I mean&mdash;"
Walsh thrust out a hand that shook. "What I mean is, was some
foreigner there? And had she really asked for that message to be
sent me at once, and did the fool bungle it? Or was he by some
means prevented from sending it until it was too late? The voice
sounded as though he were in a frightful rush. I thought at the
time, too&mdash;but, like the besotted fool that I was, thought
it part of the hoax&mdash;that the speaker didn't want to be
overheard, yet wanted to be very sure that I got the message all
right."</p>

<p>Pointer's cool but not unkindly eyes took stock of the
emotion-swept face before him Yes, the young man was making
strenuous efforts to be precise, he thought; was seeking to put
into words the feelings roused by that strange, and under the
circumstances, dreadful appeal; made apparently on behalf of his
murdered young wife. And made in vain.</p>

<p>"<i>Would</i> it have saved her, do you think, if I had gone
immediately&mdash;got here at once?" Arthur asked in agonised
tones.</p>

<p>Pointer could not say. He was sorry for the terrible tension
in those questions.</p>

<p>"Had you ever heard the voice before, do you think?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Never, so far as I know. And yet, somehow, there's a beastly
feeling that I ought to have," Arthur muttered thickly.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean?" Pointer asked with interest.</p>

<p>Walsh made a sort of swimming motion with his out-thrown
hands. "I don't know," he said wearily. "It's just that. Just a
vague impression that I really ought to know that voice. But I
can't express it. It's just a feeling...and I wasn't conscious
even of that until you asked me."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Mills?" Pointer turned now to the man who, with
a very wooden face, stood a little behind the other. "What time
did you leave your flat?"</p>

<p>"I left here on Friday last. I've been staying down at
Maidenhead with Mrs. Finch&mdash;that's Mrs. Walsh's
mother&mdash;I'm her partner more or less, unfortunately, in
those Little Owls clubs of hers that have gone bust. She needed
some papers she had left 'in her house in Ennismore Gardens. I
rushed up for them and got to her house about quarter-past five.
The parlourmaid thought Mrs. Walsh was in. Said she had just
heard her in her bedroom. But she must have just gone out, the
maid came back to tell me."</p>

<p>"If Mrs. Walsh was seen at a quarter-past five by the
parlourmaid, it's very important," Pointer said slowly.</p>

<p>"A bit after the quarter-past possibly," Mills said on
thinking back. "But I didn't really notice the time. I had
intended, besides getting the papers, to find out what she would
like as a belated wedding present. I thought she might be at
Grosvenor Square. Or, if not, that Walsh might be there; so I
phoned there, found that he was, and went round. And while I was
talking to him Walsh received that mysterious message over his
house phone.</p>

<p>"Miss Kitty Walsh also happened in just then, for a word with
Mrs. Walsh, and we all three came along together. We found the
door unlocked as the message had said&mdash;and found Mrs. Walsh
dead As the message had certainly not said. Look here, chief
inspector, they've told me over the phone that Mrs. Finch has
left the solicitor's office at Maidenhead; but even so I think I
can find her. I know where she's likely to go and where
not...Have you any objections if I rush off for her in my
car?"</p>

<p>In reply to further questions Mills said he had given up his
clubs for economy's sake; but he would go to the Westmorland
Hotel for the time being, supposing he could get a room there.
Anyhow he would ring up and let Pointer know where he could be
found, since his flat was in the hands of the police.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir.. But now before you go, will you take a very
careful look over your flat and let me know if anything is
missing, so far as you can detect; or if anything has had its
position shifted since you noticed it last. Or if anything has
been added? I want you carefully to observe these points; but
without touching things at all."</p>

<p>Pointer walked through the rooms with Mills, who said in a
moment that the little steel figure had been standing in the
centre of the mantel as usual, when he last saw it. It did not
belong to him. It was in the flat when he took it furnished. A
few things of his own had been added; but, as he said, not that
horribly used steel article.</p>

<p>Mills was allowed to drive off after that. Pointer noticed
that he took a curt farewell of Walsh, who apparently did not
hear it as he stood staring straight before him with a set rigid
look on his face.</p>

<p>The doctor had not yet arrived, so Pointer had Cook also go
over the flat with him, to see if anything was noticeably altered
in it. Cook could not be certain, as he did not go much into the
rooms. But as far as he could say, the only striking difference
was "in respect of the ornamental steel figure, which had played
so dreadful a part in the tragedy." For he had himself placed it
on the very middle of the mantelshelf. And when he had chanced to
be in the sitting-room of the flat for a moment on Thursday last
he had seen it still where he had put it. The figure was all
steel; and Mr. Gray, who owned it, had told him that it
represented the "Genius of Machinery." Gray valued it
but&mdash;although it looked so light and fragile&mdash;it was
really so heavy, and so awkward to handle, that Gray, who used to
have it in his office downstairs, had wished it to be kept in the
furnished flat let off above.</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Gray often there?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Not much, just now," was the reply. "His works are at Hendon,
where he is busy with a new engine that he is putting on the
market shortly." Cook then went on to speak of the tenants in the
house. The first floor was let to a doctor who had had it for
three years. Cook gave him a very good reputation: quiet,
studious, giving no trouble whatever. The second floor had been
let about six months ago to the Mr. Ronald Mills who just left.
Mills had come there from a very smart suite house by the Park.
"He seems right enough," continued Cook, "but he's mixed up in
the Little Owls night-clubs; so you never know." The top floor
was let to an elderly newspaper man who was "away on some
journalism stunt nine-tenths of the time, and is away on one now,
I fancy. He, too, is a permanent tenant," added the garage
manager, "and a thoroughly good sort; a reliable steady chap." As
to front door, each tenant had a latch-key, of course. "Mr. Gray?
Oh, probably, yes. He may still have his old one; but he has no
use for it, if so. He only comes occasionally for a word of
business about the garage, or some repairs to the house. And in
that last case he just pops up to see what is wanted, and we go
over the accounts afterwards."</p>

<p>Cook was needed in the garage at this moment; and the doctor
now came in. He had been delayed by a street accident. At sight
of the horribly battered head he frowned as he bent over it.
"Hatred here, surely," he ejaculated. "The first blow killed her.
The two others were sheer fury, or nerves." His eye followed
Pointer's to the steel object that had done it.</p>

<p>"May I lift the thing?" he asked.</p>

<p>Pointer assented. He said that it had been thoroughly tested
for fingerprints, but none had been anywhere on it.</p>

<p>Gloves on, Doctor Ward-Bentley lifted the figure, held it by
the head and whipped it through the air, looking meaningly at
Pointer and then at the green baize on the bottom of its
stand.</p>

<p>"That's the weapon, eh? And a more deadly little springboard I
never handled. One tap "&mdash;he gestured to the crushed-in head
of the victim. "Given this, those successive blows may have been
sheer ignorance. I mean that the murderer may have had no
conception of the result that would follow one blow, and so have
struck those savagely unnecessary blows to make sure that she
could never speak."</p>

<p>He agreed with the chief inspector that the dead young woman
had been standing&mdash;probably smoking a cigarette since one
lay just beyond her hand&mdash;and had been struck down from the
side. In other words, some one had come up beside her, snatched
up the steel figure on the mantel, and suddenly brought it down
with full force on her head. The murderer had either been taller
than the young woman, or she had been bending slightly down for
something. As to when she had been killed, the doctor could only
say that it was at least an hour ago and he would not be
surprised to learn that it was two hours ago, now. But not more,
he thought.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Gentleman asks to see you, sir&mdash;" the constable began,
"and begs for a word with Chief Inspector Pointer if he will
forgive the intrusion at Mr. Walsh's request." The said gentleman
being one Sewell, by name: "Victor Sewell, to be quite explicit,"
said a pleasant voice over the constable's shoulder before the
owner of the voice came forward to meet Pointer's outstretched
hand in a cordial clasp.</p>

<p>For Pointer knew the young man quite well, and had no little
esteem for both his personal and his professional character; more
particularly since his brilliantly successful clearing of a great
name from undeserved calumny.</p>

<p>"Walsh is outside," the caller said in a low tone. "Mayn't he
come in? I think it might be a boon to him if he thought that he
was helping you on to the murderer's trail. He only married the
poor girl a week ago." Pointer had no objection whatever. The
other way round. It had been only for Walsh's own sake
that&mdash;for the moment&mdash;he had left him on one side as
much as possible. Sewell explained how he himself had been
professionally brought into the case; how, immediately the police
had been summoned, Walsh had got Cook to phone for Sewell
also.</p>

<p>On being shown the murdered young wife of his friend, the
Private Investigator was profoundly shocked. For, as he told
Pointer, she had been his charming hostess at lunch only a couple
of hours before. His sympathy was, therefore, deeper even than
Pointer's when, on being allowed in again, Arthur chokingly asked
to be left alone with his dead bride until the stretcher-bearers
came to take her away.</p>

<p>But Violet Walsh's remains belonged now to the investigations
of Scotland Yard. And her unhappy husband had to be told that a
constable must remain in the room. With this necessary proviso,
however, Arthur was left alone with his dead until the stretcher
arrived. And meantime Sewell went into fuller details of the
mysteriously exchanged pearl necklace, repeating to Pointer all
that poor Violet had herself dilated on at luncheon.</p>

<p>"She told you she always wore the longer string?" Pointer
said. "She hasn't it on here. She is wearing no necklace, as you
see."</p>

<p>"Might she have dropped the string into her handbag?" queried
Sewell.</p>

<p>"She seems to have no handbag, or what advertisements call a
'pochette,' along with her. That looks as though she had come in
a car where she might have left it. Her shoes suggest a car, too.
It's a very dusty day and they are quite fresh-looking. She has
apparently not worn gloves, either. But I haven't had a thorough
search made yet."</p>

<p>At this moment the bearers arrived with the stretcher and
Violet Walsh's body was borne away. Simultaneously with the
closing of the house door behind it Arthur seemed&mdash;with a
shuddering deep breath&mdash;to resolutely shut the door of his
will upon his private emotions, as he turned to Sewell, saying:
"For God's sake, give me some active work to do, <i>if</i> it's
only fetching and carrying on the trail of her murderer There
must be some link between those exchanged pearls and her
death!"</p>

<p>He made a sweeping gesture and wheeled to face the chief
inspector. Their eyes met, and Pointer wondered if the same
suspicion that was coursing among others in his own brain had
suddenly entered Walsh's, as the latter exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Our talk at luncheon must have made Vi think of
something&mdash;recall something&mdash;connected with these
rooms. She came here to discover something! Who was here? Who let
her in? Who phoned that message to me? I've a ghastly notion,
chief inspector, that it was the very man that killed her! But if
so why?&mdash;<i>why</i>...?"</p>

<p>He dropped heavily into a chair and covered his wild eyes with
his hands. After a moment's silence Pointer asked him if Mrs.
Walsh usually carried a purse or handkerchief bag. "Always," was
Arthur's instant reply. "She never went out of the house without
it. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because," Pointer answered, "no such article has yet been
found in the room. If she had one with her it has either been
removed or very effectively hidden up to now."</p>

<p>He had already had the bloodstained hearth-rug taken away. The
papers that had been lying around Violet's body had also been
collected by one of his men and now lay on the table as they had
been photographed. They were all blank, but Pointer, too, only
handled them with rubber gloves on.</p>

<p>Walsh shook his head when asked if he had seen any papers like
them. Staying as they were in Mrs. Finch's house until their own
could be redecorated&mdash;he never called Violet's mother
anything but "Mrs. Finch"&mdash;he could not say. But he stared
at the blank white fragments in perplexity.</p>

<p>Pointer soon after discovered the missing little
handbag&mdash;stuffed far down at the back of the seat of an
upholstered arm-chair. So far down, thrust so deeply, that it
might easily have failed altogether to be found.</p>

<p>"Vi never did that!" Arthur exclaimed sharply, as he saw the
inspector dig it out.</p>

<p>Sewell and Pointer were not so sure&mdash;as a glance which
the former shot at the impassive Scotland Yard man said. Mrs.
Walsh might have felt herself in danger...might have hidden there
some valuable clue...Sewell's heart beat faster at the
thought.</p>

<p>Pointer carefully emptied the little bag on to a sheet of
paper and Sewell jotted down the items. A gold vanity case with
powder "compact" rouge, lipstick, and eyebrow pencil&mdash;in it.
A purse with some change in it and a couple of pound notes...a
handkerchief. That was all.</p>

<p>Arthur stared at it with straining eyes. "Her bag...! We
bought it together...! It's a nightmare&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Walsh," Sewell urged insistently. "Go down to your
house in the country. You can't help&mdash;really. And it's only
tearing your heart afresh for nothing. We'll ring you up&mdash;or
I'll dash down there&mdash;the first moment you can be of any
use. What do you say, chief inspector?"</p>

<p>"I think it a good idea. Is Colonel Walsh in the country?"</p>

<p>"He's up in Town," Arthur said indifferently.</p>

<p>"At his Club?" Pointer pressed. "We would like to spare you
from having to break the news," he explained in compassionate
tones.</p>

<p>"Probably," was all Arthur knew as to that last question.</p>

<p>Pointer just glanced at Sewell, who went to the telephone in
the lobby&mdash;to try the In and Out for Colonel Walsh.</p>

<p>"I won't detain you but a moment longer, Mr. Walsh," Pointer
added, "but I must ask you about Mrs. Walsh's plans for the
afternoon."</p>

<p>Arthur said that she had spoken at lunch of an afternoon with
her dressmaker. She intended to fit herself out completely:
country frocks, town afternoon frocks, evening things. She meant
to be thorough, she had said, so as to be quite free afterwards.
He gave the name of the House in question. Pointer knew it as an
establishment where a woman could easily while away a whole day,
let alone an afternoon. Arthur said that she had intended to drop
in at Grosvenor Square as soon as she got free, as they were
doing up the large drawing-room and some of the bedrooms, and she
particularly wanted to see the effect of the tints that she had
chosen. He himself had driven his wife to Bruton Street, and then
gone on to Grosvenor Square. That would have been about three
o'clock, he thought. He had had a good many letters to answer,
and sat writing and glancing through estimates for new wine
vaults until Mills was shown in at a little before half-past
five. Mills said he would wait for Mrs. Walsh if he wasn't in the
way. "We talked about&mdash;" Arthur said vaguely.</p>

<p>"About&mdash;?" Pointer questioned as to the subject.</p>

<p>For a moment Arthur could not remember, then it came to
him:</p>

<p>"Some china I had in a cabinet. I looked up a book on Chinese
Ceramics to prove a point, and was reading it when the telephone
rang. I felt sure it was from my wife, glanced at the clock, and
picked up the instrument." He repeated that to the best of his
belief the time had been just before the half-hour. Mills, he
thought, had been with him only three or four minutes then. He
went again over his certainty that it was Lord East-castle's idea
of a joke, the arrival of his cousin, and her startling
suggestion that the message might have been genuine, their drive
to the Mews&mdash;and&mdash;Here he stopped dead.</p>

<p>Pointer thanked him, endorsed the suggestion that he go down
to their place in the country, and with Sewell's help finally got
him into his car. One of Pointer's men got in beside Arthur and
took the wheel&mdash;for he was obviously in no state to drive
even a perambulator, they all agreed.</p>

<p>But he would, of course, be "shadowed" everywhere and
unremittingly until Scotland Yard's problem&mdash;who murdered
Violet Walsh?&mdash;should be effectively solved. Nothing and no
one could prevent that. The kindly probabilities were, however,
that Arthur himself would remain unconscious of any "shadow"
other than that of his own obsessing concern.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Walsh," Pointer paused in shutting the door
of the car to add, "can you remember if by chance Mr. Mills had
his gloves on if he handled anything from your Chinese cabinet
when you and he were discussing its contents. We have to list all
fingerprints connected in any way with the case, you know and if
Mr. Mills left his on a piece of china it would save us troubling
him for another print."</p>

<p>"I seem to recall that he kept his left glove on. But I don't
remember if he handled any piece," Arthur said with a visible
effort to recall the scene. His face suddenly flushed, and he
leaned forward as if to say something else, or ask some eager
question. Then his previous look of absolutely exhausted emotion
and consequent blank apathy swept over it again, and he closed
his eyes wearily as he leaned back. The man at the wheel, at a
slight indication from Pointer as he firmly shut the door,
started up the car, which at once sped its forlorn-looking
occupant out of sight.</p>

<p>"I thought you were getting Mills' fingerprints when you
handed him your sketch of his rooms and got him to initial it as
correct," Sewell remarked with an inquiring look at the chief
inspector.</p>

<p>"I was," Pointer agreed dryly.</p>

<p>"So you simply wanted, just now, to learn about his gloves?
Useful detail! Especially as I noticed their absence."</p>

<p>"Yes, he had slipped them inside his waistcoat, I saw,"
Pointer said with one of his characteristically undecipherable
smiles.</p>

<p>Sewell shot a silent glance at him, but Pointer was studying
his shoe tips until he looked up to ask if Sewell had located
Colonel Walsh. Sewell had not. The Colonel had lunched at the
Army and Navy alone, but left there. And its hall-porter could
only say that Colonel Walsh had not reserved a room there for the
night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>

A Key-Ring Is Missed.</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER picked up his hat and, after a word with
the sergeant whom he left in charge, made a move towards his own
car.</p>

<p>"Where to?" Sewell asked. "I'm Mary's little lamb, you
know."</p>

<p>"I must try for the whereabouts of the necklace. Did you
notice the absence from the murdered woman's handbag of an item
that one would have quite expected to find in it?"</p>

<p>Sewell shook his head. "No, I missed nothing&mdash;and so
evidently I missed something important. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Her keys," Pointer replied. "Yet the very valuable larger
pearl necklace isn't on her, nor with her. The keys may have been
taken out when her handbag was forced down out of sight and
almost out of touch in that chair."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you're so sure that she herself didn't thrust
it there," Sewell said. At least some half-dozen good reasons why
Mrs. Walsh might well have done so were in his own mind.</p>

<p>"There are a few small drops of dried blood on one side of the
bag," Pointer said, "as though it had been lying not far from her
when she was struck down. The drops had dried where they lighted,
which suggests that either the murderer overlooked their evidence
or trusted that it would not be discovered, or hoped to regain
the bag when he could safely destroy it."</p>

<p>Sewell drew a long breath. He had never worked on a capital
charge before. In a sense he was not doing so here. For his sole
province was the clearing of Violet Walsh's reputation from the
charge of her having criminally raised money on a necklace which
she knew to be fraudulent.</p>

<p>"You know," Sewell said as he lighted a fresh cigarette,
"going by faces, I should expect young Mrs. Walsh to have always
locked her jewels up with extreme care."</p>

<p>Pointer cocked an inquiring eye at him as he, too, lit up.</p>

<p>"I lunched with her&mdash;them&mdash;you know. And&mdash;well,
I should expect her to look sharply after her possessions. It was
indicated in her face. Her mouth, for instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Looked locked-up, too?" Pointer suggested with a twinkle.</p>

<p>Sewell nodded. "It did! 'Secretive,' I tabulated her. But with
such high spirits and 'go' that I could quite see how a rather
cold fish like Walsh would be seized by the&mdash;the&mdash;" He
groped for the right word to exactly express his meaning.</p>

<p>"Gulf Stream?" Pointer tentatively supplied. And Sewell nodded
his thanks for its fitness.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Of her temperament," he went on. "The zest of her
honeymoon was vivid in Walsh's gay young bride, then. And now
she's dust and ashes; or will be in a short time!" Sewell was
evidently deeply moved by the sudden tragedy into which he had
been personally drawn.</p>

<p>"Was that her usual manner, I wonder?" Pointer queried aloud.
"Or was she keyed up about something...expecting
something&mdash;good or ill?"</p>

<p>"I'm handicapped by never having met her before. But if she
was just as usual, she was certainly dashed amusing company,"
Sewell said. "Not witty, let alone brilliant. Nothing of that
mentality. Just chock full of high spirits. She laughed
contagiously at the smallest jest."</p>

<p>A constable came up to Pointer as the two were getting into
the Yard car. "There's a gentleman here, sir, name of Walsh, too,
just stepped into the garage. Wears a clergyman's collar and asks
for a word with yourself."</p>

<p>Pointer went round to the garage door at once. Ambrose
Walsh&mdash;Father Walsh&mdash;was there. Pointer, who had not
before met him, was struck by the intense pallor of his face and
his air of aloofness.</p>

<p>"I happened to be in one of the houses opposite," began
Ambrose in his charming voice, "teaching a little blind boy his
religious lessons." He handed his card to Pointer. "And when I
came out just now and asked the reason for the crowd over here I
was variously informed that there had been 'a death,' 'a murder,'
'a suicide...' The name attached to each of these versions was
'Mrs. Walsh.' Now, there is a Mrs. Walsh who is a connection of
mine by marriage..." He looked inquiringly at Pointer.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arthur Walsh is the lady's name, sir," Pointer said. And
Father Ambrose was tensely silent for a full minute before he
said quietly, "That is the name of my family connection. Is her
husband here by any chance?"</p>

<p>Pointer explained a little, a very restricted little, of the
tragedy. Ambrose listened with the close attention to be
expected, while his pallor grew still more noticeable.</p>

<p>"Did you know the murdered lady well&mdash;may I ask, sir?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I met her once. Before her marriage," was the reply. "Have
you any theory, chief inspector, as to the motive for the crime?
Or is it out of order to ask that question yet, if at all?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked at the speaker attentively. He appreciated the
force of the personality confronting him. But besides
that&mdash;as he looked into the dark resolute eyes on a level
with his own, and he himself was well over six feet&mdash;he was
conscious of a curious sensation as though a thick wall of ice or
crystal were between himself and the priest. Something that
neither he nor any man could pass through, except by the will of
the other.</p>

<p>"May I ask exactly where you were visiting, sir, when you saw
the crowd?" he asked instead of replying.</p>

<p>"Around the corner here is another garage, on the opposite
side of the street. Over it are some tenements. I was in a room
of which the window looks into a courtyard. So that I had no idea
of this crowd&mdash;until I found it blocking my path."</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Sewell perhaps, sir?" Pointer turned towards his
companion as he asked.</p>

<p>The priest's eyes seemed to grow hooded as he slowly said that
he did, apologising formally for not having previously noticed
Sewell, with whom he shook hands.</p>

<p>"Do you also know about the matter that Walsh has asked me to
clear up?" Sewell asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Ambrose said rather curtly. "Arthur told me that he was
getting you to help him solve a mystery. Which would now appear
to be entangled in a darker mystery," he murmured in a voice that
suggested that his thoughts were elsewhere. "Strange...!"</p>

<p>"What is?" Sewell prodded.</p>

<p>"Strange that I should happen to be just across the road."</p>

<p>It is said that love cannot be hidden. And Pointer would have
supplemented that axiom by another certitude, namely, that
knowledge is equally bound to betray itself. And that the priest
had some private knowledge pertinent to the murder of Violet
Walsh, he felt certain. Of the extent or importance of that very
deliberately unavowed knowledge, Pointer could as yet form no
opinion. But he felt convinced that to Father Walsh himself it
bulked weightily. Which made Pointer force the issue by asking
with stern gravity: "Do you know anything, sir, bearing at all on
the facts of the crime or charges now under police
investigation?"</p>

<p>The priest's eyes met his as if all the blinds were down in a
house, as he said concisely: "No." Upon which monosyllabic
negative, Ambrose Walsh walked unhindered away, after a stiff
farewell nod to the two men. Unhindered, because Pointer
considered the whereabouts of the larger pearl necklace more
important than endeavouring to get through or over the barrier
with which the priestly mind was hedged around at present.</p>

<p>As Sewell and he got into Pointer's car and left the spot the
latter looked questioningly at his companion.</p>

<p>"You want me, I see, to pay for my official keep," laughed
Sewell. "About Father Walsh, for instance. Well, I really know
little of any consequence about him. He's distinctly out of my
usual line of business. He's considered, I hear, to be marked for
something high in the priesthood. But I'm inclined to think a
mischievous agent here, he's so bigoted. I have a friend, the
doctor for a couple of Convents, and, like myself, a Catholic,
from whom I gather that Father Walsh practically forbids them
taking in any Protestant children. They are jolly expensive
convents, so it isn't any case of cruel discrimination. But it's
Father Walsh's <i>ide fixe</i> that the true believer and the
false believer, or heretic, should be kept apart, for fear of the
rot spreading. I noticed, and so of course you had, chief
inspector"&mdash;Sewell gave Pointer a friendly smile&mdash;"that
he didn't refer to the murder as a 'terrible' or even a 'tragic'
affair. And I can only wonder if he sees in it something
grotesquely like 'divine providence.' He fairly raved against the
marriage, Arthur Walsh told me, when going into the pearl mystery
with me."</p>

<p>"How did he learn of the trouble about the pearls?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, the Walshes are good Catholics. So, too, is Ann Lovelace.
Probably they all go to him to confession, when he's
available."</p>

<p>"Could he tell us about knowing of it, if he had learnt of it
only in that way?" Pointer asked, though he knew the answer.</p>

<p>"No, evidently Miss Lovelace or Arthur Walsh went to him about
it as to a friend. Anyway, Arthur Walsh told me that his cousin,
Father Ambrose Walsh, knew and was fanatically against the
marriage. The Walshes are rather big fish with us. Their money,
and the fact that they were pre-reformation Catholics...A totally
different set, socially, from that of Violet Finch."</p>

<p>"Her father was a barrister, though, wasn't he?" Pointer
asked. He knew all about the Finches from the Yard's information;
but he might get some fresh news from Sewell's angle.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dublin. Mrs. Finch is a doctor's daughter. They were
bitterly poor, she says, when her first husband died, leaving her
with about seven hundred pounds in all and a baby girl, Violet
Finch, to provide for. Mrs. Finch put most of the money into the
management of a Social Club, to which she went herself. According
to her&mdash;and I fancy her boasting is founded on
fact&mdash;she doubled its membership in a month and trebled it
in a quarter. She then sold her share for twice what she had put
in, and started a night-club herself in a London cellar. It
became the first of her gold mines, those Little Owls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About which the Yard had daily complaints," Pointer
interrupted with a grim smile. "But we know of no reason why they
have quite faded out of late."</p>

<p>"Just fashion!" Sewell said sagely. "Got too popular to be
popular any longer. Her prices, too, were fantastic. It was only
while it was 'the thing' to be seen there that she could get
them. Yet once she put them down, the end was in sight.
Personally, I'm glad of it. If half the things I've heard about
her and her clubs are true, they've ruined many a young fool
between them. The gambling that went on there was
incredible."</p>

<p>"How was it, may I ask, that you never happened to meet her
daughter, Mrs. Walsh, until at to-day's lunch?"</p>

<p>"Her mother, it seems, wouldn't allow Miss Violet Finch to go
to the Clubs. At least not until the fateful night when she and
Walsh met. He told me that it was a case of love at first sight.
And real love, too, it must have been, or he wouldn't have
married into that lot. Though I have an idea that he didn't learn
just who she was until they were mutually infatuated. I suppose
she took after her father. Miss Kitty Walsh, I know, liked her.
And that's a very good recommendation indeed to my thinking."</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Walsh strike you as straightforward?" Pointer asked
next.</p>

<p>"Rather! No finesse, and not much tact, probably. But I should
think she'd be outspoken to a fault. 'Steel-true, blade straight,
The great artificer Made my mate'&mdash;that sort. Poor Walsh I
wonder what the enigma of those changed pearls will prove to be.
You know, chief inspector&mdash;Walsh's idea that his wife was
hot on the right track strikes me as quite possible. She was
distinctly the kind that&mdash;if she had come on something or
thought of something vital&mdash;would have gone straight to have
it out, face to face!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Sewell's monkey brow worked furiously. "I
suppose you know all about that chap Mills?" he burst out
finally.</p>

<p>"No," Pointer replied promptly. "Not necessarily all,' but a
good deal. He's not yet been found doing anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Apprehensible," finished Sewell with a grin.</p>

<p>"Precisely," Pointer agreed. "You always did get the right
word, I remember."</p>

<p>"And you the right man! I'm jolly glad of a chance to work
with you. I may have my own theories as we go along, but I won't
expound them until the end of this case. Then I'll own up
handsomely. And it isn't as if you needed any help from me. Nor,
for that matter, do you ever parade what you're after till you've
pretty well got your hand on it&mdash;my dear Pointer.
But&mdash;to return to our mutton&mdash;Mills is a Cambridge man,
with some quite decent family connections&mdash;for whatever
these details may seem worth, though I expect they're all already
in your bag."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said at the moment until Sewell, as usual,
said it by asking: "What do you think oddest in what we've been
told, so far, in this most extraordinary case, chief
inspector?"</p>

<p>"That telephone message to the husband," Pointer
unhesitatingly answered. And Sewell nodded his complete agreement
before&mdash;as usual&mdash;expanding the problem with perhaps
its most salient mystery: "What could have been its motive?
Personally, I can't account for it by any conceivable reason for
it."</p>

<p>"It's just possible that it was from some one who wanted to
make quite sure that Mr. Walsh would not be in his mother-in-law's house at a given hour," Pointer said. "There are many other
possibilities, of course, but that suggests itself as the
simplest explanation. Which was why I looked for her keys at
once."</p>

<p>"And they're missing!" Sewell's forehead began to corrugate
portentously. And when Pointer added, "Yes, it's possible that
the murderer then hurried after the much-more-valuable string of
pearls, if he found to his disappointment that his victim did not
have it on," Sewell said with emphasis, "Five thousand pounds, at
least, in question! And Walsh was told, when he bought the two,
that this string alone might easily fetch another thousand."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't the vendor wait for such an occasion? Who
sold them? Do you know?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"The two necklaces belonged to old Lady Loud-water. Oddly
enough I chanced to hear, some months ago, that she wanted to
realise on them. They once belonged to Queen Charlotte of Mexico
and Lady Loudwater believed they brought their owner bad luck.
She rather suspected that that was why they had been sold to her
originally. If so, they have assuredly lived up to their
reputation!"</p>

<p>There followed another ruminating silence before Pointer
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know Miss Lovelace?"</p>

<p>Sewell had often met her. "It was thought at one time that she
was going to marry Lord Wilverstone&mdash;or, rather, that he
would break off his engagement to another girl and marry Ann
Lovelace. But he married t'other girl after all; so probably
there was nothing in the chatter. At that time Walsh, I know, was
completely bowled over by her. But she never even spared him an
encouraging glance. So that, too, evidently, melted away.
Certainly he was head over ears in love with his wife, as I can
testify, both from what he said to me when asking me to clear up
the mystery of the false pearls and from my own observations at
lunch to-day."</p>

<p>"Did she seem to you equally in love with him?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Equally? No!" Sewell replied. "His evident adoration would
have been hard to equal. But in love all the same. I mean that I
think she was much more of the <i>femme maitresse</i> than he was
of the <i>homme maitre.</i> Dear me!" he grinned, "I'm not as a
rule addicted to French chestnuts; but one must borrow such
phrases, at times, to get one's exact meaning defined without too
much verbiage."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>

Pointer Finds the Missing Keys.</h2>

<p class="first">JUST before the car stopped, Pointer explained
the police position:</p>

<p>"To a certain extent I have no right to enter the house. But
if I had asked permission to do so, it would of course have been
granted at once by Mr. Walsh. And I want, if possible, to have a
look around Mrs. Walsh's own room, without the servants knowing
that I have been in. Apparently no one has yet informed them of
the murder. I have brought some keys with me, one of which ought
to open the front door. If we're detected, I shall hide behind
you. They know you lunched there, and I shall say that Mr. Walsh
handed you his key and asked you to be kind enough to get
something he forgot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His umbrella," suggested Sewell ironically.</p>

<p>They got out of the car very quietly. Pointer tried a key with
which, with a little manipulation, he silently opened the front
door.</p>

<p>"Methods of the Yard," murmured Sewell, stepping in after him.
His grin faded, though, as he softly shut the door behind
him.</p>

<p>He had stood in this hall only a few hours ago; and now the
murdered body of the laughing girl who had waved adieu to him
from that very door was lying in a mortuary waiting for the
dissection that must come.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea where her bedroom would be?" Pointer had
asked on the way there. And Sewell had remembered her speaking of
the noise of some adjacent flats that were being built, but the
noise of which, "fortunately," they did not hear, because their
bedroom was "at the back&mdash;overlooking the gardens."</p>

<p>The muffled sound of a wireless in the basement reached them
from below, and the two hurriedly but very quietly slipped
upstairs and found the desired room almost at once. It was a big
room, over-sumptuously furnished with rose-satin frills
decorating dressing-table, bedspreads, and windows.</p>

<p>The furniture was old and good, and yet it looked over ornate.
Three large wardrobe-trunks stood on the carpet. They were marked
"V. W." Two smaller ones, marked "A. W." stood in the adjoining
dressing-room.</p>

<p>Pointer shut and locked the doors of both rooms, and then
walked slowly through them, eyeing the furniture and pulling on a
pair of rubber gloves after handing another pair to Sewell. He
lifted one or two things up from table or narrow mantel. But the
wanted keys were not under them. Presently, however, his
inspection reached the dressing-table with swinging mirror above
it and little drawers at its sides. These latter were all locked,
but one which had not been shut in as tightly as the others, and
its corners projected a fraction of an inch. Inside were some
dainty net and lace ruffles, and, quite at the back, on top of
their fluffy froth, lay a small bunch of keys.</p>

<p>On testing the drawer for fingerprints, with a compact little
pocket apparatus which he always had with him when on official
duty, Pointer found&mdash;on parts where the surface had taken
them&mdash;distinctly marked prints of three fingertips. The
first one a rather pointed finger, the second and third decidedly
square. They were very near the corner, and very much on the
slant. It looked to Pointer as though the drawer had been closed
in a great hurry by some one hurrying off.</p>

<p>They were not left by Mrs. Walsh's fingers&mdash;of that he
felt quite positive. She had a rather large hand, with a very
pointed third finger; and the nails of all her fingers were much
longer than the nails on the hand in question. For these
fingertips had had short nails. Pointer thought that these prints
betokened the hand of a man. With the tiny camera which likewise
accompanied him on such investigation Pointer photographed the
marks carefully.</p>

<p>Sewell was keenly interested in all this. "Fingerprints are
beyond me," he confessed. "Nothing amuses me more in detective
stories than when an amateur gives one glance at a fingerprint
and instantly identifies it. Whereas all such prints seem much of
a muchness to me."</p>

<p>The chief inspector, however, could distinguish fingerprints
well and he felt sure that he knew these. At the Yard, moreover,
were experts who would read them as easily as other people read
ordinary print. With which reinforcing thought Pointer again
opened the drawer, and once more studied the keys closely without
touching them in the first instance.</p>

<p>He thought they had been tossed in by some one in desperate
haste. And he very much doubted whether Violet Walsh would have
ever flung them on top of those pretty furbelows which seemed to
have been laid in with care; and which, as he finally lifted out
the comparatively heavy bunch of keys, showed too many signs of
crushing to be worn again without first being redressed.</p>

<p>The keys themselves, when examined, told but little. Passing
to the three wardrobe-trunks, he unlocked each in turn, and
glanced through its contents. All were packed to overflowing, and
very neatly and efficiently packed, too. Violet Walsh had been
used to packing for herself. Finally he bent over a flat cabin
trunk that had been shoved under one of the beds. A bed in the
corner, which Pointer fancied&mdash;rightly, from the tapestry
panels around it&mdash;had been Violet's before her marriage.
When he unlocked this trunk and looked inside it he glanced round
at Sewell, who was at his side in an instant.</p>

<p>"Something's been removed from this tray. Look!" He showed
where, among a closely-stocked welter of jumpers, there was an
empty space which exposed the bottom of the tray for nearly a
quarter of its entire length.</p>

<p>"Seems to indicate that a box had occupied that empty space,"
Pointer said. "Such a box might have been a shallow, locked
dispatch box that would guard papers or trinkets. Say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A pearl necklace," Sewell interpolated with conviction as
Pointer continued to study the tray, lifted it, glanced at the
closely-packed lower part&mdash;untouched, he
thought&mdash;before he re-locked this cabin trunk and shoved it
back where he had found it.</p>

<p>The edge of the pink satin frilling around the bedspread was
torn in one place. Pointer thought it had caught in the lock of
the trunk and been violently pulled free.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks to me," said Sewell, "as though the larger
pearl necklace was at the bottom of the murder&mdash;and of the
telephone message summoning Walsh to the Mews so as to leave his
wife's rooms free for the murderous brute to ransack in security
for her jewels."</p>

<p>"You think her murderer wouldn't have seen that she wasn't
wearing the pearls?" Pointer asked sceptically. "They certainly
stand for at least one possible motive; and, so far, the only
plausible one yet found. But why was she at the Mews at all? How
did she get in? With her mother's key&mdash;Mr. Mills suggests.
But, even so, that explains nothing as to her presence there at
all&mdash;even apart from her murder. <i>Why</i> was she
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it must have been connected with the lost or fraudulently
exchanged string!" Sewell said. "She didn't look one to run after
false gods. And it would surely have been a bit early for that,
anyhow, the first week of her honeymoon!"</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you have thought her the kind to have a love
affair&mdash;with any one but her husband, I suppose you mean."
Even without the curious affair of the pearls, Mrs. Walsh's
character was highly important. Sewell considered. He was as keen
as Pointer himself at "sensing" character. He even liked to
consider himself unusually psychic. But the difficulty was how to
put "feelings" into words without giving them the lie.
"Well&mdash;she seemed to lack romantic tendencies...In a way,
she lacked charm," he said finally. "One didn't notice it at
first, you know, because she was so gay and breezy and even
bluff. But, now you ask me, I don't think she was a lover by
nature."</p>

<p>Sewell was interested in his own words. Like a man seeing a
cloudy mixture settle to a different colour sediment, he regarded
this decanted summary of Violet Walsh as something quite
different from his vague general notions of bright eyes, red lips
and gleaming teeth.</p>

<p>"Not much heart?" Pointer said. "Even her dead face suggests
something of that sort. It's handsome&mdash;but, for her age,
hard&mdash;very hard in what must have been its natural
cast."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps she was inwardly hard. I told you Walsh adored
her, rather than she him. You felt with him that she was the only
thing in the world that mattered. Whereas "&mdash;Sewell saw the
sediment clearing a little&mdash;"I fancy money and position and,
above all, power, might appeal more to her. But look here, chief
inspector, your questions are rather rummy...I've noticed it
before. They make you think of people differently...Or, rather,
they make you realise that you really thought of people
differently from what you thought you did."</p>

<p>"It's the Scotland Yard touch," chaffed Pointer. "They teach
us to strip off the glamour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Sewell put up a brown, bony hand impressively. "That's
it I Just what she lacked. As I read Arthur Walsh's bride, she
was without any touch of glamour...But to go back to the question
of motive for her murder&mdash;I don't see that the murderer
mightn't have thought she was wearing that valuable string under
her dress. Women often do, I've understood, when going about in
ordinary street things."</p>

<p>"Sounds a bit hasty," Pointer said dryly, "to murder on an
off-chance. And murderers, in my experience, are devilish
careful, as a rule, not to put their necks into the noose for
nothing. This one, too, had only to use his eyes. For his victim
is wearing a collarless, V-necked dress. And&mdash;unless it was
a fact and her maid was in collusion with him&mdash;he'd not
expect to find the pearls around her waist."</p>

<p>"But what else than that string of splendid pearls that Walsh
wants traced, while I'm clearing his wife's name about the other,
<i>could</i> have been the motive for her murder?" Sewell
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded in sympathy as he crossed to the window, where
stood a little table with some letters and note-paper on it. An
engagement-book lay at one side and Pointer looked up its last
date. There was one entry for this same day. "<i>4 o'clock,"</i>
was scrawled in pencil, as though noted hastily.</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" queried Sewell, peering over Pointer's arm.
"Four o'clock she was alive. Five she was alive. It's what
happened between five and five-thirty that's the riddle! Look
here," he cried, "say it was she herself who took some box out
from that cabin trunk under her bed, at '<i>four o'clock.</i>'
The interview takes place then. She tears back here for her
hidden pearls at five..."</p>

<p>"&mdash;And didn't replace her keys in her handbag&mdash;but
flung them into that drawer?" Again Pointer was clearly
sceptical. He plainly could not see the owner of that bunch of
keys leaving them behind her, carelessly tossed into a frail
little drawer for safe custody.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
The Fingerprints Seem to Link Up the Keys With a Certain Person.</h2>

<p class="first">THE two slipped, still unheard, downstairs and
outside. Drawing the front door noiselessly shut, Pointer pressed
the bell. He had to ring three times. But at last a parlourmaid
opened it, murmured promptly that none of the family was in, and
was about to close the door again when Pointer stopped her with
an authoritative gesture.</p>

<p>"There's been an accident to Mrs. Walsh," he said. "I want to
ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"Lor', sir!" said the maid in shocked tones, but addressing
Sewell as a gentleman who had lunched at the house a few hours
before. "Lor', sir! Not a serious accident, I hope." As she
spoke, the parlourmaid showed them in.</p>

<p>"Very serious. Fatal, I'm sorry to say. Mrs. Walsh is dead,"
was the reply. "How can we get into touch with her mother, Mrs.
Finch-Gray?"</p>

<p>"Dead!" The maid turned shocked eyes on Sewell, again. "Why
you yourself, sir, lunched here with the mistress and master to-day! And she was in her bedroom around five! How did it happen,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Head injury," was the reply. "She was killed outright."</p>

<p>"Oh, those cars!" the maid ejaculated. "What's the use of
Belisha Beacons! Just inviting a body to step out and be run
over! And Miss Vi always was in a hurry...always in a rush," she
babbled on, too excited to pause. "I felt it in my bones that
she'd be run over some day. And what Mr. Walsh will do, I can't
think! Only married a few days, and fair doting on her! Oh, sir,
it's dreadful! Her poor mother, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, where can we find her mother?" Pointer asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"She's not back in Town yet," the parlourmaid replied, shaking
her head. "She's not expected back till dinner next Friday. Might
I ask where the accident happened, sir?"</p>

<p>"In a place called Stanley Mews. Do you know it?" Pointer
questioned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gray owns some property there, I know. Was Mrs. Walsh
there in her car?" But, not proposing to satisfy her avid
curiosity:</p>

<p>"Were Mr. and Mrs. Walsh dining at home to-night?" Pointer
asked instead of replying.</p>

<p>"No, sir. They were to dine with some friends of theirs."</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs. Walsh's personal maid?" was the next question.
Upon which he was told that Mrs. Walsh was looking for one, but
had not yet been satisfied. For the time being the parlourmaid
valetted Mr. Walsh, and the housemaid looked after Mrs.
Walsh.</p>

<p>The housemaid was fetched, was duly horrified at the
"accident," and duly indignant at motorcars.</p>

<p>"And when did you say Mrs. Walsh left the house this
afternoon?" Pointer interpolated.</p>

<p>"About five, sir," was the positive answer, with a voluble
account of "Mr. Mills' call," when "Mrs. Walsh had just gone
out."</p>

<p>"You saw her go out?" Pointer asked casually, and was told
that Gwendolyn herself had not. But when she heard her stirring
around in her bedroom&mdash;as the maid had chanced to hear in
passing it&mdash;she, Gwendolyn, had knocked and, on the door
remaining shut when asked, through it, what the knock was for,
had herself asked through it if Mrs. Walsh would like tea. On
which she was similarly assured through the closed door, "No,
thanks," in Mrs. Walsh's well-known voice.</p>

<p>Pointer's only comment was to ask where Mrs. Walsh kept her
keys. The instant reply being, "She always carries them in her
little handbag, just as Mrs. Finch always does."</p>

<p>"Her keys should be locked up, or handed to Mr. Walsh now,"
Pointer said. "Suppose you come up and see if you can't find them
in her bedroom. Her handbag has been opened and there are no keys
in it."</p>

<p>The two maids stared at one another. Both said that they had
never known Miss Vi not to take her keys with her, and Gwendolyn
led the way upstairs with the look of one who performs a
requested act with no hope of success.</p>

<p>"Just glance through the drawers for them," Pointer directed;
and, reiterating that Mrs. Walsh never went out without them, the
maid pulled at a drawer at one side of the dressing-table.</p>

<p>"She always locks <i>everything,</i> sir," the maid insisted.
"She only left this drawer unlocked for me to put in it something
that was coming from the shop. This one&mdash;" She opened
it&mdash;and gave a cry. "But&mdash;these can't be Mrs. Walsh's!"
the housemaid exclaimed, picking up the little bunch of keys that
Pointer had replaced. "They <i>can't</i> be! Is this a joke,
sir?" she asked suddenly and suspiciously.</p>

<p>"A joke? Why?" Sewell broke in to ask in his turn.</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;seeing that I put those frills in there not
half an hour ago myself and no keys were there then&mdash;of
course it seems like some joke to find them on top of those very
frills&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here," Pointer decided to explain, "I think you ought to
know&mdash;both of you&mdash;that Mrs. Walsh's death is being
investigated by the police. To clear up exactly how it happened.
I am a detective inspector from New Scotland Yard&mdash;Mr.
Sewell here will vouch for that&mdash;and I want you to tell me
all that you can about her things."</p>

<p>Still, as was intended, the two maids only thought of Mrs.
Walsh's death as happening in a car accident. They were too
startled and shocked by the news itself to wonder at the
questions they were asked.</p>

<p>"These came from Dickins and Jones this afternoon, sir," the
housemaid who had acted as Mrs.</p>

<p>Walsh's temporary maid explained. "Mrs. Walsh ordered them
yesterday, and she told me that when they came I was to be sure
and lay the frills carefully in this drawer, which she had left
unlocked for them, so as not to let them get mussed at all. And
to think of finding her keys&mdash;and they certainly do look
like hers&mdash;right on top of them! But who in the world could
have put them there, sir?" She eyed the two men searchingly. "For
nobody's been in the house since I laid the frills in that
drawer&mdash;except, of course, Mr. Mills when he called. And he
went out again at once when he was told that Mrs. Walsh was not
in."</p>

<p>"At what time, exactly, did you put them in the drawer and
close it?" Pointer asked, taking out his note-book to show the
importance of question and answer.</p>

<p>"Dickens and Jones delivered them close on half-past four,
sir, and they were laid neatly in the drawer almost at once." It
appeared that the housemaid had been quick about it, and knew
just when she finished her task, because she wanted to slip out
for a word with the young postman who collected letters at that
time from the pillar-box nearby, and he couldn't wait long.</p>

<p>On her side, the parlourmaid had heard Mrs. Walsh back again
in her bedroom just about 5 o'clock&mdash;when she, Gwendolyn,
happened to be passing it. She was quite certain of that, for she
knew "Miss Vi's" voice well, as also "her ways of stirring around
in her room." She couldn't be mistaken about either thing. She
had turned the tap on full in her fitted basin, too, which was
her regular signal when she didn't want to bother to open her
door. "Besides," she said triumphantly as to her certainty, "it
couldn't have been any one else speaking." As for the time when
Mr. Mills rang the front-door bell, the parlourmaid could be
equally certain about that. For cook had just tuned-in for the
North Ireland news from the B.B.C. at quarter-past five. So Mrs.
Walsh must have come back for something and gone out again just
before that. But none of the servants had noticed it, either
time. Mr. Walsh had given the servants' hall a new and splendid
wireless set, and they were "all crazy to listen to it."</p>

<p>Then Pointer had a few words to say as to how fresh and
charming the bedroom looked; and was told about its having been
newly decorated for the bridal pair's use of it until their own
house could be done over for them. And, in reply to another word
of praise, learnt that all the old pieces had been French
polished just the day before their arrival. Oh, yes, including
the dressing-table, of course.</p>

<p>The two men hurried out, making a great show of haste, so that
they need not say more about the "accident." Outside in the car
they jotted down the time-table thus obtained.</p>

<p>"About five o'clock she was heard in her room. By five-fifteen
she was gone. Just before half-past five the telephone message
reached her husband asking him to go at once to Stanley Mews. The
three got there," noted Pointer, "just past the half-hour, and
found Mrs. Walsh murdered. We were notified a couple of minutes
before quarter to six. The doctor saw the body at practically six
o'clock, and, as the day is warm, puts the hour of death as
around five at the very latest; although, if that time should be
challenged he would be prepared to extend it backwards to four
o'clock; but not to advance it. It looks, therefore, as though
she must have been killed very soon after leaving her mother's
house, as she was heard in her room at five...and it took us just
eight minutes from door to door. I was careful, though, not to
drive very fast, and we had the lights against us once so the
journey could have been made in a lucky five minutes."</p>

<p>"It looks as though she had been killed at once on entering,
or rather on returning to the flat in the Mews," Sewell said,
jotting down this time-table. "But that four o'clock
appointment...I Mr. Walsh evidently can't help us about that, and
I must get to work sharply on his commission," he added as he
slipped his note-book into his pocket. "And those pearls...! I
must certainly have a word with Miss Lovelace first of all, and
hear her version of the affair."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," Pointer said, "the Yard will probably establish
whose fingerprints are on the drawer where the keys were found.
As also how long Mrs. Walsh was at her dressmaker's in Bruton
Street."</p>

<p>They parted with an agreement to dine together and talk over
the affair from any fresh angle obtained in the interval.</p>

<p>On calling, Sewell learned that Miss Lovelace was in; and, on
being given the message he pencilled on his card, she saw him at
once.</p>

<p>She made a charming vision, too, in something all ice-blue
frills and a big pale rose bow of ribbon. Her face, exquisitely
made up, her coral-tinted cheeks showed no pallor, but the pupils
of her large eyes were enormously dilated. So it seemed that even
Miss Lovelace could feel an emotional shock. Sewell had fancied
her haughtily impervious to any.</p>

<p>She had heard the dreadful news, she said, about half an flour
ago from her maid, who had heard it from one of the maids with
whom she was great friends at Friars Halt. And much to his
surprise, Sewell found Ann Lovelace quite different from what he
had expected. She spoke gently and sympathetically of Arthur
Walsh's murdered bride, deploring her own previous thoughts about
her in connection with the imitation pearls which the then Violet
Finch had insisted on leaving with her as security for the sum
which Ann had advanced for the other's gambling debt at the
night-club the two had visited out of curiosity.</p>

<p>And in return for what Sewell was touched by as Ann's candour,
he explained how he had come to call on her for just such details
as Arthur Walsh's <i>private</i> investigator. "For I have no
connection with the police, I hope you know, Miss
Lovelace&mdash;except as a personal friend and admirer of Chief
Inspector Pointer. But my profession is the clearing up of
wrongly-aspersed reputations, and Walsh is determined to have his
wife's honour vindicated."</p>

<p>"I do hope you'll be successful," Ann exclaimed impulsively.
"I feel sure now, in cold blood, that she, too, had been somehow
made the victim of that cleverly-substituted copy of the real
string of pearls. And now you are going to find out, I hope and
trust, who really did steal the original string, for I suppose
it's stolen?" she asked. Adding eagerly: "In justice to that poor
murdered girl it's all one can do now, and I'm only too glad to
help.</p>

<p>"But why was she at that man Mills's flat? Can <i>he</i> be at
the bottom of the mystery? Between you and me, Mr. Sewell, he
looks capable of it! Handsome enough, well groomed, and all that,
yet somehow a rank outsider. But then&mdash;of course&mdash;!"
Her embarrassed silence finished the sentence to the effect that
Violet Walsh had been no less an arrant outsider, too.</p>

<p>Sewell just touched on Walsh's belief that it was in trying to
find out something about the mystery that his wife had met her
death. Ann said she was sure it must be the explanation.</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly, and Sewell was delighted at Miss
Lovelace's acceptance of his invitation to lunch with him as soon
as he should have learned more about the whole puzzling
mystery.</p>

<p>Ann immediately drove down to Friars Halt, and arrived there
to find Arthur closeted with the Colonel. Kitty saw her car
arrive, but withdrew to her own rooms. Not that Ann asked for
her, but seated herself in the library which opened out of the
Colonel's den. And for once both girls had one and the same
anxiety: What was going on in Colonel Walsh's study?</p>

<p>How was Arthur telling his dreadful news? How was his father
taking it? Lady Monkhouse, Ann knew, was away, staying with
friends.</p>

<p>In actuality the Colonel listened in horrified silence, aghast
at Arthur's broken, stammered account of what had been found in
Stanley Mews.</p>

<p>"Terrible! An incredibly dreadful affair!" he said finally in
choking nightmare sensations.</p>

<p>"To think that Ann thought Violet knew about those pearls
being false! She went to the Mews because she had learnt
something," Arthur wound up. "Something linking the place with
the stolen and imitated pearls&mdash;for that shorter string is
missing. We haven't been able to find it anywhere."</p>

<p>His eyes on his knees, the Colonel made no comment. He did not
see the affair in that light at all; and his absolute silence
plainly said as much. At which Arthur, his head held very stiff
and very high, took his wordless departure, encountering Ann
Lovelace outside, as she had meant that he should. But a very
different Ann from their last meeting.</p>

<p>He made as if to pass her, but she caught his elbow, appealing
with trembling lips:</p>

<p>"Arthur, I've come to apologise&mdash;utterly and completely.
I was all wrong! I was a jealous beast to her! This&mdash;this
awful affair&mdash;" And with that he took her outstretched hand
in his, holding it in eloquent silence for a long moment.</p>

<p>This was the picture that met Kitty Walsh as she came quietly
down the stairs congratulating herself that Ann was now safely
out of the way. And in the talk that followed&mdash;for Ann saw
her and drew her irresistibly into it&mdash;even Kitty had to
agree that it took a very suspicious person indeed to doubt Ann's
words of sympathy and remorse. As for Arthur, he thanked her for
her touching expressions about Violet, in a voice that shook.
Kitty's sympathy he seemed to take for granted. Then he drove
back at once to town and to Sewell's flat. Sewell was in, and
expecting him.</p>

<p>"God, man!" Arthur said in a tone that moved his friend
deeply, "how little we dreamed what was coming, when I asked you
to find out the truth about those damned pearls! If only I had
never heard of them! But as it is, you're out of the search now,
Sewell, and I take it up myself. Not that I think for a moment
that I can fill your shoes at it but you know how you would feel
yourself if you stood in mine, my dear fellow!"</p>

<p>Sewell could well imagine that. Suppose it had been Kitty
Walsh murdered, for instance!</p>

<p>"I don't want to step out of it, though," he said slowly. "I
haven't done anything yet and no one likes to fall down on a job.
There's work in it for you, too, Walsh. I'll get on to the chief
inspector and put it to him."</p>

<p>After a little delay Pointer got the message, and promptly
asked Walsh to join in; and since Sewell wanted to continue his
special investigation of the double mystery of the two pearl
necklaces, Pointer invited both men to dine with him at his
rooms, Sewell, meanwhile, to post Walsh as to just how far the
investigation had yet gone.</p>

<p>"Now about that <i>'four o'clock'</i> date jotted down in your
wife's note-book, Walsh," Sewell said, "have you no idea what it
stood for? Where she was going besides to her dressmaker?"</p>

<p>Arthur made a hopeless negative gesture with his cigarette.
"She only told me that she had a lot of fittings to get through,
and then spoke of being 'occupied' till past five. I lumped the
two together, and thought she had meant that she would be at the
dressmaker's until five. But, on thinking back, I remember her
making two sentences of it, or rather of them. I'm dead sure she
was hot on the track of that cursed string that started all this
awful business. She was terribly upset by Ann's incredible
suspicions about herself. And naturally, if she thought she had a
chance of catching the thief, she would have gone for him bald-headed! Vi was just that sort."</p>

<p>Something in his voice made Sewell ask point-blank, "Have you
any suspicions yourself?"</p>

<p>Arthur's eyes met his full on. "I <i>know!</i> But I've no
proof. He came to me red-handed, Sewell!"</p>

<p>"It'll be difficult to prove," Sewell said. The name of Mills
was not mentioned. There was no need.</p>

<p>"By the way," Sewell said suddenly, "Pointer thinks that
Father Walsh knows something. Your cousin was dose beside the
Mews this afternoon, just about the time."</p>

<p>"Ambrose!" Arthur stared at the other as though in dismay.
"Ambrose!" he repeated again. "I hope to God the chief
inspector's mistaken," he went on slowly. "Ambrose is a damned
difficult fish to land. And he's refused from the first to do
Violet anything like justice. He will never forgive her because
she suggested our getting married in a registry office. And a
jolly unselfish thing of her it was, too!"</p>

<p>"Rather!" Sewell agreed warmly, "most girls seem to think
they're on the films that day, and that the longer train and the
more bridesmaids they have, the greater their chances of getting
a full press."</p>

<p>"I was only too thankful to her," Arthur continued frankly,
"but it damned us both with Ambrose. And as, unluckily, I had
asked him to marry us, he guessed instantly who had been the
instigator of the registry wedding. I wonder why the chief
inspector thinks Ambrose knows anything to the purpose?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say; but Pointer's not one to think things without
good reason, you may rest assured."</p>

<p>"I'll have a talk at once with my cousin."</p>

<p>Arthur rose as he spoke. "I haven't been to confession for
ages. He's always reminding me of my remissness. I'll go now; and
afterwards, in the glow of welcoming back the prodigal son, he'll
be bound to open up and aid me under these awful circumstances.
Till to-night, then, Sewell! I may learn something really
important from him."</p>

<p>Arthur hurried away on his errand, but when Sewell met him on
the steps of the house in Bayswater, where the chief inspector
had his comfortable rooms, it was to see a very disappointed
expression.</p>

<p>"He's in a Retreat!" Arthur exclaimed bitterly. "I couldn't
even send a message in. And it's to last four days!"</p>

<p>"Annoying!" Sewell said sympathetically. "But would he admit
it, if he knew anything that would help in the inquiry?
Supposing, of course, that it was anything he had learnt by
accident in the ordinary way..."</p>

<p>"If it would help Violet, he'd let himself be drawn and
quartered rather than speak," Arthur said fiercely. "And it is
wanted to help her name at least. The only help we can give her
now." His face worked convulsively and, turning round, he pressed
the bell violently.</p>

<p>Pointer welcomed them, repeating that he would be very glad
indeed of Arthur's assistance. They had learnt from the shop in
question&mdash;if one could call anything so quiet and handsomely
appointed a "shop"&mdash;that Mrs. Walsh had left it at quarter
to four, and had seemed anxious not to be late for some
engagement, even declining to complete her fitting, which she had
postponed to eleven to-morrow morning, when they were to have
some furs up from cold storage for her inspection. She had walked
away on foot from the establishment, the commissionaire said,
refusing his offer to call a taxi for her.</p>

<p>Upon which Arthur said that Violet almost never used a taxi,
preferring the exercise of walking. "She went to the Mews, which
is quite close," he said confidently. "She didn't have an
engagement,' but, on the contrary, surprised some one there, as
she surmised that she would. I feel certain that she fearlessly
taxed whoever she found there with the theft of the
pearls&mdash;and was instantly killed on the spot."</p>

<p>"No, no! She was back in Ennismore Gardens at five," Sewell
reminded him.</p>

<p>"She went to the Mews, I tell you <i>Must</i> have done so,
because of some knowledge of what had happened to the pearls,"
Arthur repeated stubbornly. "And to silence her, to prevent her
telling me that knowledge, she was murdered."</p>

<p>At this point the chief inspector produced a startling
contribution to the talk. The fingerprints on the drawer in Mrs.
Walsh's bedroom proved to be Mills's.</p>

<p>"Got him!" exulted Walsh. "And I feared he might slip through
the net!"</p>

<p>But Pointer shook his head. "I'm afraid the affair isn't as
simple as that, Mr. Walsh, although it looks as though it had
been Mills who had flung the keys into the drawer after taking
something out of the trunk under her bed."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how he can explain such evidence away!"
Sewell's tone was also unconsciously exultant. "When are you
going to spring it on him, chief inspector?"</p>

<p>"When I know more," Pointer said succinctly. "There was
something very important in that trunk, something that Mr. Mills
was determined to get at all costs."</p>

<p>"When did he slip into the room?" Sewell wondered.</p>

<p>"He must have watched, and seen my wife go out at five,"
Arthur cogitated, speaking dreamily as though to himself, "and
then let himself in, run up to our room and helped himself to
whatever it was in that trunk that he wanted. It may have been
something of his own. Nothing more likely."</p>

<p>"But how did he get possession of the keys?" Pointer
queried.</p>

<p>"Could he perhaps have made some plausible excuse, and got
them from Mrs. Walsh herself as she went out?" Sewell
suggested.</p>

<p>"That is, at any rate, probably what Mr. Mills will tell us,"
Pointer said dryly. "Which is why I want nothing to be said about
the fingerprints found on the front of the drawer, at this stage
of the investigation."</p>

<p>"But I suppose you keep the drawer as vital evidence," put in
Arthur anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly! We have it safe at the Yard. Luckily, it is
mahogany, and one quite sufficiently like it was easily obtained
and fits the dressing-table well enough for ordinary notice,"
Pointer reassured him.</p>

<p>"Good!" Those particular fingerprints seemed to Arthur the
first important piece of evidence that had come to hand, although
they were apparently only connected with the trunk under the bed
in the mind of the chief inspector, and Arthur did not attach
much importance to that cabin trunk, which himself he had never
even seen. But, whatever it had held, the prints might be of the
greatest use in proving the case against Mills&mdash;a case which
must unfortunately rest entirely on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Of one thing Arthur felt sure, and that was that the wanted
pearls were not and never had been in that trunk. He had seen
Violet take them out and put them away too often to have any
doubts on that point. Which was the reason why he hoped that the
cabin-trunk under the bed would not distract the eye of the chief
inspector from the really important line of inquiry; but Arthur
did not think that this would happen, "not being quite a
fool."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Arthur Walsh was no bad
psychologist&mdash;a much better one than one would have guessed
from his face. And he thought that Pointer was most emphatically
not a man to be sidetracked. Besides, there was Sewell to count
on&mdash;Arthur's own agent, whose job it was to solve the
mystery of the false pearls and the disappearance of the real
ones.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"Mills speaking." He had just found Mrs. Finch at Henley and
had broken the news of the tragedy to her. She was terribly
shocked and shaken. He, Mills, thought that she ought to have at
least a night's rest and quiet. But Mrs. Finch insisted on seeing
the officer in charge of the case at once. They were therefore
driving back at once to Ennismore Gardens. Would the chief
inspector manage to meet them there? Mills added that he had been
asked by Mrs. Finch to stay there, as he was, of course, giving
up his rooms in the Mews at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>

A Mother's Grief Does Not Appear to Be Overwhelming.</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. FINCH showed few outward marks of grief, to
the chief inspector's apparently casual glance, when he followed
Arthur Walsh and Sewell into the drawing-room at Ennismore
Gardens. She looked surprised to see Pointer with them, but
without expressing it otherwise.</p>

<p>She turned to Arthur with both hands outstretched. "I don't
know how to say what I feel! Grief for poor Violet, and horror at
the way of her death!"</p>

<p>He held her hands for a moment before gently seating her
again, as he said brokenly, "I don't think any of us can express
what we feel about it, except by doing all we can to help
Scotland Yard to see to it that her murderer doesn't escape
justice. Sewell, here, is helping, too&mdash;in his own expert
way."</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch seemed puzzled at this, but she asked no question
and Sewell had been told by Arthur, on their way to Ennismore
Gardens, that she presumably knew nothing about the loss of any
pearls, which had made Sewell give him a somewhat astonished
glance but, like Mrs. Finch now, he had asked no questions.</p>

<p>"The first of the lot that's a complete enigma to us," Arthur
continued, "is, what could have taken Vi to Mills's flat?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch seemed to pause a moment before replying that, with
Mills and herself away at Maidenhead, Violet might have made an
appointment with some one there, thinking she would be sure to
have the place to herself. Or, rather, knowing she would
have&mdash;Mrs. Finch corrected herself. "For Mills and I were
detained in Maidenhead all day until half-past four, when he
agreed to buzz up to town for me, to ask Violet for some papers
which I thought we ought to have. I know the exact time, because
we compared our watches as to whether he could get them back to
me within an hour and a quarter. It was just possible, if the
road was clear both ways, and if Violet was quick about handing
them to him."</p>

<p>If Mills had left Maidenhead at half-past four, he would only
have just been able to reach Ennismore Gardens at a quarter past
five. It was a complete alibi, if it could be depended on. One
does not as a rule suspect a mother of giving a false alibi to
any one who might have killed her daughter, but, apart from the
fact that Mrs. Finch did not strike Pointer as being an ordinary
mother, the man in question was her business partner, and he
thought that, to this woman, the latter fact might outweigh
everything else.</p>

<p>"And was your husband, Mr. Gray, with you?" Pointer asked
now.</p>

<p>He was told that Mr. Gray was in Birmingham at a motor show
there. He had been away some three days, and, except for this
tragedy which would bring him home at once, would have been away
for another three.</p>

<p>Pointer did not ask her as to what the relations had been
between the stepfather and the dead woman. He did not ask what he
called "capital" questions of close relations. Still less of a
wife concerning her husband, or of a husband concerning his wife.
They were "out of bounds" in his regular inquiries, necessitating
other sources of the wanted information.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how Mrs. Walsh's will runs?" he asked,
instead, with a deprecating glance at Arthur.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch shrugged her shoulders indifferently as she
answered, "Arthur settled a very handsome allowance on her, but
all that Violet owned to bequeath consisted of a couple of pearl
necklaces and some other jewellery."</p>

<p>Pointer now nodded to Sewell, who then told Mrs. Finch under
what circumstances he himself had been called in professionally
by Walsh; and the latter amplified Sewell's statement by other
relating details.</p>

<p>At this his mother-in-law sat very still. Her greedy lips
sucked in at the corners, her small cold eyes intently fixing
themselves now on Sewell, now on Arthur, as she listened with her
whole being as well as with her ears.</p>

<p>"But that's the shorter string," she said when the latter had
finished about the imitation necklace. "I won't stop to say how
astounded I am at what you tell me. Arthur, you didn't breathe a
word of all this to me! That was most considerate of you. But
just like you, dear boy And what about the longer
string&mdash;the much more valuable necklace? Where is
<i>it</i>?"</p>

<p>"It was not on Mrs. Walsh when she was found&mdash;dead,"
Pointer said.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, it must be traced! And the other one, too!"
said Mrs. Finch firmly. "They were about all that the poor child
had to leave, and it would grieve her terribly if she could know
that her mother didn't even get that much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had Mrs. Walsh any known enemies?" Pointer asked. It was a
stereotyped question; but he had never found one more initially
useful in suggesting the trail or trails of those private
enmities that surround so many a murder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch turned to her son-in-law. "Well, Arthur, what about
it?" she asked him with an enigmatic smile. "You would know about
that better than any one else could, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," Arthur answered grimly, "until this mystery
about the pearls is cleared up."</p>

<p>"Well, there you are, then! Who accused poor Violet of having
known that the pearls were false just in order to stop the
marriage? A most atrocious lie! But who particularly wanted to
stop your marriage?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean my cousin, Ambrose Walsh?" Arthur asked
coldly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch gave a derisive snort. "Try again!" she
advised.</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace&mdash;" Arthur began still more stiffly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Ann?" snapped Mrs. Finch. "Well, what about Ann
Lovelace? Violet had no greater enemy, you can bet on that!"</p>

<p>"Not now! Ann's most frightfully sorry for having so misjudged
her," Arthur protested. "I can't tell you all the kind and true
things she said remorsefully about Violet. I was most frightfully
touched by her moving words, Mrs. Finch."</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch stopped him with an upraised finger, as though he
had been a taxi. Her face was stony.</p>

<p>Pointer recognised that here was a nature as hard as adamant.
This was a bereaved mother who exhibited a singular lack of
feeling about her daughter's dreadful death. Indeed at times
something approaching an actual dislike of Violet Walsh looked
from Mrs. Finch's eyes, spoke in her tones, but never in her
words.</p>

<p>"The first thing to do, as you say, Arthur, is to trace and
produce those pearls of Violet's." And, blandly ignoring the fact
that he had said nothing of the kind to her, she turned to Sewell
and continued with emphasis:</p>

<p>"Mr. Walsh has engaged you to clear his murdered wife's good
name from foul imputations, Mr. Sewell. And so do I! And if you
find those pearls for me&mdash;for they're mine now&mdash;you'll
discover <i>who was</i> my poor child's mortal enemy."</p>

<p>At this Pointer asked her explicitly, "Am I to understand you
to affirm, madam, that your daughter, Mrs. Walsh, had no property
to leave, apart from her pearl necklaces?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else, except a very small bank balance, so far as I
know," was the decided reply. "My husband, Mr. Finch, left me
practically penniless. I contrived to make a small fortune,
however, but lost it all by misled investments. As for my
clubs&mdash;I'm much afraid there's nothing left of them but
enormous debts. But I really can tell you nothing more. Mr.
Mills, as he is obliged to, now, is putting up at my house."</p>

<p>They knew this last fact already, as also that Mills was
reported "not in." And the chief inspector requested "Mrs. Finch"
to accompany Inspector Watts to the Yard, and there put in
writing her claims to the said pearls, explaining that he himself
must be elsewhere for the next hour or so.</p>

<p>Arthur, accordingly, said good-bye to her and left the house,
with Sewell and Pointer. He drew a deep breath as the door closed
behind them. "There's something about that woman," he began, then
stopped. "My murdered wife seems to have infected me with some of
her own sensations," he muttered. "She was secretly terrified of
her mother." He turned to Pointer and they got into the latter's
car. "It's a terrible thing to say, but I can't set her aside
from this dreadful affair&mdash;at any rate as regards the
pearls. Violet told me that she had been virtually forced to
leave them to her in the will that she signed just the day before
our marriage. Those damned pearls! But for them my poor girl
would be alive now. Don't you think so, too?" he asked Pointer.
At whose reply:</p>

<p>"So far, it certainly looks as though the pearls were closely
connected with her death; but by the way, Mr. Walsh, who would
inherit from you in the event of your own death?"</p>

<p>Sewell looked surprised, and Arthur stared.</p>

<p>"I suppose the bulk of my father's fortune would go to Ambrose
Walsh, my cousin the priest," he said, "now that Gerald is
dead&mdash;or even if he were alive, as anything that I have to
bequeath will go to Father Walsh."</p>

<p>Pointer now heard about the priest's "Retreat," which had only
just started. And he also learnt about the disinheriting of
Arthur's elder brother, Gerald Walsh, and the reasons for it.</p>

<p>Pointer's next question referred, however, to the pearls in
question. He asked how, and from whom, Mr. Walsh had first heard
of them. Arthur had to think hard back for a moment, before he
recalled that it had been "Miss Lovelace" who had told him of two
remarkably beautiful pearl necklaces that had belonged to the
unfortunate Queen Charlotte of Mexico, and which she knew were
for sale at a price that was really "a bargain" for such pearls.
But he added that he could by no means feel sure that that was
"the <i>first</i> mention made about them, nor just who had
originally put the idea into his head that the two strings would
make a superb wedding gift to his bride."</p>

<p>And Pointer let the query rest at this tragedy-obscured, vague
remembrance of that detail.</p>

<p>Instead, he turned to the question of the larger and much more
valuable string. "Mrs. Finch seemed to think, just now, that it
might be in your safe. Is it there? I noticed that you let her
suppose that you would turn it over to her after the reading of
Mrs. Walsh's last Will and Testament."</p>

<p>"Of course it's in Violet's jewel box, in her mother's house,"
Arthur said. "That was why I did not argue with her about
it."</p>

<p>On which Pointer glanced at his watch as he said, "Mrs. Finch
promised to go to my rooms at once, so if you'll turn round, Mr.
Walsh, we might see if the longer string is there now."</p>

<p>"You don't share Walsh's suspicion that Mrs. Finch may know
something about the missing string, do you, chief inspector?"
Sewell asked in a whispered aside as Arthur's attention was
momentarily concentrated on passing between two drays.</p>

<p>"She's a most difficult woman to read&mdash;or surprise,"
Pointer replied. "But I think she has a distinct theory as to the
identity of the murderer. A theory which she has not passed on to
us. It was in existence before she heard about the loss of the
pearls&mdash;and it does not centre on Miss Lovelace, I feel
quite sure."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>

An Advertisement Is Found in Duplicate.</h2>

<p class="first">BACK at the house the three men learned that
Mrs. Finch had summoned a taxi and driven to the Yard; police
watch being maintained as to Mills's movements.</p>

<p>Arthur opened the door with his latch-key and Pointer and
Sewell followed him into the house. Some tampering with the seals
over the lock of the bedroom was evident to the chief inspector;
but as they were intact he said nothing. And as soon as they were
in the room Arthur opened the trunks with Violet's keys.</p>

<p>In the larger wardrobe trunk was her jewel-box. He unlocked
that too, and with a sigh lifted out some really beautiful
jewellery which had been partly wedding presents and partly gifts
bought by him for his young bride on their honeymoon. Then he
came to an oval flat leather box that had her initials in gilt on
its lid. The pearls were in this, he said, and pressed the
button. Inside lay a beautiful string of pearls; creamy white,
with just the suspicion of a rosy gleam in their exquisite
colour. "Yes, this is the larger string. So it's only the smaller
that's missing," Arthur said as he lifted it out carefully.</p>

<p>"Are you sure they're genuine?" Sewell and Pointer asked
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Walsh smiled as he let the string swing a little from his
extended fingers.</p>

<p>"Don't they speak for themselves?" he replied, his voice
movingly sad. Sewell felt in wordless sympathy.</p>

<p>Pointer was not an adept in the language of pearls. He
modestly disclaimed the authority of an expert, but both a long
experience in analogous cases and his lessons from jewel experts
had taught him that <i>genuine</i> precious stones, and
especially genuine pearls, have a peculiar and (he should say)
quite inimitable coldness to the touch which he was inclined to
think was not convincingly evident in this handsome string. An
instant recourse to an unquestionable pronouncement, as to
whether or not his own doubts were valid, was therefore a vital
necessity in the present investigation. And in another minute the
three men were seated in Pointer's car, taking the string for the
judgment of the jewellers from whom Arthur, still reiterating
that any doubt of its identity was incredible, had purchased the
two necklaces as his wedding gift to Violet Finch.</p>

<p>On the chief inspector's card being sent in to him with an
"urgent" request for his opinion, the manager had the three at
once shown into his room. And had no sooner glanced at the
necklace, even before it lay in his palm, than he unhesitatingly
pronounced it "false." Adding:</p>

<p>"A marvellously deceptive imitation of the well-remembered
and, of course, accurately recorded larger string of the two
'historically unique' pair sold to Mr. Walsh, here. This
amazingly perfect copy is from Paris. The patent is the
successful invention of a man named d'Erlanger, instances of
whose genius in that line I have seen before; but none so
astonishingly good. It is an expensive process; entirely
mechanical; the copied pearls being turned out exact in weight,
and very closely approximate in tint and even in apparent
substance."</p>

<p>"How much would such an imitation as this one cost?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"At the present rate of exchange I could get it done, in the
trade, for say&mdash;sixty pounds."</p>

<p>Walsh now held out the smaller string which Violet Finch had
taken from Ann Lovelace. He had got her on the honeymoon to give
them to him. Hung beside the other, even to his eyes, they showed
as from one process.</p>

<p>Receiving a similar pronouncement, and Pointer having
expressed his official thanks, a very silent and variously
ruminating trio returned to the house, where a careful and
thorough search of all the murdered bride's things failed to
discover the other missing string.</p>

<p>Pointer requested Mr. Walsh to unlock the cabin trunk under
the bed, and that also was searched. He called Arthur's attention
to the space free in the otherwise stuffed tray. A metal despatch
box? he queried. But Arthur said that he had never seen his wife
in possession of such a thing. "Did she ever put the pearls into
a hiding-place of her own devising?" Pointer asked. "Or rather, I
should have asked if she ever hid 'the beads' thus. For it's
conceivable, Mr. Walsh, that, as the shorter string was imitated
before your marriage, the longer one may also have been changed
then, and all the real pearls stolen at the same time."</p>

<p>Arthur made an unhappy gesture. "I'd say 'who cares?'" he
replied bitterly, "in face of her death. But for the fact that
clearing up about the cursed things means getting at the bottom
of her mysterious death and, let us hope, hanging her murderer!
But the more I think back to it&mdash;and I can't think about
much else&mdash;I can't hold to my first hasty idea that it was
<i>he</i> who phoned so urgently to me to go at once to the Mews.
I believe now that, on the contrary and surely much more
probably, that message that I stupidly took for a hoax was sent
to <i>save</i> my darling from him! That it must have been the
frantic effort of some one who had seen and recognised the
wretch, perhaps as he was furtively stealing into the house or
the flat. And if he happened to believe him one of a thieving
gang that would stick at nothing to cover up their tracks, and
then saw Violet go in and knew of our sensational marriage, that
wildly confused message to me would be quite understandable,
especially if she wasn't seen again coming out. Oh! to think,"
Arthur chokingly repeated, "that had I jumped into a car at once
I might have saved her."</p>

<p>Sewell, however, tried to comfort those impassioned and vain
regrets by again recurring to the alternative possibility that
whoever sent that telephone message did it to keep the husband
away from Mrs. Walsh's bedroom in Ennismore Gardens while it was
ransacked for the larger string of pearls.</p>

<p>"It was at twenty-five past five," Arthur said more calmly and
thoughtfully. "Yes, of course, that's a less torturing
possibility. For&mdash;but for Mills&mdash;I might have come
back...But then! But for Mills..." He stood staring down at the
trunk fixedly when a tap on the locked room door startled
him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walsh wanted on the telephone," at which he slipped out
of the room.</p>

<p>It was Ann Lovelace telephoning. She had been told that Arthur
had gone with the chief inspector and Mr. Sewell to Ennismore
Gardens; and she was "irrepressibly keen to learn" whether they
had yet found the longer string of pearls, or had got on the
track of the imitated shorter one, she said.</p>

<p>Arthur suggested that she should come herself to Ennismore
Gardens, as he did not care to telephone the latest piece of
news, which was "decidedly and most amazingly unexpected."</p>

<p>Whereupon Ann eagerly replied that she would be there in five
minutes. She did it in less, and convulsively held Arthur's hand
clasped tightly in both of hers as he told her of the finding of
what he had of course supposed to be the longer string; of the
chief inspector's doubts of its genuineness and their consequent
immediate visit to the jewellers; the manager of whom had
pronounced it false.</p>

<p>"Imitation!" she gasped. "Then both were imitation?
Incredible!"</p>

<p>Arthur's fullest reply was his invitation to Ann to "come
upstairs and see it." He brought her in with him and Pointer
acquiescently showed her the string. Expressing her amazement,
she repeated that of course Violet had been deceived as any one
might well be!... "But where are the real pearls?" she looked
about her inquiringly. And, as no one answered, she continued
with fresh suggestions. "I wonder if any well-known purchaser was
buying pearls just then?... They might have been bought quite
innocently, I should think. Though I was rather thinking of the
East...There they adore pearls, don't they?... But may I have a
hunt, too? It seems so absolutely impossible that they are not
here somewhere."</p>

<p>As she spoke Ann opened the little drawers. Pointer and Sewell
frankly watched this proceeding. Miss Lovelace seemed arrested by
some scraps of printed paper. Not one came her way that she did
not carefully glance through, however crumpled. Letters or papers
with handwriting on it were also examined, but the chief
inspector had an idea that she wanted to see if she could find
something definite in print which had been kept by Violet Walsh
and stuffed away in some inconspicuous place.</p>

<p>Pointer had with him the handbag which had been found in the
room where Violet Walsh had been murdered. He had had its sides
protected by transparent paper when handling it to see whether it
would fit and fill the space left empty by some such article's
removal from the trunk-tray under the bed. He thought it rather
larger than the said space. Neither Ann nor either of the maids
had ever seen it in Mrs. Walsh's possession. Evidently bought
before her wedding, it was decidedly larger than any usually
carried by Violet; less flat-sided on compression. In other
words, capable of holding more in it.</p>

<p>Giving it, consequently, a fresh and still more thorough
investigation with gloved fingers, Pointer now discovered a sort
of secret division within it. For what looked and (casually) felt
like an outside "side," exactly resembling the other side, even
when seen from within when the bag was opened to use the rest of
it, was, in reality the cover of a virtually "secret" division.
This was completely masked to the eye by an inner lining-covered
wire frame of serviceable firmness which so fully and exactly
fitted into the "side" as to make a really undetectable division
unless found by a knowing or a "searching" pressure on it: to
"pry-out" the fitting beneath the outward catch closing the
bag.</p>

<p>At first sight this "secret" division seemed to contain
nothing. But on feeling down inside a flat-looking little pocket
that had originally held a tiny mirror, in all probability,
Pointer found a crumpled newspaper cutting.</p>

<p>It looked like a "personal," and ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">Secretary of Rajah now in England wants to buy
for his employer some really fine sapphires and pearls. Good
prices given.

<br>

<p>A box number followed.</p>

<p>He glanced up casually, midway through it. Mr. Walsh was
apparently oblivious of all but a letter which he was reading and
reluctantly finishing before laying it down thoughtfully. But
Miss Lovelace had her eyes fixed on the paper in the chief
inspector's hand with a satisfied and exultant gleam in her eye.
She had forgotten caution for the moment. Clearly Ann Lovelace
knew the tenure of that scrap of print, the chief inspector
silently noted, debating among his mental decisions the
possibility of her having been exclusively searching for
precisely this particular bit of evidence, and what that might
mean.</p>

<p>He put the scrap back as though not especially interested by
it, and leaving the bag carelessly on the table, turned to
investigate also some books beside him.</p>

<p>After a minute or so he saw Miss Lovelace pick up the bag and
begin to examine it. In an adjacent mirror he covertly kept an
eye on her, and presently, as he had confidently expected, heard
her give a surprised little cry:</p>

<p>"Arthur! Just look!... But no: I don't see that it helps
us..." She turned a charming, friendly, puzzled face to him.</p>

<p>"What did you find?" Arthur asked eagerly, and Pointer
permitted himself to look interested. So did Sewell.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only an advertisement that Violet seems to have cut
out and forgotten," Ann said vaguely. "I found it in this side
pocket of her handbag. It's an offer to buy any specially good
pearls or sapphires...She had such splendid examples of both,
that such an advertised offer would catch Violet's eye, of
course. But she wouldn't cut it out for that. Yet she <i>did cut
it out.</i> I wonder if she thought her stolen string of pearls
had been sold to the advertiser!"</p>

<p>Arthur looked puzzled and disappointed by her "big cry and
little wool." He handed the cutting back to her almost irritably.
"I don't see that <i>that's</i> any help! It's much too far-fetched. Why should Vi connect that with her less valuable string
of pearls? For she didn't know the bigger and much finer string
was missing, or I should have been told of it at once."</p>

<p>"Of course you would have been!" Ann agreed heartily. "I
thought of that too, Arthur, after my first hasty hope that it
might be a really helpful clue. But on reflection there's this to
be thought of: <i>Violet kept the advertisement. Why?"</i></p>

<p>Arthur, however, shook his head with a gesture that had a hint
of fresh impatience in it, but Ann continued:</p>

<p>"For some good reason, you may be sure!" She spoke with
certainty. "Kept it here in her handbag to be able to refer to
it. I feel absolutely certain, Arthur, that she knew something
that suggested a link between her pearls and this rajah's
secretary."</p>

<p>Pointer now requested to see the cutting again. Sewell, too,
studied it with a falling countenance. It looked bad for the
innocence of Mrs. Walsh, his client. To establish her
guiltlessness was his job.</p>

<p>"It's quite a suggestion, Miss Lovelace," Pointer said gravely
to her. "But if Mrs. Walsh had any reason to link this cutting
with her missing necklace it would mean that it appeared
<i>after</i> she knew that she had pledged you an imitation
string."</p>

<p>At his words, Walsh looked the first time as though there
might be something in Ann's idea. She looked from him to Pointer,
and again forgot her mask. For her eyes showed the same exultant,
cruel gleam they had betrayed when they had fallen, earlier, on
the scrap he had just discovered.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," she said lightly. "The date of the cutting
will be quite easy to trace, I should think."</p>

<p>"Quite easy," Pointer endorsed. "It's from the <i>Daily
Wire,</i> I think; or rather, I'm sure. Should it transpire that
there really is some vital connection between it and the wanted
pearls, you'll have been no mean 'link' yourself, Miss Lovelace,
in pointing it out."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" Ann looked as though that tribute would not at all
meet with her approval. "It was Mrs. Walsh who had the cutting
and you who found it, chief inspector. It's nothing to do with me
at all; but if I have chanced on anything that will clear her
name from my mistaken charge against her, oh, I shall be relieved
and thankful, Arthur!" she exclaimed remorsefully, turning to him
with shining eyes, at the sympathy of which he looked deeply
touched.</p>

<p>"Here are some of Mrs. Walsh's letters that should be glanced
through," Pointer interrupted. He himself had already done so.
"Mr. Walsh, would you take them into one of the downstairs rooms
and just run over them? And perhaps Miss Lovelace would help you
with them," he added suggestively.</p>

<p>Ann repeated that she would be glad to help; and the door was
closed behind the two.</p>

<p>Pointer locked it and produced on the instant, from under his
arm, a charming flat lizard-skin pocket. It was Ann Lovelace's.
He had picked it up from a chair where it had accidentally
fallen, and trusted to the circumstance that, with her hands
over-full of papers and envelopes, she would not miss it at
once.</p>

<p>He went through it with dexterous quickness. There were no
bloodstains on it, or on anything in it. But in a closed central
division, separately fastened with its own little catch, was the
same cutting as the one which he had found in the dead woman's
handbag. Replacing this cutting in every way exactly as and where
he had found it, Pointer laid the bag down again where it had
been dropped, unlocked the door of the room and continued his
searching inspection of everything in the room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Ann and Arthur came back with the examined
papers of Mrs. Walsh, none of which, Arthur assured Pointer,
could have any bearing on the case. And Ann, after a startled
expression on catching sight of her own handbag, seized it
hurriedly and went off with Arthur to find out the date of the
newspaper cutting, promising to telephone it at once to the other
two.</p>

<p>Sewell broke the pregnant silence that followed this departure
by murmuring with a frown:</p>

<p>"So Miss Lovelace had a similar cutting! I only hope the
date..." He left the sentence unfinished, substituting: "I wish I
felt as certain of Mrs. Walsh's good faith as Miss Lovelace
is."</p>

<p>"'Is'? Or professes to be?" queried Pointer dryly.</p>

<p>"She did purr a bit, didn't she?" Sewell said disconsolately.
"I'm not so sure about her own good faith as I was. What with one
thing and another, I shouldn't be surprised if Miss Lovelace had
herself contrived, for some reason of her own, to slip the tell-tale scrap into the handbag carried by Mrs. Walsh&mdash;or Miss
Finch&mdash;for it might have been done before the wedding."
Sewell's brow contortions were an index to his perplexed
cogitations as he added: "Chief inspector, do you suspect some
such spiteful trap to eventually snare Walsh's fiance&mdash;or
bride? Or do you believe the latter was responsible for it?"</p>

<p>Pointer, however, refused to be drawn into any more explicit
pronouncement, at this stage of an extremely complicated
investigation, than his tersely non-committal reply: "Either
might be so."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
Evidence Accumulates.</h2>

<p class="first">SEWELL'S professional interests were at issue as
well as his disinterested concern for his friend. The latter
maintained that the cutting only proved what he had claimed from
the first: that his wife had come on something which had linked
the fraudulent necklace directly with Mills's flat, if not with
Mills himself. But Sewell now had disturbing doubts, which must
be settled, pro or con, so that, while he hall-wished that he had
not accepted the commission, the other half of his mentality knew
that he did not want to relinquish the intriguing problem
unsolved.</p>

<p>If the living Violet had been what her adoring husband thought
her, what she had as convincingly appeared to be, at that
luncheon, then that cutting should help him to establish it. It
might, he thought, lead either to Mills or to some one connected
with her mother's circle. For it had been while Violet was again
living under her mother's roof that she had gone on some
suspicion to the Mews, and been murdered in consequence.</p>

<p>Significant, too, was the fact that she had chosen a day for
her visit to the flat when she would have every reason to think
that neither her mother nor Mills would be in it. Mrs. Finch's
theory that her daughter had gone to meet some one else there had
been put forward very quickly. Was it her honest belief? These
were questions that Sewell wanted more light on. And it teased
him, as well as humiliated his professional pride, to think that
what was all fog to him might be fairly clear to the chief
inspector; and that not so much from superior training as from
keener deductive insight.</p>

<p>"Where do you suggest that one should seek for clues, if not
actual evidence, in this case?" he asked him. He did not look for
direct assistance, but it would be well to learn along what
avenues Pointer's intentions were moving.</p>

<p>"I think the two families concerned should be closely studied
as important factors," Pointer answered. But Sewell could not
quite get at the kernel in this nut. He was too tired to crack it
at this late hour, and with a murmured "Good-night" the two
separated.</p>

<p>Next morning Sewell was at breakfast when Pointer rang him up
to say: "I've some news that will interest you. Walsh is still
asleep, his man says, but if you care to come round&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sending instantly for his car, in a very short time Sewell was
seated at Pointer's breakfast-table, where he completed the meal
abandoned at his own place. That speedily done, the chief
inspector handed him a note that he had received a few minutes
earlier. It was from the fingerprint department at Hendon.</p>

<p>"You remember those bits of torn-up paper that were found
around the murdered Mrs. Walsh's feet?" Pointer said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Quite blank, I understood. Weren't they?" Sewell asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I had them tested for fingerprints," Pointer said. "You
can't tear paper up easily with gloves on. And our powder showed
some marks on those."</p>

<p>"Fingerprints! Whose?" exclaimed his listener.</p>

<p>"Four clear fingerprints were found on them and traced to one
of the men working in the garage. But all the others are those of
Mr. Mills," Pointer answered.</p>

<p>"They were bound to be!" interjected Sewell. "His fiat his
prints But what about the garage man? Was there an accomplice in
the murder?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. I have already had a few words with the
mechanic in question, before I met you on the front doorstep
here. I asked him whether any parcels had recently come for Mr.
Mills, and if so, who had taken them in. That torn blank paper
was wrapping-paper. He explained that the three gentlemen living
in the house usually answered their own door-bells. But if they
were out, and parcels or registered letters came, they were left
at the garage with whoever was in charge there at the moment. And
yesterday, he told me, a little package had come for Mr. Mills
from his laundry, about three in the afternoon. The man who
brought it said it was a handkerchief that had been left out of
Mr. Mills's things sent home at the end of last week."</p>

<p>"Around three." Sewell was pale with excitement. "If that's
so...Then how did the paper&mdash;you think it was that wrapping-paper, of course&mdash;but how did it come to have Mills's
fingerprints on it? He says he didn't go over to his flat at all
yesterday until he went there with Miss Kitty and Arthur Walsh at
half-past five."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Pointer replied. "That's the question, and an
important one. Inspector Watts has one of the pieces of paper
with him&mdash;to match it at the laundry, if possible. I rang
them up on the telephone this morning and asked particulars of
the handkerchief sent."</p>

<p>Sewell did not quite see why; but he said nothing. "The
manageress told me that it was of bright blue silk, with large
white spots on it."</p>

<p>"Mills did have one of that description thrust up his cuff
yesterday, when we saw him at his flat!" Sewell threw out his
hand with quite a dramatic gesture. "But that would
mean?"&mdash;his face was all puckers. "How could you prove it
was the same handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Quite possibly he won't be carrying it to-day," Pointer said.
"At least one would expect him to use only subdued colours just
now. And if it can be got hold of, among his things, and the
laundry can recognise it positively as the one they sent home to
him yesterday in the early afternoon by special delivery, Mr.
Mills would need to exercise all his ingenuity to explain it
away."</p>

<p>"If it can be got hold of! But how can it be done?" Sewell
persisted.</p>

<p>"Say a man, claiming to be from the laundry, calls and asks
one of the maids in Ennismore Gardens not to get him into
trouble, but to let him have it back, for it wasn't Mr. Mills's,
but belonged to another customer. He adds that he's bringing back
the right blue and white one instead. Say the maid, touched by
his good looks and his pleading, gives him back from Mr. Mills's
room the one sent to Mr. Mills's flat yesterday. Say the laundry
identify it?..."</p>

<p>"If the laundry identify that handkerchief&mdash;as they
will&mdash;you'll have him!" Sewell exclaimed. "But his alibi? It
was confirmed by the mother of the murdered woman! Are you going
to question her about that, Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Finch is too ill to see any one this morning," Pointer
replied with a very unsympathetic look at his companion. "It
happens to fit in well with some of her commercial
difficulties&mdash;not to be able to reply to questions for some
days&mdash;so I don't think she'll recover in a hurry."</p>

<p>"But surely, to catch her daughter's murderer!" the other
expostulated. "Are you going to arrest Mills, or question him
first?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Question him, assuredly. But at this juncture, only about his
fingerprints in her room," was the firm reply. Which evoked from
Sewell almost a groan.</p>

<p>"Then where, my dear chief inspector, does my commission come
in? That scrap of paper we found, or rather those two scraps,
seemed the first practical suggestion of where to hunt for the
pearls that I've come across yet! And what, may I ask, do you
make of Miss Lovelace's possession of its duplicate?"</p>

<p>"Just what you yourself make of it, I fancy," was the smiling
reply. "For obviously, if Miss Lovelace hadn't found that cutting
in Mrs. Walsh's bag on some previous opportunity, her whole
bearing showed that she knew of its existence; even if she had
not determined that one of the two cuttings <i>should</i> be
found there when we were searching for 'evidence' of any sort
whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Yes; I begin to think Miss Kitty Walsh was right: that Miss
Lovelace isn't the simple transparently kind creature I took her
to be." Sewell's gloom brightened a little as he added the
indulgent rider: "Of course, just now, she's trying to get Walsh
on the rebound from his grief over his wife's awful death. And
she may! He's tremendously touched, I know, by her remorseful
way of sympathising in his determination to hound down her
murderer."</p>

<p>Pointer was now wanted on the telephone. The torn-up paper had
been identified as the same that had been used to deliver the
handkerchief to Mills from his laundry yesterday.</p>

<p>"And the handkerchief will prove that it was in the flat early
yesterday afternoon," Sewell said. "I wonder though...Mrs. Walsh
was here at five. Could <i>she</i> have torn that paper into
bits? Did it also serve to wrap up the pearls? Frankly, Pointer,
I'm at sea! Absolutely at sea!"</p>

<p>Pointer made no comment.</p>

<p>"The date when that advertisement was inserted," Sewell
continued after another gloomy interval, "may get us one step
forward."</p>

<p>"A big one at that," Pointer agreed, "though not necessarily
in the direction you desire, my dear fellow," was his unspoken
reflection before Sewell resumed "And what about Mills's
gloves?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mills's outfit in that respect would seem to have
consisted of two pairs only. Both pairs quite uninteresting,"
said the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"But did one glove look crumpled? As though it had been forced
into an inner waistcoat pocket?" Sewell asked with intense
interest.</p>

<p>"You expect too much. The fault of youth!" was the smiling
response. "Both pairs looked smooth, and very little used."</p>

<p>"Humph!" was Sewell's discontented ejaculation. "But, by the
way, where was Colonel Walsh yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I dropped in late last night at Friars Halt, as I happened to
be in the neighbourhood." Pointer threw in this last explanatory
clause quite casually. It was, however, received with a derisive
grin.</p>

<p>"He spent yesterday afternoon, he says, looking through a very
well-known bulb importer's stock. From half-past three to well
past five."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I don't see Colonel Walsh battering-in the head of
even an unwelcome daughter-in-law," Sewell called over his
shoulder as he hurried off.</p>

<p><br>At the Yard Pointer was informed that Mr. Mills was back
and quite at his service if the chief inspector would like a talk
with him. Upon which Pointer phoned asking Mills to make the
immediate interview in his official room. And when his visitor
was shown in it was with a very haggard countenance that he
seated himself.</p>

<p>Pointer wasted no time in skirmishing. He asked him point-blank how he accounted for the fact that his fingerprints were
found on a drawer of Mrs. Walsh's dressing-table.</p>

<p>Mills stared, and said he couldn't explain it at all, except
that on the day before her return he had noticed that one of the
drawers stuck out, and had thrust it home when Mrs. Finch showed
him the room ready for the young couple. Obviously, he said,
Violet had used the knob when opening and shutting it. As for the
French polishing&mdash;well, evidently the polisher had scamped
his work. It was a possible explanation and it was made with
apparent carelessness. Yet it might be the last talk the chief
inspector could have with him without having to preface it by the
warning which sounds so simple, and which means so
much,&mdash;the warning which a police officer is bound to give
if he thinks the answers to his questions may mean an immediate
arrest, that anything the questioned man or woman says will be
taken down, and may be used in evidence.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Pointer learnt that the handkerchief had
been definitely identified by Mills's laundry as the one sent by
hand yesterday afternoon. The van-man had left it on his way to
his own home, about half-past three; for he had driven away from
the laundry at three and got home at four. And the Mews was
almost exactly half-way by road between the two places.</p>

<p>So now there was definite evidence that Mills had been in his
flat before four o'clock yesterday afternoon; and Mrs. Finch must
be aware that she was giving him a false alibi unless her partner
had misled her in some clever way. Pointer's mind, however, set
that question aside for the moment to concentrate on other
details of Mills's dossier.</p>

<p>Sewell meanwhile had contrived an interview with Miss Kitty
Walsh, in which he told her of Miss Lovelace's change of heart
towards Mrs. Walsh's implication in the false string of
pearls.</p>

<p>"Change of heart!" Kitty shook her head like a mettlesome
little filly. "Change of plan, more like, since she discovered
that Arthur won't tolerate the least aspersion on Violet's good
faith. I think Ann hopes to take her place as his consoling wife
yet." Kitty spoke with careful lightness. "But she hates Violet,
if possible more poisonously than ever. Don't make any mistake
about that! For if you keep that fact before you, and read
everything she says or does by its illumination, you may read Ann
Lovelace correctly. Otherwise you, too, will be her dupe."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty good hater yourself, Miss Walsh," Sewell said
with a grin. "That means a forthright nature."</p>

<p>"It means that I can't stand scheming. I'm a Walsh, too,
remember!"</p>

<p>"Umph! I wish I could be as confident as to my own
professional course towards my client," he said gravely. "I wish
I felt sure that Walsh's fiance and bride was all that he&mdash;"
Sewell checked himself; his monkey's brow knotting itself up over
conflicting responsibilities.</p>

<p>"I believe you're yourself falling into Ann Love-lace's net!"
Kitty expostulated. "Oh, don't let her twist you round her
finger, as she does Arthur, with her sham remorse and devotion to
Violet's good name; her pretended belief, now, that Violet was
honest in pledging those pearls. Which simply means that she
feels she can afford to talk generously because she has all the
strings in her hand, to pull them the way she is after."</p>

<p>"You don't do my supposed intelligence justice," Sewell said
smilingly. "We found something this morning (I don't feel at
liberty to speak out about it), and I myself have a strong
suspicion that Miss Lovelace may have somehow arranged for us to
find it."</p>

<p>"Something that would tell against Violet?" Kitty asked.</p>

<p>"That's still uncertain," he admitted. "But it may! Damnably.
Decisively, as far as I am concerned in the case."</p>

<p><br>Sewell was late for lunch with the chief inspector. But
what he then heard was so enthralling to him that it actually put
even Miss Kitty Walsh out of his thoughts for the time being, as
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"So it is all up with Mills!"</p>

<p>"I don't go as far as that," Pointer replied. "But we know,
now, that he was in his flat before Mr. Walsh found his wife
dead, murdered, there. We know that it was Mills's fingers that
tore into shreds the bits of paper that we found at her feet; and
that the handkerchief we saw in his pocket did not reach his
rooms till half-past three."</p>

<p>Sewell looked at him with a furrowed brow. "But why should he
put those scraps there? <i>Why?</i> They were all blank!"</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply. The question was rhetorical.</p>

<p>"And the marks on the drawer in her room?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his shoes. "They are suggestive, aren't
they," he said. "But his explanation is&mdash;" He gave it, and
Sewell passed a tired hand over his perplexed expression.</p>

<p>There was a ring on the telephone. Pointer was some time at
it, apparently giving and receiving measurements concerning a
carpet, while Sewell bobbed up and down on his chair like a cork
dancing on waves.</p>

<p>"It's about the newspaper cutting," Pointer was beginning,
when he was again interrupted by a telephone calling for the
chief inspector.</p>

<p>"The cutting in Mrs. Walsh's handbag is to the fore," he said.
"The first message to me, just now, was phoned from the Yard. The
second was from Mr. Walsh and Miss Lovelace. Both bring the same
authentic information; and I fear you will not be pleased by
it.</p>

<p>"We learn that the advertisement was originally posted to not
only the <i>Daily Wire,</i> from which the cutting was taken, as
you know, but to all the other big London dailies severally; in
each case with a prepayment enclosed for its insertion daily for
a week, and giving a box number for replies to it."</p>

<p>"And the date when it was posted?" Sewell asked
feverishly.</p>

<p>"Nearly a week before Miss Finch, as she was then, got Miss
Lovelace to advance the money for her gambling debt, giving her
alleged pearls as security for the loan," Pointer said
gravely.</p>

<p>"So my murdered client could well have seen it!" Sewell said
with a face no less significantly grave than was the chief
inspector's.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walsh's message was more than a trifle incoherent,"
Pointer continued. "He says he realises what the facts must
suggest; but begs 'earnestly' to 'suspend judgment for later
data.'"</p>

<p>"Who sent it and paid for the advertisement?" Sewell
asked.</p>

<p>"The sender gave his name as Mr. Elwes Morris,' and the
'Cumberland Hotel' as the address from which he wrote. Each daily
which had inserted it received quite a number of replies. Some
are still being received; although Mr. Morris sent instructions
to each paper to forward nothing more 'as he was leaving.' And he
did leave at the end of his week. Seemed quite the usual hotel
guest, the manager of the Cumberland says. Had no servant with
him, very little luggage, and occupied one of their smaller and
less expensive rooms.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on there?" Pointer asked. They had not finished
lunch, but neither man stayed for that, as they reached for their
hats and gloves. Each wanted to be away before the husband could
catch them up. The husband with his belief in his dead wife about
to receive a final blow.</p>

<p>At the end of a couple of hours' inquiries they were aware
that Mr. Elwes Morris, on leaving the Cumberland, had gone for a
couple of days to the Regent Palace Hotel. He had had many
telephone calls and many visitors at both hotels. He had used
taxis exclusively. Had never dined in either hotel, and never
used the public rooms. He suffered from a bad cold while at both
places and always wore a muffler when passing to and fro.</p>

<p>"Disguised," Sewell said.</p>

<p>The chief inspector nodded vaguely.</p>

<p>"Surely&mdash;don't you think?" Sewell persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." But Pointer added nothing to the monosyllable. They
then discussed the plans for the afternoon. Pointer wanted to go
carefully over the events of yesterday with Kitty Walsh, in case
she had noticed anything more than she had mentioned, and
arranged with her to see her down at Friars Halt later in the
afternoon. Meanwhile he intended to break the news to Mrs. Finch
that the pearls on which she was counting were all imitation, and
that the real ones were missing.</p>

<p>Sewell said that he knew the manager of the bank which Mills
used, and he would try to see if he could glean from him a few
friendly (as distinct from official) facts about the latter.</p>

<p>"And what about Colonel Walsh's alibi?" he asked as he was
rising. "You know he made a selection of some of the newer
daffodils, and then asked to be left alone in the shed where the
commoner sorts of lily bulbs are kept."</p>

<p>"He often does that, it seems," responded Pointer. "Lets
himself out by one of the doors used by the staff, and sends in
his order when he has had time to think it over well and take
counsel with his head gardener. That happened yesterday, it
appears. He was alone from about four o'clock on. No one knows
when he left. He himself says 'close on five'; and that he 'sat a
while in the park afterwards.'"</p>

<p>"No alibi at all then," summed up Sewell. "It's lucky for him
that the Colonel is really beyond suspicion." With which
presumptive certificate Sewell sprinted for his car.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
An Alibi Goes West.</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER phoned to Mrs. Finch, explaining that he
had news about the pearls which she ought to be told immediately.
As he hoped, he was asked to come at once to Ennismore
Gardens.</p>

<p>She was sitting before a writing-table littered with papers.
She looked a very cool, level-headed business woman, not at all a
bereaved mother.</p>

<p>Seating himself beside her, Pointer told her about the real
pearls being, at present, untraceable; about the imitations
substituted in their stead; about the report of the jeweller from
whom they had been purchased; about the advertisement that had
been cut from the <i>Daily Wire;</i> about the fingerprints of
Mills on Violet Walsh's bedroom drawer, and also on the shredded-up scraps of paper found at her feet. "Torn up and strewn there
after she was murdered," he said frankly. "Some of them are lying
on spots of blood, yet none have bloodstains on them."</p>

<p>His aim was to move forward at least one step, by clearing
away the alibi for Mills An alibi which he showed Mrs. Finch was
quite impossible. But she needed no showing. Her face changed as
she heard about the pearls being missing, about the will being
torn up. But when he came to the account of Mills's fingerprints
it turned into the really dreadful face that Mrs. Finch could
show when infuriated. And for a while she sat grasping the
writing-table and swearing under her breath. Then she looked up
at him with flint-like eyes.</p>

<p>"So that was his game, was it! And he's got the pearls?"</p>

<p>The formal warning, quite familiar to Mrs. Finch, as to the
penalty of an evidential accessory, even if only after the act,
could not stem the spate of her mingled cupidity, jealousy and
desperate disappointment.</p>

<p>But she took a deep breath, and a deep drink of whisky-and-soda from a side table, before demanding point-blank:</p>

<p>"Just what do all these discoveries amount to in Scotland Yard
terms, inspector?" To say chief inspector was beyond her impolite
desire to strike.</p>

<p>"So far, seeing only a fraction of the whole as yet," Pointer
began tentatively, with undisturbed official <i>sang-froid</i>,
"it looks though Mr. Mills <i>might</i> have inserted that
advertisement as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" she interrupted, rapidly turning over some of
her papers. "That jeweller said that the imitations were made in
Paris and two days after Arthur bought the two necklaces as his
advance wedding present to Violet, Mills went to Paris on
business, to realise on some gold shares both for himself and for
me. I'm being quite frank with you, you see."</p>

<p>What Pointer saw was a woman who did not know the meaning of
the word, but he made no audible comment and she hurried on
vindictively:</p>

<p><i>"Of course</i> it was Mills who inserted those
advertisements Don't you see that?"</p>

<p>"As I said," Pointer replied, "it looks at present as though
he might have done so, unless he can show an impeccable alibi
covering the time when this Mr. Elwes Morris was at the
Cumberland."</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch's eyes narrowed. "Not likely! And I wouldn't say
there was no jealousy at the bottom of it, either," she muttered
hoarsely, as though to herself. "He used at one time to have a
decided weakness for my daughter. But when, about a year
ago"&mdash;she rubbed an inky finger on her blotting-pad with an
air of dark absorption&mdash;"I found them secretly confabbing
together and taxed them with love-making"&mdash;her eyes, as she
flashed a glance up at the silently attentive chief inspector,
were virtually 'spitting fire' as is said of an angry malevolent
cat&mdash;"they both swore to me that nothing could be farther
from either of them. And as it was just about that time that
Arthur Walsh and Violet fell passionately in love with each
other, why that was that!" Mrs. Finch said with a sweeping
gesture and an enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>"But last evening Mills contrived to meet me on my way to
town, and almost sobbed&mdash;I was too dazed by the news to do
so, even if I were of the cry-baby sort!&mdash;as he blurted out,
without the least consideration for my feelings, as her mother,
that Violet had been found by some one in his flat at the Mews,
<i>murdered!</i> He said that she must have taken my key and let
herself in, or have been let in by some one she had arranged to
meet there. And because I thought the dreadful affair awfully
hard luck on Mills, as tenant of the flat, while he declared the
whole thing&mdash;why she had gone there and 'whom she had met
there and why she was murdered&mdash;a nightmare mystery to him,
as it was to me&mdash;and because, too, I own that I didn't want
my business partner to get into any such trouble innocently (as I
believed, fool and dupe that I was!) just at this juncture in our
commercial affairs, I confess that I promised to secure him from
it by giving him a sound alibi."</p>

<p>She was obliged to pause for breath after rattling all this
off at a rate that would have prevented any word of intervention
from the chief inspector, had he been disposed to say any, as he
was not. But the pause was so far from being for self-control
that she screamed:</p>

<p>"And he was there all the time! Gone to meet her there!
Played the part of the rajah's confidential secretary, probably.
Violet always was a mug! And of course she had the pearls for
him with her! And because she saw through his disguise, though he
is a very clever actor, and recognised Mills himself, he killed
her. And <i>he's</i> got both those strings of splendid pearls
that belong to me now!"</p>

<p>In the silence that momentarily followed, Pointer's first
reflection was that Mrs. Finch at any rate made no doubt but that
her daughter had raised a loan on the imitation string knowing it
to be false, since she had taken the real ones to sell to the
advertised purchaser. But he had his own reasons for breaking the
silence by saying that "Mr. Walsh believes and Miss Lovelace says
she now agrees with him that Miss Finch never suspected that the
string she pledged was an imitation one. Mr. Walsh is confident
that his wife must have gone to the Mews because she was on the
track of the missing string."</p>

<p>"And the newspaper cutting in her bag?" asked Mrs. Finch with
recovered coolness, lighting a cigarette and blowing the smoke
indifferently in the chief inspector's face.</p>

<p>"Put there by some one else&mdash;after she was killed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch seemed to consider this possibility. Then she shook
her mop of coarse, grey-streaked hair. "Can't see it," she said
briefly. "No. Violet and Mills were in the sale of the pearls
together. <i>I'll</i> tell you how the thing was worked." She
pushed her papers away and cocked one thin knee over the other.
"Violet wanted money. She jumped at the chance of selling the
pearls and chancing Arthur's not noticing the difference. So she
sets Mills to get those perfect imitations made in Paris, while
on his business there for me. She tells him to keep his eyes open
for any one who would be likely to buy the real ones from her for
cash, and take them out of England. A foreigner would be best,
she says. Mills thinks it over and sees how he can clear the
board for himself. I don't suppose he meant murder, beforehand.
Though, as I said, he may have had something like it in for
Violet when she fell in love with Arthur Walsh and engaged
herself to him. For Mills is a vindictive devil, and as cunning
as an old fox.</p>

<p>"Violet herself fixes the meeting with 'the rajah's secretary'
at Mill's flat to keep it safe from me as well as Arthur. And I
noticed that Mills was not at all keen on coming down with me.
Didn't I tell you that he really left me just a little after
three o'clock? He tears back, changes in his car, goes to his
flat to meet Vi as the rajah's man, and gets <i>both</i> strings
of pearls. For I shouldn't wonder if he'd already bought the
smaller one outright.</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't want to lose that money!" Mrs. Finch's greedy
eyes were aflame as she cried. "I see what happened about that!
He guessed that she had put it in that old cabin trunk where she
always kept her private papers and special things, even after she
was married. Of course her keys were on her! Catch Violet
stirring a step without them!" Something in the tone told of
black anger. "That's why he came back after he'd killed her; came
here, quietly stepped back after he was shown out, and got that
money too!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch was not smoking now. Her hand was shaking. She was
in a white-hot rage of frustrated, insensate passion. Greed
chiefly but not entirely, Pointer thought.</p>

<p>Her words about having "taxed" her daughter and Mills with
being in love with each other, meant that she would have opposed
it. And something in the eye and tone spoke of jealousy. Real and
unalloyed. She was old enough to be Mills's mother, and Pointer
fancied that Mrs. Finch was only too well aware of that fact.
None the less, he believed her to have been jealous of Mills's
affections going elsewhere.</p>

<p>But of one thing he was sure; she was convinced of Mills's
guilt. She was not merely pretending to a belief in it. And her
story, though frenzied at times, was likely enough, but for the
time factor. It was impossible for Mills to have got into Mrs.
Walsh's bedroom with the keys taken from her handbag <i>after her
death,</i> unlocked the cabin trunk under the bed (however
desperately rapid his work) and turned up at Walsh's house at the
hour given, if both the times that he specified were correctly
stated. About the latter one Pointer thought that there was no
doubt. The servant who had let Mills in, and Walsh himself, were
independently in perfect agreement as to the hour in question.
Incidentally, too, when they traced that telephone call it would
be decisive. Yet the maid had been absolutely certain that she
had heard Mrs. Walsh move and speak, in her own bedroom, at five
o'clock Pointer put his doubt to Mrs. Finch. She instantly asked
him to touch the bell twice; on which her parlourmaid
appeared.</p>

<p>"Look here, Gwendolyn," her mistress said, "I want to get
something quite clear about which this officer and I don't agree.
He says that Mrs. Walsh didn't leave here yesterday afternoon
until after five o'clock. Now isn't that impossible?"</p>

<p>"No, madam, she didn't leave before that," the maid said
earnestly. "Five struck just as I heard Mrs. Walsh in her room. I
was coming down then for my own tea, from my room. And I tapped
on her door to ask if she would like tea. M.S. Walsh called
through the door, 'No, thanks,' and turned on the water, like
Miss Vi always used to do when she didn't want to be disturbed,
you know, madam."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," Mrs. Finch said, frowning thoughtfully.
"Well then, Gwendolyn, we'll let that pass. But it was quite
half-past five before Mr. Mills turned up, and asked for Mrs.
Walsh. That was so, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, madam, it wasn't!" Gwendolyn answered firmly. "It was
just quarter-past the hour. We were waiting in the servants' hall
for the news from North Ireland. Cook always insists on that.
Every day we have to tune-in for North Ireland or there's
trouble. Sickening! Mabel and I wanted the B.B.C. Dance
Orchestra, which is something like! And just as cook says 'There
That's it!' meaning what <i>she</i> wanted, of course, the front-door bell rang, and it was Mr. Mills, who explained that he'd
forgotten his key and wanted to know if Mrs. Walsh was in. Seemed
certain she was."</p>

<p>"And you left him waiting in the drawing-room while you
inquired," finished her mistress, lighting another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, madam! had no call to. Mr. Mills went away at once,"
Gwendolyn replied. "He just said 'I can catch her at the
Grosvenor Square house,' and ran down the steps again and jumped
into his car. I was back in the kitchen the next minute to hear
cook still listening to the news from the auld counthry,' as she
calls it."</p>

<p>"Look here, Gwen," said Mrs. Finch authoritatively, "you've
got things mixed. Now don't start to answer back before I'm done
I say you have. Like you did last week when you vowed you hadn't
so much as seen the new napkins and then found them in the linen-cupboard. And lots of other times, too. I know you mean to tell
the truth, but you're apt to go off half-cocked. Again and again
you declare that the gong has gone for dinner before it's been
touched."</p>

<p>The maid, who had opened her mouth for a swift retort, shut it
with a sheepish grin, contenting herself with an exculpatory:
"And half the time it <i>has</i> gone off, madam. As for those
serviettes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now look here," Mrs. Finch cut her short: "It wasn't five
yesterday when you spoke through her door to Mrs. Walsh about her
tea. It <i>must</i> have been earlier."</p>

<p>But Gwendolyn was not to be shaken on that point. She stuck
both obstinately and consistently to her positive statement; and
on her own showing it would have been at the time she said, when
she was passing down by the bedroom door of the Walshs. And the
housemaid was summoned and bore this out again, as she had
before.</p>

<p>On which Pointer took her in hand:</p>

<p>"It's a question of <i>exact times;</i> and it's a very
important point," he said in his pleasant quiet way. "I'm sure,
Mrs. Finch, that Gwendolyn wants to help us, but I'm wondering if
she might not have fancied she heard Mrs. Walsh speaking; if she
might not have heard just that reply so often before, called
through the door, that yesterday Gwendolyn perhaps took it for
granted that she heard them again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch took out her cigarette and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," the housemaid interpolated, with an apologetic
smile for it, "that's possible, Gwennie often <i>does</i> think
she's been called, when she hasn't been, I mean, if it's about
the time for it. She's always saying the postman's knocked (that
elderly postman who comes of an evening always knocks)&mdash;this
last in an aside to Mrs. Finch, who paid no attention to
it&mdash;"when she's waiting for a letter. And I know she's said
before now that she heard you come in, madam, and then we've
heard you come in later on. Gwennie certainly does <i>think</i>
she hears what it's about time for her to hear. I
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated lamely, and Pointer turned to Gwendolyn herself.
He suggested that the voice she had heard speaking through the
door was some one imitating Mrs. Walsh's voice. Didn't it sound
muffled?&mdash;the two words rather blurred? In answer, and
looking very excited, Gwendolyn exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; it <i>was</i> like that!" The voice she had
heard had had just Miss Violet's&mdash;Mrs. Walsh's&mdash;way of
saying things through the door, "over her shoulder-like, without
stopping what she was doing." But Gwendolyn admitted that the
words she had heard had sounded indistinctly. And, alter a few
further attempts to explain more clearly what she had already
made quite clear, the girl was dismissed.</p>

<p>"Sharp of you, chief inspector (but you look as sharp as they
make 'em ") Mrs. Finch said when the maids had closed the door,
"to spot the probability that it wasn't Violet at all in her
bedroom when Gwen thought she heard her. Not Violet, but Mills,
eh?" Mrs. Finch said coolly. And Pointer's repulsion was deepened
by her unfeeling way of discussing the investigations into the
murder of her own daughter. Whatever Violet Finch had been or
done...could not be wondered at in a child shaped and trained by
such a mother.</p>

<p><br>But having learned what he needed to know, Pointer left
the house in his car, picking up Sewell, as arranged, to tell him
the facts.</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Walsh <i>wasn't alive at</i> five o'clock!" Sewell
exclaimed after hearing them.</p>

<p>"It's rather that we don't know that she was alive then, than
that we have any proof that she was then alive," Pointer said,
"though the doctor is inclined to fix the hour when she was
killed as about four o'clock."</p>

<p>"And so Mills, after all, has no alibi at all for yesterday
afternoon, from three o'clock on! From where he left Mrs. Finch
it would take him only an easy three-quarters of an hour's
driving to reach the Mews. That would give him ample time to
change somewhere on the way into 'Mr. Morris.' He could then be
at his flat in that character by four o'clock; let Mrs. Walsh in
or be let in by her according to their arrangement; murder her,
after getting from her the larger string of pearls; go back to
her bedroom for the money he had already paid her for the smaller
string, if he had done so; or to get that string also if still in
her trunk! But that theory leaves the mysterious telephone call
to Walsh unexplained. That extraordinary telephone call quite
beats me!" Sewell was all agog.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm professionally out of the case, I'm afraid;
since my commission was to clear Mrs. Walsh from any suspicion of
having known that those pearls she pledged were imitations. Well
I All this hardly points in that direction, does it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly doesn't look, so far, likely that Mrs. Walsh, or
Miss Finch as she was then, wasn't up to the neck in the pearls
fraud," Pointer said slowly. "But then, it wasn't likely from the
first, according to Miss Lovelace's story, as Miss Finch herself
endorsed it in writing. And nothing's yet decisively certain, or
proved beyond question. I'm now going to see Mr. Walsh. One of us
two&mdash;you, for choice&mdash;had better tell him what we've
learned. And, by the 'way, how did you get on with the bank
manager! Was he as helpful as you hoped?"</p>

<p>"He was. What he told me fits in with what you, I fancy, think
(and incidentally, what Mrs. Finch thinks, she says) about
Mills's purchase outright of the smaller string of pearls." It
appeared, Sewell continued, that Mills's bank manager, who had
been glad when he closed his account, had said that Mills had had
about three thousand pounds in his current account; and had drawn
it all out on the day before the Receiving Order against Mrs.
Finch was issued, taking it in hundred-pound notes.</p>

<p>"Which he probably changed at various money-changers within
the hour, and then changed back again. It would be worth the loss
since it would obliterate the trail," Pointer said. "We shall try
to trace the notes, of course, but it won't be possible beyond
the first change, I fear."</p>

<p>"And now he's probably got in hand pearls valued around three
thousand pounds as well," Sewell said musingly. "Just double what
he took out of the bank. Well, well! I'm sorry for Arthur Walsh
when he learns what we have got to tell him. Though I shall
underline the possibility of there eventuating the beatification
of his wife when all the facts are discovered and used for her.
In common honesty, however, I must hint that there's some doubt
of that. But, in common humanity, too, I'll mention it as
possible.</p>

<p>"AIM Kitty won't like the news, either. She's been a staunch
supporter of Mrs. Walsh's innocence from the first, you know. And
there is this on her side "&mdash;Sewell paused to eye Pointer
with his face screwed up tightly&mdash;"we both feel sure Miss
Lovelace knew all about that cutting before we had a cleverly-arranged opportunity to find it. I'll eat my hat if that's not
the truth!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>
Marks of Gilding Are Found on a Cloth.</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a fresh arrangement between the two
that Pointer would join Sewell at Friars Halt about an hour
later.</p>

<p>Sewell was shown into Colonel Walsh's study, where he found
the Colonel pacing the hearth. Usually the most courteous of men,
he gave Sewell the briefest of welcomes before, coming to a stop
in face of his visitor and looking at him fixedly, he said,
"Arthur went to you as to a sort of diviner, seer, and so on,
didn't he? Well, what do you divine or see, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the former, sir, and thick fog as to the latter,"
Sewell replied frankly.</p>

<p>The Colonel snorted, his head held high, his restless gaze
roaming the gardens through the windows. "'Fog,' eh? I find it
clear enough! That unfortunate son of mine, Sewell, married a
thorough wrong 'un; and in my humble opinion he's well out of it,
bad as was the way of his unexpected and madly-resented release.
That duping of Ann Lovelace's kind heart&mdash;well, could
anything be more dastardly?"</p>

<p>Sewell held his own head no less high, however, as he replied,
"But, sir, there are two ways of regarding that."</p>

<p>"The way of common sense and the way of its absence!" snorted
the Colonel. "Of course, if you insist, as Arthur does, that if a
black thing's shiny, that proves it's really white, I have
nothing to say."</p>

<p>"You mean, sir, that you take Miss Lovelace's first view of
that pearl transaction?" Sewell asked with an accent of
incredulity.</p>

<p>"Ann Lovelace's first view was the only intelligent view," the
Colonel barked with a grimace as though he smelled bad fish. "And
I say that, whatever caused her death, Arthur's a lucky man to be
rid of a wife like that. Of course, this is confidential, Sewell!
But it's as plain as is the nose on my face."</p>

<p>Sewell's only response was to say, "About those pledged
pearls, I should tell you that it may possibly be proved that
Miss Finch, as Mrs. Walsh was then, had no idea they were expert
imitations."</p>

<p>The Colonel listened with an expression that said, "You poor
dupe" as dearly as words could have said it. But "Indeed?" was
his verbal synonym.</p>

<p>"If some still unsuspected person had stolen the real string
and deftly substituted a prepared copy, Miss Finch might not have
dreamt of either possibility," Sewell ploughed on sturdily.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen Arthur just lately, I believe," the Colonel
said without arguing the other's last postulate. "He's dreadfully
upset. But I think and hope that even he begins to see daylight.
Dimly, perhaps, as yet. And, poor chap, he tries to shut his eyes
to it. But he's found out about the money."</p>

<p>"What money?" Sewell asked blankly.</p>

<p>"The money his fiance banked from the sale of the string she
borrowed on," the Colonel replied grimly. "She had five pounds-odd in her bank balance a <i>fortnight</i> before the wedding,
and one thousand and five pounds-odd exactly a <i>week</i> before
it. And the money was paid into her account in hundred-pound
notes. That smaller string cost just that, Arthur admits. Just
the thousand!"</p>

<p>"How does he himself explain it?" Sewell asked with intense
curiosity and much real feeling.</p>

<p>"Oh, he babbles about lucky at cards,' little scoops at gaming
tables'...where she lost four hundred one night she might have
won a thousand another night...that sort of stuff! But in his
secret heart he must suspect the truth. No, it came from the sale
of the smaller string of pearls all right, Sewell. And, even so,
mind you, she didn't offer to refund to Ann Lovelace her loaned
four hundred pounds. She let Arthur pay that for her without a
whisper of this new money of her own in the bank."</p>

<p>It was a facer. "I suppose the manager let Arthur know about
it?" Sewell asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ann thoughtfully suggested that, as Violet, when she had
borrowed the money, had spoken ruefully of having only a few
pounds left in her bank balance, it would be a pretty idea to
bestow it on some charity in Violet's name. She advised Arthur,
for that purpose, to ascertain the exact amount standing to the
credit of Violet. He did so, poor fellow, and received this
reply. I was in the room when it came; so was Ann. He looked as
though something had hit him hard. No wonder! Something had.</p>

<p>"His first doubt of his adored Violet's innocence. Ann finally
got out of him what the trouble was. Women are clever at such
things. But here he comes. I'm off! Try not to see him, poor lad,
until his senses have somewhat recovered from that stab."
Unlatching the window and stepping through it, the Colonel
extended his long legs to a quick march. And Sewell had an idea
that the father cheered himself on with hope of a marriage much
more to his liking for his son, and was therefore, on the
whole, inclined to think that the murder of Violet Walsh had
simplified things.</p>

<p>As for Arthur, when he hurried in, his hair was wild, his tie
was askew, and he almost barged into Sewell before he seemed to
see him at all.</p>

<p>"I wanted a word with my father," he murmured in excuse. "The
fact is, Sewell, there's some foul conspiracy being worked up
against my poor murdered Violet! Worked up by some devil, Sewell!
And you seem just as powerless as the rest of us to discover him!
Some one's damnably clever damnably!" He broke off in choking
tones and started after his father, but Sewell stopped him with a
persuasive hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, what's happened? Tell me what's happened, Walsh?"
he urged.</p>

<p>For a moment Arthur stood silent. Then he faced his
confidential and chosen investigator squarely, eye to eye, as he
answered: "I asked the manager of my wife's bank to let me know
the exact amount of the small sum her death left standing as her
balance. I got a letter, this morning, informing me officially
that a thousand pounds had been paid in to her credit some
fourteen days ago. Of course, I took the car up and asked to see
the manager himself. The information was correct. Bank notes to
the total of a thousand pounds were paid in to her account in
one-hundred pound notes&mdash;by a lady&mdash;shortly before
closing time, before three o'clock on the date specified.</p>

<p>"The writing on the paying-in slip looks like Violet's, of
course. Shown her photograph, the receiving clerk recognised it
as that of the lady who had handed him the money..." Arthur's
voice stopped for a full moment on this. "Now, either it was
Violet&mdash;and that money wasn't hers at all, but just banked
by her for some other person for whom it was definitely
intended&mdash;or else it was some one cleverly made-up to
resemble her closely, some one wearing her clothes, or much more
likely clothes that were a copy of hers.</p>

<p>"My father, of course, obstinately refuses to see this, but
Ann quite agrees with me. So does Kitty. Personally, I incline to
the idea that some one induced Violet to bank the thousand pounds
in her own name, as a great favour, and gave some quite plausible
reason for the request, and for the absolute secrecy she wanted,
or he wanted, kept about the favour. And if Violet promised that,
Sewell, nothing and no one could have got a word of its betrayal
out of her. She was as straight as..."</p>

<p>"As your father declares Miss Lovelace is," Sewell finished
rather maliciously.</p>

<p>"As Ann <i>is,"</i> Arthur said heartily. "She's a brick, too,
Sewell! I never thought Ann Lovelace could be so true a friend as
she's shown herself to me, these days. And as she is now
remorsefully showing herself to my wife's memory. She was
completely bowled over when I confided to her what was in the
letter from Violet's bank. For she had characteristically
insisted on sharing the bad news in it&mdash;as she had seen that
it must be to account for its effect on me."</p>

<p>"Umph-umph," murmured Sewell with more significance than
sympathy. "Quite! Quite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, like me," Arthur exulted, "Ann saw what must be the true
explanation at once. It takes a good woman to do justice to a
good woman's character."</p>

<p>"Miss Kitty Walsh also has shown herself a staunch friend,"
responded Sewell.</p>

<p>"She has, indeed," was the instant rejoinder. "But, then,
Kitty&mdash;" Arthur paused. "She's an angel, is Kitty," he
resumed. "While, of course, Ann Lovelace is a woman of the world
to her fingertips. That means, she isn't swayed by her heart
only, but by her head even more. Ann's convinced of Violet's
absolute innocence in that pearl pledge, because she realises
more and more how certainly Violet had the kind of nature that
could easily be duped." Arthur fixed Sewell's questioning eyes
with haggard eyes of defence. "Truthful, honourable, loyal...I
don't believe Violet could ever suspect evil in any one around
her. She trusted others as she confidently expected to be trusted
herself."</p>

<p><br>Sewell felt urgent need of some refreshment. His head felt
thick, almost dazed by conflicting thoughts. Passing through the
hall, he and Arthur found Pointer being taken to the library, and
the three men went in together.</p>

<p>"I haven't told Walsh anything of our activities yet," Sewell
said promptly. "I've been hearing many things instead." Here he
turned meaningly to Arthur, who very gruffly and briefly passed
on the new facts about Violet's bank balance. Pointer did not, at
the moment, add to the speaker's evident distress by questioning
him on the subject, only asking for a memorandum of the original
balance, and the date when this had been increased by the said
thousand pounds. But presently, as Arthur's composure was
somewhat regained&mdash;after motioning him to a seat where
eavesdropping would have no opportunity&mdash;the chief inspector
mentioned that there seemed a possibility that it might not, in
reality, have been Mrs. Walsh whom the parlour-maid had heard
moving about and speaking like Mrs. Walsh, in the latter's own
bedroom, at the hour fairly proved to have been five o'clock,
adding the corroborative opinion of the doctor, who was decidedly
inclined to put the hour of the murdered wife's death as "not
later than four o'clock," although he had of course deferred to
what had seemed like indisputable evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>As if unable to contain himself longer on hearing these
startlingly poignant possibilities, Arthur jumped convulsively
out of his chair, pacing agitatedly to and fro as he exclaimed
with clenched hands and blazing eyes, "As I said to Sewell,
there's been some damnable crime against my unsuspecting,
innocent Violet! Those cursed pearls I gave her were at the
bottom of it, I'm afraid. But not the whole of it! Some well-concocted story was told to my poor girl to get her to keep
silent about that thousand pounds she was holding for
somebody..."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the smaller string of pearls were stolen to fit
that amount," Sewell broke in unexpectedly. "I mean by some one
who knew that exactly that amount had just been paid in to her
own credit by Mrs. Walsh at her bank."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect who the criminal is?" Arthur savagely demanded
of Pointer, facing him, hands thrust into his pockets fiercely,
feet well apart, chin thrust forward aggressively.</p>

<p>"Certain things seem to implicate Mr. Mills," Pointer began in
his characteristically calm way, but was interrupted by the
almost maniacal cry:</p>

<p>"Mills! By God! the devil came to me red-handed from her
murder, after searching her things at Ennismore Gardens!" A
slight froth showed on his writhing lips. "No wonder he didn't
want to go back to his flat! But I insisted on his coming with
Kitty and me to see for himself that the phoned message was a
hoax. It was well for him that I thought so then. I'll never,
never forgive myself for that! But..."</p>

<p><br>But before his choking voice could continue, the door
opened and Kitty Walsh entered. Pointer, if not Sewell, was very
sorry to see her at that tense moment. But she came at his own
request for a fresh going over of her memories, and he could not,
therefore, ask her to postpone the interview.</p>

<p>He went through yesterday very carefully with her, and Kitty
did her best to recollect each incident, however small, after she
had met Mills at Grosvenor Square, until she remembered the room
swinging round her as she saw Violet's head. She was foggy after
that. The next thing she, remembered at all was putting down a
glass of water which some one had first held to her lips and then
put into her hand. She was sitting up by that time, on a chair by
the door&mdash;with her back to the fireplace&mdash;she added
with a shudder. She remembered putting down the glass of water
and spilling most of it&mdash;it was very full&mdash;and then Mr.
Cook helped her up on to her feet and down the stairs to the open
front door. After that Kitty's recollections, she said, could add
nothing more, and certainly nothing to what the three men already
knew. Pointer acquiesced, but nevertheless put one more
incidental question, namely: "Can you remember the colour of the
tablecloth on the little table you recollect spilling the glass
of water on?" But, although Kitty willingly searched her mind
back to the incident of the water spilled weakly on the table,
she could not remember about the cloth on it, except vaguely that
she had felt one there.</p>

<p>But at this point in the reconstruction Arthur broke in with
excited eagerness to assist in even so seemingly trivial a
detail: "Sewell! I remember that little table-cover perfectly! It
was a square thing, about the size of a large table-napkin, I
should say, with bright red-and-blue checks on it. And, by Jove,"
he ejaculated with mounting heat as if there might be some
inexplicable clue in the point, "if you look at your police
photographs of the room, chief inspector, you won't find any
cloth whatever on that little table by the window, but you'll see
the ash tray still on it that stood in the centre of the red-and-blue checked square when Kitty and Mills and I entered the room.
Its crude colours caught one's eyes before any of us saw the body
of my Violet."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "No cloth. Just the tray," he confirmed.</p>

<p>"Then how in the world did you <i>know</i> that there had been
a tablecloth on it at all?" Kitty asked him in a tone of absolute
awe at such second sight. But Pointer only looked mysteriously
wise; and Arthur broke in again.</p>

<p>The absorbing interest for him lay in the fact, not in the
detective certainty or lucky guess, of the chief inspector, and
his voice was shrill as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Then in that brief moment of my going to telephone to the
police"&mdash;the telephone was in the hall, they all
knew&mdash;"Mills must have switched away the cloth, replacing
the tray carefully on the table, and stuffed it heaven knows
where! Inside his coat, possibly, though it was by no means a
mere pocket-handkerchief."</p>

<p>"There is such a table-square as you describe, sir, in a
drawer of the kitchen dresser in the basement," Pointer said
slowly.</p>

<p><br>"But what on earth could be Mills' reason?" Arthur asked,
as though of the Heaven above him.</p>

<p>"One explanation might be that there was some mark or stain on
it that Mr. Mills didn't want noticed..." And the chief inspector
fell silent, his eyes on his shoe-tips.</p>

<p>"When is he to be arrested?" Arthur asked thickly.</p>

<p>"He has been requested to come to my rooms at the Yard in two
hours' time from now. And if he cannot or does not give a
satisfactory explanation of everything he will be detained while
further investigations are being made."</p>

<p>"Detained! You mean arrested? Hung?" Arthur cried with leaping
eyeballs.</p>

<p>"Arrested, quite possibly, Mr. Walsh. Hanging. I am thankful
to say, lies with jury and judge. But, by the way, I asked you to
think very carefully over that strange telephone summons you
received. Has nothing explanatory occurred to you in connection
with it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, chief inspector. Absolutely nothing that could shed
the faintest ray of light on that weird message." And of this
whole terrible mystery that most tragically-appropriate yet quite
misunderstood summons seems the most expressive silence of common
cogitations until Arthur drove away gloomily, after receiving a
nod from each of the others in response to his parting request to
be "kept posted."</p>

<p><br>"How in the world, chief inspector, could even your wits
know about that absent cover on the little occasional table?"
Sewell exclaimed with keen curiosity when they were again <i>en
route</i> in the car.</p>

<p>"Miss Kitty Walsh told us, you remember, that in her still
faint condition she upset almost a tumblerful of water over the
top of that table," Pointer answered conclusively, and seemed to
think that he had given a complete explanation of his knowledge.
But not so Sewell, who asked, with friendly exasperation: "Well?
What of it?" Only to be countered with the question:</p>

<p>"What became of all that water?" With the quizzical rider:
"It's my particular business, you know, to see that nothing gets
lost in a case."</p>

<p>Sewell laughed. "You mean that the top of the little table
wasn't noticeably wet, only a few minutes later?"</p>

<p>"I mean, on the contrary," Pointer said significantly,
"that&mdash;having put down some papers on it, when entering a
note on one of them&mdash;I had especially seen to it that the
table top was perfectly dry. And as the most impassioned tidiness
would not have stopped to dry it at such a time, it is obvious
that the water must have been absorbed by a tablecloth of some
sort which was no longer there, had been evidently taken away so
scrupulously as to replace the ash-tray without it."</p>

<p>"Bloodstained, somehow, of course," Sewell said sapiently, but
without his usual shrewd judgment.</p>

<p>"And the Yard's men wouldn't have noted and listed that?"
Pointer commented sceptically. Adding what aroused the other's
detective interest afresh: "Nor would bloodstains on it have
mattered unless actual fingerprints."</p>

<p><br>Sewell felt himself swimming in deep waters and a little
out of his depth with this man's wide-sweeping intelligence,
until Pointer continued: "Since there was so much blood about in
the room, spots on the little tablecloth wouldn't have meant any
added danger, unless they were actual fingerprints in blood. And
that there could have been not the least vestige of, or they
would have been listed when the cloth was seen in the kitchen
drawer.</p>

<p>"But if not blood-prints," Pointer, as a rare token of
profound concentration debated aloud with himself, "what could
there have been about that little tablecloth which Mills&mdash;if
it was Mills, as I think&mdash;knew must point to him? Just as
the original bits of paper undoubtedly did."</p>

<p>"Eh???" came in almost a screech from the rapt Sewell.</p>

<p>"Or probably' did," Pointer conscientiously amended. "From the
first, that seemed their only explanation. Though why he strewed
them where we found them does beat me as yet, I confess. But that
carefully-removed tablecloth? No fingerprints of any kind were on
it, I know for certain. Inspector Watts examined that cloth
himself. Of course, I shall look it over, too, if it is still in
existence. By my instructions nothing has been sent to the
laundry from the house. But&mdash;what?" The chief inspector
stared straight ahead of him as a red signal pulled his car
up.</p>

<p>"Even <i>you,</i> surely, chief inspector, can't possibly hope
to guess what it could have been?" Sewell gasped, with the zest
of a boy.</p>

<p>Pointer's eyelids narrowed to the glittering slit of a chamois
hunter searching the distance for his prey as he said resolutely,
"We both believe that Mr. Mills was alone in that room where Mrs.
Walsh&mdash;your client, as it were&mdash;was killed. Then follow
him, Sewell, in your mind, as I am following him in mine. Nothing
there, that we know of, to mark him, except blood; and I'm not
looking for blood. The fire is electric. Nothing wet. Besides
water wouldn't give anything away. No! If there is a clue to him
on that little tablecloth he put it there on returning to the
room with Mr. Walsh and Miss Kitty Walsh He may have grasped the
little table on which it lay; perhaps as Mr. Walsh sprang to the
body of his murdered wife. And by that clutch he left&mdash;I
think&mdash;some smear or mark, which linked the cloth
with&mdash;what? With himself? How could it? Mr. Mills follows no
pursuit or trade that carries its stamp.</p>

<p>"Then did it link up in some way with where he had been? Now,
take the trail afresh with me, Sewell, and follow him leaving the
place. He slipped down the stairs; nothing there. And out through
the front door; nothing there. Besides, even if there had been
seas of fresh paint, he would have a perfect right to fresh paint
on his hands from his own front door, seeing that he passed
through it again with Miss Kitty Walsh and Mr. Walsh when he went
back with them.</p>

<p>"No, it's something linking the tablecloth, the room, with
some place with which it must on no account be linked! His
office? But anything linking them with himself, or his own place,
would pass without question, just as his ordinary fingerprints
would and did.</p>

<p>"I can only think of one spot with which Mr. Mills wouldn't
want his flat linked&mdash;and that spot was Mrs. Walsh's
bedroom, the bedroom that he searched, we think, on his way from
his flat to Mr. Walsh's own house. Now was there anything
<i>there</i> that might leave such a stain or token on his left
hand that, when he pulled off his gloves in his flat, might mark
that little tablecloth&mdash;if he took hold of it&mdash;and
leave traces of something only to be found in Mrs. Walsh's
bedroom? Powder? Scent? But she was killed in his flat! So
anything of hers found there would not be remarkable, could be
explained, one would think..."</p>

<p>Suddenly Pointer's eyes gleamed. He had seen his chamois. "The
radiator! Did you notice the radiator by the door of her bedroom,
Sewell? No? Well, it was still quite tacky with fresh gilding
yesterday. It had been a forgotten order, when this room was got
ready for the Walshs; and the fresh gilding was hastily done the
very day of their arrival, Mabel told me. There is a wall recess
just there, and the tackiness, therefore, was not likely to be
noticed. But let any of that gilding get on to the tablecloth in
Mr. Mills' flat, and&mdash;since there was no touch of it on the
murdered bride herself&mdash;it would be exceedingly difficult to
account for its presence there.</p>

<p>"Yes, it could be gilding, unconsciously adhering to Mr.
Mills' hand and betrayingly impressed on the little tablecloth in
his flat if he had chanced to unluckily transfer it by taking
hold of the cloth, for any reason, with a feverishly-hot
pressure. It <i>could</i> be just that!"</p>

<p>The chief inspector drove his now speechlessly-admiring
professional disciple hurriedly to the Mews, where both men had
the delight of finding the decisive evidence almost uncannily
testifying to Pointer's genius for detective reasoning. For the
little tablecloth which Arthur had accurately remembered was
still guarded in the locked kitchen drawer at the Mews, and on it
was a conspicuously incongruous but quite immovable splotch of
the same fresh gilding as was on the radiator in what had been
the bedroom of Violet Walsh.</p>

<p>"And now," Pointer said quietly to Sewell, carefully enclosing
his trophy in a sealed, labelled and duly witnessed large
envelope, "we reach the vital core of this evidence: namely,
<i>how and why</i> Mr. Mills got that identical gilding on his
hand. To me it seems obvious that, in his frightful haste, he
must have let something fall behind that re-gilt radiator, the
tackiness of which his excitement did not let him notice while
his hand frantically sought the dropped object behind or under
it."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>
Another Possible Motive Is Discovered.</h2>

<p class="first">"COULD it be a pearl which broke off and rolled
under the radiator?" Sewell suggested when they were off again
for Ennismore Gardens. But the chief inspector reminded him that
Mr. Walsh had had the pearls all freshly restrung for his wedding
gift, although it was, of course, quite possible that the smaller
string had been caught on something and too hastily jerked
free...</p>

<p>Pointer had telephoned from outside the garage to the Yard for
a detective-mechanic; and one was waiting for them at the
house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch was out. So was Arthur. The three men went up
together to the bedroom. Again its door was unlocked and re-locked behind them, and in a brief time the mechanic had the
radiator out into the room.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen behind it, Sewell thought in great
disappointment. But Pointer discovered, on an elbow formed by the
bend of the feeding-pipe, a little gold ring that looked, to less
keenly-searching eyes, like a bit of the gilding. It was
unmistakably a wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Nothing else rewarded a thorough hunt, and the radiator was
accordingly returned and fixed in its recess, the mechanic
departing as soon as that was done. The little 22-carat gold
circle was then closely examined. But there was no inscription in
it, no date.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Walsh is the only woman connected with the case, so far,
whose finger it would fit," Pointer felt sure. "Her wedding-ring
is at the Yard." He tagged this one securely, and the mechanic
had carried a message from Pointer to another of the Yard's
men.</p>

<p>"Could she have been married before? To Mills, do you think,
chief inspector?" Sewell gasped. "And was Mrs. Finch
right&mdash;that mad jealousy as well as the pearls was the
motive? Or was it just a week-end ring?" he debated
alternatively.</p>

<p>"I don't believe that Mr. Mills would have tried to get it out
again if it had been only that last," Pointer replied. "He was in
great danger of being found here, or seen coming out of this
room. Under the circumstances, I don't think he would have hunted
for it at all unless it had been, or seemed to be, of vital
importance to him.</p>

<p>"This ring suggests that the cabin-trunk under the bed may
have contained&mdash;" Pointer's voice fell away into the silence
of profound thought; but Sewell made an imploring gesture, and he
responded: "I think it might have been a wedding-certificate that
took Mr. Mills here&mdash;quite apart from any question of the
pearls," he finished. "And I am sending a reliable man to search
the registers for a possible previous marriage of Violet
Finch's."</p>

<p>"That Mills felt that he must secure that ring," Sewell said,
"is proof enough that he was her murderer&mdash;absolute proof, I
say. Who else but the murderer would have known that her things
would be searched, and that the discovery of this ring would
follow unless he recovered it first? That it would point directly
to him and his motive, his additional motive? For undoubtedly
there was raging jealousy there, as well as greed. If there was a
marriage, was it in her own name? I wonder, and was it legally
dissolved?" he speculated on. "By Jove, this <i>is</i> a <i>volte
face</i>, and one that will break Arthur Walsh's heart, poor
fellow!"</p>

<p>"But not his father's heart," Pointer said.</p>

<p>"Rather not! Colonel Walsh'll burn a special row of candles to
his patron saint," Sewell replied with a smile, adding dolefully,
as he saw Pointer getting into his official car: "This is where
the amateur gets bumped off, chief inspector. Oh, I know that I'm
dining with you to-night; but I've got to live unsatisfied till
then, worse luck!"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know if anything of importance turns up,"
Pointer answered consolingly; "but I don't think it will. One of
my men will start at once to hunt through the registers at
Somerset House, and I must hurry back for an appointment with Mr.
Mills."</p>

<p><br>At the Yard, the discovered ring was found to be exactly
the same size as the one taken from Violet Walsh's dead hand.
Pointer had felt sure that it would prove so, after his first
look at it; and he locked both away as Mr. Mills was announced.
He was immediately ushered in, looking quite calm and unruffled.
But at the chief inspector's opening the interview with the
obligatory warning, Mills' lips blanched. Not so his sunburned
cheeks, however. Pointer had suspected their deep tan at sight.
To the warning Mills offered no real protest&mdash;although he
seemed astonished by it. And the chief inspector passed at once
to an outline of the case that Mills would have to face. He began
it with Mills' surreptitious visit to the Walsh's bedroom before
his open return to the house when he rang at the front door and
next went on to Grosvenor Square. The official recapitulation
finished with the fact that Mills was confidently believed to be
the man who had played the part of the hypothetical Rajah's
"secretary," after inserting the advertisements under that
head.</p>

<p>Mills denied everything. The sweat was standing on his face in
grotesquely brown beads. He wiped it away at once, but instantly
stuffed the handkerchief with which he did it into his pocket.
After that he preferred to suffer the discomfort, rather than the
greater embarrassment, and let the oddly swart drops trickle
where they would, winking them out of his eyes. Pointer did not
tell him of the finding of the wedding-ring, with its allied
facts and sinister implications. They were kept in reserve for
the moment.</p>

<p>"You're all mixed up, chief inspector," Mills finally declared
with an effort at bravado. "All this story about the pearls and
the advertisements&mdash;" But Pointer stayed these hollow
protests with stiff questions as to dates and hours when "Elwes
Morris" was known to have been at one or other of the two hotels.
And here Mills came off very badly. He blustered about having
purposely avoided people because of the financial trouble in
which he and his partner, Mrs. Finch, were involved; but he was
unable to clear himself in respect of any of the specific points
which Pointer took him over very carefully because of their
importance to the issue, and he was consequently told that he
would be detained pending further inquiries about the pearl
necklaces.</p>

<p>At this Mills shouted, "What for? What for?" in a sort of
frenzy. "You <i>know</i> that there was another man in my rooms
that day! You can't deny that, no matter how you try. The man who
telephoned to Walsh while I was at Grosvenor Square. His wife was
alive then, at five-thirty&mdash;if that's what your talk of 'the
pearl necklaces' means!"</p>

<p>"That conclusion doesn't necessarily follow, Mr. Mills,"
Pointer said coldly. "But you are not detained on a charge of
murder."</p>

<p>Mills said no more. And he was conducted from the room with
despair in his eyes.</p>

<p><br>Pointer sat on fixedly, looking straight ahead of him as
he pondered&mdash;

<p>That strange message...! And 'Father Walsh' still in his
religious Retreat...! It was sent at half-past five...If
Pointer's theory was right, Violet was murdered by the time it
reached Arthur Walsh. Then why was it sent? Was it possible that
the secret search in Violet's room was done at her own
instigation...? That she was selling her pearls to the Rajah
"secretary," Pointer thought might be taken as a fact...</p>

<p>Here his coiling and uncoiling debate was actively
interrupted. His man entered. He had found the record of a
marriage in a registry office, some fourteen months ago, "between
Violet Finch, spinster, of Ennismore Gardens, and Herbert Mills,
bachelor, of Green Street Court, Mayfair." The witnesses had
evidently been provided by the Registry Office in question.</p>

<p>So the murdered bride was really not Walsh's wife at all! But
at her death still the undivorced wife of Mills! This amazing and
fundamentally prime news was phoned to Sewell in their arranged
code, and he lost no time in speeding to the chief inspector and
eagerly accepting his invitation to accompany him on his proposed
interview with Mrs. Finch&mdash;or Mrs. Gray, to give her the
rightful title consistently ignored by herself and every one
else.</p>

<p>The interview was indeed cyclonic when Mrs. Finch was told the
unquestionable facts just ascertained. The news&mdash;if it was
really unsuspected news&mdash;that her murdered daughter had died
as the wife of the impecunious Mills and not as that of the
wealthy and wealth-inheriting heir, Arthur Walsh, sent the
unbridled woman into so extraordinarily violent a rage as to make
Pointer eye her speculatively, to Sewell's keenly interested
observation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Finch, in her uncontrollable fury, raged and looked as
though she herself would willingly have torn Violet limb from
limb had she been still alive. What was more, from the chief
inspector's concerned point of view, she hurled to his adroitly
probing questions some furious replies which for the first time
revealed the variously gravid circumstances that she had not only
induced Arthur to settle five thousand a year on Violet, but had
also wrung from the latter, privately, a legally executed
document endowing her mother absolutely with one thousand a year
from the date of her daughter's marriage to Arthur. While at the
same time Arthur had signed a will leaving everything he
possessed, or was entitled at the time of his death, to Violet
absolutely&mdash;should he predecease her and there be no
offspring of their marriage.</p>

<p>Learning these facts and seeing that evil face, Sewell began
to share the Colonel's belief that Violet Finch's death had
really been a blessing for Arthur Walsh. Now, however, even that
consolation was enlarged, for Violet had never been his
wife&mdash;the settlements were null and void...! Pointer, too,
privately thought that Mrs. Finch would have delighted to hang
Mills with her own hands. "Just as well he's in safe keeping!"
Sewell said as they left the woman figuratively, if not also
literally, foaming at the mouth. "She'd have his eyes out, at
least, otherwise."</p>

<p>"Yes," Pointer agreed meditatively. "Odd!"</p>

<p>"Why 'odd?' She looks '<i>capable de tout</i>.'"</p>

<p>"The way she takes it is odd, none the less," Pointer said.
"As though she herself had been sold, somehow."</p>

<p>"The wedding was quite a gala affair, but I understand from
the solicitors that it was Violet who had to sign for
everything," Sewell said with a grin. Then he looked up to add:
"You know, I'm somehow convinced that Miss Kitty Walsh feels
certain that Ann Lovelace is a hostile element. That's in
confidence, of course. But where does she come in?"</p>

<p>"Miss Walsh is rather prejudiced against Miss Lovelace,"
Pointer replied absent-mindedly. "We know she strongly sided with
the supposed Miss Finch," he added; "and I'm afraid she backed
the wrong horse there. Though possibly Miss Lovelace meant to and
did lay a trap for the supposed Miss Finch over that loan on the
accepted pearls as security."</p>

<p>"You mean she knew they were imitation? You think both young
women knew it, and that each believed she was besting the other?"
Sewell persisted.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "Looks rather like it. Miss Lovelace has some
very fine pearls of her own, I'm told. I think she may have hoped
to do just what she did do: go to Mr. Walsh with the proof of his
fiance's dishonesty."</p>

<p>"And he, poor chap, nearly knocked her down for daring to cast
a doubt on his adored Violet." Sewell's tone changed eloquently
as he concluded with keen interest: "I wonder what Arthur Walsh
will say about it."</p>

<p>So did Pointer privately. And the other resumed: "The Colonel
was not far off the mark, though too sweeping altogether, in
declaring that 'a liar is always a trickster.' I wonder if the
pseudo Mrs. Walsh cared for Mills all the time in her heart of
hearts? And yet, you know, she seemed to me just a lively, frank,
rattle-brain&mdash;too completely unsophisticated to hide a
thought."</p>

<p>But Pointer was obliged to drop Sewell and his reflections, at
this point, and hurry back to the Yard. He found nothing new
there, however, except a confirmation of Mr. Gray's alibi for
every day <i>except yesterday&mdash;the</i> one day that
mattered. Yesterday he had driven from Manchester up to Town in
the morning, had lunched some business men at the Holborn Grill-room, but he had just strained his wrist, he told Pointer's man,
and had driven out to Richmond after lunch to see a doctor friend
of his, but Gray had found the sprain so much lighter than he had
feared that, tired with his drive up to Town in a troublesome
car, instead of troubling his friend, he had had a good sleep in
a quiet corner of the Park, driven back to Town, found his wrist
hurting afresh, left his car at a garage in Euston Road, at a
little before six o'clock, and gone back to Manchester by the
six-ten train. The only confirmation obtainable, therefore, was f
or the hours that were not suspect at all. He had lunched where
and when he said, left his car where and when he said, and as he
had not taken a ticket, but had paid in the train, it could be
proved that he had returned to Manchester at the time that he
said that he had. All the rest hung on his own assertions.</p>

<p>Pointer sent in this report to be duly filed, and ordered a
swift car. He wanted to get down to Friars Halt at once for a
crucial interview with Mr. Walsh.</p>

<p>At its opening, Arthur began a half-hearted assertion that
Violet had been cleverly impersonated. But after that one
interpolation he listened in a tense silence till the chief
inspector had finished. And then he literally raged. For a while
he was like a madman, laughing insanely, great roars of laughter
that rang through the house.</p>

<p>His father hurried in to ask what was going on.</p>

<p>"Ask <i>him</i>!" Arthur ejaculated, indicating Pointer. "Good
God, Pater, what a priceless dupe I've been! 'My fiance!' 'My
wife!' There never <i>was</i> such a person!" And again came a
burst of wild laughter as he left the two others alone, slamming
the door behind him as it assuredly had never been slammed since
it was first hung on its stout hinges.</p>

<p>Pointer quietly explained all the amazing facts about Violet
Finch's secret marriage to Mr. Mills. The Colonel did not hide
his heartfelt joy at the authentic news that he and his were free
from any legal connection with "the detestable Finches," alive or
dead, before going upstairs for a private word with Arthur.
Pointer waited, in case Mr. Walsh should want to see him
again.</p>

<p>But the Colonel came back alone. He did not tell the chief
inspector that his son lay actually sobbing on his bed.
Contenting himself with the message that the latter felt quite
unable to continue so painful an interview at the moment. Adding:
"But at any rate he's cured. The savants are quite right who say
that love is a disease.' Love like that my unhappy son lavished
on that creature certainly was more an infatuation than normal
falling in love. He's all broken up by it. And no wonder! Even
my niece, Kitty, will find it, I fear, a great shock. She really
liked her!"</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace, too, seemed quite won over, sir, to the same
attitude," Pointer replied.</p>

<p>On which Colonel Walsh shrugged his shoulders with a slight
smile, as he observed judicially: "I think that was perhaps
carrying <i>noblesse oblige</i> rather too far. Ann, I imagine,
was so afraid of being not only unsympathetic to my son, but
unjust to his idol, that she was swept over to the warmth of a
partisan. But in her heart she never lost, I think, the same
innate aversion to the daughter of the notorious 'Mrs. Finch'
that I openly felt. And which Arthur must feel now, chief
inspector. For no one can now, surely, do more than shudderingly
pity the tragic opening-up of the secret history of the
murderer's victim. I suppose it was some jealous quarrel with her
and her actual husband?</p>

<p>"Or was it more likely for the pearls? My son maintains that
she must have bribed Mills to keep silent with one of the
strings. I suppose that's quite possible. Anyway, it's a most
creditable and clever piece of work on your part, chief
inspector," the army man said warmly, "to have unearthed the
truth and arrested the murderer within four-and-twenty hours of
the murder. A brilliant achievement!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Mills isn't under arrest, sir," Pointer corrected. "And
unless we can get more incontestable evidence of guilt, the
Public Prosecutor would not sanction such an extreme step."</p>

<p>"You mean that he may still slip out of your net?" The
Colonel, who was not a vindictive man, looked rather relieved as
he acknowledged: "I can never really approve, in my own mind,
chief inspector, of any man swinging for an utterly worthless
woman's removal," he owned confidentially.</p>

<p>Pointer did not care to argue this extremely dangerous public
question, although his own convictions, based on long
professional experience were that an unhung murderer will murder
again to satisfy his own particular passion of the
moment&mdash;whether revenge or jealousy or mere greed. And just
then Arthur Walsh came back to join his father and Pointer,
looking a physical wreck from shock and sorrow. Sewell, too, was
ushered in at the same moment.</p>

<p>He held out his hand to Arthur, nodding to the other two in
the room, saying simply to his friend and quondam employer for
the murdered woman's defence: "I can't tell you how sorry I
am..." he began.</p>

<p>Arthur gripped his hand hard, with a muttered, "It's all over,
Sewell! Finished!" And then, with a gleam of his previous
wildness, he fairly shouted, "I never want to hear her name
again! She cheated me from start to finish; poor fool and tool
that she made of me!"</p>

<p>"But what about the missing pearls, Walsh?" his friend said
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I want them found! Stolen booty that they
were!" Arthur said with energy. "The murderer was in the plot,
and rounded on his partner&mdash;evidently. You must recover them
for me at whatever cost, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>Sewell looked beyond him as he answered firmly: "Sorry, but of
course, as I take none but purely <i>defensive</i> commissions,
you know, I can't take that one."</p>

<p>"You mean you won't aid me to recover those two extremely
valuable necklaces, given only as a wedding gift?" Arthur
exclaimed in a really scandalised as well as wounded tone.</p>

<p>"Professionally speaking, no," Sewell answered flatly. "But I
confess I should like to know what follows, Walsh. For instance,
I keenly want to understand that strange telephone message to
you," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>So do I!"</i> came emphatically from Arthur; and Colonel
Walsh echoed him.</p>

<p><br>They all three looked inquiringly at Pointer, who had
picked up a book and was standing turning its pages. He laid it
down. "It's by Superintendent Hatherly," he said apologetically.
"Quite a textbook on the ruses used by some of the cleverer
criminals. But about that telephone message, Mr. Walsh. The
Reverend Father Walsh is still out of laymen's reach at all
events, in his religious Retreat. Yet the call just mentioned has
been definitely traced to him. Otherwise, of course, Mr. Mills
would seem the most likely sender."</p>

<p>"Ambrose never sent it," Arthur said decisively. "There's some
error in that identification. The man or woman who did send
<i>it&mdash;must</i> have been an accomplice. Mills was upstairs
in the drawing-room; and as yet there's only one telephone in the
Grosvenor Square house. So that lets Mills out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was in the drawing-room?" Pointer asked with surprised
emphasis. "Mr. Mills said that he was in the library; and when I
repeated that statement to you, Mr. Walsh, you did not correct
it."</p>

<p>"I suppose I was thinking of something else. God knows I had
horrors enough to occupy my mind!" Arthur replied with savage
brusqueness. "At least, they seemed like horrors to me at the
time. But what iota of difference to Scotland Yard can it make to
know in which particular room he was? He was in the house, and so
where he couldn't have used the telephone. Surely the only detail
of importance."</p>

<p>The Colonel cocked his eye inquiringly at the chief inspector,
who was looking at Arthur as though he were decidedly interested
by what he had just learnt.</p>

<p>"It might make all the difference in the world, Mr. Walsh,"
Pointer observed. "There's a telephone extension in the drawing-room at Grosvenor Square, but none in the library, if I'm
right?"</p>

<p>"Quite right. But, again, chief inspector, what difference
does that make?"</p>

<p>"Did the Exchange ask you what number you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not until I had been given that message."</p>

<p>Pointer's eyes went to the corner.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a telephone," Colonel Walsh said, keenly on the
alert. "And here, just as in the Grosvenor Square house, there
are extensions to the drawing-rooms upstairs, and to the bedrooms
above that again."</p>

<p>"Then I'll show you gentlemen how that message could have been
sent."</p>

<p>Pointer stepped to the corner. In a trice the Colonel showed
him the instrument. Pointer lifted it and called up the Yard, to
which he sent a code message. Then he put down the receiver.</p>

<p>"Now, if I may, I'll go upstairs to the extension in the
drawing-room. And I want you, Mr. Walsh, to answer the phone when
it rings. It will be a call from the Yard, yet you'll hear the
same message that you heard once before, the one that has puzzled
us, only this time it'll be repeated in my voice. For, unlike Mr.
Mills, I shall not try and disguise it by a foreign accent."</p>

<p>Pointer was shown upstairs. A moment later the telephone rang.
Arthur answered it in record time. And he heard, to his
amazement, the voice of the chief inspector speaking, and giving
word for word the message which had so startled him before. And
as then it was followed by the voice of the Exchange asking what
number he wanted. Arthur was too puzzled to reply.</p>

<p>"Hang up," came again in Pointer's voice, and Arthur did
so.</p>

<p>Another moment and Pointer was back in the room.</p>

<p>"How's it done?" Arthur asked in sheer stupefaction.</p>

<p>"If the telephone rings," Pointer explained, "and some one in
the room where there is an extension takes off the receiver at
the same instant as you do down here, then, should you by any
chance be disconnected at the Exchange, and if that some one
speaks through at once, his words would reach you as though it
were spoken by the person who had rung up. I fancy Mr. Ambrose
Walsh was disconnected before he spoke one word. That would be
sheer chance, of course, and Mr. Mills snatched at the chance to
get his message through to you, speaking as I did, into the
extension in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Bravo, chief inspector! Well played indeed!" came admiringly
from Colonel Walsh.</p>

<p>"So that is the explanation of the message that suggested that
another man was, or had been, in Mills' flat!" Sewell thought
that Mills had been very quick witted. "But why summon Walsh to
find her dead?" He decided to refer to Violet as "she," and
"her." He gazed speculatively at Pointer. "You thought it might
be some one who wanted to be sure that they would be able to
search the Ennismore Gardens house undisturbed by Walsh. But if
it was Mills who sent the message, he had already gone over the
bedroom at five."</p>

<p>"The murderer rarely wants to be the one to find the body,"
Pointer said, "unless there is some very special necessity for
him to take something away, or alter something Mr. Mills would
have to return to his flat in the ordinary way; and he very much
wanted, I think, that some one else besides himself should make
the discovery that must be made."</p>

<p>"He did his damndest not to go back with Miss Kitty Walsh and
me," Arthur said. "I had to insist on his doing so. I thought it
some practical joke, you see, and didn't relish taking it alone.
Luckily I spoilt that part of his plan."</p>

<p>Sewell looked regretfully at his watch. He had to be off. He
had agreed to a very urgent interview in the country at the house
of a former client, and he must not be late.</p>

<p>"I shall be back in Town to-morrow," he said in undisguised
hope of indulgence. "Of course, I'm now out of all this
professionally; but I'm all in, as far as being a most
tremendously interested onlooker is concerned."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. The call was for Pointer. Mills
requested an immediate interview with the chief inspector.</p>

<p>"There!" Sewell paused for a moment to exclaim. "Confession!
The whereabouts of the two necklaces! And I on my way to Devizes!
Hard luck!" With which successively-more-regretful ejaculations
he had, perforce, to hurry off.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>

Arthur Gets a Hard Knock.</h2>

<p class="first">"Do you think it is a confession that's coming?"
Colonel Walsh asked.</p>

<p>"Or more lies?" came bitterly from Arthur.</p>

<p>"Quite possibly," Pointer said tranquilly, "he has learned
that we have become aware of a convenient bungalow at Folkestone.
It is the property of 'Mrs. Finch's' present husband, Mr. Gray;
but is used quite as possessively, in his frequent absences on
his own affairs, by either his wife or her business partner, Mr.
Mills. And the knowledge of our discovery of this fact may have
decided the latter to volunteer some statement about it."</p>

<p>"Bungalow at Folkestone?" Arthur and his father were alike
seized with the possible importance of this news.</p>

<p>"Yes. Bought, as said, in the name of Mr. Gray, but paid for
by Mrs. Finch. I imagine that Mr. Mills, knowing or correctly
surmising that the Folkestone police are always friendly to me,
shrewdly anticipates my intention to run down there to-morrow and
be privately shown over Seaview, as the bungalow is called, while
none of its three users is staying in it. This message at any
rate suggests that we may find the visit worth while."</p>

<p>"You think he may have cached the pearls there, Chief
Inspector?" Colonel Walsh asked with an excitement almost as
irrepressible as was his eagerly listening son's look of eager
interest.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, don't you think it would suggest itself to you as
an exceptionally secure hiding-place if you had such booty to
stow away safe from police suspicion?" Pointer replied. "Belongs
to a man so far uninvolved in the case; and heretofore not even
discovered to be his. Mr. Mills either has or can easily get a
duplicate key to it. He may have his own secret cache there,
unguessed by either Mr. Gray or Mrs. Finch herself; most
conveniently accessible for a sudden flight abroad, if need be.
At all events I think this so possible that I should be very glad
if Mr. Walsh, at least," Pointer said cheerfully, "would run down
there with me to-morrow morning, to identify and claim the pearls
if we find them."</p>

<p>Arthur no less cheerfully replied that he would most willingly
be at Scotland Yard's service for such a promising possibility,
and Pointer got into his car, saying that the exact time at which
he would call for Mr. Walsh would be arranged over the phone,
with mutual discreetness, after he had heard what Mr. Mills, on
being formally cautioned of its risk, had to say to him.</p>

<p>That gentleman was looking far from jaunty, or even well, when
he was brought into the chief inspector's official room. As all
that he wanted to say was, however, an attempt to build up an
alibi for yesterday after five o'clock, Pointer informed him that
it was now practically certain that it had not been Mrs. Walsh
who had acted and spoken through the bedroom door in that
character, at Ennismore Gardens. And when to this he added the
discovery of Mills's still-binding marriage to Violet Finch, and
of his, Pointer's, conviction that it was Mills who had sent the
mysterious telephone message to Arthur Walsh, his hearer seemed
like a man who had been dealt a terrible blow over the heart.
After a long silence he finally begged for a few more minutes to
think out his wisest course. Pointer gave him ten, while he
busied himself with official documents in his bureau. Then Mills
faced him again, ashen-hued to his very lips also, as he
gasped:</p>

<p>"Look here, chief inspector, there's only one man who possibly
can save me yet And that's you! I solemnly swear to you that I
didn't kill poor Vi. I know nothing about&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer stopped him. "Mr. Mills, truth may save you. But be
very sure that lies, however clever, will not."</p>

<p>On that, Mills sat with his head buried in his hands for a
full five minutes. Then he lifted it to say hoarsely: "I don't
suppose, really, that anything I can say will be of any use, now
I've been a damned fool. And it's the fools who get caught in
this world. But I'll tell you everything, truthfully.</p>

<p>"First about my marriage. It stands for absolutely nothing in
my wife's murder. Nothing whatever! She and I had a sort of mad
pash on each other. The clubs were bringing in the shekels faster
than even she and I could spend them, and we weren't bad in that
line! Mrs. Finch&mdash;I'll leave her out, but she's a bloody
dangerous woman, chief inspector. Neither Vi nor I wanted her
down on us so we got married on the quiet. Then, within a month,
came the slump in the Owls. Slump in our funds. And we got on
each other's nerves at once.</p>

<p>"Violet was as much a bully as her mother, I can tell you;
without the old woman's brains or guts. It came to
this&mdash;that I loathed her and she me. So we agreed to call
the marriage off, and parted. No tears, I can assure you, on
either side. I was lucky to be quit of her so easily, I thought.
There is an American woman I'm keen on marrying. She's my type.
We were born for each other. She going to&mdash;" he gulped, and
suddenly stared, his eyes glassy as he stammered: "I
suppose&mdash;you think that's a motive!" He could hardly get his
lips to say the words. Panic shook him for a second. "God! It's
not! It's not!" His teeth began to chatter. Pointer sat silent;
and Mills presently resumed: "Mrs. Finch will try to make you
think it was! Mrs. Finch has been writing sheaves to me about
'the pearls.' The woman actually swears that I've got them She's
out for my blood, chief inspector."</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me about what really happened, Mr. Mills,"
Pointer said quietly. "<i>What really happened,</i> though," he
emphasised meaningly.</p>

<p>"Nothing happened!" came violently from Mills. "Nothing! I
came back to town earlier than I expected yesterday
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" Pointer interrupted. "Begin with the copied
pearls...In Paris...Monsieur Delaroche..."</p>

<p>Mills gulped down half the water in a tumbler standing beside
him before continuing: "Vi was in desperate money straits when
she got engaged to Walsh But his solicitor advised him to insert
a clause in the settlements which stipulated that he wouldn't pay
a penny of any debts incurred by her before the marriage. As I
say, she desperately needed money, and those splendid pearls
given to her before the wedding as his wedding gift seemed a
heaven-sent opportunity, if she could get them imitated. For she
believed that she could sell them separately for a good deal
more, each, than Walsh had paid, as she knew, for the two
together.</p>

<p>"She consulted me, secretly, as to where she could get them
expertly copied. I told her of Delaroche, because I knew that
Mrs. Yerkes had some fine pearls marvellously imitated by him for
herself. And like a fool, I offered to take them with me, when I
had to go to Paris presently on business, and bring the copies
back. I had to give her a very stiff receipt, though, and plonk
down all my available cash before she made up her mind to let me
take them. But she promised to let me have the selling of them
afterwards on a ten per cent. commission. To tell the truth, I
rather thought Mrs. Yerkes would like to buy them; and of course
Vi would have to have perfect copies to take their place as
Walsh's wedding gift.</p>

<p>"I got the copies all right, and handed them to Vi the week
before the wedding. Mrs. Yerkes, though, did not buy the
originals. She had had to go back to Santa Barbara because of her
sister's illness. Her sister's dying. Means still more money for
Mrs. Yerkes, eventually; and thank heaven it keeps her away from
England just now.</p>

<p>"Then came Vi's marriage to Walsh. Invalid, of course; but
that was our secret; and I swear that no one drank the bride's
health more heartily than I did. I honestly wished her joy! My
God!... Then yesterday I was out of town with Mrs. Finch; knee-deep in our own money troubles. She decided to cut short the
interview we were having with some creditors before lunch. And I,
on my part, too, had received a letter that morning, typed and
signed 'Elwes Morris.' It peremptorily asked me to come and see
him at the Cumberland Hotel, 'on a matter connected with some
imitation pearls.'</p>

<p>"I knew at once that Violet had been up to something. And I
knew also that it would be no earthly use to ask her about it;
for Vi is&mdash;was, poor girl!&mdash;a champion liar. I was
determined to find out for myself what her game was. She had put
off letting me sell the pearls on commission, but, as Mrs. Yerkes
was still away, that did not matter. You've got to have a long
spoon, chief inspector, when supping with the devil I did exactly
as the 'Elwes Morris' letter instructed. Went to the said hotel,
getting there by a quarter to four, going straight to Room 3005,
and waiting there.</p>

<p>"It was unlocked. The letter said that this Mr. Morris might
be detained for half an hour 'about the beads' before seeing me.
And as I found, as he wrote that I would, plenty of good cigars
out on the table and a bottle of first-class Amontillado, a
favourite wine of mine, I waited till four-thirty. Then the
telephone rang. Some one went on, before I could speak, to say
that he 'would be detained for the rest of the afternoon and
evening, but would write again.'</p>

<p>"I was furious, of course, but the speaker, who spoke in a
sort of Welsh sing-song, rang off. I went to my flat. Got there
by four-thirty&mdash;" Mills paused for another gulp of water.
"Let myself in&mdash;and found poor Vi there!&mdash;as you saw
her. And all around her body, on the floor, were torn-up scraps
of my own writing! Some old letter of mine that I suppose she had
found in her handbag, torn up, and flung into an empty paper-basket; then, I imagine, in the tragic scene between Vi and some
one else, she must have kicked over the basket, scattering the
torn scraps.</p>

<p>"I know now that I ought to have just picked them all up and
slipped away. But my brain was stunned. I could only think
stupidly of replacing the bits of my handwriting with blank bits.
So I hurriedly tore up a paper wrapper&mdash;as you saw&mdash;and
scattered its scraps instead. Then I nerved myself to get her
keys and rushed out. I let myself into the house in Ennismore
Gardens, my one impulse being to get my own and her marriage
certificate before her things would be searched by the police. I
didn't believe she had destroyed it, for I knew that she always
kept everything of that sort, all her papers, foolishly. I had
never written her any love letters; but she had that certificate,
I was certain, and I must get it. I knew the old cabin trunk
where she would be almost sure to keep it. Got it, and was just
throwing her keys into a drawer when a tap came on the door of
the room! The blasted parlourmaid wanted to know 'would Mrs.
Walsh like any tea?'" Mills gave a honk of hysterical laughter.
"A neat whisky was what I badly needed, but I remembered Vi's
habit when she was in her bedroom and didn't want to have to hear
anything bothersome. So, like her, I turned the tap on, and let
the water splash; and under cover of its sound I answered with a
light falsetto, 'No, thanks,' through the closed door.</p>

<p>"Though mind you, chief inspector"&mdash;Mills sat forward in
his chair, his voice growing stronger&mdash;"I wasn't afraid. I
wasn't conscious of danger. I hadn't been, even when I found her
murdered in my flat&mdash;fool that I was! I only wanted to get
hold of that certificate so that Mrs. Yerkes would never learn of
my marriage. Really, I couldn't have been quite all there!
Incidentally, there'll be found her first wedding-ring behind the
freshly-gilded radiator in her room. It was just like Vi to keep
it! Possibly she hadn't quite lost the glamour it had for us
both, once. It fell out of the envelope and rolled under the
pipes. I clawed after it but I had to give it up, and slipped out
of the house without meeting any one. But at the other end of the
street I saw a woman I knew get out of her car and come waddling
along. She couldn't see me; she's as blind as a bat without
specs. So I wheeled round, rang the bell&mdash;I hadn't the
latch-key on me&mdash;and asked for 'Mrs. Walsh.'</p>

<p>"I didn't mind doing it, chief inspector. It wasn't nerve; it
was just that I was still a bit dazed, I think. But I didn't want
that woman to see me walking away from that house. I did have
that much instinct of self-preservation in spite of my numbness.
I heard 'Mrs. Walsh' was out, as in a dream, and then, still
fuzzy but subconsciously acting the part out, I talked about a
wedding present and said I would go on to Grosvenor House, to see
if she was there. By that time I had the sense to camouflage by
really going to Grosvenor House in search of her, and met Walsh.
And as I stood talking about china to him, suddenly, like a
thunderbolt, I realised what I was in for!</p>

<p>"I couldn't, daren't alter my usual way of life. I must show
up fairly soon openly at my flat and I simply couldn't face the
sight I knew was there. I was horribly afraid I couldn't act
sufficient surprise, or that I would say something the police
might fasten on. I wanted to get Walsh to go with me, for his
terrible shock would take attention off me. Luckily he went
downstairs for a book about our argument on china. I heard the
telephone ring below. There was an extension the decorators had
left on the mantel. I felt sure Vi had been found and I took down
the receiver to listen-in. I heard Walsh say&mdash;to me, as it
were= Yes; Walsh speaking. Who is it? '&mdash;getting no answer
to his question. On that I had a brain-wave, as I thought, and
made up a continuation for the first speaker in the message you
know. I imitated the voice of a Mr. Silberrad with whom Mrs.
Finch and I had just been having a talk at Maidenhead. He has a
German accent that you could lean on. I was bent on getting Walsh
to go to my flat without me. Then, to my consternation, I found
when he came upstairs that Walsh was sure it was a clumsy hoax! I
hadn't said the right thing, evidently; or not in the right way.
You see, I hadn't had a moment to think out a plausible message.
And then Kitty Walsh came in, also asking for Vi. And that saved
my scheme. But Walsh insisted on dragging me along to see that he
was right about the 'hoax.' The rest you know."</p>

<p>"How about the taking away of the little red and blue
tablecloth? Why did you do that, Mr. Mills?" Pointer asked
dryly.</p>

<p>Mills was still a moment before he said: "I was feeling very
rocky, chief inspector, by the time we reached my flat, and I
clutched at even a small table to steady myself. I had pulled my
glove off as I came in, for I wanted to act just as usual. To my
horror, I saw that left a conspicuous patch of gilding on the
little table's cloth. I must have got it on my hand&mdash;they
were both sweating&mdash;when I was hunting for the ring that had
jumped behind the freshly-gilt radiator. I had tried desperately
to get it back, as you can imagine. And when I saw that damning
stain I had, of course, to get the cloth away. There again I
hadn't time to think dearly, even if you could call any of those
half-crazy impulses 'thinking' at all. I just automatically
snatched the cloth off, crammed it up my sleeve, ran down into
the kitchen, and&mdash;once again like an absolutely demented
fool&mdash;stuffed the tell-tale thing in among a lot of soiled
table-napkins in a dresser drawer."</p>

<p>Mills swore that he had had no intention of preventing the
real time of Violet's murder becoming known, either when he had
let the parlourmaid think she was alive in her bedroom or when he
had faked that telephone message. He insisted that he had acted
throughout on the spur of each terrible moment. He declared
solemnly that he had no faintest knowledge of what had become of
the real pearls, let alone had had any share in any sale of them
if they had been sold. That he had no alibi covering the time
when the "rajah secretary" was at one or other of the two hotels
was his sheer bad luck.</p>

<p><br>"Then who do you think is the murderer?" Pointer
queried.</p>

<p>Mills had risen and was standing facing him. He leaned
impressively towards him as he almost whispered: "Mrs. Finch! Vi
disliked her and feared her. While her mother disliked and
despised Vi. Somehow she's got these pearls. I tell you, chief
inspector, that woman would flay any one, any <i>one,</i> alive
for such a sum of money, in the present state of her
affairs."</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

The Pearls Are Found.</h2>

<p class="first">SEWELL had received a message when he was
halfway to Devizes, putting his interview off for two days.
Whereupon he instantly tried unsuccessfully to get Pointer on the
phone. Failing him, he phoned to Arthur Walsh, and arranged to
dine with him.</p>

<p>Sewell and he had enjoyed what on the whole was a fairly
cheerful dinner, all things considered. Arthur talked gratefully
about the sympathetic way in which Ann Lovelace was helping him
and his father by her tact and kindness, notwithstanding her
natural horror at Violet's appalling treachery.</p>

<p>Sewell agreed with him as to the shock that learning of such
deliberate and even criminal duplicity must have been to a nature
like that of Miss Lovelace.</p>

<p>"I feel as though I had been under an evil spell," Arthur said
soberly, "to be so blinded. Not to see..." he checked himself.
And the two men then discussed the case itself with quite a fair
amount of objectivity; Arthur posting Sewell about the bungalow
at Shorncliffe Road, Folkestone.</p>

<p>"If the chief inspector fails to find the pearls cached in
that bungalow, or its grounds, if it's got any," Arthur said
thoughtfully, "I don't see his next step." Nor did Sewell. But he
felt quite sure that Pointer did, and was absorbed in silent
speculations as to possible alternatives, with scant attention to
the other's wandering talk.</p>

<p>And when he had left Walsh he got out his roadster and motored
down to Folkestone. He himself was now out of the case; free from
all its obligations. Nor was it Scotland Yard's ground. It
belonged to the Folkestone police. Sewell knew that part of the
country very well. His first O.T.C. camp had been close to
Shorncliffe, and he easily found Seaview among a group of other
bungalows.</p>

<p>It was about half-past twelve and a beautiful, clear night. He
hid his car and walked round the little house in its sandy
garden. A wilful impulse was rising in him, as he made his
prowling observations. He had a knife...that back window catch
looked absolutely rotten...It had neither bars nor shutters...Any
one could push back the catch and get in...<i>he</i> might have
the immense luck to find those pearls that Pointer was
after...</p>

<p>Sewell took a half-turn away from that most enticing
temptation. Followed irresistibly, however, by a whole-turn back
to that window. Next, found the thing accomplished and himself
noiselessly inside. He left the window as he had found it, and
switched on his torch. He was in the dining-room evidently. It
looked the sort of place that he would expect Mr. Gray to have.
"Cheap and nasty," Sewell said, wrinkling up his nose at the
thickly-loaded varnish glittering on tables and sideboard.</p>

<p>There was a drawing-room opening out of this dining-room, with
its own gimcrack chairs and sofa; and a smoking-room on the other
side of the hall. A nice room this last. Gray had kept it simple.
The drugget was plain; so were the furnishings, even to a big
velvet pouffe by the curb. It had a big tallboy with all its
drawers locked, he found on trying them, facing the fireplace.
There were built-in cupboards, too. Suddenly a click caught his
ear. On the instant he stood rigid, his own torch out. Another
faint click. He had heard that same sound only a few minutes ago,
made by himself...Some one was evidently at work on the hasp of
the kitchen window. Who? Was Mills at liberty? Was it the police?
Or a house-breaker? But he mustn't wait to know which. He softly
opened one of the cupboards and to his delight found it empty,
with its one shelf some six feet up from the floor, and quietly
slipped into it. If it was only some chance thief he might not
stop to search unpromising-looking, because keyless, cupboards.
"Kismet!"</p>

<p>Unfortunately the door, which he had softly drawn to after
him, shut off all view of the room and he dared not leave it
ajar. His luminous watch dial told him that it was now close on
one o'clock. He heard movements from the man or woman&mdash;but
the mode of entry seemed to negative the latter&mdash;now only
too close to himself. He heard quick steps come into the room and
after a second the switching on of the electric light. And a
moment later the door of the cupboard next to him was opened. He
knew now that it could only be a matter of seconds before he was
discovered with consequences abjectly humiliating at the best,
and perhaps something much deadlier at the worst. His tense
apprehension grew so unbearable as almost to make him plunge out
to meet whatever might be the consequence. But just as the
cupboard door beside him was firmly closed, a creak came clearly
from the kitchen. The second corner heard it too, for after one
second's utter stillness, Sewell heard him tiptoeing back across
the room, the light was noiselessly switched off, and then came
the sound of the door being opened with the utmost caution. He
ventured to open his cupboard door very gingerly. He was just in
time to see the room door being closed very quietly behind
whoever it was that had been in the room with him.</p>

<p>Sewell on the instant was out of his cupboard and into the one
that had already been thoroughly searched. He had barely drawn
its door close again, when once more the room door opened, this
time with confidence, once more the light was switched on, once
more the steps came towards the two cupboards. The same steps.
Sewell hoped that whoever it was it was not one of those absent-minded people who forget what they did last. He did not want him
to search the first cupboard again. He need not have worried. In
another second the second cupboard had been opened, looked into,
closed, and then the steps went to the middle of the room. After
some minutes there followed sounds which had no meaning whatever
to Sewell's quick ears. In vain he tried to guess their
significance. He grew desperate. At all or any costs to himself
he must see what or who was making those queer sounds of ripping,
followed by soft thuds! Getting his penknife out of his pocket
with the utmost care to make no slightest sound, he softly pried
the tightly shut door sufficiently open by what he hoped was an
imperceptible space. But in the next instant it was flung open
and a revolver was thrust within an inch of his face. It was
death. And Sewell knew it. He was not afraid. There is no fear at
the very end of all. Fear falls by the way. A whimsical notion
struck him that he had come here to learn the truth, and that in
another minute he would know the whole truth.</p>

<p>Then everything happened all at once. Or seemed to. A clear
voice shouted warningly: "We are the police!" even as his ears
seemed to split with the sound of a shot. A flame scorched his
forehead. The room was full of figures fighting, swirling round
and round. There was another report and then the figures fell
apart, revolved themselves into one on the carpet and three
others bending over him, while two others stood by the door. And
a voice said gravely: "Arthur Walsh! I arrest you for the murder
of Violet Finch. And I warn you&mdash;" The warning followed.
Sewell was beside Pointer now, though he never knew how he got
there. Walsh lay very still on the floor, his head in a widening
pool of blood.</p>

<p>"I'm done for," his voice came feebly, "you turned my wrist
too far, chief inspector. I'm&mdash;going&mdash;fast." His eyes
fell on Sewell's horrified ones. They lingered there. "Quick
Hurry!" came in a throaty croak, "think of your own last hour,
and get the bishop of Lower Mesopotamia here.
He's&mdash;at&mdash;the Franciscans here with Ambrose. It must be
a bishop&mdash;I want absolution!"</p>

<p>And by these words Sewell knew that the chief inspector had
made no mistake. Incredible though the arrest would otherwise
have been to him. Arthur Walsh...Why, Arthur had adored Violet
surely! He had no need whatever of money. He could well afford
the loss of the pearls. Yet he had asked for a bishop!... and
only a bishop can absolve a murder!</p>

<p>"The Church of St. Francis...quite close!... Priests' house
next to it!&mdash;Get him for me, Sewell, at once! I can't last
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sewell rushed out into the night. Chief Inspector Pointer bent
over Arthur Walsh. A shot had grazed his head, causing a sense of
great shock, but the merest of scalp wounds. Pointer examined him
quickly but carefully; as far as he could see, the man was
uninjured in any vital or even serious sense. He was almost
tempted to let him think himself dying, but he resisted it. It
might possibly have been debatable had the Yard needed a
confession, but the case against the man who had deliberately
planned and brutally carried out the murder of Violet Mills, as
she secretly was, needed no confession for its absolute
completion.</p>

<p>"You're not seriously wounded at all, Mr. Walsh," the chief
inspector said clearly to him, "Did you understand my warning
about evidence,' just now?"</p>

<p>"I'm dying!" came weakly from Arthur, who had never in his
life borne pain with any pluck. "Listen! I can't last till the
bishop gets here, for I'm going fast. I killed Violet. She
deserved it! I didn't know then that she was already married. I
thought I should go mad when you found that out. Mad...I'm half
mad...I needn't have done it! I needn't have got to
this&mdash;dying here like a dog!"</p>

<p>"I assure you again, Mr. Walsh, that you're not dying nor
anywhere near it&mdash;at present," Pointer said with stern
significance. For not here and now was Arthur Walsh to pass from
this life. Pointer's whole soul revolted at the thought of that
butchered girl. Tricked, lured to her death by this callously
sordid travesty of manhood. Violet Mills had not been by any
means all that she should have been, but she was a saint compared
to this cunning tiger who had killed her for his own ends.</p>

<p>"I know better, chief inspector," Arthur replied. "My legs are
already cold."</p>

<p>They were; since a shot-wound in that particular part of the
head always produces that effect.</p>

<p>"And the cold is creeping up to my heart. It was the fault of
her mother," he panted on. "That Finch woman, and her damned
Clubs! She'll never tell you; Mills may; but he's afraid of her.
I want it put on record. I want it broadcast. Take this down
quickly! instantly!" His nerve was so shattered that Arthur
Walsh really looked now like a dying man.</p>

<p>"She blackmailed me, like lots of other victims, as soon as
she cleverly found out that I had given my word of honour to my
father that I had no other debts than those he had already
settled. He is insane about gamesters who play for stakes they
can't settle. Give me some brandy! I'm going! I shan't live to
tell you the whole story after all!" Panic-stricken with his own
certainty, Arthur tremblingly swallowed the water one of the men
held to his lips.</p>

<p>Pointer held up a hand. "Mrs. Finch gave you back your IOUs on
your wedding day, in that so-called packet of sandwiches, didn't
she, Mr. Walsh? I thought so," he said, as Arthur's head made a
sign of assent. "You had beforehand determined to get rid of her
daughter as soon after the wedding as possible? You bought your
supposed wife those valuable pearls as a wedding present, and
then inserted the advertisement about them, ostensibly from a
rajah's secretary. It was you who, as Mr. Elwes Morris, did
actually buy the smaller string before the wedding, and after it,
as Mr. Elwes Morris, you arranged to buy the larger string from
her in Mr. Mills's fiat. Instead of which you murdered her with
the steel ornament standing on the mantelshelf, and coolly
strewed torn-up scraps of Mr. Mills's writing to suggest him as
the murderer."</p>

<p>"And that devil took them away and put blank scraps in their
place!" Arthur chokingly ejaculated.</p>

<p>"He took me to those gambling dens of his and Mrs. Finch's in
the first place. He led me on&mdash;and let me down...He got me
into that damned harpy's clutches and he ought to hang! He ought
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sign, please," Pointer said coldly as he put the requested
deposition before the babbling man.</p>

<p>Arthur scribbled his signature eagerly. The numbness was
passing off, and his head was giving him more agonising pain that
he could endure without low moans. That it would presently pass,
and leave him very much his usual physical self, he was much too
hysterical to realise, let alone believe, as he persisted:
"Ambrose knew. That's why I went to confession to him, to stop
his mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Sewell came back, bringing Ambrose Walsh with
him.</p>

<p>Sewell gave a cry as he caught sight of the face on the floor,
for Arthur's eyes were closed. "I couldn't get the bishop," he
said chokingly to Pointer, who for once had no clue to his
evident distress. "He left this afternoon. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He said that you knew all, before he went to confession to
you, sir," Pointer said to the priest on that.</p>

<p>A bitter look just flitted across the tight lips of Father
Walsh. He was dearly quite aware of the reason why his cousin had
chosen him, though Arthur had pretended to Sewell that he had
been too late for a word with Ambrose before the latter had
withdrawn into a Retreat. But as he knelt beside the seemingly
moribund Arthur, he made a sharp ejaculation; for Ambrose Walsh
was also a very good doctor and his hands had passed with swift
investigation over the head and torso before him. A fresh moan
now came from Arthur: "I've confessed, Ambrose; oh! give me what
you can! I've confessed."</p>

<p>The priest rose to his feet on this. His eyes were blazing as
he faced the chief inspector. "Have you juggled him into thinking
himself a dying man?" he demanded sternly. "Have you tricked him
by using the most sacred need of the human soul?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, sir," Pointer said authoritatively on his side
also. "I have vainly assured Mr. Walsh that he has got only a
scalp wound. But he persists in believing that he is dying."</p>

<p>"I'm dying, Ambrose," his cousin pertinently groaned,
reiterating: "Give me what absolution you can!"</p>

<p>For reply Father Walsh gave Arthur a most unpriestly tug,
lifting him on to a chair. Then a look of infinite pity swept
over the harsh features of Ambrose Walsh, as he said to his
cousin:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Arthur! You're very slightly wounded; a mere
scalp wound. Pull yourself together, and play the man for once! I
shall leave you for the moment, to get the best legal help for
you that can be procured. That done, if I'm permitted to, I'll
see you as often as you ask for me."</p>

<p>But Father Walsh only saw Arthur once again. For his cousin
steadily refused to see him until the end, when he asked for him.
And it was Ambrose who accompanied him prayerfully on Arthur
Walsh's last earthly walk.</p>

<p><br>"Father Walsh knew?" Sewell questioned with incredulity
even stronger than his amazement, as Arthur was driven off
between two of Pointer's men. Sewell longed to divert his own
mind from the shock of Arthur's arrest. "And just now, when you
saved me from following Violet, where were you? Have you got the
fabled cloak of invisibility, by any chance, chief inspector? I
heard the door locked by the man in the room whose revolver he
shoved into my face. I can swear that you didn't share my
cupboard. Where the devil, then, <i>were</i> you, to play the
Yard's <i>deus ex machina</i> so decisively for me as well as for
Walsh?"</p>

<p>"You know the tallboy whose drawers you hurriedly tried to
open?" Pointer answered gravely as well as succinctly, for the
preceding scene and forced departure of Arthur for the gallows,
unless some miracle of special pleading could intervene to cheat
justice, was as tragically before his mind as overshadowing
Sewell's, who now turned sharply to examine the piece of
furniture in question on Pointer's significant answer. He
exclaimed with fresh incredulity, however, as he saw, from the
tallboy's moved-out profile, that it was a complete sham. It had
no drawers. It had no back, but had been held firmly to the wall
by two air cups. Its hollow interior provided for the perfect
concealment of the expectant chief inspector and two of his men,
for which purpose it had been expertly prepared at the Yard.
Pointer first assuring himself both of the intense activities of
the others at a distance and of the fact that Arthur was paying
his first visit to the bungalow and had no acquaintance with its
furniture, therefore.</p>

<p>As he was due at the Yard, he had the place locked and
guarded, and&mdash;arranging to meet Sewell later&mdash;drove
there speedily. The A.C. sent for him almost immediately. Pointer
had already handed in his report, setting Mills instantly at
liberty. He was told only that facts had come to light which
proved his entire innocence of the criminal charges in the case.
Arthur's defence exerted itself subsequently to implicate Mills
with Mrs. Finch's blackmail, and with the murder of Violet. But
the finding of jury and judge quashed the attempt.</p>

<p>On Pointer's entry now, the assistant commissioner laid a slip
of paper before him. There had been an accident in Park Lane. An
elderly gentleman hurrying forward had been run down by a car and
killed outright. From the letters in his pocket the man had been
identified as Colonel Walsh.</p>

<p>"I had just spoken to him over the phone," Major Pelham went
on, "and asked him to come here to see me as soon as possible. He
believed that we had now completed our case against Mills, and I
am afraid that he was so engrossed with that idea that he forgot
to keep a careful enough look-out when hurrying here."</p>

<p>"What a blessing&mdash;for him," Pointer said fervently. Pity
for the father's terrible ordeal had weighed on the chief
inspector all morning, and Major Pelham fully sympathised with
his relief.</p>

<p>Over lunch&mdash;to which the A.C. and the chief inspector had
been invited by Sewell, his rooms securing privacy and
confidential talk without fear of the ubiquitous press
broadcasting it prematurely&mdash;Sewell metaphorically cornered
his revered exemplar in the difficult art of detection, with the
query: "Chief inspector, did you suspect Walsh from the
first?"</p>

<p>"Practically, yes," was the reply. "Because, on weighing up
the probabilities in the case of each more or less suspect
individual involved by the circumstances of the fraudulent pearls
and the murder of the owner of the originals, Mr. Walsh afforded,
to my mind, the most likely criminal."</p>

<p>"But He seemed to crave to lavish everything on Violet Finch,
as we all supposed her, because he adored her with all his heart.
How could you tell that all that was an amazing piece of acting?
How could you see any motive for it?"</p>

<p>"I did neither, as anything like a conviction, though. All
that I did know positively," Pointer protested with his
characteristic refusal to play the occult or clairvoyant prodigy,
"was that we had a group of associates any one of whom might, so
far as opportunity was concerned, have been the murderer if not
the thief.</p>

<p>"Just so! Hell? Taking them separately, a priest is rarely if
ever a criminal. Apart from religious principle, he is by
training if not by nature much too intelligent. Also, the
Reverend Mr. Walsh had a good alibi from the garage through which
he had to pass to get out of the house in which he was. Next,
Colonel Walsh bears the highest character. I had met him and was
convinced of its truth. So, although he had no alibi, I put him
and his nephew, Father Walsh,' at the bottom of the possible
suspects."</p>

<p>"That left Gray, Mills and Arthur Walsh," Pelham interrupted,
holding up three fingers. "Why not Gray or Mills?"</p>

<p>"Because, sir, I could see no reason why either of them should
stage the murder in a flat which one owned and the other lived
in. As for Mr. Gray, one would expect a garage proprietor to have
selected a bloodless murder, and to have taken the corpse to some
place that had no sort of connection with himself in one of his
cars."</p>

<p>"Um-hum," agreed Pelham. "There was no attempt at that,
certainly."</p>

<p>"Passion might have struck, with sudden brutality," Pointer
continued. "But Mills seemed to me, and Gray seemed to Inspector
Watts, who interviewed him in Manchester, to be essentially the
coldly calculating business-first-last-and-all-the-time
emotionally passionless type, rather than one liable to either
panic or frenzy."</p>

<p>"And Walsh?" Sewell drew a deep breath. He had been all out in
his estimate of Arthur Walsh.</p>

<p>"At any rate she hadn't been killed on his premises, was my
first thought. Then there was the knowledge of Mrs. Finch and the
tales about her victims, to suggest what the whole investigation
steadily strengthened; namely, blackmail. While the underlying
motive to get free from a wife he hated, a marriage into which he
had been blackmailed, leaped to the mind's eye, as a possibility,
from the first sight, especially when I learnt about his
disinherited brother Gerald...and Colonel Walsh's abhorrence of a
lie. And all his income seemed to come from the allowance his
father made him, and the salary paid him in his father's office.
Let him fall out with his father, and he would be a very poor
man. I learned, though later, that when he had sent in his papers
and gone into business&mdash;his father's business&mdash;he had
given the latter his word of honour not to gamble any more."</p>

<p>"Now how did you learn that?" Sewell wanted to know.</p>

<p>"His late colonel let it drop, when I managed to meet him and,
apparently casually, have a word about Arthur Walsh. It was at
the end of a great many other words about quite another case. But
to go back; all the preliminary information fitted the idea of
the murderer being Walsh himself."</p>

<p>"You know, Pointer," Major Pelham said with a faint smile, "I
rather wondered why you seemed to give so little time to making
sure whether it was the young woman herself who was heard at five
o'clock. It didn't really matter, did it?"</p>

<p>"Not fundamentally, sir. It only concerned Mr. Mills's alibi,
but I had to give a lot of time to him, for fear of rousing
Walsh's suspicions. Walsh himself, of course, had no alibi
whatever from three o'clock on."</p>

<p>"Ah, his devotion to the young wife whom he had married in
spite of all his family could say, made any idea of an alibi in
his case ridiculous,", scoffed Pelham.</p>

<p>"His apparent devotion to his wife!" Sewell murmured in
horror.</p>

<p>"Ah, that meant nothing one way or the other! What people
<i>say</i> means nothing! But if he was being blackmailed into
the marriage, could I find out when any IOUs could have been
returned to him? It would be after the wedding, and they seemed
to have left practically at once for the air liner. Then I learnt
of the wedding present of Mrs. Finch's. An ideal way of returning
letters, or IOUs. He had left the basket behind, I found out, but
had taken the packet of so-called sandwiches on with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the pearls!" said Sewell. "The pearls which he
himself had bought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And which, if he himself had got hold of them, were still in
his possession," Pointer countered.</p>

<p>"But taking the pearls by themselves, they fitted the idea
that Walsh, forced into a marriage by Mrs. Finch, had intended
from the first to be free himself as soon as possible. He would
have to make sure of a good, ostensible motive beforehand."</p>

<p>"A sort of moral alibi," agreed the assistant
commissioner.</p>

<p>"The pearls would make a splendid one," Pointer continued,
"they were bought well before the marriage. Violet was to be
given them outright on her marriage so that she could leave them
to Mrs. Finch. Walsh would know quite well that the elder woman,
whom he hated, would never get them from her. Also, he engaged
you, Sewell, an amateur who was known to take only defensive
cases never prosecutions. And yet, by calling you in, he drew
attention to the pearls."</p>

<p>"He did keep them well to the fore throughout," Sewell at last
lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"They belonged there. They were in the very heart of the plan.
They were frankly my one hope of catching him," Pointer drew out
his pipe at a nod from his chief. "The pearls were not insured,"
Pointer went on, "though he told the Colonel they were, which
meant that no inquiries from the company need be feared. The
pearls suggested a well-laid plot, especially the advertisement,
and the rajah's secretary disguise. The dates fitted. The
secretary engaged a room in the first hotel and paid for it for a
week just after Walsh had gone to see the pearls. Also, by being
the secretary, Walsh lost nothing.
Except&mdash;possibly&mdash;the money he paid for the smaller
string.</p>

<p>"Then, too, the hotels at which the pseudo secretary stayed
were where Mills and Gray were both known, but where Walsh had
never been, a trifling point, but substantiating my idea."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"Did he arrange..." Sewell checked himself. "He had nothing to
do with the imitations, surely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that was an unexpected windfall for him, though I
feel quite certain that he knew there would be something of that
sort tried on. Oh, yes, he thought over her character closely,"
Pointer granted, "and that of Mills too. Given their natures, he
reasoned correctly that they would be up to something What, he
neither knew nor cared. He had his own major plot all cut and
dried. The more complications there were thrown in the better,
Walsh would think. What did rattle him was that inexplicable
telephone call. He didn't want to be the one to find the body.
Few murderers do. He had expected that that honour would fall to
Mills."</p>

<p>"And Miss Walsh thought Ann Lovelace was in the whole affair!"
Sewell liked to bracket Kitty with himself.</p>

<p>"She was!" Pointer said unexpectedly. "In the very heart of
the crime! But not in the way Walsh thought. As great as his
determination not to be disinherited was Arthur Walsh's desire to
marry Miss Lovelace. I'll stake all, my future pay on that. He
was madly in love with her."</p>

<p>"He had been once," Sewell was impressed by the insight of the
tall man now smoking a pipe beside him. "But she tried for higher
game, especially as in those days there was Gerald, his elder
brother and his father's favourite. So all Walsh's fury with her
when she came to him about the imitation pearls, and her loan on
them, was acting!"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary! No man sweats over a very dangerous plot,
a life and death plot, and likes to see it blown sky-high. Arthur
Walsh's shield was to be his devotion to his young wife. He had
to marry her to get back the IOUs of his from Mrs. Finch, and be
free&mdash;to get rid of Violet, and try again for Miss Lovelace.
Yet here was Miss Lovelace telling him Something which threatened
to make that marriage quite impossible. Walsh met it in the only
possible way. Refusing to listen. Refusing to reason."</p>

<p>"He's a clever hound," Pelham pronounced.</p>

<p>"He is," Pointer agreed, "and in nothing so much so as in not
trying to throw any doubt on its having been Violet whom the maid
heard in Ennismore Gardens at five o'clock. Yet he made one very
bad slip. He spoke of his wife having stumbled on some one when
she went to the flat at four, and having been at once
killed."</p>

<p>"Well? Only a trifling slip, I should call it," Pelham
thought.</p>

<p>"I should have suspected him from that alone, sir," Pointer
said truthfully. "No husband, new to the facts, would have
forgotten the hour when his wife was last heard. But a man who
knew that the murder took place at four, who had reckoned over
and over with that hour in his mind&mdash;he would forget!"</p>

<p>"He passed on at once to some other point when I recalled it
to him," Sewell had a very good memory. "He was planting the
pearls in that velvet pouffe, wasn't he, when he nearly got
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Pointer had his pipe well going. "I noticed a book down
at Friars Halt, spoke of it, in which there's an account of
stolen jewels which were hidden in just that place. I hoped he
would take the hint. He did. Or tried to. I don't mind telling
you, Sewell, that I could have sworn when you slipped into that
room! I purposely hadn't said anything about the bungalow to
you."</p>

<p>"Does it belong to Gray?" Sewell asked.</p>

<p>Pointer grinned. "I told you that the Folkestone police are
rather by way of being pals of mine just now," was the only
answer to that. "I knew that Walsh was feeling like a hen who
wants to lay. He had the pearls all ready to dump in the most
dangerous place for Mills, and only needed a word from us as to
what new place we were going to search. He was far too clever to
put them among Mills's effects. That might, or rather would, have
looked 'planted.'"</p>

<p>Sewell sat thinking. "You told me almost at once that the two
families were all-important in the case," he mused aloud.</p>

<p>"Just so. A father who had disinherited one son, his
favourite, because he had lied to him, and a woman who ran night-clubs which were known to be hot-beds of blackmail, a marriage
against all reason to that woman's daughter, and the murder of
the bride very shortly afterwards."</p>

<p>"And all that love and devotion was only a smoke-screen. I
wonder what his real thoughts were, when he went off the deep
end, on hearing about her previous marriage?" Sewell was too
interested to keep his cigarette alight.</p>

<p>"He wasn't acting then," Pointer said soberly. "First came
blind rage. No man likes to think that he need not have murdered.
That all the terrible deed, all the awful preparation of mind and
affairs beforehand was quite unnecessary, that if he had found
out about her marriage to Mills after Mrs. Finch had handed him
back his IOUs, he would have been free and not a murderer!"</p>

<p>"But he laughed! His father spoke to me of yells of sheer
hysteria."</p>

<p>"When he thought of Mrs. Finch!" Pointer, too, gave a laugh,
though but a short one. "He knew how she would feel. She had
given back his IOUs for nothing. I told you she struck me as
feeling sold when she heard of the real marriage."</p>

<p>"Her daughter not married to the wealthy Arthur after all!"
continued Sewell with gusto. "A son-in-law whom, of course, she
intended to milk whenever necessary. A son-in-law who was as good
as an overdraft at her bank from the first."</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace was notified by Watts that she would have to
give evidence about the pearls. I thought it as well to let her
know at once that she mustn't slip out of the country." Pointer
saw his chief glance at the clock.</p>

<p>"The duchess will get her away," Pelham said at once. "She'll
have the whole Home Office turned inside out if need be. You
won't have the pleasure of seeing that young lady in the witness-box in this case, Pointer."</p>

<p>Both Pointer and Sewell were sorry to hear it.</p>

<p>"However, it'll all come out," the A.C. consoled them, "and
she'll wish that she had never heard the name of Walsh before the
end."</p>

<p>She did most heartily.</p>

<p>As for Kitty, she still thinks that had Ann been put in the
witness-box, instead of being sent "on doctor's orders" to South
Africa for a year's stay&mdash;and had she been cross-examined&mdash;she would have been proved to be at the bottom of
the puzzle of the pearl necklaces.</p>

<p>It is one of the few points on which she will always differ
from her husband&mdash;for she is now Mrs. Sewell.</p>
