<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In publishing a popular edition of my work, Captain James Cook,
R.N., F.R.S., it has, of course, been necessary to condense it, but
care has been taken to omit nothing of importance, and at the same
time a few slight errors have been corrected, and some new
information has been added, chiefly relating to the disposition of
documents.</p>

<p>I must not omit this opportunity of thanking the Reviewers for
the extremely kind manner in which they all received the original
work&mdash;a manner, indeed, which far exceeded my highest
hopes.</p>

<p>ARTHUR KITSON.<br>
LONDON, 1912.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1. EARLY YEARS.</h2>

<p>James Cook, the Circumnavigator, was a native of the district of
Cleveland, Yorkshire, but of his ancestry there is now very little
satisfactory information to be obtained. Nichols, in his
Topographer and Genealogist, suggests that "James Cooke, the
celebrated mariner, was probably of common origin with the Stockton
Cookes." His reason for the suggestion being that a branch of the
family possessed a crayon portrait of some relation, which was
supposed to resemble the great discoverer. He makes no explanation
of the difference in spelling of the two names, and admits that the
sailor's family was said to come from Scotland.</p>

<p>Dr. George Young, certainly the most reliable authority on
Cook's early years, who published a Life in 1836, went to Whitby as
Vicar about 1805, and claims to have obtained much information
about his subject "through intercourse with his relatives, friends,
and acquaintances, including one or two surviving school
companions," and appears to be satisfied that Cook was of Scotch
extraction. Dr. George Johnston, a very careful writer, states in
his Natural History of the Eastern Borders, that in 1692 the father
of James Thomson, the author of The Seasons, was minister of Ednam,
Roxburghshire, and a man named John Cook was one of the Elders of
the Kirk. This John Cook married, on the 19th January 1693, a woman
named Jean Duncan, by whom he had a son, James, baptised 4th March
1694, and this child, Johnston positively asserts, was afterwards
the father of the future Captain Cook. The dates of the marriage
and baptism have been verified by the Reverend John Burleigh,
minister of Ednam, and they agree with the probable date of the
birth of Cook's father, for he died in 1778 at the age of
eighty-five. Owing to the loss of the church records for some years
after 1698, Mr. Burleigh is unable to trace when this James Cook
left Ednam to "better himself," but he would take with him a
"testificate of church membership" which might possibly, but not
probably, still exist. Attracted, perhaps, by the number of Scotch
people who flocked into the north of Yorkshire to follow the alum
trade, then at its height, James Cook settled down and married; and
the first positive information to be obtained is that he and his
wife Grace (her maiden name has so far escaped identification,
though she is known to have been a native of Cleveland) resided for
some time at Morton, in the parish of Ormsby, and here their eldest
child, John, was born in January 1727. Dr. Young says that James
Cook had a superstition that his mother's farewell was prophetic of
his marriage, for her words were "God send you Grace."</p>

<p><b>BIRTH-PLACE.</b>
</p>

<p>Shortly after the birth of John, the Cooks left Morton for
Marton, a village a few miles away, and the similarity of the two
names has caused some confusion. At Marton the father worked for a
Mr. Mewburn, living in a small cottage built of mud, called in the
district a clay biggin. This cottage was pulled down in 1786, when
Major Rudd erected a mansion near the spot. Afterwards, when the
mansion was burned to the ground, the site of the cottage was
planted with trees, and was popularly known as Cook's Garth. Dr.
Young was shown the spot by an old shoemaker whose wife's mother
was present at Captain Cook's birth, and he says there was a
willow-tree occupying the site, but no vestige of the walls was
left. Mr. Bolckow, the present owner of Marton Hall, says: "The
cottage was found destroyed when my uncle bought Marton in 1854,
but we came across the foundations of it when the grounds were laid
out." A granite vase has been erected on the spot. The pump which
Besant says still exists, and was made by Cook's father to supply
his house with water, was "put there after Cook's time," and has
disappeared.</p>

<p>In this humble clay biggin James Cook, the Circumnavigator, was
born on 27th October 1728, and was registered as baptised on 3rd
November in the Marton church records, being entered as "ye son of
a day labourer." He was one of several children, most of whom died
young; John, the eldest, who lived till he was twenty-three, and
Margaret, who married a Redcar fisherman named James Fleck, being
the only two that came to maturity.</p>

<p>The Cooks remained at Marton for some years, during which time
they removed to another cottage, and young James received some
instruction from a Mistress Mary Walker, who taught him his letters
and a little reading. Dr. Young and Kippis call her the village
schoolmistress, but Ord, who was a descendant on his mother's side,
says:</p>

<p>"she was the daughter of the wealthiest farmer in the
neighbourhood, and wife of William Walker, a respectable yeoman of
the first class residing at Marton Grange."</p>

<p>Young James, a lad of less than eight years old, worked for Mr.
Walker:</p>

<p>"tended the stock, took the horses to water, and ran errands for
the family, and in return for such services the good lady, finding
him an intelligent, active youth, was pleased to teach him his
alphabet and reading."</p>

<p>In 1736 Cook's father was appointed to the position of hind or
bailiff by Mr. Skottowe, and removed with his family to Airy Holme
Farm, near Ayton. According to Besant, a hind was one who, residing
on a farm, was paid a regular wage for carrying on the work, and
handed over the proceeds to the landlord. Young James, now eight
years of age, was sent to the school on the High Green kept by a
Mr. Pullen, where he was instructed in writing and arithmetic as
far as the first few rules&mdash;"reading having apparently been
acquired before." He is said to have shown a special aptitude for
arithmetic, and it is believed that owing to the good reports of
his progress, Mr. Skottowe paid for his schooling. According to Dr.
Young, his schoolfellows gave him the character of being fond of
his own way, and, when any project was on foot for birds-nesting or
other boyish amusement, and discussion arose as to the method to be
pursued, he would propound his own plans, and insist on their
superiority; should his views not meet with approval, he would
pertinaciously adhere to them, even at the risk of being abandoned
by his companions.</p>

<p><b>STAITHES.</b>
</p>

<p>Most authorities say that Cook was bound apprentice to Mr.
Saunderson, a grocer and haberdasher of Staithes, at the age of
thirteen; but Mrs. Dodds, Saunderson's daughter, told Dr. Young
that, after leaving school, he remained on the farm, helping his
father, till 1745, when he was seventeen years old and then went to
Staithes to her father on a verbal agreement without indentures,
and would thus be free to leave or be discharged at any time.</p>

<p>The shop and house where he was engaged was situated about three
hundred yards from the present slipway, and close to the sea, in
fact so close that in 1812 it was threatened by the water, and was
pulled down by Saunderson's successor, Mr. John Smailey, and the
materials, as far as possible, were used in erecting the building
in Church Street which is now pointed out as Cook's Shop. The late
Mr. Waddington of Grosmont, near Whitby, says he visited Staithes
in 1887 and found the original site covered by deep water. He was
informed by an old man, who, as a boy, had assisted in removing the
stock from the old shop, that not only were the stones used again
in Church Street, but also most of the woodwork, including the
present door with its iron knocker, at which, probably, Cook
himself had knocked many a time.</p>

<p>At Staithes Cook remained as Saunderson's assistant for about
eighteen months, and it may easily be imagined how this growing lad
listened with all his ears to the tales of the old sailors
recalling brave deeds and strange experiences in storm and shine on
that element which for so many years was to be his home, and at
length, impelled by some instinctive feeling that on it lay the
path ready at his feet to lead him on to future distinction, he
vowed to himself that he would not bind down his life to the petty
round of a country storekeeper.</p>

<p>At length the opportunity came, which is related, in a breezy
and life-like manner, by Besant as follows. After painting
Saunderson's character in colours of a rather disagreeable hue, as
one too fond of his grog for himself and his stick for his
apprentices, he says that Cook stole a shilling out of the till,
packed up his luggage in a single pocket-handkerchief, ran away
across the moors to Whitby, found a ship on the point of sailing,
jumped on board, offered his services as cabin boy, was at once
accepted, showed himself so smart and attentive that he completely
won the heart of the sour-visaged mate, and through his good graces
was eventually bound apprentice to the owners of the ship, and thus
laid the foundation of his fortunes. This account does not explain
how it was that the dishonest runaway apprentice it depicts
continued to retain the friendship and esteem of his master and
Mrs. Dodds.</p>

<p><b>APPRENTICED TO THE SEA.</b>
</p>

<p>There undoubtedly was a difficulty about a shilling, and Dr.
Young's version, gathered from those who knew Cook personally and
lived in Staithes and Whitby at the time, is more probable. He says
that Cook had noticed a South Sea shilling, and being struck by the
unusual design (it was only coined in 1723), changed it for one of
his own. Saunderson had also noticed it, and when he missed it,
enquired for it perhaps in somewhat unmeasured terms, but, on the
matter being explained, was fully satisfied. Afterwards, seeing
that the boy was bent upon a sea life, he obtained the father's
permission, and took young James to Whitby himself, where he
introduced him to Mr. John Walker, a member of a shipping firm of
repute, to whom he was bound apprentice (not to the firm), and with
whom he never lost touch till the end of his life. The period of
apprenticeship was, on the authority of Messrs. John and Henry
Walker, three years, and not either seven or nine as is usually
stated, and the difficulty about being apprenticed to both
Saunderson and Walker is, of course, set at rest by Mrs. Dodd's
explanation.</p>

<p>Whitby was at the time a very important centre of the coasting
trade, and possessed several shipbuilding yards of good reputation,
and it was in a Whitby-built ship, the Freelove, that Cook made his
first voyage. She was a vessel of about 450 tons (some 80 tons
larger than the celebrated Bark Endeavour), was employed in the
coal trade up and down the east coast, and no doubt Cook picked up
many a wrinkle of seamanship and many a lesson of the value of
promptitude in the time of danger which would prove of service when
he came to the days of independent command: for the North Sea has,
from time immemorial, been reckoned a grand school from which to
obtain true sailormen for the Royal Service.</p>

<p>As usual in those days, Cook stayed in his employer's house in
the intervals between his trips, and his time ashore was longer
during the winter months as the ships were generally laid up. The
house in Grape Street, at present occupied by Mr. Braithwaite, is
pointed out as the one where he lived whilst with Mr. Walker; but
this is incorrect, for Mr. Waddington ascertained from the rate
books that Mr. Walker's mother was living there at that time, and
Mr. Walker lived in Haggargate from 1734 to 1751, removing thence
to the north side of Bakehouse Yard in that year, and to Grape
Street in 1752, after his mother's death. That is, he did not
reside in Grape Street till three years after Cook's apprenticeship
was ended, when, following the usual custom, he would have to fend
for himself. During these periods of leisure between his voyages,
Cook endeavoured to improve his store of knowledge, and it is
believed he received some instruction in elementary navigation. He
made great friends with Mr. Walker's housekeeper, Mary Prowd, from
whom he obtained the concession of a table and a light in a quiet
corner away from the others, where he might read and write in
peace. That he worked hard to improve himself is evident from the
fact that Mr. Walker pushed him on at every opportunity, and gave
him as varied an experience of things nautical as lay in his
power.</p>

<p>After several voyages in the Freelove (which is stated by the
Yorkshire Gazette to have been "lost, together with one hundred and
fifty passengers and the winter's supply of gingerbread for Whitby,
off either the French or Dutch coast" one stormy Christmas, the
date not given) Cook was sent to assist in rigging and fitting for
sea a vessel, called the Three Brothers, some 600 tons burden,
which was still in existence towards the close of last century.
When she was completed, Cook made two or three trips in her with
coals, and then she was employed for some months as a transport for
troops from Middleburg to Dublin and Liverpool. She was paid off by
the Government at Deptford in the spring of 1749, and then traded
to Norway, during which time Cook completed his apprenticeship,
that is, in July 1749. Cook told the naturalist of the second South
Sea voyage, Mr. Forster, that on one of his trips to Norway the
rigging of the ship was completely covered with birds that had been
driven off the land by a heavy gale, and amongst them were several
hawks who made the best of their opportunities with the small
birds.</p>

<p><b>OFFERED COMMAND.</b>
</p>

<p>When his apprenticeship had expired he went before the mast for
about three years. In 1750 he was in the Baltic trade on the Maria,
owned by Mr. John Wilkinson of Whitby, and commanded by Mr. Gaskin,
a relative of the Walkers. The following year he was in a Stockton
ship, and in 1752 he was appointed mate of Messrs. Walker's new
vessel, the Friendship, on board of which he continued for three
years, and of which, on the authority of Mr. Samwell, the surgeon
of the Discovery on the third voyage, who paid a visit to Whitby on
his return and received his information from the Walkers, he would
have been given the command had he remained longer in the
mercantile marine. This was rapid promotion for a youth with
nothing to back him up but his own exertions and strict attention
to duty, and tends to prove that he had taken full advantage of the
opportunities that fell in his way, and had even then displayed a
power of acquiring knowledge of his profession beyond the
average.</p>

<p>About this time Cook's father seems to have given up his
position at Airy Holme Farm and turned his attention to building. A
house in Ayton is still pointed out as his work, but has apparently
been partially rebuilt, for Dr. Young speaks of it as a stone
house, and it is now partly brick, but the stone doorway still
remains, with the initials J.G.C., for James and Grace Cook, and
the date 1755. The old man has been represented as completely
uneducated, but this cannot have been true. Colman in his Random
Recollections, writing of a visit he paid to Redcar about 1773,
relates how a venerable old man was pointed out who:</p>

<p>"only two or three years previously had learnt to read that he
might gratify a parent's pride and love by perusing his son's first
voyage round the world. He was the father of Captain Cook."</p>

<p>If it is true that he was the son of an Elder of the Scottish
Church, it is extremely improbable that he was entirely uneducated,
and the position he held as hind to Mr. Skottowe would necessitate
at any rate some knowledge of keeping farming accounts. More
convincing information still is to be found in the Leeds Mercury of
27th October 1883, where Mr. George Markham Tweddell, of Stokesley,
writes:</p>

<p>"I may mention that Captain Cook's father was not the illiterate
man he has been represented; and I have, lying on my study table as
I write, a deed bearing his signature, dated 1755; and the father's
signature bears a resemblance to that of his distinguished
son."</p>

<p>Reading is invariably learnt before writing, and as in 1755 the
old man was sixty-one, it is evident he did not wait till he was
eighty to learn to read.</p>

<p><b>FATHER'S GRAVE.</b>
</p>

<p>He claimed to have carved the inscription on the family
tombstone in Great Ayton churchyard, and after spending the last
years of his life under the roof of his son-in-law, James Fleck of
Redcar, he died on 1st April 1778, aged eighty-four years. He was
buried in Marske churchyard, but there was nothing to mark his
grave, and its place has long been forgotten. His death is
registered as that of a "day labourer."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2. 1755 TO 1757. H.M.S. EAGLE.</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748, troubles
were constantly arising between the French and English in which the
American Colonies of both nations took a conspicuous part, and
ultimately led to open war. The first shot was fired on 10th June
1755, although war was not formally declared till May 1756. In June
1755 the Friendship was in the Thames, and it is said that to avoid
the hot press which had been ordered Cook first went into hiding
for some time and then decided to volunteer. This is untrue, for,
as has been shown, he had already made up his mind and had refused
Messrs. Walker's offer of the command of one of their ships, the
acceptance of which would have saved him from the press as Masters
were exempt. He now saw his opportunity had come. He knew that
experienced men were difficult to obtain, that men of a certain
amount of nautical knowledge and of good character could soon raise
themselves above the rank of ordinary seamen, and had doubtless in
his mind many cases of those who entering as seamen found their way
to the quarterdeck, and knowing he had only to ask the Walkers for
letters of recommendation for them to be at his service, he
determined to take the important step and volunteer into the Royal
Navy. It must be remembered that this act of leaving employment
which, to most men of his position, would have seemed most
satisfactory, was not the act of hot-headed youth, no step taken in
mere spirit of adventure, but the calmly reasoned act of a man of
twenty-seven years and some eight or nine years experience of both
the rough and smooth sides of maritime life.</p>

<p>Several letters were written to Mr. Walker, one or two of which
relating to a later period were seen and copied by Dr. Young, but
they fell into the hand of a niece, who unfortunately, not
recognising their value, destroyed them shortly before her death,
which occurred some years ago. However, it is certain that he wrote
one about this time and evidently received a favourable reply, for
he shortly afterwards wrote again acknowledging the service done
him.</p>

<p><b>ENTERS NAVY.</b>
</p>

<p>Having made up his mind how to proceed, Cook went to a
rendezvous at Wapping and volunteered into H.M.S. Eagle, a
fourth-rate, 60-gun ship, with a complement of 400 men and 56
marines, at that time moored in Portsmouth Harbour. On the Muster
Roll, preserved in the Records Office, the following entry occurs:
"161 from London rendezvous, James Cook, A.B., entry, June 17th
1755, first appearance June 25th 1755." On the 24th July, that is,
thirty-seven days after the date of entry into the Navy, he is
rated as Master's mate, a position he held till 30th June 1757,
when he quitted H.M.S. Eagle.</p>

<p>His appointment was facilitated by the difficulty experienced in
obtaining men for the Service, as may be gathered from Captain
Hamar's letters, who writes applying to the Admiralty for
permission to break up his London Rendezvous, as he says it has
"procured very few men, and those only landsmen." Again, he
complains of the quality of the men he has received, and says he is
one hundred and forty short of his complement. In another
letter:</p>

<p>"I do not believe there is a worse man'd ship in the Navy.
Yesterday I received from the Bristol twenty-five supernumeraries
belonging to different ships, but not one seaman among them: but,
on the contrary, all very indifferent Landsmen."</p>

<p>These complaints were endorsed by Captain Pallisser, who
succeeded Hamar on the Eagle, for he wrote that some of the crew
were turned over from ship to ship so often that he was quite
unable to make out their original one:</p>

<p>"they being such that none choose to own them. Of forty-four
said to belong to the Ramilies, she wanted only six the other day,
but her boatswain could find out only those amongst them that he
thought worth having."</p>

<p>In the face of these deficiencies in quantity and quality of
men, and remembering the good character he doubtless obtained from
Mr. Walker, there can be no surprise that when Cook sailed out of
an English port for the first time as a Royal Navy sailor he held
the rating of Master's mate. It is usual to look upon him as an
explorer and surveyor only, but a little enquiry shows that he
played an active part in some of the most stirring events of the
next few years. The records of his personal deeds are wanting, but
his ships saw service, and from his character it is certain that
when duty called, James Cook would not be found wanting. Many of
the men under whom he served have left behind names that will
always be associated with the construction of the present British
Empire, and with most of them he was in immediate personal contact,
and obtained in every case their respect, in some their close
personal friendship.</p>

<p><b>PALLISSER COMMANDS.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 1st July the Eagle was ordered to fit and provision for
the Leeward Islands, but having received 62 men and 53 marines, the
orders were changed to cruise between Scilly and Cape Clear, and
she sailed on the 4th August. She was caught in a gale off the old
Head of Kinsale and received some damage, and her main mast was
reported as sprung, so she returned to Plymouth for survey and
repairs. Thinking that the removal of the mast would be a good
opportunity to scrape his ship, which was very foul, Captain Hamar
had her lightened for that purpose, but on examination the mast was
found to be in good order, and the Admiralty was so annoyed at the
absence of the ship from her cruising ground that they ordered
Captain Pallisser to take over the command and prepare for sea
without further loss of time. This he did on the 1st October, and
sailed from Plymouth on the 7th, and after cruising about in the
Channel and making a few small captures he returned on the 22nd
November, remaining till the 13th March; and during this time Cook
had a short spell of sickness, but it can hardly be called serious,
as he was only in hospital for ten days, being back to his duty on
the 17th February. In April, when "off the Isle of Bass, brought to
and sent on board the cutter a petty officer and five men with
arms, provisions, etc." This extract from the log records Cook's
first independent command; the cutter was one of two hired vessels
which had joined the squadron the previous day under convoy, and
the armed party was probably put on board as a precaution against
privateers who were at that time pretty busy on the French coast.
Cook took her into Plymouth Sound, and he and his five men went on
board the St. Albans, and in her rejoined his own ship on the 2nd
May, and then returned to Plymouth on the 4th June. Pallisser, in
reporting his arrival to the Secretary of the Admiralty, said that
he had:</p>

<p>"put ashore to the hospital 130 sick men, most of which are
extremely ill: buried in the last month twenty-two. The surgeon and
four men died yesterday, and the surgeon's two mates are extremely
ill: have thirty-five men absent in prizes and thirty-five short of
complement, so that we are now in a very weak condition."</p>

<p>This sickness and mortality was attributed to the absolute want
of proper clothing, many of the men having come on board with only
what they stood in and some in rags, so the Captain asked for
permission to issue an extra supply of slops, a request that was
immediately granted.</p>

<p><b>DUC D'AQUITAINE.</b>
</p>

<p>After another short cruise the Eagle returned to Plymouth with
Pallisser very ill with fever. He obtained sick leave, and Captain
Proby was ordered to take command, but was detained so long in the
Downs by contrary winds that Pallisser, who had heard a rumour of a
French squadron having been seen in the Channel, shook off his
fever and resumed the command of his ship, which was almost ready
for sea. Every part of the Channel mentioned in the rumour was
carefully searched, but no signs of the enemy were seen, and the
author of the report, a Swede, was detained in Portsmouth for some
months.</p>

<p>On the 19th November the Eagle's crew was increased to 420 men,
and she was kept cruising throughout the winter, and on the 4th
January 1757 she was caught in a heavy gale off the Isle of Wight,
where she had most of her sails blown out of her. On 25th May she
sailed from Plymouth Sound in company with H.M.S. Medway, and a day
or two afterwards they fell in with and chased a French East
Indiaman, the Duc d'Aquitaine, in rather heavy weather. The Medway
was leading, but when getting close, had to bring to in order to
clear for action, as otherwise she would be unable to open her lee
ports. Pallisser, on the other hand, was all ready, and pressed on,
bringing the chase to action. After a hard set-to, lasting about
three-quarters of an hour, the Frenchman struck, having lost 50 men
killed and 30 wounded, whilst the Eagle lost 10 killed and 80
wounded; and the list of damages to the ship reported to the
Admiralty shows that the action was sharp though short. The Medway
was only able to afford assistance by firing a few raking shots,
and suffered no damage except having ten men wounded by an
accidental explosion of gunpowder. The masts and sails of the prize
were so much damaged that she lost them all in the night; one of
the masts in falling sank the Medway's cutter. It was found she had
a complement of 493 men, and was armed with 50 guns. She had landed
her East Indian cargo at Lisbon, and then proceeded to cruise for
fourteen days on the look-out for an English convoy sailing in
charge of H.M.S. Mermaid. She had succeeded in picking up one
prize, an English brig, which was ransomed for &pound;200. This was
Cook's first experience of an important naval action, and Pallisser
was complimented by the Lords of the Admiralty for his gallant
conduct. The Duc d'Aquitaine was purchased for the Navy, and was
entered under her own name as a third-rate, 64 gun ship, with a
complement of 500 men.</p>

<p>The Eagle returned with her consort and her prize to Plymouth,
and soon afterwards Cook's connection with her came to an end.
According to Dr. Kippis, Mr. Walker had interested the Member for
Scarborough, Mr. Osbaldiston, on the subject of Cook's promotion,
but the rule was that candidates for Lieutenancy must have been
employed on board a king's ship for a period of not less than six
years, and an order had recently been issued that this regulation
was to be strictly adhered to. Captain Pallisser therefore wrote to
Mr. Osbaldiston that Cook:</p>

<p>"had been too short a time in the service for a commission, but
that a Master's warrant might be given him, by which he would be
raised to a station that he was well qualified to discharge with
ability and credit."</p>

<p>The result of this correspondence is shown in the Eagle's muster
roll, for on 27th June James Cook attended his last muster, and on
the 30th he was discharged. The succeeding rolls registering "D.
30th June 1757. Solebay prefmnt."</p>

<p><b>THE MERCURY COOK.</b>
</p>

<p>At this point all the writers on Captain Cook have been led into
error by following the lead of Dr. Kippis. Everyone (with the
single exception of Lord Brougham, who by an evident slip of the
pen puts him on board the Mersey) writes that he was appointed
Master of H.M.S. Mercury, and that he joined the fleet of Admiral
Saunders in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the time of the capture of
Quebec in that ship. From the Public Records it has been
ascertained that the Mercury was not in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
with Saunders, but in the latter half of 1759 was sent to New York,
thence to Boston, and was at Spithead in April the following year.
The same source also shows that not only was the Circumnavigator
never on board the Mercury in any capacity, but in all probability
he never even saw her. He is also said to have been Master's mate
on the Pembroke, and Dr. Kippis has him appointed to three
different ships on three consecutive days: the Grampus, but she
sailed before Cook could join her; the Garland, but she was found
to have a Master when Cook joined; and, lastly, the Mercury.</p>

<p>The explanation of this confusion as far as the Mercury is
concerned (the rest was imagination) is that there was a second
James Cook in the service, who was appointed Master of the Mercury
under a warrant dated 15th May 1759 and entered on his duties
immediately. He was with his ship at Sheerness on 12th July, at
which time his namesake was before Quebec. On the return of the
Mercury from Boston her Master was returned for some time as "sick
on shore," and on 11th June 1760 was superseded by one John
Emerton. Soon after he was appointed third lieutenant of the
Gosport, his commission bearing date 1st April 1760, that is before
he left the Mercury. He was with his new ship at the recapture of
St. John's, Newfoundland, in 1762, with John Jervis, afterwards
Lord St. Vincent, as his Captain. In 1765 he was on the Wolf on the
Jamaica station, and was selected by Admiral Burnaby to carry
despatches to the Governor of Yucatan. This duty he successfully
carried out, and in 1796 published a pamphlet describing his
adventures during the journey. On his return to England he applied
to the Duke of Newcastle for the command of a cutter, and the
letter is now in the British Museum, having been included in a
collection in mistake for one written by his celebrated namesake.
There is a certain similarity in the writing, but in the signature
he writes the Christian name as Jas, whilst Captain Cook usually
wrote Jams. The Mercury Cook was lieutenant of the Speedwell in
1773, and having had some property left him in Jersey he received
leave of absence in August. He never rose above lieutenant, and
disappears from the Navy List after July 1800.</p>

Eagle is now in the possession of Mr. Alexander Turnbull of

<h2>CHAPTER 3. 1757 TO 1759. H.M.S. PEMBROKE.</h2>

<p>Cook joined H.M.S. Solebay on the 30th July 1757 at Leith, where
she was then stationed, but the date of his warrant has not been
ascertained, although the Public Records and Trinity House have
both been searched for the purpose. His stay was not long, for
after a cruise of a few days she returned to Leith, and on 17th
September Cook was superseded by John Nichols; in fact, his time on
board was so short that his signature is not appended to any of the
rolls.</p>

<p>In April 1757 Mr. Bissett, who was Master of the Eagle when Cook
was Master's mate, and who therefore would have a better chance
than any one else to measure his subordinate's character and
capabilities, was appointed Master of H.M.S. Pembroke, a new ship,
and superintended her fitting for sea. On 26th October he found
himself transferred to the Stirling Castle, and it is only
reasonable to suppose that, having formed a high opinion of Cook's
work, and knowing of his ambition to rise in the service, he would
give information of the opportunity and, as far as he could, push
forward his friend's interests. At any rate, the Muster Rolls show
that in less than six weeks from leaving the Solebay, Cook was
established on board the Pembroke as Master, under a warrant
bearing date 18th October 1757, and entered upon his duties on 27th
October, the twenty-ninth anniversary of his birth; and from that
date to his discharge into the Northumberland he signed the usual
documents. At the time of his joining, the ship was fitting and
victualling for sea at Portsmouth, and on 8th November she sailed
for the Bay of Biscay, under the command of Captain Simcoe,
returning to Plymouth on 9th February 1758.</p>

<p><b>LOUISBERG.</b>
</p>

<p>The British Government had decided on making a determined effort
to wrest the Colony of New France from the hands of the French, and
one of the few steps was to attempt the capture of the port of
Louisburg, at the entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence; a place
which the enemy were said to have rendered almost impregnable at an
expenditure of some million and a quarter pounds. They looked upon
it as second only to Quebec in its importance to the safe keeping
of the colony. In order to carry out this design a fleet was
prepared under Admiral Boscawen (known to his men as Old
Dreadnought, and, from a peculiar carriage of the head, said to
have been contracted from a youthful habit of imitating one of his
father's old servants, Wry-necked-Dick), to convey a small army
under Major-General Amherst to the scene of action. Boscawen sailed
with his fleet, one member of which was the Pembroke, for Halifax,
where they arrived, via Madeira and the Bermudas, on 8th May.</p>

<p>Having completed his arrangements, Boscawen left Halifax on 28th
May with 17 sail of the Royal Navy and 127 transports, picking up 2
more men-of-war and 8 transports just outside, and a couple more of
the latter a few hours later. He had to leave behind at Halifax,
with orders to rejoin him as soon as they were fit, several ships,
the Pembroke being one, as their crews were so weakened by scurvy
during the voyage from England. The Pembroke had lost 29 men, but
was sufficiently recovered to be able to sail with 3 transports, 2
schooners, and a cattle sloop on 7th June, and arrived off
Louisburg on the 12th, four days too late to take part in the
landing which had been successfully carried out in the face of
great difficulties caused by the roughness of the weather, the
rocky coast, and the opposition of the enemy. In fact, James Wolfe,
who was a Brigadier throughout the siege, and on whose shoulders a
very large portion of the work seems to have fallen, says: "Our
landing was next to miraculous." There were 3 officers and 49 men
killed; 5 officers and 59 men wounded of the army; 11 men killed,
and 4 officers and 29 men wounded of the navy; and 19 men wounded
of the transport service. The weather was so bad that no stores or
artillery could be landed for several days, the first gun being got
ashore on the 16th, so Cook was in plenty of time to take his share
in the difficult task of landing supplies; a task so dangerous that
the fleet lost one hundred boats in this duty alone. As well as
forming the supply base for the army, the fleet also provided 583
men to act as gunners and engineers ashore; but none of these were
from the Pembroke. The nature of the ground rendered the work of
constructing the approaches and batteries extremely difficult, and
it was not till 20th June that the first gun opened fire. Wolfe
formed a battery on Lighthouse Point, one side of the entrance to
the harbour whilst the town was on the other side, with a fortified
island in between; and the harbour held a French fleet which, at
the time of the arrival of the British, consisted of nine
men-of-war. One escaped on the very day of the landing, and was
shortly afterwards followed by two more. One L'Echo, was captured
by Sir Charles Hardy, and was taken into the British Navy; whilst
the other, though chased for some distance, made good its escape to
L'Orient with the first news of the siege. Previously to the coming
of the British, two ships had been sunk in the harbour's mouth to
render entrance therein difficult; two more were added to these,
and then a fifth. One ship was blown up by a British shell, and
setting fire to two others that lay alongside her, they also were
destroyed.</p>

<p>The fate of the other two is described in the Pembroke's log,
kept by Cook, as follows:</p>

<p>"In the night 50 boats man'd and arm'd row'd into the harbour
under the command of the Captains La Foure [Laforey] of the Hunter,
and Balfour [of the Etna] in order to cut away the 2 men-of-warr
and tow them into the North-East Harbour one of which they did
viz.: the Ben Fison [Bienfaisant] of 64 guns, the Prudon [Prudent]
74 guns being aground was set on fire. At 11 A.M. the firing ceased
on both sides."</p>

<p>The boats concerned in this attack, which Boscawen describes as
"a very brilliant affair, well carried out," were a barge and
pinnace or cutter from all the ships, except the Northumberland,
which was too sickly, commanded by a lieutenant, mate or
midshipman, and Dr. Grahame in his History of the United States of
North America, says:</p>

<p>"The renowned Captain Cook, then serving as a petty officer on
board of a British ship-of-war, co-operated in this exploit, and
wrote an account of it to a friend in England. That he had
distinguished himself may be inferred from his promotion to the
rank of lieutenant in the Royal Navy, which took place immediately
after."</p>

<p>This statement that he was in the affair may be true, but there
is no evidence on the point, and as he was a warrant and not petty
officer, and as his promotion did not take place for several years,
Dr. Grahame's story may well be doubted. It is believed that Cook
did write to Mr. Walker from Louisburg, but the letter was one of
those so unfortunately destroyed.</p>

<p>The loss on this occasion to the British was very slight, there
being only 7 killed and 9 wounded. The Bienfaisant having been
surveyed, was received into the Navy and given to Captain Balfour
whilst the command of L'Echo was conferred on Captain Laforey.</p>

<p>In consequence of this success and the threat of an immediate
assault on the town, the French commander, M. Drucour, decided to
surrender on the following day. This success was highly esteemed in
England, and Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst received the
thanks of the Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p><b>WOLFE AND HARDY.</b>
</p>

<p>After the siege Wolfe wrote to Lord George Sackville, speaking
in warm terms of Boscawen and his men, and says:</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Hardy, too, in particular, and all the officers of
the Navy in general have given us their utmost assistance, and with
the greatest cheerfulness imaginable. I have often been in pain for
Sir Charles's squadron at an anchor off the harbour's mouth. They
rid out some very hard gales of wind rather than leave an opening
for the French to escape, but, notwithstanding the utmost diligence
on his side, a frigate found means to get out and is gone to Europe
charge de fanfaronades. I had the satisfaction of putting 2 or 3
hautvizier shells into her stern and to shatter him a little with
some of your Lordship's 24 pound shot, before he retreated, and I
much question whether he will hold out the voyage."</p>

<p>The Pembroke formed one of this squadron under Sir Charles
Hardy, and after the capitulation of the town, was despatched with
nine other ships, and a small body of troops under Wolfe to harry
the French settlements around Gaspe Bay as a preparation for the
attack on Quebec it was intended to make in the following year.
Several settlements and magazines were destroyed, four guns and a
pair of colours were captured, and then the squadron returned to
Halifax for the winter.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Charles Saunders was selected to command the fleet
that was to be employed in this new movement against the capital of
New France; a man of whom Horace Walpole wrote:</p>

<p>"The Admiral was a pattern of the most sturdy bravery, united
with the most unaffected modesty. No man said less, or deserved
more. Simplicity in his manners, generosity, and good-nature
adorned his genuine love of his country."</p>

<p><b>WITH DURELL'S SQUADRON.</b>
</p>

<p>He left Spithead on 17th February 1759, with the intention of
calling at Louisburg, the appointed rendezvous for the expedition,
on his way to Halifax; but the season had been so severe that
Louisburg, usually free from ice, was found to be unapproachable,
so he went on, arriving at Halifax on 30th April. Admiral Durell
had been sent out earlier from England, and was now despatched from
Halifax with a squadron, of which the Pembroke was one, to prevent,
if possible, the entry into the river of the usual spring fleet
from France with supplies and reinforcements for Quebec, and to
keep the French from putting up any fortifications on the Ile aux
Coudres, thereby adding to the difficulties of the fleet in
ascending this dangerous portion of river. The weather was bad, and
the trouble caused by fog and ice so great that Durell found the
fleet of 18 sail, convoyed by two frigates, had escaped him, but
one or two small store ships were captured which proved of service
to the British afterwards. On the way up the Gulf, Captain Simcoe
of the Pembroke died, and the ship was given temporarily to
Lieutenant Collins of Durell's ship, and afterwards to Captain
Wheelock, who remained in her till after Cook left.</p>

<p>Durell's squadron arrived off the Ile aux Coudres on the 25th,
and on the 28th the Pembroke landed the troops she had on board,
"as did ye rest of ye men of warr," and they took possession of the
island, which was found to be deserted by its inhabitants. The
troops that were on board Durell's ships were under the command of
Colonel Carleton, the Quartermaster-General of the force, and
Wolfe's great friend, whose services had only been obtained from
the king with the greatest difficulty. Whilst awaiting the arrival
of Saunders with the remainder of the expeditionary force, every
endeavour was made to gain knowledge of the difficulties of the
river, and Cook's log notes how the boats were out "sounding ye
channel of ye Traverse"; and on the 11th June there is: "Returned
satisfied with being acquainted with ye Channel." The Traverse here
spoken of is that channel running from a high black-looking cape,
known as Cape Torment, across into the south channel, passing
between the east end of the Ile d'Orleans and Ile Madame. It is
still looked upon as one of the worst pieces of the river
navigation.</p>

<p>The British had some charts of the river showing the course
taken by the French vessels, for in a note to the orders issued by
Saunders on 15th May to the Masters of Transports, special
attention is called to "a plan or chart showing the route which His
Excellency intends to make from Louisburg Harbour to the Island of
Bic"; and this chart was most probably taken from one captured by
Boscawen in 1755, and published in September 1759 by T. Kitchen in
the London Magazine having the Traverse shown on a larger scale.
The soundings taken at the time Durell was waiting would be to
verify those shown on this chart.</p>

<p>After a short delay in Halifax, Saunders left for Louisburg to
gather up the remainder of the forces and stores, and on his
arrival still found the port hampered by ice; in fact, Major Knox,
of the 43rd Regiment, relates that even so late as 1st June men
were able to get ashore from their ships, stepping from one piece
of ice to another. There was also further cause for
dissatisfaction, delay in the arrival of the ships with soldiers
and stores. Some of the troops had been directed to other work
without any intimation to Wolfe, whilst others were in a very bad
state from scurvy and measles; some had lost their entire
equipment, and it was with the greatest difficulty replaced; the
supply of money was criminally small, and yet it is pleasant to
read on the authority of Major Knox that:</p>

<p>"I had the inexpressible pleasure to observe at Louisburg that
our whole armament, naval and military, were in high spirits; and
though, by all accounts, we shall have a numerous army and a
variety of difficulties to cope with, yet, under such Admirals and
Generals, among whom we have the happiness to behold the most
cordial unanimity, together with so respectable a fleet and a body
of well-appointed regular troops, we have every reason to hope for
the greatest success."</p>

<p><b>ORDERS TO TRANSPORTS.</b>
</p>

<p>Before leaving, Saunders issued his instructions as to the order
of sailing. He divided the transports into two divisions, the
Starboard flying a red flag, and the Larboard a white one: he
assigned to each vessel its position and duties, and pointed out to
each Master of a hired transport that if the orders of his officers
were not promptly and exactly carried out they would be fired on,
adding with a touch of grim humour that the cost of the powder and
shot so expended would be carefully noted and charged against the
hire of the offending ship. On the 6th June Saunders was off
Newfoundland with 22 men-of-war and 119 transports, and the cold
winds blowing off the snow-covered hills of that island were
severely felt by the troops. On the 18th, when off the Island of
Bic, they were joined by Wolfe in the Richmond, and five days after
picked up Durell at the Ile aux Coudres. Here Saunders transferred
his flag to the Stirling Castle, which he had selected in England
for the purpose, owing to her handiness (Cook's friend, Mr.
Bissett, was still on board), and leaving Durell with eleven of the
deepest draught to guard against any interference from a French
fleet, he proceeded up the river with the remainder. The work was
hard, constantly anchoring and weighing to take every advantage of
wind and tide, and the progress was slow; but at length the whole
of the ships passed the Traverse, and on the 26th the fleet
anchored off St. Laurent, on the Ile d'Orleans, and the troops were
landed on the following day. Thus the much-dreaded passage up the
St. Lawrence had been carried out, and the fact that no loss of any
kind had occurred to either man-of-war or transport, reflects the
very greatest credit on all engaged in the operation. Knox relates
how the Master of the transport he was on, a Brother of Trinity
House and Thames pilot, named Killick, refused the services of a
French prisoner as pilot, and observing, "Damme, I'll show them an
Englishman can go where a Frenchman dar'n't show his nose," took
his ship up himself, chaffing the occupants of the mark boats as he
passed, and in the end declared that it was no worse than the
Thames.</p>

<p>The wonderful success of their passage was emphasised the
afternoon after their arrival at St. Laurent when a heavy gale
struck the fleet, driving several ships into collision or ashore,
and causing considerable loss in anchors and cables. As soon as
possible the men-of-war boats were out rendering every assistance,
and all the vessels were secured but two, which were too firmly
fixed to be towed off shore, and these were soon afterwards burnt
by the enemy.</p>

<p><b>FIREWORKS.</b>
</p>

<p>Thinking to profit by the disorder which must necessarily have
been caused by the storm, the French made a determined attempt to
destroy the fleet by means of eight fireships which were floated
down stream on the unsuspecting British. Fortunately they were
ignited prematurely, and the boats of the Pembroke and other ships
were again out, employed in the hazardous task of towing these
undesired visitors into such places as would permit them to burn
themselves out without danger to the shipping. Six were quickly got
into safety, whilst the other two grounded and burnt out without
causing further inconvenience. Captain Knox describes the scene as
a display of "the grandest fireworks that can possibly be
conceived." The only result was to cause the retirement of a picket
at the western end of the Ile d'Orleans, and the officer in
command, who thought he was about to be attacked in force, was to
have been tried by court-martial, but being advised to throw
himself on Wolfe's mercy, was pardoned for his error of judgment.
To guard against a repetition of such an attack, a system of guard
boats, some moored across the river and some patrolling, was
established, entailing considerable extra work on the sailors.</p>

<p>An examination of the position showed Admiral Saunders that the
safety of the fleet, and therefore the interests of the army, would
be best consulted if he proceeded into the Basin of Quebec, as to
remain cooped up in the south channel added to the danger if a
further attempt should be made to fire the fleet. He therefore
pointed out to Wolfe that the small battery established by the
French on Point Levi, which threatened any ship entering into the
Basin, should be taken, and the Point occupied. This was at once
carried out by Monckton's brigade, and a battery was established
which did serious damage to the town. When too late the French sent
over three floating batteries to aid in repulsing the English, but
they were driven back by one broadside from a frigate Saunders
moved up for the purpose.</p>

<p>Montcalm had entrenched his army on the north bank of the St.
Lawrence, between the rivers Charles and Montmorenci, and Wolfe
determined to seize on a piece of high ground to the east of the
Montmorenci, to form a camp there, and endeavour to force on a
general action. In pursuance of this design, a body of about 3000
men were landed successfully on 9th July, under the protecting fire
of some of the fleet, and a camp was formed, and the next few days
provided employment for the boats of the Pembroke and other ships
in landing men, stores, and artillery. The bombardment of the town
opened on 12th July from the batteries erected at Point Levi and a
portion of the fleet, and continued with little intermission till
13th September. When fire was opened on the town other ships in the
Basin and guns at the camp at Montmorenci opened on Montcalm's
lines at Beauport. On the 18th two men-of-war, two armed sloops and
two transports succeeded in passing the town without loss, but a
third ship, the Diana, ran aground in trying to avoid collision
with a transport, and was attacked by the enemy's boats, but was
brought off by the Pembroke and Richmond. She was so seriously
damaged that she had to be sent to Boston for repairs and then
returned to England. On the 20th Wolfe joined the up-river squadron
in a barge, and in passing the town had his mast carried away by a
shot from the Sillery Battery, but no further damage was done. He
made a short reconnaissance which led to nothing at the time, but
may have had an important influence in the choice of a
landing-place afterwards.</p>

<p><b>ATTACK ON BEAUPORT.</b>
</p>

<p>On his return to his camp at Montmorenci he decided to make an
attack on the left of the French lines from boats and from his camp
over a ford which was available at low tide between the falls of
Montmorenci and the St. Lawrence. This attack was to be supported
by the Centurion, moored in the north channel, and by two armed
cats which were to be run aground as near as possible to some small
redoubts, the first object of the attack. Here it is certain that
Wolfe and Cook came into personal contact, for on the latter fell
the duty of taking the necessary soundings for the position to be
occupied by the cats, and Wolfe refers in a despatch to a
conversation he had with Cook upon the matter. The attack took
place on 31st July, aided by the fire of the Pembroke, Trent, and
Richmond, which were "anchored clear over to the north shore before
Beauport, a brisk firing on both sides," but the boats were thrown
into confusion by a reef (marked on the chart as visible at low
water), and were some time before they could effect a landing, then
a heavy storm of rain came on, rendering the ground, which was
steep, very slippery. The troops occupied one redoubt, but were so
dominated by the French musketry that they could get no further,
and Wolfe deemed it desirable to recall them and to stop the
advance across the ford. The two cats were burnt to prevent them
falling into the hands of the enemy, and the losses of the English
in killed, wounded, and missing were 443, those of the French being
estimated at 200. Cook says the repulse was solely owing to the
heavy fire from the entrenchments, "which soon obliged our Troops
to retreat back to the Boats and Montmorency"; whilst Wolfe, in a
general order, throws the blame on the Louisburg Grenadiers, a
picked body of men from several regiments, whom he considers got
out of hand. He also, in a despatch submitted to Saunders, threw
some amount of blame on the Navy, but to this the Admiral strongly
objected, and it was withdrawn, Wolfe saying: "I see clearly
wherein I have been deficient; and think a little more or less
blame to a man that must necessarily be ruined, of little or no
consequence."</p>

<p>It has been asserted that Cook led the boats to the attack, but
as this was done by Wolfe himself, according to his own letters,
and as Saunders was also out with them, both officers having narrow
escapes, it seems more probable that Cook would be on his own ship,
where, as she was engaged, his services would be wanted, for it was
one of the Master's most important duties to work her under the
Captain's orders when in action.</p>

<p>A few days before this attack on Beauport was made, the French
again paid the fleet the undesired attention of a large fire raft
composed of several small vessels chained together and laden with
all sorts of combustibles&mdash;shells, guns loaded to the muzzle,
tar barrels, etc., and again this was grappled by the boats and
towed away to a place of safety; and then Wolfe, sending in a flag
of truce the next morning, said that if the performance were
repeated he should cause the instrument of destruction to be towed
alongside two ships in which he had Canadian prisoners, and there
let it do its worst. This somewhat cold-blooded threat was
sufficient, and the experiment was not repeated.</p>

<p><b>A NARROW ESCAPE.</b>
</p>

<p>During the time the fleet was occupying the Basin, the Masters
of the ships were constantly out making observations and sounding,
partly for the necessities of the fleet and partly to throw dust in
the eyes of the French; and on one occasion Cook had a narrow
escape from capture, his men had to row for it to get away from the
enemy, and reaching the Isle of Orleans landed just in time, for as
Cook, the last man, sprang ashore from the bows an Indian boarded
over the stern. The hospital picket turned out, and the French
retreated. His friend, Mr. Bissett, was not so fortunate, being
taken prisoner on 7th July whilst sounding in the north channel;
but he was either exchanged or escaped, for he was only absent from
his ship for a few days.</p>

<p>Wolfe, who was almost always ailing, had an attack of fever, and
the worry of the repulse at Beauport rendered him incapable of duty
for some days; he therefore laid before his Brigadiers plans of
future movements, asking their opinions and advice. These plans
were not approved, but it was suggested that an attempt should be
made to land on the western side of the town and there bring the
enemy to action, and Wolfe writes: "I have acquiesced in their
Proposal, and we are preparing to put it into execution."</p>

<p>The up-river detachment had been strengthened by the addition of
a few more vessels, and Murray with 1200 men had joined in an
unsuccessful attempt to get at the French supply fleet which had
retreated to a place of safety. He had outwitted De Bougainville,
who was detached to watch him, and succeeded in destroying a
magazine containing clothing, powder, and other stores, and
intercepted letters which told of the surrender of Niagara and the
retirement of Bourlemaque upon the Ile aux Noix, to which place
Amherst was preparing to follow.</p>

<p>When Wolfe's resolve was taken to follow the advice of his
Brigadiers, Saunders again strengthened the force above the town,
placing the squadron under the command of Admiral Holmes, and on
3rd September his boats withdrew the artillery and troops from
Montmorenci to Point Levi, and on the night of the 4th all the
available boats and small craft were sent up, one of the last to
pass being a small schooner armed with a few swivels, and called by
the sailors The Terror of France. She sailed by in broad daylight,
drawing the fire of every gun that could be brought to bear on her,
but was untouched, and, anchoring close alongside the Admiral's
ship, gave him a salute from the whole of her armament.</p>

<p>The troops which had been quietly marched some distance up the
south bank from Point Levi were taken on board the ships, the last
detachment on the night of the 12th; and Admiral Holmes sailed up
the river as if to beat up the French communications, but when
night fell he returned, and the landing was successfully
accomplished, and is described by Saunders in his despatch as
follows:</p>

<p>"The night of their landing, Admiral Holmes with the ships and
troops was about three leagues above the intended landing-place.
General Wolfe with about half his troops set off in the boats, and
dropped down with the tide, and were by that means less liable to
be discovered by the sentinels posted all along the coast. The
ships followed them about three-quarters of an hour afterwards, and
got to the landing-place just at the time that had been concerted
to cover the landing, and considering the darkness of the night,
and the rapidity of the current, this was a very critical
operation, and very properly and successfully conducted."</p>

<p>In the meantime the ships in the Basin, some fifteen in number,
distracted the attention of the French by a heavy cannonade on the
Beauport lines, and the boats made a feint as if an attack were
contemplated; buoys had been laid in such a way as to lead to the
idea that the ships were going to moor as close in as possible as
if to support an assault, and every effort was made to draw
attention away from the movement up above.</p>

<p><b>THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM.</b>
</p>

<p>Lieutenant Norman, of the Pembroke, shortly describes the battle
in his log:</p>

<p>"At 4 A.M. General Wolfe landed just below Cape Diamond with the
whole army. At 8 the signal of Boats man'd and arm'd to go to Point
Levi, weighed and dropped hier up. About 10 the enemy march'd up
and attacked General Wolfe, the action lasted not 10 minutes before
the Enemy gave way and run in the Greatest Confusion and left us a
compleat Victuary. Our Army encamped on the plain a back of the
Town and made the necessary disposition for carrying on ye siege.
Admiral Holmes hoisted his flag on board the Lowestaff, just off
the Landing place. In this action fell General Wolfe, of the enemy
General Montcalm and his two seconds."</p>

<p>Cook does not mention the death of Wolfe, but says "the troops
continued the pursuit to the very gates of the city, afterward they
begun to form the necessary dispositions for carrying on the
siege."</p>

<p>Cook is said by some writers to have piloted the troops to the
landing-place, and has even been set within hearing of the
legendary recitation by Wolfe of Gray's Elegy, but as he was out
with the Pembroke's boats in the Basin at the time Holmes started
up the river, and was probably on his ship, with his hands full
driving the bombardment, and the recital of the Elegy at such a
time was probably a myth, the traditions may be put down to
imagination. The boats were piloted to the landing by Captain Chads
of H.M.S. Vesuvius.</p>

<p>The town having surrendered five days after the battle, the
movements made by Saunders in the Basin no doubt aiding M. de
Ramesay, the Governor, in coming to a decision, General Murray was
left with a garrison, and the fleet sailed for England, sending a
detachment of the Northumberland and six others to Halifax with
orders that Captain Lord Colville was to hoist the Broad Pennant as
Commander-in-Chief of the North American Station, and as soon as
the season opened he was to return to the St. Lawrence to render
support to any further movements made in Canada.</p>

<p><b>APPOINTMENT TO H.M.S. NORTHUMBERLAND.</b>
</p>

<p>Before the fleet left, however, Cook's connection with H.M.S.
Pembroke came to an end. Captain King, who was with Cook on his
last voyage, writes to Dr. Douglas that he does not know the exact
date of Cook's appointment to the Northumberland, but he was
certainly Master of that ship in 1758. Here King is in error, for
Lieutenant James Norman, of the Pembroke, has the following entry
in his log under date 23rd September 1759: "Mr. Cook, Master,
superseded and sent on board the Northumberland, per order of
Admiral Saunders." It has been said that Lord Colville made this
appointment, but of course he could not do so, though he may
perhaps have applied for Cook's services, but it is far more
probable that the appointment was made by Saunders for the special
purpose of having the survey of the St. Lawrence thoroughly well
carried out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4. 1759 TO 1762. H.M.S. NORTHUMBERLAND.</h2>

<p>On the way down the river from Quebec, the fleet appears to have
found the passage very difficult, the dangers of the Channel being
aggravated by the strength of the current and bad weather. The
Captain, Vesuvius, and Royal William were aground for some time,
but were ultimately got off again without much damage; and the
Terrible, which was drifting and in great danger, was only brought
up by means of an anchor constructed for the occasion by lashing
one of the quarter-deck guns to two small anchors. When her large
anchors were hauled up they were found to be broken; and so great
was the loss of these articles that Lord Colville was obliged to
press the Admiralty for a fresh supply to be sent out immediately,
as he found it impossible to replace those lost in the Traverse
either at Boston or any other place in America.</p>

<p><b>RELIEF OF QUEBEC.</b>
</p>

<p>Colville's squadron arrived in Halifax on 27th October, Cook's
thirty-first birthday, and as soon as the winter was over, and the
ships were cleaned and fitted for sea as well as the limited
appliances would permit, it left for the St. Lawrence, sailing on
22nd April 1760, but was "so retarded by frozen fogs, seas of
compacted ice, and contrary winds," that it did not arrive off the
Ile de Bic before 16th May. Here they were met by a sloop with the
news that Quebec was in urgent need of help. General Murray,
hearing of the approach of General de Levis, with a French force,
had left the shelter of the forts, and notwithstanding he was
greatly outnumbered, had offered battle in the open. He had at
first chosen a strong position, but hearing from spies that the
French were busy cleaning their arms after being caught in a heavy
storm the night before, he advanced upon them, and owing to the
sudden attack and the superiority of his artillery, at first gained
a considerable advantage, but afterwards the weight of numbers
told, and the British were forced to retire to the town with sadly
reduced numbers, and Quebec was again besieged. On receipt of this
news Colville pushed on with his squadron, and the arrival of the
Vanguard and Diamond on the 17th, followed by the Northumberland
and the remainder on the next day, caused the French to retire.</p>

<p>During the next four months the fleet passed an uneventful time
in the Canadian waters, the flagship being moored in the Basin, and
then on the 12th September they received the acceptable news that
Montreal and the rest of the province of New France had surrendered
to General Amherst, and on 10th October the squadron again returned
to Halifax to winter quarters.</p>

<p>On 19th January 1761, Lord Colville records in his Journal that
he had "directed the storekeeper to pay the Master of the
Northumberland, &pound;fifty in consideration of his indefatigable
industry in making himself master of the pilotage of the River St.
Lawrence." This is the first official recognition that has been
found of the fact that Cook had gone beyond the ordinary duties
incumbent on every Master in His Majesty's Service, namely: "To
observe all coasts, shoals, and rocks, taking careful notes of the
same." There is no record in any of the official documents that
Cook was specially engaged in surveying the river, but it is very
evident from this entry that he must have done the work during the
four months that his ship was moored in the Basin of Quebec. That
is to say, his promotion to the Northumberland was previous to, and
not a consequence of his survey of the river, and that it was on
account of his fitness for the work, and not because it had been
done, as is constantly asserted, that he had been selected.</p>

<p><b>THE NORTH AMERICAN PILOT.</b>
</p>

<p>Admiral Saunders had issued orders the previous year, that the
general instructions of the Admiralty as to taking observations,
soundings, and bearings were to be carefully carried out, and the
information obtained was, as opportunity offered, to be forwarded
to him "so that all existing charts may be corrected and improved."
This information, in the ordinary course, would be handed to Mr.
Bissett, the Master of the flagship, for comparison and
compilation, and he, knowing Cook's fitness for the work, may have
asked for his assistance and thus introduced him to the notice of
Saunders, noted for his quick eye for merit, who, seeing his
aptitude, selected him for the completion of the task. Saunders,
after his return to England, wrote to the Secretary of the
Admiralty, on 22nd April 1760, saying that he had, ready for
publication, a Draught of the River St. Lawrence with its harbours,
bays, and islands, and asked for their Lordships' directions
thereon. With their Lordships' approval it was published, and may
be found at the end of The North American Pilot, London, 1775,
together with other maps, some of which are Cook's work. At the
commencement of the book is a letter from Cook to the compiler of
the volume, congratulating him on the collection, and referring to
the fact that some of the charts contain his work, but he does not
lay claim to any special ones. On Saunders' chart there is a long
note which concludes:</p>

<p>"The distances between Isle Coudre and Isle of Orleans, the
Pillar Rocks and Shoals in the south channel were accurately
determined by triangles. The other parts of this chart were taken
from the best French Draughts of this River."</p>

<p>It is doubtful if this triangulation could have been carried out
by Cook during his passage up and then down the river, the only
time he had in 1759, but if it were, it argues much greater
knowledge of nautical surveying than he is generally supposed to
have had at the time.</p>

<p>During the winters that the Northumberland stayed in Halifax
Harbour, Cook employed his spare time in improving his knowledge of
all subjects that were likely to be of service to him in his
profession. He read Euclid for the first time, and entered upon a
study of higher mathematics, especially devoting himself to
astronomy. King in his sketch of Cook's life, says, on the
authority of the man himself, that these studies were carried on
"without any other assistance than what a few books and his own
industry afforded him."</p>

<p>At the opening of the season, Lord Colville dispersed his
squadron to those stations where their services appeared most
necessary, and remained with his ship at Halifax, as it was
considered inadvisable to leave such an important naval post open
to attack from the French or the Spaniards. He had been advised by
despatches, dated 26th December 1761, that war had been declared
with the latter nation. During this period of waiting the words
"nothing remarkable" are in constant use in Captain Adams's (the
second Captain of the Northumberland) Journal. Cook utilised this
time to make a thorough survey of Halifax Harbour, the notes of
which are now in the United Service Museum, Whitehall.</p>

<p>At length the period of inaction was ended. Captain Charles
Douglas, H.M.S. Syren, who was cruising off Cape Race, received
information that a squadron of four French ships of the line,
having some 1500 picked troops on board, had made a descent on
Newfoundland, and had captured St. John's, the capital, which had
been most shamefully neglected, and its garrison reduced to 63 men.
The Grammont, 22-gun sloop, was unfortunately in harbour at the
time, and was also taken. Douglas at once pressed two English
merchant vessels into the service, and putting a petty officer in
command of one, the William, and his Master in the other, the
Bonetta, despatched them to cruise in search of Captain Graves, the
reappointed Governor of Newfoundland, who was daily expected from
England. The Bonetta soon fell in with the Antelope, Graves's ship,
and she immediately joined Douglas, and then proceeded to
strengthen the Isle of Boys as far as time would allow. Then going
to Placentia, a place of as much importance as St. John's, and more
capable of defence, they set about making preparations to beat off
any attack, leaving a garrison of 99 men and as many marines as
could be spared. Graves then despatched Douglas with the remainder
of the Syren's marines to take possession of Ferryland, and sent
the ship herself off with letters to Lord Colville, but the William
having missed the Antelope, made her way to Halifax with the news
of what had occurred.</p>

<p><b>RECAPTURE OF ST. JOHN'S.</b>
</p>

<p>Colville at once sent word to General Amherst,
Commander-in-Chief in America, asking him to forward any troops he
could spare, and started, accompanied by the Gosport, and an armed
colonial vessel, the King George, 20 guns, to cruise off the
Newfoundland coast in order to prevent the arrival of French
reinforcements or supplies. He met Graves at Placentia on 14th
August, and landed all the marines he could, and then continued his
cruise. Amherst collected every available man from New York,
Halifax, and Louisberg, and putting them under the command of his
brother, Colonel William Amherst, ordered him to use every despatch
and join Lord Colville without delay. This the Colonel succeeded in
doing on 12th September off Cape Spear, and the next day they
landed at Torbay, some three leagues north of St. John's. They
drove in the French outposts and took possession of a small harbour
named Quidi Vidi, which had been blocked at the entrance by the
French. Clearing away the obstructions they landed their stores and
some artillery, and advancing on St. John's, compelled its
surrender on the 17th. Notwithstanding that, as Captain Graves
reported, "the French had put St. John's in a better state of
defence than ever we had it in."</p>

<p>On the 16th a strong gale blew the English ship some distance
off the coast, and was followed by a thick fog, during which the
French squadron managed to tow out of the harbour, but were in such
a hurry to get away that they did not stop to pick up their boats
and immediately made sail, being so far out of reach in the
morning, that though some of them were seen by the British, it was
not realised that they could be the French escaping from a squadron
inferior in strength. Lord Colville, writing to the Admiralty,
says:</p>

<p>"At six next morning it being calm with a great swell, we saw
from the masthead, but could not bring them down no lower than
halfway to topmast shrouds, four sail bearing South-South-East,
distance 7 leagues. We lost sight about seven, though very clear,
and sometime after a small breeze springing up from the South-West
quarter, I stood towards Torbay in order to cover the shallops that
might be going from thence to Kitty Vitty. In the afternoon I
received a note from Colonel Amherst, acquainting me that the
French fleet got out last night. Thus after being blocked up in St.
John's Harbour for three weeks by a squadron of equal number, but
smaller ships with fewer guns and men, M. de Ternay made his escape
in the night by a shameful flight. I beg leave to observe that not
a man in the squadron imagined the four sail, when we saw them,
were the enemy; and the pilots were of opinion that they must have
had the wind much stronger than with us to overcome the easterly
swell in the harbour's mouth. I sent the King George as far as
Trepassy, to bring me intelligence if the enemy should steer
towards Placentia; and I directed Captain Douglas of the Syren to
get the transports moved from Torbay, a very unsafe road, to the
Bay of Bulls."</p>

<p>As soon as information was received in England that an
expedition had been sent from France, the Admiralty despatched a
squadron under Captain Pallisser in pursuit, and as it arrived in
St. John's only four days after M. de Ternay left, they must have
been very close to a meeting.</p>

<p><b>COOK MEETS COOK.</b>
</p>

<p>Whilst the movements leading up to the recapture of St. John's
were being carried on, communication between Colville and Amherst
was kept up by the boats of the fleet under the charge of the third
lieutenant of H.M.S. Gosport, Mr. James Cook, formerly Master of
H.M.S. Mercury, who performed this duty to the complete
satisfaction of Lord Colville as signified in his despatches to the
Admiralty. It is certain, therefore, that the two namesakes must
have come face to face here, and most probably previously in
Halifax Harbour.</p>

<p>Entering St. John's Harbour on 19th September, the flagship
remained till 7th October, during which time Cook was very busily
employed in assisting to place the island in a better state of
defence. In a despatch of Lord Colville's, dated "Spithead, 25th
October 1762," he says:</p>

<p>"I have mentioned in another letter, that the fortifications on
the Island of Carbonera were entirely destroyed by the enemy.
Colonel Amherst sent thither Mr. Desbarres, an engineer, who
surveyed the island and drew a plan for fortifying it with new
works: when these are finished the Enterprise's six guns will be
ready to mount on them. But I believe nothing will be undertaken
this year, as the season is so far advanced, and no kind of
materials on the spot for building barracks or sheds for covering
the men, should any be sent there. Mr. Cook, Master of the
Northumberland, accompanied Mr. Desbarres. He has made a draught of
Harbour Grace and the Bay of Carbonera, both of which are in a
great measure commanded by the Island, which lies off a point of
land between them. Hitherto we have had a very imperfect knowledge
of these places, but Mr. Cook, who was particularly careful in
sounding them, has discovered that ships of any size may lie in
safety both in Harbour Grace and the Bay of Carbonera."</p>

<p>Mr. Desbarres's design for the fortification of Carbonera, drawn
by John Chamberlain, dated 7th April 1763, is to be found in the
British Museum; he was afterwards Governor of Cape Breton.</p>

<p>On the return of the Northumberland to Spithead, where she
arrived on 24th October, her Master, James Cook, was discharged,
the Muster Roll merely noting "superseded" on 11th November, and
the pay sheet records the deductions from his wages as: "Chest,
&pound;2 1s. 0d.; Hospital, &pound;1 0s. 6d. Threepence in the
pound, &pound;3 14s. 9d.," leaving a balance due of &pound;291 19s.
3d. He also received from Lord Colville for the Secretary to the
Admiralty the following letter which shows the estimation he was
held in by his immediate superiors, and would doubtless be of
weight when the appointment of a man to execute greater
undertakings came under the consideration of their Lordships.</p>

<blockquote>London, 30th December 1762.<br>
<br>
Sir,<br>
<br>
Mr. Cook, late Master of the Northumberland, acquaints me that he
has laid before their Lordships all his draughts and observations
relating to the River St. Lawrence, part of the coast of Nova
Scotia, and of Newfoundland.<br>
<br>
On this occasion I beg to inform their Lordships that from my
experience of Mr. Cook's genius and capacity, I think him well
qualified for the work he has performed and for greater
undertakings of the same kind. These draughts being made under my
own eye, I can venture to say they may be the means of directing
many in the right way, but cannot mislead any.<br>
<br>
I am, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,<br>
<br>
Colville.</blockquote>

<p><b>MARRIAGE.</b>
</p>

<p>Before the close of the year Cook took upon himself further
responsibilities as set forth in the following extract from the
register of St. Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex:</p>

<p>"James Cook of ye Parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, in ye County of
Middlesex, Bachelor, and Elizabeth Batts, of ye parish of Barking
in ye County of Essex, Spinster, were married in this Church by ye
Archbishop of Canterbury's Licence, this 21st day of December, one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-two, by George Downing, Vicar of
Little Wakering, Essex."</p>

<p>Besant, who obtained his information from Mrs. Cook's second
cousin, the late Canon Bennett, who as a boy knew her well, speaks
most highly of her mental qualities and personal appearance, and
says the union appears to have been a very happy one. It covered a
period of about sixteen years; but taking into consideration the
times he was away on duty, sometimes for long periods, Cook's home
life in reality only extended to a little more than four years, and
Mrs. Cook must often have been months, sometimes years, without
even hearing of the existence of her husband. Her family were
fairly well-to-do; her grandfather, Mr. Charles Smith, was a
currier in Bermondsey; her cousin, also Charles Smith, was a
clockmaker of repute in Bunhill Row. Her mother, Mary Smith,
married first John Batts of Wapping, and secondly, John Blackburn
of Shadwell. Miss Batts is described as of Barking in the Marriage
Register, so may perhaps have been living with relations there, and
may have met Cook when on a visit to her mother in Shadwell, where
he was residing. The engagement must have been very short, for from
the time of his joining the Navy in 1755 to his return from
Newfoundland in 1762, his leave on shore had been very limited,
and, with the exception perhaps of a day or two between leaving the
Eagle and joining the Solebay, and again when leaving the latter
ship for the Pembroke, none of his time was spent in London. There
is a story that he was godfather to his wife, and at her baptism
vowed to marry her, but as at that time, 1741, Cook was assisting
his father on Airy Holme Farm, the tale is too absurd, but has for
all that been repeatedly published.</p>

<p>After their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Cook lived for a time in
Shadwell, and then removed to Mile End Old Town, where Cook
purchased a house, which was their home till after his death. This
house, which he left to his wife, has been identified as Number 88
Mile End Road, and a tablet has been placed on the front to mark
the fact.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5. 1763 TO 1767. NEWFOUNDLAND.</h2>

<p>The commission as Governor of Newfoundland, which now included
Labrador from Hudson's Straits to the St. John's River, the island
of Anticosti, the islands off the Labrador coast, and the Madelines
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, had again been conferred on Captain
(afterwards Admiral Lord) Graves. He had early recognised the fact
that it was necessary to have a thorough survey of the coasts of
his territory, and therefore made an application to the Board of
Trade to have the one commenced as far back as 1714 by Captain
Taverner, but only carried on in a desultory fashion, put in hand
and completed as quickly as possible. This application resulted in
a Representation from the Board to His Majesty, dated 29th March
1763, to be found in the Shelbourne manuscripts, asking that an
allowance should be made for the purpose.</p>

<p>Graves had seen during the previous year the work done by Cook
at Harbour Grace and Carbonera, and had evidently made up his mind
that he had found the man for his purpose, in which opinion he
would be backed up by Colville and further supported by the
favourable knowledge that the Admiralty had of his work. The
Representation was immediately acted on, for in the Records Office
is a hurried note from Graves to Mr. Stephens, Secretary to the
Admiralty, probably written on the 5th April, in which he asks:</p>

<p>"what final answer he shall give to Mr. Cook, late Master of the
Northumberland, who is very willing to go out to survey the
Harbours and Coasts of Labradore."</p>

<p>A draughtsman is also mentioned, and one is recommended who was
on the Bellona and was willing to go out, ranking as schoolmaster;
he did join Cook after a time. On 6th April Graves again wrote to
Stephens, telling him he had instructed Cook to get ready to start
as soon as the Board gave him orders, and that he was to have ten
shillings per diem whilst employed on that service. He also says
that Cook had been to the Tower to try to secure a draughtsman, and
towards the end of the letter applies for the instruments necessary
to carry on the operations. Graves was hurriedly called away to his
ship, the Antelope, as the spirit of discontent, then very rife in
the Navy, was developing itself in a very threatening manner during
his absence. However, on his arrival on board, by judicious
reforms, which he saw were carried out, and by quietly replacing
some few of the most dangerous of the malcontents, he was very
shortly able to report himself ready for sea with a complete and
fairly contented crew.</p>

<p>On 15th April he writes to Stephens asking if there was "any
change of resolution taken about Mr. Cook, the Master, and an
assistant for him, and whether they are to go out with me?" On the
18th he writes again, saying that when in London he had been
informed that he was to receive orders to purchase two small
vessels of about 60 tons each when he arrived in Newfoundland, one
of which he was "to send with Mr. Cook upon the surveys of the
coast and harbours," but he was afraid the orders had been
forgotten, and he again makes suggestions as to instruments, etc.,
required for the work. Cook had at the same time made application
in proper form for the articles he would require, and was informed
that some would be supplied to him from the Government Stores, and
for the remainder, he was to purchase them and transmit the bills
to their Lordships.</p>

<p><b>COOK'S SAILING ORDERS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 19th April Cook received his orders as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sir,<br>
<br>
My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, having directed Captain
Graves, of His Majesty's Ship, the Antelope, at Portsmouth, to
receive you on board and carry you to Newfoundland in order to your
taking a Survey of Part of the Coast and Harbours of that Island. I
am commanded by their Lordships to acquaint you therewith: that you
must repair immediately on board the said ship, she being under
sailing orders, that you are to follow such orders as you shall
receive from Captain Graves relative to the said service and that
you will be allowed ten shillings a day during the time you are
employed therein.<br>
<br>
I am, etc. etc., PHILLIP STEPHENS.<br>
<br>
Mr. James Cook, &mdash;&mdash; Town.<br>
<br>
Mr. William Test, Tower, to be paid 6 shillings per
day.</blockquote>

<p>On 8th May Graves acknowledged the receipt of the orders he had
asked for, authorising him to purchase two small vessels, and
announced that Mr. Cook had joined the ship, but that the
assistant, Mr. Test, had not been heard of; he therefore proposed
that he should endeavour to obtain someone else to fill the
vacancy. Mr. Stephens replied that a difficulty had arisen with the
Board of Ordnance with regard to Mr. Test's pay; they were not
inclined to continue it during his absence as they would have to
put some one else in his place, and since hearing this, as the
Admiralty had heard nothing further from Mr. Test, Captain Graves
was authorised to fill the vacancy at a suitable allowance, and he
at once secured the services of Mr. Edward Smart, who sailed from
Plymouth in H.M.S. Spy, and joined Cook in Newfoundland.</p>

<p>In this letter Graves also says that he intends to start Cook on
the survey of St. Pierre and Miquelon as they had to be handed over
to the French under treaty, whilst he should make some stay upon
the coast in order to afford proper time for survey before they had
to be surrendered. The possession of these islands carried with it
certain fishing and curing rights conferred by the Treaty of
Utrecht and confirmed by that of Paris, and the possession of the
islands and rights have been a continual cause of irritation to the
fishermen of both nations till lately, but now the differences have
been satisfactorily settled. It is said that the Earl of Bute was
the cause of the inclusion of the clause concerning these islands
in the Treaty, and that he received the sum of &pound;300,000 for
permitting it to stand. It was specially stipulated that the
islands were not to be fortified, and the number of the garrison
was to be strictly limited to a number sufficient for police duty
alone; but from the very commencement of the peace, it was one
continual struggle to evade the terms by one side, and to enforce
them by the other, without coming to an actual rupture.</p>

<p><b>JUDICIOUS PROCRASTINATION.</b>
</p>

<p>According to his expressed intention, Captain Graves, on
arriving at St. John's, despatched Captain Charles Douglas in the
Tweed to superintend the removal of the British settlers from the
two islands, and Cook accompanied him with orders to press on the
survey as rapidly as possible in order that it might be completed
before the arrival of the French. Unfortunately, M. d'Anjac, who
was charged with the duty of receiving the islands on behalf of the
French king, arrived on the same day as the Tweed, off the islands.
Captain Douglas refused to permit the French to land until the
islands had been formally handed over by his superior officer, and
by a little judicious procrastination in communicating with Captain
Graves, and persistent energy on the part of Cook in conducting the
survey, sufficient time was gained to complete it. Graves writes to
the Admiralty on 20th October 1763:</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the survey went on with all possible application on
the part of Mr. Cook. At length, Monsieur d'Anjac's patience being
quite exhausted, I received a letter from him on the 30th of June,
of which I enclose a copy together with my answer returned the same
day. This conveyance brought me a letter from Captain Douglas,
expressing his uneasiness on the part of Monsieur d'Anjac and
pressing to receive his final instructions, and at the same time
gave me the satisfaction to learn St. Peter's was completely
surveyed, Miquelon begun upon and advanced so as to expect it would
be finished before the French could be put in possession: so that
any interruption from them was no longer to be apprehended."</p>

<p>In a paper amongst the Shelbourne manuscripts, said to be an
extract from a Journal of Cook's, there is a short description of
these islands, and it conveys the impression that the writer looked
upon them as absolutely worthless as either naval or military
stations, but for all that Captain Graves's successor, Pallisser,
was kept continually on the alert to defeat the efforts of the
French to strengthen their position.</p>

<p><b>THE KING'S SURVEYOR.</b>
</p>

<p>After the official surrender of these islands, Cook was engaged
in surveying different places which the Admiralty had specially
marked out, and was borne on the books of either the Antelope or
Tweed as might be convenient. He is to be found on the latter ship,
entered "for victuals only," as "Mr. James Cook, Engineer, and
Retinue." As the dates in the two ships often run over each other
it is somewhat difficult to place him, but he was certainly in the
neighbourhood of St. John's for some two months, and on 5th
November he was discharged from the Antelope into the Tweed,
together with Mr. Smart, for the passage to England, where he
remained till the spring of the following year. On 4th January the
Admiralty authorised the payment up to the end of the previous year
of the allowances of 10 shillings and 6 shillings per day,
respectively, to Mr. Cook and Mr. Smart. This allowance of 10
shillings per day was the same as that made to the Commander of a
Squadron, so, from a financial point of view, Cook's position must
be considered one of importance. It was apparently superior to that
of a Master surveying under the directions of the Governor, for in
a report that Captain Pallisser, when Governor of Newfoundland,
gives of an interview between the French Ambassador and himself in
London in 1767, on the subject of the fisheries, he says he
produced Cook's chart, and decided the question of the rights of
France to the use of Belle Isle for fishing purposes against the
Ambassador by its means, and he speaks of Cook officially as the
King's Surveyor.</p>

<p>Pallisser was appointed to succeed Graves as Governor in 1764,
and at once set aside the schooner Grenville, which Graves had used
as a despatch boat for the sole use of the survey party. She had
been manned from the ships on the station, but Pallisser wrote to
the Admiralty on the subject, and the Navy Board were instructed to
establish her with a proper person to take command of her, and a
complement of men sufficient to navigate her to England when the
surveying season was over, in order that she might be refitted and
sent out early in the spring, instead of being laid up in St.
John's and waiting for stores from England, "whereby a great deal
of time is lost." The establishment was to consist of ten men, i.e.
a Master, a Master's mate, one Master's servant, and seven men. The
Master and mate were to receive the pay of a sixth rate, and the
former was "to be charged with the provisions and stores which
shall be supplied to the schooner from time to time, and to pass
regular accounts for the same." On 2nd May Stephens wrote to
Pallisser that Cook was appointed Master of the Grenville, and as
soon as the season was over he was to be ordered to Portsmouth, and
on arrival to transmit his Charts and Draughts to the Admiralty. On
receipt of this letter Pallisser wrote to Cook, and this
communication, together with autograph copies of letters written by
Cook having reference to the Grenville, a receipt for her husband's
pay, signed by Mrs. Cook, and some other papers of interest
relating to his voyages, are now in the hands of Mr. Alexander
Turnbull, of Wellington, New Zealand.</p>

<p>It would appear that it was at this time that the friendship
between Pallisser and Cook really commenced, for previously there
can have been no opportunity for the former to have known anything
of Cook's personality. A Captain of a man-of-war saw nothing of a
Master's mate, and knew nothing of him except whether he did his
duty or not, and that only through the Master's report. In this
particular case, as soon as his attention was called to him by
outside influence, Cook was withdrawn from his knowledge, and when
they again came in contact had already made his mark. Had they been
on the very friendly terms that Kippis suggests, it is unlikely
that he would have made so many incorrect statements as to Cook's
early career in the Navy.</p>

<p>On 23rd April Cook received his orders, and was told at the same
time that as he had expressed a doubt about being able to get
suitable men in Portsmouth, he would be provided with conduct money
and free carriage of chests and bedding for those he could raise in
London, and they should be transferred to Portsmouth in the Trent.
Mr. William Parker was appointed Master's mate, and the whole crew
left Portsmouth on 7th May in H.M.S. Lark, arriving in St. John's
on the 14th June. They took possession of their ship on the same
day, and the first entry in the Grenville's log runs as
follows:</p>

<p>"June 14th, 1764, St. John's, Newfoundland. The first and middle
parts moderate and hazy Weather, the Later foggy. At 1 P.M. His
Majesty's Ship the Lark anchored here from England, on board of
which came the Master and the company of this Schooner. Went on
board and took possession of Her. Read over to the crew the
Master's Warrant, Articles of War, and Abstract of the late Act of
Parliament."</p>

<p><b>ACCIDENT TO HAND.</b>
</p>

<p>After getting the guns and stores on board, and fitting the ship
for her new duties, they left St. John's on 4th July for the north.
A base line was laid out at Noddy's Harbour, and the latitude of
Cape Norman was found to be 51 degrees 39 minutes North; soundings
were taken every mile. On 3rd August Cook left the ship in the
cutter to continue his work, but having met with a nasty accident
he had to return on the 6th. It seems he had a large powder horn in
his hand, when, by some means not stated, the powder ignited, and
the horn "was blown up and burst in his hand, which shattered it in
a terrible manner, and one of the people which was hard by suffered
greatly by the same accident." The Grenville left at once for
Noddy's Harbour, where there was a French ship which had a doctor
on board, arriving there at eleven o'clock, was able to secure some
sort of medical assistance, though probably in the eye of a modern
medical man, of a very rough nature. At that time surgery,
especially on board ship, was very heroic; a glass of spirits the
only anodyne, and boiling pitch the most reliable styptic.</p>

<p>In reference to this accident the Lords of the Admiralty wrote
to Lord Halifax, quoting a letter they had received from Captain
Pallisser, dated 14th November 1764:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cook, the surveyor, has returned. The accident to him was
not so bad as it was represented. Nor had it interrupted his survey
so much as he (Captain Pallisser) expected. He continued on the
coast as long as the season would permit, and has executed his
survey in a manner which, he has no doubt, will be satisfactory to
their Lordships. I have ordered him to proceed to Woolwich to refit
his vessel for the next season, and to lay before the Board,
Draughts of his surveys with all his remarks and observations that
may be useful to Trade and Navigation in those parts."</p>

<p>Pallisser did not see Cook till some time after the accident,
when the worst was over, and it is quite in keeping with Cook's
character to minimise his sufferings, and to insist on the work
being kept going as far as possible. The surgeon, Mr. Samwell,
relates that after the murder at Owhyee they were enabled to
identify his hand by the scar which he describes as "dividing the
thumb from the fingers the whole length of the metacarpal bones."
Whilst Cook was laid up with his hand, and Mr. Parker was engaged
with the survey, some of the men were employed brewing, and either
the brew was stronger than usual or, the officer's eye being off
them, they indulged too freely, for on 20th August it is noted that
three men were confined to the deck for drunkenness and mutinous
conduct, and the next day the ringleader was punished by being made
to "run the Gantelope."</p>

<p>Early in September, being then in the Bay of St. Genevieve, Cook
went ashore for six days and ran roughly the course of several
small rivers, noting the chief landmarks, and then on their way
back to St. John's, off Point Ferrol, their small boat was dashed
to pieces on a ledge of rock, and its occupants were saved with
great difficulty by the cutter which by great good fortune happened
to be near at the time. They returned to England for the winter,
and crossing the Banks, a series of soundings were made and the
nature of the bottom carefully noted.</p>

<p>When Cook arrived at Woolwich, he pointed out to their Lordships
that the completion of his charts would entail his being absent
from his ship, and he would be unable to supervise everything that
had to be done on board, he therefore suggested that she should be
sent to Deptford yard. This was at once agreed to, and Cook was
able to devote his whole time to his charts. His own work had to be
supplemented by the observations made by six men-of-war stationed
in Newfoundland waters as their commanding officers had received
special instructions to take ample soundings and careful
observations, and to make charts which were to be sent to Captain
Pallisser, who was informed that he would be held responsible if
these orders were not carried out in their entirety. It is very
certain that an order so emphatically enforced on his notice would
not be permitted to remain a dead letter.</p>

<p><b>GRENVILLE'S RIG CHANGED.</b>
</p>

<p>Whilst at Deptford, the rig of the Grenville was altered from
schooner to brig, as Cook thought that her sailing qualities would
be improved by the change, and she also received a thorough
overhaul. In the previous year her armament had been supplied from
the flagship, and of course had to be returned, so now she was
established with "6 swivel guns, 12 Musquets, and powder and shot"
of her own, and her crew was augmented to twenty, including a
midshipman and a carpenter's mate, paid as on board a sixth rate.
Isaac Smith, Mrs. Cook's cousin, afterwards Admiral, who lived with
her at Clapham, was the midshipman. On 25th March 1765 the
Grenville again left for Newfoundland, arriving at St. Lawrence
Harbour on 2nd June to recommence her work. On 14th July, whilst
"moored in a bay by Great Garnish, we picked up two men who had
been lost in the woods for near a month. They came from Barin,
intending to go to St. Lawrence Harbour, and were almost perishing
for want of subsistence." Going into Long Harbour, 23rd July, the
Grenville ran on a rock and remained so fast that she had to be
unloaded before she could be floated off the next day, when she was
found to have suffered considerable damage to her forefoot.</p>

<p>From the log of the Grenville it appears that the survey was not
carried out continuously, and this may be accounted for by the fact
that the Governor was being called upon to settle disputes with the
French fishermen, who were only too apt to place the broadest
construction on the treaty rights accorded to them. It is very
possible that Cook, during this year, rendered assistance to
Captains Debbieg and Bassett, engineers, who were engaged in
surveying important points and harbours with a view to
fortification, and Pallisser had been instructed to give them every
help. There is no positive record that Cook did assist, but his
ship was several times engaged near where they were at work, and it
seems very reasonable to suppose that he worked with them,
especially as such work might be very important to both
parties.</p>

<p>Cook returned to Spithead on 30th November, and from thence to
Deptford for the winter, and in February obtained permission from
the Admiralty to publish the charts he had completed; Captain
Pallisser, who made the application, said he was of opinion that
they "would be of great encouragement to new adventurers on the
fisheries upon those coasts."</p>

<p><b>ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.</b>
</p>

<p>He again left Deptford on 20th April 1766, and arrived at Bon
Bon Bay, 1st June, to survey the south-west and south coasts. At
the Burgeo Islands, near Cape Ray, which were reached on 24th July,
Cook was able to take an observation of an eclipse of the sun
occurring on 5th August. On his return to England at the end of the
year, he handed the results of his observations to Dr. Bevis, a
prominent Fellow of the Royal Society, who communicated them to
that body on 30th April 1767, and the account is to be found in the
Philosophical Transactions of that year. Dr. Bevis describes Cook
as "a good mathematician, and very expert at his business," and
says he was supplied with very good instruments; that there were
three observers "with good telescopes, who all agreed as to the
moment of beginning and ending"; that he had shown Cook's results
to Mr. George Mitchell, who had calculated therefrom the difference
of longitude between the Burgeo Islands and Oxford, where another
good observation had been taken.</p>

<p>Cook makes no reference to the eclipse in the log of the
Grenville, but it appears that he was peculiarly lucky in the
weather, for the five days preceding are described as "foggy," and
the four or five succeeding are "raining with squalls." This
observation was a most fortunate one for Cook, as it brought him to
the favourable notice of the Royal Society, a body of eminent men,
outside his own profession, which was able, soon after, to advance
his interests, and in course of time to admit him into its own
ranks as an ornament of which it is still proud.</p>

<p>On 4th November the Grenville left St. John's for winter
quarters at Deptford, and the log ends on 24th November, "Dungeness
light North-East by East 2 miles." Mr. Parker, his assistant, was
promoted to a lieutenancy, and Mr. Michael Lane, who was mentioned
for the post by Captain Graves in 1763, and who was now
schoolmaster on the Guernsey, was appointed in his place.</p>

<p>On 5th April 1767 the Grenville had completed her refit, warped
out of dock, and was at anchor waiting for the tide to turn in
order to drop down to Woolwich, when the Three Sisters, a
Sunderland collier, Thomas Boyd, Master, "fell athwart her hawse
and carried away her bowsprit, cap, and jibboom," which had to be
replaced. The story is that this accident happened to the
Endeavour, and that Mr. Cook, who was naturally very indignant,
sent for the offending Master of the collier to give him a sound
rating for running foul of one of His Majesty's ships; but when he
found himself face to face with an old schoolfellow of the Ayton
days, he took him down into his cabin, treated him to the best he
had on board, and spent a good time with him talking over the old
days when they were boys together. From Cook's character the story
may well be true, excepting it has been applied to the wrong
ship.</p>

<p>When the repairs were executed the Grenville sailed for
Newfoundland, arriving off Cape Race on 9th May, and Cook at once
set to work on the survey of the west coast. He landed in September
at the mouth of the Humber, and made a rapid examination of that
river, discovering several lakes, and getting a good general idea
of that part of the island. He returned to St. John's for the last
time on 14th October, having practically completed the survey of
the general run of the coast, and added very considerably to the
knowledge of some of the interior parts of the island. In 1762 a
map was published, compiled from the very latest information, and
on it is the note: "The inland parts of this island are entirely
unknown." Cook is said to have discovered valuable seams of coal,
but there is no note of anything of the kind amongst his
records.</p>

<p><b>THE GRENVILLE ASHORE.</b>
</p>

<p>He sailed for England on 23rd October, and anchored off the Nore
in very heavy weather on 11th November. It was soon found that the
anchors would not hold, and at length one parted and the ship
"trailed into shallow water, striking hard." After a while she
again struck heavily, and "lay down on her larboard bilge." As
there seemed no prospect of the gale moderating, everything was
made as snug as time would allow, and, putting his crew into the
boats, Cook made for Sheerness. The weather at length improved, so
obtaining assistance he returned and found that fortunately his
ship had sustained very little damage, and the next day he
successfully floated her, and got her up to Deptford yards on the
following Sunday, and then Cook was able to set to work on his
charts. On 3rd February, Pallisser wrote to Mr. Stephens asking him
to obtain permission from the Lords to publish, and at once
obtained the necessary authority.</p>

<p>Some of these charts had been published in 1766, and now the
complete series appeared with sailing directions for the south and
east coasts of the islands. Admiral Sir W.J.L. Wharton, the late
hydrographer to the Admiralty, says:</p>

<p>"The Charts he made during these years in the schooner Grenville
were admirable. The best proof of their excellence is that they are
not yet wholly superseded by the more detailed surveys of modern
times. Like all first surveys of a practically unknown shore, and
especially when that shore abounds in rocks and shoals, and is much
indented with bays and creeks, they are imperfect in the sense of
having many omissions; but when the amount of the ground covered,
and the impediments of fogs and bad weather on that coast is
considered, and that Cook had at the most only one assistant, their
accuracy is truly astonishing."</p>

<p>On the publication of his charts, Cook's connection with
Newfoundland was concluded, and on 12th April 1768 Mr. Lane was
"appointed to act as Master of the brig Grenville, and surveyor of
the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador in the absence of Mr. Cook,
who is to be employed elsewhere." Mr. Lane was to be paid an
allowance of five shillings per day over and above his pay as
Master of a sixth rate. Cook and he were paid their allowances up
to 31st December 1767, and on 17th June the Navy Board were ordered
to complete Cook's allowance up to 12th April. From the wording of
Mr. Lane's appointment it would appear that the surveyor's position
was to be left open for Cook if it was thought desirable for him to
resume it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6. 1768. PREPARATIONS FOR FIRST VOYAGE.</h2>

<p>Till a few years ago writers on the subject were content to draw
their information as to the first voyage of Cook to the South Seas
from the so-called history of Dr. Hawkesworth. This gentleman, who
posed as a stylist (Boswell calls him a "studious imitator of Dr.
Johnson"), was introduced by Dr. Charles Burney to Lord Sandwich
for the express purpose of writing an account of the expedition,
and was supplied with all the records in the possession of the
Admiralty relating to it, he had access to the Journal of Sir
Joseph Banks, the Notes of Dr. Solander and others who accompanied
Cook, and, more than all, he had the opportunity of personal
communication with the leaders of the party. Notwithstanding these
advantages he interpolated so much of his own speculations,
conclusions, and dissertations, as to render his voluminous work
not only extremely unreliable but often extremely ridiculous.
Travellers to the South Seas record that the accounts of things and
places described as seen by Cook are remarkably correct, but that
the inferences drawn are wrong. They do not realise that the
statements of fact are Cook's, whilst the deductions and
ornamentations are Hawkesworth's, and were strongly resented by
Cook. Boswell relates that he told Johnson that he had met Captain
Cook at dinner at Sir John Pringle's (then President of the Royal
Society), and gave him an account of a conversation they had
together. Johnson:</p>

<p>"was much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that
celebrated circumnavigator, who set me right as to many of the
exaggerated accounts given by Dr. Hawkesworth of his voyages."</p>

<p>Cook's opinion on the subject may be seen from his determination
to prepare his Journals for the press himself in the future.</p>

<p>Within the last few years the Journal of the Endeavour has been
published under the able supervision of the late Admiral Sir W.J.L.
Wharton, and the Journal of Sir Joseph Banks, which was missing for
a long time, has been recovered and published by Sir Joseph Hooker;
and these two books may be preferred with safety over all others
that have been written on the subject.</p>

<p><b>MEMORIAL TO THE KING.</b>
</p>

<p>It had been calculated that a Transit of Venus would occur in
1769, observations of which would be of great importance to
astronomical science, and several of the European nations, notably
Russia, were intending to establish points of observation. The
Royal Society decided that as England had hitherto taken a lead in
astronomy, she should not now fall behind, and appointed a
committee to report on the places where it would be desirable to
take observations, the methods to be pursued, and the persons best
fitted to carry out the work. This committee advised that two
observers should be sent to Hudson's Bay, two to the South Pacific
and, if Sweden did not send there, two to the North Cape. They also
advised that the Government should be asked to supply a ship to
convey the party to some island to be decided on in the South Seas,
and several gentlemen were suggested as observers, Mr. Maskelyne,
President of the Society, especially recommending Mr. Dalrymple as
"a proper person to send to the South Seas, having a particular
turn for discoveries, and being an able navigator and well skilled
in observation." Mr. Maskelyne estimated the voyage would take
about two years, and that a sum of ten shillings and six pence per
day would be a reasonable allowance for expenses, together with a
gratuity the amount of which was to be settled hereafter. A
Memorial on the subject was prepared and forwarded to the King,
setting forth that as a Transit of Venus over the Sun's disc was
expected to occur, and that other nations were intending to take
observations thereof in the interests of navigation, it would be
desirable that as the British Nation had been justly celebrated for
its knowledge of Astronomy, and an Englishman, Mr. Jeremiah Horrox,
had been the first person who calculated the passage of the planet
over the sun, in 1639, the Government should support the Royal
Society in its attempt to take a proper position in the matter, by
a grant of money and a ship to take a party to the South Seas. Four
thousand pounds was the sum named, and on 24th March the President
was able to inform the Council that the King had been pleased to
order that it should be placed in his hands, "clear of fees," for
the purpose of defraying the expenses of the expedition. In the
end, after paying all accounts, there was a considerable balance
left, which the King placed at the disposal of the Society, and a
portion of it was expended on the bust of His Majesty, by
Nollekins, now in its possession.</p>

<p>The gentlemen whose names had been suggested as observers were
asked to appear before the Council if they were willing to accept
the position, and Mr. Dalrymple wrote in reply to say there was
only one part of the world where he would go to take observations,
that was the South Seas, and he would only go if he had "the
management of the ship intended for the service." Mr. Maskelyne
told the Council he had recommended Mr. Dalrymple to the Admiralty
for the command of the ship, the use of which had been granted, but
had been informed that such an appointment would be "entirely
repugnant to the regulations of the Navy." It is said that Sir
Edward Hawke, having in his mind the disastrous result of giving
Halley the command of a King's ship in 1698, when a serious mutiny
occurred, positively refused to sign such a commission, saying that
he would "rather cut off his right hand than permit any one but a
King's officer to command one of the ships of His Majesty's
Navy."</p>

<p>Dalrymple, originally a clerk in the East India Company's
service, had spent some years trading amongst the islands of the
Malay Archipelago and China, returned to England and published a
couple of pamphlets on the East Indies, and in 1767 a book on the
discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, which brought him to the
notice of the Royal Society. He was afterwards for a time
hydrographer to the East India Company, and was then appointed the
first hydrographer to the Admiralty. He was dismissed from this
position for exceeding his powers, and soon afterwards died. He
appears to have been a clever man, but of an extremely overbearing
disposition and a very high opinion of himself. In writing to Dr.
Hawkesworth on one occasion, he said: "I never write on any subject
I do not thoroughly understand." What makes the remark more
interesting is that he was quite in the wrong on the subject under
discussion. He appears never to have forgiven Cook for having been
successful in obtaining the command of the expedition to observe
the Transit of Venus, and for completely upsetting his pet theory
of a large continent in the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p><b>PURCHASE OF THE ENDEAVOUR.</b>
</p>

<p>The Navy Board, having been ordered by the Admiralty to propose
a proper vessel to convey the observers to the South Seas, first
suggested the Tryal Sloop, and then the Rose, but both being found
unsuitable they were ordered to purchase one. On 29th March the
Board wrote to Stephens that they had bought:</p>

<p>"a cat-built Bark, in Burthen 368 Tuns and of the age of three
years and nine months, for conveying such persons as shall be
thought proper to the Southward..."</p>

<p>At the same time, instructions were sought as to fitting and
arming her for the service, and as to the name under with she was
to be registered on the list of the Navy. A cat-built ship is
described in the Encyclopaedias as one with round bluff bows, a
wide deep waist, and tapering towards the stern. The name is
derived from the Norwegian kati, a ship.</p>

<p>The cat-built bark, the now immortal Endeavour, was built by
Messrs. Fishburn of Whitby, and owned by Mr. William Milner of that
port. Dr. Young says that her original name was the Earl of
Pembroke, but Sir Evan Macgregor wrote to Mr. Waddington in 1888
that she was purchased "under the name of the Endeavour, and was
entered as a barque." The Warrant Entry Book from Board of Trade
proves that Dr. Young was right, as the following entries will
show:</p>

<p>"Deptford, March 23rd 1768. Two cats called the Valentine and
the Earl of Pembroke to be surveyed and report which is the
properest to be purchased."</p>

<p>"Deptford, March 28th 1768. Ship Earl of Pembroke to be
received."</p>

<p>"Deptford, April 7th 1768. Ship purchased to be sheathed,
filled, and fitted for a voyage to the southward. To be called The
Endeavour Bark."</p>

<p>From the Records of the Survey Office, List of H.M. Navy, 1771
to 1776, it has been ascertained that her price was &pound;2,800,
and the cost of fitting her for the voyage was &pound;2,294. The
reason she was named officially either the Bark Endeavour or
Endeavour Bark, was that there was another Endeavour in the Navy,
stationed at that time at the Nore. Kippis says that Pallisser was
entrusted with the selection of the ship, and that he called on
Cook for assistance in the matter, and the fact that a Whitby-built
ship was chosen, of a kind in which Cook had had considerable
experience, adds to the probability of his statement. Dalrymple
enters a claim, in letters to Dr. Hawkesworth, to having chosen the
Endeavour for the voyage, but as she was not ordered to be
surveyed, with a view to purchase, till 23rd March, when it was
well-known the Admiralty had refused to allow him the command of
the expedition, there is little force in his claim.</p>

<p><b>COPPER SHEATHING.</b>
</p>

<p>Admiral Wharton assumes that as Cook expresses himself averse
from having exploring ships sheathed in copper, owing to the
difficulty of making repairs in case of accident far from proper
facilities, and from the frequent mention of "heeling and
boot-topping" in the Journal of the Endeavour, it is most probable
that she was sheathed in wood. This assumption is correct, for
there is no mention of copper sheathing in the Surveyor's books,
nor at the time of her being repaired at the Endeavour River, nor
at Batavia, when it is impossible that any account of her damaged
bottom could be given without the mention of copper if any such
sheathing had been used. The Naval Chronicle says the first ship of
the Royal Navy to be sheathed with copper was the Alarm frigate in
1758; and it is also said that the Dolphin, the ship in which
Captain Wallis sailed round the world, was the only coppered ship
in the service at this time, and she remained the only one for some
years.</p>

<p>On 5th May, at a Council Meeting of the Royal Society, Captain
John Campbell, R.N., proposed that Cook, who was in attendance, and
had been appointed by the Admiralty to the command of the
Endeavour, was a fit and proper person to be one of the observers
for the Society in the Southern Seas. Cook was called in, and
accepted the position in consideration of such a gratuity as the
Society should think proper, and an allowance of &pound;120 per
year "for victualling himself and another observer in every
particular." Mr. Green was also called in, and accepted the place
as the other observer for the gratuity of 200 guineas for the two
years the voyage was expected to take, and at the rate of 100
guineas a year afterwards. A list of the instruments to be supplied
by the Society was also prepared at the same meeting, and the
workmen engaged on them were ordered to show them to Messrs. Green
and Cook, and give any desired information. A portable observatory,
said to have been designed by Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone
Lighthouse, framed of wood and covered with canvas, was also
prepared. Mr. Maskelyne, knowing the value of a good watch when
observing for longitude, lent the Society one of his own, made by
Graham, to be entrusted to Mr. Green, and it was signed for with
the other instruments supplied. Chronometers, of course, at that
time were in process of evolution, several makers were endeavouring
to gain the prize which had been offered for a reliable timekeeper.
Shortly after, at a second meeting, Cook agreed to accept a
gratuity from the Society of 100 guineas for taking the
observations, and was paid &pound;120 sustenance money for Mr.
Green and himself, with authority to draw on the Society during the
voyage for a further amount not exceeding &pound;120.</p>

<p>In the Commissions and Warrants Book, under date 26th May 1768,
appears the following entry:</p>

<p>MR. JAMES COOK (2nd) 1st Lieutenant Endeavour Bark. E.H., C.T.,
C.S.</p>

<p>The initials signify Edward Hawke, Charles Townshend, and Lord
Charles Spencer. The "(2nd)" evidently refers to the fact that
there was already one James Cook, a lieutenant in the Navy, namely,
the former Master of the Mercury, and Third Lieutenant of the
Gosport.</p>

<p><b>PENDANT HOISTED.</b>
</p>

<p>Having received his orders Cook proceeded to Deptford and
hoisted his pendant on H.M.S. Endeavour on 27th May, and at once
started to prepare for sea. A considerable quantity of coal was
taken on board to use for drying the ship, as it occupied so much
less room than wood.</p>

<p>Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the world about
this time, and in consequence of his report, the Island of
Georgeland, afterwards called by Cook Otaheite and now Tahiti, was
fixed upon by the Royal Society as the most desirable place for the
observations, and the Admiralty were requested to issue the proper
orders, notifying at the same time that Mr. Charles Green and
Lieutenant James Cook had been appointed observers. They also in
the same letter write that:</p>

<p>"Joseph Banks, Esquire, Fellow of this Society, a Gentleman of
large fortune, who is well versed in Natural History, being
desirous of undertaking the same voyage, the council very earnestly
request their Lordships that in regard to Mr. Banks' great personal
merit and for the advancement of useful knowledge, he also,
together with his suite, being seven persons more (that is eight
persons in all) together with their baggage, be received on board
of the ship under command of Captain Cook."</p>

<p>They also requested that the expedition might be landed a month
or six weeks before the 3rd June in order that the instruments
might be got into proper working order, and for fear the ship might
not be able to reach Georgeland, a table of the limits within which
the observations might be taken, was enclosed. Full instructions
were also given to the two observers, and a list of the fixed stars
to be observed was drawn up by Mr. Maskelyne.</p>

<p>The order to receive Mr. Green and Mr. Banks and party was
issued on 22nd July, "for victuals only"&mdash;i.e., they were to
be supplied with the same as the rest of the ship's company whilst
on board. The members of Banks's party were: Dr. Solander,
naturalist; H. Sporing, assistant naturalist; A. Buchan, S.
Parkinson, and Jno. Reynolds, artists; James Roberts and Peter
Briscoe, white servants; Thomas Richmond and J. Dorlton, coloured
servants.</p>

<p>It was owing to the personal friendship between them that Banks
was permitted by Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the Admiralty, to
accompany Cook. He had taken up the study of Botany when at Eton,
and at an early age had been elected F.R.S. He seems quickly to
have formed a just estimate of Cook's worth; indeed, Sir John
Barrow says he took a liking to him at the first interview, and a
firm friendship sprang up between them which endured to the end.
Many instances are to be found of his interest in and his support
to Cook after their return home; and this friendship speaks volumes
for Cook, for, though Banks was a most kindly natured man, he had
at times a very overbearing manner.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Hooker, in his introduction, quotes a most
interesting letter from Mr. John Ellis, F.R.S., to Linnaeus, the
great botanist, in which he says that Mr. Banks, a gentleman of
&pound;6000 a year, has persuaded Dr. Solander to go out with him
to the South Seas to collect "all the natural curiosities of the
place," and after the observations are taken, they are "to proceed
on further discoveries." He goes on to mention the library of
Natural History and splendid outfit Banks is taking, and says, "in
short, Solander assured me this expedition would cost Mr. Banks
&pound;10,000."</p>

<p>The Endeavour left Deptford on 21st July, and, calling at
Galleons Reach, took in her guns and gunners' stores. Her armament
was originally to have been six carriage guns, four pounders, and
eight swivels, but they were increased to ten carriage guns and
eight swivels, and at Plymouth four more swivels were added for use
in the boats. The complement of men was also increased to 85,
including 12 marines who were to join at Plymouth, and a third
Lieutenant had been appointed in July.</p>

<p>She had dropped down the river and anchored in the Downs on 3rd
August, Cook joining her on the 7th and, discharging his pilot,
sailed the next day. He had a very tedious passage down the
Channel, and did not arrive a Plymouth till the 14th, when he
immediately sent word to Messrs. Banks and Solander, who were still
in London, that he was ready for sea, and was only waiting for a
fair wind to sail. They therefore started at once, their baggage
being already on board, and joined Cook on 20th August.</p>

<p><b>CREW WELL SATISFIED.</b>
</p>

<p>Having received his extra guns, marines, twelve barrels of
powder, and other stores, Cook mustered his men, paid them two
months advance, and explained to them that they were not to expect
any additional pay for the intended voyage. He says, "they were
well satisfied, and expressed great cheerfulness and readiness to
prosecute the voyage."</p>

<p>The orders under which he sailed were secret, and,
unfortunately, are not to be found. Admiral Wharton says the
covering letter is in existence, but the orders which should be on
the next page are missing. Cook writes:</p>

<p>"I was ordered, therefore, to proceed directly to Otaheite; and,
after the astronomical observations should be completed, to
prosecute the design of making discoveries in the South Pacific
Ocean by proceeding to the South as far as the latitude of 40
degrees: then, if I found no land, to proceed to the west between
40 and 35 degrees till I fell in with New Zealand, which I was to
explore, and thence return to England by such route as I should
think proper."</p>

<p>His last letter to the Admiralty, before leaving England, was
written on the day of his arrival at Plymouth, informing them of
that fact, and announcing his intention of proceeding to sea with
all possible despatch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7. 1768 TO 1769. PLYMOUTH TO OTAHEITE.</h2>

<p>After waiting for some days for a fair wind, Cook eventually
sailed at 2 P.M. on 26th August, having, as he says in his Journal,
"94 persons, including officers, seamen, Gentlemen and their
servants; near 18 months' provisions, 10 carriage guns, 12 swivels,
with good store of ammunition, and stores of all kinds" on board.
On 1st September they had heavy gales lasting for about
four-and-twenty hours, and a small boat belonging to the boatswain
was washed away, and "between three and four dozen of our poultry,
which was worst of all," were drowned. The ship was found to be
very leaky in her upper works, and the sails in the store got very
wet. Banks notes that they caught two birds in the rigging that had
evidently been blown off the coast of Spain. On 13th September they
anchored in Funchal Roads, and during the night "the Bend of the
Hawser of the stream anchor slip'd owing to the carelessness of the
person who made it fast." The anchor was hauled up into a boat in
the morning, and carried further out, but, unfortunately, in
heaving it into the water, a Master's mate, named Weir, got
entangled in the buoy rope, was carried overboard, and drowned
before any assistance could be rendered.</p>

<p>Whilst shifting her berth to a more convenient spot, the
Endeavour was fired on by one of the forts owing to some
misunderstanding, but satisfactory apologies and explanations were
made, and it was thought so little of that neither Cook nor Banks
mention it in their Journals. This incident is probably the origin
of the story told by Forster in his Journal of the Second Voyage.
He says:</p>

<p>"Captain Cook in the Endeavour battered the Loo Fort at Madeira
in conjunction with an English Frigate, thus resenting an affront
which had been offered to the British flag."</p>

<p>When the Endeavour arrived at Funchal, the only British
man-of-war there was H.M.S. Rose, which sailed the following day
with her convoy, and neither her Captain's Journal nor his ship's
log make any reference whatever to a dispute with the Portuguese.
No other British man-of-war came into the port whilst the Endeavour
was there, and afterwards, at Rio, Cook expressly informed the
Viceroy that he had been well received by the Portuguese at
Madeira.</p>

<p>Fresh water, meat, vegetables, and wine were taken on board;
wine, fruit, and water being good and cheap, but the meat and
poultry, obtained as a favour, were dear. Two men, a marine and a
sailor, received twelve lashes for refusing to eat their allowance
of fresh meat. This appears to be harsh treatment, but it must be
remembered that the lash was at that time almost the only
recognised method of punishment in the Navy, however trivial the
offence might be; and Cook knew from experience how important it
was to prevent the scurvy from getting foothold on board, and he
already had determined to fight, by every means in his power, this
dread scourge, almost his most dangerous foe. He did conquer it
even on this first voyage, and, considering his means, in a most
marvellous manner. He would have claimed the victory had it not
been for an untoward event, which will be told hereafter, leading
him to postpone his claim till he could give further proof. It is
important to notice how on every possible occasion he obtained,
wherever he could, some change of diet and fresh water.</p>

<p><b>EDEN BEFORE THE FALL.</b>
</p>

<p>Whilst they were at Funchal, Banks spent five days with the
English Consul, and he describes the place as very pretty, but the
people as primitive, idle, and uninformed; all their instruments of
the rudest make; and he thought that the appliances used in the
manufacture of wine must have been similar to those used by Noah,
"although it is not impossible that he might have used better if he
remembered the methods he had seen before the flood." One of the
Governors left it on record that, so averse from change were the
people, he thought it most fortunate the island was not Eden before
the fall, as in that case the inhabitants could never have been
induced to wear clothes. He explored as much of the island as he
could, but says he could never get more than three miles away from
the town as his time was so much broken up. The Governor visited
them on one of the days he says was so wasted, but relates, with
evident glee, how he took his revenge. There was an electrical
machine on board, and His Excellency was most curious on the
subject; it was sent for and explained to him, and Banks goes on,
"they gave him as many shocks as he cared for; perhaps more." A
visit was paid to a convent, where the nuns, hearing they were
distinguished scientists, plied them with all sorts of questions,
and for the half-hour the visit lasted their tongues were going
"all the time at an uncommonly nimble rate." At a monastery they
visited they were well received, and the monks, regretting they
were then unprepared, invited them to come the next day and, though
it would be Friday, they would have roast turkey for dinner.</p>

<p>On 19th September, at midnight, they weighed, sighted Teneriffe
on the 23rd, and the day following their first flying fish found
its way into Mr. Green's cabin. On the 28th they tried steaks for
dinner cut from a young shark, which Banks and Solander reported as
very good, but the crew refused to taste them. Cape de Verde was
seen on the 30th, and about a fortnight afterwards the line was
crossed in 29 degrees 24 minutes West longitude, and the following
day the event was celebrated. Lieutenant Hicks had crossed before,
so a list was given to him of all on board, including the dogs and
cats, and all were mustered on deck, those who had already crossed
being separated from the others. Any one who wished could purchase
immunity for four days' allowance of wine, but the others had to
pay the penalty of ducking. Banks compounded for himself and party,
and Cook also seems to have got off, but the others were hauled up
to the end of the main-yard on a boatswain's chair, and then at the
sound of the whistle dropped into the sea, an operation repeated
three times. Cook says the "ceremony was performed to about twenty
or thirty, to the no small diversion of the rest."</p>

<p>Whilst near the Equator, great inconvenience was felt from the
damp heat; everything was mouldy or rusty, and several of the crew
were on the sick-list with a sort of bilious complaint; but it
fortunately did not grow into a serious matter.</p>

<p><b>RECEPTION AT RIO.</b>
</p>

<p>They struck soundings on 6th November, and on heaving the lead
again found a difference of less than a foot in three or four
hours. Land was sighted near Cape Frio, Brazil, in latitude 21
degrees 16 minutes South, on the 8th, and they came across a boat
manned by eleven blacks who were engaged in catching and salting
fish. Banks purchased some fish, and was surprised to find they
preferred to be paid in English rather than Spanish coin. On the
13th they arrived off Rio de Janeiro, where they were very
ungraciously received by the Viceroy. They were not permitted to
land except under a guard; some of the men who had been sent ashore
on duty were imprisoned. Mr. Hicks, who had gone to report their
arrival and ask for the services of a pilot, was detained for a
time, and it was only with difficulty, and at an exorbitant rate,
that they obtained fresh food and water. Consequently little was
seen of the place, except from the ship, and Cook took all possible
observations from thence, and made a sketch map of the harbour, to
which he added all the information he was able to pick up from the
pilot. Writing to the Royal Society, he says he is quite unable to
understand the true reason of his treatment, and contrasts it with
that received by a Spanish ship which came in whilst he was there.
This Spanish ship willingly undertook to carry to Europe and
forward to the Admiralty copies of the correspondence that passed
between Cook and the Viceroy, which Cook describes as:</p>

<p>"a paper war between me and His Excellency, wherein I had no
other advantage than the racking his invention to find reasons for
treating us in the manner he did, for he never would relax the
least from any one point."</p>

<p>To every remonstrance the Viceroy pleaded his instructions and
the custom of the port. He seems to have been quite unable to grasp
the object of the expedition, and Cook says his idea of the transit
of Venus was, "the North Star passing through the South Pole. His
own words." The crew were accused of smuggling, and it was
repeatedly asserted that the Endeavour was not a king's ship.
Parkinson, one of Mr. Banks's staff, says that frequently some of
them let themselves down from the cabin window at midnight into a
boat, and driving with the tide till they were out of hearing of
the guard boat established over them, rowed ashore and made short
excursions into the country, "though not so far as we could have
wished to have done."</p>

<p>Banks, speaking of the supplies obtained at Rio, says the beef
was cheap but very lean and dry; the bread tasted as if made with
sawdust, and justified its name of Farinha de Pao (wooden meal);
the fruits, excepting the oranges, were very indifferent, and he
takes particular exception to the banana, which he had not tasted
before, it was not at all to his liking. The water also was very
bad, and the crew preferred what they had brought with them, though
it was very stale.</p>

<p>M. de Bougainville reports that when he visited Rio he was at
first received in a very friendly manner by this same Viceroy, but
after a time the treatment was altered, and he had to put up with
even greater insolence than Cook.</p>

<p><b>THE SECOND DEATH.</b>
</p>

<p>When the stores had been received on board, the anchor was
weighed in order to take up a more favourable position for making a
start, but, unfortunately, shortly after the ship got underway, a
man named Peter Flowers fell from the main-shrouds into the sea and
was drowned before assistance could be rendered: the second death
since leaving England. The next day the wind was contrary, but
every one was so anxious to turn their backs on the place that Cook
ordered out the boats to tow, but they were immediately brought up
by a shot from the fort of Santa Cruz. A remonstrance was sent
ashore, and received the lame excuse that the permit for leaving
had been signed but had been delayed on its way, and the officer in
command could not allow the vessel to leave till it was received.
Another attempt to get away was soon after made, but the anchor
fouled a rock, and there was again delay; at length, on the 7th
December, they were able to make a start, discharge their pilot,
and bid farewell to the guard boat which had so constantly kept
watch over them. They were informed that an Englishman, named
Foster, an officer in the Portuguese service, who had been of great
use to them, was imprisoned for his kind attentions.</p>

<p>On 9th December they met with bad weather and lost their
foretop-gallant mast, but the rough handling they got was credited
with improving the sailing qualities of the ship, as it took some
of the stiffness out of her upperworks. A meteor was noted on the
23rd, like a small bright cloud, emitting flames, travelling
rapidly westward, and disappearing slowly with two sharp
explosions. The same day an eclipse of the sun was observed.</p>

<p>Christmas Day, for which the men had been saving up their
allowances of grog, passed in the usual manner, that is, in
considerable over-indulgence. Banks speculates as to what might
have happened if they had had bad weather, whilst Cook dismisses
the occurrence very shortly: "The people none of the soberest." On
the 27th they crossed the mouth of the River Plate, the water being
very discoloured, and a good many land insects were found in it. On
2nd January 1769, they saw some of the shoals of red lobsters like
those mentioned by Dampier and Cowley, but they were not found in
such quantities as those navigators reported.</p>

<p>On the 11th the shores of Tierra del Fuego were sighted, and on
working in closer, the country was found to be less desolate in
appearance than they had expected from Anson's description.
Arriving off the entrance of the Straits of Le Maire, between
Staten Island and the mainland, they were driven back by the tide
and a strong adverse wind, and trying to shelter under Cape Diego
they were carried past, and only after three and a half days' hard
work were they able to get through the straits. Cook has left
sailing directions for this passage which are followed to the
present day. Banks and Solander were ashore for a short time on
Staten Island, and returned delighted with the addition of some
hundred new plants for their collection. Cook, with an eye to the
welfare of his crew, remarks: "They returned on board, bringing
with them several plants and flowers, etc., most of them unknown in
Europe, and in that consisted their whole value." Cook and Green
made a series of observations, "the first ever made so far south in
America," and fixed the position of Cape Diego at 66 degrees West,
54 degrees 39 South; Wharton places it at 65 degrees eight minutes
West, 54 degrees 40 minutes South.</p>

<p>On the 15th they anchored in the Bay of Success, for wood and
water, and met with some of the inhabitants, with whom, by means of
gifts of beads and other trifles, they established friendly
relations, and three of them were persuaded to go on board the
ship. Though by no means a small race of men, they were found to be
nothing like the giants reported by the early navigators in this
part of the world. They had in their possession buttons, glass,
canvas, brown cloth, etc., showing conclusively they had previously
some communication with Europeans. Their clothing consisted chiefly
of skins, roughly cured, and a plentiful covering of paint and
dirt. The only personal property on which they appeared to set any
store were their bows and arrows, which were carefully made and
always in good order. Their food appeared to consist of seal and
shell-fish; their houses, merely shelters of boughs covered with
grass and leaves built to windward of a small fire.</p>

<p><b>A SNOWSTORM.</b>
</p>

<p>On 16th January, Banks, Solander, Buchan, Green, Monkhouse, two
seamen, and Banks's two coloured servants, tried to get up the
hills to see something of the surrounding country, but they found
their progress hampered by the dwarf vegetation. To add to their
discomfort a heavy snowstorm came on. Several of the party
experienced that desire to sleep which is produced by cold, and
were warned by Solander of the danger of giving way to it, yet he
was almost the first one to give in, and was with great difficulty
kept awake. Buchan, most unfortunately, had a fit, so a large fire
was made at the first convenient spot, but a sailor and the two
coloured men lagged behind. During the night the sailor was heard
shouting, and was brought in to the fire, but in the morning the
two coloured men were found frozen to death. Cook attributed their
death to overindulgence in spirits, the supply for the party being
left in their charge. Not intending to remain away the night,
supplies ran short, so a vulture was shot and carefully divided
amongst them, each man cooking his own, which amounted to about
three mouthfuls. At length the weather cleared up and a start back
was made, and after three hours they struck the beach, only to find
they had never been any great distance away but had been describing
a circle and came back almost to the place whence they had started.
Banks notes the vegetation as more exuberant than he expected; the
dominant colour of the flowers, white; and he collected wild celery
and scurvy grass in large quantities, which was mixed with the food
on board ship as long as it could be preserved in a wholesome
condition. Whilst at the Bay of Success the guns were lowered into
the hold so as to allow more room on deck for working the ship in
the bad weather they expected to encounter when rounding the
Horn.</p>

<p><b>THE BALANCE OF THE GLOBE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 27th January Cape Horn was passed, but owing to fog and
contrary wind they did not approach very closely, so they were
unable to fix its exact position, but the description they were
able to give of its appearance (there is a sketch of it by Mr.
Pickersgill, Master's mate, in the Records Office), and twenty-four
observations taken in the immediate neighbourhood, settled any
doubts they may have had, and Cook puts it at 55 degrees 53 minutes
South, 68 degrees 13 minutes West, and Wharton gives the corrected
position as 55 degrees 58 minutes South, 67 degrees 16 minutes
West. Three days after they reached their furthest south, according
to Cook 60 degrees 4 minutes South, 74 degrees 10 West, and the
course was then altered to West by North. The continuous and
careful observations of the state of the sea, and the absence of
currents during the following month, caused Cook to come to the
conclusion that the vast southern continent so long supposed to
exist somewhere in that part of the globe, and by some people
esteemed necessary to preserve its balance, was non-existent. Banks
expresses his pleasure in having upset this theory, and observes:
"Until we know how the globe is fixed in its position, we need not
be anxious about its balance."</p>

<p>The weeks following the change of the course to the north were
uneventful, only marked by an occasional success of the naturalists
in obtaining a fresh specimen, some of which were experimented on
by the cook; an albatross, skinned, soaked all night in salt water,
was stewed, served with savoury sauce, and was preferred to salt
pork; a cuttle-fish of large size, freshly killed by the birds, and
too much damaged for classification, was made into soup, of which
Banks says: "Only this I know that, of it was made one of the best
soups I ever ate." The water obtained at Tierra del Fuego turned
out very good: a great boon, as one of their great troubles and a
source of great anxiety to Cook was the bad quality of the water so
often obtained.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March a change was noticed in the kinds of
birds flying round the ship, some being recognised as ones that
were known to stay near land, and consequently a sharp look-out was
kept. On the night of the 24th a tree-trunk was reported, but when
morning came nothing further was seen. It has since been
ascertained they were then a little to the north of Pitcairn
Island, afterwards the home of the mutineers of the Bounty; but
Cook did not feel himself at liberty to make any deviation from his
course "to look for what he was not sure to find," although he
thought he was "not far from those islands discovered by Quiros in
1606."</p>

<p>On 26th march one of the marines committed suicide by drowning.
It seems he had misappropriated a piece of sealskin, and his
fellow-soldiers, indignant that such a thing should have been done
by one of the cloth, made his life uncomfortable and threatened
that he should be reported for theft. This was the fifth death
since leaving England, and none by disease.</p>

<p>The 4th April, at 10.30 A.M., Banks's servant, Peter Briscoe,
sighted land, and the course of the ship was altered to give them a
chance of inspecting it. It was found to be one of those peculiar
circular reefs surrounding a lagoon, called atolls, which exist in
some quantity in the Pacific. There was no anchorage, so they made
no attempt to land, but were able to see it was inhabited. Some
twenty-four persons were counted through the glasses, and were
described as copper-coloured, with black hair; they followed the
ship as if prepared to oppose a landing. The reef was covered with
trees, amongst which the coconut palm was conspicuous. Cook gave it
the name of Lagoon Island; it is now known as Vahitahi, and is one
of the Low Archipelago. Being now in Wallis's track, islands were
sighted almost every day, and almost all appeared inhabited, but
owing to the want of safe anchorage, no communication could be held
with the natives.</p>

<p>On 10th April Osnaburg Island was passed, and next day King
George Land was sighted; but the wind failed, and they did not get
close in till the 12th, when canoes came out to the ship, bringing
branches of trees which were handed up the side, with signs
directing they should be placed conspicuously in the rigging, as a
token of friendship offered and accepted. When this had been done
the natives produced a good supply of trade in the shape of
vegetables and fruit; amongst the last Banks enumerates
bread-fruit, bananas, coconuts, and apples (a species of hog plum).
These were very acceptable and beneficial to the crew after such a
lapse of time without vegetable food except the wild plants
gathered in Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p><b>AT TAHITI.</b>
</p>

<p>At 7 A.M. on the 13th they anchored in the bay described by
Wallis, known as Matavai, in thirteen fathoms, and Cook says of his
route from Cape Horn, "I Endeavoured to make a direct course, and
in part succeeded."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8. 1769. SOCIETY ISLANDS.</h2>

<p><b>PRODIGIOUS EXPERT THIEVES.</b>
</p>

<p>Hardly had the anchor reached the bottom, before they were
surrounded by canoes, whose occupants were anxious to sell the
supplies of fruits, raw and cooked fish, and a pig they had
brought. The price asked for the pig was a hatchet, and as these
were scarce, it was not purchased. When all was made safe, a party
went ashore and was well received by the natives, but those who had
previously been there with Wallis reported that those who were at
that time said to be chiefs, were keeping in the background. The
next day, however, two men, evidently of rank, came on board, and
being invited into the cabin, went through a ceremony described by
Banks: "Each singled out his friend; one took the captain, and the
other chose myself. Each took off a part of his clothes and dressed
his friend with what he took off; in return for this we presented
them with a hatchet and some beads." They were then invited by
their new friends to go ashore. On landing they were escorted to a
building and introduced to an old man they had not seen before, and
he presented Cook with a cock, and Banks with a hen, and each with
a piece of native cloth. Banks gave in return for his share his
large laced silk neckcloth and a linen handkerchief. After this
they were permitted to stroll about, and received many tokens of
amity in the shape of green boughs, and were then entertained at a
banquet, the principal dishes being fish and bread-fruit. Whilst at
dinner, Solander had his pocket picked of an opera glass, and
Monkhouse lost his snuff-box. As soon as this was made known,
Lycurgus, as they had named one of their friends, drove off the
people, striking them and throwing anything he could lay his hand
to, at them. He offered pieces of cloth as compensation, and when
these were refused, extended his offer to everything he possessed.
He was, at last, made to understand that all that was wanted was
the return of the stolen articles, and after a time the snuff-box
and the case of the glass were returned, and, by and by, the glass
itself. During the whole of the stay at the island they had the
greatest difficulties with the natives for stealing, an
accomplishment at which, Cook says, they were "prodigious
expert."</p>

<p>On the whole, their first visit ashore was satisfactory, and was
thought to augur well for the observations of the Transit. A site
was selected for a camp on the eastern point of the bay, to which
the name of Point Venus was given, the longitude, according to
Cook, 149 degrees 31 minutes West, and to Wharton, 149 degrees 29
minutes West. Lines were traced for the boundaries, and Banks's
largest tent was pitched and a guard mounted, and then the others
went for a walk of inspection. They passed through some woods that
Mr. Hicks had been prevented from exploring the day before, and
Banks had the luck to bring down three ducks with one shot, a deed
thought likely to impress the natives with respect for the white
man's weapon. On their road back to camp they were alarmed by a
musket shot, and hurrying on, found that one of the sentries had
been pushed down and his musket stolen, so the midshipman in
command had ordered a shot to be fired at the thief, who was
killed, but the musket was not recovered. All the natives ran away
but one, whom Cook calls Awhaa, and whom the Master, Mr. Molineaux,
who had been out with Wallis, recognised as being a man of some
authority. Through Awhaa an attempt was made to arrange matters,
but the natives were very shy when the English landed the next day.
However, the two chiefs who had first made friends, to whom the
names of Lycurgus and Hercules had been given, again came on board,
bringing presents of pigs and bread-fruit; they concluded as
Hercules's present was the larger, he was the richer and therefore
the more important chief. To lessen the chances of disagreements in
trading and to keep some control of prices, Cook ordered that only
one person should conduct the purchasing for the ship, and as Banks
had shown aptitude in dealing with the natives, he was appointed.
The natives were to be treated "with every imaginable
humanity."</p>

<p>On the 16th Mr. Buchan, the artist, had another epileptic fit,
which was unfortunately fatal, and he was buried at sea in order to
run no risk of offending against any of the customs or
superstitions of the natives. Cook, in referring to his death,
says: "He will be greatly missed in the course of this voyage."</p>

<p>In the afternoon the ship was brought into such a position as to
command the site of the proposed camp, and as there was to be an
eclipse of one of Jupiter's satellites, Cook and Green stayed
ashore to get an observation, but the weather was unpropitious.</p>

<p><b>COOK SKETCHES.</b>
</p>

<p>The camp was now got into order; the north and south sides were
protected by a bank 4 feet 6 inches high on the inside, having a
ditch 10 feet wide and 6 feet deep on the outside. The west side,
facing the bay, had a 4 foot bank crowned by a palisade, with no
ditch; and the east side, on the bank of the river, was protected
by a double row of water casks. The armament consisted of two
carriage guns on the weakest or east side, and six swivel guns, two
on each of the other sides. The garrison was forty-five men,
including civilians, and Cook considered it was practically
impregnable. In the manuscripts department of the British Museum is
a pen and ink sketch and plan of the fort, drawn by Cook, which
agrees much better with the description than the engraving of
Parkinson's drawing published in the History of the Voyage. The
natives were disturbed by these preparations, some even leaving the
bay, but when no dreadful results occurred, they took courage and
returned.</p>

<p>The fort completed, the instruments were landed and put into the
required positions to be prepared for their work, and the following
morning the quadrant, which had not been removed from the case in
which it was packed in London, was found to be missing, although a
sentry had been stationed within five yards of it the whole night.
Enquiries were made, and it was elicited that the thief had been
seen making off with it. Banks, his native friend, and one or two
of the English at once started, closely followed by Cook and a
party of marines. After a long chase the quadrant was recovered,
but some of the smaller parts were missing. After a time these also
were returned in the case of a horse-pistol which had been stolen
from Banks, and soon after the pistol was recovered, and they were
able to return to camp. On their arrival they found Cook's friend,
Dootahah (Hercules), had been detained as a hostage, so he was at
once released, to the great delight of the natives, who had been
much alarmed to see the armed party go into the woods. In order to
show his gratitude for his release Dootahah sent a present of two
hogs to Cook, for which he refused to take any return; but,
afterwards, second thoughts proved best, and he sent a man to ask
for an axe and a shirt, and to say he was going away, and would not
be back for ten days. As the supplies of vegetables and fruit in
the market had been decreasing in quantity, it was thought better
to refuse the present in hopes he would apply for it in person, and
arrangements could then be made for a regular market, but he sent
some one else again, and so word was returned that Cook and Banks
would bring it to him the following day. For fear this promise
should be forgotten, Dootahah again sent his man, and Cook and
Banks started off in the pinnace. On their arrival they were
received by a large crowd, which was kept in order by a man in an
immense turban, armed with a long white stick, "which he applied to
the people with great judgment and relish." The party were
conducted to a large tree, and very graciously received by
Dootahah, who immediately asked for his axe, which was given him,
together with a shirt and a piece of broadcloth made into a
boat-cloak. He put on the cloak and gave the shirt to the man with
the stick, and refreshments were served. They were afterwards
entertained with dancing and wrestling, and then Dootahah
accompanied them back to the ship, taking his supplies for dinner;
and when it became known he was on board, trading was resumed.</p>

<p>A day or two after, Banks received an urgent message from his
friend Taburai (Lycurgus), saying he was very ill. He complained of
having been poisoned by one of the sailors. It seems he had noticed
the sailors chewing, and had ask for a quid, had bitten off a piece
and swallowed it. Banks prescribed large draughts of coconut milk,
with happy results.</p>

<p><b>SURF RIDING.</b>
</p>

<p>Flies were a terrible pest; they got into everything, and ate
off the artist's colours almost as fast as they were laid on. Tar
and molasses was tried as a trap for them, but the natives stole it
and used it as ointment for sores. The surf-riding struck the
visitors with admiration. Swimming out with a piece of board they
would mount it, and come in on the crests of the waves; and Banks
says he does not believe that any European could have lived amongst
the breakers as they did; he especially admired the manner they
timed the waves and dived beneath on their way out from shore.</p>

<p>A blacksmith's forge had been set up, and in spare time the
smith would fashion old iron into axes or repair old axes for the
natives; and it was noticed that some of these old axes were not of
English make, and it appeared unlikely they were obtained from the
Dolphin. At length it was ascertained that since Wallis's visit in
that vessel, two ships had anchored off the east coast, and it was
concluded from the description given by the natives of the flags
that they were Spanish, but on the arrival of the Endeavour at
Batavia they were able to identify them as the French ships
commanded by M. de Bougainville, whose crews were suffering very
severely from scurvy at the time.</p>

<p>Paying a visit to Dootahah to see if a supply of fresh meat,
which was running very short, could be obtained, they were received
in a very friendly manner, but being delayed till it was too late
to return to the ship by daylight, they remained all night, and as
a consequence nearly every one found they had lost some property;
Cook's stockings were stolen from under his pillow, where he had
placed them for safety. Perhaps as consolation for their losses
they were entertained during the night to a concert. Three drums
and four flutes, the latter having four holes into one of which the
performer blew with his nostrils, were the orchestra, and Cook's
criticism is hardly complimentary: "The music and singing were so
much of a piece that I was very glad when it was over." They waited
till noon the next day in hopes of meat and the return of the
stolen articles, but in vain, though Dootahah promised he would
bring all to the ship&mdash;"a promise we had no reason to expect
he would fulfil."</p>

<p><b>THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.</b>
</p>

<p>The important day of the observation was now approaching, and
everything was in readiness. In order to diminish the risk of
disappointment through local atmospheric disturbance, Cook sent a
party to Eimeo (York Island), and a second one to the south-east of
Otaheite, as far to the east of Point Venus as possible. The first
party consisted of Lieutenant Gore, Banks, Sporing, and Monkhouse,
and the second of Lieutenant Hicks, Clerke, Pickersgill, and
Saunders, Mr. Green providing the necessary instruments. At Fort
Venus everything was in good working order. The astronomical clock
was set up in the large tent, being placed in a strong frame made
for the purpose at Greenwich, and was then planted in the ground as
firmly as possible and fenced round to prevent accidental
disturbance. Twelve feet away the observatory was placed,
comprising the telescopes on their stands, the quadrant securely
fixed on the top of a cask of wet sand firmly set in the ground,
and the journeyman clock. The telescopes used by Cook and Green
were two reflecting ones made by Mr. J. Short.</p>

<p>"The 3rd of June proved as favourable to our purposes as we
could wish. Not a cloud to be seen the whole day and the air was
perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in
observing the whole passage of the Planet Venus over the Sun's
Disk. We very distinctly saw the atmosphere or Dusky Shade round
the body of the planet, which very much disturbed the time of
contact, particularly the two internal ones. Dr. Solander observed
as well as Mr. Green and myself, and we differ'd from one another
in observing the times of contact much more than could be expected.
Mr. Green's telescope and mine were of the same magnifying power,
but that of the Doctor was greater than ours. It was nearly calm
the whole day, and the thermometer exposed to the sun about the
middle of the day rose to a degree of heat we have not before met
with."</p>

<p>In the report published in the Philosophical Transactions he
also refers to the heat:</p>

<p>"Every wished-for favourable circumstance attended the whole of
the day, without one single impediment excepting the heat, which
was intolerable; the thermometer which hung by the clock and was
exposed to the sun, as we were, was one time as high as 119
degrees."</p>

<p>This report is accompanied by diagrams illustrating the
different contacts and the effects of the penumbra, which Cook
believed was better seen by Solander than by himself or Green. It
was estimated at about seven-eighths of the diameter of the planet,
and was visible to Cook throughout the whole Transit.</p>

<p>The times taken by Green were:</p>

<p>The first external contact: 9 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds A.M.
The first internal contact: 9 hours 44 minutes 4 seconds A.M. The
second internal contact: 3 hours 14 minutes 8 seconds P.M. The
second external contact: 3 hours 22 minutes 10 seconds P.M.</p>

<p>The other two parties were equally successful, and at times
Banks was able to employ himself in trading with the natives, with
whom he soon got on friendly terms; in fact, he had to decline
further purchases as he had as much as they could take away with
them. He was also successful in his botanical enquiries, obtaining
several plants he had not seen in Otaheite.</p>

<p>Whilst the observations were being taken some of the crew broke
into the store and stole a quantity of the large nails that were
used as a medium of trade with the islanders. One man was found
with seven in his possession, and after careful enquiry was
sentenced to two dozen lashes, which seems to have been the
severest sentence meted out by Cook during the voyage. The sentence
was carried out, and though it was well known that more than one
was implicated, he refused to name any one else, but suffered in
silence.</p>

<p><b>A DOG DINNER.</b>
</p>

<p>The King's Birthday being on 5th June, Cook entertained several
of the chiefs at dinner, and the health of Kilnargo was toasted so
many times by some of them that the result was disastrous. One of
the presents received from a chief was a dog, which they were
informed was good to eat. After some discussion it was handed to a
native named Tupia, who had made himself very useful, and
afterwards accompanied them on the voyage; and he having smothered
it with his hands, and drawn it, wrapped it in leaves and baked it
in a native oven. With some hesitation it was tasted, and met with
general approval. Cook says: "Therefore we resolved for the future
never to despise dog flesh"; and in another place he says they put
dog's flesh "next only to English lamb." These dogs were bred for
eating, and lived entirely on vegetable food.</p>

<p>The main object of their stay at Otaheite having been attained,
steps were taken for further prosecution of the voyage; the ship
was careened, her bottom scraped and found free from worm, but the
boats had suffered, particularly the long-boat, which had to have a
new bottom. She had been varnished only; the other boats, painted
with white lead, had not suffered so much. The stores were
overhauled, and the ship was fitted for sea. Whilst these
preparations were being made, Cook and Banks made a circuit of the
island in the pinnace to examine the coast. Several good anchorages
were found, with from sixteen to twenty-four fathoms and good
holding ground. The south-east portion was almost cut off from the
mainland by a narrow, marshy isthmus about two miles wide, over
which the natives dragged their canoes with little difficulty. On
the south coast one of the large burying-places was seen; by far
the most extensive one on the island. It is described as:</p>

<p>"a long square of stonework built pyramidically; its base is 267
feet by 87 feet; at the Top it is 250 feet by 8 feet. It is built
in the same manner as we do steps leading up to a sun-dial or
fountain erected in the middle of a square, where there is a flite
of steps on each side. In this building there are 11 of such steps;
each step is about 4 feet in height, and the breadth 4 feet 7
inches, but they decreased both in height and breadth from the
bottom to the Top. On the middle of the Top stood the image of a
Bird carved in wood, near it lay the broken one of a Fish, carved
in stone. There was no hollow or cavity in the inside, the whole
being filled up with stones. The outside was faced partly with hewn
stones, and partly with others, and these were placed in such a
manner as to look very agreeable to the eye. Some of the hewn
stones were 4 feet 7 inches by 2 feet 4 inches, and 15 inches
thick, and had been squared and polished with some sort of an edge
tool. On the east side was, enclosed with a stone wall, a piece of
ground in form of a square, 360 feet by 354, in this was growing
several cypress trees and plantains. Round about this Morie were
several smaller ones, all going to decay, and on the Beach, between
them and the sea, lay scattered up and down, a great quantity of
human bones. Not far from the Great Morie, was 2 or 3 pretty large
altars, where lay the scull bones of some Hogs and Dogs. This
monument stands on the south side of Opooreanoo, upon a low point
of land about 100 yards from the sea. It appeared to have been
built many years and was in a state of decay, as most of their
Mories are."</p>

<p>They were quite unable to gain information as to the history of
these remains, nor of the religious belief of the islander, though
they appeared to have some vague notions of a future life.</p>

<p><b>AN EXCURSION INLAND.</b>
</p>

<p>When the party returned to Point Venus, they found the refitting
nearly complete, but the anchor stocks all had to be renewed owing
to the ravages of the sea worms, so Banks and Monkhouse made an
excursion up the river on which the camp was situated. In about
nine miles the precipitous banks had completely closed them in, and
further advance was blocked by a cliff, at least 100 feet high,
over which the river fell. The natives with them said they had
never been further, so the expedition returned. Charles Darwin, in
1835, made an attempt to ascend the same river, and though he
penetrated some distance further, he describes the country as
extremely difficult; he saw several places where two or three
determined men could easily hold at bay many times their own
number.</p>

<p>Gardens had been laid out during their stay, and European seeds
were planted which were very fairly successful; except some brought
out by Cook in carefully sealed bottles, none of which turned out
well.</p>

<p>Some of the sailors were either enticed away, or attempted to
desert, so Cook seized one or two of the chiefs as hostages, and
the runaways were quickly returned. Some of the natives were
anxious to go away with them, and Banks persuaded Cook to let him
take Tupia, a man supposed to be of priestly rank, who had proved
himself very useful on several occasions, and he was allowed to
take with him a boy as servant. Cook records, on leaving, that
during the three months' stay they had been on very good terms with
the natives, and the few misunderstandings that did occur rose
either from the difficulty of explaining matters to each other, or
else from the inveterate habits of theft on the part of the
natives&mdash;iron in any shape being simply irresistible.</p>

<p>On 13th July the Endeavour sailed for Huaheine, anchoring inside
the reef on the north-west, on the 17th. Banks, Solander,
Monkhouse, and Tupia at once accompanied Cook ashore, where a
ceremony, presumed to be a sort of treaty of peace, was gone
through, and then they were permitted to go where they liked. On
this ceremonial Cook says:</p>

<p>"It further appear'd that the things which Tupia gave away, was
for the God of this people, as they gave us a hog and some coconuts
for our God, and thus they have certainly drawn us in to commit
sacrilege, for the Hog hath already received sentence of Death and
is to be dissected tomorrow."</p>

<p><b>A CAREFUL PILOT.</b>
</p>

<p>A market was organised by Monkhouse, and as soon as the natives
understood that the stay of the ship would be very short, they
managed to produce a fairly good supply of fruits and vegetables.
The people were found to be rather lighter complexioned, and
certainly not so addicted to thieving as the Otaheitans. As a
memorial of the visit, Cook gave the chief a plate with the
inscription, "His Britannick Majesty's Ship, Endeavour, Lieutenant
Cook, Commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine." He also added "some
medals, or counters of the English coins, struck in 1761, and other
presents," and the recipient promised he would never part with
them. From this place they went on to Ulietea (Raiatea), landing on
the 21st; and after another ceremonial the English "Jack" was
hoisted, and possession taken of the whole group in the name of
King George. Tupia proved himself an excellent pilot, with great
knowledge of the localities, and, having sent down a diver at
Huaheine to ascertain the exact draught of the ship, he was very
careful she never went into less than five fathoms of water. He had
evidently had great experience in navigating these seas in canoes,
boats of whose construction and sailing qualities Cook speaks in
the highest terms. Banks at this time remarks, "we have now seen 17
islands in these seas, and have landed on five of the most
important; the language, manners and customs agreed most
exactly."</p>

<p>Detained by adverse wind off Ataha, and finding the water coming
badly into the fore sail-room and powder-room, Cook put into the
west side to repair and take in ballast, as the ship was getting
too light to carry sail on a wind. He took the opportunity to
survey to the north with Banks and Solander. Putting into one
place, they were well received and entertained with music and
dancing, and Cook's verdict was that "neither their Musick or
Dancing were at all calculated to please a European." A sort of
farce was also acted, but they could make nothing of it, except
that it "showed that these people have a notion of Dramatic
Performances."</p>

<p>During the whole stay in the Society Group they had been very
well off for fresh food, consequently their sea stores had been
little called on.</p>

<p>Jarvis, in his History of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands, says
that with Cook "a silence in regard to the maritime efforts of his
predecessors is observable throughout his Journals"; and as a proof
that he traded on the knowledge of others, he remarks that at
Otaheite he made enquiries if there were any islands to the north;
and afterwards evinced no surprise when he discovered them. Now
Cook in his Journals constantly shows that he compares his
knowledge with that of others, and often regrets he has not further
records to consult. As for his enquiries, he would have been
grossly neglecting his duty had he not made them, for it was only a
commonsense method of procedure, which evidently Mr. Jarvis could
not understand. The result of these enquiries can be seen in the
British Museum in the shape of a map drawn by Cook from information
given by Tupia. On it are some sentences in the Otaheitan
language.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9. 1769 TO 1770. NEW ZEALAND.</h2>

<p>Leaving the Society Islands on 9th August, they were off
Ohetiroa (Rurutu), in the Central Group, on the 14th, but the
natives were unfriendly, and they did not land. A canoe came out to
meet the pinnace which had been sent to obtain information. The
occupants, on being presented with gifts, tried to steal the lot,
and were fired over, but by some mischance one of the natives was
slightly wounded in the head, whereupon they hurriedly retreated,
and further attempts at communication were abandoned. From this
place the course was laid to the south to strike the much-talked-of
Southern Continent. The weather rapidly got colder, and the pigs
and fowls began to sicken and die. On 26th August they celebrated
the anniversary of leaving England by cutting a Cheshire cheese and
tapping a cask of porter, which proved excellent.</p>

<p>On the 28th an unfortunate death occurred; the boatswain's mate,
John Reading, was given some rum by his chief, and it is supposed
drunk it off at once, for he was shortly afterwards found to be
very drunk, and was taken to his berth, but next morning was past
recovery.</p>

<p>On 2nd September, in latitude 40 degrees 22 minutes South, the
weather was very bad, and "having not the least visible signs of
land," Cook again turned northwards, in order to get better weather
and then to push west. The continuous swell convinced him there was
no large body of land to the south for many leagues. Towards the
end of September frequent signs were noted of being near land,
floating seaweed, wood, the difference in the birds, etc., so a
gallon of rum was offered to the first to sight land, and on 7th
October the North Island of New Zealand, never before approached
from the east by Europeans, was seen by a boy named Nicholas Young,
the servant of Mr. Perry, surgeon's mate. The boy's name is omitted
from the early muster sheets of the ship, but appears on 18th April
1769, entered as A.B. in the place of Peter Flower, drowned. Cook
named the point seen, the south-west point of Poverty Bay, Young
Nick's Head.</p>

<p>Tasman had discovered the west coast in 1642, and had given it
the name of Staten Land, but he never set foot on shore. He was
driven away by the natives, who killed four of his men, and naming
the place Massacre (now Golden) Bay, he sailed along the north-west
coast, giving the headlands the names they still bear. Dalrymple
held that this land discovered by Tasman was the west coast of the
looked-for Terra Australis Incognita, and his theory was now
shattered.</p>

<p><b>LAND IN NEW ZEALAND.</b>
</p>

<p>Nearing the coast a bay was discovered into which the ship
sailed, and let go her anchor near the mouth of a small river, not
far from where the town of Guisborne now stands. Plenty of smoke
was seen, showing the country was inhabited, and the pinnace and
yawl were manned and armed, and Cook landed on the east side of the
river. Some natives were seen on the other side, and, to try to
open communications, the yawl, pulled by four boys, entered the
river, whilst Cook followed up the natives, who had retreated
towards some huts about 300 yards away. Some Maoris, thinking the
boys would be an easy prey, tried to steal on the yawl, but the
coxswain of the pinnace observing them called the boat back. One of
the Maoris raised his spear to throw, and the coxswain fired over
his head, causing a moment's pause of surprise; but, seeing nothing
further, he again prepared to throw his spear, so the coxswain shot
him, and his friends retreated at once, leaving the body behind.
Cook at once ordered a return to the ship, as it was now getting
dark.</p>

<p>The next morning, seeing some men near the same place, Cook
again landed with Banks, Solander, and an armed party; and Solander
went forward to the brink of the river to try and speak with the
natives, but was received with a threatening waving of spears and a
war dance. Cook retired to the boats, and landing the marines,
again advanced with Green, Monkhouse, and Tupia. The latter spoke
to the natives; and, to the great delight of the party, found he
could make himself understood. After a little parley an unarmed
native swam across the river, and was then followed by twenty or
thirty more with their arms. Presents were given, but they seemed
dissatisfied, and wanted arms. At last one stole Green's hanger,
and they all became very aggressive and insolent, whilst more were
seen to be preparing to cross; so Cook, thinking the position was
getting too serious, ordered the one who had taken the hanger, and
who was apparently the leader, to be shot, whereon the rest beat a
hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The next day the boats tried to find another landing-place, but
the surf was too heavy; and when two canoes were seen coming in
from the sea, Cook determined to intercept them and try to come to
friendly terms. However, they would not stop when called on, and on
a musket being fired over them, the occupants seized their weapons
and fiercely attacked the nearest boat, its crew being compelled to
fire in self-defence, and Cook says two natives were killed. Banks
gives the number as four, and the Maori account agrees with him.
Three jumped overboard to swim ashore, but were picked up by the
boats and taken on board ship. They were at first very depressed,
but soon recovered their spirits on finding themselves well
treated, and after eating and drinking enormously, entertained the
crew with songs and dances. Cook deeply regretted this incident,
and candidly confesses that he was not justified in trying to seize
the canoes, but having once committed himself, he was obliged for
his own safety to go to the bitter end. Banks says the day is "the
most disagreeable my life has yet seen; black be the mark for it,
and heaven send that such may never return to embitter future
reflection."</p>

<p>The next day a party landed to cut wood, and was accompanied by
the three captives, whom they tried to persuade to join their
friends. The suggestion was declined, as they professed to be
afraid of being eaten, and after a time went and hid in some
bushes. Cook, noticing several parties of armed natives advancing
in a threatening manner, retired his woodcutters across the river.
About 150 to 200 Maoris gathered on the opposite bank. Tupia was
put forward to parley, and some presents were shown, and at length
one man came over who received a present from each of the British
and then rejoined his friends. Cook then returned to the ship,
taking with him the three youths, who still seemed afraid of their
own countrymen. They were again landed the next morning as the ship
was about to sail, and though they still professed to be
frightened, were soon seen walking away in friendly converse with
some who had come to meet them.</p>

<p><b>NATIVE ACCOUNT.</b>
</p>

<p>Mr. Polack, a New Zealand resident, gives an account in his New
Zealand, which he gathered from the children of natives who were
present at the landing of Cook. The tribe then living in the
neighbourhood were recent arrivals, their leader being Te
Ratu&mdash;the first man killed by the English. The natives were
anxious to avenge him, but were afraid of the "thunderbolts which
killed at a long distance," some indeed went so far as to say they
felt ill if an Englishman looked at them. The idea of revenge was
only ended on the vessel leaving. Mr. Polack's chief witness was
the son of a man who was wounded by a ball in the shoulder, but
survived his wound till within a year or two of 1836, the time the
information was obtained. Before the ship left, a sort of peace was
patched up by means of presents, and the dead bodies which had been
left where they fell, apparently as a protest, were removed.</p>

<p>Cook describes the country as a narrow slip of low sand, backed
by well-wooded hills, rising in the interior into high mountains,
on which patches of snow could be seen. That it was fairly
populated was evident from the smoke rising through the trees, more
especially in the valleys leading into Poverty Bay as he named it,
because they were unable to get anything but a small quantity of
wood.</p>

<p>At Hawke's Bay, whilst trading was going on, a large war canoe
came up, and the occupants received some presents. Cook noticed a
man wearing a cloak of some black skin, and offered a piece of red
cloth for it. The owner took it off, but would not part with it
till he received the cloth, and then his boat was pushed off from
the ship, and Cook lost both his cloak and his cloth. Soon after a
determined attempt was made to steal Tupia's boy, Tayeto, who was
handing some things down to a canoe; the Maoris had to be fired on,
and in the consequent confusion the boy jumped into the water and
swam to the ship. The point off which this occurred was named Cape
Kidnapper. As there was no appearance of a harbour, Cook altered
his course to the north at Cape Turnagain, 40 degrees 34 minutes
South, to see if he could not do better in the other direction.</p>

<p>All the canoes seen along this coast were well made, far in
advance of anything they had seen before, and the grotesque carving
and ornamental work was admirably executed. The dresses warn were
usually two cloak-shaped garments, one warn round the shoulders,
the other round the loins, and were made of a substance like hemp,
some being very fine. Banks had purchased something like them at
Rio de Janeiro, for which he gave thirty-six shillings, thinking it
cheap, but these were as fine, if not finer, in texture. Dogs,
which were used as food, and rats were the only quadrupeds seen.
Whilst Banks and Solander were collecting, they discovered a large
natural arch, which the former describes as the most magnificent
surprise he had ever met with. It was sketched by Parkinson, and is
engraved in the History. Cook also made a pen-and-ink sketch of it,
which is in the British Museum.</p>

<p><b>COOK'S WASHING STOLEN.</b>
</p>

<p>On 31st October they rounded East Cape, and following the coast,
which trended more to the west, they saw a great number of villages
and patches of cultivation, some of the last looking as if freshly
ploughed. The whole aspect of the country was changing for the
better, but the inhabitants did not seem more peaceably inclined.
Five canoes came out to the ship fully armed, and apparently bent
on mischief. Cook was very busy, and did not want them on board, so
to keep them off ordered a musket to be fired over them; but as it
only caused them to stop for a moment, a round shot was sent over
them, and they hurriedly turned tail. The place was given the name
Cape Runaway. White Island was named, but it must have been
quiescent as there is no note of its being a volcano. As they
sailed along the coast they met with canoes from which fish,
lobsters, and mussels were purchased, and trading seemed well
established, when one gentleman took a fancy to Cook's sheets,
which were trailing overboard (they were in the wash), and refused
to give them up. Muskets were fired over them and they fled, and
Cook lost his sheets. From near White Island, Mount Edgecombe was
seen, named after the sergeant of marines. It is a high round
mountain, and forms a conspicuous landmark on both sides of the
North Island. During this day they had noticed several small
villages perched on difficult eminences and surrounded by
palisades, which Tupia declared were "Mories or places of worship,"
but, says Cook:</p>

<p>"I rather think they are places of retreat or strongholds, where
they defend themselves against the attack of an enemy, as some of
them seem'd not ill design'd for that purpose."</p>

<p>British soldiers have since discovered that a Maori Pah is "not
ill designed for that purpose." Cook most unfortunately missed the
Harbour of Tauranga, the only safe port on the east coast between
Auckland and Wellington for ships of any size.</p>

<p><b>NATIVE ACCOUNT.</b>
</p>

<p>In what is now known as Cook's Bay, they managed to induce the
natives to trade, and purchased crayfish, over which Parkinson
waxes enthusiastic, and "Mackerell as good as ever was eat," the
latter in such large quantities that they were able to salt a
considerable number, thus saving their sea stores. After an
observation of a transit of Mercury, in which they were not very
successful (Wharton thinks they were taken by surprise, the transit
occurring somewhat earlier than expected; Green says:
"Unfortunately for the seamen, their look-out was on the wrong side
of the sun. The end was likewise as grossly mistaken"), they
returned to the ship and found that there had been a difficulty
with the natives, who had assumed a very threatening manner, and
one attempted to run off with a piece of calico which was at that
time a subject of barter. Mr. Gore seized a musket and fired,
killing his man. Colonel Mundy, in Our Antipodes, says he saw a man
named Taniwha, in 1848, who remembered Cook's visit, and imitated
his walk, with the peculiar manner he had of waving his right hand,
and also told of the kindly way Cook had with the children. Taniwha
told Mundy that after the man was shot, the Maoris landed,
consulted over the body, and decided that as the corpse "commenced
the quarrel by the theft of the calico, his death should not be
revenged, but that he should be buried in the cloth which he had
paid for with his life." Colonel Wynyard took down the same story
from Taniwha's lips in 1852, when he was supposed to be about
ninety-three, and says: "His faculties were little impaired, and
his great age perceptible more from a stoop and grey hairs than any
other infirmity." Cook expressed very strong disapproval of Mr.
Gore's conduct.</p>

<p>Next day Cook and Banks explored a river that entered near where
they were anchored, the east side of which was very barren, but the
west was much better, no signs of cultivation showing on either.
Wild fowl were plentiful, and oysters, "as good as ever came from
Colchester," and of about the same size, says Banks, were taken on
board in large quantities:</p>

<p>"laid down under the booms, and employed the ship's company very
well, who, I sincerely believe, did nothing but eat them from the
time they came on board till night, by which time a large part were
expended. But this gave us no kind of uneasiness, since we well
knew that not the boat only, but the ship might be loaded in one
tide almost, as they are dry at half ebb."</p>

<p>Cook thinks the inhabitants lived on fish, and shell-fish, with
fern roots for bread, for very large heaps of shells were found,
but no signs of cultivation.</p>

<p>A fortified village was visited, the inhabitants good-naturedly
conducting them all over, and showing whatever they expressed a
wish to see. It was built on a high promontory, whose sides were in
some places quite inaccessible, in others very difficult, except
where it faced the narrow edge of the hill. Here it was defended by
a double ditch and bank, with two rows of pickets, the inner row
being on the bank, leaving standing-room for the defenders. The
inner ditch was 24 feet from bottom to top of the bank. A stage
about 30 feet high, 40 feet long, and 6 feet wide, was erected
inside the fence, with a second, a few paces from it, placed at
right angles; from these the garrison were able to throw their
spears and stones on to the heads of their enemies. The whole
village was surrounded by a strong picket fence, running close to
the edge of the hill. The entire surface of the top of the hill was
cut up into small squares, each surrounded by its own fence, and
communicating by narrow lanes, with little gateways, so that if the
outer defences were forced each square could be defended in turn.
Cook says:</p>

<p>"I look upon it to be a very strong and well choose Post, and
where a small number of resolute men might defend themselves a long
time against a vast superior force, armed in the manner as these
people are."</p>

<p>He noticed, with quick eye, the great failing in these native
fortresses, that is, the want of storage for water. In these Maori
villages it was remarked that sanitary arrangements were provided,
such as, says Beckmann in his History of Inventions, did not exist
in the palace of the King of Spain at that time.</p>

<p>Large quantities of iron sand were noted here, but the use was
quite unknown to the natives, who were indifferent to the iron
tools or spikes which had hitherto been such a valuable medium of
exchange elsewhere. A large supply of wild celery and a fresh
boat-load of oysters were put on board; a tree was marked with the
name of the ship, the date, and one or two other particulars, the
flag was hoisted, saluted, and possession taken of the country, and
the ship sailed again on her journey.</p>

<p><b>AT THE THAMES.</b>
</p>

<p>Running closely along the coast, they hauled round Cape Colville
into "the Entrance of a Straight, Bay or River," and anchored for
the night, and in the morning they stood on along the east side.
Canoes came off, and from the behaviour of the occupants, some of
whom came on board at the first invitation, it was judged that
favourable accounts had been heard of the ship. After running about
5 leagues the water shoaled to about 6 fathoms, and the ship
anchored, and boats were sent out to sound. No great increase of
depth being found, the pinnace and long-boat went up a river about
9 miles away, and on account of a fancied resemblance named it the
Thames. They landed at a village near the mouth, being well
received, but desiring to take advantage of the flood-tide which
ran "as strong as it does in the River Thames below bridge," they
made no stay; they went up about 14 miles, and then, finding little
alteration in the appearance of the country, landed to inspect some
large trees of a kind they had previously noticed. One was
carefully measured, and was found to be 19 feet 6 inches girth at 6
feet from the ground, and, by means of Cook's quadrant, 89 feet to
the lowest branch. It was perfectly straight, and tapered very
slightly, and some were seen that were even larger. This was the
Black Pine; to the Maoris, Matoi, and to the naturalist,
Podocarpus.</p>

<p>On the way down the river their friends of the morning came out
and "traffick'd with us in the most friendly manner imaginable,
until they had disposed of the few trifles they had." When the
boats got outside they had to anchor, as a strong tide and breeze
were against them, and they did not reach the ship till next
morning, when the breeze had increased to a gale, and topgallant
yards had to be struck. When the wind dropped, what was left was
against them, and the Endeavour would only go with the tide, so
Cook took a run ashore to the west side of the bay, but saw nothing
of interest, and concluded it was but sparsely inhabited. Whilst he
was away natives went off to trade and behaved remarkably well,
with the exception of one man who was caught making off with the
half-hour glass, so Mr. Hicks had him triced up, and he was given a
dozen lashes. When it was explained to his friends why this was
done, they expressed their approval, and on his release an old man
gave him another thrashing.</p>

<p>The weather now became very unsettled, and they were not able to
keep as near the coast as they desired, but on 26th November some
cultivated spots were seen, and several canoes came off.</p>

<p>"Some of the natives ventur'd on board; to two, who appeared to
be chiefs, I gave presents. After these were gone out of the ship,
the others became so Troublesome that in order to get rid of them,
we were at the expense of two or three Musquet Balls and one 4
pound shott, but as no harm was intended them, none they received,
unless they happened to overheat themselves in pulling ashore."</p>

<p><b>A STAMPEDE.</b>
</p>

<p>To the west side of Cape Brett is a deep bay which was seen but
not named, and here the town of Russell is now established, said to
possess one of the finest harbours in the world, into which vessels
of any draught can enter in all weathers and at any state of the
tide. The natives were found difficult to deal with, and "would
cheat whenever they had an opportunity." The ship left its
anchorage, but was after a time driven back again, and Cook, with a
party, took the opportunity to land. They were followed up by the
Maoris, and were soon surrounded by about two hundred of them, some
of whom tried to seize the boats, but being driven off tried to
break in on the party. Several charges of small shot, which did no
serious damage, were fired into them, and then the ship fired a 4
pounder over them, which caused a stampede, and during the rest of
the stay there was no further trouble, but Cook had to punish three
of his own men for stealing potatoes from one of the plantations.
He invariably tried to hold the balance fairly between his men and
the natives.</p>

<p>The country is described as very similar to that seen before,
but the number of inhabitants was greater, and though apparently
not under the same chiefs, they were on good terms with each other,
and inclined to be civil to their visitors. A good deal of the
ground was under cultivation, producing good sweet-potatoes. A few
trees of the paper-mulberry were seen, from which the natives made
a cloth in a similar manner to the Otaheitans, but the quantity was
so small that it was only used for ornament. Tupia, who had been
instructed to gain as much information about the people as he
could, was informed that some of their ancestors once went off in
large canoes and discovered a country to the north-west after a
passage of about a month, only a small number returning. These
reported they had been to a place where the people ate hogs, using
the same word for the animal as the Otaheitans, Tupia asked if they
had any in New Zealand, and the reply was "no." He asked if their
ancestors brought any back, again the answer was "no"; whereon he
told them their story must be a lie, for their ancestors could
never have been such fools as to come back without some. The land
said to have been discovered may have been New Caledonia.</p>

<p>One of the men who had been wounded at the first coming of the
ship was seen by Banks. A ball had gone through his arm and grazed
his chest. He did not seem to have any pain, and the wound though
exposed to the air, was perfectly healthy, and he was greatly
pleased to receive a musket ball like the one which had wounded
him.</p>

<p>When leaving the bay they nearly grounded, being set by the
current towards a small island, but the boats towed them clear.
Very soon after they struck on an unseen rock, which was named
Whale Rock, but almost immediately got clear, with no "perceptible
damage," into twenty fathoms.</p>

<p><b>BLOWN OFF THE LAND.</b>
</p>

<p>Progress was now very slow, owing either to want of, or adverse
wind. On 10th December they discovered two bays separated by a low
neck of land, Knuckle Point; one bay was named Doubtless Bay and
the other Sandy Bay; the country is described as nothing but
irregular white sandhills, and Cook concluded from its appearance
that the island was here very narrow and exposed to the open sea on
the west. This he soon proved to be correct. Foster, in his account
of the Second Voyage, says that when the Endeavour was passing
Doubtless Bay, M. de Surville was anchored under the land, in the
Saint Jean Baptiste, and saw Cook's ship, though himself unseen. In
the account of De Surville's voyage, published by the Academie
Francaise, it is stated that New Zealand was not sighted till 12th
December 1769, and owing to bad weather no anchorage was gained
till 17th. No mention whatever is made of the Endeavour being
sighted, and M. l'Abbe Rochon, the editor, thinks it most probable
that neither navigator knew anything of the movements of the other.
De Surville mentions having lost anchors in a place he calls Double
Bay, during a storm "ABOUT 22nd December," and it may possibly have
been the one Cook encountered on the 28th off the north end of the
island. They were blown out of sight of land on the 13th, the main
topsail being split, and next day both fore and mizzen topsails
were lost, but they managed to bring up under shelter of a small
island off Knuckle Point. On the 15th the latitude was found to be
34 degrees 6 minutes South, with land visible to the south-west,
and a large swell was coming from the west, so Cook concluded this
was the most northerly point of the island, and named it North
Cape.</p>

<p>After beating about for some days against westerly winds, they
ran up north, returning southwards 23rd December, and the following
day sighted land to the south-east, which proved to be Tasman's
Three Kings. Here Banks provided the Christmas dinner, shooting
several solan geese, which were made into a pie, and were "eaten
with great approbation; and in the evening all hands were as drunk
as our forefathers used to be upon like occasions."</p>

<p>On the 27th, when about thirty leagues west of North Cape, and
about the same latitude as the Bay of Islands, no land in sight,
the wind rose so that they had to bring to, under the mainsail, but
moderated a little the next day so that they could run in towards
the land. Again it freshened up and blew a perfect hurricane,
accompanied by heavy rain, and a "prodidgeous high sea," which
caused the ship to go greatly to leeward. On the 30th, Cape Maria
van Diemen was seen about six leagues off, the land extending east
and south. On the last day of the year their position was given as
"34 degrees 42 minutes South, Cape Maria van Diemen North-East by
North about 5 leagues." Cook says:</p>

<p>"I cannot help thinking but what it will appear a little strange
that, at this season of the year, we should be three weeks in
getting fifty leagues, for so long is it since we pass'd Cape
Brett; but it will hardly be credited that in the midst of summer
and in the latitude of 35 degrees South such a gale of wind as we
have had could have happened, which for its strength and
continuance was such as I hardly was ever in before. Fortunately at
this time we were a good distance from land, otherwise it would
have proved fatal to us."</p>

<p><b>VEGETABLE SHEEP.</b>
</p>

<p>On 2nd January 1770 Cook fixed the position of Cape Maria van
Diemen, giving it as 34 degrees 30 minutes South, 187 degrees 18
minutes West of Greenwich. Admiral Wharton remarks that this is
extraordinarily correct, seeing that the ship was never close to
the Cape, and the observations were all taken in very bad weather.
The latitude is exact, and the longitude only three miles out. He
missed seeing Kaipara Harbour, one of the few good ones on the west
coast, and describes the land as having a most desolate and
inhospitable appearance, nothing but sandhills with hardly a sign
of vegetation on them, and says: "If we was once clear of it, I am
determined not to come so near again if I can avoid it, unless we
have a very favourable wind indeed." On the 11th, a high mountain,
its summit covered with snow, was seen, and named Mount Egmont;
Wharton gives its height as 8,300 feet, and describes it as a
magnificent conical mountain surrounded on three sides by the sea.
Banks notes on the sides of the hill "many white lumps in companies
which bore much resemblance to flocks of sheep." These were a
peculiar plant, Raoulia mammillaris (Hooker), known in New Zealand
as vegetable sheep. Fires were seen, the first sign of inhabitants
on the west coast.</p>

<p>On the 14th, thinking he was in the entrance of a large bay,
Cook ran in under the southern coast, and finding it broken into
promising-looking bays, determined to run into one and careen the
ship, as she was very foul; it is now called Ship Cove, in Queen
Charlotte's Sound. Here they were at once visited by canoes, whose
fully armed occupants commenced acquaintance by "heaving a few
stones against the ship." Tupia opened a conversation, and a few
ventured on board, but did not make a long stay. Cook then landed
to look for water, and soon found an excellent supply, and "as to
wood the land is here an entire forest." Whilst he was away, the
crew got out the nets, and caught about 300 pounds of fish. Some
natives also came off with fish, and though it was not good, Cook
ordered it to be bought, in order to open up trade with them.
However, they soon found these people were inclined to be
quarrelsome and threatening, and as the ship was in an awkward
position, being already hove down for cleaning, a charge of small
shot was fired at the worst offender, which quickly taught them to
behave better in future.</p>

<p>They had long suspected the natives were addicted to
cannibalism, and now they proved it, as they purchased the bone of
a forearm of a man, from which the flesh had been recently picked,
and were given to understand that a few days before a strange canoe
had arrived, and its occupants had been killed and eaten. They only
ate their enemies, but held all strangers to be such. The place
where the ship was careened was, according to Wharton, about 70
miles from Massacre Bay, where Tasman's men were killed, and Cook
endeavoured to find out if there were any traditions of visits from
ships to the neighbourhood, but could gain no information. The
natives became friendly as time went on, and brought good fish
which they sold for nails, cloth, paper (a great favourite at
first, but when they found it would not stand water, worthless),
and Cook says: "In this Traffic they never once attempted to
defraud us of any one thing, but dealt as fair as people could
do."</p>

<p>The surrounding country was too thickly timbered for them to see
much, but one day, being out in a boat trying to find the end of
the inlet, Cook took the opportunity of climbing a thickly timbered
hill, and from there saw, far away to the eastward, that the seas
which washed both west and eastern coasts were united, and that one
part of New Zealand, at any rate, was an island, and he had thus
solved one of the problems he had given him in England. They also
saw that much of their immediate neighbourhood was not mainland as
they had thought, but consisted of a number of small islands.</p>

<p><b>A MORE SENSIBLE PEOPLE.</b>
</p>

<p>The population of the district was estimated at only some three
or four hundred, and appeared to subsist on fish and fern roots.
They were evidently poorer than those seen previously, and their
canoes are described as "mean and almost without ornament." They
soon understood the value of iron, and readily took spike nails
when trading, and greatly preferred "Kersey and Broadcloth to the
Otaheite cloth, which show'd them to be a more sensible people than
many of their neighbours," says Cook.</p>

<p>An old man, who had previously paid several visits, complained
that one of the ships boats had fired on and wounded two Maoris,
one of whom was since dead. On enquiry, Cook found that the Master
and five petty officers, fishing beyond the usual limits, were
approached by two canoes in what they thought was a threatening
manner and had fired to keep them off. A second native assured Cook
no death had occurred, and enquiry failed to discover one; but Cook
very severely condemned the action of his men as totally
unjustifiable. The ship had, by this time, been brought into fairly
good trim, being clean, freshly caulked and tarred, and broken
ironwork all repaired, so preparations were made to push through
the straits; but, before leaving, two posts were set up, one near
the watering place, and the other on the island, Motuara, on which
the name of the ship and the date of the visit had been cut, and
possession was taken of this land, the king's health being drunk,
and the empty bottle presented to the old man who had complained
about the shooting, and who was greatly delighted with his present;
he also was given some silver threepenny pieces, dated 1763, and
spike nails marked with the broad arrow.</p>

<p>On getting out into the strait a very strong current nearly
drove them on to a small island, the anchor would not hold, and
only a change in the current, probably caused by the tide, saved
them. The southern point of the North Island was named "Cape
Pallisser, in honour of my worthy friend, Captain Pallisser," and
the north point of the South Island was called Cape Campbell, after
Captain John Campbell, F.R.S., who had been one of Cook's strongest
supporters as Observer for the Royal Society.</p>

<p>When through the straits Cook was turning south, but finding
some of his people were not quite satisfied as to the part they had
passed being an island, he took a northerly course till Cape
Turnagain was recognised, when he at once went about for the south.
Banks says:</p>

<p>"At this time there were two parties on board, one who wished
that the land in sight might, and the others that it might not,
prove to be a continent. I myself have always been most firm in the
former wish, though sorry I am to say that my party is so small
that there are none heartily of it than myself, and one poor
midshipman, the rest begin to sigh for roast beef."</p>

<p>The east coast was followed down to Banks Peninsula, which was
at first thought might be an island, and is marked by dotted lines
as doubtful in Cook's chart, when Gore thought he had seen land to
the east, and Cook, though convinced it was a mistake, ran out to
make sure. On returning the winds proved contrary, and their
progress was very slow, but they several times succeeded in running
close in to the land, and from what they could see concluded it was
very barren, with high ranges in the interior and with very few
evidences of inhabitants. A favourable breeze springing up from the
north, they tried to make the most of it, "and by that means
carried away the main topgallant mast and fore topmast
steering-sail boom, but these were soon replaced by others." A high
bluff was named after Admiral Saunders, and near were several bays,
"wherein there appear'd to be anchorage and shelter from
South-West, Westerly, and North-West winds." One of these is now
Otago Harbour, the port of Dunedin.</p>

<p><b>THE TRAPS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 26th February it blew hard from west-south-west, so they
stood southward. They lost the fore-sail, and then the wind
moderated, only to come on with increased fury about daylight, when
their main topsail went. The storm continued for forty-eight hours,
and half that time they lay to, heading south. After being lost for
seven days the land was again sighted near Cape Saunders, and at
night a large fire was seen on shore. On 6th March, being satisfied
that he had passed the south point of the island, Cook altered his
course to the west, and nearly ran on some partially submerged
rocks a few miles to the south-east of Stewart Island, to which he
gave the suggestive name of the Traps. They were again blown off,
but picked up the land again at the western end of Foveaux Straits.
Again they had to run off, returning to near Dusky Bay, which he
wished to enter as he thought it looked a likely harbour, but the
difficulty of getting out again and consequent waste of time
prevented him. Off Cape Foulwind&mdash;suggestive name&mdash;they
were again blown out to sea, but soon recovered their position, and
Cook describes the land:</p>

<p>"No country upon earth can appear with a more rugged and barren
aspect than this does from the sea, for as far inland as the eye
can reach nothing is to be seen but the summits of these rocky
mountains, which seem to lay so near one another as not to admit
any vallies between them."</p>

<p>On the 24th they rounded the north point of the South Island,
and on the 27th Cook writes: "As we have now circumnavigated the
whole of this country, it is time for me to think of quitting it."
He had thus carried out to the fullest extent the instructions to
determine the situation and nature of the land seen by Tasman in
1642, and had done it in the most conclusive manner
possible&mdash;by sailing round it&mdash;and thus upset Mr.
Dalrymple's favourite theory that it formed part of a
continent.</p>

<p>In Admiralty Bay, which he entered to refit for the homeward
voyage, the sails were found to require a thorough overhaul, for,
as Banks says, they:</p>

<p>"were ill-provided from the first, and were now worn and damaged
by the rough work they had gone through, particularly on the New
Zealand coast, and they gave no little trouble to get into order
again."</p>

<p>The two points forming the bay were appropriately named after
the Secretaries of the Admiralty, Stephens and Jackson.</p>

<p>The opinion was expressed that European fruits, grain, etc.,
would grow well in New Zealand, and an agricultural population
would be successful. Timber of excellent quality was plentiful, and
it was believed that New Zealand flax promised to be of
considerable commercial value. Fish was found in great quantities,
the lobsters and oysters being specially remarkable for quality and
quantity. No quadrupeds except dogs and rats were seen, and birds
did not seem very plentiful. The minerals, in Cook's opinion, did
not appear of much value, but he admitted that he was not an
authority on the subject. Banks notes the southern islanders
appeared to be an inferior race to those of the north, the latter
probably more closely allied to the Otaheitan type; many of their
customs were similar, and their language practically identical.
Tupia had no difficulty in making himself understood.</p>

<p>It would seem that even at this time founding a colony in the
southern hemisphere had been under discussion, for Cook says that
if a settlement were decided on in New Zealand, he would recommend
the Estuary of the Thames and the Bay of Islands as most suitable
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Speaking of his chart of New Zealand, Cook points out frankly
the places where he thinks he may have fallen into error, and gives
his reasons for so thinking, and the opinions of others are worth
recording.</p>

<p><b>A DULL SAILOR.</b>
</p>

<p>Admiral Wharton says:</p>

<p>"Never has a coast been as well laid down by a first explorer,
and it must have required unceasing vigilance and continual
observation in fair weather and foul, to arrive at such a
satisfactory conclusion, and with such a dull sailor as the
Endeavour was, the six and a half months occupied in the work
(2,400 miles of coast) must be counted as a short interval in which
to do it."</p>

<p>M. Crozet, second to M. Marion du Fresne in command of the
French expedition that was out in the following year, says:</p>

<p>"As soon as I obtained information of the voyage of Cook, I
carefully compared the chart I had prepared of that part of the
coast of New Zealand along which we had coasted, with that prepared
by Captain Cook and his officers. I found it of an exactitude and
of a thoroughness of detail which astonished me beyond all power of
expression. I doubt whether our own coasts of France have been
delineated with more precision. I think therefore that I cannot do
better than to lay down our track of New Zealand on the chart
prepared by the celebrated English navigator."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10. 1770. AUSTRALIA.</h2>

<p>The next thing to be done was to decide the course to be taken
towards England. Cook would have liked to have returned by the Horn
and thus settle the existence or non-existence of a large body of
land in the South Pacific, but the time of year and the condition
of his ship suggested that would be to court disaster. The same
reasons held good against a direct course to the Cape of Good Hope,
with the added disadvantage of there being no probability of any
fresh discoveries, as that part of the Ocean had been frequently
traversed.</p>

<p>"It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies
by the following route. Upon leaving this coast to the Westward
until we fall in with the East coast of New Holland, and then to
follow the direction of that coast to the Northward or what other
direction it might take us, until we arrive at its Northern
extremity; and if it should be found impracticable then to
Endeavour to fall in with the Land or Islands discovered by
Quiros."</p>

<p>This extract from Cook's Journal shows that he made no claim to
the discovery of Australia, and settles the stupid story that his
connection with the discovery of the east coast was an accident. It
was a course laid down after thorough consideration of the best
charts, very poor at best, in his possession.</p>

<p><b>BOTANY BAY.</b>
</p>

<p>The good ship Endeavour got under way on 31st March 1770, with a
favourable wind and clear sky, heading a little north of west. On
the 16th a change in the birds denoted the neighbourhood of land,
and after a touch of contrary wind, on 19th April 1770 Lieutenant
Hicks sighted land extending from north-east to west, distant five
or six leagues. This was the looked-for east coast of New Holland,
and the ship was at the entrance of Bass Straits, but on his chart
Cook shows by a dotted line that he felt uncertain whether van
Diemen's Land was joined to New Holland or no. The low hill which
was first seen was named Point Hicks after its discoverer, and its
position is given as 38 degrees 0 minutes South, 211 degrees 7
minutes West. Three waterspouts were seen a short distance from the
ship, and are remarkable as being the first ones mentioned in the
log. The course was altered to the north, and the country is
described as rather low, not very hilly, covered with green woods,
and the shore of white sand. Cape Howe was named the following day,
and the position fixed as 37 degrees 28 minutes South, 210 degrees
3 minutes West, which Wharton says is almost exact. The country now
appeared to be improving in character, and smoke proved the
existence of inhabitants, but none were visible till Cape Dromedary
and Bateman's Bay were passed, when some were seen on the shore,
but too far away for observation. Cook wished to land at Jervis
Bay, but the wind was against him, and he could not afford time to
beat in. An attempt was unsuccessfully made at a place that has
been identified a little north of Five Islands, near Illawarra, but
the surf was too heavy. At daylight on Sunday, 29th April, a bay
was discovered, and the Master was sent in to sound the entrance,
the ship following closely, and soon the Endeavour anchored for the
first time in Australian waters, about two miles within the
entrance of Sting Ray, now Botany, Bay. (For note see below.) The
time when the name of the Bay was changed has been much disputed,
but it is probable it was done some time after leaving the place.
It was called Sting Ray on account of the big haul of that fish
made soon after their arrival and the name stands in all the logs;
Banks refers to it under that name in a general description of the
country, written when leaving Cape York. Cook is however, decisive,
for under date 6th May he says: "The great quantity of plants Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander found in this place occasioned my giving it
the name of Botany Bay."</p>

<p>On coming to an anchor, Cook, Banks, and Tupia went on shore,
and Canon Bennett, a second cousin of Mrs. Cook's, and one who knew
her personally, relates that the family legend was that on reaching
the shore Cook ordered the midshipman to "Jump out, Isaac," and
Isaac Smith (afterwards Admiral) also a cousin of Mrs. Cook's, was
the first Englishman to set his foot on the soil of New South
Wales. The few natives who were near ran away, excepting two, who
came forward to oppose any landing. A musket was fired over them,
and they retired to where they had left their spears, and then one
threw a stone at the boat, and as they were too far away for any
serious damage to be done, Cook fired a charge of small shot at
him. He then ran off to a small hut near, picked up a wooden
shield, and returned to take up his position alongside his comrade,
and they threw a couple of spears, receiving a second discharge of
small shot in return, which caused them to retire slowly. As Banks,
suspicious of some gummy substance on the points of the spears,
suggested poison, they were not followed up. The huts, found near
the landing-place, were constructed of sticks covered with pieces
of bark somewhat similar to those seen in Tierra del Fuego. Some
children found carefully covered up were left undisturbed, but
forty or fifty spears were taken, and payment in the shape of
beads, cloth, nails, etc., was left, but still untouched, on
visiting the camp the next morning. The canoes from which the
natives were seen fishing are described by Cook as the worst he
ever saw, being merely sheets of bark tied with withies at the end
and kept open in the middle by a stick.</p>

<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining water, and
whilst the crew were procuring it, Cook made a survey of the
harbour. He describes the country as lightly timbered, with a sandy
soil growing a plentiful crop of coarse grass, of which a quantity
was cut for the sheep. The soil was interspersed with rocks and
swamps, but at the head of the bay appeared richer. A few natives
were seen, who ran away when observed, and though one or two spears
were thrown no damage was done to any one. Large heaps of oyster,
mussel, and cockle shells were found, amongst them, says Cook,
"being some of the largest oyster shells I ever saw." An account,
said to have been obtained from the blacks, published in a work on
Australian discovery (anonymous, Sydney), agrees as far as it goes
with those of Cook and Banks, and it is almost unnecessary to say
the ship was at first taken for a large bird.</p>

<p><b>SUTHERLAND'S DEATH.</b>
</p>

<p>Whilst here, a seaman named Forbes (Forby, in the Muster Roll)
Sutherland, died of consumption, from which he had suffered
throughout the voyage, was buried on shore, and the point named
Point Sutherland in his memory. The anonymous pamphlet referred to
above, says that Cook does not give the cause of Sutherland's
death, and that he had been fatally wounded by the blacks whilst
trying to secure a metal plate he had found affixed to a tree,
recording that the Dutch had previously been on the spot. The
pamphlet goes on to say that Cook suppressed these facts in order
to have the credit of being the first discoverer, but that the
plate had been secured by some one and deposited in the British
Museum. Unfortunately, Cook does give the cause of Sutherland's
death, and the plate is not in the British Museum, nor has it ever
been heard of there. Before leaving, an inscription was cut on a
tree near the watering place, giving the ship's name and date; the
English colours were displayed on shore every day during their
stay, but they could not establish any friendly intercourse with
the blacks. A plate has since been attached to the rocks about
fifteen feet above high water, and as near as possible to the
supposed place of landing.</p>

<p>After leaving Botany Bay the coast was followed up to the north,
and Cook noted an "entrance" which he thought might prove a safe
anchorage, to which he gave the name of Port Jackson, after Mr.
George Jackson, one of the Secretaries to the Admiralty. Within
this entrance is now the city of Sydney, and it was to this place
that Captain Phillip removed his headquarters when he had
discovered the unsuitability of Botany Bay for settlement. Broken
Bay, named from the number of small islands therein, was passed,
and the voyage was rendered very slow by the light northerly winds,
and passing Cape Hawke, he found the set of the current had placed
him twelve miles in advance, when reckoned by the log, of his real
position given by observation.</p>

<p>Almost the only thing to be seen beyond the outline of the coast
was the constantly recurring smoke; one point received the name of
Smoky Cape on account of the great quantity seen in its vicinity.
Cook, of course, was unaware that these "smokes" were probably,
many of them, signals from one party of blacks to another of the
arrival of something strange on the coast. That these "smokes" are
used by the blacks as a means of communication is a well recognised
fact, and the news they can convey by this means is perfectly
astonishing to a white man.</p>

<p>The country appeared to increase in height with:</p>

<p>"an agreeable variety of Hills, Ridges, and Valleys, and large
plains all clothed with wood, which to all appearance is the same
as I have before mentioned as we could discover no visible
difference in the soil."</p>

<p>After escaping a reef off Point Danger they discovered a bay,
which Cook called Morton Bay after the Earl of Morton, P.R.S.; now
wrongly spelt as Moreton Bay. Here, from the colour of the water,
they supposed a river emptied into the sea; the surmise was
correct, for they were at the mouth of the Brisbane River. At the
same time some curiously-shaped hills were given the name of the
Glasshouses, from their resemblance to the buildings in which glass
is manufactured, and the resemblance is most striking.</p>

<p>After rounding Breaksea Spit, Cook found himself in a large bay,
and conjectured, from the birds and the direction of their flight,
that there was fresh water to the south-west; and rightly, for here
the Mary River enters Hervey's Bay. On 23rd May they landed for the
second time, and Cook says this was "visibly worse than the last
place," that is Botany Bay. They managed to shoot a bustard of
17&frac12; pounds, and Banks says it was "as large as a good
turkey, and far the best we had eaten since we left England." It
was so much appreciated that its name was conferred on Bustard Head
and Bustard Bay. This bird is known in Australia as the Plain
Turkey. Oysters of good quality were also obtained, and Banks made
the personal acquaintance of the green tree ant and the Australian
mosquito, neither of which were appreciated.</p>

<p><b>CAPE CAPRICORN.</b>
</p>

<p>On 24th May a moderately high, white, barren-looking point was
passed, which being found by observation to be directly under the
tropic was named Cape Capricorn, and soon after the mouth of the
Fitzroy was crossed, with the remark from Cook that from general
appearances he believed there was a river in the immediate
vicinity. Soundings becoming very irregular, he ran out between the
Keppel Islands, on one of which natives were seen. Cape Townshend
was named after Charles Townshend, one of the Lords of the
Admiralty when the Endeavour left England, and not the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, as stated by Wharton.</p>

<p>Rounding the point into Shoalwater Bay they had to haul sharp up
to the west to get within the Northumberland Islands, and the water
was found to be so shallow that they anchored and sounded from the
boats, gradually working nearer in, as Cook was anxious to clean
the ship's bottom, which was very foul; and he desired to take
advantage of the full moon in these dangerous waters. They landed
to take some observations and look for water. The observations were
unsatisfactory, for the compass was unreliable, a fault attributed
to the ironstone in the neighbourhood, of which signs were very
evident, and water was not to be found. The country is reported on
as follows: "No signs of fertility is to be seen upon the Land; the
soil of the uplands is mostly a hard, reddish clay."</p>

<p>Passing Cape Hillsborough, they entered Whitsunday Passage,
described by Cook as "one continued safe harbour, besides a number
of small bays and coves on each side, where ships might lay as it
were in a Basin." The land on both sides was green and
pleasant-looking, but on account of the moonlight Cook could not
waste any time in landing.</p>

<p>Entering Cleveland Bay, the compass was again very much
disturbed; the cause was found to be Magnetical, now Magnetic,
Island, lying just off the present Port of Townsville. Blacks were
seen, near Rockingham Bay, through the glasses; they were said to
be very dark and destitute of clothing, but no communication with
them was possible.</p>

<p><b>ON THE ROCKS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 10th June, after leaving a small bay north of Cape Grafton,
where they had searched in vain for a watering place, the watch had
just turned in, the lead had been cast and given seventeen fathoms,
when the unfortunate ship brought all hands on deck, with a crash
on a sunken rock. Soundings taken all round showed her to be on the
very edge of a coral reef. Making but little water, an attempt was
made to warp her off, but unsuccessfully. Steps were then taken to
lighten her; decayed stores, oil jars, staves, casks, ballast, and
her six quarter-deck guns were thrown overboard, some forty to
fifty tons, but with no effect. The tide now rising, the leaks
increased rapidly, two pumps being kept constantly at work.
Thinking things could only go from bad to worse, Cook determined to
heave her off at all hazards, and every one who could be spared
from the pumps was sent to the capstan or windlass, and at length,
after a stay of twenty-three hours on the rocks, she was hove into
deep water. Now, however, it was a case of all hands to the pumps,
and for a time it seemed as if they were slowly gaining on the
in-rushing water, but suddenly there was an increase reported in
the well, casting a shadow of gloom over all, but not for an
instant staying the steady beat of the pumps. Shortly it was
discovered that a fresh hand had been sent to the well and had
sounded from a different mark than his predecessor, accounting for
the sixteen to eighteen inches difference in the depth of water
reported. This discovery acted like a charm: each one redoubled his
exertions, and by morning they had gained considerably on the leak,
so sail was made, and they slowly crawled in towards the land.</p>

<p>Midshipman Monkhouse had been on a ship which was leaking at the
rate of forty-eight inches per hour, and had seen the operation
called "fothering" so successfully performed on her, that, without
further repair, she had sailed from Virginia to London. This being
brought to Cook's ear, he gave Monkhouse the charge of carrying out
a similar experiment. A studding sail was taken, on which oakum and
wool was lightly sewn and smothered with dirt; it was then lowered
over the bows and dragged by ropes over the place where the worst
of the leak was situated, and there secured, with the result,
according to Banks, that in a quarter of an hour after it was in
position they were able to pump the ship clear, and Cook says one
pump was sufficient to keep her free.</p>

<p>Of the conduct of the crew, Cook says:</p>

<p>"In justice to the ship's company, I must say that no men ever
behaved better than they have done on this occasion; animated by
the behaviour of every Gentleman on board, every man seem'd to have
a just sense of the Danger we were in, and exerted himself to the
very utmost."</p>

<p>Banks adds his testimony:</p>

<p>"Every man exerts his utmost for the preservation of the ship.
The officers during the whole time never gave an order that did not
show them to be perfectly composed and unmoved by the
circumstances, however dreadful they might appear."</p>

<p>A point off which the reef was situated was given the suggestive
name of Cape Tribulation, and some small islands near, Hope
Islands, because, as Cook says, he hoped, at the time of their
greatest danger, they might be able to reach them. What a prospect
to hope for! No possibility of ever seeing a friendly sail, and but
little probability of ever being able to reach a civilised
port.</p>

<p><b>THE ENDEAVOUR RIVER.</b>
</p>

<p>A boat sent off to search for some spot where temporary repairs
could be executed, soon returned and reported a small river had
been found which appeared suitable. This was the Endeavour River,
and into it the ship was safely taken, and deep water being found
close to the bank, a stage was rigged, and most of the stores and
ballast were taken on shore; a hospital was erected for the sick,
"which amounted at this time to some eight or nine afflicted with
different disorders, but none very dangerously ill." Green and
Tupia were showing symptoms of scurvy, but the remainder appear to
have been free from it.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was sufficiently lightened she was warped a
little further up the river, and at the top of the tide her bows
were hauled well into the bank, so that when the tide fell they
were able to examine the leak. The damage was found to be very
serious; the rock had cut through four planks into the timbers, and
three other planks had been badly injured. The manner in which the
ship had been injured was "hardy credible, scarce a splinter was to
be seen, but the whole was cut away as if done with a blunt-edged
tool." A piece of the rock was found wedged in the hole, and had
greatly assisted in arresting the influx of water. The sheathing
and false keel were very badly damaged, but it was believed that
she was not much injured aft, as she made but little water when
once the main wound was dry.</p>

<p>At what is believed to be the exact spot at which the Endeavour
was beached, a monument has been erected by the inhabitants of
Cooktown, a seaport now at the mouth of the river.</p>

<p>There being no danger from the natives the crew were allowed as
much liberty as possible, and a good supply of fish, a few pigeons
and a small quantity of vegetables, in the shape of yam tops,
cabbage palm, and wild plantains, had a very beneficial effect on
their health. The longitude was calculated from an observation of
"the Emersion of Jupiter's First Satelite," as 214 degrees 42
minutes 30 seconds West, which Wharton remarks on as being an
excellent observation, the true longitude being 214 degrees 45
minutes West.</p>

<p><b>INCENDIARISM BY BLACKS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 4th July the good ship was afloat again, so well repaired
that only about an inch of water per hour was taken in, easily kept
under by the pumps. She was laid over on a sandbank on the opposite
side of the river and more carefully examined, the sheathing being
found to be very badly damaged. The carpenter, in whom Cook had
every confidence, reported that, with the means at his disposal, he
could not make a satisfactory job, but he thought they might push
on to some place where greater facilities could be obtained. She
was therefore taken alongside the staging, the stores and ballast
replaced, everything got ready for the prosecution of the voyage,
and the Master sent off in the pinnace to look for a passage to the
north-east; but was unsuccessful. He was again sent out, but again
reported badly; the shoals appeared to get worse the further he
went. He, however, brought back with him three turtles weighing
about 800 pounds, which were most welcome as the crew had now been
some months without fresh meat; a second trip to where these were
caught resulted in getting three or four more, and a large supply
of shell-fish. They had made several attempts to get on good terms
with the few natives they had seen, and on one occasion two or
three who were fishing had a long and animated conversation with
Tupia, in which neither party could understand the other, though
one or two were persuaded to visit the camp. Shortly before the
last of the stores were taken in, Cook and Banks received friendly
overtures from a small party, and ten of them visited the ship.
They were offered various gifts, but seemed to set little value on
anything except the turtles. They made signs they wanted them, and
when they found these signs ignored, attempted to carry off two,
and when their aim was frustrated, went ashore to where some of the
crew were at work. One of them took a lighted stick from under the
pitch kettle, and, making a wide circuit round the place, fired the
grass as he ran. Fortunately there were not many things left
ashore, and the powder had just been safely got on board, so the
most serious damage appears to have been the premature roasting of
a young pig. They then went off to where others of the crew were
washing, and drying the fishing nets, and another attempt was made
to burn the grass; but a charge of small shot caused a retreat, and
on their way they set fire to the undergrowth to cover their
repulse. Banks was greatly impressed with the manner in which the
grass and undergrowth burnt, and declared he would never pitch
tents again without first burning the grass for some distance
round.</p>

<p>Gore, Banks, and three men made a few days' excursion up the
river, but, with the exception of a kangaroo being shot by Gore,
the first ever killed by a European, they met with nothing worth
noting. On 18th July Cook, Banks, and Solander went up a hill some
six or eight miles along the coast to see if they could form any
idea of the general run of the coast and the surrounding reefs, and
Cook says: "In whatever direction we looked, it [the sea] was
covered with shoals as far as the eye could see."</p>

<p>Before leaving the river, Banks gives some notes as to the
country, and puts it down as "in every respect the most barren
country we have yet seen." The animals were not numerous; he gives
kangaroo, wolf (the dingo or native dog), bats (flying foxes), wild
cats (dasyurus), and opossums. Amongst the birds, several kinds of
duck, shags, pelicans, crows, and flock pigeons, all, with the
exception of the last, difficult to shoot. Of the crow he says: "A
crow in England though in general sufficiently wary is, I must say,
a fool to a New Holland crow." None of the beasts or birds seem to
have come amiss to the pot; all that was necessary was the meat
should not be salt, "that alone was sufficient to make it a
delicacy." He quotes the description given by a sailor of an animal
he saw:</p>

<p>"It was as black as the devil and had wings, indeed I took it
for the devil, or I might have catched it, for it crawled away very
slowly through the grass."</p>

<p>After some little trouble Banks discovered this to have been a
large bat (flying fox). Of the insect life seen, he was
particularly struck by the white ants and their nests, and formed a
very respectful opinion of the mosquito.</p>

<p>Cook's opinion agrees fairly well with that of Banks, but on the
whole he thought the east coast was not so barren and desolate as
Dampier had described the west coast, and adds:</p>

<p>"We are to consider that we see this country in the pure state
of nature; the Industry of Man has had nothing to do with any part
of it, and yet we find all such things as Nature hath bestowed upon
it, in a flourishing state. In this Extensive Country, it can never
be doubted, but what most sorts of grain, Fruit, roots, etc., of
every kind would flourish here were they once brought hither,
planted and cultivated by the hands of Industry; and here are
provender for more cattle, at all seasons of the year, than ever
can be brought into the country."</p>

<p>This is a fair example of the observations and deductions to be
found scattered through Cook's Journals, and an improvement on the
would-be scientific and classical rubbish put into his mouth by his
editors.</p>

<p><b>A MASTHEAD WATCH.</b>
</p>

<p>At last, on 4th August, they got away from the Endeavour River,
only to find themselves surrounded by difficulties. Cook or one of
the other officers was continually at the masthead on the look-out,
and at length, by keeping very close in shore, they managed to
creep past Cape Flattery, and thought the worst was over, but a
landing at Point Lookout showed a very unsatisfactory prospect. In
hopes of getting a better view Cook went out to Lizard Island, and
from there could see, far away to the east, the white breakers on
the Great Barrier Reef. This island, on which the only living
things to be seen were lizards, they found, from the large piles of
shells and remains of fires, was visited periodically by the
blacks; a remarkable voyage for their miserable canoes.</p>

<p>Having only three months' supplies at short allowance left,
Cook, after a consultation with his officers, made out through an
opening in the Barrier Reef that he had seen from Lizard Island,
and observes:</p>

<p>"Having been entangled among Islands and Shoals more or less
ever since the 26th May, in which time we have sailed 360 leagues
by the Lead, without ever having a Leadsman out of the chains, when
the ship was under sail, a Circumstance that perhaps never happened
to any ship before, and yet it was here absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>But their satisfaction in getting outside was diminished when it
was found that the increased working of the ship's timbers
necessitated the continual use of one pump.</p>

<p>Cook was afraid that being forced outside the Barrier Reef he
would be unable to put to the proof the opinion he had formed that
New Guinea and New Holland were not joined. He did not know till
after his return to England, that the point had already been
settled in 1606, by Louis Vaez de Torres, and he readily yields the
honour of the discovery in the Introduction to his Second Voyage.
The log of Torres's voyage was lost for many years, and was found
at Manilla, when that place was taken by Admiral Cornish in 1762.
Cook had with him a copy of De Brye's Voyages, published in 1756,
which contained three charts that he found to be "tolerably good"
with regard to New Guinea, and he evidently formed the opinion that
both the Spaniards and the Dutch had circumnavigated that
island.</p>

<p>"I always understood, before I had a sight of these maps, that
it was unknown whether or no New Holland and New Guinea was one
continued land, and so it is said in the very History of Voyages
these maps are bound up in. However, we have now put this wholly
out of dispute; but as I believe it was known before, but not
publickly, I claim no other merit than the clearing up of a
doubtful point."</p>

<p>With this question of New Guinea and New Holland in view, he
again made to the west, sighting the Barrier again on 15th August,
and on the following morning, the wind having changed in the night,
the breakers were heard very distinctly. The lead gave no bottom at
140 fathoms, but at daybreak the reef was not a mile away, and they
found themselves in a dead calm, rapidly drifting with the current
towards the breakers. The yawl and long-boat were got out, the
pinnace being under repair, and the sweeps were used from the
gun-room ports. By six o'clock she was heading north again,
but:</p>

<p>"not above 80 or 100 yards from the breakers. The same sea that
washed the side of the ship rose in a breaker prodigiously high the
very next time it did rise, so that between us and destruction was
only a dismal valley, the breadth of one wave, and even now no
ground could be felt with 120 fathoms."</p>

<p><b>A PERILOUS POSITION.</b>
</p>

<p>The carpenter had by this time fastened a temporary streak on
the pinnace, and it was sent off to assist in towing. Cook had
almost given up hope, but he says:</p>

<p>"In this truly terrible situation, not one man ceased to do his
utmost, and that with as much calmness as if no danger had been
near."</p>

<p>Admiral Wharton draws special attention to the fact that in the
very height of the danger, Green, Charles Clerke, and Forwood, the
gunner, were engaged in taking a Lunar for the longitude. Green
notes:</p>

<p>"These observations were very good, the limbs of the sun and
moon very distinct, and a good horizon. We were about 100 yards
from the reef, where we expected the ship to strike every minute,
it being calm, no soundings, and the swell heaving us right
on."</p>

<p>When things seemed perfectly hopeless, a small breath of air,
"so small that at any other time in a calm we should not have
observed it," came, and every advantage being taken, the distance
from the reef was slightly increased, but then again it fell calm.
A small opening of the reef was seen and an attempt was made to
push through, but the ebb tide was found to be "gushing out like a
mill stream." Advantage was taken of this, and they succeeded in
getting about a quarter of a mile away, but the current was so
narrow they soon lost it. A second opening was seen, and, the tide
having changed, they were carried rapidly through Providential
Channel and safely anchored in nineteen fathoms of water. Cook
says:</p>

<p>"It is but a few days ago that I rejoiced at having got without
the Reef, but that joy was nothing when compared to what I now felt
at being safe at an anchor within it."</p>

<p>Having arrived at a place of safety, Cook resolved to remain
till he had his boats in thorough repair and had made a complete
study of his difficulties. From the masthead it appeared as if the
shoals and reefs offered less obstruction than he had previously
towards the north, and he hoped, by keeping as close to the shore
as possible, to be able to solve the problem of the passage between
New Guinea and New Holland. At this place, boats that had been out
fishing brought back a sort of cockle, some requiring two men to
lift them, and containing "as much as twenty pounds of good
wholesome meat."</p>

<p><b>TAKE POSSESSION.</b>
</p>

<p>Proceeding slowly through a network of reefs, shoals, and
islands, the boats always sounding ahead, he had the satisfaction
of passing the straits between Cape York and New Guinea, leaving
Torres's track considerably to the north. On getting clear of the
straits, they landed for the last time in Australian waters, and
hoisting the English flag:</p>

<p>"took possession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above
latitude (38 degrees 0 minutes South) down to this place by the
name of New Wales. We fired three volleys of small arms, which were
answer'd by the like number from the ship."</p>

<p>Admiral Wharton says that in the King's and the Admiralty's
copies of Cook's Journal the name is given as New South Wales, and
in a letter written to Mr. John Walker, of Whitby, dated 13th
September 1771, Cook says: "The East coast of New Holland, or what
I call New South Wales."</p>

<p>After a narrow escape of running on a reef near Booby Island,
from which they were only saved by letting go the anchors with all
sails set, they left the difficulties of the New Holland coast
behind and sighted New Guinea on 29th August.</p>

<p><b>*</b>

<p><b>FOOTNOTE: STING RAY BAY.</b>
</p>

<p>"The great number of New Plants, etc., our Gentlemen Botanists
have collected in this place occasion'd my giving in [sic] the Name
of Botanist Bay."</p>

<p>Extract from the only page known to exist of the Journal of the
first voyage written by Cook, and dated 6th May, 1770. It was, July
1911, purchased by Mr. F.T. Sabin for &pound;451.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11. 1770 TO 1771. NEW GUINEA TO ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>The water on the New Guinea coast was very shallow, and kept
them far out in running westward, but on 3rd September they got a
little nearer in, so Cook decided to attempt a landing, and then to
leave, as he considered it was only wasting valuable time to go
over ground that had already been explored by the Dutch. Banks says
the crew were rather sickly, they:</p>

<p>"were pretty far gone with the longing for home, which the
physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name
of Nostalgia. Indeed, I can find hardly anybody in the ship clear
of its effects, but the Captain, Dr. Solander, and myself, and we
three have ample constant employment for our minds, which I believe
to be the best if not the only remedy for it."</p>

<p>They were also on short allowance of food, which would
necessarily have a depressing effect, and when they learnt that
Cook would return to civilisation where fresh supplies could be
obtained, there was a marked improvement in the general health.</p>

<p>Calling in at the island of Savu, some supplies were obtained,
and the country is described as very lovely, although there had
been no rain for seven months; the contrast with the monotonous and
barren-looking country of New Holland was very marked.</p>

<p><b>AT BATAVIA.</b>
</p>

<p>According to strict orders from the Admiralty, Cook on 30th
September collected all logs and journals that had been kept on
board the ship, and enjoined every one that they were on no account
to divulge where they had been on their arrival at Batavia. Off
Java Head the main topsail was split in a squall, and Cook remarks
that all his sails are now in such a condition that "they will
hardly stand the least puff of wind." No observations had been
possible since leaving Savu, and the strong western current had
thrown out their dead reckoning, causing them to run past the
Straits of Sunda; but, picking themselves up on 1st October, they
got into the straits, and after a wearisome beat up arrived in
Batavia on the 10th; and Hicks was sent on shore to announce their
arrival, and offer an apology for failing to salute the Dutch flag
in a proper manner&mdash;the reason being that they had only three
guns available.</p>

<p>The ship was thoroughly surveyed, and on the carpenter's report,
Cook applied to the Governor for a convenient place in which to
heave down and repair, and for permission to purchase such stores
as might be necessary. Every assistance was promised, and on Cook's
finding a difficulty in getting any private person to cash the
bills he would have to draw for his expenses, the Governor ordered
the officer in charge of the port to supply whatever amount might
be necessary.</p>

<p>During a heavy thunderstorm on the 12th, a Dutch East Indiaman,
about two cables away from the Endeavour, had mainmast "split all
to shivers." The Endeavour was also struck:</p>

<p>"and in all probability we should have shared the same fate as
the Dutchman, had it not been for the electric chain which we had
but just before got up; this carried the Lightning or Electrical
matter over the side clear of the ship."</p>

<p>On 25th October Cook reopened communication with the Admiralty,
forwarding to Mr. Stephens, by the Dutch East Indiaman Kronenberg,
Captain F. Kelgar, a packet containing a copy of his Journal (sold
to Mr. John Corner in 1890), charts of the South Seas, New Zealand,
and the East Coast of Australia. He also wrote a letter giving an
outline of his voyage up to date, and concludes:</p>

<p>"In this Journal, I have with undisguised Truth and without
gloss, inserted the whole transactions of the Voyage, and made such
remarks and have given such descriptions of things as I thought was
necessary, in the best manner I was capable of. Although the
discoverys made in the Voyage are not great, yet I flatter myself
they are such as may merit the Attention of their Lordships, and
altho' I have failed in discovering the so much talked of Southern
Continent (which perhaps do not exist), and which I myself had much
at heart, yet I am confident that no part of the failure of such
discovery can be laid to my charge. Had we been so fortunate not to
have run ashore, much more would have been done in the latter part
of the Voyage than what was, but as it is, I presume this Voyage
will be found as compleat as any before made to the South Seas on
the same account."</p>

<p><b>PRAISES HIS CREW.</b>
</p>

<p>"The plans I have drawn of the places I have been at, were made
with all the care and accuracy that Time and Circumstances would
admit of. Thus far I am certain that the Latitude and Longitude of
few parts of the World are better settled than these, in this I was
very much assisted by Mr. Green, who let slip no one opportunity
for making observations for settling the Longitude during the whole
course of the Voyage, and the many valuable discoverys made by Mr.
Banks and Dr. Solander in Natural History and other things useful
to the learned World, cannot fail of contributing very much to the
success of the Voyage. In justice to the officers and the whole of
the crew, I must say, they have gone through the fatigues and
dangers of the Whole Voyage with that cheerfulness and alertness
that will always do honour to the British Seamen, and I have the
satisfaction to say that I have not lost one man by Sickness during
the whole Voyage. I hope that the repairs wanting to the Ship will
not be so great as to detain us any length of time; You may be
assured that I shall make no unnecessary delay either here or at
any other place, but shall make the best of my way home."</p>

<p>Banks, too, notes that there were no sick on board, and
contrasts the rosy, healthy appearance of the crew with the pallid
faces of the Europeans of Batavia. But on 26th October a series of
disastrous entries commence in the Journal.</p>

<p>"Set up the ship's tents for the reception of the ship's
company, several of them begin to be taken ill, owing as I suppose
to the extream hot weather."</p>

<p>Batavia had an ill-omened reputation, and it has been estimated
that from 1735 to 1755 no less than 1,000,000 deaths took place,
chiefly from malarial fever and dysentery, and Cook had soon cause
to regret that the Dutch had undertaken the repairs of the ship,
leaving his men to look on. He knew well the evil effects of want
of occupation in such a climate, though he could not guess what it
was to cost him. Up to this time he had only seven deaths to record
since leaving Plymouth; three from drowning, two frozen (Mr.
Banks's servants), one consumption, and one alcoholic poisoning:
probably a record never equalled in the history of navigation. On
5th November Mr. Monkhouse, the surgeon, died, and Cook, Banks, and
Solander were very ill. The two last went up into the hills, but
Cook would not leave his ship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the repairs went on; the ship was found to be worse
than had been expected; two planks and a half had been rasped by
the rocks to the thickness of one eighth of an inch for a distance
of six feet:</p>

<p>"and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers,
so that it was a matter of surprise to every one who saw her
bottom, how we had kept her above water, and yet in this condition
we had sailed some hundreds of leagues in as dangerous a navigation
as in any part of the world, happy in being ignorant of the
continual danger we were in."</p>

<p>By the 14th her bottom was thoroughly repaired, and Cook speaks
highly of the Dutch workmen:</p>

<p>"I do not believe there is a Marine Yard in the World where work
is done with more alertness than here, or where there are better
conveniences for heaving ships down, both in point of safety and
Despatch."</p>

<p>The water, a perquisite of the Commodore of the Dutch East
Indian fleet, was very unsatisfactory, and was found to keep very
badly at sea, although its keeping properties had been loudly
vaunted by the Commodore. Cook was present at his appointment:</p>

<p>"one of the grandest sights Batavia afforded; that may be too,
and yet it did not recompense us for our trouble. I thought that
the whole was but ill conducted, and the fleet appeared to be very
badly mann'd."</p>

<p>A seaman who had run from a Dutch ship entered on the Endeavour,
was claimed by the Dutch on the grounds that he was a Dane from
Elsinore. Cook promised he should be given up if he proved not to
be a British subject, and enquiry by Mr. Hicks resulted in a report
to the Governor that he was an Irishman, so the matter dropped. His
name was James Marra, and he will be again met with as gunner's
mate on the Resolution.</p>

<p><b>DEATH OF TUPIA.</b>
</p>

<p>Before leaving Batavia there had been seven deaths, including
Mr. Reynolds, artist, and Tupia and his boy servant, and Cook gives
the number of sick as "forty or more." Hoping the sea breezes might
have a beneficial effect, preparations were hurried forward, and
they managed to leave the day after Christmas Day, being duly
saluted by the garrison with fourteen guns, and the Earl of Elgin
with thirteen guns and three cheers, "all of which we
return'd."</p>

<p>Calling at Prince's Island in the straits of Sunda, where some
of the Batavian water was replaced by better, the sailors were
allowed to purchase whatever they fancied in hopes of diminishing
the dysentery which was rampant. Every precaution that could be
thought of was tried, but in vain. Mr. Banks lost Messrs. Sporing
and Parkinson, and on 29th January Mr. Green died; he had been long
ill, but Cook says he would not take proper care of himself. To
judge from his own Journal, he must have been rather a difficult
man to get on with, but his services as observer were invaluable,
and he at all times and seasons was devoted to his special duty:
indeed, at times he appears to have thought that every other work
should give way to his. It is a somewhat suggestive fact that Banks
hardly makes any reference to Mr. Green throughout his Journal. On
27th February the terrible list of losses was closed by the deaths
of three of the crew, making in all thirty deaths since their
arrival at Batavia.</p>

<p>It was afterwards discovered that the season in Batavia had been
unusually unhealthy, and several ships that had called in there had
to report heavy losses. Cook says:</p>

<p>"Thus we find that ships which have been little more than twelve
months from England have suffer'd as much or more by sickness than
we have done, who have been out near three times as long. Yet their
sufferings will hardly, if at all, be mentioned or known in
England; when, on the other hand, those of the Endeavour, because
her voyage is uncommon, will very probably be mentioned in every
News Paper, and, what is not unlikely, with Additional hardships we
never Experienced; for such are the dispositions of men in general
in these Voyages, that they are seldom content with the Hardships
and Dangers which will naturally occur, but they must add others
which hardly ever had existence but in their imaginations, by
magnifying the most Trifling accidents and Circumstances to the
greatest Hardships, and unsurmountable Dangers without the
immediate interposition of Providence, as if the whole merit of the
Voyages consisted in the real dangers and Hardships they underwent,
or that the real ones did not happen often enough to give the mind
sufficient anxiety. Thus Posterity are taught to look upon these
Voyages as hazardous to the highest degree."</p>

<p><b>AT THE CAPE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 6th March land was sighted at daylight, about two leagues
away, near Cape Natal, and on the 15th the Cape of Good Hope was
seen. The first thing to be done was to provide shelter ashore for
his sick, of whom he landed twenty-eight, and during the stay the
remainder of the crew were given every possible opportunity of
being on land, as Cook recognised the value of an entire change of
life in shaking off the remnants of sickness. He lost three more of
his men here, and hearing from a Dutch ship just in from Europe
that war was threatening between England and Spain, he hurried up
his preparations for departure and got all his men on board, though
some were still very ill. In addition he managed to enter some
half-dozen men for the voyage home.</p>

<p>In writing of the Cape, Cook draws attention to the fact:</p>

<p>"that a stranger is at once struck with surprise and
disappointment, for no country we have seen this voyage affords so
barren a prospect as this, and not only so in appearance but in
reality."</p>

<p>Then further on he says:</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the many disadvantages this country labours
under, such is the industry, economy, and good management of the
Dutch, that not only the necessary, but all the Luxuries of Life
are raised here in great abundance, and are sold as cheap, if not
cheaper, than in any part of Europe, some few articles
excepted."</p>

<p>On the other hand, he complains of the exorbitant charges made
by the Dutch East India Company for naval stores. As at Batavia,
they were sold at a certain fixed price from which there was no
deviation.</p>

<p>Calling in at St. Helena, they found H.M.Ss. Portland and
Swallow, with a convoy, in the roads, and received some few
much-needed stores from them, together with the information that
all danger of war between Spain and England was over. They all
sailed in company on 5th May, but after a few days Cook explained
to Captain Elliott, of the Portland, who had come on board the
Endeavour, that his ship, sails, and rigging were naturally not in
very good order after his lengthy voyage, and therefore he should
probably be unable to keep up with the other ships. He requested
the Portland to take charge of letters, charts, and journals for
the Admiralty. These papers only arrived in England three days in
advance of the Endeavour. For some days the good Bark kept within
easy reach of the fleet, and was able to obtain extra medical
advice for Mr. Hicks, who was suffering from consumption when he
left England, but had held out well till stricken with the Batavian
fever, when he gradually sank and died on 25th May; Mr. Charles
Clerke was appointed third lieutenant, in place of Mr. Gore,
promoted. Since leaving the Cape they had also lost their Master,
Mr. Molineaux, of whose intelligence Cook speaks very highly, but
deplores his want of steadiness, the true cause of his early death.
Mr. Pickersgill was appointed to the vacancy.</p>

<p><b>ANCHOR IN THE DOWNS.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 21st June they were still in sight of some of the convoy,
but during the night they had their main topgallant sail split, and
the topmast sprung, in a heavy squall; in fact, their gear was in
such a bad state that something gave way daily. On 7th July they
spoke a brig from London, three days out from Scilly, and learnt
that no account of their proceedings had yet been made public, and
that wagers were being laid that the Endeavour was lost. On 10th
July Nicholas Young, who had sighted New Zealand, sighted the
Land's End, and the Lizard was seen the next day. On Saturday, 13th
July 1771, "at 3 o'clock in the P.M. anchor'd in the Downs and soon
after I landed in order to repair to London."</p>

<p>Before leaving, Cook wrote to Mr. Stephens informing him of his
arrival, and announcing that he was coming up to the Admiralty to
lay before their Lordships a full account of the whole voyage, and
that the ship was to await further orders. He hopes that the
appointments that he has made will meet with approval, and requests
that his charts, plans, and drawings may be laid before the
authorities.</p>

<p>On 2nd August, Stephens wrote to him at Mile End, saying he had
received the papers sent from Batavia, those by the Portland and
those from the Downs, and that they had been laid before their
Lordships. He goes on:</p>

<p>"I have the pleasure to acquaint you that their Lordships
extremely well approve of the whole of your proceedings and that
they have great satisfaction in the account you have given them of
the good behaviour of your officers and men and of the cheerfulness
and alertness with which they went through the fatigues and dangers
of their late Voyage."</p>

<p>He also notifies at the same time that the appointments made
have all been confirmed.</p>

<p>Cook himself was appointed Commander of the Scorpion on 29th
August, but owing to other arrangements being made did not put in
an appearance on his new ship. Isaac Smith and Isaac Manly were
appointed respectively Master's mate and midshipman, taking part in
the Second Voyage, being too young for further promotion.</p>

<p>The newspapers, of course, blossomed out into paragraphs on the
subject of the voyage, more or less correct, and Bingley's Journal
on 23rd July stated:</p>

<p>"In consequence of this discovery, more ships will be destined
in search of this new terrestrial acquisition."</p>

<p>Evidently it was quickly decided that Cook's rest was to be
short. On 27th the same Journal says:</p>

<p>"His Majesty's Ship, the Endeavour, which is lately arrived in
the River from the East Indies, lost by the unhealthiness of the
climate, 70 of her hands, tho' they were picked men, and had been
several times in the Indies. However, those who survive will have
made their fortunes by traffic, having brought home some of the
richest goods made in the east, which they are suffered to dispose
of without the inspection of the Custom House officers. This, our
correspondent says, is allowed them by the Government as a reward
for their hard and dangerous service during a voyage of three
years."</p>

<p>The amount of the "richest goods made in the East" obtained from
New Zealand, Australia, and Otaheite would be but a poor reward for
three years' strenuous service; and Cook here finds his premonition
as to his losses being exaggerated, only too true.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the number of punishments throughout
the voyage was remarkably small, those entered in the ship's log
being twenty-one, and the heaviest sentence, two dozen lashes for
theft. In one case, that of Mathew Cox, A.B., for disobedience and
mutinous conduct, the culprit proceeded civilly against Cook, on
arrival in England, and the Admiralty solicitors were instructed to
defend. The case was probably allowed to drop, as no result can be
found.</p>

<p><b>LAST OF THE ENDEAVOUR.</b>
</p>

<p>The good ship which had so bravely borne her part, was not given
much rest; but after being paid off at Woolwich, was despatched,
under lieutenant James Gordon, to the Falkland Islands on 16th
October, and returned with "perishable and unserviceable" stores;
in 1772 and 1773 she again made voyages to the same destination,
the last one to bring away the garrison and stores, as those
islands were to be handed over to Spain. She was paid off at
Woolwich in September 1774, and shortly afterwards was sold out of
the Navy for the sum of &pound;645. She is then believed to have
been employed as a collier in the North Seas. Mr. Gibbs, of the
firm of Gibbs and Canning of Newport, Rhode Island, one day pointed
out to the English Consul the remains of an old vessel falling into
decay, and informed him that it was Captain Cook's ship, the
Endeavour. His story was that the French Government being anxious
to compete with England in the whale fishery, offered a bounty to
the ships in that trade sailing under the French flag. A Mr. Hayden
purchased the old ship from a Dunkirk firm and re-christened her La
Liberte, loaded her with oil and consigned her, under French
colours, to Gibbs and Canning at Newport. She was chased by an
English ship, but escaped, and after laying alongside a wharf for
some months received a cargo, but running aground in trying to
leave the harbour, she was found in such a bad condition that she
was allowed to remain to drop to pieces. Enquiries into this story
gave satisfactory results, and a box made from her timbers was
presented to J. Fennimore Cooper, the American author, with letters
authenticating, as far as possible, the vessel from which the wood
had been taken. Miss Cooper mentions this box in her preface to her
father's Red Rover, and several other relics of the old ship are
still to be found in the neighbourhood of Newport.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12. 1771. PREPARATIONS FOR SECOND VOYAGE.</h2>

<p>After reporting himself to the Admiralty on his arrival in
England, Cook proceeded to his home at Mile End Old Town, where he
was for some time employed in completing his Charts and Journals,
and on 14th August, the Annual Register announces, he was
introduced to His Majesty at St. James's, when he:</p>

<p>"presented his Journal of his Voyage, with some curious maps and
charts of different places that he had drawn during the voyage; he
was presented with a captain's commission."</p>

<p>He also found time to write two long and instructive letters to
his old master and good friend, Mr. John Walker of Whitby, which
are to be found in Dr. Young's work. They give a rapid glance at
the different places visited, with a few pithy remarks as to their
peoples and productions; mention the pleasing reception he had from
the king, and he alludes to the probability of being despatched on
a second voyage with two ships.</p>

<p>Edgeworth, in his Memoirs, states that about this time Cook was
a frequent visitor at Denham Place, the home of Mr. Louis Way,
F.R.S., but as that gentleman died in this year, and Edgeworth also
refers to events of a later date as occurring at the same time, it
is more probable that these visits were paid after the Second
Voyage to Mr. Benjamin Way, also F.R.S., and a Director of the
South Sea Company. In another place Edgeworth infers that Banks,
Solander, and Cook were members of a club which met at Slaughter's
Coffee House in 1765. Of course, this is an error, for Cook was
then engaged in Newfoundland, and unknown to the Royal Society,
whose members composed the club spoken of; in fact, Cook, though a
frequent guest in after times, was never a member of the Royal
Societies Club.</p>

<p>Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay) says that in September her
father, Dr. Charles Burney, spent a few days at Hinchinbroke, Lord
Sandwich's place, in order to meet Cook, Banks, and Solander, and
it is evident that the second voyage had been resolved on, for Dr.
Burney's son, James, was introduced to Cook by Lord Sandwich, with
a view to going on the expedition. Shortly after this, Sandwich met
Dr. Burney at Lord Oxford's, Houghton, and asked him if he could
recommend any one capable of writing the history of the voyage of
the Endeavour; he gave Dr. Hawkesworth's name, and was requested to
introduce him to Lord Sandwich on his return to town.</p>

<p>The object of the Second Voyage was, to use Cook's own
words:</p>

<p>"To put an end to all diversity of opinion about a matter so
curious and important, was His Majesty's principal motive in
directing this voyage to be undertaken, the history of which is now
submitted to the public, i.e., the existence of another continent
in the South."</p>

<p>The discussion on the subject had been resumed with renewed
vigour after the return of the Endeavour, and Dalrymple led one
party, who held that Cook had not set the matter at rest as he had
left far too much space untraversed.</p>

<p><b>WHITBY SHIPS AGAIN.</b>
</p>

<p>The two ships that were to be employed were probably selected in
the Thames by Cook himself, and, like the good ship Endeavour, were
built by Fishburn of Whitby, and purchased from Captain W. Hammond
of Hull. The reasoning which guided Cook in his selection is thus
laid down by him in his introduction to the account of the Second
Voyage:</p>

<p>"The success of such undertakings as making discoveries in
distant parts of the world, will principally depend on the
preparations being well adapted to what ought to be the first
consideration, namely, the preservation of the adventurers and
ships; and this will chiefly depend on the kind, the size, and the
properties of the ships chosen for the service. These primary
considerations will not admit of any other, that may interfere with
the necessary properties of the ships. Therefore, in chusing the
ships, should any of the most advantageous properties be wanting,
and the necessary room in them be, in any degree, diminished for
less important purposes, such a step would be laying a foundation
for rendering the undertaking abortive in the first instance. The
ship must not be of great draught, but of sufficient capacity to
carry a proper quantity of provisions and stores for the crew, and
of such construction that she will bear to take the ground, and of
such a size that she can be conveniently laid on shore if necessary
for repairing any damages or defects, and these qualities are to be
found in North Country built ships, such as are built for the coal
trade, and in none other."</p>

<p>The larger of the two chosen was 462 tons, purchased for
&pound;4,151, and received into the Royal Navy under the name of
the Drake. She was fitted as a sloop at Deptford, at a cost of
&pound;6,568 (this sum, probably, covering both the original
alterations which proved unsatisfactory and those made immediately
before sailing), and at the time of her purchase was about fourteen
months old. The second ship was of 336 tons, also fitted at
Deptford as a sloop, was eighteen months old at time of purchase,
cost &pound;2,103, and was received under the name of Raleigh.</p>

<p>The complement of the Raleigh was eighty, but two additional
carpenters' mates were added to each ship later on. Cook was also
instructed not to bear, as was then usual, any servants on the
books, but to enter A.B.s instead, and each officer who was
entitled to a servant was "to be paid an allowance by Bill equal to
the wages of the number of servants respectively allowed them."</p>

<p>On 25th December the names of the two ships were changed, the
Drake becoming the Resolution, and the Raleigh the Adventure. The
lieutenants appointed to the Resolution were Robert Pallisser
Cooper, Charles Clerke, and Richard Pickersgill, and Mr. Tobias
Furneaux, Commander, and Joseph Shank first lieutenant, of the
Adventure. Of these officers Cook writes:</p>

<p>"I had all the reason in the World to be perfectly satisfied
with the choice of the officers. The Second and Third Lieutenants,
the Lieutenant of Marines, two of the Warrant officers, and several
of the Petty officers had been with me during the former voyage.
The others were men of known abilities, and all of them on every
occasion showed their zeal for the service in which they were
employed during the whole voyage."</p>

<p><b>ALTERATIONS TO THE RESOLUTION.</b>
</p>

<p>Two days after receiving his orders, Cook hoisted his pendant
and superintended the alterations that were to be made for the
accommodation of Mr. Banks and his party of scientists. These
comprised Dr. Solander, Zoffani, the portrait painter, Dr. Lynd of
Edinburgh, to secure whose services Parliament had made a special
grant of &pound;4000 (though "what discoveries they expected him to
make I could not understand," says Cook), and nine others,
draughtsmen and servants; at least three more than had been thought
necessary when the vessel was purchased. These alterations
were:</p>

<p>"to raise her upper works about a foot, to lay a spar deck upon
her from the quarter-deck to the forecastle (she having at this
time a low waist), and to build a round house or coach for my
accommodation, so that the great cabin might be appropriated to the
use of Mr. Banks alone."</p>

<p>The Comptroller of the Navy, Captain Pallisser, was strongly
opposed to these alterations as likely to be detrimental to the
ship's sailing qualities, and though his opinions were overborne,
they in the end proved to be correct.</p>

<p>When he had seen the alterations fairly on the way, Cook applied
for three weeks' leave of absence, on the plea that he had "some
business to transact in Yorkshire, as well as to see an aged
father," and his application was at once granted. He therefore went
to Ayton, where for the first time for seventeen years he was again
amongst his own people. From Ayton he went on to Whitby, and was
met some miles out from that town by many of the leading men of the
place. From the Walkers he received the heartiest of welcomes, and
it is related that the old housekeeper, Mary Prowd, had been
carefully instructed that a Commander in His Majesty's Navy was a
very different person from one of her master's apprentices, and
must be received with all the marks of respect due to his rank. She
promised obedience, but, alas, when the time came her memory fled,
and opening wide her arms, she exclaimed: "O honey James! How glad
I is to see thee!" A welcome, probably, more dear to Cook than any
other could have been, and a proof of the affectionate regard he
could inspire.</p>

<p>In February he was back in London, and Dr. Burney says in his
Memoirs:</p>

<p>"I had the honour of receiving the illustrious Captain Cook to
dine with me in Queen's Square [Bloomsbury] previously to his
second voyage round the world. Observing upon a table,
Bougainville's Voyage Autour du Monde, he turned it over, and made
some curious remarks on the illiberal conduct of that
circumnavigator towards himself when they met and crossed each
other; which made me desirous to know, in examining the chart of M.
de Bougainville, the several tracks of the two navigators, and
exactly where they had crossed or approached each other.</p>

<p>"Captain Cook instantly took a pencil from his pocket book and
said he would trace the route; which he did in so clear and
scientific a manner that I would not take &pound;fifty for my book.
The pencil marks, having been fixed by skim milk, will always be
visible."</p>

<p>This volume is now in the British Museum, and the pencil marks
on the chart are as distinct as on the day they were made.</p>

<p>The alterations to the ship were completed early in February,
and on the 6th she was hauled out of dock, and rigging, ballasting,
and storing commenced. Cook says:</p>

<p>"Every department seemed to vie with the other in equiping these
two ships, every standing rule and order in the Navy was dispensed
with, every alteration, every necessary and useful article, was
granted as soon as asked for."</p>

<p><b>SUPPLIES INCREASED.</b>
</p>

<p>In another passage he again refers to the anxiety of the Navy
Board to see that the quality of the stores was everything that
could be wished, and the quantity was increased from one to two and
a half years' supply.</p>

<p>On the 22nd April the two sloops were at Longreach to take in
their guns and gunners' stores; twelve carriage guns and twelve
swivel musketoons for the Resolution, and ten carriage guns and ten
swivels for the Adventure. These should have been taken on board at
Galleon's Reach, but the Resolution was drawing too much
water&mdash;seventeen feet. When here Cook showed that he thought
she was rather over-weighted with her new upper works, and might
prove crank, but:</p>

<p>"as the Gentlemen's apartments were full of heavy baggage and
the sloop a good deal lumbered aloft with heavy and some useless
articles, which we might soon get rid of or get into the hold after
we had consumed some of our provisions, I still entertained hopes
that she would bear all her additional works, and suspended giving
any other opinion until a full trial had been made of her,
foreseeing what would be the consequence in case she did not answer
in the manner she was now fitted."</p>

<p>On 29th April, Mr. Banks gave an entertainment on board to Lord
Sandwich, the French Ambassador, and other distinguished
personages, and Cook notes that the first named had been on board
several times, "a laudable tho ' rare thing in a First Lord of the
Admiralty."</p>

<p>Cook obtained a few days' leave to make his final arrangements,
and the Resolution was ordered to the Downs under the first
lieutenant, whilst the Adventure proceeded to Plymouth; both
vessels sailing from Longreach on 10th May. The Resolution,
contending against adverse winds, made a very slow trip down to the
Nore, being four days on the journey, and Mr. Cooper reported to
Cook that she was very crank. The latter at once wrote to the
Admiralty that he considered it unsafe to proceed any further with
her in that condition, and proposed that her poop should be cut
down, her masts shortened, and her guns exchanged to four-pounders.
The Navy Board, however, decided that she should be restored to her
original state as far as it was possible to do so; she was
therefore ordered to Sheerness, and her Captain was instructed to
join his ship and see the alterations were properly carried
out.</p>

<p>Before leaving London Cook, who had heard it was said that he
was not satisfied with the vessels chosen for the voyage, wrote to
Mr. Stephens on the subject, giving his opinion that the crankness
of the Resolution "was owing to the additional works that have been
built upon her in order to make large accommodation for the several
gentlemen passengers intended to embark in her." He added that the
proposed alterations of the Navy Board would "render her as fit to
perform the voyage as any ship whatever"; and, referring to the
report that he did not approve of the type of ship, he says, "from
the knowledge and experience I have had of these sort of vessels, I
shall always be of opinion that only such are proper to be sent on
Discoveries to very distant parts." On the 21st he again wrote
Stephens that the alterations were making satisfactory progress,
and that a man had been in the yard who had known the ship before
her purchase, and he had "with some warmth asserted that at that
time she was not only a stiff ship, but had as many good qualities
as any ship ever built in Whitby." In reply to a rumour that the
men were afraid to sail in her, he points out that she is moored
alongside a wharf, and the men could go ashore whenever they
pleased, yet he had not lost a single man.</p>

<p><b>BANKS WITHDRAWS.</b>
</p>

<p>Mr. Banks did not approve of the reduction in his accommodation
necessitated by these alterations, and tried to get a 40-gun ship
in place of the Resolution, and he and his friends succeeded in
raising a very acrimonious discussion on the subject; but the
admiralty stood firm, and the alterations went on under the
superintendence of Cook. On 24th May Banks and Solander went to
inspect her, and on their return to town Banks wrote to the
Admiralty that he should not go the voyage as "the ship was neither
roomy nor convenient enough for my purpose, nor no ways proper for
the voyage." Cook, who says the preparations had cost Banks "about
five Thousand Pounds," does not think that the reasons given by
Banks were the only ones he had for not taking part in the voyage,
and then continues, "their baggage, etc., were got out of the sloop
and sent to London, after which no more complaints were heard of
want of room, etc."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Clerke, who was very friendly with Banks, wrote to
him on 31st May:</p>

<p>"Indeed I am sorry I'm not to have the honour of attending you
the other bout...They are going to stow the major part of the
cables in the hold to make room for the people now. I asked Gilbert
[the Master], if such was the present case, what the devil should
we have done if we had all gone? 'Oh, by God, that was impossible,'
was his answer."</p>

<p>Marra (the gunner's mate), in a Journal of the voyage, published
by Newberry, 1775, says the success of the voyage was due to their
having shaken off:</p>

<p>"the train of gentlemen, who with their attendants occupied the
chief accommodations of the ship," and whose presence would have
rendered it "out of the power of the most determined officer to
have carried such a princely retinue through the icy regions which
they were to pass, without murmurs, or perhaps mutiny."</p>

<p>Some of the newspapers tried to make political matter out of the
affair, and one at any rate roundly declared that "the true reason"
of Banks's withdrawal was on account of a remonstrance from the
Spanish Ambassador against any further exploration of the South
Seas.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of Banks made no difference to his friendship
with Cook, and in the future he was always ready to afford his
support whenever it could be of any service either to his friend or
family.</p>

<p><b>JOHN REINHOLD FORSTER.</b>

<p>As soon as it was known that Mr. Banks had withdrawn, Mr. John
Reinhold Forster, a German of some scientific reputation, applied
for the position of naturalist for the voyage, and, through the
interest of Lord Sandwich, was successful. He was to receive the
&pound;4000 granted by Parliament for Dr. Lynd, and was to pay all
expenses, except ship's allowance of food, and provide all
necessary instruments. He was accompanied by his son as assistant,
a youth of about twenty years, who afterwards attained some note by
his writings and translations. Messrs. Wales and Bayley were
appointed astronomers by the Board of Longitude, with instructions
to take and compare observations at every possible opportunity, and
to take under their special charge the timepieces which were being
carried on the two ships for the purpose of testing their accuracy
and capabilities in assisting in ascertaining the longitude. Two of
these instruments, made by Arnold, were placed in Mr. Bayley's
charge on the Adventure, and two, one by Arnold, and the other by
Kendal on Harrison's principle, under the care of Mr. Wales on the
Resolution. Great precautions were taken to prevent any accident or
tampering with these instruments; they were kept in boxes having
three locks, the keys were held one by the Captain, one by the
first lieutenant, and the third by the astronomer, so they could
not even be wound up except in the presence of all three. William
Hodges, a painter of repute, was appointed as artist, and his
pictures were to become the property of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Joseph Priestley, at that time minister at
Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds, had been invited by Mr. Banks to accompany
him as astronomer, and his congregation had undertaken to guarantee
his position on his return; but the Board of Longitude took
objection to his religious views, and so his application was
withdrawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13. 1772 TO 1774. SECOND VOYAGE.</h2>

<p>Saying goodbye to his family on 21st June, Cook, accompanied by
Mr. Wales, left London for Sheerness, and the next day dropped down
to the Nore. The Resolution was now drawing only fifteen feet ten
inches of water instead of seventeen, a very satisfactory
improvement. She was given a good trial on a wind, and was found
"to answer exceeding well." On 3rd July they arrived at Plymouth,
having been boarded the day before by Lord Sandwich and Captain
Pallisser, who were on a tour of inspection, and Cook had the
pleasure of giving them a satisfactory account of his ship: "I had
not one fault to allege."</p>

<p>On arrival at Plymouth, Cook found that orders had been given to
the stores that he was to be supplied with whatever he thought
necessary, but the only things required were larger coppers for the
distilling apparatus, the ones they had on board having proved far
too small. The officers and crew were paid up to 28th May, and the
petty officers and men also received two months' advance to enable
them to provide necessaries and extras for the voyage. Cook
remarks:</p>

<p>"The payment of six months' wages to the officers, and crews of
these two sloops, being nearly all they had due, was an indulgence
never before granted to any of His Majesty's Ships."</p>

<p>Cook now received his final orders, which he had assisted to
draw up&mdash;in fact, "nothing was inserted that I did not fully
comprehend and approve of." He was to call at Madeira for a supply
of wine; to sail for the Cape of Good Hope and there refresh his
men; then to look for Cape Circumcision, placed by M. Bouvet in 54
degrees South, 11 degrees 20 minutes East, to determine if it
formed part of a continent, and if so to explore it, following the
coast and endeavouring to get as near to the South Pole as he could
without endangering his ships or crews. Should Cape Circumcision
prove to be an island, or should he be unable to find it, he was to
proceed as far south as he thought there was a probability of
meeting with land, and then steering east, circumnavigate the world
in as high a latitude as he could. In case of meeting with land he
was to explore as far as time would permit. When the season
rendered it unsafe to remain in high latitudes he was to retire to
the north to refit and recruit, and at a proper season to return to
the south. In any unforeseen circumstances he was to use his own
discretion, and if the Resolution should be lost, he was to
prosecute his voyage in the Adventure. A copy of these orders was
given to Captain Furneaux, and in case of separation the following
rendezvous were named: Madeira, Port Praya in the island of St.
Iago, the Cape of Good Hope, and New Zealand.</p>

<p><b>FORSTER SAVES SHIP!</b>
</p>

<p>The Forsters evidently were far from pleasant travelling
companions, and at one time or another seem to have quarrelled with
every one on board the ship. At the very first the father was
dissatisfied with the accommodation allotted to him, and offered
Mr. Cooper &pound;100 to turn out of his cabin; when this offer was
declined, he tried to force Mr. Gilbert, the Master, to give up
his, threatening if he refused he should be reported to the king
and turned out of the Navy; this threat appears to have been a
favourite one, and soon became a by-word with the seamen, who,
according to Mr. Wales, would use it to each other on every
possible occasion. But, according to his own account, Mr. Forster
was able to save the expedition from a very great disaster on 12th
July. He says he came on deck and noticed the ship was adrift from
her moorings; neither the officer of the watch nor the look-out had
seen it till he called attention, and then, after a scene of the
greatest confusion, the ship was fortunately brought up within a
few feet of the rocks. On the other hand, the Master's log admits
the Resolution got adrift, but before Mr. Forster reached the deck
the fact had been reported to the Captain, all hands turned up, the
jib and forestay sail set, and the ship quietly dropped down into
the Sound and anchored, never having been in the slightest danger.
The only other one to notice the affair was Midshipman Willis, who
simply states, "dropped from the Buoy and anchored in the
Sound."</p>

<p>Having received the private signals of the East India Company's
Navy, and letters of introduction from the Prince of Orange to all
the principal officers of the Dutch East India Company, instructing
them to afford every assistance that might be required, Cook
hoisted the signal to the Adventure to weigh anchor at 5 A.M. on
13th July, and with a north-west breeze the two ships sailed for
Madeira. When well out in the Channel the Resolution's crew was
mustered, and it was found that, owing to a mistake of the clerk,
there was one man more than the complement, so John Coghlan was
entered on the Supernumerary List for Wages and Victuals.</p>

<p>On the 23rd they were able to relieve a small French boat, from
Ferrol to Corunna, which had been blown far off her course, and had
been short of water for a fortnight. The day following they fell in
with three Spanish men-o'-war; Cook says: "The sternmost hoisted
English colours and fired a gun to leeward, and soon after hoisted
his own proper colours, and spoke with the Adventure." It appears
she enquired who they were, and where they were going, and finally
wished them a good voyage. This account did not satisfy Mr.
Forster, who waxes eloquent and describes the event as "a scene so
humiliating to the masters of the sea." He must have formed a
strange opinion of Cook if he thought for a moment he was one to
put up silently with anything humiliating to the British flag.
Marra, in his Journal, points out that the build and rig of the
ships were unusual for men-o'-war, and that when the Spaniards
found they had stopped king's ships, they "made a proper apology,
and very politely took leave, wishing them a good voyage."</p>

<p><b>THE FIRST LOSS.</b>
</p>

<p>At Madeira, where they arrived on 29th July, they were kindly
received by Mr. Loughnan, a merchant of Funchal, who entertained
some of the party at his house throughout the stay, obtained
permission for the Forsters to explore the island, and procured for
the ships the stores that were required. Here Cook, with his eye on
the scurvy, purchased as many onions as he thought would keep good,
and ordered them to be served out regularly to the crews as long as
they lasted. A further stock of fresh food in the shape of fowls,
pigs, goats, and fruits&mdash;chiefly oranges and bananas&mdash;was
laid in at Port Praya, where they had called for water. On the 19th
the first death occurred; one of the carpenter's mates, Henry
Smook, was at work on one of the scuttles and, falling overboard,
was seen under the stern; every effort was made to save him, but it
was too late. Cook says he was a good, steady man, whose loss was
often felt during the voyage.</p>

<p>On 27th August Cook learnt that the Adventure had also had her
losses. Two midshipman, Lambrecht and Kemp, had died of fever,
brought on, Captain Furneaux believed, by bathing and drinking too
much water under the hot sun of Port Praya. At this time the
Resolution had a clean bill of health, but for fear lest the heavy
rains, to which they were continually subjected, might cause
sickness, the ship was constantly fumigated, washed down, and
thoroughly dried by means of stoves, as advised by Captains
Pallisser and Campbell, with satisfactory results. On nearing the
Cape a sharp but unavailing look-out was kept for a bank which had
been reported, and on 30th October they arrived in Table Bay. The
run from home was considered to have been good, as they had in
great measure escaped the calms they had been told to expect at
that season of the year, and the currents, though very strong, had
only caused a difference between the longitude obtained by
observation and that by dead reckoning of three-quarters of a
degree, so Cook concluded that those north of the Equator in the
one direction were balanced by those to the south in the contrary
one.</p>

<p>On landing they were received by the Governor, Baron
Plattenberg, who told Cook he had received orders from Holland that
the two sloops were to have every assistance that the place
afforded. He also said that two French ships, commanded by M. de
Kerguelen, had discovered land in 48 degrees South, near the
meridian of Mauritius, but after sailing along the coast for about
forty miles, he had been blown off by a heavy gale, in which he had
lost both boats and men. Two other French ships had also called in
March, which were on their way to explore the South Pacific under
M. Marion.</p>

<p>Wales and Bayley got their instruments ashore in order to make
observations for the purpose of correcting the watch machines. That
made by Kendal was found to be working well, and gave the longitude
within one minute of time when compared with that fixed by Messrs.
Mason and Dixon in 1761. The first lieutenant of the Adventure, Mr.
Shank, who had been ill almost from the day of leaving England,
applied for leave to return home, as he felt unfit to proceed, and
Mr. Arthur Kemp was made first lieutenant, his place being taken by
Mr. James Burney. Mr. Sparrman, a former pupil of Linnaeus, was
engaged by Mr. Forster as an assistant, and makes his appearance on
the rolls as servant. The crews were well looked after, as much
time granted on shore as possible, and fresh meat, fresh
vegetables, and fresh baked bread were served out daily in ample
quantity, so that when the ships sailed to the southward they were
all "in as good a condition as when they left England." Cook found
time to write a letter of farewell to Mr. Walker, as it was:</p>

<p>"customary for men to take leave of their friends before they go
out of the world; for I can hardly think myself in it, so long as I
am deprived of having any connection with the civilised part of it,
and this will soon be my case for two years at least."</p>

<p>He at the end speaks of his ships, both "well provided and well
mann'd," and of the Resolution he says: "I can assure you I never
set foot in a finer ship."</p>

<p><b>THE FIRST ICE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 22nd November they sailed for the south, and soon began to
feel the colder climate; the warm jackets and trousers provided by
the Admiralty were served out, extra cuffs to protect the hands
being sewn on, and warmly-lined canvas capes being made. From the
29th till 6th December they were involved in such a heavy gale that
the ships were unable to carry any sail, and a large quantity of
the live stock bought at the Cape perished from the effects of wet
and cold. A scuttle which had been insecurely fastened was burst
open by the sea, and a considerable quantity of water was taken on
board, but beyond necessitating some work at the pumps and
rendering things unpleasantly damp for a time, no damage was done.
It, however, gave Mr. Forster an opportunity for an account of the
terrible danger they were in, and, most wonderful to relate, to
speak well of the conduct of the crew. The ships were carried so
far to the east by the gale, that Cook gave up the idea of
searching for Cape Circumcision for the present. On the 10th the
first ice was encountered in latitude 50 degrees 40 minutes South,
and a little higher they were stopped by a large field, to which
they "could see no end, either to the east, west, or south." This
field was followed along to the south-east for some days, but no
opening was found, so being in constant danger from detached
pieces, Cook reluctantly gave orders to change the course to the
northward. About the middle of December signs of scurvy began to
show, and extra precautions were at once taken; fresh wort was
served out regularly to all hands and the worst case received
considerable benefit from the treatment, although "Rob of Lemons
and Oranges" (a sort of jelly made from the fruits) had had no
effect. Furneaux reported at this time that he had cured two very
bad cases with the Rob.</p>

<p><b>SHIPS PARTED.</b>
</p>

<p>When they had got thoroughly clear of all signs of ice, Cook
once again turned south, and by 26th December had worked down as
far as 50 degrees 31 minutes South, 26 degrees 57 minutes East,
where, though surrounded by large masses of floating ice, they
steered to the west, leaving the main ice field to the north of
them. Gradually working down to 60 degrees South in the longitude
given for Cape Circumcision, and being some ninety-five leagues
further south, with no signs of land, Cook concluded that M. Bouvet
must have been deceived by the ice. (Bouvet Island was discovered
by the German Deep Sea Discovery ship Valdivia on 25th November
1898. The position was fixed as 54 degrees 26.4 minutes South, 3
degrees 24.2 minutes South, and not 54 degrees South, 11 degrees 20
East, as given to Cook, which will account for his want of success
in his search for it.) Here Mr. Wales was enabled to get a sight of
the moon for the second time since leaving the Cape of Good Hope,
and, taking several observations, fixed the position of the ship
with tolerable accuracy. Changing the course to East-South-East,
very foggy weather was encountered, accompanied by great cold,
which coated the rigging with ice, rendering it very pretty to the
eye but difficult and unpleasant to work. Cook says that, though
this suggested very intense cold to the mind, in reality the
thermometer was rather higher than it had been, and the sea was far
less encumbered with ice. Taking large blocks of ice on board it
was found that, when the sea water was drained off, they provided
perfectly fresh water on melting, thus removing a great weight from
Cook's shoulders, and he determined on venturing further to the
southward. On 17th January 1773 they crossed the Antarctic Circle
in longitude 39 degrees 35 minutes East, and at noon their
latitude, by observation, was 66 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds
South, the sea being free from ice. However, in the evening they
found themselves completely blocked by an enormous field,
extending, as far as the eye could reach, from the south-east round
to the west; and as the summer was nearly over, Cook decided it was
unwise to attempt anything further southwards, and ordered a
retreat to the north. Again making for the land claimed to have
been discovered by the French, he spent some days searching for it,
but nothing was seen except some floating weed and a few birds that
are supposed never to get far away from land. On 8th February a
brisk gale sprang up, accompanied by very hazy weather, thickening
into fog, and the two vessels separated. The Resolution cruised
about, firing guns and burning flares, but no response was heard,
and when the weather cleared up, the Adventure was not to be seen.
Poor Mr. Forster was dreadfully scared when he realised the two
ships had parted company; he says that none of the crew "ever
looked around the ocean without expressing concern on seeing our
ship alone on this vast and unexplored expanse." He seems to have
been thoroughly unhappy, for he describes the whole voyage, from
the Cape to New Zealand, as a series of hardships such as had never
before been experienced by mortal man. Cook conjectured, rightly as
it proved, that being a little to the south of Tasman's track,
Furneaux would make for the rendezvous he had been given at New
Zealand, and therefore felt himself free to push on to the
south-east, as he judged that if any large body of land was in the
vicinity, it must lie in that direction, for the swell coming from
the south-west precluded the possibility of any mass of land being
in that quarter.</p>

<p>On 17th February a display of the Aurora Australis was reported
to Cook, who speaks of it as something quite new to him, although
Banks noted a display during the voyage of the Endeavour between
Timor and Batavia. The present one is described as having a spiral
motion, the direction not strongly defined, and at times strong
flashes of light. A second display was seen on the 25th, but not so
marked. On this day, too, some of the ship's boats engaged in
watering from a small iceberg, had a narrow escape from destruction
as the berg turned completely over whilst they were at work.</p>

<p>The weather becoming very unsettled the Resolution was obliged
to make to the north, and on 8th March, the finest day they had
experienced since leaving the Cape, they were able to fix their
position by observation as 59 degrees 44 minutes South, 121 degrees
9 minutes East, the thermometer registering 40 degrees. Of course
this pleasant break was followed by a heavy gale, with a
tremendously heavy sea, and the ship ran before it for New Zealand.
Cook's wish was to touch at Van Diemen's Land, so as to satisfy
himself as to its forming a part of New Holland, but the wind kept
obstinately between west and north, having shifted after the gale,
and he thought it would occupy a longer time than he could spare,
so he bore up for the South Island. It was soon found that a few
degrees of latitude made a great difference in the temperature,
"which we felt with an agreeable satisfaction."</p>

<p>On 25th March at 10 A.M., New Zealand was sighted, and Cook
steered in to the land with the intention of putting in to the
first port that appeared suitable, but as the weather became very
hazy, he thought it safer to stand off again. He had picked up the
land at a point which he had only seen from a distance on his
previous visit, and "now saw it under so many disadvantageous
circumstances, that the less I say about it, the fewer mistakes I
shall make."</p>

<p><b>DUSKY BAY.</b>
</p>

<p>The following day they got safely into Dusky Bay, finding
forty-four fathoms at the entrance and a sandy bottom. In about a
couple of leagues they found a good anchorage in fifty fathoms, a
hawser's length or so from the shore. This was found to be rather
inconvenient, but another one was soon found by Lieutenant
Pickersgill, and received in consequence the name Pickersgill
Harbour. Here the observatory, forge, and tents were set up. Spruce
beer was brewed, to which molasses and some of their inspissated
malt juice was added, fish caught, and, in fact, everything
possible for the comfort of the crew for a short time, was done.
They had been a hundred and seventeen days at sea, had sailed 3,600
leagues without a sight of land, and had arrived with only one man
sick with the scurvy, "occasioned, chiefly, by a bad habit of body
and a complication of other disorders."</p>

<p>One day, passing an island whilst out surveying, Cook was called
by a Maori and landed to meet him. The native was accompanied by
two women, and after an attempt at conversation, presented Cook
with a piece of native cloth, asking, as far as could be
understood, for a boat-cloak in return. One was made for him out of
red baize, and gave so much satisfaction that he presented Cook
with his pattou, a sort of short flat club made of stone. He
visited the ship, and took great interest in all that was going on,
particularly with the saw pit. After watching the men some time, he
intimated his desire to try his hand in the pit, but found the work
not quite so easy as it looked, and soon required very little
persuasion to relinquish his task.</p>

<p>Cook speaks very favourably of Dusky Bay, a good anchorage,
plenty of good water, game, fish, and easy to enter. The timber he
describes as the best he had seen in New Zealand, with the
exception of that at the Thames. There was but little edible
herbage, but he tried to remedy this by planting a quantity of
European seeds, and he also left, in a place where he hoped they
might be undisturbed, a pair of geese. Whilst here Cook was for a
time confined to his cabin by what he describes as a slight cold,
but Mr. Forster says was a severe attack of rheumatism. After
several unsuccessful attempts, owing to contrary winds, they left
Dusky Bay on 11th May, and on the 17th, when near Cape Stephens,
fell in with six water-spouts, one of which came within fifty yards
of the ship, and Cook regretted he had not fired a gun at it, as he
had heard that course recommended. He says he had one ready, but
was so busy noting the phenomena that he did not think of it in
time. On the other hand, Forster says that one "was ordered to be
got ready, but our people being, as usual, very desultory about it,
the danger was passed before we could try the experiment."</p>

<p><b>FURNEAUX REPORTS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 18th May they arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, finding, as
Cook had expected, the Adventure there before them. Furneaux
immediately reported himself to his commanding officer, and said
they had been there for six weeks. After they had lost sight of the
Resolution on 8th February, they heard a gun and bore up for it,
firing every half-hour, but heard no reply. They then cruised about
for three days as near the spot as the weather would permit, and
then, following Tasman's track, as Cook had surmised, made for New
Zealand, sighting Van Diemen's Land on 9th March, near Tasman's
South Cape. He sent a boat ashore at the first opportunity, and a
few traces of natives were seen, but the weather was so threatening
that the boat had to return to the ship. They then put in to
Adventure Bay, and staying five days took in wood and water; they
had been reduced to a quart per day of the last for some time. A
few deserted huts and occasional smokes were seen, but no other
signs of the inhabitants. They then continued up the coast till it
trended away to the west, forming, Furneaux thought, a deep bay.
Passing the islands which now bear Furneaux's name, bad weather
came on, and he judged it wise to make for his rendezvous, firmly
convinced that Van Diemen's Land was joined to New Holland. On 30th
March they sighted the South Island, and were greatly retarded in
their run up the coast by the heavy swell from the north. On their
arrival in Queen Charlotte's Sound, they found the pole erected on
Motuara, with the name of the Endeavour and date on it, and several
of the inhabitants came forward to trade and enquire after Cook and
Tupia. On 11th May they experienced the shock of an earthquake, but
no damage was done.</p>

<p>Finding that several of the Adventure's crew were very sick,
Cook immediately sent out boats for a supply of scurvy grass,
and:</p>

<p>"gave orders that it should be boiled with wheat and portable
broth every morning for breakfast, and with peas and broth for
dinner, knowing from experience that these vegetables, thus
dressed, are extremely beneficial in removing all manner of
scorbutic complaints."</p>

<p>Furneaux had prepared to winter in Queen Charlotte's Sound, but
Cook thought it too soon to settle down to rest and decided to push
on. He was half inclined to go over to Van Diemen's Land and settle
the question of its being a part of New Holland, but Furneaux
appeared convinced, and the winds were contrary, so he decided on
proceeding eastwards, and the Adventure was ordered to refit as
rapidly as possible. A boat sent out for timber on 3rd June was
chased by a large canoe filled with men, but Cook thought no harm
was intended; on a second occasion some natives were on the ship,
when a large canoe came up, and those on board requested Cook to
fire on it, saying its occupants were enemies. This Cook declined
to do, and, instead, invited them to come on board, an invitation
that was accepted after a brief ceremonial, and the newcomers
behaved themselves quite properly; but soon Cook had to get rid of
them all, for he found his men were selling their clothing, which
they would shortly require, for things of no value either as
curiosities or otherwise. The newcomers went off to Motuara, and
Cook followed them up. He had some little conversation with them,
but did not remember having seen any of them at his previous visit,
and thought none of them recognised him. They had their cooking
utensils with them, and he concluded they intended to settle down,
at any rate for a time.</p>

<p>Gardens had been started by Furneaux on his arrival, and Cook
tried to interest the Maoris in them; he showed them the potatoes,
carrots, and parsnips, which they seemed to understand and
appreciate, and they promised to look after them. He remarks that
the intercourse between the Maoris and the whites did not tend to
improve the morals of the former, whom he had hitherto looked upon
as superior in that respect to the other South Sea Islanders he had
come across.</p>

<p><b>THE WATCH MACHINE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 7th June the two ships put to sea, and on the 8th some
accident happened to Arnold's timepiece on board the Resolution,
and they were unable to wind it up. So far it had been working very
well, but not quite so accurately as Kendal's. On the return of the
ship to England, Arnold was informed that either by carelessness or
wilfully Mr. Wales had caused this difficulty. Wales attributed
this rumour to the Forsters, to whom he wrote on the subject, and
it is very evident from their replies that though they did not
admit having circulated the report, they were not ignorant that
Arnold had been so informed. There does not appear to be any ground
for the accusation, but it does appear very probable it originated
with the Forsters.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of June they experienced very rough weather,
and it was not till 18th July that they reached 133 degrees West,
having seen no signs of land on their way. Cook therefore turned
northwards so as to cross the space between his track north and
return south in 1769. This course would practically settle one view
about the supposed Southern Continent, for it had been laid down by
some of the theorists that it must be in the middle latitudes of
the South Pacific. New Zealand had been said to be the western side
of this continent (already disproved by Cook in his previous
voyage), and what Forster calls "the pretended discoveries near
America," the eastern side. The proposed course would take the
ships through the centre of the part of the ocean in dispute.</p>

<p>On 29th July, Cook sent a boat to the Adventure, as he had heard
her crew were very sickly, and found that about twenty of her men
were down with scurvy, and the cook had died of the disease. Orders
were given that the utmost precautions were to be taken, and wort,
carrot marmalade, and rob of lemon were to be freely served out. On
the Resolution, at the same time, three men were on the sick list,
only one of whom had scurvy, but some of the others were showing
symptoms, so similar precautions were taken, with good results.</p>

<p><b>DANGEROUS WATERS.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook was so anxious about the Adventure's crew that he would not
look for Pitcairn Island, discovered by Carteret, although he
believed he was in its neighbourhood on 1st August (he was about
fifteen leagues to the west), but a day or so after was able to
have Furneaux on board to dinner, who reported a great improvement.
He had some cider on board, which he had served out with gratifying
results. Two islands were sighted on the 11th, which Cook named
Resolution and Doubtful Islands; he believed them to have been
discovered by De Bougainville. The following morning at daylight
they found themselves almost on the top of what Cook calls "a half
drowned island, or rather large coral shoal of about 20 leagues in
circuit." In the lagoon which it surrounded they saw a large canoe
under sail. The island was named after Furneaux. As they were now
in such a dangerous neighbourhood, Cook ordered that at night the
cutter with an officer and seven men should keep in advance of the
ships until they arrived in sight of Maitea (Osnaburg Island) on
15th July, when, being in waters he knew, its services were
discontinued. He steered for the south side of Otaheite in order to
get fresh vegetables as soon as possible, and on the 16th at
daybreak they found themselves about two miles from the reef. The
wind dropped, and the set of the current was taking them on to the
reef, so the boats were ordered out to tow, but getting near an
opening through which the tide was rushing with great force, they
were unable to keep the ships off. The anchors were let go, and the
Adventure, finding holding ground, was brought up; but the
Resolution was not so fortunate, and was carried on to the reef and
struck two or three times, fortunately without doing any serious
damage. A land breeze springing up and the tide slackening enabled
them to get in safely, with the loss of three anchors, a cable, and
a couple of hawsers; the bower anchor was recovered by Mr. Gilbert
the next day. Cook says that though he thought they had a
remarkably narrow escape, the natives who saw them did not seem to
appreciate that they had been in any danger.</p>

<p>They remained at this anchorage for a week, and obtained plenty
of coconuts and bananas; but though they saw hogs, they were unable
to purchase any, as the people declared they all belonged to their
chief; so, hearing he was in the neighbourhood, Cook landed to call
on him, and at once recognised him as Tearee, whom he had seen in
1769. The chief also remembered him, and enquired after several of
the Endeavour people. He tried to get Cook to make a longer stay,
promising supplies of fresh meat as an inducement, but as such
promises had so often been broken before, Cook replied he should
leave the next day. Whilst here one of the marines, who had been
ailing more or less all the voyage, and had become dropsical, died,
and the one man who was suffering from scurvy still remained on the
sick list. On the other hand, the Adventure's crew had greatly
improved in health with the change to fresh vegetables. One of the
natives was found to have picked up coconuts from which the sailors
had drunk the milk, and having carefully sealed up the holes,
resold them, and did not seem disconcerted when his trick was found
out.</p>

<p>Before the ships reached their anchorage at Matavai Bay they
were crowded with natives, many of whom Cook recognised, and almost
all of whom knew him. Otoo, the king, at once recognised Cook, and
enquired after Banks, Solander, and others of the Endeavour; yet
Forster gravely asserts that he never saw them at the former visit.
The old fort on Point Venus was reoccupied, tents pitched, and the
observatory set up, and the camp was placed under the command of
Lieutenant Edgecombe of the Marines.</p>

<p><b>SPANIARDS HANGED.</b>
</p>

<p>The king gave a theatrical entertainment in honour of their
arrival, at which his sister was the only female performer. It had
some reference to the coming of the ships, but they were not able
to follow the thread of the story. Cook could see that Otoo was
nervous and uncomfortable, and felt dissatisfied with his
reception, so determined to cut short his stay. No one could
understand the reason of the unsatisfactory feeling, but Forster
suggests that it was owing to the advice of a Spanish deserter, who
had left his ship about March 1773. This vessel was commanded by
Don Juan de Langara y Huarto, and was from Callao; her voyage has
not been published, but the natives gave Forster to understand that
four of her sailors had been hanged on her arrival. Cook refers to
the presence of a white man, who, when he thought he had been
observed, disappeared and was not seen again. Young Forster made an
attempt to explore the interior, but finding the climbing more
difficult than he expected, soon returned. In the gardens which had
been planted at the Endeavour's visit, pumpkins seemed to be the
only things which had done well, and for these the natives did not
care, "which is not to be wondered at," says Cook. Further
enquiries as to the religious ceremonies were made, but nothing
very definite was ascertained; it appeared that on very rare
occasions special criminals, selected by the high priest, were
sacrificed at the Moris. Cook also formed the opinion that the
standard of morality amongst the women was much higher than had
previously been admitted.</p>

<p>Sailing with a favourable wind on 1st September for Huaheine,
the Adventure ran ashore going through the reef, but with the
assistance of the Resolution's boats, she was soon towed off
without serious damage. Forster, as usual, tries to cause trouble
by declaring that Cook would not send assistance till the
Resolution was safely anchored, and thus added to the danger of his
consort. As the boats were in the water before the accident
occurred, in order to render immediate assistance if required, Mr.
Forster's story is too thin.</p>

<p>On arrival Cook was informed his old friend Oree was coming to
see him, so he went ashore to meet him. The boat was hauled up
close to the chief's house, and then five young plantain trees, as
emblems of peace, were carried on board one by one, the first three
being each accompanied by a young pig with his ears ornamented with
coconut fibre; the fourth was accompanied by a dog; and the fifth
by the bag which Cook had given Oree in 1769, containing the pewter
plate with the inscription relating to the Endeavour's visit, and
the beads, and imitation coins. On the advice of his guide, Cook
decorated three of the plantains with nails, medals, beads, etc.,
and he, Furneaux, and Forster, landed with them in their hands.
They were requested to sit down, and the trees were taken from them
and placed before Oree, the first for God, the second for the king,
and the third for Friendship. The chief then came forward and
greeted Cook in a most affectionate manner, the tears trickling
down his cheeks. Further presents were then exchanged, and the
ceremony was over.</p>

<p><b>SPARRMAN'S MISADVENTURE.</b>
</p>

<p>Here they were able to purchase a plentiful supply of
everything, pigs, fowls, and fruit, and Cook says if he had been
able to stay longer he might have bought as much more as everything
seemed abundant. The only disagreeable thing that happened was to
Mr. Sparrman, who, out by himself botanising, was set upon and
stripped of everything but his trousers&mdash;Besant substitutes
spectacles for trousers. He made his way towards the boats, and was
befriended by a native, who gave him some cloth to put over his
shoulders and escorted him to the others. When Oree heard of the
affair he placed himself in Cook's hands, and did his best to find
out the culprits, and after a time Sparrman's hanger and the
greater part of his things were recovered. It seems probable that
some native law had been unwittingly broken and Sparrman's
treatment was meant as a punishment, for every one else had been
particularly well treated. Before leaving Cook added to Oree's
treasures a copper plate on which was inscribed, "Anchored here,
His Britannic Majesty's Ships Resolution and Adventure, September
1773." Some medals were also given him, and he was requested to
show them to any visitors that came.</p>

<p>At Ulietea they were received at a heava or dramatic
performance, one portion of which illustrated robbery by two men,
and Cook says it was acted "in such a masterly manner as
sufficiently displayed the genius of the people in this vice."
Fruit and vegetables being rather scarce, Mr. Pickersgill was
despatched with a boat from each ship to an island Cook calls
O'Taha, where they were said to be plentiful, and he was able to
purchase as much as they had means to pay for, at a very reasonable
rate; but during negotiations the bag containing the trade was
stolen. Pickersgill at once seized everything of value he could lay
his hands on, signifying at the same time that all should be
returned when the bag and its contents were produced. In the
evening a chief, who had been friendly all day, went off and soon
after came back with the bag and about half its contents.
Eventually all was recovered, and the boats left with good loads in
a perfectly friendly manner. When the boats went from Ulietea the
crews of the two vessels were again entertained, but during the
night all the natives disappeared, to the surprise and annoyance of
Cook, who thought something serious had happened to offend them. It
turned out that, seeing the boats did not return, the natives
thought it was a case of desertion, and were afraid they might be
held responsible.</p>

<p><b>BAGPIPES APPRECIATED.</b>
</p>

<p>Leaving here, the course was to the south of west so as to clear
the tracks of other explorers, and then to call at Middleburg and
Amsterdam. Each night the ships lay to in order that they might not
overlook any unknown island, and on 23rd September Harvey's Islands
were sighted and named. On 1st October Middleburg was reached, but
no good anchorage being found, they went on to Amsterdam. Before
they got clear away, however, two canoes came out, and the coast
opening up in a more promising manner, they ran in again and found
ground in twenty-five fathoms. Plenty of the natives, quite
unarmed, came off to the ships, some, amongst whom was a chief
named Tioony, were invited on board; the traders were so anxious to
do business, that those who could not get near enough to hand their
goods into the boats, pitched them over the heads of their friends.
Some of the party accompanied Tioony to his house, which was
delightfully situated, and were entertained with refreshments, in
the shape of coconuts, bananas, and a few shaddocks, called by
Forster pumplemoses, and music; and in return the ship's bagpipes
played, to the great enjoyment of the natives. Turnbull, who
visited the Pacific during the years 1800 to 1804, says that these
instruments were remembered, and in Otaheite were specially asked
for. The musical contribution of the natives commenced with a song
by three girls, who sang rather nicely, and were duly rewarded with
presents, whereon all the women began singing in a manner which
Cook describes as "both musical and harmonious." A short walk
disclosed plantations "well laid out and kept," but as eatables
seemed scarce, a departure was made the next day for Amsterdam, the
waves breaking high upon the rocks as they followed the coast.</p>

<p>Off the southern point of Amsterdam several canoes came out, and
their occupants came aboard without hesitation, presenting cava
root as a peace-offering. The ships anchored in eighteen fathoms,
and were soon crowded with visitors. Nothing but cloth was offered
for sale, so Cook, finding the sailors were parting with clothing
they would soon be wanting, issued an order that no curiosities
were to be purchased, with the result that next morning hogs,
fowls, coconuts, and bananas were forthcoming. Cook, Forster, and
some of the others went ashore and found a chief, Attago, who had
attached himself to Cook, very useful in their trading. Mr. Hodges
painted a picture of this landing, but, as Mr. Forster very justly
points out, the attire of the natives is far too classical. It was
noticed that many of the natives had lost the top joint of the
little finger of one, and in some cases, of both hands. This was
understood to be a mark of mourning for the loss of parents.</p>

<p>The fowls here were remarkably good, and the sailors purchased
some for the purpose of cock-fighting, but they proved much more
successful in the pot. The island is described as well cultivated,
not an inch of ground being wasted in roads or fences. Forster
reported having seen a large casuarina tree loaded with crows, but
they proved to be that pest of the fruit grower&mdash;flying foxes.
He also states that the Resolution anchored in the same spot as
Tasman when he discovered the island.</p>

<p>The natives proved as adept at thieving as the majority of the
South Sea Islanders. One man, who had stolen some books from the
Master's cabin, got off in his canoe, and being chased, took to the
water, and diving under his pursuers' boat, unshipped the rudder,
and got clear away. Mr. Wales, in going ashore, took off his shoes
and stockings to save them from the wet, when they were at once
snatched up by a native, who ran off with them over the coral
rocks, leaving poor Wales in what Cook calls "an unpleasant but
laughable position," unable to follow over the sharp stone;
however, Attago soon afterwards recovered them.</p>

<p>The language was closely allied to that used in the Society
Group, many words being identical; and Cook concluded they had some
form of religious worship, as he noted enclosed pieces of ground in
which one or two particular men were accustomed to repeat speeches
apparently of a set nature.</p>

<p><b>NEW ZEALAND ONCE MORE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 7th October, sailing for New Zealand, they were delayed by
contrary winds, and did not sight the neighbourhood of Table Cape
till the 21st. They stood in to Tolago and Poverty Bays with the
intention of presenting any chiefs who came off, with pigs, fowls,
and garden seeds in hopes of making a commencement in stocking the
island, but none were seen till Cape Kidnappers was reached, when
two made their appearance, and were duly given two boars and two
sows, and four hens and two cocks, first obtaining a promise that
they should not be killed; to these were added a supply of seeds,
such as peas, beans, cabbage, turnips, etc. Standing on through a
series of heavy squalls, in one of which the Resolution lost her
fore topgallant mast, they ran into a violent gale which lasted for
a week, and, after a slight moderation, came on with increased
fury, and the two vessels parted company.</p>

<p>On 3rd November the Resolution reached her old anchorage in Ship
Cove, Queen Charlotte's Sound; but the Adventure was seen no more
during the voyage. Forster was much upset by the stormy weather,
"the dreadful energy of the language" of the sailors, the absence
of their consort which "doubled every danger," the shortness of the
table supplies and his own dislike to a further trip to southern
latitudes. Hoping the Adventure might yet come in, Cook pushed on
with his refit, and thoroughly overhauled his stores. About 4000
pounds weight of ship's bread was found unfit for food, and another
3000 pounds nearly as bad; they were very fortunate, therefore, in
getting a plentiful supply of scurvy grass and wild celery, and a
small quantity of vegetables from the gardens they had previously
laid out.</p>

<p>Any doubts that may have been felt about the cannibalism of the
New Zealanders was set at rest by some of the officers who
surprised a party engaged in a feast. A human head was purchased
from the feasters and taken on board, and a piece of the flesh
being offered to a Maori, it was greedily devoured. A South Sea
Islander, Odidie, was intensely horrified, and refused to touch the
knife with which it had been cut, nor would he be in any way
friendly with the eater. Cook firmly believed that only enemies
killed in battle were eaten, and did not think the custom arose
from any shortness of food.</p>

<p>Enclosing in a bottle, which was buried under a marked tree in
the garden, a memorandum giving the dates of his arrival and
departure, the direction he intended to steer, and other
information he thought might be useful to Furneaux, Cook sailed on
25th November, and as they passed through the straits, guns were
continually fired, and a sharp lookout kept for signs of the
Adventure; but nothing was seen, and as no other rendezvous had
been appointed, Cook gave up all hope of her rejoining him. The
Resolution, when clear, bore up for the south-east, but had the
course at the first been north of east, the two ships might
possibly have met, for the Adventure was then on her way from
Tolago Bay and arrived in Ship Cove four days after the departure
of her consort. Cook says his crew were in good spirits, and in no
way dejected, "or thought the dangers we had yet to go through were
in the least increased by being alone." They were quite ready to
go, "wherever I might think proper to lead them." Even Mr. Forster
had to admit at a little later date, that:</p>

<p>"notwithstanding the constant perils to which our course exposed
us, in this unexplored ocean, our ship's company were far from
being so uneasy as might have been expected."</p>

<p><b>ARMOUR OF ICE.</b>
</p>

<p>On 6th December, at 8.30 A.M., they reckoned they were "at the
Antipodes to our friends in London, consequently as far removed
from them as possible." Here a swell coming from the south-west
showed there was no great body of land in that direction, except at
a considerable distance. The first ice was seen on 12th December in
62 degrees 10 minutes South, and on the 15th, in 66 degrees South,
they were obliged to edge away north as they were surrounded by
large quantities of loose ice, and it was very foggy. Working up to
between 64 and 65 degrees, they again headed east still hampered by
ice and fog, but in a few days the weather improved a little, and
they recovered the Antarctic Circle, and reached 67 degrees 31
minutes South on the 23rd, the highest south latitude hitherto
attained. The rigging was so coated with ice that it was difficult
to work the ship, and Cook altered his course to the north-east.
Marra says, under 18th December:</p>

<p>"Icicles frequently hung to the noses of the men, more than an
inch long...the men, cased in frozen snow, as if clad in armour,
where the running rigging has been so enlarged by frozen sleet as
hardly to be grasped by the largest hand...yet, under all these
hardships, the men cheerful over their grog, and not a man sick,
but of old scars."</p>

<p>Cook says that some of the men suffered from fever brought on by
the unavoidable exposure to cold and wet, but it was slight, and
"happily yielded to the simplest remedies." The ship was so
surrounded by masses of ice as to cause some apprehension, but by
taking advantage of every breath of air the danger was averted.
Christmas Day was passed in constant watchfulness.</p>

<p>"We were fortunate in having continual daylight, and clear
weather, for had it been foggy as on some of the preceding days,
nothing less than a miracle could have saved us from being dashed
to pieces."</p>

<p>On 7th January 1774, five very successful observations gave the
mean longitude as 123 degrees 21 minutes West, the watch gave it
123 degrees 44 minutes, and the dead reckoning as 123 degrees 39
minutes. Cook signifies his keen appreciation of the watch machine,
and says: "I must here take notice that our longitude can never be
erroneous while we have so good a guide as Mr. Kendal's watch."</p>

<p><b>OBEDIENT AND ALERT.</b>
</p>

<p>A further attempt to the south was made, and on 30th January the
high latitude of 71 degrees 10 minutes South was reached, in
longitude 106 degrees 54 minutes West, further progress being
stopped by a large and solid field of ice. This record was not
beaten till 1823, by Weddell, and until recent years very few of
the attempts on Antarctic discovery had proved as successful.
Satisfied that there was no continent existing within the Arctic
Circle except so far south as to be practically inaccessible on
account of ice, he acknowledged he did not regret he found it
impossible to go further, and, thinking that in the unexplored
parts of the South Pacific there was room for many large islands,
and also that discoveries already made had been imperfectly laid
down on the charts, he decided that it was his duty, as he had a
well-found ship and a healthy crew, to remain in these waters and
add what he could to the knowledge of geography. He therefore
planned to find the land discovered by Juan Fernandez in 38 degrees
South, and, if unsuccessful, to proceed to Easter Island and fix
its position, as it was very uncertain, then to proceed to
Otaheite, where he had a faint hope he might hear of the Adventure,
and, proceeding further west, settle the position of Tierra Austral
del Espiritu Santo of de Quiros. Afterwards to turn south-east,
and, reaching Cape Horn in November, he would have the best part of
the summer for exploration in the South Atlantic. He says:</p>

<p>"Great as this design appears to be, I however thought it
possible to be executed; and when I came to communicate it to the
officers, I had the satisfaction to find they all heartily
concurred in it. I should not do these gentlemen justice if I did
not take some opportunity to declare that they always showed the
utmost readiness to carry into execution in the most effectual
manner, every measure I thought proper to take. Under such
circumstances it is hardly necessary to say, that the seamen were
always obedient and alert; and on this occasion they were so far
from wishing the voyage at an end, that they rejoiced at the
prospect of its being prolonged another year and of soon enjoying
the benefits of a milder climate."</p>

<p>Mr. Forster does not agree with this account, for he says:</p>

<p>"The long continuance in these cold climates began now to hang
heavily on our crew, especially as it banished all hope of
returning home this year, which had hitherto supported their
spirits. At first a painful despondence owing to the dreary
prospect of another year's cruise to the south seemed painted in
every countenance; till by degrees they resigned themselves to
their fate with a kind of sullen indifference. It must be owned,
however, that nothing could be more dejecting than the entire
ignorance of our future destination which, without any apparent
reason was constantly kept a secret to every person in the
ship."</p>

<p>It is evident that Cook and his officers did not think it
necessary to consult Mr. Forster as to the movements of the ship,
or, what is more probable, he was in one of his irritable moods and
must say something nasty about someone.</p>

<p>The decision to turn northwards was taken none too soon, for on
6th February a furious storm came on, playing havoc with the sails
and running rigging, and though it abated somewhat next morning, it
blew very strong till the 12th, and would have been highly
dangerous if it had caught them amongst the ice. On the 17th Cook
judged he had crossed his outward track of 1769, and on the 20th he
notes the thermometer rising to 66 degrees, the only real summer
day they had experienced since leaving New Zealand. Having arrived
at the position laid down for the land supposed to have been seen
by Juan Fernandez, he cruised about but found no signs, so on the
25th stood away for Easter Island.</p>

<p>Cook was now taken seriously ill and was confined to his bed for
several days by what he calls the bilious cholic, during which time
"Mr. Patten, the surgeon, was to me, not only a skilful physician,
but an affectionate nurse." He recovered very slowly, and the want
of fresh food told against him when it came to the question of
gathering strength. The only fresh meat on board was a dog
belonging to Mr. Forster, which was duly sacrificed and made into
soup: "Thus I received nourishment and strength from food which
would have made most people in Europe sick." Marra's Journal says,
under 23rd February:</p>

<p>"This day the Captain was taken ill, to the grief of all the
ship's company." 28th February: "The Captain this day much better,
which each might read in the countenance of the other, from the
highest officer to the meanest boy on board the ship." 4th March:
"The Captain perfectly recovered from his illness, to the great joy
of the ship's company."</p>

<p><b>EASTER ISLAND.</b>
</p>

<p>At 8 A.M., on 11th March, Easter Island was sighted from the
masthead, and shortly after noon some of the gigantic statues
mentioned in Roggewin's Voyages were clearly distinguished through
the glasses. The position of the ship at noon had been fixed as 27
degrees 3 minutes South, 109 degrees 46 minutes West. Standing on
and off till next morning, fair anchorage was found in thirty-six
fathoms, but it proved too near the edge of a bank, and they were
driven off it in the night. One or two canoes came out to meet them
as they were working back, from which plantains were purchased, and
Cook proceeded ashore, where he was immediately surrounded by
natives; indeed, some even swam out to meet him. Many of them
possessed European hats, jackets, handkerchiefs, etc., which they
were said to have obtained from the Spaniards in 1770. Their
language was very similar to that of Otaheite, and Odidie was able
to understand them fairly well. There were no trees exceeding ten
feet in height, and the land is described as extremely parched and
dreary, though a few plantations were seen. Some remarkable pieces
of stonework were noticed, enclosing small areas of ground, in some
of which were the statues already mentioned. These were not looked
upon by the natives as objects of worship, although they did not
like the pavements by which they were surrounded being walked over,
or the statues being closely examined. Mr. Forster regarded the
enclosures as burial grounds, and the statues (portions of some of
them are at the British Museum) as monuments to chiefs.</p>

<p>The water supply being found very bad, though Gonzales is said
to have found good springs, and the fresh food for sale but scanty,
the stay was cut short, and on 16th March sail was made for the
Marquesas, discovered by Mendana in 1595. The next day, according
to Marra, the fresh provisions obtained were served out to the crew
at the Captain's expense:</p>

<p>"namely, two pounds of potatoes a man, and a bunch of bananas to
each mess; and this without reducing their ordinary allowance; an
act of generosity which produced its effect; it preserved the crew
in health, and encouraged them to undergo cheerfully the hardships
that must unavoidably happen in the course of so long a
voyage."</p>

<p><b>MARKET SPOILT.</b>
</p>

<p>The Marquesas were reached on 7th April, and after a narrow
escape from running on the rocks, satisfactory anchorage was
obtained, and they were visited by some of the natives, from whom
breadfruit and fish were purchased. The next day further trading
was done, nails being the chief medium of exchange, but the natives
were inclined to be smart in their dealings, and on several
occasions obtained payment without delivery. Cook here suffered
from a relapse, but was able to get about, and after warning the
officer on watch to keep a smart look-out, or something of
importance would be stolen, took his seat in a boat to go in search
of a better anchorage. He was then informed that a stanchion had
been stolen from the gangway, and the thief had got away to his
canoe on the other side of the ship. He ordered a shot to be fired
over the canoes, but no one was to be hurt, and he would pull round
and secure the thief. The order was apparently misunderstood, for
the thief was killed, and the rest of the natives hurried ashore.
Soon after trading recommenced, and the lesson appeared forgotten,
for an attempt was made to steal the kedge anchor by which the ship
was being warped nearer the shore. Cook landed, and the trading
went on as if nothing out of the common had occurred, and some pigs
(so small that it required forty or fifty to provide one meal for
the crew!) and fruit were purchased; but in the afternoon, when the
boats went in for water, all the natives had disappeared. This Cook
attributed to his not being with them, for the next morning, when
he landed, trading was resumed. A short trip was made in the boats
along the coast, and when they returned it was found the market was
closed. It seems one of the young gentlemen had given a small
handful of red feathers he had obtained at Tonga for a small pig,
and now nothing else would be accepted, so they sailed for Otaheite
on the 11th. Cook was very much annoyed at the ill success in
obtaining fresh provisions, for though none of the crew were ill,
he thought they stood in need of a change of food. He describes the
inhabitants as the finest race he had seen in the South Seas,
almost as fair as Europeans, and their language very similar to
that of Otaheite. Their arms consisted of clubs, spears, and
slings, the two former very neatly made, and with the latter they
threw stones a considerable distance but without accuracy. Mr.
Forster managed to secure a quantity of small birds with very
beautiful plumage.</p>

<p>On the 17th April they sighted the George Islands, discovered by
Byron (native name, Tiookea), but, after sending the Master to
report on the lagoon, Cook decided it was too dangerous to enter,
and Mr. Cooper went off with two boats to see if it were possible
to trade. He obtained a few dogs and coconuts, but the attitude of
the natives was so uncertain he would not land, and returned to the
ship. One of the sailors exchanged a plantain for a dog, so it was
concluded the fruit was unknown. On the 19th four more islands were
discovered, and named Pallisser Islands, and on rounding one a
strong swell rolling in from the south was encountered, "a sure
sign that we were clear of these low islands." On the 21st, land a
little to the east of Point Venus was sighted, and next morning
they anchored in Matavai Bay, being immediately visited by the
natives, who seemed greatly pleased to see them again. The old camp
was reoccupied, the observatory set up for Mr. Wales, and Cook had
again the pleasure to record he had no one on the sick list.</p>

<p>The king, Otoo, came to visit the camp, bringing as his present
a dozen pigs and some fruit, and then with some of his friends went
on board ship to dinner, and to receive the return present. It was
then found that the red feathers were greatly valued, a very
fortunate thing as articles of trade were running short. Cook,
after the disappointment in securing supplies at the last visit,
intended to make a very short stay, but the place now appeared to
be very thriving, houses and canoes were being built in all
directions, and there was every sign of prosperity, so he decided
to remain and refit. On 25th April they had a thunderstorm lasting
three hours, such as no one on board had experienced before.</p>

<p><b>THE OTAHEITAN FLEET.</b>
</p>

<p>Going to visit Otoo on the next day, Cook was surprised to see a
large number of fully-manned canoes ranged along the coast, and a
large body of armed men on the land near them. On landing, he was
surrounded by people, and seized by two chiefs, one of whom wanted
to carry him off to see the king, and the other to see the fleet,
and between the two, "I was like to be pulled to pieces," the crowd
making way with cries of "Tiya no Tootee." He was gradually drawn
towards the fleet, but refused to go on board, and after a time was
allowed to return to his own boats, when he found his companions
had been subject to similar treatment. They put out from shore in
order to have a good look at the fleet, and counted one hundred and
sixty large double canoes, all well equipped and fully manned. The
chiefs were swathed in vast quantities of cloth, so that to the
Englishmen it seemed almost a miracle they were able to move. The
vessels were decorated with flags and streamers, and made a very
fine appearance. These were the first line, and, in addition, there
were one hundred and seventy smaller double canoes, each having a
small house or castle on it, which were thought to be transports
and store ships, as the larger ones, as far as could be seen,
carried no supplies on board. The number of men on board was
estimated to be no less than 7,500, and it was ascertained this
armada was intended for the subjugation of Eimeo which had lately
rebelled against Otaheite.</p>

<p>Cook was informed Otoo was waiting at the camp for him, but on
going there he found he had not been there, and on looking for him
again in the afternoon he was still invisible. The fleet had also
gone away; and then it was discovered that some of Cook's clothes
had been stolen from the wash, and the king and Admiral were both
in dread of his anger. However, Cook sent word he should take no
steps to recover the stolen articles, and things resumed a friendly
aspect, the Admiral, Towha, sending Cook a present of two large
pigs and some fruit, giving orders to the bearers that they were to
receive nothing in exchange. He soon after paid a visit to the
ship, and as it was his first, he examined everything with great
curiosity, and appeared greatly impressed with what he saw. One of
the natives having been caught making off with a small water cask,
Cook determined he should be punished, and made a ceremonial affair
of it. The culprit was first sent on board and put in irons, the
natives and the crew mustered, and then the thief was taken on
shore and triced up. Cook then made a short speech in which he
pointed out that when his men were caught stealing from the natives
they were always punished, but the natives were always stealing
from the ship and crew and getting away unpunished, he therefore
ordered the man to be given two dozen lashes. These were duly
administered, and Towha made a speech in which he was understood to
admit the justice of Cook's action. The marines were then put
through their drill, and fired a few volleys with ball, and the
proceedings terminated; but Cook declares he did not know whether
the natives were pleased or frightened by the ceremony. The king's
brother then took some of the officers out to see a part of their
fleet at exercise, and they were just in time to see the conclusion
and the landing of the men. Cook says the canoes were handled very
smartly, and "five minutes after putting ashore you could not tell
anything of the kind had been going forward."</p>

<p>The sea stores were again overhauled, and although the greatest
care had been taken with the packing, large quantities of the bread
were found to be uneatable, rendering the purchase of fresh food at
every opportunity of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>A state visit was paid on board by Otoo's father and some other
members of the royal family, who presented Cook with:</p>

<p>"a complete mourning dress, a curiosity we most valued. In
return I gave him whatever he desired, which was not a little, and
having distributed red feathers to all the others, conducted them
ashore in my boat."</p>

<p><b>MUSKET STOLEN.</b>
</p>

<p>On 7th May the king expressed a wish to see Cook, so the latter
went ashore, but found his Majesty and many of his leading men had
disappeared, and the sergeant of marines reported that one of his
men had had his musket stolen whilst on duty. Cook gave orders that
if the musket was returned nothing further was to be said, and
returned to his ship. Suspicion was attracted to six canoes laden
with fruit and baggage, so Cook gave chase in his own boat. One of
the canoes then made for the ship, and the occupants, women whom he
recognised, informed him they were taking some things to the
Resolution, and that the king was at Point Venus. Cook went to the
camp, to find this was only a story to put him off, and he once
again gave chase, ordering another boat to follow. A few shots were
fired over the canoes, and five out of the six surrendered, the one
he had spoken with getting away. He was now told that the gun had
been stolen by a native of Tiarabou, and therefore Otoo was unable
to get it back, so after a little discussion he decided to put up
with the loss, and sent word to the king that he would say no more
about it. In the evening, however, the musket and some articles
that had not been missed were returned, and the men who brought
them were duly rewarded. Cook says it was remarkable how many had
been actively engaged in their recovery. One man in particular
described most vividly how he had followed up, attacked and killed
the thief of the musket, but at the same time every one was well
aware that this hero had never been away from his own house
throughout the day. A state call was made on Otoo, and with the
usual exchange of presents the old footing was re-established. On
the return from this visit a stop was made "at the dockyards, for
such they deserve to be called," and the canoes in construction
were inspected, two of them being the largest the Englishmen had
yet seen.</p>

<p>The king soon after returned the visit, and requested that the
big guns should be fired, but Cook thinks it was very doubtful if
the experience was enjoyed. A display of fireworks in the evening
was much more to the native taste. Referring to the numerous
robberies that had been committed, Cook says he found it far the
best to deal mildly with the delinquents, and the regulations he
made were, as a rule, well kept by the natives. He was now better
pleased with his reception, and concluded that the island was in a
more prosperous condition than at his last visit. When the ship was
ready to resume her voyage, several young natives volunteered to
accompany her, and Mr. Forster was most anxious to take one as a
servant, but as Cook could see no prospect of returning them to
their homes, he would not permit one to go.</p>

<p><b>MARRA DESERTS.</b>
</p>

<p>When the anchor was weighed on 14th May, Marra, the gunner's
mate, whose Journal has been quoted, quietly slipped into the
water, and endeavoured to reach a canoe which was hanging about to
pick him up, but he was seen and taken on board again. In his notes
he expresses his regret that the scientific world thus lost the
chance of having the experiences of a prolonged residence amongst
these people placed before it. At the time of leaving there was
great talk of the expedition against Eimeo, and Cook would have
liked to have watched the proceedings, but he soon saw that nothing
would be done whilst he remained in the vicinity.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Huaheine on the 15th the ship was
immediately boarded by Cook's old friend Oree with the usual
present, and he and his friends were invited to dine on board. He
was asked what he would like for the return present, and named axes
and nails, which were given him with the request that he would
distribute them amongst his people; this he at once did, to the
apparent satisfaction of all. The thieving propensities of the
natives were still as bad as ever; a shooting party was robbed of
its stock of trade goods, and the day after three officers were
seized and stripped, so Cook took an armed party ashore, captured
two of the leading chiefs and a large house, and said he should
keep them till the things stolen were returned. This had the
desired effect, and everything was soon brought back.</p>

<p>On 23rd May they sailed for Ulietea, and on their arrival the
next day were well received, though it was evident provisions were
rather scarce. They were informed here that two ships had arrived
at Huaheine, one commanded by Banks, and the other by Furneaux, and
their informant describes both Captains so well that it was some
time before Cook ventured to reject the tale as too improbable. It
is possible that there was some foundation for the story that ships
had been seen, for it afterwards became known that M. St. Dennis
had been in the South Pacific about this time with two vessels.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding pressing invitations from the natives to stay,
Cook sailed for Lord Howe's Island, discovered by Wallis, reaching
it on the 6th June, but as it seemed uninhabited it offered no
inducement for any stay. On the 16th a chain of sand-banks and
islets surrounding a lagoon into which no practicable entrance
could be seen, was named Palmerston's Islands; and on the 20th a
landing was effected on Savage Island, but as the natives were very
threatening, and the country enabled them to approach closely
without exposing themselves, the party retired to the boats. A few
spears were thrown, and Marra says that one would have struck Cook
had he not seen it coming and stooped in time to avoid it, and then
aimed with his gun loaded with small shot at the thrower, but it
missed fire; a short time afterwards he again tried it, aiming in
the air, and it was discharged. Forster attributes the constant
misfires to the bad quality of the flints supplied by the
Government, and says that English flints had a very unsatisfactory
reputation on the Continent.</p>

<p><b>MORE THIEVING.</b>
</p>

<p>The course was now set for Rotterdam, where they arrived on 26th
June, and were fairly well received by the natives, who brought
supplies of fruit before the anchorage had been reached; but they
soon began to play the old game of trying to annex anything that
took their fancy. One seized the lead which was in use, whilst a
second tried to cut the line with a stone, and was only persuaded
to desist by a charge of small shot fired at his legs. A small
party of sailors went ashore for water, and a quantity was
obtained; but again the natives became too pressing in their
attentions. The doctor's musket was stolen, then Mr. Clerke's, then
some other things and a cooper's adze; and Cook, though at first
inclined to take no notice, felt compelled to seize two canoes, and
himself wounded a man, who had rendered himself conspicuous by his
disorderly conduct, with a charge of small shot, and it was at
first rumoured he was killed. This Cook would not believe as he had
been very careful not to fire at a vital spot. After a time the
muskets and some of the other things were given up, so the canoes
were returned to their owners, and the adze was demanded. Instead
of the adze, however, the reported corpse was brought on board, and
proved, on examination by the doctor, to be very little the worse
for his experience, having a slight wound on the thigh and a second
one on the wrist. He was soon on his feet, and the adze was then
produced. The next day the people were very civil, and the crew
were able to water without interruption.</p>

<p>On 16th July they sighted Aurora Island, discovered by
Bougainville, but it came on to blow hard, so they did not attempt
to anchor. The natives came down fully armed as if to oppose a
landing, and the ship passed on to Whitsunday Island. Off Malicolo
good anchorage was found, and the natives came on board, and were
so pleased with their reception they returned next day in greater
numbers, and whilst Cook was in his cabin with some who appeared to
be chiefs, a great noise arose on deck. A boat keeper had declined
to allow a native to get into his boat, and the islander was
fitting an arrow to his bow as Cook came on deck, with the
intention of shooting the sailor. Cook shouted at him, and he at
once diverted his aim to the Captain, but the latter was too quick,
and peppered him with small shot, spoiling his aim. He was not much
hurt, and proceeded to fit another arrow to his bow, when Cook gave
him the second barrel and induced him to retire. Some of the others
also discharged a few arrows, so a musket was fired over them,
without any effect. A four-pound gun was tried, and the effect was
truly marvellous; the natives in the rigging and on deck threw
themselves into the water, whilst those in the cabin jumped from
the ports, and the ship was left in peace. Cook was not favourably
impressed by these islanders, and describes them as "in general,
the most ugly ill-proportioned people I ever saw." Forster,
however, thought they were very intelligent. They were judged to be
a different race from the Society or Friendly Islanders, and spoke
a different language.</p>

<p><b>POISONOUS FISH.</b>
</p>

<p>After leaving, many of those on board were very ill for a week
or ten days from having eaten of a fish which Forster calls a red
sea bream, and Cook believed to be the same as those which poisoned
de Quiros's people, and in his account says that:</p>

<p>"The fish had eaten of poisonous plants, all parts of the flesh
became empoisoned. The ship appeared like the Hospital of a city
which had the plague; there was none who could stand on their
feet."</p>

<p>Owing to the care of the surgeons, however "all were
recovered."</p>

<p>The next land seen was a small group of islands, named
Shepherd's Islands, "in honour of my worthy friend, the Plumian
Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge"; and Mr. Forster complains
that Cook's "rashness and reliance on good fortune become the
principal roads to fame, by being crowned with great and undeserved
success." This was very out of place at the time, for Cook was
exercising the very greatest precautions, as he fully recognised
the dangers by which they were surrounded. He always stood off and
on during the night, and only proceeded through unknown waters by
day. Several of these islets were of a peculiar formation, and one
high columnar rock was named the Monument; Forster gives its height
as 140 yards, the other accounts are satisfied with feet. Many of
the group were inhabited, but no favourable opportunity for landing
occurred.</p>

<p>On 1st August a fire broke out on board, and Forster writes:</p>

<p>"Confusion and horror appeared in all our faces at the bare
mention of it, and it was some time before proper measures were
taken to stop its progress, for in these moments of danger few are
able to collect their faculties and act with cool
deliberation."</p>

<p>After about half a page of this, on fires in general, he
observes:</p>

<p>"Providentially the fire of this day was very trifling and
extinguished in a few moments."</p>

<p>Then a few days after a marine, who had fallen overboard, was
smartly picked up, and being well looked after by his comrades, was
soon showing no ill effects of his accident, thus giving Mr.
Forster an opportunity to write of it as an example of "the result
of an esprit du corps to which sailors, at present, are utter
strangers." An utterly unwarranted sneer.</p>

<p>At Erromango, on 4th August, Cook went in with the boats, and
the natives tried to induce them to come on shore, but something
roused suspicion after he and one man had got into the water, so,
making signs that he would come back later, he stepped back. The
natives then rushed the boats, trying to drag them onto the beach,
and succeeded in stealing two oars, at the same time wounding
several of the boats' crews, amongst them Mr. Gilbert, the Master,
with a shower of stones, spears, and arrows. Cook attempted to give
one of the chiefs a charge of small shot, but his gun missed fire,
and he was obliged, very reluctantly, to order the marines to fire,
with the result that several of the natives were wounded. Under the
circumstances it was not considered worth while remaining, so the
ship left for Tanna, some twelve leagues to the south. A bright
light had been noticed in that direction the night before, which
proved to have been caused by a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>A good anchorage was found at Tanna, and the ship warped close
in. Several natives coming on board to trade soon developed the
usual propensity to carry off anything that took their
fancy&mdash;on this occasion the anchor buoys were the special
attraction. Muskets were fired over their head to no purpose, so a
four-pounder was discharged, which for a time had a good result;
but soon they were as bad as ever, so two or three musquetoons were
fired close to them, and though none were hurt, the crew were able
to get their dinner in peace.</p>

<p><b>HOT SPRINGS.</b>
</p>

<p>An old man, called by Cook Paowang, appeared to be inclined to
be friendly, so Cook landed with a strong party to look for water
under his guidance, and met with some of the elders, exchanging
presents with them. The next day the ship was warped in, and three
boats went ashore, but the natives were very threatening, and after
some futile attempts to put things on a peaceable footing a signal
was given to the ship and several guns were fired, when all the
natives ran away except Paowang, who was suitably rewarded for his
confidence. After a time permission was obtained to get wood,
water, and ballast, and whilst trying to lift a stone out of a pool
below high-water mark, one of the crew scalded his hand badly. The
pool proved to be one of a series of springs running down a spur of
the volcano into the sea. Several were tested with the thermometer,
and as much as 202 degrees Fahrenheit was attained. Forster found a
number of cracks on the ridge from which sulphurous vapour and
smoke issued, and one of the crew who had been suffering severely
from rheumatism received great temporary benefit from bathing in
one of the springs.</p>

<p>Many good plantations of yams, sugar-cane, and plantains were
seen, but they could purchase very little as their articles of
trade were not appreciated. The natives did not understand the use
of iron, and did not require cloth as they went almost entirely
naked. Though no direct signs of cannibalism had been found, Cook
was convinced that the practice was not unknown.</p>

<p>After leaving Tanna, the western coasts of the different islands
were followed up till De Bougainville's Passage was reached, when
the course was set for Espiritu Santo. In passing Malicolo canoes
put off for the ship, but the wind being favourable, Cook would not
delay, and gave Forster the opportunity to remark that the main
object of the voyage, i.e. the obtaining a knowledge of the natural
history of the islands, was made subservient to the production of a
new track on the chart of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p><b>CARDINAL MORAN'S GEOGRAPHY.</b>
</p>

<p>On 25th August they entered the bay which Cook believed to be
that discovered by De Quiros, and named by him the Bay of St.
Philip and St. Iago in the Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo, now
known as the New Hebrides. In this conclusion Cook has the support
of Dalrymple and modern geographers, but Forster, for some reason
which is not quite clear, felt compelled to differ. Cardinal Moran,
the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, also believes Cook to have been
mistaken, for in his History of the Catholic Church in Australia,
he places De Quiros's discovery in Port Curtis, Queensland, where
he claims that the first Catholic service ever celebrated in
Australia was held. He puts aside the fact that the latitude of
Port Curtis, 24 degrees South, does not agree with that given by De
Quiros, 15 degrees 20 minutes South, by saying that the positions
of newly discovered places were, in those days, "often purposely
concealed lest other navigators might appropriate to themselves and
their respective countries, the results of the discovery." He
quotes details given in De Quiros's petitions to the King of Spain,
and says: "All these details fit in admirably with Port Curtis on
the Queensland coast." Now De Quiros says the country he discovered
was thickly inhabited by a people who were armed with bows and
arrows, possessed vessels of earthenware, lived in houses of wood,
roofed with palm leaves, were amply supplied with oranges, limes,
pears, almonds larger than those of Spain, hogs, fowls, goats,
capons, etc. That in the bay where he anchored there was no sandy
barren ground, no mangroves, no ants, no mosquitoes, and that his
anchorage lay between two considerable rivers. How these details
fit in with Port Curtis may be evident to his Eminence, but is not
apparent to less distinguished mortals. The district of Port Curtis
when discovered was very thinly populated, and shows no signs of
ever having been otherwise. Bows and arrows and earthenware vessels
were absolutely unknown throughout Australia; houses did not exist,
except in the form of temporary shelters of branches, leaves, and
bark; the fruits and animals mentioned were unknown; and sandy
barren country with mangroves, ants, and mosquitoes does exist in
considerable quantity. The anchorage, had De Quiros ever been
there, might have been between two rivers, the Boyne and Calliope
(both of small size), but Cardinal Moran, to make this detail "fit
in admirably", has recourse to the bold measure of moving the mouth
of the Burnett River from Wide Bay to Port Curtis&mdash;some
2&frac12; degrees to the north of its real position.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Cook's description of the New Hebrides fits
in with much greater accuracy. The latitude was found to be 15
degrees 5 minutes South, and Mr. Cooper, who went ashore with the
boats, reported that he landed near a fine stream of fresh water,
"probably one of those mentioned by De Quiros; and if we were not
deceived, we saw the other." The country was described by Cook
thus:</p>

<p>"an uncommonly luxuriant vegetation was everywhere to be seen;
the sides of the hills were chequered with plantations; and every
valley watered by a stream; of all the productions of nature this
country was adorned with, the coconut trees were the most
conspicuous."</p>

<p>A few canoes ventured near enough to have some presents thrown
to them, but here the intercourse ended, for Cook felt that,
notwithstanding the inviting appearance of the place, he had no
time to spare from the great object of the expedition, namely, the
exploration of the Southern Ocean, and, as the wind was favourable,
sailed for New Zealand for a refit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14. 1774 TO 1775. SECOND VOYAGE CONCLUDED.</h2>

<p>On 4th September Midshipman Colnett sighted a large island,
which was named New Caledonia, the point first seen being called
Cape Colnett. An opening in the surrounding reef having been found
by the boats, the Resolution worked up to an anchorage and was
quickly surrounded by canoes whose occupants were totally unarmed.
At first they were shy of coming near, but at length one canoe was
persuaded to receive some small presents, and in return gave some
fish which "stunk intolerably," but for all that it was received in
hopes more satisfactory trading might result. To some who came on
board dinner was offered, but they would touch nothing but yams.
They appeared to know nothing of dogs, goats, or hogs, but greatly
appreciated both red cloth and nails. Cook landed and was well
received, and water was pointed out, but it was too inconvenient of
access; the land near a village was well cultivated and irrigated,
the products being chiefly yams, plantains, and coconuts, the
latter were not bearing much fruit.</p>

<p>On 6th September Mr. Wales secured a moderately satisfactory
observation of an eclipse of the sun, and was able to fix their
position as 20 degrees 17 minutes 39 seconds South, 164 degrees 41
minutes 21 seconds East. On the same day the ship's butcher, Monk,
"a man much esteemed in the ship," fell down the forehatch, and
died the following day from the injury received. Whilst some of the
crew were engaged in watering, a small party went up the hills to
view the surrounding country, but as all the natives they met
turned back to follow them, Cook remarks, "at last our train was
numerous." They were able to see right across the island, and
estimated the width to be not more than ten leagues. On returning
it was found the clerk had purchased a fish, something like a
sun-fish; and as the artist was engaged in drawing and describing
it, the cook took the liver and roe for supper in the cabin, with
the result that Cook and the Forsters were nearly poisoned, and
were only cured by the most careful attention of the surgeon. When
the natives saw the fish the next morning they immediately
signified it was unfit to eat, but Cook says nothing of the kind
had been intimated when it was purchased.</p>

<p><b>NORFOLK ISLAND.</b>
</p>

<p>The natives were described as robust and well made, "and not in
the least addicted to pilfering, which is more than can be said of
any other nation in this sea." The only tame animals they had were
large fowls with very bright plumage. The country was said to
consist of rocky hills, and the trees identical with those seen in
New South Wales. Leaving a sow and boar behind, in hopes of their
being allowed to breed, and marking a tree with the name of the
ship and the date, they left for the Isle of Pines, where they
arrived on the 19th. Here they were in very dangerous waters, and
Cook says the safety of the ship was owing to the splendid way in
which the watch was kept, and the brisk manner in which she was
handled by the crew. Forster noted "innumerable columnar forms of a
considerable height which we distinguished by the help of our
glasses"; he put them very proudly down as of basaltic formation,
and afforded considerable amusement to Cook when he was able to
prove they were only trees of the Pine family; in fact, some were
afterwards cut down on Botany Island and used for spars. They were
unable to effect a landing on the Isle of Pines owing to the rocky
nature of the shore, but by some unknown means Mr. Hodges painted a
view of the interior of the island, published under that title in
Cook's Voyages. Norfolk Island was discovered on 10th October, and
a landing was effected, but no sign of inhabitants was seen, though
a welcome supply of fish, birds, and cabbage palm was obtained. The
vegetation bore a resemblance to that of New Zealand.</p>

<p>On 17th October Mount Egmont was sighted, and anchoring in Queen
Charlotte's Sound an immediate search was made for a bottle
containing letters which had been left for the Adventure. It was
not to be found, nor was there anything to show by whom it had been
taken, but the next day they saw where an observatory had been set
up, and trees cut down with axes, and so came to the conclusion
their consort had been there. The natives, who were at first very
shy, but when they recognised Cook "went jumping and skipping about
like madmen," informed them that the Adventure came in soon after
they had left, and remained two or three weeks. A story also was
told that a ship had been lost on the north side of the straits
shortly before Cook arrived, and some of the people having had
their clothes stolen by the natives, fired on them, but when their
ammunition was exhausted were all killed. This story, evidently a
distorted account of what happened to some of the Adventure's crew,
was disbelieved by Cook, who thought there had been some
misunderstanding. Cook, from fresh observations, found that he had
placed the South Island on his chart some 40 minutes too far to the
east, and had made the distance between Queen Charlotte's Sound and
Cape Pallisser 10 minutes nearer to each other than they should
have been. In this connection he speaks in the highest terms of the
desire of Mr. Wales to have everything as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>On 11th November the Resolution left the Sound at daybreak to
cross the South Pacific between latitudes 54 and 55 degrees, and
the course convinced Cook there was no possibility of there being
any large piece of land in that portion of the ocean. He therefore
stood for the western entrance of Magellan's Straits, sighting Cape
Descada on 17th December, following the coast round to Christmas
Sound, which they reached on the 20th, the country passed being
described as "the most desolate and barren I ever saw." At
Christmas Sound they were more fortunate, for wood, water, wild
celery, and a large number of geese provided them with a welcome
banquet for Christmas Day. They were visited by some of the
natives, described as "a little, ugly, half-starved, beardless
race; I saw not a tall person amongst them." The scent of dirt and
train oil they carried with them was "enough to spoil the appetite
of any European," consequently none were invited to join the
festivities. They had European knives, cloth, handkerchiefs, etc.,
showing they had been in communication with white men; and Forster
notes they had canoes which could not have been made in the
neighbourhood, for there was no timber of sufficient size.</p>

<p><b>CAPE HORN CORRECTED.</b>
</p>

<p>Cape Horn was passed on 29th December, and Cook made his
longitude 68 degrees 13 minutes West, a little too far to the
westward; it should be 67 degrees 16 minutes West. This is
absolutely correct, according to Wharton. On 1st January 1775 they
landed on a small island off Staten Island, and then put in to a
fine sheltered harbour on the main island, which consequently was
named New Year Harbour. The weather proved unfavourable for
surveying, but enough was ascertained to convince them that the
Tierra del Fuego and Staten Island coasts were not so dangerous to
navigation as they had been represented.</p>

<p>On 3rd January they left to look for Dalrymple's Gulf of
Sebastian, which Cook thought was non-existent, and on the 6th they
reached the position given on the chart, but could find no signs of
any land. Bearing up to the north, Georgia Island was seen on the
14th, and was found to be entirely covered with snow, creating
surprise as it was now the height of summer. The ship ran in
between Georgia and Willis Islands, and possession was formally
taken of the group, though Cook did not think that "any one would
ever be benefited by the discovery." Working as far south as 60
degrees, he turned to the east, being "tired of these high southern
latitudes where nothing was to be found but ice and thick fogs,"
and a long hollow swell coming from the westward convinced him that
he was correct in his assumption that the Gulf of Sebastian and a
large body of land did not exist. On the 30th two large islands
were seen, and then three rocky islets to the north; the largest
was named Freezeland Peak, after the sailor who sighted it, S.
Freesland; and behind these was an elevated coast which received
the name of Southern Thule, as being the most southerly land then
discovered. The position of the ship was given as 59 degrees 13
minutes 30 seconds South, 27 degrees 45 minutes West.</p>

<p>During the early part of February they ran down east between 58
and 59 degrees South, frequently having to throw the ship up into
the wind to shake the snow out of her sails, for the weather was
very bad. After another unsuccessful attempt to find Cape
Circumcision, the ship's head was turned towards the Cape of Good
Hope on 23rd February, and Cook had the satisfaction of feeling he
had solved the problem of the non-existence of any southern
continent except in close proximity to the Pole. He firmly believed
from his observations of the icefields that such a continent in the
far south did exist, but he asserted that further exploration in
that direction would be of little service to navigation, and would
be hardly worth the cost and danger that must be incurred.</p>

<p>On 16th March two Dutch ships were seen steering to the west,
and a boat was sent off to the nearest, which proved to be the
Bownkirke Polder, from Bengal. They were offered any supplies the
Dutchman had, notwithstanding the latter was rather short, owing to
his being some time out from port. Some English sailors on board
told of the Adventure having been at the Cape of Good Hope some
twelve months previously, and that she had reported the massacre of
a boat's crew in New Zealand. At the same time three more sail came
up, one, an English ship, did not intend to call at the Cape, so
Cook forwarded by her a letter to the Admiralty and received some
provisions, and, most valuable gift, a packet of old newspapers. On
the 22nd the Resolution anchored in Table Bay, saluting the Dutch
flag with thirteen guns, and the next morning Cook waited on the
Governor, who did everything he could to assist him and render his
stay agreeable.</p>

<p><b>THREE ON THE SICK LIST.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook was greatly pleased to be able to report three men only on
the sick list, and the remainder were granted as much leave as the
refitting of the ship would permit. The rigging, of course, had
suffered severely, and had to be replaced at an exorbitant cost
from the Government Stores; but Cook calls attention to the state
of the masts, which he considered, after sailing some 20,000
leagues, bore testimony to the care and ability of his officers and
men, and also to the high qualities of his ship.</p>

<p>M. de Crozet put in on his way to Pondicherry, and was impressed
with Cook's courtesy and qualifications as an explorer. He was able
to give the first information of M. de Surville's voyage, and that
he had cleared away a mistake Cook had made in assuming that the
New Caledonia reefs extended to the Great Barrier Reef on the east
of Australia. Forster says that Cook pointedly avoided having any
intercourse with any of the Spaniards who were there, but gives no
reason for it. He also bought a quantity of wild animals and birds,
many of which died before reaching England, and he roundly but
unjustly accused the crew of having killed them.</p>

<p>Touching at St. Helena, where Kendal's watch was found to differ
by about two miles from the observations of Mason and Dixon at the
Cape and those of Maskelyne at St. Helena, he proceeded to
Ascension, where he obtained a good supply of fresh turtle, and
then to Fernando de Noronho, fixing the position as 3 degrees 50
minutes South, 32 degrees 34 minutes West, and crossed the line on
11th June. Calling in at the Azores, land was sighted near Plymouth
on the 29th, and next day they anchored at Spithead; and Cook,
Wales, Hodges, and the two Forsters immediately started for London,
having been away from England three years and eighteen days. During
this time they had lost four men, three from accident and one from
disease&mdash;a record unprecedented in the annals of British Naval
history.</p>

<p>The war with the American colonies was naturally occupying the
attention of the public, but the newspapers found space to publish
more or less authentic information as to their arrival and
proceedings on the voyage. One paper gravely said that:</p>

<p>"Captain Cooke will be appointed Admiral of the Blue, and
command a fleet which is preparing to go out in the spring, as a
reward for the discoveries he has made in his last voyage in the
South Seas."</p>

<p>On 9th August Cook was summoned to St. James's Palace and had a
long audience with the King, presenting several charts and maps and
submitting several drawings, some of which were ordered to be
engraved for the private museum. In return the King presented him
with his commission as Post-Captain and his appointment to H.M.S.
Kent. The commission, signed by Sandwich, Penton, and Pallisser,
bears date 9th August. Furneaux was made Captain. He sailed for
America in October, and was present at the attack on New Orleans in
1777; he died at the age of forty-six, some four years later.
Kempe, Cooper, and Clerke were promoted to Commanders; and Isaac
Smith, Lieutenant. Mr. Wales was appointed Mathematical Master at
Christ's Hospital, and Charles Lamb mentions him as having been a
severe man but:</p>

<p>"a perpetual fund of humour, a constant glee about him,
heightened by an inveterate provincialism of North Country dialect,
absolutely took away the sting from his severities."</p>

<p>Mr. Forster was received by the King at Kew, and was afterwards
presented to the Queen, to whom he gave some of the birds bought at
the Cape. He also attracted attention from another quarter, for
Lloyd's Evening Post reports that on 6th August, his house at
Paddington "was broke open and robbed of effects of considerable
value." Again the Morning Post, 23rd August, reports:</p>

<p>"Monday night, as Mr. John Reynold Forster was returning from
Chelsea in a post chaise, he was attacked by three highwaymen, near
Bloody Bridge, who robbed him of three guineas and a watch set with
diamonds."</p>

<p><b>GREENWICH HOSPITAL.</b>
</p>

<p>Acting on advice from the Admiralty, Cook, on 12th August,
applied for the position of one of the Captains of Greenwich
Hospital, vacant through the death of Captain Clements, stipulating
that if occasion arose in which his services would be of use
elsewhere, he might be permitted to resign. This application was
immediately granted, and his appointment is dated on the same day
as his application. The salary was &pound;200 per year, with a
residence and certain small allowances such as fire and light, and
one shilling and twopence per day table money. It is apparent from
his letters that though he may have taken over some of the duties
(but that is improbable, owing to his time being fully occupied
preparing his Journal for the press and then making arrangements
for his final voyage), he never entered upon residence but remained
at Mile End. He, however, found time to write two letters to Mr.
Walker of Whitby, in the first of which he speaks rather
despondingly of being "confined within the limits of Greenwich
Hospital, which are far too small for an active mind like mine";
and in the second he gives a rapid sketch of the voyage, which, by
its clear conciseness, proves the worthlessness of Mr. Forster's
sneer, repeated by later writers, that the public account of the
voyage owed more to the editing of Canon Douglas than to the
writing of Cook.</p>

<p>Soon after Cook's arrival in London, Furneaux handed him his
Journal of the proceedings of the Adventure from the time of their
separation off the coast of New Zealand. They were blown off the
land near Table Cape in the beginning of November 1773, again
sighting it near Cape Pallisser, only to be blown off again, their
sails and rigging suffering severely. They put into Tolago Bay for
temporary repairs and water, and left again on the 13th, but had to
put back till the 16th, and even then the weather was so bad that
they did not reach Queen Charlotte's Sound till the 30th, when the
bottle left by Cook was at once found, telling they were six days
too late. They pushed on as rapidly as possible with the refit, and
then were further delayed by finding a large quantity of the bread
required rebaking, but they were ready to sail by 17th December.
Mr. Rowe was sent out with a boat to get a supply of vegetables,
and the ship was to have sailed the following day, but the boat did
not return. Burney was then sent off with a party of marines in
search, and after a time discovered the missing men had been all
killed and some of them eaten by the Maoris. Portions of the bodies
were found and identified&mdash;Rowe's hand, by an old scar, Thomas
Hill's hand, had been tattooed in Otaheite; Captain Furneaux's
servant's hand; and midshipman Woodhouse's shoes were found, and a
portion of the boat. The natives who had these remains were fired
on, but Burney could take no further steps, for he estimated there
were fifteen hundred of the natives near the place. Furneaux
believed that the attack was unpremeditated as the Maoris had been
quite friendly, and both he and Cook had been at the place during
their previous visit. He concluded that some sudden quarrel had
arisen and the boat's crew had been incautious.</p>

<p><b>MASSACRE.</b>
</p>

<p>On his next voyage Cook obtained an account of the affair from
the natives, when they said that the crew was at dinner and some of
the Maoris attempted to steal some bread and fish, whilst one tried
to get something from the boat which had been left in charge of the
Captain's black servant. The thieves were given a thrashing, and a
quarrel arose, during which two muskets were discharged and two
natives were shot. The Maoris then closed in and killed all the
sailors immediately. The Yorkshire Gazette of 4th June 1887 states
that it was reported that a midshipman escaped the massacre, and
after many wanderings reached England in 1777. If this improbable
story is true he must have been Mr. Woodhouse, whose shoes were
found, for he was the only midshipman in the boat.</p>

<p>On 23rd December the Adventure sailed, but owing to contrary
winds did not get away from the coast for some days. She stood
south-east till 56 degrees South was reached, and then the cold
being extreme and the sea high, her course was set for the Horn,
reaching as high as 61 degrees South with a favourable wind. Stores
were running short, so after an unsuccessful search for Cape
Circumcision she sailed for Table Bay, and having refitted, again
left on 16th April for England, and dropped her anchor at Spithead
on 14th July 1774.</p>

<p>Mr. Forster states that this second voyage of Cook cost
&pound;25,000, but does not give the source of his information.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15. 1775 TO 1776. ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>After his return Cook was busily engaged preparing his Journal
and charts for publication, which had been sanctioned by the
Admiralty, and was considerably annoyed and delayed by the conduct
of Mr. Forster, who immediately on his return complained that the
&pound;4,000 granted him to cover the whole of his expenses had
proved totally inadequate. He claimed that Lord Sandwich had
promised, verbally, that he was to have the exclusive duty of
writing the History of the Voyage, was to receive the whole of the
profits thereof, and to be provided with permanent employment for
the remainder of his life. This promise was totally denied by Lord
Sandwich, and it certainly does not appear to have been a
reasonable one to make on behalf of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>After a protracted discussion, it was agreed that Cook should
write the account of the voyage and the countries visited; whilst
Forster was to write a second volume containing his observations as
a scientist; the Admiralty was to pay the expenses of engraving the
charts, pictures, etc., and, on completion of the work, the plates
were to be equally divided between Cook and Forster. Cook was to
proceed with his part at once and submit it to Forster for
revision, and Forster was to draw up a plan of the method he
intended to pursue and forward it to Lord Sandwich for
approval.</p>

<p>Cook proceeded to carry out his share, and furnished Forster
with a large amount of manuscript; but the latter proved
obstinately insistent in having his own way in everything, with the
result that, after submitting two schemes to Lord Sandwich, both
extremely unsatisfactory, he was forbidden to write at all, and it
was decided that Cook should complete the whole work, and it should
be revised by the Reverend John Douglas, Canon of Windsor,
afterwards Bishop of Carlisle.</p>

<p><b>FORSTER'S YARNS.</b>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the prohibition against Forster, a book was
published under his son's name, and the latter claims that he
started on the voyage with the intention of writing, took copious
notes, and, excepting that he utilised those taken by his father,
the work was entirely his own. He forgets, however, to say that a
quantity of Cook's manuscripts had been in his father's hands, and
does not explain how so much of his book corresponds with curious
exactitude with that of Cook (in many cases word for word), and
how, when the papers of Cook failed to provide him with further
facts, he was obliged to rely on would-be philosophical
dissertations which it is to be hoped were not obtained from his
father's notebooks. Young Forster says that the appointment was
first of all given to his father in a spirit of pique on the part
of Lord Sandwich, and then the order forbidding him to write was
made because the father had refused to give Miss Ray, Lord
Sandwich's mistress, who had admired them when on board the ship,
some birds brought home from the Cape of Good Hope as a present to
the Queen. In the end the Forsters forestalled Cook's book by about
six weeks, and as this was after Cook had left England on his last
voyage, Mr. Wales undertook the defence of the absent against the
sneers and insinuations that were plentifully given out all round.
The Forsters infer that Cook was unreliable because he suppresses
mention of the bombardment of the Loo fort at Madeira, an event
which never happened; and because he places Valparaiso (where he
had never been) in the position given on the Admiralty chart
supplied to him, which proved to be some 10 degrees out. The Master
who had refused to give up his cabin was, of course, never
forgiven; and as for Mr. Wales, who had observed the Transit of
Venus at Hudson's Bay in 1769, for the Royal Society, he, poor man,
had neither knowledge nor experience in astronomical science. The
crews of the two ships also, carefully selected men though they
were, some of whom had been the previous voyage, were morally and
physically bad, and utterly incapable of performing their duty in a
proper and seamanlike manner. A little allowance must be made for
the two authors, for the father suffered severely from rheumatism,
the son was of a scorbutic tendency, and both were unaccustomed to
sea life, and doubtless the hardships inseparable from such a
voyage pressed heavily upon them.</p>

<p>A second Journal was published by F. Newbery about the same
time, and Cook hearing of it, sent Anderson, the gunner, to find
out the author. With little difficulty he was found to be Marra,
the gunner's mate who tried to desert at Otaheite, and the
publication was stayed till after the authorised version was
out.</p>

<p>A volume of Cook's letters to Dr. Douglas relating to the
preparation of his Journal for the press is preserved at the
British Museum, and it shows how Cook to the very last endeavoured
to serve Mr. Forster's interests, and to smooth matters over so
that they could work together. The last one Dr. Douglas received
before Cook's departure was dated from Mile End, 23rd June 1776,
the day before he joined his ship at the Nore.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
It is now settled that I am to publish without Mr. Forster, and I
have taken my measures accordingly. When Captain Campbell has
looked over the manuscript it will be put into the hands of Mr.
Strahan and Mr. Stuart to be printed, and I shall hope for the
continuation of your assistance in correcting the press. I know not
how to recompense you for the trouble you have had and will have in
the work. I can only beg you will accept of as many copies after it
is published as will serve yourself and friends, and I have given
directions for you to be furnished with them. When you have done
with the Introduction, please send it to Mr. Strahan or bring it
with you when you come to Town, for there needs be no hurry about
it. Tomorrow morning I set out to join my ship at the Nore, and
with her proceed to Plymouth where my stay will be but short.
Permit me to assure you that I shall always have a due sense of the
favour you have done me, and that I am with great esteem and
regard, Dear Sir, your obliged and very humble servant,<br>
<br>
James Cook.</blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the Forsters' endeavour to discount its success
by forestalling the publication by some weeks, Cook's work was well
received by the public, and Mrs. Cook, to whom the whole of the
profits were given, reaped considerable benefit from its sale.</p>

<p><b>FELLOW OF ROYAL SOCIETY.</b>
</p>

<p>On 29th February 1776, Captain James Cook was unanimously
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and his certificate of
election was signed by no less than twenty-six of the Fellows. He
was formally admitted on 17th March, on which date a paper written
by him, on the means he had used for the prevention and cure of
scurvy, was read. That he valued his success in dealing with this
disease, which, at that time, even in voyages of very moderate
length was the most terrible danger to be encountered, is plainly
set forth in his Journal of the voyage. He says:</p>

<p>"But whatever may be the public judgment about other matters, it
is with real satisfaction and without claiming any merit but that
of attention to my duty, that I can conclude this account with an
observation which facts enable me to make, that our having
discovered the possibility of preserving health amongst a numerous
ship's company, for such a length of time in such varieties of
climate and amidst such continued hardships and fatigues, will make
this voyage remarkable in opinion of every benevolent person, when
the disputes about a Southern Continent shall have ceased to engage
the attention and to divide the judgment of philosophers."</p>

<p>During his early days at sea it was no unusual thing for a
man-of-war to be short-handed through scurvy after a cruise of a
few weeks, and in a voyage across the Atlantic as many as twenty
per cent of the crew are known to have perished. To give some of
his own experiences in the Navy: On 4th June 1756, H.M.S. Eagle
arrived in Plymouth Sound, after cruising for two months in the
Channel and off the French coast, and Captain Pallisser reported
landing 130 sick, buried at sea 22, and since his arrival in port
his surgeon and 4 men had died, and both his surgeon's mates were
very ill; this out of a complement of 400!</p>

<p>Boscawen, sailing from Halifax for Louisberg in 1758, left
several ships behind on account of scurvy, one being the Pembroke,
of which Cook was Master; she had lost 29 men crossing the
Atlantic, but she was able to rejoin before the others as they were
in a worse plight. Wolfe reported to Lord George Sackville that
some of the regiments employed at Louisburg had "300 or 400 men eat
up with scurvy." Of the Northumberland when at Halifax, Lord
Colville wrote that frozen (fresh) beef from Boston kept his men
healthy when in port, "but the scurvy never fails to pull us down
in great numbers upon our going to sea in spring."</p>

<p>Having had such experiences Cook appears to have made up his
mind to fight the dreadful scourge from the very first, and though
the popular idea is that he only turned his mind to it during the
second voyage, it is very evident that on the Endeavour he fought
it successfully, and it is most probable would have laid claim to
victory had it not been for the serious losses incurred through the
malarial fever and its usual companion, dysentery, contracted at
Batavia. In proof of this reference may be made to the report of
Mr. Perry, surgeon's mate, and, after Mr. Monkhouse's death,
surgeon on board. He states they rounded the Horn with the crew "as
free from scurvy as on our sailing from Plymouth," i.e. after five
months. He reports FOR THE WHOLE OF THE VOYAGE, FIVE CASES OF
SCURVY, "three in Port at New Holland, and two while on the Coast
of New Zealand, not a man more suffered any inconvenience from this
distemper." He was one of the five cases, but, at the same time, it
must not be understood that no others developed symptoms of scurvy,
only they were so closely watched and at once subjected to such
treatment that the disease was not able to gain the upper hand.
Cook wrote to the Secretary to the Admiralty immediately after his
arrival at Batavia, saying, "I have not lost one man from
sickness." He means here, as elsewhere in his Journals, "sickness"
to be taken as scurvy, and at that time he had lost only seven men:
two of Mr. Banks's servants from exposure; three men drowned; Mr.
Buchan, a fit, probably apoplectic; and one man, alcoholic
poisoning. He arrived at home with a total loss of forty-one,
including Tupia and his boy; thirty-two of these deaths were from
fever and dysentery, and 2, Mr. Hicks and Sutherland, from
consumption.</p>

<p><b>TREATMENT OF SCURVY.</b>
</p>

<p>The chief anti-scorbutics used on the Endeavour, according to
Mr. Perry's report, were:</p>

<p>"Sour Kraut, Mustard, Vinegar, Wheat (whole), Inspissated Orange
and Lemon juice, Saloup, Portable Soup, Sugar, Molasses, Vegetables
(at all times when they could possibly be got), were some in
constant, others in occasional use."</p>

<p>Saloup was a decoction made from the Orchis mascula root, a
common meadow plant, or else from Sassafras, and was at one time
sold in the streets as a drink before the introduction of tea and
coffee. In the United Service Museum there is a cake of the
portable soup which was on board the Endeavour, in appearance like
a square of "whitish glue, which in effect it is," says Sir John
Pringle, President of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Perry continues:</p>

<p>"Cold bathing was encouraged and enforced by example. The
allowance of Salt Beef and Pork was abridged from nearly the
beginning of the voyage, and the usual custom of the sailors mixing
the Salt Beef fat with the flour was strictly forbidden. Salt
Butter and Cheese was stopped on leaving England, and throughout
the voyage Raisins were issued in place of the Salt Suet; in
addition to the Malt, wild Celery was collected in Tierra del
Fuego, and, every morning, breakfast was made from this herb,
ground wheat and portable soup."</p>

<p>Of the personal cleanliness of the crew, which Cook looked upon
as of the first importance, Marra says (when writing of the
Resolution's voyage) he was very particular:</p>

<p>"never suffering any to appear dirty before him, in so much that
when other Commanders came on board, they could not help declaring
they thought EVERY DAY Sunday on board of Captain Cook."</p>

<p>He inspected the men at least once a week, and saw they had
changed their clothing and were dry; the bedding was dried and
aired when occasion offered, and the whole ship was stove-dried;
special attention being paid to the well, into which an iron pot
containing a fire was lowered.</p>

<p>Fresh water was obtained when possible, for Cook remarks,
"nothing contributes more to the health of seamen than having
plenty of water." He was provided with a condenser, but it was too
small and unsatisfactory, and he looked upon it as "a useful
invention, but only calculated to provide enough to preserve life
without health." He attributed the losses on the Adventure to
Furneaux's desire to save his men labour, and neglecting to avail
himself of every opportunity of obtaining fresh water. Cook
throughout the voyage was never short of water; Furneaux was on two
or three occasions.</p>

<p>Dr. McBride advised the use of fresh wort made from malt as an
anti-scorbutic, and the Endeavour was ordered to give it a thorough
trial. Fresh ground malt was treated with boiling water and allowed
to stand, then the liquid was boiled with dried fruit or biscuit
into a panada, and the patient had one or two meals with a quart or
more of the liquid per diem. This treatment was favourably reported
on, but, at the same time, so many other precautions were taken
that it was not possible to say which was the most successful.
Banks, who was threatened, tried the wort, but thinking it affected
his throat, substituted a weak punch of lemon juice and brandy,
which had satisfactory results. After a time the malt, though dry
and sweet, had lost much strength, so as strong a wort was made as
possible, and ground wheat boiled with it for breakfast, "a very
pleasant mess which the people were very fond of," and Cook "had
great reason to think that the people received much benefit from
it."</p>

<p><b>SOUR KRAUTE.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook set great store on the Sour Kraute, and says:</p>

<p>"The men at first would not eat it, until I put it in
practice&mdash;a method I never once knew to fail with
seamen&mdash;and this was to have some of it dressed every day for
the Cabin Table, and permitted all the officers, without exception,
to make use of it, and left it to the option of the men to take as
much as they pleased, or none at all; but this practice was not
continued above a week before I found necessary to put every one on
board to an allowance, for such are the Tempers and Disposition of
seamen in general, that whatever you give them out of the common
way, although it be ever so much for their good, it will not go
down, and you will hear nothing but murmurings against the man that
first invented it, but the moment they see their superiors set a
value upon it, it becomes the finest stuff in the world, and the
inventor is an honest fellow."</p>

<p>A pound of this was served to each man, twice a week, at sea, or
oftener if thought necessary.</p>

<p>Portable soup, at the rate of an ounce per man, was boiled with
the pease thrice a week, and when vegetables could be obtained it
was boiled with them, and wheat or oatmeal for breakfast, and with
pease and vegetables for dinner, and "was the means of making the
people eat a greater quantity of vegetables than they would
otherwise have done." The Rob of Lemon and Orange was a doubtful
quantity, for though Cook had no great confidence in its efficacy,
Furneaux reported very favourably on its use, but it was expensive.
Of vinegar, Cook was of opinion that it was of little service, and
preferred smoking the ship with wood-fires to washing with vinegar,
which had been strongly advised. He substituted sugar for oil, as
he esteemed it "a very good anti-scorbutic, whereas oil (such as
the navy is usually supplied with) I am of opinion has the contrary
effect."</p>

<p>Cook says that the introduction of the most salutary articles
would prove unsuccessful unless accompanied by strict regulations
so the crew were divided into three watches except on some
extraordinary occasion, in order that they might not be so exposed
to the weather, and had a better chance to get into dry clothes if
they happened to get wet. Hammocks, bedding, clothes, and ship were
kept as clean and dry as possible, and when the ship could not be
"cured with fires," once or twice a week she was smoked with
gunpowder, mixed with vinegar or water:</p>

<p>"to cleanliness, as well in the ship as amongst the people, too
great attention cannot be paid: the least neglect occasions a
putrid and disagreeable smell below which nothing but fires will
remove."</p>

<p>He finishes his paper read before the Royal Society as
follows:</p>

<p>"We came to few places where either the art of man or the bounty
of nature had not provided some sort of refreshment or other,
either in the animal or vegetable way. It was my first care to
procure whatever of any kind could be met with, by every means in
my power, and to oblige our people to make use thereof, both by my
example and authority; but the benefits arising from refreshments
of any kind soon became so obvious that I had little occasion to
recommend the one or exert the other."</p>

<p><b>COPLEY GOLD MEDAL.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 30th November 1776 Sir John Pringle, President of the
Royal Society, in his address to the Fellows, announced that the
Copley Gold Medal had been conferred on Captain Cook for his paper
on the Treatment of Scurvy, and gave some corroborative facts which
had come under his own observation, concluding his speech as
follows:</p>

<p>"If Rome decreed the Civic Crown to him who saved the life of a
single citizen, what wreaths are due to that man, who, having
himself saved many, perpetuates in your Transactions the means by
which Britain may now, on the most distant voyages, preserve
numbers of her intrepid sons, her mariners; who, braving every
danger, have so liberally contributed to the fame, to the opulence,
and to the Maritime Empire of this country."</p>

<p>Before Cook left England on his last voyage he had been informed
that the medal had been conferred on him, but he never received it,
and it was presented to Mrs. Cook, and is now in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>During May 1776 Cook sat for his portrait, now in the Painted
Hall, Greenwich, to Sir Nathaniel Dance. There are several
portraits of him in existence; three by Webber, one being in the
National Portrait Gallery; one by Hodges; and one or two others by
unknown artists. Mr. Samwell, surgeon on the third voyage, says of
an engraving by Sherwin, from the portrait by Dance, that it "is a
most excellent likeness of Captain Cook; and more to be valued, as
it is the only one I have seen that bears any resemblance to him."
This portrait of Dance's represents Cook dressed in his Captain's
uniform, seated at a table on which is a chart. The figure is
evidently that of a tall man&mdash;he was over six feet in
height&mdash;with brown unpowdered hair, neatly tied back from the
face; the clear complexion shows little effect of exposure to the
sea breezes, the pleasant brown eyes look from under rather
prominent brows, the nose rather long, and a good firm mouth. The
whole face gives a very pleasant impression of the man, and conveys
the idea that it was a good likeness.</p>

<p><b>COOK VOLUNTEERS.</b>
</p>

<p>Omai, a native of Otaheite, was brought to England by Furneaux,
was introduced to the King, made much of in Society, was painted by
Reynolds, Dance, and Hodges, and seems to have conducted himself
fairly well. He was to be sent back to his own country; and from
the orders given to the Resolution, when she returned, it was
evident she was to be the ship to take him. There was some
difficulty as to the man to take command of the new expedition, as
the Admiralty felt they could not send out Cook again so soon after
his return. However, early in February 1776, he was invited to dine
with Lord Sandwich, to meet Sir Hugh Pallisser and Mr. Stephens,
the Secretary, when the proposed expedition was discussed and the
difficulty of finding a commander was brought forward. It is said
that after some conversation Cook jumped up and declared he would
go, and as the result of this resolve he called at the Admiralty
Office on 10th February, and made formal application for the
command, which was accepted on the same day, and he there and then
went to Deptford and hoisted his pendant on the Resolution. Her
complement was the same as the previous voyage, i.e. 112 men,
including 20 marines; and the Quarter Bill, preserved in the
Records Office, shows the stations and duties of each of the crew,
and the positions of the civilians who in cases of necessity were
expected to take their places as small arms men.</p>

<p>The companion ship, the Discovery, was built by Langborne of
Whitby, and was purchased for &pound;2,450 from W. Herbert of
Scarborough. According to the Records she was 229 tons burthen, but
Cook puts her down as 300 tons; and Burney says the two ships were
splendid sailing company, any advantage there might be resting with
the Discovery. The command was given to Charles Clerke, who had
been both the previous voyages.</p>

<p>The Resolution hauled out of dock, 10th March, completed her
rigging and took in stores and provisions, "which was as much as we
could stow and the best of every kind that could be got." On the
6th May the pilot went on board to take her down to Longreach for
her guns and powder, but owing to contrary winds she did not reach
there till the 30th. On 8th June she was visited by Lord Sandwich,
Sir Hugh Pallisser, and others from the Admiralty, "to see that
everything was compleated to their desire and to the satisfaction
of all who were to embark in the voyage." A bull, two cows and
their calves, with some sheep, were embarked as a present from King
George to the Otahietans in hopes to start stocking the island. A
good supply of trade was shipped, and extra warm clothing for the
crew was supplied by the Admiralty:</p>

<p>"and nothing was wanting that was thought conducive to either
conveniency or health, such was the extraordinary care taken by
those at the head of the Naval Departments."</p>

<p>Cook and King were to take observations on the Resolution, and
Bailey, who was with the Adventure the previous voyage, was
appointed as astronomer to the Discovery; the necessary instruments
being supplied by the Board of Longitude. The chronometer, made by
Kendal, which had given such satisfaction last voyage, was again on
board the Resolution. It was afterwards with Bligh in the Bounty,
sold by Adams after the Mutiny to an American, who sold it again in
Chili. It was then purchased for &pound;52 10s., repaired, and
rated, and after keeping fair time for some years was presented by
Admiral Sir Thomas Herbert to the United Service Museum, and is
still in working order.</p>

<p><b>CLERKE IN THE FLEET.</b>
</p>

<p>On 15th June the two ships sailed for the Nore; there the
Resolution waited for her Captain, whilst the Discovery, under the
command of Burney, went on to Plymouth, but, meeting with damage in
a gale, had to put into Portland for temporary repairs. Captain
Clerke was detained in London, "in the Rules of the Bench," as he
had become financially responsible for a friend who left him in the
lurch. He wrote to Banks, saying, "the Jews are exasperated and
determined to spare no pains to arrest me." It appears that he
contracted the illness which led to his death at this period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16. 1776 TO 1777. THIRD VOYAGE.</h2>

<p>On 24th June Cook and Omai joined the ship at the Nore, leaving
next day for Plymouth, arriving there on 30th, three days after the
Discovery. On 8th July the final orders, which Cook had helped to
draw up, were received. They were to the effect that he was to
proceed by the Cape of Good Hope; to look for some islands said to
have been seen by the French in latitude 48 degrees, about the
longitude of Mauritius; to touch at New Zealand, if he thought
proper; and then to proceed to Otaheite and leave Omai there, or at
the Society Islands, as the latter might wish. Leaving Otaheite
about February he was to strike the North American coast in about
45 degrees latitude, avoiding, if possible, touching at any of the
Spanish dominions, and proceeding northwards to explore any rivers
or inlets that seemed likely to lead to Hudson's or Baffin's Bay.
For the winter he was to proceed to the Port of St. Peter and St.
Paul in Kamtschatka, or other suitable place, and in the ensuing
spring he was again to try and find a passage either to the east or
west; failing that, the ships were then to return to England. A
reward of &pound;20,000 had been offered to any British merchant
ship that discovered a passage between Hudson's Bay and the
Pacific; and now this offer was thrown open to any ship flying the
British flag, and the passage might be to the east or west so long
as it was north of latitude 52 degrees.</p>

<p>On 9th July the marines, who had been carefully selected,
embarked under the command of Lieutenant Molesworth Phillips, and
the following day officers and men were paid up to 30th June, and
petty officers and seamen received in addition two months'
advance.</p>

<p><b>THE RESOLUTION SAILS.</b>
</p>

<p>The Resolution sailed on 12th July, the crew looking on it as a
lucky day, being the anniversary of the day they had sailed on the
last voyage; but as Clerke had not yet arrived, the Discovery
remained behind. Putting in to Teneriffe, Cook purchased a supply
of wine, which he did not think as good as that of Madeira, but
remarks that the best Teneriffe wine was "&pound;12 a pipe, whereas
the best Madeira is seldom under &pound;27." Here they met "Captain
Baurdat" (the Chevalier de Borda), who was making observations in
order to time two watch machines, and were afforded an opportunity
of comparing them with their own. Looking into Port Praya in hopes
to find the Discovery they crossed the line on 1st September in
longitude 27 degrees 38 minutes West, and sighted the Cape of Good
Hope on 17th October, anchoring in Table Bay the next day. The ship
was found to be very leaky in her upper works, as the great heat
had opened up her seams which had been badly caulked at first.
"Hardly a man that could lie dry in his bed; the officers in the
gun-room were all driven out of their cabin by the water that came
in through the sides." The sails were damaged, some being quite
ruined before they could be dried.</p>

<p>The reception accorded by the Dutch was all that could be
desired, and all the resources of the place were at Cook's
disposal. Letters were sent to England and one invalid, Cook
wishing afterwards that he had sent one or two more, but he had at
the time hopes of their complete recovery. On 31st October they
were unable to communicate with the shore owing to a heavy
south-easterly gale which did not blow itself out for three days,
and the Resolution was the only ship in the bay that rode through
it without dragging her anchors. On the 10th November the Discovery
arrived, having left Plymouth on 1st August. She sighted land above
twenty-five leagues north of Table Bay, but had been blown off the
coast in the storm.</p>

<p>It may be noted here that the French, Spanish, and United States
Governments issued instructions to their naval officers that
Captain Cook and his ships were to be treated with every respect,
and as belonging to a neutral and allied power. An honour to Cook,
and also to the nations who conferred it on him.</p>

<p>When her consort arrived Cook was almost ready for sea, so the
refit of the Discovery was pushed on as quickly as possible, but
some delay arose in the delivery of bread ordered. Cook says he
believes the bakers would not put it in hand till they saw the
Discovery safely at anchor. However, on 30th November Clerke was
handed his instructions, and the two Captains went on board their
respective ships to find them fully supplied for a voyage which was
expected to last at least two years. Live stock had been purchased
at the Cape, and one journalist says that on leaving, the
Resolution reminded him of Noah's Ark.</p>

<p>They did not get clear of the coast till 3rd December owing to
light winds, and then on the 6th "a sudden heavy squall" cost the
Resolution her mizzen topmast; not a very serious loss, for they
had a spare stick, and the broken one "had often complained," but
Burney says that owing to the weather it took them three days to
complete the repairs. The cold, rough weather also had a bad effect
on the live stock, several of them perishing.</p>

<p><b>DENSE FOG.</b>
</p>

<p>On 12th December the islands discovered by Marion du Fresne and
Crozet in 1772 were sighted, and as they were unnamed in the map,
dated 1775, given by Crozet to Cook, he called them Prince Edward's
Islands, and a small group further to the east was named Marion and
Crozet Islands. Then sailing south through fog so dense that,
Burney says, they were often for hours together unable to see twice
the length of the ship, and, though it was the height of summer,
the cold was so intense that the warm clothing had to be resorted
to, they sighted Kerguelen's Land on 24th December. The Chevalier
de Borda had given Cook 48 degrees 26 minutes South, 64 degrees 57
minutes East of Paris as the position of Rendezvous Island; this
Cook took to be an isolated rock they only just weathered in the
fog, to which he gave the name of Bligh's Cap, for he said: "I know
nothing that can Rendezvous at it but fowls of the air, for it is
certainly inaccessible to every other animal." Cook, unaware that
Kerguelen had paid two visits to the place, found some difficulty
in recognising the places described. The country was very desolate,
the coarse grass hardly worth cutting for the animals; no wood, but
a good supply of water was obtained; and here the Christmas Day was
spent on the 27th, as the 25th and 26th had been full of hard work.
A bottle was found by one of the crew containing a parchment record
of the visit of the French in 1772; on the back Cook noted the
names of his ships and the year of their visit, and adding a silver
twopenny piece of 1772, replaced it in the bottle which was sealed
with lead and hidden in a pile of stones in such a position that it
could not escape the notice of any one visiting the spot. Running
along the coast to the south-east they encountered very blowy
weather, and finding the land even more desolate than that at
Christmas Harbour, they left on the 31st for New Zealand. Anderson,
the surgeon, on whom Cook relied for his notes on Natural History,
says:</p>

<p>"Perhaps no place hitherto discovered in either hemisphere under
the same parallel of latitude affords so scanty a field for the
naturalist as this barren spot."</p>

<p>The whole catalogue of plants, including lichens, did not exceed
sixteen or eighteen.</p>

<p><b>A SOUTHERLY BUSTER.</b>
</p>

<p>The first part of January 1777 was foggy, and Cook says they
"ran above 300 leagues in the dark." On the 19th a squall carried
away the fore topmast and main topgallant mast, and it took the
whole day to replace the first, but they had nothing suitable for
the top gallant mast. On 26th January they put into Adventure Bay,
Van Diemen's Land, and obtained a spar; Cook spoke of the timber as
being good but too heavy. A few natives were seen, but did not
create a favourable impression, still Cook landed a couple of pigs
in hopes to establish the breed, a hope doomed to be unsatisfied.
The Marquis de Beauvoir relates that in 1866 he saw in Adventure
Bay a tree on which was cut with a knife: Cook, 26th Jan. 1777, and
he was informed it had been cut by the man himself. They seem to
have seen nothing to raise a doubt about Furneaux's conclusion that
Van Diemen's Land formed a part of Australia, so no attempt was
made to settle the question, and they sailed for New Zealand on the
30th, meeting with a "perfect storm" from the south; the
thermometer rose:</p>

<p>"almost in an instant from about 70 degrees to near 90 degrees,
but fell again when the wind commenced, in fact the change was so
rapid that there were some on board who did not notice it."</p>

<p>These storms are of frequent occurrence, and are locally known
as Southerly Busters.</p>

<p>On 10th February Rocks Point, near Cape Farewell, was sighted,
and on the 12th they anchored near their old berth in Queen
Charlotte's Sound, and a camp was immediately established. Here
they were visited by a few of the natives, some of whom remembered
Cook and were recognised by him. At first they thought he had come
to avenge the Adventure's losses, but after a time were persuaded
to put aside their distrust, and they flocked down to the shore,
every available piece of ground being quickly occupied by their
huts. Cook describes how one party worked. The ground was selected,
the men tearing up the grass and plants, and erected the huts,
whilst the women looked after the canoes, properties, and
provisions, and collected firewood; and he kept the children and
some of the oldest of the party out of mischief by scrambling the
contents of his pockets amongst them. At the same time he noticed
that however busy the men might be, they took care to be within
easy reach of their weapons; and he on his side had a strong party
of marines on duty, and any party working at a distance from the
ship was always armed and under the command of an officer
experienced in dealing with the natives. Cook was pleased to notice
his men were not inclined to associate with the Maoris, and he
always tried to discourage familiarity between his crew and the
natives of the islands he visited. It is worthy of remark that two
of the Resolution were on the sick list, whilst the Discovery had a
clean bill of health.</p>

<p>One of their constant visitors was a man Cook calls Kahoura, who
was pointed out as having been the leader at the massacre of the
Adventure's men, and it was a matter of surprise to the natives
that having him in his power Cook did not kill him; but after the
fullest possible enquiry Cook believed it was best to let matters
rest, as the attack had evidently arisen out of a sudden quarrel,
and was totally unpremeditated. Burney thinks the Maoris felt a
certain contempt for the English, either because they were too
generous in their dealings, or else because the murders were
unavenged.</p>

<p>The gardens that had been made at the last visit had in some
respects prospered; in particular the potatoes from the Cape had
improved in quality, but as they had been appreciated by the
natives, there were few to be got. Burney, on the other hand,
declares that nothing could be heard of the pigs and fowls that had
been left. Omai was anxious to take a New Zealander away with him,
and soon found one to volunteer. It was explained that he must make
up his mind that he would not be able to return, and as he seemed
satisfied he and a boy were taken. When they were seasick they
deeply and loudly lamented leaving their home, but on recovery they
soon became "as firmly attached to us as if they had been born
amongst us."</p>

<p><b>THE WEEKLY PAPER.</b>
</p>

<p>Sailing on 25th February, they crossed the tropic on 27th March,
some 9 degrees further west than Cook wished to have done, and had
seen nothing of importance. It is interesting to note that Burney
says each ship published a weekly paper, and on signal being made a
boat was sent to exchange when possible. He says Cook was a
"Constant Reader," but not a "Contributor." It is to be regretted
that no copies exist of this, probably the first oceanic
weekly.</p>

<p>On 29th March, a small island Cook calls Manganouia was
discovered in 21 degrees 57 minutes South, 201 degrees 53 minutes
East (Burney gives 21 degrees 54 minutes South, 202 degrees 6
minutes East.) but the landing-places were too dangerous on account
of the surf. A native came on board who was able to converse with
Omai, and said they had plenty of plantains and taro, but neither
yams, hogs, nor dogs. He unfortunately fell over a goat, which he
took to be a large bird, and was so frightened he had to be put
ashore. The next day another island was seen, and as they were very
short of fodder for the animals, Gore was sent to see if trade
could be opened up with the inhabitants. In this he was fairly
successful, and obtained a quantity of plantain stems, which were
found to be a satisfactory substitute for grass; but the trading
was not brisk, for the people wished to receive dogs in return, and
it was evident that though they had none, they knew what they were.
They were afraid of the horses and cattle, and took the sheep and
goats for some kind of large birds. A party went ashore and were
treated fairly well, but when they wished to return to their boats
all sorts of difficulties were raised, and Cook credits Omai with
their safe return; for it seems he gave judiciously boastful
replies to the many questions that were asked him, and at the
psychological moment exploded a handful of powder, with the result
that opposition to their departure was withdrawn. Burney says Omai
was most useful on a landing party, as he was a good sportsman and
cook, and was never idle. After this experience Cook would not run
further risks, so made for a small uninhabited island where some
vegetables were obtained and branches of trees, which, cut into
short lengths, were eagerly eaten by the cattle, and Cook says: "It
might be said, without impropriety, that we fed our cattle on
billet wood." Payment for what had been taken was left in a
deserted village.</p>

<p>On 6th April they reached Hervey's Island, and were somewhat
surprised to be visited by several canoes, as on Cook's previous
visit no signs of inhabitants had been noticed. Omai gathered from
one or two natives who came on board to sell a few fish, that the
Resolution and Adventure had been seen in 1776 when passing the
island. King was sent to look for a landing-place, but, seeing that
the women were quietly bringing down arms to their menfolk on the
beach, he thought it better to return to the ship, and sail was
made for the Friendly Islands, the Discovery being sent on about a
league ahead, as she was better able "to claw off a lee shore than
mine." At this time Cook was getting rather short of water, so he
set the still to work, and obtained from "13 to 16 gallons of fresh
water" between 6 A.M. and 4 P.M. "There has lately been made some
IMPROVEMENT, as they are pleased to call it, to this machine, which
in my opinion is much for the worse." Falling in with repeated
thunderstorms in which they caught more water in an hour "than by
the still in a month, I laid it a side as a thing attended with
more trouble than profit."</p>

<p>At one of the Palmerston Group they found, amongst other things
drifted over the reef, some planks, one of which was very thick,
with trunnell holes in it, and a piece of moulding from some ship's
upper works, painted yellow, with nail holes showing signs of iron
rust: probably the remains of some wrecked European ship. At
Comango, where they anchored on 28th April, Cook notes:</p>

<p>"It was remarkable that during the whole day the Indians would
hardly part with any one thing to anybody but me; Captain Clerke
did not get above one or two hogs."</p>

<p>A supply of water was obtained and wood was cut, but most of the
trees were what Cook calls Manchineel, the sap from which produced
blisters on the men's skin, and Burney says some of them were blind
for a fortnight, having rubbed their faces with their juice-stained
hands. One of the carpenters had a bad fall and broke his leg, but
for the rest, says Burney, they were "in good health; thank God, no
appearance of scurvy."</p>

<p><b>FLOGGING NO GOOD.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook again complains of the thefts committed so continually, and
says that no punishment they could devise was effectual, for
"flogging made no more impression than it would have done upon the
mainmast." The chiefs would advise him to kill those caught, but as
he would not proceed to such a length the culprits generally
escaped unpunished. Here the Discovery lost her best bower anchor,
the cable having been chafed by the coral and parted when weighing;
Burney describes how by pouring oil on the water they were able to
see and recover it from a depth of seventeen fathoms. Landing on
Happi they were very well received, and obtained plentiful supplies
of fresh food, which was most opportune. An entertainment of
boxing, wrestling, and combats with clubs made from green coconut
boughs was held in their honour; and Cook says that they were
carried on with the greatest good-humour in the presence of some
three thousand spectators, "though some, women as well as men, have
received blows they must feel some time after." When this was over
the chief, Feenough, presented Cook with supplies that required
four boats to take to the ships; it "far exceeded any present I had
ever before received from an Indian Prince." The donor was invited
on board to receive his return present, which proved so
satisfactory that on his return to the shore he forwarded still
more in addition to his first gift, and was amused by a drill of
the marines and a display of fireworks, which, though some were
spoilt, were the cause of astonishment and pleasure to the
wondering natives. During one of his walks on shore Cook saw a
woman just completing a surgical operation on a child's eyes. She
was removing a film growing over the eyeballs, and the instruments
used are described as slender wooden probes. He was not able to say
if the operation were successful.</p>

<p>The chief, Feenough, went off to an island about two days' sail
away, in order to obtain some of the feather caps which were held
in high estimation; and Cook promised to wait for his return, but
finding the fresh supplies were running short, he sailed along the
south of the reef and put in to a bay in Lefooga. On the way the
Discovery ran on a shoal, but managed to back off without damage.
Although he was not short of water, Cook went ashore to inspect
some well which he had been informed contained water of a very
superior quality, but he found it very bad, and says: "This will
not be the only time I shall have to remark that these people do
not know what good water is." Near these wells was a large
artificial mound about forty feet high, and fifty feet diameter on
the top, on which large trees were growing. At the foot was a hewn
block of coral, four feet broad, two and a half feet thick, and
fourteen feet high, but the natives present said that there was
only one half of it above ground. It was supposed to have been
erected to the memory of a great chief, but how many years ago it
was impossible to guess.</p>

<p><b>KING POLAHO.</b>
</p>

<p>Whilst anchored here, a large sailing canoe arrived, having on
board a chief who was treated by the natives with the utmost
respect, and the visitors were given to understand that Tattafee
Polaho was the king of all the islands. He was invited on board,
and brought with him as a present:</p>

<p>"two good fat hogs, though not so fat as himself, for he was the
most corporate, plump fellow we had met with. I found him to be a
sedate, sensible man; he viewed the ship and the several new
objects with uncommon attention, and asked several pertinent
questions."</p>

<p>In return Cook was invited ashore, and when they were seated,
the natives who had been trading submitted the articles they had
received for Polaho's inspection, who enquired what each one had
sold, and seemed pleased with the bargains made. Everything was
returned to its owner, excepting a red glass bowl to which the king
had taken a great fancy. According to Mr. Basil Thomson, who was
for some years in the Pacific Islands, a red glass bowl was given
by the King of Tonga to the notorious Mr. Shirley Baker, as a relic
of Captain Cook, but was unfortunately broken in New Zealand. It
was most probably the one in question. Before leaving, Polaho
presented Cook with one of the red feather caps made from the tail
feathers of the bird the Sandwich Islanders call Iiwi (Vestiaria
coicinea), which were evidently considered of extreme value. At the
same time he gave Cook, Clerke, and Omai some of the red feathers
of paraquets which, though much in demand, were not to be
purchased.</p>

<p>On 29th May they sailed for Tongatabu, but, the wind failing,
they nearly ran ashore on the 31st on a low sandy island on which
the sea was breaking very heavily. Fortunately all hands had just
been engaged in putting the ship about, "so that the necessary
movements were not only executed with judgment but with alertness,
and this alone saved the ship." Cook confesses that he was tired of
beating about in these dangerous waters, and felt relieved to get
back to his old anchorage off Annamooka. Feenough here rejoined the
ship, and his behaviour before Polaho was sufficient evidence as to
the high position held by the latter, for he made a deep reverence
to him, and afterwards would not eat or drink in his presence, but
left the cabin as soon as dinner was announced.</p>

<p><b>AN ENTERTAINMENT.</b>
</p>

<p>On 6th June they sailed for Tongatabu again, accompanied by some
sailing canoes which could all easily outdistance the two ships. A
good anchorage was found, and Cook's old friends, Otago and
Toobough, were soon on board to greet them. As it was proposed to
make a short stay, the cattle were landed, the observatory set up,
and the sail-makers set to work to overhaul the sails, for
much-required repairs. Cook speaks very highly of the orderly
behaviour of the natives, many of whom had never seen a white man
before. Hearing much of an important chief named Mariwaggee, Cook
persuaded the king to escort a party to his residence, which was
found to be pleasantly situated on an inlet where most of the
chiefs resided, surrounded by neatly fenced plantations; but they
were informed that Mariwaggee had gone to see the ships. This was
found to be untrue, but the next day he appeared, accompanied by a
large number of both sexes, and Cook at once landed with some
presents for him, only to find he was accompanied by another chief,
to whom something had to be given as well. Fortunately the two were
easily satisfied, and the present was divided between them.
Mariwaggee was found to be the father of Feenough, and the
father-in-law of the king. He gave a grand entertainment of singing
and dancing in honour of the strangers, which commenced about
eleven in the morning and lasted till between three and four in the
afternoon, and wound up with a presentation of a large number of
yams, each pair of the roots being tied to a stick about six feet
long, and decorated with fish. Cook says it was hard to say which
was the most valuable, the yams for food or the sticks for
firewood; but, as for the fish, "it might serve to please the
sight, but was very offensive to the smell, as some of it had been
kept two or three days for this occasion." More singing and dancing
then took place, and then the English gave a display of fireworks,
which "astonished and highly entertained" the natives.</p>

<p>Being afraid that some of his live stock might be stolen, Cook
tried to interest some of the chiefs in them by presenting the king
with a bull and cow and some goats; to Feenough a horse and mare,
and to Mariwaggee a ram and two ewes. Some one, however, was not
satisfied, and a kid and two turkey cocks were stolen; and as
thefts had been frequent and very daring, including an attempt to
steal one of the anchors of the Discovery, which would have been
successful had not one of the flukes of the anchor got fixed in one
of the chain plates, Cook determined to put his foot down. He
seized three canoes, and, hearing Feenough and some other chiefs
were in a house together, he placed a guard over them and informed
them they would be detained till the stolen goods were returned.
They took the matter coolly, and said that everything should be
returned. Some of the things being produced, Cook invited his
prisoners on board ship to dine, and when they came back the kid
and a turkey were brought, so the prisoners and canoes were
released. At one time a small hostile demonstration was made by the
natives, but the landing of a few marines and an order from the
king put an end to it.</p>

<p><b>SMART WORKMEN.</b>
</p>

<p>The following day Cook was invited on shore and found some
natives busy erecting two sets of poles, one on each side of the
place set apart for the guests. Each set consisted of four placed
in a square about two feet apart, secured from spreading by cross
pieces, and carried up to a height of about thirty feet, the
intervening space being filled with yams. On the top of one
structure were two baked pigs, and on the other alive one, with a
second tied by its legs about half way up. Cook was particularly
struck by the way the men raised these two towers, and says if he
had ordered his sailors to do such a thing, they would have wanted
carpenters and tools and at least a hundredweight of nails, and
would have taken as many days as it did these people hours. When
the erections were completed, piles of bread-fruit and yams were
heaped on either side, and a turtle and some excellent fish were
added, and then the whole was presented to Cook.</p>

<p>A party of officers from both ships went off to an island
without leave, and returned two days after without their muskets,
ammunition, and other articles which had been stolen. They
persuaded Omai to make a private complaint to the king, which
resulted in the chiefs leaving the neighbourhood. Their
disappearance annoyed Cook, and when the affair was explained to
him he severely reprimanded Omai for speaking on the matter without
orders. This put Omai on his mettle, and he managed to persuade
Feenough to return, and informed the king that no serious
consequences should ensue. Matters were then easily smoothed over;
most of the stolen goods, including the missing turkey, were
returned, and the king said he ought not to have been held
responsible, for, if he had known that any one wished to see the
island, he would have sent a chief who would have ensured their
safety.</p>

<p>An eclipse of the sun was to occur on 5th July, and Cook decided
to remain so as to secure observations, and meanwhile employed
himself in exploring the neighbourhood and studying the customs of
the natives. On one occasion, thinking to see an interesting
ceremony, he accompanied Polaho, who was going to do state mourning
for a son who had been dead some time. The result was
disappointing, and the chief impression left with Cook seems to
have been that over their clothing of native cloth, those present
wore old and ragged mats; those of the king being the raggedest,
and "might have served his great-grandfather on some such like
occasion."</p>

<p>July 5th proved dark and cloudy, with heavy showers of rain, and
the observations were unsatisfactory, especially as the clouds came
up thickly in the middle of the eclipse, and the sun was seen no
more for the rest of the day. This failure was not of great
importance, for the longitude had already been satisfactorily
ascertained by several very good lunar observations, so as soon as
the eclipse was over everything was sent on board the ships,
including the sheep which had been presented to Mariwaggee. No one
had taken any notice of them since they were landed, and Cook felt
sure they would be killed by the dogs as soon as the ships
left.</p>

<p><b>A NATIVE CEREMONY.</b>
</p>

<p>As the wind proved contrary, and it was understood that the
king's son was to be initiated into the estate of manhood, eating
with his father for the first time, Cook determined to remain a few
days longer. A party of the officers went over to the island of
Moa, where the ceremony was to be held, and found the king in a
very dirty enclosure, drinking kava; and as the method of preparing
this beverage was uninviting to Europeans, they went for a walk
till about ten o'clock. Finding large numbers of people assembling
in an open space near a large building they rejoined the king,
taking off their hats and untying their hair, "that we might appear
the more decent" in the eyes of the natives. The proceedings
consisted of marching of men laden with yams tied on to sticks, of
considerable speech-making, and various performances of which the
signification could not be understood, and then the prince made his
appearance. He seated himself with a few of his friends on the
ground, and some women wound a long piece of cloth round them, and
after some more speech-making and mysterious pantomime with sticks
representing yams, the proceedings ended for the day. As there were
signs that so many white onlookers was not altogether acceptable to
the natives, some of the party returned to the ships; but Cook
resolved to see it out, and joined the king at supper, and the
latter enjoyed some brandy and water so much that Cook says "he
went to bed quite grogish."</p>

<p>After breakfast Cook paid a visit to the prince and presented
him was enough English cloth to make a suit, receiving native cloth
in return. After dinner the people mustered for the remains of the
ceremony, and Cook determined to join the principal party, so he
seated himself with it, and would not understand when requested to
leave. He was then requested to bare his shoulders as a mark of
respect, and immediately did so, and was then no further molested.
A somewhat similar performance was gone through as the day before,
but the significance of which could not be ascertained, and then
suddenly all the people turned their backs on king and prince, who,
Cook was afterwards informed, had had pieces of roast yam given
them to eat. An exhibition of boxing and wrestling was then given,
and after a speech or two the proceedings terminated. Cook was
informed that in about three months a much greater affair would
take place at which ten men would be sacrificed.</p>

<p>On 10th July the ships sailed through a very difficult passage,
arriving off Middleburg on the 12th, where they were visited by
their old friend Taoofa. The country appeared flourishing, and they
obtained some turnips raised from seed sown at Cook's last visit.
An exhibition of boxing was given, and was to have been repeated
the following night, but unfortunately some of the natives fell
upon a sailor and stripped him of his clothes. Cook thereupon
seized two canoes and a pig, demanding that the culprits should be
given up. A man who had the shirt and trousers was brought, and so
the canoes were returned and the pig paid for, and next day the
thief was liberated. The remainder of the sailor's clothes were
afterwards found, but so much torn as to be worthless.</p>

<p>They left the Friendly Islands on the 17th, after a stay of more
than two months, during which time they had been living almost
entirely on food they had purchased from the natives, with whom
they had been on fairly good terms. The 29th brought them into a
very heavy squall which cost the Resolution a couple of staysails
and her consort a main topmast and main topgallant yard, springing
the head of her main-mast so badly that the rigging of a jury-mast
was attended with some danger, but it was at length accomplished, a
spare jibboom being furnished for the purpose by the Resolution.
Otaheite was reached on 12th August, and amongst the first visitors
on board were Omai's brother-in-law and others who knew him before
he went away; they treated him as if he was an Englishman and a
stranger, but when he took his brother-in-law to his cabin and gave
him some of the valuable red feathers a change came over them all,
and they expressed the greatest interest in him. Cook says Omai
"would take no advice, but permitted himself to be made the dupe of
every designing knave." Of these red feathers Cook says they were
of such value that "not more than might be got from a tomtit, would
purchase a hog of 40 or 50 pounds weight." Nails and beads were not
looked at, although they had previously been very acceptable.</p>

<p><b>SPANISH SHIPS.</b>
</p>

<p>Two ships from Lima were found to have visited the island twice
since Cook's last call, and the first time the Spaniards built a
house with material they had with them. They left four men in
charge, and were away for about ten months. At the second visit
their Commodore died, and was buried near the house which was left
at their departure, and the natives built a shade over it to
protect it from the weather. It consisted of two rooms, furnished
with table, bed, bench, and a few other trifles, and the timbers
were found to have been carefully marked to facilitate erection.
Near by was a cross having the following inscription cut on it:</p>

<blockquote>CHRISTUS VINCIT,<br>
CAROLUS III. IMPERAT, 1774.</blockquote>

<p>Cook caused to be cut on the back:</p>

<blockquote>GEORGIUS TERTIUS REX.<br>
ANNIS 1767, 69, 73, 74, ET 78.</blockquote>

<p>At the end of their first visit the Spaniards took away four
natives to Lima; one died, one remained at Lima, and the other two
returned with the ships; but Cook thinks they were not improved by
their experience, and had not added to their respectability in the
eyes of their countrymen.</p>

<p>In view of the cold climate to be faced in the near future, Cook
was desirous to save his stock of spirits, and mustered the crew of
the Resolution in order to explain the position; he pointed out
that the supply of coconuts was abundant, and the benefit of the
spirits would be appreciated amongst the cold winds and ice of the
north, but left the decision to them. He was gratified to find the
crew was willing to accept his suggestion, and ordered Clerke to
put the matter before the crew of the Discovery, when it was again
well received. An order was accordingly issued to stop:</p>

<p>"serving grog except on Saturday nights, when they had full
allowance to drink to their female friends in England, lest amongst
the pretty girls of Otaheite, they should be wholly forgotten."</p>

<p>During a state visit paid by the chief of the district, at which
Omai attended "dressed in a strange medley of all he was possessed
of," Cook was informed that the Spaniards laid claim to the
country, and had given instructions that Cook was not to be allowed
to land if he returned. However, the chief executed a formal
surrender of his province to Cook, and presents were exchanged, the
whole ceremony ending with a display of fireworks which "both
pleased and astonished" the natives. Some of the civilians reported
that they had discovered a Roman Catholic chapel in their walks;
but on inspection it proved to be what Cook at once suspected, the
grave of a chief decorated with different coloured cloths and mats,
and a piece of scarlet broadcloth which had been given by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p><b>RED FEATHERS.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 23rd August the two ships arrived in Matavai Bay, where
they were well received by Otoo, who was gratified by a present of
a fine linen suit, a hat with a gold band, some tools, a feather
helmet from the Friendly Islands, and, what he seemed to value
most, a large bunch of the celebrated red feathers. In return he
sent on board the ships enough food to have lasted both crews for a
week, if it had only been possible to keep it good for that length
of time. The royal family dined on board the Resolution; and after
dinner Cook and Omai called on Oparee, taking with them a peacock
and peahen sent to the island by Lord Bessborough, a turkey cock
and hen, a gander and three geese, a drake and four ducks to make a
start in stocking the island. A gander was seen, which the natives
said had been left by Wallis ten years previously; several goats
and a bull left by the Spaniards were also seen, so Cook landed
three cows as company for the last. The horses and sheep were also
landed, and Cook remarks that getting rid of all these animals
lightened him:</p>

<p>"of a very heavy burden; the trouble and vexation that attended
the bringing these animals thus far is hardly to be conceived. But
the satisfaction I felt in having been so fortunate as to fulfil
His Majesty's design in sending such useful animals to two worthy
nations sufficiently recompensed me for the many anxious hours I
had on their account."</p>

<p>Whilst here, the two ships were thoroughly overhauled and
everywhere put into as good a state of repair as the appliances
available would permit. The stores were found to be in a better
state than had been expected, and very little of the bread was
damaged. Gardens were laid out and planted with potatoes, melons,
pineapples, etc.; but Cook was not very sanguine of their success,
for he had seen how a vine planted by the Spaniards had been
spitefully trampled down, as the natives, tasting the grapes before
they were ripe, had concluded it was poisonous. It was carefully
pruned into proper shape again, and Omai was instructed to set
forth its merits and how it should be cultivated.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month a man reported that the two Spanish
ships had returned, and showed a piece of cloth he said he had
obtained from them, so Cook, not knowing if England and Spain were
on friendly terms, prepared for the worst, and the two ships made
ready for defence if necessary. Lieutenant Williamson was
despatched in a boat for news, but could see no ships, nor signs of
any having been on the coast since the English left their last port
of call.</p>

<p><b>A HUMAN SACRIFICE.</b>
</p>

<p>At their last visit an expedition was being prepared against the
revolted island of Eimeo, but it did not seem to have been very
successful in its object, for there were still disturbances going
on between the two nations, and on 30th August news came that the
Otaheitans had been driven up into the hills. A grand meeting was
held to discuss matters, and great efforts were made to enlist the
services of Cook; but he would not assist in any way, as he did not
understand the cause of the quarrel, and he had always found the
inhabitants of Eimeo friendly towards him. Having heard that a
chief named Towha had killed a man as a sacrifice to their God,
Cook obtained permission to witness the remaining ceremonies as he
thought it offered an opportunity to learn something of the
religion of this people. He therefore started with Dr. Anderson,
Mr. Webber, and the chief Potatow in a boat, accompanied by Omai in
a canoe, for the scene of action. On their arrival the sailors were
instructed to remain in the boat, and the gentlemen were requested
to remove their hats as soon as they reached the Morai where the
ceremonial was to take place. When they got there the body of the
victim was seen in a small canoe in front of the Morai and just in
the wash of the sea, in charge of four priests and their
attendants, the king and his party some twenty or thirty paces
away, and the rest of the spectators a little further still. Two
priests came forward to Otoo, one placing a young plantain tree in
front of him, and the other touching his foot with a bunch of red
feathers, and then rejoining the others, who immediately went off
to a smaller Morai near, and, seating themselves facing the sea,
one commenced reciting a long prayer, occasionally sending one of
his attendants to place a young plantain on the body. Whilst this
recitation was going on an attendant stood near holding two small
bundles "seemingly of cloth; in one, as we afterwards found, was
the Royal Maro, and the other, if I may be allowed the expression,
was the ark of the Eatua" [God].</p>

<p>This prayer being ended, the priests returned to the beach, and
more prayers were said, the plantains being moved, one by one, from
the body and placed in front of the priests. Then the body, wrapped
in leaves, was put on the beach, with the feet to the sea, and the
priests gathered round, some sitting, some standing, the prayers
still going on. The leaves were then stripped off the body, and it
was turned sideways on to the sea, and one priest standing at the
feet repeated another long prayer in which he was occasionally
joined by the others. Each priest at this time held in his hand a
bunch of the red feathers. Some hair was now pulled from the head
of the corpse, and an eye taken out, wrapped in leaves and
presented to Otoo, who did not touch them, but sent them back with
a bunch of feathers, soon after sending a second bunch he had asked
Cook to put in his pocket for him when starting. At this time a
king-fisher made a noise in some trees near, and Otoo remarked,
"That is the Eatua," evidently looking on it as a good omen.</p>

<p>The body was now moved away to the foot of one of the small
Morais, the two bundles of cloth being placed on the Morai at its
head and the tufts of feathers at its feet, the priests surrounding
the body and the people gathering in closer. More speeches were
made, and a second lock of hair plucked from the head and placed on
the Morai. Then the red feathers were placed on the cloth bundles,
which were carried over to the great Morai and laid against a pile
of stones, to which the body was also brought, and the attendants
proceeded to dig a grave, whilst the priests continued their
recitations. The body was then buried, and a dog Towha had sent
over (a very poor one, says Cook) was partially cooked and
presented to the priests, who called on Eatua to come and see what
was prepared for him, at the same time putting it on a small altar
on which were the remains of two dogs and three pigs, which smelt
so intolerably that the white men were compelled to move further
away than they wished. This ended the ceremony for the day.</p>

<p><b>THE KING'S MARO.</b>
</p>

<p>Next morning they all returned to the Morai; a pig was
sacrificed and placed on the same altar, and about eight o'clock
the priests, Otoo, and a great number of people assembled. The two
bundles were still in the same place as on the previous night, but
two drums were now standing in front of them between which Otoo and
Cook seated themselves. The priests, placing a plantain tree in
front of the king, resumed their praying, each having his bunch of
feathers in his hand. They then moved off to a place between the
Morai and the king and placed the feathers bunch by bunch on the
bundles, the prayers still going on. Four pigs were then produced,
one immediately killed, and the others put in a sty for future use.
The bundle containing the king's Maro was now untied and spread
carefully on the ground before the priests. The Maro was about five
yards long by fifteen inches broad, composed of red and yellow
feathers, chiefly yellow. At one end was a border of eight pieces
about the size and shape of horse-shoes fringed with black pigeon's
feathers; the other end was forked, the ends being of unequal
length. The feathers were arranged in two rows and had a very good
effect. They were fastened on a piece of native cloth, and then
sewn to the English pendant which Wallis left flying when he sailed
from Matavai Bay. After the priests had repeated another prayer,
the emblem of royalty was carefully folded up and replaced on the
Morai, and then one end of what Cook called the Ark of the Eatua
was opened, but the visitors were not permitted to see what it
contained. The entrails of the pig were then prayed over, and one
of the priests stirred them gently with a stick, evidently trying
to draw a favourable omen from their movements. They were then
thrown on the fire, the partly-cooked pig was deposited on the
altar, and when the bunches of feathers that had been used had been
placed in the Ark, the ceremony was over.</p>

<p>The meanings of all this could not be discovered, but it was
found that when a victim was wanted, a chief picked him out and
sent his servants to kill him. This was done without any warning to
the man who was to suffer, usually by a blow with a stone on the
head, and it appeared that at the subsequent ceremony the presence
of the king was absolutely indispensable. Chiefs of an enemy's
tribe who were killed in battle were buried with some state in the
Morais, the common men at the foot.</p>

<p>On the way back to the ship Cook called on Towha, who had
supplied the victim. He was anxious to ascertain Cook's opinion of
the affair, and was not pleased to learn that Cook thought such a
proceeding was more likely to offend the Deity than to please him.
He then enquired if the English ever practised such ceremonies, and
was very angry when he was informed that if the greatest chief in
England killed one of his men he would be hanged; and Cook says
they left him "with as great a contempt for our customs as we could
possibly have for theirs." The servants evidently listened to Omai
with great interest and a different opinion on the subject than
that of their master.</p>

<p>They went to inspect the body of a chief who had been embalmed;
they were not allowed to examine it very closely, but it was so
well done that they were unable to perceive the slightest
unpleasant smell, though the man had been dead some months. All
chiefs who died a natural death were preserved in this manner, and
from time to time were exposed to public view, the intervals
between the exposures gradually extending till at length they were
hardly ever seen. The method of preservation was not ascertained,
and was probably a secret of the priests.</p>

<p><b>EQUESTRIAN EXERCISE.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook and Clerke astonished the natives by riding the horses that
had been brought out; their progress through the country was always
watched with great interest, and Cook thought that this use of the
animals impressed the people more than anything else done by the
whites. Omai tried his powers on several occasions, but as he was
always thrown before he got securely into the saddle, his efforts
only produced entertainment for the spectators. It is curious to
note that forty years afterwards the people had so thoroughly lost
even the tradition of such use of the horse that Mr. Ellis relates
how, when one was landed for the use of Pomare, the natives
assisted to get it ashore, but when once landed they ran away and
hid in fear of the "man-carrying pig." About this time Cook
suffered from a bad attack of rheumatism in the legs, and was
successfully treated by Otoo's mother, three sisters, and eight
other women. The process he underwent, called Romy, consisted of
squeezing and kneading from head to foot, more especially about the
parts affected. Cook says he was glad to escape from their
ministrations after about a quarter of an hour, but he felt relief,
and, after submitting to four operations of the kind he was
completely cured.</p>

<p>Otoo was very desirous to send a present of a canoe to King
George, and Cook was very willing to take it, but when he found it
was a large double canoe he was obliged to decline from want of
space. As the desire to send it was quite spontaneous on Otoo's
part, and as the canoe was a very fine specimen of native work, the
refusal was given with great regret.</p>

<p>In a journal published by Newbery, the anonymous writer says
that two officers fought a duel whilst the ships were at Otaheite.
He does not give the cause, but says three shots were exchanged,
resulting in one hat being spoiled, and then the antagonists shook
hands and were better friends afterwards. The story is not
confirmed by any of the other journals.</p>

<p>On 29th September, after giving Otoo a short run out to sea and
back, the two ships sailed for the north side of Eimeo, arriving
the next day, and were greeted by a chief, Maheine, who was
bald-headed. Of this defect he seemed much ashamed, and always
appeared with his head covered with a sort of turban. Cook thinks
perhaps this shame rose from the fact that natives caught stealing
on the ships were often punished by having their heads shaved, and
adds that "one or two of the gentlemen whose heads were not
overburdened with hair, lay under violent suspicions of being titos
(thieves)."</p>

<p>One of the few remaining goats was stolen, but after threats of
serious reprisals was given up, together with the thief, who was
eventually discharged with a caution; but on a second one
disappearing and not being found after careful search, Cook felt
that he must make an example, or nothing would be safe, so he
ordered one or two houses and canoes to be destroyed, and sent word
to Maheine that he would not leave a canoe on the island if the
goat was not returned. The goat was recovered, and the next day the
people were as friendly as if nothing had occurred. Cook was
particularly annoyed, for he had sent a present of red feathers to
Otoo, and requested him to send in return a couple of goats to
Eimeo.</p>

<p><b>OMAI SETTLED.</b>
</p>

<p>On 11th October the ships sailed for Huaheine, and when they
arrived Cook was so ill he had to be landed from the ship, but he
makes no mention of it in his Journal. He thought this island would
be more suitable for Omai than Otaheite, and as Omai was agreeable
a piece of ground was obtained from the chief and a small house
erected and a garden laid out and planted. The interest of the
different chiefs of the neighbourhood was sought on Omai's behalf,
and as it was seen that some of the natives were inclined to take
advantage of his good nature, Cook let it be understood that if,
should he return and find Omai in an satisfactory condition, some
one would feel the weight of his displeasure. Then the most serious
thing that can be brought against Cook's treatment of the natives
occurred. In extenuation it must be remembered that he admits that
he was inclined to be hot-tempered, though it did not last; he had
been constantly irritated by repeated losses, and he was at the
time really seriously ill, and also when all was over he sincerely
regretted he had taken such strong measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayley's sextant was stolen from the observatory: Cook at
once demanded from the chiefs that it should be returned, but they
paid no attention. The thief, however, was pointed out, seized, and
taken on board ship; the sextant was recovered, but Cook says,
finding the thief to be "a hardened scoundrel, I punished him with
greater severity than I have ever done any one before, and then
dismissed him." He is said to have had his head shaved and his ears
cut off, but Gilbert (midshipman on the Discovery) says this was
not done till he had been rearrested for damaging Omai's garden,
trying to set fire to the house, and threatening to kill Omai as
soon as the ships left. Cook had intended to remove him from the
island, but, being in irons, he stole the keys from a sleeping
guard and made his escape. Omai found that many of the articles
which were practically useless to him, would be appreciated on the
ships, so he very wisely changed them for hatchets and other useful
articles. A notice of the visit with the names of the ships was cut
on the end of Omai's house, and, after firing a salute of five
guns, the ships sailed on 2nd November. Omai accompanied them for a
short way, and Mr. King says that when he parted from Cook he
completely broke down and cried all the way ashore. Cook speaks
well of him, saying he seldom had to find fault with him, that he
had many good qualities, but, like the rest of his race, he lacked
powers of observation, application, and perseverance.</p>

<p><b>DESERTIONS.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 3rd they were off Ulietea, and as they were able to run
in close to the shore a staging was erected, and the ballast ports
were opened so as to give the rats, which had become very
troublesome, a chance of going ashore. One of the marines also took
the opportunity to desert, taking his musket with him, but after a
little trouble was arrested; and having previously borne a very
good character, he was let off with a short imprisonment. A second
desertion occurred from the Discovery, Mr. Mouat, midshipman, and a
seaman getting away. Cook says the affair gave him more trouble
than both men were worth, but he insisted on getting them back to
prevent others following their example, and "to save the son of a
brother officer from being lost to the world." They were found to
have gone off in a canoe to another island, and Cook ordered Clerke
to detain the chief, his son, daughter, and son-in-law on the
Discovery, where they had gone to dine, and to inform them they
would be kept as hostages till the runaways were returned. Three
days afterwards the deserters were brought back, and the hostages
were at once released. It was afterwards found out that there had
been a plot to seize Cook in retaliation, when he went for his
usual bath in the evening, but, as it happened, he was so much
worried that he put it off and so escaped. Burney notes that Cook
could not swim. Before leaving they received a message from Omai,
saying he was all right, but asking for another goat as one of his
was dead. Clerke was able to oblige him with two kids, one of each
sex.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17. 1777 TO 1779. THIRD VOYAGE CONTINUED.</h2>

<p>In case of separation, Clerke was ordered to cruise for five
days near where his consort had been last seen, and then to steer
for New Albion (so-called by Sir Francis Drake), endeavouring to
fall in with it about latitude 45 degrees North, and there cruise
for ten days; then, if his consort was not picked up, to proceed
north to the first suitable port and recruit his men, keeping a
good look-out for his companion. Then he was to sail on 1st April
to 56 degrees North, and again cruise about fifteen leagues from
the coast till 10th May, when he was to proceed north and endeavour
to find a passage to the Atlantic, according to the Admiralty
instructions already in his hands. If unsuccessful he was to winter
in some suitable port of Kamtschatka, leaving word with the
commandant of St. Peter and St. Paul Harbour, where he was to be
found, and to be at the last-named place not later than 10th May of
the following year. Then, if he had no news of the Resolution, he
was to follow out the Admiralty instructions to the best of his
ability.</p>

<p>The two ships left for Bolabola on 7th December to get an anchor
left by De Bougainville, in order to make hatchets for exchange, as
the demand had been so great their stock was running short. They
had no difficulty in purchasing it, and it was good enough for
their purpose, though not so heavy as they expected.</p>

<p>They crossed the line on the 23rd in longitude 203 degrees 15
minutes East without having seen land since leaving Bolabola. Two
days after they picked up a low island and managed to get some
turtle, and also a rather unsatisfactory observation of an eclipse
of the sun, the clouds interfering with the view of the
commencement. Their position had been settled by other
observations, so the ill-luck was unimportant. About three hundred
turtle were obtained, averaging from 90 to 100 pounds each, and as
much fish as they could consume during their stay was caught.
Coconuts, yams, and melons were planted, and the island received
the name of Christmas Island.</p>

<p><b>SANDWICH ISLANDS.</b>
</p>

<p>Leaving on 2nd January they did not sight land till the Sandwich
Islands were reached, in latitude 21 degrees 12 minutes 30 seconds
North. At the second one seen, called Atoui by the natives, they
were quickly surrounded by canoes; the occupants, very like the
Otaheitans in appearance and language, were armed with stones,
which they threw overboard as soon as they found they were not
likely to be wanted, and though none could be persuaded to come on
board the ships, they freely parted with fish for anything they
could get in exchange. As the ships sailed on, more canoes came out
bringing further supplies, and Cook rejoiced at arriving at a land
of plenty, for his stock of turtle was just finished, and he was
anxious to save his sea stores. At length some were tempted on
board, and were greatly astonished at what they saw, but their
wonder did not last long, and stealing soon broke out as usual.
When they came to an anchor Cook landed and found a favourable
place for watering, so a party was set to work the next day, and
found no difficulty in getting assistance from the islanders,
whilst at the same time a brisk trade was carried on in pigs and
potatoes. Cook says: "No people could trade with more honesty than
these people, never once attempting to cheat us, either ashore or
alongside the ship." They seem to have dropped their thieving very
quickly. At night a nasty sea got up, and as Cook did not like the
position of his ship he weighed to run a little further out, but
the wind suddenly dropping round to the east, he had to set all
sail to clear the shore. For a day or two no very satisfactory
anchorage could be found, and the weather was rather unsettled, so,
making one of the chiefs a present of an English sow and boar, and
a male and two female goats, the ship bore away to the
northwards.</p>

<p>According to Baron von Humboldt these islands were discovered by
a Spaniard, Gaetano, sailing from Manilla to Acapulco in 1542, and
it was one of the few discoveries made by the Spaniards during this
passage, for they were strictly forbidden to deviate from the track
laid down on their charts. The name La Mesa (the table) down on the
chart Cook had with him, describes the island, says Burney, but the
longitude is several degrees out. It is undoubtedly a fact that
Europeans had been at the islands previously to Cook's visit, for
at least two pieces of iron were found, one being a portion of a
broad-sword and the other a piece of hoop-iron.</p>

<p><b>NEW ALBION.</b>
</p>

<p>On 7th March, New Albion was sighted at a distance of ten or
twelve leagues, and the position of the ship at noon was 44 degrees
33 minutes North, 236 degrees 30 minutes East; Cook's orders were
to make the coast "about 45 degrees North," so they may be said to
have been carried out with fair exactness. Cook says that on the
charts he had, a large entrance or strait was represented, and in
the account of Martin d'Aguilar's voyage in 1603 mention is made of
a large river, near where he struck the coast, but he did not see
any signs of either. Proceeding up the coast the progress was very
slow as the weather was very stormy. On 22nd March they passed the
position of the strait of Juan de Fuch, but again no sign of its
existence was seen. On the 29th the style of the coast changed, and
high snowy mountains with well-wooded valleys running down to the
sea came into view, and at length Hope Bay opened out. Here they
came in contact with the first natives they had seen, who put off
in their canoes to the ships, showing signs neither of fear nor
distrust. At first they appeared mild and inoffensive, and would
trade anything they had with them; but when they got used to the
ships it turned out that they were adepts at thieving; no piece of
iron, brass, or copper was safe. Fish-hooks were cut from the lines
and boats were stripped of their fittings. They sold bladders of
oil for the lamps, and it was found that they were often partly
filled with water, but this was winked at in order to get on a
thoroughly friendly footing. This being a favourable opportunity to
put the two vessels in order and to give the crews a spell of rest
ashore, a good anchorage was sought out, and the observatory set
up. On 4th April, whilst wood and water was being got in, the
natives, who had given no trouble beyond their stealing, were
observed to be arming, and precautions were taken, but the Indians
explained that their preparations were made against some of their
own countrymen who were on their way to fight them. After a time
some canoes made their appearance, and on a deputation going out to
meet them a discussion took place, and some sort of an agreement
was made between the two parties, but the newcomers were not
allowed to approach the ships nor to join in the trading.</p>

<p>The stay here was longer than was intended, for the Resolution's
fore and mizzen masts were found to be very defective, and her
rigging had got into a very bad state. The fore-mast was repaired
and the mizzen replaced with a new stick, and when a great deal of
work had been done this proved faulty, and a second one had to be
cut. New standing rigging was fitted to the main-mast, and a set
made from the best of the old, for the fore-mast. When the heaviest
part of this work was completed Cook visited the country about King
George's Sound, and was courteously received at a village by the
natives, to most of whom he was known. Here he found the women
employed making dresses out of bark in much the same way as that
employed by the New Zealanders. Sending some sailors to cut grass
for the sheep and goats he had left, the natives made a claim which
was at once satisfied; but when the men were ordered to go on
cutting, fresh claimants sprung up, till Cook says he thought each
blade of grass had a separate owner. When at last the natives found
that they could get no more, the cutting was allowed to go on
without the slightest further objection.</p>

<p><b>PUNCH AND THE DEVIL.</b>
</p>

<p>The people are described as being short, with broad flat faces,
high cheek-bones, swarthy complexions, and no pretensions to good
looks. Burney says that it was only after much cleaning that their
skins were found to be "like our people in England." Cook says they
were docile, courteous, and good-natured, but liable to fits of
passion.</p>

<p>"I have often seen a man rave and scold for more than half an
hour without any one taking the least notice of it, nor could any
one of us tell who it was he was abusing."</p>

<p>Burney describes their language as harsh, and when in a warm
discussion, apparently insufficient, and then they had to eke it
out with such nods and jumps as reminded one of "Punch and the
Devil." Their clothing was chiefly made of skins, and a kind of
cloth made from fibre or wool and hair, or a mixture of both. "In
these clothes and a coarse mat and straw hat they would sit in
their canoes in the heaviest rain as unconcernedly as if they were
in perfect shelter." Their houses of logs and boards made by
splitting large trees, were some as much as 150 feet long by 20 to
30 feet wide, and 7 or 8 feet high; they were divided into two
compartments, each apparently the property of one family. The roof
was of loose planks, which they moved about so as to let the light
fall where it was wanted. Cook judged these were only summer
residences, and that they had better houses inland. The furniture
consisted of a few boxes, some wooden vessels for their food, and a
few mat bags. Their cooking was fairly good, but excessively dirty,
and their persons and houses "filthy as hogs' sties." They often
had two wooden figures in their houses resembling human figures, of
which they spoke mysteriously; but as they could have been
purchased in every case for a small quantity of old iron or brass,
they could not have been much venerated. Their arms were bows and
arrows, slings, spears, and a small club of wood or stone,
something like the New Zealander's patoo, and a stone tomahawk, the
handle fashioned like a human head, the stone cutting-part being a
large tongue, and they were decorated with human hair. The
defensive armour was a double cloak of hide, usually moose,
serviceable against arrows or spears, but they were greatly
surprised to see a bullet fired through a cloak folded four times.
The only vegetables obtained were a few nettles and wild garlic,
but Burney says that at the back of the village was a plantation of
cherry trees, gooseberries and currants, raspberries and
strawberries, "but unluckily for us none of them in season." On
20th April a man who had been allowed to go into Cook's cabin, made
off with his watch, and got away from the ship. Fortunately his
canoe was seen alongside the Discovery, and notice being given a
search was made, and the watch found in a box unharmed. Such a loss
would have been serious. Two old-fashioned silver table-spoons,
supposed to be Spanish, and a pewter wash-basin were purchased from
the Indians.</p>

<p><b>RESOLUTION LEAKS.</b>
</p>

<p>On 26th April a start was made, and before leaving, an Indian,
who had specially attached himself to Cook, gave him a valuable
beaver skin, and was so pleased with the return present he received
that he insisted on Cook taking from him a beaver cloak upon which
he had always set great store. In return "he was made as happy as a
prince by a gift of a new broadsword with a brass hilt." The next
day, when well clear of the land, a perfect hurricane arose, and
the ships lay to, heading to the south-east. The Resolution sprang
a leak, and the water could be seen and heard rushing in, but after
some little anxiety one pump was found to be sufficient to keep the
upper hand. The gale lasted two days, but on the second they were
able to get an observation which gave the position of the ship as
50 degrees 1 minute North, 229 degrees 26 minutes East, about
opposite to where the Straits of de Fonte were marked on his chart.
They were now able to run along the coast and see and name the most
salient points, but time was too valuable to make any halts by the
way. The land appeared to be of considerable height, the hills
covered with snow, but near the sea, well wooded. Mount St. Elias
was sighted 4th May, at a distance of forty leagues, and on the 6th
they arrived in the bay in which Behring had anchored, so his name
was given to it on the chart. Here the land trended away to the
west; the wind was westerly and light, and consequently their
progress was very slow. Landing on an island to try to get a view
of the other side from the top of a hill, it was found so steep and
thickly wooded he had to give up the attempt. He therefore left a
bottle containing some coins given him by his friend, Dr. Kaye, and
named the island after him. Here they found currant and strawberry
plants, but the season was too early for fruit.</p>

<p>Near Cape Hinchinbroke Gore went off to an island to shoot, but
seeing two large canoes containing about twenty Indians, he thought
it wiser to return to the ship. He was followed up, but none of the
natives would come on board, and after a time intimating they would
return next day, retired. Two men in small canoes did return during
the night, but finding that every one on board was not asleep, beat
a hurried retreat. The next day the ships got into a better
position, and more Indians turned up, with whom they had little
difficulty in entering into trading relations; but as they desired
pieces of iron about ten inches long by three wide, and it was
rather a scarce article on board, very little, chiefly skins, was
purchased. At first only one man came on board, and as he saw only
two or three people on the Discovery, he went to the Resolution and
brought over some of his friends, who rushed the deck with their
knives drawn. However, the crew quickly ran up with their cutlasses
ready, so the natives retired, remarking that the white men's
knives were longer than theirs. At the Resolution they broke every
glass scuttle they could reach with their paddles, says Burney.
Cook points out that they must have been quite ignorant of the use
of firearms, and concludes by saying:</p>

<p>"However, after all these tricks, we had the good fortune to
leave them as ignorant as we found them, for they neither heard nor
saw a musket fired unless at birds."</p>

<p>The leak on the Resolution was attended to, and in places the
oakum caulking was found to have disappeared completely; one writer
says it was caused by rats, and that the ship was saved by rubbish
having choked up the leak.</p>

<p><b>TWO SETS OF TEETH.</b>
</p>

<p>Bad weather detaining them, Cook had an opportunity of studying
the inhabitants. He had with him a description of the Esquimaux, by
Crantz, and found these men to be very similar in appearance,
dress, and appliances. They all had the bottom lip slit
horizontally, giving them the appearance of having two mouths. In
these slits pieces of bone were fixed to which were tied other
pieces, forming a great impediment to their speech, and in some
cases giving the idea that the wearer had two sets of teeth. Some
also had pieces of bone, cord, or beads run through the cartilage
of the nose, and all had their faces plentifully smeared with black
and red paint.</p>

<p>After examining an inlet, which received the name of Sandwich
Sound, they got away, steering to the south-west past Cape
Elizabeth, sighted on that Princess's birthday, which they hoped
would prove the western extremity of the coast, but on getting
round, land was reported further on to the west-south-west, and a
gale sprang up, forcing them off their course. In two days they
worked back again, discovering more land behind what they had seen
already. This Cook believed to be Cape Saint Hermogenes mentioned
by Behring, but his chart was so inaccurate he could not positively
identify it, or any other place mentioned on it. Cape Douglas,
after the Dean of Windsor, was named, and placed in 58 degrees 56
minutes North, 206 degrees 10 minutes East; and the next day a high
point in a range was called Mount St. Augustine, after the saint
whose day it happened to be. They then worked into an estuary
formed by the rivers (one being afterwards named Cook's River, by
orders of Lord Sandwich), in order to satisfy some of the officers
who thought there might be a possible communication with Hudson's
Bay. A good supply of very fine salmon was obtained from natives in
the neighbourhood, and Cook formed the opinion that a paying fur
trade might be opened up as the skins offered were of considerable
value.</p>

<p>Working slowly up the coast they passed through the islands off
Quelpart on the 18th, when the Discovery signalled to speak; a boat
was sent, and returned with a small box curiously tied up with
neatly-made twine. It had been delivered on board by an Indian, who
first attracted attention by displaying a pair of old plush
breeches and a black cloth waistcoat, and when he came on board,
took off his cap and bowed like a European. The box was found to
contain a paper written in Russian, but unfortunately the only
things that could be understood were the two dates, 1776 and 1778.
It was supposed to have been written by a Russian trader, and given
to the Indian to place it on board the first ship he met with.</p>

<p>On the 20th, in 54 degrees 18 minutes North, 195 degrees 45
minutes East, a volcano throwing out dense smoke was observed; and
in the afternoon they received a visit from a man who had evidently
been in contact with Europeans, for he was wearing green cloth
breeches and a stuff jacket. He took off his cap and bowed as the
visitor to the Discovery had done, but unfortunately they were
unable to understand his language.</p>

<p>On 26th June they had a narrow escape during a thick fog, when
it was not possible to see anything a hundred yards away. Breakers
were heard, so the anchors were let go and fortunately held. An
hour or so after the fog lifted, and they found themselves about
three-quarters of a mile from a rocky island, having passed between
two elevated rocks, a place through with, Cook says, "I should have
ventured on a clear day," for all that they found themselves in
"such an anchoring place that I could not have chosen a
better."</p>

<p><b>ANDERSON DIES.</b>
</p>

<p>On 27th June they were off the island of Onalaschka, and came
across a party of natives who were towing two whales they had
killed; they were somewhat shy, but had evidently seen ships
before, and were more polite than those previously met with. One
was upset from his canoe, and Cook took him down into the cabin and
provided him with dry clothes; "he dressed himself with as much
ease as I could have done." His clothes were of birds' skins, the
feathers inside, and patched in places with silk, and over all he
wore a sort of shirt of whale's intestine, which, secured round the
edge of the hole in which he sat in his canoe, rendered him
practically waterproof. Whilst in this neighbourhood they received
a second letter in Russian, but having no one on board who could
translate, it was returned with some presents to the bearer, who
retired bowing his thanks. After some detention from fogs and
adverse winds they got away once more and pushed slowly northwards.
On 3rd August Mr. Anderson the surgeon, who had been ill for some
months, died, and Cook, having named an island, sighted soon after
his death, Anderson's Island, "to perpetuate the memory of the
deceased, for whom I had a very great regard," appointed Mr. Law to
the Resolution and Mr. Samwell to the Discovery as surgeons.</p>

<p>On 9th August, Cape Prince of Wales, 65 degrees 46 minutes
North, 191 degrees 45 minutes East, was sighted, and they believed
it to be the most westerly point of North America. They landed on
what, from Heydinger's Chart, was the eastern end of the island of
Alaska, but it afterwards was found to be the eastern extremity of
Asia. This chart, says Burney, was found "not only to be incorrect
but almost unintelligible." The country was very desolate, neither
tree nor shrub to be seen, and the inhabitants seemed afraid of
their visitors, though not absolutely unfriendly. They were taller
and stouter than those on the American side, and their clothing
very superior.</p>

<p>The ships fell in with the ice blink on the 17th, in 70 degrees
33 minutes North, 197 degrees 41 minutes East, rather earlier than
had been expected, and soon afterwards with the ice itself in the
shape of a large field extending as far as the eye could reach from
west to east. Here they got a supply of fresh meat in the shape of
sea-horse, of which animal they killed a good many. The flesh was
fishy and indifferent eating, but Cook says anything was preferable
to salt meat.</p>

<p>They still slowly but steadily pushed north along the American
shore, but, being hampered by fog and ice, they crossed over to the
west side with no better fortune, for on the 26th they found
themselves embayed in the field with large quantities of heavy
loose ice along the edges. Having sighted Cape North on 29th
August, Cook decided the season was too far advanced, and that it
would be better to proceed to winter quarters, and accordingly ran
down the Asiatic coast in search of wood and water, of which he
stood in need; but was disappointed, and making over to the other
side was fortunate to find a considerable quantity of driftwood
which served his purpose. Before leaving the straits, Cook
remarks:</p>

<p>"In justice to Behring's memory, I must say he delineated this
coast very well, and fixed the latitude and longitude of the points
better than could be expected from the methods he had to go
by."</p>

<p><b>SALMON PIE.</b>
</p>

<p>Anchoring in Norton Sound, Cook sent away the boats to explore,
and set to work to determine between the correctness of the chart
drawn by Stocklin and his own observations, and after a series of
no less than seventy-seven sets of observations he was able to show
that Stocklin was wrong. It was at this place that he decided to
winter in the Sandwich Islands, as a port in Kamtschatka would
oblige his crews to remain idle for nearly six months before
further exploration to the north could be undertaken. The course
was now set for Samgoonoodha Harbour, but they did not arrive there
till 3rd October, having met with very heavy weather, in which the
Resolution again began to leak badly. On 8th September an Indian
brought a singular present in the form of a pie made like a loaf,
containing some highly seasoned salmon, accompanied by a letter in
Russian. In return Corporal Ledyard of the Marines, "an intelligent
man," was sent with a few bottles of rum, wine, and porter, to
obtain further information, and with orders, if he met with any
Russians, he was to "make them understand that we were English,
Friends, and Allies." On the 10th Ledyard returned, bringing three
Russian sailors, but as there was no interpreter there was
difficulty in understanding anything thoroughly. One of the
newcomers was understood to say he had been out with Behring, but
Cook thought he was too young. They appeared to have great respect
for that officer, and Ledyard said he had seen a sloop which he
understood was his ship. They stayed on the Resolution all night,
and promised to return with a chart of the islands that lay between
that place and Kamtschatka. It was understood that there were
several settlements in the immediate neighbourhood employing
altogether about four hundred Russians.</p>

<p><b>LETTERS TO LONDON.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 14th Cook and Webber were at an Indian village a short
distance from the ships, when they saw a canoe arrive containing
three men and accompanied by some twenty or thirty single canoes. A
tent was rigged up for one of the first three, a Russian named
Ismyloff (Ismailoff) the chief trader of the district, whilst the
others made shelters of their canoes and grass, and so all were
independent of the Indians. Ismailoff invited Cook to join him at
his meal, which consisted of dried salmon and berries, and some
sort of conversation was carried on by means of signs and figures.
Ismailoff proved to be well acquainted with the geography of the
district, and pointed out several errors in the modern maps. He
said he had been with Lieutenant Lindo's expedition as far north as
Tchukotskoi Nos, and saw Clerke's Island; but when he could or
would not say what else they had done during the two years the
expedition was out, Cook began to have doubts. He also said the
Russians had several times tried to gain a footing on the American
shore, but the Indians had driven them off with the loss of two or
three of their leaders. He also spoke of a sledge expedition in
1773 to three islands opposite the Kolyma River, which Cook thought
might be the one mentioned by Muller, he related that he had
sailed, in 1771, from a Russian settlement called Bolscheretski, in
the Kurile Islands, to Japan, but the ship was ordered away because
they were Christians, so they went to Canton and sailed on a French
ship to France, and from thence he went to Petersburg, and was then
sent out again. He was quite clear as to his dates, and put them on
paper; but as he was perfectly ignorant of any French, "not even
the names of the commonest articles," though he had been such a
long time amongst French people, Cook was again inclined to be
sceptical. He stayed all night, dining with Clerke, and returned
again on the 19th, with charts, which he permitted to be copied,
and some manuscripts. One chart showed the Asiatic coast as far as
41 degrees North, with the Kurile Islands and Kamtschatka, and the
second, the more interesting to the English, showed the discoveries
made by the Russians to the east of Kamtschatka, exclusive of the
voyages of Behring and Tcherikoff. Cook found the longitudes in
places were very different from those on the Russian maps, and was
afraid the mistake might be carried through, but the latitudes were
fairly correct. As far as he could ascertain, the instrument used
for the survey had been the theodolite. Before leaving, Ismailoff
gave Cook letters for the Governor of Kamtschatka and the
Commandant of Petropaulowsk; and Cook, finding "he was tolerably
well versed in astronomy," gave him a Hadley's octant, and though
it was the first one he had seen, he soon made himself acquainted
with its uses. A letter to the English Admiralty was also entrusted
to him to be forwarded via Petersburg, as opportunity might offer.
This letter and a chart of the northern coasts was delivered in
London the following year.</p>

<p>On 26th October the two ships got away, and, in case of
separation, Clerke was given his rendezvous, first, the Sandwich
Islands, and second, Petropaulowsk in the middle of May. On 28th
the discovery met with a nasty accident during a gale; the fore and
main tacks carried away, killing one man, and seriously injuring
the boatswain and two others. On 25th November the islands were
sighted, and the customary orders as to the officers appointed to
trade with the natives were issued, and no curiosities were to be
purchased before the ships had received satisfactory supplies. They
first called in at Mowee, where the natives soon came out and
appeared friendly, and traded with less suspicion than any of the
South Sea Islanders they had met with before.</p>

<p>Having procured a quantity of sugar-cane, Cook ordered it to be
used in brewing, as he found a strong decoction of the juice
produced a wholesome and palatable beer, and would enable him to
save the spirits for the colder climates. However, the crews would
have none of it, so Cook and his officers made use of it whenever
cane was procurable, and gave himself:</p>

<p>"no trouble either to oblige or persuade them to drink it,
knowing there was no danger of scurvy so long as we had plenty of
other vegetables, but that I might not be disappointed in my views,
I gave orders that no grog should be served in either ship." He
then goes on to say: "Every innovation whatever, tho' ever so much
to their advantage, is sure to meet with the highest disapprobation
from seaman. Portable soup and sour kraut were at first both
condemned by them as stuff not fit for human beings to eat. Few men
have introduced into their ships more novelties in the way of
victuals and drink than I have done; indeed, few men have had the
same opportunity or been driven to the same necessity. It has,
however, in a great measure been owing to such little innovations
that I have always kept my people, generally speaking, free from
that dreadful distemper, the Scurvy."</p>

<p>This extract shows how bitterly Cook felt the stupid ingratitude
of his men for the constant care he took of them, and is one of the
very few passages in his Journals in which he speaks in their
disfavour. This, curiously, was erased by some unknown hand; King
asserts it must have been done by Gore, as he is certain it was not
by either Cook or Clerke, who took command after Cook's death.</p>

<p><b>FAULTY SAILS.</b>
</p>

<p>In trying to weather the south-east end of Mowee in heavy
weather, the leach ropes of the main topsail and two topgallant
sails gave way, and the sails were blown to pieces. Cook says,
"neither the cordage, canvas, nor indeed hardly any other stores
used in the Navy, are equal in quality to those in general use in
the merchant service"; and he relates how such failures have
constantly resulted in "infinite trouble, vexation, and loss." He
illustrates his complaint by the fact that rigging, blocks, and
sails that were purchased with his ship, although they had been
fourteen months in use, wore longer than any of the things of the
same kind put on board new from the king's stores.</p>

<p>On 24th December they succeeded in getting to windward of the
island, but the signal to the Discovery to tack having been omitted
she stood on, and it was some days before she rejoined company.
January 1779 was ushered in with heavy rain, but clearing away
before noon they were able to approach to about five miles from the
shore, where they lay to and traded with the natives. The next
three days were spent working slowly down the coast and keeping a
good look-out for their consort, occasionally stopping to do a
little trading with the islanders, some of whom came as much as
fifteen miles out to them. The chief article of commerce was salt,
which was of very good quality. On the 5th January the southern
point of Owhyhee was rounded, and they lay off a large village,
where they were quickly surrounded by canoes laden "with hogs and
women": the latter are not held up as patterns of all the virtues.
Vegetables seemed to be scarce, and Cook concluded that either the
land could not produce them, or the crops had been destroyed by
volcanic action, very recent traces of which were to be seen.</p>

<p>"Wednesday 6th January 1779. The next morning the people visited
us again, bringing with them the same articles as before. Being
near the shore I sent Mr. Bligh, the Master, in a boat to sound the
coast, with orders to land and look for fresh water. On his return
he reported that at two cable lengths from the shore he had no
soundings with a 160 fathoms of line; that when he landed he found
no fresh water, but rain water lying in holes in the rocks, and
that brackish with the spray of the sea, and that the surface of
the country was wholly composed of large slags and ashes, here and
there partly covered with plants. Between 10 and 11 o'clock we saw
the Discovery coming round the south point of the Island and at 1
P.M. she joined us, when Captain Clerke came on board and informed
me that he had cruised four or five days where we were separated
and then plyed round the last part of the Island, but meeting with
unfavourable winds, was carried some distance from the coast. He
had one of the islanders on board all the time; it was his own
choice, nor did not leave them the first opportunity that
offered."</p>

<p>This is the last entry made by Cook in the Journal he was
preparing for publication, and is a fair sample of the manner in
which the entire Journal was written, and certainly does not
justify the sneers that have been uttered about bad grammar and
spelling, the double negative notwithstanding. In handwriting,
spelling, and grammar he can compare well with his press either in
the Navy or civil life; and many of the examples of bad spelling
given have been abbreviations common in the Navy, which his critics
did not understand.</p>

<p><b>KARAKAKOA BAY.</b>
</p>

<p>On 17th January they anchored in Karakakoa Bay, where large
numbers of canoes laden with provisions for sale came out; Cook
estimates that at one time there were no less than a thousand round
the ship, their occupants entirely unarmed. They soon proved to be
adepts at thieving; one man stole the rudder of a boat, so Cook
ordered a shot or two to be fired over the escaping thief, but "as
it was not intended that any of the shot should take effect, the
Indians seemed rather more surprised than frightened," and the man
got away. The lids of the Resolution's coppers were stolen, and the
discovery had her rigging much cut about for the sake of the iron.
The decks were so crowded with the natives that Burney says it kept
a quarter of the crew hard at work to make room for the working of
the ship.</p>

<p><b>AN INSECURE POSITION.</b>
</p>

<p>The last entry made by Cook in his Ship's Journal, and probably
the last words he ever wrote, runs as follows:</p>

<p>"Sunday 17. Fine pleasant weather and variable faint breezes of
wind. In the evening Mr. Bligh returned and reported that he had
found a bay in which was good anchorage and fresh water, tolerable
easy to come at. Into this bay I resolved to go to refit the ships
and take in water. As the night approached, the Indians retired to
the shore, a good [many] however desired to sleep on board,
curiosity was not their only motive, at least not with some of
them, for the next morning several things were missing, which
determined me not to entertain so many another night. At 11 A.M.
anchored in the bay which is called by the natives [a blank, filled
in by another hand, Karakakoa] in 13 fathoms of water over a sandy
bottom, and a quarter of a mile from the North-East shore. In this
situation the South point of the bay bore South &frac14; West, and
the North point West &frac14; South. Moored with the stream anchor
to the Northward. Unbent the sails and struck yards and topmasts.
The ships very much crowded with Indians and surrounded by a
multitude of canoes. I have nowhere in this sea seen such a number
of people assembled at one place, besides those in the canoes, all
the shore of the bay was covered with people and hundreds were
swimming about the ships like shoals of fish. We should have found
it difficult to have kept them in order had not a chief or servant
of Terreeoboo's, named Parea, now and then [shown] his authority by
turning or rather driving them all out of the ship.</p>

<p>"Among our numerous visitors was a man named Touahah, who we
soon found belonged to the church; he introduced himself with much
ceremony, in the course of which he presented me with a small pig,
two coconuts and a piece of red cloth which he wrapped round me. In
this manner all or most of the chiefs introduced themselves, but
this man went further, he brought with him a large hog and a
quantity of fruits and roots, all of which he included in the
present. In the afternoon I went ashore to view the place
accompanied by Touahah, Parea, Mr. King and others; as soon as we
landed Touahah took me by the hand and conducted me to a large
Morai, the other gentlemen with Parea, and four or five more of the
natives followed."</p>

<p>Mr. King describes this Morai as being about forty yards long by
twenty broad, and about fourteen feet high, the top flat, well
paved, and surrounded by a wooden railing. An old building stood in
the centre from which a stone wall ran to the fence dividing the
top into two parts. On the landward side were five poles upwards of
twenty feet high, supporting an irregular kind of scaffold, and on
the sea-side half were two small houses with a covered
communication between. On their arrival Cook was presented with two
ugly images wrapped with red cloth, and a sort of hymn was sung.
Then they were marched to the scaffolding, where was a table on
which lay fruits and vegetables surmounted by a very much
decomposed pig, and in a semicircle round one end of this table
were twelve images. Placing Cook near the scaffolding, Koah, as
King and others call Touahah, took up the pig and holding it
towards him made a long speech. Then, dropping the offensive
porker, he made signs that the two were to climb on to the
uncertain scaffolding. This being done, a procession came forward
bearing a live hog and a piece of red cloth. This last article was
handed up to Koah, who proceeded to wrap it round Cook, who was
clinging to his elevated but not very safe position. The pig was
then offered to Cook and a long address chanted. The two principal
performers then descended and returned to the table, Koah snapping
his fingers at the figures and making what appeared to be sarcastic
remarks, till he came to the centre one, when he prostrated himself
and kissed it, requesting Cook to do the same. The party then
proceeded to the other part of the Morai, and Cook was seated
between two images with his arms stretched out, one upheld by Koah,
the other by King. A cooked pig and other food was then presented
with much ceremony, the meat cut up and kava prepared; whilst
Koah's assistant chewed some coconut, wrapped it in cloth, and then
rubbed it over Cook's face, head, shoulders, and arms. Koah and
Parea then pulled pieces of the pig and put them into the mouths of
the two officers. King says that Parea was a particularly cleanly
person, so he did not so much mind this feeding, but Cook,
remembering how Koah had handled the putrid hog, was unable to
swallow a mouthful, "and his reluctance, as may be supposed, was
not diminished, when the old man, according to his own mode of
civility, had chewed it for him." Cook then put an end to further
proceedings by distributing some presents to the attendants and
returning to the ship.</p>

<p>Though the meaning of this ceremony could only be a matter of
conjecture, it was very evident that it was intended as a mark of
high respect to the person of Captain Cook. The title of Orono
given to him, and often quoted as evidence that he had permitted
himself to be looked upon as a god by the natives was also given to
one, if not more, of their own chiefs; and Burney says that the
marks of honour conferred on him were exactly the same as those
conferred on any one of their own superior chieftains. The
grotesque description given by some of the missionary writers of
the whole population crawling after him on hands and knees as a
mark of adoration is utterly untrue, for Mr. King, who was ashore
almost the whole time of the ship's stay, and was continually with
Cook, distinctly says:</p>

<p>"The crowd which had collected on the shore, retired at our
approach; and not a person was to be seen, except a few lying
prostrate on the ground, near the huts of the adjoining
village."</p>

<p>None of those who were on the voyage and have left any record
behind them, suggest that Cook was treated in any respect otherwise
than as a great chief and a man.</p>

<p>A small potato field was placed under tabu, near the Morai, for
the purpose of the observatory, and a camp under the command of
King was established there. This camp was daily supplied with meat
and vegetables, even more than could be consumed, and several
canoe-loads were sent off to the ships. After enquiry it was found
that the whole expense of this food was borne by Koah, and no
return whatever was demanded.</p>

<p><b>A ROYAL VISIT.</b>
</p>

<p>A tabu was placed on the whole of the bay on the 24th, and
trading came to a complete standstill, the reason given being the
coming of the king, Terreeoboo. He arrived the next day, and
commerce at once revived. He paid a private visit, with his wife
and children, to the Resolution, remaining on board some time, and
proved to be the same chief they had seen at the Island of Mowee.
The next day he, accompanied by several important chiefs, all
dressed in rich feather cloaks and armed with long spears and
daggers, paid a state visit. Koah was also present in a canoe with
other priests and two large basket-work idols, whose distorted
faces were adorned with pearl-shell eyes and dog's teeth; he was
attended by two other canoes, one filled with pigs and vegetables,
and these paddled round the ships, the priests singing "in most
solemn fashion," and returned to the shore. Cook followed; King
turned out the guard and saluted Terreeoboo, and then conducted him
to the tent, where, after seating himself for a few moments, he
took off his helmet and cloak and placed them on Cook, at the same
time ordering five or six more, of great value, to be placed at his
feet. Hogs, bread-fruit, etc., were then brought in. Cook and
Terreeoboo exchanged names as a peculiar mark of friendship, and
the ceremony ended by the presentation of the two boat-loads of
provisions by a deputation of the priests. One of those present was
a nephew of the king, called by the English Maiha-Maiha, afterwards
known to the world as Kamehameha I.</p>

<p>As many of the chiefs as the Resolution's pinnace would hold
were taken off with the king to the ship, and the latter was duly
invested with a white linen shirt and Cook's own sword. During the
whole of this performance no canoes excepting those actually
engaged were to be seen in the bay, and all the natives remained
lying on the ground or in their houses. Clerke, who had been too
ill to share in these ceremonies, landed for the first time on the
28th, and, though quite unexpected, he received a very handsome
present of food, and Terreeoboo paid the Discovery a state call,
taking with him presents similar to those given to Cook. In the
afternoon he paid a second (private) call in a small canoe with
three paddles, one of which he wielded himself. On this occasion
there were no prostrations, but if any native met his chief he
simply got out of the way unless some service was required of
him.</p>

<p>The ships were running very short of firewood, and as there was
none growing less than a mile and a half off the sea, Mr. King was
ordered to try and purchase the fence surrounding the top of the
Morai. He hesitated, as he thought that:</p>

<p>"even the bare mention of it might be considered by them [the
priests] as a piece of shocking impiety. In this, however, I found
myself mistaken. Not the smallest surprise was expressed at the
application, and the wood was readily given, even without
stipulating for anything in return."</p>

<p>He saw the sailors were carrying away the figures as well, and
spoke to Koah on the subject, who raised no objection, except with
regard to the centre one, which was at once returned. Burney says
that two launch-loads for each ship were obtained, "a seasonable
supply, as we had been four months since we wooded."</p>

<p>On 31st January Whatman, one of the gunner's crew, and greatly
attached to Cook, died and was buried in the Morai. Besant thinks
that this had some influence on the minds of the natives, and may
have contributed to Cook's death, but as it was done by
Terreeoboo's special request it is difficult to see how the idea
can be justified.</p>

<p><b>A LARGE PRESENT.</b>
</p>

<p>Enquiries were several times made as to the date of the
departure of the ships, and hints were given that supplies were
running short; but at the same time they were informed that if they
returned the next bread-fruit season, their wants should be again
supplied. When the news went forth that they would leave in two
days, Terreeoboo issued a proclamation for food to be brought in so
that he might make a large present on their departure; and on the
appointed day Cook and King were invited to Terreeoboo's residence,
where they found all that had been given in exchange to the natives
was laid out on the ground, and a short distance away a large
quantity of vegetables of all kinds and a herd of pigs, which were
handed over on a return present being made. King says that the gift
"far exceeded everything of the kind we had seen." The camp ashore
was then broken up, and a great effort was made to persuade Cook to
permit Mr. King to remain, as he had succeeded in making himself a
great favourite with all. A house that had been used by the
sailmakers was accidentally set on fire, Burney says by natives
looking for a knife lost by one of the sailors; but Besant, who
places the fire at a later period, says it was done intentionally
in revenge for the sailors having enticed some of the women there,
and infers that Gilbert is his authority, but in the extracts he
publishes from Gilbert's manuscript there is nothing of the kind,
and no one refers to any other fire till after Cook's death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 18. 1779 TO 1780. THIRD VOYAGE CONCLUDED.</h2>

<p>On 4th February the ships unmoored and sailed from the bay,
steering to the north in hopes of finding a better anchorage. The
wind was very light, and the progress was so slow that it gave
Terreeoboo an opportunity of sending off a further present of food.
Soon after a gale sprang up, and the canoes which had accompanied
them beat a hasty retreat, leaving a good many, mostly women, on
board the ships. About midnight the fore and main topsails were
split, but towards morning the wind died away and they were able to
bend fresh sails. A second gale came on again at night, putting
them under double-reefed topsails, with topgallant yards sent down,
and at daybreak the fore-mast was found to be so badly sprung that
it was absolutely necessary it should be unstepped for immediate
repairs. After considerable hesitation, for he fully recognised
that the place must be almost denuded of surplus provisions, Cook
decided to return to Karakakoa Bay as no other convenient place was
known, and the ships again anchored there on the 11th, starting
immediately to unstep and get the mast ashore, when it was found to
be rotten at the heel as well as sprung. Wood that had been cut at
Eimeo for anchor stocks was used for fishing the head, and the work
proceeded rapidly: the priests making the camp tabu, so that there
should be no interference with the workmen.</p>

<p>When the ships arrived in the bay, hardly a canoe was to be
seen, and none came out to the ships. This, contrasted with their
first reception, was the cause of some surprise, and, in view of
what happened afterwards, of some suspicion; but Mr. King, who had
more intercourse with the natives than any of the other officers,
was thoroughly satisfied that "they neither meant nor apprehended
any change of conduct." Burney says that Terreeoboo and some of the
chiefs visited them on the 12th, and asked many questions about
their return, and did not seem well satisfied with the answers
received.</p>

<p><b>TROUBLE COMMENCES.</b>
</p>

<p>Everything went smoothly till the afternoon of the 13th, when
the officer in charge of the watering party complained to King that
the conduct of some of the natives was suspicious, and some of the
chiefs were driving away men he had engaged to help in rolling the
casks to the boats. King sent a marine with side arms to help to
restore order, but shortly after was informed the natives were
arming with stones and getting very noisy, so he went down himself,
with a marine armed with his musket, and succeeded in setting
matters right. Just at this time Cook came ashore, and King
reported what had occurred, receiving orders to fire with ball if
he received any insolence or stones were thrown. Soon afterwards
shots were heard from the Discovery, and a canoe was seen making
for the shore, closely pursued by one of the ship's boats. Cook,
King, and a marine ran to intercept them, but were too late, as the
occupants of the canoe landed before they could reach the spot.
Burney says the disturbance commenced by a native stealing a pair
of carpenter's tongs, jumping overboard with them, and placing them
in a canoe which at once paddled off. The thief was caught,
flogged, and put in irons till the tongs were returned from the
shore. The same tongs were again stolen in the afternoon, and the
thief got away with them, pursued by Edgar, the Master, in the
ship's cutter, and joined by the Resolution's pinnace. The thief
reaching shore first, put the tongs, the lid of a harness cask, and
a chisel in a second canoe which went out, and handed them over to
Edgar. Edgar, seeing Cook and King running along the shore, thought
it right to detain the second canoe, which unfortunately belonged
to Parea, who at the time of the theft was in Clerke's cabin and,
promising to obtain the tongs, had immediately left for the shore.
He tried to regain possession of his canoe, but was knocked down by
a sailor, and then some of the natives, who before this had been
quietly looking on, began to throw stones, and so roughly handled
the sailors in the pinnace that, being unarmed, they beat a
retreat, swimming to some rocks out of reach of the missiles. Edgar
and Vancouver remained ashore and fared badly, till Parea, who had
recovered from his blow and apparently forgotten it, ordered his
countrymen to stay their hands, and managed to save the pinnace
from being broken up. He wanted the boats to go back to the ships,
but as the oars had been taken away this was impossible. He then
started to find them, and as soon as his back was turned the
throwing began again. Edgar wished to go to the camp to find Cook,
but some of the natives advised him to follow them and they would
take him to Parea. He soon met him carrying one oar, followed by a
man with a broken one, so they were able to make shift in the boats
to the camp, being overtaken on the way by Parea in his canoe
bringing Vancouver's cap, which had been lost in the scuffle.</p>

<p>Owing to his pursuit of the thief Cook did not hear of all this
trouble till after dark, too late to take any further steps, but
King says he appeared very disturbed by the news, and remarked: "I
am afraid these people will oblige me to use some violent measures,
for they must not be left to imagine that they have gained an
advantage over us." He then went on board his ship and ordered all
natives ashore, whilst King returned to the camp, and doubling his
sentries, gave orders he was to be called if any natives were seen
about. At eleven, five were seen hovering near, but when they found
they were observed they made off, and later one got close to the
observatory, but ran when the sentry fired over his head. When on
his way to the ship the next morning for the chronometer, King was
informed that the Discovery's cutter had been stolen; it had been
moored to the anchor buoy. On board the Resolution he found Cook
busy loading his double-barreled gun and a landing party of marines
being prepared. Cook said he was going ashore to try to gain
possession of some of the principal chiefs in order to keep them
prisoners till the boat was returned, and that he had already sent
out boats to prevent any one leaving the bay, with the intention of
destroying their canoes if he could not recover the cutter by more
peaceable means. The Resolution's great cutter was sent after a
large sailing canoe that was making off, the small cutter was
guarding the western point of the bay, and Cook, with the pinnace
and launch, were going to Kowrowa to try and get Terreeoboo on
board the ship. He, and in fact every one else, were confident the
natives would offer no resistance if they heard the sound of but
one musket.</p>

<p>A little before eight o'clock Captain Cook, Lieutenant Phillips,
a sergeant, corporal, and seven marines left the ship for Kowrowa,
and King returned to his camp after being ordered to try and assure
the natives near the observatory that they would not be hurt, to
keep his men together, and to be prepared to meet any outbreak.
Having seen his men were on the alert, King visited the priests and
satisfied them that Terreeoboo would receive neither injury nor
insult.</p>

<p><b>COOK LANDS.</b>
</p>

<p>Having picked up the Resolution's launch, under the command of
Lieutenant Williamson, on his way, Cook landed the marines, and
marched into the village, where he received the usual marks of
respect. He asked to see the king and his two young sons. The two
boys came forward and conducted him to the hut where their father
was, and after a short conversation he felt assured that Terreeoboo
knew nothing about the stealing of the boat. He invited the three
to accompany him to the Resolution, and the king at once consented
and got up to go. However, the boys' mother came up with a few
chiefs and tried to persuade him not to go, and then they caught
hold of him and forced him to sit down. Meanwhile a large crowd had
gathered round, and Phillips, who seems to have acted with coolness
and judgment throughout the affair, drew up his men in line on some
rocks near the water, about thirty yards away. After trying for
some time to persuade the natives to allow their chief to go with
him, Cook gave up the attempt, observing to Phillips that it would
be impossible to compel them to do so without great risk of
bloodshed. Unfortunately, just at this time news arrived that a
chief of the first rank had been killed at the other side of the
bay. The shots had been heard soon after the landing of Cook's
party.</p>

<p>It was now recognised that matters had become very serious; the
natives were seen to be donning their war mats, and one man, armed
with a stone in one hand and a large iron spike in the other,
threatened Cook in a very insulting manner. He was told to keep
quiet, but only became more furious, so Cook fired a charge of
small shot into him, but his mats saved him from injury. Stones
were thrown at the marines, and a chief attempted to stab Phillips,
but was promptly knocked down with the butt of the latter's musket.
Cook now fired his second barrel loaded with ball and killed one of
the natives, but Sergeant Gibson told him it was the wrong man, so
he received orders to kill the right one, and did so. The
stone-throwing became heavier, and the marines responded with a
volley, but before they had time to reload the natives rushed them,
killing four out of the seven and wounding the rest, Phillips being
stabbed between the shoulders, but, before the blow could be
repeated he managed to shoot his assailant.</p>

<p><b>COOK'S DEATH.</b>
</p>

<p>Cook was now close to the water's edge, and had turned round to
order the boats' crews to cease firing and pull in. This is
believed to have caused his death, for, whilst he faced the
natives, none of them, except the one shot by Gibson, had offered
him actual violence, but when he turned to give orders he was
struck on the head and stabbed in the back, falling with his face
in a pool of water. As soon as he fell a great shout arose; he was
dragged ashore, and the natives, snatching the dagger from each
other, showed savage eagerness to share in his destruction.
Phillips and his wounded marines plunged into the water and,
covered by musketry fire, gained the boats; their officer, though
wounded, jumping out again to the assistance of the last man who,
severely injured by a blow on the face, was in great danger of
being captured. The boats, seeing there was no possibility of
recovering the bodies of the five who were killed, were ordered to
return at once to the ships from which they had only been absent an
hour. Nine stand of arms, Cook's double-barreled gun and his hanger
fell into the hands of the natives. As soon as this was reported,
the boats were recalled from the bay, and a strong reinforcement
was sent to Mr. King with orders to strike his camp and get the
Resolution's foremast off to the ship. The Indians were seen to be
assembling to the right of the tents, so the guns were turned on
them, and a party was posted on the Morai to cover the place where
the mast lay. About one o'clock everything was got away from the
shore, only a few stones being thrown by natives who thought their
mats were proof against bullets, and only found out their mistake
too late.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what had occurred, one of the priests, whom
Burney calls Kerriakair, remained with the English till everything
had been removed, and supplied the men with food and water. King,
about four o'clock, was sent to try to recover the bodies of the
Captain and marines. He was at first received with a volley of
stones, which fortunately fell short; he displayed a white flag and
pulled inshore, whilst the remaining boats lay off to cover him
with their fire if needed, but the stone-throwing was stopped, and
the natives also showed the white flag. In answer to King's demand
some of the chiefs promised that the bodies should be delivered the
next day, and Koah, swimming off to one of the boats, explained
that they could not be given up at once as they had already been
taken some distance up country. Burney, however, says that they
gathered, from signs made by some other Indians, that the bodies
had already been cut to pieces, and one man came down into the
water flourishing Cook's hanger "with many tokens of exultation and
defiance."</p>

<p><b>KOAH FRIENDLY.</b>
</p>

<p>On the 15th Captain Clerke formally took over the command of the
Resolution, and appointed Lieutenant Gore to the Discovery. During
the day Koah visited the ship several times, and in vain tried to
persuade Clerke or King to go ashore, but it was thought
inadvisable to run any further risks. In the evening Kerriakair and
a friend came off in a small canoe bringing a bundle containing the
flesh of Cook's thighs, saying that the body had been burned and
the limbs distributed amongst the chiefs. They had brought all they
could get unknown to the others, and Kerriakair strongly advised
Clerke not to trust too much to Koah; he said that the inhabitants
of the island were not inclined for peace except those in the
immediate neighbourhood, who would of course, in case of
hostilities, be the chief sufferers. He gave the number of natives
killed as twenty-six, with a large number of wounded.</p>

<p>On the 17th the ships were warped inshore so as to command the
watering place, the launches were sent in for water, with the other
boats fully armed, in support. They were received with showers of
stones from the houses, and from behind stone walls,
notwithstanding guns fired from the ships and musketry from the
boats at any of the natives who exposed themselves. Meanwhile Koah
again visited the ships, offering a pig as a present, and asking
for someone to be sent ashore for the bodies; but he was sent away,
and was soon afterwards seen amongst the stone-throwers. In the
afternoon the boats went again for water, but as the natives
recommenced hostilities they were ordered to keep clear, whilst the
ships' guns were worked for a quarter of an hour; then the boats'
crews landed and burned all the houses between the watering place
and the Morai, killing some six or seven of the natives. In the
evening, about five o'clock, some dozen natives bearing white flags
and sugar-cane marched down to the beach headed by Kerriakair
carrying a small pig. He said he came as an envoy from Terreeoboo
to make peace, and was accordingly taken on board the Resolution.
It was ascertained from him that the boat had been stolen by some
of Parea's people and had been broken up after Cook's death. During
the night some canoes came out and did a little trading; and the
next morning the bay was seen to be planted with white flags in
different directions, and the waterers were allowed to work
unmolested, whilst Kerriakair asked permission, at once granted, to
make an offering to one of the images on the Morai. Soon after Koah
came off with a pig, but was not admitted to either ship; he then
went off to the waterers, who sent him away. So he amused himself
by throwing stones at a small party of sailors on the Morai, and
drew a couple of shots from them, but escaped unhurt. Soon after a
party of natives marched down to the beach with bread-fruit, etc.,
which they left on the beach and was afterwards taken on board. A
chief, Eapoo, carried a message on board from Terreeoboo, and next
day brought presents of food. On the 20th the foremast of the
Resolution was stepped and rigging commenced, and in the middle of
the day a large body of natives marched in procession to the
watering place, beating drums, yelling, carrying white flags,
sugar-cane, etc., with Eapoo at their head bearing a parcel wrapped
in cloth containing some of Cook's bones. He went off to the
Resolution with Clerke, and soon after a boat was sent ashore for a
present of food from Terreeoboo. The next day, with the same
ceremonial, Eapoo again appeared with all the remaining bones it
was possible to recover, and was this time accompanied by Karowa,
Terreeoboo's youngest son.</p>

<p>"The 21st February. At sunset the Resolution fired ten minute
guns, with the colours half staff up, when the remains of our late
Commander were committed to the deep."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Williamson was severely blamed by his brother
officers for not going to the assistance of the pinnace at the time
of the attack on his Captain, and it is said that had it not been
for Clerke's ill health he would have been tried by court-martial.
He was afterwards, when in command of the Agincourt, tried for
"disaffection, cowardice, disobedience to signals, and not having
done his duty in rendering all assistance possible." He was found
guilty on the last two counts only, and was "placed at the bottom
of the list of Post-Captains, and rendered incapable of ever
serving on board of any of His Majesty's ships."</p>

<p><b>COOK'S REMAINS.</b>
</p>

<p>Ellis, in his Tour through Hawaii, says that King's account of
Cook's death, from which the above has been largely drawn, agrees
in a remarkable manner with that given by the natives. They in no
way blamed their visitors for what occurred, and even after his
death appear to have looked upon Cook as a man of a superior race
to themselves. His breastbone and ribs were long preserved as
relics, and in 1832 Ellis states there were many living who
remembered the occasion, and all agreed that Cook's conduct to
their countrymen was humane.</p>

<p>Captain Clerke says:</p>

<p>"Upon examining the remains of my late honoured and much
lamented friend, I found all his bones, excepting those of the
back, jaw, and feet&mdash;the two latter articles Earpo brought me
in the morning&mdash;the former, he declared, had been reduced to
ashes with the trunk of the body. As Carnacare (Kerriakair) had
told us, the flesh was taken from all the bones, excepting those of
the hands, the skin of which they had cut through in many places,
and salted, with the intention, no doubt, of preserving them; Earpo
likewise brought with him the two barrels of Captain Cook's
gun&mdash;the one beat flat with the intention of making a cutting
instrument of it; the other a good deal bent and bruised, together
with a present of thirteen hogs from Terreaboo."</p>

<p>The hands, as has been mentioned before, were identified by the
scar left by the explosion of his powder flask in Newfoundland,
which almost severed the thumb from the fingers.</p>

<p>On 22nd February they were able to sail from this unlucky place,
and touching at one or two of the islands worked their way
northwards to Kamtschatka, the Resolution reaching Owatska Bay on
29th April, followed by the discovery on 1st May. They were very
handsomely treated by Major Behm, the Governor of Bolcheretsk, a
place about 135 miles from the town of St. Peter and St. Paul in
Awatska Bay, notwithstanding Mr. Ismailoff's letters of
introduction were on somewhat unsatisfactory lines. Mr. Webber was
fortunately able to converse in German, which the Russian officers
understood; and he ascertained that Ismailoff had represented the
two vessels as very small, and hinted that he believed them to be
little better than pirates. The Governor provided the ships with
what he could give them, and promised to obtain further stores from
Okotsk for them against their return. For these kindnesses the
English could make but little return, and even then it was with
difficulty that the Russians could be persuaded to receive
anything, for they said they were only acting up to the wishes of
their Empress, who desired all her allies should be treated with
courtesy. One return, however, they were able to make which was of
great service. At the time of the visit of the ships a large number
of the soldiers and inhabitants were suffering very seriously from
scurvy, and Clerke at once put them under the care of his medical
officers, who, by the use of sour kraut and sweet wort made from
the ship's stock of malt, soon caused "a surprising alteration in
the figures of most of them and their speedy recovery was chiefly
attributed to the effects of the sweet wort."</p>

<p>They were informed by the Major that on the day of the arrival
of the English party at Bolcheretsk he had received a letter from
the most northerly outpost on the Sea of Okotsk, stating that the
tribe of Tschutski, which had been long at feud with the Russians,
had sent in an embassy offering friendship and tribute, giving as a
reason that they had been visited by two large vessels in the
preceding summer, and had been received on board with great
kindness, and had entered into a league of friendship with their
visitors: they therefore thought it their duty to ratify this
treaty formally. These two ships could have been none other than
the Resolution and Discovery, though evidently the Tschutski
thought they were Russian.</p>

<p><b>DEATH OF CLERKE.</b>
</p>

<p>Leaving on 13th June, the Asiatic coast was followed up, and 1st
July they were off the Gulf of Anadyr, where fogs and ice began
seriously to interfere with their progress, so they abandoned the
Asiatic for the American side, but with no better luck. They
reached the latitude of 70 degrees 33 minutes North, about five
leagues short of the point reached the previous year, and at
length, realising further efforts were useless and resulting in
serious damage to the ships from continual contact with the loose
ice, Clerke determined to return to Awatska Bay and refit and then
return to England. On 22nd August, the day before they reached the
Bay, Captain Clerke, who had long been suffering from serious ill
health, died, and was buried under a tree a little to the north of
the post of St. Peter and St. Paul; the crews of both ships and the
Russian garrison taking part in the funeral ceremony, and the
Russian priest reading the service at the grave. Clerke had been
all three voyages with Cook, and was only thirty-eight years of
age.</p>

<p>Gore now took command of the Resolution, Burney, Rickman, and
Lanyon being his lieutenants, whilst King was the new Captain of
the Discovery, and Williamson and Hervey his lieutenants; Bayley
going with Gore in charge of the astronomical observations. On 9th
October they left Awatska and were off Cape Nambu, Japan, on the
26th, but were driven off the coast by bad weather, and anchored in
Macao Roads on 1st December. Here, after considerable delay, stores
were obtained from Canton, and the seaman managed to dispose of
most of the furs they had obtained in the north. King estimates
that the two ships received, in money and goods, as much as
&pound;2000 for the skins, and says that the men were so anxious to
return for more that they were almost in a state of mutiny.</p>

<p>On 11th April the ships reached the Cape, where the officers
were cordially received by Governor Plattenberg, who expressed the
deepest regret to hear of the loss of Cook, and requested that he
should be sent a portrait of the Captain to place in a blank space
he pointed out between two portraits of De Ruyter and Van
Tromp&mdash;a gracious compliment. Sailing from Simon's Bay on 9th
May, the trades were picked up on the 14th, and on 13th June the
line was crossed in longitude 26 degrees 16 minutes West. The coast
of Ireland was sighted on 12th August, and an attempt was made to
get into Galway Bay, but strong southerly winds drove them to the
north, and at length, rounding the north of Scotland, they put into
Stromness, whence Captain King was despatched overland to the
Admiralty. The ships arrived off the Nore on 4th October, after an
absence of "four years, two months, and twenty-two days."</p>

<p><b>KING MEETS KING.</b>
</p>

<p>On 14th February 1781, the second anniversary of Cook's death,
King, accompanied by Mr. Banks, was presented to His Majesty, who
was pleased to accept the Journals of the Resolution and Discovery
kept during this eventful voyage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 19. APPRECIATION AND CHARACTER.</h2>

<p>Of course as nothing had been heard of the expedition for a
considerable time, a certain amount of anxiety was felt, which at
length found vent in paragraphs in the public press, and on 11th
January 1780 the London Gazette contained the following:</p>

<p>"Captain Clerke of His Majesty's Sloop the Resolution, in a
letter to Mr. Stephens, dated the 8th of June 1779, in the harbour
of St. Peter and St. Paul, Kampschatka, which was received
yesterday, gives the melancholy account of the celebrated Captain
Cook, late Commander of that Sloop, with four of his private
Marines having been killed on the 14th of February last at the
island of Owhyhe, one of a Group of new-discovered Islands in the
22nd degree of North Latitude, in an affray with a numerous and
tumultuous Body of the Natives."</p>

<p>"Captain Clerke adds, that he received every friendly supply
from the Russian Government; and that as the Companies of the
Resolution and her Consort, the Discovery, were in perfect Health,
and the two Sloops had twelve months Stores and Provisions on
board, he was preparing to make another Attempt to explore a
Northern Passage to Europe."</p>

<p><b>THE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.</b>
</p>

<p>The London Gazette of 8th February says:</p>

<p>"The Empress of Russia expressed a most deep concern at the Loss
of Captain Cook. She was the more sensibly affected from her very
partial regard to his merits; and when she was informed of the
hospitality shown by the Russian Government at Kamschatka to
Captain Clerke, she said no Subject in her Dominions could show too
much Friendship to the Survivors of Captain Cook."</p>

<p>The letter written by Clerke was sent by express through
Petersburg; that is to say, it was written in the extreme east of
Asia in June, and was sent overland across Siberia to Petersburg,
and thence via Berlin to London, and was there published in under
the six months. A wonderful journey when the difficulties of
transit are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>In the numerous appreciative notices that appeared in the press
relating to Cook and his work, the Morning Chronicle alone strikes
a jarring string, which is at once met by a reply; and a day or two
after the same paper publishes a long letter signed Colombus (the
style suggests the pen of Sir Joseph Banks) in which the character
and methods of Cook are most strenuously defended, the writer
claiming to have obtained his knowledge of the man "through long
intercourse with him."</p>

<p>The Gazetter of 24th January says:</p>

<p>"His Majesty, who had always the highest opinion of Captain
Cook, shed tears when Lord Sandwich informed him of his death, and
immediately ordered a pension of &pound;300 a year for his
widow."</p>

<p>The amount really granted to Mrs. Cook was &pound;200 per annum,
and the Admiralty in addition gave her half the proceeds of the
Journal of the Third Voyage, a share in the Journal of the Second
Voyage, and a share of the plates used in illustrating the two
publications: a very considerable addition to her income. A Coat of
Arms was also granted to the family by order of the King, and Sir
W. Besant records his belief that it was the last one ever granted
as a direct "recognition of Service." His description of it is:</p>

<p>"Azure, between the two polar stars Or, a sphere on the plane of
the meridian, showing the Pacific Ocean, his track thereon marked
by red lines. And for a crest, on a wreath of the colours, is an
arm bowed, in the uniform of a Captain of the Royal Navy. In the
hand is the Union Jack on a staff proper. The arm is encircled by a
wreath of palm and laurel. A very noble shield indeed."</p>

<p>The notes of appreciation of his talents and services came from
all parts of the world, and none more kindly than from the series
of brilliant Frenchmen who followed in his footsteps. De Crozet did
not hesitate to throw away his own charts when he recognised the
superiority of Cook's; and Dumont d'Urville calls him "the most
illustrious navigator of both the past and future ages whose name
will for ever remain at the head of the list of sailors of all
nations."</p>

<p><b>MRS. COOK'S LETTER.</b>
</p>

<p>The Royal Society was naturally amongst the first to recognise
the great worth of its late Fellow, and the loss the Society had
suffered from his death. It had already granted him one of its
highest honours in the form of the Copley Gold Medal for his
successful contest with the scurvy, and it now decided to mark its
appreciation by striking a special gold medal in his honour. This
was forwarded by Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society,
to Mrs. Cook, and acknowledged by her in the following touching
letter:</p>

<blockquote>Mile End,<br>
16th August 1784.<br>
<br>
Sir,<br>
<br>
I received your exceeding kind letter of the 12th instant, and want
words to express in any adequate degree my feelings on the very
singular honour which you, Sir, and the honourable and learned
Society over which you so worthily preside, have been pleased to
confer on my late husband, and through him on me and his children
who are left to lament the loss of him, and to be the receivers of
those most noble marks of approbations which, if Providence had
been pleased to permit him to receive, would have rendered me very
happy indeed.<br>
<br>
Be assured, Sir, that however unequal I may be to the task of
expressing it, I feel as I ought the high honour which the Royal
Society has been pleased to do me. My greatest pleasure now
remaining is in my sons, who, I hope, will ever strive to copy
after so good an example, and, animated by the honours bestowed on
their Father's memory, be ambitious of attaining by their own
merits your notice and approbation. Let me entreat you to add to
the many acts of friendship which I have already received at your
hands, that of expressing my gratitude and thanks to that learned
body in such a manner as may be acceptable to them.<br>
<br>
I am, Sir, etc., etc.,<br>
Elizabeth Cook.</blockquote>

<p>The medal actually presented to Mrs. Cook is now in the British
Museum.</p>

<p><b>DEATHS OF THE SONS.</b>
</p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that so little can be ascertained
about Cook's private life that would be of service in forming an
intimate knowledge of his character, but this is accounted for by
the fact that after he had joined the Navy his time was so fully
occupied by that service that he had but little opportunity to form
private friendships such as fall to the lot of most men. The
intimacies that he did form were mostly connected very closely with
his naval duties, and his opportunities of correspondence were
necessarily limited by absence from all ordinary means of
communication. For a man of his marked celebrity it is very curious
that there should be such a dearth of anecdote that it is difficult
to find anything that is unconnected with his profession. Of his
own family relations there is also little known, as Mrs. Cook,
probably esteeming the few letters she had from him as too sacred
to be seen by any other eye than her own, as the late Canon Bennett
suggests, destroyed them before her death. Still some idea of their
life together, short as it really was, notwithstanding it lasted,
in name, for over sixteen years, may be gained from the manner in
which his widow always spoke of him after his death. She always
wore a ring containing a lock of his hair, and measured everything
by his standard of morality and honour. The greatest disapprobation
she could express was "Mr. Cook would never have done so." He was
always Mr. Cook to her. She kept four days each year as solemn
fasts, remaining in her own room. The days were those on which she
lost her husband and three sons, passing them in reading her
husband's Bible, prayer and meditation, and during bad weather she
could not sleep for thinking of those at sea. For her husband's
sake she befriended her nephews and nieces whom she never saw. Of
her three sons, two entered the Navy. One, Nathaniel, was lost with
his ship, the Thunderer, in a hurricane off Jamaica in 1780. The
eldest, James, rose to the rank of Commander, and in January 1794
was appointed to H.M. sloop Spitfire. He was at Poole when he
received his orders to join his ship at Portsmouth without delay.
Finding an open boat with sailors returning from leave about to
start, he joined them. It was blowing rather hard, and nothing was
ever heard of the passengers or crew, except that the broken boat
and the dead body of the unfortunate young officer, stripped of all
money and valuables, with a wound in the head, was found ashore on
the Isle of Wight. The third son, Hugh, was entered at Christ's
College, Cambridge, in 1793, but contracting scarlet fever he died
on 21st December of that year, and was buried in the church of St.
Andrew the Great, being joined by his brother James a few weeks
afterwards, when the mother was left indeed alone. She survived her
husband for the long period of fifty-six years, living at Clapham
with her cousin, Admiral Isaac Smith, and at length joined her two
sons at Cambridge at the advanced age of ninety-three.</p>

<p>Cook's character as given by those with whom he worked, men who
day after day were by his side, was a fine one. His greatest fault
seems to have been his hasty temper, which he admitted himself,
often most regretfully; but Captain King says it was "disarmed by a
disposition the most benevolent and humane," and it never was
displayed in such a manner as to cause the loss of respect and
affection of his people. He was healthy and vigorous in mind and
body, clear-headed and cool in times of danger, broad minded and
temperate, and plain and unaffected in manner. His powers of
observation were of the first rank, his knowledge of Naval
mathematics far surpassed the ordinary level and amounted to
genius, but, above all, his devotion to duty was the commanding
feature of his character. Nothing was allowed to interfere when he
saw his course before him; personal convenience was not allowed to
weigh for one moment, but at the same time he never lost sight of
the interests of those under him and spared them when possible. He
was somewhat silent and reserved in manner, but when questioned on
any subject on which he felt he was an authority, his answers were
clearly and distinctly given, and his reasons disclosed his powers
of observation to the full. He was kindly, generous, and
hospitable, and by no means the stern character that has been
painted, for even in such a matter-of-fact document as his official
Journal, a spirit of fun occasionally gleams out.</p>

<p>Such was the man whose name will ever stand in the very first
ranks of the British Empire Builders; honest, kindly, generous, a
faithful servant and a noble leader.</p>
