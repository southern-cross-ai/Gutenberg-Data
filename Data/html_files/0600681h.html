<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; TANTOR THE ELEPHANT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HIS great bulk swaying to and fro as he threw his
weight first upon one side and then upon the other, Tantor the
elephant lolled in the shade of the father of forests. Almost
omnipotent, he, in the realm of his people. Dango, Sheeta, even
Numa the mighty were as naught to the pachyderm. For a hundred
years he had come and gone up and down the land that had trembled
to the comings and the goings of his forebears for countless
ages.</p>

<p>In peace he had lived with Dango the hyena, Sheeta the leopard
and Numa the lion. Man alone had made war upon him. Man, who holds
the unique distinction among created things of making war on all
living creatures, even to his own kind. Man, the ruthless; man, the
pitiless; man, the most hated living organism that Nature has
evolved.</p>

<p>Always during the long hundred years of his life, Tantor had
known man. There had been black men, always. Big black warriors
with spears and arrows, little black warriors, swart Arabs with
crude muskets and white men with powerful express rifles and
elephant guns. The white men had been the last to come and were the
worst. Yet Tantor did not hate men&mdash;not even white men. Hate,
vengeance, envy, avarice, lust are a few of the delightful emotions
reserved exclusively for Nature's noblest work&mdash;the
<i>lower</i> animals do not know them. Neither do they know fear as
man knows it, but rather a certain bold caution that sends the
antelope and the zebra, watchful and wary, to the water hole with
the lion.</p>

<p>Tantor shared this caution with his fellows and avoided
men&mdash;especially white men; and so had there been other eyes
there that day to see, their possessor might almost have questioned
their veracity, or attributed their error to the half-light of the
forest as they scanned the figure sprawling prone upon the rough
back of the elephant, half dozing in the heat to the swaying of the
great body; for, despite the sun-bronzed hide, the figure was quite
evidently that of a white man. But there were no other eyes to see
and Tantor drowsed in the heat of midday and Tarzan, Lord of the
Jungle, dozed upon the back of his mighty friend. A sultry air
current moved sluggishly from the north, bringing to the keen
nostrils of the ape-man no disquieting perception. Peace lay upon
the jungle and the two beasts were content.</p>

<p><br>IN the forest Fahd and Motlog, of the tribe el-Harb, hunted
north from the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Sheikh Ibn Jad of the Beny Salem <a title=
"tribe, tribal territory"><i>fendy</i></a> el-Guad. With them were
black slaves. They advanced warily and in silence upon the fresh
spoor of <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> the elephant, the
thoughts of the swart Arabs dwelling upon ivory, those of the black
slaves upon fresh meat. The <a title="slave"><i>'abd</i></a>
Fejjuan, black Galla slave, sleek, ebon warrior, eater of raw meat,
famed hunter, led the others.</p>

<p>Fejjuan, as his comrades, thought of fresh meat, but also he
thought of el-Habash, the land from which he had been stolen as a
boy. He thought of coming again to the lonely Galla hut of his
parents. Perhaps el-Habash was not far off now. For months Ibn Jad
had been traveling south and now he had come east for a long
distance. El-Habash must be near. When he was sure of that his days
of slavery would be over and Ibn Jad would have lost his best Galla
slave.</p>

<p>Two marches to the north, in the southern extremity of
Abyssinia, stood the round dwelling of the father of Fejjuan,
almost on the roughly mapped route that Ibn Jad had planned nearly
a year since when he had undertaken this mad adventure upon the
advice of a learned <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a>, a magician of repute.
But of either the exact location of his father's house or the exact
plans of Ibn Jad, Fejjuan was equally ignorant. He but dreamed, and
his dreams were flavored with raw meat.</p>

<p>The leaves of the forest drowsed in the heat above the heads of
the hunters. Beneath the drowsing leaves of other trees a stone's
throw ahead of them Tarzan and Tantor slept, their perceptive
faculties momentarily dulled by the soothing influence of fancied
security and the somnolence that is a corollary of equatorial
midday.</p>

<p>Fejjuan, the Galla slave, halted in his tracks, stopping those
behind him by the silent mandate of an upraised hand. Directly
before him, seen dimly between the boles and through the foliage,
swayed the giant bulk of <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a>.
Fejjuan motioned to Fahd, who moved stealthily to the side of the
black. The Galla slave pointed through the foliage toward a patch
of gray hide. Fahd raised el-Lazzary, his ancient matchlock, to his
shoulder. There was a flash of flame, a burst of smoke, a roar and
<a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a>, unhit, was bolting through
the forest.</p>

<p>As Tantor surged forward at the sound of the report Tarzan
started to spring to an upright position, and at the same instant
the pachyderm passed beneath a low-hanging limb which struck the
ape-man's head, sweeping him to the ground, where he lay stunned
and unconscious.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>Terrified, Tantor thought only of escape as he ran north through
the forest, leaving in his wake felled trees, trampled or up-torn
bushes. Perhaps he did not know that his friend lay helpless and
injured, at the mercy of the common enemy, man. Tantor never
thought of Tarzan as one of the Tarmangani, for the white man was
synonymous with discomfort, pain, annoyance, whereas Tarzan of the
Apes meant to him restful companionship, peace, happiness. Of all
the jungle beasts, except his own kind, he fraternized with Tarzan
only.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a> Thou missed," exclaimed
Fejjuan.</p>

<p><a title="exclamation of scorn"><i>"Gluck!"</i></a> ejaculated
Fahd. "<a title="Satan, the Devil"><i>Sheytan</i></a> guided the
bullet. But let us see&mdash;perhaps <a title=
"elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> is hit."</p>

<p>"Nay, thou missed."</p>

<p>The two men pushed forward, followed by their fellows, looking
for the hoped-for carmine spoor. Fahd suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah!</i></a> What have we
here?" he cried. "I fired at <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a>
and killed a <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>."</p>

<p>The others crowded about. "It is indeed a Christian dog, and
naked, too," said Motlog.</p>

<p>"Or some wild man of the forest," suggested another. "Where did
thy bullet strike him, Fahd?"</p>

<p>They stooped and rolled Tarzan over. "There is no mark of bullet
upon him."</p>

<p>"Is he dead? Perhaps he, too, hunted <a title=
"elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> and was slain by the great beast."</p>

<p>"He is not dead," announced Fejjuan, who had kneeled and placed
an ear above the ape-man's heart. "He lives and from the mark upon
his head I think but temporarily out of his wits from a blow. See,
he lies in the path that <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> made
when he ran away&mdash;he was struck down in the brute's
flight."</p>

<p>"I will finish him," said Fahd, drawing his <a title=
"an Arabian knife with an angled blade, the cutting edge being on the concave side">
<i>khusa</i></a>.</p>

<p>"By Allah, no! Put back thy knife, Fahd," said Motlog. "Let the
sheikh say if he shall be killed. Thou art always too eager for
blood."</p>

<p>"It is but a <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>,"
insisted Fahd, "Thinkest thou to carry him back to the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>?"</p>

<p>"He moves," said Fejjuan. "Presently he will be able to walk
there without help. But perhaps he will not come with us, and look,
he hath the size and muscles of a giant. <a title=
"By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah!</i></a> What a man!"</p>

<p>"Bind him," commanded Fahd. So with thongs of camel hide they
made the ape-man's two wrists secure together across his belly, nor
was the work completed any too soon. They had scarce done when
Tarzan opened his eyes and looked them slowly over. He shook his
head, like some great lion, and presently his senses cleared. He
recognized the Arabs instantly for what they were.</p>

<p>"Why are my wrists bound?" he asked them in their own tongue.
"Remove the thongs!"</p>

<p>Fahd laughed. "Thinkest thou, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, that thou art some great
sheikh that thou canst order about the <a title=
"Beduins"><i>Beduw</i></a> as they were dogs?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," replied the ape-man, as one might say, "I am the
sheikh of sheikhs."</p>

<p>"Tarzan!" exclaimed Motlog. He drew Fahd aside. "Of all men," he
said, lowering his voice, "that it should be our ill fortune to
offend this one! In every village that we have entered in the past
two weeks we have heard his name. 'Wait,' they have said, until
Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, returns. He will slay you when he
learns that you have taken slaves in his country."</p>

<p>"When I drew my <a title=
"an Arabian knife with an angled blade, the cutting edge being on the concave side">
<i>khusa</i></a> thou shouldst not have stopped my hand, Motlog,"
complained Fahd; "but it is not too late yet." He placed his hand
upon the hilt of his knife.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>, nay!" cried Motlog. "We
have taken slaves in this country. They are with us now and some of
them will escape. Suppose they carry word to the <a title=
"tribe, tribal territory"><i>fendy</i></a> of this great sheikh
that we have slain him? Not one of us will live to return to
<a title="village">Beled</a> el-Guad."</p>

<p>"Let us then take him before Ibn Jad that the responsibility may
be his," said Fahd.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, you speak
wisely," replied Motlog. "What the sheikh doeth with this man is
the sheikh's business. Come!"</p>

<p>As they returned to where Tarzan stood he eyed them
questioningly.</p>

<p>"What have you decided to do with me?" he demanded. "If you are
wise you will cut these bonds and lead me to your sheikh. I wish a
word with him."</p>

<p>"We are only poor men," said Motlog. "It is not for us to say
what shall be done, and so we shall take you to our sheikh who will
decide."</p>

<p><br>THE Sheikh Ibn Jad of the <a title=
"tribe, tribal territory"><i>fendy</i></a> el-Guad squatted in the
open men's compartment of his <a title=
"Beduin goat-hair tent"><i>beyt es-sh'ar</i></a>, and beside him in
the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of his house of hair sat Tollog, his brother, and a young Beduin,
Zeyd, who, doubtless, found less attraction in the company of the
sheikh than in the proximity of the sheikh's harem whose quarters
were separated from the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
only by a breast-high curtain suspended between the waist poles of
the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>, affording thus an occasional
glimpse of Ateja, the daughter of Ibn Jad. That it also afforded an
occasional glimpse of Hirfa, his wife, raised not the temperature
of Zeyd an iota.</p>

<p>As the men talked the two women were busy within their apartment
at their housewifely duties. In a great brazen <a title=
"large stewing pot, usally made of tinned copper"><i>jidda</i></a>
Hirfa was placing mutton to be boiled for the next meal while Ateja
fashioned sandals from an old bag of camel leather impregnated with
the juice of the dates that it had borne upon many a <a title=
"journey, trek, expedition"><i>rahla</i></a>, and meanwhile they
missed naught of the conversation that passed in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>.</p>

<p>"We have come a long way without mishap from our own <a title=
"village"><i>beled</i></a>," Ibn Jad was remarking, "and the way
has been longer because I wished not to pass through el-Habash lest
we be set upon or followed by the people of that country. Now may
we turn north again and enter el-Habash close to the spot where the
magician foretold we should find the treasure city of Nimmr."</p>

<p>"And thinkest thou to find this fabled city easily, once we are
within the boundaries of el-Habash?" asked Tollog, his brother.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, yes. It is
known to the people of this far south Habash. Fejjuan, himself an
Habashy, though he has never been there, heard of it as a boy. We
shall take prisoners among them and, by the grace of Allah, we
shall find the means to loose their tongues and have the truth from
them."</p>

<p>"By Allah, I hope it does not prove like the treasure that lies
upon the great rock el-Howwara in the plain of Medain Salih," said
Zeyd. "An <a title=
"Arabic&mdash;a powerful evil spirit, a monstrous demon"><i>afrit</i></a>
guards it where it lay sealed in a stone tower and they say that
should it be removed disaster would befall mankind; for men would
turn upon their friends, and even upon their brothers, the sons of
their fathers and mothers, and the kings of the world would give
battle, one against another."</p>

<p>"Yea," testified Tollog, "I had it from one of the <a title=
"tribe"><i>fendy</i></a> Hazim that a wise Moghreby came by there
in his travels and consulting the cabalistic signs in his book of
magic discovered that indeed the treasure lay there."</p>

<p>"But none dared take it up," said Zeyd.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>" exclaimed Ibn Jad.
"There be no <a title=
"Arabic&mdash;a powerful evil spirit, a monstrous demon"><i>afrit</i></a>
guarding the treasures of Nimmr. Naught but flesh and blood Habush
that may be laid low with ball and powder. The treasure is ours for
the taking."</p>

<p>"Allah grant that it may be as easily found as the treasure of
Geryeh," said Zeyd, "which lays a journey north of Tebuk in the
ancient ruins of a walled city. There, each Friday, the pieces of
money roll out of the ground and run about over the desert until
sunset."</p>

<p>"Once we are come to Nimmr there will be no difficulty finding
the treasure," Ibn Jad assured them. "The difficulty will lie in
getting out of el-Habash with the treasure and the woman; and if
she is as beautiful as the <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a> said, the men of Nimmr
may protect her even more savagely than they would the
treasure."</p>

<p>"Often do magicians lie," said Tollog.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" exclaimed Ibn Jad, looking toward the jungle that
hemmed the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> upon
all sides.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a> It is Fahd and Motlog
returning from the hunt," said Tollog. "Allah grant that they bring
ivory and meat."</p>

<p>"They return too soon," said Zeyd.</p>

<p>"But they do not come empty handed," and Ibn Jad pointed toward
the naked giant that accompanied the returning hunters.</p>

<p>The group surrounding Tarzan approached the sheikh's <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and halted.</p>

<p>Wrapped in his soiled calico <a title=
"ankle-length robe-like garment, usually with long sleeves"><i>thobe</i></a>,
his headkerchief drawn across the lower part of his face, Ibn Jad
exposed but two villainous eyes to the intent scrutiny of the
ape-man which simultaneously included the pock-marked, shifty-eyed
visage of Tollog, the sheikh's brother, and the not ill-favored
countenance of the youthful Zeyd.</p>

<p>"Who is sheikh here?" demanded Tarzan in tones of authority that
belied the camel leather thongs about his wrists.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad permitted his <a title=
"a kind of kerchief"><i>thorrib</i></a> to fall from before his
face. "<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, I am
sheikh," he said, "and by what name art thou known, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>?"</p>

<p>"They call me Tarzan of the Apes, Moslem."</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes," mused Ibn Jad. "I have heard the
name."</p>

<p>"Doubtless. It is not unknown to Arab slave raiders. Why, then,
came you to my country, knowing I do not permit my people to be
taken into slavery?"</p>

<p>"We do not come for slaves," Ibn Jad assured him. "We do but
trade in peace for ivory."</p>

<p>"Thou liest in thy beard, Moslem," returned Tarzan, quietly. "I
recognize both Manyuema and Galla slaves in thy <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>, and
I know that they are not here of their own choosing. Then, too, was
I not present when your henchmen fired a shot at <a title=
"elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a>? Is that peaceful trading for ivory?
No! it is poaching, and that Tarzan of the Apes does not permit in
his country. You are raiders and poachers."</p>

<p>"By Allah! we are honest men," cried Ibn Jad. "Fahd and Motlog
did but hunt for meat. If they shot <a title=
"elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> it must be that they mistook him for
another beast."</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried Tarzan. "Remove the thongs that bind me and
prepare to return north from whence thou camest. Thou shalt have an
escort and bearers to the Sudan. That will I arrange for."</p>

<p>"We have come a long way and wish only to trade in peace,"
insisted Ibn Jad. "We shall pay our bearers for their labor and
take no slaves, nor shall we again fire upon <a title=
"elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a>. Let us go our way and when we return
we will pay you well for permission to pass through your
country."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "No! you shall go at once. Come, cut
these bonds!"</p>

<p>Ibn Jad's eyes narrowed. "We have offered thee peace and
profits, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," he
said, "but if thou wouldst have war let it be war. Thou art in our
power and remember that dead enemies are harmless. Think it over."
And to Fahd: "Take him away and bind his feet."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Moslem," warned Tarzan, "the arms of the ape-man
are long&mdash;they may reach out even in death and their fingers
encircle your throat."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have until dark to decide, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, and thou mayst know that
Ibn Jad will not turn back until he hath that for which he
came."</p>

<p>They took Tarzan then and at a distance from the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Ibn Jad they pushed him into a small
<a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>; but once within this tent
it required three men to throw him to the ground and bind his
ankles, even though his wrists were already bound.</p>

<p>In the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of the sheikh the Beduins
sipped their coffee, sickish with clove, cinnamon and other spice,
the while they discussed the ill fortune that had befallen them;
for, regardless of his bravado, Ibn Jad knew full well that only
speed and most propitious circumstances could now place the seal of
success upon his venture.</p>

<p>"But for Motlog," said Fahd, "we would now have no cause for
worry concerning the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, for I had my knife ready
to slit the dog's throat when Motlog interfered."</p>

<p>"And had word of his slaying spread broadcast over his country
before another sunset and all his people at our heels," countered
Motlog.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>," said Tollog,
the sheikh's brother. "I wish Fahd had done the thing he wished.
After all how much better off are we if we permit the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> to live? Should we free him
we know that he will gather his people and drive us from the
country. If we keep him prisoner and an escaped slave carries word
of it to his people will they not be upon us even more surely than
as though we had slain him?"</p>

<p>"Tollog, thou speakest words of wisdom," said Ibn Jad, nodding
appreciatively.</p>

<p>"But wait," said Tollog, "I have within me, unspoken, words of
even greater worth." He leaned forward motioning the others closer
and lowered his voice. "Should this one whom they call Tarzan
escape during the night, or should we set him free, there would be
no bad word for an escaped slave to bear to his people."</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>" exclaimed Fahd
disgustedly. "There would be no need for an escaped slave to bring
word to his people&mdash;the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> himself would do that and
lead them upon us in person. Bah! the brains of Tollog are as
camel's dung."</p>

<p>"Thou hast not heard all that I would say, brother," continued
Tollog, ignoring Fahd. "It would only <i>seem</i> to the slaves
that this man had escaped, for in the morning he would be gone and
we would make great lamentation over the matter, or we would say:
'<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, it is true that
Ibn Jad made peace with the stranger, who departed into the jungle,
blessing him.'"</p>

<p>"I do not follow thee, brother," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"The <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> lies bound
in yonder <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>. The night will be
dark. A slim knife between his ribs were enough. There be faithful
Habush among us who will do our bidding, nor speak of the matter
after. They can prepare a trench from the bottom of which a dead
Tarzan may not reach out to harm us."</p>

<p>"By Allah, it is plain that thou art of sheikhly blood, Tollog,"
exclaimed Ibn Jad. "The wisdom of thy words proclaims it. Thou
shalt attend to the whole matter. Then will it be done secretly and
well. The blessings of Allah be upon thee!" and Ibn Jad arose and
entered the quarters of his harem.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; COMRADES OF THE WILD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DARKNESS fell upon the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad the sheikh. Beneath the small flitting tent where his
captors had left him, Tarzan still struggled with the bonds that
secured his wrists, but the tough camel leather withstood even the
might of his giant thews. At times he lay listening to the night
noises of the jungle, many of them noises that no other human ear
could have heard, and always he interpreted each correctly. He knew
when Numa passed and Sheeta the leopard; and then from afar and so
faintly that it was but the shadow of a whisper, there came down
the wind the trumpeting of a bull elephant.</p>

<p><br>WITHOUT the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Ibn Jad Ateja,
the sheikh's daughter, loitered, and with her was Zeyd. They stood
very close to one another and the man held the maiden's hands in
his.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Ateja," he said, "that you love no other than
Zeyd."</p>

<p>"How many times must I tell you that?" whispered the girl.</p>

<p>"And you do not love Fahd?" insisted the man.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, no!" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Yet your father gives the impression that one day you will be
Fahd's."</p>

<p>"My father wishes me to be of the harem of Fahd, but I mistrust
the man, and I could not belong to one whom I neither loved nor
trusted."</p>

<p>"I, too, mistrust Fahd," said Zeyd. "Listen Ateja! I doubt his
loyalty to thy father, and not his alone, but another whose name I
dare not even whisper. Upon occasions I have seen them muttering
together when they thought that there were no others about."</p>

<p>The girl nodded her head. "I know. It is not necessary even to
whisper the name to me&mdash;and I hate him even as I hate
Fahd."</p>

<p>"But he is of thine own kin," the youth reminded her.</p>

<p>"What of that? Is he not also my father's brother? If that bond
does not hold him loyal to Ibn Jad, who hath treated him well, why
should I pretend loyalty for him? Nay, I think him a traitor to my
father, but Ibn Jad seems blind to the fact. We are a long way from
our own country and if aught should befall the sheikh, Tollog,
being next of blood, would assume the sheikhly duties and honors. I
think he hath won Fahd's support by a promise to further his suit
for me with Ibn Jad, for I have noticed that Tollog exerts himself
to praise Fahd in the hearing of my father."</p>

<p>"And perhaps a division of the spoils of the <a title=
"raid, foray"><i>ghrazzu</i></a> upon the treasure city," suggested
Zeyd.</p>

<p>"It is not unlikely," replied the girl, "and&mdash;Allah! what
was that?"</p>

<p>The Beduins seated about the coffee fire leaped to their feet.
The black slaves, startled, peered out into the darkness from their
rude shelters. Muskets were seized. Silence fell again upon the
tense, listening <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>. The
weird, uncanny cry that had unnerved them was not repeated.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>" ejaculated Ibn Jad. "It
came from the midst of the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>, and
it was the voice of a beast, where there are only men and a few
domestic animals."</p>

<p>"Could it have been&mdash;?" The speaker stopped as though
fearful that the thing he would suggest might indeed be true.</p>

<p>"But he is a man and that was the voice of a beast," insisted
Ibn Jad. "It could not have been he."</p>

<p>"But he is a <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>,"
reminded Fahd. "Perhaps he has league with <a title=
"Satan, the Devil"><i>Sheytan</i></a>."</p>

<p>"And the sound came from the direction where he lies bound in a
<a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>," observed another.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ibn Jad. "Let us investigate."</p>

<p>With muskets ready the Arabs, lighting the way with paper
lanterns, approached the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>
where Tarzan lay. Fearfully the foremost looked within.</p>

<p>"He is here," he reported.</p>

<p>Tarzan, who was sitting in the center of the tent, surveyed the
Arabs somewhat contemptuously. Ibn Jad pressed forward.</p>

<p>"You heard a cry?" he demanded of the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it. Camest thou, Sheikh Ibn Jad, to disturb my
rest upon so trivial an errand, or yearnest thou to release
me?"</p>

<p>"What manner of cry was it? What did it signify?" asked Ibn
Jad.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes smiled grimly. "It was but the call of a
beast to one of his kind," he replied. "Does the noble <a title=
"Beduin"><i>Beduwy</i></a> tremble thus always when he hears the
voices of the jungle people?"</p>

<p><a title="exclamation of scorn"><i>"Gluck!"</i></a> growled Ibn
Jad, "the <a title="Beduins"><i>Beduw</i></a> fear naught. We
thought the sound came from this <a title=
"small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> and we hastened hither believing some
jungle beast had crept within the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> and
attacked thee. Tomorrow it is the thought of Ibn Jad to release
thee."</p>

<p>"Why not tonight?"</p>

<p>"My people fear thee. They would that when you are released you
depart hence immediately."</p>

<p>"I shall. I have no desire to remain in thy lice infested
<a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>."</p>

<p>"We could not send thee alone into the jungle at night where
<a title="lion"><i>el-adrea</i></a> is abroad hunting," protested
the sheikh.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes smiled again, one of his rare smiles. "Tarzan
is more secure in his teeming jungle than are the <a title=
"Beduins"><i>Beduw</i></a> in their desert," he replied. "The
jungle night has no terrors for Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," snapped the sheikh and then, motioning to his
followers, he departed.</p>

<p>Tarzan watched their paper lanterns bobbing across the camp to
the sheikh's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and then he stretched
himself at full length and pressed an ear to the ground.</p>

<p>When the inhabitants of the Arab <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
heard the cry of the beast shatter the quiet of the new night it
aroused within their breasts a certain vague unrest, but otherwise
it was meaningless to them. Yet there was one far off in the jungle
who caught the call faintly and understood&mdash;a huge beast, the
great, gray dreadnought of the jungle, Tantor the elephant. Again
he raised his trunk aloft and trumpeted loudly. His little eyes
gleamed redly wicked as, a moment later, he swung off through the
forest at a rapid trot.</p>

<p>Slowly silence fell upon the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Sheikh Ibn Jad as the Arabs and their slaves sought their sleeping
mats. Only the sheikh and his brother sat smoking in the sheikh's
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>&mdash;smoking and whispering in
low tones.</p>

<p>"Do not let the slaves see you slay the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, Tollog," cautioned Ibn
Jad. "Attend to that yourself first in secrecy and in silence, then
quietly arouse two of the slaves. Fejjuan would be as good as
another, as he has been among us since childhood and is loyal. He
will do well for one."</p>

<p>"Abbas is loyal, too, and strong," suggested Tollog.</p>

<p>"Yea, let him be the second," agreed Ibn Jad. "But it is well
that they do not know how the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> came to die. Tell them that
you heard a noise in the direction of his <a title=
"small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> and that when you had come to learn
the nature of it you found him thus dead."</p>

<p>"You may trust to my discretion, brother," Tollog assured.</p>

<p>"And warn them to secrecy," continued the sheikh. "No man but we
four must ever know of the death of the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, nor of his place of
burial. In the morning we shall tell the others that he escaped
during the night. Leave his cut bonds within the <a title=
"small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> as proof. You understand?"</p>

<p>"By Allah, fully."</p>

<p>"Good! Now go. The people sleep." The sheikh rose and Tollog,
also. The former entered the apartment of his harem and the latter
moved silently through the darkness of the night in the direction
of the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> where his victim
lay.</p>

<p>Through the jungle came Tantor the elephant and from his path
fled gentle beasts and fierce. Even Numa the lion slunk growling to
one side as the mighty pachyderm passed.</p>

<p>Into the darkness of the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>
crept Tollog, the sheikh's brother; but Tarzan, lying with an ear
to the ground, had heard him approaching from the moment that he
had left the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Ibn Jad. Tarzan
heard other sounds as well and, as he interpreted these others, he
interpreted the stealthy approach of Tollog and was convinced when
the footsteps turned into the tent where he lay&mdash;convinced of
the purpose of his visitor. For what purpose but the taking of his
life would a Beduin visit Tarzan at this hour of the night?</p>

<p>As Tollog, groping in the dark, entered the tent Tarzan sat
erect and again there smote upon the ears of the Beduin the horrid
cry that had disturbed the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
earlier in the evening, but this time it arose in the very
<a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> in which Tollog stood.</p>

<p>The Beduin halted, aghast. "Allah!" he cried, stepping back.
"What beast is there? <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>! Art thou being
attacked?"</p>

<p>Others in the camp were awakened, but none ventured forth to
investigate. Tarzan smiled and remained silent.</p>

<p>"<a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>!" repeated
Tollog, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>Cautiously, his knife ready in his hand, the Beduin backed from
the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>. He listened but heard
no sound from within. Running quickly to his own <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> he made a light in a paper lantern and
hastened back to the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>, and
this time he carried his musket and it was at full cock. Peering
within, the lantern held above his head, Tollog saw the ape-man
sitting upon the ground looking at him. There was no wild beast!
Then the Beduin understood.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a> It was thou, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, who made the fearful
cries."</p>

<p>"<a title="Beduin"><i>Beduwy</i></a>, thou comest to kill the
<a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, eh?" demanded
Tarzan.</p>

<p>From the jungle came the roar of a lion and the trumpeting of a
bull elephant, but the <a title="enclosure"><i>boma</i></a> was
high and sharp with thorns and there were guards and beast-fire, so
Tollog gave no thought to these familiar noises of the night. He
did not answer Tarzan's question but laid aside his musket and drew
his khusa, which after all was answer enough.</p>

<p>In the dim light of the paper lantern Tarzan watched these
preparations. He saw the cruel expression upon the malevolent face.
He saw the man approaching slowly, the knife ready in his hand.</p>

<p>The man was almost upon him now, his eyes glittering in the
faint light. To the ears of the ape-man came the sound of a
commotion at the far edge of the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>,
followed by an Arab oath. Then Tollog launched a blow at Tarzan's
breast. The prisoner swung his bound wrists upward and struck the
Beduin's knife arm away, and simultaneously he struggled to his
knees.</p>

<p>With an oath, Tollog struck again, and again Tarzan fended the
blow, and this time he followed swiftly with a mighty sweep of his
arms that struck the Beduin upon the side of the head and sent him
sprawling across the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a>; but
Tollog was instantly up and at him again, this time with the
ferocity of a maddened bull, yet at the same time with far greater
cunning, for instead of attempting a direct frontal attack Tollog
leaped quickly around Tarzan to strike him from behind.</p>

<p>In his effort to turn upon his knees that he might face his
antagonist the ape-man lost his balance, his feet being bound
together, and fell prone at Tollog's mercy. A vicious smile bared
the yellow teeth of the Beduin.</p>

<p>"Die, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>!" he
cried, and then: "<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a> What was
that?" as, of a sudden, the entire tent was snatched from above his
head and hurled off into the night. He turned quickly and a shriek
of terror burst from his lips as he saw, red-eyed and angry, the
giant form of <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> towering above
him; and in that very instant a supple trunk encircled his body and
Tollog, the sheikh's brother, was raised high aloft and hurled off
into the darkness as the tent had been.</p>

<p>For an instant Tantor stood looking about, angrily, defiantly,
then he reached down and lifted Tarzan from the ground, raised him
high above his head, wheeled about and trotted rapidly across the
<a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
toward the jungle. A frightened sentry fired once and fled. The
other sentry lay crushed and dead where Tantor had hurled him when
he entered the camp. An instant later Tarzan and Tantor were
swallowed by the jungle and the darkness.</p>

<p>The <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Sheikh Ibn Jad was in an uproar. Armed men hastened hither and
thither seeking the cause of the disturbance, looking for an
attacking enemy. Some came to the spot where had stood the
<a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> where the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> had been confined, but
<a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> and <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> both had disappeared.
Nearby, the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of one of Ibn Jad's
cronies lay flattened. Beneath it were screaming women and a
cursing man. On top of it was Tollog, the sheikh's brother, his
mouth filled with vile Beduin invective, whereas it should have
contained only praises of Allah and thanksgiving, for Tollog was
indeed a most fortunate man. Had he alighted elsewhere than upon
the top of a sturdily pegged <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> he had
doubtless been killed or badly injured when Tantor hurled him thus
rudely aside.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad, searching for information, arrived just as Tollog was
extricating himself from the folds of the tent.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>" cried the sheikh. "What
has come to pass? What, O brother, art thou doing upon the
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Abd el-Aziz?"</p>

<p>A slave came running to the sheikh. "The <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> is gone and he hath taken
the <a title="small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> with him," he cried.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad turned to Tollog. "Canst thou not explain, brother?" he
demanded. "Is the <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>
truly departed?"</p>

<p>"The <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> is indeed
gone," replied Tollog. "He is in league with <a title=
"Satan, the Devil"><i>Sheytan</i></a>, who came in the guise of
<a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> and carried the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> into the jungle, after
throwing me upon the top of the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of
Abd el-Aziz whom I still hear squealing and cursing beneath as
though it had been he who was attacked rather than I."</p>

<p>Ibn Jad shook his head. Of course he knew that Tollog was a
liar&mdash;that he always had known&mdash;yet he could not
understand how his brother had come to be upon the top of the
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Abd el-Aziz.</p>

<p>"What did the sentries see?" demanded the sheikh. "Where were
they?"</p>

<p>"They were at their post," spoke up Motlog. "I was just there.
One of them is dead, the other fired upon the intruder as it
escaped."</p>

<p>"And what said he of it?" demanded Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, he said that
<a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> came and entered the
<a title="encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>,
killing Yemeny and rushing to the <a title=
"small tent"><i>hejra</i></a> where the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> lay bound, ripping it
aside, throwing Tollog high into the air. Then he seized the
prisoner and bore him off into the jungle, and as he passed him
Hasan fired."</p>

<p>"And missed," guessed Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>For several moments the sheikh stood in thought, then he turned
slowly toward his own <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>. "Tomorrow,
early, is the <a title=
"journey, trek, expedition"><i>rahla</i></a>," he said; and the
word spread quickly that early upon the morrow they would break
camp.</p>

<p><br>FAR into the forest Tantor bore Tarzan until they had come to a
small clearing well carpeted with grass, and here the elephant
deposited his burden gently upon the ground and stood guard
above.</p>

<p>"In the morning," said Tarzan, "when Kudu the Sun hunts again
through the heavens and there is light by which to see, we shall
discover what may be done about removing these bonds, Tantor; but
for now let us sleep."</p>

<p>Numa the lion, Dango the hyena, Sheeta the leopard passed near
that night, and the scent of the helpless man-thing was strong in
their nostrils, but when they saw who stood guard above Tarzan and
heard the mutterings of the big bull, they passed on about their
business while Tarzan of the Apes slept.</p>

<p><br>WITH the coming of dawn all was quickly astir in the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad. Scarce was the meager breakfast eaten ere the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of the sheikh was taken down by his women,
and at this signal the other houses of hair came tumbling to the
ground, and within the hour the Arabs were winding northward toward
el-Habash.</p>

<p>The Beduins and their women were mounted upon the desert ponies
that had survived the long journey from the north, while the slaves
that they had brought with them from their own country marched
afoot at the front and rear of the column in the capacity of
<a title="native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a>, and these were armed
with muskets. Their bearers were the natives that they had
impressed into their service along the way. These carried the
impedimenta of the camp and herded the goats and sheep along the
trail.</p>

<p>Zeyd rode beside Ateja, the daughter of the sheikh, and more
often were his eyes upon her profile than upon the trail ahead.
Fahd, who rode near Ibn Jad, cast an occasional angry glance in the
direction of the two. Tollog, the sheikh's brother, saw and
grinned.</p>

<p>"Zeyd is a bolder suitor than thou, Fahd," he whispered to the
young man.</p>

<p>"He has whispered lies into her ears and she will have none of
me," complained Fahd.</p>

<p>"If the sheikh favored thy suit though," suggested Tollog.</p>

<p>"But he does not," snapped Fahd. "A word from you might aid. You
promised it."</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, yes, but my
brother is an over-indulgent sire," explained Tollog. "He doth not
mislike you, Fahd, but rather he would have his <a title=
"daughter, also woman or girl in general"><i>bint</i></a> happy,
and so leaves the selection of her mate to her."</p>

<p>"What is there to do, then?" demanded Fahd.</p>

<p>"If I were sheikh, now," suggested Tollog, "but alas I am
not."</p>

<p>"If you were sheikh, what then?"</p>

<p>"My niece would go to the man of my own choosing."</p>

<p>"But you are not sheikh," Fahd reminded him.</p>

<p>Tollog leaned close and whispered in Fahd's ear. "A suitor as
bold as Zeyd would find the way to make me sheikh."</p>

<p>Fahd made no reply but only rode on in silence, his head bowed
and his brows contracted in thought.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; THE APES OF TOYAT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THREE days crawled slowly out of the east and
followed one another across the steaming jungle and over the edge
of the world beyond. For three days the Arabs moved slowly
northward toward el-Habash. For three days Tarzan of the Apes lay
in the little clearing, bound and helpless, while Tantor the
elephant stood guard above him. Once each day the great bull
brought the ape-man food and water.</p>

<p>The camel leather thongs held securely and no outside aid
appeared to release Tarzan from the ever increasing discomfort and
danger of his predicament. He had called to Manu the monkey to come
and gnaw the strands apart, but Manu, ever irresponsible, had only
promised and forgotten. And so the ape-man lay uncomplaining, as is
the way of beasts patiently waiting for release, knowing that it
might come in the habiliment of death.</p>

<p>Upon the morning of the fourth day Tantor gave evidences of
restlessness. His brief foragings had exhausted the nearby supply
of food for himself and his charge. He wanted to move on and take
Tarzan with him; but the ape-man was now convinced that to be
carried farther into the elephant country would lessen his chances
for succor, for he felt that the only one of the jungle people who
could release him was Mangani the great ape. Tarzan knew that
already he was practically at the outer limits of the Mangani
country, yet there was a remote chance that a band of the great
anthropoids might pass this way and discover him, while, should
Tantor carry him farther north even this meager likelihood of
release would be lost forever.</p>

<p>Tantor wanted to be gone. He nudged Tarzan with his trunk and
rolled him over. He raised him from the ground.</p>

<p>"Put me down, Tantor," said the ape-man, and the pachyderm
obeyed, but he turned and walked away. Tarzan watched him cross the
clearing to the trees upon the far side. There Tantor hesitated,
stopped, turned. He looked back at Tarzan and trumpeted. He dug up
the earth with a great tusk and appeared angry.</p>

<p>"Go and feed," said Tarzan, "and then return. Tomorrow the
Mangani may come."</p>

<p>Tantor trumpeted again and, wheeling about, disappeared in the
jungle. For a long time the ape-man lay listening to the retreating
footfalls of his old friend.</p>

<p>"He is gone," he mused. "I cannot blame him. Perhaps it is as
well. What matter whether it be today, tomorrow, or the day
after?"</p>

<p>The morning passed. The noonday silence lay upon the jungle.
Only the insects were abroad. They annoyed Tarzan as they did the
other jungle beasts, but to the poison of their stings he was
immune through a lifetime of inoculation.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a great scampering through the trees. Little
Manu and his brothers, his sisters and his cousins came trooping
madly through the middle terrace, squealing, chattering and
scolding.</p>

<p>"Manu!" called Tarzan. "What comes?"</p>

<p>"The Mangani! The Mangani!" shrieked the monkeys.</p>

<p>"Go and fetch them, Manu!" commanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"We are afraid."</p>

<p>"Go and call to them from the upper terraces," urged Tarzan.
"They cannot reach you there. Tell them that one of their people
lies helpless here. Tell them to come and release me."</p>

<p>"We are afraid."</p>

<p>"They cannot reach you in the upper terraces. Go! They will be
your friends then."</p>

<p>"They cannot climb to the upper terraces," said an old monkey.
"I will go."</p>

<p>The others, halted in their flight, turned and watched the
gray-beard as he scampered quickly off amongst the loftiest
branches of the great trees, and Tarzan waited.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the deep gutturals of his own people, the
great apes, the Mangani. Perhaps there would be those among them
who knew him. Perhaps, again, the band may have come from afar and
have no knowledge of him, though that he doubted. In them, however,
was his only hope. He lay there, listening, waiting. He heard Manu
screaming and chattering as he scampered about high above the
Mangani, then, of a sudden, silence fell upon the jungle. There was
only the sound of insects, buzzing, humming.</p>

<p>The ape-man lay looking in the direction from which had come the
sounds of the approaching anthropoids. He knew what was transpiring
behind that dense wall of foliage. He knew that presently a pair of
fierce eyes would be examining him, surveying the clearing,
searching for an enemy, warily probing for a trick or a trap. He
knew that the first sight of him might arouse distrust, fear, rage;
for what reason had they to love or trust the cruel and merciless
Tarmangani?</p>

<p>There lay great danger in the possibility that, seeing him, they
might quietly withdraw without showing themselves. That, then,
would be the end, for there were no others than the Mangani to whom
he might look for rescue. With this in mind he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am a friend," he called to them. "The Tarmangani caught me
and bound my wrists and ankles. I cannot move. I cannot defend
myself. I cannot get food nor water. Come and remove my bonds."</p>

<p>From just behind the screen of foliage a voice replied, "You are
a Tarmangani."</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Yes," screamed Manu, "he is Tarzan of the Apes. The Tarmangani
and the Gomangani bound him and Tantor brought him here. Four times
has Kudu hunted across the sky while Tarzan of the Apes lay
bound."</p>

<p>"I know Tarzan," said another voice from behind the foliage and
presently the leaves parted and a huge, shaggy ape lumbered into
the clearing. Swinging along with knuckles to the ground the brute
came close to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"M'walat!" exclaimed the ape-man.</p>

<p>"It is Tarzan of the Apes," said the great ape, but the others
did not understand.</p>

<p>"What?" they demanded.</p>

<p>"Whose band is this?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Toyat is king," replied M'walat.</p>

<p>"Then do not tell them it is really I," whispered Tarzan, "until
you have cut these bonds. Toyat hates me. He will kill me if I am
defenseless."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed M'walat.</p>

<p>"Here," said Tarzan, raising his bound wrists. "Bite these bonds
in two."</p>

<p>"You are Tarzan of the Apes, the friend of M'walat. M'walat will
do as you ask," replied the ape.</p>

<p>Of course, in the meager language of the apes, their
conversation did not sound at all like a conversation between men,
but was rather a mixture of growls and grunts and gestures which,
however, served every purpose that could have been served by the
most formal and correct of civilized speech since it carried its
messages clearly to the minds of both the Mangani and the
Tarmangani, the Great Ape and the Great White Ape.</p>

<p>As the other members of the band pressed forward into the
clearing, seeing that M'walat was not harmed, the latter stooped
and with powerful teeth severed the camel leather thongs that
secured the wrists of the ape-man, and similarly he freed his
ankles.</p>

<p>As Tarzan came to his feet the balance of the fierce and shaggy
band swung into the clearing. In the lead was Toyat, king ape, and
at his heels eight more full grown males with perhaps six or seven
females and a number of young. The young and the shes hung back,
but the bulls pressed forward to where Tarzan stood with M'walat at
his side.</p>

<p>The king ape growled menacingly. "Tarmangani!" he cried.
Wheeling in a circle he leaped into the air and came down on all
fours; he struck the ground savagely with his clenched fists; he
growled and foamed, and leaped again and again. Toyat was working
himself to a pitch of rage that would nerve him to attack the
Tarmangani, and by these maneuvers he hoped also to arouse the
savage fighting spirit of his fellows.</p>

<p>"It is Tarzan of the Apes, friend of the Mangani," said
M'walat.</p>

<p>"It is a Tarmangani, enemy of the Mangani," cried Toyat. "They
come with great thunder sticks and kill us. They make our shes and
our balus dead with a loud noise. Kill the Tarmangani."</p>

<p>"It is Tarzan of the Apes," growled Gayat. "When I was a little
balu he saved me from Numa. Tarzan of the Apes is the friend of the
Mangani."</p>

<p>"Kill the Tarmangani!" shrieked Toyat, leaping high into the
air.</p>

<p>Several of the other bulls were now circling and leaping into
the air as Gayat placed himself at Tarzan's side. The ape-man knew
them well. He knew that sooner or later one of them would have
excited himself to such a pitch of maniacal frenzy that he would
leap suddenly upon him. M'walat and Gayat would attack in his
defense; several more bulls would launch themselves into the battle
and there would ensue a free for all fight from which not all of
them would emerge alive, and none without more or less serious
injuries; but Tarzan of the Apes did not wish to battle with his
friends.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded, raising his opened palm to attract
attention. "I am Tarzan of the Apes, mighty hunter, mighty fighter;
long did I range with the tribe of Kerchak; when Kerchak died I
became king ape; many of you know me; all know that I am first a
Mangani; that I am friend to all Mangani. Toyat would have you kill
me because Toyat hates Tarzan of the Apes. He hates him not because
he is a Tarmangani but because Tarzan once kept Toyat from becoming
king. That was many rains ago when some of you were still balus. If
Toyat has been a good king Tarzan is glad, but now he is not acting
like a good king for he is trying to turn you against your best
friend.</p>

<p>"You, Zutho!" he exclaimed, suddenly pointing a finger at a huge
bull. "You leap and growl and foam at the mouth. You would sink
your fangs into the flesh of Tarzan. Have you forgotten, Zutho, the
time that you were sick and the other members of the tribe left you
to die? Have you forgotten who brought you food and water? Have you
forgotten who it was that kept Sabor the lioness and Sheeta the
panther and Dango the hyena from you during those long nights?"</p>

<p>As Tarzan spoke, his tone one of quiet authority, the apes
gradually paused to listen to his words. It was a long speech for
the jungle folk. The great apes nor the little monkeys long
concentrated upon one idea. Already, before he had finished, one of
the bulls was overturning a rotted log in search of succulent
insects. Zutho was wrinkling his brows in unaccustomed
recollection. Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>"Zutho remembers," he said. "He is the friend of Tarzan," and
ranged himself beside M'walat. With this the other bulls, except
Toyat, appeared to lose interest in the proceedings and either
wandered off in search of food or squatted down in the grass.</p>

<p>Toyat still fumed, but as he saw his cause deserted he
prosecuted his war dance at a safer distance from Tarzan and his
defenders, and it was not long before he, too, was attracted by the
more profitable business of bug hunting.</p>

<p>And so Tarzan ranged again with the great apes. And as he loafed
lazily through the forest with the shaggy brutes he thought of his
foster mother, Kala, the great she-ape, the only mother he had ever
known; he recalled with a thrill of pride her savage defense of him
against all their natural enemies of the jungle and against the
hate and jealousy of old Tublat, her mate, and against the enmity
of Kerchak, the terrible old king ape.</p>

<p>As if it had been but yesterday since he had seen him, Tarzan's
memory projected again upon the screen of recollection the huge
bulk and the ferocious features of old Kerchak. What a magnificent
beast he had been! To the childish mind of the ape-boy Kerchak had
been the personification of savage ferocity and authority, and even
today he recalled him with almost a sensation of awe. That he had
overthrown and slain this gigantic ruler still seemed to Tarzan
almost incredible. He fought again his battles with Terkoz and with
Bolgani the gorilla. He thought of Teeka, whom he had loved, and of
Thaka and Tana, and of the little black boy, Tibo, whom he had
endeavored to adopt; and so he dreamed through lazy daylight hours
while Ibn Jad crept slowly northward toward the leopard city of
Nimmr and in another part of the jungle events were transpiring
that were to entangle Tarzan in the meshes of a great
adventure.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; BOLGANI THE GORILLA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A BLACK porter caught his foot in an entangling
creeper and stumbled, throwing his load to the ground. Of such
trivialities are crises born. This one altered the entire life of
James Hunter Blake, young, rich, American, hunting big game for the
first time in Africa with his friend Wilbur Stimbol who, having
spent three weeks in the jungle two years before, was naturally the
leader of the expedition and an infallible authority on all matters
pertaining to big game, African jungle, safari, food, weather and
Negroes. The further fact that Stimbol was twenty-five years
Blake's senior naturally but augmented his claims to
omniscience.</p>

<p>These factors did not in themselves constitute the basis for the
growing differences between the two men, for Blake was a
phlegmatically inclined young man of twenty-five who was rather
amused at Stimbol's egotism than otherwise. The first rift had
occurred at railhead when, through Stimbol's domineering manner and
ill temper, the entire purpose of the expedition had been abandoned
by necessity, and what was to have been a quasi scientific motion
picture camera study of wild African life had resolved itself into
an ordinary big game hunt.</p>

<p>At railhead, while preparations were going on to secure
equipment and a safari, Stimbol had so offended and insulted the
cameraman that he had left them flat and returned to the coast.
Blake was disappointed, but he made up his mind to go on through
and get what pictures he could with a still camera. He was not a
man who enjoyed killing for the mere sport of taking life, and as
originally planned there was to have been no shooting of game
except for food and half a dozen trophies that Stimbol particularly
wished to add to his collection.</p>

<p>There had since been one or two altercations relative to
Stimbol's treatment of the black porters, but these matters, Blake
was hopeful, had been ironed out and Stimbol had promised to leave
the handling of the safari to Blake and refrain from any further
abuse of the men.</p>

<p>They had come into the interior even farther than they had
planned, had had the poorest of luck in the matter of game and were
about to turn back toward railhead. It seemed now to Blake that
after all they were going to pull through without further
difficulty and that he and Stimbol would return to America
together, to all intent and purpose still friends; but just then a
black porter caught his foot in an entangling creeper and stumbled,
throwing his load to the ground.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the porter Stimbol and Blake were walking
side by side and, as though guided by a malevolent power, the load
crashed into Stimbol, hurling him to the ground. Stimbol and the
porter scrambled to their feet amidst the laughter of the Negroes
who had witnessed the accident. The porter was grinning. Stimbol
was flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"You damned clumsy swine!" he cried, and before Blake could
interfere or the porter protect himself the angry white man stepped
quickly over the fallen load and struck the black a terrific blow
in the face that felled him; and as he lay there, Stimbol kicked
him in the side. But only once! Before he could repeat the outrage
Blake seized him by the shoulder, wheeled him about and struck him
precisely as he had struck the black.</p>

<p>Stimbol fell, rolled over on his side and reached for the
automatic that hung at his hip, but quick as he was Blake was
quicker. "Cut that!" said Blake, crisply, covering Stimbol with a
.45. Stimbol's hand dropped from the grip of his gun. "Get up!"
ordered Blake, and when the other had risen: "Now listen to me,
Stimbol&mdash;this is the end. You and I are through. Tomorrow
morning we split the safari and equipment, and whichever way you go
with your half, I'll go in the opposite direction."</p>

<p>Blake had returned his gun to its holster as he spoke, the black
had risen and was nursing a bloody nose, the other blacks were
looking sullenly. Blake motioned to the porter to pick up his load
and presently the safari was again on the move&mdash;a sullen
safari without laughter or song.</p>

<p>Blake made camp at the first available ground shortly before
noon in order that the division of equipment, food and men could be
made during the afternoon and the two safaris thus be enabled to
make an early start the following morning.</p>

<p>Stimbol, sullen, would give no assistance, but, taking a couple
of the <i>askari</i>, the armed natives who act as soldiers for the
safari, started out from camp to hunt. He had proceeded scarcely a
mile along a mould padded game trail which gave forth no sound in
answer to their falling footsteps, when one of the natives in the
lead held up his hand in warning as he halted in his tracks.</p>

<p>Stimbol advanced cautiously and the black pointed toward the
left, through the foliage. Dimly, Stimbol saw a black mass moving
slowly away from them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Gorilla," replied the black.</p>

<p>Stimbol raised his rifle and fired at the retreating figure. The
black was not surprised that he missed.</p>

<p>"Hell!" ejaculated the white. "Come on, get after him! I've got
to have him. Gad! what a trophy he'll make."</p>

<p>The jungle was rather more open than usual and again and again
they came within sight of the retreating gorilla. Each time Stimbol
fired and each time he missed. Secretly the blacks were amused and
pleased. They did not like Stimbol.</p>

<p><br>AT a distance Tarzan of the Apes, hunting with the tribe of
Toyat, heard the first shot and immediately took to the trees and
was racing in the direction of the sound. He felt sure that the
weapon had not been discharged by the Beduins, for he well knew and
could differentiate between the reports of their muskets and those
made by modern weapons.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he thought, there may be among them such a rifle,
because such was not impossible, but more likely it meant white
men, and in Tarzan's country it was his business to know what
strangers were there and why. Seldom they came even now, though
once they had never come. It was those days that Tarzan regretted,
for when the white man comes peace and happiness depart.</p>

<p>Racing through the trees, swinging from limb to limb, Tarzan of
the Apes unerringly followed the direction of the sound of the
succeeding shots; and as he approached more closely the scene of
the pursuit of Bolgani the gorilla, he heard the crashing of
underbrush and the voices of men.</p>

<p>Bolgani, fleeing with greater haste than caution, his mind and
attention occupied by thoughts of escape from the hated Tarmangani
and the terrifying thunder stick that roared each time the
Tarmangani came within sight of him, abandoned his accustomed
wariness and hurried through the jungle forgetful of what few other
enemies might beset his path; and so it was that he failed to see
Histah the snake draped in sinuous loops along an overhanging
branch of a nearby patriarch of the forest.</p>

<p>The huge python, naturally short tempered and irritable, had
been disturbed and annoyed by the crashing sounds of pursuit and
escape and the roaring voice of the rifle. Ordinarily he would have
permitted a full grown bull gorilla to pass unmolested, but in his
present state of mind he might have attacked even Tantor
himself.</p>

<p>His beady eyes glaring fixedly, he watched the approach of the
shaggy Bolgani, and as the gorilla passed beneath the limb to which
he clung Histah launched himself upon his prey.</p>

<p>As the great coils, powerful, relentless, silent, encircled
Bolgani, he sought to tear the hideous folds from him. Great is the
strength of Bolgani, but even greater is that of Histah the snake.
A single hideous, almost human scream burst from the lips of
Bolgani with the first realization of the disaster that had
befallen him, and then he was on the ground tearing futilely at the
steadily tightening bands of living steel that would crush the life
from him, crush until his bones gave to the tremendous pressure,
until only broken pulp remained within a sausage-like thing that
would slip between the distended jaws of the serpent.</p>

<p>It was upon this sight that Stimbol and Tarzan came
simultaneously&mdash;Stimbol stumbling awkwardly through the
underbrush, Tarzan of the Apes, demi-god of the forest, swinging
gracefully through the foliage of the middle terraces.</p>

<p>They arrived simultaneously but Tarzan was the only one of the
party whose presence was unsuspected by the others, for, as always,
he had moved silently and with the utmost wariness because of the
unknown nature of the conditions he might discover.</p>

<p>As he looked down upon the scene below his quick eye and his
knowledge of the jungle revealed at a glance the full story of the
tragedy that had overtaken Bolgani, and then he saw Stimbol raise
his rifle, intent upon bagging two royal specimens with a single
shot.</p>

<p>In the heart of Tarzan was no great love for Bolgani the
gorilla. Since childhood the shaggy, giant man-beast had been the
natural foe of the ape-man. His first mortal combat had been with
Bolgani. For years he had feared him, or rather avoided him through
caution, for of fear Tarzan was ignorant; and since he had emerged
from childhood he had continued to avoid Bolgani for the simple
reason that his own people, the great apes, avoided him.</p>

<p>But now when he saw the huge brute beset by two of the natural
enemies of both the Mangani and the Bolgani there flared within his
breast a sudden loyalty that burned away the personal prejudices of
a lifetime.</p>

<p>He was directly above Stimbol, and with such celerity do the
mind and muscles of the ape-man coordinate that even as the
American raised his weapon to his shoulder Tarzan had dropped upon
his back, felling him to the earth; and before Stimbol could
discover what had happened to him, long before he could stumble,
cursing, to his feet, Tarzan, who had been unarmed, had snatched
the hunter's knife from its scabbard and leaped full upon the
writhing, struggling mass of python and gorilla. Stimbol came to
his feet ready to kill but what he saw before him temporarily drove
the desire for vengeance from his mind.</p>

<p>Naked but for a loin cloth, bronzed, black-haired, a giant white
man battled with the dread python; and as Stimbol watched he
shuddered as he became aware that the low, beast-like growls he
heard came not alone from the savage lips of the gorilla but from
the throat of the god-like man-thing that fought for him.</p>

<p>Steely fingers encircled the python just back of its head, while
those of the free hand drove Stimbol's hunting knife again and
again into the coiling, writhing body of the serpent. With the
projection of a new and more menacing enemy into the battle, Histah
was forced partially to release his hold upon Bolgani with, at
first, the intention of including Tarzan in the same embrace that
he might crush them both at once; but soon he discovered that the
hairless man-thing constituted a distinct menace to his life that
would necessitate his undivided attention, and so he quickly
uncoiled from about Bolgani and in a frenzy of rage and pain that
whipped his great length into a lashing fury of destruction he
sought to encircle the ape-man; but wheresoever his coils
approached, the keen knife bit deep into tortured flesh.</p>
<a id="pic3" name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0600681h-images/TarzanLordOfTheJungle-03.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Steely fingers encircled the python just back of
its head.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Bolgani, the spark of life all but crushed from him, lay gasping
upon the ground, unable to come to the aid of his preserver, while
Stimbol, goggle-eyed with awe and terror, kept at a safe distance,
momentarily forgetful both of his lust for trophies and his bent
for revenge.</p>

<p>Thus was Tarzan pitted, single-handed, against one of the
mightiest of Nature's creations in a duel to the death, the result
of which seemed to the watching American already a foregone
conclusion, for what man born of woman could hope, unaided, to
escape from the embrace of the deadly coils of a python?</p>

<p>Already Histah had encircled the torso and one leg of the
ape-man, but his powers of constriction, lessened by the frightful
wounds he had received, had as yet been unable to crush his
adversary into helplessness, and Tarzan was now concentrating his
attention and the heavy blade of the hunting knife upon a single
portion of the weakening body in an attempt to cut Histah in
two.</p>

<p>Man and serpent were red with blood; and crimson were the
grasses and the brush for yards in all directions as, with a final
effort, Histah closed his giant coils spasmodically about his
victim at the instant that Tarzan with a mighty upward heavy lunge
cut through the vertebrae of the great snake.</p>

<p>Lashing and writhing, the nether portion, headless, flopped
aside while the ape-man, still fighting with what remained,
exerting his superhuman strength to its ultimate utmost, slowly
forced the coils from about his body and cast the dying Histah from
him. Then, without a glance at Stimbol, he turned to Bolgani.</p>

<p>"You are hurt to death?" he asked in the language of the great
apes.</p>

<p>"No," replied the gorilla. "I am Bolgani! I kill,
Tarmangani!"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," said the ape-man. "I saved you from
Histah."</p>

<p>"You did not come to kill Bolgani?" inquired the gorilla.</p>

<p>"No. Let us be friends."</p>

<p>Bolgani frowned in an effort to concentrate upon this remarkable
problem. Presently he spoke. "We will be friends," he said. "The
Tarmangani behind you will kill us both with his thunder stick. Let
us kill him first." Painfully he staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"No," remonstrated Tarzan. "I will send the Tarmangani
away."</p>

<p>"You? He will not go."</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle," replied the ape-man. "The
word of Tarzan is law in the jungle."</p>

<p>Stimbol, who had been watching, was under the impression that
the man and the beast were growling at one another and that a new
duel impended. Had he guessed the truth and suspicioned that they
considered him a common enemy he would have felt far less at ease.
Now, his rifle regained, he started toward Tarzan just as the
latter turned to address him.</p>

<p>"Stand to one side, young fellow," said Stimbol, "while I finish
that gorilla. After the experience you just had with the snake, I
doubt if you want that fellow to jump you, too." The American was
none too sure of what the attitude of the white giant might be, for
all too fresh in his mind was the startling and disconcerting
manner of the wild man's introduction; but he felt safe because he
held a rifle, while the other was unarmed, and he guessed that the
giant might be only too glad to be saved from the attentions of the
gorilla, which, from Stimbol's imagined knowledge of such beasts,
appeared to him to be quite evidently threatening.</p>

<p>Tarzan halted directly between Bolgani and the hunter and eyed
the latter appraisingly for a moment. "Lower your rifle," he said,
presently. "You are not going to shoot the gorilla."</p>

<p>"The hell I'm not!" ejaculated Stimbol. "What do you suppose
I've been chasing him through the jungle for?"</p>

<p>"Under a misapprehension," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What misapprehension?" demanded Stimbol.</p>

<p>"That you were going to shoot him. You are not."</p>

<p>"Say, young man, do you know who I am?" demanded Stimbol.</p>

<p>"I am not interested," replied Tarzan coldly.</p>

<p>"Well you'd better be. I'm Wilbur Stimbol of Stimbol and
Company, brokers, New York!" That was a name to conjure
with&mdash;in New York. Even in Paris and London it had opened many
a door, bent many a knee. Seldom had it failed the purpose of this
purse-arrogant man.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in my country?" demanded the ape-man,
ignoring Stimbol's egotistical statement of his identity.</p>

<p>"Your country? Who the hell are you?"</p>

<p>Tarzan turned toward the two blacks who had been standing a
little in the rear of Stimbol and to one side. "I am Tarzan of the
Apes," he said to them in their own dialect. "What is this man
doing in my country? How many are there in his party&mdash;how many
white men?"</p>

<p>"Big Bwana," replied one of the men with sincere deference, "we
knew that you were Tarzan of the Apes when we saw you swing from
the trees and slay the great snake. There is no other in all the
jungle who could do that. This white man is a bad master. There is
one other white man with him. The other is kind. They came to hunt
Simba the lion and other big game. They have had no luck. Tomorrow
they turn back."</p>

<p>"Where is their camp?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>The black who had spoken pointed. "It is not far," he said.</p>

<p>The ape-man turned to Stimbol. "Go back to your camp," he said.
"I shall come there later this evening and talk with you and your
companion. In the meantime hunt no more except for food in Tarzan's
country."</p>

<p>There was something in the voice and manner of the stranger that
had finally gone through Stimbol's thick sensibilities and
impressed him with a species of awe&mdash;a thing he had scarcely
ever experienced in the past except in the presence of wealth that
was grossly superior to his own. He did not reply. He just stood
and watched the bronzed giant turn to the gorilla. He heard them
growl at one another for a moment and then, to his vast surprise,
he saw them move off through the jungle together, shoulder to
shoulder. As the foliage closed about them he removed his helmet
and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a silken handkerchief as
he stood staring at the green branches that had parted to receive
this strangely assorted pair.</p>

<p>Finally he turned to his men with an oath. "A whole day wasted!"
he complained. "Who is this fellow? You seemed to know him."</p>

<p>"He is Tarzan," replied one of the blacks.</p>

<p>"Tarzan? Never heard of him," snapped Stimbol.</p>

<p>"All who know the jungle, know Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Humph!" sneered Stimbol. "No lousy wild man is going to tell
Wilbur Stimbol where he can hunt and where he can't."</p>

<p>"Master," said the black who had first spoken, "the word of
Tarzan is the law of the jungle. Do not offend him."</p>

<p>"I'm not paying you damn fools for advice," snapped Stimbol. "If
I say hunt, we hunt, and don't you forget it." But on their return
to camp they saw no game, or at least Stimbol saw none. What the
blacks saw was their own affair.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE TARMANGANI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DURING Stimbol's absence from camp Blake had been
occupied in dividing the food and equipment into two equal parts
which were arranged for Stimbol's inspection and approval; but the
division of the porters and <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a> he had left until the other's
return, and was writing in his diary when the hunting party entered
the camp.</p>

<p>He could see at a glance that Stimbol was in bad humor, but as
that was the older man's usual state of temper it caused Blake no
particular anxiety, but rather gave him cause for added relief that
on the morrow he would be rid of his ill-natured companion for
good.</p>

<p>Blake was more concerned, however, by the sullen demeanor of the
<a title="native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a> who had accompanied
Stimbol for it meant to the younger man that his companion had
found some new occasion for bullying, abusing or insulting them,
and the difficulty of dividing the safari thus increased. Blake had
felt from the moment that he had definitely reached the decision to
separate from Stimbol that one of the greatest obstacles they would
have to overcome to carry out the plan would be to find sufficient
men willing to submit themselves to Stimbol's ideas of discipline,
properly to transport his luggage and provisions and guard them and
him.</p>

<p>As Stimbol passed and saw the two piles of equipment the frown
upon his face deepened. "I see you've got the stuff laid out," he
remarked, as he halted before Blake.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted you to look it over and see that it is
satisfactorily divided before I have it packed."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be bothered with it," replied the other. "I
know you wouldn't take any advantage of me on the division."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Blake.</p>

<p>"How about the porters?"</p>

<p>"That's not going to be so easy. You know you haven't treated
them very well and there will not be many of them anxious to return
with you."</p>

<p>"There's where you're dead wrong, Blake. The trouble with you is
that you don't know anything about natives. You're too easy with
'em. They haven't any respect for you, and the man they don't
respect they don't like. They know that a fellow who beats 'em is
their master, and they know that a master is going to look after
them. They wouldn't want to trust themselves on a long trek with
you. You divided the junk, now let me handle the men&mdash;that's
more in my line&mdash;and I'll see that you get a square deal and a
good, safe bunch, and I'll put the fear of God into 'em so they
won't dare be anything but loyal to you."</p>

<p>"Just how do you propose selecting the men?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place I'd like you to have those men who may
wish to accompany you&mdash;I'll grant there are a few&mdash;so
we'll just have 'em all up, explain that we are separating, and
I'll tell all those who wish to return with your safari to step
forward, then I'll choose some good men from what are left and make
up enough that way to complete your quota&mdash;see? That's fair
enough, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's quite fair," agreed Blake. He was hoping that the plan
would work out as easily as Stimbol appeared to believe that it
would, but he was far from believing and so he thought it best to
suggest an alternative that he was confident would have to be
resorted to in the end. "In the event that one of us has difficulty
in securing the requisite number of volunteers," he said, "I
believe that we can enlist the necessary men by offering a bonus to
be paid upon safe arrival at railhead. If I am short of men I shall
be willing to do so."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea if you're afraid you can't hold 'em together
after I leave you," said Stimbol. "It will be an added factor of
safety for you, too; but as for me my men will live up to their
original agreement or there'll be some mighty sick porters in these
parts. What say we have 'em up and find out just how much of a job
we've got on our hands?" He glanced about until his eyes fell on a
head man. "Here, you!" he called. "Come here and make it
snappy."</p>

<p>The black approached and stopped before the two white men. "You
called me, Bwana?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Gather up every one in camp," directed Stimbol. "Have them up
here in five minutes for a palaver&mdash;every last man-jack of
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bwana."</p>

<p>As the head man withdrew Stimbol turned to Blake. "Any stranger
in camp today?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, why?"</p>

<p>"Ran across a wild man while I was hunting," replied Stimbol.
"He ordered me out of the jungle. What do you know about that?" and
Stimbol laughed.</p>

<p>"A wild man?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Some crazy nut I suppose. The <a title=
"native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a> seemed to know about him."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Calls himself Tarzan."</p>

<p>Blake elevated his brows. "Ah!" he exclaimed. "You have met
Tarzan of the Apes and he has ordered you out of the jungle?"</p>

<p>"You've heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and if he ever orders me out of his jungle, I'll
go."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> would, but not Wilbur Stimbol."</p>

<p>"Why did he order you out?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"He just ordered me out, that's all. Wouldn't let me shoot a
gorilla I'd been stalking. The fellow saved the gorilla from a
python, killed the python, ordered me out of the jungle, said he'd
visit us in camp later and walked away with the gorilla like they
were old pals. I never saw anything like it, but it doesn't make
any difference to me who or what he thinks he is, I know who and
what I am and it's going to take more than a half-wit to scare me
out of this country till I'm good and ready to go."</p>

<p>"So you think Tarzan of the Apes is a half-wit?"</p>

<p>"I think anyone's a half-wit who'd run about this jungle naked
and unarmed."</p>

<p>"You'll find he's not a half-wit, Stimbol; and unless you want
to get in more trouble than you ever imagined existed, you'll do
just as Tarzan of the Apes tells you to do."</p>

<p>"What do you know about him? Have you ever seen him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Blake. "But I have heard a lot about him from our
men. He's as much a part of this locality as the jungle, or the
lions. Very few, if any, of our men have seen him, but he has the
same hold upon their imaginations and superstitions as any of their
demons, and they are even more fearful of incurring his
displeasure. If they think Tarzan has it in for us we're out of
luck."</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to say is that if this monkey-man knows when
he's well off he'll not come butting into the affairs of Wilbur
Stimbol."</p>

<p>"And he's coming to visit us, is he?" said Blake. "Well, I
certainly want to see him. I've heard of little else since we
struck his country."</p>

<p>"It's funny I never heard of him," said Stimbol.</p>

<p>"You never talk with the men," Blake reminded him.</p>

<p>"Gad, it seems as though I'm doing nothing but talk to them,"
grumbled Stimbol.</p>

<p>"I said, talk <i>with</i> them."</p>

<p>"I don't chum with porters," sneered Stimbol.</p>

<p>Blake grinned.</p>

<p>"Here are the men," said Stimbol. He turned toward the waiting
porters and <a title="native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a> and
cleared his throat. "Mr. Blake and I are going to separate," he
announced. "Everything has been divided. I am going to hunt a
little farther to the west, make a circle toward the south and
return to the coast by a new route. I do not know what Mr. Blake's
plans are, but he is going to get half the porters and half the
<a title="native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a>, and I want to tell
you right now that there isn't going to be any funny business about
it. Half of you are going with Mr. Blake whether you like it or
not."</p>

<p>He paused, impressively, to let the full weight of his
pronouncement sink home. "As usual," he continued, "I wish to keep
everyone contented and happy, so I'm going to give you who may want
to go with Mr. Blake an opportunity to do so. Now listen! The packs
over on that side are Mr. Blake's; those on this side are mine. All
those who are willing to accompany Mr. Blake go over on that
side!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation upon the part of the men and
then some of them moved quietly over among Blake's packs. Others
followed as their understandings slowly grasped the meaning of
Stimbol's words until all of the men stood upon Blake's side.</p>

<p>Stimbol turned to Blake with a laugh and a shake of his head.
"Gad!" he exclaimed. "Did you ever see such a dumb bunch? No one
could have explained the thing more simply than I and yet look at
'em! Not one of them understood me!"</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of that, Stimbol?" inquired Blake.</p>

<p>Stimbol did not immediately grasp the insinuation. When he did
he scowled. "Don't be a fool," he snapped. "Of course they
misunderstood me." He turned angrily toward the men. "You
thick-skulled, black idiots! Can't you understand anything?" he
demanded. "I did not say that you all had to go with Mr.
Blake&mdash;only those who wished to. Now the rest of
you&mdash;those who wish to accompany me&mdash;get back over here
on this side with my packs, and step lively!"</p>

<p>No one moved in the direction of Stimbol's packs. The man
flushed.</p>

<p>"This is mutiny!" he stormed. "Whoever is at the bottom of this
is going to suffer. Come here, you!" He motioned to a head man.
"Who put you fellows up to this? Has Mr. Blake been telling you
what to do?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Stimbol," said Blake. "No one has influenced
the men and there is no mutiny. The plan was yours. The men have
done just what you told them to. If it had not been for your
insufferable egotism you would have known precisely what the
outcome would be. These black men are human beings. In some
respects they are extremely sensitive human beings, and in many
ways they are like children. You strike them, you curse them, you
insult them and they will fear you and hate you. You have done all
these things to them and they do fear you and hate you. You have
sowed and now you are reaping. I hope to God that it will teach you
a lesson. There is just one way to get your men and that is to
offer them a big bonus. Are you willing to do that?"</p>

<p>Stimbol, his self assurance momentarily shaken at last, wilted
in the face of the realization that Blake was right. He looked
about helplessly for a moment. The blacks, sullen-faced, stood
there like dumb beasts, staring at him. In all those eyes there was
no single friendly glance. He turned back to Blake. "See what you
can do with them," he said.</p>

<p>Blake faced the men. "It will be necessary for half of you to
accompany Mr. Stimbol back to the coast," he said. "He will pay
double wages to all those who go with him, provided that you serve
him loyally. Talk it over among yourselves and send word to us
later by your head man. That is all. You may go."</p>

<p>The balance of the afternoon passed, the two white men keeping
to their respective tents; the blacks gathered in groups,
whispering. Blake and Stimbol no longer messed together, but after
the evening meal each appeared with his pipe to await the report of
the head men. After half an hour Blake sent his boy to summon them
and presently they came and stood before the young man.</p>

<p>"Well, have the men decided who will accompany Mr. Stimbol?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No one will accompany the old bwana," replied their spokesman.
"All will go with the young bwana."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Stimbol will pay them well," Blake reminded, "and half
of you must go with him."</p>

<p>The black shook his head. "He could not make the pay big
enough," he said. "No boy will go with him."</p>

<p>"You agreed to come out with us and return with us," said Blake.
"You must fulfill your agreement."</p>

<p>"We agreed to come out with both of you and return with both of
you. There was nothing said about returning separately. We will
live up to our agreement and the old bwana may return in safety
with the young bwana." There was finality in the tone of the
spokesman.</p>

<p>Blake thought for a moment before replying. "You may go," he
said. "I will talk with you again in the morning."</p>

<p>The blacks had departed but a moment when the figure of a man
appeared suddenly out of the darkness into the light of the camp
fire.</p>

<p>"Who the&mdash;oh, it's you is it?" exclaimed Stimbol. "Here's
the wild man, Blake."</p>

<p>The young American turned and surveyed the figure of the bronze
giant who was standing just within the circle of the firelight. He
noted the clean cut features, the quiet dignity, the majestic mien
and smiled inwardly at recollection of Stimbol's description of
this god-like creature&mdash;half-wit!</p>

<p>"So you are Tarzan of the Apes?" he said.</p>

<p>Tarzan inclined his head. "And you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am Jim Blake of New York," replied the American.</p>

<p>"Hunting of course?"</p>

<p>"With a camera."</p>

<p>"Your companion was using a rifle," Tarzan reminded him.</p>

<p>"I am not responsible for his acts. I cannot control them,"
replied Blake.</p>

<p>"Nor anyone else," snapped Stimbol.</p>

<p>Tarzan permitted his gaze to move to Stimbol for an instant, but
ignored his boast.</p>

<p>"I overheard the conversation between you and the head men," he
said, addressing Blake. "Some of your blacks had already told me
something about your companion, and twice today I have had an
opportunity to form an estimate of my own from personal
observation, so I assume that you are separating because you cannot
agree. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," acknowledged Blake.</p>

<p>"And after you separate&mdash;what are your plans?"</p>

<p>"I intend to push in a little farther west and then
swing&mdash;" commenced Stimbol.</p>

<p>"I was speaking to Blake," interrupted Tarzan; "my plans
concerning you are already made."</p>

<p>"Well, who the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" admonished the ape-man. "Go ahead, Blake!"</p>

<p>"We have not had much luck so far," replied Blake, "principally
because we never can agree on methods. The result is that I have
scarcely a single decent wild animal study. I had planned to go
north a way in search of lion pictures. I dislike going back
without anything to show for the time and money I have put into the
expedition, but now that the men have refused to accompany us
separately there is nothing for it but to return to the coast by
the shortest route."</p>

<p>"You two don't seem to be taking me into consideration at all,"
grumbled Stimbol. "I've got as much money and time in this trip as
Blake. You forget that I'm here to hunt, and what's more I'm going
to hunt and I'm not going straight back to the coast by a damned
sight, monkey-man or no monkey-man."</p>

<p>Again Tarzan ignored Stimbol. "Get ready to move out about an
hour after sunrise," he said to Blake. "There will be no trouble
about dividing the safari. I shall be here to attend to that and
give you your final instructions," and as he spoke he turned and
disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; ARA THE LIGHTNING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BEFORE dawn the camp was astir and by the
appointed hour the packs were made and all was in readiness. The
porters loitered, awaiting the word that would start the safari
upon its eastward journey toward the coast. Blake and Stimbol
smoked in silence. The foliage of a nearby tree moved to the
swaying of a branch and Tarzan of the Apes dropped lightly into the
camp. Exclamations of surprise broke from the lips of the
Negroes&mdash;surprise clearly tinged with terror. The ape-man
turned toward them and addressed them in their own dialect.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," he said, "Lord of the Jungle. You
have brought white men into my country to kill my people. I am
displeased. Those of you who wish to live to return to your
villages and your families will listen well and do as Tarzan
commands.</p>

<p>"You," he pointed at the chief head man, "shall accompany the
younger white man whom I will permit to make pictures in my country
where and when he will. Select half the men of the safari to
accompany the young bwana."</p>

<p>"And you," he addressed another head man, "take those men that
remain and escort the older bwana to railhead in the most direct
route and without delay. He is not permitted to hunt and there will
be no killing except for food or self-defense. Do not fail me.
Remember always that Tarzan watches and Tarzan never forgets."</p>

<p>He turned then to the white men. "Blake," he said, "the
arrangements are made. You may leave when you please, with your own
safari, and go where you please. The question of hunting is left to
your own discretion&mdash;you are the guest of Tarzan."</p>

<p>"And you," he addressed Stimbol, "will be taken directly out of
the country by the shortest route. You will be permitted to carry
firearms for use in self-defense. If you abuse this permission they
will be taken away from you. Do not hunt, even for food&mdash;your
head man will attend to that."</p>

<p>"Now just hold your horses," blustered Stimbol. "If you think
I'm going to put up with any such high-handed interference with my
rights as an American citizen you're very much mistaken. Why I
could buy and sell you and your damned jungle forty times and not
know that I'd spent a cent. For God's sake, Blake, tell this poor
fool who I am before he gets himself into a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to the head man he had selected for Stimbol. "You
may up-load and march," he said. "If this white man does not follow
you, leave him behind. Take good care of him if he obeys me and
deliver him safely at railhead. Obey his orders if they do not
conflict with those that I have given you. Go!"</p>

<p>A moment later Stimbol's safari was preparing to depart and, at
Tarzan's request, Blake's too was moving out of camp. Stimbol swore
and threatened, but his men, sullenly ignoring him, filed off into
the jungle toward the east. Tarzan had departed, swinging into the
trees and disappearing among the foliage, and at last Stimbol stood
alone in the deserted camp.</p>

<p>Thwarted, humiliated, almost frothing with rage he ran after his
men, screaming commands and threats that were ignored. Later in the
day, sullen and silent, he marched near the head of the long file
of porters and <a title="native soldiers"><i>askari</i></a>,
convinced at last that the power of the ape-man was greater than
his; but in his heart burned resentment and in his mind rioted
plans for vengeance&mdash;plans that he knew were futile.</p>

<p>Tarzan, wishing to assure himself that his instructions were
being carried out, had swung far ahead and was waiting in the
crotch of a tree that overhung the trail along which Stimbol must
pass. In the distance he could hear the sounds that arose from the
marching safari. Along the trail from the opposite direction
something was approaching. The ape-man could not see it but he knew
what it was. Above the tree tops black clouds rolled low, but no
air stirred in the jungle.</p>

<p>Along the trail came a great, shaggy, black man-thing. Tarzan of
the Apes hailed it as it came in sight of his arboreal perch.</p>

<p>"Bolgani!" he called in low tones.</p>

<p>The gorilla stopped. He stood erect upon his hind feet and
looked about.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>Bolgani grunted. "I am Bolgani," he replied.</p>

<p>"The Tarmangani comes," warned Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I kill!" growled Bolgani.</p>

<p>"Let the Tarmangani pass," said Tarzan. "He and his people have
many thunder sticks. I have sent this Tarmangani out of the jungle.
Let him pass. Go a little way from the trail&mdash;the stupid
Gomangani and the Tarmangani, who is stupider, will pass by without
knowing that Tarzan and Bolgani are near."</p>

<p>From the darkening sky distant thunder boomed and the two beasts
looked upward toward the broad field of Nature's powers, more
savage and destructive than their own.</p>

<p>"Pand the thunder hunts in the sky," remarked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Hunts for Usha the wind," said Bolgani.</p>

<p>"Presently we shall hear Usha fleeing through the trees to
escape." Tarzan viewed the lowering, black clouds. "Even Kudu the
sun fears Pand, hiding his face when Pand hunts."</p>

<p>Ara the lightning shot through the sky. To the two beasts it was
a bolt from Pand's bow and the great drops of rain that commenced
to fall shortly after was Meeta, the blood of Usha the wind,
pouring from many a wound.</p>

<p>The jungle bent to a great pressure but as yet there was no
other noise than the rolling thunder. The trees whipped back and
Usha tore through the forest. The darkness increased. The rain fell
in great masses. Leaves and branches hurtled through the air, trees
crashed amongst their fellows. With deafening roars the elements
unleashed their pent anger. The beasts cowered beneath the one
awe-inspiring power that they acknowledged as supreme.</p>

<p>Tarzan crouched in the crotch of a great tree with his shoulders
arched against the beating rain. Just off the trail Bolgani
squatted in drenched and bedraggled misery. They waited. There was
nothing else that they could do.</p>

<p>Above them the storm broke again with maniacal fury. The thunder
crashed with deafening reverberation. There was a blinding flash of
light and the branch upon which Tarzan squatted sagged and hurtled
to the trail beneath.</p>

<p>Stunned, the ape-man lay where he had fallen, the great branch
partially across his body.</p>

<p>As quickly as it had come, the storm departed. Kudu the sun
burst through the clouds. Bolgani, dejected and still terrified,
remained where he had squatted, motionless and silent. Bolgani had
no desire to attract the attention of Pand the thunder.</p>

<p><br>SOAKED with water, cold, furious, Stimbol slopped along the
slippery, muddy trail. He did not know that his safari was some
little distance behind him, for he had forged ahead during the
storm while they had taken refuge beneath the trees.</p>

<p>At a turn in the trail he came suddenly upon a fallen branch
that blocked the way. At first he did not see the body of the man
lying beneath it, but when he did he recognized it instantly and a
new hope sprang to life within his breast. With Tarzan dead he
could be free to do as he pleased, but was the ape-man dead?</p>

<p>Stimbol ran forward and, kneeling, placed an ear to the breast
of the prostrate figure. An expression of disappointment crossed
his face&mdash;Tarzan was not dead. The expression upon Stimbol's
face changed&mdash;a cunning look came into his eyes as he glanced
back down the trail. His men were not in sight! He looked quickly
about him. He was alone with the unconscious author of his
humiliation!</p>

<p>He thought he was alone. He did not see the shaggy figure that
had silently arisen as the sound of Stimbol's approach had come to
its sensitive ears and was now peering at him through the
foliage&mdash;peering at him and at the silent figure of the
ape-man.</p>

<p>Stimbol drew his hunting knife from its scabbard. He could slip
its point into the wild man's heart and run back down the trail.
His men would find him waiting for them. Later they would come upon
the dead Tarzan, but they would not guess how he had met his
end.</p>

<p>The ape-man moved&mdash;consciousness was returning. Stimbol
realized that he must act quickly, and at the same instant a great
hairy arm reached out through the foliage and a mighty hand closed
upon his shoulder. With a screaming curse he turned to look into
the hideous face of Bolgani. He tried to strike at the shaggy
breast of his antagonist with his hunting knife, but the puny
weapon was torn from his grasp and hurled into the bushes.</p>

<p>The great yellow fangs were bared against Stimbol's throat as
Tarzan opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Kreeg-ah!" cried the ape-man in warning.</p>

<p>Bolgani paused and looked at his fellow beast.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"The Tarmangani would have killed Tarzan," explained the
gorilla. "Bolgani stopped him. Bolgani kill!" He growled
horribly.</p>

<p>"No!" snapped Tarzan. "Free the Tarmangani!"</p>

<p>The gorilla released his grasp upon Stimbol just as the first of
the hunter's men came in sight of them, and as Bolgani saw the
blacks and how numerous they were his nervousness and irritability
increased.</p>

<p>"Take to the jungle, Bolgani," said Tarzan. "Tarzan will take
care of this Tarmangani and the Gomangani."</p>

<p>With a parting growl the gorilla merged with the foliage and the
shadows of the jungle as Tarzan of the Apes faced Stimbol and his
boys.</p>

<p>"You had a close call then, Stimbol," said the ape-man. "It is
fortunate for you that you didn't succeed in killing me. I was here
for two reasons. One was to see that you obeyed my instructions and
the other to protect you from your men. I did not like the way they
eyed you in camp this morning. It would not be a difficult thing to
lose you in the jungle, you know, and that would put a period to
you as surely as poison or a knife. I felt a certain responsibility
for you because you are a white man, but you have just now released
me from whatever obligation racial ties may have influenced me to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>"I shall not kill you, Stimbol, as you deserve; but from now on
you may reach the coast on your own, and you will doubtless
discover that one cannot make too many friends in the jungle or
afford a single unnecessary enemy." He wheeled upon Stimbol's black
boys. "Tarzan of the Apes goes his way. You will not see him again,
perhaps. Do your duty by this white man as long as he obeys the
word of Tarzan, <i>but see that he does not hunt</i>!"</p>

<p>With this final admonition the ape-man swung into the lower
branches and was gone.</p>

<p>When Stimbol, after repeatedly questioning his men, discovered
that Tarzan had practically assured them that they would see no
more of him, he regained much of his former assurance and
egotistical bluster. Once more he was the leader of men, shouting
at the blacks in a loud tone, cursing them, ridiculing them. He
thought that it impressed them with his greatness. He believed that
they were simple people whom he could deceive into thinking that he
was not afraid of Tarzan, and by flaunting Tarzan's commands win
their respect. Now that Tarzan had promised not to return Stimbol
felt safer in ignoring his wishes, and so it befell that just
before they reached a camping ground Stimbol came upon an antelope
and without an instant's hesitation fired and killed it.</p>

<p>It was a sullen camp that Stimbol made that night. The men
gathered in groups and whispered. "He has shot an antelope and
Tarzan will be angry with us," said one.</p>

<p>"He will punish us," said a head man.</p>

<p>"The bwana is a bad man," said another. "I wish he was
dead."</p>

<p>"We may not kill him. Tarzan has said that."</p>

<p>"If we leave him in the jungle he will die."</p>

<p>"Tarzan told us to do our duty."</p>

<p>"He said to do it as long as the bad bwana obeyed the commands
of Tarzan."</p>

<p>"He has disobeyed them."</p>

<p>"Then we may leave him."</p>

<p>Stimbol, exhausted by the long march, slept like a log. When he
awoke the sun was high. He shouted for his boy. There was no
response. Again he shouted and louder, adding an oath. No one came.
There was no sound in camp.</p>

<p>"The lazy swine," he grumbled. "They'll step a little livelier
when I get out there."</p>

<p>He arose and dressed, but as he was dressing the silence of the
camp came to impress him as something almost menacing, so that he
hastened to be through and out of the tent As he stepped into the
open the truth was revealed at almost the first quick glance about.
Not a human being was in sight and all but one of the packs
containing provisions were gone. He had been deserted in the heart
of Africa!</p>

<p>His first impulse was to seize his rifle and start after the
blacks, but second thought impressed him with the danger of such
procedure and convinced him that the last thing he should do would
be to place himself again in the power of these men who had
demonstrated that they felt no compunction in abandoning him to
almost certain death. If they wanted to be rid of him they could
easily find even a quicker means if he returned and forced himself
upon them again.</p>

<p>There was but a single alternative and that was to find Blake
and remain with him. He knew that Blake would not abandon him to
death in the jungle.</p>

<p>The blacks had not left him without provisions, nor had they
taken his rifle or ammunition, but the difficulty that now
confronted Stimbol was largely in the matter of transportation for
his food. There was plenty of it to last many days, but he knew
that he could not carry it through the jungle together with his
rifle and ammunition. To remain where the food was would be equally
futile. Blake was returning to the coast by another route; the
ape-man had said that he would not follow Stimbol's safari farther;
it might be years, therefore, before another human being chanced
along this little used game trail.</p>

<p>He knew that he and Blake were now separated by about two
marches and if he traveled light and Blake did not march too
rapidly he might hope to overtake him inside a week. Perhaps Blake
would find good camera hunting soon and make a permanent camp. In
that case Stimbol would find him even more quickly.</p>

<p>He felt better when he had definitely decided upon a plan of
action, and after a good breakfast he made up a small pack of
provisions, enough to last him a week, filled his belts and pockets
with ammunition and started off along the back trail.</p>

<p>It was easy going for the trail of the day before was plain and
this was the third time that Stimbol had been over it, so he had no
difficulty in reaching the camp at which he and Blake had parted
company.</p>

<p>As he entered the little clearing early in the afternoon he
determined to keep on and cover as much ground on Blake's trail as
he could before dark, but for a few minutes he would rest.
<i>As</i> he sat down with his back against the bole of a tree he
did not notice a movement of the tops of a clump of jungle grasses
a few yards distant, and if he had he would, doubtless, have
attached no importance to the matter.</p>

<p>Finishing a cigarette Stimbol arose, rearranged his pack and
started off in the direction Blake's men had taken early the
preceding morning; but he had covered but a yard or two when he was
brought to a sudden halt by an ominous growl that arose from a
little clump of jungle grasses close in front of him. Almost
simultaneously the fringing grasses parted and there appeared in
the opening the head of a great black-maned lion.</p>

<p>With a scream of fear, Stimbol dropped his pack, threw aside his
rifle and started on a run for the tree beneath which he had been
sitting. The lion, itself somewhat surprised, stood for an instant
watching him and then started in pursuit at an easy lope.</p>

<p>Stimbol, casting an affrighted glance rearward, was
horrified&mdash;the lion seemed so close and the tree so far away.
If distance lends enchantment to the view, proximity may also at
times have its advantage. In this instance it served to accelerate
the speed of the fleeing man to a most surprising degree, and
though he was no longer young he clawed his way to the lower
branches of the tree with speed, if not with grace, that would have
done justice to a trained athlete.</p>

<p>Nor was he an instant too speedy. Numa's raking talons touched
his boot and sent him swarming up among the higher branches, where
he clung weak and panting looking down into the snarling visage of
the carnivore.</p>

<p>For a moment Numa growled up at him and then, with a coughing
grunt, turned away and strode majestically in the direction of the
clump of grasses from which he had emerged. He stopped to sniff at
the pack of provisions Stimbol had discarded and, evidently piqued
by the man scent clinging to it, cuffed at it angrily. It rolled to
one side and Numa stepped back, eyeing it warily, then, with a
growl, he leaped upon it and commenced to maul the insensate thing,
ripping and tearing until its contents were scattered about upon
the ground. He bit into tins and boxes until scarcely an article
remained intact, while Stimbol crouched in the tree and watched the
destruction of his provisions, utterly helpless to interfere.</p>

<p>A dozen times he cursed himself for having thrown away his rifle
and even more frequently he vowed vengeance. He consoled himself,
however, with the realization that Blake could not be far away and
that with Blake there were ample provisions which could be
augmented by trading and hunting. When the lion left he would
descend and follow Blake's trail.</p>

<p>Numa, tired of the contents of the pack, resumed his way toward
the long grass, but again his attention was distracted&mdash;this
time by the thunder stick of the Tarmangani. The lion smelled of
the discarded rifle, pawed it and finally picked it up between his
jaws. Stimbol looked on, horrified. What if the beast damaged the
weapon? He would be left without means of defense or for obtaining
food!</p>

<p>"Drop it!" shouted Stimbol. "Drop it!"</p>

<p>Numa, ignoring the ravings of the despised man-thing, strode
into his lair, carrying the rifle with him.</p>

<p>That afternoon and night spelled an eternity of terror for
Wilbur Stimbol. While daylight lasted the lion remained in the
nearby patch of grass effectually deterring the unhappy man from
continuing his search for Blake's camp, and after night fell no
urge whatever could have induced Stimbol to descend to the
paralyzing terrors of the jungle night even had he known that the
lion had departed and no sounds had apprised him of the near
presence of danger; but sounds did apprise him. From shortly after
dark until nearly dawn a perfect bedlam of howls and growls and
coughs and grunts and barks arose from directly beneath him as if
there had been held a convention of all the horrid beasts of the
jungle at the foot of the tree that seemed at best an extremely
insecure sanctuary.</p>

<p>When morning came the jungle lay silent and peaceful about him
and only torn canvas and empty cans bore mute evidence to the feast
of the hyenas that had passed into jungle history. Numa had
departed leaving the remains of the kill upon which he had lain as
the pice de rsistance of the hyenian banquet for which Stimbol
had furnished the hors d'oeuvres.</p>

<p>Stimbol, trembling, descended. Through the jungle, wild-eyed,
startled by every sound, scurried a pitiful figure of broken,
terror stricken old age. Few could have recognized in it Wilbur
Stimbol of Stimbol and Company, brokers, New York.</p>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE CROSS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE storm that had overtaken Stimbol's safari
wrought even greater havoc with the plans of Jim Blake, altering in
the instant of a single blinding flash of lightning the course of
his entire life.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a single black, who carried his camera and an
extra rifle, Blake had struck out from the direct route of his
safari in search of lion pictures, there being every indication
that the great carnivores might be found in abundance in the
district through which they were passing.</p>

<p>It was his intention to parallel the route of his main body and
rejoin it in camp in the afternoon. The boy who accompanied him was
intelligent and resourceful, the direction and speed of the
marching safari were mutually agreed upon and the responsibility
for bringing Blake into camp safely was left entirely to the Negro.
Having every confidence in the boy, Blake gave no heed to either
time or direction, devoting all his energies to the fascinating
occupation of searching for photographic studies.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving the safari Blake and his companion
encountered a herd of seven or eight lions which included a
magnificent old male, an old lioness and five or six young, ranging
from half to full grown.</p>

<p>At sight of Blake and his companion the lions took off leisurely
through rather open forest and the men followed, awaiting patiently
the happy coincidence of time, light and grouping that would give
the white man such a picture as he desired.</p>

<p>In the mind of the black man was pictured the route of the
safari and its relation to the meanderings of the quarry. He knew
how far and in what directions he and his companion were being led
from their destination. To have returned to the trail of the safari
would have been a simple matter to him, but Blake, depending
entirely upon the black, gave no heed either to time or
direction.</p>

<p>For two hours they clung doggedly to the spoor, encouraged by
occasional glimpses of now one, now several members of the regal
group, but never was the opportunity afforded for a successful
shot. Then the sky became rapidly overcast by black clouds and a
few moments later the storm broke in all the terrific fury that
only an Equatorial storm can achieve, and an instant later amidst
the deafening roar of thunder and a blinding flash of lightning
utter disaster engulfed James Hunter Blake.</p>

<p>How long he lay, stunned by the shock of the bolt that had
struck but a few feet from him, he did not know. When he opened his
eyes the storm had passed and the sun was shining brightly through
the leafy canopy of the forest. Still dazed, uncomprehending the
cause or extent of the catastrophe, he raised himself slowly upon
an elbow and looked about him.</p>

<p>One of the first sights that met his eyes aided materially in
the rapid recovery of his senses. Less than a hundred feet from him
stood a group of lions, seven of them, solemnly regarding him. The
characteristics of individual lions differ as greatly from those of
their fellows as do the characteristics of individuals of the human
race and, even as a human being, a lion may have his moods as well
as his personal idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>These lions that gravely inspected the man-thing had been spared
any considerable experience with the human species; they had seen
but few men; they had never been hunted; they were well fed; Blake
had done nothing greatly to upset their easily irritated nervous
systems. Fortunately for him they were merely curious.</p>

<p>But Blake did not know all this. He knew only that seven lions
were standing within a hundred feet of him, that they were not in a
cage, and that while he had pursued them to obtain photographs, the
thing that he most desired at the moment was not his camera but his
rifle.</p>

<p>Stealthily, that he might not annoy them, he looked about him
for the weapon. To his consternation it was nowhere in sight, nor
was his gun bearer with the extra rifle. Where could the boy be?
Doubtless, frightened by the lions, he had decamped. Twenty feet
away was a most inviting tree. Blake wondered if the lions would
charge the moment that he rose to his feet. He tried to remember
all that he had heard about lions and he did recall one fact that
applies with almost axiomatic verity to all dangerous animals
&mdash;if you run from them they will pursue you. To reach the tree
it would be necessary to walk almost directly toward the lions.</p>

<p>Blake was in a quandary, and then one of the younger lions moved
a few steps nearer! That settled the matter as far as Blake was
concerned, for the closer the lions came the shorter his chance of
gaining the tree ahead of them in the event that they elected to
prevent.</p>

<p>In the midst of a tremendous forest, entirely surrounded by
trees, Nature had chosen to strike him down almost in the center of
a natural clearing. There was a good tree a hundred feet away and
on the opposite side of the clearing from the lions. Blake stole a
longing glance at it and then achieved some rapid mental
calculations. If he ran for the farther tree the lions would have
to cover two hundred feet while he was covering one hundred, while
if he chose the nearer tree, they must come eighty feet while he
was going twenty. There seemed, therefore, no doubt as to the
greater desirability of the nearer tree which ruled favorite by
odds of two to one. Against it, however, loomed the mental hazard
that running straight into the face of seven lions involved.</p>

<p>Jim Blake was sincerely, genuinely and honestly scared; but
unless the lions were psychoanalysts they would never have dreamed
the truth as he started nonchalantly and slowly toward
them&mdash;and the tree. The most difficult feat that he had ever
accomplished lay in making his legs behave themselves. They wanted
to run. So did his feet and his heart and his brain. Only his will
held them in leash.</p>

<p>Those were tense moments for Jim Blake&mdash;the first half
dozen steps he took with seven great lions watching his approach.
He saw that they were becoming nervous. The lioness moved uneasily.
The old male growled. A younger male, he who had started forward,
lashed his sides with his tail, flattened his head, bared his fangs
and stealthily approached.</p>

<p>Blake was almost at the tree when something happened&mdash;he
never knew what the cause, but inexplicably the lioness turned and
bounded away, voicing a low whine, and after her went the other
six.</p>

<p>The man leaned against the bole of the tree and fanned himself
with his helmet "Whew!" he breathed, "I hope the next lion I see is
in the Central Park Zoo."</p>

<p>But even lions were forgotten in the developments that the next
few moments revealed after repeated shouts for the black boy had
brought no response and Blake had determined that he must set out
in search of him. Nor did he have far to go. On the back track,
just inside the clearing, Blake found a few remnants of charred
flesh and a blackened and half molten rifle barrel. Of the camera
not a vestige remained. The bolt that had bowled Blake over must
have squarely struck his gun bearer, killing him instantly,
exploding all the ammunition, destroying the camera and ruining the
rifle that he had carried.</p>

<p>But what had become of the rifle that had been in Blake's hands?
The man searched in all directions, but could not find it and was
finally forced to the conclusion that its disappearance could be
attributed only to one of those freakish tricks which severe
electrical storms so often play upon helpless and futile
humanity.</p>

<p>Frankly aware that he was lost and had not the faintest
conception of the direction in which lay the proposed camp of his
safari, Blake started blindly off on what he devoutly hoped would
prove the right route. It was not. His safari was moving northeast.
Blake headed north.</p>

<p>For two days he trudged on through dense forest, sleeping at
night among the branches of trees. Once his fitful slumbers were
disturbed by the swaying of a branch against which he was braced.
As he awoke he felt it sag as to the weight of some large animal.
He looked and saw two fiery eyes gleaming in the dark. Blake knew
it to be a leopard as he drew his automatic and fired point blank.
With a hideous scream the great cat sprang or fell to the ground.
Blake never knew if he hit it. It did not return and there were no
signs of it in the morning.</p>

<p>He found food and water in abundance, and upon the morning of
the third day he emerged from the forest at the foot of a range of
lofty mountains and for the first time in weeks reveled in an
unobstructed view of the blue sky and saw the horizon again and all
that lay between himself and it. He had not realized that he had
been depressed by the darkness and the crowding pressure of the
trees, but now he experienced all the spiritual buoyancy of a
released convict long immured from freedom and the light of day.
Rescue was no longer problematical, merely a matter of time. He
wanted to sing and shout; but he conserved his energies and started
toward the mountains. There had been no native villages in the
forest and so, he reasoned, as there must be native villages in a
well-watered country stocked with game, he would find them upon the
mountain slopes.</p>

<p>Topping a rise he saw below him the mouth of a canyon in the bed
of which ran a small stream. A village would be built on water.</p>

<p>If he followed the water he would come to the village. Quite
easy! He descended to the stream where he was deeply gratified to
find that a well-worn path paralleled it. Encouraged by the belief
that he would soon encounter natives and believing that he would
have no difficulty in enlisting their services in aiding him to
relocate his safari, Blake followed the path upward into the
canyon.</p>

<p>He had covered something like three miles without having
discovered any sign of habitation when, at a turn in the path, he
found himself at the foot of a great white cross of enormous
proportions. Hewn from limestone, it stood directly in the center
of the trail and towered above him fully sixty feet. Checked and
weatherworn, it gave an impression of great antiquity, which was
further borne out by the remains of an almost obliterated
inscription upon the face of its massive base.</p>

<p>Blake examined the carved letters, but could not decipher their
message. The characters appeared of early English origin, but he
dismissed such a possibility as too ridiculous to entertain. He
knew that he could not be far from the southern boundary of
Abyssinia and that the Abyssinians are Christians. Thus he
explained the presence of the cross; but he could not explain the
suggestion of sinister menace that this lonely, ancient symbol of
the crucifix held for him. Why was it? What was it?</p>

<p>Standing there, tongueless, hoary with age, it seemed to call
upon him to stop, to venture not beyond it into the unknown; it
warned him back, but not, seemingly, out of a spirit of kindliness
and protection, but rather with arrogance and hate.</p>

<p>With a laugh Blake threw off the mood that had seized him and
went on; but as he passed the great white monolith he crossed
himself, though he was not a Catholic. He wondered what had
impelled him to the unfamiliar act, but he could no more explain it
than he could the strange and uncanny suggestion of power and
personality that seemed to surround the crumbling cross.</p>

<p>Another turn in the path and the trail narrowed where it passed
between two huge boulders that might have fallen from the cliff top
towering far above. Cliffs closed in closely now in front and upon
two sides. Apparently he was close to the canyon's head and yet
there was no slightest indication of a village. Yet where did the
trail lead? It had an end and a purpose. He would discover the
former and, if possible, the latter.</p>

<p>Still under the depressing influence of the cross, Blake passed
between the two boulders; and the instant that he had passed them a
man stepped out behind him and another in front. They were Negroes,
stalwart, fine-featured fellows, and in themselves nothing to
arouse wonder or surprise. Blake had expected to meet Negroes in
Africa; but not Negroes wearing elaborately decorated leathern
jerkins upon the breasts of which red crosses were emblazoned,
close fitting nether garments and sandals held by doeskin thongs,
cross gartered half way to their knees; not Negroes wearing close
fitting bassinets of leopard skin that fitted their heads closely
and reached to below their ears; not Negroes armed with two handed
broadswords and elaborately tipped pikes.</p>

<p>Blake was acutely aware of the pike tips as there was one
pressing against his belly and another in the small of his
back.</p>

<p>"Who are ye?" demanded the Negro that faced Blake.</p>

<p>Had the man addressed him in Greek Blake would have been no more
surprised than he was by the incongruity of this archaic form of
speech falling from the lips of a twentieth century central African
black. He was too dumbfounded for an instant to reply.</p>

<p>"Doubtless the fellow is a Saracen, Paul!" said the black behind
Blake, "and understandeth not what thou sayest&mdash;a spy,
perchance."</p>

<p>"Nay, Peter Wiggs, as my name is Paul Bodkin he is no
infidel&mdash;that I know of mine own good eyes."</p>

<p>"Whatsoe'er he is it is for thee to fetch him before the captain
of the gate who will question him, Paul Bodkin."</p>

<p>"Natheless there is no hurt in questioning him first, an he will
answer."</p>

<p>"Stop thy tongue and take him to the captain," said Peter. "I
will abide here and guard the way until thou returnest."</p>

<p>Paul stepped aside and motioned for Blake to precede him. Then
he fell in behind and the American did not need to glance back to
know that the ornate tip of the pike was ever threateningly
ready.</p>

<p>The way lay plain before him and Blake followed the trail toward
the cliffs where there presently appeared the black mouth of a
tunnel leading straight into the rocky escarpment. Leaning against
the sides of a niche just within the entrance were several torches
made of reeds or twigs bound tightly together and dipped in pitch.
One of these Paul Bodkin selected, took some tinder from a metal
box he carried in a pouch at his side, struck a spark to it with
flint and steel; and having thus ignited the tinder and lighted the
torch he pushed Blake on again with the tip of his pike and the two
entered the tunnel, which the American found to be narrow and
winding, well suited to defense. Its floor was worn smooth until
the stones of which it was composed shone polished in the flaring
of the torch. The sides and roof were black with the soot of
countless thousands, perhaps, of torch-lighted passages along this
strange way that led to&mdash;what?</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE SNAKE STRIKES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">UNVERSED in jungle craft, overwhelmed by the
enormity of the catastrophe that had engulfed him, his reasoning
faculties numbed by terror, Wilbur Stimbol slunk through the
jungle, the fleeing quarry of every terror that imagination could
conjure. Matted filth caked the tattered remnants of his clothing
that scarce covered the filth of his emaciated body. His once
graying hair had turned to white, matching the white stubble of a
four days' beard.</p>

<p>He followed a broad and well marked trail along which men and
horses, sheep and goats had passed within the week, and with the
blindness and ignorance of the city dweller he thought that he was
on the spoor of Blake's safari. Thus it came that he stumbled,
exhausted, into the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
the slow moving Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>Fejjuan, the Galla slave, discovered him and took him at once to
the sheikh's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> where Ibn Jad, with
his brother, Tollog, and several others were squatting in the
<a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
sipping coffee.</p>

<p>"By Allah! What strange creature hast thou captured now,
Fejjuan?" demanded the sheikh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a holy man," replied the black, "for he is very poor
and without weapons and very dirty&mdash;yes, surely he must be a
very holy man."</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" demanded Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"I am lost and starving. Give me food," begged Stimbol.</p>

<p>But neither understood the language of the other.</p>

<p>"Another <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," said
Fahd, contemptuously. "A <a title="Frenchman"><i>Frenjy</i></a>,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"He looks more like one of <a title=
"the English, Englishmen"><i>el-Engleys</i></a>," remarked
Tollog.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is from <a title="France"><i>Fransa</i></a>,"
suggested Ibn Jad. "Speak to him that vile tongue, Fahd, which thou
didst come by among the soldiers in Algeria."</p>

<p>"Who are you, stranger?" demanded Fahd, in French.</p>

<p>"I am an American," replied Stimbol, relieved and delighted to
have discovered a medium of communication with the Arabs. "<i>I</i>
have been lost in the jungle and I am starving."</p>

<p>"He is from the New World and he has been lost and is starving,"
translated Fahd.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad directed that food be brought, and as the stranger ate
they carried on a conversation through Fahd. Stimbol explained that
his men had deserted him and that he would pay well to be taken to
the coast. The Beduin had no desire to be further hampered by the
presence of a weak old man and was inclined to have Stimbol's
throat slit as the easiest solution of the problem, but Fahd, who
was impressed by the man's boastings of his great wealth, saw the
possibilities of a large reward or ransom and prevailed upon the
sheikh to permit Stimbol to remain among them for a time at least,
promising to take him into his own <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>
and be responsible for him.</p>

<p>"Ibn Jad would have slain you, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," said Fahd to Stimbol
later, "but Fahd saved you. Remember that when the time comes for
distributing the reward and remember, too, that Ibn Jad will be as
ready to kill you tomorrow as he was today and that always your
life is in the hands of Fahd. What is it worth?"</p>

<p>"I will make you rich," replied Stimbol.</p>

<p>During the days that followed, Fahd and Stimbol became much
better acquainted and with returning strength and a feeling of
security Stimbol's old boastfulness returned. He succeeded in
impressing the young Beduin with his vast wealth and importance,
and so lavish were his promises that Fahd soon commenced to see
before him a life of luxury, ease and power; but with growing
cupidity and ambition developed an increasing fear that someone
might wrest his good fortune from him. Ibn Jad being the most
logical and powerful competitor for the favors of the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, Fahd lost no opportunity
to impress upon Stimbol that the sheikh was still thirsting for his
blood; though, as a matter of fact, Ibn Jad was so little concerned
over the affairs of Wilbur Stimbol that he would have forgotten his
presence entirely were he not occasionally reminded of it by seeing
the man upon the march or about the camps.</p>

<p>One thing, however, that Fahd accomplished was to acquaint
Stimbol with the fact that there was dissension and treachery in
the ranks of the Beduins and this he determined to use to his own
advantage should necessity demand.</p>

<p>And ever, though slowly, the Arabs drew closer to the fabled
Leopard City of Nimmr, and as they marched Zeyd found opportunity
to forward his suit for the hand of Ateja, the daughter of Sheikh
Ibn Jad, while Tollog sought by insinuation to advance the claims
of Fahd in the eyes of the Sheikh. This he did always and only when
Fahd might hear as, in reality, his only wish was to impress upon
the young traitor the depth of the latter's obligation to him. When
Tollog should become sheikh he would not care who won the hand of
Ateja.</p>

<p>But Fahd was not satisfied with the progress that was being
made. Jealousy rode him to distraction until he could not look upon
Zeyd without thoughts of murder seizing his mind; at last they
obsessed him. He schemed continually to rid himself and the world
of his more successful rival. He spied upon him and upon Ateja, and
at last a plan unfolded itself with opportunity treading upon its
heels.</p>

<p>Fahd had noticed that nightly Zeyd absented himself from the
gatherings of the men in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of the sheikh's tent and that when the simple household duties were
performed Ateja slipped out into the night. Fahd followed and
confirmed what was really too apparent to be dignified by the name
of suspicion&mdash;Zeyd and Ateja met.</p>

<p>And then one night, Fahd was not at the meeting in the sheikh's
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>. Instead he hid near the tent of
Zeyd, and when the latter had left to keep his tryst Fahd crept in
and seized the matchlock of his rival. It was already loaded and he
had but to prime it with powder. Stealthily he crept by back ways
through the camp to where Zeyd awaited his light of love and
sneaked up behind him.</p>

<p>At a little distance, sitting in his <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
with his friends beneath the light of paper lanterns, Ibn Jad the
sheikh was plainly visible to the two young men standing in the
outer darkness. Ateja was still in the women's quarters.</p>

<p>Fahd, standing behind Zeyd, raised the ancient matchlock to his
shoulder and aimed&mdash;very carefully he aimed, but not at Zeyd.
No, for the cunning of Fahd was as the cunning of the fox. Had Zeyd
been murdered naught could ever convince Ateja that Fahd was not
the murderer. Fahd knew that, and he was equally sure that Ateja
would have naught of the slayer of her lover.</p>

<p>Beyond Zeyd was Ibn Jad, but Fahd was not aiming at Ibn Jad
either. At whom was he aiming? No one. Not yet was the time ripe to
slay the sheikh. First must they have their hands upon the
treasure, the secret of which he alone was supposed to hold.</p>

<p>Fahd aimed at one of the <a title=
"Arabic&mdash;a tent-pole"><i>am'jan</i></a> of the sheikh's tent.
He aimed with great care and then he pulled the trigger. The prop
splintered and broke a foot above the level of Ibn Jad's head, and
simultaneously Fahd threw down the musket and leaped upon the
startled Zeyd, at the same time crying loudly for help.</p>

<p>Startled by the shot and the cries, men ran from all directions
and with them was the sheikh. He found Zeyd being held tightly from
behind by Fahd.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" demanded Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"By Allah, Ibn Jad, he would have slain thee!" cried Fahd. "I
came upon him just in time, and as he fired I leaped upon his back,
else he would have killed you."</p>

<p>"He lies!" cried Zeyd. "The shot came from behind me. If any
fired upon Ibn Jad it was Fahd himself."</p>

<p>Ateja, wide-eyed, ran to her lover. "Thou didst not do it, Zeyd;
tell me that thou didst not do it."</p>

<p>"As Allah is my God and Mohammed his prophet I did not do it,"
swore Zeyd.</p>

<p>"I would not have thought it of him," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>Cunning, Fahd did not mention the matchlock. Shrewdly he guessed
that its evidence would be more potent if discovered by another
than he, and that it would be discovered he was sure. Nor was he
wrong. Tollog found it.</p>

<p>"Here," he exclaimed, "is the weapon."</p>

<p>"Let us examine it beneath the light," said Ibn Jad. "It should
dispel our doubts more surely than any lying tongue."</p>

<p>As the party moved in the direction of the sheikh's <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> Zeyd experienced the relief of one reprieved
from death, for he knew that the testimony of the matchlock would
exonerate him. It could not be his. He pressed the hand of Ateja,
walking at his side.</p>

<p>Beneath the light of the paper lanterns in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
Ibn Jad held the weapon beneath his gaze as, with craning necks,
the others pressed about him. A single glance sufficed. With stern
visage the sheikh raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"It is Zeyd's," he said.</p>

<p>Ateja gasped and drew away from her lover.</p>

<p>"I did not do it! It is some trick," cried Zeyd.</p>

<p>"Take him away!" commanded Ibn Jad. "See that he is tightly
bound."</p>

<p>Ateja rushed to her father and fell upon her knees. "Do not slay
him!" she cried. "It could not have been he. I know it was not
he."</p>

<p>"Silence, girl!" commanded the sheikh sternly. "Go to thy
quarters and remain there!"</p>

<p>They took Zeyd to his own <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and
bound him securely, and in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of the sheikh the elders sat in judgment while from behind the
curtains of the women's quarters, Ateja listened.</p>

<p>"At dawn, then, he shall be shot!" This was the sentence that
Ateja heard passed upon her lover.</p>

<p>Behind his greasy <a title=
"a kind of kerchief"><i>thorrib</i></a> Fahd smiled a crooked
smile. In his black house of hair Zeyd struggled with the bonds
that held him, for though he had not heard the sentence he was
aware of what his fate would be. In the quarters of the harem of
the Sheikh Ibn Jad the sheikh's daughter lay sleepless and
suffering. Her long lashes were wet with tears but her grief was
silent. Wide eyed she waited, listening, and presently her patience
was rewarded by the sounds of the deep, regular breathing of Ibn
Jad and his wife, Hirfa. They slept.</p>

<p>Ateja stirred. Stealthily she raised the lower edge of the tent
cloth beside which lay her sleeping mat and rolled quietly beneath
it into the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>,
now deserted. Groping, she found the matchlock of Zeyd where Ibn
Jad had left it. She carried also a bundle wrapped in an old
<a title="a kind of kerchief"><i>thorrib</i></a>, the contents of
which she had gathered earlier in the evening when Hirfa, occupied
with her duties, had been temporarily absent from the women's
quarters.</p>

<p>Ateja emerged from the tent of her father and crept cautiously
along the single, irregular street formed by the pitched tents of
the Arabs until she came to the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of
Zeyd. For a moment she paused at the opening, listening, then she
entered softly on sandaled feet.</p>

<p>But Zeyd, sleepless, struggling with his bonds, heard her. "Who
comes?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" cautioned the girl. "It is I, Ateja." She crept to his
side.</p>

<p>"Beloved!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Deftly the girl cut the bonds that held his wrists and ankles.
"I have brought thee food and thy musket," she told him. "These and
freedom I give thee&mdash;the rest thou must do thyself. Thy mare
stands tethered with the others. Far is <a title=
"village">Beled</a> el-Guad, beset with dangers is the way, but
night and day will Ateja pray to Allah to guide thee safely. Haste,
my loved one!"</p>

<p>Zeyd pressed her tightly to his breast, kissed her and was gone
into the night.</p>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; SIR RICHARD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE floor of the tunnel along which Paul Bodkin
conducted Blake inclined ever upwards, and again and again it was
broken by flights of steps which carried them always to higher
levels. To Blake the way seemed interminable. Even the haunting
mystery of the long tunnel failed to overcome the monotony of its
unchanging walls that slipped silently into the torch's dim ken for
a brief instant and as silently back into the Cimmerian oblivion
behind to make place for more wall unvaryingly identical.</p>

<p>But, as there ever is to all things, there was an end to the
tunnel. Blake first glimpsed it in a little patch of distant
daylight ahead, and presently he stepped out into the sunlight and
looked out across a wide valley that was tree-dotted and beautiful.
He found himself standing upon a wide ledge, or shelf, some hundred
feet above the base of the mountain through which the tunnel had
been cut. There was a sheer drop before him, and to his right the
ledge terminated abruptly at a distance of a hundred feet or less.
Then he glanced to the left and his eyes went wide in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Across the shelf stood a solid wall of masonry flanked at either
side by great, round towers pierced by long, narrow embrasures. In
the center of the wall was a lofty gateway which was closed by a
massive and handsomely wrought portcullis behind which Blake saw
two Negroes standing guard. They were clothed precisely as his
captors, but held great battle-axes, the butts of which rested upon
the ground.</p>

<p>"What ho, the gate!" shouted Paul Bodkin. "Open to the outer
guard and a prisoner!"</p>

<p>Slowly the portcullis rose and Blake and his captor passed
beneath. Directly inside the gateway and at the left, built into
the hillside, was what was evidently a guardhouse. Before it
loitered a score or so of soldiers, uniformed like Paul Bodkin,
upon the breast of each the red cross. To a heavy wooden rail gaily
caparisoned horses were tethered, their handsome trappings
recalling to Blake's memory paintings he had seen of mounted
knights of medieval England.</p>

<p>There was so much of unreality in the strangely garbed blacks,
the massive barbican that guarded the way, the trappings of the
horses, that Blake was no longer capable of surprise when one of
the two doors in the guardhouse opened and there stepped out a
handsome young man clad in a hauberk of chain mail over which was a
light surcoat of rough stuff, dyed purple. Upon the youth's head
fitted a leopard skin bassinet from the lower edge of which
depended a camail or gorget of chain mail that entirely surrounded
and protected his throat and neck. He was armed only with a heavy
sword and a dagger, but against the side of the guardhouse, near
the doorway where he paused to look at Blake, leaned a long lance,
and near it was a shield with a red cross emblazoned upon its
boss.</p>

<p>"'Od's wounds!" exclaimed the young man. "What hast thou there,
varlet?"</p>

<p>"A prisoner, an it please thee, noble lord," replied Paul
Bodkin, deferentially.</p>

<p>"A Saracen, of a surety," stated the young man.</p>

<p>"Nay, an I may make so bold, Sir Richard," replied
Paul&mdash;"but methinks he is no Saracen."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"With mine own eyes I did see him make the sign before the
Cross."</p>

<p>"Fetch him hither, lout!"</p>

<p>Bodkin prodded Blake in the rear with his pike, but the American
scarce noticed the offense so occupied was his mind by the light of
truth that had so suddenly illuminated it. In the instant he had
grasped the solution. He laughed inwardly at himself for his
denseness. Now he understood everything&mdash;and these fellows
thought they could put it over on him, did they? Well, they had
come near to doing it, all right.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly toward the young man and halted, upon his
lips a faintly sarcastic smile. The other eyed him with haughty
arrogance.</p>

<p>"Whence comest thou," he asked, "and what doest thou in the
Valley of the Sepulcher, varlet?"</p>

<p>Blake's smile faded&mdash;too much was too much. "Cut the
comedy, young fellow," he drawled in his slow way. "Where's the
director?"</p>

<p>"Director? Forsooth, I know not what thou meanest."</p>

<p>"Yes you don't!" snapped Blake, with fine sarcasm. "But let me
tell you right off the bat that no seven-fifty a day extra can pull
anything like that with me!"</p>

<p>"'Od's blood, fellow! I ken not the meaning of all the words,
but I mislike thy tone. It savors o'er much of insult to fall
sweetly upon the ears of Richard Montmorency."</p>

<p>"Be yourself," advised Blake. "If the director isn't handy send
for the assistant director, or the camera man&mdash;even the
continuity writer may have more sense than you seem to have."</p>

<p>"Be myself? And who thinkest thou I would be other than Richard
Montmorency, a noble knight of Nimmr."</p>

<p>Blake shook his head in despair, then he turned to the soldiers
who were standing about listening to the conversation. He thought
some of them would be grinning at the joke that was being played on
him, but he saw only solemn, serious faces.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, addressing Paul Bodkin, "don't any of you
know where the director is?"</p>

<p>"'Director'?" repeated Bodkin, shaking his head. "There is none
in Nimmr thus yclept, nay, nor in all the Valley of the Sepulcher
that I wot."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Blake, "the mistake is mine; but if there is
no director there must be a keeper. May I see him?"</p>

<p>"Ah, keeper!" cried Bodkin, his face lighting with
understanding. "Sir Richard is the keeper."</p>

<p>"My gawd!" exclaimed Blake, turning to the young man. "I beg
your pardon, I thought that you were one of the inmates."</p>

<p>"Inmates? Indeed thou speakest a strange tongue and yet withal
it hath the flavor of England," replied the young man gravely. "But
yon varlet is right&mdash;I am indeed this day the Keeper of the
Gate."</p>

<p>Blake was commencing to doubt his own sanity, or at least his
judgment. Neither the young white man nor any of the Negroes had
any of their facial characteristics of mad men. He looked up
suddenly at the keeper of the gate.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, flashing one of the frank smiles that was
famous amongst his acquaintances. "I have acted like a boor, but
I've been under considerable nervous strain for a long time,
and on top of that I've been lost in the jungle for days without
proper or sufficient food.</p>

<p>"I thought that you were trying to play some sort of a joke on
me and, well, I wasn't in any mood for jokes when I expected
friendship and hospitality instead.</p>

<p>"Tell me, where am I? What country is this?"</p>

<p>"Thou art close upon the city of Nimmr," replied the young
man.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is something of a national holiday or
something?" suggested Blake.</p>

<p>"I do not understand thee," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"Why, you're all in a pageant or something, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"'Od's bodikins! the fellow speaks an outlandish tongue!
Pageant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, those costumes."</p>

<p>"What is amiss with this apparel? True, 'tis not of any wondrous
newness, but methinks it is at least more fair than thine. At least
it well sufficeth the daily service of a knight."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you dress like this every day?" demanded
Blake.</p>

<p>"And why not? But enough of this. I have no wish to further
bandy words with thee. Fetch him within, two of thee. And thou,
Bodkin, return to the outer guard!" The young man turned and
re-entered the building, while two of the soldiers seized Blake,
none too gently, and hustled him within.</p>

<p>He found himself in a high-ceiled room with walls of cut stone
and great, hand-hewn beams and rafters blackened with age. Upon the
stone floor stood a table behind which, upon a bench, the young man
seated himself while Blake was placed facing him with a guard on
either hand.</p>

<p>"Thy name," demanded the young man.</p>

<p>"Blake."</p>

<p>"That be all&mdash;just Blake?"</p>

<p>"James Hunter Blake."</p>

<p>"What title bearest thou in thine own country?"</p>

<p>"I have no title."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou art not a gentleman, then?"</p>

<p>"I am called one."</p>

<p>"What is thy country?"</p>

<p>"America."</p>

<p>"America! There is no such country, fellow."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of it. What doest thou near the Valley of the
Sepulcher? Didst not know 'tis forbidden?"</p>

<p>"I told you I was lost. I didn't know where I was. All I want is
to get back to my safari or to the coast."</p>

<p>"That is impossible. We are surrounded by Saracens. For seven
hundred and thirty-five years we have been invested by their
armies. How camest thou through the enemies' lines? How passed'st
thou through his vast army?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any army."</p>

<p>"Givest thou the lie to Richard Montmorency, varlet? An thou
wert of gentle blood thou shouldst account to me that insult upon
the field of honor. Methinks thou art some lowborn spy sent hither
by the Saracen sultan. 'Twould be well an thou confessed'st all to
me, for if I take thee before the Prince he will wrest the truth
from thee in ways that are far from pleasant. What say?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to confess. Take me before the Prince, or
whoever your boss is; perhaps he will at least give me food."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have food here. Never shall it be said that Richard
Montmorency turned a hungry man from his doorway. Hey! Michel!
Michel! Where is the lazy brat? Michel!"</p>

<p>A door opened from an inner apartment to admit a boy, sleepy
eyed, digging a grimy fist into one eye. He was clothed in a short
tunic, his legs encased in green tights. In his cap was a
feather.</p>

<p>"Sleeping again, eh?" demanded Sir Richard. "Thou lazy knave!
Fetch bread and meat for this poor wayfarer and be not until the
morrow at it!"</p>

<p>Wide-eyed and rather stupidly, the boy stared at Blake. "A
Saracen, master?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What booteth it?" snapped Sir Richard. "Did not our Lord Jesus
feed the multitude, nor ask if there were unbelievers among them?
Haste, churl! The stranger is of great hunger."</p>

<p>The youth turned and shuffled from the room, wiping his nose
upon his sleeve, and Sir Richard's attention came back to
Blake.</p>

<p>"Thou art not ill-favored, fellow," he said. "'Tis a pity that
thou art not of noble blood, for thy mien appeareth not like that
of one lowborn."</p>

<p>"I never considered myself lowborn," said Blake, with a
grin.</p>

<p>"Thy father, now&mdash;was he not at least a sir knight?"</p>

<p>Blake was thinking quickly now. He was far from being able as
yet to so much as hazard a guess that might explain his host's
archaic costume and language, but he was sure that the man was in
earnest, whether sane or not, and were he not sane it seemed doubly
wise to humor him.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," he replied, "my father is a thirty-second degree
Mason and a Knight Templar."</p>

<p>"'Sblood! I knew it," cried Sir Richard.</p>

<p>"And so am I," added Blake, when he realized the happy effect
his statement had produced.</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew it! I knew it!" cried Sir Richard. "Thy bearing
proclaimed thy noble blood; but why didst thou seek to deceive me?
An so thou art one of the poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple
of Solomon who guard the way of the pilgrims to the Holy Land! This
explaineth thy poor raiment and glorifieth it."</p>

<p>Blake was mystified by the allusion, as the picture always
suggested by a reference to Knights Templar was of waving white
plumes, gorgeous aprons and glittering swords. He did not know that
in the days of their origin they were clothed in any old garments
that the charity of others might bequeath them.</p>

<p>At this moment Michel returned bearing a wooden trencher
containing cold mutton and several pieces of simnel bread and
carrying in one hand a flagon of wine. These he set upon the table
before Blake and going to a cupboard fetched two metal goblets into
which he decanted a portion of the contents of the flagon.</p>

<p>Sir Richard arose and taking one of the goblets raised it before
him on a level with his head.</p>

<p>"Hail, Sir James!" he cried, "and welcome to Nimmr and the
Valley of the Sepulcher!"</p>

<p>"Here's looking at you!" replied Blake.</p>

<p>"A quaint saying," remarked Sir Richard. "Methinks the ways of
England must be changed since the days of Richard the Lion-Hearted
when my noble ancestor set forth upon the great crusade in the
company of his king. Here's looking at you! 'Ods bodikins! I must
not let that from my memory. Here's looking at you! Just wait thou
'til some fair knight doth drink my health&mdash;I shall lay him
flat with that!</p>

<p>"But, stay! Here, Michel, fetch yon stool for Sir James, and
eat, sir knight. Thou must be passing hungry."</p>

<p>"I'll tell the world I am," replied Blake, feelingly, as he sat
down on the stool that Michel brought. There were no knives or
forks, but there were fingers and these Blake used to advantage
while his host sat smiling happily at him from across the rude
table.</p>

<p>"Thou art better than a minstrel for pleasure," cried Sir
Richard. "I'll tell the world I am! Ho, ho! Thou wilt be a gift
from heaven in the castle of the prince. I'll tell the world I
am!"</p>

<p>When Blake had satisfied his hunger, Sir Richard ordered Michel
to prepare horses. "We ride down to the castle, Sir James," he
explained. "No longer art thou my prisoner, but my friend and
guest. That I should have received thee so scurvily shall ever be
to my discredit."</p>

<p>Mounted upon prancing chargers and followed at a respectful
distance by Michel, the two rode down the winding mountain road.
Sir Richard now carried his shield and lance, a pennon fluttering
bravely in the wind from just below the tip of the latter, the sun
glancing from the metal of his hauberk, a smile upon his brave face
as he chattered with his erstwhile prisoner. To Blake he seemed a
gorgeous picture ridden from out of the pages of a story book. Yet,
belying his martial appearance, there was a childlike simplicity
about the man that won Blake's liking from the first, for there was
that about him that made it impossible for one to conceive him as
the perpetrator of a dishonorable act.</p>

<p>His ready acceptance of Blake's statements about himself bespoke
a credulity that seemed incompatible with the high intelligence
reflected by his noble countenance, and the American preferred to
attribute it to a combination of un-sophistication and an innate
integrity which could not conceive of perfidy in others.</p>

<p>As the road rounded the shoulder of a hill, Blake saw another
barbican barring the way and, beyond, the towers and battlements of
an ancient castle. At a command from Sir Richard the warders of the
gate opened to them and the three rode through into the ballium.
This space between the outer and inner walls appeared unkept and
neglected. Several old trees flourished within it and beneath the
shade of one of these, close to the outer gateway, lolled several
men-at-arms, two of whom were engaged in a game that resembled
draughts.</p>

<p>At the foot of the inner wall was a wide moat, the waters of
which reflected the gray stones of the wall and the ancient vines
that, growing upon its inner side, topped it to form a leaf coping
that occasionally hung low upon the outer side.</p>

<p>Directly opposite the barbican was the great gateway in the
inner wall and here a drawbridge spanned the moat and a heavy
portcullis barred the way into the great court of the castle; but
at a word from Sir Richard the gate lifted and, clattering across
the drawbridge, they rode within.</p>

<p>Before Blake's astonished eyes loomed a mighty castle of rough
hewn stone, while to the right and left, within the great court,
spread broad gardens not illy kept, in which were gathered a
company of men and women who might have just stepped from Arthur's
court.</p>

<p>At sight of Sir Richard and his companion the nearer members of
the company regarded Blake with interest and evident surprise.
Several called greetings and questions to Sir Richard as the two
men dismounted and turned their horses over to Michel.</p>

<p>"Ho, Richard!" cried one. "What bringest thou&mdash;a
Saracen?"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Richard. "A fair sir knight who would do his
devoir to the prince. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Yonder," and they pointed toward the far end of the court where
a large company was assembled.</p>

<p>"Come, Sir James!" directed Richard, and led him down the
courtyard, the knights and ladies following closely, asking
questions, commenting with a frankness that brought a flush to
Blake's face. The women openly praised his features and his image
while the men, perhaps prompted by jealousy, made unflattering
remarks about his soiled and torn apparel and its, to them,
ridiculous cut; and indeed the contrast was great between their
gorgeous dalmaticas of villosa or cyclas, their close fitting
tights, their colored caps and Blake's drab shirt, whipcord
breeches and cordovan boots, now soiled, torn and scratched.</p>

<p>The women were quite as richly dressed as the men, wearing
clinging mantles of rich stuff, their hair and shoulders covered
with dainty wimples of various colors and often elaborately
embroidered.</p>

<p>None of these men, nor any of those in the assemblage they were
approaching wore armor, but Blake had seen an armored knight at the
outer gateway and another at the inner and he judged that only when
engaged in military duties did they wear this heavy and
uncomfortable dress.</p>

<p>When they reached the party at the end of the court Sir Richard
elbowed his way among them to the center of the group where stood a
tall man of imposing appearance, chatting with those about him. As
Sir Richard and Blake halted before him the company fell
silent.</p>

<p>"My lord prince," said Richard, bowing, "I bring thee Sir James,
a worthy Knight Templar who hath come under the protection of God
through the lines of the enemy to the gates of Nimmr."</p>

<p>The tall man eyed Blake searchingly and he had not the
appearance of great credulity.</p>

<p>"Thou sayest that thou comest from the Temple of Solomon in the
Kingdom of Jerusalem?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard must have misunderstood me," replied Blake.</p>

<p>"Then thou art no Knight Templar?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am not from Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Perchance he is one of those doughty sir knights that guard the
pilgrims' way to the Holy Land," suggested a young woman standing
near the prince.</p>

<p>Blake glanced quickly at the speaker and as their eyes met, hers
fell, but not before he had seen that they were very beautiful eyes
set in an equally beautiful, oval face.</p>

<p>"More like it haps he is a Saracen spy sent among us by the
sultan," snapped a dark man who stood beside the girl.</p>

<p>The latter raised her eyes to the prince. "He looketh not like a
Saracen, my father," she said.</p>

<p>"What knowest thou of the appearance of a Saracen, child?"
demanded the prince. "Hast seen so many?" The party laughed and the
girl pouted.</p>

<p>"Verily, and I have seen full as many a Saracen as has Sir Malud
or thyself, my lord prince," she snapped, haughtily. "Let Sir Malud
describe a Saracen."</p>

<p>The dark young man flushed angrily. "At least," he said, "my
lord prince, I know an English knight when I see one, and if here
be an English knight then Sir Malud is a Saracen!"</p>

<p>"Enough," said the prince and then, turning to Blake: "If thou
beest not from Jerusalem where art thou from?"</p>

<p>"New York," replied the American.</p>

<p>"Ha," whispered Sir Malud to the girl, "did I not tell you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what&mdash;that he is from New York? Where is that?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>"Some stronghold of the infidel," asserted Malud.</p>

<p>"New York?" repeated the prince. "Is that in the Holy Land?"</p>

<p>"It is sometimes called New Jerusalem," explained Blake.</p>

<p>"And thou comest to Nimmr through the lines of the enemy? Tell
me, sir knight, had they many men-at-arms? And how were their
forces disposed? Are they close upon the Valley of the Sepulcher?
Thinkest thou they plan an early attack? Come, tell me
all&mdash;thou canst be of great service."</p>

<p>"I have come for days through the forest and seen no living
man," said Blake. "No enemy surrounds you."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the prince.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell thee?" demanded Malud. "He is an enemy spy. He
would lead us into the belief that we are safe that the forces of
the sultan may find us off our guard and take Nimmr and the
Valley."</p>

<p>"'Ods blood! Methinks thou art right, Sir Malud," cried the
prince. "No enemy indeed! Why else then have the knights of Nimmr
lain here seven and a half centuries if there be no horde of
infidels surrounding our stronghold?"</p>

<p>"Search me," said Blake.</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" demanded the prince.</p>

<p>"He hath a quaint manner of speech, my lord prince," explained
Richard, "but I do not think him an enemy of England. I myself will
vouch for him an thou wilt take him into thy service, my lord
prince."</p>

<p>"Wouldst enter my service, sir?" demanded the prince.</p>

<p>Blake glanced at Sir Malud and looked dubious&mdash;then his
eyes wandered to those of the girl. "I'll tell the world I would!"
he said.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; THE RETURN OF ULALA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NUMA was hungry. For three days and three nights
he had hunted but always the prey had eluded him. Perhaps Numa was
growing old. Not so keen were his scent and his vision, not so
swift his charges, nor well timed the spring that heretofore had
brought down the quarry. So quick the food of Numa that a fraction
of a second, a hair's breadth, might mark the difference between a
full belly and starvation.</p>

<p>Perhaps Numa was growing old, yet he still was a mighty engine
of destruction, and now the pangs of hunger had increased his
ferocity many-fold, stimulated his cunning, emboldened him to take
great risks that his belly might be filled. It was a nervous,
irascible, ferocious Numa that crouched beside the trail. His
up-pricked ears, his intent and blazing eyes, his quivering
nostrils, the gently moving tail-tip, evidenced his awareness of
another presence.</p>

<p>Down the wind to the nostrils of Numa the lion came the
man-scent. Four days ago, his belly full, Numa had doubtless slunk
away at the first indication of the presence of man, but today is
another day and another Numa.</p>

<p>Zeyd, three days upon the back track from the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
the sheikh Ibn Jad, thought of Ateja, of far Guad, congratulated
himself upon the good fortune that had thus far smiled upon his
escape and flight. His mare moved slowly along the jungle trail,
unurged, for the way was long; and just ahead a beast of prey
waited in ambush.</p>

<p>But Numa's were not the only ears to hear, nor his nostrils the
only nostrils to scent the coming of the man-thing&mdash;another
beast crouched near, unknown to Numa.</p>

<p>Over-anxious, fearful of being cheated of his meat, Numa made a
false move. Down the trail came the mare. She must pass within a
yard of Numa, but Numa could not wait. Before she was within the
radius of his spring he charged, voicing a horrid roar. Terrified
the mare reared and, rearing, tried to turn and bolt. Overbalanced,
she toppled backward and fell, and in falling unhorsed Zeyd; but in
the instant she was up and flying back along the trail, leaving her
master in the path of the charging lion.</p>

<p>Horrified, the man saw the snarling face, the bared fangs almost
upon him. Then he saw something else&mdash;something equally
awe-inspiring&mdash;a naked giant who leaped from a swaying branch
full upon the back of the great cat. He saw a bronzed arm encircle
the neck of the beast of prey as the lion was borne to earth by the
weight and impact of the man's body. He saw a heavy knife flashing
in the air, striking home again and again as the frenzied lion
threw itself about in futile effort to dislodge the thing upon its
back. He heard the roars and the growls of <a title=
"lion"><i>el-adrea</i></a>, and mingled with them were growls and
snarls that turned his blood cold, for he saw that they came from
the lips of the man-beast.</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">A naked giant leaped upon the back of the great
cat.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then Numa went limp and the giant arose and stood above the
carcass. He placed one foot upon it and, raising his face toward
the heavens, voiced a hideous scream that froze the marrow in the
bones of the Beduin&mdash;a scream that few men have heard: the
victory cry of the bull ape.</p>

<p>It was then that Zeyd recognized his savior and shuddered again
as he saw that it was Tarzan of the Apes. The ape-man looked down
at him.</p>

<p>"Thou art from the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad," he said.</p>

<p>"I am but a poor man," replied Zeyd. "I but followed where my
sheikh led. Hold it not against Zeyd sheikh of the jungle, that he
is in thy <a title="village"><i>beled</i></a>. Spare my poor life I
pray thee and may Allah bless thee."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to harm thee, <a title=
"Beduin"><i>Beduwy</i></a>," replied Tarzan. "What wrong hath been
done in my country is the fault of Ibn Jad alone. Is he close
by?"</p>

<p>"<i><a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a></i> nay, he
is many marches from here."</p>

<p>"Where are thy companions?" demanded the ape-man.</p>

<p>"I have none."</p>

<p>"Thou art alone?"</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, yes."</p>

<p>Tarzan frowned. "Think well <a title="Beduin"><i>Beduwy</i></a>
before lying to Tarzan," he snapped.</p>

<p>"By Allah, I speak the truth! I am alone."</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Fahd did plot against me to make it appear that I had tried to
take the life of Ibn Jad, which, before Allah, is a lie that
stinketh to heaven, and I was to be shot; but Ateja, the daughter
of the sheikh, cut my bonds in the night and I escaped."</p>

<p>"What is thy name?"</p>

<p>"Zeyd."</p>

<p>"Whither goest thou&mdash;to thine own country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to Beled el-Guad, a Beny Salem <a title=
"tribe, tribal territory"><i>fendy</i></a> of el-Harb."</p>

<p>"Thou canst not, alone, survive the perils of the way," Tarzan
warned him.</p>

<p>"Of that I be fearful, but death were certain had I not escaped
the wrath of Ibn Jad."</p>

<p>For a moment Tarzan was silent in thought. "Great must be the
love of Ateja, the daughter of the sheikh, and great her belief in
you," he said.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, yes, great is
our love and, too, she knew that I would not slay her father, whom
she loves."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded. "I believe thee and shall help thee. Thou canst
not go on alone. I shall take thee to the nearest village and there
the chief will furnish you with warriors who will take you to the
next village, and thus from village to village you will be escorted
to the Sudan."</p>

<p>"May Allah ever watch over and guard thee!" exclaimed Zeyd.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Tarzan as the two moved along the jungle trail
in the direction of the nearest village which lay two marches to
the south of them, "tell me what Ibn Jad doth in this country. It
is not true that he came for ivory alone. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a> yes, Sheikh
Tarzan," admitted Zeyd. "Ibn Jad came for treasure, but not for
ivory."</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"In el-Habash lies the treasure city of Nimmr," explained Zeyd.
"This Ibn Jad was told by a learned <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a>. So great is the wealth
of Nimmr that a thousand camels could carry away not a tenth part
of it. It consists of gold and jewels and&mdash;a woman."</p>

<p>"A woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a woman of such wondrous beauty that in the north she
alone would bring a price that would make Ibn Jad rich beyond
dreams. Surely thou must have heard of Nimmr."</p>

<p>"Sometimes the Gallas speak of it," said Tarzan, "but always I
thought it of no more reality than the other places of their
legends. And Ibn Jad undertook this long and dangerous journey on
no more than the word of a magician?"</p>

<p>"What could be better than the word of a learned <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a>?" demanded Zeyd.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes shrugged.</p>

<p>During the two days that it took them to reach the village
Tarzan learned of the white man who had come to the camp of Ibn
Jad, but from Zeyd's description of him he was not positive whether
it was Blake or Stimbol.</p>

<p><br>AS Tarzan traveled south with Zeyd, Ibn Jad trekked northward
into el-Habash, and Fahd plotted with Tollog, and Stimbol plotted
with Fahd, while Fejjuan the Galla slave waited patiently for the
moment of his delivery from bondage, and Ateja mourned for
Zeyd.</p>

<p>"As a boy thou wert raised in this country, Fejjuan," she said
one day to the Galla slave. "Tell me, dost thou think Zeyd could
make his way alone to el-Guad?"</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, nay," replied the black.
"Doubtless he is dead by now."</p>

<p>The girl stifled a sob.</p>

<p>"Fejjuan mourns with thee, Ateja," said the black, "for Zeyd was
a kindly man. Would that Allah had spared your lover and taken him
who was guilty."</p>

<p>"What dost thou mean?" asked Ateja. "Knowest thou, Fejjuan, who
fired the shot at Ibn Jad, my father? It was not Zeyd! Tell me it
was not Zeyd! But thy words tell me that, which I well knew before.
Zeyd could not have sought the life of my father!"</p>

<p>"Nor did he," replied Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know of this thing."</p>

<p>"And you will not tell another who told you?" he asked. "It
would go hard with me if one I am thinking of knew that I had seen
what I did see."</p>

<p>"I swear by Allah that I wilt not betray you, Fejjuan," cried
the girl. "Tell me, what didst thou see?"</p>

<p>"I did not see who fired the shot at thy father, Ateja," replied
the black, "but something else I saw before the shot was
fired."</p>

<p>"Yes, what was it?"</p>

<p>"I saw Fahd creep into the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of
Zeyd and come out again bearing Zeyd's matchlock. That I saw."</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"But Ibn Jad will not believe if you tell him."</p>

<p>"I know; but now that I am convinced perhaps I shall find a way
to have Fahd's blood for the blood of Zeyd," cried the girl,
bitterly.</p>

<p>For days Ibn Jad skirted the mountains behind which he thought
lay the fabled city of Nimmr as he searched for an entrance which
he hoped to find without having recourse to the natives whose
haunts he had sedulously avoided lest through them opposition to
his venture might develop.</p>

<p>The country was sparsely settled, which rendered it easy for the
Arabs to avoid coming into close contact with the natives, though
it was impossible that the Gallas were ignorant of their presence.
If however the blacks were willing to leave them alone, Ibn Jad had
no intention of molesting them unless he found that it would be
impossible to carry his project to a successful issue without their
assistance, in which event he was equally ready to approach them
with false promises or ruthless cruelty, whichever seemed the more
likely to better serve his purpose.</p>

<p>As the days passed Ibn Jad waxed increasingly impatient, for,
search as he would, he could locate no pass across the mountains,
nor any entrance to the fabled valley wherein lay the treasure city
of Nimmr.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a>" he exclaimed one day,
"there be a City of Nimmr and there be an entrance to it, and, by
Allah, I will find it! Summon the Habush, Tollog! From them or
through them we shall have a clue in one way or another."</p>

<p>When Tollog had fetched the Galla slaves to the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Ibn Jad, the old sheikh questioned them
but there was none who had definite knowledge of the trail leading
to Nimmr.</p>

<p>"Then, by Allah," exclaimed Ibn Jad, "we shall have it from the
native Habush!"</p>

<p>"They are mighty warriors, O brother," cried Tollog, "and we are
far within their country. Should we anger them and they set upon us
it might fare ill with us."</p>

<p>"We are Bedauwy," said Ibn Jad proudly, "and we are armed with
muskets. What could their simple spears and arrows avail against
us?"</p>

<p>"But they are many and we are few," insisted Tollog.</p>

<p>"We shall not fight unless we are driven to it," said Ibn Jad.
"First we shall seek, by friendly overtures, to win their
confidence and cajole the secret from them.</p>

<p>"Fejjuan!" he exclaimed, turning to the great black. "Thou art a
Habashy. I have heard thee say that thou well rememberest the days
of thy childhood in the hut of thy father and the story of Nimmr
was no new story to you. Go, then, and seek out thy people. Make
friends with them. Tell them that the great Sheikh Ibn Jad comes
among them in friendliness and that he hath gifts for their chiefs.
Tell them also that he would visit the city of Nimmr, and if they
will lead him there he will reward them well."</p>

<p>"I but await thy commands," said Fejjuan, elated at this
opportunity to do what he had long dreamed of doing. "When shall I
set forth?"</p>

<p>"Prepare thyself tonight and when dawn comes depart," replied
the sheikh.</p>

<p>And so it was that Fejjuan, the Galla slave, set forth early the
following morning from the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad, sheikh of the <a title=
"tribe, tribal territory"><i>fendy</i></a> el-Guad, to search for a
village of his own people.</p>

<p>By noon he had come upon a well-worn trail leading toward the
west, and this he followed boldly, guessing that he would best
disarm suspicion thus than by attempting to approach a Galla
village by stealth. Also he well knew that there was little
likelihood that he could accomplish the latter. In any event
Fejjuan was no fool. He knew that it might be difficult to convince
the Gallas that he was of their blood, for there was against him
not alone his Arab garments and weapons but the fact that he would
be able to speak the Galla tongue but lamely after all these
years.</p>

<p>That he was a brave man was evidenced by the fact that he well
knew the suspicious and warlike qualities of his people and their
inborn hatred of the Arabs and yet gladly embraced this opportunity
to go amongst them.</p>

<p>How close he had approached a village Fejjuan did not know.
There were neither sounds nor odors to enlighten him when there
suddenly appeared in the trail ahead of him three husky Galla
warriors and behind him he heard others, though he did not
turn.</p>

<p>Instantly Fejjuan raised his hands in sign of peace and at the
same time he smiled.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in the Galla country?" demanded one of the
warriors.</p>

<p>"I am seeking the house of my father," replied Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"The house of your father is not in the country of the Gallas,"
growled the warrior. "You are one of these who come to rob us of
our sons and daughters."</p>

<p>"No," replied Fejjuan. "I am a Galla."</p>

<p>"If you were a Galla you would speak the language of the Gallas
better. We understand you, but you do not speak as a Galla
speaks."</p>

<p>"That is because I was stolen away when I was a child and have
lived among the Bedauwy since, speaking only their tongue."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"The Bedauwy call me Fejjuan, but my Galla name was Ulala."</p>

<p>"Do you think he speaks the truth?" demanded one of the blacks
of a companion. "When I was a child I had a brother whose name was
Ulala."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the other warrior.</p>

<p>"We do not know. Perhaps Simba the lion devoured him. Perhaps
the desert people took him. Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he speaks the truth," said the second warrior. "Perhaps
he is your brother. Ask him his father's name."</p>

<p>"What was your father's name?" demanded the first warrior.</p>

<p>"Naliny," replied Fejjuan.</p>

<p>At this reply the Galla warriors became excited and whispered
among themselves for several seconds. Then the first warrior turned
again to Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"Did you have a brother?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"What was his name?"</p>

<p>"Tabo," answered Fejjuan without hesitation.</p>

<p>The warrior who had questioned him leaped into the air with a
wild shout.</p>

<p>"It is Ulala!" he cried. "It is my brother. I am Tabo, Ulala. Do
you not remember me?"</p>

<p>"Tabo!" cried Fejjuan. "No, I would not know you, for you were a
little boy when I was stolen away and now you are a great warrior.
Where are our father and mother? Are they alive? Are they
well?"</p>

<p>"They are alive and well, Ulala," replied Tabo. "Today they are
in the village of the chief, for there is a great council because
of the presence of some desert people in our country. Came you with
them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a slave to the desert people," replied Fejjuan. "Is
it far to the village of the chief? I would see my mother and my
father and, too, I would talk with the chief about the desert
people who have come to the country of the Gallas."</p>

<p>"Come, brother!" cried Tabo. "We are not far from the village of
the chief. Ah, my brother, that I should see you again whom we
thought to be dead all these years! Great will be the joy of our
father and mother.</p>

<p>"But, tell me, have the desert people turned you against your
own people? You have lived with them many years. Perhaps you have
taken a wife among them. Are you sure that you do not love them
better than you love those whom you have not seen for many
years?"</p>

<p>"I do not love the Bedauwy," replied Fejjuan, "nor have I taken
a wife among them. Always in my heart has been the hope of
returning to the mountains of my own country, to the house of my
father. I love my own people, Tabo. Never again shall I leave
them."</p>

<p>"The desert people have been unkind to you&mdash;they have
treated you with cruelty?" demanded Tabo.</p>

<p>"Nay, on the contrary they have treated me well," replied
Fejjuan. "I do not hate them, but neither do I love them. They are
not of my own blood. I am a slave among them."</p>

<p>As they talked the party moved along the trail toward the
village while two of the warriors ran ahead to carry the glad
tidings to the father and mother of the long missing Ulala. And so
it was that when they came within sight of the village they were
met by a great crowd of laughing, shouting Gallas, and in the
fore-rank were the father and mother of Fejjuan, their eyes blinded
by the tears of love and joy that welled at sight of this long gone
child.</p>

<p>After the greetings were over, and every man, woman and child in
the company must crowd close and touch the returned wanderer, Tabo
conducted Fejjuan into the village and the presence of the
chief.</p>

<p>Batando was an old man. He had been chief when Ulala was stolen
away. He was inclined to be skeptical, fearing a ruse of the desert
people, and he asked many questions of Fejjuan concerning matters
that he might hold in his memory from the days of his childhood. He
asked him about the house of his father and the names of his
playmates and other intimate things that an impostor might not
know, and when he had done he arose and took Fejjuan in his arms
and rubbed his cheek against the cheek of the prodigal.</p>

<p>"You are indeed Ulala," he cried. "Welcome back to the land of
your people. Tell me now what the desert people do here. Have they
come for slaves?"</p>

<p>"The desert people will always take slaves when they can get
them, but Ibn Jad has not come first for slaves, but for
treasure."</p>

<p>"Ai! what treasure?" demanded Batando.</p>

<p>"He has heard of the treasure city of Nimmr," replied Fejjuan.
"It is a way into the valley where lies Nimmr that he seeks. For
this he sent me to find Gallas who would lead him to Nimmr. He will
make gifts and he promises rich rewards when he shall have wrested
the treasure from Nimmr."</p>

<p>"Are these true words?" asked Batando.</p>

<p>"There is no truth in the beards of the desert dwellers,"
replied Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"And if he does not find the treasure of Nimmr perhaps he will
try to find treasure and slaves in the Galla country to repay the
expense of the long journey he has undertaken from the desert
country?" asked Batando.</p>

<p>"Batando speaks out of the great wisdom of many years," replied
Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"What does he know of Nimmr?" asked the old chief.</p>

<p>"Naught other than what an old medicine man of the Arabs told
him," replied Fejjuan. "He said to Ibn Jad that great treasure lay
hoarded in the City of Nimmr and that there was a beautiful woman
who would bring a great price in the far north."</p>

<p>"Nothing more he told him?" demanded Batando. "Did he not tell
him of the difficulties of entering the forbidden valley?"</p>

<p>"Nay."</p>

<p>"Then we can guide him to the entrance to the valley," said
Batando, smiling slyly.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; SIR JAMES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Tarzan and Zeyd journeyed toward the village in
which the ape-man purposed to enlist an escort for the Arab upon
the first stage of his return journey toward his desert home, the
Beduin had time to meditate much upon many matters, and having come
to trust and respect his savage guide he at last unbosomed himself
to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Great Sheikh of the Jungle," he said one day, "by thy kindness
thou hast won the undying loyalty of Zeyd who begs that thou wilt
grant him one more favor."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Ateja, whom I love, remains here in the savage country in
constant danger so long as Fahd be near her. I dare not now return
to the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad even could I find it, but later, when the heat of Ibn Jad's
anger will have had time to cool, then I might come again among
them and convince him of my innocence, and be near Ateja and
protect her from Fahd."</p>

<p>"What, then, would you do?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I would remain in the village to which you are taking me until
Ibn Jad returns this way toward el-Guad. It is the only chance that
I have to see Ateja again in this life, as I could not cross the
Sudan alone and on foot should you compel me to leave your country
now."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the ape-man. "You shall remain here six
months. If Ibn Jad has not returned in that time I shall leave word
that you be sent to my home. From there I can find a way to return
you in safety to your own country."</p>

<p>"May the blessings of Allah be upon thee!" cried Zeyd.</p>

<p>And when they came at last to the village Tarzan received the
promise of the chief to keep Zeyd until Ibn Jad returned.</p>

<p>After he had left the village again the ape-man headed north,
for he was concerned over the report that Zeyd had given him of the
presence of a European prisoner among the Arabs. That Stimbol, whom
he had sent eastward toward the coast, should be so far north and
west as Zeyd had reported appeared inconceivable, and so it seemed
more probable that the prisoner was young Blake, for whom Tarzan
had conceived a liking. Of course the prisoner might not be either
Stimbol or Blake, but who ever he was Tarzan could not readily
brook the idea of a white man being permitted to remain a prisoner
of the Beduins.</p>

<p>But Tarzan was in no hurry, for Zeyd had told him that the
prisoner was to be held for ransom. He would have a look about for
Blake's camp first and then follow up the spoor of the Arabs. His
progress, therefore, was leisurely. On the second day he met the
apes of Toyat and for two days he hunted with them, renewing his
acquaintance with Gayat and Zutho, listening to the gossip of the
tribe, often playing with the balus.</p>

<p>Leaving them, he loafed on through the jungle, stopping once for
half a day to bait Numa where he lay upon a fresh kill, until the
earth trembled to the thunderous roars of the maddened king of
beasts as the ape-man taunted and annoyed him.</p>

<p>Sloughed was the thin veneer of civilization that was Lord
Greystoke; back to the primitive, back to the savage beast the
ape-man reverted as naturally, as simply, as one changes from one
suit to another. It was only in his beloved jungle, surrounded by
its savage denizens, that Tarzan of the Apes was truly Tarzan, for
always in the presence of civilized men there was a certain
restraint that was the outcome of that inherent suspicion that
creatures of the wild ever feel for man.</p>

<p>Tired of throwing ripe fruit at Numa, Tarzan swung away through
the middle terraces of the forest, lay up for the night far away
and in the morning, scenting Bara the deer, made a kill and fed.
Lazy, he slept again, until the breaking of twigs and the rustle of
down tramped grasses awoke him.</p>

<p>He sniffed the air with sensitive nostrils and listened with
ears that could hear an ant walk, and then he smiled. Tantor was
coming.</p>

<p>For half a day he lolled on the huge back, listening to Manu the
Monkey chattering and scolding among the trees. Then he moved on
again.</p>

<p>A day or two later he came upon a large band of monkeys. They
seemed much excited and at sight of him they all commenced to
jabber and chatter.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Manu!" cried the ape-man. "I am Tarzan, Tarzan of
the Apes. What happens in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"Gomangani! Gomangani!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Strange Gomangani!" cried another.</p>

<p>"Gomangani with thunder sticks!" chattered a third.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"There! There!" they shouted in chorus, pointing toward the
northeast.</p>

<p>"Many sleeps away?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Close! Close!" the monkeys answered.</p>

<p>"There is one Tarmangani with them?"</p>

<p>"No, only Gomangani. With their thunder sticks they kill little
Manu and eat him. Bad Gomangani!"</p>

<p>"Tarzan will talk with them," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"They will kill Tarzan with their thunder sticks and eat him,"
prophesied a graybeard.</p>

<p>The ape-man laughed and swung off through the trees in the
direction Manu had indicated. He had not gone far when the scent
spoor of blacks came faintly to his nostrils and this spoor he
followed until presently he could hear their voices in the
distance.</p>

<p>Silently, warily Tarzan came through the trees, noiseless as the
shadows that kept him company, until he stood upon a swaying limb
directly above a camp of Negroes.</p>

<p>Instantly Tarzan recognized the safari of the young American,
Blake, and a second later he dropped to the ground before the
astonished eyes of the blacks. Some of them would have run, but
others recognized him.</p>

<p>"It is Big Bwana!" they cried. "It is Tarzan of the Apes!"</p>

<p>"Where is your head man?" demanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>A stalwart Negro approached him. "I am head man," he said.</p>

<p>"Where is your master?"</p>

<p>"He is gone, many days," replied the black.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"We do not know. He hunted with a single <a title=
"native soldier"><i>askari</i></a>. There was a great storm.
Neither of them ever returned. We searched the jungle for them, but
could not find them. We waited in camp where they were to have
joined us. They did not come. We did not know what to do. We would
not desert the young Bwana, who was kind to us; but we feared that
he was dead. We have not provisions to last more than another moon.
We decided to return home and tell our story to the friends of the
young Bwana."</p>

<p>"You have done well," said Tarzan. "Have you seen a company of
the desert people in the jungle?"</p>

<p>"We have not seen them," replied the head man, "but while we
were searching for the young Bwana we saw where desert people had
camped. It was a fresh camp."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>The black pointed. "It was on the trail to the north Galla
country in Abyssinia and when they broke camp they went north."</p>

<p>"You may return to your village," said Tarzan, "but first take
those things which are the young Bwana's to his friends to keep for
him and send a runner to the home of Tarzan with this message: Send
one hundred Waziri to Tarzan in the north Galla country. From the
water hole of the smooth, round rocks follow the trail of the
desert people."</p>

<p>"Yes, Big Bwana, it will be done," said the head man.</p>

<p>"Repeat my message."</p>

<p>The black boy did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Tarzan. "I go. Kill not Manu the monkey if you can
find other food, for Manu is the cousin of Tarzan and of you."</p>

<p>"We understand, Big Bwana."</p>

<p><br>IN the castle of Prince Gobred in the City of Nimmr James Hunter
Blake was being schooled in the duties of a Knight of Nimmr. Sir
Richard had taken him under his protection and made himself
responsible for his training and his conduct.</p>

<p>Prince Gobred, quick to realize Blake's utter ignorance of even
the simplest observances of knighthood, was frankly skeptical, and
Sir Malud was almost openly antagonistic, but the loyal Sir Richard
was a well beloved knight and so he had his way. Perhaps, too, the
influence of the Princess Guinalda was not without its effect upon
her sire, for first among the treasures of the Prince of Nimmr
ranked his daughter Guinalda; and Guinalda's curiosity and interest
had been excited by the romance of the coming of this fair stranger
knight to the buried and forgotten city of Nimmr.</p>

<p>Sir Richard had clothed Blake from his own wardrobe until a
weaver, a cutter of cloth, a seamstress and an armorer could
fashion one for him. Nor did it take long. A week found Sir James
clothed, armored and horsed as befitted a Knight of Nimmr, and when
he spoke to Sir Richard of payment for all this he found that money
was almost unknown among them. There were, Sir Richard told him, a
few pieces of coin that their ancestors had brought here seven
hundred and thirty five years before, but payment was made by
service.</p>

<p>The knights served the prince and he kept them. They protected
the laborers and the artisans and in return received what they
required from them. The slaves received their food and clothing
from the prince or from whichever knight they served. Jewels and
precious metals often changed hands in return for goods or service,
but each transaction was a matter of barter as there were no
standards of value.</p>

<p>They cared little for wealth. The knights valued most highly
their honor and their courage upon which there could be no price.
The artisan found his reward in the high perfection of his
handicraft and in the honors that it brought him.</p>

<p>The valley provided food in plenty for all; the slaves tilled
the ground; the freedmen were the artisans, the men-at-arms, the
herders of cattle; the knights defended Nimmr against its enemies,
competed in tourneys and hunted wild game in the valley and its
surrounding mountains.</p>

<p>As the days passed Blake found himself rapidly acquiring a
certain proficiency in knightly arts under the wise tutorage of Sir
Richard. The use of sword and buckler he found most difficult,
notwithstanding the fact that he had been proficient with the foils
in his college days, for the knights of Nimmr knew naught of the
defensive use of their two edged weapons and seldom used the point
for other purpose than the <i>coup-de-grace</i>. For them the sword
was almost wholly a cutting weapon, the buckler their sole defense;
but as Blake practiced with this weapon it dawned upon him that his
knowledge of fencing might be put to advantage should the necessity
arise, to the end that his awkwardness with the buckler should be
outweighed by his nicer defensive handling of his sword and his
offensive improved by the judicious use of the point, against which
they had developed little or no defense.</p>

<p>The lance he found less difficult, its value being so largely
dependent upon the horsemanship of him who wielded it, and that
Blake was a splendid horseman was evidenced by his polo rating as
an eight goal man.</p>

<p>The ballium, or outer court, which lay between the inner and
outer walls of the castle and entirely surrounded it, was, upon the
north or valley side, given over entirely to knightly practice and
training. Here the ballium was very wide, and against the inner
wall was built a wooden grand stand that could be quickly removed
in the event of an attack upon the castle.</p>

<p>Jousts and tilts were held here weekly, while the great tourneys
that occurred less often were given upon a field outside the castle
wall upon the floor of the valley.</p>

<p>Daily many knights and ladies came to watch the practice and
training that filled the ballium with life and action and color
during the morning hours. Good-natured banter flew back and forth,
wagers were laid, and woe betide the contender who was unhorsed
during these practice bouts, for the thing that a knight dreaded
even more than he dreaded death was ridicule.</p>

<p>In the formal jousts that were held weekly greater decorum was
observed by the audience, but during the daily practice their
raillery verged upon brutality.</p>

<p>It was before such an audience as this that Blake received his
training, and because he was a novelty the audiences were larger
than usual, and because the friends of Sir Malud and the friends of
Sir Richard had tacitly acknowledged him as an issue both the
applause and the ridicule were loud and boisterous.</p>

<p>Even the Prince came often and Guinalda always was there. It was
soon apparent that Prince Gobred leaned slightly to the side of Sir
Malud, with the natural result that Malud's party immediately
acquired numerous recruits.</p>

<p>The training of the lads who were squires to the knights and who
would one day be admitted to the charmed circle of knighthood
occupied the earlier hours of the morning. This was followed by
practice tilts between knights, during which Sir Richard or one of
his friends undertook the training of Blake at the far side of the
ballium, and it was during this practice that the American's
outstanding horsemanship became apparent, even Gobred being led to
applause.</p>

<p>"'Od's bodikins," he exclaimed, "the man be a part of his
charger!"</p>

<p>"'Twas but chance that saved him from a fall," said Malud.</p>

<p>"Mayhap," agreed Gobred, "but at that me likes the looks of him
within a saddle."</p>

<p>"He doeth not too ill with his lance," admitted Malud. "But,
'Od's blood! didst ever see a more awkward lout with a buckler?
Methinks he hath had more use for a trencher." This sally elicited
roars of laughter in which the Princess Guinalda did not join, a
fact which Malud, whose eyes were often upon her, was quick to
note. "Thou still believest this churl to be a knight, Princess
Guinalda?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Have I said aught?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Thou didst not laugh," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"He is a stranger knight, far from his own country and it
seemeth not a knightly nor a gentle thing to ridicule him," she
replied. "Therefore I did not laugh, for I was not amused."</p>

<p>Later that day as Blake joined the others in the great court, he
ran directly into Malud's party, nor was it at all an accident, as
he never made any effort to avoid Malud or his friends and was,
seemingly, oblivious to their thinly veiled taunts and
insinuations. Malud himself attributed this to the density and
ignorance of a yokel, which he insisted Blake to be, but there were
others who rather admired Blake for his attitude, seeing in it a
studied affront that Malud was too dense to perceive.</p>

<p>Most of the inmates of the grim castle of Nimmr were inclined
pleasantly toward the newcomer. He had brought with him an air of
freshness and newness that was rather a relief from the hoary
atmosphere that had surrounded Nimmr for nearly seven and a half
centuries. He had brought them new words and new expressions and
new views, which many of them were joyously adopting, and had it
not been for the unreasoning antagonism of the influential Sir
Malud, Blake had been accepted with open arms.</p>

<p>Sir Richard was far more popular than Malud, but lacked the
latter's wealth in horses, arms and retainers and consequently had
less influence with Prince Gobred. However there were many
independent souls who either followed Sir Richard because they were
fond of him or arrived at their own decisions without reference to
the dictates of policy, and many of these were staunch friends to
Blake.</p>

<p>Not all of those who surrounded Malud this afternoon were
antagonistic to the American, but the majority of them laughed when
Malud laughed and frowned when he frowned, for in the courts of
kings and princes flourished the first order of "yes men."</p>

<p>Blake was greeted by many a smile and nod as he advanced and
bowed low before the Princess Guinalda who was one of the company
and, being of princely blood, entitled to his first devoirs.</p>

<p>"Thou didst well this morning, Sir James," said the princess,
kindly. "It pleases me greatly to see thee ride."</p>

<p>"Methinks 'twould be a rarer treat to see him serve a side of
venison," sneered Malud.</p>

<p>This provoked so much laughter that Malud was encouraged to seek
further applause.</p>

<p>"Gadzooks!" he cried, "arm him with a trencher and carving knife
and he would be at home."</p>

<p>"Speaking of serving," said Blake, "and Sir Malud's mind seems
to be more occupied with that than with more knightly things, does
any of you know what is necessary quickly to serve fresh pig?"</p>

<p>"Nay, fair sir knight," said Guinalda, "we know not. Prithee
tell us."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell us," roared Malud, "thou, indeed, shouldst know."</p>

<p>"You said a mouthful, old scout, I do know!"</p>

<p>"And what be necessary that you may quickly serve fresh pig?"
demanded Malud, looking about him and winking.</p>

<p>"A trencher, a carving knife and you, Sir Malud," replied
Blake.</p>

<p>It was several seconds before the thrust penetrated their simple
minds and it was the Princess Guinalda who first broke into merry
laughter and soon all were roaring, while some explained the quip
to others.</p>

<p>No, not all were laughing&mdash;not Sir Malud. When he grasped
the significance of Blake's witticism he first turned very red and
then went white, for the great Sir Malud liked not to be the butt
of ridicule, which is ever the way of those most prone to turn
ridicule upon others.</p>

<p>"Sirrah," he cried, "darest thou affront Malud? 'Od's blood,
fellow! Low-born varlet! Only thy blood can atone this
affront!"</p>

<p>"Hop to it, old thing!" replied Blake. "Name your poison!"</p>

<p>"I know not the meaning of thy silly words," cried Malud, "but I
know that an thou dost not meet me in fair tilt upon the morrow I
shall whip thee across the Valley of the Holy Sepulcher with a
barrel stave."</p>

<p>"You're on!" snapped back Blake. "Tomorrow morning in the south
ballium with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou mayst choose the weapons, sirrah," said Malud.</p>

<p>"Don't call me sirrah, I don't like it," said Blake very
quietly, and now he was not smiling. "I want to tell you something,
Malud, that may be good for your soul. You are really the only man
in Nimmr who didn't want to treat me well and give me a chance, a
fair chance, to prove that I am all right."</p>

<p>"You think you are a great knight, but you are not. You have no
intelligence, no heart, no chivalry. You are not what we would call
in my country a good sport. You have a few horses and a few
men-at-arms. That is all you have, for without them you would not
have the favor of the Prince, and without his favor you would have
no friends.</p>

<p>"You are not so good or great a man in any way as is Sir
Richard, who combines all the qualities of chivalry that for
centuries have glorified the order of knighthood; nor are you so
good a man as I, who, with your own weapons, will best you on the
morrow when, in the north ballium, I meet you on horseback with
sword and buckler!"</p>

<p>The members of the party, upon seeing Malud's wrath, had
gradually fallen away from Blake until, as he concluded his speech,
he stood alone a few paces apart from Malud and those who
surrounded him. Then it was that one stepped from among those at
Malud's side and walked to Blake. It was Guinalda.</p>

<p>"Sir James." she said with a sweet smile, "thou spokest with thy
mouth full!" She broke into a merry laugh. "Walk with me in the
garden, sir knight," and taking his arm she guided him toward the
south end of the eastern court.</p>

<p>"You're wonderful!" was all that Blake could find to say.</p>

<p>"Dost really think I am wonderful?" she demanded. "I had to know
if men speak the truth to such as I. The truth, as people see it,
is spoke more oft to slaves than princes."</p>

<p>"I hope to prove it by my conduct," he said.</p>

<p>They had drawn a short distance away from the others now and the
girl suddenly laid her hand impulsively upon his.</p>

<p>"I brought thee away, Sir James, that I might speak with thee
alone," she said.</p>

<p>"I do not care what the reason was so long as you did it," he
replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"Thou art a stranger among us, unaccustomed to our ways,
unversed in knightly practice&mdash;so much so that there are many
who doubt thy claims to knighthood. Yet thou art a brave man, or
else a very simple one, or thou wouldst never have chosen to meet
Sir Malud with sword and buckler, for he is skilled with these
while thou art clumsy with them.</p>

<p>"Because I think that thou goest to thy death tomorrow I have
brought thee aside to speak with thee."</p>

<p>"What can be done about it now?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"Thou art passing fair with thy lance," she said, "and it is
still not too late to change thy selection of weapons. I beg thee
to do so."</p>

<p>"You care?" he asked. There can be a world of meaning in two
words.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes dropped for an instant and then flashed up to
his and there was a touch of hauteur in them. "I am the daughter of
the Prince of Nimmr," she said. "I care for the humblest of my
father's subjects."</p>

<p>"I guess that will hold you for a while, Sir James," thought
Blake, but to the girl he said nothing, only smiled.</p>

<p>Presently she stamped her foot. "Thou hast an impudent smile,
sirrah!" she exclaimed angrily. "Melikes it not. Then thou art too
forward with the daughter of a prince."</p>

<p>"I merely asked you if you cared whether I was killed. Even a
cat could ask that."</p>

<p>"And I replied. Why then didst thou smile?"</p>

<p>"Because your eyes had answered me before your lips had spoken
and I knew that your eyes had told the truth."</p>

<p>Again she stamped her foot angrily. "Thou art indeed a forward
boor," she exclaimed. "I shall not remain to be insulted
further."</p>

<p>Her head held high she turned and walked haughtily away to
rejoin the other party.</p>

<p>Blake stepped quickly after her. "Tomorrow," he whispered, "I
meet Sir Malud with sword and buckler. With your favor upon my helm
I could overthrow the best sword in Nimmr."</p>

<p>The Princess Guinalda did not deign to acknowledge that she had
heard his words as she walked on to join the others clustered about
Sir Malud.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; "TOMORROW THOU
DIEST!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a great celebration in the village of
Batondo the chief the night that Ulala returned. A goat was killed
and many chickens, and there were fruit and cassava bread and
native beer in plenty for all. There was music, too, and dancing.
With all of which it was morning before they sought their sleeping
mats, with the result that it was after noon the following day
before Fejjuan had an opportunity to speak of serious matters with
Batando.</p>

<p>When finally he sought him out he found the old chief squatting
in the shade before his hut, slightly the worse for the orgy of the
preceding night.</p>

<p>"I have come to talk with you, Batando," he said, "of the desert
people."</p>

<p>Batando grunted. His head ached.</p>

<p>"Yesterday you said that you would lead them to the entrance to
the forbidden valley," said Fejjuan. "You mean, then, that you will
not fight them?"</p>

<p>"We shall not have to fight them if we lead them to the entrance
to the forbidden valley," replied Batando.</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles," said Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"Listen, Ulala," replied the old chief. "In childhood you were
stolen from your people and taken from your country. Being young,
there were many things you did not know and there are others that
you have forgotten.</p>

<p>"It is not difficult to enter the forbidden valley, especially
from the north. Every Galla knows how to find the northern pass
through the mountains or the tunnel beyond the great cross that
marks the southern entrance. There are only these two ways
in&mdash;every Galla knows them; but every Galla also knows that
there is no way out of the forbidden valley."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Batando?" demanded Fejjuan. "If there are two
ways in, there must be two ways out."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there is no way out," insisted the chief. "As far back
as goes the memory of man or the tales of our fathers and our
fathers' fathers it is known that many men have entered the
forbidden valley, and it is also known that no man has ever come
out of it."</p>

<p>"And why have they not come out?"</p>

<p>Batando shook his head. "Who knows?" he asked. "We cannot even
guess their fate."</p>

<p>"What sort of people inhabit the valley?" asked Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"Not even that is known. No man has seen them and returned to
tell. Some say they are the spirits of the dead, others that the
valley is peopled by leopards; but no one knows.</p>

<p>"Go therefore, Ulala, and tell the chief of the desert people
that we will lead him to the entrance to the valley. If we do this
we shall not have to fight him and his people, nor shall we ever
again be bothered by them," and Batando laughed at his little
joke.</p>

<p>"Will you send guides back with me to lead the Bedauwy to the
valley?" asked Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"No," replied the chief. "Tell them we shall come in three days.
In the meantime I shall gather together many warriors from other
villages, for I do not trust the desert people. Thus we shall
conduct them through our country. Explain this to their chief and
also that in payment he must release to us all the Galla slaves he
has with him&mdash;before he enters the valley."</p>

<p>"That Ibn Jad will not do," said Fejjuan.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, when he sees himself surrounded by Galla warriors, he
will be glad to do even more," replied Batando.</p>

<p>And so Fejjuan, the Galla slave, returned to his masters and
reported all that Batando had told him to report.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad at first refused to give up his slaves, but when Fejjuan
had convinced him that under no other terms would Batando lead him
to the entrance to the valley, and that his refusal to liberate the
slaves would invite the hostile attentions of the Gallas, he
finally consented; but in the back of his mind was the thought that
before his promise was consummated he might find an opportunity to
evade it.</p>

<p>Only one regret had Fejjuan in betraying the Beduins, and that
was caused by his liking for Ateja, but being a fatalist he was
consoled by the conviction that whatever was to be, would be,
regardless of what he might do.</p>

<p><br>AND as Ibn Jad waited and Batando gathered his black warriors
from far and near, Tarzan of the Apes came to the water hole of the
smooth, round rocks and took up the trail of the Beduins.</p>

<p>Since he had learned from Blake's blacks that the young American
was missing and also that they had seen nothing of Stimbol since
the latter had separated from Blake and started for the coast, the
ape-man was more convinced than ever that the white prisoner among
the Arabs was Blake.</p>

<p>Still he felt no great concern for the man's safety, for if the
Beduins had sufficient hopes of reward to spare his life at all he
was in no great danger from them. Reasoning thus Tarzan made no
pretense of speed as he followed the spoor of Ibn Jad and his
people.</p>

<p><br>TWO men sat upon rough benches at opposite sides of a rude
table. Between them a cresset of oil with a cotton wick laying in
it burned feebly, slightly illuminating the stone flagging of the
floor and casting weird shadows of themselves upon the rough stone
walls.</p>

<p>Through a narrow window, innocent of glass, the night air blew,
driving the flame of the cresset now this way, now that. Upon the
table, between the men, lay a square board blocked off into
squares, and within some of these were several wooden pieces.</p>

<p>"It is your move, Richard," said one of the men. "You don't
appear to be very keen about the game tonight. What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"I be thinking of the morrow, James, and my heart be heavy
within me," replied the other.</p>

<p>"And why?" demanded Blake.</p>

<p>"Malud is not the best swordsman in Nimmr," replied Sir Richard,
"but&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am the worst," Blake finished the sentence for him,
laughingly.</p>

<p>Sir Richard looked up and smiled. "Thou wilt always joke, even
in the face of death," he said. "Are all the men of this strange
country thou tellest of alike?"</p>

<p>"It is your move, Richard," said Blake.</p>

<p>"Hide not his sword from thine eyes with thy buckler, James,"
cautioned Richard. "Ever keep thine eyes upon his eyes until thou
knowest whereat he striketh, then, with thy buckler ready, thou
mayst intercept the blow, for he be over-slow and always his eyes
proclaim where his blade will fall. Full well I know that, for
often have I exercised against him."</p>

<p>"And he hasn't killed you," Blake reminded him.</p>

<p>"Ah, we did but practice, but on the morrow it will be
different, for Malud engages thee to the death, in mortal combat my
friend, to wash away in blood the affront thou didst put him."</p>

<p>"He wants to kill me, just for that?" asked Blake. "I'll tell
the world he's a touchy little rascal!"</p>

<p>"Were it only that, he might be satisfied merely to draw blood,
but there is more that he hath against thee."</p>

<p>"More? What? I've scarcely spoken to him a dozen times," said
Blake.</p>

<p>"He be jealous."</p>

<p>"Jealous? Of whom?"</p>

<p>"He would wed the Princess and he hath seen in what manner thou
lookest at her," explained Richard.</p>

<p>"Poppycock!" cried Blake, but he flushed.</p>

<p>"Nay, he is not the only one who hath marked it," insisted
Richard.</p>

<p>"You're crazy," snapped Blake.</p>

<p>"Often men look thus at the princess, for she be beautiful
beyond compare, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has he killed them all?" demanded the American.</p>

<p>"No, for the princess did not look back at <i>them</i> in the
same manner."</p>

<p>Blake leaned back upon his bench and laughed. "Now I know you're
crazy," he cried, "all of you. I'll admit that I think the princess
is a mighty sweet kid, but say young fellow, she can't see me a
little bit."</p>

<p>"Enough of thy outlandish speech I grasp to gather thy meaning,
James, but thou canst not confuse me upon the one subject nor
deceive me upon the other. The eyes of the princess seldom leave
thee whilst thou art at practice upon the lists and the look in
thine when they rest upon her&mdash;hast ever seen a hound adoring
his master?"</p>

<p>"Run along and sell your papers," admonished Blake.</p>

<p>"For this, Malud would put thee out of the way and it is because
I know this that I grieve, for I have learned to like thee over
well, my friend."</p>

<p>Blake arose and came around the end of the table. "You're a good
old scout, Richard," he said, placing a hand affectionately upon
the other's shoulder, "but do not worry&mdash;I am not dead yet. I
know I seem awkward with the sword, but I have learned much about
its possibilities within the past few days and I think that Sir
Malud has a surprise awaiting him."</p>

<p>"Thy courage and thy vast assurance should carry thee far,
James, but they may not overcome a life-time of practice with the
sword, and that is the advantage Malud hath over thee."</p>

<p>"Doth Prince Gobred favor Malud's suit?" demanded Blake.</p>

<p>"Why not? Malud is a powerful knight, with a great castle of his
own and many horses and retainers. Besides a dozen knights he hath
fully an hundred men-at-arms."</p>

<p>"There are several knights who have their own castles and
following are there not?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"Twenty, perchance," replied Richard.</p>

<p>"And they live close to Gobred's castle?"</p>

<p>"At the edge of the hills, within three leagues upon either hand
of Gobred's castle," explained Richard.</p>

<p>"And no others live in all this great valley?" demanded
Blake.</p>

<p>"You have heard mention made of Bohun?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Yes, often&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"He calls himself king, but never will we refer to him as king.
He and his followers dwell upon the opposite side of the valley.
They number, perchance, as many as we and we are always at war
against them."</p>

<p>"But I've been hearing quite a bit about a great tournament for
which the knights are practicing now. I thought that Bohun and his
knights were to take part in it."</p>

<p>"They be. Once each year, commencing upon the first Sunday of
Lent and extending over a period of three days, there hath been
from time immemorial a truce declared between the Fronters and the
Backers, during which is held the Great Tourney, one year in the
plain before the city of Nimmr and the next year in the plain
before the City of the Sepulcher, as they call it."</p>

<p>"Fronters and Backers! What in heck do those mean?" demanded
Blake.</p>

<p>"Thou art a knight of Nimmr and know not that?" exclaimed
Richard.</p>

<p>"What I know about knighting would rattle around in a peanut
shell," admitted Blake.</p>

<p>"Thou shouldst know and I shall tell thee. Hark thou well,
then," said Richard, "for I must need go back to the very
beginning." He poured two goblets of wine from a flagon standing on
the floor beside him, took a long drink and proceeded with his
tale. "Richard I sailed from Sicily in the spring of 1191 with all
his great following bound for Acre, where he was to meet the French
king, Philip Augustus, and wrest the Holy Land from the power of
the Saracen. But Richard tarried upon the way to conquer Cyprus and
punish the vile despot who had placed an insult upon Berengaria,
whom Richard was to wed.</p>

<p>"When the great company again set their sails for Acre there
were many Cyprian maidens hidden away upon the ships by knights who
had taken a fancy to their lovely faces, and it so befell that two
of these ships, encountering a storm, were blown from their course
and wrecked upon the Afric shore.</p>

<p>"One of these companies was commanded by a knight yclept Bohun
and the other by one Gobred, and though they marched together they
kept separate other than when attacked.</p>

<p>"Thus, searching for Jerusalem, they came upon this valley which
the followers of Bohun declared was the Valley of the Holy
Sepulcher and that the crusade was over. Their crosses, that they
had worn upon their breasts as do all crusaders who have not
reached their goal, they removed and placed upon their backs to
signify that the crusade was over and that they were returning
home.</p>

<p>"Gobred insisted that this was not the Valley of the Holy
Sepulcher and that the crusade was not accomplished. He, therefore,
and all his followers, retained their crosses upon their breasts
and built a city and a strong castle to defend the entrance to the
valley that Bohun and his followers might be prevented from
returning to England until they had accomplished their mission.</p>

<p>"Bohun crossed the valley and built a city and a castle to
prevent Gobred from pushing on in the direction in which the latter
knew that the true Sepulcher lay, and for nearly seven and a half
centuries the descendants of Bohun have prevented the descendants
of Gobred from pushing on and rescuing the Holy Land from the
Saracen, while the descendants of Gobred have prevented the
descendants of Bohun from returning to England, to the dishonor of
knighthood.</p>

<p>"Gobred took the title of prince and Bohun that of king and
these titles have been handed down from father to son during the
centuries, while the followers of Gobred still wear the cross upon
their breasts and are called therefrom, the Fronters, and the
followers of Bohun wear theirs upon their backs and are called
Backers."</p>

<p>"And you would still push on and liberate the Holy Land?" asked
Blake.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Richard, "and the Backers would return to
England; but long since have we realized the futility of either
hope, since we are surrounded by a vast army of Saracens and our
numbers be too few to pit against them.</p>

<p>"Thinkest thou not that we are wise to remain here under such
stress?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd certainly surprise 'em if you rode into Jerusalem,
or London, either," admitted Blake. "On the whole, Richard, I'd
remain right here, if I were you. You see, after seven hundred and
thirty-five years most of the home folks may have forgotten you and
even the Saracens might not know what it was all about if you came
charging into Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"Mayhap thou speakest wisely, James," said Richard, "and then,
too, we are content here, knowing no other country."</p>

<p>For a while both men were silent, in thought. Blake was the
first to speak. "This big tourney interests me," he said. "You say
it starts the first Sunday in Lent. That's not far away."</p>

<p>"No, not far. Why?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering if you thought I'd be in shape to have a part
in it. I'm getting better and better with the lance every day."</p>

<p>Sir Richard looked sadly at him and shook his head. "Tomorrow
thou wilt be dead," he said.</p>

<p>"Say! You're a cheerful party," exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p>"I am only truthful, good friend," replied Richard. "It grieveth
my heart sorely that it should be true, but true it is&mdash;thou
canst not prevail over Sir Malud on the morrow. Would that I might
take thy place in the lists against him, but that may not be. But I
console myself with the thought that thou wilt comport thyself
courageously and die as a good sir knight should, with no stain
upon thy escutcheon. Greatly will it solace the Princess Guinalda
to know that thou didst die thus."</p>

<p>"You think so?" ventured Blake.</p>

<p>"Verily."</p>

<p>"And if I don't die&mdash;will she be put out?"</p>

<p>"Put out! Put out of what?" demanded Richard.</p>

<p>"Will she be sore vexed, then," corrected Blake.</p>

<p>"I should not go so far as to say that," admitted Richard, "but
natheless it appeareth certain that no lady would rejoice to see
her promised husband overthrown and killed, and if thou beest not
slain it may only be because thou hast slain Malud."</p>

<p>"She is his affianced wife?" demanded Blake.</p>

<p>"'Tis understood, that is all. As yet no formal marriage bans
have been proclaimed."</p>

<p>"I'm going to turn in," snapped Blake. "If I've got to be killed
tomorrow I ought to get a little sleep tonight."</p>

<p>As he stretched himself upon a rough wool blanket that was
spread over a bed of rushes upon the stone floor in one corner of
the room and drew another similar blanket over him, he felt less
like sleep than he had ever felt before. The knowledge that on the
morrow he was to meet a medieval knight in mortal combat naturally
gave him considerable concern, but Blake was too self-reliant and
too young to seriously harbor the belief that he would be the one
to be killed. He knew it was possible but he did not intend to
permit the thought to upset him. There was, however, another that
did. It upset him very much and, too, it made him angry when he
realized that he was concerned about it&mdash;about the proposed
marriage of Sir Malud of West Castle and Guinalda, Princess of
Nimmr.</p>

<p>Could it be that he had been ass enough, he soliloquized, to
have fallen in love with this little medieval princess who probably
looked upon him as dirt beneath her feet? And what was he going to
do about Malud? Suppose he should get the better of the fellow on
the morrow? Well, what about it? If he killed him that would make
Guinalda unhappy. If he didn't kill him&mdash;what? Sir James did
not know.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; IN THE</a> <a title=
"TENT">BEYT</a> OF ZEYD</h2>

<p class="first">IBN JAD waited three days in his <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> but
no Galla guides arrived to lead him into the valley as Batando had
promised, and so he sent Fejjuan once more to the chief to urge him
to hasten, for always in the mind of Ibn Jad was the fear of Tarzan
of the Apes and the thought that he might return to thwart and
punish him.</p>

<p>He knew he was out of Tarzan's country now, but he also knew
that where boundaries were so vague he could not definitely count
upon this fact as an assurance of safety from reprisal. His one
hope was that Tarzan was awaiting his return through Tarzan's
country, and this Ibn Jad had definitely decided not to attempt.
Instead he was planning upon moving directly west, passing north of
the ape-man's stamping grounds, until he picked up the trail to the
north down which he had traveled from the desert country.</p>

<p>In the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of the sheikh with Ibn Jad sat Tollog, his brother, and Fahd and
Stimbol, besides some other Arabs. They were speaking of Batando's
delay in sending guides and they were fearful of treachery, for it
had long been apparent to them that the old chief was gathering a
great army of warriors, and though Fejjuan assured them that they
would not be used against the Arabs if Ibn Jad resorted to no
treachery, yet they were all apprehensive of danger.</p>

<p>Ateja, employed with the duties of the harem, did not sing nor
smile as had been her wont, for her heart was heavy with mourning
for her lover. She heard the talk in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
but it did not interest her. Seldom did her eyes glance above the
curtain that separated the women's quarters from the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>,
and when they did the fires of hatred blazed within them as they
crossed the countenance of Fahd.</p>

<p>She chanced to be thus glancing when she saw Fahd's eyes, which
were directed outward across the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>, go
suddenly wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, Ibn Jad!" cried the man.
"Look!"</p>

<p>With the others Ateja glanced in the direction Fahd was staring
and with the others she voiced a little gasp of astonishment,
though those of the men were rounded into oaths.</p>

<p>Walking straight across the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
toward the sheikh's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> strode a
bronzed giant armed with a spear, arrows and a knife. Upon his back
was suspended an oval shield and across one shoulder and his breast
was coiled a rope, hand plaited from long fibers.</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes!" ejaculated Ibn Jad. "The curse of Allah be
upon him!"</p>

<p>"He must have brought his black warriors with him and left them
hidden in the forest," whispered Tollog. "Not else would he dare
enter the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
the <a title="Beduins"><i>Beduw</i></a>."</p>

<p>Ibn Jad was heartsick and he was thinking fast when the ape-man
halted directly in the outer opening of the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>.
Tarzan let his eyes run quickly over the assemblage. They stopped
upon Stimbol, finally. "Where is Blake?" he demanded of the
American.</p>

<p>"You ought to know," growled Stimbol.</p>

<p>"Have you seen him since you and he separated?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You are sure of that?" insisted the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>Tarzan turned to Ibn Jad. "You have lied to me. You are not here
to trade but to find and sack a city, to take its treasure and
steal its women."</p>

<p>"That is a lie!" cried Ibn Jad. "Whoever told thee that,
lied."</p>

<p>"I do not think he lied," replied Tarzan. "He seemed an honest
youth."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" demanded Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"His name is Zeyd." Ateja heard and was suddenly galvanized to
new interest. "He says all this and more, and I believe him."</p>

<p>"What else did he tell thee, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>?"</p>

<p>"That another stole his musket and sought to slay thee, Ibn Jad,
and then put the blame upon him."</p>

<p>"That is a lie, like all he hath told thee!" cried Fahd.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad sat in thought, his brows contracted in a dark scowl,
but presently he looked up at Tarzan with a crooked smile.
"Doubtless the poor youth thought that he spoke the truth," he
said. "Just as he thought that he should slay his sheikh and for
the same reason. Always hath his brain been sick, but never before
did I think him dangerous.</p>

<p>"He hath deceived thee, Tarzan of the Apes, and that I can prove
by all my people as well as by this <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> I have befriended, for all
will tell thee that I am seeking to obey thee and leave thy
country. Why else then should I have traveled north back in the
direction of my own <a title="village"><i>beled</i></a>?"</p>

<p>"If thou wishedst to obey me why didst thou hold me prisoner and
send thy brother to slay me in the night?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Again thou wrongst Ibn Jad," said the sheikh sadly. "My brother
came to cut thy bonds and set thee free, but thou settest upon him
and then came <a title="elephant"><i>el-fil</i></a> and carried
thee away."</p>

<p>"And what meant thy brother when he raised his knife and cried:
'Die, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>!" demanded
the ape-man. "Sayeth a man thus who cometh to do a kindness?"</p>

<p>"I did but joke," mumbled Tollog.</p>

<p>"I am here again," said Tarzan, "but not to joke. My Waziri are
coming. Together we shall see you well on your way toward the
desert."</p>

<p>"It is what we wish," said the sheikh quickly. "Ask this other
<a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> if it be not true
that we are lost and would be but too glad to have thee lead us
upon the right way. Here we are beset by Galla warriors. Their
chief hath been gathering them for days and momentarily we fear
that we shall be attacked. Is that not true, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>?" he turned to Stimbol as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," said Stimbol.</p>

<p>"It is true that you are going to leave the country," said
Tarzan, "and I shall remain to see that you do so. Tomorrow you
will start. In the meantime set aside a <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> for me&mdash;and let there be no more
treachery."</p>

<p>"Thou needst fear nothing," Ibn Jad assured him, then he turned
his face toward the women's quarters. "Hirfa! Ateja!" he called.
"Make ready the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Zeyd for the
sheikh of the jungle."</p>

<p>To one side but at no great distance from the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of Ibn Jad the two women raised the black
tent for Tarzan, and when the <a title=
"Arabic&mdash;a tent-pole"><i>am'dan</i></a> had been placed and
straightened and the <a title="guy-ropes"><i>tunb el-beyt</i></a>
made fast to the pegs that Ateja drove into the earth Hirfa
returned to her household duties, leaving her daughter to stretch
the side curtains.</p>

<p>The instant that Hirfa was out of ear shot Ateja ran to
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Oh, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," she
cried, "thou hast seen my Zeyd? He is safe?"</p>

<p>"I left him in a village where the chief will care for him until
such time as thy people come upon thy return to the desert country.
He is quite safe and well."</p>

<p>"Tell me of him, oh, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, for my heart hungers for
word of him," implored the girl. "How came you upon him? Where was
he?"</p>

<p>"His mare had been dragged down by <a title=
"lion"><i>el-adrea</i></a> who was about to devour your lover. I
chanced to be there and slew <a title="lion"><i>el-adrea</i></a>.
Then I took Zeyd to the village of a chief who is my friend, for I
knew that he could not survive the perils of the jungle should I
leave him afoot and alone. It was my thought to send him from the
country in safety, but he begged to remain until you returned that
way. This I have permitted. In a few weeks you will see your
lover."</p>

<p>Tears were falling from Ateja's long, black lashes&mdash;tears
of joy&mdash;as she seized Tarzan's hand and kissed it. "My life
is thine, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," she
cried, "for that thou hast given me back my lover."</p>

<p><br>THAT night as the Galla slave, Fejjuan, walked through the
<a title=
"encampment, camp; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
of his masters he saw Ibn Jad and Tollog sitting in the sheikh's
<a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
whispering together and Fejjuan, well aware of the inherent
turpitude of this precious pair, wondered what might be the nature
of their plotting.</p>

<p>Behind the curtain of the harem Ateja lay huddled upon her
sleeping mat, but she did not sleep. Instead she was listening to
the whispered conversation of her father and her uncle.</p>

<p>"He must be put out of the way," Ibn Jad insisted.</p>

<p>"But his Waziri are coming," objected Tollog. "If they do not
find him here what can we say? They will not believe us, whatever
we say. They will set upon us. I have heard that they are terrible
men."</p>

<p>"By Allah!" cried Ibn Jad. "If he stays we are undone. Better
risk something than to return empty handed to our own country after
all that we have passed through."</p>

<p>"If thou thinkest that I shall again take this business upon
myself thou art mistaken, brother," said Tollog. "Once was
enough."</p>

<p>"No, not thou; but we must find a way. Is there none among us
who might wish more than another to be rid of the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>?" asked Ibn Jad, but to
himself as though he were thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"The other <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>!"
exclaimed Tollog. "He hateth him."</p>

<p>Ibn Jad clapped his hands together. "Thou hast it, brother!"</p>

<p>"But still shall we be held responsible," reminded Tollog.</p>

<p>"What matter if he be out of the way. We can be no worse off
than we now are. Suppose Batando came tomorrow with the guides?
Then indeed would the jungle sheikh know that we have lied to him,
and it might go hard with us. No, we must be rid of him this very
night."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how?" asked Tollog.</p>

<p>"Hold! I have a plan. Listen well, O brother!" and Ibn Jad
rubbed his palms together and smiled, but he would not have smiled,
perhaps had he known that Ateja listened, or had he seen the silent
figure crouching in the dark just beyond the outer curtain of his
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>.</p>

<p>"Speak, Ibn Jad," urged Tollog, "tell me thy plan."</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, it is known by
all that the <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>
Stimbol hates the sheikh of the jungle. With loud tongue he has
proclaimed it many times before all when many were gathered in my
<a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>."</p>

<p>"You would send Stimbol to slay Tarzan of the Apes?"</p>

<p>"Thou guessed'st aright," admitted Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"But how will that relieve us of responsibility? He will have
been slain by thy order in thine own <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>,"
objected Tollog.</p>

<p>"Wait! I shall not command the one <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> to slay the other; I shall
but suggest it, and when it is done I shall be filled with rage and
horror that this murder hath been done in my <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>. And
to prove my good faith I shall order that the murderer be put to
death in punishment for his crime. Thus we shall be rid of two
unbelieving dogs and at the same time be able to convince the
Waziri that we were indeed the friends of their sheikh, for we
shall mourn him with loud lamentations&mdash;when the Waziri shall
have arrived."</p>

<p>"Allah be praised for such a brother!" exclaimed Tollog,
enraptured.</p>

<p>"Go thou now, at once, and summon the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> Stimbol," directed Ibn Jad.
"Send him to me alone, and after I have spoken with him and he hath
departed upon his errand come thou back to my <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a>."</p>

<p>Ateja trembled upon her sleeping mat, while the silent figure
crouching outside the sheikh's tent arose after Tollog had departed
and disappeared in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Hastily summoned from the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of
Fahd, Stimbol, cautioned to stealth by Tollog, moved silently
through the darkness to the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of the sheikh where he found Ibn Jad awaiting him.</p>

<p>"Sit, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," invited
the Beduin.</p>

<p>"What in hell do you want of me this time of night?" demanded
Stimbol.</p>

<p>"I have been talking with Tarzan of the Apes," said Ibn Jad,
"and because you are my friend and he is not I have sent for you to
tell you what he plans for you. He has interfered in all my designs
and is driving me from the country, but that is as nothing compared
with what he intends for you."</p>

<p>"What in hell is he up to now?" demanded Stimbol. "He's always
butting into someone else's business."</p>

<p>"Thou dost not like him?" asked Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" and Stimbol applied a vile epithet to
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt like him less when I tell thee," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me."</p>

<p>"He says that thou hast slain thy companion, Blake," explained
the sheikh, "and for that Tarzan is going to kill thee on the
morrow."</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Kill me?" demanded Stimbol. "Why he can't do it! What
does he think he is&mdash;a Roman emperor?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless he will do as he says," insisted Ibn Jad. "He is
all-powerful here. No one questions the acts of this great jungle
sheikh. Tomorrow he will kill thee."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you won't let him, Ibn Jad! Surely, you won't let
him?" Stimbol was already trembling with terror.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad elevated his palms, "What can I do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can&mdash;you can&mdash;why there must be something that
you can do," wailed the frightened man.</p>

<p>"There is naught that any can do&mdash;save yourself," whispered
the sheikh.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He lies asleep in yon <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>
and&mdash;thou hast a sharp <a title=
"an Arabian knife with an angled blade, the cutting edge being on the concave side">
<i>khusa</i></a>."</p>

<p>"I have never killed a man," whispered Stimbol.</p>

<p>"Nor hast thou ever been killed," reminded the sheikh; "but
tonight thou must kill or tomorrow thou wilt be killed."</p>

<p>"God!" gasped Stimbol.</p>

<p>"It is late," said Ibn Jad, "and I go to my sleeping mat. I have
warned thee&mdash;do what thou wilt in the matter," and he arose as
though to enter the women's quarters.</p>

<p>Trembling, Stimbol staggered out into the night. For a moment he
hesitated, then he crouched and crept silently through the darkness
toward the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> that had been erected
for the ape-man.</p>

<p>But ahead of him ran Ateja to warn the man who had saved her
lover from the fangs of <a title="lion"><i>el-adrea</i></a>. She
was almost at the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> she had helped to
erect for the ape-man when a figure stepped from another tent and
clapping a palm across her mouth and an arm about her waist held
her firmly.</p>

<p>"Where goest thou?" whispered a voice in her ear, a voice that
she recognized at once as belonging to her uncle; but Tollog did
not wait for a reply, he answered for her. "Thou wantest to warn
the <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> because he
befriended thy lover! Go thou back to thy father's <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a>. If he knew this he would slay thee. Go!"
And he gave her a great shove in the direction from which she had
come.</p>

<p>There was a nasty smile upon Tollog's lips as he thought how
neatly he had foiled the girl, and he thanked Allah that chance had
placed him in a position to intercept her before she had been able
to ruin them all; and even as Tollog, the brother of the sheikh,
smiled in his beard a hand reached out of the darkness behind him
and seized him by the throat&mdash;fingers grasped him and dragged
him away.</p>

<p><br>TREMBLING, bathed in cold sweat, grasping in tightly clenched
fingers the hilt of a keen knife, Wilbur Stimbol crept through the
darkness toward the tent of his victim.</p>

<p>Stimbol had been an irritable man, a bully and a coward; but he
was no criminal. Every fiber of his being revolted at the thing he
contemplated. He did not want to kill, but he was a cornered human
rat and he thought that death stared him in the face, leaving open
only this one way of escape.</p>

<p>As he entered the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of the ape-man
he steeled himself to accomplish that for which he had come, and he
was indeed a very dangerous, a very formidable man, as he crept to
the side of the figure lying in the darkness, wrapped in an old
burnoose.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; SWORD AND BUCKLER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the sun touched the turrets of the castle of
the Prince of Nimmr a youth rolled from between his blankets,
rubbed his eyes and stretched. Then he reached over and shook
another youth of about his own age who slept beside him.</p>

<p>"Awaken, Edward! Awaken, thou sluggard!" he cried.</p>

<p>Edward rolled over on his back and essayed to say "Eh?" and to
yawn at the same time.</p>

<p>"Up, lad!" urged Michel. "Forgottest thou that thy master fares
forth to be slain this day?"</p>

<p>Edward sat up, now fully awake. His eyes flashed. "'Tis a lie!"
he cried, loyally. "He will cleave Sir Malud from poll to
breast-plate with a single blow. There lives no sir knight with
such mighty thews as hath Sir James. Thou art disloyal, Michel, to
Sir Richard's friend who hath been a good and kindly friend to us
as well."</p>

<p>Michel patted the other lad upon the shoulder. "Nay, I did but
jest, Edward," he said. "My hopes are all for Sir James, and
yet&mdash;" he paused, "I fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fear what?" demanded Edward.</p>

<p>"That Sir James is not well enough versed in the use of sword
and buckler to overcome Sir Malud, for even were his strength the
strength of ten men it shall avail him naught without the skill to
use it."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt see!" maintained Edward, stoutly.</p>

<p>"I see that Sir James hath a loyal squire," said a voice behind
them, and turning they saw Sir Richard standing in the doorway,
"and may all his friends wish him well this day thus loyally!"</p>

<p>"I fell asleep last night praying to our Lord Jesus to guide his
blade through Sir Malud's helm," said Edward.</p>

<p>"Good! Get thou up now and look to thy master's mail and to the
trappings of his steed, that he may enter the lists bedight as
befits a noble sir knight of Nimmr," instructed Richard, and left
them.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock of this February morning. The sun shone
down into the great north ballium of the castle of Nimmr, glinting
from the polished mail of noble knights and from pike and
battle-axe of men-at-arms, picking out the gay color of the robes
of the women gathered in the grandstand below the inner wall.</p>

<p>Upon a raised dais at the front and center of the grandstand sat
Prince Gobred and his party, and upon either side of them and
extending to the far ends of the stand were ranged the noble
knights and ladies of Nimmr, while behind them sat men-at-arms who
were off duty, then the freedmen and, last of all, the serfs, for
under the beneficent rule of the house of Gobred these were
accorded many privileges.</p>

<p>At either end of the lists was a tent, gay with pennons and the
colors and devices of its owner; one with the green and gold of Sir
Malud and the other with the blue and silver of Sir James.</p>

<p>Before each of these tilts stood two men-at-arms, resplendent in
new apparel, the metal of their battle-axes gleaming brightly, and
here a groom held a restive, richly caparisoned charger, while the
squire of each of the contestants busied himself with last-minute
preparations for the encounter.</p>

<p>A trumpeter, statuesque, the bell of his trumpet resting upon
his hip, waited for the signal to sound the fanfare that would
announce the entrance of his master into the lists.</p>

<p>A few yards to the rear a second charger champed upon his bit as
he nuzzled the groom that held him in waiting for the knight who
would accompany each of the contestants upon the field.</p>

<p>In the blue and silver tilt sat Blake and Sir Richard, the
latter issuing instructions and advice, and of the two he was the
more nervous. Blake's hauberk, gorget and bassinet were of heavy
chain mail, the latter lined inside and covered outside, down to
the gorget, with leopard skin, offering fair protection for his
head from an ordinary, glancing blow; upon his breast was sewn a
large, red cross and from one shoulder depended the streamers of a
blue and silver rosette. Hanging from the pole of the tilt, upon a
wooden peg, were Blake's sword and buckler.</p>

<p>The grandstand was filled. Prince Gobred glanced up at the sun
and spoke to a knight at his side. The latter gave a brief command
to a trumpeter stationed at the princely loge and presently, loud
and clear, the notes of a trumpet rang in the ballium. Instantly
the tilts at either end of the lists were galvanized to activity,
while the grandstand seemed to spring to new life as necks were
craned first toward the tent of Sir Malud and then toward that of
Sir James.</p>

<p>Edward, flushed with excitement, ran into the tilt and seizing
Blake's sword passed the girdle about his hips and buckled it in
place at his left side, then, with the buckler, he followed his
master out of the tilt.</p>

<p>As Blake prepared to mount Edward held his stirrup while the
groom sought to quiet the nervous horse. The lad pressed Blake's
leg after he had swung into the saddle (no light accomplishment,
weighed down as he was by heavy chain mail) and looked up into his
face.</p>

<p>"I have prayed for thee, Sir James," he said, "I know that thou
wilt prevail."</p>

<p>Blake saw tears in the youth's eyes as he looked down at him and
he caught a choking note in his voice. "You're a good boy, Eddie,"
he said. "I'll promise that you won't have to be ashamed of
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir James, how could I? Even in death thou wilt be a noble
figure of a knight. A fairer one it hath never been given one to
see, methinks," Edward assured him as he handed him his round
buckler.</p>

<p>Sir Richard had by now mounted, and at a signal from him that
they were ready there was a fanfare from the trumpet at Sir Malud's
tilt and that noble sir knight rode forward, followed by a single
knight.</p>

<p>Blake's trumpeter now announced his master's entry and the
American rode out close along the front of the grandstand, followed
by Sir Richard. There was a murmur of applause for each contestant,
which increased as they advanced and met before Prince Gobred's
loge.</p>

<p>Here the four knights reined in and faced the Prince and each
raised the hilt of his sword to his lips and kissed it in salute.
As Gobred cautioned them to fight honorably, as true knights, and
reminded them of the rules governing the encounter Blake's eyes
wandered to the face of Guinalda.</p>

<p>The little princess sat stiffly erect, looking straight before
her. She seemed very white, Blake thought, and he wondered if she
were ill.</p>

<p>How beautiful, thought Blake, and though she did not once appear
to look at him he was not cast down, for neither did she look at
Malud.</p>

<p>Again the trumpet sounded and the four knights rode slowly back
to opposite ends of the lists and the principals waited for the
final signal to engage. Blake disengaged his arm from the leather
loop of his buckler and tossed the shield upon the ground.</p>

<p>Edward looked at him aghast. "My Lord knight!" he cried. "Art
ill? Art fainting? Didst drop thy buckler?" and he snatched it up
and held it aloft to Blake, though he knew full well that his eyes
had not deceived him and that his master had cast aside his only
protection.</p>

<p>To the horrified Edward there seemed but one explanation and
that his loyalty would not permit him to entertain for an
instant&mdash;that Blake was preparing to dismount and refuse to
meet Sir Malud, giving the latter the victory by default and
assuring himself of the contempt and ridicule of all Nimmr.</p>

<p>He ran to Richard who had not seen Blake's act. "Sir Richard!
Sir Richard!" he cried in a hoarse whisper. "Some terrible
affliction hath befallen Sir James!"</p>

<p>"Hey, what?" exclaimed Richard. "What meanest thou, lad?"</p>

<p>"He hath cast aside his buckler," cried the youth. "He must be
stricken sore ill, for it cannot be that otherwise he would refuse
combat."</p>

<p>Richard spurred to Blake's side. "Hast gone mad, man?" he
demanded. "Thou canst not refuse the encounter now unless thou
wouldst bring dishonor upon thy friends!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get that line?" demanded Blake. "Who said I was
going to quit?"</p>

<p>"But thy buckler?" cried Sir Richard.</p>

<p>The trumpet at the Prince's loge rang out peremptorily. Sir
Malud spurred forward to a fanfare from his own trumpeter.</p>

<p>"Let her go!" cried Blake to his.</p>

<p>"Thy buckler!" screamed Sir Richard.</p>

<p>"The damned thing was in my way," shouted Blake as he spurred
forward to meet the doughty Malud, Richard trailing behind him, as
did Malud's second behind that knight.</p>

<p>There was a confident smile upon the lips of Sir Malud and he
glanced often at the knights and ladies in the grandstand, but
Blake rode with his eyes always upon his antagonist.</p>

<p>Both horses had broken immediately into a gallop, and as they
neared one another Malud spurred forward at a run and Blake saw
that the man's aim was doubtless to overthrow him at the first
impact, or at least to so throw him out of balance as to make it
easy for Malud to strike a good blow before he could recover
himself.</p>

<p>Malud rode with his sword half raised at his right side, while
Blake's was at guard, a position unknown to the knights of Nimmr,
who guarded solely with their bucklers.</p>

<p>The horsemen approached to engage upon each other's left, and as
they were about to meet Sir Malud rose in his stirrups and swung
his sword hand down, to gain momentum, described a circle with his
blade and launched a terrific cut at Blake's head.</p>

<p>It was at that instant that some few in the grandstand realized
that Blake bore no buckler.</p>

<p>"His buckler! Sir James hath no buckler!"</p>

<p>"He hath lost his buckler!" rose now from all parts of the
stand; and from right beside him, where the two knights met before
the loge of Gobred, Blake heard a woman scream, but he could not
look to see if it were Guinalda.</p>

<p>As they met Blake reined his horse suddenly toward Malud's, so
that the two chargers' shoulders struck, and at the same time he
cast all his weight in the same direction, whereas Malud, who was
standing in his stirrups to deliver his blow, was almost in a state
of equilibrium and having his buckler ready for defense was quite
helpless insofar as maneuvering his mount was concerned.</p>
<a id="pic5" name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0600681h-images/TarzanLordOfTheJungle-05.gif" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">As they met Blake reined his horse suddenly.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Malud, overbalanced, lost the force and changed the direction of
his blow, which fell, much to the knight's surprise, upon Blake's
blade along which it spent its force and was deflected from its
target.</p>

<p>Instantly, his horse well in hand by reason that his left arm
was unencumbered by a buckler, Blake reined in and simultaneously
cut to the left and rear, his point opening the mail on Malud's
left shoulder and biting into the flesh before the latter's horse
had carried him out of reach.</p>

<p>A loud shout of approbation arose from the stands for the thing
had been neatly done and then Malud's second spurred to the
Prince's loge and entered a protest.</p>

<p>"Sir James hath no buckler!" he cried. "'Tis no fair
combat!"</p>

<p>"'Tis fairer for thy knight than for Sir James," said
Gobred.</p>

<p>"We would not take that advantage of him," parried Malud's
second, Sir Jarred.</p>

<p>"What sayest thou?" demanded Gobred of Sir Richard who had
quickly ridden to Jarred's side. "Is Sir James without a buckler
through some accident that befell before he entered the lists?"</p>

<p>"Nay, he cast it aside," replied Richard, "and averred that the
'damned thing' did annoy him; but if Sir Jarred feeleth that,
because of this, they be not fairly matched we are willing; if Sir
Malud, also, should cast aside his buckler."</p>

<p>Gobred smiled. "That be fair," he said.</p>

<p>The two men, concerned with their encounter and not with the
argument of their seconds, had engaged once more. Blood was showing
upon Malud's shoulder and trickling down his back, staining his
skirts and the housing of his charger.</p>

<p>The stand was in an uproar, for many were still shouting aloud
about the buckler and others were screaming with delight over the
neat manner in which Sir James had drawn his first blood. Wagers
were being freely made, and though Sir Malud still ruled favorite
in the betting, the odds against Blake were not so great, and while
men had no money to wager they had jewels and arms and horses. One
enthusiastic adherent of Sir Malud bet three chargers against one
that his champion would be victorious and the words were scarce out
of his mouth ere he had a dozen takers, whereas before the opening
passage at arms offers as high as ten to one had found no
takers.</p>

<p>Now the smile was gone from Malud's lips and he glanced no more
at the grandstand. There was rage in his eyes as he spurred again
toward Blake, who he thought had profited by a lucky accident.</p>

<p>Unhampered by a buckler Blake took full advantage of the
nimbleness of the wiry horse he rode and which he had ridden daily
since his arrival in Nimmr, so that man and beast were well
accustomed to one another.</p>

<p>Again Sir Malud saw his blade glance harmlessly from the sword
of his antagonist and then, to his vast surprise, the point of Sir
James' blade leaped quickly beneath his buckler and entered his
side. It was not a deep wound, but it was painful and again it
brought blood.</p>

<p>Angrily Malud struck again, but Blake had reined his charger
quickly to the rear and before Malud could gather his reins Blake
had struck him again, this time a heavy blow upon the helm.</p>

<p>Half stunned and wholly infuriated Malud wheeled and charged at
full tilt, once again determined to ride his adversary down. They
met with a crash directly in front of Gobred's loge, there was a
quick play of swords that baffled the eyesight of the onlookers and
then, to the astonishment of all, most particularly Malud, that
noble sir knight's sword flew from his grasp and hurtled to the
field, leaving him entirely to the mercy of his foe.</p>

<p>Malud reined in and sat erect, waiting. He knew and Blake knew
that under the rules that governed their encounter Blake was
warranted in running him through unless Malud sued for mercy, and
no one, Blake least of all, expected this of so proud and haughty a
knight.</p>

<p>Sir Malud sat proudly on his charger waiting for Blake to
advance and kill him. Utter silence had fallen upon the stands, so
that the champing of Malud's horse upon its bit was plainly
audible. Blake turned to Sir Jarred.</p>

<p>"Summon a squire, sir knight," he said, "to return Sir Malud's
sword to him."</p>

<p>Again the stands rocked to the applause, but Blake turned his
back upon them and rode to Richard's side to wait until his
adversary was again armed.</p>

<p>"Well, old top," he inquired of Sir Richard, "just how much a
dozen am I offered for bucklers now?"</p>

<p>Richard laughed. "Thou hast been passing fortunate, James," he
replied; "but methinks a good swordsman would long since have cut
thee through."</p>

<p>"I know Malud would have if I had packed that chopping bowl
along on the party," Blake assured him, though it is doubtful if
Sir Richard understood what he was talking about, as was so often
the case when Blake discoursed that Richard had long since ceased
to even speculate as to the meaning of much that his friend
said.</p>

<p>But now Sir Malud was rearmed and riding toward Blake. He
stopped his horse before the American and bowed low. "I do my
devoirs to a noble and generous knight," he said, graciously.</p>

<p>Blake bowed. "Are you ready sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Malud nodded.</p>

<p>"On guard, then!" snapped the American.</p>

<p>For a moment the two jockeyed for position. Blake feinted and
Malud raised his buckler before his face to catch the blow, but as
it did not fall he lowered his shield, just as Blake had known that
he would, and as he did so the edge of the American's weapon fell
heavily upon the crown of his bassinet.</p>

<p>Malud's arm dropped at his side, he slumped in his saddle and
then toppled forward and rolled to the ground. Agile, even in his
heavy armor, Blake dismounted and walked to where his foe lay
stretched upon his back almost in front of Gobred's loge. He placed
a foot upon Malud's breast and pressed the point of his sword
against his throat.</p>

<p>The crowd leaned forward to see the coup-de-grace administered,
but Blake did not drive his point home. He looked up at Prince
Gobred and addressed him.</p>

<p>"Here is a brave knight," he said, "with whom I have no real
quarrel. I spare him to your service, Prince, and to those who love
him," and his eyes went straight to the eyes of the Princess
Guinalda. Then he turned and walked back along the front of the
grandstand to his own tilt, while Richard rode behind him, and the
knights and the ladies, the men-at-arms, the freedmen and the serfs
stood upon their seats and shouted their applause.</p>

<p>Edward was beside himself with joy, as was Michel. The former
knelt and embraced Blake's legs, he kissed his hand, and wept, so
great were his happiness and his excitement.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" he cried. "Did I not tell thee, Michel,
that my own sir knight would overthrow Sir Malud?"</p>

<p>The men-at-arms, the trumpeter and the grooms at Blake's tilt
wore grins that stretched from ear to ear. Whereas a few minutes
before they had felt ashamed to have been detailed to the losing
side, now they were most proud and looked upon Blake as the
greatest hero of Nimmr. Great would be their boasting among their
fellows as they gathered with their flagons of ale about the rough
deal table in their dining hall.</p>

<p>Edward removed Blake's armor and Michel got Richard out of his
amidst much babbling upon the part of the youths who could not
contain themselves, so doubly great was their joy because so
unexpected.</p>

<p>Blake went directly to his quarters and Richard accompanied him,
and when the two men were alone Richard placed a hand upon Blake's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thou hast done a noble and chivalrous thing, my friend," he
said, "but I know not that it is a wise one."</p>

<p>"And why?" demanded Blake. "You didn't think I could stick the
poor mutt when he was lying there defenseless?"</p>

<p>Richard shook his head. "'Tis but what he would have done for
thee had thy positions been reversed," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't do it. We're not taught to believe that it is
exactly ethical to hit a fellow when he's down, where I come from,"
explained Blake.</p>

<p>"Had your quarrel been no deeper than appeared upon the surface
thou mightest well have been thus magnanimous; but Malud is jealous
of thee and that jealousy will be by no means lessened by what hath
transpired this day. Thou mightest have been rid of a powerful and
dangerous enemy hadst thou given him the coup-de-grace, as was thy
right; but now thou hast raised up a greater enemy since to his
jealousy is added hatred and envy against thee for thy prowess over
him. Thou didst make him appear like a monkey, James, and that Sir
Malud will never forgive an I know the man."</p>

<p><br>THE knights and ladies attached to the castle of Gobred ate
together at a great table in the huge hall of the castle. Three
hundred people could be accommodated at the single board and it
took quite a company of serving men to fill their needs. Whole
pigs, roasted, were carried in upon great trenchers and there were
legs of mutton and sides of venison and bowls of vegetables, with
wine and ale, and at the end immense puddings.</p>

<p>There was much laughter and loud talking, and it all presented a
wild and fascinating picture to Sir James Blake as he sat at the
lower end of the table far below the salt that night, in his
accustomed place as one of the latest neophytes in the noble ranks
of the knighthood of Nimmr.</p>

<p>The encounter between himself and Malud was the subject of the
moment and many were the compliments bestowed upon him and many the
questions as to where and how he had acquired his strange technique
of swordsmanship. Although they had seen him accomplish it, yet
they still appeared to believe it inconceivable that a man might
prevail without a buckler over one who carried this essential
article of defense.</p>

<p>Prince Gobred and his family sat, with the higher nobles of
Nimmr, at a table slightly raised above the rest of the board and
running across its upper end, the whole forming a huge T. When he
wished to speak to anyone farther down the table he resorted to the
simple expedient of raising his voice, so that if several were so
inclined at the same time the room became a bedlam of uproar and
confusion.</p>

<p>And as Blake sat at the farthest end of the table it was
necessary for one at Gobred's end to scream to attract attention,
though when it was discovered that it was the prince who was
speaking the rest of the company usually lapsed into silence out of
respect for him, unless they were too far gone in drink.</p>

<p>Shortly after the feasters were seated Gobred had arisen and
lifted his goblet high in air, and silence had fallen upon the
whole company as knights and ladies rose and faced their
prince.</p>

<p>"Hail to our King!" cried Gobred. "Hail to our liege lord,
Richard of England!"</p>

<p>And in a great chorus rose the answering "Hail!" as the company
drank the health of Richard Coeur de Lion seven hundred and
twenty-eight years after his death!</p>

<p>Then they drank the health of Gobred and of the Princess
Brynilda, his wife, and of the Princess Guinalda, and each time a
voice boomed from just below the dais of the prince: "Here I am
looking at thee!" as Sir Richard with a proud smile displayed his
newly acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>Again Prince Gobred arose. "Hail!" he cried, "to that worthy sir
knight who hath most nobly and chivalrously acquitted himself in
the lists this day! Hail to Sir James, Knight Templar and, now,
Knight of Nimmr!"</p>

<p>Not even the name of Richard I of England had aroused the
enthusiasm that followed the drinking to Sir James. The length of
the long hall Blake's eyes traveled straight to where Guinalda
stood: He saw her drink to him and he saw that her eyes were
regarding him, but the distance was too great and the light of the
pitch torches and the oil cressets too dim for him to see whether
her glance carried a message of friendship or dislike.</p>

<p>When the noise had partially subsided and the drinkers had
retaken their seats Blake arose.</p>

<p>"Prince Gobred," he called the length of the room, "knights and
ladies of Nimmr, I give you another toast! To Sir Malud!"</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, the silence of surprise, and
then the company arose and drank the health of the absent Sir
Malud.</p>

<p>"Thou art a strange sir knight, with strange words upon thy lips
and strange ways, Sir James," shouted Gobred, "but though thou
callest a hail 'a toast' and thy friends be 'old top' and 'kid,'
yet withal it seemeth that we understand thee and we would know
more about thy country and the ways of the noble knights that do
abide there.</p>

<p>"Tell us, are they all thus chivalrous and magnanimous to their
fallen foes?"</p>

<p>"If they're not they get the raspberry," explained Blake.</p>

<p>"'Get the raspberry'!" repeated Gobred. "'Tis some form of
punishment, methinks."</p>

<p>"You said it, Prince!"</p>

<p>"Of a surety I said it, Sir James!" snapped Gobred with
asperity.</p>

<p>"I mean, Prince, that you hit the nail on the head&mdash;you
guessed it the first time. You see the raspberry is about the only
form of punishment that the Knights of the Squared Circle, or the
Knights of the Diamond can understand."</p>

<p>"Knights of the Squared Circle! Knights of the Diamond! Those
are knightly orders of which I wot not. Be they doughty
knights?"</p>

<p>"Some of them are dotty, but a lot of them are regulars. Take
Sir Dempsey, for instance, a knight of the Squared Circle. He
showed 'em all he was a regular knight in defeat, which is much
more difficult than being a regular knight in victory."</p>

<p>"Be there other orders of knighthood these days?" demanded
Gobred.</p>

<p>"We're lousy with them!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Gobred.</p>

<p>"We're all knights these days," explained Blake.</p>

<p>"All knights! Be there no serfs nor yeomen? 'Tis
incredible!"</p>

<p>"Well, there are some yeomen in the navy, I think; but all the
rest of us, pretty much, are knights. You see things have changed a
lot since the days of Richard. The people have sort of overthrown
the old order of things. They poked a lot of ridicule at knights
and wanted to get rid of knighthood, and as soon as they had they
all wanted to be knights themselves; so we have Knights Templar now
and Knights of Pythias and Knights of Columbus and Knights of Labor
and a lot more I can't recall."</p>

<p>"Methinks it must be a fine and noble world," cried Gobred, "for
what with so many noble sir knights it would seem that they must
often contend, one against another&mdash;is that not true?"</p>

<p>"Well, they do scrap some," Blake admitted.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE LONELY GRAVE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WITHIN the dark interior of the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> Stimbol could see nothing. Just before him
he heard a man breathing heavily as might one in a troubled sleep.
The would-be murderer paused to steady his nerves. Then, on hands
and knees, he crept forward inch by inch.</p>

<p>Presently one of his hands touched the prostrate figure of the
sleeper. Lightly, cautiously, Stimbol groped until he had
definitely discovered the position in which his victim lay. In one
hand, ready, he grasped the keen knife. He scarce dared breathe for
fear he might awaken the ape-man. He prayed that Tarzan was a sound
sleeper, and he prayed that the first blow of his weapon would
reach that savage heart.</p>

<p>Now he was ready! He had located the exact spot where he must
strike! He raised his knife and struck. His victim shuddered
spasmodically. Again and again with savage maniacal force and speed
the knife was plunged into the soft flesh. Stimbol felt the warm
blood spurt out upon his hand and wrist.</p>

<p>At length, satisfied that his mission had been accomplished, he
scurried from the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>. Now he was
trembling so that he could scarcely stand&mdash;terrified, revolted
by the horrid crime he had committed.</p>

<p>Wild-eyed, haggard, he stumbled to the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of Ibn Jad's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and there he
collapsed. The sheikh stepped from the women's quarters and looked
down upon the trembling figure that the dim light of a paper
lantern revealed.</p>

<p>"What doest thou here, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have done it, Ibn Jad!" muttered Stimbol.</p>

<p>"Done what?" cried the sheikh.</p>

<p>"Slain Tarzan of the Apes."</p>

<p>"Ai! Ai!" screamed Ibn Jad. "Tollog! Where art thou? Hirfa!
Ateja! Come! Didst hear what the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> sayeth?"</p>

<p>Hirfa and Ateja rushed into the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>.</p>

<p>"Didst hear him?" repeated Ibn Jad. "He hath slain my good
friend the great sheikh of the Jungle, Motlog! Fahd! Haste!" His
voice had been rising until now he was screaming at the top of his
lungs and Arabs were streaming toward his <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> from all directions.</p>

<p>Stimbol, stunned by what he had done, dumb from surprise and
terror at the unexpected attitude of Ibn Jad, crouched speechless
in the center of the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>.</p>

<p>"Seize him!" cried the sheikh to the first man that arrived. "He
hath slain Tarzan of the Apes, our great friend, who was to
preserve us and lead us from this land of dangers. Now all will be
our enemies. The friends of Tarzan will fall upon us and slay us.
Allah, bear witness that I am free from guilt in this matter and
let Thy wrath and the wrath of the friends of Tarzan fall upon this
guilty man!"</p>

<p>By this time the entire population of the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> was
gathered in front of the sheikh's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>,
and if they were surprised by his protestations of sudden affection
for Tarzan they gave no evidence of it.</p>

<p>"Take him away!" commanded Ibn Jad. "In the morning we shall
gather and decide what we must do."</p>

<p>They dragged the terrified Stimbol to Fahd's <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a>, where they bound him hand and foot and left
him for Fahd to guard. When they had gone the Beduin leaned low
over Stimbol, and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>"Didst really slay the jungle sheikh?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Ibn Jad forced me to do so and now he turns against me,"
whispered Stimbol.</p>

<p>"And tomorrow he will have you killed so that he may tell the
friends of Tarzan that he hath punished the slayer of Tarzan," said
Fahd.</p>

<p>"Save me, Fahd!" begged Stimbol. "Save me and I will give you
twenty million francs&mdash;I swear it! Once I am safe in the
nearest European colony I will get the money for you. Think of it,
Fahd&mdash;twenty million francs!"</p>

<p>"I am thinking of it, <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," replied the Beduin, "and
I think that thou liest. There be not that much money in the
world!"</p>

<p>"I swear that I have ten times that amount. If I have lied to
you you may kill me. Save me! Save me!"</p>

<p>"Twenty million francs!" murmured Fahd. "Perchance he does not
lie! Listen, <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>. I do
not know that I can save thee, but I shall try, and if I succeed
and thou forgettest the twenty million francs I shall kill thee if
I have to follow thee across the world&mdash;dost understand?"</p>

<p><br>IBN Jad called two ignorant slaves to him and commanded them to
go to the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> that had been Zeyd's and
carry Tarzan's body to the edge of the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
where they were to dig a grave and bury it.</p>

<p>With paper lanterns they went to the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of death and wrapping the dead man in the
old burnoose that already covered him they carried him across the
<a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> and
laid him down while they dug a shallow grave; and so, beneath a
forest giant in the land that he loved the grave of Tarzan of the
Apes was made.</p>

<p>Roughly the slaves rolled the corpse into the hole they had
made, shoveled the dirt upon it and left it in its lonely, unmarked
tomb.</p>

<p><br>EARLY the next morning Ibn Jad called about him the elders of
the tribe, and when they were gathered it was noted that Tollog was
missing, and though a search was made he could not be found. Fahd
suggested that he had gone forth early to hunt.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad explained to them that if they were to escape the wrath
of the friends of Tarzan they must take immediate steps to disprove
their responsibility for the slaying of the ape-man and that they
might only do this and express their good faith by punishing the
murderer.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to persuade them to take the life of a
Christian and there was only one that demurred. This was Fahd.</p>

<p>"There are two reasons, Ibn Jad, why we should not take the life
of this <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>," he
said.</p>

<p>"By Allah, there never be any reason why a true believer should
not take the life of a <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>!" cried one of the old
men.</p>

<p>"Listen," admonished Fahd, "to what I have in mind and then I am
sure that you will agree that I am right."</p>

<p>"Speak, Fahd," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"This <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> is a rich
and powerful man in his own <a title="village"><i>beled</i></a>. If
it be possible to spare his life he will command a great
ransom&mdash;dead he is worth nothing to us. If by chance, the
friends of Tarzan do not learn of his death before we are safely
out of this accursed land it will have profited us naught to have
killed Stimbol and, <a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, if we
kill him now they may not believe us when we say that he slew
Tarzan and we took his life in punishment.</p>

<p>"But if we keep him alive until we are met with the friends of
Tarzan, should it so befall that they overtake us, then we may say
that we did hold him prisoner that Tarzan's own people might mete
out their vengeance to him, which would suit them better."</p>

<p>"Thy words are not without wisdom," admitted Ibn Jad, "but
suppose the <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> spoke
lies concerning us and said that it was we who slew Tarzan? Would
they not believe him above us?"</p>

<p>"That be easily prevented," said the old man who had spoken
before. "Let us cut his tongue out forthwith that he may not bear
false witness against us."</p>

<p>"<a title="By God! By Allah!"><i>W'Allah</i></a>, thou hast it!"
exclaimed Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, nay!" cried Fahd. "The
better we treat him the larger will be the reward that he will pay
us."</p>

<p>"We can wait until the last moment," said Ibn Jad, "an we see
that we are to lose him and our reward, then may we cut out his
tongue."</p>

<p>Thus the fate of Wilbur Stimbol was left to the gods, and Ibn
Jad, temporarily freed from the menace of Tarzan, turned his
attention once more to his plans for entering the valley. With a
strong party he went in person and sought a palaver with the Galla
chief.</p>

<p>As he approached the village of Batando he passed through the
camps of thousands of Galla warriors and realized fully what he had
previously sensed but vaguely&mdash;that his position was most
precarious and that with the best grace possible he must agree to
whatever terms the old chief might propose.</p>

<p>Batando received him graciously enough, though with all the
majesty of a powerful monarch, and assured him that on the
following day he would escort him to the entrance to the valley,
but that first he must deliver to Batando all the Galla slaves that
were with his party.</p>

<p>"But that will leave us without carriers or servants and will
greatly weaken the strength of my party," cried Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>Batando but shrugged his black shoulders.</p>

<p>"Let them remain with us until we have returned from the
valley," implored the sheikh.</p>

<p>"No Galla man may accompany you," said Batando with
finality.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the tent of Ibn Jad was struck in signal
that all were to prepare for the <a title=
"journey, trek, expedition"><i>rahla</i></a>, and entirely
surrounded by Galla warriors they started toward the rugged
mountains where lay the entrance to the valley of Ibn Jad's
dreams.</p>

<p>Fejjuan and the other Galla slaves that the Arabs had brought
with them from Beled el-Guad marched with their own people, happy
in their new-found freedom. Stimbol, friendless, fearful, utterly
cowed, trudged wearily along under guard of two young Beduins, his
mind constantly reverting to the horror of the murdered man lying
in his lonely grave behind them.</p>

<p>Winding steadily upward along what at times appeared to be an
ancient trail and again no trail at all, the Arabs and their escort
climbed higher and higher into the rugged mountains that rim the
Valley of the Sepulcher upon the north. At the close of the second
day, after they had made camp beside a rocky mountain brook,
Batando came to Ibn Jad and pointed to the entrance to a rocky side
ravine that branched from the main canyon directly opposite the
camp.</p>

<p>"There," he said, "lies the trail into the valley. Here we leave
you and return to our villages. Upon the morrow we go."</p>

<p><br>WHEN the sun rose the following morning Ibn Jad discovered that
the Gallas had departed during the night, but he did not know it
was because of the terror they felt for the inhabitants of the
mysterious valley from which no Galla ever had returned.</p>

<p>That day Ibn Jad spent in making a secure camp in which to leave
the women and children until the warriors had returned from their
adventure in the valley or had discovered that they might safely
fetch their women, and the next morning, leaving a few old men and
boys to protect the camp, he set forth with those who were
accounted the fighting men among them, and presently the watchers
in the camp saw the last of them disappear in the rocky ravine that
lay opposite the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE GREAT TOURNEY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">KING BOHUN with many knights and squires and
serving men had ridden down from his castle above the City of the
Sepulcher two days ago to take his way across the valley to the
field before the city of Nimmr for the Great Tourney that is held
once each year, commencing upon the first Sunday in Lent.</p>

<p>Gay pennons fluttered from a thousand lance tips and gay with
color were the housings of the richly caparisoned chargers that
proudly bore the Knights of the Sepulcher upon whose backs red
crosses were emblazoned to denote that they had completed the
pilgrimage to the Holy Land and were returning to home and
England.</p>

<p>Their bassinets, unlike those of the Knights of Nimmr, were
covered with bullock hide, and the devices upon their bucklers
differed, and their colors. But for these and the crosses upon
their backs they might have been Gobred's own good knights and
true.</p>

<p>Sturdy sumpter beasts, almost as richly trapped as the knight's
steeds, bore the marquees and tilts that were to house the knights
during the tourney, as well as their personal belongings, their
extra arms and their provisions for the three days of the tourney;
for custom, over seven centuries old, forbade the Knights of Nimmr
and the Knights of the Sepulcher breaking bread together.</p>

<p>The Great Tourney was merely a truce during which they carried
on their ancient warfare under special rules which transformed it
into a gorgeous pageant and an exhibition of martial prowess which
noncombatants might witness in comfort and with impunity. It did
not permit friendly intercourse between the two factions as this
was not compatible with the seriousness of the event, in which
knights of both sides often were killed, or the spirit in which the
grand prize was awarded.</p>

<p>This prize as much as any other factor had kept open the breach
of seven and a half centuries' duration that separated the Fronters
from the Backers, for it consisted of five maidens whom the winners
took back with them to their own city and who were never again seen
by their friends or relatives.</p>

<p>Though the sorrow was mitigated by the honorable treatment that
custom and the laws of knighthood decreed should be accorded these
unfortunate maidens, it was still bitter because attached to it was
the sting of defeat.</p>

<p>Following the tournament the maidens became the especial charges
of Gobred or Bohun, dependent of course upon whether the honors of
the tourney had fallen to the Fronters or the Backers, and in due
course were given in honorable marriage to knights of the
victorious party.</p>

<p>The genesis of the custom, which was now fully seven centuries
old, doubtless lay in the wise desire of some ancient Gobred or
Bohun to maintain the stock of both factions strong and virile by
the regular infusion of new blood, as well, perhaps, as to prevent
the inhabitants of the two cities from drifting too far apart in
manners, customs and speech.</p>

<p>Many a happy wife of Nimmr had been born in the City of the
Sepulcher and seldom was it that the girls themselves repined for
long. It was considered an honor to be chosen and there were always
many more who volunteered than the requisite number of five that
annually made the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The five who constituted the prize offered by the City of the
Sepulcher this year rode on white palfreys and were attended by a
guard of honor in silver mail. The girls, selected for their beauty
to thus honor the city of their birth, were gorgeously attired and
weighed down with ornaments of gold and silver and precious
stones.</p>

<p>Upon the plain before the city of Nimmr preparations for the
tourney had been in progress for many days. The lists were being
dragged and rolled with heavy wooden rollers, the ancient stands of
stone from which the spectators viewed the spectacle were
undergoing their annual repairs and cleansing, a frame
superstructure was being raised to support the canopies that would
shade the choice seats reserved for the nobility, and staffs for a
thousand pennons had been set round the outer margin of the
lists&mdash;these and a hundred other things were occupying a
company of workmen; and in the walled city and in the castle that
stood above it the hammers of armorers and smiths rang far into the
night forging iron shoes and mail and lance tips.</p>

<p>Blake had been assured that he was to have a part in the Great
Tourney and was as keen for it as he had been for the big game of
the season during his football days at college. He had been entered
in two sword contests&mdash;one in which five Knights of Nimmr met
five Knights of the Sepulcher and another in which he was pitted
against a single antagonist, but his only contest with the lance
was to be in the grand finale when a hundred Fronters faced a
hundred Backers, since, whereas, before his encounter with Malud he
had been considered hopeless with sword and buckler now Prince
Gobred looked to him to win many points with these, his lance work
being held but mediocre.</p>

<p>King Bohun and his followers were camped in a grove of oaks
about a mile north of the lists, nor did the laws governing the
Great Tourney permit them to come nearer until the hour appointed
for their entrance upon the first day of the spectacle.</p>

<p>Blake, in preparing for the tourney, had followed the custom
adopted by many of the knights of wearing distinctive armor and
trapping his charger similarly. His chain mail was all of solid
black, relieved only by the leopard skin of his bassinet and the
blue and silver pennon upon his lance. The housings of his mount
were of black, edged with silver and blue, and there were, of
course, the prescribed red crosses upon his breast and upon his
horse housings.</p>

<p>As he came from his quarters upon the opening morning of the
tourney, followed by Edward bearing his lance and buckler, he
appeared a somber figure among the resplendently caparisoned
knights and the gorgeously dressed women that were gathered in the
great court awaiting the word to mount their horses which were
being held in the north ballium by the grooms.</p>

<p>That his black mail was distinctive was evidenced by the
attention he immediately attracted, and that he had quickly become
popular among the knights and ladies of Nimmr was equally apparent
by the manner in which they clustered about him, but opinion was
divided in the matter of his costume, some holding that it was too
dismal and depressing.</p>

<p>Guinalda was there but she remained seated upon a bench where
she was conversing with one of the maidens that had been chosen as
Nimmr's prize. Blake quickly disengaged himself from those who had
crowded about him and crossed the court to where Guinalda sat. At
his approach the princess looked up and inclined her head slightly
in recognition of his bow and then she resumed her conversation
with the maiden.</p>

<p>The rebuff was too obvious to permit of misunderstanding, but
Blake was not satisfied to accept it and go his way without an
explanation. He could scarce believe, however, that the princess
was still vexed merely because he had intimated that he had
believed that she took a greater interest in him than she had
admitted. There must be some other reason.</p>

<p>He did not turn and walk away, then, although she continued to
ignore him, but stood quietly before her waiting patiently until
she should again notice him.</p>

<p>Presently he noted that she was becoming nervous as was also the
maiden with whom she spoke. There were lapses in their
conversation; one of Guinalda's feet was tapping the flagging
irritably; a slow flush was creeping upward into her cheeks. The
maiden fidgeted, she plucked at the ends of the wimple that lay
about her shoulders, she smoothed the rich cyclas of her mantle and
finally she arose and bowing before the princess asked if she might
go and bid farewell to her mother.</p>

<p>Guinalda bade her begone and then, alone with Blake and no
longer able to ignore him, nor caring to, she turned angrily upon
him.</p>

<p>"I was right!" she snapped. "Thou art a forward boor. Why
standest thou thus staring at me when I have made it plain that I
would not be annoyed by thee? Go!"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" Blake hesitated, "because I love you."</p>

<p>"Sirrah!" cried Guinalda, springing to her feet. "How darest
thou!"</p>

<p>"I would dare anything for you, my princess," replied Blake,
"because I love you."</p>

<p>Guinalda looked straight at him for a moment in silence, then
her short upper lip curved in a contemptuous sneer.</p>

<p>"Thou liest!" she said. "I have heard what thou hast said
concerning me!" and without waiting for a reply she brushed past
him and walked away.</p>

<p>Blake hurried after her. "What have I said about you?" he
demanded. "I have said nothing that I would not repeat before all
Nimmr. Not even have I presumed to tell my best friend, Sir
Richard, that I love you. No other ears than yours have heard
that."</p>

<p>"I have heard differently," said Guinalda, haughtily, "and I
care not to discuss the matter further."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" commenced Blake, but at that instant a trumpet
sounded from the north gate leading into the ballium. It was the
signal for the knights to mount. Guinalda's page came running to
her to summon her to her father's side. Sir Richard appeared and
seized Blake by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come, James!" he cried. "We should have been mounted before now
for we ride in the forerank of the knights today." And so Blake was
dragged away from the princess before he could obtain an
explanation of her, to him, inexplicable attitude.</p>

<p>The north ballium presented a scene of color and activity,
crowded as it was with knights and ladies, pages, squires, grooms,
men-at-arms and horses, nor would it accommodate them all, so that
the overflow stretched into the east and south balliums and even
through the great east gate out upon the road that leads down into
the valley.</p>

<p>For half an hour something very like chaos reigned about the
castle of the Prince of Nimmr, but eventually perspiring marshals
and shouting heralds whipped the cortege into shape as it took its
slow and imposing way down the winding mountain road toward the
lists.</p>

<p>First rode the marshals and heralds and behind them a score of
trumpeters; then came Prince Gobred, riding alone, and following
was a great company of knights, their colored pennons streaming in
the wind. They rode just before the ladies and behind the ladies
was another company of knights, while in the rear marched company
after company of men-at-arms, some armed with cross bows, others
with pikes and still others again with battle-axes of huge
proportions.</p>

<p>Perhaps a hundred knights and men-at-arms all told were left
behind to guard the castle and the entrance to the Valley of the
Sepulcher, but these would be relieved to witness the second and
third days' exercises.</p>

<p>As the Knights of Nimmr wound down to the lists, the Knights of
the Sepulcher moved out from their camp among the oaks, and the
marshals of the two parties timed their approach so that both
entered the lists at the same time.</p>

<p>The ladies of Nimmr dropped out of the procession and took their
places in the stand; the five maidens of Nimmr and the five from
the City of the Sepulcher were escorted to a dais at one end of the
lists, after which the knights lined up in solid ranks, the Knights
of Nimmr upon the south side of the lists, the Knights of the
Sepulcher upon the north.</p>

<p>Gobred and Bohun rode forward and met in the center of the
field, where, in measured and imposing tones, Bohun delivered the
ancient challenge prescribed by custom and the laws of the Great
Tourney and handed Gobred the gage, the acceptance of which
constituted an acceptance of the challenge and marked the official
opening of the tourney.</p>

<p>As Gobred and Bohun reined about and faced their own knights
these rode out of the lists, those who were not to take part in the
encounters of the day seeking places in the stands after turning
their chargers over to grooms, while those who were to participate
formed again to ride once around the lists, for the double purpose
of indicating to their opponents and the spectators the entrants
for that day and of viewing the prizes offered by their
opponents.</p>

<p>In addition to the maidens there were many minor prizes
consisting of jeweled ornaments, suits of mail, lances, swords,
bucklers, splendid steeds and the many articles that were valued by
knights or that might find favor in the eyes of their ladies.</p>

<p>The Knights of the Sepulcher paraded first, with Bohun at their
head, and it was noticeable that the eyes of the king were often
upon the women in the stands as he rode past. Bohun was a young
man, having but just ascended the throne following the recent death
of his father. He was arrogant and tyrannical and it had been
common knowledge in Nimmr that for years he had been at the head of
a faction that was strong for war with Nimmr, that the city might
be reduced and the entire Valley of the Sepulcher brought under the
rule of the Bohuns.</p>

<p>His charger prancing, his colors flying, his great company of
knights at his back, King Bohun rode along the stands reserved for
the people of Nimmr, and when he came to the central loge in which
sat Prince Gobred with the Princess Brynilda and Princess Guinalda,
his eyes fell upon the face of the daughter of Gobred.</p>

<p>Bohun reined in his charger and stared straight into the face of
Guinalda. Gobred flushed angrily, for Bohun's act was a breach of
courtesy, and half rose from his seat, but at that moment Bohun,
bowing low across his mount's withers, moved on, followed by his
knights.</p>

<p>That day the honors went to the Knights of the Sepulcher, far
they scored two hundred and twenty seven points against one hundred
and six that the Knights of Nimmr were able to procure.</p>

<p>Upon the second day the tourney opened with the riding past of
the entrants who, ordinarily, were conducted by a herald, but to
the surprise of all, Bohun again led his knights past the stands
and again he paused and looked full at the Princess Guinalda.</p>

<p>This day the Knights of Nimmr fared a little better, being for
the day but seven points behind their opponents, though the score
for the two days stood two hundred and sixty nine to three hundred
and ninety seven in favor of the Knights of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>So the third day opened with the knights from the north boasting
what seemed an insuperable lead of one hundred and twenty eight
points and the Knights of Nimmr spurred to greater action by the
knowledge that to win the tourney they must score two hundred and
thirty two of the remaining three hundred and thirty four
points.</p>

<p>Once again, contrary to age old custom, Bohun led his entrants
about the lists as they paraded before the opening encounter, and
once again he drew rein before the loge of Gobred and his eye
rested upon the beautiful face of Guinalda for an instant before he
addressed her sire.</p>

<p>"Prince Gobred of Nimmr," he said in his haughty and arrogant
voice, "as thou well knowest, my valiant sir knights have bested
thine by more than six score points and the Great Tourney is as
good as ours already. Yet we would make thee a proposition."</p>

<p>"Speak Bohun! The Great Tourney is yet far from won, but an thou
hast any proposition that an honorable prince may consider, thou
hast my assurance that 'twill be given consideration."</p>

<p>"Thy five maidens are as good as ours," said Bohun, "but give me
thy daughter to be queen of the Valley of the Sepulcher and I will
grant thee the tourney."</p>

<p>Gobred went white with anger, but when he replied his voice was
low and even for he was master of his own emotions, as befitted a
princely man.</p>

<p>"Sir Bohun," he said, refusing to accord to his enemy the title
of king, "thy words are an offense in the ears of honorable men,
implying as they do that the daughter of a Gobred be for sale and
that the honor of the knighthood of Nimmr may be bartered for.</p>

<p>"Get thou hence to thine own side of the lists before I set
serfs upon thee to drive thee there with staves."</p>

<p>"So that is thine answer, eh?" shouted Bohun. "Then know thou
that I shall take the five maidens by the rules of the Great
Tourney and thy daughter by force of arms!" With this threat
delivered he wheeled his steed and spurred away.</p>

<p>Word of Bohun's proposition and his rebuff spread like wild fire
throughout the ranks of the Knights of Nimmr so that those who were
to contend this last day of the tourney were keyed to the highest
pitch of derring-do in the defence of the honor of Nimmr and the
protection of the Princess Guinalda.</p>

<p>The great lead attained by the Knights of the Sepulcher during
the first two days was but an added incentive to greater effort,
provoking them, as a spur, to the utmost limits of daring and
exertion. There was no need that their marshals should exhort them.
The youth and chivalry of Nimmr had heard the challenge and would
answer it in the lists!</p>

<p>Blake's sword and buckler encounter with a Knight of the
Sepulcher was scheduled for the first event of the day. When the
lists were cleared he rode in to a fanfare of trumpets, moving
parallel with the south stands while his adversary rode along the
front of the north stands, the latter halting before the loge of
Bohun as Blake drew rein in front of that of Gobred, where he
raised the hilt of his sword to his lips to the Prince, though his
eyes were upon Guinalda.</p>

<p>"Conduct thyself as a true knight this day to the glory and
honor of Nimmr," charged Gobred, "and may the blessings of Our Lord
Jesus be upon thee and thy sword, our well beloved Sir James!"</p>

<p>"To the glory and honor of Nimmr I pledge my sword and my life!"
should have been Blake's reply according to the usages of the Great
Tourney.</p>

<p>"To the glory and honor of Nimmr and to the protection of my
Princess I pledge my sword and my life!" is what he said, and it
was evident from the expression on Gobred's face that he was not
displeased, while the look of haughty disdain which had been upon
Guinalda's face softened.</p>

<p>Slowly she arose and tearing a ribbon from her gown stepped to
the front of the loge. "Receive this favor from thy lady, sir
knight," she said, "bearing it with honor and to victory in thine
encounter."</p>

<p>Blake reined closed to the rail of the loge and bent low while
Guinalda pinned the ribbon upon his shoulder. His face was close to
hers; he sensed the intoxicating perfume of her hair; he felt her
warm breath upon his cheek.</p>

<p>"I love you," he whispered, so low that no other ears than hers
could hear.</p>

<p>"Thou art a boor," she replied in a voice as low as his. "It is
for the sake of the five maidens that I encourage thee with this
favor."</p>

<p>Blake looked straight into her eyes. "I love you, Guinalda," he
said, "and&mdash;you love me!"</p>

<p>Before she could reply he had wheeled away, the trumpets had
sounded, and he was cantering slowly toward the end of the field
where the tilts of the Knights of Nimmr stood.</p>

<p>Edward, very much excited, was there and Sir Richard and Michel,
with a marshal, heralds, trumpeters, men-at-arms&mdash;a martial
company to urge him on with encouragement and advice.</p>

<p>Blake cast aside his buckler, nor was there any to reprove him
now. Instead they smiled proudly and knowingly, for had they not
seen him best Sir Malud without other defense than his horsemanship
and his sword?</p>

<p>The trumpets blared again. Blake turned and put spurs to his
charger. Straight down the center of the lists he rode. From the
opposite end came a Knight of the Sepulcher to meet him!</p>

<p>"Sir James! Sir James!" cried the spectators in the stands upon
the south side, while the north stands answered with the name of
their champion.</p>

<p>"Who is the black knight?" asked many a man in the north stands
of his neighbor.</p>

<p>"He hath no buckler!" cried some. "He is mad!"</p>

<p>"Sir Guy will cleave him open at the first pass!"</p>

<p>"Sir Guy! Sir Guy!"</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; "THE SARACENS!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">JUST as the second day of the Great Tourney had
opened in the Valley of the Sepulcher upon the plains below the
city of Nimmr, a band of swart men in soiled <a title=
"ankle-length robe-like garment"><i>thobes</i></a> and carrying
long matchlocks topped the summit of the pass upon the north side
of the valley and looked down upon the City of the Sepulcher and
the castle of King Bohun.</p>

<p>They had followed upward along what may once have been a trail,
but for so long a time had it been unused, or so infrequently had
it been used that it was scarce distinguishable from the
surrounding brush; but below them now Ibn Jad saw at a short
distance a better marked road and, beyond, what appeared to him a
fortress. Beyond that again he glimpsed the battlements of Bohun's
castle.</p>

<p>What he saw in the foreground was the barbican guarding the
approach to the castle and the city, both of which were situated in
much the same relative position as were the barbican and castle
upon the south side of the valley where Prince Gobred guarded the
city of Nimmr and the valley beyond it against the daily expected
assault of the Saracens.</p>

<p>Seeking cover, Ibn Jad and his Beduins crept down toward the
barbican where an old knight and a few men-at-arms kept perfunctory
ward. Hiding in the mountain brush the Arabs saw two strangely
appareled blacks hunting just outside the great gateway. They were
armed with cross bows and arrows and their prey was rabbits. For
years they had seen no stranger come down this ancient road, and
for years they hunted between the gate and the summit of the
mountains, though farther than this they were not permitted to
wander. Nor had they any great desire to do so, for, though they
were descendants of Gallas who lived just beyond this mountain top,
they thought that they were Englishmen and that a horde of Saracens
awaited to annihilate them should they venture too far afield.</p>

<p>Today they hunted as they had often hunted when they chanced to
be placed in the guard at the outer barbican. They moved silently
forward, warily awaiting the break of a rabbit. They did not see
the dark-faced men in the brush.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad saw that the great gateway was open and that the gate
that closed it raised and lowered vertically. It was raised now.
Great was the laxity of the old knight and the men-at-arms, but
King Bohun was away and there was none to reprove them.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad motioned those nearest him to follow and crept slowly
closer to the gateway.</p>

<p>What of the old knight and the other watchers? The former was
partaking of a late breakfast just within one of the great towers
of the barbican and the latter were taking advantage of the laxity
of his discipline to catch a few more winks of sleep as they
stretched beneath the shade of some trees within the ballium.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad won to within a few yards of the gateway and waited for
the others to reach his side. When they were all there he whispered
to them and then trotted on silent sandals toward the gate, his
matchlock ready in his hands. Behind him came his fellows. They
were all within the ballium before the men-at-arms were aware that
there was an enemy this side of Palestine.</p>

<p>With cross bow and battle-axe the men-at-arms sprang to defend
the gate. Their cries of "The Saracens! The Saracens!" brought the
old sir knight and the hunters running toward the ballium.</p>

<p>Below, at the castle of King Bohun, the men at the gates and the
other retainers who had been left while Bohun sallied forth to the
Great Tourney heard strange noises from the direction of the outer
barbican. The shouts of men floated down to them and strange, sharp
sounds that were like thunder and yet unlike it. Such sounds they
had never heard before, nor any of their forbears. They rallied at
the outer castle gate and the knights with them consulted as to
what was best to be done.</p>

<p>Being brave knights there seemed but one thing open for them. If
those at the far outer barbican had been attacked they must hasten
to their defense. Summoning all but four of the knights and
men-at-arms at his disposal the marshal of the castle mounted and
rode forth toward the outer gate.</p>

<p>Halfway there they were espied by Ibn Jad and his men who,
having overcome the poorly armed soldiers at the gate, were
advancing down the road toward the castle. At sight of these
reinforcements Ibn Jad hastened to secrete his followers and
himself in the bushes that lined the roadway. So it fell that the
marshal rode by them and did not see them and, when they had
passed, Ibn Jad and his followers came out of the bushes and
continued down the winding mountain road toward the castle of King
Bohun.</p>

<p>The men at the castle gate, now fully upon the alert, stood
ready with the portcullis raised as the marshal instructed them, so
that in the event that those who had ridden out should be hard
pressed upon their return by an enemy at their rear they could
still find sanctuary within the ballium. The plan was, in such
event, to lower the portcullis behind the men of the Sepulcher and
in the faces of the pursuing Saracens, for that an enemy must be
such was a foregone conclusion&mdash;had not they and their
ancestors waited for near seven and a half centuries now for this
momentarily expected assault? They wondered if it really had come
at last.</p>

<p>While they discussed the question Ibn Jad watched them from a
concealing clump of bushes a few yards away.</p>

<p>The wily Beduin knew the purpose of that portcullis and he was
trying to plan best how he might enter the enclosure beyond before
it could be dropped before his face. At last he found a plan and
smiled. He beckoned three men to come close and into their ears he
whispered that which he had in mind.</p>

<p>There were four men-at-arms ready to drop the portcullis at the
psychological moment and all four of them stood in plain sight of
Ibn Jad and the three that were beside him. Carefully, cautiously,
noiselessly the four Arabs raised their ancient matchlocks and took
careful aim.</p>

<p>"Now!" whispered Ibn Jad and four matchlocks belched forth flame
and black powder and slugs of lead.</p>

<p>The four men-at-arms dropped to the stone flagging and Ibn Jad
and all his followers raced forward and stood within the ballium of
the castle of King Bohun. Before them, across the ballium, was
another gate and a broad moat, but the drawbridge was lowered, the
portcullis raised and the gateway unguarded.</p>

<p>The marshal and his followers had ridden unhindered into the
ballium of the outer barbican and there they had found all its
defenders lying in their own blood, even to the little squire of
the old knight who should have watched the gate and did not.</p>

<p>One of the men-at-arms still lived and in his dying breath he
gasped the terrible truth. The Saracens had come at last!</p>

<p>"Where are they?" demanded the marshal.</p>

<p>"Didst thou not see them, sir?" asked the dying man. "They
marched down the road toward the castle."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the marshal. "We did but ride along that
very road and saw no one."</p>

<p>"They marched down toward the castle," gasped the man.</p>

<p>The marshal knit his brows. "Were there many?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"There are few," replied the man-at-arms. "It was but the
advance guard of the armies of the sultan."</p>

<p>Just then the volley that laid low the four warders at the
castle gate crashed upon the ears of the marshal and his men.</p>

<p>"'Ods blood!" he cried.</p>

<p>"They must have hid themselves in the bush as we passed,"
exclaimed a knight at the marshal's side, "for of a surety they are
there and we are here and there is but one road between!"</p>

<p>"There are but four men at the castle gate," said the marshal,
"and I did bid them keep the 'cullis up till we returned. God pity
me! I have given over the Sepulcher to the Saracens. Slay me, Sir
Morley!"</p>

<p>"Nay, man! We need every lance and sword and crossbow that we
may command. This is no time to think of taking thy life when thou
canst give it to Our Lord Jesus in defense of His Sepulcher against
the infidels!"</p>

<p>"Thou art right, Morley," cried the marshal. "Remain thou here,
then, with six men and hold this gate. I shall return with the
others and give battle at the castle!"</p>

<p>But when the marshal came again to the castle gate he found the
portcullis down and a dark-faced, bearded Saracen glaring at him
through the iron bars. The marshal at once ordered the cross bowmen
to shoot the fellow down, but as they raised their weapons to their
shoulder there was a loud explosion that almost deafened them and
flame leaped from a strange thing that the Saracen held against his
shoulder and pointed at them. One of the cross bowmen screamed and
lunged forward upon his face and the others turned and fled.</p>

<p>They were brave men in the face of dangers that were natural and
to be expected, but in the presence of the supernatural, the weird,
the uncanny, they reacted as most men do, and what could have been
more weird than death leaping in flame and with a great noise
through space to strike their fellow down?</p>

<p>But Sir Bulland, the marshal, was a knight of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>He might wish to run away fully as much as the simple and lowly
men-at-arms, but there was something that held him there that was
more potent than fear of death. It is called Honor.</p>

<p>Sir Bulland could not run away and so he sat there on his great
horse and challenged the Saracens to mortal combat; challenged them
to send their doughtiest sir knight to meet him and thus decide who
should hold the gate.</p>

<p>But the Arabs already held it. Furthermore they did not
understand him. In addition to all this they were without honor as
Sir Bulland knew it, and perhaps as any one other than a Beduin
knows it, and would but have laughed at his silly suggestion.</p>

<p>One thing they did know&mdash;two things they knew&mdash;that he
was a <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> and that he
was unarmed. They did not count his great lance and his sword as
weapons, for he could not reach them with either. So one of them
took careful aim and shot Sir Bulland through his chain mail where
it covered his noble and chivalrous heart.</p>

<p>IBN Jad had the run of the castle of King Bohun and he was sure
that he had discovered the fabled City of Nimmr that the <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a> had told him of. He
herded together the women and children and the few men that
remained and held them under guard. For a while he was minded to
slay them, since they were but <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, but he was so pleased at
having found and taken the treasure city that he let them
live&mdash;for the time at least.</p>

<p>At his command his followers ransacked the castle in search of
the treasure. Nor were they disappointed, for the riches of Bohun
were great. There was gold in the hills of the Valley of the
Sepulcher and there were precious stones to be found there, also.
For seven and a half centuries the slaves of the Sepulcher and of
Nimmr had been washing gold from the creek beds and salvaging
precious stones from the same source. The real value of such was
not to the men of the Sepulcher and Nimmr what it would be to men
of the outer world. They but esteemed these things as trinkets, yet
they liked them and saved them and even bartered for them on
occasion, but they did not place them in vaults under lock and key.
Why should they in a land where such things were not stolen? Their
women and their horses they guarded, but not their gold or their
jewels.</p>

<p>And so Ibn Jad gathered a great sack full of treasure, enough to
satisfy the wildest imaginings of his cupidity. He gathered all
that he could find in the castle of King Bohun, more than he had
hoped to find in this fabled city; and then a strange thing
happened. Having more wealth than he possibly could use he wanted
more. No, not so strange after all, for Ibn Jad was human.</p>

<p>He spent the night with his followers in the castle of King
Bohun and during the night he planned, for he had seen a wide
valley stretching far away to other mountains and at the base of
those mountains he had seen that which appeared to be a city.
"Perhaps," thought Ibn Jad, "it is a richer city than this. I shall
start on the morrow to see."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE BLACK
KNIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DOWN the field thundered the two chargers. Silence
fell upon the stands. They were almost met when Sir Guy realized
that his adversary bore no shield. But what of that? He had been
sent to the lists by his own people&mdash;the responsibility was
theirs, the advantage Sir Guy's. Had they sent him in without a
sword Sir Guy might still have slain him without besmirching his
knightly honor, for such were the laws of the Great Tourney.</p>

<p>Yet his discovery had its effect upon the Knight of the
Sepulcher as just for an instant it had distracted his attention
from the thought that should have been uppermost in his
mind&mdash;gaining the primary advantage by the skill of his
opening attack.</p>

<p>He saw his antagonist's horse swing out just before they met. He
stood in his stirrups, as had Sir Malud, to deliver a terrific cut;
then Blake threw his horse straight into the shoulder of Sir Guy's.
The latter's sword fell and with a loud, clanging noise slipped
harmlessly from the blade of the Knight of Nimmr. Guy had raised
his buckler to protect his own head and neck and could not see Sir
James. Guy's horse stumbled and nearly fell. As it recovered itself
Blake's blade slipped beneath the buckler of the Knight of the
Sepulcher and its point pierced the gorget of his adversary and
passed through his throat.</p>

<p>With a cry that ended in a blood choked gurgle Sir Guy of the
Sepulcher toppled backward upon his horse's rump and rolled upon
the ground while the south stands went mad with joy.</p>

<p>The laws of the Great Tourney account the knight who is unhorsed
as slain, so the coup-de-grace is never given and no knight is
killed unnecessarily. The victor rides to the tilt of the
vanquished, wheels about and gallops to his own tilt, the full
length of the lists, where he waits until a herald of the opposing
side fetches the prize to him.</p>

<p>And so it was that as Blake swung from his saddle, sword in
hand, and approached the fallen Sir Guy, a gasp arose from the
south stands and a roar of angry protest from the north.</p>

<p>Marshals and heralds galloped madly from the tilt of the fallen
Backer and, seeing this, Sir Richard, fearing that Blake would be
set upon and slain, led a similar party from his end of the
field.</p>

<p>Blake approached the fallen knight, who lay upon his back,
feebly struggling to arise, and when the spectators looked to see
him run Sir Guy through with his sword they saw him instead toss
the weapon to the ground and kneel beside the wounded man.</p>

<p>With an arm beneath Sir Guy's shoulders he raised him and held
him against his knee while he tore off his helm and gorget, and
when the marshals and the heralds and the others drew rein beside
him. Blake was trying to staunch the flow of blood.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried to them, "a chirurgeon! His jugular is not
touched, but this flow of blood must be stopped."</p>

<p>Several of the knights dismounted and gathered about, and among
them was Sir Richard. A herald of Sir Guy's faction kneeled and
took the youth from Blake's arms.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Richard. "Leave the sir knight to his own
friends."</p>

<p>Blake arose. He saw how peculiar were the expressions upon the
faces of the knights about him, but as he drew away one of them
spoke. An older man, who was one of Bohun's marshals.</p>

<p>"Thou art a generous and chivalrous knight," he said to Blake,
"and a courageous one too who would thus set at naught the laws of
the Great Tourney and the customs of centuries."</p>

<p>Blake faced him squarely. "I do not give a damn for your laws or
your customs," he said. "Where I come from a decent man wouldn't
let a yellow dog bleed to death without trying to save him, much
less a brave and gallant boy like this, and because he fell by my
hand, by the customs of my country I should be compelled to aid
him."</p>

<p>"Yes," explained Sir Richard, "as otherwise he would be punished
with a raspberry."</p>

<p><br>THE winning of the first event of the day was but a forerunner
of a series of successes on the part of the Knights of Nimmr until,
at the opening of the last event, the score showed four hundred
fifty two points for them against four hundred forty eight for
their opponents. A margin of four points, however, was as nothing
at this stage of the tourney, as the final event held one hundred
points which Fate might allot almost entirely to one side.</p>

<p>This was the most spectacular event of the whole tourney and one
which the spectators always looked forward to with the greatest
anticipation. Two hundred knights were engaged in it, one hundred
Knights of Nimmr against one hundred Knights of the Sepulcher. They
formed at opposite ends of the lists and as the trumpets sounded
the signal they charged with lances, and thus they fought until all
of one side had been unhorsed or had retired from the field because
of wounds. Broken lances could be replaced as a polo player may
ride out and obtain a fresh mallet when he breaks his. Otherwise
there were few rules to govern this concluding number of the Great
Tourney, which more nearly approximated a battle scene than any
other event of the three days of conflict.</p>

<p>Blake had won his fifteen points for the Knights of Nimmr in the
opening event of the day and again with four other comrades, pitted
against five mounted swordsmen from the north, he had helped to add
still further points to the growing score of the Fronters.</p>

<p>He was entered in the last event largely because the marshals
appreciated the value of his horsemanship and felt that it would
more than compensate for his inexperience with the lance.</p>

<p>The two hundred mailed knights had paraded for the final event
and were forming line at opposite ends of the lists, one hundred
Knights of the Sepulcher at one end and one hundred Knights of
Nimmr at the other. Their chargers, especially selected for this
encounter, were powerful and fleet, chosen for their courage as
were the youths who bestrode them.</p>

<p>The knights, with few exceptions, were youths in their twenties,
for to youth went the laurels of this great sport of the Middle
Ages as they still do in the sports of today. Here and there was a
man of middle age, a hardened veteran whose heart and hand had
withstood the march of years and whose presence exerted a steadying
influence upon the young knights the while it spurred them to their
utmost efforts, for these were champions whose deeds were sung by
minstrels in the great halls of the castles of Nimmr.</p>

<p>In proud array, with upright lances and fluttering pennons, the
sunlight glinting from burnished mail and bit and boss and shining
brightly upon the gorgeous housings of their mounts, the two
hundred presented a proud and noble spectacle as they awaited the
final summons of the trumpet.</p>

<p>Rearing and plunging, eager to be off, many a war horse broke
the line as will a thoroughbred at the barrier, while at one side
and opposite the center of the lists a herald waited for the moment
that both lines should be formed before he gave the signal that
would send these iron men hurtling into combat.</p>

<p>Blake found himself well toward the center of the line of
Nimmr's knights, beneath him a great black that fretted to be off,
before him the flower of the knighthood of the Sepulcher. In his
right hand he grasped a heavy, iron-shod lance, the butt of which
rested in a boot at his stirrup, and upon his left arm he bore a
great shield, nor had he any wish to discard it in the face of all
those sturdy, iron-tipped lances. As he looked down the long length
of the lists upon the hundred knights that would presently be
racing toward him in solid array with lance points projecting far
ahead of their horses, Blake felt that his shield was entirely
inadequate and he experienced a certain nervousness that reminded
him of similar moments of tense waiting for the referee's whistle
during his football days&mdash;those seemingly long-gone days of
another life that he sensed now as a remote and different
incarnation.</p>

<p>As last came the signal! He saw the herald raise his sword on
high. With the two hundred he gathered his restive charger and
couched his lance. The sword fell! From the four corners of the
lists trumpets blared; from two hundred throats rose the cri de
guerre; four hundred spurs transmitted the awaited signal from man
to horse.</p>

<p>The thundering lines bore down the field while a score of
heralds raced along the flanks and rear to catch any infraction of
the sole regulation that bore upon the final tumultuous collision.
Each knight must engage the foe upon his bridle hand, for to couch
his lance upon the one to his right was an unknightly act, since
thus a single knight might have two lances set upon him at once,
against which there could be no defence.</p>

<p>From above the rim of his shield Blake saw the solid front of
lances, iron-shod chargers and great shields almost upon him. The
speed, the weight, the momentum seemed irresistible and,
metaphorically, with deep respect Blake took his hat off to the
knights of old.</p>

<p>Now the two lines were about to meet! The spectators sat in
spellbound silence; the riders, grim-jawed, with tight set lips,
were voiceless now.</p>

<p>Blake, his lance across his horse's withers, picked the knight
racing toward him upon his left hand; for an instant he caught the
other's eyes and then each crouched behind his shield as the two
lines came together with a deafening crash.</p>

<p>Blake's shield smashed back against his face and body with such
terrific force that he was almost carried from his saddle. He felt
his own lance strike and splinter and then, half stunned, he was
through the iron line, his charger, frantic and uncontrolled,
running wildly toward the tilts of Bohun's knights.</p>

<p>With an effort Blake pulled himself together, gathered his reins
and finally managed to get his horse under control, and it was not
until he had reined him about that he got his first glimpse of the
result of the opening encounter. A half dozen chargers were
scrambling to their feet and nearly a score more were galloping,
riderless, about the lists. A full twenty-five knights lay upon the
field and twice that many squires and serving men were running in
on foot to succor their masters.</p>

<p>Already several of the knights had again set their lances
against an enemy and Blake saw one of the Knights of the Sepulcher
bearing down upon him, but he raised his broken spear shaft above
his head to indicate that he was momentarily hors de combat and
galloped swiftly back to his own end of the lists where Edward was
awaiting him with a fresh weapon.</p>

<p>"Thou didst nobly well, beloved master," cried Edward.</p>

<p>"Did I get my man?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"That thou didst, sir," Edward assured him, beaming with pride
and pleasure, "and all be thou breaked'st thy lance upon his shield
thou didst then so unhorse him."</p>

<p>Armed anew Blake turned back toward the center of the lists
where many individual encounters were taking place. Already several
more knights were down and the victors looking for new conquests in
which the stands were assisting with hoarse cries and advice, and
as Blake rode back into the lists he was espied by many in the
north stands occupied by the knights and followers of the
Sepulcher.</p>

<p>"The black knight!" they cried. "Here! Here! Sir Wildred! Here
is the black knight who overthrew Sir Guy. Have at him, Sir
Wildred!"</p>

<p>Sir Wildred, a hundred yards away, couched his lance. "Have at
thee, Sir Black Knight!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"You're on!" Blake shouted back, putting spurs to the great
black.</p>

<p>Sir Wildred was a large man and he bestrode a raw-boned roan
with the speed of a deer and the heart of a lion. The pair would
have been a match for the best of Nimmr's knighthood.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well for Blake's peace of mind that Wildred
appeared to him like any other knight and that he did not know that
he was the most sung of all the heroes of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, any knight looked formidable to Blake, who
was still at a loss to understand how he had unhorsed his man in
the first encounter of this event.</p>

<p>"The bird must have lost both stirrups," is what he had mentally
assured himself when Edward had announced his victory.</p>

<p>But he couched his lance like a good sir knight and true and
bore down upon the redoubtable Sir Wildred. The Knight of the
Sepulcher was charging diagonally across the field from the south
stands. Beyond him Blake caught a glimpse of a slim, girlish figure
standing in the central loge. He could not see her eyes, but he
knew that they were upon him.</p>

<p>"For my Princess!" he whispered as Sir Wildred loomed large
before him.</p>

<p>Lance smote on shield as the two knights crashed together with
terrific force and Blake felt himself lifted clear of his saddle
and hurled heavily to the ground. He was neither stunned nor badly
hurt and as he sat up a sudden grin wreathed his face, for there,
scarce a lance length from him, sat Sir Wildred. But Sir Wildred
did not smile.</p>

<p>"'Sdeath!" he cried. "Thou laughest at me, sirrah?"</p>

<p>"If I look as funny as you do," Blake assured him, "you've got a
laugh coming, too."</p>

<p>Sir Wildred knit his brows. "'Ods blood!" he exclaimed. "An thou
beest a knight of Nimmr I am a Saracen! Who art thou? Thy speech
savoreth not of the Valley."</p>

<p>Blake had arisen. "Hurt much?" he asked stepping forward. "Here,
I'll give you a hand up."</p>

<p>"Thou art, of a certainty, a strange sir knight," said Wildred.
"I recall now that thou didst offer succor to Sir Guy when thou
hadst fairly vanquished him."</p>

<p>"Well, what's wrong with that?" asked Blake. "I haven't anything
against you. We've had a bully good scrap and are out of it. Why
should we sit here and make faces at one another?"</p>

<p>Sir Wildred shook his head. "Thou art beyond my comprehension,"
he admitted.</p>

<p>By this time their squires and a couple of serving men had
arrived, but neither of the fallen knights was so badly injured
that he could not walk without assistance. As they started for
their respective tilts Blake turned and smiled at Wildred.</p>

<p>"So long, old man!" he cried cheerily. "Hope we meet again some
day."</p>

<p>Still shaking his head Sir Wildred limped away, followed by the
two who had come to assist him.</p>

<p>At his tilt Blake learned that the outcome of the Great Tourney
still hung in the balance and it was another half hour before the
last of the Knights of Nimmr went down in defeat, leaving two
Knights of the Sepulcher victorious upon the field. But this was
not enough to overcome the lead of four points that the Fronters
had held at the opening of the last event and a moment later the
heralds announced that the Knights of Nimmr had won the Great
Tourney by the close margin of two points.</p>

<p>Amidst the shouting of the occupants of the stands at the south
the Knights of Nimmr who had taken part in the tourney and had won
points for the Fronters formed to ride upon the lists and claim the
grand prize. Not all were there, as some had been killed or wounded
in encounters that had followed their victories, though the toll on
both sides had been much smaller than Blake had imagined that it
would be. Five men were dead and perhaps twenty too badly injured
to ride, the casualties being about equally divided.</p>

<p>As the Knights of Nimmr rode down the field to claim the five
maidens from the City of the Sepulcher, Bohun gathered all his
knights at his side of the lists as though preparing to ride back
to his camp. At the same time a Knight of the Sepulcher, wearing
the leopard skin bassinet of Nimmr, entered the stands upon the
south side of the field and made his way toward the loge of Prince
Gobred.</p>

<p>Bohun watched. The Knights of Nimmr were at the far end of the
field engrossed in the ritualistic rites that the laws of the Great
Tourney prescribed for the reception of the five maidens.</p>

<p>Close beside Bohun two young knights sat their chargers, their
eyes upon their king, and one of them held the bridle of a
riderless horse.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bohun raised his hand and spurred across the field
followed by his knights. They moved a little toward the end of the
field where the Knights of Nimmr were congregated so that the bulk
of them were between this end of the field and Gobred's loge.</p>

<p>The young knight who had sat close beside Bohun, and his
companion leading the riderless horse, spurred at a run straight
for the stands of Nimmr and the loge of the Prince. As they drew in
abreast of it a knight leaped into the loge from the rear, swept
Guinalda into his arms, tossed her quickly to the young knight
waiting to receive her, sprang to the edge of the rail and leaped
into the saddle of the spare horse being held in readiness for him;
then they both wheeled and spurred away before the surprised Gobred
or those about him could raise a hand to stay them. Behind them
swept Bohun and the Knights of the Sepulcher, out toward the camp
among the oaks.</p>

<p>Instantly all was pandemonium. A trumpeter in Gobred's loge
sounded the alarm; the prince ran from the stands to the spot where
his horse was being held by a groom; the Knights of Nimmr, ignorant
of what had occurred, not knowing where to rally or against whom,
milled about the lists for a few moments.</p>

<p>Then Gobred came, spurring swiftly before them. "Bohun has
stolen the Princess Guinalda!" he cried. "Knights of Nimmr&mdash;"
but before he could say more, or issue orders to his followers, a
black knight on a black charger spurred roughly through the ranks
of surrounding men and was away after the retreating Knights of the
Sepulcher.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; LORD TARZAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a nasty smile upon Tollog's lips as he
thought how neatly he had foiled Ateja, who would have warned the
<a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> of the plot to
slay him, and he thanked Allah that chance had placed him in a
position to intercept her before she had been able to ruin them
all. Even as Tollog, the brother of the sheikh, smiled in his beard
a hand reached out of the darkness behind him and seized him by the
throat&mdash;fingers grasped him and he was dragged away.</p>

<p>Into the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> that had been Zeyd's
and which had been set up for the <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a>, Tollog was dragged. He
struggled and tried to scream for help, but he was powerless in the
grip of steel that held him and choked him.</p>

<p>Inside the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> a voice whispered in
his ear. "Cry out, Tollog," it said, "and I shall have to kill
you." Then the grasp upon his throat relaxed, but Tollog did not
call for help, for he had recognized the voice that spoke and he
knew that it had made no idle threat.</p>

<p>He lay still while the bonds were drawn tight about his wrists
and ankles and a gag fastened securely in his mouth, he felt the
folds of his burnoose drawn across his face and
then&mdash;silence.</p>

<p>He heard Stimbol creep into the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>,
but he thought that it was still he who had bound him. And thus
died Tollog, the brother of Ibn Jad, died as he had planned that
Tarzan of the Apes should die.</p>

<p>And, knowing that he would die thus, there was a smile upon the
lips of the ape-man as he swung through the forest toward the
southeast.</p>

<p>Tarzan's quest was not for Beduins but for Blake. Having assured
himself that the white man in the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad was Stimbol and that none knew the whereabouts of the other
American, he was hastening back to the locality where Blake's boys
had told him their bwana had disappeared, in the hope of picking up
his trail and, if unable to assist him, at least to learn what fate
had overtaken him.</p>

<p>Tarzan moved swiftly and his uncanny senses of sight and smell
aided him greatly in wresting its secrets from the jungle, yet it
was three days before he found the spot where Ara the lightning had
struck down Blake's gun bearer.</p>

<p>Here he discovered Blake's faint spoor leading toward the north.
Tarzan shook his head, for he knew that there was a stretch of
uninhabited forest laying between this place and the first Galla
villages. Also he knew that if Blake survived hunger and the menace
of wild beasts he might only live to fall victim to a Galla
spear.</p>

<p>For two days Tarzan followed a spoor that no other human eye
might have discerned. On the afternoon of the second day he came
upon a great stone cross built directly in the center of an ancient
trail. Tarzan saw the cross from the concealment of bushes for he
moved as beasts of prey moved, taking advantage of every cover,
suspicious of every strange object, always ready for flight or
battle as occasion might demand.</p>

<p>So it was that he did not walk blindly into the clutches of the
two men-at-arms that guarded the outer way to the City of Nimmr. To
his keen ears was borne the sound of their voices long before he
saw them.</p>

<p>Even as Sheeta or Numa approach their prey, so Tarzan of the
Apes crept through the brush until he lay within a few yards of the
men-at-arms. To his vast astonishment he heard them conversing in a
quaint form of English that, while understandable to him, seemed
yet a foreign tongue. He marvelled at their antiquated costumes and
obsolete weapons, and in them he saw an explanation of Blake's
disappearance and a suggestion of his fate.</p>

<p>For a time Tarzan lay watching the two with steady, unblinking
eyes&mdash;it might have been Numa himself, weighing the chances
of a sudden charge. He saw that each was armed with a sturdy pike
and a sword. They could speak English, after a fashion, therefore,
he argued, they might be able to give him word of Blake. But would
they receive him in a friendly spirit or would they attempt to set
upon and slay him?</p>

<p>He determined that he could never ascertain what their attitude
would be by lying hidden among the brush, and so he gathered
himself, as Numa does when he is about to spring.</p>

<p>The two blacks were idly gossiping, their minds as far from
thoughts of danger as it were possible they could be, when suddenly
without warning Tarzan launched himself full upon the back of the
nearer, hurling him to the ground. Before the other could gather
his wits the ape-man had dragged his victim into the concealment of
the bush from which he had sprung, while the fellow's companion
turned and fled in the direction of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The man in Tarzan's grasp fought and struggled to be free but
the ape-man held him as easily as he might have held a child.</p>

<p>"Lie still," he advised, "I shall not harm you."</p>

<p>"'Ods blood!" cried the black. "What manner of creature art
thou?"</p>

<p>"One who will not harm you if you will tell him the truth,"
replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What wouldst thou know?" demanded the black.</p>

<p>"A white man came this way many weeks ago. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Thou speakest of Sir James?" asked the soldier.</p>

<p>"Sir James!" mused Tarzan and then he recollected that Blake's
first name was James. "His name was James," he replied, "James
Blake."</p>

<p>"Verily, 'tis the same," said the soldier.</p>

<p>"You have seen him? Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He is defending the honor of Our Lord Jesus and the Knights of
Nimmr in the Great Tourney in the lists upon the plain below the
city, and hast thou come to wreak despite upon our good Sir James
thou wilt find many doughty knights and men-at-arms who will take
up the gage in his behalf."</p>

<p>"I am his friend," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Then why didst thou leap upon me thus, if thou beest a friend
to Sir James?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>"I did not know how you had received him or how you would
receive me."</p>

<p>"A friend of Sir James will be received well in Nimmr," said the
man.</p>

<p>Tarzan took the man's sword from him and permitted him to
rise&mdash;his pike he had dropped before being dragged among the
bushes.</p>

<p>"Go before me and lead me to your master," commanded the
ape-man, "and remember that your life will be the forfeit that you
must pay for treachery."</p>

<p>"Do not make me leave the road unguarded against the Saracens,"
begged the man. "Soon my companion will return with others and then
I shall beg them to take thee where thou wilt."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed the ape-man. They had not waited long before
he heard the sound of hastening footsteps and a strange jingling
and clanking that might have been caused by the shaking of many
chains and the striking against them of objects of metal.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward he was surprised to see a white man clothed in
chain mail and carrying a sword and buckler descending the trail at
a trot, a dozen pike-men at his back.</p>

<p>"Tell them to halt!" commanded Tarzan, placing the point of the
man's sword in the small of his back. "Tell them I would talk with
them before they approach too closely."</p>

<p>"Stop, I pray thee!" cried the fellow. "This is a friend of Sir
James, but he will run me through with my own sword an thou
pressest him too close. Parley with him, most noble sir knight, for
I would live at least to know the result of the Great Tourney."</p>

<p>The knight halted a few paces from Tarzan and looked him up and
down from feet to head. "Thou art truly a friend to Sir James?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded. "I have been seeking him for days."</p>

<p>"And some mishap befell thee and thou lostest thy apparel."</p>

<p>The ape-man smiled. "I go thus, in the jungle," he said.</p>

<p>"Art thou a sir knight and from the same country as Sir
James?"</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman," replied Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>"An Englishman! Thrice welcome then to Nimmr! I am Sir Bertram
and a good friend to Sir James."</p>

<p>"And I am called Tarzan," said the ape-man.</p>

<p>"And thy rank?" inquired Sir Bertram.</p>

<p>Tarzan was mystified by the strange manners and garb of his
seemingly friendly inquisitor, but he sensed that whatever the man
might be he took himself quite seriously and would be more
impressed if he knew that Tarzan was a man of position, and so he
answered him truthfully, in his quiet way.</p>

<p>"A Viscount," he said.</p>

<p>"A peer of the realm!" exclaimed Sir Bertram. "Prince Gobred
wilt be o'er pleased to greet thee, Lord Tarzan. Come thou with me
and I will furnish thee with apparel that befits thee."</p>

<p>At the outer barbican Bertram took Tarzan into the quarters
reserved for the knight commanding the warders and kept him there
while he sent his squire to the castle to fetch raiment and a
horse, and while they waited Bertram told Tarzan all that had
befallen Blake since his arrival in Nimmr and, too, much of the
strange history of this unknown British colony. When the squire
returned with the clothing it was found that it fitted the ape-man
well, for Bertram was a large man, and presently Tarzan of the Apes
was garbed as a Knight of Nimmr and was riding down toward the
castle with Sir Bertram. Here the knight announced him at the gate
as the Lord Viscount Tarzan. Once within he introduced him to
another knight whom he persuaded to relieve him at the gate while
he conducted Tarzan to the lists that he might be presented to
Gobred and witness the final scenes of the tourney, were it not
concluded before they arrived.</p>

<p>And so it was that Tarzan of the Apes, clad in chain mail, and
armed with lance and sword, rode down into the Valley of the
Sepulcher just as Bohun put his foul scheme into execution and
carried off the Princess Guinalda.</p>

<p>Long before they reached the lists Bertram was aware that
something was amiss, for they could see the dust clouds racing
rapidly north away from the lists as though one body of knights
pursued another. He put spurs to his mount and Tarzan followed
suit, and so they came at a stiff run to the lists and there they
found all pandemonium.</p>

<p>The women were mounting preparatory to riding back to Nimmr
under escort of a few knights that Gobred had sent back to guard
them. The men-at-arms were forming themselves into companies, but
all was being done in a confused manner since every now and then a
great part of the company would rush to the highest part of the
stands and peer off toward the north after the clouds of dust that
revealed nothing to them.</p>

<p>Sir Bertram accosted one of his fellows. "What hath befallen?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Bohun hath seized the Princess Guinalda and carried her away,"
came the astounding reply.</p>

<p>"Zounds!" cried Bertram, reining about. "Wilt ride with me in
the service of our princess, Lord Tarzan?"</p>

<p>For answer Tarzan spurred his horse alongside of Bertram's and
stirrup to stirrup the two set out across the plain, while far
ahead of them Blake drew gradually closer and closer to the fleeing
Knights of the Sepulcher. So thick was the cloud of dust they threw
up that they were hid from their pursuer even as he was hid from
them and so were unaware that Blake was near them.</p>

<p>The American carried no lance or shield, but his sword clattered
and clashed at his side and at his right hip swung his forty-five.
Whenever he had been armed, since he entered Nimmr, he had carried
this weapon of another world and another age. To their queries he
had answered that it was but a lucky talisman that he carried, but
in his heart was the thought that some day it might stand him in
better stead than these simple knights and ladies could dream.</p>

<p>He knew that he would never use it except in battle, or as a
last resort against overwhelming odds or unfair tactics, but he was
glad that he carried it today as it might mean the difference
between liberty and captivity for the woman he loved.</p>

<p>Slowly he drew closer to the rearmost Knights of the Sepulcher.
Their mounts bred and trained to the utmost endurance and to carry
the great weight of man and mail kept to a brisk canter even after
the first long spurt of speed that had carried them away from the
lists of Nimmr.</p>

<p>The dust rolled up in clouds from iron-shod feet. Through it
Blake groped, catching vague glimpses of mounted men just ahead.
The black, powerful, fleet, courageous, showed no sign of fatigue.
The rider carried his sword in his hand, ready. He was no longer a
black knight, but a gray. Bassinet, hauberk, all the rich
caparisons of his horse, the horse itself, were gray with dust.</p>

<p>Blake glimpsed a knight toward whom he was slowly drawing
closer. This knight was gray! Like a flash Blake realized the value
of the camouflage that chance had laid upon him. He might ride
among them and they would not suspect that he was not one of
them!</p>

<p>Instantly he sheathed his sword and pressed forward, but he
edged off a little from the knight before he passed him. Urging the
black ever a little faster Blake crept up through the ranks of
Bohun's knights. Somewhere a knight was carrying double and this
knight he sought.</p>

<p>The nearer the head of the column he forged the greater became
the danger of discovery, for now the dust was less thick and men
could see farther, but yet his own armor, his face, the leopard
skin of his bassinet were coated thick with gray and though knights
peered intently at him as he passed none recognized him.</p>

<p>Once one hailed him. "Is't thou, Percival?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Blake and spurred on a trifle faster.</p>

<p>Now, dimly, just ahead, he saw several knights bunched close and
once he thought he glimpsed the fluttering garments of a woman in
their midst. Pressing on, he drew close behind these and there,
surrounded by knights, he saw a woman held before one of the
riders.</p>

<p>Drawing his sword he spurred straight between two knights who
rode close behind he who carried Guinalda, and as Blake passed he
cut to the right and left and the two knights rolled from their
saddles.</p>

<p>At a touch of the spurs the black leaped abreast the young
knight that was bearing off the princess. So quickly was the thing
accomplished that the knights who rode scarce an arm's length from
him had not the time to realize what was occurring and prevent
it.</p>

<p>Blake slipped his left arm about the girl and at the same time
thrust to the left above his left forearm, driving his blade far
into the body of the youthful knight. Then he spurred forward
carrying Guinalda from the dead arms as the knight pitched headlong
from his saddle.</p>

<p>Blake's sword was wrenched from his grasp, so far had he driven
it into the body of the man who dared commit this wrong against the
woman Blake loved.</p>

<p>Cries of rage arose about him as knights spurred in pursuit and
the black ran free with no guiding hand upon the reins. A huge
fellow loomed just at Blake's rear and another was closing in from
the other side. The first man swung his sword as he stood in his
stirrups and the second was already reaching for Blake with his
point.</p>

<p>Strange oaths were on their lips and their countenances were
contorted by rage as they strove to have the life of the rash man
who had almost thwarted them in their design, but that he could
succeed they had not the remotest belief, for he was one against a
thousand.</p>

<p>Then something happened the like of which had never been known
to them or their progenitors. A blue barreled forty-five flashed
from the holster at Blake's hip, there was a loud report and the
knight upon Blake's right rear lunged head foremost to the ground.
Blake turned in his saddle and shot the knight upon his other side
between the eyes.</p>

<p>Terrified, the horses of other knights close by, who might have
menaced him, bolted, as did the great black that Blake bestrode;
but while the American was trying to replace his weapon in its
holster and gather the reins in his right hand he leaned to the
left and thus forced the horse slowly around toward the direction
he wished him to go, Blake's plan being to cut across the front of
the Knights of the Sepulcher and then turn southward toward
Nimmr.</p>

<p>He was sure that Gobred and his followers must be close in
pursuit, and that it would be but a matter of minutes before he
would have Guinalda safe behind a thousand or more knights, any one
of whom would lay down his life for her.</p>

<p>But the Knights of the Sepulcher had spread out over a greater
front than Blake had anticipated, and now he saw them coming
rapidly upon his left and was forced to swerve in a more northerly
direction.</p>

<p>Closer and closer they came and once more the American found it
necessary to drop his reins and draw his forty-five. One shot sent
the horses of the menacing knights rearing and plunging away from
the terrifying sound, and it sent the black into a new paroxysm of
terror that almost resulted in Blake and the girl being
unhorsed.</p>

<p>When the man finally brought the animal again under control the
dust cloud that marked the position of the Knights of the Sepulcher
was far behind, and close upon Blake's left was a great forest,
whose dark depths offered concealment for the moment at least.</p>

<p>Reining quickly within Sir James drew up and gently lowered
Guinalda to the ground. Then he dismounted and tied the black to a
tree, for Blake was spent after what he had been through this day
since his first entry upon the lists, and the black was spent as
well.</p>

<p>He slipped the housing and the heavy saddle from the horse's
back and took the great bit from his mouth, replacing a portion of
the housing to serve as a cooler until the horse should be less
heated, nor once did he glance at the princess until he had
finished caring for his horse.</p>

<p>Then he turned and faced her. She was standing leaning against a
tree, looking at him.</p>

<p>"Thou art brave, sir knight," she said softly, and then added,
arrogantly, "but still a boor."</p>

<p>Blake smiled, wanly. He was very tired and had no wish to
argue.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to ask you to do it," he said, ignoring what she had
said to him, "but Sir Galahad here will have to be kept moving
about a bit until he cools off and I'm too fagged to do it."</p>

<p>The Princess Guinalda looked at him in wide-eyed amazement.
"Thou&mdash;thou," she stammered, "thou meanest that I should lead
the beast? I, a princess!"</p>

<p>"I can't do it, Guinalda," replied Blake. "I tell you I'm just
about all in, lugging all these skid chains about since sunrise. I
guess you'll have to do it."</p>

<p>"Have to! Durst thou command, knave?"</p>

<p>"Snap out of it, girl!" advised Blake curtly. "I'm responsible
for your safety and it may all depend on this horse. Get busy, and
do as I tell you! Lead him back and forth slowly."</p>

<p>There were tears of rage in the eyes of the Princess Guinalda as
she prepared to make an angry retort, but there was something in
Blake's eyes that silenced her. She looked at him for a long moment
and then turned and walked to the black. Untying the rope that
tethered him to the tree she led him slowly to and fro, while Blake
sat with his back against a great tree and watched out across the
plain for the first sign of pursuit.</p>

<p>But there was no pursuit, for the knights of Nimmr had taken the
Knights of the Sepulcher and the two forces were engaging in a
running fight that was leading them farther and farther away toward
the City of the Sepulcher upon the north side of the valley.</p>

<p>Guinalda led the black for half an hour. She led him in silence
and in silence Blake sat gazing out across the valley. Presently he
turned toward the girl and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"That'll be good," he said, approaching her. "Thank you. I'll
rub him a bit now. I was too exhausted to do it before."</p>

<p>Without a word she turned the black over to him and with dry
leaves he rubbed the animal from muzzle to dock. When he had
finished he threw the housing over him again and came and sat down
beside the girl.</p>

<p>He let his eyes wander to her profile&mdash;to her straight
nose, her short upper lip, her haughty chin. "She is beautiful,"
thought Blake, "but selfish, arrogant and cruel." But when she
turned her eyes toward him, even though they passed over him as
though he had not been there, they seemed to belie all the other
evidence against her.</p>

<p>He noticed that her eyes were never quiet. Her glances roved
from place to place, but most often into the depths of the wood and
upward among the branches of the trees. Once she started and turned
suddenly to gaze intently into the forest.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"Methought something moved within the wood," she said. "Let us
be gone."</p>

<p>"It is almost dusk," he replied. "When it is dark we can ride to
Nimmr in safety. Some of Bohun's knights may still be searching for
you."</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed. "Remain here until dark? Knowest thou not
where we are?"</p>

<p>"Why, what's wrong with this place?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, her eyes wide with terror. "It be the
Wood of the Leopards!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he queried casually.</p>

<p>"Here lair the great leopards of Nimmr," she continued, "and
after night falls only a camp with many guards and beast fires is
safe from them. And even so not always then, for they have been
known to leap upon a warder and, dragging him into the wood, devour
him within hearing of the camp.</p>

<p>"But," suddenly her eyes responded to a new thought, "I had
forgotten the strange, roaring weapon with which thou slewest the
knights of Bohun! Of a surety with that thou couldst slay all the
leopards of the wood!"</p>

<p>Blake hesitated to undeceive her and add to her alarm.
"Perhaps," he said, "it will be as well to start now, for we have a
long ride and it will soon be dark."</p>

<p>As he spoke he started toward Sir Galahad. He had almost reached
the horse when the animal suddenly raised its head and with
up-pricked ears and dilated nostrils looked into the gathering
shadows of the wood. For an instant Sir Galahad trembled like a
leaf and then, with a wild snort, he lay back with all his weight
upon the tether, and as it parted with a snap he wheeled and raced
out upon the plain.</p>

<p>Blake drew his gun and peered into the wood, but he saw nothing
nor could his atrophied sense of smell catch the scent that had
come so clearly to the nostrils of Sir Galahad.</p>

<p>Eyes that he could not see were watching him, but they were not
the eyes of Sheeta the leopard.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; "I LOVE YOU!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LORD TARZAN rode with Sir Bertram in the wake of
the Knights of Nimmr, nor did they overtake them until after Blake
had borne Guinalda out of the battle which had followed immediately
the hosts of Gobred had overhauled the Knights of the
Sepulcher.</p>

<p>As the two approached, Tarzan saw opposing knights paired off in
mortal combat. He saw a Knight of Nimmr go down before an
adversary's lance and then the victor espied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Have at you, sir knight!" cried he of the Sepulcher, and
couched his lance and put spurs to his charger.</p>

<p>This was a new experience for the ape-man, a new adventure, a
new thrill. He knew as much about jousting as he did about
ping-pong, but from childhood he had wielded a spear, and so he
smiled as the knight charged upon him.</p>

<p>Lord Tarzan waited, and the Knight of the Sepulcher was
disconcerted to see his adversary awaiting him, motionless, his
spear not even couched to receive him.</p>

<p>Lord Bertram had reined in his horse to watch the combat and
observe how this English peer accounted for himself in battle and
he too was perplexed. Was the man mad, or was he fearful of the
issue?</p>

<p>As his antagonist approached him, Tarzan rose in his stirrups
and carried his lance hand above and behind his head, and when the
tip of the other's lance was yet five paces from him the ape-man
launched the heavy weapon as he had so often launched his hunting
spear and his war spear in the chase and in battle.</p>

<p>It was not Viscount Greystoke who faced the Knight of the
Sepulcher; it was not the king of the great apes. It was the chief
of the Waziri, and no other arm in the world could cast a war spear
as could his.</p>

<p>Forward his spear hand shot, straight as an arrow sped the great
lance. It struck the shield of the Knight of the Sepulcher just
above the boss and, splitting the heavy wood, drove into the heart
of Tarzan's foe, and at the same instant the ape-man reined his
horse aside as that of his fallen antagonist thundered past.</p>

<p>Sir Bertram shook his head and spurred to meet an antagonist
that had just challenged him. He was not sure that the act of Lord
Tarzan had been entirely ethical, but he had to admit that it had
been magnificent.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the battle carried Tarzan toward the west. His
lance gone, he fought with his sword. Luck and his great strength
and wondrous agility carried him through two encounters. By this
time the battle had drawn off toward the northeast.</p>

<p>Tarzan had accounted for his second man since he had lost his
lance and a Knight of the Sepulcher had slain a Knight of Nimmr.
Now these two remained alone upon the field, nor did the other lose
a moment in shouting his challenge to the ape-man.</p>

<p>Never in his life had Tarzan seen such fierce, bold men, such
gluttons for battle. That they gloried in conflict and in death
with a fierce lust that surpassed the maddest fanaticism he had
ever witnessed filled Tarzan's breast with admiration. What men!
What warriors!</p>

<p>Now the last knight was upon him. Their swords clashed on ready
buckler. They wheeled and turned and struck again. They passed and
spurred once more to close quarters. Each rose in his stirrups to
deliver a terrific cut, each sought to cleave the other's
skull.</p>

<p>The blade of the Knight of the Sepulcher glanced from Tarzan's
buckler and bit into the skull of the ape-man's charger, but
Tarzan's edge smote true.</p>

<p>As his horse went down Tarzan leaped free, his antagonist
falling dead at his feet, while the riderless horse of the slain
knight galloped swiftly off in the direction in which lay the City
of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>Tarzan looked about him. He was alone upon the field. Far to the
north and east he saw the dust of battle. The City of Nimmr lay
across the plain toward the south. When the battle was over it was
there that Blake would ride and it was Blake whom Tarzan wanted to
find. The sun was sinking behind the western hills as Tarzan turned
toward Nimmr.</p>

<p>The chain mail that he wore was heavy, hot and uncomfortable,
and Tarzan had not gone far before he discarded it. He had his
knife and his rope. These he always kept with him, but he left the
sword with the armor and with a sigh of relief continued on his
way.</p>

<p><br>IBN Jad, as he had come across the valley from the City of the
Sepulcher toward the city that he had seen upon the opposite side,
had been perturbed by the great clouds of dust that had been raised
by the Knights of the Sepulcher and the pursuing Nimmrians.</p>

<p>Seeing a forest close upon his right hand he had thought it
wiser to seek its concealing shadows until he could learn more
concerning that which caused so great a dust cloud, which he saw
was rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>Within the forest it was cool and here Ibn Jad and his followers
rested.</p>

<p>"Let us remain here," suggested Abd el-Aziz, "until evening,
when we may approach the city under cover of darkness."</p>

<p>Ibn Jad approved the plan and so they camped just within the
forest and waited. They watched the dust cloud pass and continue on
toward the City of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>, it is well we did escape
that village before yon host returned," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>They saw a horseman enter the forest, or pass to the south of
it&mdash;they could not know which&mdash;but they were not
interested in single horsemen, or in any horseman, so they did not
investigate. He seemed to be either carrying another person upon
his horse with him, or some great bundle. At a distance they could
not see which.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Abd el-Aziz, "we shall find greater treasure in
the city to the south."</p>

<p>"And perhaps the beautiful woman of whom the <a title=
"wise-man, scholar, sage"><i>sahar</i></a> spoke," added Ibn Jad,
"for she was not within the city we left this morning."</p>

<p>"There were some there that were beautiful," said Fahd.</p>

<p>"The one I seek is more beautiful than an <a title=
"one of the beautiful virgins of the Koranic paradise; a voluptuous, alluring woman">
<i>houri</i></a>," said Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>When they took up their march again just before dark they moved
cautiously just within the edge of the forest. They had covered a
mile, perhaps, when those in the lead heard voices ahead. Ibn Jad
sent one to investigate.</p>

<p>The man was soon back. His eyes were bright with excitement.
"Ibn Jad," he whispered, "thou needst seek no farther&mdash;the
<a title=
"one of the beautiful virgins of the Koranic paradise; a voluptuous, alluring woman">
<i>houri</i></a> is just ahead!"</p>

<p>Following the suggestion of the scout Ibn Jad, followed by his
companions, went deeper into the woods and approached Blake and
Guinalda from the west. When Sir Galahad broke loose and Blake drew
his forty-five Ibn Jad knew that they could remain in concealment
no longer. He called Fahd to him.</p>

<p>"Many of the <a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasranys</i></a>
speak the language thou didst learn among the soldiers of the
North," he said. "Speak thou therefore to this one in the same
tongue, telling him we are friends and that we are lost."</p>

<p>When Fahd saw the Princess Guinalda his eyes narrowed and he
trembled almost as might a man with ague. Never in his life had
Fahd seen so beautiful a woman, never had he dreamed that an
<a title=
"one of the beautiful virgins of the Koranic paradise; a voluptuous, alluring woman">
<i>houri</i></a> might be so lovely.</p>

<p>"Do not fire upon us," he called to Blake from the concealment
of some bushes. "We are friends. We are lost."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Blake, surprised to hear French spoken
in the Valley of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>"We are poor men from the desert country," replied Fahd. "We are
lost. Help us to find our way and the blessings of Allah shall be
upon thee."</p>

<p>"Come out and let me see you," said Blake. "If you are friendly
you need not fear me. I've had all the trouble I'm looking
for."</p>

<p>Fahd and Ibn Jad stepped out into view and at sight of them
Guinalda voiced a little scream and seized Blake's arm. "The
Saracens!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I guess they're Saracens all right," said Blake, "but you
needn't worry&mdash;they won't hurt you."</p>

<p>"Not harm a crusader?" she demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>"These fellows never heard of a crusader."</p>

<p>"Melikes not the way they look at me," whispered Guinalda.</p>

<p>"Well, neither do I, but perhaps they mean no harm."</p>

<p>With many smiles the Arabs gathered around the two and through
Fahd Ibn Jad repeated his protestations of friendship and his
delight at meeting one who could direct him from the valley. He
asked many questions about the City of Nimmr, and all the while his
followers pressed closer to Blake.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the smiles vanished from their faces as, at a signal
from their sheikh, four stalwart Beduins leaped upon the American
and bore him to the ground, snatching his gun from him, while
simultaneously two others seized the Princess Guinalda.</p>

<p>In a moment Blake was securely bound and the Arabs were debating
what disposition to make of him. Several wanted to slit his throat,
but Ibn Jad counseled against it since they were in a valley filled
with the man's friends and should the fortunes of war decide to
throw some of the Beduins into the hands of the enemy such would
fare better if they spared this one's life.</p>

<p>Blake threatened, promised, begged that they give Guinalda her
liberty, but Fahd only laughed at him and spit upon him. For a time
it seemed almost certain that they were going to kill Blake, as one
of the Beduins stood over him with a keen <a title=
"an Arabian knife with an angled blade, the cutting edge being on the concave side">
<i>khusa</i></a> in his hand, awaiting the word from Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>It was then that Guinalda tore free from those who held her and
threw herself upon Blake to shield his body from the blade with her
own.</p>

<p>"Thou shall not slay him!" she cried. "Take my life an thou must
have Christian blood, but spare him."</p>

<p>"They cannot understand you, Guinalda," said Blake. "Perhaps
they will not kill me, but that does not matter. You must escape
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, they must not kill thee&mdash;they shall not! Canst ever
forgive me the cruel words I spoke? I did not mean them. My pride
was hurt that thou shouldst say of me what Malud told me thou didst
say and so I spoke to hurt thee and not from my heart. Canst
forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you? God love you, I could forgive you murder! but what
did Malud tell you I had said?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mind not now. I care not what thou saidst. I tell thee I
forgive it! Say to me again thy words that thou didst speak when I
pinned my favor upon thy hauberk and I can forgive thee
anything."</p>

<p>"What did Malud say?" insisted Blake.</p>

<p>"That thou hadst bragged that thou wouldst win me and even cast
my love aside," she whispered.</p>

<p>"The cur! You must know that he lied, Guinalda."</p>

<p>"Say what I have asked and I shall know he lied," she
insisted.</p>

<p>"I love you! I love you, Guinalda!" cried Blake.</p>

<p>The Arabs laid heavy hands upon the girl and dragged her to her
feet. Ibn Jad and the others still argued about the disposition to
be made of Blake.</p>

<p>"By Allah!" exclaimed the sheikh, at last, "We shall leave the
<a title="infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> where he lies and
if he dies none can say that the <a title=
"Beduins"><i>Beduw</i></a> did slay him."</p>

<p>"Abd el-Aziz," he continued, "let thou take men and continue
across the valley to that other city. Come, I shall accompany thee
a way and we will talk out of hearing of this <a title=
"infidel, Christian"><i>Nasrany</i></a> who, perchance,
understandeth more of our tongue than he would have us guess."</p>

<p>As they moved away toward the south Guinalda tried to free
herself again from the grasp of her captors, but they dragged her
with them. Until the last Blake saw her struggling. He saw her dear
face turned toward him, and as they passed out of sight among the
trees she called back through the falling night three words that
meant more to him than all the languages of all the world combined:
"I love you!"</p>

<p>At a distance from Blake the Arabs halted. "I leave thee here,
Abd el-Aziz," said Ibn Jad. "Go thou and see if the city appears to
be a rich place, and if it be too strongly guarded make no attempt
to loot it, but return to the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> that
will be just beyond the northern summit where it now is, or, if we
move it, we shall make our trail plain that thou mayst follow
us.</p>

<p>"I shall hasten from the valley with this rich treasure that we
now have, not the least of which is the woman. <a title=
"By God!"><i>Billah!</i></a> in the north she will fetch the ransom
of a dozen sheikhs.</p>

<p>"Go, Abd el-Aziz, and may Allah be with thee!"</p>

<p>Ibn Jad turned directly north. His belief that the great body of
horsemen he had glimpsed amid the distant dust were returning to
the city he had sacked argued against his attempting to leave the
valley by the same route that he had entered it, and so he had
determined to attempt to scale the steep mountains at a point west
of the City of the Sepulcher, avoiding the castle and its defenders
entirely.</p>

<p><br>BLAKE heard the retreating footsteps of the Beduins die away in
the distance. He struggled with his bonds, but the camel leather
held securely. Then he lay quiet. How silent, how lonely the great,
black wood&mdash;the Wood of the Leopards! Blake listened.
Momentarily he expected to hear the fall of padded feet, the sound
of a great, furred body approaching through the underbrush. The
slow minutes dragged. An hour had passed.</p>

<p>The moon rose&mdash;a great, swollen, red moon that floated
silently up from behind distant mountains. This moon was looking
down upon Guinalda as it was on him. He whispered a message to
it&mdash;a message for his princess. It was the first time that
Blake ever had been in love and he almost forgot his bonds and the
leopards in recalling those three words that Guinalda had called
back at the instant of their separation.</p>

<p>What was that? Blake strained his eyes into the darkness of the
shadowy wood. Something was moving! Yes, it was the sound of
stealthy, padded feet&mdash;the scraping of a furred body against
leaves and twigs. The leopard of the wood was coming!</p>

<p>Hark! There must be another in a nearby tree, for he was sure
that he could see a shadowy form almost above him.</p>

<p>The moonlight, shining from the low moon near the eastern
horizon, crept beneath the trees and lighted the ground upon which
Blake lay and beyond him for a dozen yards and more.</p>

<p>Presently into this moonlit space stepped a great leopard.</p>

<p>Blake saw the blazing eyes, felt them burning into him like
fire. He could not tear his own from the great snarling figure,
where they were held in awful fascination.</p>

<p>The carnivore crouched and crept closer. Inch by inch it crept
upon him as though with the studied cruelty of premeditated
torture. He saw the sinuous tail lashing from side to side. He saw
the great fangs bared. He saw the beast flatten against the ground,
its muscles tensed. It was about to spring! Helpless, horrified,
Blake could not take his eyes from the hideous, snarling face.</p>

<p>He saw it leap suddenly with the lightness and agility of a
house cat, and at the same instant he saw something flash through
the air. The leopard stopped in mid-leap and was hauled upward into
a tree that overhung the spot.</p>

<p>He saw the shadowy form that he had seen before, but now he saw
that it was a man and that he was hauling the leopard upward by a
rope that had been cast about its neck at the instant that it had
risen to leap upon him.</p>

<p>Screaming, pawing with raking talons, Sheeta the leopard was
dragged upward. A mighty hand reached out and grasped the great cat
by the scruff of the neck and another hand drove a knife blade into
the savage heart.</p>

<p>When Sheeta ceased to struggle, and hung quiet, the hand
released its grasp and the dead body of the carnivore thudded to
the ground beside Blake. Then the god-like figure of an almost
naked white man dropped lightly to the leafy mold.</p>

<p>Blake voiced an exclamation of surprised delight. "Tarzan of the
Apes!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Blake?" demanded the ape-man, and then: "At last! And I didn't
find you much too soon, either."</p>

<p>"I'll tell the world you didn't!" exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p>Tarzan cut the bonds that held the American.</p>

<p>"You've been looking for me?" asked Blake.</p>

<p>"Ever since I learned that you had become separated from your
safari."</p>

<p>"By George, that was white of you!"</p>

<p>"Who left you trussed up here?"</p>

<p>"A bunch of Arabs."</p>

<p>Something like a growl escaped the lips of the ape-man. "That
villainous old Ibn Jad here?" he demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>"They took a girl who was with me," said Blake. "I do not need
to ask you to help me rescue her, I know."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"There." Blake pointed toward the south.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"About an hour ago."</p>

<p>"You'd better shed that armor," advised Tarzan, "it makes
walking a punishment&mdash;I just tried it."</p>

<p>With the ape-man's help Blake got out of his coat of mail and
then the two set out upon the plain trail of the Arabs. At the
point where Ibn Jad had turned back toward the north they were at a
loss to know which of the two spoors to follow, for here the
footprints of Guinalda, that the ape-man had been able to pick up
from time to time since they left the spot where the girl had been
seized, disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>They wondered what had become of them. They could not know that
here, when she found that Ibn Jad was going to turn back with her
away from Nimmr, she had refused to walk farther. It had been all
right as long as they were approaching Nimmr, but she refused
absolutely to be a party to her own abduction when it led away from
home.</p>

<p>What breeze there was was blowing from the east, nullifying the
value of Tarzan's sense of smell so that even the great ape-man
could not know in what direction or with which party Guinalda had
been carried off.</p>

<p>"The most reasonable assumption," said Tarzan, "is that your
princess is with the party that has gone north, for I know that Ibn
Jad's <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> must
lay in that direction. He did not enter the valley from the south.
That I know because I just came in that way myself and Sir Bertram
assured me that there are only two entrances&mdash;the one through
which I came and a pass above the City of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>"Ibn Jad would want to get the girl out of the valley and into
his camp as soon as possible whether he is going to hold her for
ransom or take her north to sell her. The party that went south
toward Nimmr may have been sent to treat with her people for a
ransom; but the chances are that she is not with that party.</p>

<p>"However, it is at best but a matter of conjecture. We must
ascertain definitely, and I suggest that you follow the northern
spoor, which is, I am certain, the one that will lead to the girl,
while I overtake the party to the south.</p>

<p>"I can travel faster than you and if I am right and the girl is
with the northern party I'll turn back and overtake you without
much loss of time. If you catch up with the other band and find the
girl is not with them, you can turn back and join me; but if she is
with them you'd better not risk trying to recover her until you
have help, for you are unarmed and those Beduins would think no
more of cutting your throat than they would of drinking a cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>"Now, good-bye and good luck!" And Tarzan of the Apes set off at
a trot upon the trail of the party that had gone in the direction
of Nimmr, while Blake turned northward to face a dismal journey
through the black depths of the Wood of the Leopards.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; "FOR EVERY JEWEL A
DROP OF BLOOD!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ALL night Ibn Jad and his party marched northward.
Though they were hampered by the refusal of Guinalda to walk, yet
they made rapid progress for they were spurred on by their great
desire to escape from the valley with their booty before they
should be discovered and set upon by the great host of fighting men
they were now convinced were quartered in the castle and city they
had been fortunate enough to find almost deserted.</p>

<p>Avarice gave them strength and endurance far beyond that which
they normally displayed, with the result that dawn found them at
the foot of the ragged mountains that Ibn Jad had determined to
scale rather than attempt an assault upon the castle which guarded
the easy way from the valley.</p>

<p>It was a jaded party that won eventually to the pass just above
the outer barbican that guarded the road to the City of the
Sepulcher, nor were they discovered by the warders there until the
last man of them was safely on the trail leading to the low saddle
at the summit of the mountains, beyond which lay the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
the Beduins.</p>

<p>The defenders of the barbican made a sortie against them and
approached their rear so closely that the knight who commanded saw
Guinalda and recognized her, but a volley from the matchlocks of
the desert people sent the crudely armed soldiers of Bohun back in
retreat, though the brave knight couched his lance and charged
again until his horse was brought down by a bullet and he lay
pinned beneath it.</p>

<p>It was afternoon before Ibn Jad with his fagged company
staggered into the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>.
Though they dropped in their tracks from sheer exhaustion, he
allowed them but an hour of sleep before he gave the signal for the
<a title="journey, trek, expedition"><i>rahla</i></a>, for the
sheikh of the <a title="tribe"><i>fendy</i></a> el-Guad was filled
with an ever increasing fear that the treasure and the woman would
be taken away from him before he could reach the sandy wastes of
his own barren <a title="village"><i>beled</i></a>.</p>

<p>The heavy weight of the treasure had been divided into several
bundles and these were distributed among his least mistrusted
followers, while the custody of the girl captive was placed in the
hands of Fahd, whose evil eyes filled the princess with fear and
loathing.</p>

<p>Stimbol, who had secretly scoffed at the stories of treasure and
the mad tales of a beautiful woman that the Arabs expected to find
in some fabulous, hidden city, was dumbfounded when he viewed the
spoils of the Beduin, and at first was inclined to attribute them
to the hallucinations of his fever-racked brain.</p>

<p>Weak, Stimbol staggered feebly along the trail, keeping as close
to Fahd as he could, for he knew that of all the company this
unscrupulous scoundrel would be most likely to assist him, for to
Fahd a live Stimbol meant great wealth; nor was Fahd unmindful of
the fact. And now there was another purpose in the evil mind of the
Beduin who had conceived for the white girl an infatuation that was
driving him to the verge of madness.</p>

<p>With the wealth that Stimbol had promised him Fahd realized that
he could afford to possess this lovely <a title=
"one of the beautiful virgins of the Koranic paradise; a voluptuous, alluring woman">
<i>houri</i></a> whom otherwise a poor <a title=
"Beduin"><i>Beduwy</i></a> must sell for the great price that she
would bring, and so there revolved in the mind of Fahd many schemes
whereby he might hope to gain sole possession of both Guinalda and
Stimbol; but always there loomed in the path of every plan that he
considered the dour figure of his greedy sheikh.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Mountains of the Sepulcher Ibn Jad turned
toward the east, thus to avoid passing again through the country of
Batando. Beyond the eastern end of the range he would turn south
again and later strike west just above the northern limits of the
territory that was nominally Tarzan's, for though he knew that the
Lord of the Jungle was dead he yet feared the vengeance of his
people.</p>

<p>It was late before Ibn Jad made camp. The preparations for the
evening meal were hurried. The light from the cooking fire and the
paper lanterns in the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of the sheikh
was dim and flickering, yet not so dim but that Ateja saw Fahd drop
something into the bowl of food that she had prepared for Ibn Jad
and which stood upon the ground between him and his would-be
assassin.</p>

<p>As the sheikh reached for the receptacle Ateja stepped from the
women's quarters and struck it from his hand, but before she could
explain her act or charge Fahd with his villainy the culprit,
realizing that his perfidy had been discovered, leaped to his feet
and seizing his matchlock sprang into the women's quarters where
Guinalda had been left under the watchful care of Hirfa and
Ateja.</p>

<p>Seizing the girl by the wrist and dragging her after him Fahd
broke through the curtains at the rear of the <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and ran in the direction of his own tent. By
this time the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
of Ibn Jad was in an uproar. The sheikh was demanding an
explanation from Ateja and still unaware that Fahd had escaped
through the rear of the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> no one had
followed him into the women's quarters.</p>

<p>"He placed <a title="poison"><i>simm</i></a> in thy food!" cried
Ateja. "I saw him and the proof of it be that he fled when he knew
that I had seen."</p>

<p>"<a title="By God!"><i>Billah</i></a>," exclaimed Ibn Jad. "The
son of a jackal would poison me? Seize him and fetch him to
me!"</p>

<p>"He hath fled through the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>!"
cried Hirfa, "and taken the <a title=
"infidel, Christian woman"><i>Nasrania</i></a> with him."</p>

<p>The Beduins sprang to their feet and took after Fahd, but at his
own <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> he stopped them with a bullet
and they retreated. In his tent he seized Stimbol who was lying
upon a filthy sleeping mat and dragged him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hasten!" he hissed in the American's ear. "Ibn Jad has ordered
that thou be slain! Quick! follow me and I will save thee."</p>

<p>Again Fahd had recourse to the rear curtains of a <a title=
"tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and as his fellows approached the front in
anger but with caution, Fahd, dragging Guinalda and followed by
Stimbol, sneaked through the darkness of the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> and
turned toward the west.</p>

<p><br>IT was dusk when James Blake, following the plain trail of Ibn
Jad, finally clambered over the last escarpment and stood upon the
trail that led through the pass toward the outer world beyond the
valley of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>A hundred yards to his right loomed the gray towers of the
barbican, to his left was the trail that led in the direction of
his heart's desire, and all about him, concealed in the bushes,
were the men-at-arms of King Bohun of the Sepulcher; but this he
did not guess, for how could he know that for hours the eyes of the
warders had been watching his slow ascent toward the pass
trail?</p>

<p>Spent by the long climb following hours of grueling exertion
without food or rest, unarmed, Blake was helpless to resist or to
attempt escape when a dozen armed men stepped from the surrounding
bushes and encircled him in a band of steel. And so Sir James of
Nimmr was seized and haled before King Bohun, and when he was
questioned and Bohun found that he was the same black knight that
had thwarted his plan to abduct the Princess Guinalda he could
scarce contain himself.</p>

<p>Assuring Blake only of the fact that he would be put to death as
soon as Bohun could determine upon a fate commensurate with the
heinousness of the crime, the king ordered him to be placed in
chains, and the American was led away by guards to a black hole
beneath the castle, where by the light of flares a smith forged a
heavy iron band about one ankle and he was chained to a damp stone
wall.</p>

<p>In the light of the flare Blake saw two emaciated, naked
creatures similarly chained, and in a far corner glimpsed a
skeleton among the bones of which rusted a length of chain and a
great anklet. Then silently the guards and the smith departed,
taking the flares with them, and James Blake was left in darkness
and despair.</p>

<p><br>UPON the plain, below the City of Nimmr, Tarzan had overtaken
the party of Beduins led by Abd el-Aziz, and after assuring himself
that the girl was not with them he had turned without revealing
himself to them and hurried northward to take up the trail of the
other party.</p>

<p>Requiring food and rest he lay up in the Wood of the Leopards
during the heat of the day after stalking Horta the boar and making
a quick kill. His belly filled, the ape-man found a high-flung tree
crotch where there was little likelihood of the heavy leopards of
Nimmr disturbing his slumbers, and here he slept until the sun was
sinking behind the western <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>
where Ibn Jad's people had camped during his incursion of the
Valley of the Sepulcher.</p>

<p>Some time since, he had lost the spoor of Blake, but that of the
girl frequently recurred, and as her rescue now took precedence
over other considerations he followed doggedly along the trail of
Ibn Jad. For a time he was mystified by the fact that Guinalda's
spoor, well marked by the imprints of the tiny sandals of medieval
design, did not appear among the footprints of those who left the
Beduin <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a>.</p>

<p>He lost some time searching about in an effort to discover a
clue to the riddle and presently he hit upon the truth, which lay
in the fact that Guinalda's light sandals having been badly worn by
her journey and far too tight for comfortable walking she had been
given a pair belonging to Ateja, and thus it became difficult to
differentiate between the spoor of the two girls, who were of equal
weight and of a similarity of carriage that rendered their
footprints practically identical.</p>

<p>Tarzan therefore contented himself with following the spoor of
the party, and so it was that he passed their first night's camp,
where Fahd had stolen Guinalda from the Sheikh, without discovering
that three of its members had there turned to the west, while the
main body of the Arabs marched toward the east.</p>

<p><br>AND as Tarzan followed the spoor of Ibn Jad a hundred stalwart
Waziri moved northward from the water hole of the smooth, round
rocks upon the old trail of the Beduins. With them was Zeyd, who
had begged so hard to accompany them when they passed the village
where he had been waiting that at last the sub-chief had
consented.</p>

<p>WHEN Tarzan overtook the Arabs they had already turned south
around the eastern end of the Mountains of the Sepulcher. He saw
the bags they carried and the evident concern with which Ibn Jad
watched and guarded them, and he shrewdly guessed that the wily old
thief had indeed found the treasure he had sought; but he saw no
evidence of the presence of the Princess, and Stimbol, too, was
missing.</p>

<p>Tarzan was furious. He was furious at the thieving Beduins for
daring to invade his country and he was furious at himself because
he felt that in some way he had been tricked.</p>

<p>Tarzan had his own methods of inflicting punishment upon his
enemies and he had, as well, his own grim and grisly sense of
humor. When men were doing wrong it pleased him to take advantage
of whatever might cause them the greatest suffering and in this he
was utterly ruthless with his enemies.</p>

<p>He was confident that the Arabs thought him dead and it did not
suit his whim to reveal their error to them at this time, but it
did accord with his fancy to let them commence to feel the weight
of his displeasure and taste the first fruits of their
villainy.</p>

<p>Moving silently through the trees Tarzan paralleled the course
of the Arabs. They were often plainly visible to him; but none saw
Tarzan, nor dreamed that savage eyes were watching their every
move.</p>

<p>Five men carried the treasure, though its weight was not so
great but that one powerful man might have borne it for a short
distance. Tarzan watched these men most often, these and the Sheikh
Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>The trail was wide and the sheikh walked beside one of those who
bore the treasure. It was very quiet in the jungle. Even the Arabs,
garrulous among themselves, were quiet, for they were very tired
and the day was hot and they were unused to the burdens they were
forced to carry since Batando had robbed them of their slaves.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, without warning and with only the swish of its
flight through the air to announce it, an arrow passed through the
neck of the Beduin who walked beside Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>With a scream the man lunged forward upon his face and the
Arabs, warned by their sheikh, cocked their muskets and prepared to
receive an attack, but look where they would they saw no sign of an
enemy. They waited, listening, but there was no sound other than
the droning of insects and the occasional raucous cry of a bird;
but when they moved on again, leaving their fellow dead upon the
trail, a hollow voice called to them from a distance.</p>

<p><i>"For every jewel a drop of blood!"</i> it wailed dismally,
for its author knew well the intensely superstitious nature of the
desert dwellers and how best to affright them.</p>

<p>It was a shaken column that continued on its way, nor was there
any mention of making camp until almost sunset, so anxious were
they all to leave behind this gloomy wood and the horrid <a title=
"Arabic&mdash;a powerful evil spirit, a monstrous demon"><i>afrit</i></a>
that inhabited it; but the forest persisted and at length it became
necessary to make camp.</p>

<p>Here the camp fires and food relieved the tension upon their
overwrought nerves, and their spirits had revived to such an extent
that there were again singing and laughter in the <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> of
Ibn Jad.</p>

<p>The old sheikh himself sat in his <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
surrounded by the five bags of treasure, one of which he had opened
and beneath the light of a lantern was fondling the contents. About
him were his cronies, sipping their coffee.</p>

<p>Suddenly something fell heavily upon the ground before the
<a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> and rolled into the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
among them. It was the severed head of a man! Glaring up at them
were the dead eyes of their fellow, whose corpse they had left
lying in the trail earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Horror struck, spellbound, they sat staring at the gruesome
thing when, from out of the dark forest, came the hollow voice
again: <i>"For every jewel a drop of blood!"</i></p>

<p>Ibn Jad shook as a man with ague. The men of the camp gathered
close together in front of the <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a> of
the sheikh. Each grasped a musket in one hand and searched for his
<a title=
"In this conext an amulet with an invocation from the Koran; more usually, a headscarf worn by Muslim women,">
<i>hijab</i></a> with the other, for each carried several of these
amulets, and that in demand this night was the one written against
the <a title=
"an intelligent spirit able to appear in human or animal form"><i>jinn</i></a>,
for certainly none but a <a title=
"an intelligent spirit able to appear in human or animal form"><i>jinn</i></a>
could have done this thing.</p>

<p>Hirfa stood half within the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>
staring at the dead face of her fellow while Ateja crouched upon a
sleeping mat in the quarters of the women. She did not see the back
curtain rise, nor the figure that crept within. It was dark in the
quarters of the harem since little light filtered in from the
lanterns in the <a title=
"the section of a Beduin tent reserved for use by men"><i>mukaad</i></a>.</p>

<p>Ateja felt a hand clapped across her mouth at the same instant
that another grasped her by the shoulder. A voice whispered in her
ear. "Make no sound! I shall not hurt thee. I am a friend to Zeyd.
Tell me the truth and no harm will befall thee or him. Where is the
woman Ibn Jad brought from the valley?"</p>

<p>He who held her placed his ear close to her lips and removed his
hand from them. Ateja trembled like a leaf. She had never seen a
<a title=
"an intelligent spirit able to appear in human or animal form"><i>jinn</i></a>.
She could not see the creature that leaned close to her, but she
knew that it was one of those fearsome creatures of the night.</p>

<p>"Answer!" whispered the voice in her ear. "If thou wouldst save
Zeyd, speak and speak the truth!"</p>

<p>"Fahd took the woman from our <a title=
"encampment; also residence, dwelling place"><i>menzil</i></a> last
night," she gasped. "I do not know where they went."</p>

<p>As it came, in silence the presence left the side of the
terrified girl. When Hirfa sought her a moment later she found her
in a swoon.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; BRIDE OF THE APE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BLAKE squatted upon the stone floor in the utter
darkness of his dungeon. After his jailers had left he had spoken
to his fellow prisoners, but only one had replied and his jibbering
tones assured the American that the poor wretch had been reduced to
stark insanity by the horrors of imprisonment in this foul
hole.</p>

<p>The young man, accustomed to freedom, light, activity, already
felt the hideousness of his position and wondered how long it would
be before he, too, jibbered incoherently at the end of a rusting
chain, how long before he, too, was but mildewed bones upon a
clammy floor.</p>

<p>In utter darkness and in utter silence there is no time, for
there is no means by which one may compute the passage of time. How
long Blake crouched in the stifling air of his dank dungeon he
could not know. He slept once, but whether he had dozed for an
instant or slept the clock around he could not even hazard a guess.
And of what moment was it? A second, a day, a year meant nothing
here. There were only two things that could mean anything to Jim
Blake now&mdash;freedom or death. He knew that it would not be long
before he would welcome the latter.</p>

<p>A sound disturbed the silence of the buried vault. Footsteps
were approaching. Blake listened as they came nearer. Presently he
discerned a flickering light that grew in intensity until a pine
torch illuminated the interior of his prison. At first it blinded
his eyes so that he could not see who came, bearing the light, but
whoever it was crossed and stopped before him.</p>

<p>Blake looked up, his eyes more accustomed to the unwonted
brilliance, and saw two knights standing before him.</p>

<p>"It is he," said one.</p>

<p>"Dost thou not know us, Sir Black Knight?" demanded the
other.</p>

<p>Blake looked at them closely. A slow smile lighted his face, as
he saw a great bandage wrapped about the neck of the younger
man.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "here is where I get mine."</p>

<p>"Get thine! What meanest thou?" demanded the older man.</p>

<p>"Well, you two certainly haven't come to pin any medals on me,
Sir Wildred," said Blake, with a wry smile.</p>

<p>"Thou speakest in riddles," said Wildred. "We have come to free
thee that the young king may not bring disgrace upon the Knights of
the Sepulcher by carrying out his wicked will with thee. Sir Guy
and I heard that he would burn thee at the stake, and we said to
one another that while blood flowed in our bodies we would not let
so valorous a knight be thus shamelessly wronged by any
tyrant."</p>

<p>As he spoke Wildred stooped and with a great rasp commenced
filing upon the iron rivets that held the hinged anklet in
place.</p>

<p>"You are going to help me to escape!" exclaimed Blake. "But
suppose you are discovered&mdash;will not the king punish you?"</p>

<p>"We shall not be discovered," said Wildred, "though I would take
that chance for so noble a knight as thee. Sir Guy is upon the
outer barbican this night and 'twill be no trick to get thee that
far. He can pass thee through and thou canst make thy way down the
mountain side and cross to Nimmr. We cannot get thee through the
city gates for these be held by two of Bohun's basest creatures,
but perchance upon the morrow Sir Guy or I may find the way to ride
out upon the plain with a led horse, and that we shall if so it hap
that it be possible."</p>

<p>"Tell us a thing that hath filled us with questioning," said Sir
Guy.</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," said Blake.</p>

<p>"Thou didst, and mighty prettily too, take the Princess Guinalda
from under the very nose of Bohun," continued Guy, "and yet later
she was seen in the clutches of the Saracens. How came this to
pass?"</p>

<p>"She was seen?" demanded Blake. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Beyond the outer barbican she was and the Saracens carried her
away through the pass that leadeth no man knoweth where," said
Wildred.</p>

<p>Blake told them of all that had transpired since he had taken
Guinalda from Bohun, and by the time he had finished the rivets had
been cut and he stood again a free man.</p>

<p>Wildred smuggled him through secret passages to his own quarters
and there gave him food and new clothing and a suit of armor, for
now that they knew he was riding out over the pass into the strange
country they had decided that he could only be permitted to do so
properly armored, armed and mounted.</p>

<p>It was midnight when Wildred smuggled Blake through the castle
gate and rode with him toward the outer barbican. There Sir Guy met
them and a few minutes later Blake bid these chivalrous enemies
goodbye and, mounted on a powerful charger, his own colors flying
from his lance tip, rode beneath the portcullis and out upon the
starlit road that led to the summit of the Mountains of the
Sepulcher.</p>

<p><br>TOYAT, the king ape, picked a succulent beetle from the decaying
bark of a fallen tree. About him were the great, savage people of
his tribe. It was afternoon and the apes loafed in the shade of
great trees beside a little natural clearing in the jungle. They
were content and at peace with all the world. Coming toward them
were three people, but the wind blew from the apes toward the
people and so neither Toyat nor any of his fellows caught the scent
spoor of the Tarmangani. The jungle trail was soft with damp mold,
for it had rained the night before, and the feet of the three gave
forth no sound that the apes heard. Then, too, the three were
moving cautiously for they had not eaten for two days and they were
hunting for food.</p>

<p>There was a gray old man, emaciated by fever, tottering along
with the aid of a broken tree branch; there was a wicked-eyed
Beduin carrying a long musket; and the third was a girl whose
strange garments of splendid stuffs were torn and soiled. Her face
was streaked with dirt and was drawn and thin, yet still it was a
face of almost heavenly beauty. She walked with an effort, and
though she sometimes stumbled from weariness never did she lose a
certain regalness of carriage, nor lower the haughty elevation of
her well-moulded chin.</p>

<p>The Beduin was in the lead. It was he who first sighted a young
ape playing at the edge of the clearing, farthest from the great
bulls of the tribe of Toyat. Here was food! The Beduin raised his
ancient weapon and took aim. He pressed the trigger and the ensuing
roar mingled with the scream of pain and terror that burst from the
wounded balu.</p>

<p>Instantly the great bulls leaped to action. Would they flee the
feared and hated thunder stick of the Tarmangani, or would they
avenge the hurting of the balu? Who might know? Today they might do
the one, tomorrow, under identical circumstances, the other. Today
they chose vengeance.</p>

<p>Led by Toyat, growling hideously, the bulls lumbered forward to
investigate. It was this sight that met the horrified gaze of the
three as they followed up Fahd's shot to learn if at last they were
to eat or if they must plod on hopelessly, weakened by the hunger
gnawing at their vitals.</p>

<p>Fahd and Stimbol turned and bolted back down the trail, the
Arab, in his cowardly haste, pushing Guinalda to one side and
hurling her to the ground. The leading bull, seeing the girl,
leaped upon her and was about to sink his teeth into her neck when
Toyat seized him and dragged him from her, for Toyat had recognized
her for what she was. The king ape had once seen another Tarmangani
she and had decided that he would like to have one as a wife.</p>

<p>The other ape, a huge bull, seeing that Toyat wanted the prey
and angered by the bullying manner of the king, immediately decided
to contest Toyat's right to what he had first claimed. Baring his
fangs he advanced menacingly toward Toyat who had dragged the girl
back into the clearing. Toyat snarled back at him. "Go away," said
Toyat. "This is Toyat's she."</p>

<p>"It is Go-yad's," replied the other, advancing. Toyat turned
back. "I kill!" he screamed. Go-yad came on and suddenly Toyat
seized Guinalda in his hairy arms and fled into the jungle. Behind
him, bellowing and screaming, pursued Go-yad.</p>

<p>The Princess Guinalda, wide-eyed with horror, fought to free
herself from the hideous, hairy creature that was bearing her off.
She had never seen nor even heard of such a thing as a great ape,
and she thought them now some hideous, low inhabitant of that outer
world that she had always been taught consisted of encircling
armies of Saracens and beyond and at a great distance a wonderful
country known as England. What else was there she had not even
tried to guess, but evidently it was a horrid place peopled by
hideous creatures, including dragons.</p>

<p>Toyat had run no great distance when he realized that he could
not escape while burdened with the she, and as he had no mind to
give her up he turned suddenly and faced the roaring Go-yad. Go-yad
did not stop. He came on frothing at the mouth, bristling,
snarling&mdash;a picture of bestial savagery, power and frenzied
rage.</p>

<p>Toyat, relinquishing his hold upon the girl, advanced to meet
the charge of his rebellious subject, while Guinalda, weakened by
unaccustomed exertion and lack of nourishment, appalled by the
hideous circumstances of her plight, sank panting to the
ground.</p>

<p>Toyat and Go-yad, immersed in the prospect of battle, were
oblivious to all else. Could Guinalda have taken advantage of this
temporary forgetfulness of her she might have escaped; but she was
too stunned, too exhausted to take advantage of her opportunity.
Spellbound, fascinated by the horror of it, she watched these
terrifying, primordial man-beasts preparing to do battle for
possession of her.</p>

<p>Nor was Guinalda the sole witness of these savage preliminaries.
From the concealment of a low bush behind which he lay another
watched the scene with steady, interested eyes. Absorbed by their
own passion neither Toyat nor Go-yad noted the occasional movement
of the outer leaves of the bush behind which this other watcher
lay, a movement imparted by the body of the watcher with each
breath and with each slightest change of position.</p>

<p>Perhaps the watcher discovered no sporting interest in the
impending duel, for just as the two apes were about to engage he
arose and stepped into the open&mdash;a great black-maned lion,
whose yellow coat gleamed golden in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Toyat saw him first and with a growl of rage turned and fled,
leaving his adversary and their prize to whatever fate Providence
might hold in store for them.</p>

<p>Go-yad, thinking his rival had abandoned the field through fear
of him, beat loudly upon his breast and roared forth the victory
cry of the bull ape, then, swaggering as became a victor and a
champion, he turned to claim the prize.</p>

<p>Between himself and the girl he saw the lion standing, gazing
with serious mien straight into his eyes. Go-yad halted. Who would
not have? The lion was within springing distance but he was not
crouched. Go-yad backed away, snarling, and when the lion made no
move to follow, the great ape suddenly turned and lumbered off into
the jungle, casting many a backward glance in the direction of the
great cat until intervening foliage shut him from his view.</p>

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Go-yad backed away, snarling.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then the lion turned toward the girl. Poor little Princess!
Hopeless, resigned, she lay upon the ground staring, wide-eyed, at
this new engine of torture and destruction. The king of beasts
surveyed her for a moment and then walked toward her. Guinalda
clasped her hands and prayed&mdash;not for life, for hope of that
she had long since resigned, but for death, speedy and
painless.</p>

<p>The tawny beast came close. Guinalda closed her eyes to shut out
the fearsome sight. She felt hot breath upon her cheek, its fetid
odor assailed her nostrils. The lion sniffed about her. God! why
did he not end it? Tortured nerves could endure no more and
Guinalda swooned. Merciful surcease of her suffering.</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; JAD-BAL-JA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NERVE-SHAKEN, the remnants of Ibn Jad's company
turned toward the west and hastened by forced marches to escape the
hideous forest of the <a title=
"an intelligent spirit able to appear in human or animal form"><i>jinn</i></a>.
Abd el-Aziz and those who had accompanied him from the Wood of the
Leopards toward Nimmr had not rejoined them. Nor ever would they,
for upon the plain below the treasure city of the Beduins'
dreaming, the knights of Gobred had discovered them and, despite
the thundering havoc of the ancient matchlocks, the iron Knights of
Nimmr had couched their lances against the Saracens and once again
the victorious cri de guerre of the Crusaders had rung out after
seven centuries of silence to announce a new engagement in the
hoary war for the possession of the Holy Land&mdash;the war that is
without end. From the north a mailed knight rode down through the
forest of Galla land. A blue and silver pennon fluttered from his
lance. The housings of his great charger were rich with gold and
silver from the treasure vaults of Wildred of the Sepulcher.
Wide-eyed Galla warriors viewed this solitary anachron from afar,
and fled.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes, ranging westward, came upon the spoor of
Fahd and Stimbol and Guinalda and followed it toward the south.</p>

<p>Northward marched a hundred ebon giants, veterans of a hundred
battles&mdash;the famed Waziri&mdash;and with them came Zeyd, the
lover of Ateja. One day they came upon a fresh spoor crossing their
line of march diagonally toward the southwest. It was the spoor of
Arab sandals, those of two men and a woman, and when the Waziri
pointed them out to Zeyd the young Beduin swore that he recognized
those of the woman as belonging to Ateja, for who knew better the
shape and size of her little foot, or the style of the sandals she
fabricated? He begged the Waziri to turn aside for a time and aid
him in finding his sweetheart, and while the sub-chief was debating
the question in his mind the sound of something hurrying through
the jungle attracted the attention of every ear.</p>

<p>While they listened a man staggered into view. It was Fahd. Zeyd
recognized him instantly and as immediately became doubly positive
that the footprints of the woman had been made by Ateja.</p>

<p>Zeyd approached Fahd menacingly. "Where is Ateja?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"How should I know? I have not seen her for days," replied Fahd,
truthfully enough.</p>

<p>"Thou liest!" cried Zeyd, and pointed at the ground. "Here are
her own footprints beside thine!"</p>

<p>A cunning expression came into the eyes of Fahd. Here he saw an
opportunity to cause suffering to the man he hated. He shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"<i>W'Allah</i>, if you know, you know," he said.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" demanded Zeyd.</p>

<p>"She is dead. I would have spared you," answered Fahd.</p>

<p>"Dead?" The suffering in that single word should have melted a
heart of stone&mdash;but not Fahd's.</p>

<p>"I stole her from her father's <a title="tent"><i>beyt</i></a>,"
continued Fahd, wishing to inflict as much torture as possible upon
his rival. "For days and nights she was mine; then a huge ape stole
her from me. By now she must be dead."</p>

<p>But Fahd had gone too far. He had encompassed his own undoing.
With a scream of rage Zeyd leaped upon him with drawn <a title=
"an Arabian knife with an angled blade, the cutting edge being on the concave side">
<i>khusa</i></a>, and before the Waziri could interfere or Fahd
defend himself the keen blade had drunk thrice in the heart of the
lying Beduin.</p>

<p>With bent head and dull eyes Zeyd marched on northward with the
Waziri, as, a mile behind them, a wasted old man, burning with
fever, stumbled in the trail and fell. Twice he tried to regain his
feet, only to sink weakly back to earth. A filthy, ragged bundle of
old bones, he lay&mdash;sometimes raving in delirium, sometimes so
still that he seemed dead.</p>

<p>Down from the north came Tarzan of the Apes upon the spoor of
Guinalda and the two who had accompanied her. Knowing well the
windings of the trail he took short cuts, swinging through the
branches of the trees, and so it happened that he missed the Waziri
at the point where their trail had encountered that of Fahd, where
Zeyd had slain his rival, and presently his nostrils picked up the
scent of the Mangani in the distance.</p>

<p>Toward the great apes he made his way swiftly for he feared that
harm might befall the girl should she, by any mischance, fall into
the hands of the anthropoids. He arrived in the clearing where they
lazed, a short time after the return of Toyat and Go-yad, who, by
now, had abandoned their quarrel, since the prize had been taken by
one stronger than either of them.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of meeting over and the apes having recognized
and acknowledged Tarzan, he demanded if any had seen the Tarmangani
she who had recently passed through the jungle.</p>

<p>M'walat pointed at Toyat and Tarzan turned toward the King.</p>

<p>"You have seen the she?" demanded Tarzan, fearful, for he did
not like the manner of the king ape.</p>

<p>Toyat jerked a thumb toward the south. "Numa," he said and went
on hunting for food, but Tarzan knew what the ape meant as surely
as though he had spoken a hundred words of explanation.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Toyat pointed straight to where he had abandoned Guinalda to the
lion, and the ape-man, moving straight through the jungle along the
line indicated by the king ape, went sadly to investigate, although
he already guessed what he would find. At least he could drive Numa
from his kill and give decent burial to the unfortunate girl.</p>

<p><br>SLOWLY consciousness returned to Guinalda. She did not open her
eyes, but lay very quiet wondering if this was death. She felt no
pain.</p>

<p>Presently a sickly sweet and pungent odor assailed her nostrils
and something moved very close to her, so close that she felt it
against her body, pressing gently, and where it pressed she felt
heat as from another body.</p>

<p>Fearfully she opened her eyes and the horror of her predicament
again swept over her for she saw that the lion had lain down almost
against her. His back was toward her, his noble head was lifted,
his black mane almost brushed her face. He was looking off,
intently, toward the north.</p>

<p>Guinalda lay very quiet. Presently she felt, rather than heard,
a low rumbling growl that seemed to have its origin deep in the
cavernous chest of the carnivore.</p>

<p>Something was coming! Even Guinalda sensed that, but it could
not be succor, for what could succor her from this hideous
beast?</p>

<p>There was a rustling among the branches of the trees a hundred
feet away and suddenly the giant figure of a demigod dropped to the
ground. The lion rose and faced the man. The two stood thus, eying
one another for a brief moment. Then the man spoke.</p>

<p>"Jad-bal-ja!" he exclaimed, and then: "Come to heel!"</p>

<p>The great, golden lion whined and strode across the open space,
stopping before the man. Guinalda saw the beast look up into the
face of the demigod and saw the latter stroke the tawny head
affectionately, but meanwhile the eyes of the man, or god, or
whatever he was, were upon Guinalda and she saw the sudden relief
that came to them as Tarzan realized that the girl was
unharmed.</p>

<p>Leaving the lion the ape-man crossed to where the princess lay
and knelt beside her.</p>

<p>"You are the Princess Guinalda?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, wondering how he knew her. As yet she was too
stunned to command her own voice.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," he assured her in a gentle voice. "I am your
friend. You are safe now."</p>

<p>There was something in the way he said it that filled Guinalda
with such a sense of safety as all the mailed knights of her
father's realm had scarce imparted.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid&mdash;any more," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Where are your companions?" he asked.</p>

<p>She told him all that had happened.</p>

<p>"You are well rid of them," said the ape-man, "and we shall not
attempt to find them. The jungle will account for them in its own
way and in its own good time."</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan."</p>

<p>"How didst thou know my name?" she queried.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of one whom you know as Sir James," he explained.
"He and I were searching for you."</p>

<p>"Thou art his friend?" she cried. "Oh, sweet sir, then thou art
mine as well!"</p>

<p>The ape-man smiled. "Always!" he said.</p>

<p>"Why did the lion not kill thee, Sir Tarzan?" she demanded,
thinking him a simple knight, for in her land there were only these
beside the members of her princely house and the pseudo king of the
City of the Sepulcher. For in the original company that had been
wrecked upon the coast of Africa at the time of the Third Crusade
there were only knights, except one bastard son of Henry II, who
had been the original Prince Gobred. Never having been in contact
with an English king since they parted from Richard at Cyprus
Gobred had assumed the right to issue patents of nobility to his
followers, solely the prerogative of the king.</p>

<p>"Why did the lion not kill me?" repeated Tarzan. "Because he is
Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, which I raised from cubhood. All his
life he has known me only as friend and master. He would not harm
me and it was because of his lifelong association with human beings
that he did not harm you; though I was fearful when I saw him
beside you that he had&mdash;a lion is always a lion!"</p>

<p>"Thou dwellest nearby?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Far away," said Tarzan, "But there must be some of my people
nearby, else Jad-bal-ja would not be here. I sent for my warriors
and doubtless he has accompanied them."</p>

<p>Finding that the girl was hungry Tarzan bade the Golden Lion
remain and guard her while he went in search of food.</p>

<p>"Do not fear him," he told her, "and remember that you could not
have a protector more competent than he to discourage the approach
of enemies."</p>

<p>"And well may I believe it," admitted Guinalda.</p>

<p>Tarzan returned with food and then, as the day was not done, he
started back toward Nimmr with the rescued girl, carrying her, as
she was now too weak to walk; and beside them strode the great,
black-maned lion of gold.</p>

<p>During that journey Tarzan learned much of Nimmr and also
discovered that Blake's love for his princess was apparently fully
reciprocated by the girl, for she seemed never so content as when
talking about her Sir James and asking questions concerning his far
country and his past life, of which, unfortunately, Tarzan could
tell her nothing.</p>

<p>Upon the second day the three came to the great cross and here
Tarzan hailed the warders and bade them come and take their
princess.</p>

<p>She urged the ape-man to accompany her to the castle and receive
the thanks of her father and mother, but he told her that he must
leave at once to search for Blake, and at that she ceased her
urging.</p>

<p>"An' thou findest him," she said, "tell him that the gates of
Nimmr are always open to him and that the Princess Guinalda awaits
his return."</p>

<p>Down from the cross went Tarzan and Jad-bal-ja and before she
turned back to enter the tunnel that led to her father's castle the
Princess Guinalda stood watching them until a turn in the trail hid
them from her view.</p>

<p>"May Our Lord Jesus bless thee, sweet sir knight," she murmured,
"and watch o'er thee and fetch thee back once more with my
beloved!"</p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; WHERE TRAILS MET</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DOWN through the forest rode Blake searching for
some clue to the whereabouts of the Arabs, ranging this way and
that, following trails and abandoning them.</p>

<p>Late one day he came suddenly into a large clearing where once a
native village had stood. The jungle had not yet reclaimed it and
as he entered it he saw a leopard crouching upon the far side, and
before the leopard lay the body of a human being. At first Blake
thought the poor creature dead, but presently he saw it attempt to
rise and crawl away.</p>

<p>The great cat growled and advanced toward it. Blake shouted and
spurred forward, but Sheeta paid no attention to him, evidently
having no mind to give up its prey; but as Blake came nearer the
cat turned to face him with an angry growl.</p>

<p>The American wondered if his horse would dare the close
proximity of the beast of prey, but he need not have feared. Nor
would he, had he been more fully acquainted with the customs of the
Valley of the Sepulcher, where one of the greatest sports of the
knights of the two enemy cities is hunting the giant cats with
lance alone when they venture from the sanctuary of the Wood of the
Leopards.</p>

<p>The charger that Blake bestrode had faced many a savage cat, and
larger, too, by far than this one, and so he fell into his charging
stride with no show of fear or nervousness and the two thundered
down upon Sheeta while the creature that was to have been its prey
looked on with wide, astounded eyes.</p>

<p>Within the length of its spring Sheeta rose swiftly to meet the
horse and man. He leaped and as he leaped he struck full on the
metal tip of the great lance, and the wooden shaft passed through
him so far that it was with difficulty that the man forced the
carcass from it. When he had done so he turned and rode to the side
of the creature lying helpless on the ground.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried as his eyes rested on the face below him.
"Stimbol!"</p>

<p>"Blake!"</p>

<p>The younger man dismounted.</p>

<p>"I'm dying, Blake," whispered Stimbol. "Before I go I want to
tell you that I'm sorry. I acted like a cad. I guess I've got what
was coming to me."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Stimbol," said Blake. "You're not dead yet.
The first thing is to get you where there are food and water." He
stooped and lifted the emaciated form and placed the man in his
saddle. "I passed a small native village a few miles back. They all
ran when they saw me, but we'll try there for food."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Stimbol. "And in the name of
King Arthur, where did you get the outfit?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about it when we get to the village," said Blake.
"It's a long story. I'm looking for a girl that was stolen by the
Arabs a few days ago."</p>

<p>"God!" ejaculated Stimbol.</p>

<p>"You know something about her?" demanded Blake.</p>

<p>"I was with the man that stole her," said Stimbol, "or at least
who stole her from the other Arabs."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She's dead, Blake!"</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>"A bunch of those big anthropoid apes got her. The poor child
must have been killed immediately."</p>

<p>Blake was silent for a long time, walking with bowed head as,
weighted down by heavy armor, he led the horse along the trail.</p>

<p>"Did the Arabs harm her?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"No," said Stimbol. "The sheikh stole her either for ransom or
to sell her in the north, but Fahd stole her for himself. He took
me along because I had promised him a lot of money if he'd save me,
and I kept him from harming the girl by telling him that he'd never
get a cent from me if he did. I felt sorry for the poor child and I
made up my mind that I was going to save her if I could."</p>

<p>When Blake and Stimbol approached the village the blacks fled,
leaving the white men in full possession of the place. It did not
take Blake long to find food for them both.</p>

<p>Making Stimbol as comfortable as possible, Blake found fodder
for his horse and presently returned to the old man. He was engaged
in narrating his experiences when he was suddenly aware of the
approach of many people. He could hear voices and the pad of naked
feet. Evidently the villagers were returning.</p>

<p>Blake prepared to meet them with friendly overtures, but the
first glimpse he had of the approaching party gave him a distinct
shock, for these were not the frightened villagers he had seen
scurrying into the jungle a short time before.</p>

<p>With white plumes waving about their heads a company of stalwart
warriors came swinging down the trail. Great oval shields were upon
their backs, long war spears in their hands.</p>

<p>"Well," said Blake, "I guess we're in for it. The villagers have
sent for their big brothers."</p>

<p>The warriors entered the village and when they saw Blake they
halted in evident wonder. One of their number approached him and to
Blake's surprise addressed him in fairly good English.</p>

<p>"We are the Waziri of Tarzan," he said. "We search for our chief
and master. Have you seen him, Bwana?"</p>

<p>The Waziri! Blake could have hugged them. He had been at his
wits' end to know what he was to do with Stimbol. Alone he never
could have brought the man to civilization, but now he knew that
his worries were over.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the grief of Blake and Zeyd, it had been a
merry party that made free with the cassava and beer of the
villagers that night, for the Waziri were not worrying about their
chief.</p>

<p>"Tarzan cannot die," said the sub-chief to Blake, when the
latter asked if the other felt any fear as to the safety of his
master, and the simple conviction of the quiet words almost
succeeded in convincing Blake of their truth.</p>

<p><br>ALONG the trail plodded the weary Arabs of the Beny Salem
<a title="tribe"><i>fendy</i></a> el-Guad. Tired men staggered
beneath the weight of half-loads. The women carried even more. Ibn
Jad watched the treasure with greedy eyes. An arrow came from
nowhere and pierced the heart of a treasure bearer close before Ibn
Jad. A hollow voice sounded from the jungle: <i>"For every jewel a
drop of blood!"</i></p>

<p>Terrified, the Beduins hastened on. Who would be next? They
wanted to cast aside the treasure, but Ibn Jad, greedy, would not
let them. Behind them they caught a glimpse of a great lion. He
terrified them because he did not come nearer or go away&mdash;he
just stalked silently along behind. There were no stragglers.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The lion paced just within sight of the tail end
of the column. Never had the head of one of Ibn Jad's columns been
so much in demand. Everyone wished to go in the lead.</p>

<p>A scream burst from another treasure carrier. An arrow had
passed through his lungs. <i>"For every jewel a drop of
blood!"</i></p>

<p>The men threw down the treasure. "We will not carry the accursed
thing more!" they cried, and again the voice spoke.</p>

<p><i>"Take up the treasure, Ibn Jad!"</i> it said. <i>"Take up the
treasure! It is thou who murdered to acquire it. Pick it up, thief
and murderer, and carry it thyself!"</i></p>

<p>Together the Arabs made the treasure into one load and lifted it
to Ibn Jad's back. The old sheikh staggered beneath the weight.</p>

<p>"I cannot carry it!" he cried aloud. "I am old and I am not
strong."</p>

<p><i>"Thou canst carry it, or&mdash;die!"</i> boomed the hollow
voice, while the lion stood in the trail behind them, his eyes
glaring fixedly at them.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad staggered on beneath the great load. He could not now
travel as fast as the others and so he was left behind with only
the lion as company, but only for a short time. Ateja saw his
predicament and came back to his side, bearing a musket in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Fear not," she said, "I am not the son thou didst crave, but
yet I shall protect thee even as a son!"</p>

<p>It was almost dusk when the leaders of the Beduin company
stumbled upon a village. They were in it and surrounded by a
hundred warriors before they realized that they were in the midst
of the one tribe of all others they most feared and
dreaded&mdash;the Waziri of Tarzan.</p>

<p>The sub-chief disarmed them at once.</p>

<p>"Where is Ibn Jad?" demanded Zeyd.</p>

<p>"He cometh!" said one.</p>

<p>They looked back along the trail and presently Zeyd saw two
figures approaching. One was a man bent beneath a great load and
the other was that of a young girl. What he did not see was the
figure of a great lion in the shadows behind them.</p>

<p>Zeyd held his breath because, for an instant, his heart had
stopped beating.</p>

<p>"Ateja!" he cried and ran forward to meet her and clasp her in
his arms.</p>

<p>Ibn Jad staggered into the village. He took one look at the
stern visages of the dread Waziri and sank weakly to the ground,
the treasure almost burying him as it fell upon his head and
shoulders.</p>

<p>Hirfa voiced a sudden scream as she pointed back along the
trail, and as every eye turned in that direction, a great golden
lion stepped into the circle of the firelight in the village, and
at its side strode Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle.</p>

<p>As Tarzan entered the village Blake came forward and grasped his
hand.</p>

<p>"We were too late!" said the American sadly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the ape-man.</p>

<p>"The Princess Guinalda is dead!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Tarzan. "I left her this morning at the
entrance to the City of Nimmr."</p>

<p>A dozen times Tarzan was forced to assure Blake that he was not
playing a cruel joke upon him. A dozen times Tarzan had to repeat
Guinalda's message: "An' thou findest him tell him that the gates
of Nimmr be always open to him and that the Princess Guinalda
awaits his return!"</p>

<p>Later in the evening Stimbol, through Blake, begged Tarzan to
come to the hut in which he lay.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed the old man fervently. "I thought that I
had killed you. It has preyed on my mind and now I know that it was
not you I believe that I can recover."</p>

<p>"You will be taken care of properly, Stimbol," said the ape-man,
"and as soon as you are well enough you will be taken to the
coast," then he walked away. He would do his duty by the man who
had disobeyed him and tried to kill him, but he would not feign a
friendship he did not feel.</p>

<p>The following morning they prepared to leave the village. Ibn
Jad and his Arabs, with the exception of Zeyd and Ateja, who had
asked to come and serve Tarzan in his home, were being sent to the
nearest Galla village under escort of a dozen Waziri. Here they
would be turned over to the Galla and doubtless sold into slavery
in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Stimbol was borne in a litter by four stout Waziri as the party
prepared to take up its march toward the south and the country of
Tarzan. Four others carried the treasure of the City of the
Sepulcher.</p>

<p>Blake, dressed again in his iron mail, bestrode his great
charger as the column started out of the village and down the trail
into the south. Tarzan and the Golden Lion stood beside him. Blake
reached down and extended his hand to the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, sir!" he said.</p>

<p>"Goodbye?" demanded Tarzan. "Aren't you coming home with
us?"</p>

<p>Blake shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I'm going back into the Middle Ages with the
woman I love!"</p>

<p>Tarzan and Jad-bal-ja stood in the trail watching as Sir James
rode out toward the City of Nimmr, the blue and silver of his
pennon fluttering bravely from the iron tip of his great lance.</p>
