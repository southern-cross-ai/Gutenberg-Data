<h2><a id="dedic"></a>DEDICATION</h2>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I have for a long while hoped to be allowed
to dedicate some book of mine to you, and now I bring you this
work, because whatever its shortcomings, and whatever judgment
may be passed upon it by yourself and others, it is yet the one I
should wish you to accept.</p>

<p class="letter">I trust that you will receive from my
romance of "Cleopatra" some such pleasure as lightened the labour
of its building up; and that it may convey to your mind a
picture, however imperfect, of the old and mysterious Egypt in
whose lost glories you are so deeply interested.</p>

<p class="letter">Your affectionate and dutiful Son,</p>

<h2><a id="note" name="note">AUTHOR'S NOTE</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE history of the ruin of Antony and Cleopatra
must have struck many students of the records of their age as one
of the most inexplicable of tragic tales. What malign influence
and secret hates were at work, continually sapping their
prosperity and blinding their judgment? Why did Cleopatra fly at
Actium, and why did Antony follow her, leaving his fleet and army
to destruction? An attempt is made in this romance to suggest a
possible answer to these and some other questions.</p>

<p>The reader is asked to bear in mind, however, that the story
is told, not from the modern point of view, but as from the
broken heart and with the lips of an Egyptian patriot of royal
blood; no mere beast-worshipper, but a priest instructed in the
inmost mysteries, who believed firmly in the personal existence
of the gods of Khem, in the possibility of communion with them,
and in the certainty of immortal life with its rewards and
punishments; to whom also the bewildering and often gross
symbolism of the Osirian Faith was nothing but a veil woven to
obscure secrets of the Sanctuary. Whatever proportion of truth
there may have been in their spiritual claims and imaginings, if
indeed there was any, such men as the Prince Harmachis have been
told of in the annals of every great religion, and, as is shown
by the testimony of monumental and sacred inscriptions, they were
not unknown among the worshippers of the Egyptian Gods, and more
especially of Isis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is scarcely possible to write a book of this
nature and period without introducing a certain amount of
illustrative matter, for by no other means can the long dead past
be made to live again before the reader's eyes with all its
accessories of faded pomp and forgotten mystery. To such students
as seek a story only, and are not interested in the faith,
ceremonies, or customs of the Mother of Religion and
Civilisation, ancient Egypt, it is, however, respectfully
suggested that they should exercise the art of skipping, and open
this tale at its Second Book.</p>

<p>That version of the death of Cleopatra has been preferred
which attributes her end to poison. According to Plutarch its
actual manner is very uncertain, though popular rumour ascribed
it to the bite of an asp. She seems, however, to have carried out
her design under the advice of that shadowy personage, her
physician, Olympus, and it is more than doubtful if he would have
resorted to such a fantastic and uncertain method of destroying
life.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that so late as the reign of Ptolemy
Epiphanes, pretenders of native blood, one of whom was named
Harmachis, are known to have advanced their claims to the throne
of Egypt. Moreover, there was a book of prophecy current among
the priesthood which declared that after the nations of the
Greeks the God Harsefi would create the "chief who is to come."
It will therefore be seen that, although it lacks historical
confirmation, the story of the great plot formed to stamp out the
dynasty of the Macedonian Lagidae and place Harmachis on the
throne is not in itself improbable. Indeed, it is possible that
many such plots were entered into by Egyptian patriots during the
long ages of their country's bondage. But ancient history tells
us little of the abortive struggles of a fallen race.</p>

<p>The Chant of Isis and the Song of Cleopatra, which appear in
these pages, are done into verse from the writer's prose by Mr.
Andrew Lang, and the dirge sung by Charmion is translated by the
same hand from the Greek of the Syrian Meleager.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE recesses of the desolate Libyan mountains
that lie behind the temple and city of Abydus, the supposed
burying place of the holy Osiris, a tomb was recently discovered,
among the contents of which were the papyrus rolls whereupon this
history is written. The tomb itself is spacious, but otherwise
remarkable only for the depth of the shaft which descends
vertically from the rock-hewn cave, that once served as the
mortuary chapel for the friends and relatives of the departed, to
the coffin-chamber beneath. This shaft is no less than eighty-
nine feet in depth. The chamber at its foot was found to contain
three coffins only, though it is large enough for many more. Two
of these, which in all probability inclosed the bodies of the
High Priest, Amenemhat, and of his wife, father and mother of
Harmachis, the hero of this history, the shameless Arabs who
discovered them there and then broke up.</p>

<p>The Arabs broke the bodies up. With unhallowed
hands they tore the holy Amenemhat and the frame of her who had,
as it is written, been filled with the spirit of the
Hathors&mdash;tore them limb from limb, searching for treasure
amidst their bones&mdash;perhaps, as is their custom, selling the
very bones for a few piastres to the last ignorant tourist who
came their way, seeking what he might destroy. For in Egypt the
unhappy, the living find their bread in the tombs of the great
men who were before them.</p>

<p>But as it chanced, some little while afterwards,
one who is known to this writer, and a doctor by profession,
passed up the Nile to Abydus, and became acquainted with the men
who had done this thing. They revealed to him the secret of the
place, telling him that one coffin yet remained entombed. It
seemed to be the coffin of a poor person, they said, and
therefore, being pressed for time, they had left it unviolated.
Moved by curiosity to explore the recesses of a tomb as yet
unprofaned by tourists, my friend bribed the Arabs to show it to
him. What ensued I will give in his own words, exactly as he
wrote it to me:</p>

<p><br>
"I slept that night near the Temple of Seti, and
started before daybreak on the following morning. With me were a
cross-eyed rascal named Ali&mdash;Ali Baba I named him&mdash;the
man from whom I got the ring which I am sending you, and a small
but choice assortment of his fellow thieves. Within an hour after
sunrise we reached the valley where the tomb is. It is a desolate
place, into which the sun pours his scorching heat all the long
day through, till the huge brown rocks which are strewn about
become so hot that one can scarcely bear to touch them, and the
sand scorches the feet. It was already too hot to walk, so we
rode on donkeys, some way up the valley &mdash;where a vulture
floating far in the blue overhead was the only other
visitor&mdash;till we came to an enormous boulder polished by
centuries of action of sun and sand. Here Ali halted, saying that
the tomb was under the stone. Accordingly, we dismounted, and,
leaving the donkeys in charge of a fellah boy, went up to the
rock. Beneath it was a small hole, barely large enough for a man
to creep through. Indeed it had been dug by jackals, for the
doorway and some part of the cave were entirely silted up, and it
was by means of this jackal hole that the tomb had been
discovered. Ali crept in on his hands and knees, and I followed,
to find myself in a place cold after the hot outside air, and, in
contrast with the light, filled with a dazzling darkness. We lit
our candles, and, the select body of thieves having arrived, I
made an examination. We were in a cave the size of a large room,
and hollowed by hand, the further part of the cave being almost
free from drift-dust. On the walls are religious paintings of the
usual Ptolemaic character, and among them one of a majestic old
man with a long white beard, who is seated in a carved chair
holding a wand in his hand (1).

<p class="footnote">1. This, I take it, is a portrait of Amenemhat himself.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p><br>
Before him passes a procession of priests bearing sacred images. In the
right hand corner of the tomb is the shaft of the mummy-pit, a
square-mouthed well cut in the black rock. We had brought a beam
of thorn-wood, and this was now laid across the pit and a rope
made fast to it. Then Ali&mdash;who, to do him justice, is a
courageous thief&mdash;took hold of the rope, and, putting some
candles into the breast of his robe, placed his bare feet against
the smooth sides of the well and began to descent with great
rapidity. Very soon he had vanished into blackness, and the
agitation of the cord alone told us that anything was going on
below. At last the rope ceased shaking and a faint shout came
rumbling up the well, announcing Ali's safe arrival. Then, far
below, a tiny star of light appeared. He had lit the candle,
thereby disturbing hundreds of bats that flitted up in an endless
stream and as silently as spirits. The rope was hauled up again,
and now it was my turn; but, as I declined to trust my neck to
the hand-over-hand method of descent, the end of the cord was
made fast round my middle and I was lowered bodily into those
sacred depths.</p>

<br>

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I was lowered bodily into those sacred depths."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Nor was it a pleasant journey, for, if the masters
of the situation above had made any mistake, I should have been
dashed to pieces. Also, the bats continually flew into my face
and clung to my hair, and I have a great dislike of bats. At
last, after some minutes of jerking and dangling, I found myself
standing in a narrow passage by the side of the worthy Ali,
covered with bats and perspiration, and with the skin rubbed off
my knees and knuckles. Then another man came down, hand over hand
like a sailor, and as the rest were told to stop above we were
ready to go on. Ali went first with his candle&mdash;of course we
each had a candle &mdash;leading the way down a long passage
about five feet high. At length the passage widened out, and we
were in the tomb-chamber: I think the hottest and most silent
place that I ever entered. It was simply stifling. This chamber
is a square room cut in the rock and totally devoid of paintings
or sculpture. I held up the candles and looked round. About the
place were strewn the coffin lids and the mummied remains of the
two bodies that the Arabs had previously violated. The paintings
on the former were, I noticed, of great beauty, though, having no
knowledge of hieroglyphics, I could not decipher them. Beads and
spicy wrappings lay around the remains, which, I saw, were those
of a man and a woman (2). The head had been broken off the body
of the man. I took it up and looked at it. It had been closely
shaved&mdash;after death, I should say, from the general
indications&mdash;and the features were disfigured with gold
leaf. But notwithstanding this, and the shrinkage of the flesh, I
think the face was one of the most imposing and beautiful that I
ever saw. It was that of a very old man, and his dead countenance
still wore so calm and solemn, indeed, so awful a look, that I
grew quite superstitious (though as you know, I am pretty well
accustomed to dead people), and put the head down in a hurry.
There were still some wrappings left upon the face of the second
body, and I did not remove them; but she must have been a fine
large woman in her day.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. Doubtless Amenemhat and his wife.&mdash; Editor.</p>

<p><br>
"'There the other mummy,' said Ali, pointing to a large and solid
case that seemed to have been carelessly thrown down in a corner,
for it was lying on its side.</p>

<p>"I went up to it and carefully examined it. It was well made, but of perfectly plain cedar-wood&mdash;not an inscription, not a solitary God on it.</p>

<p>"'Never see one like him before,' said Ali.
'Bury great hurry, he no "mafish," no "fineesh." Throw him down
here on side.'</p>

<p>"I looked at the plain case till at last my
interest was thoroughly aroused. I was so shocked by the sight of
the scattered dust of the departed that I had made up my mind not
to touch the remaining coffin&mdash; but now my curiosity
overcame me, and we set to work.</p>

<p>"Ali had brought a mallet and a cold chisel with
him, and, having set the coffin straight, he began upon it with
all the zeal of an experienced tomb-breaker. And then he pointed
out another thing. Most mummy-cases are fastened by four little
tongues of wood, two on either side, which are fixed in the upper
half, and, passing into mortices cut to receive them in the
thickness of the lower half, are there held fast by pegs of hard
wood. But this mummy case had eight such tongues. Evidently it
had been thought well to secure it firmly. At last, with great
difficulty, we raised the massive lid, which was nearly three
inches thick, and there, covered over with a deep layer of loose
spices (a very unusual thing), was the body.</p>

<p>"Ali looked at it with open eyes&mdash;and no
wonder. For this mummy was not as other mummies are. Mummies in
general lie upon their backs, as stiff and calm as though they
were cut from wood; but this mummy lay upon its side, and, the
wrappings notwithstanding, its knees were slightly bent. More
than that, indeed, the gold mask, which, after the fashion of the
Ptolemaic period, had been set upon the face, had worked down,
and was literally pounded up beneath the hooded head.</p>

<p>"It was impossible, seeing these things, to
avoid the conclusion that the mummy before us had moved with
violence <i>since it was put in the coffin</i>.</p>

<p>"'Him very funny mummy. Him not "mafish" when
him go in there,' said Ali.</p>

<p>"'Nonsense!' I said. 'Who ever heard of a live
mummy?'</p>

<p>"We lifted the body out of the coffin, nearly
choking ourselves with mummy dust in the process, and there
beneath it half hidden among the spices, we made our first find.
It was a roll of papyrus, carelessly fastened and wrapped in a
piece of mummy cloth, having to all appearance been thrown into
the coffin at the moment of closing (3).</p>

<p class="footnote">3. This roll contained the third
unfinished book of the history. The other two rolls were neatly
fastened in the usual fashion. All three are written by one hand
in the Demotic character. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p><br>
"Ali eyed the papyrus greedily, but I seized it
and put it in my pocket, for it was agreed that I was to have all
that might be discovered. Then we began to unwrap the body. It
was covered with very broad strong bandages, thickly wound and
roughly tied, sometimes by means of simple knots, the whole
working the appearance of having been executed in great haste and
with difficulty. Just over the head was a large lump. Presently,
the bandages covering it were off, and there, on the face, lay a
second roll of papyrus. I put down my hand to lift it, but it
would not come away. It appeared to be fixed to the stout
seamless shroud which was drawn over the whole body, and tied
beneath the feet&mdash;as a farmer ties sacks. This shroud, which
was also thickly waxed, was in one piece, being made to fit the
form like a garment. I took a candle and examined the roll and
then I saw why it was fast. The spices had congealed and glued it
to the sack-like shroud. It was impossible to get it away without
tearing the outer sheets of papyrus (4).</p>

<p class="footnote">4. This accounts for the gaps in the last sheets of the second roll.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"At last, however, I wrenched it loose and put
it with the other in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Then we went on with our dreadful task in
silence. With much care we ripped loose the sack-like garment,
and at last the body of a man lay before us. Between his knees
was a third roll of papyrus. I secured it, then held down the
light and looked at him. One glance at his face was enough to
tell a doctor how he had died.</p>

<p>"This body was not much dried up. Evidently it
had not passed the allotted seventy days in natron, and therefore
the expression and likeness were better preserved than is usual.
Without entering into particulars, I will only say that I hope I
shall never see such another look as that which was frozen on
this dead man's face. Even the Arabs recoiled from it in horror
and began to mutter prayers.</p>

<p>"For the rest, the usual opening on the left
side through which the embalmers did their work was absent; the
finely-cut features were those of a person of middle age,
although the hair was already grey, and the frame was that of a
very powerful man, the shoulders being of an extraordinary width.
I had not time to examine very closely, however, for within a few
seconds from its uncovering, the unembalmed body began to crumble
now that it was exposed to the action of the air. In five or six
minutes there was literally nothing left of it but a wisp of
hair, the skull, and a few of the larger bones. I noticed that
one of the tibiae&mdash;I forget if it was the right or the
left&mdash;had been fractured and very badly set. It must have
been quite an inch shorter than the other.</p>

<p>"Well, there was nothing more to find, and now
that the excitement was over, what between the heat, the
exertion, and the smell of mummy dust and spices, I felt more
dead than alive.</p>

<p>"I am tired of writing, and this ship rolls.
This letter, of course, goes overland, and I am coming by 'long
sea,' but I hope to be in London within ten days after you get
it. Then I will tell you of my pleasing experiences in the course
of the ascent from the tomb-chamber, and of how that prince of
rascals, Ali Baba, and his thieves tried to frighten me into
handing over the papyri, and how I worsted them. Then, too, we
will get the rolls deciphered. I expect that they only contain
the usual thing, copies of the 'Book of the Dead,' but there
<i>may</i> be something else in them. Needless to say, I did not
narrate this little adventure in Egypt, or I should have had the
Boulac Museum people on my track. Good-bye, 'Mafish Fineesh,' as
Ali Baba always said."</p>

<p><br> In due course, my friend, the writer of the letter from
which I have quoted, arrived in London, and on the very next day
we paid a visit to a learned acquaintance well versed in
Hieroglyphics and Demotic writing. The anxiety with which we
watched him skilfully damping and unfolding one of the rolls and
peering through his gold-rimmed glasses at the mysterious
characters may well be imagined.</p>

<p>"Hum," he said, "whatever it is, this is <i>not</i> a copy of the 'Book of the Dead.' By George, what's
this? Cle&mdash;Cleo&mdash; Cleopatra&mdash;Why, my dear Sirs, as
I am a living man, this is the history of somebody who lived in
the days of Cleopatra, <i>the</i> Cleopatra, for here's Antony's
name with hers! Well, there's six months' work before me here
&mdash;six months, at the very least!" And in that joyful
prospect he fairly lost control of himself, and skipped about the
room, shaking hands with us at intervals, and saying "I'll
translate&mdash;I'll translate it if it kills me, and we will
publish it; and, by the living Osiris, it shall drive every
Egyptologist in Europe mad with envy! Oh, what a find! what a
most glorious find!"</p>

<p>And O you whose eyes fall upon these pages, see,
they have been translated, and they have been printed, and here
they lie before you &mdash;an undiscovered land wherein you are
free to travel!</p>

<p>Harmachis speaks to you from his forgotten tomb.
The walls of Time fall down, and, as at the lightning's leap, a
picture from the past starts upon your view, framed in the
darkness of the ages.</p>

<p>He shows you those two Egypts which the silent
pyramids looked down upon long centuries ago&mdash;the Egypt of
the Greek, the Roman, and the Ptolemy, and that other outworn
Egypt of the Hierophant, hoary with years, heavy with the legends
of antiquity and the memory of long-lost honours.</p>

<p>He tells you how the smouldering loyalty of the
land of Khem blazed up before it died, and how fiercely the old
Time-consecrated Faith struggled against the conquering tide of
Change that rose, like Nile at flood, and drowned the ancient
Gods of Egypt.</p>

<p>Here, in his pages, you shall learn the glory of
Isis the Many-shaped, the Executrix of Decrees. Here you shall
make acquaintance with the shade of Cleopatra, that "Thing of
Flame," whose passion-breathing beauty shaped the destiny of
Empires. Here you shall read how the soul of Charmion was slain
of the sword her vengeance smithied.</p>

<p>Here Harmachis, the doomed Egyptian, being about
to die, salutes you who follow on the path he trod. In the story
of his broken years he shows to you what may in its degree be the
story of your own. Crying aloud from that dim Amenti (5), where to-day he wears out his long atoning time, he tells, in the history of his fall, the fate of him who, however sorely tried, forgets his God, his Honour, and his Country.</p>

<p class="first">Y OSIRIS who sleeps at Abouthis, I write the
truth.</p>

<p>I, Harmachis, Hereditary Priest of the Temple, reared by the
divine Sethi, aforetime a Pharaoh of Egypt, and now justified in
Osiris and ruling in Amenti. I, Harmachis, by right Divine and by
true descent of blood King of the Double Crown, and Pharaoh of
the Upper and Lower Land. I, Harmachis, who cast aside the
opening flower of our hope, who turned from the glorious path,
who forgot the voice of God in hearkening to the voice of woman.
I, Harmachis, the fallen, in whom are gathered up all woes as
waters are gathered in a desert well, who have tasted of every
shame, who through betrayal have betrayed, who in losing the
glory that is here have lost the glory which is to be, who am
utterly undone&mdash;I write, and, by Him who sleeps at Abouthis,
I write the truth.</p>

<p>O Egypt!&mdash;dear land of Khem, whose black soil nourished
up my mortal part&mdash;land that I have betrayed&mdash;O
Osiris!&mdash; Isis!&mdash;Horus!&mdash;ye Gods of Egypt whom I
have betrayed!&mdash; O ye temples whose pylons strike the sky,
whose faith I have betrayed!&mdash; O Royal blood of the Pharaohs
of eld, that yet runs within these withered veins &mdash;whose
virtue I have betrayed!&mdash;O Invisible Essence of all Good!
and O Fate, whose balance rested on my hand&mdash;hear me; and,
to the day of utter doom, bear me witness that I write the
truth.</p>

<p>Even while I write, beyond the fertile fields, the Nile is
running red, as though with blood. Before me the sunlight beats
upon the far Arabian hills, and falls upon the piles of Abouthis.
Still the priests make orison within the temples at Abouthis that
know me no more; still the sacrifice is offered, and the stony
roofs echo back the people's prayers. Still from this lone cell
within my prison-tower, I, the Word of Shame, watch thy
fluttering banners, Abouthis, flaunting from thy pylon walls, and
hear the chants as the long procession winds from sanctuary to
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Abouthis, lost Abouthis! my heart goes out toward thee! For
the day comes when the desert sands shall fill thy secret places!
Thy Gods are doomed, O Abouthis! New Faiths shall make a mock of
all thy Holies, and Centurion shall call upon Centurion across
thy fortress-walls. I weep&mdash;I weep tears of blood: for mine
is the sin that brought about these evils and mine for ever is
their shame.</p>

<p>Behold, it is written hereafter.</p>

<p>Here in Abouthis I was born, I, Harmachis, and my father, the
justified in Osiris, was High Priest of the Temple of Sethi. And
on that same day of my birth Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, was
born also. I passed my youth in yonder fields watching the baser
people at their labours and going in and out at will among the
great courts of the temples. Of my mother I knew naught, for she
died when I yet hung at the breast. But before she died in the
reign of Ptolemy Aulêtes, who is named the Piper, so did the old
wife, Atoua, told me, my mother took a golden uraeus, the snake
symbol of our Royalty of Egypt, from a coffer of ivory and laid
it on my brow. And those who saw her do this believed that she
was distraught of the Divinity, and in her madness foreshadowed
that the day of the Macedonian Lagidae was ended, and that
Egypt's sceptre should pass again to the hand of Egypt's true and
Royal race. But when my father, the old High Priest Amenemhat,
whose only child I was, she who was his wife before my mother
having been, for what crime I know not, cursed with barrenness by
Sekhet: I say when my father came in and saw what the dying woman
had done, he lifted up his hands towards the vault of heaven and
adored the Invisible, because of the sign that had been sent. And
as he adored, the Hathors (6) filled my dying mother with the
Spirit of Prophecy, and she rose in strength from the couch and
prostrated herself thrice before the cradle where I lay asleep,
the Royal asp upon my brow, crying aloud:</p>

<p>"Hail to thee, fruit of my womb! Hail to thee, Royal child!
Hail to thee, Pharaoh that shalt be! Hail to thee, God that shalt
purge the land, Divine seed of Nekt-nebf, the descended from
Isis. Keep thee pure, and thou shalt rule and deliver Egypt and
not be broken. But if thou dost fail in thy hour of trial, then
may the curse of all the Gods of Egypt rest upon thee, and the
curse of thy Royal forefathers, the justified, who ruled the land
before thee from the age of Horus. Then in life mayst thou be
wretched, and after death may Osiris refuse thee, and the judges
of Amenti give judgment against thee, and Set and Sekhet torment
thee, till such time as thy sin is purged, and the Gods of Egypt,
called by strange names, are once more worshipped in the Temples
of Egypt, and the staff of the Oppressor is broken, and the
footsteps of the Foreigner are swept clean, and the thing is
accomplished as thou in thy weakness shalt cause it to be
done."</p>

<p class="footnote">6. The Egyptian <i>Parcae</i> or <i>Fates</i>.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p><br>
When she had spoken thus, the Spirit of Prophecy went out of
her, and she fell dead across the cradle where I slept, so that I
awoke with a cry.</p>

<p>But my father, Amenemhat, the High Priest, trembled, and was
very fearful, both because of the words which had been said by
the Spirit of the Hathors through the mouth of my mother, and
because what had been uttered was treason against Ptolemy. For he
knew that, if the matter should come to the ears of Ptolemy,
Pharaoh would send his guards to destroy the life of the child
concerning whom such things were prophesied. Therefore, my father
shut the doors, and caused all those who stood by to swear upon
the holy symbol of his office, and by the name of the Divine
Three, and by the Soul of her who lay dead upon the stones beside
them, that nothing of what they had seen and heard should pass
their lips.</p>

<p>Now among the company was the old wife, Atoua, who had been
the nurse of my mother, and loved her well; and in these days,
though I know not how it had been in the past, nor how it shall
be in the future, there is no oath that can bind a woman's
tongue. And so it came about that by-and-by, when the matter had
become homely in her mind, and her fear had fallen from her, she
spoke of the prophecy to her daughter, who nursed me at the
breast now that my mother was dead. She did this as they walked
together in the desert carrying food to the husband of the
daughter, who was a sculptor, and shaped effigies of the holy
Gods in the tombs that are fashioned in the rock&mdash;telling
the daughter, my nurse, how great must be her care and love
toward the child that should one day be Pharaoh, and drive the
Ptolemies from Egypt. But the daughter, my nurse, was so filled
with wonder at what she heard that she could not keep the tale
locked within her breast, and in the night she awoke her husband,
and, in her turn, whispered it to him, and thereby compassed her
own destruction, and the destruction of her child, my foster-
brother. For the man told his friend, and the friend was a spy of
Ptolemy's, and thus the tale came to Pharaoh's ears.</p>

<p>Now, Pharaoh was much troubled thereat, for though when he was
full of wine he would make a mock of the God of the Egyptians,
and swear that the Roman Senate was the only God to whom he bowed
the knee, yet in his heart he was terribly afraid, as I have
learned from one who was his physician. For when he was alone at
night he would scream and cry aloud to the great Serapis, who
indeed is no true God, and to other Gods, fearing lest he should
be murdered and his soul handed over to the tormentors. Also,
when he felt his throne tremble under him, he would send large
presents to the temples, asking a message from the oracles, and
more especially from the oracle that is at Philae. Therefore,
when it came to his ears that the wife of the High Priest of the
great and ancient Temple of Abouthis had been filled with the
Spirit of Prophecy before she died, and foretold that her son
should be Pharaoh, he was much afraid, and summoning some trusty
guards&mdash;who, being Greeks, did not fear to do
sacrilege&mdash;he despatched them by boat up the Nile, with
orders to come to Abouthis and cut off the head of the child of
the High Priest and bring it to him in a basket.</p>

<p>But, as it chanced, the boat in which the guards came was of
deep draught, and, the time of their coming being at the lowest
ebb of the river, it struck and remained fast upon a bank of mud
that is opposite the mouth of the road running across the plains
to Abouthis, and, as the north wind was blowing very fiercely, it
was like to sink. Thereon the guards of Pharaoh called out to the
common people, who laboured at lifting water along the banks of
the river, to come with boats and take them off; but, seeing that
they were Greeks of Alexandria, the people would not, for the
Egyptians do not love the Greeks. Then the guards cried that they
were on Pharaoh's business, and still the people would not,
asking what was their business. Whereon a eunuch among them who
had made himself drunk in his fear, told them that they came to
slay the child of Amenemhat, the High Priest, of whom it was
prophesied that he should be Pharaoh and sweep the Greeks from
Egypt. And then the people feared to stand longer in doubt, but
brought boats, not knowing what might be meant by the man's
words. But there was one amongst them&mdash;a farmer and an
overseer of canals&mdash;who was a kinsman of my mother's and had
been present when she prophesied; and he turned and ran swiftly
for three parts of an hour, till he came to where I lay in the
house that is without the north wall of the great Temple. Now, as
it chanced, my father was away in that part of the Place of Tombs
which is to the left of the large fortress, and Pharaoh's guards,
mounted on asses, were hard upon us. Then the messenger cried to
the old wife, Atoua, whose tongue had brought about the evil, and
told how the soldiers drew near to slay me. And they looked at
each other, not knowing what to do; for, had they hid me, the
guards would not have stayed their search till I was found. But
the man, gazing through the doorway, saw a little child at
play:</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "whose is that child?"</p>

<p>"It is my grandchild," she answered, "the foster-brother of
the Prince Harmachis; the child to whose mother we owe this evil
case."</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "thou knowest thy duty, do it!" and he again
pointed at the child. "I command thee, by the Holy Name!"</p>

<p>Atoua trembled exceedingly, because the child was of her own
blood; but, nevertheless, she took the boy and washed him and set
a robe of silk upon him, and laid him on my cradle. And me she
took and smeared with mud to make my fair skin darker, and,
drawing my garment from me, set me to play in the dirt of the
yard, which I did right gladly.</p>

<p>Then the man hid himself, and presently the soldiers rode up
and asked of the old wife if this were the dwelling of the High
Priest Amenemhat? And she told them yea, and, bidding them enter,
offered them honey and milk, for they were thirsty.</p>

<p>When they had drunk, the eunuch who was with them asked if
that were the son of Amenemhat who lay in the cradle; and she
said "Yea&mdash;yea," and began to tell the guards how he would
be great, for it had been prophesied of him that he should one
day rule them all.</p>

<p>But the Greek guards laughed, and one of them, seizing the
child, smote off his head with a sword; and the eunuch drew forth
the signet of Pharaoh as warrant for the deed and showed it to
the old wife, Atoua, bidding her tell the High Priest that his
son should be King without a head.</p>

<p>And as they went one of their number saw me playing in the
dirt and called out that there was more breeding in yonder brat
than in the Prince Harmachis; and for a moment they wavered,
thinking to slay me also, but in the end they passed on, bearing
the head of my foster-brother, for they loved not to murder
little children.</p>

<br>

<p>After a while, the mother of the dead child returned from the
market-place, and when she found what had been done, she and her
husband would have killed Atoua the old wife, her mother, and
given me up to the soldiers of Pharaoh. But my father came in
also and learned the truth, and he caused the man and his wife to
be seized by night and hidden away in the dark places of the
temple, so that none saw them more.</p>

<p>But I would to-day that it had been the will of the Gods that
I had been slain of the soldiers and not the innocent child.</p>

<p>Thereafter it was given out that the High Priest Amenemhat had
taken me to be as a son to him in the place of that Harmachis who
was slain of Pharaoh.</p>

<p class="first">AFTER these things Ptolemy the Piper
troubled us no more, nor did he again send his soldiers to seek
for him of whom it was prophesied that he should be Pharaoh. For
the head of the child, my foster-brother, was brought to him by
the eunuch as he sat in his palace of marble at Alexandria,
flushed with Cyprian wine, and played upon the flute before his
women. And at his bidding the eunuch lifted up the head by the
hair for him to look on. Then he laughed and smote it on the
cheek with his sandal, bidding one of the girls crown Pharaoh
with flowers. And he bowed the knee, and mocked the head of the
innocent child. But the girl, who was sharp of tongue&mdash;for
all of this I heard in after years&mdash;said to him that "he did
well to bow the knee, for this child was indeed Pharaoh, the
greatest of Pharaohs, and his name was the <i>Osiris</i> and his
throne was <i>Death</i>."</p>

<p>Aulêtes was much troubled at these words, and trembled, for,
being a wicked man, he greatly feared entering into Amenti. So he
caused the girl to be slain because of the evil omen of her
saying; crying that he would send her to worship that Pharaoh
whom she had named. And the other women he sent away, and played
no more upon the flute till he was once again drunk on the
morrow. But the Alexandrians made a song on the matter, which is
still sung about the streets. And this is the beginning of it:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Ptolemy the Piper played<br>

Over dead and dying;<br>

Piped and played he well.<br>

Sure that flute of his was made<br>

Of the dank reed sighing<br>

O'er the streams of Hell.</p>

<p class="verse">
There beneath the shadows grey,<br>

With the sisters three,<br>

Shall he pipe for many a day.<br>

May the Frog his butler be!<br>

And his wine the water of that countrie &mdash;<br>

Ptolemy the Piper!</p>

<p><br>
After this the years passed on, nor did I, being very little,
know anything of the great things that came to pass in Egypt; nor
is it my purpose to set them out here. For I, Harmachis, having
little time left to me, will only speak of those things with
which I have been concerned.</p>

<p>And as the time went on, my father and the teachers instructed
me in the ancient learning of our people, and in such matters
appertaining to the Gods as it is meet that children should know.
So I grew strong and comely, for my hair was black as the hair of
the divine Nout, and my eyes were blue as the blue lotus, and my
skin was like the alabaster within the sanctuaries. For now that
these glories have passed from me I may speak of them without
shame. I was strong also. There was no youth of my years in
Abouthis who could stand against me to wrestle with me, nor could
any throw so far with the sling or spear. And I much yearned to
hunt the lion; but he whom I called my father forbade me, telling
me that my life was of too great worth to be so lightly hazarded.
But when I bowed before him and prayed he would make his meaning
clear to me, the old man frowned and answered that the Gods made
all things clear in their own season. For my part, however, I
went away in wroth, for there was a youth in Abouthis who with
others had slain a lion which fell upon his father's herds, and,
being envious of my strength and beauty, he set it about that I
was cowardly at heart, in that when I went out to hunt I only
slew jackals and gazelles. Now, this was when I had reached my
seventeenth year and was a man grown.</p>

<p>It chanced, therefore, that as I went sore at heart from the
presence of the High Priest, I met this youth, who called to me
and mocked me, bidding me know the country people had told him
that a great lion was down among the rushes by the banks of the
canal which runs past the Temple, lying at a distance of thirty
stadia from Abouthis. And, still mocking me, he asked me if I
would come and help him slay this lion, or would I go and sit
among the old women and bid them comb my side lock? This bitter
word so angered me that I was near to falling on him; but in
place therefore, forgetting my father's saying, I answered that
if he would come alone, I would go with him and seek this lion,
and he should learn if I were indeed a coward. And at first he
would not, for, as men know, it is our custom to hunt the lion in
companies; so it was my hour to mock. Then he went and fetched
his bow and arrows and a sharp knife. And I brought forth my
heavy spear, which had a shaft of thorn-wood, and at its end a
pomegranate in silver, to hold the hand from slipping; and, in
silence, we went, side by side, to where the lion lay. When we
came to the place, it was near sundown; and there, upon the mud
of the canal-bank, we found the lion's slot, which ran into a
thick clump of reeds.</p>

<p>"Now, thou boaster," I said, "wilt thou lead the way into
yonder reeds, or shall I?" And I made as though I would lead the
way.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," he answered, "be not so mad! The brute will spring
upon thee and rend thee. See! I will shoot among the reeds.
Perchance, if he sleeps, it will arouse him." And he drew his bow
at a venture.</p>

<p>How it chanced I know not, but the arrow struck the sleeping
lion, and, like a flash of light from the belly of a cloud, he
bounded from the shelter of the reeds, and stood before us with
bristling mane and yellow eyes, the arrow quivering in his flank.
He roared aloud in fury, and the earth shook.</p>

<p>"Shoot with the bow," I cried, "shoot swiftly ere he
spring!"</p>

<p>But courage had left the breast of the boaster, his jaw
dropped down and his fingers unloosed their hold so that the bow
fell from them; then, with a loud cry he turned and fled behind
me, leaving the lion in my path. But while I stood waiting my
doom, for though I was sore afraid I would not fly, the lion
crouched himself, and turning not aside, with one great bound
swept over me, touching me not. He lit, and again he bounded full
upon the boaster's back, striking him such a blow with his great
paw that his head was crushed as an egg thrown against a stone.
He fell down dead, and the lion stood and roared over him. Then I
was mad with horror, and, scarce knowing what I did, I grasped my
spear and with a shout I charged. As I charged the lion lifted
himself up above me. He smote at me with his paw; but with all my
strength I drove the broad spear into his throat, and, shrinking
from the agony of the steel, his blow fell short and did no more
than rip my skin. Back he fell, the great spear far in his
throat; then rising, he roared in pain and leapt twice the height
of a man straight into the air, smiting at the spear with his
forepaws. Twice he leapt thus, horrible to see, and twice he fell
upon his back. Then his strength spent itself with his rushing
blood, and, groaning like a bull, he died; while I, being but a
lad, stood and trembled with fear now that all cause of fear had
passed.</p>

<br>

<p>But as I stood and gazed at the body of him who had taunted
me, and at the carcass of the lion, a woman came running towards
me, even the same old wife, Atoua, who, though I knew it not as
yet, had offered up her flesh and blood that I might be saved
alive. For she had been gathering simples, in which she had great
skill, by the water's edge, not knowing that there was a lion
near (and, indeed, the lions, for the most part, are not found in
the tilled land, but rather in the desert and the Libyan
mountains), and had seen from a distance that which I have set
down. Now, when she was come, she knew me for Harmachis, and,
bending herself, she made obeisance to me, and saluted me,
calling me Royal, and worthy of all honour, and beloved, and
chosen of the Holy Three, ay, and by the name of the Pharaoh! the
Deliverer!</p>

<p>But I, thinking that terror had made her sick of mind, asked
her of what she would speak.</p>

<p>"Is it a great thing," I asked, "that I should slay a lion? Is
it a matter worthy of such talk as thine? There live, and have
lived, men who have slain many lions. Did not the Divine Amen-
hetep the Osirian slay with his own hand more than a hundred
lions? Is it not written on the scarabaeus that hangs within my
father's chamber, that he slew lions aforetime? And have not
others done likewise? Why then, speakest thou thus, O foolish
woman?"</p>

<p>All of which I said, because, having now slain the lion, I was
minded, after the manner of youth, to hold it as a thing of no
account. But she did not cease to make obeisance, and to call me
by names that are too high to be written.</p>

<p>"O Royal One," she cried, "wisely did thy mother prophecy.
Surely the Holy Spirit, the Knepth, was in her, O thou conceived
by a God! See the omen. The lion there&mdash;he growls within the
Capitol at Rome&mdash;and the dead man, he is the
Ptolemy&mdash;the Macedonian spawn that, like a foreign weed,
hath overgrown the land of Nile; with the Macedonian Lagidae;
thou shalt go to smite the lion of Rome. But the Macedonian cur
shall fly, and the Roman lion shall strike him down, and thou
shalt strike down the lion, and the land of Khem shall once more
be free! free! Keep thyself but pure, according to the
commandment of the Gods, O son of the Royal House; O hope of
Khemi! be but ware of Woman the Destroyer, and as I have said, so
shall it be. I am poor and wretched; yea, stricken with sorrow. I
have sinned in speaking of what should be hid, and for my sin I
have paid in the coin of that which was born of my womb;
willingly have I paid for thee. But I have still of the wisdom of
our people, nor do the Gods, in whose eyes all are equal, turn
their countenance from the poor; the Divine Mother Isis hath
spoken to me&mdash;but last night she spake&mdash;bidding me come
hither to gather herbs, and read to thee the signs that I should
see. And as I have said, so it shall come to pass, if thou canst
but endure the weight of the great temptation. Come hither, Royal
One!" and she led me to the edge of the canal, where the water
was deep, and still and blue. "Now gaze upon that face as the
water throws it back. Is not that brow fitted to bear the double
crown? Do not those gentle eyes mirror the majesty of kings? Hath
not the Ptah, the Creator, fashioned that form to fit the
Imperial garb, and awe the glance of multitudes looking through
thee to God?</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" she went on in another voice&mdash;a shrill old
wife's voice&mdash;"I will&mdash;be not so foolish, boy&mdash;the
scratch of a lion is a venomous thing, a terrible thing; yea, as
bad as the bite of an asp &mdash;it must be treated, else it will
fester, and all thy days thou shalt dream of lions; ay, and
snakes; and, also, it will break out in sores. But I know of
it&mdash;I know. I am not crazed for nothing. For mark!
everything has its balance&mdash;in madness is much wisdom, and
in wisdom much madness. <i>La! la! la!</i> Pharaoh himself can't
say where the one begins and the other ends. Now, don't stand
gazing there, looking as silly as a cat in a crocus- coloured
robe, as they say in Alexandria; but just let me stick these
green things on the place, and in six days you'll heal up as
white as a three-year- child. Never mind the smart of it, lad. By
Him who sleeps at Philae;, or at Abouthis, or at Abydus&mdash;as
our divine masters have it now&mdash;or wherever He does sleep,
which is a thing we shall all find out before we want to&mdash;by
Osiris, I say, you'll live to be as clean from scars as a
sacrifice to Isis at the new moon, if you'll but let me put it
on.</p>

<p>"Is it not so, good folk?"&mdash;and she turned to address
some people who, while she prophesied, had assembled unseen by
me&mdash;"I've been speaking a spell over him, just to make a way
for the virtue of my medicine &mdash;<i>la! la!</i> there's
nothing like a spell. If you don't believe it, just you come to
me next time your wives are barren; it's better than scraping
every pillar in the Temple of Osiris, I'll warrant. I'll make 'em
bear like a twenty-year-old palm. But then, you see, you must
know what to say&mdash; that's the point&mdash;everything comes
to a point at last. <i>La! la!</i>"</p>

<p>Now, when I heard all this, I, Harmachis, put my hand to my
head, not knowing if I dreamed. But presently looking up, I saw a
grey-haired man among those who were gathered together, who
watched us sharply, and afterwards I learned that this man was
the spy of Ptolemy, the very man, indeed, who had wellnigh caused
me to be slain of Pharaoh when I was in my cradle. Then I
understood why Atoua spoke so foolishly.</p>

<p>"Thine are strange spells, old wife," the spy said. "Thou
didst speak of Pharaoh and the double crown and of the form
fashioned by Ptah to bear it; is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Yea, yea&mdash;part of the spell, thou fool; and what can one
swear by better nowadays than by the Divine Pharaoh the Piper,
whom, and whose music, may the Gods preserve to charm this happy
land?&mdash;what better than by the double crown he
wears&mdash;grace to great Alexander of Macedonia? By the way,
you know about everything: have they got back his chlamys yet,
which Mithridates took to Cos? Pompey wore it last, didn't
he?&mdash;in his triumph, too&mdash;just fancy Pompey in the
cloak of Alexander!&mdash;a puppy-dog in a lion's skin! And
talking of lions&mdash;look what this lad hath done&mdash;slain a
lion with his own spear; and right glad you village folks should
be to see it, for it was a very fierce lion&mdash;just see his
teeth and his claws&mdash;his claws!&mdash;they are enough to
make a poor silly old woman like me shriek to look at them! And
the body there, the dead body&mdash;the lion slew it. Alack! he's
an Osiris (7) now, the body&mdash;and to think of it, but an hour
ago he was an everyday mortal like you or me! Well, away with him
to the embalmers. He'll soon swell in the sun and burst, and that
will save them the trouble of cutting him open. Not that they
will spend a talent of silver over him anyway. Seventy days in
natron&mdash;that's all he's likely to get. <i>La! la!</i> how my
tongue does run, and it's getting dark. Come, aren't you going to
take away the body of that poor lad, and the lion, too? There, my
boy, you keep those herbs on, and you'll never feel your
scratches. I know a thing or two for all I'm crazy, and you, my
own grandson! Dear, dear, I'm glad his Holiness the High Priest
adopted you when Pharaoh&mdash;Osiris bless his holy
name&mdash;made an end of his son; you look so bonny. I warrant
the real Harmachis could not have killed a lion like that. Give
me the common blood, I say&mdash;it's so lusty."</p>

<p class="footnote">7. The soul when it has been absorbed in the Godhead.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"You know too much and talk too fast," grumbled the spy, now
quite deceived. "Well, he is a brave youth. Here, you men, bear
this body back to Abouthis, and some of you stop and help me skin
the lion. We'll send the skin to you, young man," he went on;
"not that you deserve it: to attack a lion like that was the act
of a fool, and a fool deserves what he gets&mdash; destruction.
Never attack the strong until you are stronger."</p>

<p>But for my part I went home wondering.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Of The Rebuke Of Amenemhat,<br>
Of The Prayer Of Harmachis, And<br>
Of The Sign Given By The Holy Gods</p>

<br>

<p class="first">OR a while as I, Harmachis, went, the juice of
the green herbs which the old wife, Atoua, had placed upon my
wounds caused me much smart, but presently the pain ceased. And,
of a truth, I believe that there was virtue in them, for within
two days my flesh healed up, so that after a time no marks
remained. But I bethought me that I had disobeyed the word of the
old High Priest, Amenemhat, who was called my father. For till
this day I knew not that he was in truth my father according to
the flesh, having been taught that his own son was slain as I
have written; and that he had been pleased, with the sanction of
the Divine ones, to take me as an adopted son and rear me up,
that I might in due season fulfil an office about the Temple.
Therefore I was much troubled, for I feared the old man, who was
very terrible in his anger, and ever spoke with the cold voice of
Wisdom. Nevertheless, I determined to go in to him and confess my
fault and bear such punishment as he should be pleased to put
upon me. So with the red spear in my hand, and the red wounds on
my breast, I passed through the outer court of the great temple
and came to the door of the place where the High Priest dwelt. It
is a great chamber, sculptured round about with the images of the
solemn Gods, and the sunlight comes to it in the daytime by an
opening cut through the stones of the massy roof. But at night it
was lit by a swinging lamp of bronze. I passed in without noise,
for the door was not altogether shut, and, pushing my way through
the heavy curtains that were beyond, I stood with a beating heart
within the chamber.</p>

<p>The lamp was lit, for the darkness had fallen, and by its
light I saw the old man seated in a chair of ivory and ebony at a
table of stone on which were spread mystic writings of the words
of Life and Death. But he read no more, for he slept, and his
long white beard rested upon the table like the beard of a dead
man. The soft light from the lamp fell on him, on the papyri and
the gold ring upon his hand, where were graven the symbols of the
Invisible One, but all around was shadow. It fell on the shaven
head, on the white robe, on the cedar staff of priesthood at his
side, and on the ivory of the lion-footed chair; it showed the
mighty brow of power, the features cut in kingly mould, the white
eyebrows, and the dark hollows of the deep-set eyes. I looked and
trembled, for there was about him that which was more than the
dignity of man. He had lived so long with the Gods, and so long
kept company with them and with thoughts divine, he was so deeply
versed in all those mysteries which we do but faintly discern,
here in this upper air, that even now, before his time, he
partook of the nature of the Osiris, and was a thing to shake
humanity with fear.</p>

<p>I stood and gazed, and as I stood he opened his dark eyes, but
looked not on me, nor turned his head; and yet he saw me and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Why hast thou been disobedient to me, my son?" he said. "How
came it that thou wentest forth against the lion when I bade thee
not?"</p>

<p>"How knowest thou, my father, that I went forth?" I asked in
fear.</p>

<p>"How know I? Are there, then, no other ways of knowledge than
by the senses? Ah, ignorant child! was not my Spirit with thee
when the lion sprang upon thy companion? Did I not pray Those set
about thee to protect thee, to make sure thy thrust when thou
didst drive the spear into the lion's throat! How came it that
thou wentest forth, my son?"</p>

<p>"The boaster taunted me," I answered, "and I went."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it; and, because of the hot blood of youth, I
forgive thee, Harmachis. But now listen to me, and let my words
sink into thy heart like the waters of Sihor into the thirsty
sand at the rising of Sirius (8). Listen to me. The boaster was
sent to thee as a temptation, he was sent as a trial of thy
strength, and see! it has not been equal to the burden. Therefore
thy hour is put back. Hadst thou been strong in this matter, the
path had been made plain to thee even now. But thou hast failed,
and therefore thy hour is put back."</p>

<p class="footnote">8. The dog-star, whose appearance marked the commencement of the overflow of the Nile. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"I understand thee not, my father," I answered.</p>

<p>"What was it, then, my son, that the old wife, Atoua, said to
thee down by the bank of the canal?"</p>

<p>Then I told him all that the old wife had said.</p>

<p>"And thou believest, Harmachis, my son?"</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered; "how should I believe such tales? Surely
she is mad. All the people know her for mad."</p>

<p>Now for the first time he looked towards me, who was standing
in the shadow.</p>

<p>"My son! my son!" he cried; "thou art wrong. She is not mad.
The woman spoke the truth; she spoke not of herself, but of the
voice within her that cannot lie. For this Atoua is a prophetess
and holy. Now learn thou the destiny that the Gods of Egypt have
given to thee to fulfil, and woe be unto thee if by any weakness
thou dost fail therein! Listen: thou art no stranger adopted into
my house and the worship of the Temple; thou art my very son,
saved to me by this same woman. But, Harmachis, thou art more
than this, for in thee and me alone yet flows the Imperial blood
of Egypt. Thou and I alone of men alive are descended, without
break or flaw, from that Pharaoh Nekt-nebf whom Ochus the Persian
drove from Egypt. The Persian came and the Persian went, and
after the Persian came the Macedonian, and now for nigh upon
three hundred years the Lagidae; have usurped the double crown,
defiling the land of Khem and corrupting the worship of its Gods.
And mark thou this: but now, two weeks since, Ptolemy Neus
Dionysus, Ptolemy Aulêtes the Piper, who would have slain thee,
is dead; and but now hath the Eunuch Pothinus, that very eunuch
who came hither, years ago, to cut thee off, set at naught the
will of his master, the dead Aulêtes, and placed the boy Ptolemy
upon the throne. And therefore his sister Cleopatra, that fierce
and beautiful girl, has fled into Syria; and there, if I err not,
she will gather her armies and make war upon her brother Ptolemy:
for by her father's will she was left joint-sovereign with him.
And, meanwhile, mark thou this, my son: the Roman eagle hangs on
high, waiting with ready talons till such time as he may fall
upon the fat wether Egypt and rend him. And mark again: the
people of Egypt are weary of the foreign yoke, they hate the
memory of the Persians, and they are sick at heart of being named
"Men of Macedonia" in the markets of Alexandria. The whole land
mutters and murmurs beneath the yoke of the Greek and the shadow
of the Roman.</p>

<p>"Have we not been oppressed? Have not our children been
butchered and our gains wrung from us to fill the bottomless
greed and lust of the Lagidae? Have not the temples been
forsaken?&mdash;ay, have not the majesties of the Eternal Gods
been set at naught by these Grecian babblers, who have dared to
meddle with the immortal truths, and name the Most High by
another name &mdash;by the name of Serapis&mdash;confounding the
substance of the Invisible? Does not Egypt cry aloud for
freedom?&mdash;and shall she cry in vain? Nay, nay, for thou, my
son, art the appointed way of deliverance. To thee, being sunk in
eld, I have decreed my rights. Already thy name is whispered in
many a sanctuary, from Abu to Athu; already priests and people
swear allegiance, even by the sacred symbols, unto him who shall
be declared to them. Still, the time is not yet; thou art too
green a sapling to bear the weight of such a storm. But to-day
thou wast tried and found wanting.</p>

<p>"He who would serve the Gods, Harmachis, must put aside the
failings of the flesh. Taunts must not move him, nor any lusts of
man. Thine is a high mission, but this thou must learn. If thou
learn it not, thou shalt fail therein; and then, my curse be on
thee! and the curse of Egypt, and the curse of Egypt's broken
Gods! For know thou this, that even the Gods, who are immortal,
may, in the interwoven scheme of things, lean upon the man who is
their instrument, as a warrior on his sword. And woe be to the
sword that snaps in the hour of battle, for it shall be thrown
aside to rust or perchance be melted with fire! Therefore, make
thy heart pure and high and strong; for thine is no common lot,
and thine no mortal meed. Triumph, Harmachis, and in glory thou
shalt go&mdash;in glory here and hereafter! Fail, and
woe&mdash;woe be on thee!"</p>

<p>He paused and bowed his head, and then went on:</p>

<p>"Of these matters thou shalt hear more hereafter. Meanwhile,
thou hast much to learn. To-morrow I will give thee letters, and
thou shalt journey down the Nile, past white-walled Memphis to
Annu. There thou shalt sojourn certain years, and learn more of
our ancient wisdom beneath the shadow of those secret pyramids of
which thou, too, art the Hereditary High Priest that is to be.
And meanwhile, I will sit here and watch, for my hour is not yet,
and, by the help of the Gods, spin the web of Death wherein thou
shalt catch and hold the wasp of Macedonia.</p>

<p>"Come hither, my son; come hither and kiss me on the brow, for
thou art my hope, and all the hope of Egypt. Be but true, soar to
the eagle crest of destiny, and thou shalt be glorious here and
hereafter. Be false, fail, and I will spit upon thee, and thou
shalt be accursed, and thy soul shall remain in bondage till that
hour when, in the slow flight of time, the evil shall once more
grow to good and Egypt shall again be free."</p>

<p>I drew near, trembling, and kissed him on the brow. "May all
these things come upon me, and more," I said, "if I fail thee, my
father!"</p>

<p>"Nay!" he cried, "not me, not me; but rather those whose will
I do. And now go, my son, and ponder in thy heart, and in thy
secret heart digest my words; mark what thou shalt see, and
gather up the dew of wisdom, making thee ready for the battle.
Fear not for thyself, thou art protected from all ill. No harm
may touch thee from without; thyself alone can be thine own
enemy. I have said."</p>

<p>Then I went forth with a full heart. The night was very still,
and none were stirring in the temple courts. I hurried through
them, and reached the entrance to the pylon that is at the outer
gate. Then, seeking solitude, and, as it were, to draw near to
heaven, I climbed the pylon's two hundred steps, until at length
I reached the massive roof. Here I leaned my breast against the
parapet, and looked forth. As I looked, the red edge of the full
moon floated up over the Arabian hills, and her rays fell upon
the pylon where I stood and the temple walls beyond, lighting the
visages of the carven Gods. Then the cold light struck the
stretch of well-tilled lands, now whitening to the harvest, and
as the heavenly lamp of Isis passed up to the sky, her rays crept
slowly down to the valley, where Sihor, father of the land of
Khem, rolls on toward the sea.</p>

<p>Now the bright beams kissed the water that smiled an answer
back, and now mountain and valley, river, temple, town, and plain
were flooded with white light, for Mother Isis was arisen, and
threw her gleaming robe across the bosom of the earth. It was
beautiful, with the beauty of a dream, and solemn as the hour
after death. Mightily, indeed, the temples towered up against the
face of night. Never had they seemed so grand to me as in that
hour&mdash;those eternal shrines, before whose walls Time himself
shall wither. And it was to be mine to rule this moonlit land;
mine to preserve those sacred shrines, and cherish the honour of
their Gods; mine to cast out the Ptolemy and free Egypt from the
foreign yoke! In my veins ran the blood of those great Kings who
await the day of Resurrection, sleeping in the tombs of the
valley of Thebes. My spirit swelled within me as I dreamed upon
this glorious destiny, I closed my hands, and there, upon the
pylon, I prayed as I had never prayed before to the Godhead, who
is called by many names, and in many forms made manifest.</p>

<p>"O Amen," I prayed, "God of Gods, who hast been from the
beginning; Lord of Truth, who art, and of whom all are, who
givest out thy Godhead and gatherest it up again; in the circle
of whom the Divine ones move and are, who wast from all time the
Self-begot, and who shalt be till time&mdash;hearken unto me (9).</p>

<p class="footnote">9. For a somewhat similar
definition of the Godhead see the funeral papyrus of Nesikhonsu,
a Princess of the Twenty-first Dynasty. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"O Amen&mdash;Osiris, the sacrifice by whom we are justified,
Lord of the Region of the Winds, Ruler of the Ages, Dweller in
the West, the Supreme in Amenti, hearken unto me.</p>

<p>"O Isis, great Mother Goddess, mother of the
Horus&mdash;mysterious Mother, Sister, Spouse, hearken unto me.
If, indeed, I am the chosen of the Gods to carry out the purpose
of the Gods, let a sign be given me, even now, to seal my life to
the life above. Stretch out your arms towards me, O ye Gods, and
uncover the glory of your countenance. Hear! ah, hear me!" And I
cast myself upon my knees and lifted up my eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>And as I knelt, a cloud grew upon the face of the moon
covering it up, so that the night became dark, and the silence
deepened all around&mdash;even the dogs far below in the city
ceased to howl, while the silence grew and grew till it was heavy
as death. I felt my spirit lifted up within me, and my hair rose
upon my head. Then of a sudden the mighty pylon seemed to rock
beneath my feet, a great wind beat about my brows and a voice
spoke within my heart:</p>

<br>

<p>"Behold a sign! Possess thyself in patience, O Harmachis!"</p>

<p>And as the voice spoke, a cold hand touched my hand, and left
somewhat within it. Then the cloud rolled from the face of the
moon, the wind passed, the pylon ceased to tremble, and the night
was as the night had been.</p>

<p>As the light came back, I gazed upon that which had been left
within my hand. It was a bud of the holy lotus new breaking into
bloom, and from it came a most sweet scent.</p>

<p>And while I gazed behold! the lotus passed from my grasp and
was gone, leaving me astonished.</p>

<p class="first">THE dawning of the next day I was awakened by
a priest of the temple, who brought word to me to make ready for
the journey of which my father had spoken, inasmuch as there was
an occasion for me to pass down the river to Annu el Ra. Now this
is the Heliopolis of the Greeks, whither I should go in the
company of some priests of Ptah at Memphis who had come hither to
Abouthis to lay the body of one of their great men in the tomb
that had been prepared near the resting place of the blessed
Osiris.</p>

<p>So I made ready, and the same evening, having received letters
and embraced my father and those about the temple who were dear
to me, I passed down the banks of Sihor, and we sailed with the
south wind. As the pilot stood upon the prow and with a rod in
his hand bade the sailor-men loosen the stakes by which the
vessel was moored to the banks, the old wife, Atoua, hobbled up,
her basket of simples in her hand, and, calling out farewell,
threw a sandal after me for good chance, which sandal I kept for
many years.</p>

<p>So we sailed, and for six days passed down the wonderful
river, making fast each night at some convenient spot. But when I
lost sight of the familiar things that I had seen day by day
since I had eyes to see, and found myself alone among strange
faces, I felt very sore at heart, and would have wept had I not
been ashamed. And of all the wonderful things I saw I will not
write here, for, though they were new to me, have they not been
known to men since such time as the Gods ruled in Egypt? But the
priests who were with me showed me no little honour and expounded
to me what were the things I saw.</p>

<p>On the morning of the seventh day we came to Memphis, the city
of the White Hall. Here, for three days I rested from my journey
and was entertained of the priests of the wonderful Temple of
Ptah the Creator, and shown the beauties of the great and
marvellous city. Also I was led in secret by the High Priest and
two others into the holy presence of the God Apis, the Ptah who
deigns to dwell among men in the form of a bull. The God was
black, and on his forehead there was a white square, on his back
was a white mark shaped like an eagle, beneath his tongue was the
likeness of a scarabaeus, in his tail were double hairs, and a
plate of pure gold hung between his horns. I entered the place of
the God and worshipped, while the High Priest and those with him
stood aside, watching earnestly. And when I had worshipped,
saying the words which had been told me, the God knelt, and lay
down before me. Then the High Priest and those with him, who, as
I heard in after time, were great men of Upper Egypt, approached
wondering, and, saying no word, made obeisance to me because of
the omen. And many other things I saw in Memphis that are too
long to write of here.</p>

<p>On the fourth day some priests of Annu came to lead me to
Sepa, my uncle, the High Priest of Annu. So, having bidden
farewell to those of Memphis, we crossed the river and rode on
asses two parts of a day's journey through many villages, which
we found in great poverty because of the oppression of the tax-
gatherers. Also, as we went, I saw for the first time the great
pyramids that are beyond the image of the God Horemkhu, that
Sphinx whom the Greeks name Harmachis, and the Temples of the
Divine Mother Isis, Queen of the Memnonia, and the God Osiris,
Lord of Rosatou, of which temples, together with the Temple of
the worship of the Divine Menkau-ra, I, Harmachis, am by right
Divine the Hereditary High Priest. I saw them and marvelled at
their greatness and the white carven limestone, and red granite
of Syene, that flashed the sun's rays back to heaven. But at this
time I knew nothing of the treasure that was hid in <i>Her</i>,
which is the third among the pyramids&mdash;would I had never
known of it!</p>

<p>And so at last we came within sight of Annu, which after
Memphis has been seen is no large town, but stands on raised
ground, before which are lakes fed by a canal. Behind the town is
the inclosed field of the Temple of the God Ra.</p>

<p>We dismounted at the pylon, and were met beneath the portico
by a man not great of stature, but of noble aspect, having his
head shaven, and with dark eyes that twinkled like the further
stars.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he cried, in a great voice which fitted his weak body
but ill. "Hold! I am Sepa, who opens the mouth of the Gods!"</p>

<p>"And I," I said, "am Harmachis, son of Amenemhat, Hereditary
High Priest and Ruler of the Holy City Abouthis; and I bear
letters to thee, O Sepa!"</p>

<p>"Enter," he said. "Enter!" scanning me all the while with his
twinkling eyes. "Enter, my son!" And he took me and led me to a
chamber in the inner hall, closed to the door, and then, having
glanced at the letters that I brought, of a sudden he fell upon
my neck and embraced me.</p>

<p>"Welcome," he cried, "welcome, son of my own sister, and hope
of Khem! Not in vain have I prayed the Gods that I might live to
look upon thy face and impart to thee the wisdom which perchance
I alone have mastered of those who are left alive in Egypt. There
are few whom it is lawful that I should teach. But thine is the
great destiny, and thine shall be the ears to hear the lessons of
the Gods."</p>

<p>And he embraced me once more and bade me go bathe and eat,
saying that on the morrow he would speak with me further.</p>

<p>This of a truth he did, and at such length that I will forbear
to set down all he said both then and afterwards, for if I did so
there would be no papyrus left in Egypt when the task was ended.
Therefore, having much to tell and but little time to tell it, I
will pass over the events of the years that followed.</p>

<p>For this was the manner of my life. I rose early, I attended
the worship of the Temple, and I gave my days to study. I learnt
of the rites of religion and their meaning, and of the beginning
of the Gods and the beginning of the Upper World. I learnt of the
mystery of the movements of the stars, and of how the earth rolls
on among them. I was instructed in that ancient knowledge which
is called magic, and in the way of interpretation of dreams, and
of the drawing nigh to God. I was taught the language of symbols
and their outer and inner secrets. I became acquainted with the
eternal laws of Good and Evil, and with the mystery of that trust
which is held of man; also I learnt the secrets of the
pyramids&mdash;which I would that I had never known. Further, I
read the records of the past, and of the acts and words of the
ancient kings who were before me since the rule of Horus upon
earth; and I was made to know all craft of state, the lore of
earth, and with it the history of Greece and Rome. Also I learnt
the Grecian and Roman tongues, of which indeed I already had some
knowledge&mdash;and all this while, for five long years, I kept
my hands clean and my heart pure, and did no evil in the sight of
God or man; but laboured heavily to acquire all things, and to
prepare myself for the destiny that awaited me.</p>

<p>Twice every year greetings and letters came from my father
Amenemhat, and twice every year I sent back my answers asking if
the time had come to cease from labour. And so the days of my
probation sped away till I grew faint and weary at heart, for
being now a man, ay and learned, I longed to make a beginning of
the life of men. And often I wondered if this talk and prophecy
of the things that were to be was but a dream born of the brains
of men whose wish ran before their thought. I was, indeed, of the
Royal blood, that I knew: for my uncle, Sepa the Priest, showed
me a secret record of the descent, traced without break from
father to son, and graven in mystic symbols on a tablet of the
stone of Syene. But of what avail was it to be Royal by right
when Egypt, my heritage, was a slave&mdash;a slave to do the
pleasure and minister to the luxury of the Macedonian
Lagidae&mdash;ay, and when she had been so long a serf that,
perchance, she had forgotten how to put off the servile smile of
Bondage and once more to look across the world with Freedom's
happy eyes?</p>

<p>Then I bethought me of my prayer upon the pylon tower of
Abouthis and of the answer given to my prayer, and wondered if
that, too, were a dream.</p>

<p>And one night, as, weary with study, I walked within the
sacred grove that is in the garden of the temple, and mused thus,
I met my uncle Sepa, who also was walking and thinking.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he cried in his great voice; "why is thy face so sad,
Harmachis? Has the last problem that we studied overwhelmed
thee?"</p>

<p>"Nay, my uncle," I answered, "I am overwhelmed indeed, but not
of the problem; it was a light one. My heart is heavy, for I am
weary of life within these cloisters, and the piled-up weight of
knowledge crushes me. It is of no avail to store up force which
cannot be used."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou art impatient, Harmachis," he answered; "it is ever
the way of foolish youth. Thou wouldst taste of the battle; thou
dost tire of watching the breakers fall upon the beach, thou
wouldst plunge into them and venture the desperate hazard of the
war. And so thou wouldst be going, Harmachis? The bird would fly
the nest as, when they are grown, the swallows fly from the eaves
of the Temple. Well, it shall be as thou desirest; the hour is at
hand. I have taught thee all that I have learned, and methinks
that the pupil has outrun his master," and he paused and wiped
his bright black eyes, for he was very sad at the thought of my
departure.</p>

<p>"And whither shall I go, my uncle?" I asked rejoicing; "back
to Abouthis to be initiated into the mysteries of the Gods?"</p>

<p>"Ay, back to Abouthis, and from Abouthis to Alexandria, and
from Alexandria to the Throne of thy fathers, Harmachis! Listen,
now; things are thus: Thou knowest how Cleopatra, the Queen, fled
into Syria when that false eunuch Pothinus set the will of her
father Aulêtes at naught and raised her brother Ptolemy to the
sole lordship of Egypt. Thou knowest also how she came back, like
a Queen indeed, with a great army in her train, and lay at
Pelusium, and how at this juncture the mighty Caesar, that great
man, that greatest of all men, sailed with a weak company hither
to Alexandria from Pharsalia's bloody field in hot pursuit of
Pompey. But he found Pompey already dead, having been basely
murdered by Achillas, the General, and Lucius Septimius, the
chief of the Roman legions in Egypt, and thou knowest how the
Alexandrians were troubled at his coming and would have slain his
lictors. Then, as thou hast heard, Caesar seized Ptolemy, the
young King, and his sister Arsinoë, and bade the army of
Cleopatra and the army of Ptolemy, under Achillas, which lay
facing each other at Pelusium, disband and go their ways. And for
answer Achillas marched on Caesar, and besieged him straitly in
the Bruchium at Alexandria, and so, for a while, things were, and
none knew who should reign in Egypt. But then Cleopatra took up
the dice, and threw them, and this was the throw she
made&mdash;in truth, it was a bold one. For, leaving the army at
Pelusium, she came at dusk to the harbour of Alexandria, and
alone with the Sicilian Apollodorus entered and landed. Then
Apollodorus bound her in a bale of rich rugs, such as are made in
Syria, and sent the rugs as a present to Caesar. And when the
rugs were unbound in the palace, behold! within them was the
fairest girl on all the earth&mdash;ay, and the most witty and
the most learned. And she seduced the great Caesar&mdash;even his
weight of years did not avail to protect him from her
charms&mdash;so that, as a fruit of his folly, he wellnigh lost
his life, and all the glory he had gained in a hundred wars."</p>

<p>"The fool!" I broke in&mdash;"the fool! Thou callest him
great; but how can the man be truly great who has no strength to
stand against a woman's wiles? Caesar, with the world hanging on
his word! Caesar, at whose breath forty legions marched and
changed the fate of peoples! Caesar the cold! the far- seeing!
the hero!&mdash;Caesar to fall like a ripe fruit into a false
girl's lap! Why, in the issue, of what common clay was this Roman
Caesar, and how poor a thing!"</p>

<p>But Sepa looked at me and shook his head. "Be not so rash,
Harmachis, and talk not with so proud a voice. Knowest thou not
that in every suit of mail there is a joint, and woe to him who
wears the harness if the sword should search it out! For Woman,
in her weakness, is yet the strongest force upon the earth. She
is the helm of all things human; she comes in many shapes and
knocks at many doors; she is quick and patient, and her passion
is not ungovernable like that of man, but as a gentle steed that
she can guide e'en where she will, and as occasion offers can now
bit up and now give rein. She has a captain's eye, and stout must
be that fortress of the heart in which she finds no place of
vantage. Does thy blood beat fast in youth? She will outrun it,
nor will her kisses tire. Art thou set toward ambition? She will
unlock thy inner heart, and show thee roads that lead to glory.
Art thou worn and weary? She has comfort in her breast. Art thou
fallen? She can lift thee up, and to the illusion of thy sense
gild defeat with triumph. Ay, Harmachis, she can do these things,
for Nature ever fights upon her side; and while she does them she
can deceive and shape a secret end in which thou hast no part.
And thus Woman rules the world. For her are wars; for her men
spend their strength in gathering gains; for her they do well and
ill, and seek for greatness, to find oblivion. But still she sits
like yonder Sphinx, and smiles; and no man has ever read all the
riddle of her smile, or known all the mystery of her heart. Mock
not! mock not! Harmachis; for he must be great indeed who can
defy the power of Woman, which, pressing round him like the
invisible air, is often strongest when the senses least discover
it."</p>

<p class="caption">"Still she sits like yonder Sphinx, and smiles."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I laughed aloud. "Thou speakest earnestly, my uncle Sepa," I
said; "one might almost think that thou hadst not come unscathed
through this fierce fire of temptation. Well, for myself, I fear
not woman and her wiles; I know naught of them, and naught do I
wish to know; and I still hold that this Caesar was a fool. Had I
stood where Caesar stood, to cool its wantonness that bale of
rugs should have been rolled down the palace steps, into the
harbour mud."</p>

<p>"Nay, cease! cease!" he cried aloud. "It is evil to speak
thus; may the Gods avert the omen and preserve to thee this cold
strength of which thou boastest. Oh! man, thou knowest
not!&mdash;thou in thy strength and beauty that is without
compare, in the power of thy learning and the sweetness of thy
tongue&mdash;thou knowest not! The world where thou must mix is
not a sanctuary as that of the Divine Isis. But there&mdash;it
may be so! Pray that thy heart's ice may never melt, so thou
shalt be great and happy and Egypt shall be delivered. And now
let me take up my tale&mdash;thou seest, Harmachis, even in so
grave a story woman claims her place. The young Ptolemy,
Cleopatra's brother, being loosed of Caesar, treacherously turned
on him. Then Caesar and Mithridates stormed the camp of Ptolemy,
who took to flight across the river. But his boat was sunk by the
fugitives who pressed upon it, and such was the miserable end of
Ptolemy.</p>

<p>"Thereon, the war being ended, though she had but then borne
him a son, Caesarion, Caesar appointed the younger Ptolemy to
rule with Cleopatra, and be her husband in name, and he himself
departed for Rome, bearing with him the beautiful Princess
Arsinoë to follow his triumph in her chains. But the great Caesar
is no more. He died as he had lived, in blood, and right royally.
And but now Cleopatra, the Queen, if my tidings may be trusted,
has slain Ptolemy, her brother and husband, by poison, and taken
the child Caesarion to be her fellow on the throne, which she
holds by the help of the Roman legions, and, as they say, of
young Sextus Pompeius, who has succeeded Caesar in her love. But,
Harmachis, the whole land boils and seethes against her. In every
city the children of Khem talk of the deliverer who is to
come&mdash;and thou art he, Harmachis. The time is almost ripe.
The hour is nigh at hand. Go thou back to Abouthis and learn the
last secrets of the Gods, and meet those who shall direct the
bursting of the storm. Then act, Harmachis&mdash;act, I say, and
strike home for Khem, rid the land of the Roman and the Greek,
and take thy place upon the throne of thy divine fathers and be a
King of men. For to this end thou wast born, O Prince!"</p>

<p class="first">THE next day I embraced my uncle Sepa, and
with an eager heart departed from Annu back to Abouthis. To be
short, I came thither in safety, having been absent five years
and a month, being now no more a boy but a man full grown and
having my mind well stocked with the knowledge of men and the
ancient wisdom of Egypt. So once again I saw the old lands, and
the known faces, though of these some few were wanting, having
been gathered to Osiris. Now, as, riding across the fields, I
came nigh to the enclosure of the Temple, the priests and people
issued forth to bid me welcome, and with them the old wife,
Atoua, who, but for a few added wrinkles that Time had cut upon
her forehead, was just as she had been when she threw the sandal
after me five long years before.</p>

<p>"<i>La! la! la!</i>" she cried; "and there thou art, my bonny
lad; more bonny even than thou wert! <i>La!</i> what a man! what
shoulders! and what a face and form! Ah, it does an old woman
credit to have dandled thee! But thou art over-pale; those
priests down there at Annu have starved thee, surely? Starve not
thyself: the Gods love not a skeleton. 'Empty stomach makes empty
head' as they say at Alexandria. But this is a glad hour; ay, a
joyous hour. Come in&mdash;come in!" and as I lighted down she
embraced me.</p>

<p>But I thrust her aside. "My father! where is my father?" I
cried; "I see him not!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, have no fear," she answered; 'his Holiness is well;
he waits thee in his chamber. There, pass on. O happy day! O
happy Abouthis!"</p>

<p>So I went, or rather ran, and reached the chamber of which I
have written, and there at the table sat my father, Amenemhat,
the same as he had been, but very old. I came to him and,
kneeling before him, kissed his hand, and he blessed me.</p>

<p>"Look up, my son," he said, "let my old eyes gaze upon thy
face, that I may read thy heart."</p>

<p>So I lifted up my head, and he looked upon me long and
earnestly.</p>

<p>"I read thee," he said at length; "thou art pure and strong in
wisdom; I have not been deceived in thee. Oh, the years have been
lonely; but I did well to send thee hence. Now, tell me of thy
life; for thy letters have told me little, and thou canst not
know, my son, how hungry is a father's heart."</p>

<p>And so I told him; we sat far into the night and talked
together. And in the end he bade me know that I must now prepare
to be initiated into those last mysteries that are learned of the
chosen of the Gods.</p>

<p>And so it came about that for a space of three months I
prepared myself according to the holy customs. I ate no meat. I
was constant in the sanctuaries, in the study of the secrets of
the Great Sacrifice and of the woe of the Holy Mother. I watched
and prayed before the altars. I lifted up my soul to God; ay, in
dreams I communed with the Invisible, till at length earth and
earth's desires seemed to pass from me. I longed no more for the
glory of this world, my heart hung above it as an eagle on his
outstretched wings, and the voice of the world's blame could not
stir it, and the vision of its beauty brought no delight. For
above me was the vast vault of heaven, where in unalterable
procession the stars pass on, drawing after them the destinies of
men; where the Holy Ones sit upon their burning thrones, and
watch the chariot- wheels of Fate as they roll from sphere to
sphere. O hours of holy contemplation! who, having once tasted of
your joy could wish again to grovel on the earth? O vile flesh to
drag us down! I would that thou hadst then altogether fallen from
me, and left my spirit free to seek Osiris!</p>

<p>The months of probation passed but too swiftly, and now the
holy day drew near when I was in truth to be united to the
universal Mother. Never hath Night so longed for the promise of
the Dawn; never hath the heart of a lover so passionately desired
the sweet coming of his bride, as I longed to see Thy glorious
face, O Isis! Even now that I have been faithless to Thee, and
Thou art far from me, O Divine! my soul goes out to Thee, and
once more I know &mdash;But as it is bidden that I should draw
the veil, and speak of things which have not been told since the
beginning of this world, let me pass on and reverently set down
the history of that holy morn.</p>

<p>For seven days the great festival had been celebrated, the
suffering of the Lord Osiris had been commemorated, the grief of
the Mother Isis had been sung and glory had been done to the
memory of the coming of the Divine Child Horus, the Son, the
Avenger, the God-begot. All these things had been carried out
according to the ancient rites. The boats had floated on the
sacred lake, the priests had scourged themselves before the
sanctuaries, and the images had been borne through the streets at
night.</p>

<p>And now, as the sun sank on the seventh day, once more the
great procession gathered to chant the woes of Isis and tell how
the evil was avenged. We went in silence from the temple, and
passed through the city ways. First came those who clear the
path, then my father Amenemhat in all his priestly robes, and the
wand of cedar in his hand. Then, clad in pure linen, I, the
neophyte, followed alone; and after me the white-robed priests,
holding aloft banners and emblems of the Gods. Next came those
who bear the sacred boat, and after them the singers and the
mourners; while, stretching as far as the eye could reach, all
the people marched, clad in melancholy black because Osiris was
no more. We went in silence through the city streets till at
length we came to the wall of the temple and passed in. And as my
father, the High Priest, entered beneath the gateway of the outer
pylon, a sweet-voiced woman singer began to sing the Holy Chant,
and thus she sang:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">

"Sing we Osiris dead,<br>

Lament the fallen head:<br>

The light has left the world, the world is grey.<br>

Athwart the starry skies<br>

The web of Darkness flies,<br>

And Isis weeps Osiris passed away.<br>

Your tears, ye stars, ye fires, ye rivers, shed,<br>

Weep, children of the Nile, weep for your Lord is dead!"</p>

<p><br>
She paused in her most sweet song, and the whole multitude
took up the melancholy dirge:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">
"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
The chorus ceased, and once again she sang:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Within the court divine<br>

The Sevenfold sacred shrine<br>

We pass, while echoes of the Temple walls<br>

Repeat the long lament<br>

The sound of sorrow sent<br>

Far up within the imperishable halls,<br>

Where, each in the other's arms, the Sisters weep,<br>

Isis and Nephthys, o'er His unawaking sleep."</p>


<p><br>
And then again rolled forth the solemn chorus of a thousand
voices:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
It ceased, and sweetly she took up the song:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"O dweller in the West,<br>

Lover and Lordliest,<br>

Thy love, thy Sister Isis, calls thee home!<br>

Come from thy chamber dun<br>

Thou Master of the Sun,<br>

Thy shadowy chamber far below the foam!<br>

With weary wings and spent<br>

Through all the firmament,<br>

Through all the horror-haunted ways of Hell,<br>

I seek thee near and far,<br>

From star to wandering star,<br>

Free with the dead that in Amenti dwell.<br>

I search the height, the deep, the lands, the skies,<br>

Rise from the dead and live, our Lord Osiris,
rise!"</p>

<p class="verse">

"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
Now in a strain more high and glad the singer sang:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">

"He wakes&mdash;from forth the prison<br>

We sing Osiris risen,<br>

We sing the child that Nout conceived and bare.<br>

Thine own love, Isis, waits<br>

The Warden of the Gates,<br>

She breathes the breath of Life on breast and hair,<br>

And in her breast and breath<br>

Behold! he waketh,<br>

Behold! at length he riseth out of rest;<br>

Touched with her holy hands,<br>

The Lord of all the Lands,<br>

He stirs, he rises from her breath, her breast!<br>

But thou, fell Typhon, fly,<br>

The judgment day drawn nigh,<br>

Fleet on thy track as flame speeds Horus from the sky."</p>

<p class="verse">
"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
Once more, as we bowed before the Holy, she sang, and sent the
full breath of her glad music ringing up the everlasting walls
till the silence quivered with her round notes of melody, and the
hearts of those who hearkened stirred strangely in the breast.
And thus, as we walked, she sang the song of Osiris risen, the
song of Hope, the song of Victory:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Sing we the Trinity,<br>

Sing we the Holy Three,<br>

Sing we, and praise we and worship the Throne,<br>

Throne that our Lord hath set&mdash;<br>

There peace and truth are met<br>

There in the Halls of the Holy alone!<br>

There in the shadowings<br>

Faint of the folded wings,<br>

There shall we dwell and rejoice in our rest,<br>

We that thy servants are!<br>

Horus drive ill afar!<br>

Far in the folds of the dark of the West!"</p>

<p><br>
Again, as her notes died away, thundered forth the chorus of
all the voices:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
The chanting ceased, and as the sun sank the High Priest
raised the statue of the living God and held it before the
multitude that was now gathered in the court of the temple. Then,
with a mighty and joyful shout of:</p>

<p>"<i>Osiris our hope! Osiris! Osiris!</i>"</p>

<p>The people tore their black wrappings from their dress,
revealing the white robes they wore beneath, and, as one man,
they bowed before the God, and the feast was ended.</p>

<p><br>
But for me the ceremony was only begun, for to-night was the
night of my initiation. Leaving the inner court I bathed myself,
and, clad in pure linen, passed, as it is ordained, into an
inner, but not the inmost, sanctuary, and laid the accustomed
offerings on the altar. Then, lifting my hands to heaven, I
remained for many hours in contemplation, striving, by holy
thoughts and prayer, to gather up my strength against the mighty
moment of my trial.</p>

<p>The hours sped slowly in the silence of the temple, till at
length the door opened and my father Amenemhat, the High Priest,
came in, clad in white, and leading by the hand the Priest of
Isis. For, having been married, he did not himself enter into the
mysteries of the Holy Mother.</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and stood humbly before them.</p>

<p>"Art thou ready?" said the priest, lifting the lamp he held so
that its light fell upon my face. "O thou chosen one, art thou
ready to see the glory of the Goddess face to face?"</p>

<p>"I am ready," I answered.</p>

<p>"Behold thee," he said again, in solemn tones, "it is no small
thing. If thou wilt carry out this thy last desire, understand,
royal Harmachis, that now this very night thou must die for a
while in the flesh, what time thy soul shall look on spiritual
things. And if thou diest and any evil shall be found within thy
heart, when thou comest at last into that awful presence, woe
unto thee, Harmachis, for the breath of life shall no more enter
in at the gateway of thy mouth, thy body shall utterly perish,
and what shall befall thy other parts, if I know, I may not say
(10). Art thou prepared to be taken to the breast of Her who Was
and Is and Shall Be, and in all things to do Her holy will; for
Her, while she shall so command, to put away the thought of
earthly woman; and to labour always for Her glory till at the end
thy life is gathered to Her eternal life?"</p>

<p class="footnote">10. According to the Egyptian religion the
being Man is composed of four parts: the body, the double or
astral shape (<i>ka</i>), the soul (<i>bi</i>), and the spark of
life sprung from the Godhead (<i>khou</i>). &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"I am," I answered; "lead on."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the priest. "Noble Amenemhat, we go hence
alone."</p>

<p>"Farewell, my son," said my father; "be firm and triumph over
things spiritual as thou shalt triumph over things earthly. He
who would truly rule the world must first be lifted up above the
world. He must be at one with God, for thus only shall he learn
the secrets of the Divine. But beware! The Gods demand much of
those who dare to enter the circle of their Divinity. If they go
back therefrom, they shall be judged of a sharper law, and
scourged with a heavier rod, for as their glory is, so shall
their shame be. Therefore, make thy heart strong, royal
Harmachis! And when thou speedest down the ways of Night and
enterest the Holies, remember that from him to whom great gifts
have been given shall gifts be required again. And now&mdash;if,
indeed, thy mind be fixed&mdash;go whither it is not as yet given
me to follow thee. Farewell!"</p>

<p>For a moment as my heart weighed these heavy words, I wavered,
as well as I might. But I was filled with longing to be gathered
to the company of the Divine ones, and I knew that I had no evil
in me, and desired to do only the thing that is just. Therefore,
having with so much labour drawn the bowstring to my ear, I was
fain to let fly the shaft. "Lead on," I cried with a loud voice;
"lead on, thou holy Priest! I follow thee!"</p>

<p>And we went forth.</p>

<p class="first">SILENCE we passed into the Shrine of Isis. It
was dark and bare &mdash;only the feeble light from the lamp
gleamed faintly upon the sculptured walls, where, in a hundred
effigies, the Holy Mother suckled the Holy Child.</p>

<p>The priest closed the doors and bolted them. "Once again," he
said, "art thou ready, Harmachis?"</p>

led me to the centre of the Holy, and with a swift motion put out
the lamp.</p>

<p>"Look before thee, Harmachis!" he cried; and his voice sounded
hollow in the solemn place.</p>

<p>I gazed and saw nothing. But from the niche that is high in
the wall, where is hid that sacred symbol of the Goddess on which
few may look, there came a sound as of the rattling rods of the
sistrum (11). And as I listened, awestruck, behold! I saw the
outline of the symbol drawn as with fire upon the blackness of
the air. It hung above my head, and rattled while it hung. And,
as it turned, I clearly saw the face of the Mother Isis that is
graven on the one side, and signifies unending Birth, and the
face of her holy sister, Nephthys, that is graven on the other,
and signifies the ending of all birth in Death.</p>

<p class="footnote">11. A musical instrument peculiarly sacred to
Isis of which the shape and rods had a mystic significance.
&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>Slowly it turned and swung as though some mystic dancer trod
the air above me, and shook it in her hand. But at length the
light went out, and the rattling ceased.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the end of the chamber became luminous, and
in that white light I beheld picture after picture. I saw the
ancient Nile rolling through deserts to the sea. There were no
men upon its banks, nor any signs of man, nor any temples to the
Gods. Only wild birds moved on Sihor's lonely face, and monstrous
brutes plunged and wallowed in his waters. The sun sank in
majesty behind the Libyan Desert and stained the waters red; the
mountains towered up towards the silent sky; but in mountain,
desert, and river there was no sign of human life. Then I knew
that I saw the world as it had been before man was, and a terror
of its loneliness entered my soul.</p>

<p class="caption">"I saw the world as it had been before man was."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The picture passed and another rose up in its place. Once
again I saw the banks of Sihor, and on them crowded wild-faced
creatures, partaking of the nature of the ape more than of the
nature of mankind. They fought and slew each other. The wild
birds sprang up in affright as the fire leapt from reed huts
given by foemen's hands to flame and pillage. They stole and rent
and murdered, dashing out the brains of children with axes of
stone. And, though no voice told me, I knew that I saw man as he
was tens of thousands of years ago, when first he marched across
the earth.</p>

<p>Yet another picture. Again I beheld the banks of Sihor; but on
them fair cities bloomed like flowers. In and out their gates
went men and women, passing to and fro from wide, well-tilled
lands. But I saw no guards or armies, and no weapons of war. All
was wisdom, prosperity, and peace. And while I wondered, a
glorious Figure, clad in raiment that shone as flame, came from
the gates of a shrine, and the sound of music went before and
followed after him. He mounted an ivory throne which was set in a
market-place facing the water: and as the sun sank called in all
the multitudes to prayer. With one voice they prayed, bending in
adoration. And I understood that herein was shown the reign of
the Gods on earth, which was long before the days of Menes.</p>

<p>A change came over the dream. Still the same fair city, but
other men &mdash;men with greed and evil on their faces&mdash;who
hated the bonds of righteous doing, and set their hearts on sin.
The evening came; the glorious Figure mounted the throne and
called to prayer, but none bowed themselves in adoration.</p>

<p>"We are aweary of thee!" they cried. "Make Evil King! Slay
him! slay him! and loose the bonds of Evil! Make Evil King!"</p>

<p>The glorious Shape rose up, gazing with mild eyes upon those
wicked men.</p>

<p>"Ye know not what ye ask," he cried; "but as ye will, so be
it! For if I die, by me, after much travail, shall ye once again
find a path to the Kingdom of Good!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a Form, foul and hideous to behold, leapt
upon him, cursing, slew him, tore him limb from limb, and amidst
the clamour of the people sat himself upon the throne and ruled.
But a Shape whose face was veiled passed down from heaven on
shadowy wings, and with lamentations gathered up the rent
fragments of the Being. A moment she bent herself upon them, then
lifted up her hands and wept. And as she wept, behold! from her
side there sprang a warrior armed and with a face like the face
of Ra at noon. He, the Avenger, hurled himself with a shout upon
the Monster who had usurped the throne, and they closed in
battle, and, struggling ever in a strait embrace, passed upward
to the skies.</p>

<p>Then came picture after picture. I saw Powers and Peoples clad
in various robes and speaking many tongues. I saw them pass and
pass in millions&mdash; loving, hating, struggling, dying. Some
few were happy and some had woe stamped upon their faces; but
most bore not the seal of happiness nor of woe, but rather that
of patience. And ever as they passed from age to age, high above
in the heavens the Avenger fought on with the Evil Thing, while
the scale of victory swung now here now there. But neither
conquered, nor was it given to me to know how the battle
ended.</p>

<p>And I understood that what I had beheld was the holy vision of
the struggle between the Good and the Evil Powers. I saw that man
was created vile, but Those who are above took pity on him, and
came down to him to make him good and happy, for the two things
are one thing. But man returned to his wicked way, and then the
bright Spirit of Good, who is of us called Osiris, but who has
many names, offered himself up for the evil-doing of the race
that had dethroned him. And from him and the Divine Mother, of
whom all nature is, sprang another spirit who is the Protector of
us on earth, as Osiris is our justifier in Amenti.</p>

<p>For this is the mystery of the Osiris.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, as I saw the visions, these things became clear
to me. The mummy cloths of symbol and of ceremony that wrap
Osiris round fell from him, and I understood the secret of
religion, which is Sacrifice.</p>

<p>The pictures passed, and again the priest, my guide, spoke to
me.</p>

<p>"Hast thou understood, Harmachis, those things which it has
been granted thee to see?"</p>

<p>"I have," I said. "Are the rites ended?"</p>

<p>"Nay, they are but begun. That which follows thou must endure
alone! Behold I leave thee, to return at the morning light. Once
more I warn thee. That which thou shalt see, few may look upon
and live. In all my days I have known but three who dared to face
this dread hour, and of those three at dawn but one was found
alive. Myself, I have not trod this path. It is too high for
me."</p>

<p>"Depart," I said; "my soul is athirst for knowledge. I will
dare it."</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon my shoulder and blessed me. He went. I
heard the door shut to behind him, the echoes of his footsteps
slowly died away.</p>

<p>Then I felt that I was alone, alone in the Holy Place with
Things which are not of the earth. Silence fell&mdash;silence
deep and black as the darkness which was around me. The silence
fell, it gathered as the cloud gathered on the face of the moon
that night when, a lad, I prayed upon the pylon towers. It
gathered denser and yet more dense till it seemed to creep into
my heart and call aloud therein; for utter silence has a voice
that is more terrible than any cry. I spoke; the echoes of my
words came back upon me from the walls and seemed to beat me
down. The stillness was lighter to endure than an echo such as
this. What was I about to see? Should I die, even now, in the
fulness of my youth and strength? Terrible were the warnings that
had been given to me. I was fear-stricken, and bethought me that
I would fly. Fly! &mdash;fly whither? The temple door was barred;
I could not fly. I was alone with the Godhead, alone with the
Power that I had invoked. Nay, my heart was pure&mdash;my heart
was pure. I would face the terror that was to come, ay, even
though I died.</p>

<p>"Isis, Holy Mother," I prayed. "Isis, Spouse of Heaven, come
unto me, be with me now; I faint! be with me now."</p>

<p>And then I knew that things were not as things had been. The
air around me began to stir, it rustled as the wings of eagles
rustle, it took life. Bright eyes gazed upon me, strange whispers
shook my soul. Upon the darkness were bars of light. They changed
and interchanged, they moved to and fro and wove mystic symbols
which I could not read. Swifter and swifter flew that shuttle of
the light: the symbols grouped, gathered, faded, gathered yet
again, faster and still more fast, till my eyes could count them
no more. Now I was afloat upon a sea of glory; it surged and
rolled, as the ocean rolls; it tossed me high, it brought me low.
Glory was piled on glory, splendour heaped on splendour's head,
and I rode above it all!</p>

<p>Soon the lights began to pale in the rolling sea of air. Great
shadows shot across it, lines of darkness pierced it and rushed
together on its breast, till, at length, I was only a Shape of
Flame set like a star on the bosom of immeasurable night. Bursts
of awful music gathered from far away. Miles and miles away I
heard them, thrilling faintly through the gloom. On they came,
nearer and more near, louder and more loud, till they swept past,
above, below, around me, swept on rushing pinions, terrifying and
enchanting me. They floated by, ever growing fainter, till they
died in space. Then others came, and no two were akin. Some
rattled as ten thousand sistra shaken all to tune. Some rank from
the brazen throats of unnumbered clarions. Some pealed with a
loud, sweet chant of voices that were more than human; and some
rolled along in the slow thunder of a million drums. They passed;
their notes were lost in dying echoes; and the silence once more
pressed in upon me and overcame me.</p>

<p>The strength within me began to fail. I felt my life ebbing at
its springs. Death drew near to me and his shape was
<i>Silence</i>. He entered at my heart, entered with a sense of
numbing cold, but my brain was still alive, I could yet think. I
knew that I was drawing near the confines of the Dead. Nay, I was
dying fast, and oh, the horror of it! I strove to pray and could
not; there was no more time for prayer. One struggle and the
stillness crept into my brain. The terror passed; an unfathomable
weight of sleep pressed me down. I was dying, I was dying, and
then&mdash;nothingness!</p>

<p><i>I was dead!</i></p>

<p>A change&mdash;life came back to me, but between the new life
and the life that had been was a gulf and difference. Once again
I stood in the darkness of the shrine, but it blinded me no more.
It was clear as the light of day, although it still was black. I
stood; and yet it was not I who stood, but rather my spiritual
part, for at my feet lay my dead Self. There it lay, rigid and
still, a stamp of awful calm sealed upon its face, while I gazed
on it.</p>

<p>And as I gazed, filled with wonder, I was caught up on the
Wings of Flame and whirled away! away! faster than the lightnings
flash. Down I fell, through depths of empty space set here and
there with glittering crowns of stars. Down for ten million miles
and ten times ten million, till at length I hovered over a place
of soft, unchanging light, wherein were Temples, Palaces, and
Abodes, such as no man ever saw in the visions of his sleep. They
were built of Flame, and they were built of Blackness. Their
spires pierced up and up; their great courts stretched around.
Even as I hovered they changed continually to the eye; what was
Flame became Blackness, what was Blackness became Flame. Here was
the flash of crystal, and there the blaze of gems shone even
through the glory that rolls around the city which is in the
Place of Death. There were trees, and their voice as they rustled
was the voice of music; there was air, and, as it blew, its
breath was the sobbing notes of song.</p>

<p>Shapes, changing, mysterious, wonderful, rushed up to meet me,
and bore me down till I seemed to stand upon another earth.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" cried a great Voice.</p>

<p>"Harmachis," answered the Shapes, that changed continually.
"Harmachis who hath been summoned from the earth to look upon the
face of Her that Was and Is and Shall Be. Harmachis, Child of
Earth!"</p>

<p>"Throw back the Gates and open wide the Doors!" pealed the
awful Voice. "Throw back the Gates and open wide the Doors; seal
up his lips in silence, lest his voice jar upon the harmonies of
Heaven, take away his sight lest he see that which may not be
seen, and let Harmachis, who hath been summoned, pass down the
path that leads to the place of the Unchanging. Pass on, Child of
Earth; but before thou goest, look up that thou mayest learn how
far thou art removed from Earth."</p>

<p>I looked up. Beyond the glory that shone about the city was
black night, and high on its bosom twinkled one tiny star.</p>

<p>"Behold the world that thou hast left," said the Voice,
"behold and tremble."</p>

<p>Then my lips and eyes were sealed with silence and with
darkness, so that I was dumb and blind. The Gates rolled back,
the Doors swung wide, and I was swept into the city that is in
the Place of Death. I was swept swiftly I know not whither, till
at length I stood upon my feet. Again the great Voice pealed:</p>

<p>"Draw the veil of blackness from his eyes, unseal the silence
on his lips, that Harmachis, Child of Earth, may see, hear, and
understand, and make adoration at the Shrine of Her that Was and
Is and Shall Be."</p>

<p>And my lips and eyes were touched once more, so that my sight
and speech came back.</p>

<p>Behold! I stood within a hall of blackest marble, so lofty
that even in the rosy light scarce could my vision reach the
great groins of the roof. Music wailed about its spaces, and all
adown its length stood winged Spirits fashioned in living fire,
and such was the brightness of their forms that I could not look
on them. In its centre was an altar, small and square, and I
stood before the empty altar. Then again the Voice cried:</p>

<p>"O Thou that hast been, art, and shalt be; Thou who, having
many names, art yet without a name; Measurer of Time; Messenger
of God; Guardian of the Worlds and the Races that dwell thereon;
Universal Mother born of Nothingness; Creatix uncreated; Living
Splendour without Form, Living Form without Substance; Servant of
the Invisible; Child of Law; Holder of the Scales and Sword of
Fate; Vessel of Life, through whom all Life flows, to whom it
again is gathered; Recorder of Things Done; Executrix of
Decrees&mdash; <i>Hear!</i></p>

<p>"Harmachis the Egyptian, who by Thy will hath been summoned
from the earth, waits before Thine Altar, with ears unstopped,
with eyes unsealed, and with an open heart. Hear and descend!
Descend, O Many-shaped! Descend in Flame! Descend in Sound!
Descend in Spirit! Hear and descend!"</p>

<p>The Voice ceased and there was silence. Then through the
silence came a sound like the booming of the sea. It passed and
presently, moved thereto by I know not what, I raised my eyes
from my hands with which I had covered them, and saw a small dark
cloud hanging over the Altar in and out of which a fiery Serpent
climbed.</p>

<p>Then all the Spirits clad in light fell upon the marble floor,
and with a loud voice adored; but what they said I could not
understand. Behold! the dark cloud came down and rested on the
Altar, the Serpent of fire stretched itself towards me, touched
me on the forehead with its forky tongue and was gone. From
within the cloud a Voice sweet and low and clear spoke in
heavenly accents:</p>

<p>"Depart, ye Ministers, leave Me with my son whom I have
summoned."</p>

<p>Then like arrows rushing from a bow the flame-clad Spirits
leapt from the ground and sped away.</p>

<p>"O Harmachis," said the Voice, "be not afraid, I am She whom
thou dost know as Isis of the Egyptians; but what else I am
strive not thou to learn, it is beyond thy strength. For I am all
things, Life is my spirit, and Nature is my raiment. I am the
laughter of the babe, I am the maiden's love, I am the mother's
kiss. I am the Child and Servant of the Invisible that is God,
that is Law, that is Fate&mdash;though myself I be not God and
Fate and Law. When winds blow and oceans roar upon the face of
the Earth thou hearest my voice; when thou gazest on the starry
firmament thou seest my countenance; when the spring blooms out
in flowers, that is my smile, Harmachis. For I am Nature's self,
and all her shapes are shapes of Me. I breathe in all that
breathes. I wax and wane in the changeful moon: I grow and gather
in the tides: I rise with the suns: I flash with the lightning
and thunder in the storms. Nothing is too great for the measure
of my majesty, nothing is so small that I cannot find a home
therein. I am in thee and thou art in Me, O Harmachis. That which
bade thee be bade Me also be. Therefore, though I am great and
thou art little, have no fear. For we are bound together by the
common bond of life&mdash;that life which flows through suns and
stars and spaces, through Spirits and the souls of men, welding
all Nature to a whole that, changing ever, is yet eternally the
same."</p>

<p>I bowed my head&mdash;I could not speak, for I was afraid.</p>

<p>"Faithfully hast thou served Me, O my son," went on the low
sweet Voice; "greatly thou hast longed to be brought face to face
with Me here in Amenti; and greatly hast thou dared to accomplish
thy desire. For it is no small thing to cast off the tabernacle
of the Flesh and before the appointed time, if only for an hour,
put on the raiment of the Spirit. And greatly, O my servant and
my son, have I, too, desired to look on thee there where I am.
For the Gods love those who love them, but with a wider and
deeper love, and under One who is as far from Me as I am from
thee, mortal, I am a God of Gods. Therefore I have caused thee to
be brought hither, Harmachis; and therefore I speak to thee, my
son, and bid thee commune with Me now face to face, as thou didst
commune that night upon the temple towers of Abouthis. For I was
there with thee, Harmachis, as I was in ten thousand other
worlds. It was I, O Harmachis, who laid the lotus in thy hand,
giving thee the sign which thou didst seek. For thou art of the
kingly blood of my children who served Me from age to age. And if
thou dost not fail thou shalt sit upon that kingly throne and
restore my ancient worship in its purity, and sweep my temples
from their defilements. But if thou dost fail, then shall the
eternal Spirit Isis become but a memory in Egypt."</p>

<p>The Voice paused; and, gathering up my strength, at length I
spoke aloud:</p>

<p>"Tell me, O Holy," I said, "shall I then fail?"</p>

<p>"Ask Me not," answered the Voice, "that which it is not lawful
that I should answer thee. Perchance I can read that which shall
befall thee, perchance it doth not please Me so to read. What can
it profit the Divine, that hath all time wherein to await the
issues, to be eager to look upon the blossom that is not blown,
but which, lying a seed in the bosom of the earth, shall blow in
its season? Know, Harmachis, that I do not shape the Future; the
Future is to thee and not to Me; for it is born of Law and of the
rule ordained of the Invisible. Yet thou art free to act therein,
and thou shalt win or thou shalt fail according to thy strength
and the measure of thy heart's purity. Thine be the burden,
Harmachis, as thine in the event shall be the glory or the shame.
Little do I reck of the issue, I who am but the Minister of what
is written. Now hear me: I will always be with thee, my son, for
my love once given can never be taken away, though by sin it may
seem lost to thee. Remember then this: if thou dost triumph, thy
guerdon shall be great; if thou dost fail, heavy indeed shall be
thy punishment both in the flesh and in the land that thou
callest Amenti. Yet this for thy comfort: shame and agony shall
not be eternal. For however deep the fall from righteousness, if
but repentance holds the heart, there is a path&mdash;a stony and
a cruel path&mdash;whereby the height may be climbed again. Let
it not be thy lot to follow it, Harmachis!</p>

<p>"And now, because thou hast loved Me, my son, and, wandering
through the maze of fable, wherein men lose themselves upon the
earth, mistaking the substance for the Spirit, and the Altar for
the God, hast yet grasped a clue of Truth the Many-faced; and
because I love thee and look on to the day that, perchance, shall
come when thou shalt dwell blessed in my light and in the doing
of my tasks: because of this, I say, it shall be given to thee, O
Harmachis, to hear the Word whereby I may be summoned from the
Uttermost, by one who hath communed with Me, and to look upon the
face of Isis&mdash;even into the eyes of the Messenger, and not
die the death.</p>

<p>"<i>Behold!</i>"</p>

<p>The sweet Voice ceased; the dark cloud upon the altar changed
and changed &mdash;it grew white, it shone, and seemed at length
to take the shrouded shape of a woman. Then the golden Snake
crept from its heart once more, and, like a living diadem, twined
itself about the cloudy brows.</p>

<p>Now suddenly a Voice called aloud the awful Word, then the
vapours burst and melted, and with my eyes I saw that Glory, at
the very thought of which my spirit faints. But what I saw it is
not lawful to utter. For, though I have been bidden to write what
I have written of this matter, perchance that a record may
remain, thereon I have been warned&mdash;ay, even now, after
these many years. I saw, and what I saw cannot be imagined; for
there are Glories and there are Shapes which are beyond the reach
of man's imagination. I saw&mdash;then, with the echo of that
Word, and the memory of that sight stamped for ever on my heart,
my spirit failed me, and I sank down before the Glory.</p>

<p>And, as I fell, it seemed that the great hall burst open and
crumbled into flakes of fire round me. Then a great wind blew:
there was a sound as the sound of Worlds rushing down the flood
of Time&mdash;and I knew no more!</p>

<p class="first">AGAIN I woke&mdash;to find myself stretched
at length upon the stone flooring of the Holy Place of Isis that
is at Abouthis. By me stood the old Priest of the Mysteries, and
in his hand was a lamp. He bent over me, and gazed earnestly upon
my face.</p>

<p>"It is day&mdash;the day of thy new birth, and thou hast lived
to see it, Harmachis!" he said at length. "I give thanks. Arise,
royal Harmachis &mdash;nay, tell me naught of that which has
befallen thee. Arise, beloved of the Holy Mother. Come forth,
thou who hast passed the fire and learned what lies behind the
darkness&mdash;come forth, O newly-born!"</p>

<p>I rose and, walking faintly, went with him, and, passing out
of the darkness of the Shrines filled with thought and wonder,
came once more into the pure light of the morning. And then I
went to my own chamber and slept; nor did any dreams come to
trouble me. But no man&mdash;not even my father&mdash; asked me
aught of what I saw upon that dread night, or after what fashion
I had communed with the Goddess.</p>

<p>After these things which have been written, I applied myself
for a space to the worship of the Mother Isis, and to the further
study of the outward forms of those mysteries to which I now held
the key. Moreover, I was instructed in matters politic, for many
great men of our following came secretly to see me from all
quarters of Egypt, and told me much of the hatred of the people
towards Cleopatra, the Queen, and of other things. At last the
hour drew nigh; it was three months and ten days from the night
when, for a while, I left the flesh, and yet living with our
life, was gathered to the breast of Isis, on which it was agreed
that with due and customary rites, although in utter secrecy, I
should be called to the throne of the Upper and the Lower Land.
So it came about that, as the solemn time drew nigh, great men of
the party of Egypt gathered to the number of thirty-seven from
every nome, and each great city of their nome, meeting together
at Abouthis. They came in every guise&mdash;some as priests, some
as pilgrims to the Shrine, and some as beggars. Among them was my
uncle, Sepa, who, though he clad himself as a travelling doctor,
had much ado to keep his loud voice from betraying him. Indeed, I
myself knew him by it, meeting him as I walked in thought upon
the banks of the canal, although it was then dusk and the great
cape, which, after the fashion of such doctors, he had thrown
about his head, half hid his face.</p>

<p>"A pest on thee!" he cried, when I greeted him by his name.
"Cannot a man cease to be himself for a single hour? Didst thou
but know the pains that it has cost me to learn to play this
part&mdash;and now thou readest who I am even in the dark!"</p>

<p>And then, still talking in his loud voice, he told me how he
had travelled hither on foot, the better to escape the spies who
ply to and fro upon the river. But he said he should return by
the water, or take another guise; for since he had come as a
doctor he had been forced to play a doctor's part, knowing but
little of the arts of medicine; and, as he greatly feared, there
were many between Annu and Abouthis who had suffered from it (12). And he laughed loudly and embraced
me, forgetting his part. For he was too whole at heart to be an
actor and other than himself, and would have entered Abouthis
with me holding my hand, had I not chid him for his folly.</p>

<p class="footnote">12. In Ancient Egypt an unskilful or negligent physician was liable to very heavy penalties. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>At length all were gathered.</p>

<p>It was night, and the gates of the temple were shut. None were
left within them, except the thirty-seven; my father, the High
Priest Amenemhat; that aged priest who had led me to the Shrine
of Isis; the old wife, Atoua, who, according to ancient custom,
was to prepare me for the anointing; and some five other priests,
sworn to secrecy by that oath which none may break. They gathered
in the second hall of the great temple; but I remained alone,
clad in my white robe, in the passage where are the names of six-
and-seventy ancient Kings, who were before the day of the divine
Sethi. There I rested in darkness, till at length my father,
Amenemhat, came, bearing a lamp, and, bowing low before me, led
me by the hand forth into the great hall. Here and there, between
its mighty pillars, lights were burning that dimly showed the
sculptured images upon the walls, and dimly fell upon the long
line of the seven-and-thirty Lords, Priests, and Princes, who,
seated upon carven chairs, awaited my coming in silence. Before
them, facing away from the seven Sanctuaries, a throne was set,
around which stood the priests holding the sacred images and
banners. As I came into the dim and holy place, the Dignitaries
rose, and bowed before me, speaking no word; while my father led
me to the steps of the throne, and in a low voice bade me stand
before it.</p>

<p>Then he spoke:</p>

<p>"Lords, Priests, and Princes of the ancient orders of the land
of Khem &mdash;Nobles from the Upper and the Lower Country, have
gathered in answer to my summons, hear me: I present to you, with
such scant formality as the occasion can afford, the Prince
Harmachis, by right and true descent of blood the descendant and
heir of the ancient Pharaohs of our most unhappy land. He is
priest of the inmost circle of the Mysteries of the Divine Isis,
Master of the Mysteries&mdash;Hereditary Priest of the Pyramids,
which are by Memphis, Instructed in the Solemn Rites of the Holy
Osiris. Is there any among you who has aught to urge against the
true line of his blood?"</p>

<p>He paused, and my uncle Sepa, rising from his chair, spoke:
"We have made examination of the records and there is none, O
Amenemhat. He is of the Royal blood, his descent is true."</p>

<p>"Is there any among you," went on my father, "who can deny
that this royal Harmachis, by sanction of the very Gods, has been
gathered to Isis, been shown the way of the Osiris, been admitted
to be the Hereditary High Priest of the Pyramids which are by
Memphis, and of the Temples of the Pyramids?"</p>

<p>Then that old priest rose who had been my guide in the
Sanctuary of the Mother and made answer: "There is none; O
Amenemhat; I know these things of my own knowledge."</p>

<p>Once more my father spoke: "Is there any among you who has
aught to urge against this royal Harmachis, in that by wickedness
of heart or life, by uncleanliness or falsity, it is not fit or
meet that we should crown him Lord of all the Lands?"</p>

<p>Then an aged Prince of Memphis arose and made answer:</p>

<p>"We have inquired of these matters: there is none, O
Amenemhat."</p>

<p>"It is well," said my father; "then naught is wanting in the
Prince Harmachis, seed of Nekt-nebf, the Osirian. Let the woman
Atoua stand forth and tell this company those things that came to
pass when, at the hour of her death, she who was my wife
prophesied over this Prince, being filled with the Spirit of the
Hathors."</p>

<p>Thereon old Atoua crept forward from the shadow of the
columns, and earnestly told those things that have been
written.</p>

<p>"Ye have heard," said my father: "do you believe that the
woman who was my wife spake with the Divine voice?"</p>

<p>"We do," they answered.</p>

<p>Now my uncle Sepa rose and spoke:</p>

<p>"Royal Harmachis, thou hast heard. Know now that we are
gathered here to crown thee King of the Upper and the Lower
Lands&mdash;thy holy father, Amenemhat, renouncing all his right
on thy behalf. We are met, not, indeed, in that pomp and ceremony
which is due to the occasion&mdash;for what we do must be done in
secret, lest our lives, and the cause that is more dear to us
than life, should pay the forfeit&mdash;but yet with such dignity
and observance of the ancient rites as our circumstance may
command. Learn, now, how this matter hangs, and if, after
learning, thy mind consents thereto, then mount thy throne, O
Pharaoh&mdash;and swear the oath!</p>

<p>"Long has Khemi groaned beneath the mailed heel of the Greek,
and trembled at the shadow of the Roman's spear; long has the
ancient worship of its Gods been desecrated, and its people
crushed with oppression. But we believe that the hour of
deliverance is at hand, and with the solemn voice of Egypt and by
the ancient Gods of Egypt, to whose cause thou art of all men
bound, we call upon thee, Prince, to be the sword of our
deliverance. Hearken! Twenty thousand good and leal men are sworn
to wait upon thy word, and at thy signal to rise as one, to put
the Grecian to the sword, and with their blood and substance to
build thee a throne set more surely on the soil of Khem than are
its ancient pyramids&mdash;such a throne as shall even roll the
Roman legions back. And for the signal, it shall be the death of
that bold harlot, Cleopatra. Thou must compass her death,
Harmachis, in such fashion as shall be shown to thee, and with
her blood anoint the Royal throne of Egypt.</p>

<p>"Canst thou refuse, O our Hope? Doth not the holy love of
country swell within thy heart? Canst thou dash the cup of
Freedom from thy lips and bear to drink the bitter draught of
slaves? The emprise is great; maybe it shall fail, and thou with
thy life, as we with ours, shalt pay the price of our endeavour.
But what of it, Harmachis? Is life, then, so sweet? Are we so
softly cushioned on the stony bed of earth? Is bitterness and
sorrow in its sum so small and scant a thing? Do we here breathe
so divine an air that we should fear to face the passage of our
breath? What have we here but hope and memory? What see we here
but shadows? Shall we then fear to pass pure-handed where
Fulfilment is and memory is lost in its own source, and shadows
die in the light which cast them? O Harmachis, that man alone is
truly blest who crowns his life with Fame's most splendid wreath.
For, since to all the Brood of Earth Death hands his poppy-
flowers, he indeed is happy to whom there is occasion given to
weave them in a crown of glory. And how can a man die better than
in a great endeavour to strike the gyves from his Country's limbs
so that she again may stand in the face of Heaven and raise the
shrill shout of Freedom, and, clad once more in a panoply of
strength, trample under foot the fetters of her servitude,
defying the tyrant nations of the earth to set their seal upon
her brow?</p>

<p>"Khem calls thee, Harmachis. Come then, thou Deliverer; leap
like Horus from the firmament, break her chains, scatter her
foes, and rule a Pharaoh on Pharaoh's Throne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, enough!" I cried, while the long murmur of applause
swept about the columns and up the massy walls. "Enough; is there
any need to adjure me thus? Had I a hundred lives, would I not
most gladly lay them down for Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Well said, well said!" answered Sepa. "Now go forth with the
woman yonder, that she may make thy hands clean before they touch
the sacred emblems, and anoint thy brow before it is encircled of
the diadem."</p>

<p>And so I went into a chamber apart with the old wife, Atoua.
There, muttering prayers, she poured pure water over my hands
into a ewer of gold, and having dipped a fine cloth into oil
wiped my brow with it.</p>

<p>"O happy Egypt!" she said; "O happy Prince, that art come to
rule in Egypt! O Royal youth!&mdash;too Royal to be a
priest&mdash;so shall many a fair woman think; but, perchance,
for thee they will relax the priestly rule, else how shall the
race of Pharaoh be carried on? O happy I, who dandled thee and
gave my flesh and blood to save thee! O royal and beautiful
Harmachis, born for splendour, happiness, and love!"</p>

<p>"Cease, cease," I said, for her talk jarred upon me; "call me
not happy till thou knowest my end, and speak not to me of love,
for with love comes sorrow, and mine is another and a higher
way."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, so thou sayest&mdash;and joy, too, that comes with
love! Never talk lightly of love, my King, for it brought thee
here! <i>La! la!</i> but it is always the way&mdash;'The goose on
the wing laughs at crocodiles,' so goes their saying down at
Alexandria; 'but when the goose is asleep on the water, it is the
crocodiles that laugh.' Not but what women are pretty crocodiles.
Men worship the crocodiles at Anthribis&mdash;Crocodilopolis they
call it now, don't they?&mdash;but they worship women all the
world over! <i>La!</i> how my tongue runs on, and thou about to
be crowned Pharaoh! Did I not prophesy it to thee? Well, thou art
clean, Lord of the Double Crown. Go forth!"</p>

<p>So I went from the chamber with the old wife's foolish talk
ringing in my ears, though of a truth her folly had ever a grain
of wit in it.</p>

<p>As I came, the Dignitaries rose once more and bowed before me.
Then my father, without delay, drew near me, and placed in my
hands a golden image of the divine Ma, the Goddess of Truth, and
golden images of the arks of the God Amen-Ra, of the divine Mout,
and the divine Khons, and spoke solemnly:</p>

<p>"Thou swearest by the living majesty of Ma, by the majesty of
Amen-Ra, of Mout, and of Khons?"</p>

<p>"I swear," I said.</p>

<p>"Thou swearest by the holy land of Khem, by Sihor's flood, by
the Temples of the Gods and the eternal Pyramids?"</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"Remembering thy hideous doom if thou shouldst fail therein,
thou swearest that thou wilt in all things govern Egypt according
to its ancient laws, that thou wilt preserve the worship of its
Gods, that thou wilt do equal justice, that thou wilt not
oppress, that thou wilt not betray, that thou wilt make no
alliance with the Roman or the Greek, that thou wilt cast out the
foreign Idols, that thou wilt devote thy life to the liberty of
the land of Khem?"</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"It is well. Mount, then, the throne, that in the presence of
these thy subjects, I may name thee Pharaoh."</p>

<p>I mounted upon the throne, of which the footstool is a Sphinx,
and the canopy the overshadowing wings of Ma. Then Amenemhat drew
nigh once again and placed the Pshent upon my brow, and on my
head the Double Crown, and the Royal Robe about my shoulders, and
in my hands the Sceptre and the Scourge.</p>

<p>"Royal Harmachis," he cried, "by these outward signs and
tokens, I, the High Priest of the Temple of Ra-Men-Ma at
Abouthis, crown thee Pharaoh of the Upper and Lower Land. Reign
and prosper, O Hope of Khemi!"</p>

<br>


<p>"Reign and prosper, Pharaoh!" echoed the Dignitaries, bowing
down before me.</p>

<p>Then, one by one, they swore allegiance, till all had sworn.
And, having sworn, my father took me by the hand; he led me in
solemn procession into each of the seven Sanctuaries that are in
this Temple of Ra-Men-Ma, and in each I made offerings, swung
incense, and officiated as priest. Clad in the Royal robes I made
offerings in the Shrine of Horus, in the Shrine of Isis, in the
Shrine of Osiris, in the Shrine of Amen-Ra, in the Shrine of
Horemku, in the Shrine of Ptah, till at length I reached the
Shrine of the King's Chamber.</p>

<p>Here they made their offering to me, as the Divine Pharaoh,
and left me very weary&mdash;but a King.</p>

<p class="first">OW the long days of preparation had passed, and
the time was at hand. I was initiated, and I was crowned; so that
although the common folk knew me not, or knew me only as Priest
of Isis, there were in Egypt thousands who at heart bowed down to
me as Pharaoh. The hour was at hand, and my soul went forth to
meet it. For I longed to overthrow the foreigner, to set Egypt
free, to mount the throne that was my heritage, and cleanse the
temples of my Gods. I was fain for the struggle, and I never
doubted of its end. I looked into the mirror, and saw triumph
written on my brows. The future stretched a path of glory from my
feet&mdash;ay, glittering with glory like Sihor in the sun. I
communed with my Mother Isis; I sat within my chamber and took
counsel with my heart; I planned new temples; I revolved great
laws that I would put forth for my people's weal; and in my ears
rang the shouts of exultation which should greet victorious
Pharaoh on his throne.</p>

<p>But still I tarried a little while at Abouthis, and, having
been commanded to do so, let my hair, that had been shorn, grow
again long and black as the raven's wing, instructing myself
meanwhile in all manly exercises and feats of arms. Also, for a
purpose which shall be seen, I perfected myself in the magic art
of the Egyptians, and in the reading of the stars, in which
things, indeed, I already have great skill.</p>

<p>Now, this was the plan that had been built up. My uncle Sepa
had, for a while, left the Temple of Annu, giving out that his
health had failed him. Thence he had moved down to a house in
Alexandria, to gather strength, as he said, from the breath of
the sea, and also to learn for himself the wonders of the great
Museum and the glory of Cleopatra's Court. There it was planned
that I should join him, for there, at Alexandria, the egg of the
plot was hatching. Accordingly, when at last the summons came,
all things being prepared, I made ready for the journey, and
passed into my father's chamber to receive his blessing before I
went. There sat the old man, as once before he sat when he had
rebuked me because I went out to slay the lion, his long white
beard resting on the table of stone and sacred writings in his
hand. When I came in he rose from his seat and would have knelt
before me, crying "Hail, Pharaoh!" but I caught him by the
hand.</p>

<p>"It is not meet, my father," I said.</p>

<p>"It is meet," he answered, "it is meet that I should bow
before my King; but be it as thou wilt. And so thou goest,
Harmachis; my blessings go with thee, O my son! And may Those
whom I serve grant to me that my old eyes may, indeed, behold
thee on the throne! I have searched long, striving, Harmachis, to
read the future that shall be; but I can learn naught by all my
wisdom. It is hid from me, and at times my heart fails. But hear
this, there is danger in thy path, and it comes in the form of
Woman. I have known it long, and therefore thou hast been called
to the worship of the heavenly Isis, who bids her votaries put
away the thought of woman till such time as she shall think well
to slacken the rule. Oh, my son, I would that thou wert not so
strong and fair&mdash;stronger and fairer, indeed, than any man
in Egypt, as a King should be&mdash;for in that strength and
beauty may lie a cause of stumbling. Beware, then, of those
witches of Alexandria, lest, like a worm, some one of them creep
into my heart and eat its secret out."</p>

<p>"Have no fear, my father," I answered, frowning, "my thought
is set on other things than red lips and smiling eyes."</p>

<p>"It is good," he answered; "so may it befall. And now
farewell. When next we meet, may it be in that happy hour when,
with all the priests of the Upper Land, I move down from Abouthis
to do my homage to Pharaoh on his throne."</p>

<p>So I embraced him, and went. Alas! I little thought how we
should meet again.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that once more I passed down the Nile
travelling as a man of no estate. And to such as were curious
about me it was given out that I was the adopted son of the High
Priest of Abouthis, having been brought up to the priesthood, and
that I had at the last refused the service of the Gods, and
chosen to go to Alexandria, to seek my fortune. For, be it
remembered, I was still held to be the grandson of the old wife,
Atoua, by all those who did not know the truth.</p>

<p>On the tenth night, sailing with the wind, we reached the
mighty city of Alexandria, the city of a thousand lights. Above
them all towered the white Pharos, that wonder of the world, from
the crown of which a light like the light of the sun blazed out
across the waters of the harbour to guide mariners on their way
across the sea. The vessel having been cautiously made fast to
the quay, for it was night, I disembarked and stood wondering at
the vast mass of houses, and confused by the clamour of many
tongues. For here all peoples seemed to be gathered together,
each speaking after the fashion of his own land. And as I stood a
young man came and touched me on the shoulder, asking me if I was
from Abouthis and named Harmachis. I said "Yea." Then, bending
over me, he whispered the secret pass-word into my ear, and,
beckoning to two slaves, bade them bring my baggage from the
ship. This they did, fighting their way through the crowd of
porters who were clamouring for hire. Then I followed him down
the quay, which was bordered with drinking-places, where all
sorts of men were gathered, tippling wine and watching the
dancing of women, some of whom were but scantily arrayed, and
some not arrayed at all.</p>

<p>And so we went through the lamp-lit houses till at last we
reached the shore of the great harbour, and turned to the right
along a wide way paved with granite and bordered by strong
houses, having cloisters in front of them, the like of which I
had never seen. Turning once more to the right we came to a
quieter portion of the city, where, except for parties of
strolling revellers, the streets were still. Presently my guide
halted at a house built of white stone. We passed in, and,
crossing a small courtyard, entered a chamber where there was a
light. And here, at last, I found my uncle Sepa, most glad to see
me safe.</p>

<p>When I had washed and eaten, he told me that all things went
well, and that as yet there was no thought of evil at the Court.
Further, he said, it having come to the ears of the Queen that
the Priest of Annu was sojourning at Alexandria, she sent for him
and closely questioned him&mdash;not as to any plot, for of that
she never thought, but as to the rumour which had reached her,
that there was treasure hid in the Great Pyramid which is by
Annu. For, being ever wasteful, she was ever in want of money,
and had bethought her of opening the Pyramid. But he laughed at
her, telling her the Pyramid was the burying-place of the divine
Khufu, and that he knew nothing of its secrets. Then she was
angered, and swore that so surely as she ruled in Egypt she would
tear it down, stone by stone, and discover the secret at its
heart. Again he laughed, and, in the words of the proverb which
they have at Alexandria, told her that "Mountains live longer
than Kings." Thereon she smiled at his ready answer, and let him
go. Also my uncle Sepa told me that on the morrow I should see
this Cleopatra. For it was her birthday (as, indeed, it was also
mine), and, dressed in the robes of the Holy Isis, she would pass
in state from her palace on the Lochias to the Serapeum to offer
a sacrifice at the Shrine of the false God who sits in the
Temple. And he said that thereafter the fashion by which I should
gain entrance to the household of the Queen should be
contrived.</p>

<p>Then, being very weary, I went to rest, but could sleep little
for the strangeness of the place, the noises in the streets, and
the thought of the morrow. While it was yet dark, I rose, climbed
the stair to the roof of the house, and waited. Presently, the
sun's rays shot out like arrows, and lit upon the white wonder of
the marble Pharos, whose light instantly sank and died, as
though, indeed, the sun had killed it. Now the rays fell upon the
palaces of the Lochias where Cleopatra lay, and lit them up till
they flamed like a jewel set on the dark, cool bosom of the sea.
Away the light flew, kissing the Soma's sacred dome, beneath
which Alexander sleeps, touching the high tops of a thousand
palaces and temples; past the porticoes of the great museum that
loomed near at hand, striking the lofty Shrine, where, carved of
ivory, is the image of the false God Serapis, and at last seeming
to lose itself in the vast and gloomy Necropolis. Then, as the
dawn gathered into day, the flood of brightness, overbrimming the
bowl of night, flowed into the lower lands and streets, and
showed Alexandria red in the sunrise as the mantle of a king, and
shaped as a mantle. The Etesian wind came up from the north, and
swept away the vapour from the harbours, so that I saw their blue
waters rocking a thousand ships. I saw, too, that mighty mole the
Heptastadium; I saw the hundreds of streets, the countless
houses, the innumerable wealth and splendour of Alexandria set
like a queen between lake Mareotis and the ocean, and dominating
both, and I was filled with wonder. This, then, was one city in
my heritage of lands and cities! Well, it was worth the grasping.
And having looked my full and fed my heart, as it were, with the
sight of splendour, I communed with the Holy Isis and came down
from the roof.</p>

<p>In the chamber beneath was my uncle Sepa. I told him that I
had been watching the sun rise over the city of Alexandria.</p>

<p>"So!" he said, looking at me from beneath his shaggy eyebrows;
"and what thinkest thou of Alexandria?"</p>

<p>"I think it is like some city of the Gods," I answered.</p>

<p>"Ay!" he replied fiercely, "a city of the infernal
Gods&mdash;a sink of corruption, a bubbling well of iniquity, a
home of false faith springing from false hearts. I would that not
one stone of it was left upon another stone, and that its wealth
lay deep beneath yonder waters! I would that the gulls were
screaming across its site, and that the wind, untainted by a
Grecian breath, swept through its ruins from the ocean to
Mareotis! O royal Harmachis, let not the luxury and beauty of
Alexandria poison thy sense; for in their deadly air, Faith
perishes, and Religion cannot spread her heavenly wings. When the
hour comes for thee to rule, Harmachis, cast down this accursed
city and, as thy fathers did, set up thy throne in the white
walls of Memphis. For I tell thee that, for Egypt, Alexandria is
but a splendid gate of ruin, and, while it endures, all nations
of the earth shall march through it, to the plunder of the land,
and all false Faiths shall nestle in it and breed the overthrow
of Egypt's Gods."</p>

<p>I made no answer, for there was truth in his words. And yet to
me the city seemed very fair to look on. After we had eaten, my
uncle told me it was now time to set out to view the march of
Cleopatra, as she went in triumph to the Shrine of Serapis. For
although she would not pass till within two hours of the midday,
yet these people of Alexandria have so great a love of shows and
idling that had we not presently set forth, by no means could we
have come through the press of the multitudes who were already
gathering along the highways where the Queen must ride. So we
went out to take our places upon a stand, built of timber, that
had been set up at the side of the great road which pierces
through the city, to the Canopic Gate. For my uncle had already
purchased a right to enter there, and that dearly.</p>

<p>We won our way with much struggle through the great crowds
that were already gathered in the streets till we reached the
scaffolding of timber, which was roofed in with an awning and
gaily hung with scarlet cloths. Here we seated ourselves upon a
bench and waited for some hours, watching the multitude press
past shouting, singing, and talking loudly in many tongues. At
length soldiers came to clear the road, clad, after the Roman
fashion, in breast- plates of chain-armour. After them marched
heralds enjoining silence (at which the population sung and
shouted all the more loudly), and crying that Cleopatra, the
Queen, was coming. Then followed a thousand Cilician skirmishers,
a thousand Thracians, a thousand Macedonians, and a thousand
Gauls, each armed after the fashion of their country. Then passed
five hundred men of those who are called the Fenced Horsemen, for
both men and horses were altogether covered with mail. Next came
youths and maidens sumptuously draped and wearing golden crowns,
and with them images symbolising Day and Night, Morning and Noon,
the Heavens and the Earth. After these walked many fair women,
pouring perfumes on the road, and others scattering blooming
flowers. Now there rose a great shout of "Cleopatra! Cleopatra!"
and I held my breath and bent forward to see her who dared to put
on the robes of Isis.</p>

<p>But at that moment the multitude so gathered and thickened in
front of where I was that I could no longer clearly see. So in my
eagerness I leapt over the barrier of the scaffolding, and, being
very strong, pushed my way through the crowd till I reached the
foremost rank. And as I did so, Nubian slaves armed with thick
staves and crowned with ivy-leaves ran up, striking the people.
One man I noted more especially, for he was a giant, and, being
strong, was insolent beyond measure, smiting the people without
cause, as, indeed, is the wont of low persons set in authority.
For a woman stood near to me, an Egyptian by her face, bearing a
child in her arms, whom the man, seeing that she was weak, struck
on the head with his rod so that she fell prone, and the people
murmured. But at the sight my blood rushed of a sudden through my
veins and drowned my reason. I held in my hand a staff of olive-
wood from Cyprus, and as the black brute laughed at the sight of
the stricken woman and her babe rolling on the ground, I swung
the staff aloft and smote. So shrewdly did I strike, that the
tough rod split upon the giant's shoulders and the blood spurted
forth, staining his trailing leaves of ivy.</p>

<p>Then, with a shriek of pain and fury&mdash;for those who smite
love not that they be smitten&mdash;he turned and sprang at me!
And all the people round gave back, save only the woman who could
not rise, leaving us two in a ring as it were. On he came with a
rush, and, as he came, being now mad, I smote him with my
clenched fist between the eyes, having nothing else with which to
smite, and he staggered like an ox beneath the first blow of the
priest's axe. Then the people shouted, for they love to see a
fight, and the man was known to them as a gladiator victorious in
the games. Gathering up his strength, the knave came on with an
oath, and, whirling his heavy staff on high, struck me in such a
fashion that, had I not avoided the blow by nimbleness, I had
surely been slain. But, as it chanced, the staff hit upon the
ground, and so heavily that it flew in fragments. Thereon the
multitude shouted again, and the great man, blind with fury,
rushed at me to smite me down. But with a cry I sprang straight
at his throat&mdash;for he was so heavy a man that I knew I could
not hope to throw him by strength&mdash;ay, and gripped it. There
I clung, though his fists battered me like bludgeons, driving my
thumbs into his throat. Round and round we turned, till at length
he flung himself to the earth, trusting thus to shake me off. But
I held on fast as we rolled over and over on the ground, till at
last he grew faint for want of breath. Then I, being uppermost,
drove my knee down upon his chest, and, as I believe, should thus
have slain him in my rage had not my uncle, and others there
gathered, fallen upon me and dragged me from him.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, though I know it not, the chariot in which the
Queen sat, with elephants going before and lions led after it,
had reached the spot, and had been halted because of the tumult.
I looked up, and thus torn, panting, my white garments stained
with the blood that had rushed from the mouth and nostrils of the
mighty Nubian, I for the first time saw Cleopatra face to face.</p>

<p class="caption">"And thus... I for the first time saw Cleopatra face to face."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Her chariot was all of gold, and drawn by milk-white steeds.
She sat in it with two fair girls, clad in Greek attire, standing
one on either side, fanning her with glittering fans. On her head
was the covering of Isis, the golden horns between which rested
the moon's round disk and the emblem of Osiris' throne, with the
uraeus twined around. Beneath this covering was the vulture cap
of gold, the blue enamelled wings and the vulture head with gemmy
eyes, under which her long dark tresses flowed towards her feet.
About her rounded neck was a broad collar of gold studded with
emeralds and coral. Round her arms and wrists were bracelets of
gold studded with emeralds and coral, and in one hand she held
the holy cross of Life fashioned of crystal, and in the other the
golden rod of royalty. Her breast was bare, but under it was a
garment that glistened like the scaly covering of a snake,
everywhere sewn with gems. Beneath this robe was a skirt of
golden cloth, half hidden by a scarf of the broidered silk of
Cos, falling in folds to the sandals that, fastened with great
pearls, adorned her white and tiny feet.</p>

<p>All this I discerned at a glance, as it were. Then I looked
upon the face &mdash;that face which seduced Caesar, ruined
Egypt, and was doomed to give Octavian the sceptre of the world.
I looked upon the flawless Grecian features, the rounded chin,
the full, rich lips, the chiselled nostrils, and the ears
fashioned like delicate shells. I saw the forehead, low, broad,
and lovely, the crisped, dark hair falling in heavy waves that
sparkled in the sun, the arched eyebrows, and the long, bent
lashes. There before me was the grandeur of her Imperial shape.
There burnt the wonderful eyes, hued like the Cyprian violet
&mdash;eyes that seemed to sleep and brood on secret things as
night broods upon the desert, and yet as the night to shift,
change, and be illumined by gleams of sudden splendour born
within their starry depths. All those wonders I saw, though I
have small skill in telling them. But even then I knew that it
was not in these charms alone that the might of Cleopatra's
beauty lay. It was rather in a glory and a radiance cast through
the fleshly covering from the fierce soul within. For she was a
Thing of Flame like unto which no woman has ever been or ever
will be. Even when she brooded, the fire of her quick heart shone
through her. But when she woke, and the lightning leapt suddenly
from her eyes, and the passion-laden music of her speech chimed
upon her lips, ah! then, who can tell how Cleopatra seemed? For
in her met all the splendours that have been given to woman for
her glory, and all the genius which man has won from heaven. And
with them dwelt every evil of that greater sort, which fearing
nothing, and making a mock of laws, has taken empires for its
place of play, and, smiling, watered the growth of its desires
with the rich blood of men. In her breast they gathered, together
fashioning that Cleopatra whom no man may draw, and yet whom no
man, having seen, ever can forget. They fashioned her grand as
the Spirit of Storm, lovely as Lightning, cruel as Pestilence,
yet with a heart; and what she did is known. Woe to the world
when such another comes to curse it!</p>

<p>For a moment I met Cleopatra's eyes as she idly bent herself
to find the tumult's cause. At first they were sombre and dark,
as though they saw indeed, but the brain read nothing. Then they
awoke, and their very colour seemed to change as the colour of
the sea changes when the water is shaken. First, there was anger
written in them; next an idle noting; then, when she looked upon
the huge bulk of the man whom I had overcome, and knew him for
the gladiator, something, perchance, that was not far from
wonder. At the least they softened, though, indeed, her face
changed no whit. But he who would read Cleopatra's mind had need
to watch her eyes, for her countenance varied but a little.
Turning, she said some word to her guards. They came forward and
led me to her, while all the multitude waited silently to see me
slain.</p>

<p>I stood before her, my arms folded on my breast. Overcome
though I was by the wonder of her loveliness I hated her in my
heart, this woman who dared to clothe herself in the dress of
Isis, this usurper who sat upon my throne, this wanton
squandering the wealth of Egypt in chariots and perfumes. When
she had looked me over from head to the feet, she spake in a low
full voice and in the tongue of Khemi which she alone had learned
of all the Lagidae:</p>

<p>"And who and what art thou, Egyptian&mdash;for Egyptian I see
thou art &mdash;who darest to smite my slave when I make progress
through my city?"</p>

<p>"I am Harmachis," I answered boldly. "Harmachis, the
astrologer, adopted son of the High Priest and Governor of
Abouthis, who am come hither to seek my fortune. I smote thy
slave, O Queen, because for no fault he struck down the woman
yonder. Ask of those who saw, royal Egypt."</p>

<p>"Harmachis," she said, "the name has a high sound&mdash;and
thou hast a high look;" and then, speaking to a soldier who had
seen all, she bade him tell her what had come to pass. This he
did truthfully, being friendly disposed towards me because I had
overcome the Nubian. Thereon she turned and spoke to the girl
bearing the fan who stood beside her&mdash;a woman with curling
hair and shy dark eyes, very beautiful to see. The girl answered
somewhat. Then Cleopatra bade them bring the slave to her. So
they led forward the giant, who had found his breath again, and
with him the woman whom he had smitten down.</p>

<p>"Thou dog!" she said, in the same low voice; "thou coward!
who, being strong, didst smite down this woman, and, being a
coward, wast overthrown of this young man. See, thou, I will
teach thee manners. Henceforth, when thou smitest women it shall
be with thy left arm. Ho, guards, seize this black slave and
strike off his right hand."</p>

<p>Her command given, she sank back in her golden chariot, and
again the cloud gathered in her eyes. But the guards seized the
giant, and, notwithstanding his cries and prayers for mercy,
struck off his hand with a sword upon the wood of the scaffolding
and he was carried away groaning. Then the procession moved on
again. As it went the fair woman with the fan turned her head,
caught my eye, and smiled and nodded as though she rejoiced, at
which I wondered somewhat.</p>

<p>The people cheered also and made jests, saying that I should
soon practice astrology in the palace. But, as soon as we might,
I and my uncle escaped, and made our way back to the house. All
the while he rated me for my rashness; but when we came to the
chamber of the house he embraced me and rejoiced greatly, because
I had overthrown the giant with so little hurt to myself.</p>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Of The Coming Of Charmion, And<br>
Of The Wrath Of Sepa</p>
<br>

<img src="1306521h-images/Cleopatra-Capital-09.png"

title="Illustration">

<p class="first">HAT same night, while we sat at supper in the
house, there came a knock upon the door. It was opened, and a
woman passed in wrapped from head to foot in a large dark peplos
or cloak in such fashion that her face could not be clearly
seen.</p>

<p>My uncle rose, and as he did so the woman uttered the secret
word.</p>

<p>"I am come, my father," she said in a sweet clear voice,
"though of a truth it was not easy to escape the revels at the
palace yonder. But I told the Queen that the sun and the riot in
the streets had made me sick, and she let me go."</p>

<p>"It is well," he answered. "Unveil thyself; here thou art
safe."</p>

<p>With a little sigh of weariness she unclasped the peplos and
let it slip from her, giving to my sight the face and form of
that beauteous girl who had stood to fan Cleopatra in the
chariot. For she was very fair and pleasant to look upon, and her
Grecian robes clung sweetly about her supple limbs and budding
form. Her wayward hair, flowing in a hundred little curls, was
bound in with a golden fillet, and on her feet were sandals
fastened with studs of gold. Her cheeks blushed like a flower,
and her dark soft eyes were downcast, as though with modesty, but
smiles and dimples trembled about her lips.</p>

<p>My uncle frowned when his eyes fell upon her dress.</p>

<p>"Why comest thou in this garb, Charmion?" he asked sternly.
"Is not the dress of thy mothers good enough for thee? This is no
time or place for woman's vanities. Thou art not here to conquer,
but to obey."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not wroth, my father," she answered softly;
"perchance thou knowest not that she whom I serve will have none
of our Egyptian dress; it is out of fashion. To wear it would
have been to court suspicion&mdash;also I came in haste." And as
she spoke I saw that all the while she watched me covertly
through the long lashes which fringed her modest eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said sharply, fixing his keen glance upon her
face, "doubtless thou speakest truth, Charmion. Be ever mindful
of thy oath, girl, and of the cause to which thou art sworn. Be
not light-minded, and I charge thee forget the beauty with which
thou hast been cursed. For mark thou this, Charmion: fail us but
one jot, and vengeance shall fall on thee&mdash;the vengeance of
man and the vengeance of the Gods! To this service," he
continued, lashing himself to anger as he went on till his great
voice rang in the narrow room, "thou hast been bred; to this end
thou hast been instructed and placed where thou art to gain the
ear of that wicked wanton whom thou seemest to serve. See thou
forget it not; see that the luxury of yonder Court does not
corrupt thy purity and divert thy aim, Charmion," and his eyes
flashed and his small form seemed to grow till it attained to
dignity&mdash;nay, almost to grandeur.</p>

<p>"Charmion," he went on, advancing towards her with
outstretched finger, "I say that at times I do not trust thee.
But two nights gone I dreamed I saw thee standing in the desert.
I saw thee laugh and lift thy hand to heaven, and from it fell a
rain of blood; then the sky sank down on the land of Khem and
covered it. Whence came the dream, girl, and what is its meaning?
I have naught against thee as yet; but hearken! On the moment
that I have, though thou art of my kin, and I have loved
thee&mdash;on that moment, I say, I will doom those delicate
limbs, which thou lovest so much to show, to the kite and the
jackal, and the soul within thee to all the tortures of the Gods!
Unburied shalt thou lie, and bodiless and accursed shalt thou
wander in Amenti!&mdash;ay, for ever and ever!"</p>

<p>He paused, for his sudden burst of passion had spent itself.
But by it, more clearly than before, I saw how deep a heart this
man had beneath the cloak of his merriness and simplicity of
mien, and how fiercely the mind within him was set upon his aim.
As for the girl, she shrank from him terrified, and, placing her
hands before her sweet face, began to weep.</p>

<p>"Nay, speak not so, my father," she said, between her sobs;
"for what have I done? I know nothing of the evil wandering of
thy dreams. I am no soothsayer that I should read dreams. Have I
not carried out all things according to thy desire? Have I not
been ever mindful of that dread oath?" &mdash;and she trembled.
"Have I not played the spy and told thee all? Have I not won the
heart of the Queen, so that she loves me as a sister, refusing me
nothing&mdash;ay, and the hearts of those about her? Why dost
thou affright me thus with thy words and threats?" and she wept
afresh, looking even more beautiful in her sorrow than she was
before.</p>

<p>"Enough, enough," he answered; "what I have said, I have said.
Be warned, and affront our sight no more with this wanton dress.
Thinkest thou that we would feed our eyes upon those rounded
arms&mdash;we whose stake is Egypt and who are dedicated to the
Gods of Egypt? Girl, behold thy cousin and thy King!"</p>

<p>She ceased weeping, wiping her eyes with her chiton, and I saw
that they seemed but the softer for her tears.</p>

<p>"Methinks, most royal Harmachis, and beloved Cousin," she
said, as she bent before me, "that we are already made
acquainted."</p>

<p>"Yea, Cousin," I answered, not without shamefacedness, for I
had never before spoken to so fair a maid; "thou wert in the
chariot with Cleopatra this day when I struggled with the
Nubian?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," she said, with a smile and a sudden lighting of
the eyes, "it was a gallant fight and gallantly didst thou
overthrow that black brute. I saw the fray and, though I knew
thee not, I greatly feared for one so brave. But I paid him for
my fright, for it was I who put it into the mind of Cleopatra to
bid the guards strike off his hand&mdash;now, knowing who thou
art, I would I had said his head." And she looked up shooting a
glance at me and then smiled.</p>

<p>"Enough," put in my uncle Sepa, "the time draws on. Tell thou
thy mission, Charmion, and be gone."</p>

<p>Then her manner changed; she folded her hands meekly before
her and spoke:</p>

<p>"Let Pharaoh hearken to his handmaiden. I am the daughter of
Pharaoh's uncle, the brother of his father, who is now long dead,
and therefore in my veins also flows the Royal blood of Egypt.
Also I am of the ancient Faith, and hate these Greeks, and to see
thee set upon the throne has been my dearest hope now for many
years. To this end I, Charmion, have put aside my rank and become
serving-woman to Cleopatra, that I might cut a notch in which
thou couldst set thy foot when the hour came for thee to climb
the throne. And, Pharaoh, the notch is cut."</p>

<p>"This then is our plot, royal Cousin. Thou must gain an
entrance to the Household and learn its ways and secrets, and, so
far as may be, suborn the eunuchs and captains, some of whom I
have already tempted. This done, and all things being prepared
without, thou must slay Cleopatra, and, aided by me with those
whom I control, in the confusion that shall ensue, throw wide the
gates, and, admitting those of our party who are in waiting, put
such of the troops as remain faithful to the sword and seize the
Bruchium. Which being finished, within two days thou shalt hold
this fickle Alexandria. At the same time those who are sworn to
thee in every city of Egypt shall rise in arms, and in ten days
from the death of Cleopatra thou shalt indeed be Pharaoh. This is
the counsel which has been taken, and thou seest, royal Cousin,
that, though our uncle yonder thinks so ill of me, I have learned
my part&mdash;ay, and played it."</p>

<p>"I hear thee, Cousin," I answered, marvelling that so young a
woman &mdash;she had but twenty years&mdash;could weave so bold a
plot, for in its origin the scheme was hers. But in those days I
little knew Charmion. "Go on; how then shall I gain entrance to
the palace of Cleopatra?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Cousin, as things are it is easy. Thus: Cleopatra loves
to look upon a man, and&mdash;give me pardon&mdash;thy face and
form are fair. To- day she noted them, and twice she said she
would she had asked where that astrologer might be found, for she
held that an astrologer who could wellnigh slay a Nubian
gladiator with his bare hands, must indeed be a master of the
fortunate stars. I answered her that I would cause inquiry to be
made. So hearken, royal Harmachis. At midday Cleopatra sleeps in
her inner hall which looks over the gardens to the harbour. At
that hour to-morrow, then, I will meet thee at the gates of the
palace, whither thou shalt come boldly asking for the Lady
Charmion. I will make appointment for thee with Cleopatra, so
that she shall see thee alone when she wakes, and the rest shall
be for thee, Harmachis. For much she loves to play with the
mysteries of magic, and I have known her stand whole nights
watching the stars and making a pretence to read them. And but
lately she has sent away Dioscorides the physician, because, poor
fool! he ventured on a prophecy from the conjunction of the
stars, that Cassius would defeat Mark Antony. Thereon Cleopatra
sent orders to the General Allienus, bidding him add the legions
she had sent to Syria to help Antony to the army of Cassius,
whose victory, forsooth, was&mdash;according to Dioscorides
&mdash;written on the stars. But, as it chanced, Antony beat
Cassius first and Brutus afterwards, and so Dioscorides has
departed, and now he lectures on herbs in the museum for his
bread, and hates the name of stars. But his place is empty, and
thou shalt fill it, and then we will work in secret and in the
shadow of the sceptre. Ay, we will work like the worm at the
heart of a fruit, till the time of plucking comes, and at thy
dagger's touch, royal Cousin, the fabric of this Grecian throne
crumbles to nothingness, and the worm that rotted it bursts his
servile covering, and, in the sight of empires, spreads his royal
wings o'er Egypt."</p>

<p class="caption">"Ay, we will work like the worm at the heart of a fruit."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I gazed at this strange girl once more astonished, and saw
that her face was lit up with such a light as I had never seen in
the eyes of woman.</p>

<p>"Ah," broke in my uncle, who was watching her, "ah, I love to
see thee so, girl; there is the Charmion that I knew and I bred
up&mdash;not the Court girl whom I like not, draped in silks of
Cos and fragrant with essences. Let thy heart harden in this
mould&mdash;ay, stamp it with the fervid zeal of patriot faith,
and thy reward shall find thee. And now cover up that shameless
dress of thine and leave us, for it grows late. To-morrow
Harmachis shall come, as thou hast said, and so farewell."</p>

<p>Charmion bowed her head, and, turning, wrapped her dark-hued
peplos round her. Then, taking my hand, she touched it with her
lips and went without any further word.</p>

<p>"A strange woman!" said Sepa, when she had gone; "a most
strange woman, and an uncertain!"</p>

<p>"Methought, my uncle," I said, "that thou wast somewhat harsh
with her."</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered, "but not without a cause. Look thou,
Harmachis; beware of this Charmion. She is too wayward, and, I
fear me, may be led away. In truth, she is a very woman; and,
like a restive horse, will take the path that pleases her. She
has brain and fire, and she loves our cause; but I pray that the
cause come not face to face with her desires, for what her heart
is set on that will she do, at any cost she will do it. Therefore
I frightened her now while I may: for who can know but that she
will pass beyond my power? I tell thee, that in this one girl's
hand lie all our lives: and if she play us false, what then?
Alas! and alas! that we must use such tools as these! But it was
needful: there was no other way; and yet I misdoubted me. I pray
that it may be well; still, at times, I fear my niece
Charmion&mdash;she is too fair, and the blood of youth runs too
warm in those blue veins of hers.</p>

<p>"Ah, woe to the cause that builds its strength upon a woman's
faith; for women are faithful only where they love, and when they
love their faithlessness becomes their faith. They are not fixed
as men are fixed: they rise more high and sink more
low&mdash;they are strong and changeful as the sea. Harmachis,
beware of this Charmion: for, like the ocean, she may float thee
home; or, like the ocean, she may wreck thee, and, with thee, the
hope of Egypt!"</p>

Of The Coming Of Harmachis To The Palace,<br>
Of How He Drew Paulus Through The Gates,<br>
Of Cleopatra Sleeping, And<br>
Of The Magic Of Harmachis Which He Showed Her</p>
<br>

<p class="first">HUS it came to pass that on the next day I
arrayed myself in a long and flowing robe, after the fashion of a
magician or astrologer. I placed a cap on my head, about which
were broidered images of the stars, and in my belt a scribe's
palette and a roll of papyrus written over with magic spells and
signs. In my hand I held a wand of ebony, tipped with ivory, such
as is used by priests and masters of magic. Among these, indeed,
I took high rank, filling my knowledge of their secrets which I
had learned at Annu what I lacked in that skill which comes from
use. And so with no small shame, for I love not such play and
hold this common magic in contempt, I set forth through the
Bruchium to the palace on the Lochias, being guided on my way by
my uncle Sepa. At length, passing up the avenue of sphinxes, we
came to the great marble gateway and the gates of bronze, within
which is the guard-house. Here my uncle left me, breathing many
prayers for my safety and success. But I advanced with an easy
air to the gate, where I was roughly challenged by the Gallic
sentries, and asked of my name, following, and business. I gave
my name, Harmachis, the astrologer, saying that my business was
with the Lady Charmion, the Queen's lady. Thereon the man made as
though to let me pass in, when a captain of the guard, a Roman
named Paulus, came forward and forbade it. Now, this Paulus was a
large limbed man, with a woman's face, and a hand that shook from
wine- bibbing. Still he knew me again.</p>

<p>"Why," he cried, in the Latin tongue, to one who came with
him, "this is the fellow who wrestled yesterday with the Nubian
gladiator, that same who now howls for his lost hand underneath
my window. Curses on the black brute! I had a bet upon him for
the games! I have backed him against Caius, and now he'll never
fight again, and I must lose my money, all through this
astrologer. What is it thou sayest?&mdash;thou hast business with
the Lady Charmion? Nay, then, that settles it. I will not let
thee through. Fellow, I worship the Lady Charmion&mdash;ay, we
all worship her, though she gives us more slaps than sighs. And
dost thou think that we will suffer an astrologer with such eyes
and such a chest as thine to cut in the game?&mdash;by Bacchus,
no! She must come out to keep the tryst, for in thou shalt not
go."</p>

<p>"Sir," I said humbly and yet with dignity, "I pray that a
message may be sent to the Lady Charmion, for my business will
not brook delay."</p>

<p>"Ye Gods!" answered the fool, "whom have we here that he
cannot wait? A Caesar in disguise? Nay, be off&mdash;be off! if
thou wouldst not learn how a spear-prick feels behind."</p>

<p>"Nay," put in the other officer, "he is an astrologer; make
him prophesy &mdash;make him play tricks."</p>

<p>"Ay," cried the others who had sauntered up, "let the fellow
show his art. If he is a magician he can pass the gates, Paulus
or no Paulus."</p>

<p>"Right willingly, good Sirs," I answered; for I saw no other
means of entering. "Wilt thou, my young and noble Lord"&mdash;and
I addressed him who was with Paulus&mdash;"suffer that I look
thee in the eyes; perhaps I may read what is written there?"</p>

<p>"Right," answered the youth; "but I wish that the Lady
Charmion was the sorceress. I would stare her out of countenance,
I warrant."</p>

<p>I took him by the hand and gazed deep into his eyes. "I see,"
I said, "a field of battle at night, and about it bodies
stretched&mdash;among them is <i>thy</i> body, and a hyena tears
its throat. Most noble Sir, thou shalt die by sword-thrusts
within a year."</p>

<p>"By Bacchus!" said the youth, turning white to the gills,
"thou art an ill-omened sorcerer!" And he slunk off&mdash;shortly
afterwards, as it chanced, to meet this very fate. For he was
sent on service and slain in Cyprus.</p>

<p>"Now for thee, great Captain!" I said, speaking to Paulus. "I
will show thee how I will pass those gates without thy
leave&mdash;ay, and draw thee through them after me. Be pleased
to fix thy princely gaze upon the point of this wand in my
hand."</p>

<p>Being urged by his comrades he did this, unwillingly; and I
let him gaze till I saw his eyes grow empty as an owl's eyes in
the sun. Then I suddenly withdrew the wand, and, shifting my
countenance into the place of it, I seized him with my will and
stare, and, beginning to turn round and round, drew him after me,
his fierce face drawn fixed, as it were, almost to my own. Then I
moved slowly backwards till I had passed the gates, still drawing
him after me, and suddenly jerked my head away. He fell to the
ground, to rise wiping his brow and looking very foolish.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-1st-12"></a>
<div align="center">

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I seized him by my will and stare, and drew him after me!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Art thou content, most noble Captain?" I said. "Thou seest we
have passed the gates. Would any other noble Sir wish that I
should show more of my skill?"</p>

<p>"By Taranis, Lord of Thunder, and all the Gods of Olympus
thrown in, no!" growled an old Centurion, a Gaul named Brennus,
"I like thee not, I say. The man who could drag our Paulus
through those gates by the eye, as it were, is not a man to play
with. Paulus, too, who always goes the way you don't want him
&mdash;backwards, like an ass&mdash;Paulus! Why, sirrah, thou
needst must have a woman in one eye and a wine-cup in the other
to draw our Paulus thus."</p>

<p>At this moment the talk was broken, for Charmion herself came
down the marble path, followed by an armed slave. She walked calm
and carelessly, her hands folded behind her, and her eyes gazing
at nothingness, as it were. But it was when Charmion thus looked
upon nothing that she saw most. And as she came the officers and
men of the guard made way for her bowing, for, as I learned
afterwards, this girl, next to Cleopatra's self, wielded more
power than anyone about the palace.</p>

<p>"What is this tumult, Brennus?" she said, speaking to the
Centurion, and making as if she saw me not; "knowest thou not
that the Queen sleeps at this hour, and if she be awakened it is
thou who must answer for it, and that dearly?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Lady," said the Centurion, humbly; "but it is thus. We
have here" &mdash;and he jerked his thumb towards me&mdash;"a
magician of the most pestilent&mdash;um, I crave his
pardon&mdash;of the very best sort, for he hath but just now,
only by placing his eyes close to the nose of the worthy Captain
Paulus, dragged him, the said Paulus, through the gates that
Paulus swore the magician should not pass. By the same token,
lady, the magician says that he has business with you&mdash;which
grieves me for your sake."</p>

<p>Charmion turned and looked at me carelessly. "Ay, I remember,"
she said; "and so he has&mdash;at least, the Queen would see his
tricks; but if he can do none better than cause a sot"&mdash;here
she cast a glance of scorn at the wondering Paulus&mdash;"to
follow his nose through the gates he guards, he had better go
whence he came. Follow me, Sir Magician; and for thee, Brennus, I
say, keep thy riotous crew more quiet. For thee, most honourable
Paulus, get thee sober, and next time I am asked for at the gates
give him who asks a hearing." And, with a queenly nod of her
small head, she turned and led the way, followed at a distance by
myself and the armed slave.</p>

<p>We passed up the marble walk which runs through the garden
grounds, and is set on either side with marble statues, for the
most part of heathen Gods and Goddesses, with which these Lagidae
were not ashamed to defile their royal dwellings. At length we
came to a beautiful portico with fluted columns of the Grecian
style of art, where we found more guards, who made way for the
Lady Charmion. Crossing the portico we reached a marble vestibule
where a fountain splashed softly, and thence by a low doorway a
second chamber, known as the Alabaster Hall, most beautiful to
see. Its roof was upheld by light columns of black marble, but
all its walls were panelled with alabaster, on which Grecian
legends were engraved. Its floor was of rich and many-hued mosaic
that told the tale of the passion of Psyche for the Grecian God
of Love, and about it were set chairs of ivory and gold. Charmion
bade the armed slave stay at the doorway of this chamber, so that
we passed in alone, for the place was empty except for two
eunuchs who stood with drawn swords before the curtain at the
further end.</p>

<p>"I am vexed, my Lord," she said, speaking very low and shyly,
"that thou shouldst have met with such affronts at the gate; but
the guard there served a double watch, and I had given my
commands to the officer of the company that should have relieved
it. Those Roman officers are ever insolent, who, though they seem
to serve, know well that Egypt is their plaything. But it is not
amiss, for these rough soldiers are superstitious, and will fear
thee. Now bide thou here while I go into Cleopatra's chamber,
where she sleeps. I have but just sung her to sleep, and if she
be awake I will call thee, for she waits thy coming." And without
more words she glided from my side.</p>

<p>In a little time she returned, and coming to me spoke:</p>

<p>"Wouldst see the fairest woman in all the world, asleep?" she
whispered; "if so, follow me. Nay, fear not; when she awakes she
will but laugh, for she bade me be sure to bring thee instantly,
whether she slept or woke. See, I have her signet."</p>

<p>So we passed up the beautiful chamber till we came to where
the eunuchs stood with drawn swords, and these would have barred
my entry. But Charmion frowned, and drawing the signet from her
bosom held it before their eyes. Having examined the writing that
was on the ring, they bowed, dropping their sword points and we
passed through the heavy curtains broidered with gold into the
resting-place of Cleopatra. It was beautiful beyond
imagining&mdash; beautiful with many coloured marbles, with gold
and ivory, gems and flowers &mdash;all art can furnish and all
luxury can dream of were here. Here were pictures so real that
birds might have pecked the painted fruits; here were statues of
woman's loveliness frozen into stone; here were draperies fine as
softest silk, but woven of a web of gold; here were couches and
carpets such as I never saw. The air, too, was sweet with
perfume, while through the open window places came the far murmur
of the sea. And at the further end of the chamber, on a couch of
gleaming silk and sheltered by a net of finest gauze, Cleopatra
lay asleep. There she lay&mdash;the fairest thing that man ever
saw&mdash;fairer than a dream, and the web of her dark hair
flowed all about her. One white, rounded arm made a pillow for
her head, and one hung down towards the ground. Her rich lips
were parted in a smile, showing the ivory lines of teeth; and her
rosy limbs were draped in so thin a robe of the silk of Cos, held
about her by a jewelled girdle, that the white gleam of flesh
shone through it. I stood astonished, and though my thoughts had
little bent that way, the sight of her beauty struck me like a
blow, so that for a moment I lost myself as it were in the vision
of its power, and was grieved at heart because I must slay so
fair a thing.</p>

<p>Turning suddenly from the sight, I found Charmion watching me
with her quick eyes&mdash;watching as though she would search my
heart. And, indeed, something of my thought must have been
written on my face in a language that she could read, for she
whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>"Ay, it is pity, is it not? Harmachis, being but a man,
methinks that thou wilt need all thy ghostly strength to nerve
thee to the deed!"</p>

<p>I frowned, but before I could frame an answer she touched me
lightly on the arm and pointed to the Queen. A change had come
upon her: her hands were clenched, and about her face, all rosy
with the hue of sleep, gathered a cloud of fear. Her breath came
quick, she raised her arms as though to ward away a blow, then
with a stifled moan sat up and opened the windows of her eyes.
They were dark, dark as night; but when the light found them they
grew blue as the sky grows blue before the blushing of the
dawn.</p>

<p>"Caesarion?" she said; "where is my son Caesarion?&mdash;Was
it then a dream? I dreamed that Julius&mdash;Julius who is
dead&mdash;came to me, a bloody toga wrapped about his face, and
having thrown his arms about his child led him away. Then I
dreamed I died&mdash;died in blood and agony; and one I might not
see mocked me as I died. <i>Ah!</i> who is that man?"</p>

<p>"Peace, Madam! peace!" said Charmion. "It is but the magician
Harmachis, whom thou didst bid me bring to thee at this
hour."</p>

<p>"Ah! the magician&mdash;that Harmachis who overthrew the
giant? I remember now. He is welcome. Tell me, Sir Magician, can
thy magic mirror call forth an answer to this dream? Nay, how
strange a thing is Sleep, that wrapping the mind in a web of
darkness, straightly compels it to its will! Whence, then, come
those images of fear rising on the horizon of the soul like some
untimely moon upon a midday sky? Who grants them power to stalk
so lifelike from Memory's halls, and, pointing to their wounds,
thus confront the Present with the Past? Are they, then,
messengers? Does the half-death of sleep give them foothold in
our brains, and thus upknit the cut thread of human kinship? That
was Caesar's self, I tell thee, who but now stood at my side and
murmured through his muffled robe warning words of which the
memory is lost to me. Read me this riddle, thou Egyptian Sphinx (13), and I'll show thee a rosier path to fortune than all thy stars can point. Thou hast brought  omen, solve thou its problem."</p>

<p class="footnote">13. Alluding to his name. Harmachis was the
Grecian title of the divinity of the Sphinx, as Horemkhu was the
Egyptian. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"I come in a good hour, most mighty Queen," I answered, "for I
have some skill in the mysteries of Sleep, that is, as thou hast
rightly guessed, a stair by which those who are gathered to
Osiris may from time to time enter at the gateways of our living
sense, and, by signs and words that can be read of instructed
mortals, repeat the echoes of that Hall of Truth which is their
habitation. Yes, Sleep is a stair by which the messengers of the
guardian Gods may descend in many shapes upon the spirit of their
choice. For, O Queen, to those who hold the key, the madness of
our dreams can show a clearer purpose and speak more certainly
than all the acted wisdom of our waking life, which is a dream
indeed. Thou didst see great Caesar in his bloody robe, and he
threw his arms about the Prince Caesarion and led him hence.
Hearken now to the secret of thy vision. It was Caesar's self
thou sawest coming to thy side from Amenti in such a guise as
might not be mistaken. When he embraced the child Caesarion he
did it for a sign that to him, and him alone, had passed his
greatness and his love. When he seemed to lead him hence he led
him forth from Egypt to be crowned in the Capitol, crowned the
Emperor of Rome and Lord of all the Lands. For the rest, I know
not. It is hid from me."</p>

<p>Thus, then, I read the vision, though to my sense it had a
darker meaning. But it is not well to prophesy evil unto
Kings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cleopatra had risen, and, having thrown back the
gnat gauze, was seated upon the edge of her couch, her eyes fixed
upon my face, while her fingers played with her girdle's jewelled
ends.</p>

<p>"Of a truth," she cried, "thou art the best of all magicians,
for thou readest my heart, and drawest a hidden sweet out of the
rough shell of evil omen!"</p>

<p>"Ay, O Queen," said Charmion, who stood by with downcast eyes,
and I thought that there was bitter meaning in her soft tones;
"may no rougher words ever affront thy ears, and no evil presage
tread less closely upon its happy sense."</p>

<p>Cleopatra placed her hands behind her head and, leaning back,
looked at me with half-shut eyes.</p>

<p>"Come, show us of thy magic, Egyptian," she said. "It is yet
hot abroad, and I am weary of those Hebrew Ambassadors and their
talk of Herod and Jerusalem. I hate that Herod, as he shall
find&mdash;and will have none of the Ambassadors to-day, though I
yearn a little to try my Hebrew on them. What canst thou do? Hast
thou no new trick? By Serapis! if thou canst conjure as well as
thou canst prophesy, thou shalt have a place at Court, with pay
and perquisites to boot, if thy lofty soul does not scorn
perquisites."</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered, "all tricks are old; but there are some
forms of magic to be rarely used, and with discretion, that may
be new to thee, O Queen! Art thou afraid to venture on the
charm?"</p>

<p>"I fear nothing; go on and do thy worst. Come, Charmion, and
sit by me. But, stay, where are all the girls?&mdash;Iras and
Merira?&mdash;they, too, love magic."</p>

<p>"Not so," I said; "the charms work ill before so many. Now
behold!" and, gazing at the twain, I cast my wand upon the marble
and murmured a spell. For a moment it was still, and then, as I
muttered, the rod slowly began to writhe. It bent itself, it
stood on end, and moved of its own motion. Next it put on scales,
and behold it was a serpent that crawled and fiercely hissed.</p>

<p>"Fie on thee!" cried Cleopatra, clapping her hands; "callest
thou that magic? Why, it is an old trick that any wayside
conjurer can do. I have seen it a score of times."</p>

<p>"Wait, O Queen," I answered, "thou hast not seen all." And, as
I spoke, the serpent seemed to break in fragments, and from each
fragment grew a new serpent. And these, too, broke in fragments
and bred others, till in a little while the place, to their
glamoured sight, was a seething sea of snakes, that crawled,
hissed, and knotted themselves in knots. Then I made a sign, and
the serpents gathered themselves round me, and seemed slowly to
twine themselves about my body and my limbs, till, save my face,
I was wreathed thick with hissing snakes.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrible! horrible!" cried Charmion, hiding her
countenance in the skirt of the Queen's garment.</p>

<p>"Nay, enough, Magician, enough!" said the Queen: "thy magic
overwhelms us."</p>

<p>I waved my snake-wrapped arms, and all was gone. There at my
feet lay the black wand tipped with ivory, and naught beside.</p>

<p>The two women looked upon each other and gasped with wonder.
But I took up the wand and stood with folded arms before
them.</p>

<p>"Is the Queen content with my poor art?" I asked most
humbly.</p>

<p>"Ay, that I am, Egyptian; never did I see its like! Thou art
Court astronomer from this day forward, with right of access to
the Queen's presence. Hast thou more of such magic at thy
call?"</p>

<p>"Yea, royal Egypt; suffer that the chamber be a little
darkened, and I will show thee one more thing."</p>

<p>"Half am I afraid," she answered; "nevertheless do thou as
this Harmachis says, Charmion."</p>

<p>So the curtains were drawn and the chamber made as though the
twilight were at hand. I came forward, and stood beside
Cleopatra. "Gaze thou there!" I said sternly, pointing with my
wand to the empty space where I had been, "and thou shalt behold
that which is in thy mind."</p>

<p>Then for a little space was silence, while the two women gazed
fixedly and half fearful at the spot.</p>

<p>And as they gazed a cloud gathered before them. Very slowly it
took shape and form, and the form it took was the form of a man,
though as yet he was but vaguely mapped upon the twilight, and
seemed now to grow and now to melt away.</p>

<p>Then I cried with a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Spirit, I conjure thee, <i>appear!</i>"</p>

<p>And as I cried the Thing, perfect in every part, leapt into
form before us, suddenly as the flash of day. His shape was the
shape of royal Caesar, the toga thrown about his face, and on his
form a vestment bloody from a hundred wounds. An instant so he
stood, then I waved my wand and he was gone.</p>

<p>I turned to the two women on the couch, and saw Cleopatra's
lovely face all clothed in terror. Her lips were ashy white, her
eyes stared wide, and all the flesh was shaking on her bones.</p>

<p>"Man!" she gasped; "man! who and what art thou who canst bring
the dead before our eyes?"</p>

<p>"I am the Queen's astronomer, magician, servant&mdash;what the
Queen wills," I answered, laughing. "Was this the form that was
on the Queen's mind?"</p>

<p>She made no answer, but, rising, left the chamber by another
door.</p>

<p>Then Charmion rose also and took her hands from her face, for
she, too, had been stricken with dread.</p>

<p>"How dost thou these things, royal Harmachis?" she said. "Tell
me; for of a truth I fear thee."</p>

<p>"Be not afraid," I answered. "Perchance thou didst see nothing
but what was in my mind. All things are shadows. How canst thou,
then, know their nature, or what is and what only seems to be?
But how goes it? Remember, Charmion, this sport is played to an
end."</p>

<p>"It goes well," she said. "By to-morrow morning's dawn these
tales will have gone round, and thou wilt be more feared than any
man in Alexandria. Follow me, I pray thee."</p>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Of The Ways Of Charmion, And<br>
Of The Crowning Of Harmachis As The King Of Love</p>
<br>

<img src="1306521h-images/Cleopatra-Capital-11.png"

title="Illustration">

<p class="first">THE following day I received the writing of
my appointment as Astrologer and Magician-in-Chief to the Queen,
with the pay and perquisites of that office, which were not
small. Rooms were given me in the palace, also, through which I
passed at night to the high watch-tower, whence I looked on the
stars and drew their auguries. For at this time Cleopatra was
much troubled about matters political, and not knowing how the
great struggle among the Roman factions would end, but being very
desirous to side with the strongest, she took constant counsel
with me as to the warnings of the stars. These I read to her in
such manner as best seemed to fit the high interest of my ends.
For Antony, the Roman Triumvir, was now in Asia Minor, and,
rumour ran, very wroth because it had been told him that
Cleopatra was hostile to the Triumvirate, in that her General,
Serapion, had aided Cassius. But Cleopatra protested loudly to me
and others that Serapion had acted against her will. Yet Charmion
told me that, as with Allienus, it was because of a prophecy of
Dioscorides the unlucky that the Queen herself had secretly
ordered Serapion so to do. Still, this did not save Serapion, for
to prove to Antony that she was innocent she dragged the General
from the sanctuary and slew him. Woe be to those who carry out
the will of tyrants if the scale should rise against them! And so
Serapion perished.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all things went well with us, for the minds of
Cleopatra and those about her were so set upon affairs abroad
that neither she nor they thought of revolt at home. But day by
day our party gathered strength in the cities of Egypt, and even
in Alexandria, which is to Egypt as another land, all things
being foreign there. Day by day, those who doubted were won over
and sworn to the cause by that oath which cannot be broken, and
our plans of action more firmly laid. And every other day I went
forth from the palace to take counsel with my uncle Sepa, and
there at his house met the Nobles and the great priests who were
for the party of Khem.</p>

<p>I saw much of Cleopatra, the Queen, and I was ever more
astonished at the wealth and splendour of her mind, that for
richness and variety was as a woven cloth of gold throwing back
all lights from its changing face. She feared me somewhat, and
therefore wished to make a friend of me, asking me of many
matters that seemed to be beyond the province of my office. I saw
much of the Lady Charmion also&mdash;indeed, she was ever at my
side, so that I scarce knew when she came and when she went. For
she would draw nigh with that soft step of hers, and I would turn
to find her at hand and watching me beneath the long lashes of
her downcast eyes. There was no service that was too hard for
her, and no task too long; for day and night she laboured for me
and for our cause.</p>

<p>But when I thanked her for her loyalty, and said it should be
had in mind in that time which was at hand, she stamped her foot,
and pouted with her lips, like an angry child, saying that, among
all the things which I had learned, this had I not
learned&mdash;that Love's service asked no payment, and was its
own guerdon. And I, being innocent in such matters, and, foolish
that I was, holding the ways of women as of small account, read
her sayings in the sense that her services to the cause of Khem,
which she loved, brought with them their own reward. But when I
praised so fine a spirit, she burst into angry tears and left me
wondering. For I knew nothing of the trouble at her heart. I knew
not then that, unsought, this woman had given me her love, and
that she was rent and torn by pangs of passion fixed like arrows
in her breast. I did not know&mdash;how should I know it, who
never looked upon her otherwise than as an instrument of our
joint and holy cause? Her beauty never stirred me&mdash;no, not
even when she leaned over me and breathed upon my hair, I never
thought of it otherwise than as a man thinks of the beauty of a
statue. What had I to do with such delights, I who was sworn to
Isis and dedicate to the cause of Egypt? O ye Gods, bear me
witness that I am innocent of this thing which was the source of
all my woe and the woe of Khem!</p>

<p>How strange a thing is this love of woman, that is so small in
its beginning and in its ends so great! See, at the first it is
as the little spring of water welling from a mountain's heart.
And at the last what is it? It is a mighty river that floats
argosies of joy and makes wide lands to smile. Or, perchance, it
is a torrent to wash in a flood of ruin across the fields of
Hope, bursting in the barriers of design, and bringing to tumbled
nothingness the tenement of man's purity and the temples of his
faith. For when the Invisible conceived the order of the universe
He set this seed of woman's love within its plan, that by its
most unequal growth is doomed to bring about equality of law. For
now it lifts the low to heights untold, and now it brings the
noble to the level of the dust. And thus, while Woman, that great
surprise of nature, is, Good and Evil can never grow apart. For
still She stands, and, blind with love, shoots the shuttle of our
fate, and pours sweet water into the cup of bitterness, and
poisons the wholesome breath of life with the doom of her desire.
Turn this way and turn that, She is at hand to meet thee. Her
weakness is thy strength, her might is thy undoing. Of her thou
art, to her thou goest. She is thy slave, yet holds thee captive;
at her touch honour withers, locks open, and barriers fall. She
is infinite as ocean, she is variable as heaven, and her name is
the Unforeseen. Man, strive not to escape from Woman and the love
of woman; for, fly where thou wilt, She is yet thy fate, and
whate'er thou buildest thou buildest it for her!</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that I, Harmachis, who had put such
matters far from me, was yet doomed to fall by the thing I held
of no account. For, see, this Charmion: she loved me&mdash;why, I
know not. Of her own thought she learned to love me, and of her
love came what shall be told. But I, knowing naught, treated her
like a sister, walking as it were hand in hand with her towards
our common end.</p>

<p>And so the time passed on, till, at length, all things were
made ready.</p>

<p>It was the night before the night when the blow should fall,
and there were revellings in the palace. That very day I had seen
Sepa, and with him the captains of a band of five hundred men,
who should burst into the palace at midnight on the morrow, when
I had slain Cleopatra the Queen, and put the Roman and the Gallic
legionaries to the sword. That very day I had suborned the
Captain Paulus who, since I drew him through the gates, was my
will's slave. Half by fear and half by promises of great reward I
had prevailed upon him, for the watch was his, to unbar that
small gate which faces to the East at the signal on the morrow
night.</p>

<p>All was made ready&mdash;the flower of Freedom that had been
five-and-twenty years in growth was on the point of bloom. Armed
companies were gathering in every city from Abu to Athu, and
spies looked out from their walls, awaiting the coming of the
messenger who should bring tidings that Cleopatra was no more and
that Harmachis, the royal Egyptian, had seized the throne.</p>

<p>All was prepared, triumph hung in my hand as a ripe fruit to
the hand of the plucker. Yet as I sat at the royal feast my heart
was heavy, and a shadow of coming woe lay cold within my mind. I
sat there in a place of honour, near the majesty of Cleopatra,
and looked down the lines of guests, bright with gems and
garlanded with flowers, marking those whom I had doomed to die.
There before me lay Cleopatra in all her beauty, which thrilled
the beholder as he is thrilled by the rushing of the midnight
gale, or by the sight of stormy waters. I gazed on her as she
touched her lips with wine and toyed with the chaplet of roses on
her brow, thinking of the dagger beneath my robe that I had sworn
to bury in her breast. Again, and yet again, I gazed and strove
to hate her, strove to rejoice that she must die&mdash;and could
not. There, too, behind her&mdash;watching me now, as ever, with
her deep-fringed eyes&mdash;was the lovely Lady Charmion. Who, to
look at her innocent face, would believe that she was the setter
of that snare in which the Queen who loved her should miserably
perish? Who would dream that the secret of so much death was
locked in her girlish breast? I gazed, and grew sick at heart
because I must anoint my throne with blood, and by evil sweep
away the evil of the land. At that hour I wished, indeed, that I
was nothing but some humble husbandman, who in its season grows
and in its season garners the golden grain! Alas! the seed that I
had been doomed to sow was the seed of Death, and now I must reap
the red fruit of the harvest!</p>

<p>"Why, Harmachis, what ails thee?" said Cleopatra, smiling her
slow smile. "Has the golden skein of stars got tangled, my
astronomer? or dost thou plan some new feat of magic? Say what is
it that thou dost so poorly grace our feast? Nay, now, did I not
know, having made inquiry, that things so low as we poor women
are far beneath thy gaze, why, I should swear that Eros had found
thee out, Harmachis!"</p>

<p>"Nay, that I am spared, O Queen," I answered. "The servant of
the stars marks not the smaller light of woman's eyes, and
therein is he happy!"</p>

<p>Cleopatra leaned herself towards me, looking on me long and
steadily in such fashion that, despite my will, the blood
fluttered at my heart.</p>

<p>"Boast not, thou proud Egyptian," she said in a low voice
which none but I and Charmion could hear, "lest perchance thou
dost tempt me to match my magic against thine. What woman can
forgive that a man should push us by as things of no account? It
is an insult to our sex which Nature's self abhors," and she
leaned back again and laughed most musically. But, glancing up, I
saw Charmion, her teeth on her lip and an angry frown upon her
brow.</p>

<p>"Pardon, royal Egypt," I answered coldly, but with such wit as
I could summon, "before the Queen of Heaven even stars grow
pale!" This I said of the moon, which is the sign of the Holy
Mother whom Cleopatra dared to rival, naming herself Isis come to
earth.</p>

<p>"Happily said," she answered, clapping her white hands. "Why,
here's an astronomer who has wit and can shape a compliment! Nay,
such a wonder must not pass unnoted, lest the Gods resent it.
Charmion, take this rose-chaplet from my hair and set it upon the
learned brow of our Harmachis. He shall be crowned <i>King of
Love</i>, whether he will it or not."</p>

<p>Charmion lifted the chaplet from Cleopatra's brows and,
bearing it to where I was, with a smile set it upon my head yet
warm and fragrant from the Queen's hair, but so roughly that she
pained me somewhat. She did this because she was wroth, although
she smiled with her lips and whispered, "An omen, royal
Harmachis." For though she was so very much a woman, yet, when
she was angered or suffered jealousy, Charmion had a childish
way.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-1st-13"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="1306521h-images/Cleopatra-12.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"An omen, royal Harmachis."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Having thus fixed the chaplet, she curtsied low before me, and
with the softest tone of mockery named me, in the Greek tongue,
"Harmachis, King of Love." Then Cleopatra laughed and pledged me
as "King of Love," and so did all the company, finding the jest a
merry one. For in Alexandria they love not those who live
straitly and turn aside from women.</p>

<p>But I sat there, a smile upon my lips, and black wrath in my
heart. For, knowing who and what I was, it irked me to think
myself a jest for the frivolous nobles and light beauties of
Cleopatra's Court. But I was chiefly angered against Charmion,
because she laughed the loudest, and I did not then know that
laughter and bitterness are often the veils with which a sore
heart wraps its weakness from the world. "An omen" she said it
was&mdash;that crown of flowers&mdash;and so it proved indeed.
For I was fated to barter the Double Diadem of the Upper and the
Lower Land for a wreath of passion's roses that fade before they
fully bloom, and Pharaoh's ivory bed of state for the pillow of a
faithless woman's breast.</p>

<p>"<i>King of Love!</i>" they crowned me in their mockery; ay,
and King of Shame! And I, with the perfumed roses on my
brow&mdash;I, by descent and ordination the Pharaoh of
Egypt&mdash;thought of the imperishable halls of Abouthis and of
that other crowning which on the morrow should be consummate.</p>

<p>But still smiling, I pledged them back, and answered with a
jest. For rising, I bowed before Cleopatra and craved leave to
go. "Venus," I said, speaking of the planet that we know as
Donaou in the morning and Bonou in the evening, "was in the
ascendant. Therefore, as new-crowned King of Love, I must now
pass to do my homage to its Queen." For these barbarians name
Venus Queen of Love.</p>

<p>And so amidst their laughter I withdraw to my watch-tower,
and, dashing that shameful chaplet down amidst the instruments of
my craft, made pretence to note the rolling of the stars. There I
waited, thinking on many things that were to be, until Charmion
should come with the last lists of the doomed and the messages of
my uncle Sepa, whom she had seen that evening.</p>

<p>At length the door opened softly, and she came jewelled and
clad in her white robes, as she had left the feast.</p>

<p class="first">LENGTH thou art come, Charmion," I said. "It
is over-late."</p>

<p>"Yea, my Lord; but by no means could I escape Cleopatra. Her
mood is strangely crossed to-night. I know not what it may
portend. Strange whims and fancies blow across it like light and
contrary airs upon a summer sea, and I cannot read her
purpose."</p>

<p>"Well, well; enough of Cleopatra. Hast thou seen our
uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, royal Harmachis."</p>

<p>"And hast thou the last lists?"</p>

<p>"Yes; here they are," and she drew them from her bosom. "Here
is the list of those who, after the Queen, must certainly be put
to the sword. Among them thou wilt note is the name of that old
Gaul Brennus. I grieve for him, for we are friends; but it must
be. It is a heavy list."</p>

<p>"It is so," I answered conning it; "when men write out their
count they forget no item, and our count is long. What must be
must be. Now for the next."</p>

<p>"Here is the list of those to be spared, as friendly or
uncertain; and here that of the towns which will certainly rise
as soon as the messenger reaches their gates with tidings of the
death of Cleopatra."</p>

<p>"Good. And now"&mdash;and I paused&mdash;"and now as to the
manner of Cleopatra's death. How hast thou settled it? Must it be
by my own hand?"</p>

<p>"Yea, my Lord," she answered, and again I caught that note of
bitterness in her voice. "Doubtless Pharaoh will rejoice that his
should be the hand to rid the land of this false Queen and wanton
woman, and at one blow break the chains which gall the neck of
Egypt."</p>

<p>"Talk not thus, girl," I said; "thou knowest well that I do
not rejoice, being but driven to the act by deep necessity and
the pressure of my vows. Can she not, then, be poisoned? Or can
no one of the eunuchs be suborned to slay her? My soul turns from
this bloody work! Indeed, I marvel, however heavy be her crimes,
that thou canst speak so lightly of the death by treachery of one
who loves thee!"</p>

<p>"Surely Pharaoh is over-tender, forgetting the greatness of
the moment and all that hangs upon this dagger-stroke that shall
cut the thread of Cleopatra's life. Listen, Harmachis.
<i>Thou</i> must do the deed, and <i>thou</i> alone! Myself I
would do it, had my arm the strength; but it has not. It cannot
be done by poison, for every drop she drinks and every morsel
that shall touch her lips is strictly tasted by three separate
tasters, who cannot be suborned. Nor may the eunuchs of the guard
be trusted. Two, indeed, are sworn to us; but the third cannot be
come at. He must be cut down afterwards; and, indeed, when so
many men must fall, what matters a eunuch more or less? Thus it
shall be, then. To-morrow night, at three hours before midnight
thou dost cast the final augury of the issue of the war. And then
thou wilt, as is agreed, descend alone with me, having the
signet, to the outer chamber of the Queen's apartment. For the
vessel bearing orders to the Legions sails from Alexandria at the
following dawn; and alone with Cleopatra, since she wills that
the thing be kept secret as the sea, thou wilt read the message
of the stars. And as she pores over the papyrus, then must thou
stab her in the back, so that she dies; and see thou that thy
will and arm fail thee not! The deed being done&mdash;and indeed
it will be easy&mdash;thou wilt take the signet and pass out to
where the eunuch is&mdash;for the others will be wanting. If by
any chance there is trouble with him&mdash;but there will be no
trouble, for he dare not enter the private rooms, and the sounds
of death cannot reach so far&mdash;thou must cut him down. Then I
will meet thee; and, passing on, we will come to Paulus, and it
shall be my care to see that he is neither drunk nor backward,
for I know how to hold him to the task. And he and those with him
shall throw open the side gate, when Sepa and the five hundred
chosen men who are in waiting shall pour in and cast themselves
upon the sleeping legionaries, putting them to the sword. Why,
the thing is easy so thou rest true to thyself, and let no
womanish fears creep into thy heart. What is this dagger's
thrust? It is nothing, and yet upon it hang the destinies of
Egypt and the world."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said. "What is that?&mdash;I hear a sound."</p>

<p>Charmion ran to the door, and, gazing down the long, dark
passage, listened. In a moment she came back, her finger on her
lips. "It is the Queen," she whispered hurriedly; "the Queen who
mounts the stair alone. I heard her bid Iras to leave her. I may
not be found alone with thee at this hour; it has a strange look,
and she may suspect. What wants she here? Where can I hide?"</p>

<p>I glanced round. At the further end of the chamber was a heavy
curtain that hid a little place built in the thickness of the
wall which I used for the storage of rolls and instruments.</p>

<p>"Haste thee&mdash;there!" I said, and she glided behind the
curtain, which swung back and covered her. Then I thrust the
fatal scroll of death into the bosom of my robe and bent over the
mystic chart. Presently I heard the sweep of woman's robes and
there came a low knock upon the door.</p>

<p>"Enter, whoever thou art," I said.</p>

<p>The latch lifted, and Cleopatra swept in, royally arrayed, her
dark hair hanging about her and the sacred snake of royalty
glistening on her brow.</p>

<p>"Of a truth, Harmachis," she said with a sigh, as she sank
into a seat, "the path to heaven is hard to climb! Ah! I am
weary, for those stairs are many. But I was minded, my
astronomer, to see thee in thy haunts."</p>

<p>"I am honoured overmuch, O Queen!" I said bowing low before
her.</p>

<p>"Art thou now? And yet that dark face of thine has a somewhat
angry look &mdash;thou art too young and handsome for this dry
trade, Harmachis. Why, I vow thou hast cast my wreath of roses
down amidst thy rusty tools! Kings would have cherished that
wreath along with their choicest diadems, Harmachis! and thou
dost throw it away as a thing of no account! Why, what a man art
thou! But stay; what is this? A lady's kerchief, by Isis! Nay,
now, my Harmachis, how came <i>this</i> here? Are our poor
kerchiefs also instruments of thy high art? Oh, fie,
fie!&mdash;have I caught thee, then? Art thou indeed a fox?"</p>

<p>"Nay, most royal Cleopatra, nay!" I said, turning; for the
kerchief which had fallen from Charmion's neck had an awkward
look. "I know not, indeed, how the frippery came here. Perhaps,
some one of the women who keeps the chamber may have let it
fall."</p>

<p>"Ah! so&mdash;so!" she said dryly, and still laughing like a
rippling brook. "Yes, surely, the slave-women who keep chambers
own such toys as this, of the very finest silk, worth twice its
weight in gold, and broidered, too, in many colours. Why, myself
I should not shame to wear it! Of a truth it seems familiar to my
sight." And she threw it round her neck and smoothed the ends
with her white hand. "But there; doubtless, it is a thing unholy
in thine eyes that the scarf of thy beloved should rest upon my
poor breast. Take it, Harmachis; take it, and hide it in thy
bosom&mdash;nigh thy heart indeed!"</p>

<p>I took the accursed thing, and, muttering what I may not
write, stepped on to the giddy platform whence I watched the
stars. Then, crushing it into a ball, I threw it to the winds of
heaven.</p>

<p>At this the lovely Queen laughed once more.</p>

<p>"Nay, think now," she cried; "what would the lady say could
she see her love-gauge thus cast to all the world? Mayhap,
Harmachis, thou wouldst deal thus with my wreath also? See, the
roses fade; cast it forth," and, stooping, she took up the wreath
and gave it to me.</p>

<p>For a moment, so vexed was I, I had a mind to take her at her
word and send the wreath to join the kerchief. But I thought
better of it.</p>

<p>"Nay," I said more softly, "it is a Queen's gift, and I will
keep it," and, as I spoke, I saw the curtain shake. Often since
that night I have sorrowed over those simple words.</p>

<p>"Gracious thanks be to the King of Love for this small mercy,"
she answered, looking at me strangely. "Now, enough of wit; come
forth upon this balcony&mdash;tell me of the mystery of those
stars of thine. For I always loved the stars, that are so pure
and bright and cold, and so far away from our fevered troubling.
There I would wish to dwell, rocked on the dark bosom of the
night, and losing the little sense of self as I gazed for ever on
the countenance of yon sweet-eyed space. Nay&mdash;who can tell,
Harmachis? &mdash;perhaps those stars partake of our very
substance, and, linked to us by Nature's invisible chain, do,
indeed, draw our destiny with them as they roll. What says the
Greek fable of him who became a star? Perchance it has truth, for
yonder tiny sparks may be the souls of men, but grown more purely
bright and placed in happy rest to illume the turmoil of their
mother-earth. Or are they lamps hung high in the heavenly vault
that night by night some Godhead, whose wings are Darkness,
touches with his immortal fire so that they leap out in answering
flame? Give me of thy wisdom and open these wonders to me, my
servant, for I have little knowledge. Yet my heart is large, and
I would fill it, for I have the wit, could I but find the
teacher."</p>

<p>Thereon, being glad to find footing on a safer shore, and
marvelling somewhat to learn that Cleopatra had a place for lofty
thoughts, I spoke and willingly told her such things as are
lawful. I told her how the sky is a liquid mass pressing round
the earth and resting on the elastic pillars of the air, and how
above is the heavenly ocean Nout, in which the planets float like
ships as they rush upon their radiant way. I told her many
things, and amongst them how, through the certain never-ceasing
movement of the orbs of light, the planet Venus, that was called
Donaou when she showed as the Morning Star, became the planet
Bonou when she came as the sweet Star of Eve. And while I stood
and spoke watching the stars, she sat, her hands clasped upon her
knee, and watched my face.</p>

<p class="caption">"And while I spoke watching the stars, she sat and watched my face."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Ah!" she broke in at length, "and so Venus is to be seen both
in the morning and the evening sky. Well, of a truth, she is
everywhere, though she best loves the night. But thou lovest not
that I should use these Latin names to thee. Come, we will talk
in the ancient tongue of Khem, which I know well; I am the first,
mark thou, of all the Lagidae who know it. And now," she went on,
speaking in my own tongue, but with a little foreign accent that
did but make her talk more sweet, "enough of stars, for, when all
is said, they are but fickle things, and perhaps may even now be
storing up an evil hour for thee or me, or for both of us
together. Not but what I love to hear thee speak of them, for
then thy face loses that gloomy cloud of thought which mars it
and grows quick and human. Harmachis, thou art too young for such
a solemn trade; methinks that I must find thee a better. Youth
comes but once; why waste it in these musings? It is time to
think when we can no longer act. Tell me how old art thou,
Harmachis?"</p>

<p>"I have six-and-twenty years, O Queen," I answered, "for I was
born in the first month of Shomou, in the summer season, and on
the third day of the month."</p>

<p>"Why, then, we are of an age even to a day," she cried, "for I
too have six-and-twenty years, and I too was born on the third
day of the first month of Shomou. Well, this may we say: those
who begot us need have no shame. For if I be the fairest woman in
Egypt, methinks, Harmachis, that there is in Egypt no man more
fair and strong than thou, ay, or more learned. Born of the same
day, why, 'tis manifest that we were destined to stand together,
I, as the Queen, and thou, perchance, Harmachis, as one of the
chief pillars of my throne, and thus to work each other's
weal."</p>

<p>"Or maybe each other's woe," I answered, looking up; for her
sweet speeches stung my ears and brought more colour to my face
than I loved that she should see there.</p>

<p>"Nay, never talk of woe. Be seated here by me, Harmachis, and
let us talk, not as Queen and subject, but as friend to friend.
Thou wast angered with me at the feast to-night because I mocked
thee with yonder wreath&mdash;was it not so? Nay, it was but a
jest. Didst thou know how heavy is the task of monarchs and how
wearisome are their hours, thou wouldst not be wroth because I
lit my dulness with a jest. Oh, they weary me, those princes and
those nobles, and those stiff-necked pompous Romans. To my face
they vow themselves my slaves, and behind my back they mock me
and proclaim me the servant of their Triumvirate, or their
Empire, or their Republic, as the wheel of Fortune turns, and
each rises on its round! There is never a man among
them&mdash;nothing but fools, parasites, and puppets&mdash;never
a man since with their coward daggers they slew that Caesar whom
all the world in arms was not strong enough to tame. And I must
play off one against the other, if maybe, by so doing, I can keep
Egypt from their grip. And for reward, what? Why, this is my
reward &mdash;that all men speak ill of me&mdash;and, I know it,
my subjects hate me! Yes, I believe that, woman though I am, they
would murder me could they find a means!"</p>

<p>She paused, covering her eyes with her hand, and it was well,
for her words pierced me so that I shrank upon the seat beside
her.</p>

<p>"They think ill of me, I know it; and call me wanton, who have
never stepped aside save once, when I loved the greatest man of
all the world, and at the touch of love my passion flamed indeed,
but burnt a hallowed flame. These ribald Alexandrians swear that
I poisoned Ptolemy, my brother&mdash;whom the Roman Senate would,
most unnaturally, have forced on me, his sister, as a husband!
But it is false: he sickened and died of fever. And even so they
say that I would slay Arsinoë, my sister&mdash;who, indeed, would
slay me! &mdash;but that, too, is false! Though she will have
none of me, I love my sister. Yes, they all think ill of me
without a cause; even thou dost think ill of me, Harmachis.</p>

<p>"O Harmachis, before thou judgest, remember what a thing is
envy! &mdash;that foul sickness of the mind which makes the
jaundiced eye of pettiness to see all things distraught&mdash;to
read Evil written on the open face of Good, and find impurity in
the whitest virgin's soul! Think what a thing it is, Harmachis,
to be set on high above the gaping crowd of knaves who hate thee
for thy fortune and thy wit; who gnash their teeth and shoot the
arrows of their lies from the cover of their own obscureness,
whence they have no wings to soar; and whose hearts' quest it is
to drag down thy nobility to the level of the groundling and the
fool!</p>

<p>"Be not, then, swift to think evil of the Great, whose every
word and act is searched for error by a million angry eyes, and
whose most tiny fault is trumpeted by a thousand throats, till
the world shakes with echoes of their sin! Say not: 'It is thus,
'tis certainly thus'&mdash;say, rather: 'May it not be otherwise?
Have we heard aright? Did she this thing of her own will?' Judge
gently, Harmachis, as wert thou I thou wouldst be judged.
Remember that a Queen is never free. She is, indeed, but the
point and instrument of those forces politic with which the iron
books of history are graved. O Harmachis! be thou my
friend&mdash;my friend and counsellor!&mdash;my friend whom I can
trust indeed!&mdash;for here, in this crowded Court, I am more
utterly alone than any soul that breathes about its corridors.
But <i>thee</i> I trust; there is faith written in those quiet
eyes, and I am minded to lift thee high, Harmachis. I can no
longer bear my solitude of mind&mdash;I must find one with whom I
may commune and speak that which lies within my heart. I have
faults, I know it; but I am not all unworthy of thy faith, for
there is good grain among the evil seed. Say, Harmachis, wilt
thou take pity on my loneliness and befriend me, who have lovers,
courtiers, slaves, dependents, more thick than I can count, but
never one single <i>friend</i>?" and she leant towards me,
touching me lightly, and gazed on me with her wonderful blue
eyes.</p>

<p>I was overcome; thinking of the morrow night, shame and sorrow
smote me. <i>I</i>, her friend!&mdash;<i>I</i>, whose assassin
dagger lay against my breast! I bent my head, and a sob or a
groan, I know not which, burst from the agony of my heart.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra, thinking only that I was moved beyond myself by
the surprise of her graciousness, smiled sweetly, and said:</p>

<p>"It grows late; to-morrow night when thou bringest the
auguries we will speak again, O my friend Harmachis, and thou
shalt answer me." And she gave me her hand to kiss. Scarce
knowing what I did, I kissed it, and in another moment she was
gone.</p>

<p>But I stood in the chamber, gazing after her like one
asleep.</p>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Of The Words And Jealousy Of Charmion,<br>
Of The Laughter Of Harmachis,<br>

<br>

<p class="first">STOOD still, plunged in thought. Then by
hazard as it were I took up the wreath of roses and looked on it.
How long I stood so I know not, but when next I lifted up my eyes
they fell upon the form of Charmion, whom, indeed, I had
altogether forgotten. And though at the moment I thought but
little of it, I noted vaguely that she was flushed as though with
anger, and beat her foot upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is thou, Charmion!" I said. "What ails thee? Art thou
cramped with standing so long in thy hiding-place? Why didst not
thou slip hence when Cleopatra led me to the balcony?"</p>

<p>"Where is my kerchief?" she asked, shooting an angry glance at
me. "I let fall my broidered kerchief."</p>

<p>"Thy kerchief!&mdash;why, didst thou not see? Cleopatra
twitted me about it, and I flung it from the balcony."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw," answered the girl, "I saw but too well. Thou
didst fling away my kerchief, but the wreath of roses&mdash;that
thou wouldst not fling away. It was 'a Queen's gift,' forsooth,
and therefore the royal Harmachis, the Priest of Isis, the chosen
of the Gods, the crowned Pharaoh wed to the weal of Khem,
cherished it and saved it. But my kerchief, stung by the laughter
of that light Queen, he cast away!"</p>

<p>"What meanest thou?" I asked, astonished at her bitter tone.
"I cannot read thy riddles."</p>

<p>"What mean I?" she answered, tossing up her head and showing
the white curves of her throat. "Nay, I mean naught, or all; take
it as thou wilt. Wouldst know what I mean, Harmachis, my cousin
and my Lord?" she went on in a hard, low voice. "Then I will tell
thee&mdash;thou art in danger of the great offence. This
Cleopatra has cast her fatal wiles about thee, and thou goest
near to loving her, Harmachis&mdash;to loving her whom to-morrow
thou must slay! Ay, stand and stare at that wreath in thy
hand&mdash;the wreath thou couldst not send to join my
kerchief&mdash;sure Cleopatra wore it but to-night! The perfume
of the hair of Caesar's mistress&mdash;Caesar's and
others'&mdash;yet mingles with the odour of its roses! Now,
prithee, Harmachis, how far didst thou carry the matter on yonder
balcony? for in that hole where I lay hid I could not hear or
see. 'Tis a sweet spot for lovers, is it not?&mdash;ay, and a
sweet hour, too? Venus surely rules the stars to-night?"</p>

<p>All of this she said so quietly and in so soft and modest a
way, though her words were not modest, and yet so bitterly, that
every syllable cut me to the heart, and angered me till I could
find no speech.</p>

<p>"Of a truth thou hast a wise economy," she went on, seeing her
advantage: "to-night thou dost kiss the lips that to-morrow thou
shalt still for ever! It is frugal dealing with the occasion of
the moment; ay, worthy and honourable dealing!"</p>

<p>Then at last I broke forth. "Girl," I cried, "how darest thou
speak thus to me? Mindest thou who and what I am that thou
loosest thy peevish gibes upon me?"</p>

<p>"I mind what it behoves thee to be," she answered quick. "What
thou art, that I mind not now. Surely thou knowest
alone&mdash;thou and Cleopatra!"</p>

<p>"What meanest thou?" I said. "Am I to blame if the
Queen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Queen! What have we here? Pharaoh owns a Queen!"</p>

<p>"If Cleopatra wills to come hither of a night and
talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of stars, Harmachis&mdash;surely of stars and roses, and
naught beside!"</p>

<p>After that I know not what I said; for, troubled as I was, the
girl's bitter tongue and quiet way drove me wellnigh to madness.
But this I know: I spoke so fiercely that she cowered before me
as she had cowered before my uncle Sepa when he rated her because
of her Grecian garb. And as she wept then, so she wept now, only
more passionately and with great sobs.</p>

<p>At length I ceased, half-shamed but still angry and smarting
sorely. For even while she wept she could find a tongue to answer
with&mdash;and a woman's shafts are sharp.</p>

<p>"Thou shouldst not speak to me thus!" she sobbed; "it is
cruel&mdash; it is unmanly! But I forget thou art but a priest,
not a man&mdash;except, mayhap, for Cleopatra!"</p>

<p>"What right hast thou?" I said. "What canst thou mean?"</p>

<p>"What right have I?" she asked, looking up, her dark eyes all
aflood with tears that ran down her sweet face like the dew of
morning down a lily's heart. "What right have I? O Harmachis! art
thou blind? Didst thou not know by what right I speak thus to
thee? Then I must tell thee. Well, it is the fashion in
Alexandria! By that first and holy right of woman&mdash;by the
right of the great love I bear thee, and which, it seems, thou
hast no eyes to see&mdash; by the right of my glory and my shame.
Oh, be not wroth with me, Harmachis, nor set me down as light,
because the truth at last has burst from me; for I am not so. I
am what thou wilt make me. I am the wax within the moulder's
hands, and as thou dost fashion me so I shall be. There breathes
within me now a breath of glory, blowing across the waters of my
soul, that can waft me to ends more noble than ever I have
dreamed afore, if thou wilt be my pilot and my guide. But if I
lose thee, then I lose all that holds me from my worse
self&mdash; and let shipwreck come! Thou knowest me not,
Harmachis! thou canst not see how big a spirit struggles in this
frail form of mine! To thee I am a girl, clever, wayward,
shallow. But I am more! Show me thy loftiest thought and I will
match it, the deepest puzzle of thy mind and I will make it
clear. Of one blood we are, and love can ravel up our little
difference and make us grow one indeed. One end we have, one land
we love, one vow binds us both. Take me to thy heart, Harmachis,
set me by thee on the Double Throne, and I swear that I will lift
thee higher than ever man has climbed. Reject me, and beware lest
I pull thee down! And now, putting aside the cold delicacy of
custom, stung to it by what I saw of the arts of that lovely
living falsehood, Cleopatra, which for pastime she practises on
thy folly, I have spoken out my heart, and answer thou!" And she
clasped her hands and, drawing one pace nearer, gazed, all white
and trembling, on my face.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood struck dumb, for the magic of her voice
and the power of her speech, despite myself, stirred me like the
rush of music. Had I loved the woman, doubtless she might have
fired me with her flame; but I loved her not, and I could not
play at passion. And so thought came, and with thought that
laughing mood, which is ever apt to fashion upon nerves strained
to the point of breaking. In a flash, as it were, I bethought me
of the way in which she had that very night forced the wreath of
roses on my head, I thought of the kerchief and how I had flung
it forth. I thought of Charmion in the little chamber watching
what she held to be the arts of Cleopatra, and of her bitter
speeches. Lastly, I thought of what my uncle Sepa would say of
her could he see her now, and of the strange and tangled skein in
which I was inmeshed. And I laughed aloud&mdash;the fool's
laughter that was my knell of ruin!</p>

<p>She turned whiter yet&mdash;white as the dead&mdash;and a look
grew upon her face that checked my foolish mirth. "Thou findest,
then, Harmachis," she said in a low, choked voice, and dropping
the level of her eyes, "thou findest cause of merriment in what I
have said?"</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered; "nay, Charmion; forgive me if I laughed. It
was rather a laugh of despair; for what am I to say to thee? Thou
hast spoken high words of all thou mightest be: is it left for me
to tell thee what thou art?"</p>

<p>She shrank, and I paused.</p>

<p>"Speak," she said.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest&mdash;none so well!&mdash;who I am and what my
mission is: thou knowest&mdash;none so well!&mdash;that I am
sworn to Isis, and may, by law Divine, have naught to do with
thee."</p>

<p>"Ay," she broke in, in her low voice, and with her eyes still
fixed upon the ground&mdash;"ay, and I know that thy vows are
broken in spirit, if not in form&mdash;broken like wreaths of
cloud; for, Harmachis&mdash;<i>thou lovest Cleopatra!</i>"</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" I cried. "Thou wanton girl, who wouldst seduce
me from my duty and put me to an open shame!&mdash;who, led by
passion or ambition, or the love of evil, hast not shamed to
break the barriers of thy sex and speak as thou hast
spoken&mdash;beware lest thou go too far! And if thou wilt have
an answer, here it is, put straightly, as thy question. Charmion,
outside the matter of my duty and my vows, thou art
<i>naught</i>to me!&mdash;nor for all thy tender glances will my
heart beat one pulse more fast! Hardly art thou now my
friend&mdash;for, of a truth, I scarce can trust thee. But, once
more: beware! To me thou mayest do thy worst; but if thou dost
dare to lift a finger against our cause, that day thou diest! And
now, is this play done?"</p>

<p>And as, wild with anger, I spoke thus, she shrank back, and
yet further back, till at length she rested against the wall, her
eyes covered with her hand. But when I ceased she dropped her
hand, glancing up, and her face was as the face of a statue, in
which the great eyes glowed like embers, and round them was a
ring of purple shadow.</p>

<p>"Not altogether done," she answered gently; "the arena must
yet be sanded!" This she said having reference to the covering up
of the bloodstains at the gladiatorial shows with fine sand.
"Well," she went on, "waste not thine anger on a thing so vile. I
have thrown my throw and I have lost. <i>Vae
victis!</i>&mdash;ah! <i>Vae victis!</i> Wilt thou not lend me
the dagger in thy robe, that here and now I may end my shame? No?
Then one word more, most royal Harmachis: if thou canst, forget
my folly; but, at the least, have no fear from me. I am now, as
ever, thy servant and the servant of our cause. Farewell!"</p>

<br>

"If thou canst,  forget my folly... I am now, as ever,<br>
thy servant and the servant of our cause. Farewell!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And she went, leaning her hand against the wall. But I,
passing to my chamber, flung myself upon my couch, and groaned in
bitterness of spirit. Alas! we shape our plans, and by slow
degrees build up our house of Hope, never counting on the guests
that time shall bring to lodge therein. For who can guard
against&mdash;the Unforeseen?</p>

<p>At length I slept, and my dreams were evil. When I woke the
light of the day which should see the red fulfilment of the plot
was streaming through the casement, and the birds sang merrily
among the garden palms. I woke, and as I woke the sense of
trouble pressed in upon me, for I remembered that before this day
was gathered to the past I must dip my hands in blood&mdash;yes,
in the blood of Cleopatra, who trusted me! Why could I not hate
her as I should? There had been a time when I looked on to this
act of vengeance with somewhat of a righteous glow of zeal. And
now&mdash;and now&mdash;why, I would frankly give my royal
birthright to be free from its necessity! But, alas! I knew that
there was no escape. I must drain this cup or be for ever cast
away. I felt the eyes of Egypt watching me, and the eyes of
Egypt's Gods. I prayed to my Mother Isis to give me strength to
do this deed, and prayed as I had never prayed before; and oh,
wonder! no answer came. Nay, how was this? What, then, had loosed
the link between us that, for the first time, the Goddess deigned
no reply to her son and chosen servant? Could it be that I had
sinned in heart against her? What had Charmion said&mdash;that I
loved Cleopatra? Was this sickness love? Nay! a thousand times
nay!&mdash;it was but the revolt of Nature against an act of
treachery and blood. The Goddess did but try my strength, or
perchance she also turned her holy countenance from murder?</p>

<p>I rose filled with terror and despair, and went about my task
like a man without a soul. I conned the fatal lists and noted all
the plans&mdash;ay, in my brain I gathered up the very words of
that proclamation of my Royalty which, on the morrow, I should
issue to the startled world.</p>

<p>"Citizens of Alexandria and dwellers in the land of Egypt," it
began, "Cleopatra the Macedonian hath, by the command of the
Gods, suffered justice for her crimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>All these and other things I did, but I did them as a man
without a soul &mdash;as a man moved by a force from without and
not from within. And so the minutes wore away. In the third hour
of the afternoon I went as by appointment fixed to the house
where my uncle Sepa lodged, that same house to which I had been
brought some three months gone when I entered Alexandria for the
first time. And here I found the leaders of the revolt in the
city assembled in secret conclave to the number of seven. When I
had entered, and the doors were barred, they prostrated
themselves, and cried, "Hail, Pharaoh!" but I bade them rise,
saying that I was not yet Pharaoh, for the chicken was still in
the egg.</p>

<p>"Yea, Prince," said my uncle, "but his beak shows through. Not
in vain hath Egypt brooded all these years, if thou fail not with
that dagger-stroke of thine to-night; and how canst thou fail?
Nothing can now stop our course to victory!"</p>

<p>"It is on the knees of the Gods," I answered.</p>

<p>"Nay," he said, "the Gods have placed the issue in the hands
of a mortal &mdash;in thy hands, Harmachis!&mdash;and there it is
safe. See: here are the last lists. Thirty-one thousand men who
bear arms are sworn to rise when the tidings come to them. Within
five days every citadel in Egypt will be in our hands, and then
what have we to fear? From Rome but little, for her hands are
full; and, besides, we will make alliance with the Triumvirate,
and, if need be, buy them off. For of money there is plenty in
the land, and if more be wanted thou, Harmachis, knowest where it
is stored against the need of Khem, and outside the Roman's reach
of arm. Who is there to harm us? There is none. Perchance, in
this turbulent city, there may be struggle, and a counter-plot to
bring Arsinoë to Egypt and set her on the throne. Therefore
Alexandria must be severely dealt with&mdash;ay, even to
destruction, if need be. As for Arsinoë, those go forth to-morrow
on the news of the Queen's death who shall slay her
secretly."</p>

<p>"There remains the lad Caesarion," I said. "Rome might claim
through Caesar's son, and the child of Cleopatra inherits
Cleopatra's rights. Here is a double danger."</p>

<p>"Fear not," said my uncle; "to-morrow Caesarion joins those
who begat him in Amenti. I have made provision. The Ptolemies
must be stamped out, so that no shoot shall ever spring from that
root blasted by Heaven's vengeance."</p>

<p>"Is there no other means?" I asked sadly. "My heart is sick at
the promise of this red rain of blood. I know the child well; he
has Cleopatra's fire and beauty and great Caesar's wit. It were
shame to murder him."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not so chicken-hearted, Harmachis," said my uncle,
sternly. "What ails thee, then? If the lad is thus, the more
reason that he should die. Wouldst thou nurse up a young lion to
tear thee from the throne?"</p>

<p>"Be it so," I answered, sighing. "At least he is spared much,
and will go hence innocent of evil. Now for the plans."</p>

<p>We sat long taking counsel, till at length, in face of the
great emergency and our high emprise, I felt something of the
spirit of former days flow back into my heart. At the last all
was ordered, and so ordered that it could scarce miscarry, for it
was fixed that if by any chance I could not come to slay
Cleopatra on this night, then the plot should hang in the scale
till the morrow, when the deed must be done upon occasion. For
the death of Cleopatra was the signal. These matters being
finished, once more we stood and, our hands upon the sacred
symbol, swore the oath that may not be written. And then my uncle
kissed me with tears of hope and joy standing in his keen black
eyes. He blessed me, saying that he would gladly give his life,
ay, and a hundred lives, if they were his, if he might but live
to see Egypt once more a nation, and me, Harmachis, the
descendant of its royal and ancient blood, seated on the throne.
For he was a patriot indeed, asking nothing for himself, and
giving all things to his cause. And I kissed him in turn, and
thus we parted. Nor did I ever see him more in the flesh who has
earned the rest that as yet is denied to me.</p>

<p>So I went, and, there being yet time, walked swiftly from
place to place in the great city, taking note of the positions of
the gates and of the places where our forces must be gathered. At
length I came to that quay where I had landed, and saw a vessel
sailing for the open sea. I looked, and in my heaviness of heart
longed that I were aboard of her, to be borne by her white wings
to some far shore where I might live obscure and die forgotten.
Also I saw another vessel that had dropped down the Nile, from
whose deck the passengers were streaming. For a moment I stood
watching them, idly wondering if they were from Abouthis, when
suddenly I heard a familiar voice beside me.</p>

<p>"<i>La! la!</i>" said the voice. "Why, what a city is this for
an old woman to seek her fortune in! And how shall I find those
to whom I am known? As well look for the rush in the papyrus-roll (14). Begone! thou knave! and let my basket of simples lie; or, by the Gods, I'll doctor thee with them!"</p>

<p class="footnote">14. Papyrus was manufactured from
the pith of rushes. Hence Atoua's saying.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>I turned, wondering, and found myself face to face with my
foster-nurse, Atoua. She knew me instantly, for I saw her start,
but in the presence of the people she checked her surprise.</p>

<p>"Good Sir," she whined, lifting her withered countenance
towards me, and at the same time making the secret sign. "By thy
dress thou shouldst be an astronomer, and I was specially told to
avoid astronomers as a pack of lying tricksters who worship their
own star only; and, therefore, I speak to thee, acting on the
principle of contraries, which is law to us women. For surely in
this Alexandria, where all things are upside down, the
astronomers may be the honest men, since the rest are clearly
knaves." And then, being by now out of earshot of the press,
"royal Harmachis, I am come charged with a message to thee from
thy father Amenemhat."</p>

<p>"Is he well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is well, though waiting for the moment tries him
sorely."</p>

<p>"And his message?"</p>

<p>"It is this. He sends greeting to thee and with it warning
that a great danger threatens thee, though he cannot read it.
These are his words: 'Be steadfast and prosper.'"</p>

<p>I bowed my head and the words struck a new chill of fear into
my soul.</p>

<p>"When is the time?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This very night. Where goest thou?"</p>

<p>"To the house of the honourable Sepa, Priest of Annu. Canst
thou guide me thither?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I may not stay; nor is it wise that I should be seen
with thee. Hold!" and I called a porter who was idling on the
quay, and, giving him a piece of money, bade him guide the old
wife to the house.</p>

<p>"Farewell," she whispered; "farewell till to-morrow. Be
steadfast and prosper."</p>

<p>Then I turned and went my way through the crowded streets,
where the people made place for me, the astronomer of Cleopatra,
for my fame had spread abroad.</p>

<p>And even as I went my footsteps seemed to beat <i>Be
steadfast, Be steadfast, Be steadfast</i>, till at last it was as
though the very ground cried out its warning to me.</p>

Of The Veiled Words Of Charmion,<br>
Of The Passing Of Harmachis<br>
Into The Presence Of Cleopatra, And<br>
Of The Overthrow Of Harmachis</p>

<br>

<p class="first">T WAS night, and I sat alone in my chamber,
waiting the moment when, as it was agreed, Charmion should summon
me to pass down to Cleopatra. I sat alone, and there before me
lay the dagger that was to pierce her. It was long and keen, and
the handle was formed of a sphinx of solid gold. I sat alone,
questioning the future, but no answer came. At length I looked
up, and Charmion stood before me&mdash;Charmion, no longer gay
and bright, but pale of face and hollow-eyed.</p>

<p>"Royal Harmachis," she said, "Cleopatra summons thee,
presently to declare to her the voices of the stars."</p>

<p>So the hour had fallen!</p>

<p>"It is well, Charmion," I answered. "Are all things in
order?"</p>

<p>"Yea, my Lord; all things are in order: well primed with wine,
Paulus guards the gates, the eunuchs are withdrawn save one, the
legionaries sleep, and already Sepa and his force lie hid
without. Nothing has been neglected, and no lamb skipping at the
shamble doors can be more innocent of its doom than is Queen
Cleopatra."</p>

<p>"It is well," I said again; "let us be going," and rising, I
placed the dagger in the bosom of my robe. Taking a cup of wine
that stood near, I drank deep of it, for I had scarce tasted food
all that day.</p>

<p>"One word," Charmion said hurriedly, "for it is not yet time:
last night &mdash;ah, last night&mdash;" and her bosom heaved, "I
dreamed a dream that haunts me strangely, and perchance thou also
didst dream a dream. It was all a dream and 'tis forgotten: is it
not so, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I said; "why troublest thou me thus at such an
hour?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not; but to-night, Harmachis, Fate is in labour
of a great event, and in her painful throes mayhap she'll crush
me in her grip&mdash;me or thee, or the twain of us, Harmachis.
And if that be so&mdash;well, I would hear from thee, before it
is done, that 'twas naught but a dream, and that dream
forgot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is all a dream," I said idly; "thou and I, and the
solid earth, and this heavy night of terror, ay, and this keen
knife&mdash;what are these but dreams, and with what face shall
the waking come?"</p>

<p>"So now, thou fallest in my humour, royal Harmachis. As thou
sayest, we dream; and while we dream yet can the vision change.
For the phantasies of dreams are wonderful, seeing that they have
no stability, but vary like the vaporous edge of sunset clouds,
building now this thing, and now that; being now dark and heavy,
and now alight with splendour. Therefore, before we wake to-
morrow tell me one word. Is that vision of last night, wherein I
<i>seemed</i> to be quite shamed, and thou didst <i>seem</i> to
laugh upon my shame, a fixed phantasy, or can it, perchance, yet
change its countenance? For remember, when that waking comes, the
vagaries of our sleep will be more unalterable and more enduring
than are the pyramids. Then they will be gathered into that
changeless region of the past where all things, great and
small&mdash;ay, even dreams, Harmachis, are, each in its own
semblance, frozen to stone and built into the Tomb of Time
immortal."</p>

<p>"Nay, Charmion," I replied, "I grieve if I did pain thee; but
over that vision comes no change. I said what was in my heart and
there's an end. Thou art my cousin and my friend, I can never be
more to thee."</p>

<p>"It is well&mdash;'tis very well," she said; "let it be
forgotten. And now on from dream&mdash;to dream," and she smiled
with such a smile as I had never seen her wear before; it was
sadder and more fateful than any stamp that grief can set upon
the brow.</p>

<p>For, though being blinded by my own folly and the trouble at
my heart I knew it not, with that smile, the happiness of youth
died for Charmion the Egyptian; the hope of love fled; and the
holy links of duty burst asunder. With that smile she consecrated
herself to Evil, she renounced her Country and her Gods, and
trampled on her oath. Ay, that smile marks the moment when the
stream of history changed its course. For had I never seen it on
her face Octavianus had not bestridden the world, and Egypt had
once more been free and great.</p>

<p>And yet it was but a woman's smile!</p>

<p>"Why lookest thou thus strangely, girl?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In dreams we smile," she answered. "And now it is time;
follow thou me. Be firm and prosper, royal Harmachis!" and
bending forward she took my hand and kissed it. Then, with one
strange last look, she turned and led the way down the stair and
through the empty halls.</p>

<p>In the chamber that is called the Alabaster Hall, the roof of
which is upborne by columns of black marble, we stayed. For
beyond was the private chamber of Cleopatra, the same in which I
had seen her sleeping.</p>

<p>"Abide thou here," she said, "while I tell Cleopatra of thy
coming," and she glided from my side.</p>

<p>I stood for long, mayhap in all the half of an hour, counting
my own heart-beats, and, as in a dream, striving to gather up my
strength to that which lay before me.</p>

<p>At length Charmion came back, her head held low and walking
heavily.</p>

<p>"Cleopatra waits thee," she said: "pass on, there is no
guard."</p>

<p>"Where do I meet thee when what must be done is done?" I asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Thou meetest me here, and then to Paulus. Be firm and
prosper. Harmachis, fare thee well!"</p>

<p>And so I went; but at the curtain I turned suddenly, and there
in the midst of that lonely lamplit hall I saw a strange sight.
Far away, in such a fashion that the light struck full upon her,
stood Charmion, her head thrown back, her white arms outstretched
as though to clasp, and on her girlish face a stamp of anguished
passion so terrible to see that, indeed, I cannot tell it! For
she believed that I, whom she loved, was passing to my death, and
this was her last farewell to me.</p>

<p class="caption">"Far away stood Charmion... her white arms outstretched as though to clasp."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>But I knew naught of this matter; so with another passing pang
of wonder I drew aside the curtains, gained the doorway, and
stood in Cleopatra's chamber. And there, upon a silken couch at
the far end of the perfumed chamber, clad in wonderful white
attire, rested Cleopatra. In her hand was a jewelled fan of
ostrich plumes, with which she gently fanned herself, and by her
side was her harp of ivory, and a little table whereon were figs
and goblets and a flask of ruby-coloured wine. I drew near slowly
through the soft dim light to where the Wonder of the World lay
in all her glowing beauty. And, indeed, I have never seen her
look so fair as she did upon that fatal night. Couched in her
amber cushions, she seemed to shine as a star on the twilight's
glow. Perfume came from her hair and robes, music fell from her
lips, and in her heavenly eyes all lights changed and gathered as
in the ominous opal's disc.</p>

<p>And this was the woman whom, presently, I must slay!</p>

<p>Slowly I drew near, bowing as I came; but she took no heed.
She lay there, and the jewelled fan floated to and fro like the
bright wing of some hovering bird.</p>

<p>At length I stood before her, and she glanced up, the ostrich-
plumes pressed against her breast as though to hide its
beauty.</p>

<p>"What! friend; art thou come?" she said. "It is well; for I
grew lonely here. Nay; 'tis a weary world! We know so many faces,
and there are so few whom we love to see again. Well, stand not
there so mute, but be seated." And she pointed with her fan to a
carven chair that was placed near her feet.</p>

<p>Once more I bowed and took the seat.</p>

<p>"I have obeyed the Queen's desire," I said, "and with much
care and skill worked out the lessons of the stars; and here is
the record of my labour. If the Queen permits, I will expound it
to her." And I rose, in order that I might pass round the couch
and, as she read, stab her in the back.</p>

<p>"Nay, Harmachis," she said quietly, and with a slow and lovely
smile. "Bide thou where thou art, and give me the writing. By
Serapis! thy face is too comely for me to wish to lose the sight
of it!"</p>

<p>Checked in this design, I could do nothing but hand her the
papyrus, thinking to myself that while she read I would arise
suddenly and plunge the dagger to her heart. She took it, and as
she did so touched my hand. Then she made pretence to read. But
she read no word, for I saw that her eyes were fixed upon me over
the edge of the scroll.</p>

<p>"Why placest thou thy hand within thy robe?" she asked
presently; for, indeed, I clutched the dagger's hilt. "Is thy
heart stirred?"</p>

<p>"Yea, O Queen," I said; "it beats high."</p>

<p>She gave no answer, but once more made pretence to read, and
the while she watched me.</p>

<p>I took counsel with myself. How should I do the hateful deed?
If I flung myself upon her now she would see me and scream and
struggle. Nay, I must wait a chance.</p>

<p>"The auguries are favourable, then, Harmachis?" she said at
length, though this she must have guessed.</p>

<p>"Yes, O Queen," I answered.</p>

<p>"It is well," and she cast the writing on the marble. "The
ships shall sail. For, good or bad, I am weary of weighing
chances."</p>

<p>"This is a heavy matter, O Queen," I said. "I had wished to
show upon what circumstance I base my forecast."</p>

<p>"Nay, not so, Harmachis; I have wearied of the ways of stars.
Thou hast prophesied; that is enough for me; for, doubtless,
being honest, thou hast written honestly. Therefore, save thou
thy reasons and we'll be merry. What shall we do? I could dance
to thee&mdash;there are none who can dance so well!&mdash;but it
would scarce be queenly. Nay, I have it. I will sing." And,
leaning forward, she raised herself, and, bending the harp
towards her, struck some wandering chords. Then her low voice
broke out in perfect and most sweet song.</p>

"She raised herself, and, bending the harp<br>
towards her, struck some wandering chords."</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>And thus she sang:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Night on the sea, and night upon the sky,<br>

And music in our hearts, we floated there,<br>

Lulled by the low sea voices, thou and I,<br>

And the wind's kisses in my cloudy hair:<br>

And thou didst gaze on me and call me fair&mdash;<br>

Enfolded by the starry robe of night&mdash;<br>

And then thy singing thrilled upon the air,<br>

Voice of the heart's desire and Love's delight.</p>

<p class="verse">
Adrift, with starlit skies above,<br>

With starlit seas below,<br>

We move with all the suns that move,<br>

With all the seas that flow;<br>

For bond or free,<br>

Earth, Sky, and Sea,<br>

Wheel with one circling will,<br>

And thy heart drifteth on to me,<br>

And only time stands still.</p>

<p class="verse">
Between two shores of Death we drift,<br>

Behind are things forgot:<br>

Before the tide is driving swift<br>

To lands beholden not.<br>

Above, the sky is far and cold;<br>

Below, the moaning sea<br>

Sweeps o'er the loves that were of old,<br>

But, oh, Love! kiss thou me.</p>

<p class="verse">
Ah, lonely are the ocean ways,<br>

And dangerous the deep,<br>

And frail the fairy barque that strays<br>

Above the seas asleep!<br>

Ah, toil no more at sail nor oar,<br>

We drift, or bond or free;<br>

On yon far shore the breakers roar,<br>

But, oh, Love! kiss thou me.</p>

<p class="verse">
And ever as thou sangest I drew near,<br>

Then sudden silence heard our hearts that beat,<br>

For now there was an end of doubt and fear,<br>

Now passion filled my soul and led my feet;<br>

Then silent didst thou rise thy love to meet,<br>

Who, sinking on thy breast, knew naught but thee,<br>

And in the happy night I kissed thee, Sweet;<br>

Ah, Sweet! between the starlight and the sea."</p>

<p><br>
The last echoes of her rich notes floated down the chamber,
and slowly died away; but in my heart they rolled on and on. I
have heard among the women- singers at Abouthis voices more
perfect than the voice of Cleopatra, but never have I heard one
so thrilling or so sweet with passion's honey-notes. And indeed
it was not the voice alone, it was the perfumed chamber in which
was set all that could move the sense; it was the passion of the
thought and words, and the surpassing grace and loveliness of
that most royal woman who sang them. For, as she sang, I seemed
to think that we twain were indeed floating alone with the night,
upon the starlit summer sea. And when she ceased to touch the
harp, and, rising, suddenly stretched out her arms towards me,
and with the last low notes of song yet quivering upon her lips,
let fall the wonder of her eyes upon my eyes, she almost drew me
to her. But I remembered, and would not.</p>

<p>"Hast thou, then, no word of thanks for my poor singing,
Harmachis?" she said at length.</p>

<p>"Yea, O Queen," I answered, speaking very low, for my voice
was choked; "but thy songs are not good for the sons of men to
hear&mdash;of a truth they overwhelm me!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Harmachis; there is no fear for thee," she said laughing
softly, "seeing that I know how far thy thoughts are set from
woman's beauty and the common weakness of thy sex. With cold iron
we may safely toy."</p>

<p>I thought within myself that coldest iron can be brought to
whitest heat if the fire be fierce enough. But I said nothing,
and, though my hand trembled, I once more grasped the dagger's
hilt, and, wild with fear at my own weakness, set myself to find
a means to slay her while yet my sense remained.</p>

<p>"Come hither, Harmachis," she went on, in her softest voice.
"Come, sit by me, and we will talk together; for I have much to
tell thee," and she made place for me at her side upon the silken
seat.</p>

<p>And I, thinking that I might so more swiftly strike, rose and
seated myself some little way from her on the couch, while,
flinging back her head, she gazed on me with her slumbrous
eyes.</p>

<p>Now was my occasion, for her throat and breast were bare, and,
with a mighty effort, once again I lifted my hand to clutch the
dagger-hilt. But, more quick than thought, she caught my fingers
with her own and gently held them.</p>

<p>"Why lookest thou so wildly, Harmachis?" she said. "Art
sick?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sick indeed!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Then lean thou on the cushions and rest thee," she answered,
still holding my hand, from which the strength had fled. "The fit
will surely pass. Too long hast thou laboured with thy stars. How
soft is the night air that flows from yonder casement heavy with
the breath of lilies! Hark to the whisper of the sea lapping
against the rocks, that, though it is faint, yet, being so
strong, doth almost drown the quick cool fall of yonder fountain.
List to Philomel; how sweet from a full heart of love she sings
her message to her dear! Indeed it is a lovely night, and most
beautiful is Nature's music, sung with a hundred voices from wind
and trees and birds and ocean's wrinkled lips, and yet sung all
to tune. Listen, Harmachis: I have guessed something concerning
thee. Thou, too, art of a royal race; no humble blood pours in
those veins of thine. Surely such a shoot could spring but from
the stock of Princes? What! gazest thou at the leafmark on my
breast? It was pricked there in honour of great Osiris, whom with
thee I worship. See!"</p>

<p>"Let me hence," I groaned, striving to rise; but all my
strength had gone.</p>

<p>"Nay, not yet awhile. Thou wouldst not leave me yet? thou
<i>canst</i> not leave me yet. Harmachis, hast thou never
loved?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, O Queen! What have I to do with love? Let me
hence!&mdash;I am faint&mdash;I am fordone!"</p>

<p>"Never to have loved&mdash;'tis strange! Never to have known
some woman-heart beat all in tune to thine&mdash;never to have
seen the eyes of thy adored aswim with passion's tears, as she
sighed her vows upon thy breast! &mdash;Never to have
loved!&mdash;never to have lost thyself in the mystery of
another's soul; nor to have learned how Nature can overcome our
naked loneliness, and with the golden web of love of twain weave
one identity! Why, it is never to have lived, Harmachis!"</p>

<p>And ever as she murmured she drew nearer to me, till at last,
with a long, sweet sigh, she flung one arm about my neck, and
gazed upon me with blue, unfathomable eyes, and smiled her dark,
slow smile, that, like an opening flower, revealed beauty within
beauty hidden. Nearer she bent her queenly form, and still more
near&mdash;now her perfumed breath played upon my hair, and now
her lips met mine.</p>

<p class="caption">"And now her lips met mine."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And woe is me! In that kiss, more deadly and more strong than
the embrace of Death, were forgotten Isis, my heavenly Hope,
Oaths, Honour, Country, Friends, all things&mdash;all things save
that Cleopatra clasped me in her arms, and called me Love and
Lord.</p>

<p>"Now pledge me," she sighed; "pledge me one cup of wine in
token of thy love."</p>

<p>I took the draught, and I drank deep; then too late I knew
that it was drugged.</p>

<p>I fell upon the couch, and, though my senses still were with
me, I could neither speak nor rise.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra, bending over me, drew the dagger from my
robe.</p>

<p>"<i>I've won!</i>" she cried, shaking back her long hair.
"I've won, and for the stake of Egypt, why, 'twas a game worth
playing! With this dagger, then, thou wouldst have slain me, O my
royal Rival, whose myrmidons even now are gathered at my palace
gate? Art still awake? Now what hinders me that I should not
plunge it to <i>thy</i> heart?"</p>

<br>


<p>I heard and feebly pointed to my breast, for I was fain to
die. She drew herself to the full of her imperial height, and the
great knife glittered in her hand. Down it came till its edge
pricked my flesh.</p>

<p>"Nay," she cried again, and cast it from her, "too well I like
thee. It were pity to slay such a man! I give thee thy life. Live
on, lost Pharaoh! Live on, poor fallen Prince, blasted by a
woman's wit! Live on, Harmachis&mdash; to adorn my triumph!"</p>

<p>Then sight left me; and in my ears I only heard the song of
the nightingale, the murmur of the sea, and the music of
Cleopatra's laugh of victory. And as I sank away, the sound of
that low laugh still followed me into the land of sleep, and
still it follows me through life to death.</p>

<p class="first">MORE I woke; it was to find myself in my
own chamber. I started up. Surely, I, too, had dreamed a dream?
It could be nothing but a dream? It could not be that I woke to
know myself a <i>traitor!</i> That the opportunity had gone for
ever! That I had betrayed the cause, and that last night those
brave men, headed by my uncle, had waited in vain at the outer
gate! That Egypt from Abu to Athu was even now
waiting&mdash;waiting in vain! Nay, whatever else might be, this
could not be! Oh, it was an awful dream which I had dreamed! a
second such would slay a man. It were better to die than face
such another vision sent from hell. But, though the thing was
naught but a hateful phantasy of a mind o'er-strained, where was
I now? Where was I now? I should be in the Alabaster Hall,
waiting till Charmion came forth.</p>

<p>Where was I? and O ye Gods! what was that dreadful thing,
whose shape was the shape of a man?&mdash;that thing draped in
bloodstained white and huddled in a hideous heap at the foot of
the couch on which I seemed to lie?</p>

<p>I sprang at it with a shriek, as a lion springs, and struck
with all my strength. The blow fell heavily, and beneath its
weight the thing rolled over upon its side. Half mad with terror,
I rent away the white covering; and there, his knees bound
beneath his hanging jaw, was the naked body of a man&mdash; and
that man the Roman Captain Paulus! There he lay, through his
heart a dagger &mdash;my dagger, handled with the sphinx of
gold!&mdash;and pinned by its blade to his broad breast a scroll,
and on the scroll, writing in the Roman character. I drew near
and read, and this was the writing:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
HARMACHIDI.SALVERE.EGO.SUM.QUEM.SUBDERE.NORAS<br>
PAULUS.ROMANUS.DISCE.HINC.QUID.PRODERE.PROSIT.</p>

<p class="cp">
<i>"Greeting, Harmachis! I was that Roman Paulus whom<br>
thou didst suborn. Learn now how blessed are traitors!"</i></p>

<p><br>
Sick and faint I staggered back from the sight of that white
corpse stained with its own blood. Sick and faint I staggered
back, till the wall stayed me, while without the birds sang a
merry greeting to the day. So it was no dream, and I was lost!
lost!</p>

<p>I thought of my aged father, Amenemhat. Yes, the vision of him
flashed into my mind, as he would be, when they came to tell him
his son's shame and the ruin of all his hopes. I thought of that
patriot priest, my uncle Sepa, waiting the long night through for
the signal which never came. Ah, and another thought followed
swift! How would it go with them? I was not the only traitor. I,
too, had been betrayed. By whom? By yonder Paulus, perchance. If
it were Paulus, he knew but little of those who conspired with
me. But the secret lists had been in my robe. O Osiris! they were
gone! and the fate of Paulus would be the fate of all the
patriots in Egypt. And at this thought my mind gave way. I sank
and swooned even where I stood.</p>

<p>My sense came back to me, and the lengthening shadows told me
that it was afternoon. I staggered to my feet; the corpse of
Paulus was still there, keeping its awful watch above me. I ran
desperately to the door. It was barred, and without I heard the
tramp of sentinels. As I stood they challenged and grounded their
spears. Then the bolts were shot back, the door opened, and
radiant, clad in royal attire, came the conquering Cleopatra. She
came alone, and the door was shut behind her. I stood like one
distraught; but she swept on till she was face to face with
me.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Harmachis," she said, smiling sweetly. "So, my
messenger has found thee!" and she pointed to the corpse of
Paulus. "Pah! he has an ugly look. Ho! guards!"</p>

<p>The door was opened, and two armed Gauls stepped across the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Take away this carrion," said Cleopatra, "and fling it to the
kites. Stay, draw that dagger from his traitor breast." The men
bowed low, and the knife, rusted red with blood, was dragged from
the heart of Paulus and laid upon the table. Then they seized him
by the head and body and staggered thence, and I heard their
heavy footfalls as they bore him down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Methinks, Harmachis, thou art in an evil case," she said,
when the sound of the footfalls had died away. "How strangely the
wheel of Fortune turns! But for that traitor," and she nodded
towards the door through which the corpse of Paulus had been
carried, "I should now be as ill a thing to look on as he is, and
the red rust on yonder knife would have been gathered from
<i>my</i> heart."</p>

<p>So it was Paulus who had betrayed me.</p>

<p>"Ay," she went on, "and when thou camest to me last night, I
<i>knew</i>that thou camest to slay. When, time upon time, thou
didst place thy hand within thy robe, I knew that it grasped a
dagger hilt, and that thou wast gathering thy courage to the deed
which thou didst little love to do. Oh! it was a strange wild
hour, well worth the living, and I wondered greatly, from moment
to moment, which of us twain would conquer, as we matched guile
with guile and force to force!</p>

<p>"Yea, Harmachis, the guards tramp before thy door, but be not
deceived. Did I not know that I hold thee to me by bonds more
strong than prison chains &mdash;did I not know that I am hedged
from ill at thy hands by a fence of honour harder for thee to
pass than all the spears of all my legions, thou hadst been dead
ere now, Harmachis. See, here is thy knife," and she handed me
the dagger; "now slay me if thou canst," and she drew near, tore
open the bosom of her robe, and stood waiting with calm eyes.</p>

<p>"Thou canst not slay me," she went on; "for there are things,
as I know well, that no man&mdash;no man such as thou
art&mdash;may do and live: and this is the chief of them&mdash;to
slay the woman who is all his own. Nay, stay thy hand! Turn not
that dagger against thy breast, for if thou mayst not slay me, by
how much more mayst thou not slay thyself, O thou forsworn Priest
of Isis! Art thou, then, so eager to face that outraged Majesty
in Amenti? With what eyes, thinkest thou, will the Heavenly
Mother look upon Her son, who, shamed in all things and false to
his most sacred vow, comes to greet Her, his life-blood on his
hands? Where, then, will be the space for thy
atonement?&mdash;if, indeed, thou mayest atone!"</p>

<p>Then I could bear no more, for my heart was broken. Alas! it
was too true &mdash;I dared not die! I was come to such a pass
that I did not even dare to die! I flung myself upon the couch
and wept&mdash;wept tears of blood and anguish.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra came to me, and, seating herself beside me, she
strove to comfort me, throwing her arms about my neck.</p>

<p>"Nay, love, look up," she said; "all is not lost for thee, nor
am I angered against thee. We did play a mighty game; but, as I
warned thee, I matched my woman's magic against thine, and I have
conquered. But I will be open with thee. Both as Queen and woman
thou hast my pity&mdash;ay, and more; nor do I love to see thee
plunged in sorrow. It was well and right that thou shouldst
strive to win back that throne my fathers seized, and the ancient
liberty of Egypt. Myself as lawful Queen had done the same, nor
shrunk from the deed of darkness to which I was sworn. Therein,
then, thou hast my sympathy, that ever goes out to what is great
and bold. It is well also that thou shouldst grieve over the
greatness of thy fall. Therein, then, as woman &mdash;as loving
woman&mdash;thou hast my sympathy. Nor is all lost. Thy plan was
foolish&mdash;for, as I hold, Egypt could never have stood alone
&mdash;for though thou hadst won the crown and country&mdash;as
without a doubt thou must have done&mdash;yet there was the Roman
to be reckoned with. And for thy hope learn this: I am little
known. There is no heart in this wide land that beats with a
truer love for ancient Khem than does this heart of mine
&mdash;nay, not thine own, Harmachis. Yet I have been heavily
shackled heretofore&mdash;for wars, rebellions, envies, plots,
have hemmed me in on every side, so that I might not serve my
people as I would. But thou, Harmachis, shalt show me how. Thou
shalt be my counsellor and my love. Is it a little thing,
Harmachis, to have won the heart of Cleopatra; that heart
&mdash;fie on thee!&mdash;that thou wouldst have stilled? Yes,
<i>thou</i>shalt unite me to my people and we will reign
together, thus linking in one the new kingdom and the old and the
new thought and the old. So do all things work for good&mdash;ay,
for the very best: and thus, by another and a gentler road, thou
shalt climb to Pharaoh's throne.</p>

<p>"See thou this, Harmachis: thy treachery shall be cloaked
about as much as may be. Was it, then, thy fault that a Roman
knave betrayed thy plans? that, thereon, thou wast drugged, thy
secret papers stolen and their key guessed? Will it, then, be a
blame to thee, the great plot being broken and those who built it
scattered, that thou, still faithful to thy trust, didst serve
thee of such means as Nature gave thee, and win the heart of
Egypt's Queen, that, through her gentle love, thou mightest yet
attain thy ends and spread thy wings of power across the land of
Nile? Am I an ill-counsellor, thinkest thou, Harmachis?"</p>

<p>I lifted my head, and a ray of hope crept into the darkness of
my heart; for when men fall they grasp at feathers. Then, I spoke
for the first time:</p>

<p>"And those with me&mdash;those who trusted me&mdash;what of
them?"</p>

<p>"Ay," she answered, "Amenemhat, thy father, the aged Priest of
Abouthis; and Sepa, thy uncle, that fiery patriot, whose great
heart is hid beneath so common a shell of form; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thought she would have said Charmion, but she named her
not.</p>

<p>"And many others&mdash;oh, I know them all!"</p>

<p>"Ay!" I said, "what of them?"</p>

<p>"Hear now, Harmachis," she answered, rising and placing her
hand upon my arm, "for thy sake I will show mercy to them. I will
do no more than must be done. I swear by my throne and by all the
Gods of Egypt that not one hair of thy aged father's head shall
be harmed by me; and, if it be not too late, I will also spare
thy uncle Sepa, ay, and the others. I will not do as did my
forefather, Epiphanes, who, when the Egyptians rose against him,
dragged Athinis, Pausiras, Chesuphus, and Irobasthus, bound to
his chariot&mdash;not as Achilles dragged Hector, but yet
living&mdash;round the city walls. I will spare them all, save
the Hebrews, if there be any Hebrews; for the Jews I hate."</p>

<p>"There are no Hebrews," I said.</p>

<p>"It is well," she said, "for no Hebrew will I ever spare. Am I
then, indeed, so cruel a woman as they say? In thy list,
Harmachis, were many doomed to die; and I have but taken the life
of one Roman knave, a double traitor, for he betrayed both me and
thee. Art thou not overwhelmed, Harmachis, with the weight of
mercy which I give thee, because&mdash;such are a woman's reasons
&mdash;thou pleasest me, Harmachis? Nay, by Serapis!" she added
with a little laugh, "I'll change my mind; I will not give thee
so much for nothing. Thou shalt buy it from me, and the price
shall be a heavy one&mdash;it shall be a kiss, Harmachis."</p>

<p>"Nay," I said, turning from that fair temptress, "the price is
too heavy; I kiss no more."</p>

<p>"Bethink thee," she answered, with a heavy frown. "Bethink
thee and choose. I am but a woman, Harmachis, and one who is not
wont to sue to men. Do as thou wilt; but this I say to
thee&mdash;if thou dost put me away, I will gather up the mercy I
have meted out. Therefore, most virtuous priest, choose thou
between the heavy burden of my love and the swift death of thy
aged father and of all those who plotted with him."</p>

<p>I glanced at her and saw that she was angered, for her eyes
shone and her bosom heaved. So, I sighed and kissed her, thereby
setting the seal upon my shame and bondage. Then, smiling like
the triumphant Aphrodité of the Greeks, she went thence, bearing
the dagger with her.</p>

<p>I knew not yet how deeply I was betrayed; or why I was still
left to draw the breath of life; or why Cleopatra, the tiger-
hearted, had grown merciful. I did not know that she feared to
slay me, lest, so strong was the plot and so feeble her hold upon
the Double Crown, the tumult that might tread hard upon the
tidings of my murder should shake her from the throne&mdash;even
when I was no more. I did not know that because of fear and the
weight of policy only she showed scant mercy to those whom I had
betrayed, or that because of cunning and not for the holy sake of
woman's love&mdash;though, in truth, she liked me well
enough&mdash;she chose rather to bind me to her by the fibres of
my heart. And yet I will say this in her behalf: even when the
danger-cloud had melted from her sky she kept faith, nor, save
Paulus and one other, did any suffer the utmost penalty of death
for their part in the great plot against Cleopatra's crown and
dynasty. But they suffered many other things.</p>

<p>And so she went, leaving the vision of her glory to strive
with the shame and sorrow in my heart. Oh, bitter were the hours
that could not now be made light with prayer. For the link
between me and the Divine was snapped, and Isis communed with Her
Priest no more. Bitter were the hours and dark, but ever through
their darkness shone the starry eyes of Cleopatra, and came the
echo of her whispered love. For not yet was the cup of sorrow
full. Hope still lingered in my heart, and I could almost think
that I had failed to some higher end, and that in the depths of
ruin I should find another and more flowery path to triumph.</p>

<p>For thus those who sin deceive themselves, striving to lay the
burden of their evil deeds upon the back of Fate, striving to
believe their wickedness may compass good, and to murder
Conscience with the sharp plea of Necessity. But it can avail
nothing, for hand in hand down the path of sin rush Remorse and
Ruin, and woe to him they follow! Ay, and woe to me who of all
sinners am the chief!</p>

Of The Imprisonment Of Harmachis,<br>

<p class="first">A SPACE of eleven days I was thus kept
prisoned in my chamber; nor did I see anyone except the sentries
at my doors, the slaves who in silence brought me food and drink,
and Cleopatra's self, who came continually. But, though her words
of love were many, she would tell me nothing of how things went
without. She came in many moods&mdash;now gay and laughing, now
full of wise thoughts and speech, and now passionate only, and to
every mood she gave some new-found charm. She was full of talk as
to how I should help her make Egypt great, and lessen the burdens
on the people, and fright the Roman eagles back. And, though at
first I listened heavily when she spoke thus, by slow advance as
she wrapped me closer and yet more close in her magic web, from
which there was no escape, my mind fell in time with hers. Then
I, too, opened something of my heart, and somewhat also of the
plans that I had formed for Egypt. She seemed to listen gladly,
weighing them all, and spoke of means and methods, telling me how
she would purify the Faith and repair the ancient
temples&mdash;ay, and build new ones to the Gods. And ever she
crept deeper into my heart, till at length, now that every other
thing had gone from me, I learned to love her with all the
unspent passion of my aching soul. I had naught left to me but
Cleopatra's love, and I twined my life about it, and brooded on
it as a widow over her only babe. And thus the very author of my
shame became my all, my dearest dear, and I loved her with a
strong love that grew and grew, till it seemed to swallow up the
past and make the present a dream. For she had conquered me, she
had robbed me of my honour, and steeped me to the lips in shame,
and I, poor fallen, blinded wretch, I kissed the rod that smote
me, and was her very slave.</p>

<p>Ay, even now, in those dreams which still come when Sleep
unlocks the secret heart, and sets its terrors free to roam
through the opened halls of Thought, I seem to see her royal
form, as erst I saw it, come with arms outstretched and Love's
own light shining in her eyes, with lips apart and flowing locks,
and stamped upon her face the look of utter tenderness that she
alone could wear. Ay, still, after all the years, I seem to see
her come as erst she came, and still I wake to know her an
unutterable lie!</p>

<p>And thus one day she came. She had fled in haste, she said,
from some great council summoned concerning the wars of Antony in
Syria, and she came, as she had left the council, in all her
robes of state, the sceptre in her hand, and on her brow the
uraeus diadem of gold. There she sat before me, laughing; for,
wearying of them, she had told the envoys to whom she gave
audience in the council that she was called from their presence
by a sudden message come from Rome; and the jest seemed merry to
her. Suddenly she rose, took the diadem from her brow, and set it
on my hair, and on my shoulders her royal mantle, and in my hand
the sceptre, and bowed the knee before me. Then, laughing again,
she kissed me on the lips, and said I was indeed her King. But,
remembering how I had been crowned in the halls of Abouthis, and
remembering also that wreath of roses of which the odour haunts
me yet, I rose, pale with wrath, and cast the trinkets from me,
asking how she dared to mock me&mdash;her caged bird. And I think
there was that about me which startled her, for she fell
back.</p>

<p>"Nay, Harmachis," she said, "be not wroth! How knowest thou
that I mock thee? How knowest thou that thou shalt not be Pharaoh
in fact and deed?"</p>

<p>"What meanest thou?" I said. "Wilt thou, then, wed me before
Egypt? How else can I be Pharaoh now?"</p>

<p>She cast down her eyes. "Perchance, love, it is in my mind to
wed thee," she said gently. "Listen," she went on: "Thou growest
pale, here, in this prison, and thou dost eat little. Gainsay me
not! I know it from the slaves. I have kept thee here, Harmachis,
for thy own sake, that is so dear to me; and for thy own sake,
and thy honour's sake, thou must still seem to be my prisoner.
Else wouldst thou be shamed and slain&mdash;ay, murdered
secretly. But I can meet thee here no more! therefore to-morrow I
shall free thee in all, save in the name, and thou shalt once
more be seen at Court as my astronomer. And I will give this
reason&mdash;that thou hast cleared thyself; and, moreover, that
thy auguries as regards the war have been auguries of truth
&mdash;as, indeed, they have, though for this I have no cause to
thank thee, seeing that thou didst suit thy prophecies to fit thy
cause. Now, farewell; for I must return to those heavy-browed
ambassadors; and grow not so sudden wroth, Harmachis, for who
knows what may come to pass betwixt thee and me?"</p>

<p>And, with a little nod, she went, leaving it on my mind that
she had it in her heart to wed me openly. And of a truth, I
believe that, at this hour, such was her thought. For, if she
loved me not, still she held me dear, and as yet she had not
wearied of me.</p>

<p>On the morrow Cleopatra came not, but Charmion
came&mdash;Charmion, whom I had not seen since that fatal night
of ruin. She entered and stood before me, with pale face and
downcast eyes, and her first words were words of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she said, in her gentle voice, "in that I dare to
come to thee in Cleopatra's place. Thy joy is not delayed for
long, for thou shalt see her presently."</p>

<p>I shrank at her words, as well I might, and, seeing her
vantage, she seized it.</p>

<p>"I come, Harmachis&mdash;royal no more!&mdash;I come to say
that thou art free! Thou art free to face thine own infamy, and
see it thrown back from every eye which trusted thee, as shadows
are from water. I come to tell thee that the great plot&mdash;the
plot of twenty years and more&mdash;is at its utter end. None
have been slain, indeed, unless it is Sepa, who has vanished. But
all the leaders have been seized and put in chains, or driven
from the land, and their party is broken and scattered. The storm
has melted before it burst. Egypt is lost, and lost for ever, for
her last hope is gone! No longer may she struggle&mdash;now for
all time she must bow her neck to the yoke, and bare her back to
the rod of the oppressor!"</p>

<p>I groaned aloud. "Alas, I was betrayed!" I said. "Paulus
betrayed us."</p>

<p>"Thou wast betrayed? Nay, thou thyself wast the betrayer! How
came it that thou didst not slay Cleopatra when thou wast alone
with her? Speak, thou forsworn!"</p>

<p>"She drugged me," I said again.</p>

<p>"O Harmachis!" answered the pitiless girl, "how low art thou
fallen from that Prince whom once I knew!&mdash;thou who dost not
scorn to be a liar! Yea, thou wast drugged&mdash;drugged with a
love-philtre! Yea, thou didst sell Egypt and thy cause for the
price of a wanton's kiss! Thou Sorrow and thou Shame!" she went
on, pointing her finger at me and lifting her eyes to my face,
"thou Scorn!&mdash;thou Outcast!&mdash;and thou Contempt! Deny if
it thou canst. Ay, shrink from me&mdash;knowing what thou art,
well mayst thou shrink! Crawl to Cleopatra's feet, and kiss her
sandals till such time as it pleases her to trample thee in thy
kindred dirt; but from all honest folk
<i>shrink!</i>&mdash;<i>shrink!</i>"</p>

<p>My soul quivered beneath the lash of her bitter scorn and
hate, but I had no words to answer.</p>

<p>"How comes it," I said at last in a heavy voice, "that thou,
too, art not betrayed, but art still here to taunt me, thou who
once didst swear that thou didst love me? Being a woman, hast
thou no pity for the frailty of man?"</p>

<p>"My name was not on the lists," she said, dropping her dark
eyes. "Here is an opportunity: betray me also, Harmachis! Ay, it
is because I once loved thee&mdash;dost thou, indeed, remember
it?&mdash;that I feel thy fall the more. The shame of one whom we
have loved must in some sort become our shame, and must ever
cling to us, because we blindly held a thing so base close to our
inmost heart. Art thou also, then, a fool? Wouldst thou, fresh
from thy royal wanton's arms, come to me for comfort&mdash;to
<i>me</i> of all the world?"</p>

<p>"How know I," I said, "that it was not thou who, in thy
jealous anger, didst betray our plans? Charmion, long ago Sepa
warned me against thee, and of a truth now that I
recall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is like a traitor," she broke in, reddening to her brow,
"to think that all are of his family, and hold a common mind!
Nay, I betrayed thee not; it was that poor knave, Paulus, whose
heart failed him at the last, and who is rightly served. Nor will
I stay to hear thoughts so base. Harmachis&mdash; royal no
more!&mdash;Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, bids me say that thou art
free, and that she waits thee in the Alabaster Hall."</p>

<p>And shooting one swift glance through her long lashes she
curtsied and was gone.</p>

<p>So once more I came and went about the Court, though but
sparingly, for my heart was full of shame and terror, and on
every face I feared to see the scorn of those who knew me for
what I was. But I saw nothing, for all those who had knowledge of
the plot had fled, and Charmion had spoken no word, for her own
sake. Also, Cleopatra had put it about that I was innocent. But
my guilt lay heavy on me, and made me thin and wore away the
beauty of my countenance. And though I was free in name, yet I
was ever watched; nor might I stir beyond the palace grounds.</p>

<p>And at length came the day which brought with it Quintus
Dellius, that false Roman knight who ever served the rising star.
He bore letters to Cleopatra from Marcus Antonius, the Triumvir,
who, fresh from the victory of Philippi, was now in Asia wringing
gold from the subject kings with which to satisfy the greed of
his legionaries.</p>

<p>Well I mind me of the day. Cleopatra, clad in her robes of
state, attended by the officers of her Court, among whom I stood,
sat in the great hall on her throne of gold, and bade the heralds
admit the Ambassador of Antony, the Triumvir. The great doors
were thrown wide, and amidst the blare of trumpets and salutes of
the Gallic guards the Roman came in, clad in glittering golden
armour and a scarlet cloak of silk, and followed by his suite of
officers. He was smooth-faced and fair to look upon, and with a
supple form; but his mouth was cold, and false were his shifting
eyes. And while the heralds called out his name, titles, and
offices, he fixed his gaze on Cleopatra&mdash;who sat idly on
her throne all radiant with beauty&mdash;as a man who is amazed.
Then when the heralds had made an end, and he still stood thus,
not stirring, Cleopatra spoke in the Latin tongue:</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-1st-19"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="1306521h-images/Cleopatra-18.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"He fixed his gaze on Cleopatra... as a man who is amazed."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Greeting to thee, noble Dellius, envoy of the most mighty
Antony, whose shadow lies across the world as though Mars himself
now towered up above us petty Princes&mdash;greeting and welcome
to our poor city of Alexandria. Unfold, we pray thee, the purpose
of thy coming."</p>

<p>Still the crafty Dellius made no answer, but stood as a man
amazed.</p>

<p>"What ails thee, noble Dellius, that thou dost not speak?"
asked Cleopatra. "Hast thou, then, wandered so long in Asia that
the doors of Roman speech are shut to thee? What tongue hast
thou? Name it, and We will speak in it&mdash;for all tongues are
known to Us."</p>

<p>Then at last he spoke in a soft full voice: "Oh, pardon me,
most lovely Egypt, if I have thus been stricken dumb before thee:
but too great beauty, like Death himself, doth paralyse the
tongue and steal our sense away. The eyes of him who looks upon
the fires of the mid-day sun are blind to all beside, and thus
this sudden vision of thy glory, royal Egypt, overwhelmed my
mind, and left me helpless and unwitting of all things else."</p>

<p>"Of a truth, noble Dellius," answered Cleopatra, "they teach a
pretty school of flattery yonder in Cilicia."</p>

<p>"How goes the saying here in Alexandria?" replied the courtly
Roman: "'The breath of flattery cannot waft a cloud,' (15) does it not? But to my task. Here, royal Egypt, are letters under the hand and seal of the noble Antony treating of certain matters of the State. Is it thy pleasure that I should read them openly?"</p>

<p class="footnote">15. In other words, what is Divine is beyond the reach of human praise. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"Break the seals and read," she answered.</p>

<p>Then bowing, he broke the seals and read:</p>

<p>"The <i>Triumviri Reipublicae Constituendae</i>, by the mouth
of Marcus Antonius, the Triumvir, to Cleopatra, by grace of the
Roman People Queen of Upper and Lower Egypt, send greeting.
Whereas it has come to our knowledge that thou, Cleopatra, hast,
contrary to thy promise and thy duty, both by thy servant
Allienus and by thy servant Serapion, the Governor of Cyprus,
aided the rebel murderer Cassius against the arms of the most
noble Triumvirate. And, whereas it has come to our knowledge that
thou thyself wast but lately making ready a great fleet to this
end. We summon thee that thou dost without delay journey to
Cilicia, there to meet the noble Antony, and in person make
answer concerning these charges which are laid against thee. And
we warn thee that if thou dost disobey this our summons it is at
thy peril. Farewell."</p>

<p>The eyes of Cleopatra flashed as she hearkened to these high
words, and I saw her hands tighten on the golden lions' heads
whereon they rested.</p>

<p>"We have had the flattery," she said; "and now, lest we be
cloyed with sweets, we have its antidote! Listen thou, Dellius:
the charges in that letter, or, rather, in that writ of summons,
are false, as all folk can bear us witness. But it is not now,
and it is not to thee, that We will make defence of our acts of
war and policy. Nor will We leave our kingdom to journey into far
Cilicia, and there, like some poor suppliant at law, plead our
cause before the Court of the Noble Antony. If Antony would have
speech with us, and inquire concerning these high matters, the
sea is open, and his welcome shall be royal. Let him come
thither! That is our answer to thee and to the Triumvirate, O
Dellius!"</p>

<p>But Dellius smiled as one who would put away the weight of
wrath, and once more spoke:</p>

<p>"Royal Egypt, thou knowest not the noble Antony. He is stern
on paper, and ever he sets down his thoughts as though his stylus
were a spear dipped in the blood of men. But face to face with
him, thou, of all the world, shalt find him the gentlest warrior
that ever won a battle. Be advised, O Egypt! and come. Send me
not hence with such angry words, for if thou dost draw Antony to
Alexandria, then woe to Alexandria, to the people of the Nile,
and to thee, great Egypt! For then he will come armed and
breathing war, and it shall go hard with thee, who dost defy the
gathered might of Rome. I pray thee, then, obey this summons.
Come to Cilicia; come with peaceful gifts and not in arms. Come
in thy beauty, and tricked in thy best attire, and thou hast
naught to fear from the noble Antony." He paused and looked at
her meaningly; while I, taking his drift, felt the angry blood
surge into my face.</p>

<p>Cleopatra, too, understood, for I saw her rest her chin upon
her hand and the cloud of thought gathered in her eyes. For a
time she sat thus, while the crafty Dellius watched her
curiously. And Charmion, standing with the other ladies by the
throne, she also read his meaning, for her face lit up, as a
summer cloud lights in the evening when the broad lightning
flares behind it. Then once more it grew pale and quiet.</p>

<p>At length Cleopatra spoke. "This is a heavy matter," she said,
'and therefore, noble Dellius, we must have time to let our
judgment ripen. Rest thou here, and make thee as merry as our
poor circumstances allow. Thou shalt have thy answer within ten
days."</p>

<p>The envoy thought awhile, then replied smiling: "It is well, O
Egypt; on the tenth day from now I will attend for my answer, and
on the eleventh I sail hence to join Antony my Lord."</p>

<p>Once more, at a sign from Cleopatra, the trumpets blared, and
he withdrew bowing.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HAT same night Cleopatra summoned me to her
private chamber. I went, and found her much troubled in mind;
never before had I seen her so deeply moved. She was alone, and,
like some trapped lioness, walked to and fro across the marble
floor, while thought chased thought across her mind, each, as
clouds scudding over the sea, for a moment casting its shadow in
her deep eyes.</p>

<p>"So thou art come, Harmachis," she said, resting for a while,
as she took my hand. "Counsel me, for never did I need counsel
more. Oh, what days have the Gods measured out to me&mdash;days
restless as the ocean! I have known no peace from childhood up,
and it seems none shall I know. Scarce by a very little have I
escaped thy dagger's point, Harmachis, when this new trouble,
that, like a storm, has gathered beneath the horizon's rim,
suddenly bursts over me. Didst mark that tigerish fop? Well
should I love to trap him! How soft he spoke! Ay, he purred like
a cat, and all the time he stretched his claws. Didst hear the
letter, too? it has an ugly sound. I know this Antony. When I was
but a child, budding into womanhood, I saw him; but my eyes were
ever quick, and I took his measure. Half Hercules and half a
fool, with a dash of genius veining his folly through. Easily led
by those who enter at the gates of his voluptuous sense; but if
crossed, an iron foe. True to his friends, if, indeed, he loves
them; and ofttimes false to his own interest. Generous, hardy,
and in adversity a man of virtue; in prosperity a sot and a slave
to woman. That is Antony. How deal with such a man, whom fate and
opportunity, despite himself, have set on the crest of fortune's
wave? One day it will overwhelm him; but till that day he sweeps
across the world and laughs at those who drown."</p>

<p>"Antony is but a man," I answered, "and a man with many foes;
and, being but a man, he can be overthrown."</p>

<p>"Ay, he can be overthrown; but he is one of three, Harmachis.
Now that Cassius hath gone where all fools go, Rome has thrown
out a hydra head. Crush one, and another hisses in thy face.
There's Lepidus, and with him, that young Octavianus, whose cold
eyes may yet with a smile of triumph look on the murdered forms
of empty, worthless Lepidus, of Antony, and of Cleopatra. If I go
not to Cilicia, mark thou! Antony will knit up a peace with these
Parthians, and, taking the tales they tell of me for
truth&mdash;and, indeed, there is truth in them&mdash;will fall
with all his force on Egypt. And how then?"</p>

<p>"How then? Why, then we'll drum him back to Rome."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou sayest so, and, perchance, Harmachis, had I not won
that game we played together some twelve days gone, thou, being
Pharaoh, mightest well have done this thing, for round thy throne
old Egypt would have gathered. But Egypt loves not me nor my
Greek blood; and I have but now scattered that great plot of
thine, in which half the land was meshed. Will these men, then,
arise to succour me? Were Egypt true to me, I could, indeed, hold
my own against all the force that Rome may bring; but Egypt hates
me, and had as lief be ruled by the Roman as the Greek. Still I
might make defence had I the gold, for with money soldiers can be
bought to feed the maw of mercenary battle. But I have none; my
treasuries are dry, and though there is wealth in the land, yet
debts perplex me. These wars have brought me ruin, and I know not
how to find a talent. Perchance, Harmachis, thou who art, by
hereditary right, Priest of the Pyramids," and she drew near and
looked me in the eyes, "perchance, if long descended rumour does
not lie, thou canst tell me where I can touch the gold to save
thy land from ruin, and thy Love from the grasp of Antony? Say,
is it so?"</p>

<p>I thought a while, and then I answered:</p>

<p>"And if such a tale were true, and if I could show thee
treasure stored by the mighty Pharaohs of the most far-off age
against the needs of Khem, how can I know that thou wouldst
indeed make use of that wealth to those good ends?"</p>

<p>"Is there, then, a treasure?" she asked curiously. "Nay, fret
me not, Harmachis; for of a truth the very name of gold at this
time of want is like the sight of water in the desert."</p>

<p>"I believe," I said, "that there is such a treasure, though I
myself have never seen it. But I know this, that if it still lie
in the place where it was set, it is because so heavy a curse
will rest upon him who shall lay hands on it wickedly and for
selfish ends, that none of those Pharaohs to whom it has been
shown have dared to touch it, however sore their need."</p>

<p>"So," she said, "they were cowardly aforetime, or else their
need was not great. Wilt thou show me this treasure, then,
Harmachis?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I answered, "I will show it to thee if it still be
there, when thou hast sworn that thou wilt use it to defend Egypt
from this Roman Antony and for the welfare of her people."</p>

<p>"I swear it!" she said earnestly. "Oh, I swear by every God in
Khem that if thou showest me this great treasure, I will defy
Antony and send Dellius back to Cilicia with sharper words than
those he brought. Yes, I'll do more, Harmachis: so soon as may
be, I will take thee to husband before all the world, and thou
thyself shalt carry out thy plans and beat off the Roman
eagles."</p>

<p>Thus she spoke, gazing at me with truthful, earnest eyes. I
believed her, and for the first time since my fall was for a
moment happy, thinking that all was not lost to me, and that with
Cleopatra, whom I loved thus madly, I might yet win my place and
power back.</p>

<p>"Swear it, Cleopatra!" I said.</p>

<p>"I swear, beloved! and thus I seal my oath!" and she kissed me
on the forehead. And I, too, kissed her; and we talked of what we
would do when we were wed, and how we should overcome the
Roman.</p>

<p>And thus I was again beguiled; though I believe that, had it
not been for the jealous anger of Charmion&mdash;which, as shall
be seen, was ever urging her forward to fresh deeds of
shame&mdash;Cleopatra would have wedded me and broken with the
Roman. And, indeed, in the issue, it had been better for her and
Egypt.</p>

<p>We sat far into the night, and I revealed to her somewhat of
that ancient secret of the mighty treasure hid beneath the mass
of <i>Her</i>. Thither, it was agreed, we should go on the
morrow, and the second night from now attempt its search. So,
early on the next day, a boat was secretly made ready, and
Cleopatra entered it, veiled as an Egyptian lady about to make a
pilgrimage to the Temple of Horemkhu. And I also entered, cloaked
as a pilgrim, and with us ten of her most trusted servants
disguised as sailors. But Charmion went not with us. We sailed
with a fair wind from the Canopic mouth of the Nile; and that
night, pushing on with the moon, we reached Sais at midnight, and
here rested for a while. At dawn we once more loosed our craft,
and all that day sailed swiftly, till, at last, at the third hour
from the sunset, we came in sight of the lights of that fortress
which is called Babylon. Here, on the opposite bank of the river,
we moored our ship safely in a bed of reeds.</p>

<p>Then, on foot and secretly, we set out for the pyramids, which
were at a distance of two leagues, Cleopatra, I and one trusted
eunuch, for we left the other servants with the boat. Only I
caught an ass for Cleopatra to ride that was wandering in a
tilled field, and threw a cloak upon it. She sat on it and I led
the ass by paths I knew, the eunuch following us on foot. And,
within little more than an hour, having gained the great
causeway, we saw the mighty pyramids towering up through the
moonlit air and aweing us to silence. We passed on in utter
silence, through the haunted city of the dead, for all around us
stood the solemn tombs, till at length we climbed the rocky hill,
and stood in the deep shadow of Khufu Khut, the splendid Throne
of Khufu.</p>

<p>"Of a truth," whispered Cleopatra, as she gazed up the
dazzling marble slope above her, everywhere blazoned over with a
million mystic characters &mdash;"of a truth, there were Gods
ruling in Khem in those days, and not men. This place is sad as
Death&mdash;ay, and as mighty and far from man. Is it here that
we must enter?"</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered, "it is not here. Pass on."</p>

<p>I led the way through a thousand ancient tombs, till we stood
in the shadow of Ur the Great, and gazed at his red heaven-
piercing mass.</p>

<p>"Is it here that we must enter?" she whispered once again.</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered, "it is not here. Pass on."</p>

<p>We passed on through many more tombs, till we stood in the
shadow of <i>Her</i> (16), and Cleopatra gazed astonished at its
polished beauty, which for thousands of years, night by night,
had mirrored back the moon, and at the black girdle of Ethiopian
stone that circled its base about. For this is the most beautiful
of all pyramids.</p>

<p class="footnote">16. The "Upper," now known as the Third Pyramid. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"Is it that we must enter?" she said.</p>

<p>I answered, "It is here."</p>

<p>We passed round between the Temple of the Worship of his
Divine Majesty, Menkau-ra, the Osirian, and in the base of the
pyramid till we came to the north side. Here in the centre is
graved the name of Pharaoh Menkau-ra, who built the pyramid to be
his tomb, and stored his treasure in it against the need of
Khem.</p>

<p>"If the treasure still remains," I said to Cleopatra, "as it
remained in the days of my great-great-grandfather, who was
Priest of this Pyramid before me, it is hid deep in the womb of
the mass before thee, Cleopatra; nor can it be come by without
toil, danger, and terror of mind. Art thou prepared to enter
&mdash;for thou thyself must enter and must judge?"</p>

<p>"Canst thou not go in with the eunuch, Harmachis, and bring
the treasure forth?" she said, for a little her courage began to
fail her.</p>

<p>"Nay, Cleopatra," I answered, "not even for thee and for the
weal of Egypt can I do this thing, for of all sins it would be
the greatest sin. But it is lawful for me to do this. I, as
hereditary holder of the secret, may, upon demand, show to the
ruling monarch of Khem the place where the treasure lies, and
show also the warning that is written. And if on seeing and
reading, the Pharaoh deems that the need of Khem is so sore and
strait that it is lawful for him to brave the curse of the Dead
and draw forth the treasure, it is well, for on his head must
rest the weight of this dread deed. Three monarchs&mdash;so say
the records that I have read&mdash;have thus dared to enter in
the time of need. They were the Divine Queen Hatshepsu, that
wonder known to the Gods alone; her Divine brother Tahutimes Men-
Kheper-ra; and the Divine Rameses Mi- amen. But of these three
Majesties, not one when they saw dared to touch; for, though
sharp their need, it was not great enough to consecrate the act.
So, fearing lest the curse should fall upon them, they went hence
sorrowing."</p>

<p>She thought a little, till at last her spirit overcame her
fear.</p>

<p>"At the least I will see with mine own eyes," she said.</p>

<p>"It is well," I answered. Then, stones having been piled up by
me and the eunuch who was with us on a certain spot at the base
of the pyramid, to somewhat more than the height of a man, I
climbed on them and searched for the secret mark, no larger than
a leaf. I found it with some trouble, for the weather and the
rubbing of the wind-stirred sand had worn even the Ethiopian
stone. Having found it, I pressed on it with all my strength in a
certain fashion. even after the lapse of many years the stone
swung round, showing a little opening, through which a man might
scarcely creep. As it swung, a mighty bat, white in colour as
though with unreckoned age, and such as I had never seen before
for bigness, for his measure was the measure of a hawk, flew
forth and for a moment hovered over Cleopatra, then sailed slowly
up and up in circles, till at last he was lost in the bright
light of the moon.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra uttered a cry of terror, and the eunuch, who was
watching, fell down in fear, believing it to be the guardian
Spirit of the pyramid. And I, too, feared, though I said nothing.
For even now I believe that it was the Spirit of Menkau-ra, the
Osirian, who, taking the form of a bat, flew forth from his holy
House in warning.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>I waited a while, till the foul air should clear from the
passage. Then I drew out the lamps, kindled them, and passed
them, to the number of three, into the entrance of the passage.
This done, I went to the eunuch, and, taking him aside, I swore
him by the living spirit of Him who sleeps at Abouthis that he
should not reveal those things which he was about to see.</p>

<p>This he swore, trembling sorely, for he was very much afraid.
Nor, indeed, did he reveal them.</p>

<p>This done, I clambered through the opening, taking with me a
coil of rope, which I wound around my middle, and beckoned to
Cleopatra to come. Making fast the skirt of her robe, she came,
and I drew her through the opening, so that at length she stood
behind me in the passage which is lined with slabs of granite.
After her came the eunuch, and he also stood in the passage.
Then, having taken counsel of the plan of the passage that I had
brought with me, and which, in signs that none but the initiated
can read, was copied from those ancient writings that had come
down to me through one-and-forty generations of my predecessors,
the Priests of this Pyramid of <i>Her</i>, and of the worship of
the Temple of the Divine Menkau-ra, the Osirian, I led the way
through that darksome place towards the utter silence of the
tomb. Guided by the feeble light of our lamps, we passed down the
steep incline, gasping in the heat and the thick, stagnated air.
Presently we had left the region of the masonry and were slipping
down a gallery hewn in the living rock. For twenty paces or more
it ran steeply. Then its slope lessened and shortly we found
ourselves in a chamber painted white, so low that I, being tall,
had scarcely room to stand; but in length four paces, and in
breadth three, and cased throughout with sculptured panels. Here
Cleopatra sank upon the floor and rested awhile, overcome by the
heat and the utter darkness.</p>

<p>"Rise!" I said. "We must not linger here, or we faint."</p>

<p>So she rose, and passing hand in hand through that chamber, we
found ourselves face to face with a mighty door of granite, let
down from the roof in grooves. Once more I took counsel of the
plan, pressed with my foot upon a certain stone, and waited.
Then, suddenly and softly, I know not by what means, the mass
heaved itself from its bed of living rock. We passed beneath, and
found ourselves face to face with a second door of granite. Again
I pressed on a certain spot, and this door swung wide of itself,
and we went through, to find ourselves face to face with a third
door, yet more mighty than the two through which we had won our
way. Following the secret plan, I struck this door with my foot
upon a certain spot, and it sank slowly as though at a word of
magic till its head was level with the floor of rock. We crossed
and gained another passage which, descending gently for a length
of fourteen paces, led us into a great chamber, paved with black
marble, more than nine cubits high, by nine cubits broad, and
thirty cubits long. In this marble floor was sunk a great
sarcophagus of granite, and on its lid were graved the name and
titles of the Queen of Menkau-ra. In this chamber, too, the air
was purer, though I know not by what means it came thither.</p>

<p>"Is the treasure here?" gasped Cleopatra.</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered; "follow me," and I led the way to a
gallery, which we entered through an opening in the floor of the
great chamber. It had been closed by a trap-door of stone, but
the door was open. Creeping along this shaft, or passage, for
some ten paces, we came at length to a well, seven cubits in
depth. Making fast one end of the rope that I had brought about
my body and the other to a ring in the rock, I was lowered,
holding the lamp in my hand, till I stood in the last resting-
place of the Divine Menkau-ra. Then the rope was drawn up, and
Cleopatra, being made fast to it, was let down by the eunuch, and
I received her in my arms. But I bade the eunuch, sorely against
his will, since he feared to be left alone, await our return at
the mouth of the shaft. For it was not lawful that he should
enter whither we went.</p>

<p class="first">STOOD within a small arched chamber, paved
and lined with great blocks of the granite stone of Syene. There
before us&mdash;hewn from a single mass of basalt shaped like a
wooden house and resting on a sphinx with a face of
gold&mdash;was the sarcophagus of the Divine Menkau-ra.</p>

<p>We stood and gazed in awe, for the weight of the silence and
the solemnity of that holy place seemed to crush us. Above us,
cubit over cubit in its mighty measure, the pyramid towered up to
heaven and was kissed of the night air. But we were deep in the
bowels of the rock beneath its base. We were alone with the dead,
whose rest we were about to break; and no sound of the murmuring
air, and no sight of life came to dull the awful edge of
solitude. I gazed on the sarcophagus; its heavy lid had been
lifted and rested at its side, and around it the dust of ages had
gathered thick.</p>

<p>"See," I whispered, pointing to a writing, daubed with pigment
upon the wall in the sacred symbols of ancient times.</p>

<p>"Read it, Harmachis," answered Cleopatra, in the same low
voice; "for I cannot."</p>

<p>Then I read: "I, Rameses Mi-amen, in my day and in my hour of
need, visited this sepulchre. But, though great my need and bold
my heart, I dared not face the curse of Menkau-ra. Judge, O thou
who shalt come after me, and, if thy soul is pure and Khem be
utterly distressed, take thou that which I have left."</p>

<p>"Where, then, is the treasure?" she whispered. "Is that
Sphinx-face of gold?"</p>

<p>"Even there," I answered, pointing to the sarcophagus. "Draw
near and see."</p>

<p>And she took my hand and drew near.</p>

<p>The cover was off, but the painted coffin of the Pharaoh lay
in the depths of the sarcophagus. We climbed the Sphinx, then I
blew the dust from the coffin with my breath and read that which
was written on its lid. And this was written:</p>

<p>"Pharaoh Menkau-ra, the Child of Heaven.</p>

<p>"Pharaoh Menkau-ra, Royal Son of the Sun.</p>

<p>"Pharaoh Menkau-ra, who didst lie beneath the heart of
Nout.</p>

<p>"Nout, thy Mother, wraps thee in the spell of Her holy
name.</p>

<p>"The name of thy Mother, Nout, is the mystery of Heaven.</p>

<p>"Nout, thy Mother, gathers thee to the number of the Gods.</p>

<p>"Nout, thy Mother, breathes on thy foes and utterly destroys
them.</p>

<p>"O Pharaoh Menkau-ra, who livest for ever!"</p>

<p>"Where, then, is the treasure?" she asked again. "Here,
indeed, is the body of the Divine Menkau-ra; but the flesh even
of Pharaohs is not gold, and if the face of this Sphinx be gold
how may we move it?"</p>

<p>For answer I bade her stand upon the Sphinx and grasp the
upper part of the coffin while I grasped its foot. Then, at my
word, we lifted, and the lid of the case, which was not fixed,
came away, and we set it upon the floor. And there in the case
was the mummy of Pharaoh, as it had been laid three thousand
years before. It was a large mummy, and somewhat ungainly. Nor
was it adorned with a gilded mask, as is the fashion of our day,
for the head was wrapped in clothes yellow with age, which were
made fast with pink flaxen bandages, under which were pushed the
stems of lotus-blooms. And on the breast, wreathed round with
lotus-flowers, lay a large plate of gold closely written over
with sacred writing. I lifted up the plate, and, holding it to
the light, I read:</p>


<p><br>
<i>"I, Menkau-ra, the Osirian, aforetime Pharaoh of the Land of
Khem, who in my day did live justly and ever walked in the path
marked for my feet by the decree of the Invisible, who was the
beginning and is the end, speak from my tomb to those who after
me shall for an hour sit upon my Throne. Behold, I, Menkau-ra,
the Osirian, having in the days of my life been warned of a dream
that a time will come when Khem shall fear to fall into the hands
of strangers, and her monarch shall have great need of treasure
wherewith to furnish armies to drive the barbarian back, have out
of my wisdom done this thing. For it having pleased the
protecting Gods to give me wealth beyond any Pharaoh who has been
since the days of Horus&mdash;thousands of cattle and geese,
thousands of calves and asses, thousands of measures of corn, and
hundreds of measures of gold and gems; this wealth I have used
sparingly, and that which remains I have bartered for precious
stones&mdash;even for emeralds, the most beautiful and largest
that are in the world. These stones, then, I have stored up
against that day of the need of Khem. But because as there have
been, so there shall be, those who do wickedly on the earth, and
who, in the lust of gain, might seize this wealth that I have
stored, and put it to their uses; behold, thou Unborn One, who in
the fulness of time shalt stand above me and read this that I
have caused to be written, I have stored the treasure
thus&mdash;even among my bones. Therefore, O thou Unborn One,
sleeping in the womb of Nout, I say this to thee! If thou indeed
hast need of riches to save Khem from the foes of Khem, fear not
and delay not, but tear me, the Osirian, from my tomb, loose my
wrappings and rip the treasure from my breast, and all shall be
well with thee; for this only I do command, that thou dost
replace my bones within my hollow coffin. But if the need be
passing and not great, or if there be guile in thy heart, then
the curse of Menkau-ra be on thee! On thee be the curse that
shall smite him who breaks in upon the dead! On thee be the curse
that follows the traitor! On thee be the curse that smites him
who outrages the Majesty of the Gods! Unhappy shalt thou live, in
blood and misery shalt thou die, and in misery shalt thou be
tormented for ever and for ever! For, Wicked One, there in Amenti
we shall come face to face!</i></p>

<p><i>"And to the end of the keeping of this secret, I, Menkau-ra, have set up a Temple of my Worship, which I have built upon the eastern side of this my House of Death. It shall be made known from time to time to the Hereditary High Priest of this my
Temple. And if any High Priest that shall be do reveal this
secret to another than the Pharaoh, or Her who wears the
Pharaoh's crown and is seated upon the throne of Khem, accursed
be he also. Thus have I, Menkau-ra, the Osirian, written. Now to
thee, who, sleeping in the womb of Nout, yet shall upon a time
stand over me and read, I say, judge thou! and if thou judgest
evilly, on thee shall fall this the curse of Menkau-ra from which
there is no escape. Greeting and farewell."</i></p>

<p><br>
"Thou hast heard, O Cleopatra," I said solemnly; "now search
thy heart; judge thou, and for thine own sake judge justly."</p>

<p>She bent her head in thought.</p>

<p>"I fear to do this thing," she said presently. "Let us
hence."</p>

<p>"It is well," I said, with a lightening of the heart, and bent
down to lift the wooden lid. For I, too, feared.</p>

<p>"And yet, what said the writing of the Divine Menkau-
ra?&mdash;it was emeralds, was it not? And emeralds are now so
rare and hard to come by. Ever did I love emeralds, and I can
never find them without a flaw."</p>

<p>"It is not a matter of what thou dost love, Cleopatra," I
said; "it is a matter of the need of Khem and of the secret
meaning of thy heart, which thou alone canst know."</p>

<p>"Ay, surely, Harmachis; surely! And is not the need of Egypt
great? There is no gold in the treasury, and how can I defy the
Roman if I have no gold? And have I not sworn to thee that I will
wed thee and defy the Roman; and do I not swear it
again&mdash;yes, even in this solemn hour, with my hand upon dead
Pharaoh's heart? Why, here is that occasion of which the Divine
Menkau-ra dreamed. Thou seest it is so, for else Hat-shepsu or
Rameses or some other Pharaoh had drawn forth the gems. But no;
they left them to come to this hour because the time was not yet
come. Now it must be come, for if I take not the gems the Roman
will surely seize on Egypt, and then there will be no Pharaoh to
whom the secret may be told. Nay, let us away with fears and to
the work. Why dost look so frightened? Having pure hearts, there
is naught to fear, Harmachis."</p>

<p>"Even as thou wilt," I said again; "it is for thee to judge,
since if thou judgest falsely on thee will surely fall the curse
from which there is no escape."</p>

<p>"So, Harmachis, take Pharaoh's head and I will take
his&mdash;Oh, what an awful place is this!" and suddenly she
clung to me. "Methought I saw a shadow yonder in the darkness!
Methought that it moved toward us and then straightway vanished!
Let us be going! Didst thou see naught?"</p>

<p>"I saw nothing, Cleopatra; but mayhap it was the Spirit of the
Divine Menkau-ra, for the spirit ever hovers round its mortal
tenement. Let us, then, be going; I shall be right glad to
go."</p>

<p>She made as though to start, then turned back again and spoke
once more.</p>

<p>"It was naught&mdash;naught but the mind that, in such a house
of Horror, bodies forth those shadowy forms of fear it dreads to
see. Nay, I must look upon these emeralds; indeed, if I die, I
must look! Come&mdash;to the work!" and stooping, she with her
own hands lifted from the tomb one of the four alabaster jars,
each sealed with the graven likeness of the heads of the
protecting Gods, that held the holy heart and entrails of the
Divine Menkau-ra. But nothing was found in these jars, save only
what should be there.</p>

<p>Then together we mounted on the Sphinx, and with toil drew
forth the body of the Divine Pharaoh, laying it on the ground.
Now Cleopatra took my dagger, and with it cut loose the bandages
which held the wrappings in their place, and the lotus-flowers
that had been set in them by loving hands, three thousand years
before, fell down upon the pavement. Then we searched and found
the end of the outer bandage, which was fixed in at the hinder
part of the neck. This we cut loose, for it was glued fast. This
done, we began to unroll the wrappings of the holy corpse.
Setting my shoulders against the sarcophagus, I sat upon the
rocky floor, the body resting on my knees, and, as I turned it,
Cleopatra unwound the cloths; and awesome was the task. Presently
something fell out; it was the sceptre of the Pharaoh, fashioned
of gold, and at its end was a pomegranate cut from a single
emerald.</p>

<p>Cleopatra seized the sceptre and gazed on it in silence. Then
once more we went on with our dread business. And ever as we
unwound, other ornaments of gold, such as are buried with
Pharaohs, fell from the wrappings&mdash; collars and bracelets,
models of sistra, an inlaid axe, and an image of the holy Osiris
and of the holy Khem. At length all the bandages were unwound,
and beneath we found a covering of coarsest linen; for in those
very ancient days the craftsmen were not so skilled in matters
pertaining to the embalming of the body as they are now. And on
the linen was written in an oval, "Menkau-ra, Royal Son of the
Sun." We could in no wise loosen this linen, it held so firm on
to the body. Therefore, faint with the great heat, choked with
mummy dust and the odour of spices, and trembling with fear of
our unholy task, wrought in that most lonesome and holy place, we
laid the body down, and ripped away the last covering with the
knife. First we cleared Pharaoh's head, and now the face that no
man had gazed on for three thousand years was open to our view.
It was a great face, with a bold brow, yet crowned with the royal
uraeus, beneath which the white locks, stained yellow by the
spices, fell in long, straight wisps. Not the cold stamp of
death, and not the slow flight of three thousand years, had found
power to mar the dignity of those shrunken features. We gazed on
them, and then, made bold with fear, stripped the covering from
the body. There at last it lay before us, stiff, yellow, and
dread to see; and on the left side, above the thigh, was the cut
through which the embalmers had done their work, but it was sewn
up so deftly that we could scarcely find the mark.</p>

<p>"The gems are within," I whispered, for I felt that the body
was very heavy. "Now, if thy heart fail thee not, thou must make
an entry to this poor house of clay that once was Pharaoh," and I
gave her the dagger&mdash;the same dagger which had drunk the
life of Paulus.</p>

<p>"It is too late to doubt," she answered, lifting her white
beauteous face and fixing her blue eyes all big with terror upon
my own. She took the dagger, and with set teeth the Queen of this
day plunged it into the dead breast of the Pharaoh of three
thousand years ago. And even as she did so there came a groaning
sound from the opening to the shaft where we had left the eunuch!
We leapt to our feet, but heard no more, and the lamp-light still
streamed down through the opening.</p><br>

<br>



<p>"It is nothing," I said. "Let us make an end."</p>

<p>Then with much toil we hacked and rent the hard flesh open,
and as we did so I heard the knife point grate upon the gems
within.</p>

<p>Cleopatra plunged her hand into the dead breast and drew forth
somewhat. She held it to the light, and gave a little cry, for
from the darkness of Pharaoh's heart there flashed into light and
life the most beauteous emerald that ever man beheld. It was
perfect in colour, very large, without a flaw, and fashioned to a
scarabaeus form, and on the under side was an oval, inscribed
with the divine name of Menkau-ra, Son of the Sun.</p>

<br>

alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"She held it to the light, and gave a little cry."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Again, again, and yet again, she plunged in her hand and drew
emeralds from Pharaoh's breast bedded there in spices. Some were
fashioned and some were not; but all were perfect in colour
without a flaw, and in value priceless. Again and again she
plunged her white hand into that dread breast, till at length all
were found, and there were one hundred and forty and eight of
such gems as are not known in the world. The last time that she
searched she brought forth not emeralds, indeed, but two great
pearls, wrapped in linen, such as never have been seen. And of
these pearls more hereafter.</p>

<p>So it was done, and all the mighty treasure lay glittering in
a heap before us. There it lay, and there, too, lay the regalia
of gold, the spiced and sickly-scented wrappings, and the torn
body of white-haired Pharaoh Menkau- ra, the Osirian, the ever
living in Amenti.</p>

<p>We rose, and a great awe fell upon us, now that the deed was
done and our hearts were no more upborne by the rage of
search&mdash;so great an awe, indeed, that we could not speak. I
made a sign to Cleopatra. She grasped the head of Pharaoh and I
grasped his feet, and together we lifted him, climbed the Sphinx,
and placed him once more within his coffin. I piled the torn
mummy cloths over him and on them laid the lid of the coffin.</p>

<p>And now we gathered up the great gems, and such of the
ornaments as might be carried with ease, and I hid them as many
as I could, in the folds of my robe. Those that were left
Cleopatra hid upon her breast. Heavily laden with the priceless
treasure, we gave one last look at the solemn place, at the
sarcophagus and the Sphinx on which it rested, whose gleaming
face of calm seemed to mock us with its everlasting smile of
wisdom. Then we turned and went from the tomb.</p>

<p>At the shaft we halted. I called to the eunuch, who stayed
above, and methought a faint mocking laugh answered me. Too
smitten with terror to call again, and fearing that, should we
delay, Cleopatra would certainly swoon, I seized the rope, and
being strong and quick mounted by it and gained the passage.
There burnt the lamp: but the eunuch I saw not. Thinking, surely,
that he was a little way down the passage, and slept&mdash;as, in
truth, he did &mdash;I bade Cleopatra make the rope fast about
her middle, and with much labour, drew her up. Then, having
rested awhile, we moved with the lamps to seek for the
eunuch.</p>

<p>"He was stricken with terror and has fled, leaving the lamp,"
said Cleopatra. "O ye Gods! who is <i>that</i> seated there?"</p>

<p>I peered into the darkness, thrusting out the lamps, and this
was what their light fell on&mdash;this at the very dream of
which my soul sickens! There, facing us, his back resting against
the rock, and his hands splayed on either side upon the floor,
sat the eunuch&mdash;<i>dead!</i> His eyes and mouth were open,
his fat cheeks dropped down, his thin hair yet seemed to bristle,
and on his countenance was frozen such a stamp of hideous terror
as well might turn the beholder's brain. And lo! fixed to his
chin, by its hinder claws, hung that grey and mighty bat, which,
flying forth when we entered the pyramid, vanished in the sky,
but, returning, had followed us to its depths. There it hung upon
the dead man's chin slowly rocking itself to and fro, and we
could see the fiery eyes shining in its head.</p>

<p>Aghast, utterly aghast, we stood and stared at the hateful
sight; till presently the bat spread his huge wings and, losing
his hold, sailed to us. Now he hovered before Cleopatra's face,
fanning her with his white wings. Then with a scream, like a
woman's shriek of fury, the accursed Thing flittered on, seeking
his violated tomb, and vanished down the well into the sepulchre.
I fell against the wall. But Cleopatra sank in a heap upon the
floor, and, covering her head with her arms, she shrieked till
the hollow passages rang with the echoes of her cries, that
seemed to grow and double and rush along the depths in volumes of
shrill sound.</p>

<p>"Rise!" I cried, "rise and let us hence before the Spirit
shall return to haunt us! If thou dost suffer thyself to be
overwhelmed in this place thou art lost for ever."</p>

<p>She staggered to her feet, and never may I forget the look
upon her ashy face or in her glowing eyes. Seizing lamps with a
rush, we passed the dead eunuch's horrid form, I holding her by
the hand. We gained the great chamber, where was the sarcophagus
of the Queen of Menkau-ra, and traversed its length. We fled
along the passage. What if the Thing had closed the three mighty
doors? No; they were open, and we sped through them; the last
only did I stay to close. I touched the stone, as I knew how, and
the great door crashed down, shutting us off from the presence of
the dead eunuch and the Horror that had hung upon the eunuch's
chin. Now we were in the white chamber with the sculptured
panels, and now we faced the last steep ascent. Oh that last
ascent! Twice Cleopatra slipped and fell upon the polished floor.
The second time &mdash;it was when half the distance had been
done&mdash;she let fall her lamp, and would, indeed, have rolled
down the slide had I not saved her. But in doing thus I, too, let
fall my lamp that bounded away into shadow beneath us, and we
were in utter darkness. And perchance about us, in the darkness,
hovered that awful Thing!</p>

<p>"Be brave!" I cried; "O love, be brave, and struggle on, or
both are lost! The way, though steep, is not far; and, though it
be dark, we can scarce come to harm in this straight shaft. If
the gems weight thee, cast them away!"</p>

<p>"Nay," she gasped, "that I will not; this shall not be endured
to no end. I die with them!"</p>

<p>Then it was that I saw the greatness of this woman's heart;
for in the dark, and notwithstanding the terrors we had passed
and the awfulness of our state, she clung to me and clambered on
up that dread passage. On we clambered, hand in hand, with
bursting hearts, till there, by the mercy or the anger of the
Gods, at length we saw the faint light of the moon, creeping
through the little opening in the pyramid. One struggle more, now
the hole was gained, and like a breath from heaven, the sweet
night air played upon our brows. I climbed through, and, standing
on a pile of stones, lifted and dragged Cleopatra after me. She
fell to the ground and then sank down upon it motionless.</p>

<p>I pressed upon the turning stone with trembling hands. It
swung to and caught, leaving no mark of the secret place of
entry. Then I leapt down and, having pushed away the pile of
stones, looked on Cleopatra. She had swooned, and notwithstanding
the dust and grime upon her face, it was so pale that at first I
believed she must be dead. But placing my hand upon her heart I
felt it stir beneath; and, being spent, I flung myself down
beside her upon the sand, to gather up my strength again.</p>

Of The Coming Back Of Harmachis,<br>

<p class="first">RESENTLY I lifted myself, and, laying the head
of Egypt's Queen upon my knee, strove to call her back to life.
How fair she seemed, even in her disarray, her long hair
streaming down her breast! how deadly fair she seemed in the
faint light&mdash;this woman the story of whose beauty and whose
sin shall outlive the solid mass of the mighty pyramid that
towered over us! The heaviness of her swoon had smoothed away the
falseness of her face, and nothing was left but the divine stamp
of Woman's richest loveliness, softened by shadows of the night
and dignified by the cast of deathlike sleep. I gazed upon her
and all my heart went out to her; it seemed that I did but love
her more because of the depth of the treasons to which I had sunk
to reach her, and because of the terrors we had outfaced
together. Weary and spent with fears and the pangs of guilt, my
heart sought hers for rest, for now she alone was left to me. She
had sworn to wed me also, and with the treasure we had won we
would make Egypt strong and free her from her foes, and all
should yet be well. Ah! could I have seen the picture that was to
come, how, and in what place and circumstance, once again this
very woman's head should be laid upon my knee, pale with that
cast of death! Ah! could I have seen!</p>

<p>I chafed her hand between my hands. I bent down and kissed her
on the lips, and at my kiss she woke. She woke with a little sob
of fear&mdash;a shiver ran along her delicate limbs, and she
stared upon my face with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is thou!" she said. "I mind me&mdash;thou hast saved
me from that horror-haunted place!" And she threw her arms about
my neck, drew me to her and kissed me. "Come, love," she said,
"let us be going! I am sore athirst, and&mdash;ah! so very weary!
The gems, too, chafe my breast! Never was wealth so hardly won!
Come, let us be going from the shadow of this ghostly spot! See
the faint lights glancing from the wings of Dawn. How beautiful
they are, and how sweet to behold! Never, in those Halls of
Eternal Night, did I think to look upon the blush of dawn again!
Ah! I can still see the face of that dead slave, with the Horror
hanging to his beardless chin! Bethink thee! &mdash;there he'll
sit for ever&mdash;there&mdash;with the Horror! Come; where may
we find water? I would give an emerald for a cup of water!"</p>

<p>"At the canal on the borders of the tilled land below the
Temple of Horemkhu&mdash;it is close by," I answered. "If any see
us, we will say that we are pilgrims who have lost our way at
night among the tombs. Veil thyself closely, therefore,
Cleopatra; and beware lest thou dost show aught of those gems
about thee."</p>

<p>So she veiled herself, and I lifted her on to the ass which
was tethered near at hand. We walked slowly through the plain
till we came to the place where the symbol of the God Horemkhu
(17), fashioned as a mighty Sphinx (whom the Greeks call
Harmachis), and crowned with the royal crown of Egypt, looks out
in majesty across the land, his eyes ever fixed upon the East. As
we walked the first arrow of the rising sun quivered through the
grey air, striking upon Horemkhu's lips of holy calm, and the
Dawn kissed her greeting to the God of Dawn. Then the light
gathered and grew upon the gleaming sides of twenty pyramids,
and, like a promise from Life to Death, rested on the portals of
ten thousand tombs. It poured in a flood of gold across the
desert sand&mdash;it pierced the heavy sky of night, and fell in
bright beams upon the green of fields and the tufted crest of
palms. Then from his horizon bed royal Ra rose up in pomp and it
was day.</p>

<p class="footnote">17. That is, "Horus on the horizon"; and
signifies the power of Light and Good overcoming the power of
Darkness and Evil incarnate in his enemy, Typhon.
&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>Passing the temple of granite and of alabaster that was built
before the days of Khufu, to the glory of the Majesty of
Horemkhu, we descended the slope, and came to the banks of the
canal. There we drank; and that draught of muddy water was
sweeter than all the choicest wine of Alexandria. Also we washed
the mummy dust and grime from our hands and brows and made us
clean. As she bathed her neck, stooping over the water, one of
the great emeralds slipped from Cleopatra's breast and fell into
the canal, and it was but by chance that at length I found it in
the mire. Then, once more, I lifted Cleopatra onto the beast, and
slowly, for I was very weary, we marched back to the banks of
Sihor, where our craft was. And having at length come thither,
seeing no one save some few peasants going out to labour on the
lands, I turned the ass loose in that same field where we had
found him, and we boarded the craft while the crew were yet
sleeping. Then, waking them, we bade them make all sail, saying
that we had left the eunuch to sojourn a while behind us, as in
truth we had. So we sailed, having first hidden away the gems and
such of the ornaments of gold as we could bring to the boat.</p>

<p>We spent four days and more in coming to Alexandria, for the
wind was for the most part against us; and they were happy days!
At first, indeed, Cleopatra was somewhat silent and heavy at
heart, for what she had seen and felt in the womb of the pyramid
weighed her down. But soon her Imperial spirit awoke and shook
the burden from her breast, and she became herself
again&mdash;now gay, now learned; now loving, and now cold; now
queenly, and now altogether simple&mdash;ever changing as the
winds of heaven, and as the heaven, deep, beauteous, and
unsearchable!</p>

<p>Night after night for those four perfect nights, the last
happy hours I ever was to know, we sat hand in hand upon the deck
and heard the waters lap the vessel's side, and watched the soft
footfall of the moon as she trod the depths of Nile. There we sat
and talked of love, talked of our marriage and all that we would
do. Also I drew up plans of war and of defence against the Roman,
which now we had the means to carry out; and she approved them,
sweetly saying that what seemed good to me was good to her. And
so the time passed all too swiftly.</p>

<p>Oh those nights upon the Nile! their memory haunts me yet! Yet
in my dreams I see the moonbeams break and quiver, and hear
Cleopatra's murmured words of love mingle with the sound of
murmuring waters. Dead are those dear nights, dead is the moon
that lit them; the waters which rocked us on their breast are
lost in the wide salt sea, and where we kissed and clung there
lips unborn shall kiss and cling! How beautiful was their
promise, doomed, like an unfruitful blossom, to wither, fall, and
rot! and their fulfilment, ah, how drear! For all things end in
darkness and in ashes, and those who sow in folly shall reap in
sorrow. Ah! those nights upon the Nile!</p>

<p class="caption">"Oh those nights upon the Nile!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And so at length once more we stood within the hateful walls
of that fair palace on the Lochias, and the dream was done.</p>

<p>"Whither hast thou wandered with Cleopatra, Harmachis?"
Charmion asked of me when I met her by chance on that day of
return. "On some new mission of betrayal? Or was it but a love-
journey?"</p>

<p>"I went with Cleopatra upon secret business of the State," I
answered sternly.</p>

<p>"So! Those who go secretly, go evilly; and foul birds love to
fly at night. Not but what thou art wise, for it would scarce
beseem thee, Harmachis, to show thy face openly in Egypt."</p>

<p>I heard, and felt my passion rise within me, for I could ill
bear this fair girl's scorn.</p>

<p>"Hast thou never a word without a sting?" I asked. "Know,
then, that I went whither thou hadst not dared to go, to gather
means to hold Egypt from the grasp of Antony."</p>

<p>"So," she answered, looking up swiftly. "Thou foolish man!
Thou hadst done better to save thy labour, for Antony will grasp
Egypt in thy despite. What power hast thou to-day in Egypt?"</p>

<p>"That he may do in my despite; but in despite of Cleopatra
that he cannot do," I said.</p>

<p>"Nay, but with the <i>aid</i> of Cleopatra he can and will do
it," she answered with a bitter smile. "When the Queen sails in
state up Cydnus stream she will surely draw this coarse Antony
thence to Alexandria, conquering, and yet, like thee, a
slave!"</p>

<p>"It is false! I say that it is false! Cleopatra goes not to
Tarsus, and Antony comes not to Alexandria; or, if he come, it
will be to take the chance of war."</p>

<p>"Now, thinkest thou thus?" she answered with a little laugh.
"Well, if it please thee, think as thou wilt. Within three days
thou shalt know. It is pretty to see how easily thou art fooled.
Farewell! Go, dream on Love, for surely Love is sweet."</p>

<p>And she went, leaving me angered and troubled at heart.</p>

<p>I saw Cleopatra no more that day, but on the day which
followed I saw her. She was in a heavy mood, and had no gentle
word for me. I spake to her of the defence of Egypt, but she put
the matter away.</p>

<p>"Why dost thou weary me?" she said with anger; "canst thou not
see that I am lost in troubles? When Dellius has had his answer
to-morrow then we will speak of these matters."</p>

<p>"Ay," I said, "when Dellius has had his answer; and knowest
thou that but yesterday, Charmion&mdash;whom about the palace
they name the 'Keeper of the Queen's secrets'&mdash;Charmion
swore that the answer would be 'Go in peace, I come to
Antony!'"</p>

<p>"Charmion knows nothing of my heart," said Cleopatra, stamping
her foot in anger, "and if she talk so freely the girl shall be
scourged out of my Court, as is her desert. Though, in truth,"
she added, "she has more wisdom in that small head of hers than
all my privy councillors&mdash;ay, and more wit to use it.
Knowest thou that I have sold a portion of those gems to the rich
Jews of Alexandria, and at a great price, ay, at five thousand
sestertia (18) for each one? But a few, in truth, for they could
not buy more as yet. It was rare to see their eyes when they fell
upon them: they grew large as apples with avarice and wonder. And
now leave me, Harmachis, for I am weary. The memory of that
dreadful night is with me yet."</p>

<p class="footnote">18. About forty thousand pounds of our money. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>I bowed and rose to go, and yet stood wavering.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Cleopatra; it is of our marriage."</p>

<p>"Our marriage! Why, are we not indeed already wed?" she
answered.</p>

<p>"Yes; but not before the world. Thou didst promise."</p>

<p>"Ay, Harmachis, I promised; and to-morrow, when I have rid me
of this Dellius, I will keep my promise, and name thee
Cleopatra's Lord before the Court. See that thou art in thy
place. Art content?"</p>

<p>And she stretched out her hand for me to kiss, looking on me
with strange eyes, as though she struggled with herself. Then I
went; but that night I strove once more to see Cleopatra, and
could not. "The Lady Charmion was with the Queen," so said the
eunuchs, and none might enter.</p>

<p>On the morrow the Court met in the great hall one hour before
mid-day, and I went thither with a trembling heart to hear
Cleopatra's answer to Dellius, and to hear myself also named
King-consort to the Queen of Egypt. It was a full and splendid
Court; there were councillors, lords, captains, eunuchs, and
waiting-women, all save Charmion. The house passed, but Cleopatra
and Charmion came not. At length Charmion entered gently by a
side entrance, and took her place among the waiting-ladies about
the throne. Even as she did so she cast a glance at me, and there
was triumph in her eyes, though I knew not over what she
triumphed. I little guessed that she had but now brought about my
ruin and sealed the fate of Egypt.</p>

<p>Then presently the trumpets blared, and, clad in her robes of
state, the uraeus crown upon her head, and on her breast,
flashing like a star, that great emerald scarabaeus which she had
dragged from dead Pharaoh's heart, Cleopatra swept in splendour
to her throne, followed by a glittering guard of Northmen. Her
lovely face was dark, dark were her slumbrous eyes, and none
might read their message, though all that Court searched them for
a sign of what should come. She seated herself slowly as one who
may not be moved, and spoke to the chief of the heralds in the
Greek tongue:</p>

<p>"Does the Ambassador of the noble Antony wait?"</p>

<p>The herald bowed low and made assent.</p>

<p>"Let him come in and hear our answer."</p>

<p>The doors were flung wide, and, followed by his train of
knights, Dellius, clad in his golden armour and his purple
mantle, walked with cat-like step up the great hall, and made
obeisance before the throne.</p>

<p>"Most royal and beauteous Egypt," he said, in his soft voice,
"as thou hast graciously been pleased to bid me, thy servant, I
am here to take thy answer to the letter of the noble Antony the
Triumvir, whom to-morrow I sail to meet at Tarsus, in Cilicia.
And I will say this, royal Egypt, craving pardon the while for
the boldness of my speech&mdash;bethink thee well before words
that cannot be unspoken fall from those sweet lips. Defy Antony,
and Antony will wreck thee. But, like thy mother Aphrodité, rise
glorious on his sight from the bosom of the Cyprian wave, and for
wreck he will give thee all that can be dear to woman's
royalty&mdash;Empire, and pomp of place, cities and the sway of
men, fame and wealth, and the Diadem of rule made sure. For mark:
Antony holds this Eastern World in the hollow of his warlike
hand; at his will kings are, and at his frown they cease to
be."</p>

<p>And he bowed his head and, folding his hands meekly on his
breast, awaited answer.</p>

<p>For a while Cleopatra answered not, but sat like the Sphinx
Horemkhu, dumb and inscrutable, gazing with lost eyes down the
length of that great hall.</p>

<p>Then, like soft music, her answer came; and trembling I
listened for Egypt's challenge to the Roman:</p>

<p>"Noble Dellius,&mdash;We have bethought us much of the matter
of thy message from great Antony to our poor Royalty of Egypt. We
have bethought us much, and we have taken counsel from the
oracles of the Gods, from the wisest among our friends, and from
the teachings of our heart, that ever, like a nesting bird,
broods over our people's weal. Sharp are the words that thou has
brought across the sea; methinks they had been better fitted to
the ears of some petty half-tamed prince than to those of Egypt's
Queen. Therefore we have numbered the legions that we can gather,
and the triremes and the galleys wherewith we may breast the sea,
and the moneys which shall buy us all things wanting to our war.
And we find this, that, though Antony be strong, yet has Egypt
naught to fear from the strength of Antony."</p>

<p>She paused, and a murmur of applause of her high words ran
down the hall. Only Dellius stretched out his hand as though to
push them back. Then came the end!</p>

<p>"Noble Dellius,&mdash;Half are we minded there to bid our
tongue stop, and, strong in our fortresses of stone, and our
other fortresses built of the hearts of men, abide the issue. And
yet thou shalt not go thus. We are guiltless of those charges
against us that have come to the ears of noble Antony, and which
now he rudely shouts in ours; nor will we journey into Cilicia to
answer them."</p>

<p>Here the murmur arose anew, while my heart beat high in
triumph; and in the pause that followed, Dellius spoke once
more.</p>

<p>"Then, royal Egypt, my word to Antony is word of War?"</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered; "it shall be one of Peace. Listen; we
said that we would not come to make answer to these charges, nor
will we. But"&mdash;and she smiled for the first time&mdash;"we
will gladly come, and that swiftly, in royal friendship to make
known our fellowship of peace upon the banks of Cydnus."</p>

<p>I heard, and was bewildered. Could I hear aright? Was it thus
that Cleopatra kept her oaths? Moved beyond the hold of reason, I
lifted up my voice and cried:</p>

<p>"O Queen, <i>remember!</i>"</p>

<p>She turned upon me like a lioness, with a flashing of the eyes
and a swift shake of her lovely head.</p>

<p>"Peace, Slave!" she said; "who bade thee break in upon our
counsels? Mind thou thy stars, and leave matters of the world to
the rulers of the world!"</p>

<p>I sank back shamed, and, as I did so, once more I saw the
smile of triumph on the face of Charmion, followed by what was,
perhaps, the shadow of pity for my fall.</p>

<p>"Now that yon brawling charlatan," said Dellius, pointing at
me with his jewelled finger, "has been rebuked, grant me leave, O
Egypt, to thank thee from my heart for these gentle
words&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We ask no thanks from thee, noble Dellius; nor lies it in thy
mouth to chide our servant," broke in Cleopatra, frowning
heavily; "we will take thanks from the lips of Antony alone. Get
thee to thy master, and say to him that before he can make ready
a fitting welcome our keels shall follow in the track of thine.
And now, farewell! Thou shalt find some small token of our bounty
upon thy vessel."</p>

<p>Dellius bowed thrice and withdrew, while the Court stood
waiting the Queen's word. And I, too, waited, wondering if she
would yet make good her promise, and name me royal Spouse there
in the face of Egypt. But she said nothing. Only, still frowning
heavily, she rose, and, followed by her guards, left the throne,
and passed into the Alabaster Hall. Then the Court broke up, and
as the lords and councillors went by they looked on me with
mockery. For though none knew all my secret, nor how it stood
between me and Cleopatra, yet they were jealous of the favour
shown me by the Queen, and rejoiced greatly at my fall. But I
took no heed of their mocking as I stood dazed with misery and
felt the world of Hope slip from beneath my feet.</p>

<p class="first">ND at length, all being gone, I, too, turned to
go, when a eunuch struck me on the shoulder and roughly bade me
wait on the presence of the Queen. An hour past this fellow would
have crawled to me on his knees; but he had heard, and now he
treated me&mdash;so brutish is the nature of such slaves&mdash;
as the world treats the fallen, with scorn. For to come low after
being great is to learn all shame. Unhappy, therefore, are the
Great, for they may fall!</p>

<p>I turned upon the slave with so fierce a word that, cur-like,
he sprang behind me; then I passed on to the Alabaster Hall, and
was admitted by the guards. In the centre of the hall, near the
fountain, sat Cleopatra, and with her were Charmion and the Greek
girl Iras, and Merira and other of her waiting- ladies. "Go," she
said to these, "I would speak with my astrologer." So they went,
and left us face to face.</p>

<p>"Stand thou there," she said, lifting her eyes for the first
time. "Come not nigh me, Harmachis: I trust thee not. Perchance
thou hast found another dagger. Now, what hast thou to say? By
what right didst thou dare to break in upon my talk with the
Roman?"</p>

<p>I felt the blood rush through me like a storm; bitterness and
burning anger took hold of my heart. "What hast <i>thou</i> to
say, Cleopatra?" I answered boldly. "Where is thy vow, sworn on
the dead heart of Menkau-ra, the ever-living? Where now thy
challenge to this Roman Antony? Where thy oath that thou wouldest
call me 'husband' in the face of Egypt?" and I choked and
ceased.</p>

<p>"Well doth it become Harmachis, who never was forsworn, to
speak to me of oaths!" she said in bitter mockery. "And yet, O
thou most pure Priest of Isis; and yet, O thou most faithful
friend, who never didst betray thy friends; and yet, O thou most
steadfast, honourable, and upright man, who never bartered thy
birthright, thy country, and thy cause for the price of a woman's
passing love &mdash;by what token knowest thou that my word is
void?"</p>

<p>"I will not answer thy taunts, Cleopatra," I said, holding
back my heart as best I might, "for I have earned them all,
though not from thee. By this token, then, I know it. Thou goest
to visit Antony; thou goest, as said that Roman knave, 'tricked
in thy best attire,' to feast with him whom thou shouldst give to
vultures for their feast. Perhaps, for aught I know, thou art
about to squander those treasures that thou hast filched from the
body of Menkau-ra, those treasures stored against the need of
Egypt, upon wanton revels which shall complete the shame of
Egypt. By these things, then, I know that thou art forsworn, and
I, who, loving thee, believed thee, tricked; and by this, also,
that thou who didst but yesternight swear to wed me, dost to-day
cover me with taunts, and even before that Roman put me to an
open shame!"</p>

<p>"To wed thee? and I did swear to wed thee? Well, and what is
marriage? Is it the union of the heart, that bond beautiful as
gossamer and than gossamer more light, which binds soul to soul,
as they float through the dreamy night of passion, a bond to be,
perchance, melted in the dews of dawn? Or is it the iron link of
enforced, unchanging union whereby if sinks the one the other
must be dragged beneath the sea of circumstance, there, like a
punished slave, to perish of unavoidable corruption (19)?
Marriage! <i>I</i> to marry! <i>I</i> to forget freedom and court
the worst slavery of our sex, which, by the selfish will of man,
the stronger, still binds us to a bed grown hateful, and enforces
a service that love mayhap no longer hallows! Of what use, then,
to be a Queen, if thereby I may not escape the evil of the meanly
born? Mark thou, Harmachis: Woman being grown hath two ills to
fear &mdash;Death and Marriage; and of these twain is Marriage
the more vile; for in Death we may find rest, but in Marriage,
should it fail us, we must find hell. Nay, being above the breath
of common slander that enviously would blast those who of true
virtue will not consent to stretch affection's links, I
<i>love</i>, Harmachis; but I <i>marry</i> not!"</p>

<p class="footnote">19. Referring to the Roman custom of chaining a living felon to the body of one already dead. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"And yesternight, Cleopatra, thou didst swear that thou
wouldst wed me, and call me to thy side before the face of
Egypt!"</p>

<p>"And yesternight, Harmachis, the red ring round the moon
marked the coming of the storm, and yet the day is fair! But who
knows that the tempest may not break to-morrow? Who knows that I
have not chosen the easier path to save Egypt from the Roman? Who
knows, Harmachis, that thou shalt not still call me wife?"</p>

<p>Then I no longer could bear her falsehood, for I saw that she
but played with me. And so I spoke that which was in my
heart:</p>

<p>"Cleopatra!" I cried," thou didst swear to protect Egypt, and
thou art about to betray Egypt to the Roman! Thou didst swear to
use the treasures that I revealed to thee for the service of
Egypt, and thou art about to use them to be her means of
shame&mdash;to fashion them as fetters for her wrists! Thou didst
swear to wed me, who loved thee, and for thee gave all, and thou
dost mock me and reject me! Therefore I say&mdash;with the voice
of the dread Gods I say it!&mdash;that on <i>thee</i>shall fall
the curse of Menkau-ra, whom thou hast robbed indeed! Let me go
hence and work out my fate! Let me go, O thou fair Shame! thou
living Lie! whom I have loved to my doom, and who hast brought
upon me the last curse of doom! Let me hide myself and see thy
face no more!"</p>

<p>She rose in her wrath, and she was terrible to see.</p>

<p>"Let thee go to stir up evil against me! Nay, Harmachis, thou
shalt not go to build new plots against my throne! I say to thee
that thou, too, shalt come to visit Antony in Cilicia, and there,
perchance, I will let thee go!" And ere I could answer, she had
struck upon the silver gong that hung near her.</p>

<p>Before its rich echo had died away, Charmion and the waiting-
women entered from one door, and from the other, a file of
soldiers&mdash;four of them of the Queen's bodyguard, mighty men,
with winged helmets and long fair hair.</p>

<p>"Seize that traitor!" cried Cleopatra, pointing to me. The
captain of the guard&mdash;it was Brennus&mdash;saluted and came
towards me with drawn sword.</p>

<p>But I, being mad and desperate, and caring little if they slew
me, flew straight at his throat, and dealt him such a heavy blow
that the great man fell headlong, and his armour clashed upon the
marble floor. As he fell I seized his sword and targe, and,
meeting the next, who rushed on me with a shout, caught his blow
upon the shield, and in answer smote with all my strength. The
sword fell where the neck is set into the shoulder, and, shearing
through the joints of his harness, slew him, so that his knees
were loosened and he sank down dead. And the third, as he came, I
caught upon the point of my sword before he could strike, and it
pierced him and he died. Then the last rushed on me with a cry of
"Taranis!" and I, too, rushed on him, for my blood was aflame.
Now the women shrieked&mdash;only Cleopatra said nothing, but
stood and watched the unequal fray. We met, and I struck with all
my strength, and it was a mighty blow, for the sword shore
through the iron shell and shattered there, leaving me
weaponless. With a shout of triumph the guard swung up his sword
and smote down upon my head, but I caught the blow with my
shield. Again he smote, and again I parried; but when he raised
his sword a third time I saw this might not endure, so with a cry
I hurled my buckler at his face. Glancing from his shield it
struck him on the breast and staggered him. Then, before he could
gain his balance, I rushed in beneath his guard and gripped him
round the middle.</p>

<p>For a full minute the tall man and I struggled furiously, and
then, so great was my strength in those days, I lifted him like a
toy and dashed him down upon the marble floor in such fashion
that his bones were shattered so that he spoke no more. But I
could not save myself and fell upon him, and as I fell the
Captain Brennus, whom I had smitten to earth with my fist, having
once more found his sense, came up behind me and smote me upon
the head and shoulders with the sword of one of those whom I had
slain. But I being on the ground, the blow did not fall with all
its weight, also my thick hair and broidered cap broke its force;
and thus it came to pass that, though sorely wounded, the life
was yet whole in me. But I could struggle no more.</p>

<p class="caption">"I dashed him down."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then the cowardly eunuchs, who had gathered at the sound of
blows and stood huddled together like a herd of cattle, seeing
that I was spent, threw themselves upon me, and would have
butchered me with their knives. But Brennus, now that I was down,
would strike no more, but stood waiting. And the eunuchs had
surely slain me, for Cleopatra watched like one who watches in a
dream and made no sign. Already my head was dragged back, and
their knife-points were at my throat, when Charmion, rushing
forward, threw herself upon me and, calling them "Dogs!"
desperately thrust her body before them in such fashion that they
could not smite. Now Brennus with an oath seized first one and
then another and cast them from me.</p>

<p>"Spare his life, Queen!" he cried in his barbarous Latin. "By
Jupiter, he is a brave man! Myself felled like an ox in the
shambles, and three of my boys finished by a man without armour
and taken unawares! I grudge them not to such a man! A boon,
Queen! spare his life, and give him to me!"</p>

<p>"Ay, spare him! spare him!" cried Charmion, white and
trembling.</p>

<p>Cleopatra drew near and looked upon the dead and him who lay
dying as I had dashed him to the ground, and on me, her lover of
two days gone, whose wounded head rested now on Charmion's white
robes.</p>

<p>I met the Queen's glance. "Spare not!" I gasped; "<i>vae
victis!</i>" Then a flush gathered on her brow&mdash;methinks it
was a flush of shame!</p>

<p>"Dost after all love this man at heart, Charmion," she said
with a little laugh, "that thou didst thrust thy tender body
between him and the knives of these sexless hounds?" and she cast
a look of scorn upon the eunuchs.</p>

<p>"Nay!" the girl answered fiercely; "but I cannot stand by to
see a brave man murdered by such as these."</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Cleopatra, "he is a brave man, and he fought
gallantly; I have never seen so fierce a fight even in the games
at Rome! Well, I spare his life, though he is weak of
me&mdash;womanish weak. Take him to his own chamber and guard him
there till he is healed or&mdash;dead."</p>

<p>Then my brain reeled, a great sickness seized upon me, and I
sank into the nothingness of a swoon.</p>

<p>Dreams, dreams, dreams! without end and ever-changing, as for
years and years I seemed to toss upon a sea of agony. And through
them a vision of a dark- eyed woman's tender face and the touch
of a white hand soothing me to rest. Visions, too, of a royal
countenance bending at times over my rocking bed &mdash;a
countenance that I could not grasp, but whose beauty flowed
through my fevered veins and was a part of me&mdash;visions of
childhood and of the Temple towers of Abouthis, and of the white-
haired Amenemhat, my father &mdash;ay, and an ever-present vision
of that dread hall in Amenti, and of the small altar and the
Spirits clad in flame! There I seemed to wander everlastingly,
calling on the Holy Mother, whose memory I could not grasp;
calling ever and in vain! For no cloud descended upon the altar,
only from time to time the great Voice pealed aloud: "Strike out
the name of Harmachis, child of Earth, from the living Book of
Her who Was and Is and Shall Be! <i>Lost! lost! lost!</i>"</p>

<p>And then another voice would answer:</p>

<p>"Not yet! not yet! Repentance is at hand; strike not out the
name of Harmachis, child of Earth, from the living Book of Her
who Was and Is and Shall Be! By suffering may sin be wiped
away!"</p>

<p>I woke to find myself in my own chamber in the tower of the
palace. I was so weak that I scarce could lift my hand, and life
seemed but to flutter in my breast as flutters a dying dove. I
could not turn my head; I could not stir; yet in my heart there
was a sense of rest and of dark trouble done. The light from the
lamp hurt my eyes: I shut them, and, as I shut them, heard the
sweep of a woman's robes upon the stair, and a swift, light step
that I knew well. It was that of Cleopatra!</p>

<p>She entered and drew near. I felt her come! Every pulse of my
poor frame beat an answer to her footfall, and all my mighty love
and hate rose from the darkness of my death-like sleep, and rent
me in their struggle! She leaned over me; her ambrosial breath
played upon my face: I could hear the beating of her heart! Lower
she leaned, till at last her lips touched me softly on the
brow.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" I heard her murmur. "Poor, weak, dying Man! Fate
hath been hard to thee! Thou wert too good to be the sport of
such a one as I&mdash; the pawn that I must move in my play of
policy! Ah, Harmachis! thou shouldst have ruled the game! Those
plotting priests could give thee learning; but they could not
give thee knowledge of mankind, nor fence thee against the march
of Nature's law. And thou didst love me with all thy
heart&mdash;ah! well I know it! Manlike, thou didst love the eyes
that, as a pirate's lights, beckoned thee to shipwrecked ruin,
and didst hang doting on the lips which lied thy heart away and
called thee 'slave'! Well; the game was fair, for thou wouldst
have slain me; and yet I grieve. So thou dost die? and this is my
farewell to thee! Never may we meet again on earth; and,
perchance, it is well, for who knows, when my hour of tenderness
is past, how I might deal with thee, didst thou live? Thou dost
die, they say&mdash;those learned long-faced fools, who, if they
let thee die, shall pay the price. And where, then, shall we meet
again when my last throw is thrown? We shall be equal there, in
the kingdom that Osiris rules. A little time, a few
years&mdash;perhaps to-morrow &mdash;and we shall meet; then,
knowing all I am, how wilt thou greet me? Nay, here, as there,
still must thou worship me! for injuries cannot touch the
immortality of such a love as thine. Contempt alone, like acid,
can eat away the love of noble hearts, and reveal the truth in
its pitiful nakedness. Thou must still cling to thee, Harmachis;
for, whatever my sins, yet I am great and set above thy scorn.
Would that I could have loved thee as thou lovest me! Almost I
did so when thou slewest those guards; and yet&mdash;not
quite.</p>

<p>"What a fenced city is my heart, that none can take it, and,
even when I throw the gates wide, no man may win its citadel! Oh,
to put away this loneliness and lose me in another's soul! Oh,
for a year, a month, an hour to quite forget policy, peoples, and
my pomp of place, and be but a loving woman! Harmachis, fare thee
well! Go join great Julius whom thy art called up from death
before me, and take Egypt's greetings to him. Ah well! I fooled
thee, and I fooled Caesar&mdash;perchance before all is done Fate
will find me, and myself I shall be fooled. Harmachis, fare thee
well!"</p>

<p>She turned to go, and as she turned I heard the sweep of
another dress and the light fall of another woman's foot.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is thou, Charmion. Well, for all thy watching the man
dies."</p>

<p>"Ay," she answered, in a voice thick with grief. "Ay, O Queen,
so the physicians say. Forty hours has he lain in stupor so deep
that at times his breath could barely lift this tiny feather's
weight, and hardly could my ear, placed against his breast, take
notice of the rising of his heart. I have watched him now for ten
long days, watched him day and night, till my eyes stare wide
with want of sleep, and for faintness I can scarce keep myself
from falling. And this is the end of all my labour! The coward
blow of that accursed Brennus has done its work, and Harmachis
dies!"</p>

<p>"Love counts not its labour, Charmion, nor can it weight its
tenderness on the scale of purchase. That which it has it gives,
and craves for more to give and give, till the soul's infinity be
drained. Dear to thy heart are these heavy nights of watching;
sweet to thy weary eyes is that sad sight of strength brought so
low that it hangs upon thy weakness like a babe to its mother's
breast! For, Charmion, thou dost love this man who loves thee
not, and now that he is helpless thou canst pour thy passion
forth over the unanswering darkness of his soul, and cheat
thyself with dreams of what yet might be."</p>

<p>"I love him not, as thou hast proof, O Queen! How can I love
one who would have slain thee, who art as my heart's sister? It
is for pity that I nurse him."</p>

<p>She laughed a little as she answered, "Pity is love's own
twin, Charmion. Wondrous wayward are the paths of woman's love,
and thou hast shown thine strangely, that I know. But the more
high the love, the deeper the gulf whereinto it can
fall&mdash;ay, and thence soar again to heaven, once more to
fall! Poor woman! thou art thy passion's plaything: now tender as
the morning sky, and now, when jealousy grips thy heart, more
cruel than the sea. Well, thus are we made. Soon, after all this
troubling, nothing will be left thee but tears, remorse,
and&mdash;memory."</p>

<p>And she went forth.</p>

<p class="first">LEOPATRA went, and for a while I lay silent,
gathering up my strength to speak. But Charmion came and stood
over me, and I felt a great tear fall from her dark eyes upon my
face, as the first heavy drop of rain falls from a thunder
cloud.</p>

<p>"Thou goest," she whispered; "thou goest fast whither I may
not follow! O Harmachis, how gladly would I give my life for
thine!"</p>

<p>Then at length I opened my eyes, and spoke as best I
could:</p>

<p>"Restrain thy grief, dear friend," I said, "I live yet; and,
in truth, I feel as though new life gathered in my breast!"</p>

<p>She gave a little cry of joy, and I never saw aught more
beautiful than the change that came upon her weeping face! It was
as when the first lights of the day run up the pallor of that sad
sky which veils the night from dawn. All rosy grew her lovely
countenance; her dim eyes shone out like stars; and a smile of
wonderment, more sweet than the sudden smile of the sea as its
ripples wake to brightness beneath the kiss of the risen moon,
broke through her rain of tears.</p>

<p>"Thou livest!" she cried, throwing herself on her knees beside
my couch. "Thou livest&mdash;and I thought thee gone! Thou art
come back to me! Oh! what say I? How foolish is a woman's heart!
'Tis this long watching! Nay; sleep and rest thee,
Harmachis!&mdash;why dost thou talk? Not one more word, I command
thee straitly! Where is the draught left by that long-bearded
fool? Nay thou shalt have no draught! There, sleep, Harmachis;
sleep!" and she crouched down at my side and laid her cool hand
upon my brow, murmuring, "<i>Sleep! sleep!</i>"</p>

<p>And when I woke there she was still, but the lights of dawn
were peeping through the casement. There she knelt, one hand upon
my forehead, and her head, in all its disarray of curls, resting
upon her outstretched arm.</p>

<p>"Charmion," I whispered, "have I slept?"</p>

<p>Instantly she was wide awake, and, gazing on me with tender
eyes, "Yea, thou hast slept, Harmachis."</p>

<p>"How long, then, have I slept?"</p>

<p>"Nine hours."</p>

<p>"And thou hast held thy place there, at my side, for nine long
hours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is nothing; I also have slept&mdash;I feared to waken
thee if I stirred."</p>

<p>"Go, rest," I said; "it shames me to think of this thing. Go
rest thee, Charmion!"</p>

<p>"Vex not thyself," she answered; "see, I will bid a slave
watch thee, and to wake me if thou needest aught; I sleep there,
in the outer chamber. Peace &mdash;I go!" and she strove to rise,
but, so cramped was she, fell straightway on the floor.</p>

<p>I can scarcely tell the sense of shame that filled me when I
saw her fall. Alas! I could not stir to help her.</p>

<p>"It is naught," she said; "move not, I did but catch my foot.
There!" and she rose, again to fall&mdash;"a pest upon my
awkwardness! Why&mdash;I must be sleeping. 'Tis well now. I'll
send the slave;" and she staggered thence like one overcome with
wine.</p>

<p>And after that, I slept once more, for I was very weak. When I
woke it was afternoon, and I craved for food, which Charmion
brought me.</p>

<p>I ate. "Then I die not," I said.</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered, with a toss of her head, "thou wilt live.
In truth, I did waste my pity on thee."</p>

<p>"And thy pity saved my life," I said wearily, for now I
remembered.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she answered carelessly. "After all, thou art
my cousin; also, I love nursing&mdash;it is a woman's trade. Like
enough I had done as much for any slave. Now, too, that the
danger is past, I leave thee."</p>

<p>"Thou hadst done better to let me die, Charmion," I said after
a while, "for life to me can now be only one long shame. Tell me,
then, when sails Cleopatra for Cilicia?"</p>

<p>"She sails in twenty days, and with such pomp and glory as
Egypt has never seen. Of a truth, I cannot guess where she has
found the means to gather in this store of splendour, as a
husbandman gathers his golden harvest."</p>

<p>But I, knowing whence the wealth came, groaned in bitterness
of spirit, and made no answer.</p>

<p>"Goest thou also, Charmion?" I asked presently.</p>

<p>"Ay, I and all the Court. Thou, too&mdash;thou goest."</p>

<p>"I go? Nay, why is this?"</p>

<p>"Because thou art Cleopatra's slave, and must march in gilded
chains behind her chariot; because she fears to leave thee here
in Khem; because it is her will, and there is an end."</p>

<p>"Charmion, can I not escape?"</p>

<p>"Escape, thou poor sick man? Nay, how canst thou escape? Even
now thou art most strictly guarded. And if thou didst escape,
whither wouldst thou fly? There's not an honest man in Egypt but
would spit on thee in scorn!"</p>

<p>Once more I groaned in spirit, and, being so very weak, I felt
the tears roll adown my cheek.</p>

<p>"Weep not!" she said hastily, and turning her face aside. "Be
a man, and brave these troubles out. Thou hast sown, now must
thou reap; but after harvest the waters rise and wash away the
rotting roots, and then seed-time comes again. Perchance, yonder
in Cilicia, a way may be found, when once more thou art strong,
by which thou mayst fly&mdash;if in truth thou canst bear thy
life apart from Cleopatra's smile; then in some far land must
thou dwell till these things are forgotten. And now my task is
done, so fare thee well! At times I will come to visit thee and
see that thou needest nothing."</p>

<p>So she went, and I was nursed thenceforward, and that
skilfully, by the physician and two women-slaves; and as my wound
healed so my strength came back to me, slowly at first, then most
swiftly. In four days from that time I left my couch, and in
three more I could walk an hour in the palace gardens; another
week and I could read and think, though I went no more to Court.
And at length one afternoon Charmion came and bade me make ready,
for the fleet would sail in two days, first for the coast of
Syria, and thence to the gulf of Issus and Cilicia.</p>

<p>Thereon, with all formality, and in writing, I craved leave of
Cleopatra that I might be left, urging that my health was so
feeble that I could not travel. But a message was sent to me in
answer that I must come.</p>

<p>And so, on the appointed day, I was carried in a litter down
to the boat, and together with that very soldier who had cut me
down, the Captain Brennus, and others of his troop (who, indeed,
were sent to guard me), we rowed aboard a vessel where she lay at
anchor with the rest of the great fleet. For Cleopatra was
voyaging as though to war in much pomp, and escorted by a fleet
of ships, among which her galley, built like a house and lined
throughout with cedar and silken hangings, was the most beautiful
and costly that the world has ever seen. But I went not on this
vessel, and therefore it chanced that I did not see Cleopatra or
Charmion till we landed at the mouth of the river Cydnus.</p>

<p>The signal being made, the fleet set sail; and, the wind being
fair, we came to Joppa on the evening of the second day. Thence
we sailed slowly with contrary winds up the coast of Syria,
making Caesarea, and Ptolemais, and Tyrus, and Berytus, and past
Lebanon's white brow crowned with his crest of cedars, on to
Heraclea and across the gulf of Issus to the mouth of Cydnus. And
ever as we journeyed, the strong breath of the sea brought back
my health, till at length, save for a line of white upon my head
where the sword had fallen, I was almost as I had been. And one
night, as we drew near Cydnus, while Brennus and I sat alone
together on the deck, his eye fell upon the white mark his sword
had made, and he swore a great oath by his heathen Gods. "An thou
hadst died, lad," he said, "methinks I could never again have
held up my head! Ah! that was a coward stroke, and I am shamed to
think that it was I who struck it, and thou on the ground with
thy back to me! Knowest thou that when thou didst lie between
life and death, I came every day to ask tidings of thee? and I
swore by Taranis that if thou didst die I'd turn my back upon
that soft palace life and then away for the bonny North."</p>

<p>"Nay, trouble not, Brennus," I answered; "it was thy
duty."</p>

<p>"Mayhap! but there are duties that a brave man should not
do&mdash; nay, not at the bidding of any Queen who ever ruled in
Egypt! Thy blow had dazed me or I had not struck. What is it,
lad?&mdash;art in trouble with this Queen of ours? Why art thou
dragged a prisoner upon this pleasure party? Knowest thou that we
are strictly charged that if thou dost escape our lives shall pay
the price?"</p>

<p>"Ay, in sore trouble, friend," I answered; "ask me no
more."</p>

<p>"Then, being of the age thou art, there's a woman in
it&mdash;that I swear&mdash;and, perchance, though I am rough and
foolish, I might make a guess. Look thou, lad, what sayest thou?
I am weary of this service of Cleopatra and this hot land of
deserts and of luxury, that sap a man's strength and drain his
pocket; and so are others whom I know of. What sayest thou: let's
take one of these unwieldy vessels and away to the North? I'll
lead thee to a better land than Egypt&mdash;a land of lake and
mountain, and great forests of sweet-scented pine; ay, and find
thee a girl fit to mate with&mdash;my own niece&mdash;a girl
strong and tall, with wide blue eyes and long fair hair, and arms
that could crack thy ribs were she of a mind to hug thee! Come,
what sayest thou? Put away the past, and away for the bonny
North, and be a son to me."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought, and then sadly shook my head; for
though I was sorely tempted to be gone, I knew that my fate lay
in Egypt, and I might not fly my fate.</p>

<p>"It may not be, Brennus," I answered. "Fain would I that it
might be, but I am bound by a chain of destiny which I cannot
break, and in the land of Egypt I must live and die."</p>

<p>"As thou wilt, lad," said the old warrior. "I should have
dearly loved to marry thee among my people, and make a son of
thee. At the least, remember that while I am here thou hast
Brennus for a friend. And one thing more; beware of that
beauteous Queen of thine, for, by Taranis, perhaps an hour may
come when she will hold that thou knowest too much, and
then&mdash;" and he drew his hand across his throat. "And now
good night; a cup of wine, then to sleep, for to- morrow the
foolery&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Here several lengths of the second roll of papyrus are so
broken as to be undecipherable. They seem to have been
descriptive of Cleopatra's voyage up the Cydnus to the city of
Tarsus.]</p>

<p>"And&mdash;[the writing continues]&mdash;to those who could
take joy in such things, the sight must, indeed, have been a
gallant one. For the stern of our galley was covered with sheets
of beaten gold, the sails were of the scarlet of Tyre, and the
oars of silver touched the water to a measure of music. And
there, in the centre of the vessel, beneath an awning ablaze with
gold embroidery, lay Cleopatra, attired as the Roman Venus (and
surely Venus was not more fair!), in thin robes of whitest silk,
bound in beneath her breast with a golden girdle delicately
graven over with scenes of love. All about her were little rosy
boys, chosen for their beauty, and clad in naught save downy
wings strapped upon their shoulders, and on their backs Cupid's
bow and quiver, who fanned her with fans of plumes. Upon the
vessel's decks, handling the cordage, that was of silken web, and
softly singing to the sound of harps and the beat of oars, were
no rough sailors, but women lovely to behold, some robed as
Graces and some as Nereids&mdash;that is, scarce robed at all,
except in their scented hair. And behind the couch, with drawn
sword, stood Brennus, in splendid armour and winged helm of gold;
and by him others&mdash;I among them&mdash;in garments richly
worked, and knew that I was indeed a slave! On the high poop also
burned censers filled with costliest incense, of which the
fragrant steam hung in little clouds about our wake.</p>

<p>Thus, as in a dream of luxury, followed by many ships, we
glided on towards the wooded slopes of Taurus, at whose foot lay
that ancient city Tarshish. And ever as we came the people
gathered on the banks and ran before us, shouting: "Venus is
risen from the sea! Venus hath come to visit Bacchus!" We drew
near to the city, and all its people&mdash;everyone who could
walk or be carried&mdash;crowded down in thousands to the docks,
and with them came the whole army of Antony, so that at length
the Triumvir was left alone upon the judgment seat.</p>

<p>Dellius, the false-tongued, came also, fawning and bowing, and
in the name of Antony gave the "Queen of Beauty" greeting,
bidding her to a feast that Antony had made ready. But she made
high answer, and said, "Forsooth, it is Antony who should wait on
us; not we on Antony. Bid the noble Antony to our poor table this
night&mdash;else we dine alone."</p>

<p>Dellius went, bowing to the ground; the feast was made ready;
and then at last I set eyes on Antony. He came clad in purple
robes, a great man and beautiful to see, set in the stout prime
of life, with bright eyes of blue, and curling hair, and features
cut sharply as a Grecian gem. For he was great of form and royal
of mien, and with an open countenance on which his thoughts were
so clearly written that all might read them; only the weakness of
the mouth belied the power of the brow. He came attended by his
generals, and when he reached the couch where Cleopatra lay he
stood astonished, gazing on her with wide-opened eyes. She, too,
gazed on him earnestly; I saw the red blood run up beneath her
skin, and a great pang of jealousy seized upon my heart. And
Charmion, who saw all beneath her downcast eyes, saw this also
and smiled. But Cleopatra spoke no word, only she stretched out
her white hand for him to kiss; and he, saying no word, took her
hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Behold, noble Antony!" she said at last in her voice of
music, "thou hast called me, and I am come."</p>

<br>

<p>"Venus has come," he answered in his deep notes, and still
holding his eyes fixed upon her face. "I called a woman&mdash;a
Goddess hath risen from the deep!"</p>

<p>"To find a God to greet her on the land," she laughed with
ready wit. "Well, a truce to compliments, for being on the earth
even Venus is ahungered. Noble Antony, thy hand."</p>

<p>The trumpets blared, and through the bowing crowd Cleopatra,
followed by her train, passed hand in hand with Antony to the
feast.</p>

<p class="smcap" style="text-align:center">
Of The Feast Of Cleopatra,<br>
Of The Melting Of The Pearl,<br>
Of The Saying Of Harmachis, And<br>
Of Cleopatra's Vow Of Love</p>
<br>

<br>

<p class="first">THE third night the feast was once more
prepared in the hall of the great house that had been set aside
to the use of Cleopatra, and on this night its splendour was
greater even than on the nights before. For the twelve couches
that were set about the table were embossed with gold, and those
of Cleopatra and Antony were of gold set with jewels. The dishes
also were all of gold set with jewels, the walls were hung with
purple cloths sewn with gold, and on the floor, covered with a
net of gold, fresh roses were strewn ankle- deep, that as the
slaves trod them sent up their perfume. Once again I was bidden
to stand, with Charmion and Iras and Merira, behind the couch of
Cleopatra, and, like a slave, from time to time call out the
hours as they flew. And there being no help, I went wild at
heart; but this I swore&mdash; it should be for the last time,
since I could not bear that shame. For though I would not yet
believe what Charmion told me&mdash;that Cleopatra was about to
become the Love of Antony&mdash;yet I could no more endure this
ignominy and torture. For from Cleopatra now I had no words save
such as a Queen speaks to her slave, and methinks it gave her
dark heart pleasure to torment me.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that I, the Pharaoh, crowned of Khem,
stood among eunuchs and waiting-women behind the couch of Egypt's
Queen while the feast went merrily and the wine-cup passed. And
ever Antony sat, his eyes fixed upon the face of Cleopatra, who
from time to time let her deep glance lose itself in his, and
then for a little while their talk died away. For he told her
tales of war and of deeds that he had done&mdash;ay, and love-
jests such as are not meet for the ears of women. But she took
offence at nothing; rather, falling into his humour, she would
cap his stories with others of a finer wit, but not less
shameless.</p>

<p>At length, the rich meal being finished, Antony gazed at the
splendour around him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, most lovely Egypt," he said; "are the sands of
Nile compact of gold, that thou canst, night by night, thus
squander the ransom of a King upon a single feast? Whence comes
this untold wealth?"</p>

<p>I bethought me of the tomb of the Divine Menkau-ra, whose holy
treasure was thus wickedly wasted, and looked up so that
Cleopatra's eye caught mine; but, reading my thoughts, she
frowned heavily.</p>

<p>"Why, noble Antony," she said, "surely it is nothing! In Egypt
we have our secrets, and know whence to conjure riches at our
need. Say, what is the value of this golden service, and of the
meats and drinks that have been set before us?"</p>

<p>He cast his eyes about, and hazarded a guess.</p>

<p>"Maybe a thousand sestertia." (20)</p>

<p class="footnote">20. About eight thousand pounds
of English money. &mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>"Thou hast understated it by half, noble Antony! But such as
it is I will give it thee and those with thee as a free token of
my friendship. And more will I show thee now: I myself will eat
and drink ten thousand sestertia at a draught."</p>

<p>"That cannot be, fair Egypt!"</p>

<p>She laughed, and bade a slave bring her white vinegar in a
glass. When it was brought she set it before her and laughed
again, while Antony, rising from his couch, drew near and set
himself at her side, and all the company leant forward to see
what she would do. And this she did. She took from her ear one of
those great pearls which last of all had been drawn from the body
of the Divine Pharaoh; and before any could guess her purpose she
let it fall into the vinegar. Then came silence, the silence of
wonder, and slowly the priceless pearl melted in the strong acid.
When it was melted she lifted the glass and shook it, then drank
the vinegar, to the last drop.</p>

<p>"More vinegar, slave!" she cried; "my meal is but half
finished!" and she drew forth the second pearl.</p>

<p>"By Bacchus, no! that shalt thou not!" cried Antony, snatching
at her hands; "I have seen enough;" and at that moment, moved to
it by I know not what, I called aloud:</p>

<p>"The hour falls, O Queen!&mdash;<i>the hour of the coming of
the curse of Menkau-ra!</i>"</p>

<p>An ashy whiteness grew upon Cleopatra's face, and she turned
upon me furiously, while all the company gazed wondering, not
knowing what the words might mean.</p>

<p>"Thou ill-omened slave!" she cried. "Speak thus once more and
thou shalt be scourged with rods!&mdash;ay, scourged like an
evildoer&mdash;that I promise thee, Harmachis!"</p>

<p>"What means the knave of an astrologer?" asked Antony. "Speak,
sirrah! and make clear thy meaning, for those who deal in curses
must warrant their wares."</p>

<p>"I am a servant of the Gods, noble Antony. That which the Gods
put in my mind that must I say; nor can I read their meaning," I
answered humbly.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! thou servest the Gods, dost thou, thou many-coloured
mystery?" This he said having reference to my splendid robes.
"Well, I serve the Goddesses, which is a softer cult. And there's
this between us: that though what they put in my mind I say,
neither can I read their meaning," and he glanced at Cleopatra as
one who questions.</p>

<p>"Let the knave be," she said impatiently; "to-morrow we'll be
rid of him. Sirrah, begone!"</p>

<p>I bowed and went; and, as I went, I heard Antony say: "Well,
he may be a knave&mdash;for that all men are&mdash;but this for
thy astrologer: he hath a royal air and the eye of a
King&mdash;ay, and wit in it."</p>

<p>Without the door I paused, not knowing what to do, for I was
bewildered with misery. And, as I stood, someone touched me on
the hand. I glanced up &mdash;it was Charmion, who in the
confusion of the rising of the guests, had slipped away and
followed me.</p>

<p>For in trouble Charmion was ever at my side.</p>

<p>"Follow me," she whispered; "thou art in danger."</p>

<p>I turned and followed her. Why should I not?</p>

<p>"Whither go we?" I asked at length.</p>

<p>"To my chamber," she said. "Fear not; we ladies of Cleopatra's
Court have small good fame to lose; if anyone by chance should
see us, they'll think that it is a love-tryst, and such are all
the fashion."</p>

<p>I followed, and, presently, skirting the crowd, we came unseen
to a little side entrance that led to a stair, up which we
passed. The stair ended in a passage; we turned down it till we
found a door on the left hand. Charmion entered silently, and I
followed her into a dark chamber. Being in, she barred the door
and, kindling tinder to a flame, lit a hanging lamp. As the light
grew strong I gazed around. The chamber was not large, and had
but one casement, closely shuttered. For the rest, it was simply
furnished, having white walls, some chests for garments, an
ancient chair, what I took to be a tiring table, on which were
combs, perfumes, and all the frippery that pertains to woman, and
a white bed with a broidered coverlid, over which was hung a
gnat-gauze.</p>

<p>"Be seated, Harmachis," she said, pointing to the chair. I
took the chair, and Charmion, throwing back the gnat-gauze, sat
herself upon the bed before me.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou what I heard Cleopatra say as thou didst leave
the banqueting-hall?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not."</p>

<p>"She gazed after thee, and, as I went over to her to do some
service, she murmured to herself: 'By Serapis, I will make an
end! I will wait no longer: to- morrow he shall be
strangled!'"</p>

<p>"So!" I said, "it may be; though, after all that has been, I
can scarce believe that she will murder me."</p>

<p>"Why canst thou not believe it, thou most foolish of men? Dost
forget how nigh thou wast to death there in the Alabaster Hall?
Who saved thee then from the knives of the eunuchs? Was it
Cleopatra? Or was it I and Brennus? Stay, I will tell thee. Thou
canst not yet believe it, because, in thy folly, thou dost not
think it possible that the woman who has but lately been as a
wife to thee can now, in so short a time, doom thee to be basely
done to death. Nay, answer not&mdash;I know all; and I tell thee
this: thou hast not measured the depth of Cleopatra's perfidy,
nor canst thou dream the blackness of her wicked heart. She had
surely slain thee in Alexandria had she not feared that thy
slaughter being noised abroad might bring trouble on her.
Therefore has she brought thee here to kill thee secretly. For
what more canst thou give her? She has thy heart's love, and is
wearied of thy strength and beauty. She has robbed thee of thy
royal birthright and brought thee, a King, to stand amidst the
waiting- women behind her at her feasts; she has won from thee
the great secret of the holy treasure!"</p>

<p>"Ah, thou knowest that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all; and to-night thou seest how the wealth
stored against the need of Khem is being squandered to fill up
the wanton luxury of Khem's Macedonian Queen! Thou seest how she
has kept her oath to wed thee honourably. Harmachis&mdash;at
length thine eyes are open to the truth!"</p>

<p>"Ay, I see too well; and yet she swore she loved me, and I,
poor fool, I believed her!"</p>

<p>"She swore she loved thee!" answered Charmion, lifting her
dark eyes: "now I will show thee how she loves thee. Knowest thou
what was this house? It was a priest's college; and, as thou
wottest, Harmachis, priests have their ways. This little room
aforetime was the room of the Head Priest, and the chamber that
is beyond and below was the gathering-place of the other priests.
The old slave who keeps the house told me all this, and also she
revealed what I shall show thee. Now, Harmachis, be silent as the
dead, and follow me!"</p>

<p>She blew out the lamp, and by the little light that crept
through the shuttered casement led me by the hand to the far
corner of the room. Here she pressed upon the wall, and a door
opened in its thickness. We entered, and she closed the spring.
Now we were in a little chamber, some five cubits in length by
four in breadth; for a faint light struggled into the closet, and
also the sound of voices, I knew not whence. Loosing my hand, she
crept to the end of the place, and looked steadfastly at the
wall; then crept back and, whispering "Silence!" led me forward
with her. Then I saw that there were eyeholes in the wall, which
pierced it, and were hidden on the farther side by carved work in
stone. I looked through the hole that was in front of me, and I
saw this: six cubits below was the level of the floor of another
chamber, lit with fragrant lamps, and most richly furnished. It
was the sleeping-place of Cleopatra, and there, within ten cubits
of where we stood, sat Cleopatra on a gilded couch, and by her
side sat Antony.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Cleopatra murmured&mdash;for this place was so
built that every word spoken in the room below came to the ears
of the listener above &mdash;"tell me, noble Antony, wast pleased
with my poor festival?"</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered in his deep soldier's voice, "ay, Egypt, I
have made feasts, and been bidden to feasts, but never saw I
aught like thine; and I tell thee this, though I am rough of
tongue and unskilled in pretty sayings such as women love, thou
wast the richest sight of all that splendid board. The red wine
was not so red as thy beauteous cheek, the roses smelt not so
sweet as the odour of thy hair, and no sapphire there with its
changing light was so lovely as thy eyes of ocean blue."</p>

<p>"What! Praise from Antony! Sweet words from the lips of him
whose writings are so harsh! Why, it is praise indeed!"</p>

<p>"Ay," he went on, "it was a royal feast, though I grieve that
thou didst waste that great pearl; and what meant that hour-
calling astrologer of thine, with his ill-omened talk of the
curse of Menkau-ra?"</p>

<p>A shadow fled across her glowing face. "I know not; he was
lately wounded in a brawl, and methinks the blow has crazed
him."</p>

<p>"He seemed not crazed, and there was that about his voice
which rings in my ears like some oracle of fate. So wildly, too,
he looked upon thee, Egypt, with those piercing eyes of his, like
one who loved and yet hated through the love."</p>

<p>"He is a strange man, I tell thee, noble Antony, and a
learned. Myself, at times, I almost fear him, for he is deeply
versed in the ancient arts of Egypt. Knowest thou that the man is
of royal blood, and once he plotted to slay me? But I won him
over, and slew him not, for he had the key to secrets that I fain
would learn; and, indeed, I loved his wisdom, and to listen to
his deep talk of all hidden things."</p>

<p>"By Bacchus, I grow jealous of the knave! And now, Egypt?"</p>

<p>"And now I have sucked his knowledge dry, and have no more
cause to fear him. Didst thou not see that I have made him stand
these three nights a slave amid my slaves, and call aloud the
hours as they fled in festival. No captive King marching in thy
Roman triumphs can have suffered pangs so keen as that proud
Egyptian Prince when he stood shamed behind my couch."</p>

<p>Here Charmion laid her hand on mine and pressed it, as though
in tenderness.</p>

<p>"Well, he shall trouble us no more with his words of evil
omen," Cleopatra went on slowly; "to-morrow morn he
dies&mdash;dies swiftly and in secret, leaving no trace of what
his fate has been. On this is my mind fixed; of a truth, noble
Antony, it is fixed. Even as I speak the fear of this man grows
and gathers in my breast. Half am I minded to give the word even
now, for I breathe not freely till he be dead," and she made as
though to rise.</p>

<p>"Let it be till morning," he said, catching her by the hand;
"the soldiers drink, and the deed will be ill done. 'Tis pity
too. I love not to think of men slaughtered in their sleep."</p>

<p>"In the morning, perchance, the hawk may have flown," she
answered, pondering. "He hath keen ears, this Harmachis, and can
summon things to aid him that are not of the earth. Perchance,
even now he hears me in the spirit; for, of a truth, I seem to
feel his presence breathing round me. I could tell thee
&mdash;but no, let him be! Noble Antony, be my tiring-woman and
loose me this crown of gold, it chafes my brow. Be gentle, hurt
me not&mdash;so."</p>

<p>He lifted the uraeus crown from her brows, and she shook loose
her heavy weight of hair that fell about her like a garment.</p>

<p>"Take back thy crown, royal Egypt," he said, speaking low,
"take it from my hand; I will not rob thee of it, but rather set
it more firmly on that beauteous brow."</p>

<p>"What means my Lord?" she asked, smiling and looking into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"What mean I? Why then, this: thou camest hither at my bidding
to make answer of the charges laid against thee as to matters
politic. And knowest thou, Egypt, that hadst thou been other than
thou art thou hadst not gone back to queen it on the Nile; for of
this I am sure, the charges against thee are true in fact. But,
being what thou art&mdash;and look thou! never did Nature serve a
woman better!&mdash;I forgive thee all. For the sake of thy grace
and beauty I forgive thee that which had not been forgiven to
virtue, or to patriotism, or to the dignity of age! See now how
good a thing is woman's wit and loveliness, that can make kings
forget their duty and cozen even blindfolded Justice to peep ere
she lifts her sword! Take back thy crown, O Egypt! It is now my
care that, though it be heavy, it shall not chafe thee."</p>

<p>"These are royal words, most notable Antony," she made answer;
"gracious and generous words, such as befit the Conqueror of the
world! And touching my misdeeds in the past&mdash;if misdeeds
there have been&mdash;I say this, and this alone&mdash;then I
knew not Antony. For, knowing Antony, who could sin against him?
What woman could lift a sword against one who must be to all
women as a God&mdash;one who, seen and known, draws after him the
whole allegiance of the heart, as the sun draws flowers? And what
more can I say and not cross the bounds of woman's modesty? Why,
only this&mdash;set that crown upon my brow, great Antony, and I
will take it as a gift from thee, by the giving made doubly dear,
and to thy uses I will guard it.</p>

<p>"There, now I am thy vassal Queen, and through me all old
Egypt that I rule does homage to Antony the Triumvir, who shall
be Antony the Emperor of Rome and Khem's Imperial Lord!"</p>

<p>And, having set the crown upon her locks, he stood gazing on
her, grown passionate in the warm breath of her living beauty,
till at length he caught her by both hands and drawing her to him
kissed her thrice, saying:</p>

<p>"Cleopatra, I love thee, Sweet&mdash;I love thee as I never
loved before." She drew back from his embrace, smiling softly;
and as she did so the golden circlet of the sacred snakes fell,
being but loosely set upon her brow, and rolled away into the
darkness beyond the ring of light.</p>

<p>I saw the omen, and even in the bitter anguish of my heart
knew its evil import. But these twain took no note.</p>

<p>"Thou lovest me?" she said, most sweetly; "how know I that
thou lovest me? Perchance it is Fulvia whom thou
lovest&mdash;Fulvia, thy wedded wife?"</p>

<p>"Nay, it is not Fulvia, 'tis thou, Cleopatra, and thou alone.
Many women have looked favourably upon me from my boyhood up, but
to never a one have I known such desire as to thee, O thou Wonder
of the World, like unto whom no woman ever was! Canst thou love
me, Cleopatra, and to me be true, not for my place or power, not
for that which I can give or can withhold, not for the stern
music of my legion's tramp, or for the light that flows from my
bright Star of Fortune; but for myself, for the sake of Antony,
the rough captain, grown old in camps? Ay, for the sake of Antony
the reveller, the frail, the unfixed of purpose, but who yet
never did desert a friend, or rob a poor man, or take an enemy
unawares? Say, canst thou love me, Egypt? Oh! if thou wilt, why,
I am more happy than though I sat to-night in the Capitol at Rome
crowned absolute Monarch of the World!"</p>

<p>And, ever as he spoke, she gazed on him with wonderful eyes,
and in them shone a light of truth and honesty such as was
strange to me.</p>

<p>"Thou speakest plainly," she said, "and thy words are sweet to
mine ears &mdash;they would be sweet, even were things otherwise
than they are, for what woman would not love to see the world's
master at her feet? But things being as they are, why, Antony,
what can be so sweet as thy sweet words? The harbour of his rest
to the storm-tossed mariner&mdash;surely that is sweet! The dream
of Heaven's bliss which cheers the poor ascetic priest on his
path of sacrifice &mdash;surely that is sweet! The sight of Dawn,
the rosy-fingered, coming in his promise to glad the watching
Earth&mdash;surely that is sweet! But, ah! not one of these, nor
all dear delightful things that are, can match the honey-
sweetness of thy words to me, O Antony! For thou knowest
not&mdash;never canst thou know&mdash;how drear my life hath
been, and empty, since thus it is ordained that in love only can
woman lose her solitude! And I have <i>never</i>
loved&mdash;never might I love&mdash;till this happy night! Ay,
take me in thy arms, and let us swear a great vow of
love&mdash;an oath that may not be broken while life is in us!
Behold! Antony! now and for ever I do vow most strict fidelity
unto thee! Now and for ever I am thine, and thine alone!"</p>

<p>Then Charmion took me by the hand and drew me thence.</p>

<p>"Hast seen enough?" she asked, when we were once more within
the chamber and the lamp was lit.</p>

<p>"Yea," I answered; "my eyes are opened."</p>

Of The Plan Of Charmion,<br>

<br>

<p class="first">SOME while I sat with bowed head, and the
last bitterness of shame sank into my soul. This, then, was the
end. For this I had betrayed my oaths; for this I had told the
secret of the pyramid; for this I had lost my Crown, my Honour,
and, perchance, my hope of Heaven! Could there be another man in
the wide world so steeped in sorrow as I was that night? Surely
not one! Where should I turn? What could I do? And even through
the tempest of my torn heart the bitter voice of jealousy called
aloud. For I loved this woman, to whom I had given all; and she
at this moment&mdash;she was&mdash;Ah! I could not bear to think
of it; and in my utter agony, my heart burst in a river of tears
such as are terrible to weep!</p>

<p>Then Charmion drew near me, and I saw that she, too, was
weeping.</p>

<p>"Weep not, Harmachis!" she sobbed, kneeling at my side. "I
cannot endure to see thee weep. Oh! why wouldst thou not be
warned? Then hadst thou been great and happy, and not as now.
Listen, Harmachis! Thou didst hear what that false and tigerish
woman said&mdash;to-morrow she hands thee over to the
murderers!"</p>

<p>"It is well," I gasped.</p>

<p>"Nay: it is not well. Harmachis, give her not this last
triumph over thee. Thou hast lost all save life: but while life
remains, hope remains also, and with hope the chance of
vengeance."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, starting from my seat. "I had not thought of
that. Ay &mdash;the chance of vengeance! It would be sweet to be
avenged!"</p>

<p>"It would be sweet, Harmachis, and yet this&mdash;Vengeance is
an arrow that in falling oft pierces him who shot it.
Myself&mdash;I know it," and she sighed. "But a truce to talk and
grief. There will be time for us twain to grieve, if not to talk,
in all the heavy coming years. Thou must fly &mdash;before the
coming of the light must thou fly. Here is a plan. To-morrow, ere
the dawn, a galley that but yesterday came from Alexandria,
bearing fruit and stores, sails thither again, and its captain is
known to me, but to thee he is not known. Now, I will find thee
the garb of a Syrian merchant, and cloak thee, as I know how, and
furnish thee with a letter to the captain of the galley. He shall
give thee passage to Alexandria; for to him thou wilt seem but as
a merchant going on the business of thy trade. Brennus is officer
of the guard to-night, and Brennus is a friend to me and thee.
Perhaps he will guess somewhat; or, perhaps, he will not guess;
at the least, the Syrian merchant shall safely pass the lines.
What sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"It is well," I answered wearily; "little do I reck the
issue."</p>

<p>"Rest thou, then, here, Harmachis, while I make these matters
ready; and, Harmachis, grieve not overmuch; there are others who
should grieve more heavily than thou." And she went, leaving me
alone with my agony which rent me like a torture-bed. Had it not
been for that fierce desire of vengeance which from time to time
flashed across my tormented mind as the lightning over a midnight
sea, methinks my reason had left me in that dark hour. At length
I heard her footstep at the door, and she entered, breathing
heavily, for she bore a sack of clothing in her arms.</p>

<p>"It is well," she said: "here is the garb with spare linen,
and writing-tablets, and all things needful. I have seen Brennus
also, and told him that a Syrian merchant would pass the guard an
hour before the dawn. And though he made pretence of sleep, I
think he understood, for he answered, yawning, that if they but
had the pass-word, 'Antony,' fifty Syrian merchants might go
through about their lawful business. And here is the letter to
the captain &mdash;thou canst not mistake the galley, for she is
moored along to the right &mdash;a small galley, painted black,
as thou dost enter on the great quay, and, moreover, the sailors
make ready for sailing. Now I will wait here without, while thou
dost put off the livery of thy service and array thyself."</p>

<p>When she was gone I tore off my gorgeous garments and spat
upon them and trod them on the ground. Then I put on the modest
robe of a merchant, and bound the tablets round me, on my feet
the sandals of untanned hide, and at my waist the knife. When it
was done Charmion entered once again and looked on me.</p>

<p>"Too much art thou still the royal Harmachis," she said; "see,
it must be changed."</p>

<p>Then she took scissors from her tiring-table, and, bidding me
be seated, she cut off my locks, clipping the hair close to the
head. Next she found stains of such sort as women use to make
dark the eyes, and mixed them cunningly, rubbing the stuff on my
face and hands and on the white mark in my hair where the sword
of Brennus had bitten to the bone.</p>

<p>"Now thou art changed&mdash;somewhat for the worse,
Harmachis," she said, with a dreary laugh, "scarce myself should
I know thee. Stay, there is one more thing," and, going to a
chest of garments, she drew thence a heavy bag of gold.</p>

<p>"Take thou this," she said; "thou wilt have need of
money."</p>

<p>"I cannot take thy gold, Charmion."</p>

<p>"Yes, take it. It was Sepa who gave it to me for the
furtherance of our cause, and therefore it is fitting that thou
shouldst spend it. Moreover, if I want money, doubtless Antony,
who is henceforth my master, will give me more; he is much
beholden to me, and this he knows well. There, waste not the
precious time in haggling o'er the pelf&mdash;not yet art thou
all a merchant, Harmachis;" and, without more words, she thrust
the pieces into the leather bag that hung across my shoulders.
Then she made fast the sack containing the spare garments, and,
so womanly thoughtful was she, placed in it an alabaster jar of
pigment, with which I might stain my countenance afresh, and,
taking the broidered robes of my office that I had cast off, hid
them in the secret passage. And so at last all was made
ready.</p>

<p>"Is it time that I should go," I asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet a while. Be patient, Harmachis, for but one little
hour more must thou endure my presence, and then, perchance,
farewell for ever."</p>

<p>I made a gesture signifying that this was no time for sharp
words.</p>

<p>"Forgive me my quick tongue," she said; "but from a salt
spring bitter waters well. Be seated, Harmachis; I have heavier
words to speak to thee before thou goest."</p>

<p>"Say on," I answered; "words, however heavy, can move me no
more."</p>

<p>She stood before me with folded hands, and the lamp-light
shone upon her beauteous face. I noticed idly how great was its
pallor and how wide and dark were the rings about the deep black
eyes. Twice she lifted her white face and strove to speak, twice
her voice failed her; and when at last it came it was in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>"I cannot let thee go," she said&mdash;"I cannot let thee go
unwitting of the truth.</p>

<p>"<i>Harmachis, 'twas I who did betray thee!</i>"</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, an oath upon my lips; but she caught me
by the hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, be seated," she said&mdash;"be seated and hear me; then,
when thou hast heart, do to me as thou wilt. Listen. From that
evil moment when, in the presence of thy uncle Sepa, for the
second time I set eyes upon thy face, I loved thee&mdash;how
much, thou canst little guess. Think upon thine own love for
Cleopatra, and double it, and double it again, and perchance thou
mayst come near to my love's mighty sum. I loved thee, day by day
I loved thee more, till in thee and for thee alone I seemed to
live. But thou wast cold &mdash;thou wast worse than cold! thou
didst deal with me not as a breathing woman, but rather as the
instrument to an end&mdash;as a tool with which to grave thy
fortunes. And then I saw&mdash;yes, long before thou knewest it
thyself&mdash;thy heart's tide was setting strong towards that
ruinous shore whereon to-day thy life is broken. And at last that
night came, that dreadful night when, hid within the chamber, I
saw thee cast my kerchief to the winds, and with sweet words
cherish my royal Rival's gift. Then&mdash;oh, thou
knowest&mdash;in my pain I betrayed the secret that thou wouldst
not see, and thou didst make a mock of me, Harmachis! Oh! the
shame of it&mdash;thou in thy foolishness didst make a mock of
me! I went thence, and within me were rising all the torments
which can tear a woman's heart, for now I was sure that thou
didst love Cleopatra! Ay, and so mad was I, even that night I was
minded to betray thee: but I thought&mdash;not yet, not yet; to-
morrow he may soften. Then came the morrow, and all was ready for
the bursting of the great plot that should make thee Pharaoh. And
I too came&mdash;thou dost remember &mdash;and again thou didst
put me away when I spake to thee in parables, as something of
little worth&mdash;as a thing too small to claim a moment's
weighty thought. And, knowing that this was because&mdash;though
thou knewest it not&mdash;thou didst love Cleopatra, whom now
thou must straightway slay, I grew mad, and a wicked Spirit
entered into me, possessing me utterly, so that I was myself no
longer, nor could control myself. And because thou hadst scorned
me, I did this, to my everlasting shame and sorrow! &mdash;I
passed into Cleopatra's presence and betrayed thee and those with
thee, and our holy cause, saying that I had found a writing which
thou hadst let fall and read all this therein."</p>

<p>I gasped and sat silent; and gazing sadly at me she went
on:</p>

<p>"When she understood how great was the plot, and how deep its
roots, Cleopatra was much troubled; and, at first, she would have
fled to Sais or taken ship and run for Cyprus, but I showed her
that the ways were barred. Then she said she would cause thee to
be slain, there, in the chamber, and I left her so believing;
for, at that hour, I was glad that thou shouldst be slain
&mdash;ay, even if I wept out my heart upon thy grave, Harmachis.
But what said I just now?&mdash;Vengeance is an arrow that oft
falls on him who looses it. So it was with me; for between my
going and thy coming Cleopatra hatched a deeper plan. She feared
that to slay thee would only be to light a fiercer fire of
revolt; but she saw that to bind thee to her, and, having left
men awhile in doubt, to show thee faithless, would strike the
imminent danger at its roots and wither it. This plot once
formed, being great, she dared its doubtful issue, and&mdash;need
I go on? Thou knowest, Harmachis, how she won; and thus the shaft
of vengeance that I loosed fell upon my own head. For on the
morrow I knew that I had sinned for naught, that the burden of my
betrayal had been laid on the wretched Paulus, and that I had but
ruined the cause to which I was sworn and given the man I loved
to the arms of wanton Egypt."</p>

<p>She bowed her head awhile, and then, as I spoke not, once more
went on:</p>

<p>"Let all my sin be told, Harmachis, and then let justice come.
See now, this thing happened. Half did Cleopatra learn to love
thee, and deep in her heart she bethought her of taking thee to
wedded husband. For the sake of this half love of hers she spared
the lives of those in the plot whom she had meshed, bethinking
her that if she wedded thee she might use them and thee to draw
the heart of Egypt, which loves not her nor any Ptolemy. And
then, once again she entrapped thee, and in thy folly thou didst
betray to her the secret of the hidden wealth of Egypt, which to-
day she squanders to delight the luxurious Antony; and, of a
truth, at that time she purposed to make good her oath and marry
thee. But on the very morn when Dellius came for answer she sent
for me, and telling me all&mdash;for my wit, above any, she holds
at price &mdash;demanded of me my judgment whether she should
defy Antony and wed thee, or whether she should put the thought
away and come to Antony. And I&mdash; now mark thou all my
sin&mdash;I, in my bitter jealousy, rather than I would see her
thy wedded wife and thou her loving lord, counselled her most
strictly that she should come to Antony, well knowing&mdash;for I
had had speech with Dellius&mdash;that if she came, this weak
Antony would fall like a ripe fruit at her feet, as, indeed, he
has fallen. And but now I have shown thee the issue of the
scheme. Antony loves Cleopatra and Cleopatra loves Antony, and
thou art robbed, and matters have gone well for me, who of all
women on the earth to-night am the wretchedest by far. For when I
saw how thy heart broke but now, my heart seemed to break with
thine, and I could no longer bear the burden of my evil deeds,
but knew that I must tell them and take my punishment.</p>

<p>"And now, Harmachis, I have no more to say; save that I thank
thee for thy courtesy in hearkening, and this one thing I add.
Driven by my great love I have sinned against thee unto death! I
have ruined thee, I have ruined Khem, and myself also I have
ruined! Let death reward me! Slay thou me, Harmachis &mdash;I
will gladly die upon thy sword; ay, and kiss its blade! Slay thou
me and go; for if thou slayest me not, myself I will surely
slay!" And she threw herself upon her knees, lifting her fair
breast toward me, that I might smite her with my dagger. And, in
my bitter fury, I was minded to strike; for, above all, I thought
how, when I was fallen, this woman, who herself was my cause of
shame, had scourged me with her whip of scorn. But it is hard to
slay a fair woman; and, even as I lifted my hand to strike, I
remembered that she had now twice saved my life.</p>

<p>"Woman! thou shameless woman!" I said, "arise! I slay thee
not! Who am I, that I should judge thy crime, that, with mine
own, doth overtop all earthly judgment?"</p>

<p>"Slay me, Harmachis!" she moaned; "slay me, or I slay myself!
My burden is too great for me to bear! Be not so deadly calm!
Curse me, and slay!"</p>

<p>"What was it that thou didst say to me just now,
Charmion&mdash;that as I had sown so I must reap? It is not
lawful that thou shouldst slay thyself; it is not lawful that I,
thine equal in sin, should slay thee because through thee I
sinned. As <i>thou</i> hast sown, Charmion, so must <i>thou</i>
also reap. Base woman! whose cruel jealousy has brought all these
woes on me and Egypt, live&mdash;live on, and from year to year
pluck the bitter fruit of crime! Haunted be thy sleep by visions
of thy outraged Gods, whose vengeance awaits thee and me in their
dim Amenti! Haunted be thy days by memories of that man whom thy
fierce love brought to shame and ruin, and by the sight of Khem a
prey to the insatiate Cleopatra and a slave to Roman Antony."</p>

<p>"Oh, speak not thus, Harmachis! Thy words are sharper than any
sword; and more surely, if more slowly, shall they slay! Listen,
Harmachis," and she grasped my robe: "when thou wast great, and
all power lay within thy grasp, thou didst reject me. Wilt reject
me now that Cleopatra hast cast thee from her &mdash;now that
thou art poor and shamed and with no pillow to thy head? Still am
I fair, and still I worship thee. Let me fly with thee, and make
atonement for my lifelong love. Or, if this be too great a thing
to ask, let me be but as thy sister and thy servant&mdash;thy
very slave, so that I may still look upon thy face, and share thy
trouble and minister to thee. O Harmachis, let me but come and I
will brave all things and endure all things, and nothing but
Death himself shall stay me from thy side. For I do believe that
the love that sank me to so low a depth, dragging thee with me,
can yet lift me to an equal height, and thee with me!"</p>

<p>"Wouldst tempt me to fresh sin, woman? And dost thou think,
Charmion, that in some hovel where I must hide, I could bear, day
by day, to look upon thy fair face, and seeing, remember that
those lips betrayed me? Not thus easily shalt thou atone! This I
know even now: many and heavy shall be thy lonely days of
penance! Perchance that hour of vengeance yet may come, and
perchance thou shalt live to play thy part in it. Thou must still
abide in the Court of Cleopatra; and, while thou art there, if I
yet live, I will from time to time find means to give thee
tidings. Perhaps a day may dawn when once more I shall need thy
service. Now, swear that, in this event, thou wilt not fail me a
second time."</p>

<p>"I swear, Harmachis!&mdash;I swear! May everlasting torments,
too hideous to be dreamed&mdash;more hideous, even, by far, than
those that wring me now&mdash;be my portion if I fail thee in one
jot or tittle &mdash;ay, though I wait a lifetime for thy
word!"</p>

<p>"It is well; see that thou keep the oath&mdash;not twice may
we betray. I go to work out my fate; abide thou to work out
thine. Perchance our divers threads will once more mingle ere the
web be spun. Charmion, who unasked didst love me&mdash;and who,
prompted by that gentle love of thine, didst betray and ruin
me&mdash;fare thee well!"</p>

<p>She gazed wildly upon my face&mdash;she stretched out her arms
as though to clasp me; then, in the agony of her despair, she
cast herself at length and grovelled upon the ground.</p>

<p>I took up the sack of clothing and the staff and gained the
door, and, as I passed it, I threw one last glance upon her.
There she lay, with arms outstretched&mdash;more white than her
white robes&mdash;her dark hair streaming about her, and her fair
brows hidden in the dust.</p>

<p>And thus I left her, nor did I again set my eyes upon her till
nine long years had come and gone.</p>

<p class="first">MADE my way down the stair in safety, and
presently stood in the courtyard of that great house. It was but
an hour from dawn, and none were stirring. The last reveller had
drunk his fill, the dancing-girls had ceased their dancing, and
silence lay upon the city. I drew near the gate, and was
challenged by an officer who stood on guard, wrapped in a heavy
cloak.</p>

<p>"Who passes," said the voice of Brennus.</p>

<p>"A merchant, may it please you, Sir, who, having brought gifts
from Alexandria to a lady of the Queen's household, and, having
been entertained of the lady, now departs to his galley," I
answered in a feigned voice.</p>

<p>"Umph!" he growled. "The ladies of the Queen's household keep
their guests late. Well; it is a time of festival. The pass-word,
Sir Shopkeeper? Without the pass-word you must needs return and
crave the lady's further hospitality."</p>

<p>"'<i>Antony</i>,' Sir; and a right good word, too. Ah! I've
wandered far, and never saw I so goodly a man or so great a
general. And, mark you, Sir! I've travelled far, and seen many
generals."</p>

<p>"Ay; '<i>Antony</i>''s the word! And Antony is a good general
in his way &mdash;when it is a sober way, and when he cannot find
a skirt to follow. I've served with Antony&mdash;and against him,
too; and know his points. Well, well; he's got an armful
now!"</p>

<p>And all this while that he was holding me in talk, the sentry
had been pacing to and fro before the gate. But now he moved a
little way to the right, leaving the entrance clear.</p>

<p>"Fare thee well, Harmachis, and begone!" whispered Brennus,
leaning forward and speaking quickly. "Linger not. But at times
bethink thee of Brennus who risked his neck to save thine.
Farewell, lad, I would that we were sailing North together," and
he turned his back upon me and began to hum a tune.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Brennus, thou honest man," I answered, and was
gone. And, as I heard long afterwards, when on the morrow the hue
and cry was raised because the murderers could not find me,
though they sought me everywhere to slay me, Brennus did me a
service. For he swore that as he kept his watch alone an hour
after midnight he saw me come and stand upon the parapet of the
roof, that then I stretched out my robes and they became wings on
which I floated up to Heaven, leaving him astonished. And all
those about the Court lent ear to this history, believing in it,
because of the great fame of my magic; and they wondered much
what the marvel might portend. The tale also travelled into
Egypt, and did much to save my good name among those whom I had
betrayed; for the more ignorant among them believed that I acted
not of my will, but of the will of the dread Gods, who of their
own purpose wafted me into Heaven. And thus to this day the
saying runs that "<i>When Harmachis comes again Egypt shall be
free.</i>" But alas, Harmachis comes no more! Only Cleopatra,
though she was much afraid, doubted her of the tale, and sent an
armed vessel to search for the Syrian merchant, but not to find
him, as shall be told.</p>

<p>When I reached the galley of which Charmion had spoken, I
found her about to sail, and gave the writing to the captain, who
conned it, looking on me curiously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>So I went aboard, and immediately we dropped swiftly down the
river with the current. And having come to the mouth of the river
unchallenged, though we passed many vessels, we put out to sea
with a strong favouring wind that before night freshened to a
great gale. Then the sailor men, being much afraid, would have
put about and run for the mouth of Cydnus again, but could not
because of the wildness of the sea. All that night it blew
furiously, and by dawn our mast was carried away, and we rolled
helplessly in the trough of the great waves. But I sat wrapped in
a cloak, little heeding; and because I showed no fear the sailors
cried out that I was a wizard, and sought to cast me into the
sea, but the captain would not. At dawn the wind slackened, but
ere noon it once more blew in terrible fury, and at the fourth
hour from noon we came in sight of the rocky coast of that cape
in the island of Cyprus which is called Dinaretum, where is a
mountain named Olympus, and thither-wards we drifted swiftly.
Then, when the sailors saw the terrible rocks, and how the great
waves that smote on them spouted up in foam, once more they grew
much afraid, and cried out in their fear. For, seeing that I
still sat unmoved, they swore that I certainly was a wizard, and
came to cast me forth as a sacrifice to the Gods of the sea. And
this time the captain was over-ruled, and said nothing.
Therefore, when they came to me I rose and defied them, saying,
"Cast me forth, if ye will; but if ye cast me forth ye shall
perish."</p>

<p>For in my heart I cared little, having no more any love of
life, but rather a desire to die, though I greatly feared to pass
into the presence of my Holy Mother Isis. But my weariness and
sorrow at the bitterness of my lot overcame even this heavy fear;
so that when, being mad as brute beasts, they seized me and,
lifting me, hurled me into the raging waters, I did but utter one
prayer to Isis and made ready for death. But it was fated that I
should not die; for, when I rose to the surface of the water, I
saw a spar of wood floating near me, to which I swam and clung.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-1st-25"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="1306521h-images/Cleopatra-24.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I saw a spar of wood to which I swam."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And a great wave came and swept me, riding, as it were, upon the spar, as when a boy I had learned to do in the waters of the
Nile, past the bulwarks of the galley where the fierce-faced
sailors clustered to see me drown. And when they saw me come
mounted on the wave, cursing them as I came, and saw, too, that
the colour of my face had changed&mdash;for the salt water had
washed way the pigment, they shrieked with fear and threw
themselves down upon the deck. And within a very little while, as
I rode toward the rocky coast, a great wave poured into the
vessel, that rolled broadside on, and pressed her down into the
deep, whence she rose no more.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-ILN-06"></a>
<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
"And a great wave came and swept me, riding, as it<br>
were, upon the spar, past the bulwarks of the galley."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>So she sank with all her crew. And in that same storm also
sank the galley which Cleopatra had sent to search for the Syrian
merchant. Thus all traces of me were lost, and of a surety she
believed that I was dead.</p>

<p>But I rode on toward the shore. The wind shrieked and the salt
waves lashed my face as, alone with the tempest, I rushed upon my
way, while the sea- birds screamed about my head. I felt no fear,
but rather a wild uplifting of the heart; and in the stress of my
imminent peril the love of life seemed to waken again. And so I
plunged and drifted, now tossed high toward the lowering clouds,
now cast into the deep valleys of the sea, till at length the
rocky headland loomed before me, and I saw the breakers smite
upon the stubborn rocks, and through the screaming of the wind
heard the sullen thunder of their fall and the groan of stones
sucked seaward from the beach. On! high-throned upon the mane of
a mighty billow&mdash;fifty cubits beneath me the level of the
hissing waters; above me the inky sky! It was done! The spar was
torn from me, and, dragged downwards by the weight of the bag of
gold and the clinging of my garments, I sank struggling
furiously.</p>

<p>Now I was under&mdash;the green light for a moment streamed
through the waters, and then came darkness, and on the darkness
pictures of the past. Picture after picture&mdash;all the long
scene of life was written here. Then in my ears I only heard the
song of the nightingale, the murmur of the summer sea, and the
music of Cleopatra's laugh of victory, following me softly and
yet more soft as I sank away to sleep.</p>

<p>Once more my life came back, and with it a sense of deadly
sickness and of aching pain. I opened my eyes and saw a kind face
bending over me, and knew that I was in the room of a builded
house.</p>

<p>"How came I hither?" I asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Of a truth, Poseidon brought thee, Stranger," answered a
rough voice in barbarous Greek; "we found thee cast high upon the
beach like a dead dolphin and brought thee to our house, for we
are fisher-folk. And here, methinks, thou must lie a while, for
thy left leg is broken by the force of the waves."</p>

<p>I strove to move my foot and could not. It was true, the bone
was broken above the knee.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, and how art thou named?" asked the rough-
bearded sailor.</p>

<p>"I am an Egyptian traveller whose ship has sunk in the fury of
the gale, and I am named Olympus," I answered, for these people
called a mountain that we had sighted Olympus, and therefore I
took the name at hazard. And as Olympus I was henceforth
known.</p>

<p>Here with these rough fisher-folk I abode for the half of a
year, paying them a little out of the sum of gold that had come
safely ashore upon me. For it was long before my bones grew
together again, and then I was left somewhat of a cripple; for I,
who had been so tall and straight and strong, now limped
&mdash;one limb being shorter than the other. And after I
recovered from my hurt, I still lived there, and toiled with them
at the trade of fishing; for I knew not whither I should go or
what I should do, and, for a while, I was fain to become a
peasant fisherman, and so wear my weary life away. And these
people entreated me kindly, though, as others, they feared me
much, holding me to be a wizard brought hither by the sea. For my
sorrows had stamped so strange an aspect on my face that men
gazing at me grew fearful of what lay beneath its calm.</p>

<p>There, then, I abode, till at length, one night as I lay and
strove to sleep, great restlessness came upon me, and a mighty
desire once more to see the face of Sihor. But whether this
desire was of the Gods or born of my own heart, not knowing, I
cannot tell. So strong was it, at the least, that before it was
dawn I rose from my bed of straw and clothed myself in my fisher
garb, and, because I had no wish to answer questions, thus I took
farewell of my humble hosts. First I placed some pieces of gold
on the well-cleaned table of wood, and then taking a pot of flour
I strewed it in the form of letters, writing:</p>

<p>"This gift from Olympus, the Egyptian, who returns into the
sea."</p>

<p>Then I went, and on the third day I came to the great city of
Salamis, that is also on the sea. Here I abode in the fishermen's
quarters till a vessel was about to sail for Alexandria, and to
the captain of this vessel, a man of Paphos, I hired myself as a
sailor. We sailed with a favouring wind, and on the fifth day I
came to Alexandria, that hateful city, and saw the light dancing
on its golden domes.</p>

<p>Here I might not abide. So again I hired myself out as a
sailor, giving my labour in return for passage, and we passed up
the Nile. And I learned from the talk of men that Cleopatra had
come back to Alexandria, drawing Antony with her and that they
lived together with royal state in the palace on the Lochias.
Indeed, the boatmen already had a song thereon, which they sang
as they laboured at the oar. Also I heard how the galley that was
sent to search for the vessel which carried the Syrian merchant
had foundered with all her crew, and the tale that the Queen's
astronomer, Harmachis, had flown to Heaven from the roof of the
house at Tarsus. And the sailors wondered because I sat and
laboured and would not sing their ribald song of the loves of
Cleopatra. For they, too, began to fear me, and mutter concerning
me among themselves. Then I knew that I was a man accursed and
set apart&mdash;a man whom none might love.</p>

<p>On the sixth day we drew nigh to Abouthis, where I left the
craft, and the sailors were right glad to see me go. And, with a
breaking heart, I walked through the fertile fields, seeing faces
that I knew well. But in my rough disguise and limping gait none
knew me. At length, as the sun sank, I came near to the great
outer pylon of the temple; and here I crouched down in the ruins
of a house, not knowing why I had come or what I was about to do.
Like a lost ox I had strayed from far, back to the fields of my
birth, and for what? If my father, Amenemhat, still lived, surely
he would turn his face from me. I dared not go into the presence
of my father. I sat hidden there among the broken rafters, and
idly watched the pylon gates, to see if, perchance, a face I knew
should issue from them. But none came forth or entered in, though
the great gates stood wide; and then I saw that herbs were
growing between the stones, where no herbs had grown for ages.
What could this be? Was the temple deserted? Nay; how could the
worship of the eternal Gods have ceased, that for thousands of
years had, day by day, been offered in the holy place? Was, then,
my father dead? It well might be. And yet, why this silence?
Where were the priests: where the worshippers?</p>

<p>I could bear the doubt no more, but as the sun sank red I
crept like a hunted jackal through the open gates, and on till I
reached the first great Hall of Pillars. Here I paused and gazed
around me&mdash;not a sight, not a sound, in the dim and holy
place! I went on with a beating heart to the second great hall,
the hall of six-and-thirty pillars where I had been crowned Lord
of all the Lands: still not a sight or a sound! Thence, half
fearful of my own footfall, so terribly did it echo in the
silence of the deserted Holies, I passed down the passage of the
names of the Pharaohs towards my father's chamber. The curtain
still swung over the doorway; but what would there be
within?&mdash;also emptiness? I lifted it, and noiselessly passed
in, and there in his carven chair at the table on which his long
white beard flowed, sat my father, Amenemhat, clad in his
priestly robes. At first I thought that he was dead, he sat so
still; but at length he turned his head, and I saw that his eyes
were white and sightless. He was blind, and his face was thin as
the face of a dead man, and woeful with age and grief.</p>

"At first I thought that he was dead."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I stood still and felt the blind eyes wandering over me. I
could not speak to him&mdash;I dared not speak to him; I would go
and hide myself afresh.</p>

<p>I had already turned and grasped the curtain, when my father
spoke in a deep, slow voice:</p>

<p>"Come hither, thou who wast my son and art a traitor. Come
hither, thou Harmachis, on whom Khem builded up her hope. Not in
vain, then, have I drawn thee from far away! Not in vain have I
held my life in me till I heard thy footfall creeping down these
empty Holies, like the footfall of a thief!"</p>

<p>"Oh! my father," I gasped, astonished. "Thou art blind: how
knowest thou me?"</p>

<p>"How do I know thee?&mdash;and askest thou that who hast
learned of our lore? Enough, I know thee and I brought thee
hither. Would, Harmachis, that I knew thee not! Would that I had
been blasted of the Invisible ere I drew thee down from the womb
of Nout, to be my curse and shame, and the last woe of Khem!"</p>

<p>"Oh, speak not thus!" I moaned; "is not my burden already more
than I can bear? Am I not myself betrayed and utterly outcast? Be
pitiful, my father!"</p>

<p>"Be pitiful!&mdash;be pitiful to thee who hast shown so great
pity? It was thy pity which gave up noble Sepa to die beneath the
hands of the tormentors!"</p>

<p>"Oh, not that&mdash;not that!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, traitor, that!&mdash;to die in agony, with his last poor
breath proclaiming thee, his murderer, honest and innocent! Be
pitiful to thee, who gavest all the flower of Khem as the price
of a wanton's arms!&mdash; thinkest thou that, labouring in the
darksome desert mines, those noble ones in thought are pitiful to
thee, Harmachis? Be pitiful to thee, by whom this Holy Temple of
Abouthis hath been ravaged, its lands seized, its priests
scattered, and I alone, old and withered, left to count out its
ruin&mdash;to thee, who hast poured the treasures of <i>Her</i>
into thy leman's lap, who hast forsworn Thyself, thy Country, thy
Birthright, and thy Gods! Yea, thus am I pitiful: Accursed be
thou, fruit of my loins!&mdash;Shame be thy portion, Agony thy
end, and Hell receive thee at the last! Where art thou? Yea, I
grew blind with weeping when I heard the truth&mdash;sure, they
strove to hide it from me. Let me find thee that I may spit upon
thee, thou Renegade! thou Apostate! thou Outcast!"&mdash;and he
rose from his seat and staggered like a living Wrath toward me,
smiting the air with his wand. And as he came with outstretched
arms, awful to see, suddenly his end found him, and with a cry he
sank down upon the ground, the red blood streaming from his lips.
I ran to him and lifted him; and as he died, he babbled:</p>

<p>"He was my son, a bright-eyed lovely boy, and full of promise
as the Spring; and now&mdash;and now&mdash;oh, would that he were
dead!"</p>

<p>Then came a pause and the breath rattled in his throat.</p>

<p>"Harmachis," he gasped, "art there?"</p>

<p>"Yea, father."</p>

<p>"Harmachis, atone!&mdash;atone! Vengeance can still be wreaked
&mdash;forgiveness may still be won. There's gold; I've hidden
it&mdash; Atoua&mdash;she can tell thee&mdash;ah, this pain!
Farewell!"</p>

<p>And he struggled faintly in my arms and was dead.</p>

<p>Thus, then, did I and my holy father, the Prince Amenemhat,
meet together for the last time in the flesh, and for the last
time part.</p>

<p class="first">CROUCHED upon the floor gazing at the dead
body of my father, who had lived to curse me, the utterly
accursed, while the darkness crept and gathered round us, till at
length the dead and I were alone in the black silence. Oh, how
tell the misery of that hour! Imagination cannot dream it, nor
words paint it forth. Once more in my wretchedness I bethought me
of death. A knife was at my girdle, with which I might cut the
thread of sorrow and set my spirit free. Free? ay, free to fly
and face the last vengeance of the Holy Gods! Alas! and alas! I
did not dare to die. Better the earth with all its woes than the
quick approach of those unimagined terrors that, hovering in dim
Amenti, wait the advent of the fallen.</p>

<p>I grovelled on the ground and wept tears of agony for the lost
unchanging past&mdash;wept till I could weep no more; but no
answer came from the silence&mdash;no answer but the echoes of my
grief. Not a ray of hope! My soul wandered in a darkness more
utter than that which was about me&mdash;I was forsaken of the
Gods and cast out of men. Terror took hold upon me crouching in
that lonely place hard by the majesty of the awful Dead. I rose
to fly. How could I fly in this gloom?&mdash;And where should I
fly who had no place of refuge? Once more I crouched down, and
the great fear grew on me till the cold sweat ran from my brow
and my soul was faint within me. Then, in my last despair, I
prayed aloud to Isis, to whom I had not dared to pray for many
days.</p>

<p>"O Isis! Holy Mother!" I cried; "put away Thy wrath, and of
Thine infinite pity, O Thou all-pitiful, hearken to the voice of
the anguish of him who was Thy son and servant, but who by sin
hath fallen from the vision of Thy love. O throned Glory, who,
being in all things, hast of all things understanding and of all
griefs knowledge, cast the weight of Thy mercy against the scale
of my evil-doing, and make the balance equal. Look down upon my
woe, and measure it; count up the sum of my repentance and take
Thou note of the flood of sorrow that sweeps my soul away. O Thou
Holy, whom it was given to me to look upon face to face, by that
dread hour of commune I summon Thee; I summon Thee by the mystic
word. Come, then, in mercy, to save me; or, in anger, to make an
end of that which can no more be borne."</p>

<p>And, rising from my knees, I stretched out my arms and dared
to cry aloud the Word of Fear, to use which unworthily is
death.</p>

<p>Swiftly the answer came. For in the silence I heard the sound
of the shaken sistra heralding the coming of the Glory. Then, at
the far end of the chamber, grew the semblance of the horned
moon, gleaming faintly in the darkness, and betwixt the golden
horns rested a small dark cloud, in and out of which the fiery
serpent climbed.</p>

<p>My knees waxed loose in the presence of the Glory, and I sank
down before it.</p>

<p>Then spake the small, sweet Voice within the cloud:</p>

<p>"Harmachis, who wast my servant and my son, I have heard thy
prayer, and the summons that thou hast dared to utter, which on
the lips of one with whom I have communed, hath power to draw Me
from the Uttermost. No more, Harmachis, may we be one in the bond
of Love Divine, for thou hast put Me away of thine own act.
Therefore, after this long silence I come, Harmachis, clothed in
terrors, and, perchance, ready for vengeance, for not lightly can
Isis be drawn from the halls of Her Divinity."</p>

<p>"Smite, Goddess!" I answered. "Smite, and give me over to
those who wreak Thy vengeance; for I can no longer bear the
burden of my woe!"</p>

<p>"And if thou canst not bear thy burden here, upon this upper
earth," came the soft reply, "how then shalt thou bear the
greater burden that shall be laid upon thee there, coming defiled
and yet unpurified into my dim realm of Death, that is Life and
Change unending? Nay, Harmachis, I smite thee not, for not all am
I wroth that thou hast dared to utter the awful Word which calls
Me down to thee. Hearken, Harmachis; I praise not, and I reproach
not, for I am the Minister of Reward and Punishment and the
Executrix of Decrees; and if I give, I give in silence; and if I
smite, in silence do I smite. Therefore, I will add naught to thy
burden by the weight of heavy words, though through thee it has
come to pass that soon shall Isis, the Mother-Mystery, be but a
memory in Egypt. Thou hast sinned, and heavy shall be thy
punishment, as I did warn thee, both in the flesh and in my
kingdom of Amenti. But I told thee that there is a road of
repentance, and surely thy feet are set thereon, and therein must
thou walk with a humble heart, eating of the bread of bitterness,
till such time as thy doom be measured."</p>

<p>"Have I, then, no hope, O holy?"</p>

<p>"That which is done, Harmachis, is done, nor can its issues be
altered. Khem shall no more be free till all its temples are as
the desert dust; strange Peoples shall, from age to age, hold her
hostage and in bonds; new Religions shall arise and wither within
the shadow of her pyramids, for to every World, Race, and Age the
countenances of the Gods are changed. This is the tree that shall
spring from thy seed of sin, Harmachis, and from the sin of those
who tempted thee!"</p>

<p>"Alas! I am undone!" I cried.</p>

<p>"Yea, thou art undone; and yet shall this be given to thee:
thy Destroyer thou shalt destroy&mdash;for so, in the purpose of
my justice, it is ordained. When the sign comes to thee, arise,
go to Cleopatra, and in such manner as I shall put into thy heart
do Heaven's vengeance upon her! And now for thyself one word, for
thou hast put Me from thee, Harmachis, and no more shall I come
face to face with thee till, cycles hence, the last fruit of thy
sin hath ceased to be upon this earth! Yet, through the vastness
of the unnumbered years, remember thou this: the Love Divine is
Love Eternal, which cannot be extinguished, though it be
everlastingly estranged. Repent, my son; repent and do well while
there is yet time, that at the dim end of ages thou mayest once
more be gathered unto Me. Still, Harmachis, though thou seest Me
not; still, when the very name by which thou knowest Me has
become a meaningless mystery to those who shall be after thee;
still I, whose hours are eternal&mdash;I, who have watched
Universes wither, wane, and, beneath the breath of Time, melt
into nothingness; again to gather, and, re-born, thread the maze
of space&mdash;still, I say, I shall companion thee. Wherever
thou goest, in whatever form of life thou livest, there I shall
be! Art thou wafted to the farthest star, art thou buried in
Amenti's lowest deep&mdash;in lives, in deaths, in sleeps, in
wakings, in remembrances, in oblivions, in all the fevers of the
outer Life, in all the changes of the Spirit&mdash;still, if thou
wilt but atone and forget Me no more, I shall be with thee,
waiting thine hour of redemption. For this is the nature of Love
Divine, wherewith it loves that which partakes of its divinity
and by the holy tie hath once been bound to it. Judge then,
Harmachis: was it well to put this from thee to win the dust of
earthly woman? And, now, dare not again to utter the Word of
Power till these things are done! Harmachis, for this season,
fare thee well!"</p>

<p>As the last note of the sweet Voice died away, the fiery snake
climbed into the heart of the cloud. Now the cloud rolled from
the horns of light, and was gathered into the blackness. The
vision of the crescent moon grew dim and vanished. Then, as the
Goddess passed, once more came the faint and dreadful music of
the shaken sistra, and all was still.</p>

<p>I hid my face in my robe, and even then, though my
outstretched hand could touch the chill corpse of that father who
had died cursing me, I felt hope come back into my heart, knowing
that I was not altogether lost nor utterly rejected of Her whom I
had forsaken, but whom I yet loved. And then weariness
overpowered me, and I slept.</p>

<p>I woke, the faint lights of dawn were creeping from the
opening in the roof. Ghastly they lay upon the shadowy sculptured
walls and ghastly upon the dead face and white beard of my
father, the gathered to Osiris. I started up, remembering all
things, and wondering in my heart what I should do, and as I rose
I heard a faint footfall creeping down the passage of the names
of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>"<i>La! La! La!</i>" mumbled a voice that I knew for the voice
of the old wife, Atoua. "Why, 'tis dark as the House of the Dead!
The Holy Ones who built this Temple loved not the blessed sun,
however much they worshipped him. Now, where's the curtain?"</p>

<p>Presently it was drawn, and Atoua entered, a stick in one hand
and a basket in the other. Her face was somewhat more wrinkled,
and her scanty locks were somewhat whiter than aforetime, but for
the rest she was as she had ever been. She stood and peered
around with her sharp black eyes, for as yet she could see
nothing because of the shadows.</p>

<p>"Now where is he?" she muttered. "Osiris&mdash;glory to His
name &mdash;send that he has not wandered in the night, and he
blind! Alack! that I could not return before the dark. Alack! and
alack! what times have we fallen on, when the Holy High Priest
and the Governor, by descent, of Abouthis, is left with one aged
crone to minister to his infirmity! O Harmachis, my poor boy,
thou hast laid trouble at our doors! Why, what's this? Surely he
sleeps not, there upon the ground?&mdash;'twill be his death!
Prince! Holy Father! Amenemhat! awake, arise!" and she hobbled
towards the corpse. "Why, how is it! By Him who sleeps, he's
dead! untended and alone&mdash;<i>dead! dead!</i>" and she sent
her long wail of grief ringing up the sculptured walls.</p>

<p>"Hush! woman, be still!" I said, gliding from the shadows.</p>

<p>"Oh, what art thou?" she cried, casting down her basket.
"Wicked man, hast thou murdered this Holy One, the only Holy One
in Egypt? Surely the curse will fall on thee, for though the Gods
do seem to have forsaken us now in our hour of trial, yet is
their arm long, and certainly they will be avenged on him who
hath slain their anointed!"</p>

<p>"Look on me, Atoua," I cried.</p>

<p>"Look! ay, I look&mdash;thou wicked wanderer who hast dared
this cruel deed! Harmachis is a traitor and lost far away, and
Amenemhat his holy father is murdered, and now I'm all alone
without kith or kin. I gave them for him. I gave them for
Harmachis, the traitor! Come, slay me also, thou wicked one!"</p>

<p>I took a step toward her, and she, thinking that I was about
to smite her, cried out in fear:</p>

<p>"Nay, good Sir, spare me! Eighty and six, by the Holy Ones,
eighty and six, come next flood of Nile, and yet I would not die,
though Osiris is merciful to the old who served him! Come no
nearer&mdash;help! help!"</p>

<p>"Thou fool, be silent," I said; "knowest thou me not?"</p>

<p>"Know thee? Can I know every wandering boatman to whom Sebek
grants to earn a livelihood till Typhon claims his own? And
yet&mdash;why, 'tis strange&mdash;that changed
countenance!&mdash;that scar!&mdash;that stumbling gait! It is
thou, Harmachis!&mdash;'tis thou, O my boy! Art come back to glad
mine old eyes? I hoped thee dead! Let me kiss thee?&mdash;nay, I
forget. Harmachis is a traitor, ay, and a murderer! Here lies the
holy Amenemhat, murdered by the traitor, Harmachis! Get thee
gone! I'll have none of traitors and of parricides! Get thee to
thy wanton!&mdash;it is not thou whom I did nurse."</p>

<p>"Peace! woman; peace! I slew not my father&mdash;he died,
alas! &mdash;he died even in my arms."</p>

<p>"Ay, surely, and cursing thee, Harmachis! Thou hast given
death to him who gave thee life! <i>La! la!</i> I am old, and
I've seen many a trouble; but this is the heaviest of them all! I
never liked the looks of mummies; but I would I were one this
hour! Get thee gone, I pray thee!"</p>

<p>"Old nurse, reproach me not! Have I not enough to bear?"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, yes!&mdash;I did forget! Well; and what is thy sin?
A woman was thy bane, as women have been to those before thee,
and shall be to those after thee. And what a woman! <i>La!
la!</i> I saw her, a beauty such as never was&mdash;an arrow
pointed by the evil Gods for destruction! And thou, a young man
bred as a priest&mdash;an ill training&mdash;a very ill training!
'Twas no fair match. Who can wonder that she mastered thee? Come,
Harmachis; let me kiss thee! It is not for a woman to be hard on
a man because he loved our sex too much. Why, that is but nature;
and Nature knows her business, else she had made us otherwise.
But here is an evil case. Knowest thou that this Macedonian Queen
of thine hath seized the temple lands and revenues, and driven
away the priests&mdash;all, save the holy Amenemhat, who lies
here, and whom she left, I know not why; ay, and caused the
worship of the Gods to cease within these walls. Well, he's
gone!&mdash;he's gone! and indeed he is better with Osiris, for
his life was a sore burden to him. And hark thou, Harmachis: he
hath not left thee empty-handed; for, so soon as the plot failed,
he gathered all his wealth, and it is large, and hid it&mdash;
where, I can show thee&mdash;and it is thine by right of
descent."</p>

<p>"Talk not to me of wealth, Atoua. Where shall I go and how
shall I hide my shame?"</p>

<p>"Ah! true, true; here mayst thou not abide, for if they found
thee, surely they would put thee to the dreadful death&mdash;ay,
to the death by the waxen cloth. Nay, I will hide thee, and, when
the funeral rites of the holy Amenemhat have been performed, we
will fly hence, and cover us from the eyes of men till these
sorrows are forgotten. <i>La! la!</i> it is a sad world, and full
of trouble as the Nile mud is full of beetles. Come, Harmachis,
come."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HESE things then came to pass. For eighty days
I was hidden of the old wife, Atoua, while the body of the
Prince, my father, was made ready for burial by those skilled in
the arts of embalming. And when at last all things were done in
order, I crept from my hiding-place and made offerings to the
spirit of my father, and placing lotus-flowers on his breast went
thence sorrowing. And on the following day, from where I lay hid,
I saw the Priests of the Temple of Osiris and of the holy shrine
of Isis come forth, and in slow procession bear his painted
coffin to the sacred lake and lay it beneath the funeral tent in
the consecrated boat. I saw them celebrate the symbol of the
trial of the dead, and name him above all men just, and then bear
him thence to lay him by his wife, my mother, in the deep tomb
that he had hewn in the rock near to the resting-place of the
Holy Osiris, where, notwithstanding my sins, I, too, hope to
sleep ere long. And when all these things were done and the deep
tomb sealed, the wealth of my father having been removed from the
hidden treasury and placed in safety, I fled, disguised, with the
old wife, Atoua, up the Nile till we came to Tápé (21), and here in this great city I lay a while, till a place could be found where I should hide myself.</p>

<p class="footnote">21. Thebes.&mdash;Editor.</p>

<p>And such a place I found. For to the north of the great city
are brown and rugged hills, and desert valley blasted of the sun,
and in this place of desolation the Divine Pharaohs, my
forefathers, hollowed out their tombs in the solid rock, the most
part of which are lost to this day, so cunningly have they been
hidden. But some are open, for the accursed Persians and other
thieves broke into them in search of treasure. And one
night&mdash;for by night only did I leave my hiding-
place&mdash;just as the dawn was breaking on the mountain tops, I
wandered alone in this sad valley of death, like to which there
is no other, and presently came to the mouth of a tomb hidden
amid great rocks, which afterwards I knew for the place of the
burying of the Divine Rameses, the third of that name, now long
gathered to Osiris. And by the faint light of the dawn creeping
through the entrance I saw that it was spacious and that within
were chambers.</p>

<p>On the following night, therefore, I returned, bearing lights,
with Atoua, my nurse, who ever ministered faithfully to me as
when I was little and without discretion. And we searched the
mighty tomb and came to the great Hall of the Sarcophagus of
granite, in which the Divine Rameses sleeps, and saw the mystic
paintings on the walls: the symbol of the Snake unending, the
symbol of Ra resting upon the Scarabaeus, the symbol of Ra
resting upon Nout, the symbol of the Headless men, and many
others, whereof, being initiated, well I read the mysteries. And
opening from the long descending passage I found chambers in
which were paintings beautiful to behold, and of all manner of
things. For beneath each chamber is entombed the master of the
craft of which the paintings tell, he who was the chief of the
servants of that craft in the house of this Divine Rameses. And
on the walls of the last chamber&mdash;on the left-hand side,
looking toward the Hall of the Sarcophagus&mdash;are paintings
exceedingly beautiful, and two blind harpers playing upon their
bent harps before the God Mou; and beneath the flooring these
harpers, who harp no more, are soft at sleep. Here, then, in this
gloomy place, even in the tomb of the Harpers and the company of
the dead, I took up my abode; and here for eight long years I
worked out my penance and made atonement for my sin. But Atoua,
because she loved to be near the light, abode in the chamber of
the Boats &mdash;that is, the first chamber on the right-hand
side of the gallery looking toward the Hall of the
Sarcophagus.</p>

<p>And this was the manner of my life. On every second day the
old wife, Atoua, went forth and brought water from the city and
such food as is necessary to keep the life from failing, and also
tapers made from fat. And one hour at the time of sunrise and one
hour at the time of sunset I did go forth also to wander in the
valley for my health's sake and to save my sight from failing in
the great darkness of the tomb. But the other hours of the day
and night, except when I climbed the mountain to watch the course
of the stars, I spent in prayer and meditation and sleep, till
the cloud of sin lifted from my heart and once more I drew near
to the Gods, though with Isis, my heavenly Mother, I might speak
no more. And I grew exceedingly wise also, pondering on all those
mysteries to which I held the key. For abstinence and prayer and
sorrowful solitude wore away the grossness of my flesh, and with
the eyes of the Spirit I learned to look deep into the heart of
things till the joy of Wisdom fell like dew upon my soul.</p>

<p>Soon the rumour was wafted about the city that a certain holy
man named Olympus abode in solitude in the tombs of the awful
Valley of the Dead; and hither came people bearing sick that I
might cure them. And I gave my mind to the study of simples, in
which Atoua instructed me; and by lore and the weight of my
thought I gained great skill in medicine, and healed many sick.
And thus ever, as time went on, my fame was noised abroad; for it
was said that I was also a magician and that in the tombs I had
commune with the Spirits of the Dead. And this, indeed, I
did&mdash;though it is not lawful for me to speak of these
matters. Thus, then, it came to pass that no more need Atoua go
forth to seek food and water, for the people brought
it&mdash;more than was needful, for I would receive no fee. Now
at first, fearing lest some in the hermit Olympus might know the
lost Harmachis, I would only meet those who came in the darkness
of the tomb. But afterwards, when I learned how it was held
through all the land that Harmachis was certainly no more, I came
forth and sat in the mouth of the tomb, and ministered to the
sick, and at times calculated nativities for the great. And thus
my fame grew continually, till at length folk journeyed even from
Memphis and Alexandria to visit me; and from them I learned how
Antony had left Cleopatra for a while, and, Fulvia being dead,
had married Octavia, the sister of Caesar. Many other things I
learned also.</p>

<p>And in the second year I did this: I despatched the old wife,
Atoua, disguised as a seller of simples, to Alexandria, bidding
her seek out Charmion, and, if yet she found her faithful, reveal
to her the secret of my way of life. So she went, and in the
fifth month from her sailing returned, bearing Charmion's
greetings and a token. And she told me that she had found means
to see Charmion, and, in talk, had let fall the name of
Harmachis, speaking of me as one dead; at which Charmion, unable
to control her grief, wept aloud. Then, reading her
heart&mdash;for the old wife was very clever, and held the key of
knowledge&mdash;she told her that Harmachis yet lived, and sent
her greetings. Thereon Charmion wept yet more with joy, and
kissed the old wife, and made her gifts, bidding her tell me that
she had kept her vow, and waited for my coming and the hour of
vengeance. So, having learned many secrets, Atoua returned again
to Tápé.</p>

<p>And in the following year messengers came to me from
Cleopatra, bearing a sealed roll and great gifts. I opened the
roll, and read this in it:</p>

<p>"Cleopatra to Olympus, the learned Egyptian who dwells in the
Valley of Death by Tápé -</p>

<p>"The fame of thy renown, O learned Olympus, hath reached our
ears. Tell thou, then, this to us, and if thou tellest aright
greater honour and wealth shalt thou have than any in Egypt: How
shall we win back the love of noble Antony, who is bewitched of
cunning Octavia, and tarries long from us?"</p>

<p>Now, in this I saw the hand of Charmion, who had made my
renown known to Cleopatra.</p>

<p>All that night I took counsel with my wisdom, and on the
morrow wrote my answer as it was put into my heart to the
destruction of Cleopatra and Antony. And thus I wrote:</p>

<p>"Olympus the Egyptian to Cleopatra the Queen -</p>

<p>"Go forth into Syria with one who shall be sent to lead thee;
thus shalt thou win Antony to thy arms again, and with him gifts
more great than thou canst dream."</p>

<p>And with this letter I dismissed the messengers, bidding them
share the presents sent by Cleopatra among their company.</p>

<p>So they went wondering.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra, seizing on the advice to which her passion
prompted her, departed straightway with Fonteius Capito into
Syria, and there the thing came about as I had foretold, for
Antony was subdued of her and gave her the greater part of
Cilicia, the ocean shore of Arabia Nabathaea, the balm-bearing
provinces of Judaea, the province of Phoenicia, the province of
Coele-Syria, the rich isle of Cyprus, and all the library of
Pergamus. And to the twin children that, with the son Ptolemy,
Cleopatra had borne to Antony, he impiously gave the names of
"Kings, the Children of Kings"&mdash;of Alexander Helios, as the
Greeks name the sun, and of Cleopatra Selene, the moon, the long-
winged.</p>

<p>These things then came to pass.</p>

<p>Now on her return to Alexandria Cleopatra sent me great gifts,
of which I would have none, and prayed me, the learned Olympus,
to come to her at Alexandria; but it was not yet time, and I
would not. But thereafter she and Antony sent many times to me
for counsel, and I ever counselled them to their ruin, nor did my
prophecies fail.</p>

<p>Thus the long years rolled away, and I, the hermit Olympus,
the dweller in a tomb, the eater of bread and the drinker of
water, by strength of the wisdom that was given me of the
avenging Power, became once more great in Khem. For I grew ever
wiser as I trampled the desires of the flesh beneath my feet and
turned my eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>At length eight full years were accomplished. The war with the
Parthians had come and gone, and Artavasdes, King of Armenia, had
been led in triumph through the streets of Alexandria. Cleopatra
had visited Samos and Athens; and, by her counselling, the noble
Octavia had been driven, like some discarded concubine, from the
house of Antony at Rome. And now, at the last, the measure of the
folly of Antony was full even to the brim. For this Master of the
World had no longer the good gift of reason; he was lost in
Cleopatra as I had been lost. Therefore, in the event, Octavianus
declared war against him.</p>

<p>And as I slept upon a certain day in the chamber of the
Harpers, in the tomb of Pharaoh that is by Tápé, there came to me
a vision of my father, the aged Amenemhat, and he stood over me,
leaning on his staff, and spoke, saying:</p>

<p>"Look forth, my son."</p>

<p>Then I looked forth, and with the eyes of my spirit saw the
sea, and two great fleets grappling in war hard by a rocky coast.
And the emblems were those of Octavian, and of the other those of
Cleopatra and Antony. The ships of Antony and Cleopatra bore down
upon the ships of Caesar, and drove them on, for victory inclined
to Antony.</p>

<p>I looked again. There sat Cleopatra in a gold-decked galley
watching the fight with eager eyes. Then I cast my Spirit on her
so that she seemed to hear the voice of dead Harmachis crying in
her ear.</p>

<p>"<i>Fly, Cleopatra,</i>" it seemed to say, "<i>fly or
perish!</i>"</p>

<p>She looked up wildly, and again she heard my Spirit's cry. Now
a mighty fear took hold of her. She called aloud to the sailors
to hoist the sails and make signal to her fleet to put about.
This they did wondering but little loath, and fled in haste from
the battle.</p>

<p>Then a great roar went up from friend and foe.</p>

<p>"Cleopatra is fled! Cleopatra is fled!" And I saw wreck and
red ruin fall upon the fleet of Antony and awoke from my
trance.</p>

<p>The days passed, and again a vision of my father came to me
and spoke, saying:</p>

<p>"Arise, my son!&mdash;the hour of vengeance is at hand! Thy
plots have not failed; thy prayers have been heard. By the
bidding of the Gods, as she sat in her galley at the fight of
Actium, the heart of Cleopatra was filled with fears, so that,
deeming she heard thy voice bidding her fly or perish, she fled
with all her fleet. Now the strength of Actium is broken on the
sea. Go forth, and as it shall be put into thy mind, so do
thou."</p>

<p>In the morning I awoke, wondering, and went to the mouth of
the tomb, and there, coming up the valley, I saw the messengers
of Cleopatra, and with them a Roman guard.</p>

"I saw the messengers of Cleopatra, and with them a Roman guard."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"What will ye with me now?" I asked, sternly.</p>

<p>"This is the message of the Queen and of great Antony,"
answered the Captain, bowing low before me, for I was much feared
by all men. "The Queen commands thy presence at Alexandria. Many
times has she sent, and thou wouldst not come; now she bids thee
to come, and that swiftly, for she has need of thy counsel."</p>

<p>"And if I say Nay, soldier, what then?"</p>

<p>"These are my orders, most holy Olympus; that I bring thee by
force."</p>

<p>I laughed aloud. "By force, thou fool! Use not such talk to
me, lest I smite thee where thou art. Know, then, that I can kill
as well as cure!"</p>

<p>"Pardon, I beseech thee!" he answered, shrinking. "I say but
those things that I am bid."</p>

<p>"Well, I know it, Captain. Fear not; I come."</p>

<p>So on that very day I departed, together with the aged Atoua.
Ay, I went as secretly as I had come; and the tomb of the Divine
Rameses knew me no more. And with me I took all the treasures of
my father, Amenemhat, for I was not minded to go to Alexandria
empty-handed and as a suppliant, but rather as a man of much
wealth and condition. Now, as I went, I learned that Antony,
following Cleopatra, had, indeed, fled from Actium, and knew that
the end drew nigh. For this and many other things had I foreseen
in the darkness of the tomb of Tápé, and planned to bring
about.</p>

<p>Thus, then, I came to Alexandria, and entered into a house
which had been made ready for me at the palace gates.</p>

<p>And that very night Charmion came to me&mdash;Charmion whom I
had not seen for nine long years.</p>

Of The Meeting Of Charmion With The Learned Olympus,<br>

And<br>
Of The Commands Of Cleopatra</p>
<br>

style="float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<br>

<p class="first">LAD in my plain black robe, I sat in the
guest-chamber of the house that had been made ready for me. I sat
in a carven lion-footed chair, and looked upon the swinging lamps
of scented oil, the pictured tapestries, the rich Syrian
rugs&mdash;and, amidst all this luxury, bethought me of that tomb
of the Harpers which is at Tápé, and of the nine long years of
dark loneliness and preparation. I sat; and crouched upon a rug
near to the door, lay the aged Atoua. Her hair was white as snow,
and shrivelled with age was the wrinkled countenance of the woman
who, when all deserted me, had yet clung to me, in her great love
forgetting my great sins. Nine years! nine long years! and now,
once again, I set my foot in Alexandria! Once again in the
appointed circle of things I came forth from the solitude of
preparation to be a fate to Cleopatra; and this second time I
came not forth to fail.</p>

<p>And yet how changed the circumstance! I was out of the story:
my part now was but the part of the sword in the hands of
Justice; I might no more hope to make Egypt free and great and
sit upon my lawful throne. Khem was lost, and lost was I,
Harmachis. In the rush and turmoil of events, the great plot of
which I had been the pivot was covered up and forgotten; scarce a
memory of it remained. The curtain of dark night was closing in
upon the history of my ancient Race; its very Gods were tottering
to their fall; I could already, in the spirit, hear the shriek of
the Roman eagles as they flapped their wings above the furthest
banks of Sihor.</p>

<p>Presently I roused myself and bade Atoua go seek a mirror and
bring it to me, that I might look therein.</p>

<p>And I saw this: a face shrunken and pallid, on which no smile
came; great eyes grown wan with gazing into darkness looking out
beneath the shaven head, emptily, as the hollow eye-pits of a
skull; a wizened halting form wasted by abstinence, sorrow, and
prayer; a long wild beard of iron grey; thin blue-veined hands
that ever trembled like a leaf; bowed shoulders and lessened
limbs. Time and grief had done their work indeed; scarce could I
think myself the same as when, the royal Harmachis&mdash;in all
the splendour of my strength and youthful beauty&mdash;I first
had looked upon the woman's loveliness that did destroy me. And
yet within me burned the same fire as of yore; yet I was not
changed, for time and grief have no power to alter the immortal
spirit of man. Seasons may come and go; Hope, like a bird, may
fly away; Passion may break its wings against the iron bars of
Fate; Illusions may crumble as the cloudy towers of sunset flame;
Faith, as running water, may slip from beneath our feet; Solitude
may stretch itself around us like the measureless desert sand;
Old Age may creep as the gathering night over our bowed heads
grown hoary in their shame&mdash;yea, bound to Fortune's wheel,
we may taste of every turn of chance&mdash;now rule as Kings, now
serve as Slaves; now love, now hate; now prosper, and now perish.
But still, through all, we are the same; for this is the marvel
of Identity.</p>

<p>And as I sat and thought these things in bitterness of heart,
there came a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>"Open, Atoua!" I said.</p>

<p>She rose and did my bidding; and a woman entered, clad in
Grecian robes. It was Charmion, still beautiful as of old, but
sad faced now and very sweet to see, with a patient fire
slumbering in her downcast eyes.</p>

<p>She entered unattended; and, speaking no word, the old wife
pointed to where I sat, and went.</p>

<p>"Old man," she said, addressing me, "lead me to the learned
Olympus. I come upon the Queen's business."</p>

<p>I rose, and, lifting my head, looked upon her.</p>

<p>She gazed, and gave a little cry.</p>

<p>"Surely," she whispered, glancing round, "surely thou art not
that &mdash;" And she paused.</p>

<p>"That Harmachis whom once thy foolish heart did love, O
Charmion? Yes, I am he and what thou seest, most fair lady. Yet
is Harmachis dead whom thou didst love; but Olympus, the skilled
Egyptian, waits upon thy words!"</p>

<p>"Cease!" she said, "and of the past but one word, and
then&mdash;why, let it lie. Not well, with all thy wisdom, canst
thou know a true woman's heart, if thou dost believe, Harmachis,
that it can change with the changes of the outer form, for then
assuredly could no love follow its beloved to that last place of
change&mdash;the Grave. Know thou, learned Physician, I am of
that sort who, loving once, love always, and being not beloved
again, go virgin to the death."</p>

<p>She ceased, and having naught to say, I bowed my head in
answer. Yet though I said nothing and though this woman's
passionate folly had been the cause of all our ruin, to speak
truth, in secret I was thankful to her who, wooed of all and
living in this shameless Court, had still through the long years
poured out her unreturned love upon an outcast, and who, when
that poor broken slave of Fortune came back in such unlovely
guise, held him yet dear at heart. For what man is there who does
not prize that gift most rare and beautiful, that one perfect
thing which no gold can buy&mdash;a woman's unfeigned love?</p>

<p>"I thank thee that thou dost not answer," she said; "for the
bitter words which thou didst pour upon me in those days that
long are dead, and far away in Tarsus, have not lost their
poisonous sting, and in my heart is no more place for the arrows
of thy scorn, new venomed through thy solitary years. So let it
be. Behold! I put it from me, that wild passion of my soul," and
she looked up and stretched out her hands as though to press some
unseen presence back, "I put it from me&mdash;though forget it I
may not! There, 'tis done, Harmachis; no more shall my love
trouble thee. Enough for me that once more my eyes behold thee,
before sleep seals thee from their sight. Dost remember how, when
I would have died by thy dear hand, thou wouldst not slay, but
didst bid me live to pluck the bitter fruit of crime, and be
accursed by visions of the evil I had wrought and memories of
thee whom I have ruined?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Charmion, I remember well."</p>

<p>"Surely the cup of punishment has been filled. Oh! couldst
thou see into the record of my heart, and read in it the
suffering that I have borne&mdash; borne with a smiling
face&mdash;thy justice would be satisfied indeed!"</p>

<p>"And yet, if report be true, Charmion, thou art the first of
all the Court, and therein the most powerful and beloved. Does
not Octavianus give it out that he makes war, not on Antony, nor
even on his mistress, Cleopatra, but on Charmion and Iras?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Harmachis, and think that it has been to me thus,
because of my oath to thee, to be forced to eat the bread and do
the tasks of one whom so bitterly I hate!&mdash;one who robbed me
of thee, and who, through the workings of my jealousy, brought me
to be that which I am, brought thee to shame, and all Egypt to
its ruin! Can jewels and riches and the flattery of princes and
nobles bring happiness to such a one as I, who am more wretched
than the meanest scullion wench? Oh, I have often wept till I was
blind; and then, when the hour came, I must arise and tire me,
and, with a smile, go do the bidding of the Queen and that heavy
Antony. May the Gods grant me to see them dead&mdash;ay, the
twain of them!&mdash;then myself I shall be content to die! Thy
lot has been hard, Harmachis; but at least thou have been free,
and many is the time that I have envied thee the quiet of thy
haunted cave."</p>

<p>"I do perceive, O Charmion, that thou art mindful of thy
oaths; and it is well, for the hour of vengeance is at hand."</p>

<p>"I am mindful, and in all things I have worked for thee in
secret &mdash;for thee, and for the utter ruin of Cleopatra and
the Roman. I have fanned his passion and her jealousy, I have
egged her on to wickedness and him to folly, and of all have I
caused report to be brought to Caesar. Listen! thus stands the
matter. Thou knowest how went the fight at Actium. Thither went
Cleopatra with her fleet, sorely against the will of Antony. But,
as thou sentest me word, I entreated him for the Queen, vowing to
him, with tears, that, did he leave her, she would die of grief;
and he, poor slave, believed me. And so she went, and in the
thick of the fight, for what cause I know not, though perchance
thou knowest, Harmachis, she made signal to her squadron, and,
putting about fled from the battle, sailing for Peloponnesus. And
now, mark the end! When Antony saw that she was gone, he, in his
madness, took a galley, and deserting all, followed hard after
her, leaving his fleet to be shattered and sunk, and his great
army in Greece, of twenty legions and twelve thousand horse,
without a leader. And all this no man would believe, that Antony,
the smitten of the Gods, had fallen so deep in shame. Therefore
for a while the army tarried, and but now to-night comes news
brought by Canidius, the General, that, worn with doubt and being
at length sure that Antony had deserted them, the whole of his
great force has yielded to Caesar."</p>

<p>"And where, then, is Antony?"</p>

<p>"He has built him a habitation on a little isle in the Great
Harbour and named it Timonium; because, forsooth, like Timon, he
cries out at the ingratitude of mankind that has forsaken him.
And there he lies smitten by a fever of the mind, and thither
thou must go at dawn, so wills the Queen, to cure him of his ills
and draw him to her arms; for he will not see her, nor knows he
yet the full measure of his woe. But first my bidding is to lead
thee instantly to Cleopatra, who would ask thy counsel."</p>

<p>"I come," I answered, rising. "Lead thou on."</p>

<p>And so we passed the palace gates and along the Alabaster
Hall, and presently once again I stood before the door of
Cleopatra's chamber, and once again Charmion left me to warn her
of my coming.</p>

<p>Presently she came back and beckoned to me. "Make strong thy
heart," she whispered, "and see that thou dost not betray
thyself, for still are the eyes of Cleopatra keen. Enter!"</p>

<p>"Keen, indeed, must they be to find Harmachis in the learned
Olympus! Had I not willed it, thyself thou hadst not known me,
Charmion," I made answer.</p>

<p>Then I entered that remembered place and listened once more to
the plash of the fountain, the song of the nightingale, and the
murmur of the summer sea. With bowed head and halting gait I
came, till at length I stood before the couch of
Cleopatra&mdash;that same golden couch on which she had sat the
night she overcame me. Then I gathered my strength, and looked
up. There before me was Cleopatra, glorious as of old, but, oh!
how changed since that night when I saw Antony clasp her in his
arms at Tarsus! Her beauty still clothed her like a garment; the
eyes were yet deep and unfathomable as the blue sea, the face
still splendid in its great loveliness. And yet all was changed.
Time, that could not touch her charms, had stamped upon her
presence such a look of weary grief as may not be written.
Passion, beating ever in that fierce heart of hers, had written
his record on her brow, and in her eyes shone the sad lights of
sorrow.</p>

<p class="caption">"Before me was Cleopatra, but oh! how changed!"</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>I bowed low before this most royal woman, who once had been my
love and destruction, and yet knew me not.</p>

<p>She looked up wearily, and spoke in her slow, well remembered
voice:</p>

<p>"So thou art come at length, Physician. How callest thou
thyself? &mdash;Olympus? 'Tis a name of promise, for surely now
that the Gods of Egypt have deserted us, we do need aid from
Olympus. Well, thou hast a learned air, for learning does not
with beauty. Strange, too, there is that about thee which recalls
what I know not. Say, Olympus, have we met before?"</p>

<p>"Never, O Queen, have my eyes fallen on thee in the body," I
answered in a feigned voice. "Never till this hour, when I come
forth from my solitude to do thy bidding and cure thee of thy
ills!"</p>

<p>"Strange! and even in the voice&mdash;Pshaw! 'tis some memory
that I cannot catch. In the body, thou sayest? then, perchance, I
knew thee in a dream?"</p>

<p>"Ay, O Queen; we have met in dreams."</p>

<p>"Thou art a strange man, who talkest thus, but, if what I hear
be true, one well learned; and, indeed, I mind me of thy counsel
when thou didst bid me join my Lord Antony in Syria, and how
things befell according to thy word. Skilled must thou be in the
casting of nativities and in the law of auguries, of which these
Alexandrian fools have little knowledge. Once I knew such another
man, one Harmachis," and she sighed: "but he is long
dead&mdash;as I would I were also!&mdash;and at times I sorrow
for him."</p>

<p>She paused, while I sank my head upon my breast and stood
silent.</p>

<p>"Interpret me this, Olympus. In the battle at that accursed
Actium, just as the fight raged thickest and Victory began to
smile upon us, a great terror seized my heart, and thick darkness
seemed to fall before my eyes, while in my ears a voice, ay, the
voice of that long dead Harmachis, cried '<i>Fly! fly, or
perish!</i>' and I fled. But from my heart the terror leapt to
the heart of Antony, and he followed after me, and thus was the
battle lost. Say, then, what God brought this evil thing
about?"</p>

<p>"Nay, O Queen," I answered, "it was no God&mdash;for wherein
hast thou angered the Gods of Egypt? Hast thou robbed the temples
of their Faith? Hast thou betrayed the trust of Egypt? Having
done none of these things, how, then, can the Gods of Egypt be
wroth with thee? Fear not, it was nothing but some natural vapour
of the mind that overcame thy gentle soul, made sick with the
sight and sound of slaughter; and as for the noble Antony, where
thou didst go needs must that he should follow."</p>

<p>And as I spoke, Cleopatra turned white and trembled, glancing
at me the while to find my meaning. But I well knew that the
thing was of the avenging Gods, working through me, their
instrument.</p>

<p>"Learned Olympus," she said, not answering my words; "my Lord
Antony is sick and crazed with grief. Like some poor hunted slave
he hides himself in yonder sea-girt Tower and shuns
mankind&mdash;yes, he shuns even me, who, for his sake, endure so
many woes. Now, this is my bidding to thee. To-morrow, at the
coming of the light, do thou, led by Charmion, my waiting-lady,
take boat and row thee to the Tower and there crave entry, saying
that ye bring tidings from the army. Then he will cause you to be
let in, and thou, Charmion, must break this heavy news that
Canidius bears; for Canidius himself I dare not send. And when
his grief is past, do thou, Olympus, soothe his fevered frame
with thy draughts of value, and his soul with honeyed words, and
draw him back to me, and all will yet be well. Do thou this, and
thou shalt have gifts more than thou canst count, for I am yet a
Queen and yet can pay back those who serve my will."</p>

<p>"Fear not, O Queen," I answered, "this thing shall be done,
and I ask no reward, who have come hither to do thy bidding to
the end."</p>

<p>So I bowed and went and, summoning Atoua, made ready a certain
potion.</p>

<p class="first">IT was yet dawn Charmion came again, and we
walked to the private harbour of the palace. There, taking boat,
we rowed to the island mount on which stands the Timonium, a
vaulted tower, strong, small, and round. And, having landed, we
twain came to the door and knocked, till at length a grating was
thrown open in the door, and an aged eunuch, looking forth,
roughly asked our business.</p>

<p>"Our business is with the Lord Antony," said Charmion.</p>

<p>"Then it is no business, for Antony, my master, sees neither
man nor woman."</p>

<p>"Yet will he see us, for we bring tidings. Go tell him that
the Lady Charmion brings tidings from the army."</p>

<p>The man went, and presently returned.</p>

<p>"The Lord Antony would know if the tidings be good or ill,
for, if ill, then will he none of it, for with evil tidings he
has been overfed of late."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, it is both good and ill. Open, slave, I will
make answer to thy master!" and she slipped a purse of gold
through the bars.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he grumbled, as he took the purse, "the times
are hard, and likely to be harder; for when the lion's down who
will feed the jackal? Give thy news thyself, and if it do but
draw the noble Antony out of this hall of Groans, I care not what
it be. Now the palace door is open, and there's the road to the
banqueting-chamber."</p>

<p>We passed on, to find ourselves in a narrow passage, and,
leaving the eunuch to bar the door, advanced till we came to a
curtain. Through this entrance we went, and found ourselves in a
vaulted chamber, ill-lighted from the roof. On the further side
of this rude chamber was a bed of rugs, and on them crouched the
figure of a man, his face hidden in the folds of his toga.</p>

<p>"Most noble Antony," said Charmion drawing near, "unwrap thy
face and hearken to me, for I bring thee tidings."</p>

<p>Then he lifted up his head. His face was marred by sorrow; his
tangled hair, grizzled with years, hung about his hollow eyes,
and white on his chin was the stubble of an unshaven beard. His
robe was squalid, and his aspect more wretched than that of the
poorest beggar at the temple gates. To this, then, had the love
of Cleopatra brought the glorious and renowned Antony, aforetime
Master of half the World!</p>

<p>"What will ye with me, Lady," he asked, "who would perish here
alone? And who is this man who comes to gaze on fallen and
forsaken Antony?"</p>

<br>

alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"Who is this man who comes to gaze on fallen Antony?"</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>"This is Olympus, noble Antony, that wise physician, the
skilled in auguries, of whom thou hast heard much, and whom
Cleopatra, ever mindful of thy welfare, though but little thou
dost think of hers, has sent to minister to thee."</p>

<p>"And, can thy physician minister to a grief such as my grief?
Can his drugs give me back my galleys, my honour, and my peace?
Nay! Away with thy physician! What are thy
tidings?&mdash;quick!&mdash;out with it! Hath Canidius,
perchance, conquered Caesar? Tell me but that, and thou shalt
have a province for thy guerdon&mdash;ay! and if Octavianus be
dead, twenty thousand sestertia to fill its treasury.
Speak&mdash;nay&mdash;speak not! I fear the opening of thy lips
as never I feared an earthly thing. Surely the wheel of fortune
has gone round and Canidius has conquered? Is it not so? Nay
&mdash;out with it! I can no more!"</p>

<p>"O noble Antony," she said, "steel thy heart to hear that
which I needs must tell thee! Canidius is in Alexandria. He has
fled far and fast, and this is his report. For seven whole days
did the legions wait the coming of Antony, to lead them to
victory, as aforetime, putting aside the offers of the envoys of
Caesar. But Antony came not. And then it was rumoured that Antony
had fled to Taenarus, drawn thither by Cleopatra. The man who
first brought that tale to the camp the legionaries cried shame
on&mdash;ay, and beat him to the death! But ever it grew, until
at length there was no more room to doubt; and then, O Antony,
thy officers slipped one by one away to Caesar, and where the
officers go there the men follow. Nor is this all the story; for
thy allies&mdash; Bocchus of Africa, Tarcondimotus of Cilicia,
Mithridates of Commagene, Adallas of Thrace, Philadelphus of
Paphlagonia, Archelaus of Cappadocia, Herod of Judaea, Amyntas of
Galatia, Polemon of Pontus, and Malchus of Arabia&mdash; all, all
have fled or bid their generals fly back to whence they came; and
already their ambassador's crave cold Caesar's clemency."</p>

<p>"Hast done thy croakings, thou raven in a peacock's dress, or
is there more to come?" asked the smitten man, lifting his white
and trembling face from the shelter of his hands. "Tell me more;
say that Egypt's dead in all her beauty; say that Octavianus
lowers at the Canopic gate; and that, headed by dead Cicero, all
the ghosts of Hell do audibly shriek out the fall of Antony! Yea,
gather up every woe that can o'erwhelm those who once were great,
and loose them on the hoary head of him whom&mdash;in thy
gentleness&mdash; thou art still pleased to name 'the noble
Antony'!"</p>

<p>"Nay, my Lord, I have done."</p>

<p>"Ay, and so have I done&mdash;done, quite done! It is
altogether finished, and thus I seal the end," and snatching a
sword from the couch, he would, indeed, have slain himself had I
not sprung forward and grasped his hand. For it was not my
purpose that he should die as yet; since had he died at that hour
Cleopatra had made her peace with Caesar, who rather wished the
death of Antony than the ruin of Egypt.</p>

<p>"Art mad, Antony? Art, indeed, a coward?" cried Charmion,
"that thou wouldst thus escape thy woes, and leave thy partner to
face the sorrow out alone?"</p>

<p>"Why not, woman? Why not? She would not be long alone. There's
Caesar to keep her company. Octavianus loves a fair woman in his
cold way, and still is Cleopatra fair. Come now, thou Olympus!
thou hast held my hand from dealing death upon myself, advise me
of thy wisdom. Shall I, then, submit myself to Caesar, and I,
Triumvir, twice Consul, and aforetime absolute Monarch of all the
East, endure to follow in his triumph along those Roman ways
where I myself have passed in triumph?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Sire," I answered. "If thou dost yield, then art thou
doomed. All last night I questioned of the Fates concerning thee,
and I saw this: when thy star draws near to Caesar's it pales and
is swallowed up; but when it passes from his radiance, then
bright and big it shines, equal in glory to his own. All is not
lost, and while some part remains, everything may be regained.
Egypt can yet be held, armies can still be raised. Caesar has
withdrawn himself; he is not yet at the gates of Alexandria, and
perchance may be appeased. Thy mind in its fever has fired thy
body; thou art sick and canst not judge aright. See, here, I have
a potion that shall make thee whole, for I am well skilled in the
art of medicine," and I held out the phial.</p>

<p>"A potion, thou sayest man!" he cried. "More like it is a
poison, and thou a murderer, sent by false Egypt, who would fain
be rid of me now that I may no more be of service to her. The
head of Antony is the peace offering she would send to
Caesar&mdash;she for whom I have lost all! Give me thy draught.
By Bacchus! I will drink it, though it be the very elixir of
Death!"</p>

<p>"Nay, noble Antony; it is no poison, and I am no murderer.
See, I will taste it, if thou wilt," and I held forth the subtle
drink that has the power to fire the veins of men.</p>

<p>"Give it me, Physician. Desperate men are brave men.
There!&mdash; &mdash;Why, what is this? Yours is a magic draught!
My sorrows seem to roll away like thunder-clouds before the
southern gale, and the spring of Hope blooms fresh upon the
desert of my heart. Once more I am Antony, and once again I see
my legions' spears asparkle in the sun, and hear the thunderous
shout of welcome as Antony&mdash;beloved Antony&mdash;rides in
pomp of war along his deep-formed lines! There's hope! there's
hope! I may yet see the cold brows of Caesar&mdash;that Caesar
who never errs except from policy&mdash; robbed of their victor
bays and crowned with shameful dust!"</p>

<p>"Ay," cried Charmion, "there still is hope, if thou wilt but
play the man! O my Lord! come back with us; come back to the
loving arms of Cleopatra! All night she lies upon her golden bed,
and fills the hollow darkness with her groans for 'Antony!' who,
enamoured now of Grief, forgets his duty and his love!"</p>

<p>"I come! I come! Shame upon me, that I dared to doubt her!
Slave, bring water, and a purple robe: not thus can I be seen of
Cleopatra. Even now I come."</p>

<p>In this fashion, then, did we draw Antony back to Cleopatra,
that the ruin of the twain might be made sure.</p>

<p>We led him up the Alabaster Hall and into Cleopatra's chamber,
where she lay, her cloudy hair about her face and breast, and
tears flowing from her deep eyes.</p>

<p>"O Egypt!" he cried, "behold me at thy feet!"</p>

<p>She sprang from the couch. "And art thou here, my love?" she
murmured; "then once again are all things well. Come near, and in
these arms forget thy sorrows and turn my grief to joy. Oh,
Antony, while love is left to us, still have we all!"</p>

<p>And she fell upon his breast and kissed him wildly.</p>

<p>That same day, Charmion came to me and bade me prepare a
poison of the most deadly power. And this at first I would not
do, fearing that Cleopatra would therewith make an end of Antony
before his time. But Charmion showed me that this was not so, and
told me also for what purpose was the poison. Therefore I
summoned Atoua, the skilled in simples, and all that afternoon we
laboured at the deadly work. And when it was done, Charmion came
once more, bearing with her a chaplet of fresh roses, that she
bade me steep in the poison.</p>

<p>This then I did.</p>

<p>That night at the great feast of Cleopatra, I sat near Antony,
who was at her side, and wore the poisoned wreath. Now as the
feast went on, the wine flowed fast, till Antony and the Queen
grew merry. And she told him of her plans, and of how even now
her galleys were being drawn by the canal that leads from
Bubastis on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, to Clysma at the
head of the Bay of Heroopolis. For it was her design, should
Caesar prove stubborn, to fly with Antony and her treasure down
the Arabian Gulf, where Caesar had no fleet, and seek some new
home in India, whither her foes might not follow. But, indeed,
this plan came to nothing, for the Arabs of Petra burnt the
galleys, incited thereto by a message sent by the Jews of
Alexandria, who hated Cleopatra and were hated of her. For I
caused the Jews to be warned of what was being done.</p>

<p>Now, when she had made an end of telling him, the Queen called
on him to drink a cup with her, to the success of this new
scheme, bidding him, as she did so, steep his wreath of roses in
the wine, and make the draught more sweet. This, then, he did,
and it being done, she pledged him. But when he was about to
pledge her back, she caught his hand, crying "<i>Hold!</i>"
whereat he paused, wondering.</p>

<p>Now, among the servants of Cleopatra was one Eudosius, a
steward; and this Eudosius, seeing that the fortunes of Cleopatra
were at an end, had laid a plan to fly that very night to Caesar,
as many of his betters had done, taking with him all the treasure
in the palace that he could steal. But this design being
discovered to Cleopatra, she determined to be avenged upon
Eudosius.</p>

<p>"Eudosius," she cried, for the man stood near; "come hither,
thou faithful servant! Seest thou this man, most noble Antony;
through all our troubles he has clung to us and been of comfort
to us. Now, therefore, he shall be rewarded according to his
deserts and the measure of his faithfulness, and that from thine
own hand. Give him thy golden cup of wine, and let him drink a
pledge to our success; the cup shall be his guerdon."</p>

<p>And still wondering, Antony gave it to the man, who, stricken
in his guilty mind, took it, and stood trembling. But he drank
not.</p>

<p>"Drink! thou slave; drink!" cried Cleopatra, half rising from
her seat and flashing a fierce look on his white face. "By
Serapis! so surely as I yet shall sit in the Capitol at Rome, if
thou dost thus flout the Lord Antony, I'll have thee scourged to
the bones, and the red wine poured upon thy open wounds to heal
them! <i>Ah!</i> at length thou drinkest! Why, what is it, good
Eudosius? art sick? Surely, then, this wine must be as the water
of jealousy of those Jews, that has power to slay the false and
strengthen the honest only. Go, some of you, search this man's
room; methinks he is a traitor!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man stood, his hands to his head. Presently he
began to tremble, and then fell, clutching at his bosom, as
though to tear out the fire in his heart. He staggered, with
livid, twisted face and foaming lips, to where Cleopatra lay
watching him with a slow and cruel smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, traitor! thou hast it now!" she said. "Prithee, is death
sweet?"</p>

<p>"Thou wanton!" yelled the dying man, "thou hast poisoned me!
Thus mayst thou also perish!" and with one shriek he flung
himself upon her. She saw his purpose, and swift and supple as a
tiger sprang to one side, so that he did but grasp her royal
cloak, tearing it from its emerald clasp. Down he fell upon the
ground, rolling over and over in the purple chiton, till
presently he lay still and dead, his tormented face and frozen
eyes peering ghastly from its folds.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Queen, with a hard laugh, "the slave died
wondrous hard, and fain would have drawn me with him. See, he has
borrowed my garment for a pall! Take him away and bury him in his
livery."</p>

"Ah!" said the Queen, with a hard laugh, "the slave died<br>
wondrous hard, and fain would have drawn me with him."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"What means Cleopatra?" said Antony, as the guards dragged the
corpse away; "the man drank of my cup. What is the purpose of
this most sorry jest?"</p>

<p>"It serves a double end, noble Antony! This very night that
man would have fled to Octavianus, bearing of our treasure with
him. Well, I have lent him wings, for the dead fly fast! Also
this: thou didst fear that I should poison thee, my Lord; nay, I
know it. See now, Antony, how easy it were that I should slay
thee if I had the will. That wreath of roses which thou didst
steep within the cup is dewed with deadly bane. Had I, then, a
mind to make an end of thee, I had not stayed thy hand. O Antony,
henceforth trust me! Sooner would I slay myself than harm one
hair of thy beloved head! See, here come my messengers! Speak,
what did ye find?"</p>

<p>"Royal Egypt, we found this. All things in the chamber of
Eudosius are made ready for flight, and in his baggage is much
treasure."</p>

<p>"Thou hearest?" she said, smiling darkly. "Think ye, my loyal
servants all, that Cleopatra is one with whom it is well to play
the traitor? Be warned by this Roman's fate!"</p>

<p>Then a great silence of fear fell upon the company, and Antony
sat also silent.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">I, HARMACHIS, must make speed with my task,
setting down that which is permitted as shortly as may be, and
leaving much untold. For of this I am warned, that Doom draws on
and my days are wellnigh sped. After the drawing forth of Antony
from the Timonium came that time of heavy quiet which heralds the
rising of the desert wind. Antony and Cleopatra once again gave
themselves up to luxury, and night by night feasted in splendour
at the palace. They sent ambassadors to Caesar; but Caesar would
have none of them; and, this hope being gone, they turned their
minds to the defence of Alexandria. Men were gathered, ships were
built, and a great force was made ready against the coming of
Caesar.</p>

<p>And now, aided by Charmion, I began my last work of hate and
vengeance. I wormed myself deep into the secrets of the palace,
counselling all things for evil. I bade Cleopatra keep Antony
gay, lest he should brood upon his sorrows: and thus she sapped
his strength and energy with luxury and wine. I gave him of my
draughts&mdash;draughts that sank his soul in dreams of happiness
and power, leaving him to wake to a heavier misery. Soon, without
my healing medicine he could not sleep, and thus, being ever at
his side, I bound his weakened will to mine, till at last he
would do little if I said not "It is well." Cleopatra, also grown
very superstitious, leaned much upon me; for I prophesied falsely
to her in secret.</p>

<p>Moreover, I wove other webs. My fame was great throughout
Egypt, for during the long years that I had dwelt in Tápé it had
spread through all the land. Therefore many men of note came to
me, both for their health's sake and because it was known that I
had the ear of Antony and the Queen; and, in these days of doubt
and trouble, they were fain to learn the truth. All these men I
worked upon with doubtful words, sapping their loyalty; and I
caused many to fall away, and yet none could bear an evil report
of what I had said. Also, Cleopatra sent me to Memphis, there to
move the Priests and Governors that they should gather men in
Upper Egypt for the defence of Alexandria. And I went and spoke
to the priests with such a double meaning and with so much wisdom
that they knew me to be one of the initiated in the deeper
mysteries. But how I, Olympus the physician, came thus to be
initiated none might say. And afterwards they sought me secretly,
and I gave them the holy sign of brotherhood; and thereunder bade
them not to ask who I might be, but send no aid to Cleopatra.
Rather, I said, must they make peace with Caesar, for by Caesar's
grace only could the worship of the Gods endure in Khem. So,
having taken counsel of the Holy Apis, they promised in public to
give help to Cleopatra, but in secret sent an embassy to
Caesar.</p>

<p>Thus, then, it came to pass that Egypt gave but little aid to
its hated Macedonian Queen. Thence from Memphis I came once more
to Alexandria, and, having made favourable report, continued my
secret work. And, indeed, the Alexandrians could not easily be
stirred, for, as they say in the marketplace, "The ass looks at
its burden and is blind to its master." Cleopatra had oppressed
them so long that the Roman was like a welcome friend.</p>

<p>Thus the time passed on, and every night found Cleopatra with
fewer friends than that which had gone before, for in evil days
friends fly like swallows before the frost. Yet she would not
give up Antony, whom she loved; though to my knowledge Caesar, by
his freedman, Thyreus, made promise to her of her dominions for
herself and for her children if she would but slay Antony, or
even betray him bound. But to this her woman's heart&mdash;for
still she had a heart&mdash;would not consent, and, moreover, we
counselled her against it, for of necessity we must hold him to
her, lest, Antony escaping or being slain, Cleopatra might ride
out the storm and yet be Queen of Egypt. And this grieved me,
because Antony, though weak, was still a brave man, and a great;
and, moreover, in my own heart I read the lesson of his woes. For
were we not akin in wretchedness? Had not the same woman robbed
us of Empire, Friends, and Honour? But pity has no place in
politics, nor could it turn my feet from the path of vengeance it
was ordained that I should tread. Caesar drew nigh; Pelusium
fell; the end was at hand. It was Charmion who brought the
tidings to the Queen and Antony, as they slept in the heat of the
day, and I came with her.</p>

<p>"Awake!" she cried. "Awake! This is no time for sleep!
Seleucus hath surrendered Pelusium to Caesar, who marches
straight on Alexandria!"</p>

<p>With a great oath, Antony sprang up and clutched Cleopatra by
the arm.</p>

<p>"Thou hast betrayed me&mdash;by the Gods I swear it! Now thou
shalt pay the price!" And snatching up his sword he drew it.</p>

<p>"Stay thy hand, Antony!" she cried. "It is false&mdash;I know
naught of this!" And she sprang upon him, and clung about his
neck, weeping. "I know naught, my Lord. Take thou the wife of
Seleucus and his little children, whom I hold in guard, and
avenge thyself. O Antony, Antony! why dost thou doubt me?"</p>

<p>Then Antony threw down his sword upon the marble, and, casting
himself upon the couch, hid his face, and groaned in bitterness
of spirit.</p>

<p>But Charmion smiled, for it was she who had sent secretly to
Seleucus, her friend, counselling him to surrender forthwith,
saying that no fight would be made at Alexandria. And that very
night Cleopatra took all her great store of pearls and
emeralds&mdash;those that remained of the treasure of Menkau-
ra&mdash;all her wealth of gold, ebony, ivory, and cinnamon,
treasure without price, and placed it in the mausoleum of granite
which, after our Egyptian fashion, she had built upon the hill
that is by the Temple of the Holy Isis. These riches she piled up
upon a bed of flax, that, when she fired it, all might perish in
the flame and escape the greed of money-loving Octavianus. And
she slept henceforth in this tomb, away from Antony; but in the
daytime she still saw him at the palace.</p>

<p>But a little while after, when Caesar with all his great force
had already crossed the Caponic mouth of the Nile and was hard on
Alexandria, I came to the palace, whither Cleopatra had summoned
me. There I found her in the Alabaster Hall, royally clad, a wild
light in her eyes, and, with her, Iras and Charmion, and before
her guards; and stretched here and there upon the marble, bodies
of dead men, among whom lay one yet dying.</p>

<p>"Greeting, thou Olympus!" she cried. "Here is a sight to glad
a physician's heart&mdash;men dead and men sick unto death!"</p>

<p>"What doest thou, O Queen?" I said affrighted.</p>

<p>"What do I? I wreak justice on these criminals and traitors;
and, Olympus, I learn the ways of death. I have caused six
different poisons to be given to these slaves, and with an
attentive eye have watched their working. That man," and she
pointed to a Nubian, "he went mad, and raved of his native
deserts and his mother. He thought himself a child again, poor
fool! and bade her hold him close to her breast and save him from
the darkness which drew near. And that Greek, he shrieked, and,
shrieking, died. And this, he wept and prayed for pity, and in
the end, like a coward, breathed his last. Now, note the Egyptian
yonder, he who still lives and groans; first he took the draught
&mdash;the deadliest draught of all, they swore&mdash;and yet the
slave so dearly loves his life he will not leave it! See, he yet
strives to throw the poison from him; twice have I given him the
cup and yet he is athirst. What a drunkard we have here! Man,
man, knowest thou not that in death only can peace be found?
Struggle no more, but enter into rest." And even as she spoke,
the man, with a great cry, gave up the spirit.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic-1st-28"></a>
<div align="center">

alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"As she spoke, the man, with a great cry, gave up the spirit."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"There!" she cried, "at length the farce is played&mdash;away
with those slaves whom I have forced through the difficult gates
of Joy!" and she clapped her hands. But when they had borne the
bodies thence she drew me to her, and spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Olympus, for all thy prophecies, the end is at hand. Caesar
must conquer, and I and my Lord Antony be lost. Now, therefore,
the play being wellnigh done, I must make ready to leave this
stage of earth in such fashion as becomes a Queen. For this
cause, then, I do make trial of these poisons, seeing that in my
person I must soon endure those agonies of death that to-day I
give to others. These drugs please me not; some wrench out the
soul with cruel pains, and some too slowly work their end. But
thou art skilled in the medicines of death. Now, do thou prepare
me such a draught as shall, pangless, steal my life away."</p>

<p>And as I listened the sense of triumph filled my bitter heart,
for I knew now that by my own hand should this ruined woman die
and the justice of the Gods be done.</p>

<p>"Spoken like a Queen, O Cleopatra!" I said. "Death shall cure
thy ills, and I will brew such a wine as shall draw him down a
sudden friend and sink thee in a sea of slumber whence, upon this
earth, thou shalt never wake again. Oh! fear not Death: Death is
thy hope; and, surely, thou shalt pass sinless and pure of heart
into the dreadful presence of the Gods!"</p>

<p>She trembled. "And if the heart be not altogether pure, tell
me&mdash; thou dark man&mdash;what then? Nay, I fear not the
Gods! for if the Gods of Hell be men, there I shall Queen it
also. At the least, having once been royal, royal I shall ever
be."</p>

<p>And, as she spoke, suddenly from the palace gates came a great
clamour, and the noise of joyful shouting.</p>

<p>"Why, what is this?" she said, springing from her couch.</p>

<p>"Antony! Antony!" rose the cry; "Antony hath conquered!"</p>

<p>She turned swiftly and ran, her long hair streaming on the
wind. I followed her, more slowly, down the great hall, across
the courtyards, to the palace gates. And here she met Antony,
riding through them, radiant with smiles and clad in his Roman
armour. When he saw her he leapt to the ground, and, all armed as
he was, clasped her to his breast.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried; "is Caesar fallen?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not altogether fallen, Egypt: but we have beat his
horsemen back to their trenches, and, like the beginning, so
shall be the end, for, as they say here, 'Where the head goes,
the tail will follow.' Moreover, Caesar has my challenge, and if
he will but meet me hand to hand, the world shall soon see which
is the better man, Antony or Octavian." And even as he spoke and
the people cheered there came the cry of "A messenger from
Caesar!"</p>

<p>The herald entered, and, bowing low, gave a writing to Antony,
bowed again, and went. Cleopatra snatched it from his hand, broke
the silk and read aloud:</p>

<p>"Caesar to Antony, greeting.</p>

<p>"This answer to thy challenge: Can Antony find no better way
of death than beneath the sword of Caesar? Farewell!"</p>

<p>And thereafter they cheered no more.</p>

<p>The darkness came, and before it was midnight, having feasted
with his friends who to-night went over his woes and to-morrow
should betray him, Antony went forth to the gathering of the
captains of the land-forces and of the fleet, attended by many,
among whom was I.</p>

<p>When all were come together, he spoke to them, standing
bareheaded in their midst, beneath the radiance of the moon. And
thus he most nobly spoke:</p>

<p>"Friends and companions in arms! who yet cling to me, and whom
many a time I have led to victory, hearken to me now, who to-
morrow may lie in the dumb dust, disempired and dishonoured. This
is our design: no longer will we hang on poised wings above the
flood of war, but will straightway plunge, perchance thence to
snatch the victor's diadem, or, failing, there to drown. Be now
but true to me, and to your honour's sake, and you may still sit,
the most proud of men, at my right hand in the Capitol of Rome.
Fail me now, and the cause of Antony is lost and so are ye. To-
morrow's battle must be hazardous indeed, but we have stood many
a time and faced a fiercer peril, and ere the sun had sunk, once
more have driven armies like desert sands before our gale of
valour and counted the spoil of hostile kings. What have we to
fear? Though allies be fled, still is our array as strong as
Caesar's! And show we but as high a heart, why, I swear to you,
upon my princely word, to-morrow night I shall deck yonder
Canopic gate with the heads of Octavian and his captains!</p>

<p>"Ay, cheer, and cheer again! I love that martial music which
swells, not as from the indifferent lips of clarions, now 'neath
the breath of Antony and now of Caesar, but rather out of the
single hearts of men who love me. Yet &mdash;and now I will speak
low, as we do speak o'er the bier of some beloved dead&mdash;yet,
if Fortune should rise against me and if, borne down by the
weight of arms, Antony, the soldier, dies a soldier's death,
leaving you to mourn him who ever was your friend, this is my
will, that, after our rough fashion of the camp, I here declare
to you. You know where all my treasure lies. Take it, most dear
friends; and, in the memory of Antony, make just division. Then
go to Caesar and speak thus: 'Antony, the dead, to Caesar, the
living, sends greeting; and, in the name of ancient fellowship
and of many a peril dared, craves this boon: the safety of those
who clung to him and that which he hath given them.'</p>

<p>"Nay, let not my tears&mdash;for I must weep&mdash;overflow
your eyes! Why, it is not manly; 'tis most womanish! All men must
die, and death were welcome were it not so lone. Should I fall, I
leave my children to your tender care&mdash;if, perchance, it may
avail to save them from the fate of helplessness. Soldiers,
enough! to-morrow at the dawn we spring on Caesar's throat, both
by land and sea. Swear that ye will cling to me, even to the last
issue!"</p>

<p>"We swear!" they cried. "Noble Antony, we swear!"</p>

<p>"It is well! Once more my star grows bright; to-morrow, set in
the highest heaven, it yet may shine the lamp of Caesar down!
Till then, farewell!"</p>

<p>He turned to go. As he went they caught his hand and kissed
it; and so deeply were they moved that many wept like children;
nor could Antony master his grief, for, in the moonlight, I saw
tears roll down his furrowed cheeks and fall upon that mighty
breast.</p>

<p>And, seeing all this, I was much troubled. For I well knew
that if these men held firm to Antony all might yet go well for
Cleopatra; and though I bore no ill-will against Antony, yet he
must fall, and in that fall drag down the woman who, like some
poisonous plant, had twined herself about his giant strength till
it choked and mouldered in her embrace.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Antony went I went not, but stood back in the
shadow watching the faces of the lords and captains as they spoke
together.</p>

<p>"Then it is agreed!" said he who should lead the fleet. "And
this we swear to, one and all, that we will cling to noble Antony
to the last extremity of fortune!"</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" they answered.</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" I said, speaking from the shadow; "cling, and
<i>die!</i>"</p>

<p>They turned fiercely and seized me.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" quoth one.</p>

<p>"'Tis that dark-faced dog, Olympus!" cried another. "Olympus,
the magician!"</p>

<p>"Olympus, the traitor!" growled another; "put an end to him
and his magic!" and he drew his sword.</p>

<p>"Ay! slay him; he would betray the Lord Antony, whom he is
paid to doctor."</p>

<p>"Hold a while!" I said in a slow and solemn voice, "and beware
how ye try to murder the servant of the Gods. I am no traitor.
For myself, I abide the event here in Alexandria, but to you I
say, Flee, flee to Caesar! I serve Antony and the Queen&mdash;I
serve them truly; but above all I serve the Holy Gods; and what
they make known to me, that, Lords, I do know. And I know this:
that Antony is doomed, and Cleopatra is doomed, for Caesar
conquers. Therefore, because I honour you, noble gentlemen, and
think with pity on your wives, left widowed, and your little
fatherless children, that shall, if ye hold to Antony, be sold as
slaves&mdash;therefore, I say, cling to Antony if ye will and
die; or flee to Caesar and be saved! And this I say because it is
so ordained of the Gods."</p>

<p>"The Gods!" they growled; "what Gods? Slit the traitor's
throat, and stop his ill-omened talk!"</p>

<p>"Let him show us a sign from his Gods or let him die: I do
mistrust this man," said another.</p>

<p>"Stand back, ye fools!" I cried. "Stand back&mdash;free mine
arms &mdash;and I will show you a sign;" and there was that in my
face which frightened them, for they freed me and stood back.
Then I lifted up my hands and putting out all my strength of soul
searched the depths of space till my Spirit communed with the
Spirit of my Mother Isis. Only the Word of Power I uttered not,
as I had been bidden. And the holy mystery of the Goddess
answered to my Spirit's cry, falling in awful silence upon the
face of the earth. Deeper and deeper grew the terrible silence;
even the dogs ceased to howl, and in the city men stood still
afeared. Then, from far away, there came the ghostly music of the
sistra. Faint it was at first, but ever as it came it grew more
loud, till the air shivered with the unearthly sound of terror. I
said naught, but pointed with my hand toward the sky. And behold!
bosomed upon the air, floated a vast veiled Shape that, heralded
by the swelling music of the sistra, drew slowly near, till its
shadow lay upon us. It came, it passed, it went toward the camp
of Caesar, till at length the music died away, and the awful
Shape was swallowed in the night.</p>

<p>"It is Bacchus!" cried one. "Bacchus, who leaves lost Antony!"
and, as he spoke, there rose a groan of terror from all the
camp.</p>

<p>But I knew that it was not Bacchus, the false God, but the
Divine Isis who deserted Khem, and, passing over the edge of the
world, sought her home in space, to be no more known of men. For
though her worship is still upheld, though still she is here and
in all Earths, Isis manifests herself no more in Egypt. I hid my
face and prayed, but when I lifted it from my robe, lo! all had
fled and I was alone.</p>

<p class="first">THE morrow, at dawn, Antony came forth and
gave command that his fleet should advance against the fleet of
Caesar, and that his cavalry should open the land-battle with the
cavalry of Caesar. Accordingly, the fleet advanced in a triple
line, and the fleet of Caesar came out to meet it. But when they
met, the galleys of Antony lifted their oars in greeting, and
passed over to the galleys of Caesar; and they sailed away
together. And the cavalry of Antony rode forth beyond the
Hippodrome to charge the cavalry of Caesar; but when they met,
they lowered their swords and passed over to the camp of Caesar,
deserting Antony. Then Antony grew mad with rage and terrible to
see. He shouted to his legions to stand firm and wait attack; and
for a little while they stood. One man, however&mdash;that same
officer who would have slain me on the yesternight&mdash;strove
to fly; but Antony seized him with his own hand, threw him to the
earth, and, springing from his horse, drew his sword to slay him.
He held his sword on high, while the man, covering his face,
awaited death. But Antony dropped his sword and bade him
rise.</p>

<p>"Go!" he said. "Go to Caesar, and prosper! I did love thee
once. Why, then, among so many traitors, should I single thee out
for death?"</p>

<p>The man rose and looked upon him sorrowfully. Then, shame
overwhelming him, with a great cry he tore open his shirt of
mail, plunged his sword into his own heart and fell down dead.
Antony stood and gazed at him, but he said never a word.
Meanwhile the ranks of Caesar's legions drew near, and so soon as
they crossed spears the legions of Antony turned and fled. Then
the soldiers of Caesar stood still mocking them; but scarce a man
was slain, for they pursued not.</p>

<p>"Fly, Lord Antony! fly!" cried Eros, his servant, who alone
with me stayed by him. "Fly ere thou art dragged a prisoner to
Caesar!"</p>

<p>So he turned and fled, groaning heavily. I went with him, and
as we rode through the Canopic gate, where many folk stood
wondering, Antony spoke to me:</p>

<p>"Go, thou, Olympus; go to the Queen and say: 'Antony sends
greeting to Cleopatra, who hath betrayed him! To Cleopatra he
sends greeting and farewell!'"</p>

<p>And so I went to the tomb, but Antony fled to the palace. When
I came to the tomb I knocked upon the door, and Charmion looked
forth from the window.</p>

<p>"Open," I cried, and she opened.</p>

<p>"What news, Harmachis?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Charmion," I said, "the end is at hand. Antony is fled!"</p>

<p>"It is well," she answered; "I am aweary."</p>

<p>And there on her golden bed sat Cleopatra.</p>

<p>"Speak, man!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Antony has fled, his forces are fled, Caesar draws near. To
Cleopatra the great Antony sends greeting and farewell. Greeting
to Cleopatra who betrayed him, and farewell."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" she screamed; "I betrayed him not! Thou,
Olympus, go swiftly to Antony and answer thus: 'To Antony,
Cleopatra, who hath not betrayed him, sends greeting and
farewell. Cleopatra is no more.'"</p>

<p>And so I went, following out my purpose. In the Alabaster Hall
I found Antony pacing to and fro, tossing his hands toward
heaven, and with him Eros, for of all his servants Eros alone
remained by this fallen man.</p>

<p>"Lord Antony," I said, "Egypt bids thee farewell. Egypt is
dead by her own hand."</p>

<p>"Dead! dead!" he whispered, "and is Egypt dead? and is that
form of glory now food for worms? Oh, what a woman was this! E'en
now my heart goes out towards her. And shall she outdo me at the
last, I who have been so great; shall I become so small that a
woman can overtop my courage and pass where I fear to follow?
Eros, thou hast loved me from a boy&mdash;mindest thou how I
found thee starving in the desert, and made thee rich, giving
thee place and wealth? Come, now pay me back. Draw that sword
thou wearest and make an end of the woes of Antony."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sire," cried the Greek, "I cannot! How can I take away
the life of godlike Antony?"</p>

<p>"Answer me not, Eros; but in the last extreme of fate this I
charge thee. Do thou my bidding, or begone and leave me quite
alone! No more will I see thy face, thou unfaithful servant!"</p>

<p>Then Eros drew his sword and Antony knelt before him and bared
his breast, turning his eyes to heaven. But Eros, crying "I
cannot! oh, I cannot!" plunged the sword to his own heart, and
fell dead.</p>

<p>Antony rose and gazed upon him. "Why, Eros, that was nobly
done," he said. "Thou art greater than I, yet I have learned thy
lesson!" and he knelt down and kissed him.</p>

<p>Then, rising of a sudden, he drew the sword from the heart of
Eros, plunged it into his bowels, and fell, groaning, on the
couch.</p>

<p>"O thou, Olympus," he cried, "this pain is more than I can
bear! Make an end of me, Olympus!"</p>

<p>But pity stirred me, and I could not do this thing.</p>

<p>Therefore I drew the sword from his vitals, staunched the flow
of blood, and, calling to those who came crowding in to see
Antony die, I bade them summon Atoua from my house at the palace
gates. Presently she came, bringing with her simples and life-
giving draughts. These I gave to Antony, and bade Atoua go with
such speed as her old limbs might to Cleopatra, in the tomb, and
tell her of the state of Antony.</p>

<p>So she went, and after a while returned, saying that the Queen
yet lived and summoned Antony to die in her arms. And with her
came Diomedes. When Antony heard, his ebbing strength came back,
for he was fain to look upon Cleopatra's face again. So I called
to the slaves&mdash;who peeped and peered through curtains and
from behind pillars to see this great man die&mdash;and together,
with much toil, we bore him thence till we came to the foot of
the Mausoleum.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra, being afraid of treachery, would no more throw
wide the door; so she let down a rope from the window and we made
it fast beneath the arms of Antony. Then did Cleopatra, who the
while wept most bitterly, together with Charmion and Iras the
Greek, pull on the rope with all their strength, while we lifted
from below till the dying Antony swung in the air, groaning
heavily, and the blood dropped from his gaping wound. Twice he
nearly fell to earth: but Cleopatra, striving with the strength
of love and of despair, held him till at length she drew him
through the windowplace, while all who saw the dreadful sight
wept bitterly, and beat their breasts&mdash;all save myself and
Charmion.</p>

<p>When he was in, once more the rope was let down, and, with
some aid from Charmion, I climbed into the tomb, drawing up the
rope after me. There I found Antony, laid upon the golden bed of
Cleopatra; and she, her breast bare, her face stained with tears,
and her hair streaming wildly about him, knelt at his side and
kissed him, wiping the blood from his wounds with her robes and
hair. And let all my shame be written: as I stood and watched her
the old love awoke once more within me, and mad jealousy raged in
my heart because&mdash;though I could destroy these twain&mdash;I
could not destroy their love.</p>

"There I found Antony, laid upon the golden bed of
Cleopatra."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"O Antony! my Sweet, my Husband, and my God!" she moaned.
"Cruel Antony, hast thou the heart to die and leave me to my
lonely shame? I will follow thee swiftly to the grave. Antony,
awake! awake!"</p>

<p>He lifted up his head and called for wine, which I gave him,
mixing therein a draught that might allay his pain, for it was
great. And when he had drunk he bade Cleopatra lie down on the
bed beside him, and put her arms about him; and this she did.
Then was Antony once more a man; for, forgetting his own misery
and pain, he counselled her as to her own safety: but to this
talk she would not listen.</p>

<p>"The hour is short," she said; "let us speak of this great
love of ours that hath been so long and may yet endure beyond the
coasts of Death. Mindest thou that night when first thou didst
put thine arms about me and call me 'Love'? Oh! happy, happy
night! Having known that night it is well to have
lived&mdash;even to this bitter end!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Egypt, I mind it well and dwell upon its memory, though
from that hour fortune has fled from me&mdash;lost in my depth of
love for thee, thou Beautiful. I mind it!" he gasped; "then didst
thou drink the pearl in wanton play, and then did that astrologer
of thine call out his hour&mdash;'The hour of the coming of the
curse of Menkau-ra.' Through all the after-days those words have
haunted me, and now at the last they ring in my ears."</p>

<p>"He is long dead, my love," she whispered.</p>

<p>"If he be dead, then I am near him. What meant he?"</p>

<p>"He is dead, the accursed man!&mdash;no more of him! Oh! turn
and kiss me, for thy face grows white. The end is near!"</p>

<p>He kissed her on the lips, and for a little while so they
stayed, to the moment of death, babbling their passion in each
other's ears, like lovers newly wed. Even to my jealous heart, it
was a strange and awful thing to see.</p>

<p>Presently, I saw the Change of Death gather on his face. His
head fell back.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Egypt; farewell!&mdash;I die!"</p>

<p>Cleopatra lifted herself upon her hands, gazed wildly on his
ashen face, and then, with a great cry, she sank back
swooning.</p>

<p>But Antony yet lived, though the power of speech had left him.
Then I drew near and, kneeling, made pretence to minister to him.
And as I ministered I whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"Antony," I whispered, "Cleopatra was my love before she
passed from me to thee. I am Harmachis, that astrologer who stood
behind thy couch at Tarsus; and I have been the chief minister of
thy ruin.</p>

<p>"<i>Die, Antony!&mdash;the curse of Menkau-ra hath
fallen!</i>"</p>

<p>He raised himself, and stared upon my face. He could not
speak, but, gibbering, he pointed at me. Then with a groan his
spirit fled.</p>

<p>Thus did I accomplish my revenge upon Roman Antony, the World-
loser.</p>

<p>Thereafter, we recovered Cleopatra from her swoon, for not yet
was I minded that she should die. And taking the body of Antony,
Caesar permitting, I and Atoua caused it to be most skilfully
embalmed after our Egyptian fashion, covering the face with a
mask of gold fashioned like to the features of Antony. Also I
wrote upon his breast his name and titles, and painted his name
and the name of his father within his inner coffin, and drew the
form of the Holy Nout folding her wings about him.</p>

<p>Then with great pomp Cleopatra laid him in that sepulchre
which had been made ready, and in a sarcophagus of alabaster.
Now, this sarcophagus was fashioned so large that place was left
in it for a second coffin, for Cleopatra would lie by Antony at
the last.</p>

<p>These things then happened. And but a little while after I
learned tidings from one Cornelius Dolabella, a noble Roman who
waited upon Caesar, and, moved by the beauty that swayed the
souls of all who looked upon her, had pity for the woes of
Cleopatra. He bade me warn her&mdash;for, as her physician, it
was allowed me to pass in and out of the tomb where she dwelt
&mdash;that in three days she would be sent away to Rome,
together with her children, save Caesarion, whom Octavian had
already slain, that she might walk in the triumph of Caesar.
Accordingly I went in, and found her sitting, as now she always
sat, plunged in a half stupor, and before her that blood-stained
robe with which she had staunched the wounds of Antony. For on
this she would continually feast her eyes.</p>

<p>"See how faint they grow, Olympus," she said, lifting her sad
face and pointing to the rusty stains, "and he so lately dead!
Why, Gratitude could not fade more fast. What is now thy news?
Evil tidings is writ large in those dark eyes of thine, which
ever bring back to me something that still slips my mind."</p>

<p>"The news is ill, O Queen," I answered. "I have this from the
lips of Dolabella, who has it straight from Caesar's secretary.
On the third day from now Caesar will send thee and the Princes
Ptolemy and Alexander and the Princess Cleopatra to Rome, there
to feast the eyes of the Roman mob, and be led in triumph to that
Capitol where thou didst swear to set thy throne!"</p>

<p>"Never, never!" she cried, springing to her feet. "Never will
I walk in chains in Caesar's triumph! What must I do? Charmion,
tell me what I can do!"</p>

<p>And Charmion, rising, stood before her, looking at her through
the long lashes of her downcast eyes.</p>

<p>"Lady, thou canst die," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Ay, of a truth I had forgotten; I can die. Olympus, hast thou
the drug?"</p>

<p>"Nay; but if the Queen wills it, by to-morrow morn it shall be
brewed &mdash;a drug so swift and strong that not the Gods
themselves can hold him who drinks it back from sleep."</p>

<p>"Let it be made ready, thou Master of Death!"</p>

<p>I bowed, and withdrew myself; and all that night I and old
Atoua laboured at the distilling of the deadly draught. At length
it was done, and Atoua poured it into a crystal phial, and held
it to the light of the fire; for it was white as the purest
water.</p>

<p>"<i>La! la!</i>" she sang, in her shrill voice; "a drink for a
Queen! When fifty drops of that water of my brewing have passed
those red lips of hers, thou wilt indeed be avenged of Cleopatra,
O Harmachis! Ah, that I could be there to see thy Ruin ruined!
<i>La! la!</i> it would be sweet to see!"</p>

<p>"Vengeance is an arrow that oft-times falls upon the archer's
head," I answered, bethinking me of Charmion's saying.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE morrow Cleopatra, having sought leave of
Caesar, visited the tomb of Antony, crying that the Gods of Egypt
had deserted her. And when she had kissed the coffin and covered
it with lotus-flowers she came back, bathed, anointed herself,
put on her most splendid robes, and, together with Iras,
Charmion, and myself, she supped. Now as she supped her spirit
flared up wildly, even as the sky lights up at sunset; and once
more she laughed and sparkled as in bygone years, telling us
tales of feasts which she and Antony had eaten of. Never, indeed,
did I see her look more beauteous than on that last fatal night
of vengeance. And thus her mind drew on to that supper at Tarsus
when she drank the pearl.</p>

<p>"Strange," she said; "strange that at the last the mind of
Antony should have turned back to that night among all the nights
and to the saying of Harmachis. Charmion, dost thou remember
Harmachis the Egyptian?"</p>

<p>"Surely, O Queen," she answered slowly.</p>

<p>"And who, then, was Harmachis?" I asked; for I would learn if
she sorrowed o'er my memory.</p>

<p>"I will tell thee. It is a strange tale, and now that all is
done it may well be told. This Harmachis was of the ancient race
of the Pharaohs, and, having, indeed, been crowned in secret at
Abydus, was sent hither to Alexandria to carry out a great plot
that had been formed against the rule of us royal Lagidae. He
came and gained entry to the palace as my astrologer, for he was
very learned in all magic&mdash;much as thou art,
Olympus&mdash;and a man beautiful to see. Now this was his
plot&mdash;that he should slay me and be named Pharaoh. In truth
it was a strong one, for he had many friends in Egypt, and I had
few. And on that very night when he should carry out his purpose,
yea, at the very hour, came Charmion yonder, and told the plot to
me; saying that she had chanced upon its clue. But, in after
days&mdash;though I have said little thereon to thee,
Charmion&mdash;I misdoubted me much of that tale of thine; for,
by the Gods! to this hour I believe that thou didst love
Harmachis, and because he scorned thee thou didst betray him; and
for that cause also hast all thy days remained a maid, which is a
thing unnatural. Come, Charmion, tell us; for naught matters now
at the end."</p>

<p>Charmion shivered and made answer: "It is true, O Queen; I
also was of the plot, and because Harmachis scorned me I betrayed
him; and because of my great love for him I have remained unwed."
And she glanced up at me and caught my eyes, then let the modest
lashes veil her own.</p>

<p>"So! I thought it. Strange are the ways of women! But little
cause, methinks, had that Harmachis to thank thee for thy love.
What sayest thou, Olympus? Ah, and so thou also wast a traitor,
Charmion? How dangerous are the paths which Monarchs tread! Well,
I forgive thee, for thou hast served me faithfully since that
hour.</p>

<p>"But to my tale. Harmachis I dared not slay, lest his great
party should rise in fury and cast me from the throne. And now
mark the issue. Though he must murder me, in secret this
Harmachis loved me, and something thereof I guessed. I had
striven a little to draw him to me, for the sake of his beauty
and his wit; and for the love of man Cleopatra never strove in
vain. Therefore when, with the dagger in his robe, he came to
slay me, I matched my charms against his will, and need I tell
you, being man and woman, how I won? Oh, never can I forget the
look in the eyes of that fallen prince, that forsworn priest,
that discrowned Pharaoh, when, lost in the poppied draught, I saw
him sink into a shameful sleep whence he might no more wake with
honour! And, thereafter&mdash;till, in the end, I wearied of him,
and his sad learned mind, for his guilty soul forbade him to be
gay&mdash;a little I came to care for him, though not to love.
But he&mdash;he who loved me&mdash; clung to me as a drunkard to
the cup which ruins him. Deeming that I should wed him, he
betrayed to me the secret of the hidden wealth of the pyramid of
<i>Her</i>&mdash;for at the time I much needed treasure&mdash;and
together we dared the terrors of the tomb and drew it forth, even
from dead Pharaoh's breast. See, this emerald was a part
thereof!"&mdash;and she pointed to the great scarabaeus that she
had drawn from the holy heart of Menkau-ra.</p>

<p>"And because of what was written in the tomb, and of that
Thing which we saw in the tomb&mdash;ah, pest upon it! why does
its memory haunt me now? &mdash;and also because of policy, for I
would fain have won the love of the Egyptians, I was minded to
marry this Harmachis and declare his place and lineage to the
world&mdash;ay, and by his aid hold Egypt from the Roman. For
Dellius had then come to call me to Antony, and after much
thought I determined to send him back with sharp words. But on
that very morning, as I tired me for the Court, came Charmion
yonder, and I told her this, for I would see how the matter fell
upon her mind. Now mark, Olympus, the power of jealousy, that
little wedge which yet has strength to rend the tree of Empire,
that secret sword which can carve the fate of Kings! This she
could in no wise bear &mdash;deny it, Charmion, if thou canst,
for now it is clear to me!&mdash; that the man she loved should
be given to me as husband&mdash;me, whom <i>he</i> loved! And
therefore, with more skill and wit than I can tell, she reasoned
with me, showing that I should by no means do this thing, but
journey to Antony; and for that, Charmion, I thank thee, now that
all is come and gone. And by a very little, her words weighed
down my scale of judgment against Harmachis, and I went to
Antony. Thus it is through the jealous spleen of yonder fair
Charmion and the passion of a man on which I played as on a lyre,
that all these things have come to pass. For this cause Octavian
sits a King in Alexandria; for this cause Antony is discrowned
and dead; and for this cause I, too, must die to-night! Ah!
Charmion! Charmion! thou hast much to answer, for thou hast
changed the story of the world; and yet, even now&mdash;I would
not have it otherwise!"</p>

<p>She paused awhile, covering her eyes with her hand; and,
looking, I saw great tears upon the cheek of Charmion.</p>

<p>"And of this Harmachis," I asked; "where is he now, O
Queen?"</p>

<p>"Where is he? In Amenti, forsooth&mdash;making his peace with
Isis, perchance. At Tarsus I saw Antony, and loved him; and from
that moment I loathed the sight of the Egyptian, and swore to
make an end of him; for a lover done with should be a lover dead.
And, being jealous, he spoke some words of evil omen, even at
that Feast of the Pearl; and on the same night I would have slain
him, but before the deed was done, he was gone."</p>

<p>"And whither was he gone?"</p>

<p>"Nay; that know not I. Brennus&mdash;he who led my guard, and
last year sailed North to join his own people&mdash;Brennus swore
he saw him float to the skies; but in this matter I misdoubted me
of Brennus, for methinks he loved the man. Nay, he sank off
Cyprus, and was drowned; perchance Charmion can tell us how?"</p>

<p>"I can tell thee nothing, O Queen; Harmachis is lost."</p>

<p>"And well lost, Charmion, for he was an evil man to play
with&mdash; ay, although I bettered him I say it! Well he served
my purpose; but I loved him not, and even now I fear him; for it
seemed to me that I heard his voice summoning me to fly, through
the din of the fight at Actium. Thanks be to the Gods, as thou
sayest, he is lost, and can no more be found."</p>

<p>But I, listening, put forth my strength, and, by the arts I
have, cast the shadow of my Spirit upon the Spirit of Cleopatra
so that she felt the presence of the lost Harmachis.</p>

<p>"Nay, what is it?" she said. "By Serapis! I grow afraid! It
seems to me that I feel Harmachis here! His memory overwhelms me
like a flood of waters, and he these ten years dead! Oh! at such
a time it is unholy!"</p>

<p>"Nay, O Queen," I answered, "if he be dead then he is
everywhere, and well at such a time&mdash;the time of thy own
death&mdash;may his Spirit draw near to welcome thine at its
going."</p>

<p>"Speak not thus, Olympus. I would see Harmachis no more; the
count between us is too heavy, and in another world than this
more evenly, perchance should we be matched. Ah, the terror
passes! I was but unnerved. Well the fool's story hath served to
wile away the heaviest of our hours, the hour which ends in
death. Sing to me, Charmion, sing, for thy voice is very sweet,
and I would soothe my soul to sleep. The memory of that Harmachis
has wrung me strangely! Sing, then, the last song I shall hear
from those tuneful lips of thine, the last of so many songs."</p>

<p>"It is a sad hour for song, O Queen!" said Charmion; but,
nevertheless, she took her harp and sang. And thus she sang, very
soft and low, the dirge of the sweet-tongued Syrian Meleager:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
Tears for my lady dead,<br>

Heliodore!<br>

Salt tears and strange to shed,<br>

Over and o'er;<br>

Go tears and low lament<br>

Fare from her tomb,<br>

Wend where my lady went,<br>

Down through the gloom&mdash;<br>

Sighs for my lady dead,<br>

Tears do I send,<br>

Long love remembered,<br>

Mistress and friend!<br>

Sad are the songs we sing,<br>

Tears that we shed,<br>

Empty the gifts we bring&mdash;<br>

Gifts to the dead!<br>

Ah, for my flower, my Love,<br>

Hades hath taken,<br>

Ah, for the dust above,<br>

Scattered and shaken!<br>

Mother of blade and grass,<br>

Earth, in thy breast<br>

Lull her that gentlest was,<br>

Gently to rest!</p>

<p><br>
The music of her voice died away, and it was so sweet and sad
that Iras began to weep and the bright tears stood in Cleopatra's
stormy eyes. Only I wept not; my tears were dry.</p>

<p>"'Tis a heavy song of thine, Charmion," said the Queen. "Well,
as thou saidst, it is a sad hour for song, and thy dirge is
fitted to the hour. Sing it over me once again when I lie dead,
Charmion. And now farewell to music, and on to the end. Olympus,
take yonder parchment and write what I shall say."</p>

<p>I took the parchment and the reed, and wrote thus in the Roman
tongue:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Cleopatra to Octavianus, greeting</span>.<br>

<p class="letter">"This is the state of life. At length there
comes an hour when, rather than endure those burdens that
overwhelm us, putting off the body we would take wing into
forgetfulness. Caesar, thou hast conquered: take thou the spoils
of victory. But in thy triumph Cleopatra cannot walk. When all is
lost, then we must go to seek the lost. Thus in the desert of
Despair the brave do harvest Resolution. Cleopatra hath been
great as Antony was great, nor shall her fame be minished in the
manner of her end. Slaves live to endure their wrong; but
Princes, treading with a firmer step, pass through the gates of
Wrong into the royal Dwellings of the Dead. This only doth Egypt
ask of Caesar&mdash;that he suffer her to lie in the tomb of
Antony. Farewell!"</p>

<p><br>
This I wrote, and having sealed the writing, Cleopatra bade me
go find a messenger, despatch it to Caesar, and then return. So I
went, and at the door of the tomb I called a soldier who was not
on duty, and, giving him money, bade him take the letter to
Caesar. Then I went back, and there in the chamber the three
women stood in silence, Cleopatra clinging to the arm of Iras,
and Charmion a little apart watching the twain.</p>

<p>"If indeed thou art minded to make an end, O Queen," I said,
"the time is short, for presently Caesar will send his servants
in answer to thy letter," and I drew forth the phial of white and
deadly bane and set it upon the board.</p>

<p>She took it in her hand and gazed thereon. "How innocent it
seems!" she said; "and yet therein lies my death. 'Tis
strange."</p>

<p>"Ay, Queen, and the death of ten other folk. No need to take
so long a draught."</p>

<p>"I fear," she gasped&mdash;"how know I that it will slay
outright? I have seen so many die by poison and scarce one has
died outright. And some &mdash;ah, I cannot think on them!"</p>

<p>"Fear not," I said, "I am a master of my craft. Or, if thou
dost fear, cast this poison forth and live. In Rome thou mayst
still find happiness; ay, in Rome, where thou shalt walk in
Caesar's triumph, while the laughter of the hard-eyed Latin women
shall chime down the music of thy golden chains."</p>

<p>"Nay, I will die, Olympus. Oh, if one would but show the
path."</p>

<p>Then Iras loosed her hand and stepped forward. "Give me the
draught, Physician," she said. "I go to make ready for my
Queen."</p>

<p>"It is well," I answered; "on thy own head be it!" and I
poured from the phial into a little golden goblet.</p>

<p>She raised it, curtsied low to Cleopatra, then, coming
forward, kissed her on the brow, and Charmion she also kissed.
This done, tarrying not and making no prayer, for Iras was a
Greek, she drank, and, putting her hand to her head, instantly
fell down and died.</p>

<p>"Thou seest," I said, breaking in upon the silence, "it is
swift."</p>

<p>"Ay, Olympus; thine is a master drug! Come now, I thirst; fill
me the bowl, lest Iras weary in waiting at the gates!"</p>

<p>So I poured afresh into the goblet; but this time, making
pretence to rinse the cup, I mixed a little water with the bane,
for I was not minded that she should die before she knew me.</p>

<p>Then did the royal Cleopatra, taking the goblet in her hand,
turn her lovely eyes to heaven and cry aloud:</p>

<p>"O ye Gods of Egypt! who have deserted me, to you no longer
will I pray, for your ears are shut unto my crying and your eyes
blind to my griefs! Therefore, I make entreaty of that last
friend whom the Gods, departing, leave to helpless man. Sweep
hither, Death, whose winnowing wings enshadow all the world, and
give me ear! Draw nigh, thou King of Kings! who, with an equal
hand, bringest the fortunate head of one pillow with the slave,
and by thy spiritual breath dost waft the bubble of our life far
from this hell of earth! Hide me where winds blow not and waters
cease to roll; where wars are done and Caesar's legions cannot
march! Take me to a new dominion, and crown me Queen of Peace!
Thou art my Lord, O Death, and in thy kiss I have conceived. I am
in labour of a Soul: see&mdash;it stands new-born upon the edge
of Time! Now&mdash;now &mdash;go, Life! Come, Sleep! Come,
Antony!"</p>

"O ye Gods of Egypt! who have deserted me, to you no longer
will I pray."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And, with one glance to heaven, she drank, and cast the goblet
to the ground.</p>

<p>Then at last came the moment of my pent-up vengeance, and of
the vengeance of Egypt's outraged Gods, and of the falling of the
curse of Menkau- ra.</p>

<p>"What's this?" she cried; "I grow cold, but I die not! Thou
dark physician, thou hast betrayed me!"</p>

<p>"Peace, Cleopatra! Presently shalt thou die and know the fury
of the Gods! <i>The curse of Menkau-ra hath fallen!</i> It is
finished! Look upon me, woman! Look upon this marred face, this
twisted form, this living mass of sorrow! <i>Look! look!</i> Who
am I?"</p>

<p>She stared upon me wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" she shrieked, throwing up her arms; "at last I know
thee! By the Gods, thou art Harmachis!&mdash;Harmachis risen from
the dead!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Harmachis risen from the dead to drag thee down to death
and agony eternal! See, thou Cleopatra; <i>I</i> have ruined thee
as thou didst ruin me! I, working in the dark, and helped of the
angry Gods, have been thy secret spring of woe! I filled thy
heart with fear at Actium; I held the Egyptians from thy aid; I
sapped the strength of Antony; I showed the portent of the Gods
unto thy captains! By my hand at length thou diest, for I am the
instrument of Vengeance! Ruin I pay thee back for ruin, Treachery
for treachery, Death for death! Come hither, Charmion, partner of
my plots, who betrayed me, but, repenting, art the sharer of my
triumph, come watch this fallen wanton die!"</p>

<p>Cleopatra heard, and sank back upon the golden bed, groaning
"And thou, too, Charmion!"</p>

<p>A moment so she sat, then her Imperial spirit burnt up
glorious before she died.</p>

<p>She staggered from the bed, and, with arms outstretched, she
cursed me.</p>

<p>"Oh! for one hour of life!" she cried&mdash;"one short hour,
that therein I might make thee die in such fashion as thou canst
not dream, thou and that false paramour of thine, who betrayed
both me and thee! And thou didst love me! Ah, <i>there</i> I have
thee still! See, thou subtle, plotting priest" &mdash;and with
both hands she rent back the royal robes from her bosom
&mdash;"see, on this fair breast once night by night thy head was
pillowed, and thou didst sleep wrapped in these same arms. Now,
put away their memory <i>if thou canst!</i> I read it in thine
eyes&mdash;that mayst thou not! No torture which I bear can, in
its sum, draw nigh to the rage of that deep soul of thine, rent
with longings never, never to be reached! Harmachis, thou slave
of slaves, from thy triumph-depths I snatch a deeper triumph, and
conquered yet I conquer! I spit upon thee&mdash;I defy
thee&mdash;and, dying, doom thee to the torment of thy deathless
love! O Antony! I come, my Antony!&mdash;I come to thy own dear
arms! Soon I shall find thee, and, wrapped in a love undying and
divine, together we will float through all the depths of space,
and, lips to lips and eyes to eyes, drink of desires grown more
sweet with every draught! Or if I find thee not, then I shall
sink in peace down the poppied ways of Sleep: and for me the
breast of Night, whereon I shall be softly cradled, will yet seem
thy bosom, Antony! Oh, I die!&mdash;come, Antony&mdash;and give
me peace!"</p>

<p>Even in my fury I had quailed beneath her scorn, for home flew
the arrows of her winged words. Alas! and alas! it was
<i>true</i>&mdash;the shaft of my vengeance fell upon my own
head; never had I loved her as I loved her now. My soul was rent
with jealous torture, and thus I swore she should not die.</p>

<p>"Peace!" I cried; "what peace is there for thee? Oh! ye Holy
Three, hear now my prayer. Osiris, loosen Thou the bonds of Hell
and send forth those whom I shall summon! Come Ptolemy, poisoned
of thy sister Cleopatra; come Arsinoë, murdered in the sanctuary
by thy sister Cleopatra; come Sepa, tortured to death of
Cleopatra; come Divine Menkau-ra, whose body Cleopatra tore and
whose curse she braved for greed; come one, come all who have
died at the hands of Cleopatra! Rush from the breast of Nout and
greet her who murdered you! By the link of mystic union, by the
symbol of the Life, Spirits, I summon you!"</p>

<p>Thus I spoke the spell; while Charmion, affrighted, clung to
my robe, and the dying Cleopatra, resting on her hands, swung
slowly to and fro, gazing with vacant eyes.</p>

<p>Then the answer came. The casement burst asunder, and on
flittering wings that great bat entered which last I had seen
hanging to the eunuch's chin in the womb of the pyramid of
<i>Her</i>. Thrice it circled round, once it hovered o'er dead
Iras, then flew to where the dying woman stood. To her it flew,
on her breast it settled, clinging to that emerald which was
dragged from the dead heart of Menkau-ra. Thrice the grey Horror
screamed aloud, thrice it beat its bony wings, and lo! it was
gone.</p>

<p>Then suddenly within that chamber sprang up the Shapes of
Death. There was Arsinoë, the beautiful, even as she had shrunk
beneath the butcher's knife. There was young Ptolemy, his
features twisted by the poisoned cup. There was the majesty of
Menkau-ra, crowned with the uraeus crown; there was grave Sepa,
his flesh all torn by the torturer's hooks; there were those
poisoned slaves; and there were others without number, shadowy
and dreadful to behold! who, thronging that narrow chamber, stood
silently fixing their glassy eyes upon the face of her who slew
them!</p>

<p>"Behold! Cleopatra!" I said. "<i>Behold thy peace, and
die!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Charmion. "Behold and die! thou who didst rob me of
my honour, and Egypt of her King!"</p>

<p>She looked, she saw the awful Shapes&mdash;her Spirit,
hurrying from the flesh, mayhap could hear words to which my ears
were deaf. Then her face sank in with terror, her great eyes grew
pale, and, shrieking, Cleopatra fell and died: passing, with that
dread company, to her appointed place.</p>

<br>

<p>Thus, then, I, Harmachis, fed my soul with vengeance,
fulfilling the justice of the Gods, and yet knew myself empty of
all joy therein. For though that thing we worship doth bring us
ruin, and Love being more pitiless than Death, we in turn do pay
all our sorrow back; yet we must worship on, yet stretch out our
arms towards our lost Desire, and pour our heart's blood upon the
shrine of our discrowned God.</p>

<p>For Love is of the Spirit, and knows not Death.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HARMION unclasped my arm, to which she had
clung in terror.</p>

<p>"Thy vengeance, thou dark Harmachis," she said, in a hoarse
voice, "is a thing hideous to behold! O lost Egypt, with all thy
sins thou wast indeed a Queen!</p>

<p>"Come, aid me, Prince; let us stretch this poor clay upon the
bed and deck it royally, so that it may give its dumb audience to
the messengers of Caesar as becomes the last of Egypt's
Queens."</p>

<p>I spoke no word in answer, for my heart was very heavy, and
now that all was done I was weary. Together, then, we lifted up
the body and laid it on the golden bed. Charmion placed the
uraeus crown upon the ivory brow, and combed the night-dark hair
that showed never a thread of silver, and, for the last time,
shut those eyes wherein had shone all the changing glories of the
sea. She folded the chill hands upon the breast whence Passion's
breath had fled, and straightened the bent knees beneath the
broidered robe, and by the head set flowers. And there at length
Cleopatra lay, more splendid now in her cold majesty of death
than in her richest hour of breathing beauty!</p>

<p>We drew back and looked on her, and on dead Iras at her
feet.</p>

<p>"It is done!" quoth Charmion; "we are avenged, and now,
Harmachis, dost follow by this same road?" And she nodded towards
the phial on the board.</p>

<p>"Nay, Charmion. I fly&mdash;I fly to a heavier death! Not thus
easily may I end my space of earthly penance."</p>

<p>"So be it, Harmachis! And I, Harmachis&mdash;I fly also, but
with swifter wings. My game is played. I, too, have made
atonement. Oh! what a bitter fate is mine, to have brought misery
on all I love, and, in the end, to die unloved! To thee I have
atoned; to my angered Gods I have atoned; and now I go to find a
way whereby I may atone to Cleopatra in that Hell where she is,
and which I must share! For she loved me well, Harmachis; and,
now that she is dead, methinks that, after thee, I loved her best
of all. So of her cup and the cup of Iras I will surely drink!"
And she took the phial, and with a steady hand poured what was
left of the poison into the goblet.</p>

<p>"Bethink thee, Charmion," I said; "yet mayst thou live for
many years, hiding these sorrows beneath the withered days."</p>

<p>"Yet I may, but I will not! To live the prey of so many
memories, the fount of an undying shame that night by night, as I
lie sleepless, shall well afresh from my sorrow-stricken
heart!&mdash;to live torn by a love I cannot lose!&mdash;to stand
alone like some storm-twisted tree, and, sighing day by day to
the winds of heaven, gaze upon the desert of my life, while I
wait the lingering lightning's stroke&mdash;nay, that will not I,
Harmachis! I had died long since, but I lived on to serve thee;
now no more thou needest me, and I go. Oh, fare thee
well!&mdash;for ever fare thee well! For not again shall I look
again upon thy face, and there I go thou goest not! For thou dost
not love me who still dost love that queenly woman thou hast
hounded to the death! Her thou shalt never win, and I thee shall
never win, and this is the bitter end of Fate! See, Harmachis: I
ask one boon before I go and for all time become naught to thee
but a memory of shame. Tell me that thou dost forgive me so far
as thine is to forgive, and in token thereof kiss me&mdash;with
no lover's kiss, but kiss me on the brow, and bid me pass in
peace."</p>

<p>And she drew near to me with arms outstretched and pitiful
trembling lips and gazed upon my face.</p>

<p>"Charmion," I answered, "we are free to act for good or evil,
and yet methinks there is a Fate above our fate, that, blowing
from some strange shore, compels our little sails of purpose, set
them as we will, and drives us to destruction. I forgive thee,
Charmion, as I trust in turn to be forgiven, and by this kiss,
the first and the last, I seal our peace." And with my lips I
touched her brow.</p>

<p>She spoke no more; only for a little while she stood gazing on
me with sad eyes. Then she lifted the goblet, and said:</p>

<p>"Royal Harmachis, in this deadly cup I pledge thee! Would that
I had drunk of it ere ever I looked upon thy face! Pharaoh, who,
thy sins outworn, yet shalt rule in perfect peace o'er worlds I
may not tread, who yet shalt sway a kinglier sceptre than that I
robbed thee of, for ever, fare thee well!"</p>

<p>She drank, cast down the cup, and for a moment stood with the
wide eyes of one who looks for Death. Then He came, and Charmion
the Egyptian fell prone upon the floor, dead. And for a moment
more I stood alone with the dead.</p>

<p>I crept to the side of Cleopatra, and, now that none were left
to see, I sat down on the bed and laid her head upon my knee, as
once before it had been laid in that night of sacrilege beneath
the shadow of the everlasting pyramid. Then I kissed her chill
brow and went from the House of Death&mdash;avenged, but sorely
smitten with despair!</p>

<p>"Physician," said the officer of the Guard as I went through
the gates, "what passes yonder in the Monument? Methought I heard
the sounds of death."</p>

<p>"Naught passes&mdash;all hath passed," I made reply, and
went.</p>

<p>And as I went in the darkness I heard the sound of voices and
the running of the feet of Caesar's messengers.</p>

<p>Flying swiftly to my house I found Atoua waiting at the gates.
She drew me into a quiet chamber and closed the doors.</p>

<p>"Is it done?" she asked, and turned her wrinkled face to mine,
while the lamplight streamed white upon her snowy hair. "Nay, why
ask I&mdash;I know that it is done!"</p>

<p>"Ay, it is done, and well done, old wife! All are dead!
Cleopatra, Iras, Charmion&mdash;all save myself!"</p>

<p>The aged woman drew up her bent form and cried: "Now let me go
in peace, for I have seen my desire upon thy foes and the foes of
Khem. <i>La! la!</i> &mdash;not in vain have I lived on beyond
the years of man! I have seen my desire upon thy enemies&mdash;-I
have gathered the dews of Death, and thy foe hath drunk thereof!
Fallen is the brow of Pride! the Shame of Khem is level with the
dust! Ah, would that I might have seen that wanton die!"</p>

<p>"Cease, woman! cease! The Dead are gathered to the Dead!
Osiris holds them fast, and everlasting silence seals their lips!
Pursue not the fallen great with insults! Up!&mdash;let us fly to
Abouthis, that all may be accomplished!"</p>

<p>"Fly thou, Harmachis!&mdash;Harmachis, fly&mdash;but I fly
not! To this end only I have lingered on the earth. Now I untie
the knot of life and let my spirit free! Fare thee well, Prince,
the pilgrimage is done! Harmachis, from a babe have I loved thee,
and love thee yet!&mdash;but no more in this world may I share
thy griefs&mdash;I am spent. Osiris, take thou my Spirit!" and
her trembling knees gave way and she sank to the ground.</p>

<p>I ran to her side and looked upon her. She was already dead,
and I was alone upon the earth without a friend to comfort
me!</p>

<p>Then I turned and went, no man hindering me, for all was
confusion in the city, and departed from Alexandria in a vessel I
had made ready. On the eighth day, I landed, and, in the carrying
out of my purpose, travelled on foot across the fields to the
Holy Shrine of Abouthis. And here, as I knew, the worship of the
Gods had been lately set up again in the Temple of the Divine
Sethi: for Charmion had caused Cleopatra to repent of her decree
of vengeance and to restore the lands that she had seized, though
the treasure she restored not. And the temple having been
purified, now, at the season of the Feast of Isis, all the High
Priests of the ancient Temples of Egypt were gathered together to
celebrate the coming home of the Gods into their holy place.</p>

<p>I gained the city. It was on the seventh day of the Feast of
Isis. Even as I came the long array wended through the well-
remembered streets. I joined in the multitude that followed, and
with my voice swelled the chorus of the solemn chant as we passed
through the pylons into the imperishable halls. How well known
were the holy words:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Softly we tread, our measured footsteps falling<br>

Within the Sanctuary Sevenfold;<br>

Soft on the Dead that liveth are we calling:<br>

'Return, Osiris, from thy Kingdom cold!<br>

Return to them that worship thee of old!'"</p>

<p><br>
And then, when the sacred music ceased, as aforetime on the
setting of the majesty of Ra, the High Priest raised the statue
of the living God and held it on high before the multitude.</p>

<p>With a joyful shout of</p>

<p><i>"Osiris! our hope, Osiris! Osiris!"</i></p>

<p>the people tore the black wrappings from their dress, showing
the white robes beneath, and, as one man, bowed before the
God.</p>

<p>Then they went to feast each at his home; but I stayed in the
court of the temple.</p>

<p>Presently a priest of the temple drew near, and asked me of my
business. And I answered him that I came from Alexandria, and
would be led before the council of the High Priests, for I knew
that the Holy Priests were gathered together debating the tidings
from Alexandria.</p>

<p>Thereon the man left, and the High Priests, hearing that I was
from Alexandria, ordered that I should be led into their presence
in the Hall of Columns&mdash;and so I was led in. It was already
dark, and between the great pillars lights were set, as on that
night when I was crowned Pharaoh of the Upper and the Lower Land.
There, too, was the long line of Dignitaries seated in their
carven chairs, and taking counsel together. All was the same; the
same cold images of Kings and Gods gazed with the same empty eyes
from the everlasting walls. Ay, more; among those gathered there
were five of the very men who, as leaders of the great plot, had
sat here to see me crowned, being the only conspirators who had
escaped the vengeance of Cleopatra and the clutching hand of
Time.</p>

<p>I took my stand on the spot where once I had been crowned and
made me ready for the last act of shame with such bitterness of
heart as cannot be written.</p>

<p>"Why, it is the physician Olympus," said one. "He who lived a
hermit in the Tombs of Tápé, and who but lately was of the
household of Cleopatra. Is it, then, true that the Queen is dead
by her own hand, Physician?"</p>

<p>"Yea, holy Sirs, I am that physician; also Cleopatra is dead
by <i>my</i>hand."</p>

<p>"By thy hand? Why, how comes this?&mdash;though well is she
dead, forsooth, the wicked wanton!"</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Sirs, and I will tell you all, for I am come
hither to that end. Perchance among you there may be
some&mdash;methinks I see some &mdash;who, nigh eleven years ago,
were gathered in this hall to secretly crown one Harmachis,
Pharaoh of Khem?"</p>

<p>"It is true!" they said; "but how knowest thou these things,
thou Olympus?"</p>

<p>"Of the rest of those seven-and-thirty nobles," I went on,
making no answer, "are two-and-thirty missing. Some are dead, as
Amenemhat is dead; some are slain, as Sepa is slain; and some,
perchance, yet labour as slaves within the mines, or live afar,
fearing vengeance."</p>

<p>"It is so," they said: "alas! it is so. Harmachis the accursed
betrayed the plot, and sold himself to the wanton Cleopatra!"</p>

<p>"It is so," I went on, lifting up my head. "Harmachis betrayed
the plot and sold himself to Cleopatra; and, holy Sirs&mdash;<i>I
am that Harmachis!</i>"</p>

<p>The Priests and Dignitaries gazed astonished. Some rose and
spoke; some said naught.</p>

<p>"I am that Harmachis! I am that traitor, trebly steeped in
crime! &mdash;a traitor to my Gods, a traitor to my Country, a
traitor to my Oath! I come hither to say that I have done this. I
have executed the Divine vengeance on her who ruined me and gave
Egypt to the Roman. And now that, after years of toil and patient
waiting, this is accomplished by my wisdom and the help of the
angry Gods, behold I come with all my shame upon my head to
declare the thing I am, and take the traitor's guerdon!"</p>

<p>"Mindest thou of the doom of him who hath broke the oath that
may not be broke?" asked he who first had spoken, in heavy
tones.</p>

<p>"I know it well," I answered; "I court that awful doom."</p>

<p>"Tell us more of this matter, thou who wast Harmachis."</p>

<p>So, in cold clear words, I laid bare all my shame, keeping
back nothing. And ever as I spoke I saw their faces grow more
hard, and knew that for me there was no mercy; nor did I ask it,
nor, had I asked, could it have been granted.</p>

<p>When, at last, I had done, they put me aside while they took
counsel. Then they drew me forth again, and the eldest among
them, a man very old and venerable, the Priest of the Temple of
the Divine Hatshepu at Tápé, spoke, in icy accents:</p>

<p>"Thou Harmachis, we have considered this matter. Thou hast
sinned the threefold deadly sin. On thy head lies the burden of
the woe of Khem, this day enthralled of Rome. To Isis, the Mother
Mystery, thou hast offered the deadly insult, and thou hast
broken thy holy oath. For all of these sins there is, as well
thou knowest, but one reward, and that reward is thine. Naught
can it weigh in the balance of our justice that thou hast slain
her who was thy cause of stumbling; naught that thou comest to
name thyself the vilest thing who ever stood within these walls.
On thee also must fall the curse of Menkau-ra, thou false priest!
thou forsworn patriot! thou Pharaoh shameful and discrowned!
Here, where we set the Double Crown upon thy head, we doom thee
to the doom! Go to thy dungeon and await the falling of its
stroke! Go, remembering what thou mightest have been and what
thou art, and may those Gods who through thy evil doing shall
perchance ere long cease to be worshipped within these holy
temples, give to thee that mercy which we deny! Lead him
forth!"</p>

<p>So they took me and led me forth. With bowed head I went,
looking not up, and yet I felt their eyes burn upon my face.</p>

<p>Oh! surely of all my shames this is the heaviest!</p>

<p class="first">HEY led me to the prison chamber that is high
in the pylon tower and here I wait my doom. I know not when the
sword of Fate shall fall. Week grows to week, and month to month,
and still it is delayed. Still it quivers unseen above my head. I
know that it will fall, but when I know not. Perchance, I shall
wake in some dead hour of midnight to hear the stealthy steps of
the slayers and be hurried forth. Perchance, they are now at
hand. Then will come the secret cell! the horror! the nameless
coffin! and at last it will be done! Oh, let it come! let it come
swiftly!</p>

<p>All is written; I have held back nothing&mdash;my sin is
sinned &mdash;my vengeance is finished. Now all things end in
darkness and in ashes, and I prepare to face the terrors that are
to come in other worlds than this. I go, but not without hope I
go: for, though I see Her not, though no more She answers to my
prayers, still I am aware of the Holy Isis, who is with me for
evermore, and whom I shall yet again behold face to face. And
then at last in that far day I shall find forgiveness; then the
burden of my guilt will roll from me and innocency come back and
wrap me round, bringing me holy Peace.</p>

<p>Oh! dear land of Khem, as in a dream I see thee! I see Nation
after Nation set its standard on thy shores, and its yoke upon
thy neck! I see new Religions without end calling out their
truths upon the banks of Sihor, and summoning thy people to their
worship! I see thy temples&mdash;thy holy temples&mdash;crumbling
in the dust: a wonder to the sight of men unborn, who shall peer
into thy tombs and desecrate the great ones of thy glory! I see
thy mysteries a mockery to the unlearned, and thy wisdom wasted
like waters on the desert sands! I see the Roman Eagles stoop and
perish, their beaks yet red with the blood of men, and the long
lights dancing down the barbarian spears that follow in their
wake! And then, at last, I see Thee once more great, once more
free, and having once more a knowledge of thy Gods&mdash;ay, thy
Gods with a changed countenance, and called by other names, but
still thy Gods!</p>

<p>The sun sinks over Abouthis. The red rays of Ra flame on
temple roofs, upon green fields, and the wide waters of father
Sihor. So as a child I watched him sink; just so his last kiss
touched the further pylon's frowning brow; just that same shadow
lay upon the tombs. All is unchanged! I&mdash;I only am
changed&mdash;so changed, and yet the same!</p>

<p>Oh, Cleopatra! Cleopatra! thou Destroyer! If I might but tear
thy vision from my heart! Of all my griefs, this is the heaviest
grief&mdash;still must I love thee! Still must I hug this serpent
to my heart! Still in my ears must ring that low laugh of
triumph&mdash;the murmur of the falling fountain &mdash;the song
of the nightinga...</p>
