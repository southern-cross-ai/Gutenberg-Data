<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>Preface</h2>

<p>A complete history of the exploration of Australia will never be
written. The story of the settlement of our continent is
necessarily so intermixed with the results of private travels and
adventures, that all the historian can do is to follow out the
career of the public expeditions, and those of private origin which
extended to such a distance, and embraced such important
discoveries, as to render the results matters of national
history.</p>

<p>That private individuals have done the bulk of the detail work
there is no denying; but that work, although every whit as useful
to the community as the more brilliant exploits that carried with
them the publicity of Government patronage, has not found the same
careful preservation.</p>

<p>To find the material to write such a history would necessitate
the work of a lifetime, and the co-operation of hundreds of old
colonists; and, when written, it would inevitably, from the nature
of the subject, prove most monotonous reading, and fill, I am
afraid to think, how many volumes. The reader has but to consider
the immense area of country now under pastoral occupation, and to
remember that each countless subordinate river and tributary creek
was the result of some extended research of the pioneer squatter,
to realise this.</p>

<p>Since the hope of finding an inland sea, or main central range,
vanished for ever, the explorer cannot hope to discover anything
much more exciting or interesting than country fitted for human
habitation. The attributes of the native tribes are very similar
throughout. Since the day when Captain Phillip and his little band
settled down here and tried to gain the friendship of the
aboriginal, no startling difference has been found in him
throughout the continent. As he was when Dampier came to our
shores, so is he now in the yet untrodden parts of Australia, and
the explorer knows that from him he can only gain but a hazardous
and uncertain tale of what lies beyond.</p>

<p>But, in this utter want of knowledge of the country to be
explored, where even the physical laws do not assimilate with those
of other continents, lies the great charm of Australian
exploration. It is the spectacle of one man pitted against the
whole force of nature&mdash;not the equal struggle of two human
antagonists, but the old fable of the subtle dwarf and the
self-confident giant.</p>

<p>When the battle commenced between Sturt and the interior, he
was, as he thought, vanquished, though in reality the victor.</p>

<p>In the history of exploration are to be found some of the
brightest examples of courage and fortitude presented by any
record. In the succeeding pages I have tried to bring these
episodes prominently to the fore, and bestow upon them the meed of
history.</p>

<p>In compiling this book I have had the sympathy of many
gentlemen, both in this and the neighbouring colonies, and my best
thanks are due to them, especially as, owing to it, I have been
able to make the work perfectly authentic, and I trust, a
thoroughly reliable work of reference.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The charm of romance and adventure surrounding the discovery of
hitherto unknown lands has from the earliest ages been the lure
that has tempted men to prosecute voyages and travels of
exploration. Whether under the pretext of science, religion or
conquest, hardship and danger have alike been undergone with
fortitude and cheerfulness, in the hope of being the first to find
things strange and new, and return to civilized communities with
the tidings.</p>

<p>In the days of Spain's supremacy, after the eyes of Europe had
been dazzled with the sight of riches brought from the New World,
and men's ears filled with fairy-like tales of the wondrous races
discovered, it was but natural that the adventurous gallants of
that age should roam in search of seas yet to be won.</p>

<p>Some such hope of finding a land wherein the glorious conquests
of Cortes and Pizarro could be repeated, brought De Quiros on a
quest that led him almost within hail of our shores. What little
realization of his dreams of cities rich with temples, blazing with
barbaric gold, inhabited by semi-civilized people skilled in
strange arts he would have found in the naked nomads of Terra
Australis, and their rude shelters of boughs and bark we now know;
and perhaps, it was as well for the skilful pilot that he died with
his mission unfulfilled, save in fancy. His lieutenant, Torres,
came nearer solving the secret of the Southern Seas, and, in fact,
reports sighting hills to the southward, which&mdash;on slight
foundation&mdash;are supposed to have been the present Cape York,
but more probably were the higher lands of Prince of Wales Island.
In all likelihood he saw enough of the natives of the Straits to
convince him that no such rich pickings were to be had, as had
fallen to the lot of the lucky conquerors of Mexico and Peru. He
came across none of the legendary canoes from the land of gold,
deep laden with the precious metal, nor sandy beaches strewn with
jewels, to be had for the gathering. He puts on record what he
thought of the islanders in the few terse words, that they were
"black, naked and corpulent," beyond that, they do not seem to have
impressed him.</p>

<p>Apparently they, on their part, were not impressed at being
informed that they were thenceforth subjects of the King of Spain,
for their dislike to Europeans appears to have increased as the
unfortunate Dutch captains, Carstens and Poole, afterwards found to
their cost. Even the gracious act of His Holiness the Pope in
partitioning these unknown lands between Spain and Portugal did not
meet with the favourable consideration at their hands that it
deserved.</p>

<p>The jealousy with which the maritime nations of Europe guarded
their discoveries from each other has been the means of putting
great difficulties in the way of tracing out the early traditions
of the great South Land. The domineering Spaniard looked upon the
Portugese navigator as a formidable rival in the race for trade;
and the sturdy Hollander they regarded as a natural enemy and a
rebel. The generous emulation of fellow-workers in the cause of
scientific discovery was unknown, and the secrets of the sea were
scrupulously kept.</p>

<p>On behalf of Dutch reticence, it may be said that the cause of
the merited hatred they bore to Spain was still too fresh in their
memory to allow them to divulge anything that might possibly
benefit a Spaniard.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple, ambassador at the Hague in the time of
Charles II., gives it as his opinion that "a southern continent has
long since been found out." He avers that, according to
descriptions he has gathered," it is as long as Java, and is marked
on the maps by the name of New Holland, but to what extent the land
extends either to the south, the east, or the west, none know." He
states, that he has heard it said among the Dutch that their East
India Company "have long since forbidden, and under the greatest
penalties, any further attempts at discovering that continent,
having already more trade than they can turn to account, and
fearing some more populous nation of Europe might make great
establishments of trade in some of these unknown regions, which
might ruin or impair what they already have in the Indies."</p>

<p>But although no documentary evidence has been brought to light,
proving beyond all doubt the certain discovery of the South Land in
the sixteenth century, we find on the old charts of the world
various tracings indicating a knowledge of the existence of this
continent, which would appear to have been derived from other than
fabulous sources.</p>

<p>A shadowy claim to the honour of being the first discoverer of
Terra Australis has been advanced on behalf of the Frenchman
Gonneville, who sailed from Honfleur in 1503, on a voyage to the
East Indies. He is said to have doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and
being driven by stress of weather into an unknown sea, found a land
inhabited by friendly people, with whom he stayed some time, being
accompanied back to France by one of the king's sons who was
desirous of studying the precepts of Christianity. The general
belief, however, is that it was probably Madagascar whereon De
Gonneville landed.</p>

<p>Another claim, based upon the authority of an ancient map, is
put forward for the noted Portugese navigator Magalhaens, when in
the service of the Emperor Charles V. of Spain; but there is little
appertaining to the arguments advanced on behalf of this belief to
render it credible.</p>

<p>In some of the old charts, dating back to the middle of the
sixteenth century, a large country south of Java is portrayed,
which from its position appears to be intended for the conjectural
South Land. In all these maps the outlines of this <i>terra
incognita</i> are so nearly identical that it is evident various
hydrographers drew their inspirations from the same sources. The
annexed tracing is a copy of a portion of one of the most ancient
of these maps; the original was presented to the British Museum by
Sir Joseph Banks in 1790. It is most carefully drawn, the coast
line being elaborately filled in with names in French, and it is
embellished with drawings of animals and men, being also ornamented
with two shields bearing the arms of France. The map is undated,
but was probably designed in the latter part of the reign of
Francis L, for his son, the Dauphin, afterwards Henry II.</p>

<p>It has been alleged that Captain Cook was guided by these charts
to the eastern shore of New Holland, and the similarity of some of
the names thereon, such as <i>Coste des Herbaiges</i>, and <i>Coste
Dangerouse</i>, to names given by him, has been pointed out. This
allegation, however, will not stand criticism. Botany Bay, for
instance, is about the last place that any one would select to
bestow such a name on as <i>Coste des Herbaiges</i>, which name
would signify a rich and fertile spot, certainly not such a
desolate place as Botany Bay was in Captain Cook's time. Captain
Tench, one of the survey party sent there in 1789, writes in his
journal:&mdash;"We were unanimously of the opinion that had not the
nautical part of Mr. Cook's description been so accurately laid
down, there would exist the utmost reason to believe that those who
have described the contiguous country had never seen it. On the
side of the harbour, a line of sea coast more than thirty miles
long, we did not find two hundred acres which could be cultivated."
Any approximation then in position between Botany Bay and the
fabulous <i>Coste des Herbaiges</i> must be considered as
accidental.</p>

<p>The generally received opinion of this and the other charts is,
that Java (<i>Jave</i>) is fairly well laid down, and that Great
Java stands for the supposed South Land. Plausible as this theory
reads, it is, however, open to objection. If it be accepted, and
the narrow strait the river <i>Grande</i> be looked upon as that
portion of the Indian Ocean dividing Java from the north-west coast
of Australia, any resemblance to the present known shape of our
continent is very hard to trace, unless after a most distorted
fashion. If, however, we make the necessary allowances for the many
errors that would creep in from one transcription to another, and
look upon <i>Jave</i> and <i>Jave la Grande</i> as one continent
intersected by a mediterranean sea, we have a fair, if rude,
conception of the north coast of Australia. Moreover, let the
reader imagine a south coast line drawn from <i>Baye Perdue</i> on
the east to <i>Havre de Sylla</i> on the west, doing away with the
conjectural east and west coast continuations south of those
points; the deep inlet between <i>Jave</i> and <i>Jave la
Grande</i> standing for the Gulf of Carpentaria, a very passable
outline of the whole continent is obtained. And it is more than
probable that this view was originally suggested by this map, and
from it sprang the belief current, even to the beginning of this
century, that an open passage existed from the west coast, either
into the Gulf of Carpentaria, or to the head of Spencer's Gulf. The
other maps give no more information than this one, and the identity
of their origin is obvious. One, however, has been found in the
British Museum the features of which are different. It is a rough
copy of an old map showing the north west portion of a continent to
the south of "Java Major." It bears a legend in Portugese, of which
the following is a translation:&mdash;"Nuca Antara was discovered
in the year 1601 by Manoel Godinho Eredia, by command of the
Viceroy Ayres de Soldanha." This would point to a Portugese
discovery of Australia immediately preceding the Dutch one.</p>

<p>In Cornelius Wytfliet's "Descriptionis Ptolemaicae Augmentum,"
Louvain, 1598, the following passage is to be found:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The Australis Terra is the most southern of all lands;
it is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait; its shores are
hitherto but little known, since, after one voyage and another,
that route has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited
unless when sailors are driven there by storms. The Australis Terra
begins at two or three degrees from the equator, and is maintained
by some to be of so great an extent that if it were thoroughly
explored it would be regarded as a fifth part of the
world."</blockquote>

<p>The above is so vague and suppositious that it would scarcely be
worth quoting, were it not for the singular mention of the narrow
strait separating Australis Terra from New Guinea; for at this time
Torres had not sailed through the straits, nor was the fact of his
having done so known to the world until the end of the eighteenth
century, when Dalrymple discovered his report amongst the archives
of Manila, and did justice to his memory.</p>

<p>In 1605, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, having for his second in
command Luis Vaez de Torres, sailed from Callao with two well-armed
vessels and a corvette. After the discovery of several islands,
they came to a land which Quiros supposed to be the continent he
was in search of, and therefore named it Australia del Espiritu
Santo. "At one hour past midnight," says Torres, in his account of
the voyage, "the <i>Capitana</i>" (Quiros' vessel) "departed
without any notice given to us, and without making any signal."
This extraordinary conduct was supposed to be the result of
discontent and mutiny amongst the sailors, an outbreak having
already taken place which was not quelled quite so firmly as Torres
advocated. After vainly waiting for many days, Torres set sail, and
first ascertaining that it was only an island where they had been
anchored, he made his way by the dangerous south coast of New
Guinea to Manila, where he arrived in 1607.</p>

<p>Up to the preceding year popular knowledge concerning the South
Land must be looked upon as being mixed up with much that is both
doubtful and hazardous. We now, however, reach the period which may
be regarded as the beginning of the authentic history of the
discovery of New Holland. In 1606 the yacht <i>Duyfhen</i> sailed
from Bantam, and, coasting along the south-west shore of New
Guinea, her commander unknowingly crossed the entrance of Torres
Straits, and continued his voyage along the eastern side of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, under the impression that it was part of the
same country. They sailed nearly to latitude 14 degrees south, when
want of provisions and other necessaries compelled them to turn
back. Cape Keer-Weer (Turn Again) they named the furthest point
reached by them. Their report of the country was most unfavourable.
They described it as being "for the greatest part desert, but in
some places inhabited by wild, cruel, black savages, by whom some
of the crew were murdered, for which reason they could not learn
anything of the land or waters as had been desired of them."</p>

<p>The name of the captain of the <i>Duyfhen</i>&mdash;the Columbus
of the south&mdash;has not been preserved. Ten years after this
visit, in 1616, Captain Dirk Hartog, in command of the ship
<i>Endracht</i>, from Amsterdam, discovered the west coast of
Australia. He left a tin plate on an island in Dirk Hartog's Roads
bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ao 1616, den 25sten October, is hier vangecommen het schip de
<i>Endracht</i> van Amsterdam, den Oppercoopmen Gilles Mibais van
Luyck; schipper Dirk Hartog, van Amsterdam, den 27sten, dito t'
zeijl gegaen na Bantam, den Ondercoopman Jan Stoyn, Opperstierman
Pieter Dockes, van Bil, Ao 1616."</p>

<p>[Translation.&mdash;On the 25th October, arrived here the ship
Endraght of Amsterdam; the first merchant, Gilles Mibais, of Luyck;
Captain Dirk Hartog; of Amsterdam; the 27th ditto set sail for
Bantam; undermerchant Jan Stoyn, upper steersman, Pieter Dockes,
from Bil, Ao, 1616.]</p>

<p>Captain Vlaming, of the ship <i>Geelvink</i>, found this plate
in 1697, and replaced it with another, on which he copied the
original inscription, and added to it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1697. Den 4den Februaij is hier vangecommen het schip de
<i>Geelvink</i> van Amsterdam, den Commandeur schipper, Williem de
Vlamingh, van Vlielandt, Adsistent Joan van Bremen, van Coppenhage;

<i>Nyptang</i>, schipper Gerrit Collaert van Amsterdam; Adsistent
Theodorus Heermans van de; d`Opperstierman Gerrit Gerritz, van
Bremen, 't Galjoot t' <i>Weseltje</i>, Gezaghabber Cornelis de
Vlamingh van Vlielandt; Stierman Coert Gerritz, van Bremen, en van
hier gezeilt met ons vloot den 12do voorts net Zuijtland te
ondersoecken en gedestineert voor Batavia."</p>

<p>[Translation.&mdash;On the 4th of February, 1697, arrived here

Vlamingh, of Welandt; assistant, Jan van Bremen, of Copenhagen;

<i>Nyptangh</i>, Captain Gerrit Collaert, of Amsterdam, Assistant
Theodorus Heermans, of the same place; first pilot, Gerrit Gerritz,
of Bremen; then the galliot <i>Weseltje</i>, Commander Cornelis de
Vlaming, of Vlielandt; Pilot Coert Gerritz, from Bremen. Sailed
from here with our fleet on the 12th, to explore the South Land,
and afterwards bound for Batavia.]</p>

<p>In 1801, the boatswain of the <i>Naturaliste</i> found this
plate half buried in sand, lying near an oaken post to which it had
been nailed. Captain Hamelin, with rare good taste, had a new post
made, and the plate erected in the old spot. Another outward bound
ship, the <i>Mauritius</i>, touched on the west coast in 1618, and
discovered and named the Willems River, near the Northwest Cape,
probably the present Ashburton. The <i>Leeuwin</i> (Lioness),
visited the west coast in 1622, and the well-known reef of
Houtman's Abrolhos was so-called after Frederick Houtman, a Dutch
navigator of distinction who, however, never personally visited
Australian shores. The next navigator to the South Land met with an
untimely end. In the year 1623, Governor Coen dispatched two
yachts, the <i>Pera</i> and the <i>Arnhem</i>, on a voyage of
discovery. Landing on the coast of New Guinea, Captain Jan
Carstens, of the <i>Arnhem</i>, and eight of his crew were murdered
by the natives, but the vessels proceeded, and touched upon the
north coast of New Holland, west of the Gulf of Carpentaria, still
known as Arnhem's Land. A river, the Spult, is here laid down in
the old charts, in the vicinity of the present Liverpool River, and
there is also another opening marked the "Speult," on the eastern
side of the Gulf, since determined to be the Endeavour Strait of
Captain Cook,</p>

<p>At Arnhem's Land the yachts parted, the Pera continuing the
voyage alone. Crossing the head of the Gulf she followed the course
of the <i>Duyfhen</i>, and passing Cape Keer-Weer, made as far
south as 17 degrees, where the Staaten River is laid down. Their
report was also unfavourable, and is summed up in the official
dispatches of the company, thus:&mdash;"In this discovery were
found everywhere shallow waters and barren coasts, islands
altogether thinly peopled by divers cruel, poor, and brutal
nations, and of very little use to the Dutch East India Company."
Pera Head, in the Gulf, is another memorial of this voyage.</p>

<p>Now came the turn of the south coast of New Holland. In 1627,
Captain Pieter Nuyts, in his ship the <i>Gulde Zeepard</i>,
accidentally touched on the south coast. He followed it along for
seven or eight hundred miles, and bestowed on it the name of Pieter
Nuyts' Land. The <i>Vianen</i> sighted the west coast in 1628, and
kept in sight of it for some two hundred miles, reporting "a foul
and barren shore, green fields; and very wild, black, barbarous
inhabitants."</p>

<p>The wreck of the <i>Batavia</i> on Houtman's Abrolhos, in 1629,
is one of the most tragic incidents in early Australian history.
The <i>Batavia</i>, commanded by Commodore Francis Pelsart, was
separated from her consorts by a storm, and during the night of the
4th of June struck on the rocks of Frederick Houtman. The crew and
passengers were landed on one island, and two small islets in the
neighbourhood, and the ship broke up. No fresh water was found, and
Pelsart sailed in one of the boats in search of some on the
mainland. He was unsuccessful, and finally steered for Batavia.
Meanwhile, a terrible scene of riot and murder was enacted. Jerome
Cornelis, the supercargo, headed a mutiny, and those refusing to
join his band were in part cruelly assassinated. One company
however, on one of the islets, in charge of Weybehays defended
themselves valiantly, finally taking Cornelis prisoner. Fresh water
was found, and the two hostile camps awaited the reappearance of
Pelsart. The design of the mutineers had been to surprise Pelsart
on his return, capture his vessel, and sail away on a piratical
cruise. The determined front shown by Weybehays and his party, who,
although unarmed, had twice defeated them with some slaughter,
disarranged their plans.</p>

<p>When the <i>Sardam</i>, with Pelsart on board, hove in sight of
the Abrolhos, the smoke rising from the islands assured the
captain, who was naturally tormented with anxiety, that some, at
any rate survived. To their surprise, a boat came off to meet them,
pulled by men dressed in rich uniforms, made from the silks and
stuffs that had formed part of the <i>Batavia's</i> cargo.
Pelsart's suspicions were at once aroused, knowing as he did, that
insubordination had shown itself even before his departure. These
men were ordered to come on board unarmed, with the alternative of
being sunk, and Weybehays coming off at the same time, they had no
choice but to obey, and the whole of the mutineers were soon in
irons. After recovering most of the treasure, with the exception of
one chest, containing eight' thousand rix dollars, a consultation
was held as to the fate of the murderers. It was unanimously
decided that, having in view the overcrowded state of the ship, and
the temptation presented by the recovered treasure, the presence of
such turbulent spirits on board would be dangerous to the safety of
the company. Therefore, it was thought best to try the offenders
there and then, instead of taking them to Batavia. This was done,
and the sentences at once carried into effect. Two men, however,
were condemned to the more lingering punishment of being marooned
on the mainland, there to meet a cruel death at the hands of the
savages. These two blood-stained criminals were the first Europeans
to leave their bones in Australia, an unhappy omen of the future.
According to the instructions issued to Tasman, on his second
voyage, he was directed to "enquire at the continent thereabout"
(i.e., the neighbourhood of the Abrolhos) "after two Dutchmen, who,
having by the enormity of their crimes forfeited their lives, were
put on shore by the Commodore Francisco Pelsart, if still alive. In
such case, you may make inquiries of them about the situation of
those countries, and if they entreat you to that purpose, give them
passage thither." He was also instructed to recover, if possible,
the chest of rix dollars. Unfortunately Tasman's journal has never
been discovered, and it is not known how he fared on his
mission.</p>

<p>Captain Gerrit Tomaz Poole sailed from Banda in 1636, with the
yachts <i>Klyn, Amsterdam</i>, and <i>Wesel</i>, to meet his death
on the New Guinea coast, in the same place that had been fatal to
Carstens, and in a like manner. The supercargo took charge, and
prosecuted the voyage, revisiting Arnhem's Land.</p>

<p>A name familiar to all is that of Abel Janz Tasman. In 1644,
after his discovery of Van Dieman's Land, he was sent out on a
second voyage of exploration. His instructions were: "To discover
whether Nova Guinea is one continent with the Great South Land, or
separated by channels and islands lying between them, and also
whether that New Van Dieman's Land" (Arnhem's Land) "is the same
continent with these two great countries, or with one of them." He
was also directed to search for the strait between New Guinea and
New Holland, in a large opening said to exist in that locality.
Apparently, this portion of his instructions was, for some reasons,
not thoroughly carried out.</p>

<p>Although Tasman's journal of this voyage has never been found,
we have pretty good evidence that he safely accomplished it.
Dampier, in his volume of voyages, mentions having in his
possession a chart laid down by Tasman, and an outline copy of the
same was inlaid in the floor of the Groote Zaal, in the Stadhuys in
Amsterdam. The annexed tracing is from a fairly authenticated copy
of Tasman's map, with the discoveries of former navigators
attached, soundings being given along that portion of the
north-west coast that would have embraced Tasman's proposed track.
Many of the names still retained in the Gulf of Carpentaria are
significant of Tasman's visit. Vanderlin Island, after Cornelis Van
der Lyn; Sweer's Island, after Salamon Sweers; Maria Island, after
his supposed sweetheart, Maria Van Dieman; and Limmen Bight, after
his ship, the <i>Limmen</i>. This chart may be looked on as being
the first one to give a reliable and good outline of the Australian
coast as then known&mdash;namely, from Endeavour Strait, in the
extreme north, to the eastern limit of Pieter Nuvt's Land, on the
south. The two placer, where "Ffresh" water is marked would be the
Batavia River, near Cape York, and the present Macarthur River, at
the head of the Gulf, the well defined headlands shown there having
been resolved by Captain Flinders into a group of islands, now
known as the Sir Edward Pellew Group. Tasman's ships were the
<i>Limmen</i>, the <i>Zeemeuw</i>, and the tender <i>De
Brak</i>.</p>

<p>The first Englishman to land on New Holland was William Dampier
in 1688. In very bad company, namely, a crew of buccaneers who left
Captain Sharpe and travelled across the Isthmus of Darien, he
visited the west coast of New Holland, where they remained over a
month refitting and cleaning their ship. Dampier does not seem to
have been on the best of terms with his shipmates, for some
difference of opinion arising as to the final destination of their
voyage, he "was threatened to be turned ashore on New Holland for
it, which made me desist, intending, by God's blessing, to make my
escape the first place I came near." His notes on this occasion
refer chiefly to the natives seen, whose personal appearance and
habits he considers alike equally disgusting and repulsive.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1696, William de Vlaming, in search
of the <i>Ridderschap</i>, a missing ship supposed to have been
wrecked on the coast of New Holland, came to the Great South Land.
He found and named the Swan River, this being the first mention
ever made of black swans, two specimens of which were captured and
taken to Batavia. At Dirk Hartog's Road, he found, as
before-mentioned, the tin plate left by that captain, and after a
careful examination of the coast so far as the North-west Cape,
left for Batavia.</p>

<p>Dampier now reappears on the scene in charge of the
<i>Roebuck</i>&mdash;a ship sent out by the English Government in
1699. His account of his voyage is very minute and circumstantial,
but he still retains his aversion to the unfortunate natives, of
whom he always speaks with the greatest scorn. Some of his
statements are slightly doubtful, to say the least of it, as, for
instance, one concerning the capture of a large shark, "in which we
found the head and bones of a hippopotamus, [Note, below] the hairy
lips of which were still sound and not putrified, and the jaw was
also firm, out of which we pluckt a great many teeth, two of them
eight inches long and as big as a man's thumb, small at one end and
a little crooked, the rest not above half so long."</p>

<p>[Note: M. Malte Brun calls him "the learned and faithful
Dampier," and, in corroboration of the hippopotamus story, mentions
that Bailly, when exploring the Swan River, "heard a bellowing much
louder than that of an ox from among the reeds on the river side,
which made him suspect that a large quadruped lay somewhere near
him." It is remarkable that in the several accounts of the early
Dutch visits to the northern coast no mention is made of
alligators, although they are so common to all the inlets and
rivers of that region, the name <i>Crocodils Eylanden</i> on one
old chart being the sole exception.]</p>

<p>Dampier disputes the accuracy of the "draught of Tasman's" that
he had with him in many particulars, and constantly advances his
theory of the existence of a strait dividing New Holland into two
parts, probably taking this idea, as before indicated, from the old
map of the <i>Dauphin</i>.</p>

<p>In 1705, the ships <i>Vossenbach, Wayer</i>, and <i>Nova
Hollandia</i> were sent out to investigate the north coast, under
the command of Martin van Delft. The journals of the voyage have
not been found, although a report of the notable events that
happened was laid before the Governor-General of the East India
Council. This was the last voyage of exploration undertaken by the
Dutch, and closes the history of the early discovery of New
Holland. The existence of the Southern Land was definitely
established, and it remained for the English and French nations to
determine its size and formation with accuracy, and fill up the
gaps on the coast line.</p>

<p>Sixty-five years passed before Captain Cook sailed through the
Endeavour Strait, finally settling the question of the separation
of this continent from New Guinea, and during that period New
Holland, so far as we know, was unvisited.</p>

<p>The association of Captain Cook with this continent is too
well-known to need more than a passing reference in this
introduction. He proved the insularity of the South Land, and
examined the long-neglected east coast.</p>

<p>In. 1777, Mons. de St. Alouarn anchored near Cape Leeuwin, but
no details of his visit have been preserved.</p>

<p>In 1791, Captain George Vancouver touched on the south coast,
and gave the name of King George's Sound to that well-known
harbour; thence he sailed eastward. In the following year
Rear-Admiral Bruny D'Entrecasteaux, in search of the hapless La
Perouse, who so narrowly missed appropriating New Holland for the
French, made an elaborate survey of part of our south coast.</p>

<p>Before the close of the century, Bass and Flinders&mdash;fit
companions&mdash;had commenced their daring exploits in the little
<i>Tom Thumb</i>, and finally, with the sloop <i>Norfolk</i>,
established the existence of the strait named after the
enterprising young surgeon.</p>

<p>In the year 1799, Flinders went north in the <i>Norfolk</i>
sloop, and followed up Cook's discoveries in Moreton Bay. In 18oi
he was appointed to the <i>Investigator</i> (formerly the
<i>Xenophon</i>), and sailed from Spithead on the voyage which was
to render him one of the leading figures in Australian history.</p>

<p>Reaching Cape Leeuwin he commenced his survey of the south
coast, discovering and naming the two Gulfs of Spencer and St.
Vincent. The former he at one time thought would lead him through
the continent into the Carpentarian Gulf. He reached Port Jackson
in May, the year after he left England, and active preparations
were soon afterwards commenced to prepare the ship for her long
northern cruise.</p>

<p>In July, 1802, the <i>Investigator</i>, with the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> as tender, left Sydney Cove; the object of the voyage
being to thoroughly survey the eastern and northern coasts.
Flinders rounded Cape York, and after a close examination of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, which, like Spencer's Gulf in the south,
deluded him for a time with the false hope of affording an inlet
into the interior, brought his work to an end at Cape Wessel, in
consequence of the rotten state of his ship. He called at Coepang
in Timor, whence, after obtaining some supplies, he made for Port
Jackson by way of the west coast.</p>

<p>Throughout this cruise it is evident that Flinders was much
impressed by the notion advanced by Dampier, that New Holland
(meaning the north-west portion) was separated from the land to the
south by a strait opening north of Shark's Bay. "Unless," says
Dampier, "the high tides and indraught thereabout should be
occasioned by the mouth of some large river, which hath often low
lands on each side of the outlet, and many islands and shoals lying
at its entrance; but I rather thought it a channel or strait than a
river." To quote the words of Flinders:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"This opinion he supports by a fair induction from
facts, and the opening of twelve miles wide, seen by Vlaming's two
vessels, near the same place, and in which they could find no
anchorage, strongly corroborated Dampier's
supposition."</blockquote>

<p>Later information had demonstrated that the supposed strait
could not lead into the great ocean eastward, as the English
navigator (Dampier) had conjectured, but it was thought possible
that it might communicate with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and even
probable that a passage existed from thence to the unknown parts of
the south coast beyond the Isles of St. Francis and St. Peters.</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of penetrating the interior of <i>Terra
Australis</i>, either by a great river, or a strait leading to an
inland sea, a superior country, and perhaps, a different race of
people might be found, the knowledge of which could not fail to be
very interesting, and might prove advantageous to the nation making
the discovery."</blockquote>

<p>This was the goal of Flinders' ambition, the vision that haunted
him always&mdash;the discovery of a mediterranean sea.</p>

<p>There being no ship in Port Jackson fit to continue the survey
work left uncompleted by the <i>Investigator</i>, Flinders
determined to return to England, and obtain a suitable vessel from
the Admiralty. He and twenty-two of his men and officers embarked
as passengers in the <i>Porpoise</i>, and left Port Jackson in
company with the Batavian-bound ships <i>Cato</i> and
<i>Bridgewater</i>.</p>

<p>They sailed on the 10th of August, 1803, and on the night of the
17th, the <i>Porpoise</i> and <i>Cato</i> struck on a reef, and
became complete wrecks. The crews escaped to a sand-bank adjoining
the reef, and here they were left to their fate by the third ship,
the <i>Bridgewater</i>, the captain of which vessel sailed away to
Batavia, without any attempt being made to save them.</p>

<p>Discipline and order were, however, maintained on Wreck Reef
Bank, as it was called, and Flinders, who took command after the
vessel struck, proceeded to Sydney in the cutter, to obtain
assistance for the remainder of the crews, who were to employ the
time in constructing two decked boats from the timbers of the
<i>Porpoise</i>. This perilous voyage in an open boat, Flinders
accomplished safely, and returned in six weeks, with two colonial
schooners, the <i>Cumberland</i> and the <i>Francis</i>, and the
ship <i>Rolla</i>, bound for Canton. The shipwrecked men were taken
off the bank, and Flinders started for England in the
<i>Cumberland</i>, a small schooner of but twenty-nine tons. On his
way homeward he was forced to put into the Mauritius, to refit his
little craft, before venturing round the Cape of Good Hope; and on
the pretext that the passport he carried did not afford safe
conduct to the <i>Cumberland</i>, having been made out for the
<i>Investigator</i>, he was detained a prisoner in the Isle of
France for over six years.</p>

<p>The conduct of General de Caen in this matter has been severely
commented on, as it was entirely due to his personal pique and
jealousy in the affair that this indignity was put upon Flinders.
The generous hospitality extended by the British settlement to the
French navigators at Port Jackson found no response in this rough
specimen of a soldier of the revolution, who throughout the period
of Flinders' detention, treated him with studied rudeness and
unnecessary harshness.</p>

<p>For three months Flinders was kept close prisoner as a spy, and
for twenty months as an ordinary prisoner of war. Still during his
captivity in the Isle of France, his thoughts were constantly
busied with projects for the further exploration of the great
southern continent he had lately left. In addition to the chafing
weariness of prolonged detention and enforced inactivity, he was
constantly haunted by the dread that the French would, after
examination of his papers, step in and forestall him in the matter.
In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated March 20th, 1806, [See
fac-simile of original letter (not included in this eBook)] he
mentions this fear, and adding, that disappointment and deferred
hope of release have in no way damped his ardour in the cause of
science, advances for consideration a scheme for exploring the
interior of Australia. Though now, after more than eighty years of
discovery have given us an intimate knowledge of the nature of the
difficulties he would have encountered, we may smile at the
somewhat crude notions of the daring navigator, we cannot refuse to
recognise that a good deal of thoroughness was mixed up with his
plan, simple as it reads. An incursion of five hundred miles north
and south, respectively, would without doubt, if possible, have
done much towards an earlier knowledge of the interior.</p>

<p>His dream of sailing up a deep estuary&mdash;some great water
way&mdash;leading to more fertile lands than those of the coast
inhabited by a superior race of natives, had vanished. As the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria rounded his course from south to
west, and from west to north, so the picture his fancy had painted
faded; and he found himself compelled to fall back upon the
conception of a mode of transit patriarchal in its simplicity.</p>

<p>He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"With five or six asses to carry provisions (and they
can be obtained here), expeditions might be made into the interior
of Australia from the head of the Gulph of Carpentaria in 18 deg.,
and from the head of the great gulph on the south coast in 32 deg.,
until the courses should nearly meet, five hundred miles each way
would most probably be sufficient, since the country does not
appear to be mountainous: a view of my general chart will exemplify
this. In case of being again sent to Australia, I should much wish
that this was a part of my instructions."</blockquote>

<p>[Note: Referring to Flinders' scheme for exploring Australia, it
may be amusing to the reader to contrast it with one projected some
years later by M. Malte Brun. In his case, the amount of material
the eminent geographer considered necessary for the expedition is
as excessive as that of Captain Flinders' was simple. His method
for exploring the continent is this: "In order to determine these
questions" (namely the different theories propounded as to the
nature of the interior) "it has been proposed to send an expedition
to penetrate the country from Spencer's Gulf. For such an
expedition, men of science and courage ought to be selected. They
ought to be provided with all sorts of implements and stores, and
with different animals, from the powers and instincts of which they
may derive assistance. They should have oxen from Buenos Ayres, or
from the English settlements, mules from Senegal, and dromedaries
from Africa or Arabia. The oxen would traverse the woods and the
thickets; the mules would walk securely among rugged rocks and
hilly countries; the dromedaries would cross the sandy deserts.
Thus the expedition would be prepared for any kind of territory
that the interior might present. Dogs also should be taken to raise
game, and to discover springs of water; and it has even been
proposed to take pigs, for the sake of finding out esculent roots
in the soil. When no kangaroos and game are to be found the party
would subsist on the flesh of their own flocks. They should be
provided with a balloon for spying at a distance any serious
obstacle to their progress in particular directions, and for
extending the range of observations which the eye would take of
such level lands as are too wide to allow any heights beyond them
to come within the compass of their view. The journey might be
allowed a year or eighteen months, which would be only at the rate
of four or five miles per day...The author of the present work"
("Universal Geography") "has discoursed this project in
conversation with the enlightened and indefatigable traveller, M.
Péron, who saw no insuperable obstacle to its probability, except
the existence of an immense ocean of sand occupying the whole of
the interior of the continent, which to him appeared extremely
probable."]</p>

<p>But Flinders was never fated to see the interior of Terra
Australis, either from the deck of a ship, or from any point of
vantage; he surveyed its shores, suggested the name it now
bears&mdash;Australia, and left the work of discovery, not even to
this day quite completed, to other hands. But though the name of
Flinders has not received the world-wide recognition that has been
bestowed upon that of Cook, in Australia it should be equally
honoured. The land that witnessed his long labours and heroic
courage ought not to repay him with forgetfulness.</p>

<p>The crazy state of the <i>Investigator</i> having compelled
Flinders to terminate his voyage abruptly, a considerable space of
coast line was still left on the north, and north-west, that had
not been minutely examined. Lieutenant Phillip King, between the
years 1818 and 1822, completed the survey left unfinished by
Flinders, and the work of marine exploration temporarily
ceased.</p>

<p>In looking back over the early history of Australia, the
apparently careless manner in which the English became possessed of
the whole of the continent is very noticeable. Although the Dutch
had so long been acquainted with our shores, and the neighbourhood
of their possessions in Java would have afforded them greater
facilities for exploration than were held by any other nation, no
attempt at colonisation was ever made by them. The apparent
poverty, both of the country and the natives, offered the East
India Company no inducement to extend their operations. Still, in a
vague kind of way, the Dutch claim to the western portion of
Australia was recognized. In the patent to the first governor at
Port Jackson, the western limit of New South Wales is fixed at 13.5
deg. E. longitude, a position approximating to the boundary of New
Holland as fixed by the Dutch, whereby the country was divided into
New Holland and Terra Australis. This line of demarcation would
bisect the present colony of South Australia. In the early part of
this century, the French evidently considered that they had a
well-founded claim, both to the discovery and possession of the
south coast, west of Nuyts' "Island of St. Peters." The name of
"Terre Napoleon" was given to it, Spencer's Gulf becoming "Golfe
Bonaparte," and the Gulf of St. Vincent "Golfe Josephine." Malte
Brun remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The claims of the English have no fixed boundaries;
they seem desirous of confounding the whole of New Holland under
the modern name which they have given to the east coast, which was
minutely explored by Captain Cook. It is worthy of remark that the
French geographers had, from a comparison of the tracks navigated
by Abel Tasman, previously concluded on the existence and direction
of this coast itself."</blockquote>

<p>But neither Dutch nor French claims were ever seriously
advanced, and the whole of the continent and adjacent islands were
ceded to the English in much the same happy-go-lucky fashion that
we recently let slip a large portion of New Guinea. One cause of
the apathy displayed was without doubt the forbidding nature of the
reports published by all the navigators. The coast line had been
examined, and the various inlets followed up without any important
or navigable river having been brought to light, and the absence of
fresh water streams in such a large continent naturally led
thinking men to the conclusion that the inland slope was nothing
but an arid desert, parched beneath a rainless sky. The hot winds
that had been experienced on the southern coast aided this belief,
and the natives when interviewed professed no knowledge beyond the
limits of their tribal hunting grounds. The little colony clustered
around Rose Hill, and on the shore of Sydney Cove, was shut in by
the gloomy gorges and unscaleable precipices of the Caermarthen
Hills, that stayed all progress to the westward, and the same
frowning barrier had been found to extend north and south.</p>

<p>Men's imaginations were exhausted in picturing the physical
appearance of the mysterious interior. Some thought it a vast level
plain, where the few and sluggish rivers were lost in shallow
lakes, to disappear by evaporation; others again, believed it to be
an immense bed of sand where no rivers formed, and the thirsty
sands absorbed the scanty rainfall; and many imagined an inland sea
connected with the ocean by subterranean outlets: one and all
agreed in its inhospitable nature.</p>

<p>There was nothing hopeful nor inspiriting in the outlook to
induce men to attempt to penetrate this silent desert, save the
love of adventure, and the gratification of a laudable
curiosity.</p>

<p>The convicts, who in efforts to regain their liberty, from time
to time made desperate attempts to escape, either perished
miserably or, daunted by the sterile nature of the land and the
hostility of the natives, returned to give themselves up, before
reaching any distance from the settlement. The work of exploration
was toilsome and difficult, from the lack of beasts of burden. Each
member of the party had a heavy pack to carry, and when to that was
added the cumbrous firearms and ammunition of those times, a day's
journey was no light labour. The weary system of counting the paces
all day must have considerably added to the monotony of the march.
Two thousand and two hundred paces over good ground were allowed to
a mile. When too, nature had barred the way with an apparently
insurmountable range, it is not to be wondered at that the area of
explored country was not very widely extended during the first
twenty years of settlement.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to other portions of the world's surface
that have been slowly explored and examined by the European
nations, Australia has throughout retained a character of its own.
From the coastal formation of most lands, fair indications could be
obtained of the character of the interior. Large rivers gave
evidence of a defined system of drainage, the crests of snow-topped
mountain ranges in the distance were proof of whence these rivers
sprang. The native tribes were of higher intelligence, had a
partial knowledge of what lay beyond their immediate ken, and could
show articles of barter and commerce that they had obtained from
more inland residents.</p>

<p>Australia was a silent and sullen blank, and for a century of
exploration nature has resisted, step by step, the encroachments on
her stronghold, making the invaders pay toll with many a gallant
life.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was comparatively at a late period in the world's history
when Australia was opened up as a field for geographical research;
but, notwithstanding that the accumulated knowledge of centuries
was thus brought to bear upon it, the characteristic and unique
formation of the country set at naught all the approved deductions
and theories of the scientific world. A paradox, or, as a clever
writer recently put it, "a surviving fragment of the primitive
world," with a nature contradictory and inconsistent, as compared
even with itself, cut off from the rest of the globe, and left to
work out the problem of its existence alone; no wonder it was only
after successive generations had toiled at it, that Australia was,
even in part, understood.</p>

<p>The interior of Australia is, as is well-known, an immense
plain, having an average height of fifteen hundred to two thousand
feet, with a decided tilt, or slope, towards the south-west. Round
the foot of this tableland, is a terrace of lower country, varying
greatly in width. The river systems of the coastal lands, lying
between the sea and the foot of the tableland, were easily
understood and traced, that of the interior was far more
difficult.</p>

<p>Starting from Cape York, in the extreme north, and following
down the eastern coast, the edge of the tableland is formed of
ranges, often of considerable height, the gullies and spurs of
which are mostly clothed with scrub and jungle of tropical growth
and luxuriance; amongst the peaks of this range there are Distant
Peak, 3,573 feet; Pieter Botte Mountain, 3,311 feet; Grey Peak,
3,357 feet; and the Bellender Kerr Hills, 5,433 feet high. Further
south, the level is more uniform; the isolated peak of Mount
Elliott&mdash;which attains a height Of 4,075 feet&mdash;forming
the exception, until further south again the elevations approach to
4,250 feet. An average height of a little over two thousand feet is
then maintained until the border line of Queensland is reached, and
here&mdash;in Mount Lindesay&mdash;5,500 feet is met with. The New
England Range maintains this altitude in many peaks, including
Mount Seaview&mdash;from which point Oxley sighted the ocean-6,000
feet high. Still to the south, the mountains on the border of the
plateau keep up an average of between three and four thousand feet
until, at the south-east extremity of our continent, the greatest
height is attained in Mount Kosciusko, falling some 700 feet short
of the limit of perpetual snow, its elevation being 7,308 feet.</p>

<p>To the westward, many of the peaks reach altitudes of over 5,000
and 6,000 feet, until the large depression is encountered through
which the great body of interior waters find their way to the sea
by means of the Murray Channel.</p>

<p>West of this gap, the edge of the tableland is broken, and
depressed, the highest crests of the coastal range rarely reaching
to 3,000 feet in height. and along the shore line, facing the Great
Australian Bight, it is almost non-existent.</p>

<p>On reaching the south-west corner of Australia, the elevated
edge reforms in the Russell and Darling Ranges, and trending
northward, skirting the coast, culminates in Mount Bruce, 4,000
feet above sea level. From hence, the range following the sea line
is broken, rugged and precipitous, but of inconsiderable height,
and when the centre of the Gulf of Carpentaria is reached, it falls
away into highlands and slopes, joining the eastern ranges.</p>

<p>On the great plateau encircled by this range, no elevations of
any moment are to be found; a kind of chain traverses the centre
from north to south, but though in places presenting a bold
formation, the highest altitude attained is in the Macdonnell
Ranges&mdash;4,000 feet.</p>

<p>From the coastal range, the edge of the tableland, flow the
rivers that run direct to the sea on the seaward face; but in many
instances a false tableland occurs, the streams that drain which
unite in forcing their way through deep gorges to the lowlands of
the coast. This false tableland is conspicuous in the valley of the
Upper Burdekin River on the east coast, and on the head waters of
the Fitzroy, The country drained by the top tributaries of these
rivers being only divided from the real tableland by a gentle
ascent, whereas the descent to the coast is steep and abrupt. Most
of the northern rivers, too, take their rise in a plateau that is
almost on a level with the great plain, but cut their way down to
the sea through gorges, instead of being lost in the interior.</p>

<p>It follows then, that the drainage and character of the terrace
surrounding the continent, keeping to natural and known laws was at
once understood, but the drainage of the plateau was more difficult
to comprehend, and it is now known to be confined to two river
systems only, first, that of the Darling and Murray, which rivers
receive all the waters flowing to the westward of the eastern coast
range, and secondly, the lake system further to the westward; the
great salt lakes to the north of Spencer's Gulf receiving Cooper's
Creek and its many tributaries, and also the Diamantina and
Herbert; their waters being dissipated by soakage and evaporation.
Westward, again, there is little doubt that no system exists, the
level nature of the country and intermittent rainfall shortening
the existence of the creeks before they have time to unite their
flood waters in one large permanent channel.</p>

<p>The rivers of the eastern coast are the Kennedy, the Endeavour,
the Barron, the Burdekin with its many tributaries, the Clark, the
Perry, the Star, the Keelbottom, the Fanning, the Suttor (which
last brings down the united waters of the Cape and Belyando), and
finally after passing through the Leichhardt Range the Bowen, and
the Bogie. The Fitzroy, another river of many tributaries, the
Mackenzie, the Isaacs, the Nogoa, and the Dawson. Then come the
Boyne, the Kolan, the Burnett (which receives another Boyne), the
Mary, the Brisbane, all in the Colony of Queensland. On this coast
in New South Wales, come next the Tweed, the Richmond, and the
Clarence; the Macleay, the Hastings, and the Hunter. The Hawkesbury
the Shoalhaven and the Clyde. The Snowy River, though rising in New
South Wales, discharges itself into the sea in Victorian waters;
thence we come to the Latrobe and the many minor streams that flow
into the ocean instead of into the great receiver the Murray. The
Glenelg and the Wannon. Then comes the Murray, the outlet of the
inland waters. Westward, the rivers of the coast become smaller and
less frequent, until at last they cease to exist; but on the
western shore&mdash;where the coast range once more reasserts
itself&mdash;we find in Western Australia, the Swan, the Irwin, the
Greenough, the Murchison, and the Gascoyne, the Ashburton, the
Fortescue, the De Grey, and another Fitzroy. On the north coast, we
meet with the Victoria, the Daly, the Adelaide, the Alligator, the
Liverpool, the Roper, the Limmen Bight, the Macarthur, the Robinson
and the Calvert, the Albert&mdash;which is the outlet for the
Nicholson and the Gregory&mdash;the Leichhardt and the Flinders,
the Norman, the Gilbert, the Einesleigh, the Mitchell, the Archer,
the Jardine, and the Batavia, which brings us back to our starting
point at Cape York.</p>

<p>Now come the inland arteries, the streams running through the
tableland and feeding the Darling and the Murray. These are the
Murrumbidgee, which equals the Murray almost in importance, the
Lachlan and the Darling, which brings down the waters of a hundred
streams, the Macquarie, the Castlereagh, and the Bogan, the Namoi
and Gwydir, the Dumaresque, the Condamine, the Maranoa, the Moonie,
and the Warrego. And falling into the Murray itself, from the south
are, the Ovens, the Goulburn, the Mitta Mitta, the Campaspe and the
Loddon.</p>

<p>The other rivers of' the inland slope are the Barcoo and
Thomson, forming Cooper's Creek, the Diamentina, the Burke and the
Hamilton, the Herbert or Georgina, and Eyre Creek, all these end in
the flats and shallows of the Great Salt Lake District.</p>

<p>The remaining watercourses to the westward cannot be classed in
any way, their course is apparently determined by local
inequalities of the surface, and although some are very
considerable in appearance, their flow is so brief that it is
impossible to consider them as at all forming parts of one system;
the longest and most important is Sturt's Creek.</p>

<p>The coast country, meaning the land watered by the rivers first
enumerated, has the advantage over the tableland in the matter of
rainfall, and the rivers therefore possess more of the
characteristics of running streams, than the chains of isolated
ponds that are known as rivers in the inland slope. The climatic
influence is especially noticeable in the indigenous grasses and
herbage of the two regions. Mr. George Ranken, in one of his essays
on Australian subjects ["The Squatting System of Australia," by
"Capricornus."] draws an excellent picture of the reclamation and
transformation of the forest primeval.</p>

<blockquote>"The first comers in 1788, found before them, as their
ships came to anchor, sandstone bluffs covered with scraggy trees
and heath-like plants, with a bright blue sky above, and an
elastic, buoyant atmosphere around. As they went inland, they found
an endless open forest, the ground being clothed with a light,
tufty grass, but it was the starved outline of European woodland
scenery, for the trees rose bare and branchless from a thirsty
soil, and the grass covered only half, the surface of the earth.
Except the grass, and that was thin enough, though it grew
everywhere, the country seemed poor in products, and looked as if
it were involved in a constant struggle between droughts and
floods. They would have judged it to be poor in capability also,
if, on further experience, a vitality had not appeared which seemed
to electrify the soil on the touch of colonisation. Imported
animals, trees, and plants lived and flourished among the dingy
forests, which barely yielded food enough for a few wandering
savages.<br>
<br>
"The farther they went, the greater contrast appeared, more drought
and better country; and in later times, as the last of enigmas, a
change of vegetation and climate seemed to follow the settler with
his flocks and herds. After a few years' feeding with stock, water
has been found permanently standing in country where it never stood
before, and sometimes the tufty herbage has changed into a sward.
The flats that used in one season to show a succession of swamps,
and in another a surface of bare dusty soil, rifted with yawning
cracks, has often become good level turf, intersected with runnels
cut by the hoofs of the sheep and cattle."</blockquote>

<p>The first invasion of the new territory across the range led to
a terrible feeling of disappointment; true, that on at once
crossing the crest of the watershed country was found, which being
partly within the influence of the heavier fall of rain, approached
in every way the perfection dreamt of by the explorers; but as
progress inland was made, a change was found to take place, and,
above all, the familiar indigenous grasses were lost, and replaced
by what the settlers took to be nothing but worthless weeds. All
the now prized edible shrubs, such as the many kinds of saltbush,
the cotton-bush, &amp;c., were amongst these despised plants; and
even the very stock did not take to them, until some years of use
had rendered them familiar. These drought-resisting plants were at
first supposed to be confined to the inner slope of the range, but
the extended exploration of the continent shows us that where the
coast range loses its character of a pronounced range, and is only
represented by an insignificant rise, the characteristics of the
plain are continued right down to within a short distance of the
sea.</p>

<p>This is notably the case on the north, where the Flinders River
and its tributaries drain country that bears all the distinctive
growth of the interior. On the south coast, west of the Murray,
this is also the case, and in these parts, through the depression
of the range, the climate is much drier. On the eastern coast,
however, the distinction between the uplands and lowlands is
strongly marked both in Queensland and New South Wales, even in
those cases where the rivers rise in uplands approaching in
elevation to the level of the tableland. The eastern coast of
northern Queensland is, from its situation and the superior height
of the coast range combined, the tropical garden of Australia, the
luxuriant growth of vegetation, taking the form of dense scrubs and
jungles springing from a deep, rich soil. These scrubs, of slightly
varying character, form a characteristic of the whole length of the
eastern seaboard, and amongst them we find much valuable timber.
The cedar tree is one important feature, and the kauri pine is
found in one small tract in the north of Queensland.</p>

<p>Further south, however, the trees grow to an enormous height in
the elevated forest lands. Victoria and Western Australia are
particularly noted for the giant growth of some of their trees. In
Victoria the white gum (<i>eucalyptus amygdalina</i>) has been
found growing to a height of over four hundred feet; the red gum
(<i>eucalyptus rostrata</i>), and the blue gum (<i>eucalyptus
globulus</i>) also attain a great size in our southern colonies. In
Western Australia the jarrah (<i>eucalyptus marginata</i>) and the
karri (<i>eucalyptus diversicolor</i>) have become noted in the
world as being most valuable hardwoods.</p>

<p>Right through the continent, from east to west, the box tree
(<i>eucalyptus malliodora</i>) is to be found. On the tableland the
timber is altogether of a different growth. The giants of the
slopes of the seaward range are replaced by low, stunted, and
crooked trees, some of them, however, possessing edible foliage.
Most of the acacias are of this kind&mdash;the <i>acacia
pendula</i> or myall, the brigalow, the mulga, and yarran. The
<i>caesariansae</i> common all over Australia, under the name of
the oak tree.</p>

<p>The difference between the products of the interior upland and
the coastal lowland is mainly induced by the difference of climate,
those grasses and herbs growing on the tableland, while repellent
in appearance and colour, compared to the richer herbage of the
coast, possess qualities that render them invaluable as fodder
plants. Once let the grasses of the coast lose their moisture from
drought, and they become sapless and worthless, but it is not so in
the tableland. Months of dry weather have no effect upon the
fattening properties of the shrubs; the stock, however, have to
become used to feeding on them before their full value is
attained.</p>

<p>Amongst the fauna of Australia the distinction between coast and
tableland is not so well marked, most of the well-known species
ranging indifferently over the whole continent. In the kangaroos,
differences in size, colour and appearance can easily be detected
in widely separated localities, but they do not amount to anything
very noticeable to the ordinary observer. The smaller kinds, the
wallaby and kangaroo rat, are common everywhere on the continent.
In birds, however, the difference is great, the seeds and fruit on
which some birds exist being only found in either the coastal
scrubs or lowland country, whilst many of the parrots and pigeons
of the interior could not live on the coast. So sharply is the line
drawn in some places, that on the dividing watersheds of the east
coast flocks of galar parrots and plain-pigeons will be found
feeding on the western slope of a ridge, but never by any chance
crossing on to the eastern.</p>

<p>Australia is rich in waders, and they are found all over the
continent. The beautiful jabiru, or gigantic crane, is equally at
home in some lonely waterhole in the far west and at the head of a
coast swamp; so, too, the <i>grus Australis</i>, or native
companion, and the quaint and rich-plumaged ibis. The familiar
laughing-jackass is to be found everywhere, but his peculiar note
differs somewhat in different parts; a blackfellow from the south
says that the laugh of the northern bird makes him feel sick,
whilst the northern native says the same of the southern
kingfisher. The great inland plains are the haunt of the
flock-pigeon; in countless myriads, these beautiful birds come at
some seasons of the year, and in the morning when flying in to the
water they look like distant clouds.</p>

<p>The fish of the tableland differ greatly from those of the
coast. In some of the inland lakes and permanent lagoons they are
so fat as to be almost uneatable, and at times so plentiful and
easily caught that the blackfellows scarcely trouble to get them,
which is rarely the case elsewhere. The Australian native is a man
with an unknown history whether he is an improvement on his remote
ancestors or a degenerate descendant it is impossible to form any
idea.</p>

<p>Whoever they were they left nothing behind them, except this
wandering savage, and he has neither traditions nor customs that
tell us anything of the past. The language is a perfect confusion
of tongues, and dialects, words of similar sound and meaning are
often found in places hundreds of miles apart; in distinct tribes
wherein the rest of the language is altogether different. Their
physique does not differ greatly. Perhaps in the north an admixture
of Malay blood gives a handsomer cast to the features in individual
cases, but the Australian native is unmistakable wherever you meet
him, north, south, east or west.</p>

<p>The geological formation of Australia is, as is well-known very
old, one third of the continent being desert sandstone with no
marine fossils, but although, scantily supplied with water on the
surface, there is little doubt of the immensity of the subterranean
supply.</p>

<p>Water has been struck by boring five hundred and seventy-two
feet, and risen to within ten feet of the surface, and on the
Kallara run at one hundred and forty-four, where it rose twenty-six
feet above the surface. Water then, will probably be found almost
anywhere at a depth of six hundred feet, and a vast portion of the
lightly watered plains of the interior will be worked up to their
fullest capabilities by means of boring.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the first portion of Australia
that rose above the sea was the south-east corner where the largest
and probably the most active of our volcanoes existed; the rise of
the whole continent which subsequently took place would have then
left the interior a shallow inland sea, girt round with a broken
chain of more or less active volcanoes. In time, these grew
extinct, the sea evaporated and we were left with our present coast
range, with its now lifeless peaks, and our depressed inland
plateau, with its saline flats and lakes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As may be well supposed, the men who arrived in Australia in
charge of the first party of convicts had more pressing work on
hand than devoting their time to scientific exploration. Separated
by half the world from the source of their supplies, in charge of a
body of criminals of the most dangerous type, Arthur Phillip and
his officers had no light task to perform, and every credit must be
given to the little band of pilgrims who, beset by danger from
within and without, brought the colony through its infancy without
any tragedy happening. Apparently, these early adventurers were no
whit behind travellers of the present day in bringing back
wonderful tales of their discoveries whenever they essayed a trip
into the unknown. One of the officers writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"We found the convicts particularly happy in fertility
of invention and exaggerated descriptions; hence, large fresh-water
rivers, valuable ores, and quarries of limestone, chalk, and marble
were daily proclaimed soon after we had landed. At first we
hearkened with avidity to such accounts, but perpetual
disappointments taught us to listen with caution, and to believe
from demonstration only."</blockquote>

<p>Amongst these gentry was a convict named Daly, afterwards banged
for burglary, who distinguished himself by instigating the first
gold prospecting party in Australia. Having broken up a pair of
brass buckles, he mixed the fragments with sand and stones, and
represented the result as specimens of ore he had found. A party
was sent out under his guidance to examine the locality, but,
needless to say, failed in the endeavour, the perpetrator of the
hoax confessing to it in the end, and suffering the punishment
common at that period.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Hawkesbury River, in the year following the
settlement, may be looked upon as the first effort emanating from
the colony to push exploration to any appreciable distance.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, 1789, Governor Phillip, accompanied by a
large party in two boats, proceeded to Broken Bay. After spending
some time without result, they pulled into an inlet, and suddenly
found themselves at the entrance of a fresh-water river, up which
they rowed twenty miles in a westerly direction, but provisions
failing, they turned back.</p>

<p>A second expedition was then undertaken, and this time the boats
penetrated between sixty and seventy miles, inclusive of the
windings of the river. Further progress was stayed by a fall. The
party examined the surrounding country, but opinions differed
greatly as to its value; some reporting rich and beautiful land,
others low-lying flats subject to floods. A hill close by the fall
was ascended, and christened Richmond Hill, and the river was named
the Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>On the 26th of the same month, Captain Tench, then in charge of
the newly-formed outpost of Rose Hill, started on an expedition to
the westward. He was accompanied by Mr. Arndell, assistant-surgeon
of the settlement, Mr. Lowes, surgeon's mate of the <i>Sirius</i>,
two marines, and a convict. His relation of his trip is
interesting, as being the earliest record of land exploration, and
also as containing the account of the discovery of the Nepean
River. An extract from his journal runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I left the redoubt at daybreak, pointing our march to
a hill distant five miles, in a westerly or inland direction, which
commands a view of the great chain of mountains called the
Caermarthen Hills, extending from north to south farther than the
eye can reach. Here we paused, surveying 'the wild abyss, pondering
over our voyage.' Before us lay the trackless, immeasurable desert
in awful silence. At length, after consultation, we determined to
steer west and by north by compass, the make of the land indicating
the existence of a river. We continued to march all day through a
country untrodden before by an European foot. Save that a
melancholy crow now and then flew croaking overhead, or a kangaroo
was seen to bound at a distance, the picture of solitude was
complete and undisturbed. At four o'clock in the afternoon we
halted near a small pond of water, where we took up our residence
for the night, lighted a fire, and prepared to cook our supper-that
was to broil over a couple of ramrods a few slices of salt pork,
and a crow which we had shot. At daylight we renewed our
peregrination, and in an hour after, we found ourselves on the
banks of a river nearly as broad as the Thames at Putney, and
apparently of great depth, the current running very slowly in a
northerly direction. Vast flocks of wild ducks were swimming in the
stream, but, after being once fired at, they grew so shy that we
could not get near them a second time. Nothing is more certain than
that the sound of a gun had never before been heard within many a
mile of this spot."</blockquote>

<p>A short description of the hunting practices of the natives here
follows, and the explorer then continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Having remained out three days, we returned to our
quarters at Rose Hill with the pleasing intelligence of our
discovery. The country we had passed through we found tolerably
plain, and little encumbered with underwood, except near the
riverside. It is entirely covered with the same sort of trees as
grow near Sydney; and in some places grass springs up luxuriantly;
other places are quite bare of it. The soil is various; in many
places a stiff, arid clay, covered with small pebbles; in other
places, of a soft, loamy nature; but invariably in every part near
the river it is a coarse, sterile sand. Our observations on it
(particularly mine, from carrying the compass with which we
steered) were not so numerous as might have been wished. But,
certainly, if the qualities of it be such as to deserve future
cultivation, no impediment of surface but that of cutting down and
burning the trees exists to prevent its being tilled.<br>
<br>
"To this river the Governor gave the name of Nepean (after Captain
Nepean, of the New South Wales corps). The distance of the part of
the river which was first hit upon from the sea coast is about
thirty-nine miles, in a direct line, almost due west."</blockquote>

<p>In December, 1789, Governor Phillip dispatched a party, under
Lieutenant Dawes, of the Marines, accompanied by Lieutenant Johnson
and Mr. Lowes, to cross the Nepean and try to penetrate the range
beyond. They discovered a ford in the river, and crossing,
proceeded in a westerly direction. So rugged and difficult,
however, did they find the country that in three days they had only
covered fifteen miles. At a bill that they called Mount Twiss they
turned back, having penetrated fifty-four miles in a direct line
from the sea coast.</p>

<p>In August, 1790, Messrs. Tench, Dawes, and Morgan explored south
and west of Rose Hill. They struck the Nepean higher up, nearer its
source than on the former occasion, and remained out seven days,
penetrating to a considerable distance in a south-west direction.
Near the end of the same month, the same party made an excursion to
the north-west of Rose Hill, and traced the Nepean to where it was
first discovered by Tench's party in 1789.</p>

<p>In April, 1791, Governor Phillip, attended by a large company,
numbering in all twenty-one persons, including two natives, set out
on an expedition from Rose Hill to determine the identity, or not,
of the Nepean and the Hawkesbury. On the 12th of the month they
struck the river, and followed it down for some distance, but did
not accomplish the object they had in view.</p>

<p>In the following month, however, Messrs. Tench, Dawes, and two
soldiers, again went out, and settled the vexed question.</p>

<p>About this time, although scarcely to be included in the tale of
exploration, a number of convicts made a desperate attempt to
proceed overland to China. They, however, only managed a very short
stage of the journey&mdash;namely, to Broken Bay. Here they were
attacked by the natives, and returned in a demoralised condition to
Rose Hill and gave themselves up.</p>

<p>The impression these deluded men set out under was, that at a
considerable distance to the northward there was a large river
which separated this country from China, and when it was crossed
they would find themselves amongst a copper-coloured people, who
would receive and treat them kindly.</p>

<p>In 1793, Captain Paterson, who had already had some experience
as an African traveller, started on an expedition to the
Caermarthen Hills (by this time beginning to be known as the Blue
Mountains), intending, if possible, to cross the range, or at any
rate, penetrate some distance into it, He was accompanied by
Captain Johnstone, and Messrs. Palmer and Lang. The party was well
equipped, and provisioned for six weeks. Pulling up the Hawkesbury,
they left the heavy boats at the fall that had formerly stayed the
progress of Governor Phillip, and taking two light ones with them,
they tried to ascend higher up the river. They managed to reach ten
miles beyond the furthest point ever before visited, and then,
their boats having suffered some damage, and there being a slight
fresh in the river, they returned. The highest part of the river
where they were they named the "Grose," and Paterson, who was a
botanist, discovered several new kinds of plants.</p>

<p>Another determined effort to cross the range that seemed to defy
all the attempts of the colonists was made by quarter-master
Hacking, in 1794. The party succeeded in pushing out twenty miles
further than any European had been, but their report was
unfavourable. They reached the foot of the range, and after
climbing over some eighteen or twenty ridges, formed of little else
but precipitous rocks, they saw before them nothing but the same
savage and inaccessible country. Tier after tier of ranges rose in
view, divided by abrupt and impassable chasms and gorges. The only
natives they saw fled at their approach, and, saving for the
presence of some large red kangaroos, little sign of animal life
was met with. Away to both north and south, the same iron range
could be traced, showing no prospect of gap or pass, and they
returned dispirited. The colonists now began to look upon the Blue
Mountains as their western limit, and the extension of settlement
in that direction was regarded as chimerical.</p>

<p>The cattle that had escaped from the settlement had, with their
usual instinct, wandered on until they had found suitable grazing
land on the Nepean, and there had settled down. When discovered
they had thriven well, and increased into a small herd. By the
Governor's direction they were left unmolested, being but
occasionally visited, and their run became known as the Cow
Pastures.</p>

<p>Mr. Bass, the bold explorer of Bass Strait, in company with some
other gentlemen, visited these pasture lands in 1797, and from
Mount Taurus, on the Nepean River, took a straight course to the
coast, where a whale boat was sent to meet them. Their .experience
was of the usual kind. After leaving the fertile grazing lands
appropriated by the cattle, they crossed a succession of barren
ridges, gradually growing worse and worse until the sea was
reached.</p>

<p>Bass had, before this, attempted to cross the range in 1796. His
attempt was of the same character as all the others, failure and
disappointment attending his steps, although the endeavour to
obtain success was carried through, as might be expected, with his
usual untiring energy and contempt for danger. It is sad to think
that a career that opened so brilliantly should have been doomed to
close miserably in the mines of South America.</p>

<p>Having become partially convinced that there was no high road to
be found between Port Jackson and the Chinese Empire, some of the
convicts (principally the Irish prisoners) became possessed with
the notion that a colony of white people existed three or four
hundred miles in the interior, south-west of the settlement. This
tale, highly embellished, was sufficient to inflame the
imaginations of men condemned to servitude, and panting for
liberty. The existing rumour being found out by the authorities, it
proved on investigation that so far had this preposterous legend
gained ground that written instructions had been issued for
guidance to this Arcadia, accompanied with a paper having the
figure of a compass drawn on it. The Governor, wishing to save
these foolish dupes from the punishment and probable loss of life
that would necessarily ensue in carrying out such a wild project,
wrote to a magistrate at Parramatta the following instructions. He
was to go to Toongabbie, where most of these infatuated men were
employed, and, knowing how impossible it would be to reason them
out of their belief, he was to inform them that four picked men
would be allowed to start out and satisfy themselves of the
impossibility of any show of success attending their search, and
that in order to ensure their safe return three experienced men
would be sent as guides with them.</p>

<p>On receipt of this information so many assembled that stricter
measures had to be taken, and sixteen of the number were arrested
and sent to Sydney for punishment. Four men were then selected by
the malcontents themselves, and were about to depart in search of
the supposed colony when a treacherous plot was discovered. A
scheme was on foot for a stronger party of convicts to abscond, and
these meeting the explorers at a pre-arranged spot, should there
murder the guides, and having possessed themselves of their
weapons, the prisoners would be at liberty to prosecute their
researches alone. Four soldiers were added to the party to resist
any attempt of this sort, and on the 14th January, 1798, they left
Parramatta in search of El Dorada.</p>

<p>Amongst the men chosen to act as guides was one James Wilson,
who had for some time previously been living in the bush with the
natives, and had even submitted to his body being marked and
scarred after their fashion. On his return from this nomadic
existence, he stated that he had traversed the country for nearly
one hundred miles in every direction around the settlement, and
discoursed at length upon having seen large tracts of open country,
and many strange birds and animals, unknown to the settlers. His
stories were for the most part discredited, but it was thought that
his experiences would be most useful to the party, and he was
therefore selected.</p>

<p>Ten days after the explorers left, the soldiers returned with
three of the delegates. On reaching the foot of the mountains,
where it was arranged that the soldiers were to leave the party and
return home, these three men were so thoroughly tired of their
quest, and convinced of their folly, that they had begged to be
allowed to go back.</p>

<p>On the 9th February the remainder of the expedition reached
Prospect Hill more dead than alive. Wilson alone had kept heart,
and managed to sustain the flagging spirits of his companions
sufficiently to enable them to stagger in to the settlement.</p>

<p>Their report of the surroundings of the colony contained little
more than what was already known or guessed at. They described the
country passed over as alternating between barren, rocky ridges and
spacious meadows. Running creeks had been crossed, and they turned
back on the bank of a river which they described as being as large
as the Hawkesbury, with level country in view on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>They had seen but few natives, and those they saw were clothed
in skins from head to foot. Amongst other novelties they had
noticed the blue-gum trees, the mountain wallaroo, which had drawn
their attention from being larger and fatter than those formerly
familiar to them, a kind of pheasant, as they described it, now
known as the lyre-bird, a specimen of which the brought back with
them, and a kind of mole, the modern wombat, one of which formed
their last meal before reaching the settlement. These accounts
corroborated the former reports made by Wilson. This expedition
was, however, of not much service from a geographical point of
view, from the unreliability of the course kept.</p>

<p>The party also reported coming across a hill of salt, and in the
month of March, Henry Hacking was sent out to inspect it. He was
accompanied by Wilson and another man, who were supplied with
provisions and directed to penetrate as far into the country as
their supplies would permit. Hacking found that several veins of
salt existed, and the two men stated that they had succeeded in
getting 140 miles S.W. by W. from Prospect Hill. During their
journey they had travelled over many varieties of country, crossing
a number of narrow creeks and rivers with which the land was
intersected. They passed through much promising country and much
that was unpromising. From the summits of some of the higher hills
that they ascended, they had extensive views to the westward, and
as usual, saw mountain rising upon mountain in that direction. They
brought back another specimen of the lyre-bird.</p>

<p>In the year '97 preceding this trip, some convicts had boarded
and seized a colonial-built boat, called the <i>Cumberland</i>,
during her passage to the Hawkesbury. The crew were landed at Pitt
Water, and making their way from there overland gave information of
the piracy. Two boats under Lieutenant Shortland started in
pursuit. One returned in a few days, but Shortland with the other
went as far north as Port Stephens without, however, seeing
anything of the pirates. His voyage was not by any means destitute
of result, as on his return he found a river; "into which he
carried three fathoms of water in the shoalest part of its
entrance, finding deep water and good anchorage within. The
entrance of this river was but narrow, and covered by a high rocky
island, lying right off, so as to leave a good passage round the
north end of the island between that and the shore. A reef connects
the south part of the island with the south shore of the entrance
of the river. In this harbour was found a very considerable
quantity of coal of a very good sort, and lying so near the water's
side as to be conveniently shipped; which gave it, in this
particular, manifest advantage over that discovered to the
southward. Some specimens of this coal were brought up in the
boat." In the foregoing description, the Hunter River and the
present harbour of Newcastle will be easily recognised.</p>

<p>In July, of the year '99, Flinders was instructed by the
Governor to examine the two large openings marked by Cook on the
east coast, namely, Glass House Bay and Hervey Bay. Glass House
Bay&mdash;now Moreton Bay&mdash;was so called after some remarkable
peaks that were visible on the north side. These peaks Captain
Flinders made an excursion to examine, and from the summit of one
obtained an extended view over the surrounding country, nothing
novel, however, being seen. At Hervey's Bay, too, the only
additional information gained, was of a nautical character, the
natives seeming to be the most interesting objects met with.</p>

<p>Wilson, whose career amongst the natives, and as an explorer is
most notable, now met his death in a sufficiently tragic, if
appropriate, manner. This man had served the term of his
transportation, and both as a convict and a free man had passed a
great part of his time wandering through the bush with the
aboriginals. He had been suspected, justly or unjustly, of
prompting the blacks to attack the settlers; aiding them with his
knowledge of the habits of the whites, and the best season for
carrying out their designs. At any rate, his long intercourse with
the natives had rendered him careless of consequences, and a
flagrant violation of their customs led to his being speared.</p>

<p>During the governorship of Captain King, Ensign Barraillier came
to the front as an explorer. He was notably an accurate and
painstaking surveyor, and although his expeditions were
circumscribed by the ever present barrier of the Blue Mountains, he
was evidently an indefatigable worker in the cause of science. From
a letter of Governor King's, addressed to Sir Joseph Banks in May,
1803, we learn something of Barraillier, and also of the petty
private squabbles that prevailed amongst the colonists, even in the
highest quarters. Governor King writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"As our maritime surveying is now turned over to
Captain Flinders, who has the <i>Lady Nelson</i> with him, by the
Admiralty's direction, I had begun making discoveries in the
interior by means of Ensign Barraillier. He has been one journey,
and went twenty miles from the first range of hills, till his
further course was interrupted by a river running north, which is a
curious circumstance, being in the mountains. He described it as
wide as the Thames at Kingston. Some native iron he found, and also
an imperfect limestone, and the dung of an unknown animal. Samples
of everything he there found will be sent by the <i>Greenwich</i>
(whaler), and I did hope to have been able to add something farther
from another journey he was about undertaking, and for which
purpose I had established a chain of dep&ocirc;ts of provisions, to
further his return.<br>
<br>
"Cayley is just gone on an excursion, and you will see by his
letters he is undertaking a still longer one. As he keeps all his
knowledge to himself, I am hopeful you are benefited by it, and I
hope much good will result from his journeys, which he is now
determined on persevering in. I informed you of the refusal he gave
me and Mr. Brown to his going in the
<i>Investigator</i>."</blockquote>

<p>George Cayley was a botanist sent out by Sir Joseph Banks to
collect for Kew Gardens. He was industrious and painstaking in his
vocation, but sadly overburdened with vanity. He made one important
journey to the Blue Mountains, with the usual result. He erected a
cairn of stones at the furthest point he reached, which Governor
Macquarie afterwards christened "Cayley's Repulse."</p>

<p>To return to Barraillier. Governor King, in the same, letter,
further writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I have informed you in my several letters of the great
use Ensign Barraillier, of the New South Wales Corps, was to me and
the public. First, in going to the southward, and surveying the
coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port, next, in surveying.
Hunter's River, where he went twice, and since then in making
useful observations about the settlement, and in making a partial
journey to the mountains, which was introductory to his undertaking
the journey he afterwards performed, but which I was obliged to
effect by a ruse, as Col. Paterson had very ill-naturedly informed
me that officers being at all detached from their regimental duty
was contrary to some instructions he had from the Duke of York. In
consequence I was obliged to give up his services after this
unhandsome claim, but claimed him as my <i>aide-de-camp</i>, and
that the object of discovery should not be relinquished, I sent him
on an embassy to the King of the Mountains."</blockquote>

<p>This idea of an embassy to the King of the Mountains is about as
unique an incident in the history of exploration as can be
imagined. Whether Barraillier reached this fancied potentate or not
we are left in ignorance. Governor King says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"He was gone six weeks, and penetrated one hundred and
thirty-seven miles among the mountains beyond the Nepean. His
journal being wrote in such an unintelligible hand, I have not been
able to get it translated or copied, but have sent it open under
your address to Lord Hobart...I have not had time to decipher and
read it, but am satisfied from what M. Barraillier has done and
seen, that passing these barriers, if at all practicable, is of no
great moment to attempt any further at present, as it is now well
ascertained that the cattle have not, nor cannot, make any progress
to the westward, unless they find a passage to the northward or
southward of those extensive and stupendous barriers. I intend
sending M. Barraillier to Port Jarvis very soon, to penetrate into
the interior from thence, if Col. Paterson is not advised to
prevent it."</blockquote>

<p>From this it will plainly be seen how completely the colonists
had given themselves up to the dominion of the overshadowing range
that stayed their western progress. It required the stern hand of
necessity to compel them to at last force that "stupendous
barrier," as King terms it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the presence of the French ships under Baudin, had
created uneasiness in Governor King's mind, rumour and gossip had
magnified their intentions into a sinister claim being about to be
established upon Van Dieman's Land or the south coast of New
Holland. In 1802, King had sent home to Sir Joseph Banks his idea
of the importance of King's Island, and the adjacent harbour of
Port Phillip.</p>

<blockquote>"Port Phillip is also a great acquisition, and as I
have urged the fixing of a settlement in the latter place, I am
anxious to begin it, but unfortunately I have no person I can send
there equal to the charge. Policy certainly requires our having a
settlement in these Straits."</blockquote>

<p>No lack of zeal for the future supremacy of the British flag in
these seas can be charged upon the founders of the colony, in fact,
Governor King sent a small schooner under command of a midshipman
after M. Baudin, with secret orders to watch their movements, and,
if necessary, hoist the King's colours and land a corporal's guard
at any place where the French appeared likely to make a
demonstration.</p>

<p>Port Phillip was discovered by Lieutenant Murray, of the Lady
Nelson, in 1802. Surveyor-General Grimes went there with him, and
during the survey he made, is reported to have camped on the spot
where Melbourne now stands. The port was discovered three times
independently in the same year. First by Murray, next by Baudin,
and again by Flinders. Colonel Collins, formerly of Norfolk Island,
was dispatched in the year that Governor King wrote his letter
(1803) to found a township. He at once declared the country unfit
for settlement, with scarcely any examination; and it was
immediately abandoned in favour of Van Dieman's Land.</p>

<p>The results of efforts at inland discovery were now but slight.
Flinders on the south coast had sailed up Spencer's Gulf, and from
Mount Brown at the head a fine view was obtained, but nothing
more.</p>

<blockquote>"Neither rivers nor lakes could be perceived, nor
anything of the sea to the south-eastward. In almost every
direction the eye traversed over an uninterruptedly flat, woody
country; the sole exceptions being the ridge of mountains extending
north and south, and the water of the gulph to the
south-westward."</blockquote>

<p>Compared with the great size of the island continent, it will be
seen that but an insignificant portion had, by the end of the
eighteenth century come under the sway of colonisation. The rivers
Hawkesbury, Nepean, and Grose, with other minor tributaries in the
neighbourhood of Sydney. To the north, the river Hunter, and to the
south, the district now known as the Illawarra. This was the sum
total of the known country inside the coastal line; and with all
the wish to extend their knowledge of their wide domain, the
administrative demands of the little colony pressed too heavily on
the authorities to permit them to devote much time to extended
exploration.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first ten years of the present century were singularly
devoid of excursions inland. The strip of country between the range
and the sea, sufficing for the immediate wants of the settlers, and
the discovery of the Hunter River having opened so much new country
for their use, no actual necessity compelled them at this period to
go further a-field. This lack of urgent need, combined with the bad
success that had attended all efforts to penetrate the mountains,
had somewhat damped the ardour of the colonists.</p>

<p>But throughout these years the stock steadily increased, and the
severe drought in 1813 led some of the settlers to make another
attempt to find out new pasture lands.</p>

<p>The victory that at last crowned the struggle may be said to
have at once inaugurated a new phase of exploration The days of
expeditions on foot, when each man carried his own supply of
provisions, and the limit of their journey only extended a little
over a hundred miles, were past. Horses were now destined to play
an important part in the outfit of the explorer, and take their
share of sacrificing their lives in the cause.</p>

<p>The results gained by these first journeys were far from
promising; always hoping to find a navigable river, or rivers,
through the interior, the colonists found themselves most
unexpectedly baffled. Having discovered the head waters of large
streams flowing on a western course, with a sufficient depth of
water for boat navigation, it appeared conclusive that to follow
them down would in course of time lead the party doing so to the
sea; the only probable obstacle which would come in the way would
be falls. But the rivers led them into shallow stagnant swamps,
with no limit within ken; the outskirts, so they deemed, of an
inland sea.</p>

<p>Across here Oxley wrote, <i>desert</i>; unfitted ever to sustain
settlement, and in doing this he did not err more glaringly than
many later pioneers. It must be borne in mind that the
characteristics of the inland plain were all new to the travellers
who first ventured to enter its confines. They had not won the key
of the desert; the fashion in which nature adapted herself to
climatic decrees was a lesson still to be learnt. Oxley spoke
honestly when, in bitter disappointment, he prophesied the future
of the great plain to be that of an unprofitable waste, wherein the
work of men's hands and the cunning of their brains would avail
nothing; but he spoke hastily and almost thoughtlessly. The great
plain had its glorious mission to fulfil, but the secret, like all
things worth knowing, was one that took time and labour to solve;
not in one or two generations was it to be done.</p>

<p>There was one great factor in the reclamation of the desert that
Oxley could not take into his calculations&mdash;for he did not
know its power&mdash;the sure, if gradual change wrought by
stocking. Under the ceaseless tread of myriad hoofs, the loose,
open soil was to become firm and hard, whilst fresh growths of herb
and grass followed the footsteps of the invading herds. The shaking
bogs and morasses were to become solidified, and the waters that
permeated them to retreat into well defined chains of ponds and
lagoons. This the first explorer could not foresee, he was
disheartened by what he found, and unwitting of the change that was
to follow he gave a hostile verdict. But although it did not fall
to his lot to trace out the great system of the Murray watershed,
he had, at any rate, the proud satisfaction of achieving the first
stage.</p>

<p>Governor Macquarie, whose name has been sown broadcast over so
much of New South Wales, was a man bent on the development of the
colony as rapidly as possible, and although the defects in his
administration have been severely criticised, exploration received
at his hands every encouragement, and during his tenure of office,
the first steps were taken to open up the vast field of inland
discovery. We must now remember that the adaptability of the
country to pastoral occupation was fully recognised. The days when
famine was imminent if the fleet from England did not duly arrive
had passed away. The future of the colony was assured, provided
fresh outlets could be opened up.</p>

<p>In 1813, the prolonged drought to which the little settlement
had been subjected, led to a most serious view being taken of the
future. The stock had now attained dimensions, when the yearly
increase was something considerable, compared to the narrow strip
of grazing lands that supported the herds. It was an evident
necessity to find fresh territory speedily, or great loss would
inevitably ensue. Three of the settlers interested in
stock-breeding, made another attempt to cross the range during this
year. They were: William Charles Wentworth, whose name is so
familiar to Australians, Lieutenant Lawson, of the Royal Veteran
Company, and Mr. Gregory Blaxland. They crossed the Nepean at Emu
Plains, and attempted to follow up a main spur forming the
watershed of the Grose, and for a time successfully pursued its
twists and windings, keeping to the crown of the ridge. At last,
like all their predecessors, they began to get entangled in the
intricate net-work of deep gullies that rendered straightforward
travelling so difficult in this region. Like them, they commenced
to think advance impossible, and to speak of turning back. Passages
had to be cut through the thick brushwood for their pack horses,
circuitous roads found around steeps too precipitous to scale, and
the purpose of the journey seemed hopelessly lost. They had
succeeded in crossing the first outwork of the mountains, but the
Main Range had yet to be won. At length they fortunately hit upon a
dividing spur, leading to the westward, and this they perseveringly
followed, until they were rewarded by reaching the summit, and
seeing below them a comparatively open valley, and beyond, chains
of hills, broken it is true, but only trifling compared to what
they had passed over. It was a work of time and much labour to gain
access to this valley. The mountain they had ascended was steep and
rugged, and great care had to be exercised in descending. But
fatigue was not much thought of with their hopes so happily
fulfilled.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley they found a running stream and good
pasture, beyond this point they proceeded about six or eight miles
in order to ascertain the extent of their discoveries, and then
returned, having been absent one month.</p>

<p>The creek found by Blaxland and party was one of the tributaries
of the Nepean, so that granted that a range had been crossed,
access had been only obtained to the higher waters of a coast
river. But although this important journey fell short of one of the
great aims of western exploration, namely the discovery of a river
flowing to the west, it was the immediate cause of the expedition
being undertaken that led to the finding of the Macquarie.</p>

<p>George William Evans, Deputy-Surveyor of Lands, can certainly
claim the honour of first discovering an Australian inland river;
but Blaxland and his companions led the way across the hardest
portion of the course.</p>

<p>As may well be believed, the tidings brought back by the
exploring party created great excitement in the small community. No
longer would the mountainous barrier frown defiance at them; for
over thirty years it had successfully resisted all their attempts,
but its time had come; the march to the west had at last commenced.
On receipt of the news, Governor Macquarie sent out Mr. Evans with
a party to at once follow up this discovery and find out what lay
beyond. Evans crossed the Nepean on the 20th of November, and in
six days arrived at the spot where the last party had turned back.
Striking westward, he found a broken, hilly country, which was,
however, well grassed and watered, presenting little hindrance to
his progress, and on the 30th of the month, he struck the head of a
stream holding a distinctly western course. Following this down, he
found it joined by another from the south, and below the junction
he gave the new found river the name of the Macquarie.</p>

<p>So promising was the country that he continued his course until
the 18th December, when finding the river, now of a fair magnitude,
still flowing steadily north-west, and not being prepared for a
very prolonged absence, he turned back and retraced his steps,
arriving at the Nepean on the 8th January, 1814. Strange to say,
during the whole time of his absence in this hitherto untrodden
waste, the only natives seen by the party were four women and two
children.</p>

<p>This most successful termination of the work. commenced by
Messrs. Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth. and the confirmation of
the hopes that had been entertained, led to more active steps being
at once initiated.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox was entrusted with the superintendence of the work of
constructing a public road across the range, following much the
same route as that taken by the first explorers; and this work was
completed early in the year 1815, and on the 26th April of the same
year the Governor and a large staff set out to visit the new
territory, and arrived there on the 4th May.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Evans was again sent out to the south-west, and
once more he was successful, returning with tidings of the
discovery of the Lachlan River. He was absent nearly a month, and
met the Governor and suite on their arrival at Bathurst Plains.</p>

<p>The course of the Lachlan being nearly due west, it was selected
as the most likely river of the two to lead immediately to the
navigable waters of the interior, which everybody now firmly
believed in; but a delay of nearly two years occurred before an
expedition was formed to carry into effect the purpose of following
it down with boats.</p>

<p>Meantime, the settlers took every advantage of this new outlet
for their energies. Cattle and sheep were pushed out, and some of
the land put under tillage. Buildings rapidly sprang up, and,
favoured by a beautiful site, the township of Bathurst soon
presented an orderly appearance. Private enterprise had also been
at work elsewhere, and the early pioneer graziers were now making
south from the settlement towards the Shoalhaven River and the
intermediate country. It was down here that young Hamilton Hume,
the first native-born explorer to take the field, was then gaining
his bushcraft. Hume was a son of the Rev. Andrew Hume, who held an
appointment in the Commissariat Department, and came to the colony
in the <i>Lady Julian</i>.</p>

<p>The future explorer was born at Parramatta in 1797, so that he
was but seventeen when, in 1814, he made his maiden effort in the
country around Berrima, in company with his brother and a black
boy; and-in the year following he again made an excursion in this
district. In 1816 his father conducted Dr. Throsby to new country
that the energy of his sons had discovered; and in March, 1817, at
the time when Oxley was about starting on his Lachlan expedition,
Hume, at the request of Governor Macquarie, went with Mr. Surveyor
Meehan and Mr. Throsby on an expedition as far as the Shoalhaven
River. Here, in consequence of some dispute with Mr. Meehan, Mr.
Throsby left the party, and, accompanied by a black boy, made his
way to Port Jarvis.</p>

<p>Meehan and Hume continued their journey, and discovered Lake
George, Lake Bathurst, and the country called Goulburn Plains.</p>

<p>But the trip undertaken by Mr. Oxley at this time, leading as it
did to such unexpected results, claims our first attention. As the
party were to take boats with them, boat builders were sent up to
Bathurst, thence to proceed to the river and build the necessary
craft. A depôt having been formed on the Lachlan River, on the 6th
of April, 1817, Mr. Oxley left Sydney to join his party there, and
arrived at this depôt on the 25th of the same month, having been
detained a short time at Bathurst. On the 1st of May, Mr. Oxley
reached the limit of Mr. Evans' journey in 1815, a small creek
which they christened Byrne Creek; from here the work of
exploration commenced.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the men comprising, this, the first
most important expedition in the annals of exploration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"John Oxley, chief of the expedition; George William
Evans, second in command; Allan Cunningham, King's botanist;
Charles Fraser, colonial botanist; William Parr, mineralogist;
George Hubbard, boat builder; James King, 1st boatman and sailor;
James King, 2nd horseshoer; William Meggs, butcher; Patrick Byrne,
guide and horse leader; William Blake, harness mender; George
Simpson, for chaining with surveyors; William Warner, servant to
Mr. Oxley."</blockquote>

<p>They had with them two boats and fourteen bât (pack) and riding
horses.</p>

<p>Following the bank of the river the party met with no
obstruction to their progress for twelve days, save the usual
accidents and delays incidental to travelling in an unexplored
region. Oxley's opinion of the value of the new district had, as is
evident from his journal, been steadily decreasing since leaving
the depôt. The flatness of the country, the numerous branches of
the river and the want of height visible in its banks, seemingly
depressed him very much. On the 6th of May he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I have reason to believe that the whole of the
extensive tract of country, named Princess Charlotte's Crescent"
(about 130 miles west of Bathurst), "is at times drowned by the
overflowing of the river; the marks of floods were observed in all
directions, and the waters in the marshes and lagoons were all
traced as being derived from the river. During a course of upwards
of seventy miles, not a single running stream emptied itself into
the river on either side; and, I am forced to conclude, that in
common seasons this whole tract is extremely badly watered, and
that it derives its principal, if not only supply, from the river
within the bounding ranges of Princess Charlotte's Crescent. There
are doubtless many small eminences which might afford a retreat
from the inundations, but those which were observed by us were too
trifling and distant from each other to stand out distinct from the
vast level surface which the crescent presents to the view. The
soil of the country we passed over was a poor and cold clay; but
there are many rich levels which, could they be drained and
defended from the inundations of the river, would amply repay the
cultivation. These flats are certainly not adapted for cattle; the
grass is too swampy, and the bushes, swamps, and lagoons are too
thickly intermingled with the better portions, to render it a safe
or desirable grazing country. The timber is universally bad and
small; a few misshapen gum trees on the immediate banks of the
river may be considered as exceptions."</blockquote>

<p>On the 12th of May, their, as yet, uninterrupted course down the
river received an abrupt check.</p>

<blockquote>"We had scarcely proceeded a mile from the last branch
before it became evident that it would be impossible to advance
farther in the direction in which we were travelling. The stream
here overflowed both banks, and its course was lost among marshes,
its channel not being distinguishable from the surrounding
waters.<br>
<br>
"Observing an eminence about half a mile from the south side, we
crossed over the horses and baggage" (by aid of the boats) "at a
place where the water was level with the banks, and which, when
within its usual channel, did not exceed thirty or forty feet in
width; its depth even now being only twelve feet.<br>
<br>
"We ascended the hill, and had the mortification to perceive the
termination of our research, at least down this branch of the
river. The whole country from the west, north-west, round to the
north, was either a complete marsh or lay under water, and this for
a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles in those directions. To
the south and south-west the country appeared more elevated, but
low, marshy grounds lay between us and it, which rendered it
impossible for us to proceed thither from our present situation. I
therefore determined to return back to the place where the two
branches of the principal river separated, and follow the
south-west branch as far as it should be navigable. Our fears were,
however, stronger than our hopes, lest it would end in a similar
manner to, the one we had already traced, until it became no longer
navigable for boats.<br>
<br>
"In pursuance of this intention we descended the hill, which was
named Farewell Hill, from its being the termination of our journey
in a north-west direction, at least for the present, and proceeded
up the south bank of the stream."</blockquote>

<p>The investigation of the south-west branch proving equally
unsatisfactory, Oxley determined to leave the river and strike for
the coast in the neighbourhood of Cape Northumberland, anticipating
that on this course he would intersect any river rising in these
marshes and falling into the sea between Spencer's Gulf and Cape
Otway. The boats were hauled up on the south bank and secured,
together with such articles as they could not take with them; and
at nine o'clock on May 18th, the journey to the coast
commenced.</p>

<p>From having too much water the party now found themselves
straitened for want of it, and the journey, too, began to tell upon
the horses. Thick scrubs of eucalyptus brush, overrun with creepers
and prickly acacia bushes, soon helped to bar the way, and when
they at last reached the point of a range, which they named Peel
Range, Oxley reluctantly abandoned his idea of making for the coast
in a south-west direction, and turned north. Wearily he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"June 4. Weather as usual fine and clear, which is the
greatest comfort we enjoy in these deserts abandoned by every
living creature capable of getting out of them. I was obliged to
send the horses back to our former halting place for water, a
distance of near eight miles this is terrible for the horses, who
are in general extremely reduced but two in particular cannot, I
think, endure this miserable existence much longer.<br>
<br>
"At five o'clock, two men whom I had sent to explore the country to
the south-west and see if any water could be found, returned after
proceeding six or seven miles; they found it impossible to go any
farther in that direction or even south, from the thick bushes that
intersected their course on every side; and no water (nor, in fact,
the least sign of any) was discovered either by them or by those
who were sent in search of it nearer our little camp."</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<blockquote>"June 5. From everything I can see of the country to
the south-west, it appears, upon the most mature deliberation,
highly imprudent to persevere longer in that direction, as the
consequences to the horses of want of grass and water might be most
serious; and we are well assured that within forty miles on that
point the country is the same as before passed over. In adopting a
north-westerly course, it is my intention to be entirely guided by
the possibility of procuring subsistence for the horses, that being
the main point on which all our ulterior proceedings must hinge. It
is, however, to be expected that as the country is certainly lower
to the west and north-west than from south-east to south-west,
there is a greater probability of finding water in this latter
direction. In our present perplexing situation, however, it is
impossible to lay down any fixed plan, as (be it what it may)
circumstances after all must guide us. Our horses are unable to go
more than eight or ten miles a day, but even then they must be
assured of finding food, of which, in these deserts, the chances
are against the existence.<br>
<br>
"Yesterday being the King's birthday, Mr. Cunningham planted
under Mount Brogden acorns, peach and apricot stones, and quince
seeds, with the hope, rather than the expectation, that they would
grow and serve to commemorate the day and situation, should these
desolate plains be ever again visited by civilised man, of which,
however, I think there is very little probability.<br>
<br>
"June 6. A mild pleasant morning: set forward on our journey to the
westward and north-west, in hopes of finding a better
country.<br>
<br>
"June 8th. The whole country in these directions, as
far as the eye could reach, was one continued thicket of eucalyptus
scrub. It was physically impossible to proceed that way, and our
situation was too critical to admit of delay; it was therefore
resolved to return back to our last station on the 6th, under
Peel's Range, if for no other purpose than that of giving the
horses water. I felt that by attempting to proceed westerly I
should endanger the safety of every man composing the expedition,
without any practical good arising from such perseverance, It was
therefore deemed more prudent to keep along the base of Peel's
Range to its termination, having some chance of finding water in
its rocky ravines, whilst there was none at all in attempting to
keep the level country."</blockquote>

<p>We have now seen how Oxley, prevented from following the river
down by an overflow amongst the marshes, turned south-west, only to
be driven back by impenetrable scrubs and general aridity. He
struck north, with the hope of shortly regaining the too well
watered country he had left. The fixed idea of the utterly useless
nature of the country is ever present in his mind as he proceeds.
On the 21st June he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The farther we proceed north-westerly the more
convinced I am hat for all the practical purposes of civilised man
the interior of this country, westward of a certain meridian, is
uninhabitable, deprived as it 5 of wood, water and
grass."</blockquote>

<p>A sweeping and hasty condemnation this, considering that he
threshold of the interior had been scarcely more than crossed.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June the travellers suddenly and unexpectedly
came upon the river again, an incident, as the leader says, little
expected by any one.</p>

<p>The next day they started once more to follow down the stream,
with brighter hopes of better success, until, on the 7th of July,
progress was once more arrested, and Oxley turned back recording in
his journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"It is with infinite regret and pain that I was forced
to come to the conclusion that the interior of this vast country is
a marsh, and uninhabitable."</blockquote>

<p>The party now retraced their steps to the eastward, disgusted
with the want of success that had attended their efforts, and the
dreary monotony of their surroundings.</p>

<blockquote>"There is a uniformity in the barren desolateness of
this country which wearies one more than I am able to express. One
tree, one soil, one water, and one description of bird, fish, or
animal prevails alike for ten miles and for one hundred. A variety
of wretchedness is at all times preferable to one unvarying cause
of pain or distress."</blockquote>

<p>On the 4th of August, being then satisfied of their position on
the river, and knowing that a further course along its bank would
only lead them amongst the swamps that had stayed their downward
journey, it was determined to strike to the northeastward, in order
to avoid this low country and, if possible, reach the Macquarie
River and follow it up to the settlement of Bathurst. After
experiencing some difficulty in manufacturing a raft out of pine
logs, whereby to cross their baggage over, Oxley and his party left
the Lachlan.</p>

<p>They endured for some time a repetition of their struggles in
the south for grass and water, and then the explorers reached
fertile and well-watered country; and, on the 19th of August,
halted on the bank of the Macquarie, which river Oxley found to
equal his fondest hopes. They now turned their steps homeward, and
arrived at Bathurst on the evening of the 29th of August.</p>

<p>Convinced that, in the Macquarie, he had now discovered the
highway into the interior, Oxley writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Nothing can afford a stronger contrast than the two
rivers, Lachlan and Macquarie; different in their habit, their
appearance, and the sources from which they derive their waters,
but, above all, differing in the country bordering on them; the one
constantly receiving great accession of water from four streams,
and as liberally rendering fertile a great extent of country,
whilst the other, from its source to its termination, is constantly
diffusing and diminishing the waters it originally receives over
low and barren deserts, creating only wet flats and uninhabitable
morasses, and during its protracted and sinuous course, is never
indebted to a single tributary stream."</blockquote>

<p>Oxley having successfully carried through the Lachlan
expedition, was at once selected to command a similar one down the
Macquarie, on which, now that the former river had so disappointed
expectations, men's hopes were fixed. Oxley seems to have been
particularly unhappy in his deductions, every guess hazarded by him
as to the future utility of the country he passed over, or the
probable nature of the farther interior, was incorrect; and now the
Macquarie was to refuse to bear his boat's keel to the westward;
after the same manner as the Lachlan.</p>

<p>In those days men had not yet mastered the idea that the
physical formation of Australia was not to be worked out on the
same lines as that of other countries; they looked vainly for a
river with a wide and noble opening, and none being found on the
surveyed coast, conjecture placed it far away in a few leagues of
unexplored shore line on the north-west. The constancy with which
the southern coast had been examined, precluded all idea from men's
minds that the entrance to this long sought river was there. No, it
must be yet undiscovered to the westward. Wentworth
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"If the sanguine hopes to which the discovery of this
river (the Macquarie) has given birth, should be realised, and it
should be found to empty itself into the ocean on the north-west
coast, which is the only part of this vast island that has not been
accurately surveyed, in what mighty conceptions of the future
greatness and power of this colony, may we not reasonably indulge?
The nearest distance from the point at which Mr. Oxley left off, to
any part of the western coast, is very little short of two thousand
miles. If this river, therefore, be already of the size of the
Hawkesbury at Windsor, which is not less than two hundred and fifty
yards in breadth, and of sufficient depth to float a seventy-four
gun ship, it is not difficult to imagine what must be its magnitude
at its confluence with the ocean: before it can arrive at which it
has to traverse a country nearly two thousand miles in extent. If
it possess the usual sinuosities of rivers, its course to the sea
cannot be less than from five to six thousand miles, and the
endless accession of tributary streams which it must receive in its
passage through so great an extent of country will without doubt
enable it to vie in point of magnitude with any river in the
world."</blockquote>

<p>It may, therefore, well be imagined that it was in a most
sanguine spirit that Oxley undertook his second journey.</p>

<p>As before, a party had been sent ahead to build boats, and get
everything in readiness, and, on the 6th June, 1818, he started on
his second expedition into the interior. He had with him, as next
in command, the indefatigable Evans, Dr. Harris, who volunteered,
Charles Frazer, botanist, and twelve men, eighteen horses, two
boats, and provisions for twenty-four weeks.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of the month, having reached a distance of nearly
125 miles from the depôt in Wellington Valley, without the
travellers experiencing more obstruction than might have been
expected, two men, Thomas Thatcher and John Hall, were sent back to
Bathurst with a report to Governor Macquarie, as had been
previously arranged.</p>

<p>No sooner had the two parties separated, one with high hopes of
their future success, the others bearing back tidings of these
confident hopes, than doubt and distrust entered the mind of the
leader. In his journal, written not twenty-four hours after the
departure of his messengers, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"For four or five miles there was no material change in
the general appearance of the country from what it had been on the
preceding days, but for the fast six miles the land was very
considerably lower, interspersed with plains clear of timber, and
dry. On the banks it was still lower, and in many parts it was
evident that the river floods swept over them, though this did not
appear to be universally the case..."These unfavourable appearances
threw a damp upon our hopes, and we feared that our anticipations
had been too sanguine."</blockquote>

<p>In his after report to the Governor, forwarded by Mr. Evans to
Newcastle, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"My letter, dated the 22nd June last, will have made
your Excellency acquainted with the sanguine hopes I entertained
from the appearance of the river, that its termination would be
either in interior waters or coastwise. When I wrote that letter to
your Excellency, I certainly did not anticipate the possibility
that a very few days farther travelling would lead us to its
termination as an accessible river."</blockquote>

<p>So short-lived were the hopes he had entertained.</p>

<p>On the 30th June, after, for many days, finding the country
becoming flatter and more liable to floods, Oxley found himself
almost hemmed in by water, and had to return with the whole party
to a safer encampment, where a consultation was held. It was
decided to send the horses and baggage back to Mount Harris, a
small elevation some fifteen miles higher up the river, whilst
Oxley himself, with four volunteers and the large boat, proceeded
down the river, taking with them a month's provisions. During his
absence, Mr. Evans was to proceed to the north-east some sixty
miles, and return upon a more northerly course, this being the
direction the party intended taking if the river failed them.</p>

<p>Let us see how Oxley fared.</p>

<blockquote>"July 2. I proceeded down the river, during one of the
wettest and most stormy days we had yet experienced. About twenty
miles from where I set out, there was, properly speaking, no
country; the river overflowing its banks, and dividing into
streams, which I found had no permanent separation from the main
branch, but united themselves to it on a multitude of points. We
went seven or eight miles farther, when we stopped for the night,
upon a space of ground scarcely large enough to enable us to kindle
a fire. The principal stream ran with great rapidity and its banks
and neighbourhood as far as we could see, were covered with wood,
inclosing us within a margin or bank, vast spaces of country clear
of timber were under water, and covered with the common reed, which
grew to the height of six or seven feet above the surface. The
course and distance by the river was estimated to be from
twenty-seven to thirty miles, on a north-west line.<br>
<br>
"July 3rd. Towards the morning the storm abated, and at daylight we
proceeded on our voyage. The main bed of the river was much
contracted, but very deep, the waters spreading to a depth of a
foot or eighteen inches over the banks, but all running on the same
point of bearing. We met with considerable interruption from fallen
timber, which in places nearly choked up the channel. After going
about twenty miles we lost the land and trees: the channel of the
river, which lay through reeds, and was from one to three feet
deep, ran northerly. This continued for three or four miles
further, when although there had been no previous change in the
breadth, depth, and rapidity of the stream for several miles, and I
was sanguine in my expectations of soon entering the long sought
for Australian sea, it all at once eluded our further search by
spreading on every point from northwest to northeast, amongst the
ocean of reeds that surrounded us still running with the same
rapidity as before. There was no channel whatever amongst these
reeds, and the depth varied from five to three feet. This
astonishing change (for I cannot call it a termination of the
river), of course, left me no alternative but to endeavour to
return to some spot on which we could effect a landing before dark.
I estimated that on this day we had gone about twenty-four miles,
on nearly the same point of bearing as yesterday. To assert
positively that we were on the margin of the lake or sea into which
this great body of water is discharged might reasonably be deemed a
conclusion which has nothing but conjecture for its basis; but if
an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances,
mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the vicinity of an
inland sea or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually
filling up by immense depositions from the higher lands, left by
the waters which flow into it. It is most singular that the high
lands on this continent seem to be confined to the sea coast or not
to extend to any distance from it."</blockquote>

<p>Satisfied that to the westward nothing more could be done in the
way of exploration, Oxley returned to Mount Harris, where a
temporary depôt was formed. Mr. Evans immediately started on a trip
to the north-east; he was absent ten days, during which time he
discovered the Castlereagh River.</p>

<p>The weather had set in wet and stormy, the rivers kept rising
and falling, and the level country was soft and boggy, excessively
tiring to their jaded horses; moreover, in consequence of the boats
being now left behind, the packs were greatly increased in
weight.</p>

<p>On the 20th July, the whole of the party bade adieu to the
Macquarie, which they had once trusted to so fondly, and commenced
their journey to the eastern coast, making in the first place for
Arbuthnot's Range. Before leaving, a bottle was buried on Mount
Harris, containing a written scheme of their proposed route and
intentions, with some silver coin.</p>

<p>On July 27th, they reached the bank of the Castlereagh, after a
hard struggle through the bogs and swamps. The river was flooded,
and must have risen almost directly after Mr. Evans crossed it on
his homeward route. It was not until the 2nd of August that the
waters fell sufficiently to allow them to cross. Still steering for
the range, their course lay across shaking quagmires, or wading
through miles of water; constantly having to unload and reload the
unfortunate horses, who could scarcely get through the bog without
their packs. Before reaching the range, the party camped at the
small hill, previously ascended by Mr. Evans. Here they found the
compass strangely affected: on placing it on a rock the card flew
round with extreme velocity, and then suddenly settled at opposite
points, the north point becoming the south. A short distance from
the base of the hill the needle regained its proper position. This
hill received the name of Loadstone Hill.</p>

<p>Crossing Arbuthnot Range round the northern base of Mount
Exmouth, the explorers, although still terribly harassed by the
boggy state of the country, found themselves in splendid pastoral
land. Hills, dales, and plains of the richest description lay
before them, and from the elevations the view presented was of the
most varied kind; this tract of country was called by Oxley
Liverpool Plains. On Mount Tetley, and many of the hills about, the
same variations of the compass were observed as had formerly been
noticed on Loadstone Hill. Through this beautiful district the
party now had a less arduous journey than before, and their horses
were able to regain some of their lost strength.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, they crossed a river which they named
the Peel River, and here one of their number narrowly escaped
drowning. Still pushing eastward, and continuing to travel through
beautiful grazing country Oxley was suddenly stopped by a deep glen
running across his track:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"This tremendous ravine runs near north and south, its
breadth at the bottom does not apparently exceed one hundred or two
hundred feet, whilst the separation of the outer edges is from two
to three miles. I am certain that in perpendicular depth it exceeds
three thousand feet. The slopes from the edges were so steep and
covered with loose stones that any attempt to descend even on foot
was impracticable. From either side of this abyss, smaller ravines
of similar character diverged, the distance between which seldom
exceeded half-a-mile. Down them trickled small rills of water,
derived from the range on which we were. We could not, however,
discern which way the water in the main valley ran, as the bottom
was concealed by a thicket of vines and creeping
plants."</blockquote>

<p>This barrier turned them to the south, and afterwards to the
west again; on the way, they met with a grand fall one hundred and
fifty feet in height, which they named Becket's Cataract. At the
head of the glen they found another fall which they estimated at
two hundred and thirty feet in height; crossing above this
cataract, which was called Bathurst's Fall, the eastern course was
once more resumed, and tempests and storms found them wandering
amongst the deep ravines and gloomy forests of the coast range,
seeking for a descent to the lower lands.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September, Oxley, accompanied by Evans, ascended
a mountain to try and discover a practicable route, and from there
caught sight of the sea.</p>

<blockquote>"Bilboa's ecstasy at the first sight of the South Sea
could not have been greater than ours when, on gaining the summit
of this mountain, we beheld Old Ocean at our feet: it inspired us
with new life: every difficulty vanished, and in imagination we
were already home."</blockquote>

<p>Now commenced the final descent, and a perilous one it
was:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"How the horses descended I scarcely know; and the bare
recollection of the imminent dangers which they escaped makes me
tremble. At one period of the descent I would willingly have
compromised for a loss of one third of them to ensure the safety of
the remainder. It is to the exertions and steadiness of the men,
under Providence, that their safety must be ascribed. The thick
tufts of grass and the loose soil also gave them a surer footing,
of which the men skilfully availed themselves."</blockquote>

<p>They were now on a river running direct to the sea, which was
named the Hastings River, and which the party followed down with
more or less trouble until they reached a port at the mouth of it,
which the explorer, after the fashion of the day, immediately
dubbed Port Macquarie. It is an unfortunate thing for New South
Wales that such an absence of originality with regard to naming
newly discovered places was displayed by the travellers of that
time.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October, the wanderers made a final start for
home, commencing a toilsome march along the coast south. Stopped
and interrupted for a time by many inlets and creeks, they at last
came upon a boat buried in the sand, which had belonged to a
Hawkesbury vessel, lost some time before; this boat they carried
with them as far as Port Stephens, where they arrived on the 1st of
November, using it to facilitate the passage of the salt water
arms. During the latter part of this wearisome journey, they were
much harassed by unprovoked attacks by the natives, and one of the
men, William Black, was dangerously wounded, being speared through
the back and in the lower part of the body.</p>

<p>Oxley had thus, after innumerable hardships and dangers, brought
his party, with the exception of the wounded man, back in safety to
the settlements. True he had not fulfilled the mission he was
dispatched on, but he had discovered large tracts of valuable land
fit for settlement; he had crossed the formidable coast range far
away to the north, and established the fact that communication
between his newly discovered port and the interior was practicable.
Oxley's expeditions were both well equipped and well carried out,
he also had the assistance of able and zealous coadjutors, each or
any of them being capable of assuming the leadership in case of
misfortune. His travels may be said to inaugurate the series of
brilliant exploits in the field of exploration that we are about to
enter on.</p>

<p>In 1819, Messrs. Oxley and Meehan, accompanied by young Hume,
made a short excursion to Jarvis Bay, Oxley returning by sea, his
companions overland.</p>

<p>The era of the pioneer squatter had now commenced henceforth
exploration and pastoral enterprise went hand in hand. North and
south of the new town of Bathurst, the advance of the flocks and
herds went on; Oxley's report may have somewhat checked a westerly
migration, but the stay in that direction was not doomed to last
long. Northward, to and beyond the Cugeegong River and the fertile
valley of the Upper Hunter, southward, towards the mysterious
Morumbidgee, which was now reported as having been found by the
settlers, pressed the pioneers. It is not known who was the first
discoverer of this river. Hume, in company with Throsby, must have
been close to it during their various excursions, and in 1821 Hume
discovered Yass Plains, almost on its bank. It was, however,
destined to be the future highway to the undiscovered land of the
west.</p>

<p>In 1822 Messrs. Lawson and Scott attempted to reach Liverpool
Plains, Oxley's great discovery, from Bathurst; they were, however,
unable to penetrate the range that formed the southern boundary of
the Plains, and returned, having discovered a new river at the foot
of the range, which they named the Goulburn.</p>

<p>In 1823, Oxley, Cunningham, and Currie were all in the field in
different directions.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of May, Captain Mark John Currie, R.N., accompanied
by Brigade-Major Ovens, and having with them Joseph Wild, a notable
bushman, started on an exploratory trip south of Lake George. On
the 1st of June, they came to the Morumbidgee, as it was then
called, and followed up the bank of it, looking for a crossing. The
day before they had caught sight of a high range of mountains to
the southward, partially snow-topped. In their progress along the
river they came to fine open downs and plains, which, with the
singularly bad taste, which still, unfortunately, holds sway,
Currie immediately named after the then Governor, "Brisbane Downs;"
although but a short time before they had learnt from the
aborigines the native name of Monaroo. Fortunately, in this
instance, Monaroo has been preserved, and Brisbane Downs
forgotten.</p>

<p>On the 6th June they crossed the river, and found the open
country still stretching south, bounded to the west by the snowy
mountains they had formerly seen, and to the east by a range that
they took to be the coast range. Their provisions being limited,
they turned back, and reached Throsby's farm of Bong-Bong on the
14th of the same month.</p>

<p>Cunningham, meantime, during the months of April, May, and June,
was busily engaged in the country north of Bathurst. He had two
purposes in view&mdash;his pursuit as a botanist, and the discovery
of a pass through the northern range on to Liverpool Plains, which
Lieutenant Lawson had been unable to find. On reaching the range he
searched vainly to the eastward for any valley that would enable
him to pierce the barrier, and had to retrace his steps and seek
more to the west. Here he came upon a pass, which he called
Pandora's Pass, [See Appendix.] and which he found to be
practicable as a stock route to the plains. He returned to Bathurst
on the 27th of June.</p>

<p>In October, Oxley started from Sydney on a very different kind
of expedition to those lately undertaken by him. His mission now
was to examine the inlets of Port Curtis, Moreton Bay, and Port
Bowen, with a view to forming penal establishments there. On the
21st of October, therefore, 1823, he left in the colonial cutter
<i>Mermaid</i>, accompanied by Messrs. Stirling and Uniacke. At
Port Macquarie, Oxley had the pleasure of seeing the settlement
that had so rapidly sprung up on his recommendation of the
suitability of the port. Further on, they discovered and named the
Tweed River. On the 6th November, the <i>Mermaid</i> anchored in
Port Curtis. Here the party remained for some time, and found and
christened the Boyne River. Oxley's report was unfavourable.</p>

<blockquote>"Having," he says, "viewed and examined with the most
anxious attention every point that afforded the least promise of
being eligible for the site of a settlement, I respectfully submit
it as my opinion, that Port Curtis and its vicinity do not afford
such a site; and I do not think that any convict establishment
could be formed there that would return either from the natural
productions of the country, or as arising from agricultural labour,
any portion of the great expense which would necessarily attend its
first formation."</blockquote>

<p>As it was too late in the season to examine Port Bowen, the
<i>Mermaid</i> went south, entered Moreton Bay, and anchored off
the river that Flinders had christened Pumice Stone River, heading
from the Glass House Peaks. Here a singular adventure
occurred:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Scarcely was the anchor let go," writes Mr. Uniacke,
"when we perceived a number of natives, at the distance of about a
mile, advancing rapidly towards the vessel; and on looking at them
with the glass from the masthead, I observed one who appeared much
larger than the rest, and of a lighter colour, being a light
copper, while all the others were black."</blockquote>

<p>This light-coloured native turned out to be a white man, one
Thomas Pamphlet. In company with three others he had left Sydney in
an open boat, to bring cedar from the Five Islands, but, being
driven out to sea by a gale, they had suffered terrible hardships,
being (so he stated) at one time twenty-one days without water,
during which time one man had died of thirst. Finally they were
wrecked on Moreton Island, and had lived with the blacks ever
since&mdash;a period of seven months. Pamphlet informed them that
his two companions were named Finnegan and Parsons, and that they
had started to make for Sydney, overland, but, after going some
fifty miles, he (Pamphlet) returned, and shortly afterwards was
joined by Finnigan, who had quarrelled with Parsons. The latter was
never heard of.</p>

<p>Next day Finnegan turned up, and both he and Pamphlet, agreeing
that at the south end of the bay there was a large river. Messrs.
Oxley and Stirling started the following morning in the whale boat
to look for it; taking Finnegan with them. They found the river,
and pulled up it about fifty miles, being greatly satisfied with
the discovery. Not being provided for a longer trip, Oxley turned
back at a point he named Termination Hill, which he ascended and
from which he obtained a fine view of the further course of the
river. Still haunted by his inland lake theory, and as usual
drawing erroneous deductions, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The nature of the country, and a consideration of all
the circumstances connected with the appearance of the river,
justify me in entertaining a strong belief that the sources of the
river will not be found in mountainous country, but rather that it
flows from some lake, which will prove to be the receptacle of
those interior streams crossed by me during an expedition of
discovery in 1818."</blockquote>

<p>This river Oxley named the Brisbane, and taking with them the
two rescued men, the <i>Mermaid</i> set sail for Sydney, where the
party arrived on December 13th. With regard to the shipwrecked men,
it may be here mentioned that their conviction at the time they
were found was, that they were to the south of Sydney, somewhere in
the neighbourhood of Jarvis Bay.</p>

<p>Oxley's work and his life too were now almost at a close. He
died at Kirkham, his private residence, near Sydney, on the 25th of
May, 1828. He had been essentially a successful explorer, for
although he had not in every case attained the issue aimed at, he
had always brought his men back in safety, and had opened up vast
tracts of new country. [See Appendix.]</p>

<p>The journey made by Messrs. Hume and Hovell across to Port
Phillip has a character of its own, being the first successful trip
undertaken from shore to shore, from the eastern to the southern
coast. The expedition originated from a somewhat wild idea that
entered the head of that unpopular governor Sir Thomas
Brisbane.</p>

<p>Surveyor-General Oxley, not having determined the question as to
whether any large rivers entered the sea between Cape Otway and
Spencer's Gulf, excepting to his own satisfaction, Sir Thomas
Brisbane bit upon the scheme of landing a party of prisoners near
Wilson's Promontory, and inducing them, by the offer of a free
pardon and a land grant, to find their way to Sydney overland; and
that they should have a better chance of eventually turning up, it
was recommended that an experienced bushman should be put in charge
of them. The flattering, if somewhat dangerous, offer of this
position was made to Mr. Hume, who, on consideration, declined it;
he, however, offered to conduct a party from Lake George, then the
outermost station, or nearly so, to Western Port, if the Government
provided necessary assistance. The Government accepted h is offer,
but forgot to provide the assistance. This caused much delay and
vexation, and Mr. Hovell, offering to join the party and find half
the necessary men and cattle, the Government agreed to do something
in the matter. This something amounted to six pack-saddles and
gear, one tent of Parramatta cloth, two tarpaulins, a suit of slop
clothes each for the men, two skeleton charts for tracing their
journey, a few bush utensils, and the following promise: a cash
payment for the hire of the cattle should any important discovery
be made. This money was refused on the return of the party, and Mr.
Hume states that he had even much difficulty in obtaining
tickets-of-leave for the men, and an order to select 1,200 acres of
land for himself. Mr. Hovell was a retired shipmaster, who had been
for some time settled in Australia. Each of the leaders brought
with them three men, so that the strength of the expedition was
eight men in all. They had with them two carts, five bullocks, and
three horses.</p>

<p>On October 14th, 1824, the party left Lake George. On reaching
the Murrumbidgee they found it flooded, and after waiting three
days, and the river continuing the same, an attempt was made to
cross, and by means of the body of a cart rigged up as a punt with
a tarpaulin, they succeeded.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river they found the country broken,
and somewhat difficult to make good progress through, but it was
all well grassed and adapted to grazing purposes. Here, as might
have been anticipated, they soon had to leave their carts behind,
and pack their cattle for the remainder of their journey. Following
the Murrumbidgee, after a short distance they left it for a
south-west course, which still led them through hills and valleys
rich with good grass and running water.</p>

<p>On November 8th, they were destined to enjoy a sight never
before witnessed by white men in Australia. Ascending a range, in
order to get a view of the country ahead of them, they suddenly
came in front of snowcapped mountains. There, under the brilliant
sun of an Australian summer's day, rose lofty peaks that might have
found a fitting home in some far polar clime, covered as they were
for nearly one-fourth of their height with glistening snow.</p>

<p>Skirting this range, which was called the Australian Alps, the
travellers, after eight days wandering through the spurs of the
lofty mountains they had just seen, came on a fine flowing river,
which Mr. Hume named after his father the "Hume," destined to be
afterwards called the Murray when visited lower down.</p>

<p>Failing to find a ford, a makeshift boat was constructed by the
aid of the useful tarpaulin, and the passage of the Hume safely
accomplished. Still passing through good available country watered
by fine flowing streams, on the 24th they crossed the Ovens River,
and on the 3rd of December they came to another river, which they
called the Hovell (now the Goulburn), and on the 16th of the same
month reached the sea shore, near where Geelong now stands. Two
days afterwards they commenced their return, and on the 18th
January arrived at Lake George.</p>

<p>This exploration had a great and lasting bearing on the
extension of Australian settlement. A few years after one of the
highest authorities then in the colony had deemed the western
interior, beyond a certain limit, unfitted for human habitation;
and expressed his opinion that the monotonous flats over which he
vainly looked for any rise, extended almost to the sea
coast&mdash;snow-clad mountains, feeding innumerable streams, were
discovered to the south of his track.</p>

<p>The successful and arduous expedition led by the young
native-born explorer, had the twofold effect of exposing Oxley's
fallacies, and teaching a lesson of caution to future explorers not
to indulge hastily in general condemnation. This lesson, however,
has not been heeded; the history of Australian exploration being a
history of conclusions drawn one year, to be falsified the next.
Hume's journey to Port Phillip at once added to the
British-Colonial Empire millions of acres of arable land watered by
never-failing rivers, with a climate calculated to foster the
growth of almost any species of fruit or grain.</p>

<p>It is a pity that in concluding the review of an expedition,
fraught with so much benefit to the colony, and carried out with so
much courage, hardihood, and facility of resource. that it cannot
also be said, and marked with the same cheerful spirit that
pervaded those of Oxley's, but unfortunately, the evil feeling of
jealously that would arise from the presence of two leaders, showed
plainly throughout in petty and undignified squabbles, which, in
after days, led to paper warfare between the two explorers. It is
painful, if amusing, to read of the disagreement as to their course
in very sight of the lately discovered Australian Alps, and how, on
agreeing to separate and divide the outfit, it was proposed to cut
the tent in half, and the only frying-pan was broken by both
parties pulling at it.</p>

<p>Thomas Boyd, the only survivor of the party in 1883, who was
then eighty-six years old, was the first white man to cross the
Murray, which he did, swimming it with a line in his mouth. In the
year named he signed a document, giving the credit of taking the
party through in safety to Hume. Boyd himself was one of the most
active members of the expedition, and always to the front when
there was any work to be done.</p>

<p>The training that Hume received in this, and his former journey,
admirably qualified him to become the companion of Sturt in his
first expedition when he discovered the other great artery of the
Murray system, the Darling. The young explorer was thus singularly
fortunate in having his name connected with the discovery of two of
the most important rivers in Australia. In the trip just narrated
he and his companion, Hovell, had arrested the hasty conclusion
that was being formed as to the aridity of the interior. The result
of their expedition held out high hopes for any future explorer,
and the report they brought in was afterwards fully confirmed by
Major Mitchell.</p>

<p>In 1824, in consequence of the favourable report of Surveyor
Oxley, a penal settlement was formed at Moreton Bay, but it was
speedily removed to a better site on the Brisbane River, where the
capital of Queensland now stands. The natives bestowed upon the
abandoned settlement the name of "Umpie Bong," [Literally, dead
houses] which name is still preserved as Humpybong.</p>

<p>In 1825 Major Lockyer made a long boat excursion up the Brisbane
River, and the stream being somewhat swollen by floods, he was able
to penetrate, according to his own account, nearly one hundred and
fifty miles.</p>

<p>He was much taken with the promising nature of the country, both
on the Brisbane and its tributary, the Bremer, and great hopes,
happily fulfilled, were entertained of the success of the new
settlement. During this year Mr. Cunningham had undertaken another
journey to Liverpool Plains. Threading the pass he had formerly
discovered and named Pandora's Pass, he crossed the plains, and
ascended and examined the table land to the north, returning to
Bathurst.</p>

<p>In 1827 this explorer, whose industry never flagged, started on
the most eventful trip he ever made, destined to considerably
affect the immediate progress of the new colony established at
Moreton Bay. On the 30th of April he left Segenhoe Station, on the
Upper Hunter, and on crossing Oxley's 1818 track to Port Macquarie,
at once entered on the unexplored northern region. On the 19th May,
after traversing a good deal of unpromising country, a fertile
valley was entered, which led the travellers on to the banks of the
Gwydir River, one of Cunningham's most important discoveries. He
next found and named the Dumaresque River, and finally emerged on
the beautiful plateau, thenceforth known as the Darling Downs,
where the Condamine River received its name, after the Governor's
aide-de-camp. Cunningham's description of this tract of pastoral
country is very glowing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Deep ponds, supported by streams from the highlands
immediately to the eastward, extend along their central lower
flats. The lower grounds thus permanently watered present flats
which furnish an almost inexhaustible range of cattle pasture at
all seasons of the year; the grass and herbage generally exhibiting
in the depth of winter an extreme luxuriance of growth. From these
central grounds rise downs of a rich black and dry soil, and very
ample surface; and as they furnish abundance of grass and are
conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the reach of those
floods which take place on the flats in a season of rain, they
constitute a sound and valuable sheep pasture."</blockquote>

<p>Here Cunningham halted for some time, with the view of
ascertaining the practicability of a passage across the range to
Moreton Bay.</p>

<p>In exploring the mountains immediately above the tents of the
encampment, a remarkably excavated part of the main range was
discovered, which appeared likely to prove available as a pass.
Upon examination, the gap was found to be rugged and broken,
partially blocked with fallen masses of rocks, and overgrown by
scrub and jungle. Beyond these impediments, which could soon be
removed, the gap now known as Cunningham's Gap was apparently
available as affording a descent to the lower coast lands.
Relinquishing any further attempts for the present, either through
the mountains or to the western interior, Cunningham returned to
the Hunter, crossing and re-crossing his outward track. He was
absent oil this expedition thirteen weeks.</p>

<p>The following year the discoverer of the Darling Downs,
accompanied by his old companion, Charles Frazer, Colonial
Botanist, proceeded by sea to Moreton Bay with the intention of
starting from the settlement and connecting with his camp on the
Darling Downs by way of Cunningham's Gap. In this attempt he was
also accompanied by the Commandant, Captain Logan. The party
followed up the Logan River, and partly ascended Mount Lindsay, a
lofty and remarkable mountain on the Dividing Range. They were,
however, unsuccessful in finding the Gap on this occasion.
Cunningham, however, immediately started from Limestone Station on
the Bremer, now the town of Ipswich, and this time was quite
successful. On the 24th Of August he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"About one o'clock we passed a mile to the southward of our last
position, and, entering a valley, we pitched our tents within three
miles of the gap we now suspected to be the Pass of last year's
journey.<br>
<br>
"It being early in the afternoon, I sent one of my people (who,
having been one of my party on that long tour, knew well the
features of the country lying to the westward of the Dividing
Range) to trace a series of forest ridges, which appeared to lead
directly up to the foot of the hollow-back of the range.<br>
<br>
"To my utmost gratification he returned at dusk, having traced
the ridge about two and a-half miles to the foot of the Dividing
Range, whence he ascended into the Pass and, from a grassy head
immediately above it, beheld the extensive country lying west of
the Main Range. He recognised Darling and Canning Downs, patches of
Peel's Plains, and several remarkable points of the forest hills on
that side, fully identifying this hollow-back with the pass
discovered last year at the head of Miller's Valley,
notwithstanding its very different appearance when viewed from the
eastern country."</blockquote>

<p>The next day, accompanied by one man, Cunningham ascended the
pass that bears his name. Following the ridges, they arrived in
about two and three-quarter miles to the foot of the Gap.</p>

<blockquote>
"Immediately the summit of the pass appeared broad before us,
bounded on each side by most stupendous heads, towering at least
two thousand feet above it.<br>
<br>
"Here the difficulties of the Pass commenced. We had now
penetrated to the actual foot of the Pass without the smallest
difficulty, it now remained to ascend by a steep slope to the level
of its entrance. This slope is occupied by a very close wood, in
which red cedar, sassafras, palms, and other ornamental
inter-tropical trees are frequent. Through this shaded wood lye
penetrated, climbing up a steep bank of a very rich loose earth, in
which large fragments of a very compact rock are embedded. At
length we gained the foot of a wall of bare rock, which we found
stretching from the southward of the Pass.<br>
<br>
"This face of naked rock we perceived (by tracing its course
northerly) gradually to fall to the common level, so that, without
the smallest difficulty, and to my utmost surprise, we found
ourselves in the highest part of the Pass, having fully ascertained
the extent of the difficult part, from the entrance into the wood
to this point, not to exceed four hundred yards."</blockquote>

<p>In this comparatively easy manner was the main range crossed,
and access at once obtained from the coastal districts to the rich
inland slope&mdash;a startling result when compared with the years
of labour and baffled hope wasted on the Blue Mountains before
victory was won.</p>

<p>In the following year (1829) Cunningham went on his last
expedition, to the source of the Brisbane River, and this work
concluded ten years of constant and unceasing labour in the cause
of exploration. He died in Sydney ten years afterwards, on the 27th
of June, leaving behind an undying name, both as a botanist and
ardent explorer. During his own travels, and whilst sailing with
Captain King, he had seen more of the continent than any man then
living.</p>

<p>Captain Charles Sturt, of the 39th Regiment! What visions are
conjured up when this name comes on the scene! Cracked and gaping
plains, desolate, desert and abandoned of life, scorched beneath a
lurid sun of burning fire, waterless, hopeless, relentless, and
accursed: that is the picture he draws of the great interior. He
had followed up Oxley's footsteps and exposed the fallacies into
which that explorer had fallen, and erred just as egregiously
himself. True, like Oxley, he was the sport of the seasons. Oxley
had followed the rivers down when, year after year, the regular
rainfall had made them navigable for his boats, and had finally
lost them in oceans of reeds. Sturt came when the land was smitten
with drought, and the rivers had dwindled down to the tiniest
trickle.</p>

<blockquote>"In the creeks weeds had grown and withered, and grown again and
young saplings were now rising in their beds, nourished by the
moisture that still remained; but the large forest trees were
drooping and many were dead. The emus, with outstretched necks,
gasping for breath, searched the channels of the rivers for water,
in vain; and the native dog, so thin that he could hardly walk,
seemed to implore some merciful hand to dispatch him."</blockquote>

<p>Such was Sturt's description of the state of the country.</p>

<p>In 1828, the year that witnessed his first expedition, no rain
had fallen for two years, and it seemed as though it would never
fall again. The thoughts of the colonists turned to that shallow
ocean of reeds to the westward wherein Oxley had lost the
Macquarie, and it was thought that now would be the time to verify
its existence or find out what lay beyond. Captain Sturt was
appointed to take command, and with him went Hamilton Hume, who had
so successfully crossed to Port Phillip. The party consisted,
besides, of two soldiers and eight prisoners of the crown, two of
whom were to return with dispatches. They had with them eight
riding and seven pack horses, two draught and eight pack bullocks.
They had also with them a small boat rigged up on a wheeled
carriage.</p>

<p>It would be uninteresting to follow the party over the already
known ground to Mount Harris where Oxley had camped in 1818; this
place Sturt and his men reached on the 20th December, 1828.</p>

<blockquote>"As soon as the camp was fixed, Mr. Hume and I rode to Mount
Harris, over ground subject to flood and covered for the most part
by the polygonum, being too anxious to defer our examination of the
neighbourhood even a few hours. Nearly ten years had elapsed since
Mr. Oxley pitched his tents under the smallest of the two hills
into which Mount Harris is broken. There was no difficulty in
hitting upon his position. The trenches that had been cut round the
tents were still perfect, and the marks of the fire places
distinguishable; while the trees in the neighbourhood had been
felled, and round about them the staves of casks, and a few tent
pegs were scattered. Mr. Oxley had selected a place at some
distance from the river on account of its then swollen state. I
looked upon it from the same ground and could not discern the
waters in the channel, so much had they fallen below their ordinary
level. On the summit of the great eminence which we ascended, there
remained the half-burnt planks of a boat, some clenched and rusty
nails, and an old trunk; but my search for the bottle Mr. Oxley had
left was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
"A reflection arose to my mind, on examining these decaying
vestiges of a former expedition, whether I should be more fortunate
than the leader of it, and how far I should be enabled to penetrate
beyond the point which had conquered his perseverance. Only a week
before I left Sydney I had followed Mr. Oxley to the tomb. A man of
uncommon quickness and of great ability. The task of following up
his discoveries was not less enviable than arduous; but, arrived at
that point at which his journey may be said to have terminated and
mine only to commence, I knew not how soon I should be obliged,
like him, to retreat from the marshes and exhalations of so
depressed a country. My eye turned instinctively to the north-west,
and the view extended over an apparently endless forest. I could
trace the river line of trees by their superior height, but saw no
appearance of reeds save the few that grew on the banks of the
stream."</blockquote>

<p>Satisfied, after consultation with his companion Hume, that
there was no obstacle to their onward march, they left their
position, intending, as Sturt says, "to close with the
marshes."</p>

<p>The night of the first day found them camped amongst the reeds,
which they came upon sooner than they expected, and the next day
they halted for the purpose of preparing the dispatches for the
Governor. On the morning of the 26th, the journey was resumed, the
two messengers leaving for Bathurst, the rest proceeding onward
until checked by finding themselves in the great body of the marsh,
which spread in boundless extent around them.</p>

<p>"It was evidently," says the leader, "lower than the ground on
which we stood; we had, therefore, a complete view of the whole
expanse, and there was a dreariness and desolation pervading the
scene which strengthened as we gazed upon it."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, an advance with the main body of the
party was considered unwise, and it was determined to launch the
boat, and try and follow the course of the river, whilst a
simultaneous attempt was made to penetrate the reed bed to the
north. Accordingly Sturt, with two men, started in the boat, and
Hume and two more struck north.</p>

<p>Sturt's boating expedition came very quickly to a close. In the
afternoon of the day he started:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"...the channel which had promised so well, without any change
in its breadth or depth, ceased altogether, and while we were yet
lost in astonishment at so abrupt a termination of it the boat
grounded."</blockquote>

<p>All search was fruitless, and mysteriously and completely
baffled as Oxley had been, so was his successor, and there was
nothing for it but to return to camp.</p>

<p>Hume had been more successful. He reported finding a serpentine
sheet of water to the northward, which he did not doubt was the
channel of the river. He had pushed on, but was checked by another
of the seemingly inevitable marshes.</p>

<p>On the 28th the camp was shifted to this lagoon, and the boat
was launched once more; without result. The new-found channel was
soon lost in reeds and shallows. Forced to halt again, Hume went to
the north-east to scout, and Sturt went north-west, each
accompanied, as before, by two men. They left the camp on the last
day of the year.</p>

<p>After sunset on the first day, Sturt struck a creek of
considerable size leading northerly, having good water in its bed.
The next day, after passing through alternate plain and brush for
eighteen miles, a second creek was found, inferior to the first
both in size and the quality of the water; it too ran northerly.
Crossing this creek, after a short halt, they travelled through
stony ridges and open forest, and at night camped on the edge of a
waterless plain, after a hot and thirsty ride; here one of the men,
noticing the flight of a pigeon, found a small puddle of rain water
that just sufficed them. Next day, the country steadily improving
in appearance, they made west by south for an isolated mountain
with perpendicular sides, from the top of which Sturt trusted to
see something hopeful ahead. He was disappointed, the country was
monotonous and level, and no sign of a river could be seen. They
camped that night at a small swamp, and next morning Sturt turned
back, like Oxley, coming to the conclusion that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"Yet upon the whole, the space I traversed is unlikely to become
the haunt of civilised man, or will become so in isolated spots, as
a chain of connection to a more fertile country; if such a country
exist to the westward."</blockquote>

<p>Hume had not returned when the party reached the main camp on
the 5th of January; the next day he made his appearance. He
reported having travelled, on various courses, about thirty miles
N.N.W. over an indifferent country. He had anticipated meeting with
the Castlereagh, but had been forced to conclude that that river
had taken a more northerly course than Mr. Oxley had supposed. He
went westward, and across fine far-stretching plains, but saw no
sign of the Macquarie River having re-formed, crossing nothing but
small 'reeks or chains of ponds.</p>

<p>Most of the men, including Hume, complaining of sickness, he
camp was shifted four miles to the north, on to a chain of ponds
reported by Hume. This creek they followed down, when it
disappointed them by disappearing in the marsh. Without water, they
continued skirting the low country until fatigue compelled them to
stop, when, by digging shallow wells in the reeds, they obtained a
small supply. From here they made their way by a different route to
the hill that had terminated Sturt's late trip, and which he had
christened Oxley's Tableland. Here they rested a few days, and
Sturt and Hume, with two men, made another excursion westward, but
without result.</p>

<p>Their only resource now was to make north to a creek that they
had followed down on their way to Oxley's tableland, and see where
it would lead them.</p>

<p>On the 31st January they came upon this creek, which was called
by them New Year's Creek, now the Bogan, and the next day they
suddenly found themselves on the brink of a noble river:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"The party drew up upon a bank that was from forty to forty-five
feet above the level of the stream. The channel of the river was
from seventy to eighty yards broad, and enclosed an unbroken sheet
of water, evidently very deep, and literally covered with pelicans
and other wild fowl. Our surprise and delight may better be
imagined than described. Our difficulties seemed to be at an end,
for here was a river that promised to reward all our exertions, and
which appeared every moment to increase in importance to our
imaginations. Coming from the N.E. and flowing to the S.W., it had
a capacity of channel that proved that we were as far from its
source as from its termination. The paths of the natives on either
side of it were like trodden roads, and the trees that overhung it
were of beautiful and gigantic growth.<br>
<br>
"The banks were too precipitous to 'allow of our watering the
cattle, but the men descended eagerly to quench their thirst, which
a powerful sun had contributed to increase; nor shall I ever forget
the cry of amazement that followed their doing so, or the looks of
terror and disappointment with which they called out to inform me
that the water was so salt as to be unfit to drink. This was indeed
too true. On tasting it, I found it extremely nauseous, and
strongly impregnated with salt, being apparently a mixture of sea
and fresh water...Our hopes were annihilated at the moment of their
apparent realisation. The cup of joy was dashed out of our hands
before we had time to raise it to our lips."</blockquote>

<p>Finding fresh feed lower down the river, the party halted for
the benefit of the cattle, who, unable to drink the water, soaked
their bodies in it. Meantime, although the tracks of the natives
were abundant, they looked in vain for any of them. Fortunately,
that night Hume found a pond of fresh water, and the party were
refreshed once more. The phenomena of the salt river was puzzling
to Sturt, though too familiar now to excite wonder; the long
continued drought having lowered the river so that the brine
springs in the banks preponderated over the fresh water, was of
course the explanation, and it is a common characteristic of inland
watercourses. The size of the river and the saltness of its water,
however, partly convinced Sturt that he was near its confluence
with an inland sea; so for six days they moved slowly down the
river, finding, however, no change in its formation, until the
discovery of saline springs in the bank convinced the leader that
the saltness was of local origin.</p>

<p>Leaving the party encamped at a small pool of fresh water, Sturt
and Hume pushed ahead to look for more, but without success. Before
leaving they were startled, one afternoon, by a loud report like a
distant cannon, for which they could in noway account, as the sky
was clear and without a cloud. [These strange reports have since
been frequently heard, often at the same moment, at places more
than a hundred miles apart. The cause is generally ascribed to
atmospheric disturbances.]</p>

<p>The advance was now checked, no fresh water could be found on
ahead, and their animals were weak and exhausted. Sturt christened
the river the Darling, and gave the order to retreat.</p>

<p>As they again approached Mount Harris on the Macquarie, where
they expected to find a relief party with fresh supplies, fears
began to be entertained regarding the safety of those who might be
awaiting them at the depôt. The reed beds were in flames in all
parts, and the few natives they met displayed a guilty timidity,
and one was observed with a jacket in his possession. Their fears
were, however, fortunately vain, the natives had made one attempt
to surprise the camp, but it had been frustrated, and the relief
party had now been some three weeks awaiting the return of the
explorers.</p>

<p>Sturt rested for some days, during which time Hume made a short
western trip.. to the south of the marsh land. He reported that for
thirty miles the country was superior to anything they had yet
seen, and exceedingly well watered; beyond that distance the plains
and brush of the remote interior again resumed their sway.</p>

<p>On the 7th March the party struck camp and made for the
Castlereagh, the relief going back to Bathurst. On the 10th they
reached the Castlereagh, and found it apparently without a drop of
water in its bed. From here downwards the old harassing hunt for
water commenced once more, and as they descended the river they
were further puzzled by the intricate windings of its course and
the number of channels that intersected the depressed country they
were travelling through. On the 29th they again struck the Darling,
ninety miles above the spot where they had discovered it:</p>

<blockquote>"This singular river still preserved its character so strikingly
that it was impossible not to have recognised it in a moment. The
same steep banks and lofty timber, the same deep reaches, alive
with fish, were here visible as when we left it. A hope naturally
arose to our minds, that if it was unchanged in other respects, it
might have lost the saltness that rendered its waters unfit for
use; but in this we were disappointed-even its waters continued the
same."</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately the adventurers were not this time in such unhappy
straits for water as before, so that the disappointment was less
intense. Knowing what they might expect if they followed the
Darling down south, the party at once halted. It was evident that
to the east and north-east, the rigorous drought had put its mark
on the land, from the fact that large bodies of natives driven in
from that direction were congregated round the few permanent waters
left. A reconnoitring expedition across the Darling to the N.W. was
accordingly determined on, to see if any advance into the interior
was possible, and after a camp had been formed Sturt and Hume
started on the quest. No encouragement to proceed resulted. By four
p.m. they found themselves on a plain that stretched far away and
bounded the horizon.</p>

<blockquote>
"It was dismally brown, a few trees only served to mark the
distance. Up one of the highest I sent Hopkins on, who reported
that he could not see the end of it, and that all around looked
blank and desolate. It is a singular fact that during the whole day
we had not seen a drop of water or a blade of grass.<br>
<br>
"To have stopped where we were would, therefore, have been
impossible; to have advanced would probably have been ruin. Had
there been one favourable circumstance to have encouraged me with
the hope of success I would have proceeded. Had we picked up a
stone, as indicating our approach to high land, I would have gone
on; or had there been a break in the country, or even a change in
the vegetation; but we had left all traces of the natives behind
us, and this seemed a desert they never entered&mdash;that not even
a bird inhabited. I could not encourage a hope of success, and
therefore gave up the point, not from want of means, but a
conviction of the inutility of any further efforts. If there is any
blame to be attached to the measure it is I who am in fault; but
none who had not like me traversed the interior at such a season
would believe the state of the country over which I had wandered.
During the short interval I had been out, I had seen rivers cease
to flow before me and sheets of water disappear, and had it not
been for a merciful Providence should, ere reaching the Darling,
have been overwhelmed by misfortune.<br>
<br>
"I am giving no false picture of the reality. So long had the
drought continued that the vegetable kingdom was almost
annihilated, and minor vegetation had disappeared."</blockquote>

<p>Once more the order to retreat from the inhospitable Darling was
given, and the weary march home recommenced. On their way they
traced and followed a defined channel, or depression, formerly
crossed by Hume, and ascertained it to be the outflow of the
Macquarie Marshes. On the 7th of April, 1829, they reached Mount
Harris.</p>

<p>The mystery of the Macquarie was now, to a certain extent,
cleared up, but there still remained another riddle to solve in the
course and outlet of the Darling. Sturt, the discoverer of this
river, was destined to find the answer to this problem as well.</p>

<p>We have now traced the gradual extension of exploration to the
westward, and seen a river system growing up, as it were, piece by
piece, as the result of these expeditions; it may, therefore, be as
well to continue to follow up Captain Sturt's expeditions, and note
how the Murray and its tributary streams were gradually elaborated,
before touching upon events at this time occurring afar on the
south-west coast of the continent.</p>

<p>The desire to ascertain the course of the Darling naturally
became a subject of great interest so soon as the result of Captain
Sturt's expedition was known; and the Macquarie and Lachlan rivers
having failed to afford a means of reaching the interior, it was
determined to try the Morumbidgee. The fact that this river derived
its supply from the highest known mountains, and was independent,
to a large extent, of the periodical rainfall, was a great
inducement to hope for success.</p>

<p>Almost exactly a year after he had started on his journey down
the Macquarie, Captain Sturt left Sydney, on his Morumbidgee
expedition, on the 3rd of November, 1829.</p>

<p>Hume, was not, on this occasion, able to accompany the party,
his own affairs on his farm needing his attention; doubtless in
spirit he was often with them, and it would have been but fitting
had the discoverer of the Murray or Hume, been one of the party to
first trace its downward course. In Hume's place went George
M'Leay, the son of the then Colonial Secretary, Alexander M'Leay;
with them also went Harris, Hopkinson, and Fraser, members of the
Macquarie expedition,</p>

<p>To our modern eyes the appearance of the troop that marched out
of Sydney, early that summer morning, would have looked strange
indeed.</p>

<blockquote>"At a quarter before seven the party filed through the turnpike
gate, and thus commenced its journey with the greatest regularity.
I have the scene even at this distance of time, vividly impressed
upon my mind, and I have no doubt the kind friend who was with me
on the occasion bears it as strongly on his recollection. My
servant Harris, who had shared my wanderings, and had continued in
my service for eighteen years, led the advance with his companion
Hopkinson; nearly abreast of them the eccentric Frazer stalked
along, wholly lost in thought. The two former had laid aside their
military habits, and had substituted the broad-brimmed hat, and the
bushman's dress in their place, but it was impossible to guess how
Frazer intended to protect himself from the heat or damp, so little
were his habiliments suited for the occasion. He had his gun over
his shoulder, and his double shot belt as full as it could be of
shot, although there was not a chance of his expending a grain
during the day. Some dogs Mr. Maxwell had kindly sent me followed
close at his heels, as if they knew his interest in them, and they
really seemed as if they were aware that they were about to
exchange their late confinement for the freedom of the woods. The
whole of these formed a kind of advanced guard. At some distance in
the rear the drays moved slowly along, on one of which rode the
black boy; Robert Harris, whom I had appointed to superintend the
animals generally, kept his place near the horses, and the heavy
Clayton, my carpenter, brought up the rear."</blockquote>

<p>It will be needless to follow the progress of the party through
the settled districts that now extended to the banks of the
Morumbidgee: on the 27th, we find them preparing to start from Mr.
Whaby's station, the last outpost of civilization. From thence they
followed the river down, maintaining constant and friendly
intercourse with the natives on the banks. For some time they
passed through rich available country, and at one point they made a
slight excursion to the north to connect with Oxley's most
southerly limit; although they did not actually verify it, Sturt
was of the opinion that they were within at least twenty miles of
the range seen by Oxley. Still following the river they now found
its course leading them amongst the plains and flat country with
which they were so well acquainted, and naturally travelled in the
constant dread of the stream conducting them to the lame and
impotent conclusions of the Macquarie and Lachlan.</p>

<blockquote>"Our route was over as melancholy a tract as ever was
travelled. The plains to the N. and N.W. bounded the horizon; not a
tree of any kind was visible upon them. It was equally open to the
south, and it appeared as if the river was decoying us into a
desert, there to leave us in difficulty and in
distress."</blockquote>

<p>Sturt now was constantly haunted with the thought of once more
finding himself baffled and perplexed in some vast region of
flooded country, without a defined system of channels. Every time
he looked at the river he imagined that it had fallen off in
appearance, feeling certain that the flooded spaces over which he
was travelling would soon be succeeded by a country overgrown with
reeds. The flats of polygonum stretched away to the N.W., and to
the S., and the soil itself bore testimony to its flooded origin.
Some natives here met with spoke of the <i>Colare</i>, a name which
Sturt had beard before, and which he took to mean the Lachlan, from
the direction in which the blacks pointed. These men indicated that
they were but one day's journey from it. Sturt and M'Leay,
therefore, rode to the north to examine the country; they found a
creek of considerable size, and from its appearance and the nature
of the surrounding flats, deemed it to be a similar channel from
the Lachlan marshes to the Morumbidgee, as the one Sturt and Hume
had formerly noticed to the north, leading from the great marsh of
the Macquarie to the Darling. In point of fact they actually
crossed the Lachlan, and went some distance beyond it, passing
close to Oxley's lowest camp, as the natives afterwards testified
to Major Mitchell.</p>

<p>The extract from the Major's journal bearing on the subject runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The natives further informed me that three men on
horseback, who had canoes (boats) on the Murrumbidgee, had visited
the Lachlan thereabouts since, and that after crossing it, and
going a little way beyond, they had returned."</blockquote>

<p>Sturt mentioned seeing the fires of the natives during this
trip, but he did not see them, although it was evident that they
had a good look at him.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December, it seemed that their gloomiest hopes
were to be realised. Traversing plains like those described before,
Sturt says:</p>

<blockquote>"The wheels of the drays sank up to their axle-trees,
and the horses above their fetlocks at every step. The fields of
polygonum spread on every side of us, like a dark sea, and the only
green object within range of our vision was the river line of
trees. In several instances the force of both teams was put to one
dray, to extricate it from the bed into which it had sunk, and the
labour was considerably increased from the nature of the weather.
The wind was blowing as if through a furnace, from the N.N.E., and
the dust was flying in clouds, so as to render it almost
suffocating to remain exposed to it. This was the only occasion
upon which we felt the hot winds in the interior. We were, about
noon, endeavouring to gain a point of a wood at which I expected to
come upon the river again, but it was impossible for the teams to
reach it without assistance. I therefore sent M'Leay forward with
orders to unload the pack animals as soon as he should make the
river, and send them back to help the teams. He had scarcely been
separated from me twenty minutes, when one of the men came
galloping back to inform me that no river was to be
found&mdash;that the country beyond the woods was covered with
reeds as far as the eye could reach, and that Mr. M'Leay had sent
him back for instructions. This intelligence stunned me for a
moment or two, and I am sure its effect upon the men was very
great. They had unexpectedly arrived at a part of the interior
similar to one they held in dread, and conjured up a thousand
difficulties and privations. I desired the man to recall Mr.
M'Leay; and, after gaining the wood, moved outside of it at right
angles to my former course, and reached the river, after a day of
severe toil and exposure. at half-past five. The country, indeed,
bore every resemblance to that around the marshes of the Macquarie,
but I was too weary to make any further effort; indeed it was too
late for one to undertake anything until the morning."</blockquote>

<p>The following day, accompanied by his friend, Sturt proceeded to
examine the river. He found it still running strong, without any
sign of diminution in its flow, but the reedy flats were so dense
and thick that no passage for the teams was practicable. At noon
the leader halted, and announced his intention of returning to
camp. He had come to the determination to construct the whaleboat
he had with him in sections, to send the teams back, and, with six
men and Mr. M'Leay, to start down the river, and follow it wherever
it went; whether ever to return again or not was for the future to
determine.</p>

<p>Clayton, the carpenter, was at once set to work upon the boat,
or boats, for a tree was felled, a sawpit rigged up, and a small
boat half the size of the whaleboat built. Everybody worked hard,
and in seven days the boats were afloat, moored alongside a
temporary wharf, ready for loading. Six men were then chosen to
form the crew, who were about to undertake one of the most eventful
and important voyages in Australia's history. They were Clayton,
the carpenter, Mulholland and Macnamee, the three soldiers, Harris,
Hopkinson and Fraser, the leader, and M'Leay&mdash;eight in all.
The remainder of the party, under Robert Harris, were to remain
stationary one week, in case of accident, then to proceed to
Goulburn Plains and await instructions from Sydney.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1830, the voyagers started, towing the
smaller boat, the men all in high spirits at the wide prospect of
adventure before them.</p>

<p>Going with the stream they made rapid progress, using only two
oars, but the first day did not suffice to carry them clear of the
reeds, in fact, at night when they landed to camp, they could
scarcely find room to pitch their tents. On the second day, an
accident happened to the skiff they were towing; she struck on a
log, and immediately sank with all the valuable cargo she carried.
Two days were spent in recovering the things, as the boat had gone
down in twelve feet of water, and during the time they were so
employed, the blacks robbed the camp of many articles.</p>

<p>Once more on the move, they found the river still winding its
way through a flat expanse of reeds, and threatening to end as the
other rivers had done. On the afternoon of the next day a change
for the better took place; the reeds on both sides of the river
terminated, and the country became more elevated, and bore the
appearance of open forest pasture land; a tributary creek of
considerable size joined the river from the S.E., and the spirits
of the voyagers rose again. More tributaries now came in from the
south-east, and the dangers of navigation increased, the river
being full of snags and fallen timber, and the utmost care had to
be used to keep the boat clear. On the second day of this
distressing work, they were destined to meet with a surprise.</p>

<blockquote>"About one we again started. The men looked anxiously ahead, for
the singular change in the river had impressed on them the idea
that we were approaching its termination, or near some adventure.
On a sudden the river took a general southern direction, but, in
its tortuous course, swept round to every point of the compass with
the greatest irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down
its gloomy and contracted banks, and in such a moment of
excitement, had little time to pay attention to the country through
which we were passing. It was. however, observed that chalybeate
springs were numerous close to the water's edge. At three p.m.,
Hopkinson called out that we were approaching a junction, and in
less than a minute afterwards we were hurried into a broad and
noble river.<br>
<br>
"It is impossible to describe the effect of so instantaneous a
change upon us. The boats were allowed to drift along at pleasure,
and such was the force with which we had been shot out of the
Morumbidgee, that we were carried nearly to the bank opposite its
embouchure, whilst we continued to gaze in silent astonishment on
the capacious channel we had entered; and when we looked for that
by which we had been led into it, we could hardly believe that the
insignificant gap that presented itself to us was indeed the
termination of the beautiful and noble stream whose course we had
thus successfully followed."</blockquote>

<p>Sturt had now succeeded beyond his hopes&mdash;his bold
adventure had been rewarded even sooner than he could have
expected. He felt assured that at last he floated on the stream
destined to bear him to the sea. The key to the river system of the
south-east portion of the continent was in his grasp, and all
former fallacies and fanciful theories were answered for good. The
voyage down the Murray, as this river was named, after Sir George
Murray, then the bead of the Colonial Department, now continued
free from some of the difficulties that had beset them in the
Morumbidgee. The natives again made their appearance, and were
constantly seen every day, some betraying great timidity, others
appearing more curious than frightened. Four of these natives
accompanied them for two days, during which time the explorers
narrowly suffered wreck in a rapid in the river.</p>

<p>They now approached the confluence of the Darling, although of
course they were not then able to verify the supposition that it
was their old friend, and at this point one of the most singular
adventures ever narrated in the intercourse with native tribes
happened.</p>

<p>The wind was fair, and with the sail set, the boat was making
rapid way when, at the termination of a long reach, they observed a
line of magnificent trees, of green and dense foliage. A large
number of blacks were here assembled, and apparently with no
friendly intentions, armed, painted, and shouting defiance. Anxious
to avert hostilities, Sturt steered straight for them, thinking to
make friends; but when almost too close to avoid a meeting, he
could see that the matter was serious. The blacks had their spears
poised for throwing, and their women were behind with a fresh
supply. The sail was lowered and the helm put about, and the boat
passed down the stream, the natives running along the bank, keeping
pace with them, shouting and attempting to take aim.</p>

<p>To add to their danger the river shoaled rapidly, and a sandspit
appeared ahead, projecting nearly two thirds of the way across the
channel, and on this spit the blacks now gathered with tremendous
uproar, evidently determined to make an assault on the boat as she
ran the gauntlet through the narrow passage. Amongst the four
blacks who had accompanied them for two days was one of superior
personal strength and stature. These men had left the camp of the
whites the night before, and it was believing in their presence in
the crowd before them that led Sturt to disregard the hostile
demonstrations.</p>

<p>A battle now seemed inevitable. Arms were distributed to the
crew, and orders given how to act when the emergency arose.</p>

<p>We will let Sturt tell his own story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The men assured me they would follow my instructions, and thus
prepared, having already lowered the sail, we drifted onwards with
the current. As we neared the sand-bank, I stood up and made signs
to the natives to desist, but without success. I took up my gun,
therefore, and cocking it, had already brought it down to a level;
a few seconds more would have closed the life of the nearest
savage. The distance was too trifling for me to doubt the fatal
effects of the discharge; for I was determined to take deadly aim,
in hopes that the fall of one man might save the lives of many. But
at the very moment when my hand was on the trigger, and my eye was
along the barrel, my purpose was checked by M'Leay, who called to
me that another party of blacks had made their appearance upon the
left bank of the river. Turning round, I observed four men at the
top of their speed. The foremost of them, as soon as he got ahead
of the boat, threw himself from a considerable height into the
water. He struggled across the channel to the sandbank, and in an
incredibly short space of time stood in front of the savage,
against whom my aim had been directed. Seizing him by the throat,
he pushed him backwards, and forcing all who were in the water upon
the bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation that
were exceedingly striking. At one moment pointing to the boat, at
another shaking his clenched hand in the faces of the most forward,
and stamping with passion on the sand; his voice, that was at first
distinct, was lost in hoarse murmurs. Two of the four natives
remained on the left bank of the river, the third followed his
leader (who proved to be the remarkable savage I have previously
noticed) to the scene of action. The reader will imagine our
feelings on this occasion; it is impossible to describe them. We
were so wholly lost in interest at the scene that was passing, that
the boat was allowed to drift at pleasure.<br>
<br>
"We were again aroused to action by the boat suddenly striking
upon a shoal, which reached from one side of the river to the
other. To jump out and push her into deep water was but the work of
a moment with the men, and it was just as she floated again that
our attention was withdrawn to a new and beautiful stream, coming
apparently from the north...A party of about seventy blacks were
upon the right bank of the newly discovered river, and I thought
that by landing amongst them I might make a diversion in favour of
our late guest, and in this I succeeded. The blacks no sooner
observed that we had landed than curiosity took the place of anger.
All wrangling ceased, and they came swimming over to us like a
parcels of seals...It was not until after we had returned to the
boat, and had surveyed the multitude on the sloping bank above us
that we became fully aware of the extent of our danger, and of the
almost miraculous intervention of Providence in our favour. There
could not have been less than six hundred natives upon that
blackened sward."</blockquote>

<p>After presenting their friend who had acted so effectively on
their behalf, and whose energetic conduct and prompt interference
to preserve peace is unparalleled in native annals, with suitable
gifts and refusing them to the other chiefs, the boat's crew
proceeded to examine the new river they had discovered at such a
critical moment.</p>

<p>Pulling easily up for a short distance they found it preserved a
breadth of one hundred yards, and a depth of rather more than
twelve feet, The banks were sloping and grassy, crowned with fine
trees, and the men exclaimed that they had got into an English
river.</p>

<p>To Sturt himself the moment was a supreme one; was it, or was it
not that mysterious Darling, whose course through the far interior
had been a subject of speculation ever since its discovery? He felt
sure that it was.</p>

<blockquote>"An irresistible conviction impressed me that we were now
sailing on the bosom of that very stream from whose banks I had
been twice forced to retire. I directed the Union jack to be
hoisted, and giving way to our satisfaction we all stood up in the
boat and gave three distinct cheers. It was an English feeling, an
ebullition, an overflow, which I am ready to admit that our
circumstances and situation will alone excuse. The eve of every
native had been fixed upon that noble flag, at all times a
beautiful object, and to them a novel one, as it waved over us in
the heart of the desert. They had until that moment been
particularly loquacious, but the sight of that flag and the sound
of our voices hushed the tumult, and while they were still lost in
astonishment, the boat's head was turned, the sail was sheeted
home, both wind and current were in our favour, and we vanished
from them with a rapidity that surprised even ourselves, and which
precluded every hope of the most adventurous among them to keep up
with us."</blockquote>

<p>Once Pore down the now united streams of the Murray and the
Darling the party made rapid progress, landing occasionally to
inspect the country, but finding always a boundless flat on either
side of them.</p>

<p>Provisions now began to get scarce with them, the barrels of
salt pork that had been in the skiff when she sank in the
Morumbidgee had their contents damaged by the admission of the
fresh water. The fish, though abundant, were more than unattractive
to their palates, and the men took no trouble to set the night
lines. The strictest economy had, therefore, to become the order of
the day. The skiff being only a drag to them, she was broken up,
and burnt for the sake of the nails and iron-work.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January, the whale-boat continued its voyage
alone, and the record from day to day was only broken by their
intercourse with the different tribes, with whom a regular system
of communication was now established. Deputies were sent ahead,
from one tribe to another, to prepare them for the visit of the
strangers. These deputies, by cutting off the numerous bends of the
river, were enabled to travel much quicker than did Sturt,
frequently doing easily in one day what it took the boat two to
accomplish. Their black friends were, however, becoming rather a
nuisance; little or no information could be obtained from them, and
the constant handling and embracing, which they had from policy to
submit to, became horribly distasteful to all of them, particularly
as Sturt describes all the tribes he met with as being beyond the
average filthily dirty, and eaten up with skin diseases.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the wanderers thought they sighted a range to the
N.W., and the blacks confirmed it, pointing in that direction when
Hopkinson piled up some clay in imitation of mountains.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the leader calculated that they were still one
hundred and fifteen miles from the coast, and as they had been now
twenty-two days on the river, their return began to be a matter for
serious thought. From what he saw of the country, Sturt imagined
that it was, for the most part, barren and sandy, and would never
be utilised. But, of course, he had little or no opportunities,
travelling as he did, of forming a correct judgment.</p>

<p>The cliffs on the river bank now showed fossilized sea shells in
their strata; chains of hills, too, became visible, and one of the
natives, [This old native, after the settlement of the country, was
shot in cold blood by one of the South Australian police.] an old
man who had taken a strange fancy to Hopkinson, described the
roaring of the sea and the height of the waves, showing that he had
visited the coast. None, it may be certain, were more glad than the
leader to hear of their proximity, for his thoughts were always
busy with the failing condition of his men, and the accumulating
difficulties of his return.</p>

<p>True, it had been partly arranged that a vessel should proceed
to the south coast, but Sturt had little hope of meeting her, even
if one had been sent. The frequent bends in the river greatly
delayed their advance, but they were cheered by the flight of
sea-gulls over their heads. The river, too, widened day after day,
and a constant strong wind from the S.W., raised a chopping sea
that almost stopped their way; the blacks they met all assured them
that the ocean was at hand. On the 9th February, Sturt landing to
examine the country, saw before him the lake that terminated the
Murray. He had reached his goal, thirty-three days after separating
from his party, at the Morumbidgee. Crossing the lake the little
band landed on the southern shore, and ascertained that the
communication between it and the sea was impracticable on account
of its extreme shallowness; they found their position to be in
Encounter Bay, east of Spencer's Gulf, and from what they saw it
was evident that no ship could enter it during the prevalence of
the S.W. winds. All hope of a safe return centred in themselves.
The thunder of the surf, that they had so longed for, brought no
message of succour, but rather warned the lonely men to hasten
back, while yet some strength remained to them; and above all they
were surrounded by hostile blacks. Sturt had now a terrible task
before him. His men were weakened and on half rations; there was
every probability that the fickle natives might be troublesome on
their homeward route, and worst of all they would have to fight the
steady current of the river the whole way; nor would their spirits
be cheered by any hope of novelty or discovery. Under these gloomy
auspices Sturt re-entered the Murray on his return on the 13th
February.</p>

<p>The homeward journey is simply a record of unrelaxed toil day
after day, Sturt and M'Leay taking their turn at the oar like the
rest; added to which the blacks gave them far more trouble than
before. At the fall above the junction of the Darling they once
more met the friend who had saved them from coming into conflict
with the natives on the 24th January; he and some of his tribe
assisted them to get the boat up the rapids. On the 20th of March
they reached the camp on the Morumbidgee from whence they had
started, but it was now abandoned, and the hope that the relief
party had pushed down there to meet them was destroyed; there was
nothing for it but to pull on, but human nature was rapidly giving
way; the men though falling asleep at their oars never grumbled,
but worked steadily, if moodily, faithful to their duty to the
last. Then the river rose, and for days they struggled vainly
against it. One man went mad, and had to be relieved from the oars.
At last, when ninety miles from Pontebadgery, the place where Sturt
believed the relief party to be camped, he determined to dispatch
two men for provisions and await their return.</p>

<p>After six days, when the last ounce of flour had been served
out, the men came back with horses and drays, and all trouble was
at an end. This was on the 18th April, eighty-eight days after
their departure from the depôt, during which they had voyaged two
thousand miles.</p>

<p>This expedition, from whatever light it is regarded, either as
the most important contribution ever made to Australian geography,
or as an example of most wonderful endurance, and patient heroism
is equally one of the most glorious records in this history. The
leader and his men were alike worthy of each other.</p>

<p>We have now had in review the opinion of many men on the future
of the great interior, and seen how they all alike predicted for it
barrenness and desolation. Even the satisfaction that Sturt felt at
accomplishing the descent of the Murray was qualified by a
consideration of the valueless country it flowed through. The
question will naturally be asked, how could men of such ability and
more than average shrewdness make such a gross mistake as the
succeeding years have proved their opinion to be? The principal
reason will be found in their want of experience in witnessing the
development and improvement of land by stocking, and their
ignorance of the value of the vegetation they condemned as
worthless. Hume was the only man amongst them exceptionally fitted
by training to judge of the capability of the land, and we do not
often get at his direct opinion, nor is it likely that, with the
memory of the green meadow lands and sparkling waters of the
Morumbidgee fresh in his mind, it would be a very favourable one.
Oxley and Sturt both wrote smarting under disappointment, and both
had been suddenly confronted with a new and strange experience
which they could associate with nothing but the idea of a desert.
That all this seemingly desolate waste should one day have a
distinctive value of its own was what they could hardly dream
of.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>During the time that Oxley, Sturt, and Hume had been tracing out
and painfully discovering the watershed of the Murray, a settlement
had been formed at King George's Sound, in Western Australia, and
some slight attempts at exploration made, but of inconsiderable
extent. The settlement was entrusted to Major Lockyer, who was
succeeded by Captain Barker, destined to meet a violent death at
the mouth of the Murray. In 1828, Captain Stirling, in the
<i>Success</i>, visited the coast, and made a close examination of
the Swan River. He was accompanied by Frazer the botanist, who had
now been present at the opening of a great deal of new country.
Stirling's report was a favourable one, and the Home Government
determined to form a free colony there. In 1831, we find a
communication to the Colonial Government, notifying that the
<i>Isabella</i> be dispatched to Hobart Town, to bring up a
detachment of the 63rd regiment to relieve those of the 39th, at
King George's Sound. Also, directing the withdrawal from the
present settlement of both prisoners and troops.</p>

<p>Stirling was then appointed Lieutenant-Governor, and to induce
immigration and settlement, the colonists were promised land in
proportion to the capital they brought into the country, and for
every labourer they brought out they received two hundred acres of
land additional.</p>

<p>At first, the prospects of this new colony seemed most hopeful,
exploration was pushed out to the eastward for one hundred miles,
as far as Mount Stirling, and northward for some sixty miles or so,
and the country discovered gave every promise of being fitted for
both pasture and agriculture.</p>

<p>Captain Bannister made a trip in 1831 from Perth, the new
settlement, to the old one of King George's Sound; and, although he
made no important discoveries, he passed through fairly available
country nearly the whole of the way.</p>

<p>For some reason or other, however, a period of stagnation set
in, and little more was done in the way of exploring until
Lieutenant Grey took the field in 1837. In this new settlement, so
entirely opposed to Port Jackson in situation, no difficulties of
any magnitude were experienced in passing the coast range, as had
been the great obstacle of the early explorers in New South Wales.
Unfortunately, however, the comparatively lower altitude of the
Darling Range led to there being no such flow of water inland as
even those disappointing rivers the Macquarie and Lachlan had
afforded. Consequently, exploration and the ensuing occupation
were, as in the parent colony, strictly confined to the immediate
neighbourhood of the township, to the Swan River, and its
tributaries, the Avon and the Canning.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Roe attempted several journeys to the eastward, and
discovered many salt lakes on the tableland of the interior.
Messrs. Bunbury, Wilson, and Moore made other explorations, more or
less succeeding in the purposes they had in view; but they all
embraced so small an area, and so little details have been
preserved, that they cannot take any important rank in the history
of continental explorations.</p>

<p>During the twenties another settlement had been formed on the
northern coast of Australia; but one not destined to drag out a
very long existence.</p>

<p>Captain Gordon Bremer, in the <i>Tamar</i>, accompanied by two
transports, sailed through Torres Straits and anchored in Port
Essington, in 1824. The port was, however, at that time condemned
as a site for a settlement, the supply of fresh water did not come
up to expectations, and the dry months of the year had set in.
Bremer sailed for Melville Island, one of twin islands lying off
the coast. These islands, Melville and Bathurst, are separated from
each other by a narrow strait that Captain King, the discoverer,
mistook for a river. On Melville Island a favourable site with
abundance of fresh water was found, and the usual routine of taking
possession and forming an encampment gone through, and for a time
things seemed to prosper; the soil of the island is good, and
tropical fruits would flourish with little trouble; but hostilities
commenced with the blacks, sickness broke out, and in 1829 it was
determined to abandon the settlement, and since that date no
attempt has been made to colonise this island, although it is now
stocked with the increase of the buffaloes left behind by the
<i>Tamar's</i> people.</p>

<p>Fort Wellington, in Raffles Bay, founded in 1826, fared no
better, although controlled during its last year by the gifted and
unfortunate Captain Barker. A blight of stagnation seemed in those
days to hang over all attempts at settlement in the tropical
regions, and in three years' time Fort Wellington was abandoned,
and with it the northern coast.</p>

<p>Once more we must turn our attention to the southern watershed
of the Darling, and the additional links of discovery in the great
network of its tributaries.</p>

<p>Rumour, always busy with tales of the unknown interior, now
spread a story of a mysterious river called the Kindur, running to
the north-west. A runaway convict named Clarke, alias "the barber,"
brought the story up first. He said that he had long heard of the
river from the natives, and at last determined to make his escape
and follow it down to see if it would lead him to any other
country. He, therefore, took to the bush, and started on this
adventurous trip. The imaginative and highly-coloured fabrication
that he related on his return, was probably invented in order to
save his back, but at any rate it was plausible enough to induce
the Government to dispatch an expedition to investigate the matter.
This was his story. He started from Liverpool Plains, and followed
a river called by the natives the <i>Gnamoi</i> or <i>Nammoy</i>,
into which he said that Oxley's river Peel flowed. Crossing this he
struck another river, the <i>Kindur</i>, and down this stream he
travelled no less than four hundred miles before it was joined by
the <i>Gnamoi</i>. Nothing daunted he stuck to the <i>Kindur</i>,
which was broad and navigable, flowing through level country and
spreading into occasional lakes, until at last he reached the sea,
but he acknowledged that he had lost his reckoning, and whether it
was five hundred or five thousand miles he went he could not
truthfully say, but he was as quite sure upon one point, that he
had never travelled south of west.</p>

<p>When at the mouth of the river he ascended a hill and looked out
to sea where he saw an island, inhabited, the natives told him, by
copper-coloured men who came in large canoes to the mainland for
scented wood. In addition he introduced various details of large
plains, <i>Balyran</i>, that he had crossed, and a burning mountain
named <i>Courada</i>. As he saw no prospect of getting away from
Australia, Clarke decided on returning.</p>

<p>This wild tale, and the expedition it led to, brings on the
scene one of the most noted figures of the past, Oxley's successor,
Surveyor-General Major Mitchell.</p>

<p>The Acting-Governor, Sir Patrick Lindesay, decided on sending
out an expedition to find out the truth of this story, thinking
that, at any rate, it would lead to the exploration of a great deal
of new country. Accordingly, Major Mitchell received instructions
to take charge of the party, and on the 21St of November, 1831,
took his departure from Liverpool Plains. On the 15th of December,
he came to the Peel, and crossing Oxley's Hardwicke Range, reached
the Namoi River on the 16th. After penetrating some distance into a
range, which he called the Nundawar Range, he made back for the
Namoi, and proceeded to set up the canvas boats he had with him,
intending to try to follow the river in them. His attempt was
fruitless, one of the boats was soon snagged, and it became evident
that it would be much easier to follow the Namoi on horseback.
Leaving the river, after passing the range he had vainly tried to
cross, Mitchell, on the 9th of January, 1832, came to the river
Gwydir of Cunningham. Turning to the westward the party followed
this river down for eighty miles, when he again returned to his
northern course, and came to the largest river he had yet found.
This was called, by the natives, the <i>Karaula</i>, and Mitchell
descended it until convinced, by its southern course and the
junction of the Gwydir, that he was on the upper part of Sturt's
Darling.</p>

<p>As the junction of the Namoi could not be far distant, Mitchell
had thus laid down the course and direction of these two large
rivers, although he had as yet seen nothing of the object of his
search, the Kindur.</p>

<p>He now prepared to move once more to the north, anxious to find
a river that did not belong to the Darling system. As, however, he
was on the point of starting, he was overtaken by his
assistant-surveyor, Finch, who was bringing on additional supplies,
with the disastrous news that the blacks had attacked his camp
during a temporary absence, murdered the two men, robbed the
supplies, and dispersed the cattle. This misfortune put a stop to
the progress of the party. They returned, and having buried the
bodies of the victims, but failed to find the murderers, made their
way back to the settled districts.</p>

<p>This journey of Major Mitchell's helped greatly to work out the
courses of the rivers crossed by Oxley, and more especially those
discovered by Cunningham during his trip to the Darling Downs.
Mitchell travelled, as it were, a more inland but parallel track,
crossing the rivers much lower down. Thus the Field River of Oxley
is the <i>Namoi</i> of Mitchell, Cunningham's Gwydir is recognised
by the Surveyor-General, and is probably the mythical <i>Kindur</i>
or <i>Keinder</i>, whilst the last found river, Mitchell's
<i>Karaula</i>, is formed by the junction of Cunningham's
Dumaresque and Condamine.</p>

<p>When we add to this the discovery of the Drummond Range,
Mitchell's first contribution to Australian geography was
sufficiently important.</p>

<p>This year, 1832, was marked by the murder of Captain Barker,
already mentioned as in turn Commandant of Fort Wellington and King
George's Sound. He was returning from the latter place, after
handing over charge to Captain Stirling, and on his way home landed
on the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, to see if the waters of
Lake Alexandrina, the termination of the Murray, had an outlet in
the Gulf. Being unsuccessful he crossed the range and paid a visit
to the lake. Anxious to obtain some bearings, he swam across the
channel connecting the lake with the sea in order to ascend the
sandhills on the opposite side. His companions watched him take
several bearings from the top of the hill, descend out of view on
the other side, and he was never seen again. One of the sealers
from Kangaroo Island interrogated the blacks by means of a native
woman of the island, who could speak broken English, and her
account was that Barker met three natives as he descended the sand
dune, who attacked and speared him, unarmed and naked as he was,
and then cast his body in the breakers. These natives were of the
same tribes that showed such determined hostility to Sturt when he
first found the lake.</p>

<p>Although Sturt himself felt confident that the junction of the
Murray and Darling were satisfactorily proved by what he saw on his
famous boat excursion, he had not convinced all of the public.
Major Mitchell, for one, had an entirely different theory on the
subject embracing the existence of a. dividing range between the
Macquarie and Lachlan rivers which would entirely preclude the
Darling and Murray from joining. Time, however, proved that Sturt's
instinct had not been at fault when on reaching the junction of the
two rivers in his whale-boat, he felt convinced that he there saw
the outflow of his old friend, the Darling.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the explorations conducted by Major
Mitchell were also surveys, superintended by him as
Surveyor-General, which will partly explain the presence of the
large body of men and equipage which it was his custom to take with
him. The roll call of the members of one of his expeditions reads
like that of an invading army. [See Appendix.]</p>

<p>In order to get some additional information concerning the
elevated country that Oxley had noticed to the westward between the
Lachlan and the Macquarie (on which slight foundation Major
Mitchell had built his theory of the two rivers running through
distinctly different basins), Mr. Dixon was sent out in 1833. This
gentleman, however, for some reason did not adhere to his
instructions; he followed down the Macquarie for some distance and
crossed to the Bogan (Sturt's New Year's Creek), then running
strong, and having followed that river for sixty-seven miles,
returned to Bathurst; nothing new nor important came of this
expedition.</p>

<p>In March, 1833, the party formed under the superintendence of
the Surveyor-General left Parramatta to travel by easy stages to
Buree, where they were to be overtaken by their leader. The list of
the members is a long one. We who live in the days of well-equipped
small parties, composed of reliable, experienced men only, would
feel considerably handicapped with such a retinue. In addition to
Major Mitchell, Richard Cunningham, botanist (brother to Allan
Cunningham), and Mr. Larmer, assistant surveyor, there were
twenty-one men; carpenters, bullock drivers, blacksmith, shoemaker,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>While still on the outskirts of settlement, an unhappy fate
overtook Cunningham, the botanist. Leaving the party, doubtless on
some scientific quest, during the morning of the 17th of April,
whilst they were pushing over a dry stage to the Bogan River, he
lost his way, and was never seen again.</p>

<p>A long and painful search was immediately instituted for the
missing man, but unfortunately, through some accident, his tracks
were overlooked on the third day, and it was not until the 23rd of
the month that the footsteps were found. Mr. Larmer and three men
were sent with an ample supply of provisions to follow the tracks
until they found Cunningham, alive or dead. Three days later they
returned, having found the horse he had ridden, dead, with the
saddle and bridle still on. Mitchell returned to the search once
more; the lost man's trail was again picked up, and he was tracked
to the Bogan River. They there met with some blacks who had seen
the white man's track in the bed of the river, and made the
searchers understand that he had gone to the west with the "Myall"
[Wild blacks who had not visited the settlements.]
blackfellows.</p>

<p>All hope of finding him alive was now almost abandoned, but the
pursuit was continued until May 5th, when the men brought back
tidings that they had followed his tracks to where it disappeared
near some recent fires where many natives had been encamped. Close
to one of these fires they found a portion of the skirt or selvage
of Cunningham's coat, numerous small fragments of his map of the
colony, and, in the hollow of a tree, some yellow printed paper in
which he used to carry the map. His fate was afterwards ascertained
from the blacks. [ See Appendix.]</p>

<p>As is unfortunately so usual in these cases, Cunningham had, by
wandering in eccentric and contradictory courses, accelerated his
fate, by rendering the work of the tracking party so much more
tedious and difficult. Had he, on finding how absolutely he was
astray, remained at the first water he reached, he would have been
found.</p>

<p>Having done all that man could do to find his lost friend, and
even jeopardised the final success of his own expedition by the
long delay of fourteen days, Mitchell resumed his journey by easy
stages down the Bogan, and on the 25th of May reached the Darling,
which was at once recognised by all the former members of the party
as the "Karaula," from the peculiar attributes that characterised
it. On tasting the water, they were agreeably surprised to find it
fresh and sweet. The state of the country now was very different
from what it was when Sturt was forced to retreat. With that
explorer's graphic account of the barren solitude that he met with,
fresh in the reader's memory, let him contrast it with what
Mitchell writes, remembering that one was encamped beside a salt
stream, and the latter writer beside a fresh water river.</p>

<blockquote>"We were extremely fortunate, however, in the place to
which the bounteous hand of Providence had led us. Abundance of
pasture, indeed such excellent grass as we had not seen in the
whole journey, covered the fine forest ground on the bank of the
river. There were four kinds, but the cattle appeared to relish
most a strong species of <i>authistiria</i>, or kangaroo
grass."</blockquote>

<p>Finding the place eligible in every respect for the formation of
a depôt, a stockade of logs was erected and the encampment
christened Fort Bourke.</p>

<p>The boats were launched, but the navigation of the river was
found to be impeded by shallow rapids, so the party returned to
Fort Bourke, and Mitchell with four men made an excursion down the
river to the point where Sturt and Hume turned back. D'Urbans group
was also 'Visited, and bearings taken to whatever elevations were
in sight. On returning to the depôt the camp was broken up and the
whole party started down the Darling (the <i>Calla-watta</i> of the
natives) on the 8th June. During their progress they found the tree
marked H. H. by Hume, at Sturt's limit, and they now noticed that
in places the river water was salt or brackish. On the 11th of
July, after following the course of the river for three hundred
miles, and ascertaining beyond all doubt that it must be identical
with the junction in the Murray, noticed by Captain Sturt, Mitchell
determined to return; the unvarying sameness of the country they
had travelled over holding forth no hope of any important discovery
being made, in the space intervening between their lowest camp and
Sturt's junction. The natives, too, had been an incessant cause of
annoyance to them; robbing the camp at every opportunity, and
keeping the leader in constant anxiety for the safety of any of the
members of his party, whom duty compelled to leave the main body.
On the very day, almost at the very hour, when Mitchell made up his
mind to return, the first hostile collision between the two races
occurred; a collision which had only been hitherto averted by the
admirable patience of the Major and his men. On the 29th June, he
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I never saw such unfavourable specimens of the
aborigines as these children of the smoke, [Referring to their
constant habit of burning the grass.] they were so barbarously and
implacably hostile, and shamelessly dishonest, and so little
influenced by reason that the more they saw of our superior weapons
and means of defence, the more they showed their hatred and tokens
of defiance."</blockquote>

<p>On the morning of this day, when he had settled in his own mind
the futility of further progress, two of the men were away at the
river, and five of the the bullock drivers were also at another
bend, collecting their cattle. One of the blacks whom they had
nick-named King Peter tried to snatch the kettle of water from the
hand of the man who was carrying it; and on being resisted he
struck him senseless with his nulla-nulla. The companion of the
wounded man shot King Peter in the groin, and his majesty tumbled
into the river and swam across. The tribe now advanced against
them, and two shots were fired in self defence, one of which
accidentally wounded a gin. Three men from the camp hearing the
firing came up, and one more native was shot, who was preparing to
spear one of the men. The natives retreating, the men went in
search of the bullock-drivers, whom they found endeavouring to
raise a bogged bullock: their timely arrival probably saved these
men's lives, as they were unarmed and unprepared.</p>

<p>War being thus declared, a careful watch was kept up, but no
attack was made, and the explorers departed unmolested.</p>

<p>In speaking of this skirmish, Mitchell, seemingly worked up to a
sentimental pitch by hearing some gins crying out across the river
in the night time, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"It was then that I regretted most bitterly the inconsiderate
conduct of some of the men. I was indeed liable to pay dear for
geographical discovery, when my honour and character were delivered
over to convicts, on whom, although I might confide as to courage,
I could not always rely for humanity."</blockquote>

<p>By his own account, as given above, the affray was provoked by
the blacks, who compelled the men to use their weapons to save
their own lives; the reflections then, on their humanity, and the
danger in which his character stood in consequence, are slightly
out of place.</p>

<p>The travellers now retraced their steps, and beyond the delays
caused by some of the bullocks knocking up, their return journey to
Fort Bourke was unmarked by anything of interest. From Fort Bourke
they returned, partly along their outward track, to the head of the
Bogan, and reached a newly-formed cattle station belonging to Mr.
Lee, of Bathurst, on the 9th of September.</p>

<p>The great fact added to the geographical knowledge of Australia
by the successful termination of this trip, was the identity of the
Darling with the <i>Karaula</i> on the north, and with Sturt's
Murray junction on the south. It was now satisfactorily settled
that this river was the channel that received all the tributary
streams flowing westward&mdash;so far north, at any rate, as
Cunningham's researches had extended, and that therefore their
final outlet was in Lake Alexandrina, and the idea of a river
winding through the interior to the north-west coast had to be
finally relinquished.</p>

<p>This journey of Mitchell's was also instrumental in somewhat
palliating the view held of the uninhabitable nature of the far
interior; although the true character of the country had yet to be
learnt and appreciated. His stay on the banks of the Darling at
least lifted from those plains the stigma of a grassless, naked
waste, intersected by a river of brine.</p>

<p>Mitchell, too, was a keen observer of the habits and customs of
the blacks, he was remarkably quick at detecting tribal differences
and distinctions, and his record of his intercourse with them,
which occupies so large a portion of his journals, was interesting
then, when so little had been written on the subject, and is
interesting now as the account of the white man's first incursions
into the hunting ground of a fast vanishing race.</p>

<p>Mitchell's next expedition took place in 1836, in the month of
March. As before, it was to be more of a connecting survey,
confirming and verifying previous discoveries, than a fresh
departure into an utterly new region; but it turned out to be
productive of the most important results.</p>

<p>The Surveyor-General was informed that the survey of the Darling
was to be completed with the least possible delay, that having
returned to the point where his last journey terminated, he was to
trace the Darling into the Murray, and crossing his party over that
river by means of his boats, follow it up, and regain the colony
somewhere at Yass Plains. This programme was, however, departed
from in many ways.</p>

<p>The new ground broken by Mitchell would thus be the Murray River
above the junction with the Morumbidgee or Murrumbidgee, as it was
now called, and it was supposed that he would be able to identify
it with the Hume River of the explorer of that name.</p>

<p>A long continued drought was in full force when Mitchell
commenced his preparations; horses and bullocks in good condition
were in consequence hard to obtain; but no expense was spared by
the Government in providing the animals required. On reaching
Bathurst, he was informed that even the Lachlan was dry.</p>

<p>In spite of the state of the weather and country, Major Mitchell
departed in high spirits. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I remembered that exactly that morning, twenty-four years
before, I had marched down the glacis of Elvas to the tune of 'St.
Patrick's Day in the Morning,' as the sun rose over the beleagured
towers of Badajoz. Now, without any of the 'pride, pomp, and
circumstances of glorious war,' I was proceeding on a service not
very likely to be peaceful, for the natives here assured me that
the myalls were coming up 'murry coola' [Very angry.] to meet
us."</blockquote>

<p>On March 17th, 1836, this start took place, but it was not until
the end of the month that he reached the limit of the cattle
stations, and then he was at the point where Oxley had left the
river and turned south to avoid the flooded marshes. Oxley wrote of
a country that no living thing would stop in if it could possibly
get away; twenty years afterwards, Mitchell writes of the same
place:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"In no district have I seen cattle so numerous as all along the
Lachlan, and, notwithstanding the very dry season, they are nearly
all in good condition."</blockquote>

<p>As might have been expected, he followed down the Lachlan riding
dry-shod over the swamps and flats that had barred Oxley's
progress, and finding his lakes only green and grassy plains. Such
had been the effect of the exceptional season during which the late
Surveyor-General had conducted his explorations, that the country,
save for the few land-marks afforded by the hills here and there,
could scarcely be recognised from his description. Mitchell seems
to have been strongly imbued with two leading ideas, one being the
existence of well-defined mountain chains in the interior, forming
systematic watersheds in a country where we now know there is no
system; the other that former explorers, however reliable they
might have been in their main facts, were quite at sea in any
deductions they had drawn from them, and that his theories would be
confirmed to their discomfiture.</p>

<p>The Surveyor-General had with him as second on this trip, Mr.
Stapylton, a surveyor, and his company consisted of Burnett, the
overseer, and twenty-two men, some of whom had been with him
before.</p>

<p>For some reason or other he seemed particularly anxious to upset
Sturt's positive belief that the junction of the large river with
the Murray discovered by him, was the confluence of the Darling and
the Murray. During his journey down the Lachlan he returns to this
idea again, and his remarks are decidedly inconsistent with his
former statements. On turning back from following the Darling down,
his words were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The identity of this river with that which had been seen to
enter the Murray, now admitted of little doubt, and the
continuation of the survey to that point was scarcely an object
worth the peril likely to attend it."</blockquote>

<p>On the Lachlan, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I considered it necessary now to ascertain, if possible, and
before the heavy part of our equipment moved further, whether the
Lachlan actually joined the Murrumbidgee near the point where Mr.
Oxley saw its waters covering the country, or whether it pursued a
course so much more to the westward, as to have been taken for the
Darling by Captain Sturt. Should I succeed in reaching the Lachlan
at about sixty miles west of my camp, I might be satisfied that it
was this river which Captain Sturt mistook for the Darling, and
then I might seek that river by crossing the range on the north.
Whereas, should I find sufficient reason to believe that the
Darling would join the Murray, I might continue my journey down the
Lachlan until I reduced the distance across to the Darling as much
as the scarcity of water might render necessary."</blockquote>

<p>On the whole, then, Mitchell did not seem inclined to give Sturt
any credit for his discovery, until he had actually seen the two
rivers unite, and there could no longer be any room for doubt on
the subject.</p>

<p>A long excursion to the westward for some days, resulted in
nothing but thirsty nights, and having finally to turn back from
country bounded only by an unbroken horizon. The descent of the
Lachlan was continued, and on May 5th, they reached Oxley's lowest
point on the river, where he had given up the quest as hopeless
amid the shallow, stagnant lagoons that then covered the face of
the country. The tree marked by Oxley himself was not found, it
having been, as was ascertained, burnt down by the blacks, and the
bottle buried by him, broken by a child. Two trees were seen marked
respectively W.W. and I.W., 1817. This was the place where Oxley
left the river the second time, after his fruitless trip to the
south, and from here he struck across to the Macquarie.</p>

<p>Through level plains and by the beds of erstwhile lakes, the
course of the river continued, and as the party proceeded they
found it abundantly watered. From his intercourse with the native
inhabitants, Mitchell was now convinced that the Lachlan or Kalare
would soon join the Murrumbidgee, so that when on the 12th May he
suddenly found himself on the banks of a river that he thought
surpassed all the Australian rivers he had yet seen, he was not
surprised.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, as the Major was anxious not to encumber
himself with all his heavy waggons to the junction of the Darling,
as he would have to return again, a depôt was formed, and the men
divided. Mitchell, with a lightly equipped party following down the
river, leaving Stapylton in charge of the camp.</p>

<p>In a short time the advance party came to the Murray, and
immediately found themselves amongst their former enemies of the
Darling, who hearing of their approach, through the medium of other
tribes, had come a distance of over two hundred miles to settle the
old score between them. At first a kind of hollow truce was
maintained, but this evidently could not last long; for two days
the natives followed the explorers, seeking to cut off any
stragglers; making the work of gathering and minding the cattle and
horses one of considerable danger.</p>

<p>At last Mitchell was convinced that he must read them a lesson,
or lose some of his men, and have to fight his way back, with the
whole country roused. Half the party were then sent back, under the
overseer, to conceal themselves in the scrub and allow the natives
to pass on in pursuit of the tracks; this ambuscade, however, was
scented out by the dogs accompanying the blacks, and the natives
halted, poising their spears. One of the men hastily fired, and a
retreat was made for the bank of the river by the blacks. The scrub
party followed them up firing, and no sooner did those in advance
hear the sound of the shots, than they rushed down to join in the
fray, leaving the black boy's gin the sole protector of the drays,
and equipment. On his return, the Major found her standing erect at
the head of the leading horse, with a drawn sword over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Her appearance was, above all, both laughable and interesting.
She was a tall, gaunt woman, with one disfigured eye, and her
attitude, as she stood there with the naked weapon in her hand,
faithful guard of all their belongings, was a picture that Mitchell
did not soon forget.</p>

<p>The fight was soon over; in a very short space of time the
over-confident warriors of the interior were driven ignominously
across the river with the loss of seven braves. This, after
invading the territory of a friendly tribe in order to provoke a
battle with the whites, and boasting that formerly they had driven
them back from the Darling, was a blow that they could not get
over, and the result was that the whites were not again molested.
It turned out that this pugnacious tribe was the same that
threatened Sturt at the Darling junction, when the energetic
interference of one man was so effectual. This remarkable savage,
it seems, was dead and his influence lost.</p>

<p>On the 31st May, Mitchell struck the Darling some distance above
the junction, and traced its course upwards a short way, until he
again felt convinced that it was the same river that he had been on
before, He returned and examined the junction, which he says he
recognised from the view given in Captain Sturt's work [Note, end
of paragraph] and the adjacent localities described by him. Full of
anxiety for the safety of his depôt, and considering that he had
done enough to verify the outflow of the Darling, he at once
started up the Murray, and was happily relieved by finding his camp
in perfect quiet and safety.</p>

<p>[Note Captain Sturt, writing in 1848, and speaking of Major
Mitchell's expedition, says:&mdash;"In due time he came to the
disputed junction, which he tells us he recognised from its
resemblance to a drawing of it in my first work. As I have since
been on the spot, I am sorry to say that it is not at all like the
place, because it obliges me to reject the only praise Sir Thomas
Mitchell ever gave me." The original sketch of the junction having
been lost, Sturt, who was nearly blind at the time of the
publication of his work, got the assistance of a friend, who drew
it from his verbal description.]</p>

<p>First fixing the junction of the Murray and Murrumbidgee, the
boats were launched, and the whole of the party crossed the Murray,
and the journey up the southern bank commenced. On the 20th of
June, they reached Swan Hill and camped at the foot of it. The
country was in every way desirable, and the progress of the party
was unchecked. On the 8th of July, the Loddon was discovered and
named, and on the 10th, the Avoca. Mitchell was now convinced that
he had found the Eden of Australia, and his enthusiasm in
describing it is unbounded. On the 18th of July, he discovered the
Wimmera, and on the 31st, the Glenelg. Here he launched his boat
once more, but found his way stopped at the outset by a fall, and
the river had to be followed on land. On the 18th of August, after
many excursions, the river being now much broader, the boats were
again resorted to, and in two days they reached the coast a little
to the east of Cape Northumberland.</p>

<p>Returning to the camp, the expedition made east, and reached
Portland Bay, where they found a farm established by the Messrs.
Henty, who had been there then nearly two years. Here they obtained
some small supplies, and again left on their homeward journey. On
the 4th September Mitchell abandoned one of his boats, in order to
lighten his equipage, as the draught work was excessively heavy for
his cattle, and one boat would answer the purpose of crossing
rivers. On the 10th, he caught sight of a range, and named it the
Australian Pyrenees, and on the 19th the party separated.</p>

<p>The Major and some of the men pushed on with the freshest of the
animals, leaving Stapylton and the remainder of the party to spell
for a while, and bring the knocked-up beasts slowly on.</p>

<p>On the 30th, Mitchell ascended Mount Macedon, and from the top
recognised Port Phillip.</p>

<blockquote>"No stockyards nor cattle were visible, nor even smoke, although
at the highest northern point of the bay I saw a mass of white
objects. which might have been either tents or vessels."</blockquote>

<p>But Mitchell was not to arrive home without another fatality
amongst his party. On October 13th, when looking for a crossing in
a river, one of the men, named James Taylor, was drowned.</p>

<p>On the 17th, after passing through a forest, they recognised
with great satisfaction, the lofty "Yarra" trees, and the low
verdant alluvial flats of the Murray. Once across the river, the
boat was sunk in a deep lagoon, and the boat carriage left on the
bank for the use of Stapylton. Three volunteers went back to meet
him, and assist in crossing the Ovens and Goulburn. The advance
party were now almost within the settled districts, and with the
safe arrival of Stapylton at the Murrumbidgee, on November 11th,
the history of the discovery of <i>Australia Felix</i> ends.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell had been singularly favoured during this
journey, his route had led him through a country possessing every
variety of feature, from snow-topped mountains to level plains,
watered by permanently-flowing stream and rivers; fitted, as he
says, for the immediate occupation of the grazier, and the farmer.
It, therefore, was of more real benefit to the colony than the
former exploratory journeys, that had met with only partial success
in this respect.</p>

<p>He had well carried out his instructions, and obtained a full
knowledge of the country south of the Murray, and of the rivers
there; flowing either into that river, or into the sea; confirming
the impression already entertained of the great value of the
district, and the report of Hume and Hovell, who with their slender
resources were unable to do much in the way of extended
examination.</p>

<p>We have seen that the brothers Henty, of Tasmania, had formed a
settlement at Portland Bay, and in 1835 the historic founding of
Port Phillip settlement by Batman took place, so that the mere
extension of settlement would soon have thrown open for settlement
the splendid area that Mitchell was just in time to claim as his
discovery. The story of Batman's compact with the blacks, by which
he asserted his right to a princely territory is too well-known to
require repetition; [Note, end of paragraph] it is scarcely
necessary to add that such a preposterous demand was neither
ratified by the government, nor recognised by the settlers.</p>

<p>[Note: The agreement was between Messrs. Batman, Gellibrand,
Swanston, and Simpson, on the one side, and the natives were
represented by Jagajaga, Cooloolook, Bungaree, Yanyan, Mowstrip,
and Mommamala, the price was fixed at an annuity of two hundred a
year, in return for 750,000 acres of land. Mr. Gellibrand
afterwards perished in the bush with a companion, Mr. Hesse, having
lost himself through persisting in keeping in the wrong direction,
although warned by a guide who left them on finding Gellibrand
determined to go wrong.]</p>

<p>It was through the energy of the Tasmanian colonists that this
settlement of Port Phillip took place; as already noticed, Port
Phillip was abandoned, almost without the slightest examination, by
Colonel Collins in favour of Tasmania, and now, after thirty years
had passed, the abundant flocks and herds of the little island
forced the owners to look to the mainland for extended
pastures.</p>

<p>One of the incidents of the early settlement was also the
discovery of Buckley, a white man, who having escaped from Collins'
party in 1803, had been living with the natives ever since.</p>

<p>In 1836 Colonel Light surveyed the shores of St. Vincent's Gulf,
and selected the site of the present city of Adelaide; Governor
Hindmarsh and a company of emigrants soon after arrived, and the
colony of South Australia was proclaimed.</p>

<p>The continent was now being invaded on three sides. From Perth
on the western shore, from St. Vincent's Gulf and Port Phillip on
the south, and from the settled districts of New South Wales and
from Moreton Bay on the east.</p>

<p>Henceforth, the tale of exploration embraces many simultaneous
expeditions; no longer is the whole of the narrative confined to
the struggle of one man, hopelessly endeavouring to surmount the
coast range, or toiling across the western plains, anxiously
watched by the little community at Port Jackson. Each new-formed
centre had their members pushing out, month after month, and
continually adding to the knowledge of Australia.</p>

<p>As usual, the records of most of these private expeditions have
not been preserved, and the utmost the historian can do is to trace
out the broad lines of discovery, leaving the reader to consider
the detail filled in by the monotonous, if valuable, and untiring
efforts of the pioneer squatters. Already these men and their
subordinates were close on the footsteps of the explorers; should
the adventurer remain some months absent from civilization, he
found, on his return, settlement far across what had been the
frontier line when he departed. Hundreds of lives have been laid
down in this service, under as strong a sense of duty, and under
circumstances as heroic as any of the deaths in the roll of martial
history, and the names of the victims unknown, and their graves
unhonoured. They have only been members of the great band ever
forcing a way, and smoothing a road for a commercial population, to
whom their deeds, their struggles, their hopes, and their fates are
often but a sealed book. But the feelings of a man who knows that
he has founded homes for future thousands, must be a greater
recompense than any his fellowmen could give him.</p>

<p>An expedition, most unique in its composition, now made an
attempt on the west coast to penetrate inland, and also verify the
existence or non-existence of the large river, still currently
supposed to find its way into the sea at Dampier's Archipelago. The
expedition was placed under the command of Lieutenant Grey, Mr.
Lushington acting as second in command. It originated in England,
and its members, with one exception, were what would locally be
called "new chums." The one exception was a sailor, named Ruston,
who had been with Captain King on one of his surveying voyages; an
experience that, under an older leader might have made him a most
serviceable man, but, otherwise, scarcely deserved the stress that
Grey laid upon his acquisition. Most of the equipment was procured
at the Cape of Good Hope, where a small vessel&mdash;the
<i>Lynher</i>&mdash;was chartered, and the landing-place in
Australia was at Hanover Bay, on the extreme north-west coast, near
the mouth of the Prince Regent's River; though, why this particular
point was chosen, does not appear quite clear. Being becalmed a
short distance from Hanover Bay, the foolish impetuosity of the
young explorers very nearly put an abrupt ending to their journey.
Grey, Lushington, and four men landed, and started to walk across
to Hanover Bay, there to be picked up again by the <i>Lynher</i>.
It was December, the middle of a tropical summer, and they took
with them two pints of water. They all very soon knocked up. Grey
swam across an inlet to try and signal the schooner, and nearly
lost his life doing so. Fortunately, the the flashes of their guns,
with which they kept firing distress signals, were noticed on
board, and a boat came to their rescue. This was an inauspicious
beginning.</p>

<p>After landing the stores, the <i>Lynher</i> sailed for Timor, to
procure some ponies and other live stock, and on the 17th of
January, 1838, she returned. At the end of January, Grey and his
party started from the coast with twenty-six half-broken Timor
ponies as a baggage train, and some sheep and goats. The rainy
season had set in, and the stock began to die almost before they
had well started, added to which, the party were entangled in steep
ravines and spurs from the coast range, and their strength worn out
in useless ascents and descents. On the 11th of February, they came
into collision with the natives, and Grey was severely wounded.</p>

<p>On the leader recovering sufficiently to be lifted on one of the
ponies, a fresh start was made, and on the 2nd of March they were
rewarded by finding a river, which they called the Glenelg, unaware
that Mitchell had already usurped the name. The adventurers
followed the course of this river upward, traversing good country,
well grassed and timbered, so far as their limited experience
allowed them to judge. Sometimes their route was on the river's
bank, and at other times by keeping to the foot of a sandstone
range that ran parallel with its course, they were enabled to cut
off some wearisome bends.</p>

<p>The party continued on the Glenelg for many days until they were
checked by a large tributary coming from the north, causing them to
fall back on the range, both the river and its tributary being
swollen and flooded. On this range they discovered some curious
paintings and drawings in the caves scattered amongst the rocks,
also a head in profile cut in the face of a sandstone rock. [See
Appendix.] Unable to find a pass through the mountains, which
barred their western progress, and greatly weakened by his wound,
Grey determined to return, but before doing so he sent Mr.
Lushington some distance ahead, who, however, could find no
noticeable change in the country.</p>

<p>The expedition, therefore retraced their footsteps, and on the
15th of April they reached Hanover Bay, and found the schooner at
anchor, and H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i> lying in the neighbouring Port
George the Fourth. Thus ended the first expedition; toil, danger,
and hardships having been incurred for little or no purpose, the
discovery of the Glenelg River being the only result obtained, and
perhaps, some little experience. The party having embarked, they
sailed for the Isle of France in the Mauritius, where they safely
arrived.</p>

<p>In August, Grey visited the Swan River, and endeavoured to get
assistance from Sir James Stirling, the Governor, to continue his
explorations; no vessel being available, he had to wait some time
before making a start, during which delay he made short excursions
from Perth into the surrounding country.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, 1839, he started once more in an
American whaler, taking with him three whale-boats. The objects of
this expedition are not very definite. The whaler was to land them
and their boats at Shark's Bay, or on one of the islands: there
they intended to form a depôt. After examining the bay, and making
such incursions inland as they found possible, they were to extend
their operations to the north as long as their provisions lasted,
when they would return to the depôt and make their way south.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Grey himself, four of his former
companions, a young volunteer, Mr. Frederick Smith, five other men,
and a native, twelve in all. They were landed on Bernier Island,
and at once their troubles commenced. The whaler sailed away taking
with her, by an oversight, their whole supply of tobacco; there was
no water on the island, and on the first attempt to start one of
the boats was smashed up and nearly half a ton of stores lost. The
next day they landed at Dorre Island, and that night both their
boats were driven ashore by a violent storm.</p>

<p>Two or three days were occupied repairing damages, and then they
made the mainland and obtained a supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>They landed near the mouth of a river, which, however, was dry
above tidal influence, and Grey christened it the Gascoyne. After a
short examination of the surrounding country, they pulled up the
coast to the north, and effecting a landing one night, both boats
were swamped, to the great damage of their already spoiled
provisions. Here Grey ascended a hill to look upon the surrounding
country, and was so deceived by the mirage, that he believed he had
discovered a great lake studded with islands; in company with three
of his men he started on a weary tramp after the constantly
shifting vision, needless to say without reaching it. Returning to
the boats they found themselves prisoners for a time, until the
wind dropped and the surf abated a little, and here they had to
remain for a week sick, hungry and weary, and at one time
threatened and attacked by the blacks. At last a slight cessation
in the gale tempted them, and they got the boats out and made for
the mouth of the Gascoyne, where they refilled their water
breakers. On March 20th, they made an effort to fetch their depôt
on Bernier Island in the teeth of the foul weather, and reached it
to find that during their absence a hurricane had swept the island,
and their hoarded stores were scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>Their position was now nearly desperate, the southerly winds had
set in, they had a surf-beaten shore to coast along, and no food of
any sort worth mentioning, added to which, as may be well supposed,
they were all weak and exhausted.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, however, but to put out to sea again,
and they managed to reach Gautheaume Bay on the 31st of March; in
attempting a landing, the boat Grey was in was dashed on a rock,
and the other boat too received such great damage that it was
impossible to repair either of them. Nothing was now left, but to
walk to Perth, and so wearied had the men become of fighting with
the wind and sea, that they even welcomed this hazardous prospect
as a change. They were about three hundred miles from the Swan
River and had twenty pounds of damaged flour, and one pound of salt
pork per man, to carry them there.</p>

<p>Soon after starting, a diversity of opinion sprang up about the
best mode of progressing. Grey wished to get over as much ground as
possible while their strength held out; most of the men, however,
were in favour of proceeding slowly, taking constant rests. This
feeling increased so much that, when within two hundred miles of
Perth, Grey found it necessary to take with him some picked men,
and push on, leaving the others to follow at their leisure. He
reached Perth after terrible suffering and privation, and a relief
party was at once sent out, but they only found one man, who had
left the others, thinking they were travelling too slow. Meanwhile,
Walker, the second in charge, had come into Perth, and related
that, being the strongest, he had pushed on in order to get relief
sent back to the remainder. Another party, under Surveyor-General
Roe, left in search, and after some trouble in tracking the erratic
wanderings of the unfortunates, came upon them hopelessly gazing at
a point of rocks, that stopped their march along the beach, not
having sufficient strength left to climb it. They had been then
three days without any water but sea water, and a revolting
substitute, which they still had in their canteens. Poor young
Smith, a lad of eighteen was dead. [ See Appendix.] He had lain
down and died two days before they were found. He was buried in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>During these two expeditions Grey had faced death in every
shape, and shown great powers of endurance, but the results of all
his toil were but meagre, and of no very great importance. He had
crossed and named the rivers running into the west coast, between
where he abandoned his boats and the Moore River, but in the state
he was in he knew little more than the fact that they were there,
having neither strength nor resources to follow them up and
determine their courses. Grey claims the discovery of the Gascoyne,
Murchison, Hutt, Bower, Buller, Chapman, Greenough, Irwin,
Arrowsmith, and Smith Rivers. This disastrous journey may be said
to have concluded his services to Australia as an explorer,
although he afterwards, when Governor of South Australia, made an
excursion to the south-east, but it was through comparatively
stocked and well-known country in the neighbourhood of the Glenelg
and Mount Gambier. Before being appointed Governor of South
Australia, he was Acting Government Resident at Albany, King
George's Sound.</p>

<p>Grey's mishaps, and the straits to which he reduced his party by
his occasional want of forethought and precaution, show plainly
that enthusiasm, courage, and a generous spirit of self-sacrifice
are not the only requisites in an explorer, more important even,
being the long training and teaching of experience.</p>

<p>Grey had given a very glowing description of the fertile
appearance of a portion of the country he passed through, and some
of the colonists were eager to make use of such a promising
district. The schooner <i>Champion</i> was therefore directed to
examine the coast and see if any of the rivers had navigable
entrances. Mr. Moore, after whom the Moore River was named, was on
board of the vessel, but no entrance was effected, although the
party rather confirmed Grey's report. Captain Stokes, of the
<i>Beagle</i>, however, soon after made a thorough examination of
this part of the coast, and his report was so unfavourable that its
immediate settlement was postponed.</p>

<p>It follows now, that the unexplored country west of the Darling
being so much sooner reached from Adelaide than from Sydney, the
former town became the point of departure from which, in future,
the expeditions for the interior started.</p>

<p>But the rush for country, and the constant influx of stock from
the mother colony, led to a series of petty explorations being
continually carried on throughout the rapidly-rising district south
and east of the Murray. Some of these were undertaken in quest of
new runs, others in order to find the best and shortest stock
routes; and the record of most of them is only preserved in the
memoirs Of personal friends of the pioneers.</p>

<p>Edward John Eyre, who afterwards made the celebrated journey to
Western Australia round the head of the Great Bight, began his bush
experiences in this way. Messrs. Hawdon, Gardiner and Bonney, also
about the same time, made various trips from New South Wales to
Port Phillip, and from thence to Adelaide, and many minor
discoveries were the result of those journeys. The he outflow and
courses of rivers being determined, and the speculations of their
first discoveries corrected or confirmed; as instance of this, may
be mentioned the discovery of Lake Hindmarsh, which receives the
Wimmera, River, the course of which had puzzled Mitchell when he
discovered it in July, 1836.</p>

<p>Eyre left Port Phillip for Adelaide early in 1838. The usual
course had been to strike to the Murray, and then to follow that
river down. He intended to try a straighter route, and for a time
did well; but, at last, finding himself in a tract of dry country,
across which he could not take the cattle with safety, he
determined to follow the Wimmera north, thinking it would take him
on to the banks of the Murray, and would probably turn out to be
the Lindsay junction of Sturt. From Mitchell's furthest point he
traced it some considerable distance to the north-west, and at last
found its termination in a large swampy lake, which he named Lake
Hindmarsh, after the first Governor of South Australia. From this
lake he found no outlet; so, leaving his cattle, and taking with
him two men, he made an effort to reach the Murray. But the country
was covered with an almost impenetrable scrub, and as there was
neither grass nor water for the horses, he was forced to turn back,
reaching his camp only after a weary tramp on foot, the horses
having died. According to Eyre's chart, they were within five and
twenty miles of the Murray when they turned back. Eyre was thus
forced to retrace his steps and make for the nearest available
route to the Murray, and follow that river down.</p>

<p>Bonney's trip from Portland Bay to Adelaide was about a year
subsequently. He pursued a more southerly and westerly course, and
managed to get through in safety, but experienced great hardships
on the way. One of a series of lakes or marshes was found, and
named Lake Hawdon.</p>

<p>At the end of November, 1839, Colonel Gawler, then Governor of
South Australia, made an excursion to the Murray, for the purpose
of examining the country around Lake Victoria, and to the westward
of the great bend. He was accompanied by Captain Sturt, then
Surveyor-General of the province. In the <i>S.A. Register</i> of
that date, the following paragraph shows that by this time ladies
had also taken up the task of exploration:</p>

<blockquote>"His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by Miss Gawler and
Captain and Mrs. Sturt, left town on Friday last week on an
excursion to the Murray and the interior to the north of that
river. The party is expected to be absent several weeks."</blockquote>

<p>It is to be presumed that Miss Gawler and Mrs. Sturt accompanied
the party but a short distance; the Murray at that date affording
anything but a safe camping ground. This trip, of course, did not
extend sufficiently for any important geographical discoveries to
be made, but it was unfortunately marked by one of the fatalities
that are bound to be a feature of exploration. Leaving the river
they penetrated into waterless country, and the horses knocked up.
Colonel Gawler and Mr. Bryan pushed back on the freshest animals,
intending to bring back water for the others, but on the way Bryan
gave in, and the Governor had to go on alone. On coming back with
relief Bryan was nowhere to be found, a note was pinned to his
coat, which was lying on the spot where he had been left, stating
that he had gone to the south-east, much exhausted; but although
all search was made he was never found.</p>

<p>Meantime, we have lost sight entirely of the north coast, and
the attempts at settlement in that quarter. The little
<i>Beagle</i> had been working industriously up there; but the
account of her voyage belongs to the history of maritime discovery,
where it will be found; however, on this occasion she visited a
newly-formed, or rather twice-formed, settlement, Port Essington.
This station, after the visit by Captain Bremer, was, it will be
remembered, abandoned. In 1838, its former founder, now Sir Gordon
Bremer, resettled it, and the nucleus of a township was formed.
This time it seemed, at first, more likely to thrive; but very
little was done in the way of exploration, and its existence added
nothing to our knowledge of the northern interior. From a letter of
one of the officers of the Beagle we learn that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"A good substantial mole, overlooked by a small battery, with
some respectable-sized houses in the rear, gives the settlement
rather an imposing appearance from the water, which I imagine is
the object at present aimed at&mdash;to make an impression on the
visiting Malays, the success of the colony depending so much on
them."</blockquote>

<p>Apparently the dependence of the colony was misplaced as it is
scarcely necessary to tell the reader that it has long since passed
out of existence; we shall, however, have occasion to revisit it
once before its final abandonment.</p>

<p>The time had now come for the completion of the work commenced
by Hume and Hovell sixteen years before, namely, the full
exploration of the south-east corner of Australia.</p>

<p>In 1840, McMillan, the manager of a station near the Snowy
Mountains, the property of Messrs. Buckler and M'Allister, started
on a search for country in company with two companions, Messrs.
Cameron and Mathew, one stockman and a blackfellow. Making their
way through the Snowy Mountains to the southward, they found a
river running through fine grazing country, plains and forest,
until its course brought them to a large lake; here they were
forced to turn westward, and although they made several attempts to
reach the coast they did not succeed, having continually to turn
back to the range to ford the numerous rivers they kept coming
to.</p>

<p>Having only a fortnight's provisions with them, they were forced
to return, when within about fifty miles of Wilson's Promontory.
This fine addition to the already known territory was called
Gippsland, after Sir George Gipps, the Governor who had the
disagreeable eccentricity of insisting that all the towns laid out
during his term of office should have no public squares included in
their boundaries, as he was convinced that public squares
encouraged the spread of democracy.</p>

<p>The rivers discovered by McMillan were named by him, but
afterwards re-named by Count Strzelecki, whose titles were
retained, whilst the rightful ones bestowed by the real discoverer
are forgotten.</p>

<p>Doubtless Strzelecki's names, such as the La Trobe, &amp;c., had
a ring more pleasing to the official ear.</p>

<p>The celebrated count followed hard on McMillan's footsteps, in
fact, the latter met him before reaching home and directed him to
the country he had just left. McMillan, having his own interests to
serve, said little or nothing about the result of his journey, not
wishing to be forestalled in the occupation of the country.
Strzelecki, not being interested in squatting pursuits, made public
the value of the province as soon as he returned, which has led to
his being often erroneously considered the discoverer of
Gippsland.</p>

<p>Strzelecki's trip through Gippsland, in 1840, was part of the
work he was undertaking to gather materials for his now well-known
book, "The Physical Description of New South Wales, Victoria, and
Van Die-man's Land." He mounted the Alps, and named one of the
highest peaks Kosciusko, from the fancied resemblance of its
outline to the patriot's tomb at Cracow. He then pushed his way
through to Western Port, crossing the fine rivers and rich country
just found by McMillan. They had to abandon their horses and packs
during the latter part of the journey, and fight their way through
a dense scrub on a scanty ration of one biscuit and a slice of
bacon per day. Here the count's exceeding hardihood stood them in
good stead; so weakened were his companions that it was only by
constant encouragement he got them along, and when forcing their
way through the matted scrub, he often threw himself bodily on it,
breaking a bath through for his weakened followers by the sheer
weight of his body. They reached Western Port in a most wretched
condition, having subsisted latterly on nothing but native
bears.</p>

<p>In 1841, a Mr. Orr landed at Corner Inlet and traversed part of
the country surveyed by Strzelecki; he traced the La Trobe and
other rivers into a large lake fifty miles from Wilson's
Promontory, and confirmed the glowing reports of the former
travellers.</p>

<p>We have now to bid a final farewell to the garden of Australia,
where the explorers' steps trod the alleys of shady forests of
gigantic trees, or followed the bank of some living, sparkling
stream, rippling and bubbling over its pebbly bed, amid verdant
meadows and fertile valleys. No more was the outlook to be over
smiling downs backed up by the fleecy-topped Alps, a scene that
told of nothing but peace, prosperity, and all the riches of a
bountiful soil. The way of the pioneer was, in future, to lead to
the north, where the earth refused to afford him pasture for his
animals, the clouds to drop rain, and the very trees gave no shade
to protect him from the sun in its noontide wrath. Over the lonely
plains of the interior, searching for the inland sea, never to be
found; for the lofty mountain chain, the backbone of Australia,
that had no existence.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August, 1839, E. J. Eyre, and a party consisting
of an overseer, three men and two natives, left Port Lincoln, on
the western shore of Spencer's Gulf, on an excursion to examine the
country to the westward, as far as they could penetrate. Before
this he had made an expedition to the north of Adelaide terminating
at Mount Arden, an elevation to the N.N.E. of the head of Spencer's
Gulf. From this mountain he saw a depression which he took to be
the bed of a lake, covered with mud or sand, the future Lake
Torrens.</p>

<p>On the 25th of August, after leaving Port Lincoln, he arrived at
Streaky Bay, not having crossed a single stream or river, nor even
a chain of ponds, during a distance of nearly three hundred miles.
Three springs only had been found, and the country was covered with
the dreaded <i>eucalyptus dumosa</i> scrub (mallee), and the
melancholy ti-tree. It must be remembered, however, that Eyre's
track bordered closely on the sea coast, and the country would, as
is usual in Australia, be of a barren and inhospitable character.
Westward of Streaky Bay the scrub still continued, so a depôt was
formed, and taking only a black boy with him, he reached within
about fifty miles of the western limit of South Australia. In
appearance the country was more elevated, but there was neither
water nor grass, and to return was necessary; in fact, before he
got back to the depôt, he nearly lost three of his horses.</p>

<p>From Streaky Bay he went east, to the head of Spencer's Gulf,
finding the country on his route a little better, but still devoid
of water, the party only getting through by means of the rain which
luckily fell at the time. On the 29th of September, he reached his
old camp at Mount Arden. Here he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"It was evident that what I had taken on my last journey to be
the bed of a dry lake now contained water, and was of a
considerable size; but as my time was very limited, and the lake at
a considerable distance, I had to forego my wish to visit it. I
have, however, no doubt of its being salt, from the nature of the
country, and the fact of finding the water very salt in one of the
creeks draining into it from the hills. Beyond this lake (which I
distinguished with the name of Colonel Torrens), to the westward,
was a low, flat-topped range, extending northwesterly as far as I
could see."</blockquote>

<p>From here Eyre pursued his old track homeward.</p>

<p>The objects that now excited the attention of the colonists of
South Australia were, discovery to the northward, as to the extent
of the newfound lake, and the nature of the interior; and the
possibility of the existence of a stock route to Western Australia.
Eyre, however, after his recent experience, was convinced that the
transit of stock round the head of the Great Bight was
impracticable, the sterile nature of the country and the absence of
watercourses being against it. Such a journey it was true might be
most interesting, from a geographical point of view, showing the
character of the country intervening between the two settlements,
and unfolding the secrets hidden behind the lofty and singular
cliffs at the head of the Great Bight, but for more immediate
practical results, Eyre favoured the extension of discovery to the
north. This was then the course adopted; subscriptions were raised,
Eyre himself finding one-third of the horses and expenses, and the
Government and colonists the remainder. Meantime, it turned out
that the country in the immediate neighbourhood of Port Lincoln was
not altogether of of the wretched character met with by Eyre
between Streaky Bay and the head of the Gulf.</p>

<p>A Captain Hawson, in company with Mr. William Smith and three
other gentlemen, made an excursion for a short distance, and found
well-grassed country and abundance of water. Where they turned back
they saw a fine valley with a running stream through the centre.
This valley they named Rossitur Vale, and the stream the
Mississippi, after Captain Rossitur, of the French whaler
<i>Mississippi</i>&mdash;the first foreign ship in Port Lincoln,
and the man who was afterwards destined to, afford such opportune
aid and succour to Eyre.</p>

<p>Western Australia, however, did not seem to entertain the
prospect of overland communication with Adelaide with any degree of
enthusiasm. The <i>Perth Gazette</i> of that time, indulges in a
short article, which reads ludicrously like an extract from the
<i>Eatanswill Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Overland from King George's Sound, we have received papers from
Adelaide, the mail having been obligingly conveyed by Dr. Harris.
In these papers we find the proposal to open a communication
between this and South Australia. The object, further than a
general exploration of the country, appears undefined; therefore,
to us, it seems of little interest, and the steady course of the
country should not be disturbed by such wild adventurers. What is
South Australia to us? They have their self-supporting system, they
have revelled in <i>moonshine</i> long enough; and we ought not to
be such fools as to be caught by a mere puffing document appointing
gentlemen here to co-operate with the South Australian committee.
If we wish to see them, we can soon find our way, and we require no
puffing advertisements from the neighbouring colony of high-minded
pretensions. We will not be licked by the dog that has bitten us;
and we must say that every honest mind should receive with caution
any approaches from such a quarter. We put this forward advisedly,
and with a desire that such a subject may be deliberately weighed
and considered. Their flummery about the existence of a jealous
feeling is discreditable to the minds inventing and prompting it
for their own private ends."</blockquote>

<p>Evidently the editor of the Perth paper had had a bad time of
it, for further on we find him still more bitter against any
communication being opened up with the sister colony. It must he
remembered that Western Australia was a free colony, and
consequently the bugbear of convict contamination was one that was
always raised when the subject of opening up a stock route with the
older colonies was on the board.</p>

<p>On the 18th June, 1840, Eyre's preparations were ready, and he
left Adelaide after a breakfast at Government House, when Captain
Sturt presented him with a flag&mdash;the Union Jack&mdash;worked
for the purpose by some of the ladies of the colony.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow him in detail to his former camp at
Mount Arden. He trusted that the range of hills he had called
Flinders Range, and which he had seen stretching to the north-east,
would continue far enough to take him out of the depressed country
around Lake Torrens, and in fact, as he says, form a stepping-stone
into the interior. His party was a small one for those days,
consisting of six white men and two black boys. They had with them
three horse drays, and a small vessel called the <i>Waterwitch</i>,
was sent to the head of the Gulf, with the heaviest portion of
their supplies.</p>

<p>On the arrival of this vessel, Eyre, with one black boy, made a
short trip to Lake Torrens, leaving the rest of the party to land
the stores.</p>

<p>He started without any great hopes, and, consequently, was not
much disappointed when he found this outpost of the inland sea to
be:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"...the dry bed of a lake coated over with a crust of salt,
forming one unbroken sheet of pure white, and glittering
brilliantly in the sun. On stepping upon this I found that it
yielded to the foot, and that below the surface the bed of the lake
consisted of a soft mud, and the further we advanced to the
westward the more boggy it got, so that at last it became quite
impossible to proceed, and I was obliged to return to the outer
margin of the lake without ascertaining whether there was water on
the surface of its bed further west or not."</blockquote>

<p>At this point Lake Torrens appeared to be about fifteen or
twenty miles across, having high land bounding it to the west.</p>

<p>The prospect, although half expected, was dismal in the extreme.
There was no chance of crossing the lake, and to follow its shore
to the north was impossible on account of the absence of grass and
water, the very rain water turning salt after lying a short time on
the saline ground. The only chance was in Flinder's Range supplying
them with a little feed and rain water in its ravines, so to this
range he struck.</p>

<p>It was a cheerless outlook. On one side was an impracticable
lake of combined mud and salt; in another a desert of bare and
barren plains; and on a third, a range of inhospitable rocks.</p>

<blockquote>"The very stones lying upon the hills looked like the scorched
and withered scoria of a volcanic region, and even the natives,
judging from the specimen I had seen to-day, partook of the general
misery and wretchedness of the place."</blockquote>

<p>Eyre steered for the most distant point of the northern range,
which on arrival he christened Mount Deception, as he had hoped
from its appearance that he would find water there, but in this he
was deceived. Subsisting as best they could on rain puddles on the
plains, they at last found a tolerably permanent hole in a small
creek, and then returned to the party at the head of the Gulf.</p>

<p>Arrived at the depôt, the cutter returned to Adelaide with
dispatches, and the provisions having been concealed, the whole
party made for the pool of water that Eyre and the boy had
discovered. From here the leader and the native boy made another
fruitless trip to the north-west, and although they at times
discovered a few creeks with a fair amount of water in them, the
2nd of September found Eyre on the top of a small hill, that he
appropriately named Mount Hopeless, gazing at the mysterious lake
that, as he thought, hemmed him in on three sides, even to the
east. There was no prospect visible of getting across this bed of
mud and mirage, nothing to do but leave the interior unvisited by
this route, and return to the Mount Arden depôt.</p>

<p>From the Mount Arden depôt he made his way down to Port Lincoln,
having finally decided to abandon his intended trip to the
interior, and go westward to King George's Sound, finding, perhaps,
some outlet to the north on the road.</p>

<p>He divided his party at the head of the Gulf, sending the
overseer with most of the stores and men straight across to Streaky
Bay, where he formerly bad made a depôt. At Port Lincoln he could
not obtain the supplies he wanted without sending to Adelaide; so
he was, therefore, detained some time, and on the 24th of October
started for Streaky Bay, the Governor having placed the
<i>Waterwitch</i> at his disposal for use in South Australian
waters. At Streaky Bay he rejoined his overseer, who had got across
the desert safely, and was anxiously expecting him. Making another
rendezvous with the cutter at Fowler's Bay, they separated to meet
again on the 20th of November.</p>

<p>Leaving his party encamped at Fowler's Bay, Eyre, with one
native boy, made an attempt to round the Bight, or rather to
ascertain what chance he had of taking his party round. He went two
days' journey, and finding neither grass nor water for his horses,
had to return to his camp. On the 28th he made another attempt,
taking with him a dray carrying seventy gallons of water; and on
the 30th they fell in with some natives, whom they thought to
induce to guide them to water; but the blacks made them understand
that there was none ahead, and so Eyre found to his cost, for,
still trying to discover some he reduced his horses so that it was
only with the greatest difficulty, and after the loss of three of
the best of them, that the party struggled back to some sandhills,
where they could obtain a little brackish water by digging; and on
the 16th, having had to send back for assistance, the explorers
re-assembled at Fowler's Bay, having done no good, and lost three
valuable horses. The cutter, still in attendance, was sent back to
Adelaide for a supply of oats and bran, and also to take back two
of the men, for Eyre had determined to reduce the number of his
people, awed by the nature of the country he had met with
ahead.</p>

<p>Tired out with the monotony of camp life, after the departure of
the cutter, he decided on another attempt, although one would have
thought the suffering his horses had already gone through would
have induced him to give them a longer rest.</p>

<p>On the 30th December he left camp, and that evening reached the
sandhills where he had before obtained the brackish water. Next
morning they found some natives, who told them once again that
there was no water ahead. On the 2nd January he made an attempt to
the north-west, undeterred by these warnings, but only got fourteen
miles when he had to send the horses back, and on the 5th, making
another effort from this point, only got on another seven miles.
Sending the dray and horses back, Eyre, with one white man and the
black boy, went on, having buried some casks of water against their
return. A terribly hot day set in, which so completely exhausted
the whole party, that they had to encamp on the sea shore until
night fell. The next morning he sent the man back, and pushing
ahead came upon some natives digging in the sand, and with their
aid watered the horses. They also showed them some more water
further on, and accompanied them to it. Beyond this point, they
said, there was no water for a ten days' journey.</p>

<p>Eyre rode on some distance, and having ascertained all he could
of the nature of the country at the head of the Bight, which he had
by this time passed, he returned to the party, and they all shifted
back to the old depôt, at Fowler's Bay, on the 20th January.</p>

<p>On the 25th the <i>Hero</i>, cutter, arrived (the
<i>Waterwitch</i> having sprung a leak), but her charter did not
extend beyond the boundary of South Australia, so that Eyre was
unable to use her to carry his heavy stores any further.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances he resolved to send nearly the whole of
his party back by the vessel, and push his way through to King
George's Sound, or perish.</p>

<p>In arriving at this determination, Eyre was evidently actuated
by a sense of such keen disappointment, at being baffled both to
the north and the west, that he could not bear the thought of
returning to Adelaide a beaten man. Whilst one can give a meed of
admiration to the obstinate courage that characterised this
resolution, we are also astonished at his persistence in a course
that, whilst inevitably entailing the greatest possible suffering
on men and horses, could lead to no good nor useful result. With
his small party and equipment it would at best be only a struggle
for life round the coast, giving no more information than had been
acquired by the marine surveys. Even the wild attempts of Grey look
comparatively reasonable beside this march of Eyre's, Had he had
any object in view beyond the one of being the first white man to
cross the desert between the two colonies, his actions might have
been excusable, but as it was, his trip was bound to be profitless
and resultless.</p>

<p>On the 31st January the cutter departed, and Eyre, the overseer,
Baxter, and three native boys, one having come by the <i>Hero</i>,
were left alone to face the eight hundred miles of desert solitude
before them.</p>

<p>On the 24th, after a long spell, when they were about to start,
the <i>Hero</i> returned, bringing a request to Mr. Eyre to abandon
his mad attempt and embark himself and party on board the cutter.
This he refused to do, and on the 25th made another departure.
After passing the water where they had met the natives, they
entered upon a dry and desolate tract over which they crossed in
safety, but with great suffering. Once more relieved by a native
well in the sandy beach, they pushed on, only to encounter evil
fortune; horse after horse knocked up, and it was after six days'
travelling they managed to get water once more, by digging in the
sand.</p>

<p>They were now about six hundred miles from King George's Sound
and in a most unenviable position, with the prospect of another one
hundred mile stage without water, and the full knowledge that
retreat was impossible. Their horses, in consequence of the
repeated sufferings from thirst that they had been forced to
undergo, were so spiritless and reduced that they could travel
scarcely any distance without giving in, and yet the worst was to
come. For some time the black boys had been very sullen and
discontented, the constant hardships and fatigue, added to what
they well-knew lay before them, told upon their spirits. Once they
ran away, but hunger forced them to return; even the scanty fare at
the camp was better than the slow starvation of the bush. The
overseer, too, was afflicted with low spirits, and impressed by the
forbidding character of their surroundings. Poor fellow, some
foreboding of his fate hung over him.</p>

<p>The toil that had to be gone through may be conceived by the
following short extract from Eyre's diary on March 11th, just after
accomplishing their first terrible stage after leaving the
depôt:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"At night the whole party were, by God's blessing, once more
together and in safety, after having passed over one hundred and
thirty-five miles of desert country, without a drop of water in its
whole extent, and at a season of the year the most unfavourable for
such an undertaking. In accomplishing this distance, the sheep had
been six and the horses five days without water, and both had been
almost wholly without food for the greater part of the time. The
little grass we found was so dry and withered that the parched and
thirsty animals could not eat it after the second day."</blockquote>

<p>From this camp Eyre started in the hope of shortly coming to a
second supply of water that the natives had told him of, and lured
on by this idea, he got forty miles from his camp without having
made the provision that he should have done before entering on a
very long stage. Coming to the conclusion that he must have passed
the water, he decided to send the horses back to the last camp for
a fresh supply before venturing further on. At midnight the
overseer and the natives started back, leaving Eyre to mind the
baggage with the scanty allowance of six pints of water to last him
for six days until their return. On the 26th of March they again
started, and at night reduced their baggage still more in the hope
of getting the tired horses through; and the next day everything
was abandoned, for still there was no prospect of water ahead.</p>

<p>On the night of the 29th the last drop of water that they had
with them was consumed, and the next morning water was obtained by
digging in the sand drift&mdash;their seventh day out, after
travelling, by Eyre's computation, one hundred and sixty miles. It
was not until the 27th of April that they left the camp, to enter
on the last fearful push that was to decide their fate&mdash;and
did too well decide the fate of three.</p>

<p>Once more the line of cliffs that had for a time been broken by
the sandhills faced the ocean, and from experience Eyre knew well
that he might expect no relief when travelling along their
summits.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 29th, the third night from their last
camp, Eyre took the first watch to look after the horses, as this
was necessary every night to prevent them rambling too far.</p>

<p>The night was cold, the wind blowing hard, and across the face
of the moon the scud kept rapidly driving. The horses wandered a
good deal, and kept separating in the scrub, giving the lonely man
much trouble to keep them together, and when his watch was nearly
up he headed them for the camp, intending to call the overseer to
relieve him, Suddenly the stillness of the desert was broken by the
report of a gun.</p>

<p>Eyre was not at first alarmed, thinking it a signal of Baxter's
to show him the position of the camp; he called out in reply, but
no answer was returned; and, hastening in the direction, was met by
one of the boys running towards him crying, "Oh massa, oh massa,
come here!" but beyond that could not speak for terror.</p>

<p>Eyre was soon at the camp, and a glance told him that he was now
indeed alone. Baxter, wounded to death, was lying on the ground in
his last agony, and as Eyre raised his faithful companion, then in
the convulsion of death, the frightful and appalling truth burst
upon him in its full horror.</p>

<blockquote>"At the dead hour of night, in the wildest and most inhospitable
waste of Australia, with the fierce wind raging in unison with the
scene of violence before me, I was left with a single native, whose
fidelity I could not rely upon, and who, for aught I knew, might be
in league with the other two, who, perhaps were, even now, lurking
about to take my life, as they had done that of the overseer. Three
days had passed away since we left the last water, and it was very
doubtful when we might find any more. Six hundred miles of country
had to be traversed before I could hope to obtain the slightest aid
or assistance of any kind, whilst I knew not that a single drop of
water, or an ounce of flour, had been left by these murderers, from
a stock that had previously, been so small."</blockquote>

<p>On examining the camp, Eyre found that the two boys had carried
off both double-barrelled guns, all the baked bread, and other
stores, and a keg of water. All he had left was a rifle with a ball
jammed in the barrel, four gallons of water, forty pounds of flour,
and a little tea and sugar.</p>

<p>When he had time to collect his thoughts, Eyre judged from the
position of the body, that Baxter must have been disturbed by the
boys plundering the camp, and getting up to stop them, had been
immediately shot. His next care was to put his rifle in serviceable
condition, and then as morning broke they hastened away from the
fatal camp. It was impossible even to bury the body of his murdered
companion; one vast unbroken surface of sheet rock extended for
miles in every direction. Well might Eyre exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Though years have now passed away since the enactment of this
tragedy, the dreadful horrors of that time and scene are recalled
before me with frightful vividness, and make me shudder even now
when I think of them. A lifetime was crowded into those few short
hours, and death alone may blot out the impressions they
produced."</blockquote>

<p>That evening the two murderers re-appeared in the scrub,
following the white man and boy. Eyre attempted to get close to
them, but they would not come near, remaining at a distance,
calling out to the remaining boy (Wylie), who, however, refused to
go to them. Finding himself unable to get to close quarters with
them, Eyre proceeded on his journey, and the two boys were never
seen again, and, without doubt, they soon perished miserably of
hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>At last, after being again seven days without water for the
horses, they reached the end of the long line of cliffs, and
amongst the sand dunes came again to a native well, and got their
poor tortured horses a drink.</p>

<p>Moving on now in easier stages, and getting water by digging at
the foot of the different sand hills he encountered, Eyre proceeded
on with better hopes for the future; he felt confident that he was
past the great belt of and country, and that with every day the
travelling would improve.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, another horse was killed, and a supply of
meat dried to carry with them.</p>

<p>From this point water was more frequently met with, a decided
change for the better took place in the face of the country, and
the wretched horses they still had left began to pick up a little.
At last, when their rations were quite exhausted, they sighted a
ship at anchor in Thistle Cove. She turned out to be the
<i>Mississippi</i>, whaler, Captain Rossitur, and once more Eyre
had to thank fortune for relief at a critical moment.</p>

<p>For ten days he forgot his sufferings, and regained some of his
lost strength, under the hospitable care of Captain Rossitur, who,
it will be remembered, was the first foreigner to anchor in Port
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Provided with fresh clothes and provisions, with his horses
newly shod, Eyre recommenced his pilgrimage, and arrived in King
George's Sound on July 8th. Having successfully crossed from Port
Lincoln to King George's Sound, with incredible suffering, not
alone to himself, but also to his men and horses, so far as they
accompanied him; added to which, his obstinate persistence, led to
the death of Baxter, who, against his own convictions, went on with
him, rather than leave him in his need.</p>

<p>It is generally said with regard to this journey of Eyre's, that
it any rate established the fact that no considerable creek flowed
from the interior to the south coast. But this had been pretty
well-known before by the maritime surveys, for it must be borne in
mind that this portion of the Australian shore in no way resembles
the general coast line of Australia. Granted that numbers of the
largest rivers in the continent were overlooked by the navigators,
we must also remember that the conditions here were. essentially
different. No fringe of low mangrove covered flats, studded with
inlets and salt-water creeks, masking the entrance of a river, was
here to be found. A bold outline of barren cliffs, or a clean-swept
sandy shore, alone fronted the ocean, and Flinders, constantly on
the alert as he always was for anything approaching an outlet or
river mouth, would scarcely have missed one here. As for any
knowledge of the interior that was gained, of course there was
none, even the conjectures of a worn out, starving man, picking his
way painfully around the sea shore, would have scarcely been of
much value. Eyre has, however secured for himself a name for
courage and perseverance, under the most terrible circumstances
that could well beset a man, and this qualification leads us to
overlook his errors of judgment. The picture of the lonely
man&mdash;not separated from his fellow creatures by the sea, as
has often been the case, but by countless miles of weary, untrodden
waste, in his plundered camp, beside his murdered
companion&mdash;is one that for peculiar horror, can never be
surpassed.</p>

<p>Eyre was warmly welcomed on his return to Adelaide, and he was
subsequently appointed police magistrate on the Murray, where his
experience and knowledge of the natives was of great service. When
Sturt started on his memorable trip to the central desert, he
accompanied him for a long distance; but his active nature found
vent in other fields than those of exploration in future.</p>

<p>Eyre was a man who was thoroughly distinguished by his love for
the aborigines. In after life he was appointed their protector on
the Murray, at the time when the continual skirmishes between the
natives and the overlanders used to be a matter of almost daily
occurrence.</p>

<p>The courage that he had exemplified, and his wonderful march
round the Great Bight, was brought into force again and again, in
efforts to keep peace between the rival races. The blacks of the
Murray Bend were always notable for their warlike character, and
Eyre was the most fitting man that could have been selected for the
post.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Disappointing as all the attempts to penetrate to the north had
been, the South Australians did not by any means abandon their
efforts, either public or private, to ascertain the nature and
value of the interior. The supposed horseshoe formation of Lake
Torrens, presenting thus an impassable barrier, was discouraging,
but hopes were entertained that breaks in it would be found that
would afford a passage across; and beyond, the country might prove
of a less repellent character than the district immediately around
the lake.</p>

<p>But the east coast and the country at the back of the new
settlement of Moreton Bay, now commands our attention, Such an
important discovery as that made by Cunningham of the Darling
Downs, needless to say, attracted the attention of the graziers of
the settled districts in search of fresh pastures. The country west
of the Darling having received such an unfavourable name from the
explorers who had made any efforts beyond it. The westward march of
the overlanders was checked in that direction, and their stock
spread to the north, south, and south-cast.</p>

<p>In March 1840, Patrick Leslie, who has always been considered
the father of settlement on the Darling Downs, left an outside
station in New England, and after a short inspection of the scene
of Cunningham's discovery, finally, in the middle of the year,
settled down on the Condamine.</p>

<p>In 1841 the Condamine River was followed for a hundred miles by
Messrs. Stuart and Sydenham Russell, from below Jimbour, the
northernmost station on a Darling Downs creek; and on the return
journey some of the party made an attempt to cross the range to the
Wide Bay district, but were prevented by the scrub. In the
following month, November, the flow of the Condamine was again
picked up in the space below Turnmervil, the lowest station on a
creek above Jimbour, and the channel of the river distinguished,
where it was formerly supposed to have been for awhile lost. An
extensive tract of rich grazing country was found open and
well-watered by anabranches, with lagoons in their beds. This
district has ever since borne the well-known name of Cecil Plains,
then bestowed on it.</p>

<p>In 1842 Stuart Russell went from Moreton Bay to Wide Bay in a
boat, and made an examination of some of the streams there emptying
into the sea. Amongst other adventures the party picked up with an
escaped convict who had been fourteen years with the blacks. During
the same year Stuart Russell explored the country from Wide Bay to
the Boyne (not the river named by Oxley in Port Curtis), and
subsequently followed and laid down this stream throughout,
crossing from inland waters on to the head of it. Russell's work in
opening up so much available country, is a fair sample of the
private explorations before referred to, which fill up such a large
space of the record of discovery, and yet have received so little
recognition that the remembrance of most of them has been quite
lost, or preserved in such a way as to be hardly looked upon as
reliable history.</p>

<p>We are now approaching a period when the exploration of the
continent was an object of absorbing interest to all the
settlements fast growing into importance on the southern and
eastern coasts. Three explorers, who may be classed as the
greatest, the most successful, and the one whose star that rose so
bright at this time was doomed to set in misfortune, were in the
field at the same time. Charles Sturt, fated once more to meet and
be defeated (if such a gallant struggle can be called defeat) by
the inexorable desert and the stern denial of its climate. Thomas
Mitchell, again the favoured of fortune, to wend his way by
well-watered streams and grassy downs and plains. And Ludwig
Leichhardt, to accomplish his one great journey through the country
permeated by the rivers of the eastern and northern coast. But
before starting in company with these deathless names, we must, for
a while, return to Lake Torrens.</p>

<p>Eyre, it will be remembered, reached, after much labour, a hill
to the north east at the termination of the range, which he named
Mount Hopeless. From the view he obtained from the summit, he
concluded that Lake Torrens completely enclosed the northern
portion of the province of South Australia; and in fact that the
province had once been an island, as the low-lying plains probably
joined the flat country west of the Darling.</p>

<p>In 1843, the then Surveyor-General of the colony, Captain Frome,
started to the north to ascertain as much of this mysterious lake
as he could. He reached Mount Serle, and found the dry bed of the
great lake to the eastward, as described by Eyre, but discovered an
error of thirty miles in its position, Eyre having placed it too
far to the eastward. Further north than this, Frome did not
proceed; on his way back lie made two excursions to the eastward,
but found nothing but sterile and unpromising country. He confirmed
then, the existence of a lake to the eastward of the southern point
of Lake Torrens, but his explorations did not go far to determine
the identity of the two, nor their uninterrupted continuity. Prior
to this, a series of explorations, followed by settlement, had
taken place east and west of Eyre's track, between Adelaide and the
head of Spencer's Gulf. One promising expedition was nipped in the
bud by the accidental death of the leader, a rising young explorer,
who had already won his spurs in opening up fresh country in the
province. This was Mr. J. Horrocks, who formed a plan for
travelling up the western side of Lake Torrens, and then, if
possible, making westward and trying to reach the Swan River. This
expedition is especially noteworthy as being the first one in which
a camel was made use of, and to Horrocks, is due the credit of
first introducing these animals as baggage carriers. When at the
head of the Gulf, and about to grapple with the unknown land to the
west, his gun accidentally went off, and he received the charge in
his face. He lived to return to the station, but died a few days
afterwards.</p>

<p>Amongst the other pioneers who contributed more or less to
spread settlement in the province, and succeeded, may be mentioned
Messrs. Hawker, Hughes, Campbell, Robinson, and Heywood.</p>

<p>Perhaps, of all the journeys into the interior, none have
excited more sustained interest than Sturt's. It must be admitted
that his account, however truthful it may have appeared to him at
the time, is misleading, and overdrawn. But whilst saying this let
us look at the circumstances under which he received the
impressions he has put on record.</p>

<p>He was a thoroughly broken and disappointed man; for six months
he had been shut up in his weary depôt prison, debarred from making
any attempt to complete his work, watching his friend and companion
die slowly before his eyes. When the kindly rains released him, he
was turned back and constantly back by a strip of desert country,
that seemed to dog him whichever way he turned. No wonder he fairly
hated the place, and looked at all things through the heated,
treacherous haze of the desert plains.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he speaks of the awful temperature that
rendered life unbearable, and the inland slopes of Australia
unfitted for human habitation, it must be recalled that the party
were weak and suffering, liable to feel oppressive heat or extreme
cold, more keenly than strong and healthy men. In the ranges where
Sturt spent his summer months of detention, there is now one of the
wonderful mining townships of Australia, where men toil as
laboriously as in a temperate zone, and the fires of the battery
and the smelting furnace burn steadily day and night, in sight of
the spot where Poole lies buried. And at the lower levels of the
shafts trickle the waters of subterranean streams that Sturt never
dreamt of. But though baffled, and unable to gain the goal he
strove for, never did man better deserve success. His instructions
were to reach the centre of the continent, to discover whether
range or sea existed there; and if the former, to note the flow of
the northern waters, but on no account to follow them down to the
northern sea. As usual, the Home Office, in their official wisdom,
knew more than did the colonists, and instructed him to proceed by
way of Mount Arden; the route already tried and abandoned by
Eyre.</p>

<p>Sturt chose to proceed by the Darling. His plan was to follow
that river up as far as the Williorara or Laidley's Ponds, a small
western tributary of the Darling, opposite the point were Mitchell
turned back, in 1835, after his conflict with the natives. Thence
he intended to strike north-west, hoping thus to avoid the gloomy
environs of Lake Torrens, and its treacherous bed.</p>

<p>At Moorundi, on the Murray, he was met by Eyre, then resident
magistrate at that place, and here the party mustered and made
their start.</p>

<p>Sturt was accompanied by Poole, as second in command, Browne,
who was a thorough bushman and an excellent surgeon, accompanied
him as a friend; with them also went McDouall Stuart, as draftsman,
whose fame as an explorer afterwards equalled that of his leader,
besides twelve men, eleven horses, thirty bullocks, one boat and
boat carriage, one horse dray, one spring cart, three bullock
drays, two hundred sheep, four kangaroo dogs, and two sheep
dogs.</p>

<p>Eyre accompanied the expedition as far as Lake Victoria, which
point they reached on the 10th of September, 1844. Here Eyre left
them, and on the 11th of October the explorers arrived at
Williorara, the place where they intended leaving the Darling for
the interior. The appearance of this watercourse very much
disappointed Sturt, he had hoped from the account of the natives to
find in it a fair-sized creek, heading from a low range, distantly
visible to the north-west; instead, he found it a mere channel for
the flood water of the Darling, distributing it into some shallow
lakes, back from the river, a distance of some eight or nine miles,
Sturt, as a first step dispatched Poole and Stuart to the range, to
see if they could obtain any view of the country to the north-west.
They were absent four days, and returned with the rather startling
intelligence, that from the top of a peak in the range, Poole had
seen a large lake studded with islands.</p>

<p>Although in his published journal, written long afterwards,
Sturt makes light of Poole's fancied lake, which, of course, was
the effect of mirage, at that time his ardent fancy made him
believe that he was on the eve of a great discovery. In a letter to
Mr. Morphett, of Adelaide, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Poole has just returned from the ranges. I have not
time to write over again. He says there are high ranges to the N.
and N.W., and water, a sea extending along the horizon from S.W. by
S., and ten E. of N., in which there are a number of islands and
lofty ranges as far as the eye can reach. What is all this? Are we
to be prosperous? I hope so, and I am sure you do. To-morrow we
start for the ranges, and then for the waters, the strange waters,
on which boat never swam, and over which flag never floated. But
both shall ere long. We have the heart of the interior laid open to
us, and shall be off with a flowing, sheet in a few days. Poole
says the sea was a deep blue, and that in the midst of it was a
conical island of great height. When will you hear from me
again?"</blockquote>

<p>Poor Sturt! no boat of his was ever to float on that visionary
sea, nor his flag to wave over its dream waters.</p>

<p>The whole of the party now removed to a small shallow lake, the
termination of the Williorara Channel. From here he started on an
excursion to the more distant ranges reported by Poole, accompanied
by Browne and two men, went ahead for the purpose of finding water
of a sufficient permanency to remove the whole of the party, as at
the lake where they were encamped there was always the chance of
becoming embroiled with the natives. He was successful in finding
what he wanted, and on the 4th of November the main body of the
expedition removed there, now finally leaving the waters of the
Darling.</p>

<p>The next day, Sturt and Browne, with three men and the cart,
started on another trip in search of water ahead. This they found
in small quantities, and rain coming on, Sturt returned and sent
Poole out again to search, whilst the camp was moved on. On his
return he reported having seen some shallow, brackish lakes, and
caught sight of Eyre's Mount Serle. They were now on the western
slope of the Barrier Ranges, and but for the providential discovery
of a fine creek to the north, would have been unable to retain
their position. To this creek (Flood's Creek) they removed the
camp, and Sturt congratulated himself on the steady and
satisfactory progress he was making. They now left the Barrier
Range, and made for one further north, staying for some ten days at
a small lagoon, during which time an examination of the country
ahead was made.</p>

<p>On the 27th January, 1845, they removed to a creek, heading from
a small range; at the head of this creek was a fine supply of
permanent water, and here the explorers pitched their tents, little
thinking that it would be the 17th of July following before they
would be struck. Perhaps a short description from Sturt's pen will
aid the reader's imagination in picturing the situation of the
party.</p>

<blockquote>"It was not, however, until after we had run down every
creek in the neighbourhood, and had traversed the country in every
direction, that the truth flashed across my mind, and it became
evident to me that we were locked up in the desolate and heated
region into which we had penetrated as effectually as if we had
wintered at the Pole. It was long indeed ere I could bring myself
to believe that so great a misfortune had overtaken us, but so it
was. Providence had, in its all wise purposes, guided us to the
only spot in that wide-spread desert, where our wants could have
been permanently supplied, but had there stayed our further
progress into a region that almost appears to be forbidden
ground."</blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<blockquote>"The creek was marked by a line of gum-trees, from the
mouth of the glen to its junction with the main branch, in which,
excepting in isolated spots, water was no longer to be found. The
Red Hill (afterwards called Mount Poole) bore N. N.W. from us,
distant three and a-half miles; between us and it there were
undulating plains, covered with stones or salsolaceous herbage,
excepting in the hollows wherein there was a little grass. Behind
us were level stony plains, with small sandy undulations bounded by
brush, over which the Black Hill was visible, distant ten miles,
bearing S.S.E. from the Red Hill. To the eastward, the country was
as I have described it, hilly. Westward at a quarter of a mile the
low range, through which Depôt Creek forces itself, shut out from
our view the extensive plains on which it rises."</blockquote>

<p>This then was Sturt's prison, although at first he had not
realised that in spite of every precaution, his retreat was cut off
until the next rainfall.</p>

<p>Of Sturt's existence and occupation during this dreary period
little can be said. He tried in every direction, until convinced of
the uselessness of so doing, sometimes encouraged and led on by
shallow pools in some fragmentary creek bed, at others, seeing
nothing before him but hopeless aridity. Now, too, he found himself
attacked with what he then thought was rheumatism, but proved to be
scurvy, and Poole and Browne too were afflicted in the same
way.</p>

<p>We now come to one of the picturesque incidents that Sturt has
introduced in his narrative, and that help to fix on our memory the
strangely weird picture of the lonely band of men confronted with
the unaccustomed forces of nature in this wilderness.</p>

<blockquote>"As we rode across the stony plain lying between us and
the hills, the heated and parching blasts that came upon us, were
more than we could bear. We were in the centre of the plain, when
Mr. Browne drew my attention to a number of small black specks in
the upper air. These spots increasing momentarily in size, were
evidently approaching us rapidly. In an incredibly short space of
time, we were surrounded by hundreds of the common kite, stooping
down to within a few feet of us, and then turning away after having
eyed us steadily. Several approached us so closely, that they threw
themselves back to avoid contact, opening their beaks and spreading
out their talons. The long flight of these birds, reaching from the
ground into the heavens, put me strongly in mind of one of Martin's
beautiful designs, in which he produces the effect of distance by a
multitude of objects vanishing from the view."</blockquote>

<p>Sturt, during his detention in the depôt, made one desperate
attempt to the north, when he succeeded in getting a mile above the
28th parallel, but found nothing to repay him for his trouble.</p>

<p>And so week after week of this fearful monotony passed on
without hardly a break or change.</p>

<p>Once, an old native wandered to their camp. He was starving and
thirsty, looking a fit being to emerge from the gaunt waste around
them. The dogs attacked him when he approached, but he stood his
ground and fought them valiantly until they were called off; his
whole demeanour was calm and courageous, and he showed neither
surprise nor timidity. He drank greedily when water was given him,
and ate voraciously, but whence he came the men could not divine
nor could he explain to them. He accepted what was given to him, as
a right expected by one fellow-being from another, cut off in the
desert from their own kin. While he stopped at their camp he showed
that he knew the use of the boat, explaining that it was upside
down, as of course it was, and pointing to the N.W. as the place
where they would want it, raising poor Sturt's hopes once more.
After a fortnight he departed as he came, saying he would come
back, but he never did.</p>

<blockquote>"With him," says Sturt pathetically, "all our hopes
vanished, for even the presence of this savage was soothing to us,
and so long as he remained we indulged in anticipations as to the
future. From the time of his departure a gloomy silence pervaded
the camp; we were, indeed, placed under the most trying
circumstances, everything combined to depress our spirits and
exhaust our patience. We had witnessed migration after migration of
the feathered tribes, to that point to which we were so anxious to
push our way. Flights of cockatoos, of parrots, of pigeons, and of
bitterns; birds, also, whose notes had cheered us in the
wilderness, all had taken the same high road to a better and more
hospitable region."</blockquote>

<p>And now the water began to sink with frightful rapidity, and
they all thought that the end was surely coming. Hoping against
hope, Sturt laid his plans to start as soon as the drought broke
up, himself to proceed north and west whilst poor Poole, reduced to
a frightful condition by scurvy, was to be sent carefully back as
the only means of saving his life.</p>

<p>On the 12th and 13th of July the rain commenced, and the siege
was raised, but Poole never lived to profit by it. Every
arrangement for his comfort was made that the circumstances
permitted, but on the first day's journey he died, and they brought
his body back to the depôt and made his lonely grave there. Sturt's
way was now open. After burying his lamented friend, he again
dispatched the party that was selected to return home, and, with
renewed hope, made preparations for the northwest. He first,
however, removed the depôt to a better grassed locality, water
being now plentiful everywhere. During a short western trip, on the
4th August they found themselves on the edge of an immense shallow
and sandy basin, in which were detached sheets of water, "as blue
as indigo and as salt as brine." This they took to be Lake Torrens,
and returned to the depôt to arrange matters for a final
departure.</p>

<p>Stuart was left in charge of the depôt, Browne accompanying
Sturt; and on the 14th a start was made. For some days, owing to
the pools of surface water left by the recent rain, they had no
difficulty in keeping a straightforward course. The country passed
over consisted of large level plains and long sand ridges, but they
crossed numerous creeks and found more or less water in all of
them, and finally got into a well-grassed, pleasing looking
country, which greatly cheered them with a prospect of success,
when, suddenly, they were confronted by a wall of sand, and for
nearly twenty miles toiled over succeeding ridges. Fortunately,
they found both water and feed, but their hopes received a sudden
and complete downfall. Nor did a walk to the extremity of one of
the sand ridges serve to raise their spirits. Sturt saw before him
an immense plain, of a dark purple hue, with its horizon like that
of the sea, boundless in the direction in which he wished to
proceed. This was the Stony Desert. That night they camped in it,
and the next morning came to an earthy plain, with here and there a
few bushes of polygonum growing beside some stray channel, in some
of which they, luckily, found a little muddy rain water still left.
When they camped at night they sighted, for a short time, some
hills to the north, and, on examining them through the telescope,
saw dark shadows on their faces as if produced by cliffs. Next day
they made for these hills, in the hope of finding a change of
country and feed for their horses; but they were disappointed. Sand
ridges in terrible array once more rose up before them. "Even the
animals," says Sturt, "appeared to regard them with dismay."</p>

<p>Over plains and sand dunes, the former full of yawning cracks
and holes, the party pushed on, subsisting on precarious pools of
muddy water and fast-sinking native wells; until, on the 3rd of
September, Flood, the stockman, who was riding ahead, held up his
hat and called aloud to them that a large creek was in sight.</p>

<p>On coming up the others saw a beautiful watercourse, the bed of
which was full of grass and water. This creek Sturt called Eyre's
Creek, and it was one of the most important discoveries he made in
this region. Along this watercourse they made easy stages until the
7th, when the creek was lost, and the water in the lagoons near the
bank was found to be intensely salt. After repeated efforts to
continue his journey, which only led him amongst the everlasting
sand hills, separated by plains encrusted with salt, Sturt came to
the erroneous conclusion that he was at the head of the creek, and
further progress impossible. Had he but known it, he was within
reach of permanently watered rivers, along which he could have
travelled as far north as he wished. But there was neither sign nor
clue afforded him; his men were sick, and his retreat to the depôt
most precarious; there was nothing for it but to fall back again,
and after a toilsome journey they reached the depôt, or Fort Grey
as they had christened it, on the 2nd October.</p>

<p>Sturt now made up his mind for a final effort due north, and in
company with Stuart and two fresh men, he started on the 9th of
October; and on the second day reached Strzelecki Creek, which was
the name they had given to the first creek crossed on their late
expedition. On the 13th, they arrived at the banks of a magnificent
channel with grassy banks, fine trees and abundant water; this was
the now well-known Cooper's Creek, one of the most important rivers
of the interior, its tributaries draining the southern slopes of
the dividing watershed in the north.</p>

<p>Sturt on reaching this unexpected discovery was uncertain
whether to follow its course to the eastward, or persevere in his
original intention of pushing to the north. A thunder storm falling
at the time made him adhere to his original course, and defer the
examination of the new river until his return. In seven days after
leaving Cooper's Creek, he had the negative satisfaction, as he
expected, of gazing over the dreary waste of the stony desert,
unchanged and forbidding as ever. They crossed it, and were again
turned back by sand hill and salt plain, and forced to retrace
their steps to Cooper's Creek. This creek Sturt followed upward for
many days, but finding it did not take him in the direction he
desired to go, and moreover, the large broad channel that they
first came to, became divided into many small ones, which ran
through flooded plains, making the travelling most tiring on their
exhausted horses; he reluctantly turned back. They had found the
creek well populated with natives, and the prospects of getting on
were apparently better than they had ever met with before, but both
Sturt and his men were weak and ill, and his horses thoroughly
tired out, and also he was not sure of his retreat.</p>

<p>Following Cooper's Creek back, they found that the water had
dried up so rapidly that grave fears were entertained that
Strzelecki's Creek, their main reliance in going back to the depôt,
would be dry. Fortunately, they were in time to find a little muddy
fluid left, just enough to serve them. Here they experienced a hot
wind that forced them to camp the whole day, although most anxious
to get on.</p>

<blockquote>"We had scarcely got there," writes Sturt, "when the
wind, which had been blowing all the morning hot from the
north-east, increased to a gale, and I shall never forget its
withering effects. I sought shelter behind a large gum tree, but
the blasts of heat were so terrific, that I wondered the very grass
did not take fire. This really was nothing ideal; everything, both
animate and inanimate, gave way before it; the horses stood with
their backs to the wind, and their noses to the ground, without the
muscular strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and
the leaves of the tree under which we were sitting, fell like a
snow shower around us. At noon, I took a thermometer, graduated to
127 degrees, out of my box, and observed that the mercury was up to
125. Thinking that it had been unduly influenced, I put it in the
fork of a tree close to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the
sun. In this position I went to examine it about an hour
afterwards, when I found that the mercury had risen to the top of
the instrument, and that its further expansion had burst the bulb,
a circumstance that, I believe, no traveller has had to recount
before."</blockquote>

<p>Let the reader remember when reading the above description,
which has been so much quoted, that the man who wrote it was in
such a weakened condition, that he had no energy left to withstand
the hot wind, and that the shade they were cowering under was of
the scantiest description.</p>

<p>They had still a journey of eighty-six miles, back to Fort Grey,
with little prospect of any water being found on the way. After a
long and weary ride they reached it only to find that, owing to the
bad state of the water, Browne had been compelled to fall back on
to their old camp at the Depôt Glen.</p>

<blockquote>"We reached the plain just as the sun was descending,
without having dismounted from our horses for fifteen hours, and as
we rode down the embankment into it, looked around for the cattle,
but none were to be seen. We looked towards the little sandy mound
on which the tents had stood, but no white objects there met our
eye; we rode slowly up to the stockade and found it silent and
deserted. I was quite sure that Mr. Browne had had urgent reasons
for retiring. I had, indeed, anticipated the measure. I hardly
hoped to find him at the Fort, and had given him instructions on
the subject of his removal; yet, a sickening feeling came over me
when I saw that he was really gone; not on my own account, for,
with the bitter feelings of disappointment with which I was
returning home, I could calmly have laid my head on that desert,
never to raise it again."</blockquote>

<p>Riding day and night, Sturt at last reached the encampment, so
exhausted as to be hardly able to stand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"When I dismounted, I had nearly fallen forward.
Thinking that one of the kangaroo dogs, in his greeting, had pushed
me between the legs, I turned round to give him a slap, but no dog
was there, and I soon found out that what I had felt was nothing
more than strong muscular action, brought on by
riding."</blockquote>

<p>Now came the question of their final escape. The water in the
Depôt Creek was so much reduced that they feared that there would
be none left in Flood's Creek, and if so, they were once more
imprisoned. Browne undertook the long ride of one hundred and
eighteen miles, which was to decide the question. Preparations had
to be made for his journey by filling a bullock skin with water,
and sending a dray with it as far as possible; and on the eighth
day he returned.</p>

<blockquote>"'Well Browne,' said Sturt, who was helpless in his
tent, 'what news? Is it to be good or bad?' 'there is still water
in the creek,' replied Browne, 'but that is all I can say; what
there is, is as black as ink, and we must make haste, for in a week
it will be gone.'"</blockquote>

<p>The boat that was to have floated on the inland sea, was left to
rot at the Depôt Glen, all the heaviest of the stores abandoned.,
and the retreat of over two hundred miles to the Darling
commenced.</p>

<p>More bullock skins were fashioned into bags, to carry water for
the stock, and with their aid, and that of a kindly shower of rain,
they crossed the dry stage to Flood's Creek in safety. Here they
found the vegetation more advanced, and with care, and constant
activity in looking out for water on ahead, they gradually left
behind them the scene of their labours and approached the Darling;
Sturt having to be carried on one of the drays, and lifted on and
off at each stoppage.</p>

<p>On the 21st December, they arrived at the camp of the relief
party, under Piesse, at Williorara, and Sturt's last expedition
came to an end.</p>

<p>As he has often been termed the father of Australian
exploration, it may be as well to look back on the result of his
life-long labours. His burning desire to reach the heart of the
continent had constantly led him into dangers and difficulties that
other explorers shunned, and unfortunate as he always was in his
seasons, he brought back a forbidding report of the, usefulness of
the country he had discovered, which led to its gradual settlement,
only after long years had passed, and men had grown accustomed to
the desert, and laughed at its terrors; finding that experience
robbed them of their first effect.</p>

<p>Sturt found the Darling, and traced the Murray to its mouth,
thus discovering the great arteries of the water system of the most
populated part of Australia, leaving the details to be filled in by
others. In the interior he was the finder of Eyre's Creek and
Cooper's Creek; one of the tributaries of the latter. was soon
afterwards discovered by Mitchell, and named by him the Victoria,
now called the Barcoo. In these two creeks, as he called them, on
account of the absence of flowing water in their beds, Sturt
unwittingly crossed the second and only other great inland river
system of the continent. In the basin he traversed, in which these
creeks lost their character, he was riding over the united beds of
the Barcoo, the Thomson, the Diamentina, and the Herbert, west of
whose waters nothing in the shape of a defined system of drainage
exists, until the rivers of the western coast are reached. As a
scientific explorer then, whose object was to unravel the mystery
of the interior, solve, if possible, the question of its strange
peculiarity, and trace out its physical formation, Sturt may well
be held the first and greatest. His success, perhaps, was greater
than he himself imagined, he came back dispirited with failure but
as before he had found the broad outlines of the plan of the
drainage of the great plains, to be afterwards completed by the
discoveries of the tributary streams.</p>

<p>In addition to his longing to be the first to reach the centre
of Australia, Sturt fondly hoped that once past the southern zone
of the tropics, he would find himself in a country blessed with a
heavier and more constant rainfall; as it was impossible for him to
know at that time, that the force of the north-west monsoon was
expended on the northern coast, and none of the tropical deluge
found its way with any degree of regularity to the thirsty inland
slope; this theory appeared on the face of it, feasible. Although
an after knowledge may have now enabled us to see the mistakes he
made, and to regard his descriptions of the uninhabitable nature of
the interior as exaggerated, it must be admitted that others in the
same place and circumstances would have made similar errors, and
drawn equally false conclusions.</p>

<p>In taking leave of this explorer, another short extract from his
journal will best show the character of the man of whom Australians
should be so justly proud.</p>

<blockquote>"Circumstances may yet arise to give a value to my
recent labours, and my name may be remembered by after generations
in Australia, as the first who tried to penetrate to its centre. If
I failed in that great object, I have one consolation in the
retrospect of my past services. My path amongst savage tribes has
been a bloodless one, not but that I have often been placed in
situations of risk and danger, when I might have been justified in
shedding blood, but I trust I have ever made allowances for human
timidity, and respected the customs of the rudest
people."</blockquote>

<p>The next prominent figure in the history of this time is
Leichhardt, whose unknown fate has been the cause of so much
sentiment clinging about his name.</p>

<p>Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt arrived in the colony in 1842, and
travelled to Moreton Bay overland, where he occupied himself for
two years in short excursions in the neighbourhood, pursuing his
favourite study of physical science. Leichhardt was born in Beskow,
near Berlin, and studied in Berlin. Through a neglect, he was
excluded from the one-year military service, and thereby induced to
escape from the three-yearly service. The consequence was, that he
was pursued as a deserter and sentenced <i>in contumaciam</i>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Alexander Von Humboldt succeeded, by representing
his services to science on his first expedition in Australia, in
obtaining a pardon from the King. By a Cabinet order Leichhardt
received permission to return to Prussia unpunished. This order,
whether of any value to Leichhardt or not, came too late. When it
arrived in Australia he had already started on his last
expedition.</p>

<p>When the expedition was projected from Fort Bourke, on the
Darling, to the Gulf of Carpentaria or Port Essington, he was
desirous of securing the position of naturalist thereon; the delay
in the starting of it disappointed him, and he made up his mind to
attempt one on his own account, a project in which he received
little encouragement. He persevered, however, and eking out his own
resources, by means of private contributions he managed to get a
party together, and on the 1st of October, 1844, he left Jimbour,
on the Darling Downs, with six whites and two blacks, 17 horses, 16
head of cattle, and four kangaroo dogs; his other supplies being
proportionately meagre.</p>

<p>As Leichhardt's journal of this trip has been so widely read,
and as it does not possess the same striking interest as that of
Sturt's, from the more accessible nature of the country travelled
through, and the absence of the constantly threatening dangers
overhanging both Sturt and Eyre, a shorter account of the progress
of the expedition will be found most acceptable.</p>

<p>His plan of starting from the Moreton Bay district, and
proceeding to Port Essington, differed considerably from that
proposed by Sir Thomas Mitchell. The course adopted by Leichhardt,
although longer and more roundabout than that suggested from Fort
Bourke, would be safer for his little band, keeping as it would,
more to the well-watered coastal districts, and avoiding the
constant separations entailed upon parties traversing the
interior.</p>

<p>Leaving the head waters of the Condamine, the river which
receives so many of the tributary streams of the Darling Downs,
Leichhardt struck a river, which he named the Dawson, thence he
passed westward, on to the fine country of the Peak Downs, whereon
he named the minor waters of the Comet, Planet, and Zamia
Creeks.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1845, the Mackenzie River was
discovered, and here the Doctor and the black boy, Charlie, managed
to get lost for two or three days, a faculty which apparently most
of the party happily possessed. Following up the Isaacs River, a
tributary of the Fitzroy, they crossed the head of it on to the
Suttor; the only variation in the monotonous record of the daily
travel being the occasional capture of game, and the mutinous
conduct of the two black boys, who at various times essayed to
leave the party and shift for themselves, but were on each occasion
glad to return.</p>

<p>Following down the Suttor, they arrived at the Burdekin, the
largest river on the east coast, discovered by Leichhardt, up the
valley of which they travelled, until they crossed the dividing
watershed between the waters of the east coast and the Gulf of
Carpentaria, on to the head of the Lynd, which river they followed
to its junction with the Mitchell. Finding the course of this river
leading them too high north, on the eastern shore of the Gulf, they
left it, and struck to the sea coast, intending to follow round the
southern coast at a reasonable distance inland. Up to this time
they had been so little troubled by the natives, that they had
ceased almost to think of meeting with any hostility from them.</p>

<p>On the night of the 28th June, 1845, they were encamped at a
chain of shallow lagoons, when soon after seven o'clock, a shower
of spears was thrown into the camp, wounding Messrs. Roper and
Calvert, and killing Mr. Gilbert instantly. So unprepared were the
party, that the guns were uncapped, and it was some time before
three or four discharges made the blacks take to their heels. The
body of the naturalist was buried at the camp, but his grave was
unmarked, as in order to prevent the blacks from disinterring it, a
large fire was lit over the grave to hide its site.</p>

<p>From this unfortunate camp the party proceeded slowly with the
two wounded men for some days. A strange incident, scarcely
credible, happened during their tramp round the Gulf. One night a
blackfellow walked deliberately up to the fire round which the
party were assembled, having seemingly mistaken it for his own. On
discovering his mistake, he immediately climbed up a tree, and
raised a horrible din, lamenting, sobbing, and crying, until they
all removed to a short distance and afforded him a chance of which
he eagerly availed himself, of escaping.</p>

<p>Leichhardt followed round the Gulf shores, naming the many
rivers he crossed after friends or contributors to his expedition,
or where he could identify them, retaining the names of the coast
surveys. On the 6th of August, he reached a river which he mistook
for the Albert, of Captain Stokes, but which now bears his name,
being so christened by A. C. Gregory, who rectified his error. On
this occasion, Leichhardt did not err so widely as Burke and Wills
did subsequently, when they mistook the mouth of the Flinders for
the Albert. With decreasing supplies and increasing fatigue, they
at last reached the large river in the south-west corner of the
Gulf, which he named the Roper, and here he had the misfortune to
lose four horses, and had to sacrifice the whole of his botanical
collection&mdash;a heavy loss. On the 17th December, when very near
the last of everything, they arrived at the settlement of Victoria,
at Port Essington, and their long journey of ten months was
over.</p>

<p>This expedition, successful as it was in opening up such a large
area of well watered country, attracted universal attention, and
enthusiastic poets broke forth into song at Leichhardt's return, as
they already had done at his reported death. He was heartily
welcomed back to Sydney, and dubbed by journalists the "Prince of
Explorers." But, perhaps, better still, a solid money reward was
raised by both public and private subscription, and shared amongst
the party, in due proportions. During his journey, Leichhardt had
discovered many important rivers draining large and fertile areas.
The principal being the Dawson, the Mackenzie, the Suttor, the
Burdekin, and its many tributaries. The numerous streams of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, and others that have since become almost
household words in Australian geography. He was singularly
fortunate on this occasion; although, judging by his after career,
the luck which had carried him through from Moreton Bay to Port
Essington deserted him suddenly and completely. His route had been
through a country so easy to penetrate and well watered, that on
one night only, had the party camped without water. The blacks,
with the exception of the time when Mr. Gilbert was killed, were
neither troublesome nor hostile, beyond occasionally threatening
them. Game was fairly plentiful, and compared with the obstacles
that beset Sturt, Eyre, and Mitchell, the footsteps of the
explorers had been through a garden of Eden.</p>

<p>But what took the public fancy the most was a certain halo of
romance surrounding the journey, partly from the report of the
death of the traveller having been circulated, and partly from the
trip having been successful in reaching the goal aimed at, and
attaining the results desired, namely, an available and habitable
route to the settlement at Port Essington. All these circumstances,
combined with the very slender means which had enabled the young
and enthusiastic explorer to succeed, threw around Leichhardt's
reputation a glamour, which, fortunately for his reputation, the
mystery surrounding the total and absolute disappearance of himself
and party, in 1848, has deepened, and kept alive until this
day.</p>

<p>Leichhardt added a long string of discoveries to his name during
this one trip, and had his other attempts been as successful in
proportion, he would have taken the first place in the history of
Australian discovery, but it was not to be so, and on this
undoubtedly fruitful expedition his fame now stands.</p>

<p>Before Leichhardt's return, Sir Thomas Mitchell had started on
his long-delayed journey, which, in the main, had the same purpose
in view as Leichhardt's. This expedition had been long talked of.
In 1841, communications between Governor Gipps and Captain Sturt
had taken place on the subject, and in December of the same year,
Eyre, not long back from his journey to King George's Sound, wrote,
offering his services. [See Appendix.] To this the Governor replied
that he would be glad to avail himself of Mr. Eyre's services,
provided that no prior claim to the post was advanced by Captain
Sturt. He also desired Eyre's views as to the expense of the
party.</p>

<p>Eyre estimated that the sum of five thousand pounds would, he
thought, be sufficient to fully cover every expense, including the
hire of a vessel (to meet the party on the north coast), and the
payment of the wages of the men and the salaries of the surveyor
and draughtsman. But the colony was not in a mood to indulge in
such expense, and nothing was done just then.</p>

<p>In 1843, Major Mitchell submitted A plan of exploration to the
Governor, who promised to consult the Legislative Council who
approved, and voted a sum of one thousand pounds towards the
expenses. The Governor referred the matter to Lord Stanley, who
gave a favourable reply; but still the matter was delayed.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the following year (1844), Eyre again made
an offer of his services, intimating that now the altered
circumstances of the colony would allow it to be carried through at
a much cheaper rate. His offer was, however, declined, on account
of the Surveyor-General, to whom the honour rightfully belonged,
being in the field.</p>

<p>In 1845, the Council increased the exploration fund to two
thousand pounds, and Sir George Gipps instructed Major Mitchell to
start.</p>

<p>The views of Sir Thomas were in favour of obtaining a road to
the foot of the Gulf, instead of Port Essington, on account of
reducing the land journey considerably, and also there being such a
reasonable probability that a large river would be found flowing
northward into it.</p>

<p>In a letter which the Surveyor-General received from Mr. Walter
Bagot [See Appendix.] about this time, mention is made of the
blacks reporting a large river west of the Darling, running to the
north or north-west. As, however, the natives do not seem very
clear in their knowledge of the difference between flowing from and
flowing to, it was probable that Cooper's Creek, not then
discovered by Sturt, was the foundation of the legend, or possibly
the Paroo.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of the year, Commissioner Mitchell (a
son of Sir Thomas) made an exploration towards the Darling, and the
discoveries of the Narran, the Balonne, and the Culgoa have been
attributed to him; but, as will be seen by Bagot's letter, they
were known to the settlers a year before; no special interest
beyond this is to be found in the narrative of the journey.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, 1845, Sir Thomas Mitchell started from
Buree, his old point of departure, at the head of the small army
with which he was once more going to vanquish the wilderness.
Mounted videttes, barometer carrier, carter, and pioneer, etc.,
etc., were amongst the list of his subordinates. Well might poor
Leichhardt say, when thinking over his slender
resources:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Believe me, that one experienced and courageous
bushman is worth more than the eight soldiers Sir Thomas intends to
take with him. They will be an immense burthen, and of no
use."</blockquote>

<p>But Sir Thomas thought otherwise; without soldiers he considered
that certain failure awaited the rash explorer; discipline and
method were the sheet anchors of his exploratory existence, every
tent in his camp was pitched by line, and every dray had its
station. With the fated Kennedy as second, and Mr. W. Stephenson as
surgeon and collector, he had also with him twenty-eight men, eight
bullock drays, three horse drays, and two boats; and thus
accompanied, he marched to the north.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell struck the Darling much higher than Fort
Bourke, the state of the country at this time of the year rendering
this change in his plan needful. It was not until he was across the
Darling that he was outside the settled districts, so rapidly had
the country been stocked since last he was there, and even then he
was on territory that his son had lately explored.</p>

<p>The first river the party struck, west of the Darling, was the
Narran, and this was followed up until the Balonne was reached,
which Mitchell pronounced the finest river in Australia, with the
exception of the Murray. Beyond this, they made the Culgoa, and,
crossing it, struck the river again above the separation of the two
streams, which from thence upwards preserved the name of the
Balonne.</p>

<p>On the 12th April, they reached the natural bridge of rocks on
the Balonne, where the township of St. George now stands, long
known as St. George's Bridge; and from here Sir Thomas advanced
with a light party, leaving Kennedy to follow on his tracks with
the remainder, after a rest of three weeks.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the camp, Mitchell crossed the junction of
the Maranoa, but did not at that time like its appearance, and only
followed it a few miles, returning and keeping the course of the
Balonne until they reached the junction of the Cogoon from the
westward, when they followed the course of that river, which led
them into a beautiful pastoral district around a solitary hill,
which the leader named Mount Abundance, and here Mitchell first
noticed the bottle tree.</p>

<p>Passing over a low range from the Cogoon, after crossing some
tributary streams, Sir Thomas found a river with a northerly and
southerly course, full of fine reaches of water, which retained its
native name of the Maranoa, being supposed to be the same as the
junction before noticed. Here they awaited the arrival of Kennedy
with the heavy waggons and main body.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, the party was reunited, and the leader
prepared for a fresh excursion. Before Kennedy left the first
depôt, at which, it will be remembered, he was to remain six weeks,
he received dispatches from Commissioner Mitchell to Sir Thomas, by
which that gentleman learnt of the success of Leichhardt's
expedition.</p>

<p>Major Mitchell has been accused of regarding Leichhardt's
success with jealous eyes, but that can scarcely be the case; true,
he was of a slightly imperious temper, but he must have felt far
too secure of his own reputation to fear any man's rivalry. The
hasty and 'impatient remarks he was occasionally betrayed into
would, no doubt, be the natural result of a man of his temperament
reading such paragraphs in the Sydney newspapers as those he has
quoted in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Australia Felix and the discoveries of Sir Thomas
Mitchell now dwindle into comparative insignificance."<br>
<br>
"We understand the intrepid Dr. Leichhardt is about to start
another expedition to the Gulf, keeping to the westward of the
coast ranges."</blockquote>

<p>The last item would be especially annoying, as it would indicate
an intention of trespassing on Mitchell's then field of
operation.</p>

<p>On the 4th, the Surveyor-General started, intending to be away
from the depôt for at least four months. He followed up the
Maranoa, and crossing the broken tableland at its head, reached the
Warrego, afterwards explored by Kennedy. From this river Mitchell
struck north, feeling inclined to think that he was at last on the
long looked for dividing watershed that separated the northern from
the southern flow.</p>

<p>On the 2nd July, they discovered a fine running stream that soon
broadened into a river, and eventually into a lake, called by
Mitchell Lake Salvator, the river receiving the same name.
Travelling along the basin of the head-waters of the Nogoa, which,
however, turned too much to the eastward for his purpose, crossing
the Claude and the fine country known as Mantuan Downs, Mitchell
ascended a dividing range, and struck the head of the
Belyando&mdash;one of the main tributaries of the Burdekin so
lately discovered by Leichhardt. Following it down through the
thick brigalow scrub, which is a marked feature of this river and
its companion the Suttor, of Leichhardt, the party crossed the
southern tropic on the 25th July, being, as Mitchell says, the
first to enter the interior beyond that line. In this he rather
overlooked the fact, which he must have known, that Leichhardt's
track was only a few miles to the eastward, and also what he did
not then know, that he was not in the interior but still on coast
waters.</p>

<p>On the 10th August, the camp was visited by some natives, who
did not appear of the most friendly disposition. They apparently
called the river Belyando, which name was adopted. On their getting
noisy and troublesome, they were ignominiously put to flight by the
dogs charging them. At this point Mitchell had reluctantly to alter
his preconceived opinions and conjectures, and come to the
conclusion that the northern fall of the waters was still to be
looked for to the westward, and that a further continuance on his
present course would lead him on to Leichhardt's track.
Disappointed, he gave the order to turn back, and on the last days
of August they were once again on the Nogoa tributaries.</p>

<p>At the foot of the range Mitchell established a second depôt,
and on the 10th September started with the black boy and two men
for a month's trip to the westward. On this trip, he must receive
the credit of initiating the now commonly used water-bag for
carrying water. His, it must be confessed, was a very crude one,
being only a thick flour bag, covered outside with melted mutton
fat.</p>

<p>The second day they met some natives, and from one old woman
learnt the names of some of the neighbouring streams, particularly
the Warrego, which river they had crossed on their outward way. The
first river he encountered was the Nive, and again he, as usual,
flattered himself that he was at the head of Gulf waters, little
thinking that he was on the most northern tributary of the Darling.
A small tributary was called the Nivelle. A short day's ride
convinced him that this river ran too much to the south-east, and
he turned to the north through the scrub, and on the morning of the
15th September, was rewarded with the splendid outlook that has
since greeted so many wayfarers on emerging from the Nive
scrub.</p>

<p>In his journal he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I there beheld downs and plains extending westward
beyond the reach of vision, bounded on the S.W. by woods and low
ranges, and on the N.E. by higher ranges, the whole of these open
downs declining to the N.W., in which direction a line of trees
marked the course of a river traceable to the remotest verge of the
horizon. There I found then, at last, the realization of my
long-cherished hopes&mdash;an interior river falling to the N.W. in
the heart of an open country, extending also in that
direction...From the rock where I stood, the scene was so
extensive, as to leave no room for doubt as to the course of the
river, which thus and there revealed to me alone, seemed like a
reward direct, from Heaven for perseverance, and as a compensation
for the many sacrifices I had. made in order to solve the question
as to the interior rivers of tropical Australia."</blockquote>

<p>Once more the victim of a too sanguine belief, he followed tip
his discovery by at once commencing to trace down the river that
ran through this new-found paradise. He had made a great
contribution to Australian geography, as great as what he hoped
for; but if he had been told the truth he would scarcely have been
satisfied. He had found the upper tributaries of the second great
river system of the interior, as Sturt -had found its lower
outflow, and he had thrown open the wonderful western prairies, but
he was as far from the Gulf as ever.</p>

<p>Light-hearted and satisfied, the party rode on for days through
the beautiful undulating downs country. On the 22nd September, we
find in his journal a notice of the new kind of grass, which was in
future to be so highly prized and to bear his name:</p>

<blockquote>"Two kinds of grass grew on these plains, one of them,
a brome grass, possessing the remarkable property of shooting up
green from the old stalk."</blockquote>

<p>On the 23rd, they crossed and named the Alice, and on the 26th,
being fully satisfied, and their provisions running short turned
back.</p>

<p>Mitchell for once, in honour of such a discovery, departed from
his usual custom, which was the healthy plan of giving "good,
sonorous native names" to the most noticeable features, and called
the river the Victoria. On the 6th of October they reached the
depôt camp, and found all well.</p>

<p>The return to the main depôt, left in charge of Kennedy, was
soon accomplished, and on the 19th this was reached, and the
occupants found safe and unmolested, although the absence of
Mitchell had now extended over the four months. As a proof of the
capabilities of the country he had travelled over, Mitchell brought
back all his animals in first-rate condition, having lost only one
horse, and that was through an accident.</p>

<p>The final return was made down the yet unexplored Maranoa, at
the head of which the depôt had been fixed so long; and on the 4th
November they arrived at the Balonne, having passed through
splendidly-grassed and well-watered country the whole way. The
party took up their old camp at St. George's Bridge, where they
learnt from the natives that a party of whites had been in the
neighbourhood during their absence. Kennedy was dispatched to
inspect the Mooni ponds, or river, which they understood was to the
eastward of them. He found them occupied by cattle stations to
within a day's ride of the camp, so that the explorer's work may be
considered as at an end.</p>

<p>This expedition, it may well be supposed, fully confirmed
Mitchell's reputation. Once more he had been the means of assuring
the colonists that away towards the setting sun the flocks and
herds might advance unchecked, so far as he had been, and as he
thought, across the great continent. Added to which, he felt
convinced, and expected the public also to feel the same, that
along the banks of the Victoria was the great high road to the
north coast.</p>

<p>This was the last expedition of the Surveyor-General, and the
year before concluded the active work of his old rival in the
field, Charles Sturt. Both men had done wonders in the cause of
exploration; but the genii of plentiful seasons and bountiful
vegetation seems to have been the forerunner of Sir Thomas, whilst
a demon of drought and aridity stalked in front of Sturt.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The importance of deciding the final course of the Victoria was
at once recognised, and Kennedy was chosen to lead a lightly
equipped party. However convinced Sir Thomas Mitchell was of the
affluent of the Victoria being in the Gulf of Carpentaria, others
did not at once fall in with the notion. It was evident that the
vast flooded plains, and many channels of Cooper's Creek absorbed
immense quantities of water from the interior, and apparently this
water came from the north-east. What more probable than that the
Victoria was lost there.</p>

<p>Kennedy followed the old track to the river, found by Mitchell,
and reaching his lowest camp on the 13th of August, commenced to
run the river down from there. On the first day's journey he met a
native, from whom he learnt the aboriginal name of the Victoria,
the <i>Barcoo</i>.</p>

<p>On the 15th Kennedy noticed with anxiety that the valley of the
river certainly fell to the south, and that ever since it had
turned from its northerly course, it was making for the point where
Sturt turned back on Cooper's Creek. He consequently began to dread
that he might follow the course of it, so far as not to be able to
carry out the second part of his instructions, namely, to look for
a road to the Gulf, not having enough means with him for both
journeys. He decided to follow with two men along the Barcoo, far
enough to the south to leave no doubt about its not being a north
coast river. After two days' journey, the direction of the Barcoo
turned west, and even north of west, and the bed contained fine
reaches of water, one hundred, and one hundred and twenty yards
wide. Kennedy turned back for the whole of his party, considering
that his duty was to follow such a river, no matter in what
direction it led him.</p>

<p>On the 30th August, they came upon a large tributary from the
N.N.E., which was named the Thomson, and they found the country
very different from the grassy plains of the upper reaches.</p>

<p>Finally, the river led them amongst plains gaping with fissures,
grassless and waterless, where the only change in the flat
character of the country was the sandhill formation, that exactly
agreed with Sturt's description. In fact, it was now evident to
Kennedy that the only result of his journey would be to connect
with that explorer's most northerly and easterly point, and,
however satisfactory or unsatisfactory this might be, it was
scarcely worth risking the lives of his party, and the certain loss
of his horses to attain. Grass, or feed of any sort, had now failed
them for several days, and at last they could find no more water.
They were confronted with the desert described by Sturt with such
terrible accuracy, and there was nothing to be gained by entering
into a struggle with it. Kennedy turned back quite satisfied that
the end of the Victoria was in Cooper's Creek.</p>

<p>As the nomenclature of these watercourses is rather conflicting,
and they were the field of many subsequent explorations, it may be
as well to mention that the Victoria (now the Barcoo) joins
Kennedy's Thomson, which still retains its name, and below the
junction the united stream is always now called Cooper's Creek.
Thus, as the residents out there tell you, <i>it takes two rivers
in that part of Australia to make a creek</i>.</p>

<p>A noticeable incident here occurs in Kennedy's journal. Writing
on the 11th September, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"A curious fact I observed here is, that the men chew
tobacco; it is, of course, in a green state, but it is strong and
hot."</blockquote>

<p>This was almost, certainly, the <i>pituri</i> plant, which the
natives of the interior chew, and then bury in the sand, where the
heat of the sun causes it to ferment; it is then chewed as an
intoxicant, the natives carrying a plug behind their car in their
hair. It is offered to a stranger as an especial compliment, and
great is the affront if this toothsome morsel is declined. It only
grows in certain localities, far west of where Kennedy saw the
natives using it, and the blacks of the locality where it is found
barter it away with other tribes, by which means it is found at a
considerable distance from where it grows. Amongst the natives
there are <i>pituri</i> and <i>non-pituri</i> chewers.</p>

<p>On his downward journey Kennedy, to ease his horses as much as
possible, had buried a great quantity of flour and sugar. On his
return he found that the natives had discovered it, and wantonly
emptied it out of the bags into the hole, reducing it to a mixture
of earth and flour that was completely useless. This loss prevented
Kennedy from making his intended excursion to the Gulf. The party
started back, and on his way Kennedy picked up his carts, which he
had also buried. He was just in time; a native, probably one of the
burglars already mentioned, had been examining and sounding the
ground but a short time before the party arrived.</p>

<p>On reaching the head of the Warrego, Kennedy determined to
follow it down, and ascertain whether it was a southerly or
westerly flowing river. They followed the Warrego south, through
fine grazing country, the river being full of splendid reaches of
water, but at last it failed them, running out in flat country in
waterless channels. From here they struck across easterly to the
Culgoa, which river they reached after a ride of seventy miles
without water, over a barren country, timbered with pine and
brigalow. Here they were delayed getting the carts across this dry
track, and lost six horses from heat and thirst. Thus vanished the
high hopes entertained of the Victoria River.</p>

<p>Meantime, Leichhardt, encouraged by his first success, had
received liberal support from the public to enable him to start on
a new expedition, which at once was to settle the question of the
nature of the interior, the ambitious project being nothing less
than to traverse the continent from the eastern to the western
shore, on much the same parallel of latitude if possible.</p>

<p>The party travelled overland from the Hunter River to the
Darling Downs, bringing with them their outfit of mules, cattle,
and goats. On December 10th, 1846, the expedition left Mr.
Stephens' station on the Condamine, the members then consisting of
seven whites and two blacks. Of stock, they had two hundred and
seventy goats, one hundred and eighty sheep, forty bullocks,
fifteen horses, and thirteen mules. This stock, with their flour,
tea, sugar, etc., was to last them on a two years' journey.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to go into particulars concerning this
unfortunate trip. They never succeeded in getting away from the old
Port Essington track. The rains came down on them in the sickly
brigalow scrubs of the Dawson and Mackenzie. Fever was the result,
and they had no medicines with them&mdash;a strange omission. Their
only coverings during the wet were two miserable calico tents.
Their life, as told by members of the party, consisted of
semi-starvation, varied by gorging and feasting on killing days, in
which the Doctor apparently set the example; in fact, his character
throughout comes out in anything but an amiable light, and one is
led to wonder how anyone so destitute of tact and readiness of
resource ever achieved the journey to Port Essington, favoured even
as he was on that occasion by circumstances and seasons. Suffice it
to say, to end the miserable story, that, having first lost their
sheep and goats, then their cattle and most of their horses and
mules, they turned up on the 6th of July at Chauvel's station on
the Condamine, having done nothing but wander about on the old
track and eat their supplies.</p>

<p>On reaching the station, Dr. Leichhardt was put in possession of
the finding of the Victoria, the Maranoa, &amp;c., and being
anxious to examine the country between Sir Thomas Mitchell's track
and his own, he, in company with Mr. Isaacs and three of his late
companions, left Stuart Russell's station on a short excursion,
during which he crossed to the Balonne and back, making some
subordinate discoveries.</p>

<p>Still persisting in his idea of crossing the continent, and
fearful that he might be forestalled, he made great efforts to get
together a small party of some sort to make another attempt. He
succeeded; but this time his party was neither so well provided nor
so large. In fact, very little is known of the members constituting
it. The Rev. W. B. Clarke, speaking of this final trip,
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The parties who accompanied Leichhardt were, perhaps, little
capable of shifting for themselves in case of any accident to their
leader. The second in command, a brother-in-law of Leichhardt, came
from Germany to join him just before starting, and he told me, when
I asked him what his qualifications for the journey were, that he
had been at sea, had suffered shipwrecks, and was, therefore, well
able to endure hardship. I do not know what his other
qualifications were."</blockquote>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, this man, whose name was Classen
or Klausen, has always been selected as the hero of the many tales
that have been brought in of a solitary survivor of the party
living in captivity with the natives; probably, because his was the
only name besides Leichhardt's generally known and remembered.</p>

<p>The lost expedition is supposed to have consisted of six whites
and two blacks. The names known are those of the Doctor himself,
Classen, Hentig, Stuart, and Kelly. He had with him fifty bullocks,
thirteen mules, twelve horses, and two hundred and seventy goats,
beside the utterly inadequate allowance of eight hundred pounds of
flour, one hundred and twenty pounds of tea, some sugar and salt,
and two hundred and fifty pounds of shot and forty of powder.</p>

<p>His last letter [See Appendix.] is dated the 3rd of April, 1848,
from McPherson's station on the Cogoon, but in it he speaks only of
the. country traversed, and says nothing of his intended route.
Since the residents of this outlying station lost sight of him and
his men, no clue to his fate has ever been found. The total
evanishment not only of his men but of the animals (especially the
goats) that accompanied him, is one of the strangest mysteries of
our mysterious interior.</p>

<p>Leichhardt's expressed intention was to endeavour to skirt the
edge of the desert&mdash;which was then supposed to exist in the
centre&mdash;to the northward, seizing the first opportunity of
penetrating it, and then making for Perth. From what we now know,
it is quite impossible to guess how much or little of this
programme was carried out, as the existence or non-existence of
what he would consider a desert would entirely depend upon what the
season had been like immediately before his arrival.</p>

<p>The perusal of his journal to Port Essington, impresses one with
the opinion that, considering his scientific training, he was
singularly deficient in observation. In one place he writes that
horses and bullocks never showed that instinctive faculty of
detecting water so often mentioned by travellers, and that they
seem to be guided entirely by their sight when in search of
it&mdash;an assertion which seems incredible on the part of a man
with any bush training at all. If Leichhardt had ever had to steady
a thirsty mob of cattle during a pitch dark night, with a strong
wind blowing from water, or even across the damp bed of a lagoon or
river, miles and miles away, he would soon have found out by what
sense cattle are guided in their search for water.</p>

<p>Although one does not want to harshly criticise these obvious
errors in the very rudiments of bush-craft, they serve to indicate
how likely he would have been, if entrapped in dry country, to
commit a mistake that would sacrifice his men. And one cannot but
believe that he relied quite as much on the chapter of accidents to
pull him through as upon his own helpfulness or experience. Of the
causes that led to the destruction or dispersion of the whole of
the party it is next to impossible to hazard a guess. The
completeness of the disappearance is the most the puzzling part of
the mystery. Had they been killed by the natives, relics of the
explorers would long since have been recovered from them. In some
shape the iron work of the implements they had with them would have
survived.</p>

<p>Many have tried to explain it by imagining them swept away by a
flood when camped on flat country, but this is scarcely likely, for
even then, on the subsidence of the waters, the blacks would have
found something of their belongings. Thirst was most likely the
agent of their destruction, and fire completed the work.</p>

<p>Once across the waters that wend their sluggish way into the
lake district of South Australia, Leichhardt and his followers
would be in the great region of fragmentary watercourses; rivers
and creeks, when met with, pursuing no definite courses&mdash;now
lost in miles of level country, now reforming again for a brief
existence, but always delusive and disappointing. Here they would
one day find themselves in a position that left them no other
chance but the slender one of still pushing forward into the
unknown. Probably it was during one of the cycles of rainless years
that periodically visit the continent. Led on mile after mile,
following the dry bed of one creek, to lose it in some barren flat,
whereon the withered stalks of blue-bush alone told of a time of
past vegetation; again picking up another creek, to lose it in like
manner, knowing that to retrace their steps was impossible; making
at last for a hazy, blue line in the distance that turned out to be
spinifex and stunted forest; trusting still that this might
indicate a change that would lead them to higher country and to
water, they would struggle forward, weak and disorganised.</p>

<p>Then would come the beginning of the end. As they pressed on,
the forest became scantier, and the spinifex higher, spikier, and
harder to march through. One by one their animals had fallen and
died, and the desperate resort of drinking the blood had been tried
by some. What little water they had in their canteens was fast
evaporating. Still some of them would keep heart. The ground was
getting stonier, and bare patches of rock were constantly passed;
surely they must be getting on higher country; they were doubtless
ascending the gradual rise of one of the inland watersheds, and
suddenly they hoped the ground would break away at their feet in
deep gullies and ravines; below they would see the tops of green
trees, shading some quiet waterhole. How anxiously they looked out
for any sign of life that might be a good augury of this, but none
could be seen.</p>

<p>Since leaving the open country, even the tireless kites had
deserted them; all around was silent, still, and lifeless. It was
useless to stop to rest, the ground was blistering to the touch,
and there was no shade anywhere. Then came night, but no change;
throughout the long watches, the radiance of the stars was never
blurred by clouds. Some of the men slept and dreamt of streams of
clear, cold water, awaking only to greet the dawn of another day of
blinding, stifling heat, heralded by the faint sultry sigh of the
hot wind. And as the day grew hotter and hotter some lost their
reason, and all lost hope. Then came the end; they separated and
straggled away in ones and twos and fell and died. Day after day
the terrible and pitiless sun .looked down at them lying there, and
watched them dry and shrivel into mummies, and still no rain fell
on the earth.</p>

<p>By day the sky was clear and bright, and by night the stars
unclouded. Years may have passed; higher and higher grew the
spinifex, and its long resinous needles entangled themselves in
each other, unchecked by fire for no black hunters came there in
that season of drought, and the men's bodies lay there, growing
more and more unlike humanity, scorched by the seven times heated
earth beneath, and the glaring sun above untouched, save by the
ants, those scavengers of the desert, or the tiny bright-eyed
lizards. At last, the thunder clouds began to gather afar off, and
when they broke, a few wandering natives ventured into the woods,
living for a day or two on the uncertain rainfall. This failing,
they retired again, leaving perhaps, a trail of fire behind them.
Then this fire, fed by the huge banks of flammable spinifex, the
growth of many years, spread into a mighty conflagration, the black
smoke covering half the heavens. The hawks and the crows fled
before it, swooping down on the vermin that were forced to leave
the shelter of log and bush. The great silence that had reigned for
so long was broken by the roar, and crash, and crackle of a sea of
flames; and beneath this fiery blast every vestige of the lost
explorers vanished for ever.</p>

<p>When, on the blackened ground, fell heavy rain once more, the
spinifex sprang up, fresh and green to look at, only in spots here
and there, where a human body had fertilised the soil, it was
greener than elsewhere.</p>

<p>So Leichhardt drops out of Australian history, and with every
succeeding year the chances of finding any trace grow more
remote.</p>

<p>Expeditions have been started in search of him, but without
result, and the tale of their efforts will be told in their proper
order.</p>

<p>As if the year 1848, when Europe seemed convulsed with some
strange tempest of riot and turmoil, should not be unmarked in
Australia, two of the most disastrous expeditions in the annals of
exploration started during its course. One, Leichhardt's, as we
have just seen, vanished, and all must have perished. Of the other,
under Kennedy, two ghastly famished spectres, that had once been
white men, and a naked blackfellow, alone were rescued out of
thirteen.</p>

<p>The same impulses that led to Mitchell's and Leichhardt's
northern journeys, started Kennedy on his fatal venture up the
eastern slope of the long peninsula that terminates in Cape York.
The desire to find a road to the north coast, so that an available
chain of communication should exist between the southern
settlements and a northern seaport.</p>

<p>Kennedy started from Sydney on board the barque <i>Tam
O'Shanter</i>, on the 29th of April, 1848. He had twelve men in his
party, including Mr. Carron as botanist, one of the survivors who
published the account of the trip, and Mr. Wall, naturalist. Their
outfit consisted of twenty-eight horses and one hundred sheep,
besides the other necessary rations, carts, &amp;c. The
instructions were to land at Rockingham Bay, and examine the
eastern coast of the peninsula, to Port Albany in the extreme
north, where a ship would meet and receive them. Such was the
programme, alas for the performance!</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, they landed in Rockingham Bay, with the loss
of one horse, and Kennedy made his first acquaintanceship with the
tropical jungles of northern Queensland (that now is), including
the terrible lawyer vine [Calamus Australis.] and the stinging
tree. The first, a vine with long hooks and spurs on it, that once
fast, seem determined never to let go again; the stalk being as
tenacious and tough as wire, and binding the scrub trees together
so as to render advance impossible without first cutting a way. The
other, a tree with broad leaves, the sting produced by touching
which is so painful that horses, who on first being stung have
plunged about and been stung all over, have died from the fever and
inflammation caused.</p>

<p>These scrubs, marshy ground, salt water creeks, and high
mountain ranges, all inhabited by hostile natives, formed the
pleasant prospect before Kennedy.</p>

<p>From the very commencement almost, the monotonous record of
Carron's journal commences day after day thus&mdash;"Cutting scrub
all day." Through these marshes and swamps Kennedy strove to make
for the ranges, hoping at least to find clearer country to travel
through. Often during this time, he must have thought of his last
journey over the boundless prairies of the Barcoo, and sighed at
the contrast. The natives, too, began to annoy the travellers, and
at last they were fired on and four killed and wounded.</p>

<p>On the 18th July, the carts were abandoned, and they went on
with twenty-six pack horses, their sheep being reduced to fifty,
and these were rapidly falling away, as well as the horses, on the
sour coast grasses. They fared no better when they reached the
range, or the spurs of the Main Range, for the scrub still hemmed
them in, and roads up and down the rugged hills were hard to find;
then to add to all, rain set in.</p>

<p>On the 14th August, Carron took charge of the stores instead of
Niblet, who had been very extravagant with them, and also sent in
false returns; the allowance of flour was now reduced, and hopes
were entertained that with care it would hold out; but at first the
supply provided was insufficient. The horses too, began to knock
up, and one after another they were left behind dead or dying.</p>

<p>Crossing the dividing watershed, the party for some time
travelled along the heads of rivers running into the Gulf of
Carpentaria, finding it a great improvement in every
way&mdash;thence they crossed back on to the waters of the east
coast once more, and their horses still giving in, one by one, they
fell back on them as an article of diet.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November, Kennedy realised that struggling on with
the whole of his party meant death by starvation to all, so he
determined to push ahead with three men and the black boy to Port
Albany, and send back relief by water. Port Albany, in the Pass of
that name, being the rendezvous agreed upon with the relief vessel.
The camp was selected on the top of a hill, fully visible from
Weymouth Bay, and Mr. Carron put in charge of it.</p>

<p>On the 13th, Kennedy started with the best seven of the horses
leaving the eight men in camp to await his return, or the relief
boat. The only account ever received of his journey came from the
lips of the black boy Jacky-Jacky, the sole survivor.</p>

<p>His story ran that three weeks after leaving Weymouth Bay they
reached Shelburne Bay, after cutting through a great deal of scrub
and crossing many rivers and creeks. Here Costigan accidentally
shot himself, and became very weak from loss of blood, so Luff,
[Luff; the man mentioned here, was with Kennedy on his Barcoo
expedition, and some of the trees on the Warrego, marked "L," and
ascribed to Leichhardt, were probably some of his marking.] another
of the men, being ill, Kennedy left the third man, Dunn, to look
after them, and one horse for food; he and the boy making a
desperate effort to reach Cape York and send back succour. But it
was in vain. They reached the Escape River, and were in sight of
Albany Island, when they met a number of blacks who were apparently
friendly, although Jacky mistrusted them. Then came the end.
Jacky's story has been often told, but it will bear repetition.</p>

<blockquote>"I and Mr. Kennedy watched them that night, taking it
in turns every hour that night. By-and-by I saw the blackfellows.
It was a moonlight night, and I walked up to Mr. Kennedy and said,
'There is plenty of blackfellows now.' This was in the middle of
the night. Mr. Kennedy told rue to get my gun ready.<br>
<br>
"The blacks did not know where we slept as we did not make a
fire. We both sat up all night. After this, daylight came, and I
fetched the horses and saddled them. Then we went on a good way up
the river, and then we sat down a little while, and then we saw
three blacks coming along our track, and then they saw us, and one
ran back as hard as he could run, and fetched up plenty more, like
a flock of sheep almost. I told Mr. Kennedy to put the saddles on
the horses and go on; and the blacks came up and they followed us
all day. All along it was raining, and I now told him to leave the
horses, and come on without them, that the horses made too much
track. Mr. Kennedy was too weak, and would not leave the horses. We
went on this day until towards the evening; raining hard, and the
blacks followed us all day, some behind, some planted before. In
fact, blackfellows all around, following us. Now we went into a
little bit of scrub, and I told Mr. Kennedy to look behind always.
Sometimes he would do so, and sometimes he would not do so, to look
out for the blacks. Then a good many blackfellows came behind in
the scrub, and threw plenty of spears, and hit Mr. Kennedy in the
back first. Mr. Kennedy said to me, 'Oh, Jacky Jacky shoot 'em!
shoot 'em!' Then I pulled out my gun and fired, and hit one fellow
all over the face with buck shot. He tumbled down, and got up
again, and again, and wheeled right round, and two blacks picked
him up and carried him away. They went a little way and came back
again, throwing spears all round, more than they did before-very
large spears.<br>
<br>
"I pulled out the spear at once from Mr. Kennedy's back, and cut
the jag with Mr. Kennedy's knife. Then Mr. Kennedy got his gun and
snapped, but the gun would not go off. The blacks sneaked all along
by the trees, and speared Mr. Kennedy again in the right leg, above
the knee a little, and I got speared in the eye, and the blacks
were now throwing always, never giving over, and shortly again
speared Mr. Kennedy in the right side. There were large jags to the
spears, and I cut them out and put them in my pocket. At the same
time we got speared the horses got speared too, and jumped and
bucked about and got into the swamps. I now told Mr. Kennedy to sit
down while I looked after the saddle bags, which I did, and when I
came back again I saw blacks along with Mr. Kennedy. I then asked
him if he saw the blacks with him. He was stupid with the spear
wounds, and said, 'No.' I then asked him where was his watch? I saw
the blacks taking away watch and hat as I was returning to Mr.
Kennedy. Then I carried Mr. Kennedy into the scrub. He said 'Don't
carry me a good way.' Then Mr. Kennedy looked this way, very bad
(Jacky rolling his eyes). Then I said to him don't look far away,
as I thought he would be frightened. I asked him often, are you
well now, and he said, 'I don't care for the spear wound in my leg,
Jacky, but for the other two spear wounds in my side and back, and
I am bad inside, Jacky.' I told him blackfellow always die when he
got spear in there (the back). He said, 'I am out of wind, Jacky.'
I asked him (Mr. Kennedy), are you going to leave me? And he said,
'Yes, my boy, I am going to leave you.' He said, 'I am very bad,
Jacky you take the books, Jacky, to the Captain, but not the big
ones, the Governor will give you anything for them.' I then tied up
the papers. He then said, 'Jacky, you give me paper and I will
write.' I gave him paper and pencil and he tried to write, and he
then fell back and died, and I caught him as he fell back, and held
him, and I then turned round myself and cried. I was crying a good
while until I got well, that was about an hour, and then I buried
him.<br>
<br>
"I digged up the ground with a tomahawk, and covered him over with
logs and grass and my shirt and trousers. That night I left him
near dark. I would go through the scrub, and the blacks threw
spears at me, a good many, and I went back again into the scrub.
Then I went down the creek which runs into Escape River, and I
walked along the water in the creek, very easy, with my head only
above water to avoid the blacks and get out of their way. In this
way I went half a mile. Then I got out of the creek and got clear
of them, and walked on all night nearly, and slept in the bush
without a fire."</blockquote>

<p>This was the sad tale. It took poor starving Jacky thirteen days
to get to Port Albany, short as the distance comparatively was. He
lived on what small vermin he could catch, climbing trees every now
and again to look for Port Albany and the ship. He carried the
saddle bags, with Kennedy's papers, for some distance, but had to
leave them hidden in a log.</p>

<p>Immediately that Jacky's story was told to the people of the
<i>Ariel</i>, the schooner awaiting Kennedy's party at Port Albany,
sail was made for Shelburne Bay to rescue the three men left there.
A canoe was captured which contained articles that left little
doubt of the fate of the unfortunates. The camp, however, was too
far inland to reach without a very strong party, and as it seemed
certain that help was too late, and there were eight men, whom
Jacky described as being scarcely able to crawl, awaiting relief at
Weymouth Bay, sail was again made there.</p>

<p>The wretched men at Weymouth Bay had fared but badly. Douglas
died first, and he was buried; a rite which the party had
afterwards to leave unperformed, through sheer weakness. Taylor
died next and was buried by the side of Douglas.</p>

<p>Meantime, the blacks behaved in an inexplicable manner, at times
they would approach and offer the whites tainted fish as if to make
friends, and then come up with spears poised, and every token of
hostility, compelling the weary watchers to stand on their guard,
expecting an attack. Carpenter was the next to die, and he was
buried with the others. On the 1st December a schooner was seen in
the Bay; and joyfully the flag was hoisted and some rockets let off
after dark. But she sailed away, never having seen the signals, and
the agony of the disappointed men can be imagined. On the 28th
December, Niblet and Wall died, and the blacks came and surrounded
the camp and threatened the two helpless survivors, hardly able to
stand up and hold their guns.</p>

<p>On the 30th, Goddard crawled out to try and shoot some pigeons,
and Carron sat with a pistol in his hand, to give him warning if
the blacks approached. Let him tell the end.</p>

<blockquote>"About an hour after he was gone I could see some
natives running over the hill towards me. I fired a pistol
immediately, but before Goddard could get back they were into the
camp, and handed me a piece of paper very much dirtied and torn,
but I was sure by their manner that there was a vessel in the bay.
It proved to be a note to me from Captain Dobson, but I could only
read part of it, it was so covered with dirt. I was for a minute or
two almost senseless from the hope of being relieved from our
miserable condition. I made them some presents, and wrote a note to
Captain Dobson and sent them away with it. I easily made them
understand what I wanted, but I soon saw that they had other
intentions. I saw a great number of natives coming in all
directions, well armed. I saw two from strange tribes amongst them.
One man that I gave an old shirt to, and put it on him, I saw him
take it off and pick up his spears. We were expecting every minute
to be attacked by these treacherous villains, when, to our great
joy, we saw Captain Dobson, Dr. Vallack, Jacky (the black boy), and
another man who had received a spear wound in his arm (Barrett), so
that he could offer no resistance to the blacks, coming across the
creek. These men had risked their own lives by coming about three
miles through mangroves and thick scrub (surrounded by not less
than a hundred natives, well armed), with a hope of saving some of
us from starving."</blockquote>

<p>The camp had to be vacated in such a hurry in consequence of the
threatened attack, that nothing was saved but a few instruments and
botanical specimens.</p>

<p>This was the end of a most unfortunate expedition from the first
landing. Against the impassable nature of the line of march, and
the hostile inhabitants, the harassed explorers had to combat from
the first. Their horses were not acclimated, so they soon wasted
away, and when sickness laid its hand upon the men they were
doomed. The one brightening touch in the whole gloomy picture is
the simple devotion shown by poor Jacky: "He then fell back and
died, and I caught him as he fell back and held him, <i>and then I
turned round myself and cried</i>," was the funeral oration over
the brave and unfortunate Kennedy.</p>

<p>The brig <i>Freak</i> was chartered by the Government to make
another examination of the coast. The remains of the men at
Weymouth Bay were reinterred, and search made for the missing men
at Shelburne Bay, but they were never found. Some of the papers
secreted by Jacky were recovered, but Kennedy's body had been taken
away. This was all that was ever discovered.</p>

<p>In the south of Australia, in 1847, Baron von Mueller was
engaged in many explorations, in some still unknown parts of the
continent down there. These travels were undertaken for botanical
and geographical purposes combined, partly in the province of South
Australia, and latterly amongst the many unexplored recesses of the
Australian Alps. The culminating points of several of the highest
mountains in Australia were fixed, and their geographical positions
accurately defined amongst them being Mount Hotham.</p>

<p>To the west coast once again. Still trusting that perseverance
would be finally rewarded, the colonists on Swan River kept making
vigorous attempts to penetrate what they would fain consider was
only a desert belt bounding their territory.</p>

<p>In 1843 a small private party, consisting of Messrs. Landor and
Lefroy, made a short excursion from York, being absent a fortnight.
They came across several shallow lakes, both salt and fresh, but
their journey was not recompensed by the discovery of any good
country.</p>

<p>In 1846 we first come across the name of Gregory in the annals
of exploration. There were three brothers of this name, led by the
eldest, A. C. Gregory, who as a scientific explorer so greatly
distinguished himself in after life. On the 7th August, 1846, they
started from Bolgart Spring, the furthest stock station to the
eastward.</p>

<p>Their equipment was of the slenderest, and they only took about
two months supply of rations. On leaving the settled districts they
at once found themselves in the barren country, that had so often
stopped the outward march of the pioneers, and their first
discovery was a swampy lake (fresh) on the edge of a small patch of
better country, but this quickly passed, and they entered into the
salt lake region, through which they pushed until they reached a
range of granite hills, forming the watershed of the coast streams.
Turning somewhat to the northward, they kept along these hills for
the sake of the rain water to be found amongst the rocks, until,
striking again to the east, they encountered an extensive salt lake
or swamp; attempting to cross which their horses were bogged, and
only extricated with difficulty.</p>

<p>This lake was found afterwards to be of great size, and to
fairly hem them in to the eastward, so after several
disappointments they turned to the westward to examine some of the
streams crossed by Grey during his unfortunate expedition to
Shark's Bay. On the head of one of these rivers (the Arrowsmith),
which from the uncertainty of Grey's chart, they were unable to
clearly identify; they found a seam of coal. This was the only
discovery of any importance that they made, the rest of their
journey was over very impoverished country, covered with scrub and
sand, with here and there salt flats and lakes. They returned to
Bolgart Spring on the 22nd September.</p>

<p>On hearing of the coal discovery the Government sent Lieutenant
Helpman in the schooner <i>Champion</i>, to Champion Bay, which
place he. reached at the end of the year, accompanied by one of the
Gregorys. They landed the cart and horses, and on the 12th December
reached the scene of the coal find. They soon filled their cart
with coal, and returned by a somewhat different track to the
schooner. F. Gregory making a detour to the northward without any
noteworthy result.</p>

<p>Not yet disappointed in the hope of finding country worth
settling to the eastward, Surveyor-General Roe started from York on
the 14th September, 1848; he had with him six men, (including H.
Gregory) and twelve horses, with over three months' provisions. It
will be unnecessary to follow them over the salt lake country which
they inevitably met with soon after leaving civilization, or the
outskirts of it Their first attempts beyond were unsuccessful; they
were successively turned from their course by scrub of the densest
character, and sandy plains, so they at last made for the south
coast, where they rested for a while at one of the small
settlements.</p>

<p>On the 18th, they again started, following the upward course of
the Pallinup River, which was the last stream crossed by Eyre
before reaching Albany, on his Great Bight expedition. They
ascended a branch coming from the north-east, and for a time
travelled through well grassed and promising valleys, but
afterwards found themselves once more in the scrubs and sandy
plains of the desert. Catching sight of a granite hill to the
eastward, they proceeded there, but from its summit the outlook was
as gloomy as ever. Fortunately the weather had been showery, and
the want of water was not felt so much as the total absence of
feed. Still, on to the eastward their difficulties increased at
every step. To the impassable thickets and desolate plains was now
added the absence of fresh water, and it was not until after days
of privation that they reached some elevated peaks, where a little
grass and water were found.</p>

<p>Their course was now to the south-east, towards the range
sighted by Eyre, and named the Russell Range, and a desperate
struggle commenced with the barren country through which they had
to work their way. So weakened were the horses, and such was the
nature of the belts of scrub, that it took them three days to
accomplish fifty miles, and after being four days and three nights
without water for the horses, they reached a rugged granite hill,
called Mount Riley, where they got a scant supply. From here, their
journey to the Russell Range, fifty miles away, was but a
repetition of their former hardships. Nothing but continuous scrub;
sometimes the thickets were too dense to attempt a passage, even
with the axes, and long detours had to be made. At last, with
worn-out horses, they reached the Russell Range, and every hope
they had entertained of a change for the better was blasted. The
range was a mass of naked rocks, and from the summit nothing but
the interminable sea of scrub and the distant ocean, was visible.
Fortunately, they got a little grass and water, which saved the
lives of their animals.</p>

<p>From the Russell Range, Roe's homeward track was not far removed
from Eyre's, so that no fresh geographical features could be
expected, or were discovered, with the exception of another coal
seam in one of the rivers running into the south coast. On the 2nd
February, 1849, the Surveyor-General reached Perth.</p>

<p>During the time this last expedition had been endeavouring to
proceed east, A. C. Gregory was put in charge of a party to make
for the north, and ascertain the value of the country reported by
Grey as existing on the Gascoyne. On his way, Gregory reported
favourably of the country around Champion Bay, which had been
extolled by Gray, and subsequently condemned by Captain Stokes.
Beyond the Murchison, he did not succeed in penetrating any
considerable distance; being turned back at all points, after
repeated attempts, by the tract of impervious scrub that intervened
between the Murchison and the Gascoyne. He therefore returned,
without seeing the latter river, having attained a distance of
three hundred and fifty miles north of Perth. On their return to
the Murchison, a vein of galena was discovered, and the river
traced upwards and downwards for a considerable distance. They
reached Perth on the 17th November.</p>

<p>The following month Governor Fitzgerald, accompanied by A. C.
Gregory, Bland, and three soldiers, went by sea to Champion Bay,
and landing some horses, proceeded inland to examine the new
mineral discovery. The lode was found to be more important than was
at first supposed.</p>

<p>On their return journey to Champion Bay, an affray occurred with
the natives. The blacks followed them for some time, their numbers
constantly increasing, until fifty well-armed natives were present;
in a thick scrub they succeeded in surrounding the whites, and
commenced hostilities. The party found it necessary to resort to
their firearms. and the Governor fired the first shot, bringing
down the leading native, who had just thrown a spear at Gregory. A
shower of spears then fell amongst the group of explorers, and the
Governor was speared through the leg. The natives were, however,
kept at bay, and that afternoon they reached the beach and embarked
on board the schooner.</p>

<p>This was the second time an Australian Governor had been wounded
by the natives, the first occasion being when Captain Arthur
Phillip was speared.</p>

<p>Fears now began to be entertained in the other colonies as to
the safety of Leichhardt and his party, and, in consequence of
these fears being augmented by the tales and rumours that drifted
in from the outside districts, gathered from the natives (referring
to the murder of a party of whites to the westward), it was decided
to equip an expedition to try and ascertain the truth of these
reports.</p>

<p>The party was put in charge of Mr. Hovenden Hely, a former
companion of Leichhardt on his second expedition, and in the
beginning of 1852 he left Sydney on the search, his instructions
being to act as circumstances should determine him.</p>

<p>About forty miles from Mitchell's Mount Abundance he met with
the first of a series of native statements that were destined to
keep luring him forward on a false scent. The story, as usual, was
most circumstantial, and did credit to the imaginations of the
authors; two blacks offered to conduct Hely to the scene of the
massacre, and under their guidance he started, It was a very dry
season, and when they reached Mitchell's old depôt camp on the
Maranoa, where, it will be remembered that his party were encamped
for four months, nothing of the fine sheet of water mentioned by
him was seen; it had shrunk to a shallow pool in a bed of sand.
Here the two guides insisted that the murder had taken place,
pointing to the remains of Mitchell's encampment as a proof
thereof. This naturally led Hely to disbelieve their statement, but
the blacks added such details to the original story as almost again
convinced him. The most minute search, however, resulted in
nothing, and one of the natives managed to make his escape. The
other then altered his version of the affair, and shifted the scene
of the tragedy to the westward again, and the party struck
north-west to the Warrego.</p>

<p>More blacks were met with who confirmed the tale, and one guided
them to a water hole in a brigalow scrub, which she. said was the
place where the tragedy was enacted. She also stated that she was
present, and entered into a most minute description of the affair,
describing the whole attack. Not the vestige of a trace could be
found to give any colour to her story, but ten miles down the river
an unmistakeable camping ground was found. There was a tree marked
L, the letter being roughly cut into the bark, and inside the
letter, X V A was carved; also there were indications that proved
that a party of whites had been camped there during wet
weather.</p>

<p>Still led on by the natives, Hely at last reached the Nivelle
River, when his guides deserted him, and he returned.</p>

<p>On the Warrego he found another camp with a marked tree, exactly
similar to the first one, the X V A being repeated, so that it
could not have been intended to mean any distinguishing number. He
also noticed amongst the natives some tomahawks formed from the
battered gullet plates of saddles. His search served only to deepen
the mystery around Leichhardt's fate.</p>

<p>The meaning of the marked tree discovered on the Warrego is
perplexing, both on account of the recurring letters and its
connection with an old camping ground of some white party.
Mitchell's party were camped in the neighbourhood for some time;
his camps were marked from XLI. to XLIll., but the weather was fine
and dry during his stay. Kennedy encamped twice in the locality,
and he had with him a man named Luff, whereas no name in Mitchell's
camp began with L; but he, too, crossed the river when the weather
was dry, and no bushman could possibly make a mistake about the
state of the country during the time a large party had remained
stationary in a certain position.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is that these marks had nothing
whatever to do with. either Mitchell, Kennedy or Leichhardt, having
probably been made by some private party out run hunting.</p>

<p>This futile effort to track up the lost explorer has led us away
from Western Australia, where again the desert country was to be
encountered, and again fruitlessly.</p>

<p>In 1854, Mr. Robert Austin, Assistant Surveyor-General, was
given charge of a party to search for available pastoral country,
and also (for now the gold fever was at its height), to examine the
interior for auriferous deposits.</p>

<p>They started from the head of the Swan River, on a northeasterly
course, and on the 16th of July, reached the Cow-cowing Lake,
reported by the aborigines, and hoped by the colonists, to be a
sheet of fresh water in the Gascoyne valley. The take proved to be
dry, and the bed covered with salt incrustation, showing its
character when full. Thence Austin made directly north, and passed
through the wretchedly-repellent country that seemed fated to
always cross the path of the western explorer; he directed his
course to a distant range of table-topped hills and peaks. Here
they found feed and water, and named the highest point Mount
Kenneth, after one of the party, Mr. Kenneth Brown. From thence to
the north-east they traversed stony plains, broken by sandstone and
ironstone ridges, and intersected by the dry beds of sandy
watercourses; and in this country, one of the worst possible
misfortunes happened to them. Their horses got on to a patch of
poison plant, and nearly the whole of them were laid up in
consequence, and unfit for work. Some few escaped, but the greater
number never recovered the effects of the weed, and many died.
Pushing hastily on to a safer place to recruit, Austin found
himself so crippled by this accident, that he had to abandon all
but his most necessary stores for no less than fourteen of the
horses having succumbed.</p>

<p>They now turned north-west to make for Shark's Bay, where a
vessel was to be sent to render them assistance or bring them away,
as should be desired.</p>

<p>Their course to Shark's Bay led them over country that offered
them no temptation to linger on the way. On the 21st September they
found a cave in the face of a cliff, in which were drawings similar
to those seen by Gray near the Prince Regent's River. Near this
cave was a spring, and, while resting at this camp, one of the
party, a young man named Charles Farmer, accidentally shot himself
in the arm, and in spite of the most careful attention, the poor
fellow died of lock-jaw, in terrible agony. He was buried at the
cave spring camp, and the highest hill in the neighbourhood called
Mount Farmer after him. Thus two lonely mountains in the desert
interior watch over the graves of men who first saw them-Mount
Poole and Mount Farmer.</p>

<p>They now got on to the head waters of the Murchison, or rather
the dry channels of these tributaries, and at last reached the
Murchison itself; a river with a deep-cut channel, but perfectly
dry. Beyond this their efforts were in vain, they fought their way
to within a hundred miles of Shark's Bay, but they had then been so
long without water that it was courting certain death to proceed.
Even during the retreat to the Murchison the lives of the horses
were only saved by the party accidentally finding a small native
well in a most unexpected situation, namely, in the middle of a
bare ironstone plain.</p>

<p>Pushing on ahead of his party, Austin reached the Murchison
twenty-five miles south-west of his former course, but the river
was the same, or worse, tantalising him with pools of salt
water.</p>

<p>A desperate search was made to the southward, during a day of
fierce and terrible heat, and when in utter despair they, on the
second day, made for some small hills that they sighted,
providentially, they found both water and grass. The whole of the
party were then moved to this spot, which out of gratitude was
named Mount Welcome.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted by the sufferings he had undergone, Austin now
made another attempt to reach Shark's Bay. On their way to the
Murchison they captured an old native, and took him with them to
point out the watering places of the blacks. At first he was able
to show them one or two that they would probably have missed, but
after they had crossed the Murchison and got some distance to the
westward, the watering places the native had relied on were found
to be dry, and it was only after the most acute sufferings from
thirst, and the loss of some more horses, that they managed to
straggle back to Mount Welcome. Austin's conduct during these
terrible marches seems to have approached the heroic. When his
companions fell off one by one and laid down to die, and the native
inhabitant of the wilds was cowering weeping under a bush, he
managed to reach the little well that the blackfellow had formerly
shown them, and without resting, tramped back with water to revive
his exhausted comrades.</p>

<p>Arrived at Mount Welcome, they found the water there on the
point of giving out, and weak as they all were, an instant start
had to be made for the Geraldine mine, where a small settlement had
been formed to work the galena lode discovered by Gregory. The
prospect before them was most discouraging; to the mine the
distance was one hundred and sixty miles, and to the highest point
on the Murchison, where Gregory had found water, which would be
their first stage, was ninety miles, but it had to be done. They
started at midnight, and by means of forced marches, travelling day
and night, reached Gregory's old camp on the river; having
fortunately found a small supply of water at one place on the way.
From this point they followed the river down, obtaining water from
springs in the banks, and on the 20th November arrived at the mine,
where they were warmly entertained. From thence they returned, some
by sea and some by land, to Perth.</p>

<p>Austin's exploration had led to no profitable result. The large
lake (Moore), that had so hampered Gregory, was found to be an arm
or outlet of the still larger Cow-cowing, and that was about all.
The upper Murchison had not turned out at all well, and the whole
summary of the journal amounts to repetitions of daily struggles
with a barren and waterless district, under the fiery sun of the
southern summer.</p>

<p>Austin thought that eastward of his limit the country would
improve, but subsequent explorations have not borne this out. He
had singularly hard fortune to contend against; after the serious
loss he sustained in having his horses poisoned, an accident that
the greatest care will not always prevent, he was pitted against
some of the worst country in Australia&mdash;dry, impenetrably
scrubby, and barren; and this, too, during the hottest part of the
year. That he succeeded in bringing his party safely through such
difficulties, was in itself a most wonderful achievement.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In 1855, public interest was once more excited in the mysterious
disappearance of Leichhardt; this brought forward the question of
further exploration in the interior, and some generous offers were
made by private individuals to provide money for the outfit of a
party. The English Government, however, working through New South
Wales, took the matter in hand and furnished the necessary
funds.</p>

<p>The command was given to A. C. Gregory, who had with him the
celebrated botanist, Dr. Mueller, and his brother H. C. Gregory.
Mr. Elsey, surgeon and naturalist, Mr. Baines, artist, and the
requisite number of men made the party up to a total of eighteen.
Their live stock consisted of horses and sheep.</p>

<p>The plan of the expedition was to proceed north to the Victoria
River, which from the report of Captain Stokes was then considered
an important stream, and probably a means of easily gaining the
interior.</p>

<p>On the 18th July, 1855, they left Sydney for Moreton Bay, in the
barque <i>Monarch</i>, attended by the schooner <i>Tom Tough</i>.
At Moreton Bay they took on board the remainder of the party, with
fifty horses and two hundred sheep, and after some accidents caused
by the <i>Monarch</i> running on a reef, reached Point Pearce at
the mouth of the Victoria River, on the 24th September. Here the
horses were landed, much weakened by their voyage, and Gregory, Dr.
Mueller, and seven men proceeded to the upper part of the Victoria
overland, leaving the schooner to work her way up the river with
the sheep on board. The land party first made the Macadam Range, so
named by Stokes, thence they went to the Fitzmaurice River, where
their horses were attacked by alligators and three of them severely
wounded; and on the 10th of October they reached the Victoria, and
rejoined the remainder of the party. Unfortunately, troubles had
now set in, the schooner was aground on a bank eight miles below
the camp, and having sprung a leak a considerable quantity of
stores were damaged; the sheep, too, had been foolishly kept penned
up on board, and so many had died that when finally landed the
number was reduced to about forty. All this considerably weakened
Gregory's resources.</p>

<p>An attempt to ascend the river in an india-rubber boat was a
failure, the craft not being adapted to surmount the obstacles
encountered in the shape of rocky bars. On the 24th of November,
Gregory, with his brother, Dr. Mueller, and Wilson, followed the
Victoria to the south, on horseback. The party reached latitude 161
south, finding the tributary sources of the river to flow from fine
open plains, and level forest country, all well grassed. From this
point they returned to camp.</p>

<p>On the 3rd January, 1856, another start was made, with a much
larger party, consisting of eight men and thirty horses. On
reaching their old point below the 16th parallel, a depôt camp was
formed, and accompanied by Dr. Mueller, his brother, and one man,
Gregory advanced south. The head of the Victoria was found sooner
than expected, and crossing the watershed, and following down some
small creeks running south through the tableland, they reached a
grassy plain in which these watercourses were lost; beyond, the
country was sandy and barren. A westerly course was then kept, and
on the 15th the head of a creek was reached, which turning at first
northerly, afterwards kept a distinct S.W. course for about three
hundred miles. The country passed through for a large portion of
the upper part was good available pastoral land, but as the lower
part of the creek was reached a more desert formation took its
place, and at last the creek terminated in extensive salt lakes.
Beyond this point no continuation of the channel could be found,
and Gregory too easily recognised the aspect of the desert country
that had baffled him before. The creek was named Sturt's Creek, and
a prominent hill, parallel with the lowest salt lake was called
Mount Mueller. The party then retraced their steps; the water on
which they depended in Sturt's Creek drying up so rapidly as to
render more extended exploration very hazardous. They rejoined
their companions at the depôt camp on the Victoria, and making a
detour to the eastward, followed down the Wickham, a considerable
tributary of the Victoria, to its junction with that river.</p>

<p>Arrangements were now made for the homeward journey by way of
the Gulf of Carpentaria; the <i>Tom Tough</i> having been repaired
and caulked, started for Timor, to obtain more provisions, and then
return and meet the party at a rendezvous appointed on the Albert
River. The land party consisted of the leader and his brother, Dr.
Mueller, Elsey, and three men. They started on the 21st June.</p>

<p>Following up an eastern tributary of the Victoria, they crossed
on to a creek running into the Roper, which was called the Elsey,
and on this creek a camp was found, which suggested the idea that
it had been occupied by whites. It consisted of the framework of a
substantial-looking hut, of a different shape to that usually made
by the natives; but no marked trees were found, nor anything more
seen to confirm the supposition. Thence the party followed down the
Roper for some distance, and then crossing the head waters of the
Limmen Bight River, skirted the Gulf at some considerable way south
of Leichhardt's track, crossing the same rivers that he did, only
higher up on their courses. They struck the Nicholson far above
where it had been so named by Leichhardt, and following it down
reached the rendezvous at the Albert River (which is the outlet of
the Nicholson), but the schooner had not arrived.</p>

<p>Gregory determined not to wait, but to proceed home overland. He
buried a note at the foot of a marked tree for the information of
the schooner people when they should arrive, and on the 3rd of
September started. Two days' journey from the true Albert, they
reached a stream which Leichhardt had erroneously taken for that
river, and many of the errors in his map may be traced as being due
to this cause.</p>

<p>This also has led to a good deal of confusion about the Plains
of Promise so much vaunted by Captain Stokes, Leichhardt mistaking
the level country on the river that bears his name for the spot.
Gregory, who rightly identified the place, professes great
disappointment with them compared to what he had been led to
expect. Since then many conflicting opinions have been given as to
their value. Settlement, however, as it generally does, decided the
question; they have been found to be very suitable for cattle, but
quite unadapted for sheep breeding. Stokes gave them a taking name,
which probably led to a false estimate being entertained, as the
country is in no way superior to the district to the eastward.</p>

<p>On the morning Gregory left the Leichhardt his party was
attacked by the blacks, who were, however, easily repulsed, the
leading native being shot in the short struggle. The Flinders was
crossed on the 9th of September, but Gregory did not think that it
gave promise of draining a very large extent of country. Instead,
therefore, of following it up, and thereby lessening his journey,
and discovering the beautiful pastoral downs that this most
important river flows through, he wandered away to the north, and
followed up the Gilbert River, thus duplicating, only further to
the south, the eccentric course of Leichhardt. The dividing
watershed was crossed on the basaltic plateau at the head of the
Burdekin, and this stream was traced to the Suttor junction, where
Leichhardt first struck it. They travelled on up the Suttor, and
also up the Belyando, connecting with Major Mitchell's track. Their
course then lay through the country traversed by Leichhardt on both
his expeditions, watered by the Mackenzie and the Comet, and on the
22nd November the party reached a station on the Dawson owned by
Messrs. Fitz and Connor.</p>

<p>This successful conclusion to such an extensive expedition as he
had undertaken, stamped Gregory as possessing the highest
qualifications for an explorer. His travels embraced journeys
extending over a distance of nearly five thousand miles, and he was
absent in all sixteen months. His equipment certainly was of the
very best, but a series of unfortunate accidents, which could not
have been prevented, left him nearly as short as some of his
brother explorers had been. One thing about this journey of
Gregory's has always been regretted&mdash;the short and scanty
record which he published, it being little more than a list of
dates, and the distances daily travelled. However we may lament
this reticence from a man of Gregory's ability and reputation, it
is a pity that his example in this respect had not been followed by
some of the explorers of the last two decades.</p>

<p>During Gregory's absence Australia bad lost her renowned
explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. He died on the 15th October, near
Sydney. He had served on the staff of the Duke of Wellington during
the Peninsular War, and in addition to his energy and activity in
the field, was a well read and accomplished scholar.</p>

<p>The unsolved puzzle of the extent, direction, and boundaries of
Lake Torrens still occupied the attention and exercised the minds
of the South Australian colonists. It seemed almost like a region
of enchantment, so conflicting were the accounts brought in by
different parties, and so contradictory the statements made.</p>

<p>In 1851, two squatters in search of a run, Messrs. Oakden and
Hulkes, pushed out to the western side of Lake Torrens, and
according to their account found a most favourable land. They
discovered a lake of fresh water, surrounded with good country; and
the natives told them of other lakes to the north-west; also
'introducing descriptions of strange animals, whose appearance
could have only been equalled by that of the <i>jimbra</i>, or
apes, of Western Australia, which ruthless animals, according to
blackfellows' legend, devoured the survivors of Leichhardt's party,
as they straggled into the confines of that colony. Their horses
giving in, Oakden and Hulkes returned; but although they applied
for a squatting license for the country they had visited, it was
not then settled or stocked. In 1856 Mr. Babbage made some
explorations on the field to the north, traversed by Eyre and
Frome. He penetrated to the plains which were supposed to occupy
the central portion of the horseshoe; but, more successful than his
predecessors, he found permanent water in a gum creek, and saw some
fair-sized sheets of water, one of which he named Blanche Water, or
Lake Blanche.</p>

<p>Some excursions to the south-east led to the discovery of some
more fresh water and well-grassed pastoral country, and the natives
directed him to a crossing-place in that portion of Lake Torrens
that had been sighted in 1845, by Messrs. Poole and Browne, of
Captain Sturt's party. Babbage, however, failed to find the place,
and lost his horse in the attempt to cross.</p>

<p>In 1857, a Mr. Campbell made an excursion to the west of Lake
Torrens, and discovered a creek with fresh water in it, which he
called the Elizabeth. He finally came to Lake Torrens which he
found in the same condition as other explorers had
done&mdash;surrounded by barren country.</p>

<p>In April of the same year, a survey in the country where Babbage
had been exploring was conducted by Deputy Surveyor-General Goyder,
and he certainly got into the land of enchantment. A few miles
north of Blanche Water he found many springs bubbling out of the
ground, around a fine lagoon, and north was an isolated hill, which
he named Weathered Hill. From the summit of this hill he had a fine
specimen of the effect produced by refraction. To the north, or
thereabouts, he saw a belt of gigantic gum-trees show out, beyond
which appeared a sheet of water with elevated lands on the far
side, while to the east was another large lake; all this, however,
was but the glamourie of the desert. The gigantic gum trees
dwindled down to stunted bushes, and the rising ground to broken
clods of earth.</p>

<p>But the greatest surprise was reserved for the time Goyder
actually reached Lake Torrens, for he found the water quite fresh.
He described it as stretching from fifteen to twenty miles to the
north-west, with a water horizon; an extensive bay forming to the
southward, while to the north a bluff headland and perpendicular
cliffs were clearly discerned with a telescope. From the appearance
of the flood-marks, Goyder came to the conclusion that there was
little or no rise and fall in the lake, inferring therefrom that
its size would absorb the flood waters without showing any
variation of level.</p>

<p>No wonder that the good people of Adelaide were overjoyed when
they heard the news. The threatening desert that hemmed in their
fair province on the north had been suddenly converted into the
promised land. Colonel Freeling, the Surveyor-General, immediately
started out, taking with him both a boat and an iron punt with
which to float on these new-found waters.</p>

<p>What must have been the public feeling when a letter was
received from the Surveyor-General, saying that the cliffs the
headlands, and the grassy shores, where all built up on the basis
of the mirage. The elfs and sprites of this desolate region had
been playing a hoax on the former party.</p>

<p>It will be remembered in Sturt's expedition, how Poole came back
and reported confidently having seen the inland sea, and how Gray
on the west coast led his companions a tramp, after a receding lake
that they never overtook, it is scarcely to be wondered at then,
that Goyder was deceived, more particularly after finding the water
of Lake Torrens fresh, when it had always been represented as
salt.</p>

<p>On reaching the lake, Freeling found the water almost fresh, but
one of Goyder's men who was with him said that the water had
already receded half a mile. An attempt to float the punt was made,
but after dragging it through mud and a few inches of water for a
quarter of a mile; the idea was abandoned. Freeling, and some of
the party then started to wade through the slush, but after getting
three miles, found no water deeper than six inches. Some of the
more adventurous went further still, but only to meet with a like
result. The Surveyor-General returned a disappointed man, and the
unavailability of Lake Torrens was confirmed.</p>

<p>During this time&mdash;1857&mdash;Mr. Hack started with a party
from Streaky Bay to examine the Gawler Ranges of Eyre, and
investigate the country west of Lake Torrens. He reached the Gawler
Range and examined the country very patiently, finding numerous
springs, and large plains of both grass and saltbush, also sighting
a large salt lake (Lake Gairdner). On the whole, his report was a
very favourable one.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with Hack's trip, a party under Major Warburton,
was out in the same direction, in fact Hack's party crossed
Warburton's track on one or two occasions. Warburton's account was
contradictory of Hack's; he reported the country dry and arid, and
found very little to say in favour of it.</p>

<p>Of the two men, however, it is probable that Hack's experience
enabled him to judge with most truth of the value of land seen
under unfavourable conditions.</p>

<p>This year of 1857 was rife with explorations in South Australia.
A party of settlers consisting of Messrs. Swinden, Campbell,
Thompson, and Stock set out, and at about seventy miles from the
head of Spencer's Gulf, found fine pastoral country, and a
permanent waterhole, <i>Pernatty</i>. To the northward they came
upon the Elizabeth, formerly discovered by Campbell, and here from
want of provisions they returned. A month afterwards Swinden
started again from <i>Pernatty</i>, and found available pastoral
land north of the Gawler Ranges, which became known as Swinden's
country. During this year, also, Messrs. Miller and Dutton explored
the country at the back of Fowler's Bay. Forty miles to the north
they saw treeless plains stretching far inland, but they found no
permanent water. Warburton afterwards reported deprecatingly of
this country, but Messrs. Delisser and Hardwicke in their turn
stated that it was first-class pastoral land, if water could be
obtained. Judging from Major Warburton's career as an explorer, he
seemed quite unable to judge correctly of the value of country when
seen under an adverse season, and it is only one of the many
instances of the necessity of a <i>station</i> training to
adequately fit a man to pronounce definite judgment on the
availability or non-availability of country. One of Warburton's
suggestions to the South Australian Government was to explore the
interior-which had proved such a difficult nut to crack&mdash;by
means of the <i>police</i>. One has to know the country well to
fully appreciate the exquisite humour of this suggestion.</p>

<p>Before referring to two expeditions, both of great importance,
one under A. C. Gregory, and the other by Frank Gregory, it may be
as well to pursue the fortunes of the Lake Torrens explorers to the
end.</p>

<p>In 1858, the South Australian Government voted a sum of money to
fit out a party to continue the northern explorations. This party
was put under the leadership of Mr. Babbage, and his instructions
were to examine the country between Lake Torrens and the
lately-discovered Lake Gairdner, and to survey and map the
respective western and eastern shores of the two lakes, so as to
remove for the future any doubts as to their true formation and
position. This alone, apart from any more extended explorations,
meant a work of considerable time; but, unfortunately for Babbage,
the survey work was generally regarded as but of secondary
importance, and the public looked eagerly forward to hearing of the
discovery of new pasture lands, especially as the outfit had been
on a most liberal scale. Considerable delay (whether avoidable or
not, it is scarcely worth while to discuss) happened during the
outset of this expedition; for, although the party was reported
ready on the 11th February, the end of August found Babbage back in
Port Augusta having passed the intervening months in surveying the
shores of the two large lakes, and making short excursions to the
westward, over a country that had been several times traversed by
private parties looking for land. At Port Augusta he was
considerably surprised to find that his second in command, Harris,
had started south to Adelaide, with a great many of the horses and
drays. Babbage pursued, and overtook them at Mount Remarkable,
after riding one hundred and sixty miles. Here he found that fresh
instructions had been issued by the Government, and forwarded by
Charles Gregory, lately arrived with his brother from the
north.</p>

<p>The explanation was, that A. C. Gregory's expedition in search
of Leichhardt had arrived in Adelaide during Babbage's absence, and
it having been successfully conducted with the aid of packhorses
only, the South Australian Government came to the conclusion that
Babbage would manage just as well without the drays, and engaged,
and sent Charles Gregory to join him, and inform him that his
expedition was in future to be conducted in a like manner. Not
finding Babbage at his camp, Gregory had started the drays and
draught horses home on his own authority. Babbage ordered his men
back, but they refused to go; so after writing to the Government,
complaining of the treatment he had received, he returned north
with a small party and six months' provisions. He arrived at the
boundary of his late surveys, and pushing on reached Chambers'
Creek, so named by Stuart, who had discovered it during Babbage's
absence at Lake Gairdner.</p>

<p>This creek, which Babbage called Stuart's Creek, he traced to a
large salt lake, which he christened Lake Gregory, now known as
Lake Eyre. From here he made to a range which he called Hermit
Range, but from its summit could see no sign of Lake Torrens, and
came to the just conclusion that it did not extend so far. West of
Lake Eyre the explorers found a hot spring, and afterwards many
more were discovered.</p>

<p>Meantime, Major Warburton had been sent to supersede Babbage,
and during the time the latter gentleman was making these
discoveries, Warburton was searching for him. This result had come
about partly through the appearance of Babbage at Mount Remarkable,
and partly through the return of Messrs. Stuart and Forster, who
reported good country beyond Babbage's furthest, which naturally
made the public think that that explorer should have been the first
to find it.</p>

<p>On arriving at the camp on the Elizabeth, Warburton, who had C.
Gregory with him as a second, found Babbage absent, so he sent
Gregory after him to bring him back, and after waiting some time,
determined to go himself, and a comical sort of hunt commenced,
ending in Warburton coming up with Babbage at Lake Eyre, and there
carrying out the duty imposed upon him, in a manner that says
little for his generosity of spirit.</p>

<p>During this game of hunt-the-slipper, Warburton had made some
minor discoveries on his own account. He had come upon fairly good
country west of the lakes, and had found the springs which he
christened Beresford Springs; he also discovered the Douglas, a
creek which afterwards greatly assisted Stuart to push forward, and
a range which he called the Davenport Range. He had got north-west
of where Babbage was, and in fact afterwards disputed that
explorer's claim to the discovery of Lake Eyre.</p>

<p>It seems only in keeping with the paradoxical nature of our
continent that this blundering expedition should have been so
conducive in establishing the great geographical fact that had so
long puzzled the colonists, namely, the definite size and shape of
Lake Torrens. No longer was this terror of the north to extend its
encircling arms against all advancement. Henceforth, its isolated
character was decided, and the supposed continuations known under
independent names.</p>

<p>Of the whole conduct of the expedition, the less said the
better; the Government instructions were vacillating and
contradictory; Babbage was slow and apathetic, Warburton pompous
and arbitrary; and in the end the affair was further degraded by an
old-womanish wrangle between the two explorers as to the priority
of certain discoveries.</p>

<p>During this year, Surveyor Parry had advanced into what was then
supposed to be the horseshoe of Lake Torrens, and found in many
places both fresh water and fairly available country.</p>

<p>This time it is with more cheering tidings that we turn once
again to the work of exploration in Western Australia.</p>

<p>On the 16th April, during this same year of 1858, when some
exploring tarantula seemed to have bitten all the colonies, Frank
Gregory left the Geraldine mine on the Murchison, where it will be
remembered the gallant Austin and party arrived in such a critical
state, to endeavour to reach the Gascoyne and the upper reaches of
the coast rivers.</p>

<p>Following up the Murchison for some distance, Gregory, finding
but little feed, although the country was not quite so scrubby as
usual, struck north-east, and coming to a large channel with a due
northern course, followed it down, and on the 3rd of May, to his
great joy, reached the long-sought Gascoyne. It was flowing from
the eastward and running west, but soon changed its course to the
north, thence north-west, thence west and south until the junction
of a large river from the north-west was reached. From this
junction the Gascoyne ran due west straight for Shark's Bay, and on
the 17th May, Gregory reached the mouth of the river. Returning, he
explored the tributary from the north-west, which he named the
Lyons, and which he followed for a considerable distance, until he
came to a high mountain, three thousand five hundred feet above sea
level, which he called Mount Augustus. From the summit he had a
splendid view north and east, and traced the course of the river
far to the eastward. Turning southeast, and crossing tributaries of
the Gascoyne, and the main river itself, they reached another lofty
hill-Mount Gould&mdash;from the top of which Gregory thought he
could infer the course of the Murchison for nearly one hundred
miles.</p>

<p>Following the Murchison down, they arrived at the Geraldine
mine, having in the space of a little over two months completed a
trip which resulted in the most favourable manner. Good pastoral
country, well-watered, the great want of the settlers, had been
discovered, only awaiting the finding of an available port to at
once invite settlement. After so many bitter disappointments this
was a much-needed encouragement to the colony.</p>

<p>Still in the fruitful year of 1858, we must accompany the elder
brother, A. C. Gregory, on his Barcoo expedition. This expedition
was organised in order to search for some traces of the course of
Leichhardt's party, and although there was little hope of finding
him, or any of his party, still alive, there was a great
probability of at least ascertaining the route he had travelled,
and possibly rescuing part of his journals.</p>

<p>The freshly awakened interest in the fate of the lost party may
or may not have sprung from the story of a convict, in confinement
in Sydney, which has since been repeated with various
alterations.</p>

<p>This man, whose name was Garbut, started a wild and improbable
legend about the existence, in the interior, of a settlement of
escaped convicts, amongst whom Leichhardt and his band were held
prisoners, lest they should reveal the whereabouts of the runaways.
Of course such a story, which might have obtained credence in the
very early days, was at once scouted; but it, at any rate, turned
public attention to the strange fact that, in spite of the many
explorations of the past ten years, no sign nor token of the
missing men had ever been seen.</p>

<p>A. C. Gregory then with his brother and seven men started on the
quest. They were equipped for rapid travelling, taking with them
only pack horses to carry their provisions. The leader followed the
now well-known track to the Warrego, and crossing the head of the
Nive, reached the Barcoo waters on the 16th April. If the marked
trees seen by Hely were Leichhardt's there was a great probability
that they would thus be on his tracks to the west, and a sharp
look-out was kept on both sides of river, which resulted in the
discovery in about 241 deg. south latitude, and 145 deg. east
longitude, of a tree marked L, on the eastern bank, and in the
neighbourhood were stumps of trees, felled by an axe. Although
Leichhardt could not have foreseen his fate, it is unfortunate that
he did not mark his trees in a more unmistakeable manner, for a
mysterious L without date seems to turn up in all parts of our
continent.</p>

<p>This memorial of the visit of some white men Gregory thought
might be Leichhardt's, especially as the letter was very large,
after the manner of some of the trees marked on that explorer's
former journeys. It may be as well to mention here that this was
all that was found, and the journey henceforth was only one of pure
exploration.</p>

<p>The travellers found the country suffering under a
long-continued drought, and. feed for the horses very hard to get.
Necessarily, Gregory's picture of it is very different to Sir
Thomas Mitchell's; but it would be scarcely worth while to compare
the two statements now, considering that the reputation of the land
as one of the best sheep-breeding districts in Australia has long
since been established.</p>

<p>Knowing what Kennedy had encountered on the lower part of the
river, and anticipating finding more traces of Leichhardt to the
westward. Gregory, on reaching the Thomson, followed that river up
for some distance, but turned back disheartened at the want of
grass, although the river was running from recent rains. It must be
remembered that he was there in the beginning of the winter, when
there is little or no spring in the grass, even after heavy
rain.</p>

<p>Returning to the junction of the two rivers, he followed down
the united stream, and soon found himself involved in the same
difficulties that had beset Kennedy. The river broke up into
countless channels, running through barren, fissured plains.
Toiling on over these, with an occasional interlude of sand hills,
Gregory at last reached that portion of Cooper's Creek visited by
Sturt. This he now followed down to where Strzelecki's Creek left
the main stream and carried off some of the surplus flood water to
the south.</p>

<p>Gregory followed on the many channels trending west, but finally
lost them amongst sand hills and flooded plains. He turned back and
once more struck Strzelecki's Creek, which he thought he traced to
Lake Torrens. This lake he crossed on a firm sandy space, through
which he could distinguish no connecting channel, thus helping to
rob Lake Torrens of some more of its terrors. He soon arrived in
the settled districts, having safely accomplished a most successful
journey.</p>

<p>The main discovery that was the most valuable outcome of this
trip was, of course, the confirmation of the supposed identity of
the Barcoo and Cooper's Creek; as Gregory was otherwise on the
tracks of former explorers, no fresh discoveries could well be
expected on the course he followed.</p>

<p>Thus, after many fruitless efforts and disappointments, the
second great inland river system was evolved.</p>

<p>We now meet with an old friend in the field, in the person of J.
M'Dowall Stuart, formerly draughtsman for Captain Sturt, and one of
the party who bought experience of heat, thirst, and desolation,
during their long imprisonment in the depôt glen.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1858, Stuart left Oratunga for an excursion to
the north-west of Swinden's country, west of Lake Torrens. He was
delayed some time before he finally got away from Octaina, on the
10th June. Passing Mr. Babbage, he arrived at the Elizabeth on the
18th, but was disappointed in the expectations he had formed. Soon
afterwards he found a large hole of permanent water, which he
called Andamoka, and on the 23rd June caught sight of one of the
arms of Lake Torrens. From here he followed a creek (Yarraout) to
the north-west, in search of the country called Wingillpin that the
blacks had told him of. This he was unable to find, and came to the
somewhat strange conclusion that Wingillpin and Cooper's Creek were
one and the same, although so widely separated, as he well knew. He
also seems to have entertained broad notions of the extent of
Cooper's Creek, as in one part of his journal at this period he
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"My only hope now of cutting Cooper's Creek is on the
other side of the range. The plain we crossed to-day resembles
those of the Cooper, also the grasses. If it is not there it must
run to the north-west, and form the Glenelg of Captain
Grey."</blockquote>

<p>Now although we know that Grey held rather extravagant notions
of the importance of the Glenelg River on the northwest coast,
which time has certainly not confirmed, even he would scarcely have
imagined it possible for it to be the outlet of such a mighty
stream as Cooper's Creek would have become by the time it reached
there.</p>

<p>Stuart's horses were now very lame, as the stony ground had worn
out their shoes, and they had no spare sets with them. Failing,
therefore, to find the promised land of Wingillpin, although he had
passed over much good and well-watered country, and had also found
Chambers' Creek, he turned south-west, and made some explorations
in the neighbourhood and to the west of Lake Gairdner. Thence he
steered for Fowler's Bay, and his' description of some of the
country on his course is anything but inviting. From a spur of the
high peak that he named Mount Fincke he saw&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"A prospect gloomy in the extreme; I could see a long
distance but nothing met the eye save a dense scrub, as black and
dismal as night."</blockquote>

<p>From here they got fairly into a sandy, spinifex desert, which
Stuart says was worse than Sturt's, for there, there was a little
salt-bush; "here there was nothing but spinifex to be found and the
horses were foodless."</p>

<p>Things were getting desperate with the little band, their
provisions were finished, but still the leader would not desist
from looking for good country; but at last he had to make back as
fast as he could. Dense scrub, and the same "dreary, dreadful,
dismal desert," as he calls it, accompanied them day after day.
Tired out and half-starved, they reached the coast, and then they
had only two meals left to take them to Streaky Bay, one hundred
miles away, where they hoped to find relief, and where they safely
arrived at Mr. Gibson's station. Here they were laid up with the
sudden change from starvation to a full diet, and for some days
Stuart was very ill. They finally reached Mr. Thompson's station of
Mount Arden, which terminated Stuart's first expedition.</p>

<p>This severe trip only gave Stuart a fresh taste for adventure.
In April, 1859, he made another start, and on the 19th, after
crossing over some of the already known country, Hergott, one of
his companions, discovered the well-known springs that still bear
his name. Stuart crossed Chambers' Creek, and made for the
Davenport Range, of Warburton, finding many of the springs
resembling those mound ones crowned with reeds already mentioned.
On the 6th June, he discovered a large creek, which he called the
Neale. It ran through very good country, and Stuart followed it
down, hoping to find its importance increase; and in this he was
not disappointed, as large plains covered with grass and salt bush
were crossed, and several more springs discovered. After satisfying
himself of the extent and value of the country he had found, Stuart
started back, his horse's shoes having again given out, and he had
a lively remembrance of the misery he suffered before from want of
them.</p>

<p>In November of the same year, he made a third expedition in the
vicinity of Lake Eyre, but there is very little of interest
attaching to his journal, as his course was mostly over
much-trodden country. He reached the Neale again, and instituted a
survey of the good country he had formerly traversed, occasionally
approaching to within sight of what he calls Lake Torrens, but
which was in reality Lake Eyre. All these minor expeditions of
Stuart's may be considered as preparatory to his great struggle to
find a passage across the continent; for which work these trips
gave him a good knowledge of the country he had to face, and its
difficulties. Stuart's efforts to cross Australia from south to
north, and the expeditions made by others with a like object, will
occupy the undivided attention of the reader so much, that in order
not to lose the thread of the narrative of this peculiar and marked
epoch in Australian history, it may be better to here notice an
important journey undertaken in Western Australia, although
slightly out of chronological order.</p>

<p>It was an expedition organised partly by the Imperial, and
partly by the Colonial Governments, and was also aided by private
subscription. Frank Gregory, the successful explorer of the
Gascoyne, was put in charge of it. They left Perth in the
<i>Dolphin</i> for Nickol Bay, on the north-west coast, where they
intended to land their horses and commence operations. This was
safely accomplished, and on 25th May, 1861, the party started.</p>

<p>Their first important discovery on a westerly course was a large
river coming from the south, which they named the Fortescue. This
stream they followed up until impeded by a very narrow, precipitous
gorge, when they left the river, and made for a range they had
sighted to the south. This range, which was called Hammersley
Range, they attempted to cross, without success, so the explorers
turned to the north-east, and came again on the Fortescue, above
the gorge, and after some difficulty traced it to the range,
through which it forced a passage. Crossing the range, partly by
the aid of the river-bed, and partly by a gap, they came to fair
average country stretching away to the southward. On this course
the large and important river, the Ashburton, was found, which was
traced upwards, flowing through a very large extent of good
pastoral country. On the 25th of June, from the top of a sandstone
tableland, they sighted Mount Augustus, at the head of the Lyons
River. The view was most promising. Open forest and undulating
country took the place of the everlasting scrubs and rocks, that
had been such common objects with them, and well satisfied with
what they saw the explorers turned north.</p>

<p>Mount Samson and Mount Bruce, two most prominent peaks of the
Hammersley Range, were named by Gregory on his return; the latter
being considered by him the highest point in Western Australia.
From here they struck back to the coast, their horses having become
terribly foot-sore, and reached the sea forty miles from Nickol
Bay, and on the 19th arrived at their rendezvous in that bay, where
the ship was awaiting them. After a rest of ten days, Gregory
started again, and to the eastward found the Yule River; thence
they crossed to the Shaw, and still pushing east they succeeded in
penetrating a considerable way into the tableland, where they found
good grass and springs. On the 26th of August a fine stream running
to the north was discovered, and named the De Grey; and after
crossing ail immense plain they came to another river, which was
christened the Oakover. Up this river Gregory went, the men
admiring the rich foliage of the drooping ti-trees that bordered
the long reaches of water, and the horses appreciating the wide
grassy flats on either bank.</p>

<p>Finding the course of the river trending too much westerly, they
crossed to a tributary of the Oakover and thence passed easterly
through a small range. Here he was confronted by a most unwelcome
sight. Before him were the hills of drifted sand, the barren plains
and the ominous red haze of the desert. So far he had encountered
fewer obstacles and made more encouraging discoveries than had
fallen to the lot of any other Western Australian explorer; and
now, the desert had drawn its forbidding hand suddenly across his
track, and sternly ordered him to halt.</p>

<p>Gregory made one effort of eighteen miles across the red sand
dunes, but his 'horses were not equal to the task, and he returned
to his camp at the foot of the range.</p>

<p>After resting for a day, he started with two companions for a
final attempt, leaving the remainder camped to await his return,
with instructions, if the water failed, to fall back on the
Oakover. This excursion nearly proved fatal; the heat was something
terrible, and when well advanced in the sand ridges, the horses
gave in altogether. Afar to the east, a distant range was faintly
visible, and a granite range could be seen to the south, about ten
miles distant. These granite hills were their only hope, and to
them they turned.</p>

<p>Across the sand hills now, instead of running parallel with
them, the horses at once gave up, and, leaving his comrades to
drive them on as best they could, Gregory pushed towards the goal
on foot, but when he reached it no sign of verdure or moisture
greeted him. Blasted, scorched, and barren the rocks and rugged
ravines lay before him, and all his weary searching resulted only
in his completely breaking down with distress and fatigue. When his
companions came up with the dying horses there was nothing to do
but make preparations to get back as soon as they could to the
depôt, trusting that the want of water might not have compelled the
main party to abandon the camp.</p>

<p>By dawn the wearied men commenced their retreat, but when the
heat of the day set in, the poor, thirsty horses of course began to
fail; and Gregory, too, was so completely exhausted with his
previous day's efforts that he could not keep up with the other
two. One of the party, Brown, started on ahead with the horses, the
other remaining with Gregory to follow more slowly. Brown had to
abandon nearly everything to get the wretched animals on, finally
reaching the camp with only one; but fortunately he found the party
still there. He started back at once, with fresh horses, to meet
the others, and recover the equipment; but two of the horses were
never found.</p>

<p>Gregory was now convinced that the sandy tract before him was
not to be crossed with the means at his command, so that,
reluctantly, he had to give way and turn to the northward, to
follow down the Oakover. They found the country fertile, and the
river abounding with water; and on the 18th September reached the
junction of De Grey with the Oakover. Down the united streams,
henceforth bearing the name of the De Grey only, the explorers
travelled through fair, open land, the course of the river flowing
now to the westward, until the coast was reached on the 25th.</p>

<p>From here the party made back to their rendezvous at Nickol Bay,
crossing once more the Yule and the Sherlock, rivers named on their
outward journey. On the 17th October the ship was reached, and they
were taken on board.</p>

<p>Gregory had thus done good service to the colony during his last
two expeditions. The stigma of desolation was at any rate partially
removed, and it was with hopeful hearts that the colonists looked
forward to the future of the valleys of the Gascoyne, the
Ashburton, and the De Grey.</p>

<p>Another party, with less success, had been exploring to the
eastward of the settled districts, in the southern part of the
colony, and as it will be some time before we shall revisit Western
Australia, it will be most convenient to now follow out the
fortunes of the little body of colonists with the large
territory.</p>

<p>In 1861, whilst Gregory was opening up his new country, Messrs.
Dempster, Clarkson, and Harper started from Northam to make one
more trial to the east to get through the dense scrubs and the
salt-lake country into a more promising region. It was purely a
private expedition; one of those that have done so much of the work
of discovery in Australia; each member of the party found his own
horses and equipment.</p>

<p>They left on the 3rd July, and for many days met with nothing
but the usual alternations of scrub and sandy plains dotted with
granite hills. On the 19th, we find in their diary the first
mention of the legend amongst the blacks of white men having been
murdered on a large lake to the eastward. Their informant was a
native who was with them for some time as a guide, and his
authority was a great traveller of the name of Boodgin, who must
have revelled in the possession of a singularly fertile
imagination. The account of Boodgin was to the effect that three
white men with horses had many years ago come to a large lake of
salt water, a long way to the eastward, and after travelling along
the shore for some time, they turned back, and were either killed
by the <i>jimbras</i>, or perished from want of water. Thus ran Mr.
Boodgin's story, which we shall immediately have to refer to.</p>

<p>Still endeavouring to reach to the east by various detours, on
the 24th they came to the largest hill they had yet
seen&mdash;Mount Kennedy&mdash;and at the end of the month found
themselves still in the lake district. For sixty miles they had
traced the lakes, and from the hills could see a continuation of
the low range they were on. On one of them (Lake Grace) they had
speech with a few natives, who repeated what they had formerly
heard, as to the death of three white men, far away at some
interior lake or inland sea. They were also acquainted with the
before-mentioned Boodgin, who, unfortunately, had in some way
offended them; so he was not present, the others having announced
an intention of spearing him on the first opportunity. These men
gave an account of the <i>jimbra</i>, or <i>jingra</i>, a strange
animal, male and female, which they described as resembling a
monkey, very fierce, and would attack men when it caught one
singly. Thinking there might be a confusion of names, the explorers
asked if the <i>jimbra</i>, or <i>jingra</i>, was the same as the
<i>ginka</i>&mdash;the native name for devil. This, however, was
not so, as the natives asserted that the devil, or <i>ginka</i>,
was never seen, but that the <i>jimbra</i> was both seen and
felt.</p>

<p>From this point the party returned homeward, having, at any
rate, demonstrated the fact that the thickets to the eastward were
not impenetrable, and that no insurmountable obstacles existed to
further progress.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the origin of the native tradition about
the deaths of three white men, which Forrest afterwards
investigated, it must seem strange that the natives should in the
<i>jimbra</i> have described an animal (the ape) they could not
possibly have ever seen. It may be mentioned here that reports
about the bones of cattle having been found on the outskirts of
Western Australia had been circulated in the Eastern colonies
before Leichhardt left.</p>

<p>We are now about to turn a page in the history of Australia
which, however marked by misfortune and disappointment, still
embodies some of the most fruitful achievements in the history of
discovery. The unfortunate result of one expedition led to so many
minor ones, that an immense area of new country was thrown open in
a very short time.</p>

<p>An extraordinary craze had seized on the imaginations of the
southern colonies to send out expeditions to strive to be the first
to cross the continent from the southern shore to the northern one.
The South Australian Government had for a time a standing reward of
£10,000 offered for the man who should accomplish this gigantic
task with private means.</p>

<p>M'Dowall Stuart has been recognised as the one to whom most
honour is due for successfully spanning the gap, and there are many
reasons for awarding the chief praise to him. He was the first to
attempt the feat, and although he was not the first to reach salt
water on the north, he was the first to sight the open sea, and
actually cross from sea to sea. Nor in so doing was he aided by the
former successes of other explorers. He also was the one who
crossed fairly in the centre of Australia, and his track extends
further north, as the others made for the southern shore of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, while Stuart came out at the head of Arnhem's
Land.</p>

<p>Burke and Wills were, according to the journal of Wills, at the
northern coast in February, 1861, so they could claim the honour of
first crossing; next came M'Kinlay, in May, 1862. Landsborough
reached the Darling from the north in June of the same year, and
then Stuart on the north coast comes but a few weeks afterwards in
July. On Stuart's track however, has been built the overland
telegraph line, an enduring monument to his indomitable
perseverance. His was but a small party when he started to reach
the spot so ardently longed for by his former leader Sturt. Less
than a handful of men, three in all, with thirteen horses, left on
this eventful trip, a strange company to contrast with the princely
cavalcade that a few months later was to leave Melbourne on a like
journey.</p>

<p>The starting point was from Chambers' Creek, but naturally from
here their course for a time was over much-trodden ground.</p>

<p>At Beresford Springs there were unmistakable traces of recent
native warfare. Lying on his back was the corpse of a tall native,
the skull broken, and both feet and hands missing. Near the place
was a handful of human hair, and some emu feathers, placed between
two charred pieces of wood, as a sign or token of some sort, but
nothing to be interpreted by the whites as to the meaning of this
strange neglect of burial rites, so unusual amongst the
aborigines.</p>

<p>After passing the Neale, the little band commenced their march
into the unknown. Their journey was, for the most part, through
good pastoral country, crossing numerous well-watered creeks, which
they named, respectively, the Frew, the Fincke, and the Stevenson,
and on the 6th they reached a remarkable hill, which they had
observed for some time. It proved to be a pillar of sandstone on a
hill about one hundred feet high. The pillar itself, in addition,
is one hundred and fifty feet in height, and twenty feet in width.
Stuart christened it Chambers' Pillar. This freak of nature was
surrounded by numerous other remarkable bills, resembling ruined
castles.</p>

<p>Passing through a range, which was called the Waterhouse Range,
and again striking a creek, christened the Hugh, they made for one
of two remarkable bluffs, first sighted on the 9th of April, and
reached the range of which these two bluff cliffs formed the centre
on the 12th. This was the highest range Stuart had yet found, and
he named it MacDonnell Range, after the then Governor of South
Australia; the east bluff was called Brinkley Bluff and the west
one Hanson Bluff. Crossing this range, which, although rough, was
very well-grassed, the party got among spinifex and scrub, and,
after being two nights without water, made for a high peak in the
distance (Mount Freeling), where they found a small supply.</p>

<p>It was evident that they had now reached the limit of the
rainfall, and were trespassing on dry country.</p>

<p>A search for permanent water was made before going on, and a
large reservoir found in a ledge of rocks, that promised to supply
their wants on their return.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of April, Stuart camped in the centre of Australia,
and one of his hopes was accomplished; about two miles and a-half
to the N.N.E. was a tolerable high mount, which he called Central
Mount Stuart. The next morning, with his tried companion, Kekwick,
he climbed this mount, and on the top erected a cairn of stones,
and hoisted the Union Jack. What must have been his thoughts at
having, with such a feeble party, so comparatively easily
accomplished what others had striven in vain for? Surely he must
have thought with regret that his old leader, dauntless Sturt, was
not standing beside him.</p>

<p>The first night after leaving Mount Stuart, they camped without
water, and the next day found a permanent supply under a high peak,
which he called Mount Leichhardt; and while mentioning this fact,
he notices that he has found no trace of that explorer having ever
passed to the westward.</p>

<p>On the first of May they came to a small gum creek, which Stuart
called the Fisher, and in which the only water they could get was
in a native well. Crossing this creek they got into a dead level
country, covered with spinifex and stunted gum trees. Here they
came across the track of a blackfellow which differed considerably
from the ordinary mark made by the foot of a native:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The spinifex in many places has been burnt, and the
track of the native was peculiar-not broad and flat as they
generally are, but long and narrow, with a deep hollow in the foot,
and the large toe projecting a good deal; in some respects more
like the print of a white man than a native. Had I crossed it the
day before, I would have followed it. My horses are now suffering
too much from the want of water to allow me to do so. If I did, and
we were not to find water to-night, I should lose the whole of the
horses and our lives into the bargain."</blockquote>

<p>As it was, they had a hard struggle to get back to the native
well at the Fisher.</p>

<p>After a week's interval Stuart tried again to the' east of
north, but found things no better; mulga scrub and spinifex again
surrounded them, and after travelling twenty-seven miles they had
to camp without water. The next day was the same, Stuart getting a
nasty fall, being pulled off by some scrub and dragged for a short
distance. There was nothing for it but to retreat once more. Scurvy
had now laid its hand upon the leader, and he began to suffer
severely.</p>

<p>After much trouble and delay, Stuart, by working to the
eastward, at last got forward again, and on the 1st of June found a
large creek, the best he had yet seen, which he called the Bonney,
and on the second of the month reached the range christened by him
the Murchison Range. On the 6th he came to a gum creek, which he
called Tennant's Creek, destined to be the site of one of the
telegraph stations of the overland line. He now made an effort to
the west of north to reach the head waters of the Victoria, and got
into a dry strip of country that nearly put an end to the
expedition. When they at last, with some losses, got the horses
back to water, the animals had travelled one hundred and twelve
miles, and been one hundred and one hours without a drink. Some of
them had gone mad. "Thus," says Stuart, "ends my last attempt, at
present, to make the Victoria River. Three times I have tried it,
and been forced to retreat."</p>

<p>After many days' rest, he started again, this time to the
eastward of north, and in ten miles came to a well-watered creek,
which he named Phillips' Creek. Once more he had another two or
three days of useless efforts to force his way through a dry belt,
vainly flattering himself that he was approaching the watershed of
the Gulf; but had to fall back on the Phillips again. Whilst
camping here some natives visited them, two of them wearing a kind
of helmet made of net work and feathers, tightly bound
together:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"One was an old man, and seemed to be the father of
these two fine young men. He was very talkative, but I could make
nothing of him. I have endeavoured, by signs, to get information
from him as to where the next water is, but we cannot understand
each other. After some time, and having conferred with his two
sons, he turned round, and surprised me by giving me one of the
Masonic signs. I looked at him steadily; he repeated it; and so did
his two sons. I then returned it, which seemed to please them much,
the old man patting me on the shoulder and stroking down my
beard."</blockquote>

<p>Whether Stuart's imagination here led him astray, it is
impossible to say, but very shortly afterwards they encountered a
tribe who displayed anything but the friendly feelings that should
have been shown by brother masons.</p>

<p>On the next start they came in fourteen miles to a large gum
creek, with very fair-sized sheets of water in it, and as they
followed it down they passed the encampment of some natives, but
did not take any notice of them, keeping steadily on their course.
Finding no water lower down the creek, they had to return. When
close to the place where they crossed the creek in the morning, and
the evening rapidly closing in, they were suddenly surrounded by a
number of well-armed natives, who started out of a scrub they were
passing through. All signs of friendship, masonic or otherwise,
were thrown away on them, and at last, after receiving two or three
showers of boomerangs and waddies they had to turn and fire on
them. So bold and determined were they in their attack upon the
three men, that Stuart had to return to his camp of the night
before still followed by them. Here he had to make up his mind to
abandon his further progress for the present. He had too small a
party to stand a pitched battle with the aboriginal proprietors;
the water behind them was failing, and they had suffered
considerable loss in their horses. Most wisely Stuart determined to
return.</p>

<p>On the 27th June he commenced his retreat. On reaching the
Bonney he halted for a few days, during which time the cloudy
aspect of the sky made him entertain the idea of another effort to
reach the Victoria River; but no rain fell, and he had to keep on
his way. On the 26th of August the party arrived at Mr. Brodie's
camp at Hamilton Springs, all of them very weak and reduced.</p>

<p>After the result of Stuart's expedition had been reported in
Adelaide, and it was seen how inadequate means alone had led to the
retreat of the explorer, the Government voted £2,500 to equip a
larger and better-organized party, of which he was to take command.
Meanwhile, such a report of the results of the journey as the
Government thought might prove useful to the leaders of the
Victorian expedition, then on the march, was forwarded, but, as
will be seen, shared the same chapter of accidents that beset that
unfortunate expedition, and never reached them.</p>

<p>This time Stuart's party numbered at the final start, ten men
and forty-seven horses; and by the end of January, 1861, they were
fairly on their way outside the settled districts, and here we must
leave them to turn to that other expedition, the issue of which
attracted so much attention throughout the world.</p>

<p>Public opinion is notably fickle, and never more so than when
dealing with the memories of distinguished men. No guide, no
standard is followed in the matter; the recognition of their
services is made solely a matter of sentiment.</p>

<p>Poor Kennedy, who, confronted with almost insurmountable
difficulties, harassed by hostile natives, and ill-provisioned at
the start, lost his life, and the majority of his party, in a
gallant effort to fulfil his task, is almost forgotten, save by the
few who take an interest in the history of our country. Whilst
Burke&mdash;who left the settlements, equipped with everything that
a generous people could provide, and that the experience of others
could suggest, to make the journey safe and ensure its
success&mdash;travelled through a country that is now a vast sheep
and cattle walk; and frittered away his magnificent resources,
wantonly sacrificing his own life and those of his men, is elevated
into a hero. It may truly be said that for the fate of the two
leaders, the mistakes of others must be greatly held accountable;
but at the same time it must be also kept strongly in view that,
for the want of judgment that placed Burke in such a position that
the mistake of a subordinate could entail such fatal results, he
alone was responsible.</p>

<p>The action of Victoria in sending out the expedition of
discovery under Burke and Wills, was, without doubt, exceptional in
the annals of exploration; it was an instance of a public body
emulating the generous act of a private individual. The colony
itself had no territory left to explore. Her rich and compact
little province was known from end to end, and it was not with her,
as with others, a case of necessity to send her sons into the
wilderness, to open fresh fields for emigration.</p>

<p>Whatever then was the upshot of the expedition, and whatever the
guilty mismanagement attaching to its progress, the colony must
ever look back with pride upon the noble and unselfish motives that
prompted its inauguration.</p>

<p>Without counting the cost of the relief parties, seven lives
were laid down, and over £12,000 expended, and it was all
cheerfully rendered; and Victoria, in her one expedition, had the
satisfaction of knowing that her representatives carried off the
coveted prize, and were the first to cross the continent from south
to north.</p>

<p>The money for the expenses was subscribed as follows:&mdash;
£6,000 voted by Government, £1,000 subscribed by Mr. Ambrose Kyte,
and the balance of the £12,000 made up by public subscription.</p>

<p>The outfit was on a most lavish scale; camels were imported from
Peshawar, with native drivers; provisions and stores for twelve
months provided, and no expense spared to render the whole
appointments the most complete ever provided for an exploring
expedition. When the party was organised, it consisted of the
leader, R. O'Hara Burke; second in command, G. J. Landells, who had
brought the camels from India; third, W. J. Wills, astronomical and
meteorological observer., Dr. Hermann Beckler, medical officer and
botanist; Dr. Ludwig Becker, artist, naturalist, and geologist; ten
white men, and three camel drivers.</p>

<p>It was a gala day when they left Melbourne, and their progress
through the settled districts was a triumphant march; it almost
seemed that Fate was playing with them in very mockery, smiling at
the thought of the return.</p>

<p>The choice of the leader has always been a puzzle to most men,
and it can only be accounted for in two ways. First, that the
committee of management did not wish (as was only natural) to go
outside of the colony for a man, and the tried and experienced
explorers were all residents in other colonies; secondly, that the
committee was, with two notable exceptions, composed of men quite
unable to judge of the qualities essential in a leader; for the man
of their choice, the unfortunate Burke, was most singularly
unfitted for the position.</p>

<p>Burke was an Irishman, from the county of Galway. He had been in
the Austrian service, and also in the Irish mounted constabulary.
At the time when he applied for the post, which unhappily was
awarded to him, he was an inspector of mounted police at
Castlemaine. His appointment as leader was strongly supported by
the chairman of the committee, Sir William Stawell, and it appears
to have been backed up by those kind of general testimonials as to
ability which recommend a man almost equally for any grade or
position. Of special aptitude or scientific training he possessed
no pretension, and his selection was a fatal blunder. In saying
this, there is no reflection on the private character of the
mistaken leader; he paid for the wrong estimation he held of his
own fitness with his life, and the fault rests with those who
placed him in a position where he also was responsible for the
lives of others. After passing in review the different expeditions
that have added so much lustre to our history, and striving to
judge dispassionately of the characters of the men who, with good
and evil fortune, have commanded them, one cannot help being struck
by the exaggerated and misplaced stress laid upon the reputation
Burke possessed for personal bravery. The calm and simple courage
of Sturt, the cool judgment and forethought of Mitchell, the
devotion of Austin, seem all to have been lost sight of by writers,
who extol Burke in a way that would lead men to believe that every
other Australian leader must have been an abject craven. This
mistaken laudation has done more to glaringly parade Burke's many
failings than more modest and judicious praise would have done.</p>

<p>Of his second, W. J. Wills (who shared the fate of his leader),
he appears to have been a man eminently possessed of most of the
qualities that would fit him for the position he held, but
apparently tempered with an amiability of disposition that led him
to give way completely to the rash judgment of his superior,
without striving to temper that rashness.</p>

<p>Before the expedition travelled outside of the settled country,
trouble appeared. First, Landells resigned in consequence of a
quarrel with the leader. On returning to Melbourne, he expressed
publicly an opinion that, under Burke's management, the expedition
would be attended by most disastrous results.</p>

<p>Wright was then appointed third in charge, and he apparently had
not the most remote idea of any of the functions entailed on him by
his position, and has since been blamed as having caused the final
catastrophe. He joined the party at Menindie, which, for the
purpose of explanation, may be said to occupy the same position on
the Darling as Laidley's Ponds, whence Sturt started for the
interior.</p>

<p>The foregoing estimate of the men holding the principal commands
is essential to enable the reader to understand how the astonishing
blunders were so constantly perpetrated, that brought the whole
campaign to such utter grief.</p>

<p>From Menindie to Cooper's Creek was the next stage, but the
country now being fairly well known, they did not follow the route
of Sturt the explorer. The main body of the party was left behind.
Burke took with him Wills, six men, five horses, and sixteen
camels, leaving the others to follow afterwards under the guidance
of Wright, who went two hundred miles with them to point out the
best route. They left Menindie on the 19th of October, 1860. On the
11th of November they arrived at Cooper's Creek, and here they
camped, waiting for the arrival of Wright with the main body, and
making short excursions to the northward. Grass and water were both
plentiful, and up to their arrival at Cooper's Creek the journey
had not been so arduous as an ordinary overlanding trip with
cattle.</p>

<p>Wright's non-arrival, and the delay caused thereby, seemed to
have worked upon Burke's impatient temper, and the extraordinary
notion came into his head to divide his party of eight, and with
three men to start across the continent to the Gulf of Carpentaria,
leaving the others in charge of Brahe, to await his return, and
also Wright's long-delayed arrival. On the 16th December, 1860,
Burke, having with him Wills, King, and Gray, six camels, two
horses, and three months' provisions, started on this tramp, which
for perverse absurdity stands unequalled. The first duty of a man
entrusted with such a large party, was to have carried out its
chief aim and mission of reporting on the geographical features and
formation of the country he was sent to explore, and bringing back
the fullest and most minute account of it, and its productions.
Burke, during the most important part of his journey, left behind
him his botanist, naturalist, and geologist, and started without
even the means at his disposal of following up any discoveries he
might make. His sole thought evidently was to cross to Carpentaria
and back, and be able to say that he had done so&mdash;a most
unworthy ambition on the part of the leader of such a party,
containing within itself all the elements of geographical research,
and one that could certainly not have been anticipated by the
promoters. After all the pains and cost expended in the
organisation of this expedition, we have now the spectacle of the
main body, including two of the scientific members, loitering on
the outskirts of the settled districts; four men killing time on
the banks of Cooper's Creek, and the leader and three others racing
headlong across the country ahead, all four of them being utterly
inexperienced men. As might be expected, the results of the journey
are most barren. Burke scarcely troubled to keep any journal at
all.</p>

<p>Wills' diary, too, is sadly uninteresting&mdash;it is but the
baldest record of the day's doings, and destitute of the
sympathetic style which is so essential in an explorer's log. From
it we find that their first point was to make Eyre's Creek, but,
before reaching it, they discovered a fine water-course coming from
the north that took them a long distance on their way, there being
abundance of both water and grass along its banks. From where this
creek turned to the eastward they kept steadily north, the rivers,
fortunately for them, keeping mostly a north and south course. They
crossed the dividing range at the head of the Cloncurry River, and
by following that river down reached the Flinders, and, finally,
the mangroves and salt water in February, 1861. At the end of his
scanty notes, Burke says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"28th March. At the conclusion of report, it would be
as well to say that we reached the sea, but we could not obtain a
view of the open ocean, although we made every endeavour to do
so."</blockquote>

<p>Wills' description of their arrival is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Finding the ground in such a state from the heavy
falls of rain that the camels could scarcely be got along, it was
decided to leave them at camp 119, and for Mr. Burke and I to
proceed towards the sea on foot, After breakfast, we accordingly
started, taking with us the horse and three days' provisions. Our
first difficulty was in crossing Billy's Creek, which we had to do
where it enters the river, a few hundred yards below the camp. In
getting the horse in here he got bogged in a quicksand so deeply as
to be unable to stir, and we only succeeded in extricating him by
undermining him on the creek side, and then lunging him into the
water. Having got all the things in safety, we continued down the
river bank, which bent about from east to west, but kept a general
north course. A great deal of the land was so soft and rotten that
the horse, with only one saddle on and twenty-five pounds on his
back, could scarcely walk over it. At a distance of about five
miles we again had him bogged, in crossing a small creek, after
which he seemed so weak that we had some doubts about getting him
on. We, however, found some better ground close to the water's
edge, where the sandstone rock runs out, and we stuck to it as far
as possible. Finding that the river was bending about so much that
we were making very little progress in a northerly direction, we
struck off due north, and soon came on some tableland, where the
soil is shallow and gravelly, and clothed with box and swamp gums.
Patches of the land were very boggy, but the main portion was sound
enough. Beyond this we came on an open plain, covered with water up
to one's ankles. The soil here was a stiff clay, and the surface
very uneven, so that between the tufts of grass one was frequently
knee-deep in water. The bottom, however, was sound, and no fear of
bogging. After floundering through this for several miles, we came
to a path formed by the blacks, and there were distinct signs of a
recent migration in a southerly direction. By making use of this
path we got on much better, for the ground was well-trodden and
hard. At rather more than a mile the path entered a forest, through
which flowed a nice watercourse, and we had not gone far before we
found places where the blacks had been camping. The forest was
intersected by little pebbly rises, on which they made their fires,
and in the sandy ground adjoining some of the former had been
digging yams, [The <i>dios-corea</i> of Carpentaria.] which seemed
to be so numerous that they could afford to leave plenty of them
behind, probably having selected only the very best. We were not so
particular, but ate many of those that they had rejected, and found
them very good. About half a mile further we came close on a
blackfellow who was coiling by a camp fire, whilst his gin and
piccaninny were yabbering alongside. We stopped for a short time to
take out some of the pistols that were on the horse, and that they
might see us before we were so near as to frighten them. just after
we stopped, the black got up to stretch his limbs, and after a few
seconds looked in our direction. It was very amusing to see the way
in which he stared, standing for some time as if he thought he must
be dreaming, and then, having signalled to the others, they dropped
on their haunches and shuffled off in the quietest manner
possible."</blockquote>

<p>It will be, however, tedious to continue the quotation, suffice
it to say that they reached a channel with tidal waters, and had to
return without actually seeing the open sea. Then comes a blank in
Wills' diary, and when he next writes they were on their way
back.</p>

<p>Having accomplished their task, but with little profit, for they
did not actually know their position on the Gulf, being strangely
out in their reckoning; mistaking the river they were on for the
Albert, over a hundred miles to the westward, the retreat
commenced. Short rations and hardship now began to tell, and during
the struggle back to the depôt there seems to have been an absence
of that kindly spirit of self sacrifice which is so distinguishing
a feature in nearly all the other expeditions whose lines have
fallen disastrously. Gray fell sick, and stole some flour to make
some gruel with; for this Burke beat him severely. Wills writes on
one occasion that they had to wait, and send back for Gray, who was
"gammoning" that he could not walk. Nine days afterwards the
unfortunate man dies&mdash;an act which at any rate is not often
successfully gammoned. But to bring the story to an end, they at
last, on the evening of the 21St of April, reached the camp on
Cooper's Creek, where they had left their four companions, and
instead of finding the whole party there to greet them, found it
lifeless and deserted.</p>

<p>Searching at the foot of a tree marked "dig" they found a small
quantity of provisions concealed, and a note from Brahe stating
that they had left only that morning. They sat down and ate a
welcome supper of porridge, and considered their position. They
could scarcely walk, and their camels were the same; they had fifty
pounds of flour, twenty pounds of rice, sixty pounds of oatmeal,
sixty pounds of sugar, and fifteen pounds of dried meat; a very
fair stock if they only had had the means of transit; if Brahe had
left three or four horses hobbled at the depôt they would have been
able to follow, but as it was they could do nothing, and all the
time Brahe was only separated from them by a very short distance,
had they but known it,</p>

<p>Burke consulted his companions as to the feasibility of their
being able to overtake Brahe, and they all agreed that in their
tired and enfeebled condition it was hopeless to attempt it; then,
according to King's narrative, Burke said that instead of returning
up the creek, their old route to Menindie, they would go down to
Mount Hopeless, in South Australia, following the line taken by A.
C. Gregory. Wills objected and so did King, but ultimately both
gave in, and this was the death warrant of two of them.</p>

<p>The following paper was placed in the depôt by Burke before
starting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Depôt No. 2, Cooper's Creek, Camp 65. The return party
from Carpentaria consisting of myself, Wills and King (Gray dead),
arrived here last night, and found that the depôt party had started
on the same day. We proceed on to-morrow slowly down the creek to
Adelaide, by Mount Hopeless, and shall endeavour to follow
Gregory's track, but we are very weak. The two camels are done up
and we shall not be able to travel faster than two or three miles a
day. Gray died on the road from exhaustion and fatigue. We have all
suffered much from hunger. The provisions left here will, I think,
restore our strength. We have discovered a practicable route to
Carpentaria, the chief portion of which lies on 140 deg. of east
longitude. There is some good country between this and the Stony
Desert. From there to the tropics the country is dry and stony.
Between the tropics and Carpentaria a considerable portion is
rangy, but it is well-watered and richly-grassed. We reached the
shores of Carpentaria on February 11th, 1861. Greatly disappointed
at finding the party here gone.<br>
<br>
"(Signed) ROBERT O'HARA BURKE.<br>
<br>
"April 22, 1861.<br>
<br>
"P.S.&mdash;The camels cannot travel, and we cannot walk or we
should follow the other party. We shall move very slowly down the
creek."</blockquote>

<p>After resting four or five days, and finding great advantage
from their change of diet, the three men started, but one of the
camels got bogged, and had to be shot as he lay in the creek, the
explorers cutting off what meat they could from the body, and
staying a couple of days to dry it in the sun. When they again
started, the one camel they had left carried most of what they had,
and they each took with them a bundle of about twenty-five pounds;
but they made no progress, all the creeks they followed to the
southward ran out into earthy plains and their one solitary beast
of burden being knocked up, they had to return.</p>

<p>Now commenced a terrible struggle for mere existence the camel
being past recovery, was shot, and the meat dried, and then the men
tried to live, after the fashion of the blacks, on fish and nardoo.
The natives were especially kind to the unfortunate men. In Wills'
diary we find frequent mention of the liberal hospitality they
extended to them, but to a great extent the novelty soon died out,
and the blacks began to find their white guests rather an
encumbrance, and soon commenced shifting their camps to avoid the
burden of their support.</p>

<p>On the 27th May, Wills started alone to the depôt to deposit the
journals, and a note stating their condition. He reached there on
the 30th, and says in his diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"No traces of anyone, except blacks, have been here
since we left. Deposited some journals and a notice of our present
condition."</blockquote>

<p>This was the notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"May 30th, 1861.<br>
<br>
"We have been unable to leave the creek. Both camels are dead.
Mr. Burke and King are down on the lower part of the creek. I am
about to return to them, when we shall probably all come up this
way. We are trying to live the best way we can, like the blacks,
but we find it hard work. Our clothes are going fast to pieces.
Send provisions and clothes as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
"(Signed) WILLIAM J. WILLS."<br>
<br>
"The depôt party having left, contrary to instructions, has put us
in this fix. I have deposited some of my journals here for fear of
accidents."</blockquote>

<p>Having done this, Wills returned to his companions, being fed by
the friendly natives on his way back. During the intercourse that
of necessity they had had with the blacks during their detention on
Cooper's Creek, they had noticed the extensive use the natives made
of the seeds of the nardoo [See Appendix.] plant as an article of
food; but for a long time they were unable to find out this plant,
nor would the blacks show it to them. At last King accidentally
found it, and, by its aid, they now managed to prolong their lives.
But the seeds had to be gathered, cleaned, pounded and cooked, and
even after all this labour (and to men in their state it was
labour) very little nourishment was derived from eating it. An
occasional crow or hawk was shot, and, by chance, a little fish
obtained from the natives, and as this was all they could get, they
were sinking rapidly. At last they decided that Burke and King
should go up the creek and endeavour to find the natives and get
food from them. Wills, who was now so weak as to be unable almost
to move, was left lying under some boughs, with an eight days'
supply of water and nardoo, the others trusting that before that
time they would have returned to him.</p>

<p>On the 26th June the two men started, and poor Wills was left to
meet his death alone. He must have retained his consciousness
almost to the last. So exhausted was he, that death must have been
only like a release from the trouble of living. His last entries,
though giving evidences of fading faculties, are almost cheerful.
He jocularly alludes to himself as Micawber, waiting for something
to turn up. It is evident that he had given up hope, and waited for
death's approach in a calm and resigned frame of mind, without
fear, like a good and gallant man.</p>

<p>King and Burke did not go far; on the second day Burke had to
give in from sheer weakness, and the next morning when his
companion looked at him, he saw by the breaking light that his
leader was dead.</p>

<p>This was the sad and bitter end of the high-spirited captain of
this luckless expedition; an almost solitary death on the wide
western plain, after enduring weeks of hunger and starvation. What
must have been King's feelings at finding himself thus left without
a companion to cheer his last hours when his turn, as he then
thought, must inevitably soon come?</p>

<p>After wandering in search of the natives, and not finding them,
the solitary man returned to Wills, who was also dead, and all he
could do was to cover the body up with a little sand, without any
hope that the same would be done by him.</p>

<p>Burke's last notes in his pocket book are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I hope we shall be done justice to. We have fulfilled
our task, but we have been aban&mdash;&mdash;. We have not been
followed up as we expected, and the depôt party abandoned their
post."</blockquote>

<p>He winds up:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"King has behaved nobly. He has stayed with me to the
last, and placed the pistol in my hand, leaving me lying on the
surface as I wished."</blockquote>

<p>Left to himself, King, after a few days, made another effort to
find the natives, and this time succeeded, living with their
assistance until rescued by Howitt's relief party on September
15th, having for nearly three months subsisted on the hospitality
of the natives.</p>

<p>Meanwhile that these unfortunate men were slowly starving to
death on Cooper's Creek, parties were soon to be dispatched from
north, south and east in quest of them.</p>

<p>Left at the depôt on Cooper's Creek, Brahe remained from the
14th of December, 1860, until the 21st of April, 1861. Then he
left, his instructions, according to his own account, being
(verbally) to remain at the depôt three months, or longer, if
provisions and other circumstances would permit. Before leaving he
buried, as before stated, a small supply of provisions and a note,
which in full ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Depôt, Cooper's Creek, April 21, 1861. The depôt party
of V.E.E. leaves this camp to-day to return to the Darling. I
intend to go S.E. from camp 60 to get on to our old track at
Bulloo. Two of my companions and myself are quite well; the
third&mdash;Patton-has been unable to walk for the last eighteen
days, as his leg has been severely hurt when thrown by one of the
horses. No person has been up here from the Darling. We have six
camels and twelve horses, in good working condition.<br>
<br>
"WILLIAM BRAHE."</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately this was worded in such a way as to leave Burke,
who got it that night, under the impression that they were all,
with one exception, fairly well, and would probably make long
stages, whereas, on the evening of the day that Burke returned,
they were camped but fourteen miles away.</p>

<p>Wright, meantime, with the main body of the party had been
camping and wandering between the Darling and Bulloo; his men
sickened and died of scurvy, and he consumed his rations, and
reduced the condition of his stock to no purpose. On Brahe's return
he made an extraordinary display of energy, and returned with him
to the depôt on Cooper's Creek, at which place they arrived on the
8th of May, whilst Burke and Wills were making their futile attempt
to reach Mount Hopeless. Wright and Brahe came to the conclusion
that no one had visited the caché since Brahe's departure, although
the fact seems almost incredible. Brahe states, however:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. Burke's return being so soon after my departure
caused the tracks of his camels to correspond in the character of
age exactly with our own tracks. The remains of three separate
fires led us to suppose that blacks had been camped there. The
fires had burned to mere ashes, and left no perceptible evidence
from the position of the sticks as to whether they were black men's
fires or not. The ground above the caché was so perfectly restored
to the appearance it presented when I left it, that in the absence
of any fresh sign or mark of any description to be seen near, it
was impossible to suppose that it had been disturbed."</blockquote>

<p>Wright and Brahe rode away again, and when Wills afterwards
visited the depôt to bury the journals, he says that he could not
perceive any sign of it having been visited; a series of singular
and fatal oversights that almost seem to have been
pre-ordained.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, Wright reached the Darling and sent in his
dispatches. As may be imagined they occasioned great consternation,
and no time was lost in instituting search parties to scour half
the continent for the missing men. Fortunately a light party, under
Mr. A. W. Howitt, had already been equipped, to follow on Burke's
tracks, for the long absence and silence of Wright had already
caused people to feel anxious. Howitt's party was doubled and he
made all speed to Cooper's Creek. Meantime the other colonies took
the matter up and three more parties were in the field. Howitt,
whose fortunes we must follow, started early in July; the
<i>Victoria</i>, steam sloop, was sent up to the mouth of the
Albert River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, from Brisbane, having Mr.
W. Landsborough on board. Another Queensland expedition, under Mr.
Walker, left the furthest out station, in the Rockhampton district,
to proceed overland to the Gulf, and from South Australia, started
M'Kinlay.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September Howitt, having with him Brahe, reached
Cooper's Creek, and on the 13th arrived at the fatal depôt, but
like all the others, he says that he could not see any sign of the
caché having been touched; nor did he stop to examine it. On the
15th, while trying to follow Burke's outward track down the creek,
Howitt says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"I crossed at a neck of sand, and again came on the
track of a camel going up the creek; at the same time I found a
native, who began to gesticulate in a very excited manner, and to
point down the creek, bawling out, 'Gow! gow!' as loud as he could.
When I went towards him he ran away, and finding it impossible to
get him to come to me, I turned back to follow the camel track, and
to look after my party, as I had not seen anything of them for some
miles. The track was visible in sandy places, and was evidently the
same I had seen for the last two days. I also found horse tracks in
places, but very old. Crossing the creek I cut our track, and rode
after the party. In doing so I came upon three pounds of tobacco,
which had lain where I saw it for some time. This, together with
the knife-handle, the fresh horse tracks, and the camel track going
eastward, puzzled me extremely, and led me into a hundred
conjectures. At the lower end of the large reach of water before
mentioned, I met Sandy and Frank looking for me, with the
intelligence that King, the only survivor of Mr. Burke's party, had
been found. [See Appendix.] A little further on I found the party
halted, and immediately went across to the black's wurleys, where I
found King sitting in a hut that the blacks had made for him. He
presented a melancholy appearance-wasted to a shadow, and hardly to
be distinguished as a civilised being, except by the remnants of
clothes on him."</blockquote>

<p>So soon as King had recovered sufficient strength to accompany
the party they went to the place where Wills had died, and found
his body in the gunyah as King had described it, there it was
buried. On the 21st, Burke's body was found up the creek, he too
was buried where he died.</p>

<p>Howitt then, after rewarding the blacks who had cared for King,
started home again by easy stages taking the rescued man with him.
On his return to Melbourne, Howitt was sent back to disinter the
remains of the explorers, and bring them down to Melbourne, which
task he safely accomplished. A public funeral then took place, and
subsequently a statue was erected to their memory.</p>

<p>Dr. Beckler, and Messrs. Stone, Purcell, and Patton were the
others whose lives were sacrificed on this unfortunate trip, the
first three were members of Wright's party, the last one was with
Brahe at the depôt.</p>

<p>Before ending the narration of this journey of Burke and Wills,
it will be remembered, that an account of Stuart's expedition to
Central Mount Stuart, and Attack Creek was forwarded to the leader;
these papers were entrusted to Trooper Lyons to take from Swan Hill
to Wright's camp. Wright ordered him on to follow the tracks of
Burke, who he supposed was about two hundred miles away; he was
accompanied by the saddler of the party, McPherson, and a black
boy, Dick. They followed Burke's tracks for some days but never
reached him, their horses gave in, and they being insufficiently
provided with provisions nearly perished, finally they were picked
up by a relief party under Doctor Beckler.</p>

<p>The nardoo which served to prolong the life of Burke and Wills
for a considerable time is a small ground plant resembling clover
in the shape of its leaves. These leaves are covered with silvery
down, and the seeds, too, have this down on them. When fresh the
seeds are flat and oval. The nardoo grows in loose soil, subject to
inundation, generally on polygonum flats.</p>

<p>Whilst this tragedy had been enacted, Stuart was endeavouring to
force his way across Australia, and at the time his fellow
explorers were slowly starving to death on Cooper's Creek, he was
making gallant efforts to cross the dry tableland that separated
him from the heads of the coast rivers.</p>

<p>Stuart followed his old track by the way of the Fincke and the
Hugh, and on the 12th April arrived at their former acquaintance,
the Bonney, which they found running strong, with abundant green
feed on its banks. They followed it down until it spread out and
was lost in a large plain; so striking north, the party on the 21st
April reached Tennant's Creek, and four days after, they came to
the scene of their skirmish with the natives, on Attack Creek. This
time, although the tracks of natives were numerous, they were
permitted to pass peacefully onwards. Still pushing to the north,
along the base of the line of broken range, that in that locality
runs north and south, Stuart found and named many creeks, all of
them heading from the range and forming for a considerable space
good defined channels, but becoming lost on entering the low
country. At last, on the 4th of May, he came to the end of the
range, which he there called the Ashburton Range. Here he made
several attempts to the north-west, but could discover neither
water nor watercourses in that direction; nothing but flooded
plains, beautifully grassed, but heavy and rotten to ride over;
beyond this, the country changed for the worse, becoming sandy and
scrubby.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May, he first encountered a new kind of scrub,
which is now known as Stuart's hedgewood. It spreads out in many
branches from the root upwards, interlacing with its neighbours on
either side, forming an impervious hedge. On the 23rd, he found the
magnificent sheet of water, which he called Newcastle Waters, and
which at first seemed to promise him good assistance in getting to
the north, but it proved delusive. Beyond the Newcastle he could
not advance his party at all; north, north-cast, and north-west, it
was all the same endless grassy plains, terminating in thick
scrubby forest, until at last he had again to give up hope, and
return to Adelaide.</p>

<p>Such, however, was the confidence of the authorities in him, and
such his own energy, that in less than a month he was on his way to
Chambers' Creek, to make preparations for a fresh start. His last
journey had proved the existence of a long line of good country,
fairly well-watered, and although beyond it he had not been able to
proceed, still, there was no knowing what a fresh trial might bring
forth. He had, at any rate, brought back his party in safety, with
the loss of only a few horses; and in no way deterred by the fate
of the Victorian explorers, he started once more, this time
destined to meet with success.</p>

<p>On leaving the settled districts, Stuart followed his old track,
now so familiar to him, until on the 14th April, 1862, we find him
encamped at the upper end of Newcastle Waters, once more about to
try to force a passage through the forest of scrub to the north. On
the second day he was partly successful, finding an isolated
waterhole, surrounded by conglomerate rock. This he called Frew's
Pond, and it is now a well-known camping place on the overland
telegraph line.</p>

<p>Past this spot he was not able to make any progress; twice he
tried hard to reach some tributary of the Victoria River, but
failed, and had to spend many long days in fruitlessly riding
through dense mulga and hedgewood scrub. At length, after much hope
deferred, and finding a few scanty waterholes that did not serve
his purpose, he succeeded in striking the head of a chain of ponds
running to the north. These being followed down, led him to the
head of the creek, called Daly Waters Creek, and finally to the
large waterhole bearing that name, where the telegraph station now
stands.</p>

<p>Beyond this point the creek was lost in a swamp, and Stuart was
unable to find the channel where it re-formed, now known as the
Birdum. Missing this watercourse, Stuart worked his way to the
eastward, to a creek he called the Strangways, which led him down
to the Roper River. This river he crossed, and followed up a
northern tributary named by him the Chambers, a name he was so fond
of conferring out of gratitude to his constant friend, John
Chambers.</p>

<p>His troubles regarding water were now over, but his horses began
to fall lame, and he had to carefully husband his stock of spare
shoes to carry him back to Adelaide. From the Chambers he came to
the Katherine, the lower course of the Flying Fox Creek of
Leichhardt, called by Stuart as above, the name it now bears.
Thence he struck across the tableland, and descended to the head
waters of the river he christened the Adelaide, although at first
he thought that he was on the Alligator River. Following the
Adelaide, he soon found himself travelling amongst rich tropical
scenery, that told him he was at last approaching the coast.</p>

<p>On the 24th July, he went to the north-east, intending to make
the sea shore and travel along the beach to the mouth of the
Adelaide River. He only told two of the party of the eventful
moment awaiting them. As they rode on, Thring, who was ahead,
called out, "The sea!" which so took the majority by surprise, that
they were some time before they understood what was meant, and then
three hearty cheers burst forth.</p>

<p>At this, his first point of contact, Stuart dipped his hands and
feet in the sea, and the initials J.M.D.S. were cut on the largest
tree they could find. He then attempted to make the mouth of the
Adelaide, but found the route too boggy for the horses, and not
seeing the utility of fatiguing them for nothing, had a space
cleared where they were, and a tall sapling stripped of its boughs
for a flagstaff; on this he hoisted the Union Jack he had carried
with him. A memorial of the visit was then buried at the foot of
the impromptu staff. It was an air-tight tin case containing the
following paper:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"South Australian Great Northern Exploring
Expedition.&mdash;The exploring party, under the command of John
M'Dowall Stuart, arrived at this spot on the 25th day of July,
1862, having crossed the entire continent of Australia, from the
Southern to the Indian Ocean, passing through the centre. They left
the city of Adelaide on the 26th day of October, 1861, and the most
northern station of the colony on the 21st day of January, 1862. To
commemorate this happy event., they have raised this flag bearing
his name. All well. God save the Queen."</blockquote>

<p>Stuart and the party signed their names to this document. The
tree has since been found and recognised, but this memorial has not
been discovered.</p>

<p>More fortunate than the other travellers who reached the Gulf
shore, Stuart was able to survey the open sea, instead of having to
be content with the sight of some mangrove trees and salt
water.</p>

<p>Next day Stuart started on his return. His health was failing,
and his horses were sadly weakened. After leaving the Newcastle,
the water in the many short creeks coming from the range was found
to be at the last gasp; in some there was none, in others but a
scanty supply. The horses commenced to give in rapidly, and one
after another they were left on successive dry stages. Stuart, too,
began to think that he would never live to reach the settled
districts. Scurvy had brought him down to a terrible state, and
after all his success, he scarcely hoped to profit by it. His right
hand was nearly useless to him, and after sunset he was blind. He
could not stand the pain caused by riding, and a stretcher had to
be made to carry him on. Slowly and painfully they crept along
until the first station, Mount Margaret, was reached, and here the
leader, who was only a skeleton, was able to get a little relief,
and finally recovered sufficiently to ride to Adelaide.</p>

<p>This was the last exploration conducted by Stuart. He was
rewarded by the Government of the colony he had served so well, and
went to reside in England, where he died. He never recovered from
the great suffering of his return journey.</p>

<p>At a re-union of returned Australians, held at Glasgow shortly
before his death, he had to speak, and it was evident to all that
he had quite broken down. He said that "his eyesight and his memory
were so far gone that he was unable to compose a speech, or,
indeed, to recollect many of the incidents that happened throughout
the course of his explorations." This was the sad ending of one of
our greatest explorers. Eight full years of his life had been spent
in exploring Australia, and neither his means nor resources had
ever been great&mdash;in fact, on some occasions they had been
dangerously small&mdash;but he always brought his party back in
safety, through every difficulty.</p>

<p>In following up Stuart's last expedition, we have lost sight for
a time of the three parties sent out after Burke and Wills, which,
although they were unsuccessful in their first aim, yet did
sterling service in the field of discovery.</p>

<p>John M'Kinlay started from Adelaide-the scene of so many
departures on similar errands&mdash;on October 26th, 1861. On
arriving at Blanche Water, he was informed that a report was
current amongst the natives that some white men and camels had been
seen at a distant inland water, but knowing the little reliance to
be placed on such statements, he did not at the time pay much
attention to it. On the 27th of September, he crossed Lake
Torrens&mdash;a feat which would have excited great interest a few
years ago&mdash;and made for Lake Pando, or Lake Hope, as it is
better known. From here he went north, crossing the country so
often described, wherein Cooper's Creek is lost in many
watercourses. He now got more definite details about the whites
that he had formerly heard of, and pressed forward to the place
indicated by the natives, and on the 18th October, formed a depôt
camp for his main party, and started ahead in company with two
white men and a native.</p>

<p>Passing through a country full of small shallow lakes, of all of
which M'Kinlay has faithfully preserved the terrible native names,
such as Lake Moolion&mdash;dhurunnie, etc., they came to a
watercourse, whereon they found a grave and picked up a battered
pint pot. Next morning they opened the grave, and in it was the
body of a European, the skull being marked, so M'Kinlay says, with
two sabre cuts. He noted down the description of the body, and,
from the locality and surroundings, it has been pronounced to have
been the body of Gray, who died before reaching Cooper's Creek.</p>

<p>If the reader will remember what was the result of the
circumstantial accounts of Leichhardt's murder retailed to Hely by
the natives, he will not be astonished at what follows.</p>

<p>The native that M'Kinlay had with him thus described the manner
of the white man's death, which, of course, was all pure fiction.
First, that the whites were attacked in camp by the natives, who
murdered the whole party, finishing up by eating the bodies of the
other men. Next, that the journals, saddles, etc., were buried at a
fake a short distance away. Naturally, under the circumstances,
M'Kinlay believed this story; particularly as further search
revealed another grave (empty) and other small evidences of the
presence of whites.</p>

<p>Next morning a tribe of blacks appeared, and although they
immediately ran away, one was captured, who corroborated the story
told by M'Kinlay's native. The prisoner had marks both of ball and
shot wounds on him; he stated that there was a pistol concealed
near a neighbouring lake, and he was sent to fetch it; but instead,
he appeared the following morning at the head of a host of others,
well armed, and bent on mischief. The leader was obliged to order
his men to fire on them, and it was only after several discharges
that they ran away.</p>

<p>M'Kinlay was now quite satisfied that he had found all that
remained of the Victorian expedition; and after burying a letter
for the information of any after comers, they left Lake Massacre,
as he called it, and returned to his depôt camp. The letter hidden
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"S.A.B.R. Expedition,<br>
"October 23rd, 1861.<br>
<br>
"To the leader of any expedition seeking tidings of Burke and
party:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Sir,&mdash;I reached this water on the 19th instant, and by means
of a native guide discovered a European camp, one mile north on
west side of flat. At, or near this camp, traces of horses, camels,
and whites were found. Hair, apparently belonging to Mr. Wills,
Charles Gray, Yr. Burke, or King, was picked from the surface of a
grave dug by a spade, and from the skull of a European buried by
the natives. Other less important traces-such as a pannikin, oil
can, saddle stuffing, &amp;c., have been found. Beware of the
natives, on whom we have had to fire. We do not intend to return to
Adelaide, but proceed to west of north. From information, all
Burke's party were killed and eaten.<br>
<br>
"JNO. M'KINLAY.<br>
<br>
"[P.S.&mdash;All the party in good health.]<br>
<br>
"If you had any difficulty in reaching this spot, and wish to
return to Adelaide by a more practicable route, you may do so for
at least three months to come, by driving west eighteen miles, then
south of west, cutting our dray track within thirty miles.
Abundance of water and feed at easy stages."</blockquote>

<p>M'Kinlay next sent Mr. Hodgkinson with men and packhorses to
Blanche Water, to take down the news of his discovery, and to bring
back rations for a prolonged exploration. Meantime he remained in
camp. From one old native, with whom he had a long conversation, he
obtained another version of the supposed massacre, which evidently
had a certain admixture of truth.</p>

<p>This was to the effect that the whites repulsed an attack of the
natives on their return journey; that in the affair, one white man
was killed; he was buried after the fight, and the others went
south. The natives then dug up the body and ate the flesh. The
blackfellow then described minutely the different waters passed by
Burke, and the way the men lived on the seeds of the nardoo plant,
which he must have heard of from other natives.</p>

<p>After waiting a little over a month, Mr. Hodgkinson returned,
and brought back with him the news of Howitt's success in finding
King. This explained M'Kinlay's discovery as being that of Gray's
body, the adjuncts of the fight turning out to be exaggerations of
the natives. He made an excursion to the eastward, and visited the
graves of the two men buried by Howitt, on Cooper's Creek, then he
started for the north.</p>

<p>The perusal of his journal, containing the account of his first
few weeks' travel, is hard work to accomplish. The native names of
every small lake and waterhole are all given in full, and as the
course of each day's travel is omitted, it becomes rather difficult
to follow the track of the expedition, excepting on the map.</p>

<p>A fairly northerly course was, however, maintained, and M'Kinlay
speaks highly of the country for pastoral purposes. As it was the
dry time of the year, immediately preceding the setting in of the
rains, it shows what a severe season must have been encountered by
Sturt when on his last struggle north, as that explorer finally
turned his-back in much the same locality.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, heavy rains set in, fortunately, they
were in the neighbourhood of some stony ridges and sand hills, on
which they camped, and where they had plenty of space to feed their
animals, although surrounded by water.</p>

<p>On March 10th, they started again, and steadily continued north
through good travelling country, keeping back from the main creek,
which was now too flooded and boggy to follow. This large creek,
which was called by M'Kinlay the Mueller, is one of the main rivers
of the interior, now known as the Diamantina. M'Kinlay soon kept
more to the westward and crossed the stony range, which bears his
name, in much the same place that Burke and Wills did. He
christened many of the large tributaries of the inland watershed,
but most of his names have been replaced by others, it having been
difficult to determine them, as in many cases, the creeks he named
were but anabranches.</p>

<p>The history of their progress is now monotonous in the extreme,
the country through which they travelled presented no great
obstacle to the travellers' advance, being well-grassed and
watered; and finally on the 6th May they reached the Leichhardt
River.</p>

<p>M'Kinlay was most anxious to get to the mouth of the Albert, it
being understood that Captain Norman with the steamer Victoria,
would there form a depôt for the use of the other explorers,
Landsborough and Walker, and M'Kinlay's stock of rations was
getting perilously low.</p>

<p>His attempts to reach the sea were, however, fruitless. He was
continually turned back by deep and broad mangrove creeks and boggy
flats, and on the 21st May the party started for the nearest
settled districts in Queensland, in the direction of Port
Denison.</p>

<p>They were now on the country already twice described by both
Leichhardt and Gregory, and making in the same direction that
Gregory did on his return journey. Like him, too, M'Kinlay missed
following up the Flinders. He crossed on to the head of the head of
the Burdekin, which river he followed down, continually trusting to
meet the advancing flocks and herds of the settlers, then pushing
forward into the new country. On reaching Mount M'Connell, where
the tracks of the two former explorers came respectively to the
river, and left it, M'Kinlay kept down the river, crossing the
formidable Leichhardt Range, through which the Burdekin forces its
way to the lower lands of the coast. Here they came to a temporary
station, just formed by Mr. Phillip Somer, where they were received
with the usual hearty hospitality. Since leaving the Gulf country
the explorers had subsisted on little else than horse and camel
flesh, and were necessarily in rather a weak condition; but whilst
they were toiling down the channel of the Upper Burdekin, suffering
semi-starvation, they were actually travelling amongst the
advance-guard of the pioneer squatters, and had they but thought of
resting a day and looking around, their wants would have been
relieved long before they sighted the gorge of the Burdekin, and
their toilsome journey through that gorge have been prevented.</p>

<p>The tracks of the camels had been seen by one squatter [Note,
below] at least within a few hours after the cavalcade had passed
down the river, and a very little trouble would have saved M'Kinlay
much suffering.</p>

<p>[Note: Mr. E. Cunningham, who had then just formed Burdekin
Downs Station. He tells, with much amusement, how the nature of the
tracks puzzled himself and his black boy. The Burdekin pioneers of
course did not expect M'Kinlay's advent amongst them, although they
knew he was out west, and such an animal as a camel did not enter
into their reckoning. Cunningham says that the only thing he could
think of was, that it was a return party who had been looking for
new country, and that, having footsore horses and no shoes left,
they had wrapped up their horses' feet with bandages.]</p>

<p>M'Kinlay's trip across the continent did good service at this
juncture. His track was across the country that had always been
considered a terrible desert, useless for pastoral occupation. His
report being of such a favourable nature, dealt a final blow to
this theory, which Stuart had partly demolished. Fortunately,
M'Kinlay was an experienced man, whose verdict was accepted without
cavil.</p>

<p>The successful way in which he conducted his party across the
continent, and his well-known merits, led to his afterwards being
selected by the South Australian Government for a responsible post
in the Northern Territory, which will be dealt with in its proper
order.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, 1861, the <i>Firefly</i>, having on board
the Brisbane search party for Burke and Wills, left Brisbane. The
leader of the party was Mr. William Landsborough, an experienced
bushman, having already a good knowledge of new country gained in
private exploration. The brig was convoyed by the <i>Victoria</i>,
under Captain Norman, who had charge of the expedition until the
party were landed. On the way up, the vessels were separated, and
the <i>Firefly</i> suffered shipwreck on one of Sir Charles Hardy's
islands; the horses being got ashore safely. On the <i>Victoria</i>
coming up, the <i>Firefly</i> was repaired sufficiently to serve as
a transport. hulk and the party re-embarked; she was taken in tow
by the <i>Victoria</i>, and safely reached her destination at the
mouth of the Albert River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<p>The <i>Victoria</i>, as arranged, remained there to render
assistance to Landsborough on his return, and to the Rockhampton
search party under Mr. Walker, on his arrival overland.
Landsborough's track, after leaving the Albert, took him on to the
banks of a new river, which had the same outlet as the Albert, but
on account of the other explorers crossing below the junction, had
been hitherto unnoticed. This river, which is a constantly running
stream, and flows through well-grassed, level country, was named by
him the Gregory. His written opinion of the much-disputed qualities
of this district is most sanguine, with regard to its future as a
sheep country. Experience, however, has proved otherwise, it being
found to be fitted only for cattle. Higher up, Landsborough found
the river drier, and presenting a far less tropical appearance than
on its lower course. After continued efforts to the south, and the
discovery of many tributary creeks, Landsborough, on the 21St of
December, found the river which he named the Herbert, one of the
most important streams running south, and joining Eyre's Creek.
This river has since been re-named by the Queensland Government, in
consequence of there being another Herbert River in the territory.
With most questionable taste, the officials, out of a wide choice
of names, could find none better than the absurd, and inappropriate
one of the <i>Georgina</i>! by which it is now known.</p>

<p>The first important feature in Landsborough's Herbert, which
runs through richly-grassed tableland country, was met with on the
day following its discovery, when a fine sheet of water was found
which they named Lake Mary; below this, some distance, was another
pool&mdash;Lake Frances. Landsborough now made an attempt to push
to the westward, but failed through want of water, He then returned
up the Herbert, and crossed on to the head of the O'Shanassy, a
tributary of the Gregory. Down this river, and by way of Beames'
Brook, they returned to the depôt on the Albert, where they arrived
on the 8th February, 1862, having been absent nearly three
months.</p>

<p>Here Landsborough learnt that during his absence Walker had
arrived, and reported finding the tracks of Burke and Wills on the
Flinders. He therefore determined to go home in that direction,
instead of returning in the steamer, being anxious to see if he
could render any assistance. The party was reduced in number to
three whites and three blacks in all, namely, Messrs. Landsborough,
Bourne, and Gleeson, and the three boys&mdash;Jacky, Jemmy, and
Fisherman They had a decidedly insufficient stock of rations when
they started the second time, being without tea and sugar, the
<i>Victoria</i> not being able to supply them with any.</p>

<p>From the Albert depôt Landsborough made for the Flinders, by way
of the Leichhardt, and arrived at that river on the 19th February.
He followed it up, and was rewarded by being the first discoverer
of the beautiful downs country through which it runs. He named the
isolated and remarkable hills visible from the river Fort Bowen and
Mounts Brown and Little. On the upper part of the Flinders he named
Walker's Creek&mdash;a considerable tributary&mdash;and from there
struck more to the south, towards Bowen Downs country discovered by
himself and Buchanan two years previously. Here the leader was in
hopes of finding a newly-formed station, and obtaining some more
supplies; but the country was still untenanted, although in one
place they observed the track of a dray, and they also saw the
tracks of a party of horsemen near Aramac Creek. They now made for
the Thomson, which is formed by the junction of the Landsborough
and Cornish Creeks, but did not follow it down to the Barcoo,
striking that river higher up. On the Barcoo they had a slight
skirmish with the blacks, who nearly surprised them during the
night.</p>

<p>Landsborough was now back in well-known country; some of it, in
fact, he had been over before himself, and from the number of trees
they saw marked with different initials, it was evident that before
long stock would be on its way out. He crossed on to the Warrego,
followed that river down, and on the 21st of May came to the
station of Messrs. Neilson and Williams, where they heard of the
fate of Burke and Wills, the objects of their search. From here the
party proceeded to the Darling, and finally to Melbourne.</p>

<p>On Landsborough's arrival in Melbourne, he found that rumour had
accredited him with being more interested in looking for available
pastoral country than in hunting for Burke and Wills. So far as can
be seen, this accusation was utterly groundless, as there was no
saying to what part of the Gulf Burke and Wills would penetrate,
and he was as likely to meet with traces of them on the Barcoo as
well as anywhere else. With the general belief then current, of the
desert nature of the interior, nobody dreamt that four
inexperienced men would have been able to cross so easily in such a
straight line.</p>

<p>The charge lay in a newspaper paragraph that went the round of
the daily papers, an extract from which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Great credit must be given to Mr. Landsborough for the
celerity with which he has accomplished the expedition. At the same
time, its object seems to have been lost sight of at a very early
stage of the journey, as there was not the remotest probability of
striking Burke's track after quitting the Flinder's River, and
taking a S.S.E. course for the remainder of the way. In fact, from
that moment all mention [This is incorrect. Landsborough
particularly mentions in his journal during his trip to the Barcoo,
how anxiously he endeavoured to find out from the natives if they
had seen anybody with camels.] ceases to be made of the ostensible
purpose for which the party was organised, until Mr. Landsborough
reached the Warrego, and received the intelligence of Burke and
Wills having perished, at which great surprise was expressed. But
supposing these gallant men to have been still living, and
anxiously awaiting succour at some one of the ninety camping places
at which they halted, on their arduous journey between the depôt
and the Gulf what excuse could Mr. Landsborough have offered for
giving so wide a berth to the probable route of the explorers, and
for omitting to endeavour to strike their track, traces of which
had been reported on the Flinders by Mr Walker? We may be reminded
that 'all's well that ends well,' that the lamented explorers were
beyond the reach of human assistance, and that Mr. Landsborough has
achieved a most valuable result in following the course he did; but
we cannot help remarking that in so doing he seems to have been
more intent upon serving the cause of pastoral settlement than upon
ascertaining if it were possible to afford relief to the missing
men. The impression produced by a perusal of the dispatch which we
published on Saturday last is that the writer was commissioned to
open up a practicable route from the Warrego to the Flinders, and
not that he was the leader of a party which had been organized and
dispatched 'for the purpose of rendering relief, if possible, to
the missing explorers under the command of Mr. Burke.' We do not
wish to detract one iota from the credit due to Mr. Landsborough
for what he has actually effected, but we must not lose sight of
'the mission of humanity' in which he was professedly engaged, nor
the fact that this mission was replaced by one of a totally
different character, strengthening, as this circumstance does, the
conviction, which is gaining ground in the public mind, that we
have been deluded in expending large sums of money in sending out
relief expeditions which were chiefly employed in exploring
available country for the benefit of the Government and people of
Queensland. The cost and the empty honour has been ours, but theirs
has been the substantial gain."</blockquote>

<p>The reply to this is very simple. In the first place, Howitt had
been sent especially to follow up Burke from the start, and would
therefore be supposed to be searching the country on the direct
course. Again, Walker was&mdash;as Landsborough thought&mdash;then
following the homeward track of the lost party. The only chance of
affording succour to the missing men, left to Landsborough, was the
remote one of accidentally coming upon them. Nobody could have
reasonably supposed that such a costly and elaborately got up
expedition would have degenerated into a scamper across to the
Gulf, and a scramble back over the same country.</p>

<p>Apart from all this, Landsborough did not apply for a lease of
any of the country discovered by him on the search expedition, the
country called Bowen Downs having been his discovery of two years
previously, and considering that he closed his days in comparative
poverty, after all his labour, such insinuations as the above are
most unjust, and would be hardly worthy of comment save for the
prominent and adverse notice taken of it by William Howitt, in
general such an impartial historian.</p>

<p>The late William Landsborough first went north to Queensland in
1853. In 1854 Messrs. Landsborough and Ranken formed a station on
the Kolan River, between Gayndah and Gladstone, where between bad
seasons and blacks they had considerable trouble. In 1856 his
exploring career commenced in the district of Broadsound and the
Isaacs River. In 1858 he explored the Comet to the watershed, and
in the following year the head-waters of the Thomson.</p>

<p>An old friend and comrade, writing of him, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Landsborough's enterprise was entirely founded on his
own self-reliance. He had neither Government aid nor capitalists at
his back when he achieved his success as an explorer. He was the
very model of a pioneer&mdash;courageous, hardy, good-humoured, and
kindly. He was an excellent horseman, a most entertaining and, at
times, eccentric companion, and he could starve with greater
cheerfulness than any man I ever saw or heard of. But excellent
fellow though he was, his very independence of character and
success in exploring provoked much ill-will."</blockquote>

<p>It is to be hoped, therefore, that in future Landsborough's
great services will be regarded in a more just light than they were
by some of his contemporaries, particularly some living explorers,
who resemble the one alluded to by Dr. Lang:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"But Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is not the only geographical
explorer in Australia who, 'Turk-like, could bear no brother near
the throne.' It seems to be a family failing."</blockquote>

<p>Frederick Walker was the leader of the Rockhampton search
expedition. He was an old bushman, had had much to do with the
formation of the native police of Queensland, and took a party of
native troopers with him on this occasion.</p>

<p>On receiving his commission he pushed rapidly out to the Barcoo,
and in the neighbourhood of the tree marked <b>L</b>, found by
Gregory, discovered another <b>L</b> tree. This may or may not be
considered a corroboration that the first was Leichhardt's, there
being arguments on both sides. From the Barcoo he struck north-west
to the Alice, seeing some old horse-tracks, which he thought must
be Leichhardt's, but which were probably those of Landsborough and
Buchanan. From the head-waters of the Alice and Thomson, Walker
struck a river he called the Barkly, in reality the head of the
Flinders. Here he experienced much difficulty from the rough
basaltic nature of the country which borders the upper reaches of
this river. Finally getting on to the great western plains he
unwittingly crossed the Flinders, and went far to the north looking
for it. Bearing into the Gulf, he had several encounters with the
natives, who by this time it may be supposed began to see too many
exploring parties.</p>

<p>Walker's track down here is rather vague. He may be said to have
run a parallel course to the Flinders River away to the north of
it, until, on nearing the coast, the bend of the river brought it
across his course again. Here he found the tracks of the camels,
which assured him that Burke had at any rate reached the Gulf in
safety. He therefore pushed on to the depôt at the Albert to get a
supply of provisions, and return and follow the tracks up.</p>

<p>He reached the Victoria depôt safely, as before related, and
reported his discovery, having had two more skirmishes with the
natives on the way. Fresh provisioned, he made back for the
Flinders, but found it impossible to follow the tracks. From what
he saw, however, he formed a theory that Burke had retreated
towards Queensland, and there he made up his mind to return. He
regained his former course on the river he calls the Norman, but
which may have been the Saxby, and up this river he toiled till he
reached the network of watersheds which forms such a jumble of
broken country at the heads of the Burdekin, Lynd, Gilbert and
Flinders.</p>

<p>Here Walker's horses suffered severely from the rocks and
stones, until at last, by the time they had reached the Lower
Burdekin, they were well-nigh horseless, and quite starving. On the
4th of April, 1862, they reached Strathalbyn cattle station, owned
by Messrs. Wood and Robison, not far from where M'Kinlay eventually
arrived.</p>

<p>M'Kinlay's was the last party to use the roundabout and rugged
road to the head of the Burdekin that seemed to have such
attractions for all the explorers. Henceforth the road to the Gulf
lay down the wide plains of the Flinders.</p>

<p>Walker was afterwards employed by the Queensland Government to
explore a track for the telegraph line from Rockingham Bay to the
mouth of the Norman River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This he
carried out successfully; but when at the Gulf he was attacked by
the then prevalent malarial fever, and died there.</p>

<p>This completes the series of expeditions undertaken for the
relief of Burke and Wills. The eastern half of Australia was now
nearly all known&mdash;from south to north, and from north to
south, it had been crossed and re-crossed, and future enterprise
was soon to expend itself upon the western half.</p>

<p>So far the results arrived at had been most satisfactory. Not
much over forty years after Oxley's gloomy prediction of the future
of the interior, country had been found surpassing in richness any
that was then known. The pathways for the pioneers had been marked
out, and a few more years was to see the whole of the continent up
to the western boundary of Queensland the busy scene of pastoral
industry.</p>

<p>Most noticeable in the history we have just recounted is the
persistent manner in which each succeeding explorer found in all
new discoveries the fulfillment of some pet theory. To the men
brought up in the old school of belief in the central desert, every
fresh advance into the interior was only pushing the desert back a
step; it was there still, and, according to some, it is there now.
Others who believed in the great river theory, imagined its source
in the fresh discovery of every inland river; and those who pinned
their faith on a central range, accepted the low broken ridges of
the M'Donnel Ranges as the leading spurs.</p>

<p>But the discoveries of the luxuriant new herbage and edible
shrubs of the interior were the greatest stumbling block to all.
That the much-despised <i>salsolea</i> and other shrubs should be
coveted and sought after; that the bugbear of Oxley, the <i>acacia
pendula</i>, should now be held to indicate good country was
inconceivable; and when, above everything, the most fondly
cherished of all delusions, that in the torrid north the sheep's
wool would turn to hair, had to be given up, it was quite evident
that a new order of belief would soon be entertained.</p>

<p>Writers, however, were still found to argue that things must be
after the old opinion. When M'Kinlay took his little flock of sheep
across Australia and found them grow so fat that, when at the Gulf,
he had to select the leanest one to kill from choice, they cried
out triumphantly, "Ah, but the flesh was tasteless!" When he
assured them that he had never enjoyed better mutton, they said
that it was hunger made him think so.</p>

<p>Still the distinctive value of the country was not under stood.
Landsborough, who ought certainly to have known better, speaks
highly of the Gulf plains as a suitable sheep run; but he was not
alone in this belief. The valley of the Burdekin, and many of its
tributaries were stocked with sheep by men of acknowledged
experience. In a few years the error was found out, and sheep
pastures were sought for only in the uplands of the interior.</p>

<p>But the later explorations had done much good for the new colony
of Queensland. Most of the work, with the exception of Stuart's,
had been wrought out within her boundaries, and capital and stock
flowed in from all sides. This led to many private expeditions,
such as those conducted formerly by Messrs. Landsborough, Walker,
and Buchanan.</p>

<p>Amongst these, one under the leadership of Mr. Dalrymple
penetrated the coast country north of Rockhampton, and discovered
the main tributaries of the Lower Burdekin, the Bowen and the Bogie
rivers. They followed down the Burdekin in 1859, and discovered
that its <i>embouchere</i> was much higher up the coast than was
supposed. From this point they turned back, and ascending the coast
range, reached the upper waters of the Burdekin, and discovered the
Valley of Lagoons, west of Rockingham Bay. Another party,
consisting of Messrs. Cunningham, Somer, Stenhouse, Allingham, and
Miles explored the Upper Burdekin in the following year, and
discovered tracts of good pastoral country on the many tributaries
of that river. The remarkable running stream which joins the
Burdekin below the township of Dalrymple, and was noticed and
called by M'Kinlay the Brown River, was really first found by this
party, though where it obtained its present name of Fletcher's
Creek is not on record.</p>

<p>In the far south, the Great Bight became once more the scene of
interest. In 1862, Goyder paid a visit to the much-abused region
north of Fowler's Bay, but found nothing to reward him but mallee
scrub and spinifex. In this year Delisser and Hardwicke went over
the same country, but on a much more attractive route, as they came
upon a large, limitless plain, covered with grass and saltbush.
Unfortunately they could find no water, but since then this want
has been supplied by sinking and boring, and pastoral settlement
has extended so far.</p>

<p>In the year 1863, Mr. Thomas Macfarlane attempted to get inland,
north of the Bight, but was forced to turn back, after suffering
much hardship. He, too, found some fairly-grassed country, but
quite waterless.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, the colonists still made efforts to find
good country east of the Swan River. Lefroy and party pushed out to
the eastward of York, but were not able to give a much better
account of the country than their predecessors. In the north-west a
party of colonists landed at the De Grey River, and settled on the
country found by F. Gregory. Their account quite confirmed the one
given by that explorer previously.</p>

<p>Once more a fresh chapter in the history of exploration has to
be turned. All around the coast the fringe of settlement was
rapidly creeping, the gaps of unoccupied country growing smaller
and fewer every year. The adventurous traveller who now forced his
way through to the late uninhabited north coast would find several
infant settlements ready to receive him, and he would no longer be
obliged to retrace, with weakened frame and exhausted resources,
his toilsome outward track. The last stage of Australia's history
was about to set in; the telegraph wire was soon to follow on
Stuart's footsteps, and the ring of communication to be nearly
completed around the continent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The year 1863 was one of great activity in the northern part of
Australia. At Cape York the Imperial Government had, on the
recommendation of Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of
Queensland, decided to form a settlement. Mr. Jardine, the police
magistrate of Rockhampton was selected to take command, and a
detachment of marines was sent out to be stationed there.</p>

<p>At the Gulf of Carpentaria the township of Burketown was
springing into existence, under the care of William Landsborough,
the explorer; and in the north of Arnhern's Land, M'Kinlay was
looking for a suitable site to establish a port for South
Australia. Somerset, the formation of which led to the expedition
of the Jardine brothers, was formed on the mainland at the Albany
Pass, opposite the island of that name. Mr. Jardine was to proceed
by sea to his new sphere of office., but anticipating the want of
fresh meat at the new settlement, he entered into an arrangement
with the Government for his two sons to take a herd of cattle
overland to there. Somerset was near the fatal scene of poor
Kennedy's death, and knowing what tremendous difficulties that
explorer had met with on the east coast, it was decided to attempt
the western fall, through the unknown country fronting the
Gulf.</p>

<p>Both the Jardines were quite young men at the time when they
started, Frank, the accepted leader, being only twenty-two years
old, and his brother, Alexander, twenty. Besides themselves, the
party was composed of A. J. Richardson, a surveyor sent by the
Government; Messrs. Scrutton, Binney and Cowderoy, and four
natives. They had forty-two horses, and about two hundred and fifty
head of cattle, with four months, provisions.</p>

<p>Before their final start from Carpentaria Downs Station, then
the furthest occupied country to the north-west, and supposed to be
situated on the Lynd River, of Leichhardt, Alexander Jardine made a
trip of some distance ahead in order to ensure finding an available
road for the cattle, and saving delay when the actual start took
place.</p>

<p>On this preliminary journey he followed the presumed Lynd down
for nearly one hundred and eighty miles, until he was convinced
that there was an error, and that, whatever river it was, it
certainly was not Leichhardt's, as neither in appearance,
direction, nor position did it coincide with that explorer's
description.</p>

<p>On the subsequent journey with the cattle this supposition was
found to be correct, the river turning out to be a tributary of the
Gilbert, now known as the Einnesleigh. On the 11th of October,
after A. Jardine's return, the final start was made from
Carpentaria Downs, and the whole of the party commenced a journey
destined to be full of peril and adventure.</p>

<p>The beginning of their trip down the Einnesleigh was unavoidably
rough, and on the 22nd of the month they came to a halt to spell
their cattle and look for the Lynd River, to which they trusted to
carry them a good distance on their way. On the 24th the two
brothers started, and in about thirty miles came to another river,
where they found a fine chain of lagoons, but no country at all
resembling the Lynd. All search beyond being resultless, the went
back to the main body; and, leaving instructions for the cattle to
start by a certain date for the new-found lagoons, they made
another effort to find the Lynd.</p>

<p>This time they were again rewarded by discovering a good-sized
creek, but no sign of the Lynd was met with, nor did they ever see
it, as owing to an error in the map they had with them, the
location of the river had been thirty miles misplaced.</p>

<p>Returning to the lagoons, which the cattle had now reached,
instructions were given to start forward, but the first day one of
the series of heavy misfortunes befell them, that afterwards seemed
to dog them so perseveringly. In the morning a large number of the
horses were missing, and leaving a party behind to find them and
come on with the pack-horses, the Jardines and some of the others
made a start with the cattle, and on the second day reached the
large creek, but, to their surprise, without being overtaken by the
men with the pack-horses. After an anxious day spent in waiting,
Alexander Jardine went back to see what was the matter, and on his
way met the missing party charged with heavy news. Through some
carelessness in allowing the grass around the camp to catch fire,
half their rations, and nearly the whole of their equipment had
been burnt. In addition, one of the most valuable of their horses
had been poisoned. This misfortune coming at such an early stage of
the journey, with all the unknown country ahead of them, was most
serious, and jeopardised their prospect greatly. However, there was
no help for it; so giving up all hope of the Lynd, they followed
down the creek they were then camped on.</p>

<p>The natives soon commenced to give them a foretaste of what they
kept up during nearly the whole of the journey. Once about twenty
appeared at sundown, and boldly attacked the camp with a shower of
spears, and two days afterwards the younger Jardine, when out
alone, was suddenly surprised by them.</p>

<p>The creek finally led them to the Staaten River, and here the
blacks succeeded in stampeding the horses, and it was days before
some of them were recovered.</p>

<p>On the 5th December they left this ill-fated river, and steered
due north, but bad luck followed them, the torment of mosquitoes
and sandflies, added to bad feed, caused their horses to ramble
incessantly, and whilst the brothers were away on these hunting
excursions, the party at the camp allowed their solitary mule to
stray away with his pack on; and despite all efforts he was never
found again. Unfortunately, this animal carried a lot of their most
necessary articles, and their loss reduced them almost to the same
state as the blackfellows who surrounded them.</p>

<p>Two horses here went mad through drinking salt water, one died,
and the other was too ill to travel, and had to be left.</p>

<p>On December the 13th they at last reached the long-desired
Mitchell river, not without having another pitched battle on the
way with the natives. For the blacks followed them throughout with
the same relentless hostility that they formerly had shown to
Kennedy, and evidently meant to mete out the same fate to them, for
whilst the party were on the Mitchell they mustered in force, and
fell upon the travellers with the greatest determination, and it
was only after a severe contest, and heavy loss had been inflicted
on the savages that they retired.</p>

<p>It can be imagined how these continued attacks, in addition to
the harassing nature of the country, gave the party all they knew
to hold their own, and but for the prompt and plucky way in which
these assaults were always met, not one of the little band would
have survived. From what was afterwards found out from some of the
semi-civilized natives about Somerset, these tribes followed the
explorers for over four hundred miles.</p>

<p>Leaving the Mitchell and making north, they travelled through
poor country, thinly grassed, and badly watered, but the blacks
were still on their heels.</p>

<p>On the 28th December, they commenced on the horses, driving them
about, and another stand-up fight ensued. Storms of rain now set
in, and they had to travel through dismal ti-tree flats, with the
constant expectation of being caught by a flood on low-lying
country.</p>

<p>On the 5th of January, they came to a well-grassed valley, with
a good river running through it, which was named the Archer, and on
the 9th crossed another river, which was supposed to be the Coen.
On leaving this river, troubles thickened around them; the rain
continued incessantly, the country was so boggy they could scarcely
get their animals along at all, and to add to everything, when they
reached the Batavia, two horses were drowned in crossing, and six
more were poisoned [See appendix.] and died.</p>

<p>Fate seemed to have pretty well done her worst; they could do
nothing else but face the future manfully. Burying everything they
possibly could, they packed all the horses, and started resolutely
on foot. On the 14th, two more horses died, and the blacks came
once more to see how they were getting on. As may be imagined, the
white men were in not much of a humour for patience, and the
skirmish was a brief one.</p>

<p>On the 17th, two more horses died from the effects of the poison
plant, and they were reduced to fifteen out of the forty-two with
which they started. They were now approaching the narrow crest of
the cape, and found themselves on a dreary waste of sandy, barren
country, whereon only heath grew, intersected too with boggy
creeks. On the 10th of January, they caught a glimpse of the sea to
the eastward, from the top of a tree, and on the 20th it was in
plain view.</p>

<p>They were now amongst the same description of scrubs that had
played such havoc with Kennedy, and day after day they only
advanced a few miles. On the 29th, after many days of bog and scrub
cutting, it was determined to halt the cattle, whilst the two
Jardines made an effort to reach Somerset, and find a less
difficult track, as they now believed themselves only twenty miles
from that place; but in reality they were more, although, after the
country they had passed through, any calculation that could be made
would be only approximate.</p>

<p>On the 30th January, the brothers, with their most-trusted black
boy, "Eulah," started to find the settlement, taking with them a
small quantity of rations. For a time they were hemmed-in in a bend
of what they took to be the Escape River, but on leaving it
suddenly came on a large river running to the west coast, which is
now known as the Jardine. This forced them to return to the main
camp, and after a few days' rest, they made to the north again,
swimming their horses over at the main camp, where the cattle were,
and from there starting, this time down the stream.</p>

<p>This trip was a most fatiguing one, through dense vine scrub,
through which they had to work their way tomahawk in hand. On the
second day they sighted the ocean, and after travelling towards it,
came to a river three-quarters of a mile wide, which they could not
cross. Following it up through fearful country, as Jardine says,
"too bad to describe," they had to at last camp where they were,
being cut off from even approaching the river by a formidable belt
of mangroves. Next day was spent in like fruitless attempts, and
the next the same.</p>

<p>It being evident that there was no crossing-place for the cattle
to be found, they turned back to the camp, having come to the
conclusion that the rivers were identical, and that on their first
expedition they had been deceived by a large bend.</p>

<p>Tired and wearied, disappointed at finding themselves so near
the settlement, and yet hemmed in and embarrassed by impenetrable
thickets, and impassable morasses, the brothers now made up their
minds to start with the whole party, and try to get round the big
bend of the Escape that they thought they must be on. After killing
a bullock they started, and at their third camp, from the top of
the high ridge they sighted the sea to the westward, and were able
to trace the course of the river the whole way, thus convincing
themselves at last that it was riot the Escape they were on.</p>

<p>A reference to the map will at once explain the peculiarity of
the course of these two rivers that had so puzzled the explorers.
The Jardine is a large river heading from the east coast, and
running, with many bends, clear across the promontory to the west
coast, completely heading the Escape which has been a short course.
As the Jardine River was before unknown, and the Escape was
well-known, it was but natural that the mistake should have
occurred. Added to all this, they were in the depth of the wet
season, and amidst flooded creeks whose size and importance could
not be fairly gauged.</p>

<p>Once more the two brothers and the black boy swam the river, and
made a third effort to reach Somerset. For two days they were
detained on the bank of a flooded creek, crossing it on its
subsidence on the third day. On the 28th February they were in
better country, and a good stage was made, and the next morning
they encountered a tribe of blacks who greeted them with cries of
"Alico! Franco! Tobacco!" and other words. From these natives they
finally selected three as guides, and at noon the following day
reached the settlement.</p>

<p>As was but natural, their long journey had caused their father
great trouble and anxiety; he had done all in his power to help
them at the end, having cut a marked tree line almost across the
promontory, and instructed the blacks in the few English words they
could remember to greet the wanderers if they met with them, which
last device succeeded admirably.</p>

<p>It remains but to be said that the rest of the party and the
remnant of their stock were soon brought in to Somerset, where a
cattle station was formed. When we look at the difficulties through
which they had forced their way, and the unexpected misfortunes
that beset them, one cannot help feeling the greatest admiration
for the two brothers in attaining such success, not having lost a
member of the party throughout the journey, in spite of the
numberless treacherous attacks of the natives to which they were
subjected, and the daily risks of illness, swimming flooded rivers,
and other perils. Above all regret must be felt that their work was
not better rewarded by the discovery of available pastoral country,
but that result it was not in their power to control. They had at
any rate the proud feeling of having done their duty, and that
beset by the same dangers that had environed poor Kennedy, they had
lived to tell the tale when he had laid down his life.</p>

<p>Whilst the Jardines were fighting their way through to Cape
York, and rendering such good service to geographical research, a
labour which the Royal Geographical Society afterwards acknowledged
by electing the brothers, Fellows of the Society, and awarding the
Murchison grant to each of them, the pioneer squatters were
everywhere busy.</p>

<p>Mr. J. G. Macdonald started with a small party to visit the much
lauded Plains of Promise, and discover a better route for stock
than the one formerly taken by the explorers. By crossing the
dividing range on to the upper part of the Flinders, and following
that river down, a much shorter and more practicable route was made
available for the army of cattle and sheep now marching to the
western pasture land, and the magnificent country on the river
named after the great navigator was brought prominently into
notice.</p>

<p>In the far north of Australia, settlement on a fresh scale was
once more undertaken; this time under purely colonial auspices. The
territory beyond the northern boundary line of South Australia,
extending to the shores of Arnheim's Land, and part of the Gulf of
Carpentaria had long been considered No Man's Land, although the
English had formerly taken possession of it. The arrival of the
<i>Astrolabe</i> and <i>Zelie</i> in Raffles Bay in 1839, gave
colour to the supposition that the French had a design to secure
part of this territory after our first abandonment of it.
Fortunately Sir Gordon Bremer was in time to make the second
settlement at Port Essington a few short weeks before the
appearance of M, Dumont D'Urville, even as Governor Phillip
forestalled La Perouse.</p>

<p>The territory was provisionally annexed to the Province of South
Australia by commission under the great seal, bearing date 8th
July, 1863. It comprised all the country to the northward of the
twenty-sixth parallel south latitude, and between the 129th and
138th degrees of east longitude.</p>

<p>The inland country was known only from the description of
Stuart, Gregory and Leichhardt.</p>

<p>In 1864 an expedition left Adelaide to proceed by sea to Adam
Bay, and there form a depôt, whilst search for a suitable site for
a township was made. Colonel Finnis was sent in charge of the
infant colony, and three vessels, the <i>Henry Ellis</i>, the
<i>Yatala</i>, and the <i>Beatrice</i> conveyed the emigrants to
their destination, where they safely arrived in August, 1864.</p>

<p>A discretionary power had been entrusted to the leader with
regard to the choice of a suitable position; Port Essington and
Raffles Bay were excepted, the former failures to establish
settlements at those places being probably looked upon as
ominous.</p>

<p>Escape Cliffs in Adam Bay, so called from the narrow escape two
officers of the <i>Beagle</i> had from death at the hands of the
natives, was chosen, but the choice was not ratified. A good deal
of dissension broke out in the early days, and J. M'Kinlay, the
well-known explorer, was sent north to select a more favourable
position, and report generally on the capabilities of the
territory. He organized an exploring party, and left the camp at
Escape Cliffs with the intention of making a long excursion to the
eastward; but he only reached the East Alligator River, where he
was cut off and hemmed in by sudden floods, and narrowly escaped
losing his whole party. Everything had to be abandoned, and the
explorers escaped from their critical position by resorting to the
construction of coracles of horse hide, by means of which they
managed to save their lives. On his return, M'Kinlay examined the
mouth of the Daly River in Anson Bay, and recommended it as a site
in preference to Escape Cliffs, the suggestion was not, however,
acted on.</p>

<p>This was M'Kinlay's last expedition. He died at Gawler, in South
Australia, in December, 1874.</p>

<p>The affairs of the new settlement were now in such a
disorganised state that a commission of enquiry was appointed, and
the result was that Colonel Finnis was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Goyder then selected Port Darwin as a better situation than
that of Escape Cliffs, and the township was laid out and the
residents removed to there. The establishment of the overland
telegraph line soon caused the town of Palmerston to take permanent
importance, which the discovery of gold in the Northern Territory
confirmed.</p>

<p>Western Australia, too, had an unfortunate experience about this
time, an attempt being made to establish a settlement at Camden
Harbour. The country was quite unsuitable, and it was
abandoned.</p>

<p>Some fresh interest was now aroused in the unsettled question of
the fate of Leichhardt. A Mr. M'Intyre, who, in 1864, was taking
stock from the Darling to the Flinders River, found himself stopped
on the Queensland border by the stock regulations then in force in
that colony. Whilst detained there he made several short
excursions, and examined the country between the head of the Paroo
and the Barcoo, discovering many well-watered creeks and a lake of
considerable size. On his return, finding that there was still no
chance of his being allowed to take his stock on, he determined to
make a trip to the Gulf of Carpentaria and examine the country he
intended taking up.</p>

<p>The party left the Paroo on the 21St June, 1864, and the journey
led to an unexpected discovery. On the way over, M'Intyre found and
buried the bodies of two unfortunate pioneers who had preceded him,
Messrs. Curlewis and M'Culloch. They had. been murdered when asleep
by the natives.</p>

<p>Twenty-two days after leaving the Paroo they reached Cooper's
Creek, and then pursued much the same track to the Gulf as that
formerly followed by Burke and Wills, and M'Kinlay. Three hundred
miles from the sea, and to the westward of Burke's track, M'Intyre
came upon two old saddle-marked horses, grazing upon what appeared
to be a permanently watered creek. A short distance to the eastward
he found the traces of two camps, and two trees marked <b>L</b>.
From these circumstances M'Intyre concluded that he had come upon
new and important traces of the lost explorer.</p>

<p>On his return to the south, public interest was at once aroused,
and, aided by the championship of Baron Von Mueller, whose
enthusiasm in the cause of discovery never flags, a committee was
formed to organise a party to at once follow up these clues, and
try to set at rest the much-vexed question.</p>

<p>In order to fully arouse the sympathies of the public, the
matter was with much gallantry placed in the hands of the ladies of
Victoria, and under their auspices a party was equipped and the
command given to Mr. M'Intyre. Unfortunately for the success of the
expedition, the leader died of malarial fever before the party left
the settled districts of the Gulf of Carpentaria. From the course
mapped out for the explorers, there is no doubt that, even if the
aim of the expedition had not been reached, an earlier knowledge of
much unknown country would have been obtained.</p>

<p>As was but natural, the construction of the overland telegraph
line between Adelaide and Port Darwin led to numbers of short
explorations on either side of the line, which considerably added
to our knowledge of the interior, but of which no records have been
kept.</p>

<p>The establishment of this telegraph line and its maintenance did
much towards the settlement of Central Australia. It formed, as it
were, a chain of outposts through the heart of the continent, and
thereby greatly facilitated the success of many private expeditions
undertaken in quest of country for pastoral purposes.</p>

<p>South Australia had served a rough apprenticeship in the cause
of exploration, and the experience gained by her pioneers now stood
her in good stead in the successful accomplishment of the national
work she at this time undertook&mdash;the establishment of
telegraphic communication with England. Queensland, the youngest
colony of the group, was striving very hard to secure the landing
of the cable on her shores. Walker, the leader of one of the Burke
and Wills search parties, was out examining the country at the back
of Rockingham Bay, and marking a telegraph line from there to the
mouth of the Norman River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. South
Australia, however, thanks to her energy and superior geographical
position, secured the honour; and already the completion of a
railway across the country which witnessed the repeated efforts of
Stuart is being hastened on.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, in 1864, Hunt made a long excursion to the
eastward of York, and travelled for 400 miles over the country
lying between the 31st and 32nd parallels. He found nothing to
reward him for his trouble&mdash;scrub, salt lakes and samphire
flats were the same wearisome. repetition.</p>

<p>During the construction of the overland telegraph line it was
surmised that such a close examination of the country as would
necessarily ensue, might lead to the finding of traces of
Leichhardt, if he ever had reached so far on his journey; but none
were found. Apparently it suggested an idea to a prisoner in one of
the gaols of New South Wales, for he made a statement to the effect
that he had been employed as a labourer on the construction of the
overland telegraph line, and whilst so engaged had been in the
habit of making long excursions into the unexplored territory on
either side of the line. During one of these trips he came across
some blacks, who informed him that they had an old white man living
with their tribe. Hume&mdash;which was the name of the hero of this
story&mdash;professed to have an intimate acquaintance with the
habits and customs of the natives, and willingly accompanied them
to their camp. Here he found a venerable old white man, who turned
out to be Classen&mdash;Leichhardt's brother-in-law&mdash;and from
him Hume learnt that the death of the leader and most of his party
happened through a mutiny in the camp, Leichhardt being murdered,
and the party then becoming disorganised and lost. This absurd
story was repeated so earnestly that inquiries were instituted, and
it was found that Hume had really been employed on the telegraph
line, and that whilst there he had been absent for some time on one
or two occasions.</p>

<p>Hume was interviewed by some gentlemen who were interested in
the solution of Leichhardt's fate, and he now added a little
additional matter: that on a subsequent visit he found that
Classen, rendered restless by the near neighbourhood of the whites,
had made an effort to reach them and died in the attempt. This,
with a few variations as to the details of the death of Leichhardt,
led to Hume being released from gaol for the purpose of leading a
party to the spot where Classen had pointed out that he had
concealed Leichhardt's journals. But for the tragedy that ended the
affair this episode would scarcely be of sufficient importance to
insert in the history of explorations. Money having been furnished
for the purpose, Hume and two companions started on their search.
They reached Thargomindah&mdash;then the nucleus of a small
township in Western Queensland&mdash;and left a station called
Nockatunga to make a short cut across some dry country. One man
only turned up. He said that they had lost themselves, had
separated looking for water, and with much difficulty he reached
the station. Search being instituted the dead bodies of Hume and
the other man were found, they having perished of thirst. This
story was revived many years afterwards by another man, who had
lived a good deal on the frontiers of Queensland. According to him,
Leichhardt and some of his party died of hunger and thirst, Classen
was revived again, and the discoverer stated that he had in his
possession a diary and many relics of the explorer. Although
expressing his willingness to produce the relics on receiving the
promise of an adequate reward, he never did so, and having attained
a temporary notoriety, returned to his former obscurity. This may
be said to end the rumours of the discovery of Leichhardt's
memorials, They served no good end in any way.</p>

<p>John Forrest, of Western Australia, made his first important
journey in 1869. It will be remembered that a report had been
current for many years amongst the natives of Western Australia, to
the effect that a party of white men coming from the east had been
murdered by the natives on the shore of an interior salt lake. A
Mr. Monger, when out west in search of pastoral country, came
across a native who stated that he had been to the place where the
murder was committed, had seen the remains, and would lead the
party there.</p>

<p>As usual with the Australian natives, his story was most
circumstantial. He described the scene of the murder as being in
the neighbourhood of a large lake, so large that it looked like the
sea, and that the white men were attacked and killed whilst making
a damper. These artistic details with which the blacks embellish
their narratives, make it very hard to refuse credence to them.</p>

<p>Baron Von Mueller immediately wrote to the Western Australian
Government, offering to lead a party there, and ascertain the truth
of the report. The Government took the matter up, and made
preparations to start an expedition. Von Mueller was, however,
prevented by his other engagements from taking charge, and the
command was given to Mr. John Forrest, a surveyor.</p>

<p>On the 26th of April, 1869, Forrest and his party reached
Yarraging, then the farthest station to the eastward. On the first
of May, when camped at a native well, visited by Austin in 1854,
Forrest says that he could still distinctly see the tracks of that
explorer's horses. Past this spot he fell in with natives, who told
him that a large party of men and horses died at a place in a
northerly direction, and that a gun belonging to the party was
still in the possession of the blacks. On closer examination this
story turned out to relate to nine of Mr. Austin's horses poisoned
during his expedition. Forrest continued his journey to the
eastward, and on the 18th came to a large dry salt lake, which he
named Lake Barlee. An attempt to cross this lake resulted in
getting the horses bogged, and a good deal of hard work had to be
gone through before the packs and horses were once more safe on dry
land Lake Barlee was afterwards found to be of great size,
extending for more than forty miles to the eastward. The native
guide Forrest had with him now became rather doubtful as to the
exact position of the spot where he professed to have seen the
remains, and Forrest, after some searching, came across a large
party of the local inhabitants. But they proved anything but
friendly, threw dowaks at the blackfellow, and advised the whites
to go away before they were killed. As it was getting dark they
adopted this advice, and retreated some five miles and camped, Mr.
Monger having unfortunately lost his revolver in the scrub. Next
morning they managed to get speech with two of the blacks, who
restored the revolver, which they had found, and had been warming
at the fire. These men stated that the bones were two days' journey
to the north, but they were the bones of horses, not of men, and
offered to take the whites there, promising to come to the camp the
following day, a promise which was riot kept.</p>

<p>No other intercourse with the blacks was obtainable, at least
none that produced any good results. One old man simply howled
piteously all the time they were in his company, and another one,
who had two children with him, said most emphatically that he had
never heard of any horses having been killed, but that the natives
had just killed and eaten his brother.</p>

<p>After vainly searching the district for many days, Forrest
determined to utilise the remainder of the time at his disposal by
examining the country as far to the eastward as his resources would
permit.</p>

<p>It was evident that the story of the white men's remains had
originated from the bones of the horses that died during Austin's
trip; and, as no matter how circumstantial might be the narrations
of the blacks, they invariably contradicted them the next time they
were interrogated, it was evident it would serve little purpose
being led by them on a foolish errand from place to place.</p>

<p>After pushing some distance east with very little encouragement
in the shape of good country, Forrest, taking with him one black
boy and a seven days' supply of rations. made a final excursion
ahead, and managed to reach a point one hundred miles beyond the
spot where he left his companions encamped. He found nothing to
reward him. It was only by means of shallow and scanty pools of
water that he managed to get so far, and the country where he
turned back was certainly clearer than any he had crossed but it
was only open sand plains, with spinifex and large white gums. He
climbed a large gum tree to have a last look to the eastward, but
it was a scene of desolation. Some rough sandstone cliffs were
visible, distant about six miles N.E.; more to the north, a narrow
line of samphire flats appeared, with cypress and stunted gums on
its edges everywhere there was spinifex, and no prospect of water.
Forrest turned back, and retraced his steps to where he had left
his companions.</p>

<p>On his homeward way he managed to cross the dry bed of Lake
Barlee, which had so nearly engulfed his horses, and examined the
northern side of it.</p>

<p>On their return track Forrest kept a more northerly and westerly
course, but saw nothing to alter the unfavourable report of the
country made by the former explorers. He returned to Perth on the
6th August.</p>

<p>Forrest was not more successful than those preceding him in
finding good available country to the eastward, but he at any rate
obtained a correct and reliable survey of a good deal of country
hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>On his return to Perth, Baron Von Mueller, whose ardour in the
cause was rather increased by the disappointment experienced in
finding that the accounts of the natives were quite unreliable,
recommended a journey from the head waters of the Murchison in the
direction of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Forrest was quite willing to
undertake the trip, but want of funds stood in the way just then,
and the matter was not enthusiastically supported by others.</p>

<p>It was then proposed to make a journey to Adelaide. by way of
the Great Bight, which had not been traversed since Eyre's
celebrated march round it, and the leadership was offered to
Forrest and accepted by him.</p>

<p>The party, beside the leader, consisted of his brother
Alexander, two white men and two natives, one of the last having
been on the former trip. A coasting schooner, the <i>Adur</i>, of
thirty tons, was to accompany them round the coast, calling at
Esperance Bay, Israelite Bay, and Eucla, there to supply the party
with fresh stores. On the 30th March, they left Perth.</p>

<p>The first part of the journey to Esperance Bay was through
comparatively settled and well-known country, so that but little
interest attaches to it. At Esperance Bay, where the Messrs.
Dempster had a station, they arrived a few days before the relief
schooner, and on the 9th May started for Israelite Bay.</p>

<p>From Esperance Bay to Israelite Bay the record of the journey is
equally tame, and it was not until he once more parted from his
relief boat that Forrest had to encounter the serious part of his
undertaking. He had now to face the line of cliffs fronting the
Bight behind which he had, he knew, little or no chance of finding
water for one hundred and fifty miles. Forrest says that these
cliffs, which fell perpendicularly into the sea, although grand in
the extreme, were terrible to gaze from.</p>

<blockquote>"After looking very cautiously over the precipice, we
all ran back quite terror-stricken by the dreadful
view."</blockquote>

<p>Having made what arrangements he could to carry water, Forrest
left the last water on the 5th of April. They reached the break in
the cliffs where the water was obtainable by digging amongst the
sandhills, on the 13th April, without any loss, having luckily
found many small rock holes filled with water, which enabled him to
push steadily on.</p>

<p>While recruiting at the sand hills he made an excursion to the
north, and after passing through a fringe of scrub twelve miles
deep, came upon most beautifully grassed downs. At fifty miles from
the sea there was nothing visible but gently undulating plains of
grass and saltbush at far as could be seen. There being no prospect
of finding water, he was forced to turn back, fortunately finding
small waterholes both on his outward and homeward way.</p>

<p>On the 24th, they started for Eucla, the last point at which
they were to meet the Adur. On this course he kept to the north of
the Hampton Range, and crossed well-grassed country, but destitute
of surface water, reaching Eucla on the 2nd July. The <i>Adur</i>
was there awaiting them, and the parties were soon re-united.</p>

<p>On the 8th, Forrest and his brother made another excursion to
the north; he penetrated some thirty miles finding, as before,
beautifully-grassed, boundless plain 9, but no signs of surface
water.</p>

<p>After leaving Eucla, the explorers had a distressing stage to
the head of the Great Bight, where they obtained water by digging
in the sand, the horses having been three days without a drink,
suffering much more than on any previous stage. From here they soon
entered the settled districts of South Australia, and the exploring
came to an end.</p>

<p>Although this trip of Forrest's can hardly be called an
exploring trip, inasmuch as he was repeating the journey made by
Eyre, he embraced a great deal of new country during its
performance, and, owing to the larger facilities he enjoyed, was
able to pronounce a much more impartial verdict than Eyre was
competent to do. Eyre, be it remembered, was struggling on for his
life, Forrest travelled in comparative ease, being able to supply
himself three times from the schooner during the journey; it is but
natural that Eyre's report should bear a very sombre tinge.</p>

<p>Forrest showed that the fringe of gloomy thicket was only
confined to the coast; beyond, he on every occasion found fine
pastoral country. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The country passed over between longitude 126 deg. 24
min. E. as a grazing country, far surpasses anything I have ever
seen. There is nothing in the settled portions of Western Australia
equal to it, either in extent or quality; but the absence of
permanent water is a great drawback;...the country is very level,
with scarcely any undulation, and becomes clearer as you proceed
northward."</blockquote>

<p>The rapid progress now being made in improved methods of boring
for water, will soon bring this country under the sway of the
pastoralists, and without doubt render it one of the most valuable
provinces of Western Australia.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Adelaide, Forrest received a hearty welcome,
and equally so on his return to Perth. In the following year
Alexander Forrest took charge of a private exploring party in
search of new pastoral country. He had the advantage of a good
season, and reached as far as 123 deg. 37 min. E. longitude; he
then struck S.S.E., towards the coast, finally returning by way of
Messrs. Dempster's station in Esperance Bay.</p>

<p>Forrest's expedition, unfortunately, left no hope that any river
existed that might possibly have been unknowingly crossed at its
mouth by Eyre.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Before following up Forrest's career as an explorer, and tracing
his most important work of crossing the centre of Australia from
the sea to the telegraph line, we must see what the South
Australians had been doing.</p>

<p>Ernest Giles, in 1872, made an excursion to the westward,
starting from Chambers' Pillar. His progress was stopped by a
large, dry, salt lake, to which he gave the high-sounding name of
Lake Amadens, and which unhappily figures on maps of Australia in a
rather misleading way, as a large, permanent, <i>bona fide</i>
lake. Not being able with his small party to ascertain the exact
limits of this obstacle, which was of the same character as those
so often described as barring the way of the Western Australian
explorers, Giles returned, having traversed a good deal of country,
up to that time unknown and unexamined.</p>

<p>In the following year he again took the field, assisted by the
help and sympathy of Baron Von Mueller, and a sum of money
subscribed by the South Australian Government. He left the settled
districts at the river now called the Alberga, which flows into
Lake Eyre, and travelling north-west, made many determined attempts
to cross the spinifex desert that had confronted him; but had to
return beaten.</p>

<p>On one occasion, anxious to reach a range that he saw in the
distance, and where he hoped to find a change of country, he
started with one man and a supply of water on pack horses; as the
horses knocked up they were left to find their way back themselves,
until at last, when but two were left, Giles sent his companion,
Gibson, back on one, whilst he made a final effort to reach the
range.</p>

<p>This trip, which recalls one of the purposeless and impetuous
exploits of Grey, resulted in the death of Gibson and the loss of
several horses. Giles' horse soon knocked up, and he had to return
on foot. Having, with really astonishing prudence, left a keg of
water buried on his way out, he made for that. To his dismay, after
proceeding some distance he saw Gibson's track turn off on the
trail of one of the horses that had been abandoned, instead of
keeping to the outward track. Hoping still that he might have found
his way back, Giles hastened on to the buried keg, but it was
untouched, and he knew that the unfortunate man's fate was sealed.
Giles made his way back to where the rest were encamped, and they
immediately went in search; but it was fruitless. Neither man nor
horse were ever seen again, and the scene of his death is now
marked on the maps as "Gibson's Desert." During his excursions in
various directions, trying to find a westward route, Giles
discovered and traversed four different ranges of mountains. The
party suffered much from the hostility of the blacks, who on
several occasions attacked them; and the leader, in his journal,
complains, like Warburton, of the sleepless nights caused by the
myriads of ants that infested the desert country. The farthest
point reached was the 125th degree of east longitude. He returned
to Adelaide after an absence of twelve months, during which he had
gone through much hardship and danger.</p>

<p>The tract of country between the overland telegraph line and the
western settlements now became the battlefield of the explorers;
few of them, it is true, hoped to find much available country, the
accounts of those who had penetrated a short distance being so
depressing; but they struggled for the honour of being the first to
cross the gap of unknown land, often to the neglect of careful
inspection.</p>

<p>One of the expeditions that led to the western half of the
continent being condemned as a hopeless desert was that commanded
by Colonel Warburton, It was promoted by two South Australian
colonists whose names have been always to the front when
exploration has been concerned&mdash;Messrs. Thomas Elder and
Walter Hughes. They jointly fitted out the expedition, which, it
was hoped, would lead to the advancement of geographical knowledge;
unfortunately, the result was not at all commensurate. The original
idea was that the party should start from about the neighbourhood
of Central Mount Stuart, and make for Perth, this course, however,
was not adhered to. In spite of being fitted out solely with
camels, Warburton suffered so much delay in getting through the
sandhills that his provisions were all consumed and his camels
knocked up before he got half-way through, compelling him to bear
up north to the head waters of the Oakover River, discovered by F.
Gregory.</p>

<p>The party consisted of the leader and his son Richard, Mr. Lewis
(surveyor), one white man, two Afghans, and a black boy. They had
seventeen camels, and six months' rations. On the 15th of April,
1873, the explorers left Alice Springs, one of the stations on the
overland telegraph line, and on the 17th reached the Burt, where
they left the line and struck out west. Warburton's course at first
lay some seventy miles south of Central Mount Stuart; but after a
vain search for the rivers Hugh and Fincke, which were supposed to
flow through the M'Donnell Ranges, he altered his direction,
steering to the north-west, meaning to connect with A. C. Gregory's
most southerly point on Sturt's Creek. Their way for some distance
was through good pastoral country, and in some of the minor ranges
beautiful glens were discovered, with deep permanent pools of water
in their beds. So frightened were the camels at the appearance of
the rocks that surrounded these water-holes, that they would not
approach them to drink, and, in fact, even refused the water when
it was brought to them.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of May, after being some days in poor sandy country,
they came to a good creek, the head of which was running, and the
whole flat where the creek emerged from the hills was one spring.
This spot, the best camp they had yet seen, was named Eva Springs.
Leaving the main party resting at these springs, Warburton, with
two companions, started on ahead, and were successful in finding
some native wells, that enabled him to break up his camp and move
on with the whole of the men and material.</p>

<p>On the 5th June they crossed the boundary line between Western
Australia and South Australia; but their progress was now
monotonous and most uninteresting, being through the scrubby, sandy
tableland common to the interior.</p>

<p>At some native wells, called by them Waterloo Wells, they had an
enforced spell of more than a month, and in addition lost three
camels, and one of the Afghans nearly died of scurvy. Afterwards
they soon got fairly into the salt-lake country, and on the 12th
August, at the end of a long and exhausting march, were relieved by
one of the small native wells, on which the blacks of this region
exist. They were now by their reckoning within ten miles of Sturt's
Creek; but although Warburton made two separate attempts to find
it, he was unable to see any country that at all resembled the
description given by Gregory.</p>

<p>He concluded there was some error in the longitude, and
proceeded on his westerly course. The record of the day's journey
now becomes a simple tale of traversing a barren country, and an
incessant search for native wells; added to that, the excessive
heat, caused by the radiation of the sandhills during the day
induced the leader to spare his camels as much as possible, by
travelling at night. This naturally led to a most unsatisfactory
inspection being made of the country, and it is impossible to say
what clues or indications to better country or more permanent
waters were passed by. In fact, he more than once during this part
of his journal mentions the fact of wild geese flying over the
camp, although they never found any surface water to account for
their presence.</p>

<p>Starvation was shortly looming ahead; the constant halts and
delays had so protracted their journey that they were almost at the
end of their resources, and still surrounded by a most inhospitable
waste. Sickness, too, came on then, and the full brunt of the
search work ahead fell upon Lewis and the black boy, Charley; their
time was taken up in watching for the smoke of the natives' fires,
or looking for their tracks. In the evening they could travel a
little, and in the early morning; at night the myriads of ants
proved an unbearable plague, and prevented the wearied men getting
their natural rest. Their position was as well nigh hopeless as it
was possible for any party to be in; if they stopped to relieve
their camels they starved themselves, and without rest the camels
could not carry them to look for native wells ahead. At last, on
the 9th of October, they reached a small waterhole that the camels
themselves had found when straying, and here perforce, they had to
rest, for with the exception of Lewis and the black boy, the
remainder of the party were too weak to do anything. At this camp
they slaughtered another of their precious camels, and for a time
satisfied their gnawing hunger with the fresh meat; they were also
lucky enough to get some galar parrots and pigeons. Here they
stayed for nearly three weeks, and then shifted to another well to
the south.</p>

<p>Warburton now decided to make a desperate push to the head of
the Oakover River, and effect his escape if possible from the
desert; on the evening of the fourth they started, and but for the
black boy would have doubtless all marched on to death. The boy had
left the camp in the morning, after their first night's tramp, and
coming across the tracks of some natives, ran them up, finding
another well at their camp, by the time he got back, the party had
been obliged to start without him; fortunately, he heard the tinkle
of the camel bell as he crossed the sandhills, and by cooeeing
loudly managed to attract attention. He then led the way to this
new source of relief, which, but for him, the party would have
missed.</p>

<p>Again they recommenced their journey to the Oakover, Lewis and
Charley on ahead, Warburton and his son coming on as fast as their
exhausted state would permit; their only hope for life now lay in
the chance of the advance party finding water soon and bringing it
back to them. At midday, on the 14th, Lewis appeared with a bag of
water; another well had been found, but this time it nearly cost
Charley's life. As he usually did, he had gone in advance when
close to the native camp, in order not to alarm them. The blacks
had received him kindly and given him water; but when he cooeed for
his companions they took a sudden alarm, and set upon him, spearing
him in the arm and back, and cutting his head open with a club. The
remainder of the party were just able to rescue him. It seems quite
certain that this attack was not premeditated, but the effect of
timidity caused by the unexpected appearance of the white men and
the camels.</p>

<p>At this well the party had to rest, until Lewis and one of the
Afghans pushed on to the head of the Oakover, which they thought
could not be so very far distant, as the nights were cool and dewy,
and in the camp of the natives they found two large seashells, an
old iron tomahawk, and part of the tire of a dray wheel.</p>

<p>On the 19th November Lewis started, and on the 25th he returned,
having been successful in reaching the head waters of the Oakover,
and on the 5th December the whole party arrived at the rocky creek
that he had found. They now travelled very slowly down the river,
but saw no signs of settlement, so the indefatigable Lewis had once
more to go ahead, whilst the others waited and starved on the flesh
of the last camel. He had to ride 170 miles before he arrived at
the station of Messrs. Grant, Harper, and Anderson, who immediately
supplied him with fresh horses and all requisites with which to
return to the starving men.</p>

<p>It was on the 29th of December, and Warburton was lying in the
shade, moodily thinking that the cattle station must be abandoned,
and that Lewis had been forced to go on to Roeburne, when the black
boy, who was climbing up a tree, called out, and starting to their
feet the astonished men found the pack-horses of the relief party
almost in their camp.</p>

<p>Out of the seventeen camels the two that Lewis had ridden in for
help were all that survived, and for the rest of their equipment,
it had been left piecemeal in the desert.</p>

<p>It is distressing to think that all this suffering and labour
should not have been adequately rewarded. Warburton got into a
strip of desert country, but apparently was too much occupied with
pressing straight through to devote any time to examine any country
beyond his track. Whatever may have been the aridity, the water
supply must have been ample to support such large numbers of
natives as he came in contact with. In one camp there were numbers
of women and children and one cripple; but they quietly vacated the
well when the whites came, without any apparent difficulty, showing
that they had other resources within easy reach.</p>

<p>This trip of Warburton's, and a succeeding one by Mr. Ernest
Giles, prove conclusively that the possession of camels leads men
to push on, eager to be able to say that they were the first to get
across, leaving the country almost as unknown as before they
traversed it.</p>

<p>But a few days after Warburton started on his adventurous
journey, Mr. W. C. Gosse, in charge of the Central and Western
Exploring Expedition, left Alice Springs, a telegraph station on
the overland line, with the intention of endeavouring to reach
Perth.</p>

<p>On April 23rd, the leader reports leaving the Springs, with his
party all in good spirits; beside the white men, there were three
Afghan camel-drivers, and the party had a mixed equipment of camels
and horses. On May 1st, they left the telegraph line, and, turning
to the westward, soon found themselves in excessively dry
country.</p>

<p>On the 14th, he had a trip lasting fifty-two hours, without
water for the horses, and one of them died; this happened whilst on
an excursion ahead with his brother, who was acting as collector to
the party.</p>

<p>Having formed a depôt, and sunk a well on a creek he named the
Landor, he made several short trips in different directions, and on
the 21St, in a creek he called the Warburton, found a considerable
pool of water, to which he shifted his main camp.</p>

<p>During one of his excursions from this second depôt, he had the
singular experience of riding all day through the heavy rain and
camping at night without water, the sandy soil having absorbed the
rain as quickly as it fell. On his return he found that the creek
at his camp was running, and the Afghans had made repeated attempts
to cross one of the camels, but the animal obstinately refused to
do so, which, probably, made the leader reflect that it was just as
well they were not likely to meet with many running streams.</p>

<p>On June 6th, Major Warburton's tracks were seen, and a camp of
his found. The next depôt formed was at the western extremity of
the Macdonnell Range, at the foot of a hill named by Ernest Giles,
Mount Liebig. From this depôt the party moved to the spot named by
the same explorer, Glen Edith, and on their way augmented their
live stock by picking up three bullocks that had been lost from
Alice Springs, and apparently had started on an exploring trip by
themselves. From King's Creek, their next depôt, the leader made a
long excursion to the south-west, and at eighty-four miles, after
passing over sandhills and spinifex country, came in sight of a
hill, which, on a nearer approach, proved to be of very singular
limestone formation.</p>

<blockquote>"When I got clear of the sandhills, and was only two
miles distant, and the hill, for the first time coming fairly in
view, what was my astonishment to find it was one immense rock
rising abruptly from the plain; the holes I had noticed were caused
by the water in some places forming immense caves. I rode round the
foot of the rock in search of a place to ascend, and found a
waterhole on the south side, near which I made an attempt to reach
the top, but found it hopeless. Continued along to the west, and
discovered a strong spring coming from the centre of the rock, and
pouring down some large deep gullies to the foot.<br>
<br>
"This seems to be a favourite resort of the natives in the wet
season, judging from the numerous camps in every cave. These caves
are formed by large pieces breaking off the main rock and falling
to the foot. The blacks made holes under them, and the heat of
their fires causes the rock to shell off, forming large arches.
They amuse themselves covering these with all sorts of
devices&mdash;some of snakes very cleverly done, others of two
hearts joined together; and in one I noticed a drawing of a creek,
with an emu track going along the centre."</blockquote>

<p>On the return journey, he crossed an arm of Lake Amadeus, and on
reaching his camp, the whole party started for Ayer's Rock, which
was the name Gosse gave to the singular hill he had discovered,
where they arrived safely, and one of the exploring bullocks was
converted into beef.</p>

<p>Rain having set in heavily for some days, he was enabled to
penetrate some distance westward, where he came upon very good
grazing country, but soon got beyond the extent of the rainfall.
After many more attempts, Gosse found himself obliged to turn back,
the heat of the weather and the dryness of the country&mdash;for
they were now in the sandhill region-rendering it almost useless
for him to think of risking his party with any hope of success.</p>

<p>On the 22nd September, he left his fourteenth depôt in the
Cavenagh Range, and started on his return. His course home was by
way of the Musgrave Ranges, where he found a greater extent of good
pastoral country than he anticipated. He discovered and christened
the Marryat and the Alberga, which last river they followed down
almost to the telegraph line, and arrived at Charlotte Waters in
December.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse's exploration did not add much fresh information to
what was already known of the district, but it extended the area of
explored country, and he was enabled to correctly lay down many of
the points discovered by Mr. Giles.</p>

<p>In March, 1874, Mr. Ross and his son, with a well-equipped
party, consisting of another European and three Arabs, having with
them sixteen camels and fourteen horses, started from the
neighbourhood of the Peake Station, on the telegraph line, to
endeavour to bridge the desert. He was, however, compelled to
return, although he made another effort, after reducing the number
of his party.</p>

<p>Colonel Warburton having been the first to successfully make his
way from the South Australian border to the settled part of Western
Australia, Forrest was the next to aim and arrive at a successful
issue.</p>

<p>Forrest's trip was certainly the most commendable of the two,
and by far the most important in its results. Warburton, with a
troop of camels, reached the Oakover River naked and starving, with
but two miserable animals left. Forrest, with nothing but ordinary
pack-horses, crossed the middle of the continent, where the very
heart of the terrible desert was supposed to exist, and took his
men and most of his horses through in safety.</p>

<p>Forrest, having with him his brother, Alexander Forrest, two
white men, and two natives, left Yuin, then the furthest outside
station on the Murchison, on the 14th of April. Their course at
first was along the upper part of the Murchison River, which he
describes as running through fine grassy flats, good loamy soil,
with white gums in bed and on flats, the water in some of the pools
being rather brackish. This description of country continued for
many days, some of the river water being at times quite salt. On
nearing the head of the Gascoyne River, the land was found to be
fine, undulating downs, admirably adapted for sheep or cattle.</p>

<p>On the 21st May, they ascended the watershed of the Murchison,
and from the top had a fine view of their future travelling ground
to the eastward. The country appeared level, with low ranges, but
there was an absence of conspicuous hills&mdash;not a promising
country for water, but looking as though good feed would be
obtainable.</p>

<p>For the next few days the party were dependent on springs and
small clay-pans. On the 27th when following down a creek, which was
called Kennedy Creek after one of the party, they arrived at a fine
permanent spring, which Forrest characterised as the best he had
ever seen, the grass and herbage around being of an equally
satisfactory description. The springs were named the Windich
Springs after the black boy, Tommy Windich, who had been with
Forrest on three expeditions. To the northwest there was a fine
range of hills, which was named the Carnarvon Range.</p>

<p>The explorers now got into less attractive country, the spinifex
sandhills began to become a familiar feature, and the water supply
less to be depended on.</p>

<p>On the 2nd June, Forrest made his next important discovery of
the Weld Springs, which he describes as unlimited in supply, clear,
fresh, and running down the gully wherein it was situated for over
twenty chains. Here they settled down to give their tired horses a
week's rest.</p>

<p>On the 8th, he started with one boy, to look for water ahead,
leaving instructions for the party to follow on their tracks in a
day's time. He was unfortunate; the two travelled for twenty miles
over undulating sandhills covered with spinifex without seeing a
sign of water. At daybreak from the top of a low, stony rise the
view was gloomy in the extreme. Far to the north and east it was
all spinifex country with no appearance of hills or watercourse, in
fact a barren worthless desert.</p>

<p>Turning back they met the remainder of the party about twenty
miles from the spring, and the whole party retreated to their
former encampment, and after a day's rest Alexander Forrest and a
black boy started for a trip to the south-east in search of
water.</p>

<p>During their absence the natives made an unexpected attack on
the camp. At about one o'clock about sixty or seventy natives
appeared on the brow of the hill overlooking Weld Springs, plumed
and armed with spears and shields. They descended the rise and
attempted to rush the camp, but were met with a volley from the
whites who were prepared to receive them. They retired to the top
of the hill, and after a consultation made a second attack, but
were checked by a rifle shot from the leader. This put an end to
the assault. That evening Alexander Forrest and the boy returned,
and were much astonished to hear of the day's adventure. They had
been over fifty miles from camp, had passed over some good feeding
country, but had found no water.</p>

<p>They now set to work and built a rough hut of stone, in order to
ensure safety during the night, as their stay at Weld Springs
seemed likely to be indefinite, and a fresh attack might be made at
any moment. When the hut was finished, Forrest, taking a boy with
him, started on a flying trip due east. This time they were
fortunate enough to find a small supply in some clay waterholes,
and the whole party shifted camp to it.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the leader made another search ahead, and in thirty
miles came to a fine supply of water in a gully running through a
grassy plain, whereon there was abundant feed. Eight miles to the
south there was a small salt lake, which was named Lake Augusta.
Another good spring in grassy country was also found, and on the
30th June, Forrest made a further exploration ahead to the
eastward. This time he was unfortunate, for he soon found himself
fairly in the spinifex desert, and his horses knocked up. By the
aid of scanty pools of rainwater in the rocks he managed to push on
some distance, walking most of the way. He reached a range, and
from the top had an extensive but most discouraging view. Far to
the north and east the horizon was as level and uniform as the sea;
spinifex everywhere; neither hills nor ranges could be seen for a
distance of quite thirty miles.</p>

<p>He was now perplexed as to his future movements. The main party
were following up his tracks, and there seemed no prospect of
getting through the country ahead of them. Fortunately they found a
little water, enough to last a day or two, and there awaited the
arrival of their companions.</p>

<p>A search amongst the low ranges was then commenced, as the only
other alternative was a retreat of seventy miles. To the great
relief of every one A. Forrest and the black boy found water five
miles to the south-east, with some coarse rough grass around it,
that would serve them for a time. The younger Forrest then went
ahead, and found some springs twenty-five miles distant, which were
named the Alexander Springs, after the discoverer.</p>

<p>Another excursion was attended with equally good results as
regards water, although the country around was not at all desirable
pasture land; and. this brought the explorers within one hundred
miles of Gosse's furthest westerly point. To bridge this hundred
miles proved a weary task. Repeated excursions only resulted in
continued disappointment, and knocked up horses. At last a kindly
shower of rain filled some rock holes to the north-cast of their
camp, and after much labour and exertion the whole party found
themselves at an old camp of Giles, which he had named Fort
Mueller, and as they were also on Gosse's tracks the leader was
able to congratulate himself upon the successful accomplishment of
his mission.</p>

<p>As the course of party, from here to the telegraph line, was
more or less on the track pursued by Gosse, it is unnecessary to
follow their fortunes any further; some privation had to be endured
and one or two more of the horses gave in; but on Sunday, the 27th
September, they arrived at the telegraph line some distance north
of the Peake station, thus concluding one of the most valuable
journeys on record.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the station, Forrest learned that Giles and
Ross had both been turned back by the inhospitable country that he
had successfully traversed. The leader and his companions received
great applause for the work they had so well performed, and it at
once placed Forrest in the front rank of explorers. The fact of his
having got through with but the simple and ordinary outfit showed
that he possessed high qualities of foresight and judgment, and the
many minor excursions he made on the way over, although, perhaps,
wearisome and distressing at the time, led to his having a perfect
acquaintance of the country through which he had travelled.</p>

<p>Ernest Giles, after being driven back twice in his attempts to
reach Western Australia, was now equipped with a troop of camels by
Sir Thomas Elder, and made a third and successful effort. The party
started from Beltana and travelled to Youldeh, where a depôt was
formed. From here they shifted north to a native well, called by
the natives Oaldabinna. The water supply at this place proving but
scanty, Giles started to the westward on a search for more, sending
Messrs. Tietkins and Young to the north on a similar errand. The
leader travelled for one hundred and fifty miles through scrub, and
past dry salt lakes, until he came to a native well or dam, with a
small supply of water in it. Beyond this he went another thirty
miles, but found himself once more amongst saline flats and scrubs;
he therefore returned to the depôt. Messrs. Tietkins and Young had
not been as successful, having found no water. At their furthest
point they had come upon a large number of natives, who, after
decamping in a terrified manner, returned fully armed and painted.
No attempts of the two white men to establish friendly
communications and obtain information succeeded, and they were
obliged to return disappointed.</p>

<p>A slight shower of rain having replenished the well they were
camped at., Giles determined on making a bold push to the west, and
trusting to the hardihood of his camels to carry him on to
water.</p>

<p>On reaching the dam that he had formerly visited, he was
agreeably surprised to find that it had been replenished by the
late rains, and now contained plenty of water for their wants.
There was excellent feed around this oasis, and they rested until
the water gave signs of diminishing.</p>

<p>At the end of a week, on the 16th September, 1875, they again
closed with the desert surrounding them. For the first six days of
their march they passed through scrubs of oak, mulga, and
sandalwood; then they entered upon vast plains, which were
well-grassed, and had saltbush and other edible shrubs growing on
them. After crossing these endless downs for five days, they again
reentered scrub, but of a more open nature than formerly.</p>

<p>When two hundred and forty-two miles had been covered, Giles
distributed what water he had amongst his camels, which amounted to
four gallons each. The next change that occurred in the country was
the reappearance of sandhills, blacks' tracks became plentiful, and
smoke was occasionally seen.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth day, when more than three hundred miles had
been travelled, Mr. Tietkins, who judged by the appearance of the
sandhills that there was water in the neighbourhood, sent the black
boy, Tommy, on to a ridge lying to the south of their course..
Fortunate it was that he did so, for behind it, in a hollow
surrounded by sandhills, lay a tiny lake, which the cavalcade was
passing by unknowingly until Tommy arrested their progress with
frantic yells and shouts. Giles gave this place of succour the name
of Victoria Springs, and rested there nine days.</p>

<p>Recruited and strengthened, a fresh start was made and they soon
got amongst the peculiar features common to the southern interior
of Western Australia, outcrops of granite boulders, salt lakes and
swamps.</p>

<p>In one of these lakes they got their leading camels bogged, and
it was only after hard work and much patience that they got them
out again. Their next relief was at a native well two hundred miles
from Victoria Springs, and here they once more rested from their
weary and long-continued march.</p>

<p>The monotony of their life was, however, rudely broken up at
this encampment by the blacks. During their stay several natives
had made their appearance, and had been kindly received and
treated. No suspicions of treachery were aroused, and the explorers
were just concluding their evening meal when Young caught sight of
a body of armed men approaching, and gave the alarm in time for the
whites to stand to their weapons. Giles says in his journal that
they were a "drilled and perfectly organized force," if so, they
must have been a higher class of natives than the usual type of
blackfellows, whose proceedings, as a rule, have little
organization about them. A discharge from the whites was in time to
check them before any spears were thrown, otherwise, from the
number of their assailants and the method of their attack, it was
probable that the whole party would have been murdered.</p>

<p>On leaving this camp the caravan travelled through dense scrubs,
with occasional hills and open patches; in fact, the country that
has of necessity been so often described in these pages. They were
fortunate enough to find some native wells on their route, and on
the 4th of November arrived at an outside sheep station.</p>

<p>The result of this trip, satisfactory as it no doubt was to the
leader, who thus saw his many gallant efforts at last crowned with
success, had little or no other fruits to show, not even the
negative one of proving that the desert they had passed through was
an absolutely waterless waste. The very water that saved their
lives they were passing by unheeded; and it was impossible for them
to say whether similar formations did not exist on either hand of
their line of march.</p>

<p>Like Warburton's, only without the suffering from starvation, it
was a hasty flight on camels, through an unknown country, and, like
his, barren of results beyond a thin line on the map of
Australia.</p>

<p>Expeditions such as these must be looked at from two points of
view; whilst admiring the fortitude and resolution possessed by the
leader who takes his party through such a waste in safety, we must
regret that fuller information and more patient deductions had not
been gained. The fact of having the means, in their camels, to
venture on long dry stages with impunity, led them to disdain the
careful manner in which Forrest felt his way across; but in the end
that explorer had certainly the best idea of the country he had
travelled over.</p>

<p>Giles now retraced his steps from Western Australia to the
overland line, following a track to the north of Forrest's route.
He went by way of the Murchison, and crossed over to the Ashburton,
which river he followed up to the head. Then striking to the south
of east he came on to his former track of 1873, at the Alfred and
Marie Range; the range he had so vainly striven to reach when the
unfortunate man Gibson, met his death. He finally arrived at the
Peake station, on the telegraph line.</p>

<p>Few watercourses were crossed, the country was suffering from
extreme drought, and no discoveries of any importance were
made.</p>

<p>The journeys of the late explorers had greatly lessened the area
of the country in which fresh discoveries could be looked for;
true, the results had not been encouraging. The utter and complete
want of a river system, even of the rudest kind, in the western
half of the interior of Australia, was plainly shown. No continuous
line of country could even be traced as corresponding on the routes
of the different travellers, and unfortunately, where good country
was found, the want of surface water held out no encouragement for
the grazier to follow up the explorers' footsteps. The reclamation
of this country it was evident would have to be a work of time, and
would be dependent greatly on the facility with which the
underground supplies could be tapped. That these supplies exist,
the pioneer work carried on, on the outskirts of the desert, has
proved beyond a doubt; how far they will be carried into the
interior remains to be seen.</p>

<p>But although the country to the east of the telegraph line had
up to the year 1874 received such a large share of attention, in
fact, the principal share, there yet remained much unknown
territory to investigate, and many geographical problems to
determine. Chief amongst these was the definition of the many
affluents of Lake Eyre.</p>

<p>The western district of Queensland was drained by rivers of
great magnitude, that found their way through South Australia into
the lake; but their many channels, and the direction and size of
them had never been fully determined. To further this end, Sir
Thomas Elder equipped Mr. Lewis, who, it will be remembered, did
such good service on Colonel Warburton's expedition, and under his
leadership an expedition was undertaken which resulted in much
valuable information being gained. Starting from the overland
telegraph line, Lewis skirted Lake Eyre to the north, and
penetrated to Eyre's Creek, in Queensland territory, and traced
that creek and the Diamantina into Lake Eyre; also confirming the
opinion so often advanced that the waters of Cooper's Creek found
their way into that receptacle, as well as the more westerly
streams.</p>

<p>In Queensland the Government had decided upon further
exploration of the northern promontory ending in Cape York. More
than eight years had elapsed since the Jardines had made their
dashing trip, and their report taken in conjunction with Kennedy's
did not offer much inducement for anyone to follow up their
footsteps; but as there was yet a tract of country at the base of
the promontory comparatively unknown, a party was organised and
placed under the leadership of Mr. William Hann, one of the pioneer
squatters of the north of Queensland.</p>

<p>The object of the trip was in the main an examination of the
country as far north as the 14th parallel, with a special view to
its mineral and other resources; the discovery of gold so far north
in Queensland having caused a hope to be entertained that its
existence would continue along the promontory.</p>

<p>Hann had with him as geologist a Mr. Taylor, and as botanist,
Dr. Tate, a survivor of the melancholy New Guinea expedition that
left Sydney in the brig <i>Maria</i>, only to suffer wreck on the
Barrier Reef, where, in the sea and amongst the cannibals north of
Rockingham Bay, most of the unfortunates left their bones.
Apparently, his ardour for exploration had not been damped by his
narrow escape.</p>

<p>One other member of the party, a Mr. Nation, was destined to
meet a tragic death by starvation in the newly-settled district of
the northern territory of South Australia. The party left
Fossilbrook station, on Fossilbrook Creek, a tributary of the Lynd,
which would be north of the starting point of the Jardines.</p>

<p>On leaving this creek they passed over much rugged and broken
country, the scene of Leichhardt's first trip, and a spot which
presented many indications of being auriferous. Here they devoted
some days unsuccessfully to prospecting, and on resuming their
northern journey came to a large river, which was named the Tate.
Four days afterwards another one was struck, which received the
name of the Walsh.</p>

<p>From the Walsh the party crossed to the upper part of the
Mitchell River, and thence to a creek marked on Kennedy's map as
"creek ninety yards wide," which was called the Palmer, and here
Warner, the surveyor, found prospects of gold. Some further
examination of the river resulted in likely-looking results being
obtained, and the find is now a matter of history, verified by the
discovery of one of the richest goldfields in Queensland on the
waters of this river.</p>

<p>Above the Palmer, Hann came across a memorial of the trip of the
Jardines in the tracks of some (or descendants) of the cattle,
dropped by them, but he was unable to find them. This was on a
creek which, he supposed, to be the one named by them the
Kendall.</p>

<p>These animals had, no doubt, led a rather harassed life from the
natives since they had last been seen by the whites.</p>

<p>On the 1st September, Hann reached his northern limit, the 14th
parallel of latitude, and the next day commenced the ascent of the
dividing range between eastern and western waters. A few days
afterwards he sighted the sea, at Princess Charlotte's Bay.</p>

<p>From this point the party turned south, and soon came to a large
river, which was named the Normanby, and here a slight skirmish
occurred with the natives, with whom they had hitherto been on
friendly terms. Whilst the men were collecting the horses in the
morning, and not suspecting treachery, a body of blacks attempted
to cut them off, each native being well armed with a bundle of
spears. A few shots, however, at long distance were sufficient to
disperse them, so that, fortunately, the affair ended without
bloodshed.</p>

<p>On the 21st September, Hann came to the Endeavour, a river
well-known in the history of Australia. Whilst entangled in the
scrub on the upper reaches of this stream he had the misfortune to
lose one of his best horses by poison, two others having also eaten
of the weed.</p>

<p>At this point the party had terrible work to encounter; the old
obstacles that had so retarded Kennedy were met with&mdash;scrub
impenetrable, and steep ravines. Tracks had to be cut through the
vines, and the horses led on foot down perilous descents. This went
on for days, and an attempt to reach the sea coast and continue
their intended route south, ended in involving them in a perfect
sea of scrub, and the final conclusion that advance for white men
and horses was impossible. Hann had reluctantly to make up his mind
to return to the west, and abandon the fresh ground to the south of
him.</p>

<p>After many entanglements in the ranges, and the usual confusion
arising from the tortuous courses of the rivers, the watershed was
at last crossed, and on the 28th October they camped once more on
the Palmer River. From here they returned over the country formerly
traversed on the outward course, and exploring came to an end.</p>

<p>The work had been very hard, especially during the time the
party had been impeded in the scrubs of the east coast, which fully
bore out the reports of the survivors of Kennedy's expedition as to
the terribly toilsome nature of the labour to be undergone in
cutting a track through them. Hann was lucky in not having his
party attacked by sickness during his detention in such a dangerous
locality; they all returned in safety.</p>

<p>The gold discoveries on the Palmer, and the rush there which
occurred soon after this expedition, led to a vast deal of
exploration being done under the name of prospecting. Small parties
were out in all directions on the rivers named and crossed by Hann
and the heads of those named by Leichhardt, the Lynd and the
Gilbert, were ransacked and searched in every direction.</p>

<p>In 1875, the Queensland Government decided to send out an
expedition to decide upon the amount of pastoral country existing
to the westward of the Diamantina River, and see if it extended to
the boundary of the colony. It was placed under the command of W.
O. Hodgkinson, who had already seen considerable experience as an
explorer, having been one of the members of the Burke and Wills
party, and also a member of M'Kinlay's expedition when he traversed
the continent. The second in charge was a mining surveyor and
mineralogist, Mr. E. A. Kayzer.</p>

<p>Although the expedition was organised as early as September, it
was not thought politic to start so soon before the impending wet
season, so the party were directed to muster at the Etheridge
(goldfield), and occupy the time between then and the end of the
year, in examining and reporting on the country between there and
Cloncurry gold-field, on the Cloncurry River, which was to be the
final point of departure.</p>

<p>After some minor excursions in the neighbourhood of the
Cloncurry, Hodgkinson and party left that place in May, 1876, and
proceeded across the dividing watershed to the Diamantina River,
and followed that river down to below the boundary of the colony of
Queensland and South Australia, where it received the name of the
Everett, from Lewis.</p>

<p>This much of the progress of the North West Expedition, as it
was called, included little country not already known, and,
moreover, at this time the district was being settled on in all
parts by the pioneer squatters, the tracks of whose cattle were now
up and down the whole length of the river.</p>

<p>From the lower Diamantina, Hodgkinson made west towards the
boundary of the colony, and beyond Eyre's Creek found a fine
watercourse running through good pastoral country, which he branded
with the name of the Mulligan River. Following this river up, and
finding it alternately well and poorly watered, the party crossed
from the head of it on to the Herbert, unwitting that they had done
so, and followed that river on until they overtook Buchanan,
Landsborough's old companion, who, with a mob of cattle, was
re-stocking the Herbert.</p>

<p>As this country had been at one time stocked, and stations
formed and abandoned, exploration may be considered to have ceased.
The surveys of Messrs. Scarr and Jopp soon explained the mistake
fallen into by Hodgkinson as to the identity of Landsborough's
Herbert and his own Mulligan. It will be remembered that in the
central districts, the watersheds are so low and the size of the
rivers so uncertain, that to find a watercourse dwindle away into
nothing in one mile, and expand into a river the next is not at all
surprising, so that to leave the head of a river and come on to
another running in the same direction, it would appear quite
feasible that it was the same river re-formed.</p>

<p>This was the last exploring expedition sent out by the
Queensland Government; their colony being now nearly entirely
known, and in fact the earlier squatters of the Herbert, before its
abandonment in 1874, were settled some distance across into South
Australian territory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the commercial depression of 1871 and 1872 led to
the stations on the Herbert being thrown up, and the country, good
as it was, lapsed into its original state of loneliness, and
remained for many years quite unoccupied.</p>

<p>Although Queensland herself had little or no territory within
her own borders left to explore, the energy and enterprise of her
pioneers led to many private explorations being organized across
the border into the colony of South Australia, or rather into the
northern territory of that colony. Amongst those undertaken in the
year 1878 may be instanced one which resulted in the loss of the
entire party.</p>

<p>Induced by the favourable terms offered by the South Australian
Government to pastoral lessees in the Northern Territory, two
brothers named Prout started out with one man, looking for country
across the Queensland border. They never returned, and it was not
until they had been given up for months that some of their horses,
and finally the bones of one of the brothers, were discovered by
Mr. W. J. H. Carr Boyd.</p>

<p>It was evident, from the fragments of a diary recovered, that
they had extended their researches far into South Australian
territory, and met their death by thirst on their homeward way,
probably from some of the waters they depended upon for their
return having failed them.</p>

<p>In the same year Buchanan made an excursion to the overland line
from the border of Queensland. Crossing from the Ranken&mdash;one
of the main heads of the Georgina River, and so called after one of
the pioneers of that district, J. C. L. Ranken&mdash;Buchanan on a
westerly course, came to the head of a creek, running through fine
open downs; following it down for some days he eventually lost its
channel in flooded country, and striking across a belt of dry
country arrived at Tennant's Creek station on the overland line.
This creek, which received the name of Buchanan's Creek, was a most
important discovery, affording in future a highway and stock route
to the great pastoral district lying between the Queensland border
and the overland line.</p>

<p>The next to attack this unknown strip was Frank Scarr, a
Queensland surveyor. He tried to cross the line, to the south of
Buchanan's track, but was prevented by the waterless belt of
country existing there. During one of his excursions he found the
horses of the ill-fated Prout Brothers, already alluded to.</p>

<p>Finding he could not reach the country he desired to, from the
Queensland border, Scarr made north, and by means of Buchanan's
Creek arrived at Tennant's Creek station; but owing to the dry
season, did not extend his researches further.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1878, a project for an overland railway line,
between Brisbane and Port Darwin, was inaugurated in the former
city. The principle of building the line by means of land grants
being one of the chief features of the scheme. Mr. Gresley Lukin,
the then proprietor of the leading Brisbane newspaper, organised
and equipped a party to explore a line of country, the object being
to find out the nature and value of the land in the neighbourhood
of the proposed line, and the geographical features of the
unexplored portion.</p>

<p>The party left Blackall, then the furthest township to the
westward in Queensland, the leader being Mr. E. Favenc, accompanied
by Messrs. S. G. Briggs (surveyor), G. R. Hedley, and a black
boy.</p>

<p>From Blackall the party struck across the settled pastoral
districts until they arrived at Cork station, on the Diamantina.
From there they kept a north-westerly route through the then
unexplored country lying between the Burke and Herbert Rivers. From
the Herbert the Ranken was followed up for some distance, and the
route was then to Buchanan's Creek, and down that creek to the last
permanent water. From here the party struck north, and some
permanent waters were discovered, amongst them being the Corella
Lagoon, the finest lagoon in that district. Two lakes of large
extent were also seen and named, but, although at the time of the
explorer's visit they were extensive sheets of water, seven or
eight miles in circumference, they were so shallow for a mile from
their shores, that at that distance, they were only knee deep.</p>

<p>A singular feature of the lakes of this depressed region, was
the fringe of dead trees that surrounded them. From the age of the
trees, and even borders of all the lake beds seen, both dry and
full, it was evident that this must have been the result of an
excessive flood, which had inundated this district during some past
year.</p>

<p>From the Corella Lagoon, where some two or three hundred natives
were assembled to celebrate the peculiar tribal rites common to
that religion, and which have never been witnessed by whites, the
expedition proceeded north, and discovered a large creek running
from east to west, which received the name of Cresswell Creek. This
creek, which ran through fine, open downs, was followed until its
course was lost in the flooded country, which is the end of most
inland creeks.</p>

<p>The last permanent water on it was named the Adder Waterholes,
on account of the number of death-adders killed there. The first
excursion from there towards the telegraph line, some ninety miles
away, resulted, in such days of heat, in conjunction with cracked
and fissured plains, that three horses died before returning to
camp. The country was soft, and full of holes and hollows, and it
being the height of summer, the horses could not travel long stages
without water; so there was nothing to do but await at the Adder
Waterholes the falling of a kindly thunderstorm, to assist them to
bridge the gap that lay between them and the telegraph line.</p>

<p>During their detention at this camp many excursions were made,
and the country traversed found to be mostly richly grassed downs;
and where flooded country was crossed numbers of the dry beds of
former lakes, surrounded by the customary belt of dead forest were
noticed.</p>

<p>The long delay exhausted the supply of rations, but by means of
game, horse-flesh, and the usual bush vegetable, "bluebush and
pig-weed," the party fared sufficiently well.</p>

<blockquote>"We made up a list of game that had already been shot
for ration purposes, nearly all by Hedley, who was our chief
reliance as a hunter, and the following is the account up to 11th
December:&mdash;50 parrots (corellas and galars), 350 ducks (black
ducks, teal, whistling ducks, wood ducks and widgeons), 150 pigeons
(principally flock), 11 geese, 4 turkeys, 8 spoonbills, 7 water
hens, 2 shags, 1 emu, 1 native companion, making a total of 584
birds, and in addition we had consumed 100 fish. All of them were
shot for actual food, nothing. had been wantonly destroyed. We
considerably added to this menu afterwards, including such choice
delicacies as eagle hawk and frogs. Crows and hawks we carefully
reserved to the last when all else should fail. The absence of
kangaroos and other marsupials is a marked feature in this list,
there being none on these wide-stretching downs."</blockquote>

<p>In January, 1879, the thunderstorms set in, and enabled the
explorers to reach the line safely at Powell Creek Station. From
here they travelled over known country to Port Darwin.</p>

<p>This expedition had the effect of opening up a good deal of
pastoral country, which is now nearly all stocked.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the party were most hospitably
received at Palmerston, where the inhabitants, in addition to its
chief feature of a railway survey, saw in this expedition one of
the first steps to open up to the world the vast territory they
possessed; for as yet the pastoral industry had been confined to
one or two spirited attempts in the immediate neighbourhood of the
goldfields, the great tableland at the back whereon there was so
much valuable sheep country being, untouched.</p>

<p>Western Australia now sent out another of the exploring parties,
which form such a feature of her history. In 1879, Alexander
Forrest led an expedition from De Grey River to the telegraph line.
The party left Anderson's Station on the De Grey River, on the 25th
February, and reached Beagle Bay on the 10th April, the country
passed over being like most of the land in the immediate
neighbourhood of the coast, poor and indifferent.</p>

<p>From Beagle Bay they followed the coast round to the Fitzroy
River, which empties into King's Sound, and journeyed up that river
until they reached a range which gave the explorers some trouble;
in fact, they spent six weeks of constant toil and trouble
endeavouring to penetrate it.</p>

<p>On the 2nd June, Forrest bade good-bye to the Fitzroy, which he
calls "the longest and largest river in Western Australia, flowing
through magnificent flats;" and which he says they had then
followed for 240 miles. Leaving the river the party struck north,
looking for a pass through the precipitous bluffs of King Leopold
Range, as it was named. The sea was, however, reached before this
range was surmounted, and following down the angle now being
formed, between the sea and the range, they at last found
themselves enclosed in a perfect prison; romantic and pretty
according to Forrest's description, but rather militating against
their success. Here too the blacks approached them in threatening
numbers, but after the display of a little policy, peace was
preserved. The rugged nature of the country began to tell most
severely on the horses, "how on earth," says Forrest, "they are
going to take us on I really cannot think." On the 22nd June, they
attacked a range, and finally after a steep climb, which witnessed
the death of one of the horses, they reached the height of 800
feet, and camped; here Forrest determined to rest the horses and go
ahead on foot, and explore the country. The result was that they
came upon endless rugged zigzags, which so involved them that they
gave it up in despair and returned to camp.</p>

<p>Forrest had most reluctantly to abandon any idea of crossing
this range and return to the Fitzroy, where they arrived on the 8th
of July. Following up a tributary of this river, the Margaret, they
gradually managed to work round the southern end of the range,
which still frowned defiance at them, and at last reached the
summit of the tableland, and saw before them good grassy hills and
plains. Of this country Forrest speaks most enthusiastically, and
doubtless after their late terrible struggle with the range it must
have appeared a perfect picture of enchantment to them.</p>

<p>On the 24th, they reached a fine river, running strong, and
named by Forrest the Ord, and for a time he followed its course.
Leaving, he continued his way to the overland telegraph line, which
they were destined not to reach without a struggle. More rivers
were crossed, and the country undulated between rough ridges and
well-grassed flats, and at last, on the 18th August, the Victoria
River of Captain Stokes was reached.</p>

<p>Now commenced their first privation for want of water. Their
rations were almost expended, and one of the party seriously ill.
Taking with him one man (Hicks), Forrest started for the line to
obtain succour, leaving his party in camp to await his return.</p>

<p>The first stage was for twenty-nine miles, and then they
fortunately found a small pool; on the next day a stage of
thirty-two miles, through the level, grassy country, timbered with
box and intersected by dry swamps, which is so familiar a feature
in the Northern Territory, but at the end they had to camp without
water. They now had no alternative but to push on to the line at
all risks, as it was the nearest point where they could obtain
supplies, and it was useless to think of going back without them.
Unhappily, Forrest was unprovided with a map of the line, which led
to his having to strike at random; and, as it happened in the end,
resulted in his turning north instead of south, which brought about
needless pain and suffering. Forrest's account of their terrible
trip runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"August 31. An hour before daylight we started,
steering east for fourteen miles before we rested. The country was
similar to that passed over yesterday. During the mid-day halt we
walked about searching for water in the dry swamps, but were
unsuccessful. Here we killed a large snake, and made off it a
miserable meal, thinking that it would relieve our thirst; it made
us, however, a good deal worse than we were before. We had only two
quarts of water with us, and we both decided not to touch this
until reduced to the last extremity, as we knew not how far we
might have to go before coming to water. At one o'clock we were in
the saddle again, and continued on the same course until sundown,
when we gave our horses a short rest. They were very tired, and did
not seem able to keep up, in the state they were, for much longer.
As for ourselves, we were so thirsty we could scarcely speak. We
shot a hawk, and cut his throat in order to drink the blood, but it
did us no good. What would we have given for water? No one can have
an idea what thirst is unless he has experienced it under tropical
heat...After eating our hawk we saddled up, and steered
east-north-east for two miles, when we reached a creek trending
northwest. We thought there might be water in it lower down, so we
followed it for a mile or two, when the horse I was riding knocked
up, and by lying down compelled us to halt."</blockquote>

<p>Forrest now decided to leave the creek, and walk all night,
leading their worn out horses. Fortunately for them they had not
far to go; in two miles Hicks called out that the line was in
sight, and forgetting their thirst they cheered lustily. Within a
short distance of where they struck the line, they came to one of
the tanks stationed at intervals for the use of the repairing
parties, and so their thirst was relieved; but owing to taking the
wrong direction, they travelled away from the nearest station, Daly
Waters, and it was four days before they overtook a repairing
party, under Mr. Wood; who provided them with food and fresh horses
to take back succour to their comrades.</p>

<p>Thus ended a most successful trip, as the country found by
Forrest is amongst some of the most valuable in the northern part
of Western Australia, and has since been stocked with both sheep
and cattle, and large mineral wealth has been developed.</p>

<p>The whole of the northern part of the continent of Australia
seemed for a time to suffer from a blight. The tracks of the
explorers appeared to be checked by some fatal influence.</p>

<p>The Victoria that was thought to be such a grand discovery
turned out but an ordinary coast stream, and on its further
investigation to lead to nothing but disappointment. This
deduction, however, under fuller knowledge is gradually departing,
and there is little doubt that the time is not far away when it
will attain its greatest development as a pastoral and mineral
country.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the east and west tracks of tile
Queensland explorers, and of Alexander Forrest did more to throw
open the country than did the north and south one of Stuart,
although that was the most important ever made in the later days of
Australia's history. Stuart showed the feasibility of crossing the
continent in the centre, but even after the telegraph line was
formed on his track, very little was known of the country on either
side. The northern territory had, however, been the scene of many
private expeditions beside those mentioned here. Some years before
Alexander Forrest crossed over, two residents of the Northern
Territory, Phillip Saunders and Adam Johns, accompanied by a third
man, started from Roebourne in Western Australia, and crossed to
the telegraph line successfully. They were prospecting for gold
most of the way, but the line they took was unlucky, as although
they passed through the now well-known Kimberly country, they
failed to obtain anything like satisfactory prospects. They passed
through much good pastoral country, but at that time stock country
was of no value at such a remote distance from settlement.</p>

<p>There now remains but a few more explorations, and those mostly
in the northern part of Australia. Whatever the yet large unknown
tract of country in the interior will show in the future it is
impossible now to do more than conjecture.</p>

<p>In 1884, Mr. Stockdale, who had had considerable experience in
the other colonies, and was an old bushman, started on an
expedition from Cambridge Gulf to explore the country in that
neighbourhood, with a view to settlement. He proceeded there by the
<i>Whampoa</i>, and on the 13th September he landed at the gulf,
with his party of seven men and the necessary horses, this being,
probably, the first landing that had taken place there since the
days of Captain Stokes. Leaving the gulf, and crossing the range
through a natural gap, which was named after the leader, they found
themselves in well-grassed country, with a fine stream of water
running through it. Their next halting-place was at a creek they
called the Birdie, and they now found numerous camps of the
natives, though as yet they did not come into contact with them.
The next creek was named the Patrick, which was followed down for
some distance through very good country. Here commenced the
beginning of the trouble, which. afterwards culminated in a
tragedy, one of the men (Ashton) losing himself, and delaying the
party by having to be sought for. They were now on a river which
was called the Forrest, after the explorer, and here they rested
for the sake of their horses. On leaving it they got into rather
stony country until they arrived at the head of a creek called the
Margaret, where they again rested.</p>

<p>From there they had to face great difficulties in the shape of
mountainous country, the gullies and ravines reminding one of those
described by Grey. On October the 14th, they came to a fine river,
which they named the Lorimer, on which there was a waterfall one
hundred feet high. The large creek next met with was called the
Buchanan.</p>

<p>On the 21st of October a depôt was formed, and the leader, with
three men, went south, for the purpose of making a thorough
inspection of the country, leaving the other men to await his
return, having first taken the precaution to bury the main portion
of their stock of provisions in case of accidents.</p>

<p>On November 2nd they narrowly escaped an encounter with the
natives. By means of a little tact bloodshed was avoided. While
amongst the cliffs they came upon some of the native drawings and
paintings, which have always created so much interest.</p>

<p>On returning to the depôt, after having passed through and
discovered a fine amount of pastoral country, the leader found,
much to his disgust, that the horses he had left to spell there had
been used for kangaroo hunting, and were not in a fit condition to
do much more work. This compelled him to shorten his trip and start
towards the telegraph line.</p>

<p>On getting his party together again, which was a work of some
difficulty, a start was effected in the direction of the Ord River,
and on the road home the unfortunate occurrence happened that
resulted in the death of two of the men, entirely the consequence
of their own headstrong conduct. The account had better be given in
the words of the leader. Speaking of one of the two men, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"He eats very heartily, and so does Ashton, and both
have strong, lusty voices, but seem to have lost all heart, and the
rest of the party are getting discouraged at the many and serious
delays they are causing us. I have used every means to induce them
to rally and pluck up heart, but it seems all to be totally lost
upon them. It is a very trying situation for me, and I trust God
will guide me, and help me to do what is right and just to all I
have in my charge. Mulcahy acknowledged riding horses in depôt out
kangarooing, also to taking apples, biscuits, jam, flour and peas,
and to be unworthy of forgiveness or to remain one of the party. We
all forgave him the wrong he had done us freely and truly.<br>
<br>
"December 17 (Wednesday). Fine morning after very cool night.
Thermometer at daylight, 60 deg. Mulcahy and Ashton both looking
better, but both came to me, and said if I would allow them they
would take three weeks' rations and camp for a spell on the river,
and perhaps I would send help after them. I tried all in my power
to induce them to struggle on a little further, if only as far as
the Wilson River, but could not alter their determination. Called
the rest of the party together, and as they one and all thought it
was best under the circumstances, I had to consent, so, with Mr.
Ricketson's assistance, measured out to them twenty pannikins of
flour, ten of white sugar, ten of peas, fifteen of dried apples,
four pounds of tea, and a tin of preserved meat. Left them two
double-barrel guns, etc., with about one hundred and fifty
cartridges, fish-hooks, and lines, and camped on the Laurence
River. We then packed up the remainder, and with sad hearts bade
them good-bye, and firmly advised them to get either fish or game,
as game is fairly plentiful around them. Ashton and Mulcahy both
expressed a desire to write a few lines in my diary, and, in the
presence of all hands, I allowed them. Ashton also forwarded by me
a note to his aunt in England, but Mulcahy, although I earnestly
desired him to, would not write to either wife or parents, all he
would say being, 'They will see you at no loss, old man.'<br>
<br>
"It is a dreadful state of affairs, the two biggest and strongest
of our party collapsing like this, and has had a very depressing
effect on me, though I must not show it, for fear of causing a
despondent feeling in the others. I do hope we shall now have fair
travelling, and reach Panton and Osman's station, and send back
horses and relief to those left behind. They have had any amount of
provisions, meat excepted sometimes five meals a day, and never
less than three."</blockquote>

<p>The two men were never found, although every endeavour was made
to do so.</p>

<p>Stockdale, not finding Panton and Osman's station, had to leave
some of his men in camp, and, after a hard struggle, reached the
telegraph line with one companion, and sent back relief to the
others, which duly reached them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The whole of the continent being now known, and the mystery of
the interior solved, there remained little more for the explorers
of later years to do, but follow up the course of some tributary,
stream or river, the origin of which, though, perhaps, guessed at,
had never been finally settled, nor had the country drained by them
been mapped or defined.</p>

<p>These explorations, useful though they have been in opening up
fresh tracts of country for the pastoralist, have not the same
amount of interest attaching to them possessed by the earlier
travels. Much of the exploration of the past few years naturally
centres round the northern portion of Australia; there, as the
pioneer pushed out, the unknown parts had to yield up their secret,
and the tracks of Macdowall Stuart were gradually elaborated. The
South Australian Government had made many attempts to reach the
Queensland border from their overland line, but without success. In
1778, they had dispatched two surveyors&mdash;Messrs. Barclay and
Weinnecke&mdash;to proceed in that direction, starting from the
neighbourhood of Alice Springs. Barclay had much dry country to
contend with, and managed to reach close to Scarr's furthest point
when he was making west in the same year, but failed to connect
with the settlements of Queensland. He made no important
discoveries, being amongst the country common to the central
districts of Australia&mdash;alternate desert, and pastoral land,
with few and insignificant watercourses. It being a matter of
moment to settle the position of the border line between the two
colonies, surveyor Weinnecke was again dispatched in 1880 to make
another attempt. By following Scarr's route, via Buchanan's Creek,
he succeeded in reaching the border. He travelled entirely over the
country explored by Queensland parties. In 1883 Favenc traced the
heads of the rivers running into the Gulf of Carpentaria, near the
Queensland border, and in the following year undertook a more
lengthened expedition from the tableland across the coast range to
the mouth of the Macarthur River. The party left the Queensland
border and crossed to the overland telegraph line, traversing
mostly open downs country the whole of the way.</p>

<p>From the northern end of Newcastle Waters a fresh departure was
as made, and the watercourse that supplies these lagoons followed
up for some fifty miles. From there an easterly course was kept,
and after some privation from want of water, reached a creek, which
was christened Relief Creek, and which proved to be one of the head
waters of the Macarthur. A large extent of valuable pastoral
country was found in the basin drained by this river, and many fine
permanent springs discovered. The party followed the river down to
salt water, and returned by another route to Daly Waters telegraph
station.</p>

<p>The South Australian Government soon after sent a survey steamer
to the group called Sir Edward Pellew's Islands, which had not been
visited since the days of Flinders. The mouth of the Macarthur was
found and sounded, and shortly afterwards a township was formed at
the head of navigation. The explorations conducted on this river
led to a good road being formed from the interior tableland to the
coast and the settlement of much new country.</p>

<p>The whole of the territory east of the overland line was now
rapidly becoming settled, and the explorations made by Mr. Macphee
east of Daly Waters may be said to have concluded the list of
expeditions between the overland line and the Queensland
border.</p>

<p>In 1883 the South Australian Government determined to complete
the exploration of Arnheim's Land, and Mr. David Lindsay was
dispatched on the mission. He left Palmerston on the 4th June, and
proceeded, by way of the Katherine, to the country north of the
Roper River. From there they proceeded to Blue Mud Bay, and, on the
way, had a narrow escape from being massacred by the natives, who
speared four horses, and made an attempt to surprise the camp.
Lindsay got entangled in the broken tableland that caused such
trouble to Leichhardt, and, with one misfortune and another, lost a
great number of his horses-in fact, at one time, he anticipated
having to abandon them all, and make his way into the telegraph
station on foot. On the whole, the country passed over was
favourable for settlement; in fact, the flats on some portions of
his course were first-class sugar country.</p>

<p>Another journey was undertaken about this time by Messrs.
O'Donnell and Carr Boyd into Western Australia, starting from the
same place as Lindsay, namely, the Katherine telegraph station. The
expedition succeeded in finding a large amount of pastoral country,
but no new geographical discoveries of any importance were
made.</p>

<p>Meantime, the discovery of gold in the Kimberley district of
Western Australia led to that province being searched by small
prospecting parties, and every creek and watercourse becoming
known. This has left but little of the coastal lands still
unexplored in Australia, and there is scant chance of anything
noticeable being found in the interior beyond what we can fairly
conjecture. The utmost an explorer can now hope to find there is
some permanent lagoon or spring, affording a stand-by for the
pastoralist. No such streams as the Murray or Darling will ever
again gladden the eyes of the traveller in the interior,</p>

<p>The greater part of the territory still left to explore is
situated in one colony&mdash;that of Western Australia, and,
although the interior has been successively crossed by so many
different men, there yet remains a large area which may be called
unknown. Of what the end will be it is hard to say. Shall we find
it bear out the gloomy predictions of Warburton and Giles? or the
more hopeful one of Forest? One thing we do know&mdash;that, year
after year, use is being found for the most repellent country. When
we look back at the verdict pronounced against the interior of
Australia by the early explorers, and how it has been falsified by
time there is ground for hoping that even the most despised
portions of our continent will yet be found available for
something.</p>

<p>That, in spite of the monotony of the Great Plain, it is strange
to note the fascination it has had for many of the most renowned
explorers. Sturt, after being reduced to semi-blindness, found
himself compelled to struggle with the desert once more. Eyre, left
alone in the wilderness, after his awful experience at the head of
the Great Bight, still longed to venture again, and accompanied his
friend Sturt as far as ever his duties permitted him. Leichhardt
died in harness somewhere in Australia, and Kennedy lost his life
in his desire to emulate his former chief, Mitchell. Even the very
sterility of the great solitude seems to have been, in its way, a
lure to drag men back to encounter it once more.</p>

<p>Knowing now as much as we do of the interior, we can hardly help
being amused at the theories propounded in the old days by some of
the earlier travellers. Oxley was, we know, wedded to the idea of
an inland sea. Sturt, too, when he looked on the stony desert, saw
in it but the dry channel of some old ocean current; and Eyre was
convinced that the interior was nothing but a parched and and
desert. One after another, these fallacies were exploded, and now
we find that human and animal life can as easily be adapted to the
central plain as elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the want of knowledge displayed by the natives of anything
beyond their immediate surroundings, was one great difficulty in
the way of the explorers. The blackfellow of Australia seemed to
partake largely of the country he lived in. His whole life was one
fight for existence, and not even the sudden advent of a strange
race could do more than stir him to a languid curiosity. Bounded,
as he always had been, by his surroundings, and never venturing
beyond tribal limits, what information he was able to impart was,
as a rule, meagre and misleading, and without any good result in
the way of assistance to the explorer. True, we find exceptions to
this amongst them; two instances may be quoted as exemplifying two
different phases of the native character. One is a picture from
Sturt's journal, the other from Mitchell.</p>

<p>Sturt and his companions were returning to the depôt from one of
their northern efforts. Suddenly they came across a party of worn
and thirsty natives. What little water the whites had with them
they gave them, but it was only a mouthful a-piece, and the natives
indicating by signs that they were bound for some distant
waterhole, disappeared at a smart trot across the sandhills. They
apparently expressed no surprise at the sudden meeting in the
desert, although they could not have had the slightest conception
of white men before. They seem to have accepted their presence and
the friendly drink of water as only a part of their strange
existence.</p>

<p>Far different was the conduct of the Darling River blacks, who
so resented Mitchell's appearance, that they travelled over some
hundreds of miles to attack him on his second visit. The ingenuity
with which they planned an attack on the party was a rather
remarkable thing in the annals of exploration. Thinking that the
clothing of the whites rendered them secure against spears, two men
were told off for each member of the party, one to hold the victim
whilst the other clubbed him. Fortunately the scheme was fathomed
by one of the lubras with the party; but it showed very deep-seated
animosity and dislike.</p>

<p>The intercourse, then, that the travellers could expect from the
natives was either passive ignorance or violent hostility. On the
few occasions when their services were made use of it amounted only
to finding some scanty well. Again, the nature of the country was
so persistently opposed to all the pre conceived notions that the
first arrivals brought to the country. It would seem but rational
to suppose that a river or creek would ultimately lead to
somewhere, a larger channel, or the sea; but the rivers of the
plain lived and died without any defined end, and to follow their
courses only resulted in disappointment. Add to all this a dry and
hot climate, and we cannot wonder at the slow progress made in the
advance of the first half of the century.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that had fortune turned the prows of the
Dutch vessels on to the north-east coast, instead of the rough and
rugged shores of the west, Australia would have seen settlement
long before the date of Phillip's landing. But the Dutch found no
inducements whatever on the west; their ships were wrecked, their
crews attacked by the natives, and they had great difficulty in
finding fresh water; so that it was little wonder that even their
energy and adventurous spirit recognised but nothing in <i>Terra
Australis</i> to repay them for the trouble of taking possession.
The French, too, saw little in the unclaimed portion of the country
they visited to do more than threaten an occupation, which never
took place, and it is doubtful if the uninviting shores of Botany
Bay would have held out any hope to a body of free immigrants.</p>

<p>In all these halts on the way to colonization, Australia seems
to have borne but the aspect of her interior plains: formidable and
repellent to the intruder. Starting from the south, the first
travellers had to face all the loneliness and sterility of Lake
Torrens and the other salt lakes, and it was many years before it
was found out that beyond existed good habitable country. Eyre and
Sturt both failed in their efforts to penetrate north, and it was
astonishing how easily it was afterwards accomplished by two such
comparatively inexperienced men as Burke and Wills. From the west,
nature was all against the explorer, and it was only after the
discovery of the Ashburton that Forest managed to reach the
overland line, that river having helped him well into the centre of
the colony. From the north, the penetration of the Great Plain was
only attempted once by A. C. Gregory, and then he was repulsed.
From the eastern shore, the steady progress, although not destined
to finally succeed, gradually brought nearly half the continent
under the sway of settlement, and the advance was mainly checked by
the disappointment resulting from Kennedy's examination of the
Barcoo, and its final course into a dreary desert. Of the many
magnificent preparations made, it has not always been the lot of
the best equipped parties to attain the greatest success, few men
started with less outfit than did Macdowall Stuart, when he reached
to and beyond central Mount Stuart; no men ever left better
provided than did Burke and Wills, and their unfortunate death by
starvation is too well known. The equipment of the explorer,
especially as regards the use of camels, has been a matter of much
dispute. M'Kinlay speaks highly in praise of them, Warburton and
Giles both ascribe their safety to having them with them. But
although they have been the means of achieving long stages over dry
country, they are treacherous and dangerous animals to deal with.
And should they make their escape, it would be impossible to
recover them with only horses at command. Then, too, the possession
of camels leads to hasty and hurried examination of country, and
the mere fact of being in command of such means of locomotion
entices a man to push on regardless of caution. M'Kinlay reports
that the camels seem to thrive well on everything, but Warburton
appeared to have great difficulty in obtaining feed for them in the
sandhill country. Be this as it may, they have done good service in
Australia, but it is not evident that they are always of equal
good.</p>

<p>But the time will, without doubt, soon come when camels will no
longer be required, and the scenes of the forced and painful
marches of some of our explorers be watered by the springs now
imprisoned hundreds of feet below the surface. Since these pages
were commenced, one of the strongest outflows in the world has been
struck near the foot of the range in Queensland, some hundreds of
miles back from the central coast, in a place which witnessed the
last expedition of Major Mitchell. This discovery, added to the
many that have preceded it, leads to much thought as to the
probability of future discoveries, and the wonderful springs that
are already known to exist.</p>

<p>"Water! water! everywhere, and not a drop to drink." Although
not absolutely true, in fact, or rather on the surface, this
quotation might be uttered with a strong measure of truth by many a
poor wretch perishing from thirst on a drought-blasted inland
plain, whilst underneath him, at a greater or less distance, run
sunless seas.</p>

<p>Of the magnitude of our great subterranean reservoir who shall
tell? What craft will ever float on its dark surface, under domes
of pendant stalactites, rippling for the first time the ice-cold
waters, and disturbing the eyeless fish in their shadowy haunts?
Only when here and there we tap it, and the mighty pressure sends
up a thin column of water hundreds of feet in answer. Or when we
notice the strong, constant springs that at intervals break through
the surface crust to gladden us; or when the deeper internal fires
burst forth, and hurl up its waters in scathing steam and boiling
mud, can we guess of the great hidden sea beneath.</p>

<p>We have a problem given into our hands to solve; it is our
heritage, and we have only just commenced to try and find the
answer. In our fair continent there are thousands upon thousands of
square miles of fertile country that Nature herself has planned and
mapped out into wide fields, with gentle declivities and slopes,
fit for the reception of the modest channel that shall convey the
living water over the great pasture lands; and now we want the
magician to come, and, with the wand of human skill, bring the
interior waters to the surface, and make the desert blossom.</p>

<p>Of the great supply that lies awaiting us deep down in the
earth's caverns we have incontestible proofs, and of the force
latent in it to lift it to the surface, to be our willing slave and
bondsman, we, too, have some dawning notion. Will years of study
and observation give us the power to wield the wand at will? We
cannot but believe it. Our vast and fertile downs were never
destined to be idle and unproductive for months and months,
dependent only on the niggard clouds o'erhead.</p>

<p>To make Australia the richest and most self-supporting country
that sun ever shone upon, wherein every man could follow out the
old saying of sitting under his own vine and fig tree, what is
wanted? The answer to this problem is to bring to our rich alluvial
surface the waters under the earth.</p>

<p>On the great inland plateau that occupies two-thirds of the
entire continent, we find the soil teeming with elements of
surpassing fertility. Even the grudging rainfall that comes so
seldom has developed a wealth of indigenous herbage, grasses, and
fodder plants unequalled in any other part of the globe. The earth
seems to have put forth every inherent vitalising power it
possesses to render its creatures independent of cruel seasons.</p>

<p>What traveller but has noticed the magical effect of rain upon
the deep friable soil, formed by the denuded limestone rock. Almost
instantaneously fresh life springs up. Within but a short time the
dry and withered stalks of grass assume a deep rich green, the soft
broad leaves and joints are replete with moisture. The bare ground
is quickly coated with trailing vines and creepers, bearing
succulent seed pods, grateful and moist. The rough-coated,
staggering beast that could scarce drag its feeble legs out of the
muddy waterhole, becomes in a few weeks strong and vigorous. What
would not such a land be with a constant fertilizing stream of
water through, and about it?</p>

<p>In approaching the subject of our subterranean water supply, the
peculiar physical formation of Australia must be borne in mind. The
great flat tableland that stretches in almost unvarying monotony
from shore to shore, fringed round with its strip of coastal land,
resembles&mdash;to use a homely simile&mdash;nothing so much as a
narrow brimmed, flat crowned hat. The moisture-laden clouds that
visit us, break on the sides of this hat, giving the brim, or
coast, the full benefit of their precipitation; drifting over the
plateau, or crown, with rapidly decreasing bulk. Thus, the great
plain, in size the greatest, and in soil the richest part of us, is
always labouring under the curse of irregular and inefficient
rainfall; and whatever good we may do in the way of water storage
and we may do so much-we have always the threat of many years of
drought hanging over, during which our treasury of water will be
drained, and not replenished.</p>

<p>Welling from the sides of the tableland we find large permanent
springs, in many cases the sources of fine strong-flowing rivers,
the component parts of whose waters now first see the light again
after countless ages. Storms and floods may come and go unheeded,
their steady flow is-maintained unchecked by summer or winter
weather; for their birth is deep down in the earth, where
meteorological disturbances are unknown. Like an old and battered
tank, through whose cracked and leaky sides the water it contains
is escaping, so these springs find vent through fissures in the
mighty tableland, to flow down to the sea.</p>

<p>Up in the northern provinces where, perhaps, if anything, the
contrast of these flowing streams beneath the parched surroundings
is more striking than in the more temperate southern clime, there
are some mighty leaks in the sides of the tableland. The Gregory
River, in the Burke district of Queensland has one unvarying flow;
a strong running stream, never lessened by the longest drought, but
gliding beneath cool masses of tropical foliage and gurgling over
rocky bars when all around is dry. What a great heritage here runs
to waste unheeded.</p>

<p>In the northern territory, from out another vent, springs the
Flora River, whose waters ripple over limestone bars in miniature
cascades, from pool to pool, like pigmy reproductions of the lost
terraces of New Zealand. Follow the edge of the great tableland
around, and amongst the deep seams and fissures of its abrupt
descent coastward, we suddenly come, midst rugged barreness and
gloomy grandeur, upon these messengers from the inner earth. Some
enjoying the sunlight, but for a brief span, disappearing again for
ever as, suddenly as they were up-borne; others finding their way
down to the habitable lowlands and to the sea. But, unfortunately,
all these springs, some of great volume, find issue on the outer
edge of the range; the gradual descent that marks the inner slope
is not the scene of these outbursts. Here, and throughout the
interior, the waters from below rise in a way that seems to best
befit the weird solitude of the great plain.</p>

<p>At times, on a bare, baked mound elevated above the surface,
there is a dwarf crater filled with water that never overflows, and
when tapped and exhausted, rises once more to its former level.
Again, canopied by giant ti-trees amid the shrill shrieking of
thousands of noisy parrots, the traveller can pick his way along
the treacherous paths that wind amongst the hot springs. Or at the
foot of a low range a scanty trickle fills a rocky pool, and thence
is lost.</p>

<p>In the bed of some far inland creek, the water rises in the sand
in shallow pools, during the dark hours of night, to vanish once
more beneath the sun. And in low caverns in the limestone hills,
down some deep fissure, can be seen the waters of a stream, whose
rise and course no man has ever traced. Again a solitary lagoon is
found whereon no lily grows, and wherein no fish swims. Where the
belated bushman camping for the night, finds the next morning that
the water has sunk many feet, or perhaps has risen, when no rain
has fallen far or near for months. All these signs and tokens from
the great sea beneath us may serve as guides to the end.</p>

<p>When one comes to know the real value of water in a thirsty
land, it almost seems like a crime on the part of Nature, that a
spring should rise and flow for a comparatively short distance, to
be lost in the sea. When by placing the source some fifteen or
twenty miles away the course would run for hundreds of miles
through a dry country. Can human ingenuity improve on nature?</p>

<p>In this case nature seems to have laid the ground work of a
great comprehensive continental plain; to have put the lever ready
for man to start it, and though the scheme is one of such magnitude
that it may at first glance seem widely impossible, there is no
reason, backed as it would be by natural forces, that it may not be
an accomplishment of the future.</p>

<p>To fully understand the great problem of the water supply of
Australia, it is necessary to comprehend and carry in mind the
wonderfully unique river system of the continent. In an average
area of 1,800 miles east and west, by 900 miles north and south,
the whole drainage runs from north to south; that is to say, all
that finds vent in the ocean. This, of course, is the surface
formation carrying off the rainfall, and has no bearing on the
outbreak of subterranean springs. But, as showing the upheaval of
the land to the northward, it points out that naturally the flow of
irrigation on a large scale will be from north to south.</p>

<p>It may be said that from the 18th parallel there is a steady
slope southward, broken only by the subordinate natural features of
the country, which necessarily form the irregularities of the
smaller tributaries. In this great block of more than a million and
a quarter of square miles there are then all. the defined channels
requisite for the carriage of water throughout the heart of the
continent, but with the important fact wanting that they are
destitute of a constant and steady supply from the doubtful
rainfall. The tilt of the northern edge of the plateau puts their
sources above the level of the great springs, and causes them to be
dependent on these intermittent and often scanty rains. And we know
that these rains have failed in producing any comprehendable system
of drainage over one third of our continent, at, least, at present
with our limited knowledge, the water system appears wasteful and
purposeless throughout that region.</p>

<p>If then the underground sea that exists beneath could be, tapped
as far north as possible, the water would rise to the surface at a
much higher level, than would be possible elsewhere, and much
greater use could be made of it, inasmuch as a larger area would
lay below it for fertilization. Now, the question of the existence
of this water supply at a uniform depth beneath the earth's surface
can be proved by noting the existence of the springs that we know
of, that have found their way without artificial aid to the light
of day. Only those can be brought in evidence that are
unmistakeably outside of local influence, and are unaffected by wet
weather, or dry.</p>

<p>In the north, on the edge of the tableland, they are most
numerous. On the east coast, at the head of the Burdekin River,
there are unmistakeable signs of an upward effort of the imprisoned
waters to free themselves. One main tributary, a creek called
Fletcher's Creek, takes its rise in a labyrinth of basaltic rocks,
that for years defied the efforts of the whites to penetrate. This
stream rising from its cradle in the dead lava, winds in and out of
the encompassing stretches of rocks, until it emerges on the outer
country, where it feeds and maintains two large lakes, ere it is
lost in the sandy bed of one of the anabranches of the Burdekin. It
is one of the strongest and most consistent outbreaks in the north,
and its volume and continuance show the strength of the source from
which it emerges.</p>

<p>The head of the Burdekin itself is amongst lava beds, wherein
there are many similar springs; most of these take the form of
permanent lagoons. To the westward we find ourselves on a more arid
surface, the formation of the ranges not being so favourable to the
development of springs; and where they do occur, they are evidently
the product of rainfall. On the watershed we are on a corner, as it
were, of the inland plain, and our ascent has put us above the
spring level. Lower down, if we follow the well-known Flinders
River, we find in the hot springs at Mount Brown another upshoot
from below that has evidently come from the neighbourhood of the
internal fires themselves. From this point right away west,
skirting the edge of the tableland, great rushes of water are
comparatively common. Some find their way between basaltic columns,
and after feeding the flow of some large river for many miles, die
suddenly, leaving the lower part of the watercourse a barren, sandy
channel. The heads of the Leichhardt and Gregory Rivers are
particularly prolific in springs; the latter river, as I have
already noticed, being one of the steadiest flowing rivers in
Australia. Westward still, the heads of all the rivers, no matter
what their lower course is like, abound in springs at the break of
the descent from the tableland, and, as nearly as can be computed,
all these occur at nearly about an identical altitude.</p>

<p>To travel west, through to the western shore of Australia, only
gives us the same phenomena: everywhere the belt of springs is to
be found about half-way between the edge of the tableland and the
coast level, just where the abrupt descent terminates and a gentler
slope is entered on. It would be wearisome to enumerate them all,
the fact of their existence is so well-known in these days.</p>

<p>To fairly see what would be the result of bringing a little of
the great sea of hidden waters to the surface, let us take an
instance of one of the tributaries of that great artery of
Australia, the Darling. The head waters of the Warrego rise in
latitude 24 deg., and at its very head, within almost a stone's
throw, are large springs, that find their way down the range into
the lowest river. Thence, through coastal lands, to the eastern sea
board. Now had these springs broken out on the higher level of the
Warrego watershed, their waters would have benefited hundreds of
miles of some of the fairest country in Australia, that now suffers
under constant drought.</p>

<p>The preserving and regulating of their waters, after guiding
them into the channels prepared by Nature, would be an after-work
greatly assisted by the varied formation of the country through
which their courses would run.</p>

<blockquote>Maritime Discoveries</blockquote>


<p>To exhaustively deal with the early maritime discoveries of this
continent would require from the historian a vast power of
research, and especially of caution, in deciding or allotting to
any one country the priority of position as the "first-finders;"
and while we know of few studies affording more intellectual
pleasure and enjoyment, we doubt if the result would even then set
at rest the mystery which still enshrouds those narratives.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of this work, however, the following
original paper has been considered worthy of attention, as it
presents the most reasonable and logical theory yet put forward for
the right to consider the French as the original discoverers, and
readers will have pleasure in following out the various deductions
as made by one of our fellow-colonists, E. Marin La Meslée, Member
of the Société de Géographie Commerciale de Paris, who has, by
great research, compiled, in the following interesting article, the
evidence relating to the voyage of the old Norman navigator,
Paulmier de Gonneville, in 1503.</p>

<p>Without endorsing what is here put forward, there is much in its
favour, and it shows a considerable degree of keen argument and
cogent reasoning that, in any case, is a valuable contribution to
this department of literature. Moreover, it may be the incentive
for further exploration of the locality mentioned at some future
time, with the view of solving the secrets of the strange carving
and wonderful cave drawings, to which so much interest has been
attracted.</p>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<p>Most of the modern histories of Australia contain, with regard
to the voyage of De Gonneville, the same stereotyped
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"A claim has been set forth on behalf of a certain
French sailor named De Gonneville, who is stated to have landed on
the coast of Australia in 1503, but this claim can easily be
dismissed, as there is little doubt that the country he describes
is no other than the island of Madagascar."</blockquote>

<p>This opinion, so generally entertained by modern writers is
probably based on the authority of Admiral Burney, and the eminent
English geographer, Mr. Major, who, in referring to Burney's
remarks with regard to this voyage in his paper on "Early Voyages
to Terra Australis," printed in 1861, merely endorses this
statement without attempting to discuss it. The voyage of Jean
Binot Paulmier de Gonneville is authenticated, however, beyond the
possibility of a doubt, but the mystery to be cleared up as to what
part of the Austral world the old Norman navigator landed upon
requires careful handling and very close discussion.</p>

<p>De Gonneville left Honfleur in the month of June of the year
1503, in the good ship <i>L'Espoir</i>, and after having rounded
the Cape of Good Hope he was assailed by tempestuous weather and
driven into calm latitudes. After a tedious spell of calm weather,
want of water forced him to make for the first land he could sight.
The flight of some birds coming from the south decided him to run a
course to the southward, and after a few days' sail he landed on
the coast of a large territory, at the mouth of a fine river, which
he compares to the river Orne, at Caen. There he remained for six
months repairing his vessel, and making exploring excursions in the
neighbourhood, holding meanwhile amicable intercourse with the
inhabitants. He left this great Austral Land, to which he gave the
name of "Southern Indies," as being situated, in his estimation,
"not far from the true course to the East Indies," on the 3rd of
July of the year 1504, taking with him two of the natives, one of
whom was the son of the chief of the people among whom he had
resided. On the return voyage no land was seen until the day after
the Feast of St. Denis, <i>i.e.</i>, the 10th of October of the
same year; but on nearing the coast of France the ship was attacked
off tile islands of Guernsey and jersey by an English privateer,
who robbed the navigators of all they brought from the land they
had visited, the most important loss being the journal of the
expedition. On his arrival at Honfleur, De Gonneville immediately
entered a plaint before the Admiralty Court of Normandy, and wrote
a report of his voyage, which was signed by the principal officers
of his vessel.</p>

<p>The following is a translation of the title of this document</p>

<blockquote>"Judicial declaration made before the Admiralty Court
of Normandy by Sieur de Gonneville, at the request of the King's
procurator, respecting the voyage of the good ship <i>L'Espoir</i>,
of the port of Honfleur, to the 'Southern Indies.'"</blockquote>

<p>Extracts from this judicial declaration were published for the
first time in 1663 by the bookseller Cramoisy, who had received
them from a priest named J. B. Paulmier, then Canon of the
Cathedral Church of St. Pierre de Lizieux. The document was
addressed to Pope Alexander VII., and bears the title
of:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Memorial for the establishment of a Christian mission
in the third part of the world, or 'Terre Australe.' Dedicated to
His Holiness Pope Alexander VII., by a priest originating from that
country."</blockquote>

<p>This priest was the direct descendant of one of the
"Australians" (a term used for the first time by De Gonneville
himself in referring to the inhabitants of "Terre Australe"), whom
the Norman captain had brought to France, and to whom at his death
he gave his name and fortune, in his desire to make some atonement
for the wrong which the worthy sailor considered he had inflicted
upon the native by taking him away from his country under a promise
to return, which he was never able to redeem. De Gonneville married
him to one of his relatives, and the priest in question was the
grandson of the "Australian," whose native name was "Essomeric."
Canon Paulmier appears to have been a man of mark in his time,
since he was resident in France as representative of the King of
Denmark. He was also a man of great learning, and Des Brosses
informs us that he had made a particular study of geography and the
history of voyages of discovery, with which he was perfectly
acquainted.</p>

<p>The documents published by Des Brosses were translated and
appeared for the first time in English in a work entitled "Terra
Australis Cognita," by the Scotch geographer, Callender, who, like
Des Brosses, was fully convinced that De Gonneville had landed
somewhere on what is now known as the Australian Continent. This
territory was named by Des Brosses <i>Australasia</i> as far back
as 1761, and was placed to the southward of the Little Moluccas,
where our maps now show the north-western portion of the Australian
Continent. Some English geographers, however, such as Admiral
Burney and Flinders, differ from the conclusions arrived at by both
Des Brosses and Callender. Burney inclines to the belief that the
land visited by De Gonneville could be no other than Madagascar.
After him, Major, than whom no higher or more respected authority
exists in geographical matters of this kind, seems to have too
readily accepted Burney's opinion. Perhaps they each considered the
claim set up on behalf of De Gonneville as based on insufficient
grounds, and were disposed to doubt, in the face of later knowledge
of the natives of Australia, that De Gonneville could possibly have
induced one of his relatives to marry a representative of these
wretched races: and it must be admitted that herein lies the great
stumbling block in the way of fixing the position of the territory
upon which De Gonneville actually landed. It is also probable that
Burney was led to the conclusion that Madagascar was the point
visited by some inaccuracies in Callender's translation with regard
to the kind of head-dress described as worn by the women, which
would certainly appear to refer more to the inhabitants of the
great African island than to the Australians. The mystery is a
difficult one to clear up, but subsequent discoveries, and a closer
scrutiny of the Norman captain's narrative, prove, we think,
clearly that De Gonneville's "Southern Indies" could be no other
than the Australian Continent, and that he landed in reality at the
mouth of some of the rivers on the north-western coast.</p>

<p>In the first place, the judicial declaration cited above, which
had been for more than three centuries and a half mislaid among the
records of the Admiralty of Normandy, was discovered in the year
1873 by the French geographer, Benoit D'Avezac, who published it in
a pamphlet in which he discusses this question, and concludes that
the land visited by De Gonneville must have been some part of South
America. But this official document, which is similar in almost all
points to the memoirs of the priest, Paulmier, and establishes at
once the fidelity of his extracts and the absolute truth of the
voyage of the French captain, does not contain any additional
information which could lead to such conclusion, based only on his
description of the natives of the "Southern Indies." D'Avezac's
contention cannot be sustained, and must give way before the
evidence of other facts; but as the same arguments against his
theory apply also to that of Burney and Major, we need not discuss
it here for the present.</p>

<p>It is, however, necessary, in order that the reader may form a
clear idea of the subject, to quote at length the original memoirs
as published by the worthy priest. As the translation of Callender
is, on the whole, a fairly good one&mdash;although it may be
inferred that the Scotch geographer, who wrote in 1761, was better
acquainted with the pure French of the eighteenth century than with
the quaint terms of the old Norman dialect, in which De
Gonneville's narrative is written&mdash;we shall transcribe here
that portion which bears on the subject, reserving to ourselves the
duty of pointing out the few inaccuracies which may have led Burney
and others to erroneous conclusions.<br></p>

<p>EXTRACT FROM THE MEMOIRS OF J. B. PAULMIER.

<p>"It were to be wished that some better hand than mine were employed
to give an account of these southern regions of the world; but I
cannot, without being wanting to my character, to my birth, and to
my profession, omit doing this duty to the natives of the Southern
World. Soon after the Portuguese had discovered the way to the East
Indies, some French merchants, invited by a prospect of sharing the
gains of this trade, fitted out a ship, which, in its route to the
Indies, being driven from the straight course by a tempest, was
thrown upon this great southern land. The natives of this region
received the French with the most cordial hospitality, and, during
an abode of six months, did them every good office in their power.
The French, willing to bring some of the natives home with them,
prevailed upon the easy credulity of the chief of that nation to
give them one of his sons, promising that they would return him to
his country fully instructed in the European arts, particularly
that of making war, which these Australians desired above all
things. Thus was the Indian brought into France, where he lived
long enough to converse with many who are yet living, and, being
baptised, he received the name and surname of the captain who
brought him over. His godfather, in order to acquit himself in some
degree of what he owed to the Australians, procured him a small
establishment in France, and married him to one of his own
relations. One of the sons of this marriage was my grandfather. The
solemn promise the French had given to the inhabitants to return
him among them, and what I owe to my original country, induces me
to give the following short account of the voyage, compiled from
the memoirs of my own family:&mdash;

<p>"The French having formed the design of following the steps of
Vasco de Gama in the East Indies, equipped a vessel at Honfleur for
that voyage, which, being commanded by the Sieur de Gonneville,
weighed anchor in June, 1503, and, having doubled the Cape of Good
Hope, was attacked by a furious storm, which, driving them far from
their intended course, left them uncertain in what part of the
world they were. Being in want of water, and their ship having
suffered much by storm, the sight of some birds from the south
induced them to hold their course that way, where they soon
discovered a large country, to which they gave the name of Southern
India, according to the usage of those days, when it was customary
to give the name of India to every new discovered country. They
cast anchor in a river, which they say was of the bigness of the
Orne, near Caen. Here they spent six months refitting their ship,
but the crew, being intimidated, obliged Gonneville to return to
France. During his stay in this country he had time to form a most
curious account of the country and the manners of its inhabitants,
which he inserted in his journal; but, unfortunately, being just
off the coast of France, he was taken near the isle of Guernsey by
an English privateer, who robbed him of his journal and everything
he had. On his landing he complained to the Admiralty, and, having
emitted the following judicial declaration, at the request of the
procurator of the King, he inserted it in a short relation of the
discoveries he had made. This public act, authenticated by all the
proper forms, is dated 19th July, 1505, and signed by the principal
officers of the ship. From this the following are
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that during their stay in that country
they conversed in all freedom with the natives, having gained their
goodwill by some trifling presents. That the said Indians were
simple people, leading a careless, easy life, subsisting by hunting
and fishing, and on some roots and herbs which the soil furnishes
spontaneously. Some wear mantles either of skins or of woven mats,
and some of them are made of feathers, like those of the gypsies in
our country, only they are shorter, with a kind of apron girt above
the haunches, which the men wear down to the knee, and the women to
the calf of the leg. The women wear collars made of bones and small
shells. The men have no ornament of this sort, but carry a bow, and
arrows pointed with sharp bones. They have also a sword, made of
very hard wood, burned and sharpened at the end; and these are all
their weapons. The women and girls go bare-headed, with their hair
neatly tied up in tresses mixed with flowers of most beautiful
colours. The men let their hair hang down, but they wear crowns of
feathers, richly coloured.</p>

<p>"They say further, that having gone two days' journey into the
country and along the coasts both to right and left, they found it
very fertile, and full of many birds, beasts, and fish utterly
unknown in Christendom. The late Nicole Le Fevre, of Honfleur, a
volunteer in this voyage, had taken exact draughts of all these
things. But everything was lost, together with the journals of the
voyage when the ship was taken: and this makes their account very
imperfect.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say, further, that the country is not very
populous, the natives living dispersed in villages consisting of
thirty, forty, or eighty huts. Those huts are made of stakes drove
into the ground, the intervals being filled up with herbs and
leaves, and a hole at top to let out the smoke. The doors are
formed of sticks neatly tied together, and are shut with wooden
keepers like those of the stables in Normandy. The beds are made of
soft mats, skins, or feathers. Their household utensils are formed
of wood, even the pots with which they boil water but, to preserve
them from burning, they are laid over with a kind of clay an inch
thick.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that the country is divided into many
cantons, each of which has its king, or chief. These kings are
highly honoured and feared by their subjects, though no better
dressed or lodged than they. They have power of life and death over
the subjects, of which some of the crew saw a memorable example in
the person of a young man of twenty years of age, who, in a fit of
passion, had struck his mother. Though no complaint was made, yet
the king sent for him and ordered him to be thrown into the river
with a large stone tied to his neck, having previously called
together the young men of that and the neighbouring villages to
witness his punishment.</p>

<p>"The name of this king, to whose territory the ship came, was
Arosca. His canton extended a day's journey within land, having
about a dozen villages in it, each of which had its particular
chief, but under Arosca. The said Arosca was, to appearance, about
sixty, then a widower, but had six sons&mdash;from thirty to
fifteen years of age&mdash;who came often to the ship. Arosca was
of middle stature, thick set, of grave but pleasant countenance. He
was then at peace with the neighbouring kings, but they and he were
at war with the people in the inland country, against whom he
marched twice, during the ship's stay there. Each time he had a
body of 500 or 600 men with him, and when he returned the last
time, there were great rejoicings made on account of a victory he
had gained. There was nothing but excursions for a few days, in
which they begged the French to march with them, in hopes of being
assisted by their firearms, but the commander excused himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that there came five of their kings to
see the ship, but they wore nothing to distinguish them but their
plumes of feathers, which, contrary to those of their subjects, was
of one colour. The principal inhabitants wore some feathers of the
colour of the king's mixed with the others. Arosca had his of
green.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that these friendly Indians received them
as angels from Heaven, and were infinitely surprised at the bulk of
the ship, the artillery, mirrors, and other things they saw on
board. Above all, they were astonished at our method of
communicating our thoughts to each other by letters from the ship
to those on shore, not being able to divine how the letter could
speak. For these reasons they greatly feared the French. At the
same time they were so much beloved by them, on account of some
axes, mirrors and knives they gave them, that they were always
ready to do anything in their power to serve the strangers,
bringing them great quantities of flesh and fish, fruits, and other
provisions. Besides which, they brought them large quantities of
skins, feathers, and roots, of dying in different colours, in
exchange for which they received different kinds of hardware of
small price, and thus the French got together above one hundred
quintals of their goods.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that, intending to leave there some
memorial that this country had been visited by Christians, they
erected a large wooden cross, thirty-five feet high, and painted
over, placed on an eminence in view of the sea. This they did with
much ceremony on the Day of Pentecost, 504, the cross being carried
by the captain and his officers, all barefooted, accompanied by the
King Arosca and the principal Indians, after whom followed the
crew, under arms, singing the Litany. These were accompanied by a
crowd of Indians, to whom they gave to understand the meaning of
this ceremony as well as they could. Having set up the cross, they
fired volleys of their cannon and small arms, charging the Indians
to keep carefully and honour the monument they had set up, and
endeavoured to gain them to this by presenting them with a number
of baubles, which, though of small value, were highly prized by
them. On one side of this cross were engraved the name of the Pope
and that of our Sovereign, the name of the Admiral of France, and
those of the captain and all his crew. On the other side appeared
the Latin verses following, made by the above Nicole Le Fevre,
signifying the date of this transaction&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Hic sacra palmarius, post uit gonivillabinotus,<br>
"grex, focius pariterque utraque progenles.</blockquote>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that, having refitted their ship in the
best way they could, they prepared to return to France, and being
willing, after the manner of those who discover strange lands, to
carry some of the natives with them, they persuaded the king,
Arosca, to let them have one of his sons, promising to the father
that they would bring him back in twenty moons at farthest, with
others who should teach them the use of firearms, and how to make
mirrors, axes, knives, and whatever else they admired among the
Christians. These promises determined Arosca to let his son, called
Essomeric, go along with them, to whom he gave for a companion an
Indian of thirty-five years of age, called Namoa. He and his people
convoyed them to the ship, giving them provisions, besides many
beautiful feathers and other rarities, in order to present to the
King of France. At parting, Arosca obliged them to swear that they
would return in twenty moons, and when the ship got under way the
whole people gave a great cry, and, forming the sign of the Cross
with their fingers, gave them to understand that they would
carefully preserve the one set up among them.</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i>. They say that they left this southern country July
3rd, 1504, and saw no land until the day after the Feast of St.
Denis, during which time they were much distressed by a malignant
fever, of which their surgeon and three more died, among whom was
the Indian, Namoa. The young son of Arosca also falling sick, they
baptised him by the name of Binot, after their captain, who stood
godfather to him. This was done September 14th, after which the
young Indian grew better and arrived in France."<br><br></p>

<p>Callender further remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Thus far the judicial declaration emitted by De
Gonneville before the Admiralty. The rest of the author's memoir is
filled with exhortations to the French to profit by this lucky
discovery, and send the writer back to the country of his
ancestors; but this appears never to have been done. The author
seems to have begun this extract from De Gonneville's declaration
in that place where he talks of the manners of the inhabitants,
omitting what went before, though it is highly probable that the
navigator must have said something of the voyage outwards and the
portion of the country where he landed, which would have been of
great importance for us to know at this day. The French writer from
whom we have translated the above account informs us that the Count
de Maurepas caused search lately through all the records of the
Admiralty in Normandy, in order to find the original of this
declaration, but an interval of two centuries and a half, and the
confusions occasioned by the civil wars, had dispersed all the old
papers, and all the information that M. de Maurepas could obtain
was that a tradition still subsisted there that such a piece was
once among the records, but they could give no account of what was
become of it. Thus the full account of an attempt which Magellan
some years after finished with success is entirely lost, except the
very lame extract we have been able to lay before the reader. Our
French author tells us he has seen another copy of this memorial at
the end of the dedication to Pope Alexander VII. The author signs
his name thus, at full length, 'Paulmier, Prêtre Indien Chanoine de
l'Eglise Cathédrale de Lizieux.' The proprietor of this copy has
added a note, testifying that this copy was given him by the author
himself in 1664. He commends him as a person of universal
knowledge, and one who had travelled all over Europe. He had made
the history of navigation his principal study, and was perfectly
acquainted with it. In another note we are told that Essomeric, the
son of Arosca, lived to the year 1583, and left posterity under the
name of Binot. One of his grand-children, J. B. Binot, was
President of the Treasury of Provence, and left an only daughter,
who was m married to the Marquis de la Barbent, May 4th, 1725. Our
readers will not be surprised that we have entered into a detail of
facts in order to elucidate and confirm the truth of this first
discovery of the Terra Australis, especially as this account was
never seen in our language till now, and is therefore little known
even to those who are otherwise well acquainted with voyages made
to this part of the world."</blockquote>

<p>Callender, however, has omitted to translate the remainder of
Des Brosses' account, in which, among other facts, the important
statement is made that the priest Paulmier had become personally
known to M. Flaconet, who met him for the first time at the
residence of the Lord Bishops of Heliopolis and Beryte, where he
often met him in company with M. de Flacourt, who had commanded in
Madagascar, and AI. Fernamel, father of the Superior of the Foreign
Missions. The good abbe was doing all in his power to persuade
these gentlemen to assist in sending a mission to these
Australians, and it also appears that he had communicated his views
on the subject to St. Vincent de Paul, who would have presented his
memorial to the Pope had he not been prevented by death.</p>

<p>Before attempting to fix the position of the country visited by
De Gonneville, it is necessary to refute here the various opinions
expressed on the subject which refer to countries other than the
Australian Continent. The most ancient is that brought forward by
tile geographers, Duval and Nolin, and the navigator, Bouvet, who
place those lands almost immediately to the south of the Cape of
Good Hope. As there are no lands thereabout, this opinion is hardly
worth quoting but, considering the very limited knowledge of the
geography of that part of the world in those days, the error may be
readily understood. Others, basing their opinion on the length of
De Gonneville's voyage, have surmised that he might have landed on
some part of the coast of Tasmania or of New Zealand, but this
conclusion is equally untenable, as these islands are not situated
within calm latitudes, and are not near or even in the direction of
the "true course to the East Indies," which the French sailor was
satisfied he was not far off, as, under this belief, he, on leaving
the "Southern Indies" endeavoured to induce his crew to continue
their voyage. Besides, the description given of the inhabitants and
their manners, applies more to natives of a tropical or
semi-tropical climate than to those of such cold regions as New
Zealand and Tasmania.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, confronted with only one more opinion, which
is held by most English geographers on the high authority of
Admiral Burney.</p>

<p>"Let the whole account," says Burney, "be reconsidered without
prepossession, and the idea that will immediately and most
naturally occur is that Southern India, discovered by De
Gonneville, was Madagascar. De Gonneville, having doubled (passed
round) the Cape, was by tempests driven into calm latitudes, and so
near to this land that he was directed thither by the flight of
birds. The refusal of the crew to proceed to Eastern India would
scarcely have happened if they had been so far advanced to the east
as New Holland."</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive how Burney could have expressed such
an opinion, unless he was led to that conclusion by some errors in
Callender's translations. There is, in fact, a passage having
reference to the descriptions of the head-dress worn by the native
women, in which the Scotch geographer has given the following
version of Des Brosses' original:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The women and girls go bareheaded, with their hair
neatly tied up in tresses, mixed with flowers of most beautiful
colours."?</blockquote>

<p>The original narrative reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Et vont les femmes et filles tête nue, ayant les
cheveux gentiment teurchés de petits cordons d'herbes teintes de
couleurs vives et luisantes."</blockquote>

<p>Which means:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The women and girls go bare headed, having their hair
ornamented with little strings of grass dyed in bright
colours."</blockquote>

<p>This, as will be seen, is a very different version. Callender
evidently did not understand the old Norman
expression&mdash;<i>genitment teurchés</i>, which means "nicely
ornamented," and translated it by the word that appeared to him
more akin in form, <i>tresses</i>, hence, "the hair neatly tied up
in tresses", which is a characteristic custom of the native women
of the island of Madagascar.</p>

<p>But this is a small matter. It is, however, more difficult to
dispose of another fact as telling against the Madagascar theory,
which apparently did not strike Burney. Gonneville states that he
was driven into calm latitudes, and after tedious navigation, was
directed southward by the flight of birds. It is only necessary
here to compare dates in order to show how misapplied would be this
description to the latitudes within which Madagascar is
situated.</p>

<p>De Gonneville left Honfleur in June, 1503, and quilted Southern
India on the 3rd of July of the following year. As he stayed six
months in that country, his outward voyage had, therefore, lasted
about seven months, and he must have been in the vicinity of the
Cape of Good Hope about December, 1503, or January, 1504. As it is
a well-known fact that tempestuous weather is generally met with
from the <i>south-west</i> and, moreover, that the prevailing wind
during that season of the year is from the north-west, De
Gonneville, whose true course lay to the north-east, was probably
driven much more toward the east than he expected, for he expressly
states that he was convinced he was not far from the true course to
the East Indies. Had the tempests blown from the <i>south-east</i>,
there would never, in all probability, have been any need
discussing his account, for he would have had none to render, as
his ship would have been driven very quickly against the East
African coast, or the south-east coast of Madagascar and
wrecked.</p>

<p>It must be assumed that De Gonneville was, for his time, a man
of great ability, well versed in nautical matters, and the use of
the primitive instruments which were then known, and his opinion
as, to the position of his ship, and his desire to proceed to the
East Indies, being inwardly satisfied that he was not far from the
object of his voyage, is certainly entitled to some consideration,
although, unfortunately, he has not left any indication of the
latitude or longitude of the country he visited. If to this be
added the facts that it is precisely in the season extending from
December to March, that the Madagascar latitudes are constantly
visited by hurricanes, and that the cyclones which originate in the
Indian Ocean burst over the islands of Mauritius and Reunion, and
generally travel towards these coasts, it will be apparent that the
term "calm latitudes" must necessarily apply to some other part of
the Indian Ocean. It is equally well-known that the belt which
extends round the globe between 10 deg. of latitude, north, and 10
deg. of latitude, south, is in all parts of the ocean, and at all
times, subject to very tedious calms, though the waters may
occasionally be ruffled by very heavy hurricanes and storms. These
facts force us to seek for the land visited in the neighbourhood of
these latitudes. The objection raised by the sailors to proceed to
the East Indies means nothing, as they had no idea of their
position, while as ignorant and superstitious men, tired of a long
and dangerous voyage, they had little reason to share in their
chief's confidence in his estimate of the locality they had
reached, and had no thought but that of returning homewards without
facing again the dangers of unknown seas.</p>

<p>Further arguments are not wanting to refute the Madagascar
theory. In the first place, the Portuguese, who discovered that
island in 1506, and explored its coasts in the following years,
could not have Ion. remained in ignorance of De Gonneville's
voyage. The cross erected by his companion was, perhaps, not
destroyed; but, so short a period having c-lapsed between their
discoveries and the Norman captain's voyage, the natives could
scarcely have forgotten so important an event. The only alternative
theory would be that, in their explorations along the coast of the
island, the Portuguese were so unfortunate as to land everywhere
but near the spot where De Gonneville may be supposed to have
resided. It is stated, moreover, that the priest Paulmier wrote his
memorial to the Pope with the object of obtaining a Christian
mission to the home of his ancestors; but the Portuguese
missionaries were preaching the Gospel in Madagascar almost since
the first visits of their countrymen to that island, and it is
self-evident that the Abbe, who was often in the company of the
priests who in Paris administered the foreign missions in
non-Christian countries, must have been aware of this fact; while
M. de Villermon positively states that he often met Paulmier in
company with M. de Flacourt who had been Governor of Madagascar
where France had established itself as far back as 1642. What would
have been the necessity, it may be asked, of praying that a
Christian mission should be sent to a country where missions had
flourished for over a century, or of founding a French colony in an
island which was already occupied by France, and had received
resident governors ten years before the good priest wrote?</p>

<p>But there is one last point which is sufficient in itself to
remove all doubts on the subject. Here, again, we must compare
dates, and we find that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"They left that country on the 3rd of July, 15o4, and
did not see land until the day after the Feast of St. Denis, i.e.,
10th October, 1504."</blockquote>

<p>De Gonneville's report to the Admiralty is dated 15th June,
1505, and admitting that there was some delay between his landing
at Honfleur and the date of his report, which was signed by the
principal officers of his vessel, he could hardly have reached
France before March or April of that year. As he was, moreover,
convinced that the country to which he had given the name of
Southern India lay to the south of the East Indies, it is evident
that on his return home his course must have been
<i>south-west</i>, which, had he started from the east coast of
Madagascar, or, as D'Avezac thinks, from that of South America,
would have landed him on his starting point. It is evident that the
land he sighted after three months' navigation could be no other
than the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>This is sufficient, we venture to think, to dispose of the
Madagascar theory, as it does also of the South American one,
which, it may be added, can hardly be admitted as possible, when
the length of the return voyage of De Gonneville (about twelve
months) is taken into consideration, together with the fact that
the whole of the South American coast within the region where De
Gonneville might have landed was explored and settled about the
same time, and some record of his voyage would certainly have been
found.</p>

<p>Where, then, shall we look for this Southern India, for that
fine river, at the mouth of which De Gonneville remained six
months, and for that fine country which his companions explored in
their journeys with the natives?</p>

<p>A river of the size described pre-supposes a country of
considerable extent, and therefore De Gonneville could not have
landed on any of the islands lying between Madagascar and the Sunda
Islands. It could not have been either of the latter named, as they
lie to the north, and not the south of the calm latitudes referred
to by De Gonneville. We are perforce obliged to admit that, as it
was not and cannot have been Madagascar, it must have been
Australia, and in all probability the north-west coast of the
continent, about the Prince Regent and Glenelg rivers, where the
explorers King and Grey found fine rivers and a rich country fairly
populated with a race of warlike natives. It is certainly difficult
when reading the description given of the "Australians," by De
Gonneville, to imagine that they could possibly have had any
resemblance to the races we are accustomed to meet with in almost
all parts of Australia. Still less could they have resembled the
wretched creatures which Dampier found inhabiting the west coast,
between Cape Le veque and the North-west Cape, and we must,
therefore, look further north for a country and a race of men
answering better to the description of the Norman captain.</p>

<p>De Gonneville found a fine district, watered by a large river,
and inhabited by men who possessed a kind of rudimentary
civilization, a tribal organization, and obeyed some established
individual authority. He further tells us that they lived in
villages, or agglomerations of huts of the shape of the covered
markets in the Normandy villages&mdash;that is to say, oval or
round, made of stakes driven into the ground, and the intervals
filled up with herbs and the leaves of trees; and that the speech
of these people is soft and melodious. He also speaks of the birds,
beasts, fishes, and other curious animals unknown in Christendom,
of which Master Nicole le Fevre, of Honfleur, who was a volunteer
in the voyage, had taken exact draughts. And, last of all, we are
told that De Gonneville induced the chief or king of the country to
allow him to take home his son and another Indian as a companion,
promising to return with them in twenty "moons" at furthest, and
owing to the impossibility of fulfilling that promise, he procured
the young Australian an establishment in France, and married him to
one of his relatives, from whom he had posterity. This last portion
of the narrative would appear the most incredible of all, if we had
not official and documentary evidence of its absolute truth, as it
must certainly be presumed that the Australian could not possibly
have belonged to the wretched races with whom we are familiar.</p>

<p>But, however difficult it may seem to reconcile the account of
De Gonneville with our general knowledge of the natives of
Australia, the task is not so hopeless as at first sight may
appear; and we shall crave the attention of the reader to the
following description of the country and the inhabitants of that
part of North-west Australia which surrounds the Glenelg. and
Prince Regent and other rivers in their neighbourhood, discovered
and visited for the first time by Captain King and Lieutenant, now
Sir George, Grey, the latter exploring it to some distance inland
in the year 1838.</p>

<p>Referring to that part of the country, Lieut. Grey says in his
"Expedition in North-Western and Western Australia," p.
179:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The peak we ascended afforded us a very beautiful
view: to the north lay Prince Regent's River, and the good country
we were now upon extended as far as the inlets which communicated
with this great navigable stream; to the south and south-westward
lay the Glenelg, meandering through as verdant and fertile a
district as the eye of man ever rested on. The luxuriance of
tropical vegetation was now seen to great advantage in the height
of the rainy season. The smoke of native fires rose in every
direction from the country which lay like a map at our feet; and
when I recollected that all those natural riches of soil and
climate lay between two navigable rivers, and that its sea coast
frontage, not much exceeding fifty miles in latitude, contained
three of the finest harbours in the world in which the tide rose
thirty-seven and a half feet, I could not but feel we were in a
land singularly blessed by nature."</blockquote>

<p>Could any description more closely adapt itself to the fine
country, fairly peopled (<i>peuplée entre deux</i>) of which De
Gonneville speaks. Further, on page 195 g S of the same work, Grey
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"We at length reached a watershed connecting the
country we had left with that we were entering upon...This
watershed consisted principally of a range of elevated hills, from
which streams were thrown off to the Glenelg and to Prince Regent's
River. The scenery here was fine, but I have so often before
described the same character of landscape that it will be
sufficient to say, we again looked down from high land on a very
fertile country, covered with a tropical vegetation, and lying
between two navigable rivers. <i>I can compare this to no other
Australian scenery, for I have met with nothing in the other
portions of the continent which at all resemble
it</i>."</blockquote>

<p>Referring to the fauna, the same authority says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"North Western Australia seems to be peculiarly
prolific in birds, reptiles, and insects, who dwell here
unmolested..."</blockquote>

<p>After mentioning several kinds of kangaroos, opossums, native
dogs, etc., the former of which animals are constantly hunted down
by the natives, Grey, speaking of the birds, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"To describe the birds common to these parts requires
more time than to detail the names of the few quadrupeds to be
found. Indeed, in no other country that I have ever visited do
birds so abound. Even the virgin forests of America cannot, in my
belief, boast of such numerous feathered denizens...The birds of
this country possess, in many instances, an excessively beautiful
plumage, and he alone who has traversed these wild and romantic
regions, who has beheld a flock of many-coloured parrakeets
sweeping like a moving rainbow through the air, can form any
adequate idea of the scenes that then burst on the eye of the
wondering naturalist. As to fish, the rivers abound in many species
of excellent fish."</blockquote>

<p>Could there be a more fitting description of that country which
De Gonneville and his companions explored along the coast and in
the interior to a distance of two days' journey, which "they found
very fertile and full of many birds, beasts, and fish hitherto
unknown in Christendom?" To what does this latter qualification
apply? Certainly not to birds, beasts, or fish of either South
America or Madagascar, as the American fauna was, to a certain
extent, already known in Christendom, and that of Madagascar, which
resembles that of the east coast of Africa, apart from a few
species not particularly remarkable or numerous, was also
well-known to Europeans. These beasts, of which, to use the old
Norman phrase of "Master Nicole Le Fevre, avait pourtrayé les
façons," must have struck him as very peculiar indeed when he
refers to them as "utterly unknown in Christendom," and we know
well that no other country can boast of a fauna so essentially
different to that of any other part of the world as the Australian
Continent.</p>

<p>And now as to the natives of this part of Australia,
<i>i.e.</i>, the neighbourhood of the Glenelg and Prince Regent's
River. Grey, in page 251 of the above cited work, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"My knowledge of the natives is chiefly drawn from what
I have observed of their haunts, their painted caves, and drawings.
I have, moreover, become acquainted with several of their weapons,
some of their implements, and took pains to study their disposition
and habits as far as I could.<br>
<br>
"In their manner of life, their weapons, and mode of hunting,
they closely resemble the other Australian tribes with which I have
since become pretty intimately acquainted, <i>whilst in their form
and appearance there is a striking difference</i>. They are, in
general, very tall and robust, and exhibit in their legs and arms a
fine, full development of muscle which is unknown to southern
races. They wear no clothes, and their bodies are marked by scars
and wales. They seem to have no regular mode of dressing their
hair, this appearing to depend entirely on individual taste or
caprice.<br>
<br>
"<i>They appear to live in tribes, subject, perhaps, to some
individual authority, and each tribe has a sort of capital or
head-quarters, where the women and children remain, whilst the men,
divided into small parties, hunt and shoot in every direction</i>.
The largest number we saw together, including women and children,
amounted to nearly two hundred.<br>
<br>
"Their arms consist of stone-headed spears, of throwing-sticks,
of boomerangs or kileys, clubs, and stone hatchets.<br>
<br>
"These natives manufacture their water buckets and weapons very
neatly, and make from the bark of a tree a light but strong
cord.<br>
<br>
"<i>Their huts, of which I only saw those on the coast, are
constructed, in an oval form, of the boughs of trees, and are
roofed with dry reeds. The diameter of one which I measured was
about fourteen feet at the base</i>.<br>
<br>
"<i>Their language is soft and melodious, so much so as to lead
to the inference that it differs very materially, if not radically,
from the more southern Australian dialects, which I have since had
an opportunity to inquire into</i>. Their gesticulation is
expressive, and their bearing manly and noble. They never speared a
horse or sheep belonging to us, and, judging by the degree of
industry shown in their paintings, the absence of anything
offensive in the subjects delineated, and the careful finish of
some articles of common use, I should infer that, under proper
treatment, they might easily be raised very considerably in the
scale of civilisation.<br>
<br>
"<i>A remarkable circumstance is the presence amongst them of a
race, to appearance, totally different and almost white, who seem
to exercise no small influence over the rest</i>. I am forced to
believe that the distrust evinced towards strangers arose from
these persons, as in both instances when we were attacked, the
hostile party was led by one of these light-coloured
men."</blockquote>

<p>We need only draw the attention of the reader to the close
resemblance between the description of De Gonneville's
"Australians" and that of Grey's in many particulars, especially in
their tribal organization, the form of their houses, [Note, below]
their language, and the fact of the existence among them, as
leaders of the tribes, of that race of almost white men also
observed about the same parts by Captain King, who thinks that they
are of Malay origin.</p>

<p>[Note: Callender, in his translation omits a passage referring
to the form of the huts of the Australians, which De Gonneville
says were "<i>en forme de halles</i>," <i>i.e</i>., in the form of
covered markets such as seen in the villages of Normandy, which are
generally oval structures.]</p>

<p>There are certain discrepancies, however, which cannot be
explained away, unless it is taken into consideration that Grey
visited those coasts three hundred and thirty years after the
French sailor, and that during that interval of time the customs of
the inhabitants cannot fall to have undergone a change. It may be
also that the light-coloured people seen amongst them are but the
remnants of once numerous tribes, probably of Malay origin, as
these latter have left undeniable marks of their having not
intermixed with the native races throughout the whole of northern
Australia. One of the points of dissemblance which might be pointed
out is the fact that De Gonneville describes them as using bows and
arrows, which is at variance with our knowledge of the arms of the
Australians, and equally differs from Grey's description of the
same; but this objection exists also as regards the inhabitants of
Madagascar, who, besides, had already attained a much higher degree
of civilisation than that described by De Gonneville&mdash;being
acquainted with the use of iron, the manufacture of cotton and silk
goods, fine mats, and many other articles of value among civilised
people. The Madagascar natives never made use of the skins of
animals as an article of dress, whilst this custom is common to the
aborigines of all parts of Australia, where the kangaroo, opossums,
native bears, and emus, furnish them with the material, with which
they could manufacture these garments of skins or beds of feathers
described by De Gonneville. But if the theory is accepted, which we
are about to put forward regarding the inhabitants of this part of
Australia&mdash;that at the time of De Gonneville's visit a people
of Malay origin inhabited it in fairly large numbers, of which the
light-coloured natives seen by Grey are the descendants, and that
with their disappearance from that district some of their customs
disappeared with them, the natives of the present day retaining
only those best suited to their actual mode of life&mdash;then the
Norman captain's narrative will become intelligible. Besides, as
regards the use of bow and arrow, certainly known to the Malays,
although the intercourse of the latter with other tribes on the
north Australian coast has been undoubtedly frequent, nowhere have
the Australian natives adopted that kind of arm, whilst in New
Guinea and all over Northern Polynesia the bow and arrow is the
inevitable war accoutrement of the savage, who certainly obtained
the knowledge of it from his Malay forefathers. No wonder, then,
that in the district explored by Grey, these arms should have given
way to the equally effective boomerang, throwing-stick, and spears,
and other weapons of the North Australian savage.</p>

<p>The theory we have just submitted with regard to the country
round the Glenelg River and that of the Prince Regent having been
at one time inhabited by a different and superior race is no idle
one, and is proved by the discoveries of remarkable paintings made
by the same Lieutenant Grey in the caves near the mouth of the
abovenamed rivers.</p>

<p>Again we shall have to quote this excellent author, whose clear
and concise descriptions are of such value, and refer the reader to
the following passages in the diary of his explorations in that
part of the Australian Continent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"On this sloping roof the principal figure (1) which I
have just alluded to was drawn. In order to produce the greater
effect, the rock about it was painted black, and the figure itself
coloured with the most vivid red and white. It thus appeared to
stand out from the rock, and I was certainly surprised at the
moment that I first saw this gigantic head and upper part of a body
bending over and staring grimly down on me.<br>
<br>
"It would be impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of this
uncouth and savage figure; I shall, therefore, only give such a
succinct account of this and the other paintings as will serve as a
sort of description to accompany the annexed plates.<br>
<br>
"Length of head and face 2 ft. 0 in.<br>
"Width of face 0 ft 17 in. (sic)<br>
"Length from bottom of face to navel 2 ft 6 in.<br>
<br>
"Its head was encircled by bright red rays, something like the rays
which one sees proceeding from the sun when depicted on the
signboard of a public house. Inside of this came a broad stripe of
very brilliant red, which was coped by lines of white; both inside
and outside of this red space were narrow stripes of a still deeper
red, intended probably to mark its boundaries. The face was painted
vividly white and the eyes black, being, however, surrounded by red
and yellow lines. The body, head, and arms were outlined red, the
body being curiously painted with red stripes and bars.<br>
<br>
"Upon the rock which formed the left hand wall of this cave, and
which partly faced you on entering, was a very singular painting
(2), vividly coloured, representing four heads joined together.
From the mild expression of the countenances, I imagined them to
represent females, and they appeared to be drawn in such a manner
and in such a position as to look up at the principal figure which
I have before described. Each had a very remarkable head-dress,
coloured with a deep, bright blue, and one had a necklace on. Both
of the lower figures had a sort of dress, painted with red, in the
same manner as that of the principal figure, and one of them had a
band round the waist. Each of the four faces was marked by a
totally distinct expression of countenance, and although none of
them had mouths, two, I thought, were otherwise rather
good-looking. The whole painting was executed on a white ground,
and its dimensions were:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Total length of painting 3 ft. 6¾ in.<br>
"Breadth across two upper heads 2 ft. 6 in.<br>
"Breadth across two lower heads 3 ft. 1½ in."</blockquote>

<p>These remarkable paintings attracted Grey's attention, and led
him wondering as to their origin. The solution to that problem he
has however left to others. (Fig 1, see Appendix.)</p>

<p>According to him, the first two frescoes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
those situated on the roof of the cave, representing the principal
figure, and that representing the four persons (probably women),
are one subject. A glance at their position, and the expression of
their faces, leads one to accept Grey's opinion as not only
admissible, but as the only accurate one. The group of women is
placed in an attitude of prayer, or of submission towards the
central figure, also representing a woman, as all except the
head-dress, which is a little different, exactly resemble the
others; it is also evident that the artist wished to represent a
religious subject.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remark that the people among which these
drawings have been found belong to an almost savage race, and in
admitting that they may be the work of a superior race that once
inhabited these parts (which, by the way, is the opinion of Sir
George Grey), yet this superior race could hardly be any other but
some Malay tribe. Among these latter, as well as among all savage,
or semi-savage people, woman is considered as a being of an
inferior order, more fit to become a slave than to be worshipped,
and as the Malays had either adopted for centuries past, either one
of two creeds, that of Buddhism from the Hindoos, or that of
Mahomet from the Arabs, we look in vain, save in the former, and
that in only one or two well-known instances, which cannot for a
moment be entertained here, for the worship of a woman. The Malay
religious artistic subjects that we know of are of an order far
above that of which we have a sample here, and there is no
resemblance at all in their paintings with anything depicted in
these caves.</p>

<p>There are several points of importance with regard to these
pictures, to which we beg to direct the reader's attention. In the
first place, the perfect oval shape of the head; secondly, the
colour of the face, which is painted <i>vividly white</i>,
evidently for some purpose; and thirdly, the fact that the kind of
dress worn over the bodies exactly resembles that described by De
Gonneville as worn by the women of the Southern Indies, made of
some kind of matted material, sometimes also of skins, or of
feathers, girt above the haunches and reaching to the knee. (Fig.
2, see Appendix.)</p>

<p>Compare, also, the date assigned by Grey to these pictures-two
or three centuries, and this coincidence will appear still more
remarkable.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject. It is difficult, if not impossible
to credit the natives at the time of Grey's visit as being the
authors of these paintings. The eminent traveller absolutely
discredits such a possibility, and attributes them to a far distant
epoch, and a totally different race. The perfect oval shape of the
faces was not drawn so without a purpose, and neither were they
painted so vividly white, if the artist had not desired to pourtray
types of a race certainly not existing at present on the the
Australian continent. It is difficult to admit that it might be of
Malay origin, as tile head-dress, or to describe it more perfectly,
the <i>aureola</i> surrounding the head, is met with in Buddhist
paintings or sculptures only as surrounding the head of gods, who
can always be recognised by their peculiar and constant
characteristics, and nowhere are these <i>aureolas</i> surrounded
with the rays in the shape of "<i>flamèches</i>," which confront us
in the drawing of the principal figure. (Fig. 3, see Appendix.) It
resembles, indeed, much better Grey's own description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Its head was encircled by bright red rays, something
like the rays which one sees proceeding from the sun, when depicted
on the sign board of a public house."</blockquote>

<p>There is evidently here some strange mixture of European and
Malay art, the former exhibited in the remarkable <i>aureolas</i>
which so commonly surround the heads of saints in the old images,
in painted church windows of the middle ages, and the times of De
Gonneville, and the latter in the kind of dress over the body,
which appears to be meant to represent some sort of matted stuff.
This painting is not the work of a native artist; it is unlikely
that it could be the work of Malays, in the third place there is in
its position and its peculiar appearance such a striking touch of
an European conception, mingled with barbaric surroundings, that
one is almost inclined to the belief that we are here in the
presence of a subject of religious, nay, a Christian order.</p>

<p>This deduction may need additional evidence, and if the reader
will kindly follow with us Lieutenant Grey's steps, he will be
placed in the presence of a still more remarkable painting, which
we shall presently describe.</p>

<blockquote>"The cave was twenty feet deep, and at the entrance
seven feet high and about forty feet wide. As before stated the
floor gradually approached the roof in the direction of the bottom
of the cavern, and its width also contracted so that at the
extremity it was not broader than the slab of rock which formed a
natural seat. The principal painting in it was the painting of a
man ten feet six inches in length, clothed from the chin downwards
in a red garment which reached to the wrists and ankles; beyond
this red dress the feet and hands protruded, and were badly
executed.<br>
<br>
"The face and head of the figure were enveloped in a succession of
circular bandages, or rollers, or what appeared to be painted to
represent such. These were coloured red, yellow, and white, and the
eyes were the only features represented on the face. Upon the
highest bandage, or roller, a series of lines were painted in red,
but although so irregularly done as to indicate that they have some
meaning, it is impossible to tell whether they were intended to
depict written characters or some ornament for the head. This
figure was so drawn on the roof that its feet were just in front of
the natural seat, whilst its head and face looked directly down on
anyone who stood in the entrance of the cave, but it was totally
invisible from the outside. The painting was more injured by the
damp and atmosphere, and had the appearance of being much more
defaced and ancient than any of the others which we have seen.
There were two other paintings, one on each side of the rocks,
which stood on either side of the natural seat: they were carefully
executed, and yet had no apparent design in them, unless they were
intended to represent some fabulous species of turtle; for the
natives of Australia are generally fond of narrating tales of
fabulous and extraordinary animals, such as gigantic snakes, etc."
(Fig. 4, see Appendix.)</blockquote>

<p>With this drawing, as well as in the others, it is evident that
native talent had nothing to do. Neither had, in all probability,
the Malays, as the form of the dress and its colour are
incompatible with anything we know of these people. Then again the
same <i>aureola</i> surrounds the head of the figure, and we are
inclined to think that this drawing is due to the same artist who
painted those already described. Although Grey believes that it is
a more ancient production, the face of it having suffered more than
the other is in all probability due to it being more exposed to
atmospheric, or other influences, rather than to its greater
antiquity. There are, however, some very interesting points to
examine in this drawing, and in the first place our attention is
drawn to the curious signs inscribed on the <i>aureola</i>
surrounding the head.</p>

<p>At first sight, an illiterate person would at once exclaim,
"these are Latin characters."</p>

<p><b>G I T I L F</b>
</p>

<p>Five out of six undoubtedly are such, and the sixth appears to
be part of an unfinished or defaced letter, probably F or E. This
is evidently very remarkable, and more so is the fact which a
closer examination discloses that near the right shoulder of the
figure two additional characters, <i>c d</i>, also undoubtedly of
Latin form, are there inscribed, proving the European origin of
this drawing, which resembles exactly those paintings of the middle
ages, representing some holy monk or nun in their habilaments, of a
coarse, brown cloth, the hands, and still more so the feet in that,
position which painters of religious subjects have rendered us so
familiar with on the old church windows, and other paintings of
those times. The practice of printing the name of the saint on the
<i>aureola</i> encircling the head is also a common one, and
perhaps we may find there an explanation of that painting, which
will also prove the others to be of like origin. These characters
are, undoubtedly, Latin, whichever way one might like to turn them,
and their appearance in such a spot is not due to chance alone. It
would be a difficult task to attempt to explain their meaning, but,
perhaps, a further exploration of these singular caves may bring to
light information leading to their identification and explanation.
Suffice it to say that they certainly tend to show the European and
Christian character of these paintings, the first one probably
representing the holy women praying before the Virgin, and the
other some holy nun, as the line over the chin seems to indicate
the well-known head-dress. It may be objected that the Virgin could
hardly have been pourtrayed in such a costume, to which the answer
may be made, that it was a common custom at the time, among the
disciples of Francis Xavier who evangelised India, to represent the
Virgin and the saints in the costume of the country, in order to
bring them in an easier way to the conception of the native mind, a
practice, need it be added, which brought on the head of the
Jesuits the most severe condemnation.</p>

<p>If such is the case, and if these paintings are, as we believe,
the work of Europeans, we might look in their vicinity for some
other and still more convincing proof of their origin.</p>

<p>Such is afforded also, and the evidence is telling.</p>

<p>For the last time we shall quote the same eminent author, and at
page 205 of vol. 1. of his work, we read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"After proceeding some distance, we found a cave larger
than the one seen this morning; of its actual size, however, I have
no idea, for being pressed for time I did not attempt to explore
it, having merely ascertained that it contained no paintings. I was
moving on when we observed a profile of a human face and head, cut
out in a sandstone rock which fronted the cave; this rock was so
hard that to have removed such a large portion of it with no better
tool than a knife and hatchet made of stone, such as the Australian
natives generally possess, would have been a work of very great
labour. The head was two feet in length, and sixteen inches in
breadth in the broadest part; the depth of the profile increased
gradually from the edges where it was nothing, to the centre where
it was an inch and a half. The ear was rather badly placed, but
otherwise the whole of the work was good, and far superior to what
a savage race could be supposed capable of executing. The only
proof of antiquity that it bore about it was that all the edges of
the cutting were rounded and perfectly smooth, much more so than
they could have been from any other cause than long exposure to
atmospheric influences.<br>
<br>
"After having made a sketch of this head I returned to the
party."</blockquote>

<p>Now let us examine, without prepossession or prejudice, this
remarkable sculpture, <i>the only head sculptured in rock ever
found in Australia</i>.</p>

<p>This profile is that of an European, the purity of the lines,
the perfect shape of the head, the straight and well-formed nose,
the finely-cut lips, the round chin, represent the most exact type
of an European head that it could be possible to imagine. Indeed,
the fact alone that the natives have no means of cutting out such a
sculpture in the rock, is enough to induce one to seek elsewhere
for its author, and the head is certainly not that of a Malay; the
type is European, and that of the purest.</p>

<p>We shall go no further with this discussion, which the
appearance of this sculptured profile of an European head closes on
our behalf better than all volumes would do, and resume it in a few
words.</p>

<p>De Gonneville, carried away by storms into unknown seas, lands
on a coast which he estimates is situated to the south of India,
and the Islands of Spices, and not far from the true course to the
East Indies; at the entrance of a fine river, and in a fertile
country, whose inhabitants he describes. They were in all
probability of Malay stock, and there is no difficulty so far to
understand his female relative having married a person of that
race, the remnants of which have been met with since by other
travellers.</p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty-five years after De Gonneville's
voyage, King and Grey explore in the north-west part of Australia,
a country whose description well answers to that visited by De
Gonneville, and <i>never set foot upon by Europeans in the
interval</i>. There Grey finds a river such as De Gonneville
describes&mdash;a land inhabited by races that have preserved many
of the customs of the "Australians" described by the Norman captain
with whom, as a volunteer in the voyage, had travelled a certain
Nicole Le Fevre, a man of some learning' and a kind of artist, who
had pourtrayed strange beasts, etc., "utterly unknown in
Christendom." In that country', at a very short distance from the
coast, Grey discovers curious paintings, some strikingly resembling
the pictures of saints as represented on the Church windows of the
time, one of them bearing some very remarkable European letters and
characters, and last of all he finds there the head of an European
sculptured in the hard rock, evidently with instruments such as the
natives do not possess.</p>

<p>What are we to conclude from these facts? That there is strong
evidence that De Gonneville, who could have landed nowhere else but
on Australian soil, had precisely landed on that part of the
country visited by Grey, and that the paintings discovered are the
work of some of his companions.</p>

<p>But although such evidence is strong indeed, it is not yet
absolutely perfect, even for one desirous of solving the problem of
fixing the exact position of the spot visited by the Norman sailor.
Others, perhaps, may give a different interpretation to the figures
and the characters represented above; they are, however, worthy of
attracting notice, and if the result of this investigation is only
to draw the attention of those who are interested in ascertaining
the previous history of the country they inhabit and love, be they
members of scientific societies or of colonial governments, the
task undertaken will not prove a thankless one.</p>

<p>One thin. is settled, however, beyond the possibility of doubt,
and that is, that De Gonneville landed on no other soil but that of
Australia, and nowhere else but at the mouth of some of the
north-western rivers.</p>

<p>The maps of the sixteenth century, known to have existed long
before the voyages of the Dutch and the English, bear witness to
the fact that the north-western part of the coast of Australia was
sighted by the Portuguese on their voyages to and from the East
Indies and the Spice Islands.</p>

<p>A critical examination of these charts, some of which have been
reproduced for the Public Libraries of the chief Australian cities
from the originals in the British Museums, tends to
show&mdash;although most of the names of features on the north-west
coast are in French&mdash;that some of them appear to have been
translated from the Portuguese. The older of these charts bears the
date of the year 1542, but there are two more maps in the
"Bibliotheque Nationale de France" which are still more ancient.
One, which is the work of Guillaume Le Testu, a pilot of Dieppe,
shows a portion of the coast in a fairly correct position,
indicating features which can easily be recognised, although their
longitude and latitude are not exact; the names, which are all in
French, do not exhibit any sign of having been translated from any
other language; and there is little doubt that Le Testu, who
published this chart in 1536, must have heard of the expedition of
De Gonneville, which could hardly have failed to attract attention
at the time among the sailors of note in the ports of the Normandy
coast. Considering the state of geographical science at that epoch,
the delineation of the north-west coast of the Australian continent
is certainly as accurate as that of the island of Java and minor
islands in those regions, which were much better known, and there
is in this fact evidence enough that the data upon which Le Testu,
Jean Rotz, and other cartographers worked, must have been fairly
accurate. The Norman pilot shows on his map the entrance of several
rivers and features which closely resemble the outline of this
coast as at present known, but except in the vicinity of the rivers
mentioned, the coast on the south and the north-east is prolonged
without data, and merely indicates a probable extension of land in
these directions. The other maps agree fairly well in this respect,
the outlines of very small portions only of the coast
being&mdash;susceptible of identification at present. From these
facts we may infer that Guillaume Le Testu probably obtained much
of his information from the report of De Gonneville, whilst Rotz
and the authors of the maps in the British Museum had theirs from
Portuguese sources, and as the latters' delineation of the
north-west coast is less accurate, it may be that the Portuguese
sailors, from whose reports this information was obtained, merely
sighted these coasts without attempting to land.</p>

<p>To close this discussion, it may be added, that in most
instances the early voyages of the Dutch or possibly the Portuguese
to Western Australia were the result of such accidents as befell De
Gonneville, as they were carried by storms out of their course to
India or the Sunda Islands, and thrown on the west coast of the
Australian Continent.</p>

<p>The first claim to the discovery of the Australian Continent may
be, therefore, settled in favor of De Gonneville; although, there
is little doubt that the existence of a great southern land was
suspected by the Chinese, and also by the ancients. This great
land, situated on the opposite side of the world, was named by them
<i>Anti-chton</i>, and its supposed inhabitants "Antichtones," and
the fact of the possibility of it being inhabited at all gave rise
to a good deal of discussion among ancient writers. They, however,
agreed in the belief that "the fury of the sun, which burns the
intermediate zone," rendered it inaccessible to the inhabitants of
the world. Plinus, Pomponius Mela, Scipio, Virgilius, Cicero, and
Macrobius considered this land as habitable, and the two last
mentioned authors held the opinion that it was inhabited by a
different race of beings.</p>

<p>This question was also debated by the early Christian fathers,
and perhaps the most remarkable argument against the existence of
the <i>Antichtones</i> will be found in the works of the celebrated
theologian and venerated father, St. Augustine, who devotes the
whole of Chapter IX., Book XVI. of his admirable work, "De Civitate
Dei," to the discussion of this knotty question.</p>

<blockquote>"Quod verò," writes St. Augustine, "Antipodes esse
fabulantur, id est, homines a contaria parte terrae, ubi sol
oritur, quando occidit nobis, adversa pedibus nostris calcare
vestigia, nulla ratione credendum est. Neque hoc ulla historica
cognitione didicisse se affirmant, sed quali ratiocinando
conjectant, es quod intra con vexa coeli terra suspenda sit, eum
demque locum mundas habeat, et infirmum, et medium: et ex hoc
opinantur alteram terra pattern, quae infra est, habitatione
hominum carere non posse. Nec adtendunt, etiamsi figura conglobata
et rotunda mundus esse credatur, sive aliqua ratione monstretur;
non tamen esse consequens, ut etiam ex illa parte ab aquarum
congerie nuda sit terra devide etiamus nuda sit, neque hoc statum
necesse esse, ut homines habeat, Quoniam nulla modo Scriptura ista
mentitur, quae narratis praeteritis facis sidem, eo quod ejus
praedicta complentur: nimisque absurdurn est, ut dicatur aliquos
hornines ex hae in illam partem, oceani immensitate trajecta,
navigare ac pervenive potuisse, ut etiarn illic ex uno illo primo
hornine genus institueretur hurnanurn?"</blockquote>

<p>The substance of which is: "That there can be nothing more
absurd than the belief of some ancient writers who imagined that
the land on the opposite side of the world could be inhabited by
human beings. Those who made this assertion admit they have no
historical fact to base it upon, and that it is merely a logical
deduction of philosophy. But if we accept as true the principles
upon which they base their arguments, is it to be necessarily
admitted that because these countries are habitable, that they are
in reality inhabited. As the Holy Scripture, which is our guide in
all matters of belief, makes no mention of this, and as it is an
accepted fact that the descendants of our first parents could not
have sailed to and reached these countries, how is it possible that
they could be inhabited."</p>

<p>Although the existence of a great Austral land was a subject of
philosophical and theological discussion among the ancients, they,
however, never attempted to sail across that ocean which was the
limit of the world they knew. It is possible that the Chinese may
have been more bold, but it is very doubtful whether they ever
sailed so far south as to land on the coast of the Australian
continent. They have left no trace of their passage, either on the
land itself, or among its inhabitants. Besides, the Chinese were
never very enterprising sailors, the form of their junks, their
peculiar sails, and the scantiness of their nautical knowledge
prevented them from extending very far the radius of their maritime
explorations. Marco Polo is the authority generally quoted in this
matter, as he states that the people of Cathay knew of the
existence of a great land far to the southward, with the
inhabitants of which they were accustomed to trade. This is rather
an indefinite description, and might apply to New Guinea as well as
to the Australian Continent. More so to the former and the islands
surrounding it on the north and east, where evidence exists of the
voyage of the Chinese traders and fishermen in search of the
precious trepang. But as these holothuriae are generally found in
the vicinity of the coral banks of Polynesia, to the eastward of
New Guinea, and not in the direction of the Australian coast, there
is much reason to think that the Chinese claim to the discovery of
this continent is purely mythical, although, like the ancients,
they may have believed in its existence as a logical deduction of
philosophy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The maritime exploration of our coast may be said to have fairly
commenced on the morning of the 19th of April, 1770, when Captain
Cook first sighted land. True we had many visitors before, [See
Introduction.] but none had given the same attention to the work,
with an eye to future colonisation, nor sailed along such an extent
of shore.</p>

<p>The present coast of Gippsland was the place that first caught
the attention of Lieutenant Hicks on that eventful morning, and
Point Hicks received its name in commemoration of the incident.</p>

<p>From this point they sailed eastward, and at the promontory,
where the coast turned to the north, the name of Cape Howe was
bestowed. Cook, fresh from the shores of New Zealand and its more
rugged scenery, was pleasingly impressed with his distant view of
Australia, but it must have been the force of contrast only, as the
portion of Australia first sighted by him is devoid of interest. No
available landing place was seen; the shore was too tame, and for
many days they coasted along, looking for a break, or entrance, but
none could he found where a safe landing could be effected.</p>

<p>Botany Bay was the spot where the men from the <i>Endeavour</i>
sprang on shore for the first time, and although the flora of the
surrounding country brought joy to the heart of Mr. Banks, the
botanist, it could not have held out very high hopes of the future
to the others.</p>

<p>Here they first saw the natives, "Indians," as Cook calls them,
and hoped to effect a peaceable landing. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The place where the ship had anchored was abreast of a
small village, consisting of about six or eight houses; and while
we were preparing to hoist out the boat, we saw an old woman
followed by three children come out of the wood; she was loaded
with firewood, and each of the children had also its little burden.
She often looked at the ship, but expressed neither fear nor
surprise. In a short time she kindled a fire, and four canoes came
in from fishing. The men landed, and having hauled up their boats,
began to dress their dinner, to all appearances, wholly unconcerned
about us, though we were within half-a-mile of them. We thought it
remarkable that of all the people we had yet seen, not one had the
least appearance of clothing, the old woman herself being destitute
even of a fig leaf.<br>
<br>
"After dinner the boats were manned, and we set out from the ship.
We intended to land where we saw the people, and began to hope that
as they so little regarded the ship's coming into the bay, they
would as little regard our coming on shore. In this, however, we
were disappointed, for as soon as we approached the rocks, two men
came down upon them to dispute our landing, and the rest ran
away."</blockquote>

<p>For some time they parleyed with the blacks, and threw them
nails, beads, and other trifles, trying to make them understand
that only water was wanted, and no harm would be done them; but the
natives refused all offers of friendship, and three charges of
small shot had to be fired at their legs before they would even
allow a peaceable landing.</p>

<p>Many expeditions were made inland for plants, birds, and
flowers, also to try if some intercourse could be established with
the natives, but after the first contest they would not come near
enough to speak to. Nor did they touch any of the
presents&mdash;beads, ribbons, and cloth, that had been left about
and in their huts.</p>

<p>The great quantity of plants collected here by Mr. Banks induced
Cook to give it the name of Botany Bay. The King's colours were
hoisted each day of the stay, and the ship's name with the date of
the year was inscribed upon one of the trees near the watering
place.</p>

<p>Having now provided a supply of fresh water, the anchor was
weighed on the 6th of May, and they sailed northward. Unaware of
what he had missed, Cook passed the entrance of Port Jackson, and
followed up the coast for over a thousand miles to the north,
without incident or adventure, beyond the routine work of the ship.
But, on June 10th, this quiet was rudely broken by the
<i>Endeavour</i> running on a coral reef when off the site of the
present town of Cooktown. Fortunately a jagged point of coral stuck
in the hole made, and acted as a plug, otherwise this voyage of
Cook's would have proved his last, and the history of this
continent been much delayed and altered.</p>

<p>Passing a sail under the hull, and throwing guns and other
stores overboard, Cook got his ship once more afloat, and took her
into the mouth of a river (now the Endeavour River) where, on a
convenient beach, she was careened, and the carpenters set to work
to repair her, whilst a forge was set up, and the smiths occupied
making bolts and nails. Many animals strange to them were seen, and
among them the first kangaroo. One of the firemen who had been
rambling in the woods, told them, on his return, that he verily
believed he had seen the devil.</p>

<blockquote>"We naturally enquired in what form he had appeared, and his
answer was in so singular a style, that I shall set it down in his
own words. 'He was,' says John, 'as large as a one gallon keg, and
very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept so slowly
through the grass that if I had not been afeared, I might have
touched him.' This formidable apparition we afterwards discovered
to have been a bat. They have indeed no horns, but the fancy of a
man who thought he saw the devil might easily supply that
defect."</blockquote>


<p>Many excursions Mr. Banks and the men made inland, finding one
very useful plant, at the time when scurvy had appeared among them,
a plant that in the West Indies is called Indian Kale, and served
them for greens.</p>

<p>Some communication was established with the natives, but it
ended as usual by their commencing to steal, and having to be
chastised for it. In revenge they set fire to the grass, and the
navigator very nearly lost his whole stock of gunpowder. He was
astonished by the extreme inflammability of the grass and the
consequent difficulty in putting it out, and vowed if ever he had
to camp in such a situation again, he would first clear the grass
around. Leaving the Endeavour River, Cook, after passing through
the Barrier Reef and again repassing it, as he says, "After
congratulating ourselves upon passing the reef we again
congratulate ourselves upon repassing it," landed no more until he
had left Cape York, and there on an island called "Possession
Island," he formally took possession of the east coast of New
Holland, under the name of New South Wales, for his Majesty King
George III.</p>

<p><i>"As I was about to quit the eastern coast of New Holland,
which I had coasted from latitude 38 deg. to this place, and which
I am confident no European had ever seen before, I once more
hoisted English colours, and though I had already taken possession
of several particular parts, I now took possession of the whole
eastern coast, from latitude 38 deg. to this place, latitude 10
deg. 30 min., in right of his Majesty King George the Third, by the
name of New South Wales, with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and
islands situated upon it. We then fired three volleys of small
arms, which were answered by the same number from the ship."</i>
</p>

<p>This ceremony concluded, and rejoicing in the re-discovery of
Torres Straits&mdash;the waters of which had borne no keel since
the gallant Spaniard had passed through&mdash;he sailed to New
Guinea, Cook having thus completed the survey of that portion of
the South Land so long left a blank upon the map, never
returned&mdash;unless his visit to Van Dieman's Land, in 1777, can
be called a visit-to our shores, but the names he bestowed on the
many bays, headlands, and islands of the east coast have clung to
them ever since. So accurate were his surveys, even under extreme
difficulties, that he left little for his successors to do but
investigate those portions of the coast he had been forced to
overlook.</p>

<p>But Cook's fame and career are such household words amongst all
English-speaking races, and the results of his visit to Australia
so extensive, that no space that this history could afford would be
sufficiently large to appreciate the merits of his work.</p>

<p>When Phillip landed in Botany Bay he was followed, as is well
known, by the distinguished French navigator, La Perouse, and
although the name of this unfortunate man does not enter largely
into the history of our colonisation, it is essential that it
should come under notice. After a short stay, La Perouse sailed
from Australian shores, and of him and his stately ships no tidings
ever reached Europe. Years passed, and Captain Dillon, the master
of an English vessel trading amongst the South Sea Islands, found a
sword-belt in the possession of the natives; this led to further
investigations, and the hapless story was finally elucidated.</p>

<p>Wrecked on the coast of one of the islands, and all attempts to
save the ships having proved futile, the crews took to the boats,
only to suffer death from drowning or at the hands of the savages.
The guns and other heavy equipment were afterwards recovered,
proving beyond doubt that that was the end of the French vessels
and their unhappy commander-the Leichhardt of the sea.</p>

<p>In 1791, Lieutenant McCluer, of the Bombay Marine, touched upon
the northern coast of Arnheim's Land, but as he did not land, no
result accrued to the continent from his coming.</p>

<p>Before his advent, however, Captain Bligh, making his way home
from the spot where the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i> had set him
afloat, passed through Torres Straits, and sighted the mainland of
Australia. Situated as he was, he could do little more than take
hasty observations.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards, the <i>Pandora</i>, under Captain Edwards,
struck on a reef in Torres Straits, and sank in deep water.
Thirty-nine of the crew were drowned, and the remainder, destitute
of almost everything, made for the coast of Australia in four
boats. Edwards landed on Prince of Wales Island, but not on the
mainland. He finally reached Timor, with his shipwrecked men,
amongst whom were some of the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>. Many
of these men had been obliged to remain on board perforce, and in
no way participated in that famous mutiny. Their treatment by the
captain of the <i>Pandora</i>, and afterwards by the English
authorities, was both harsh and unjust.</p>

<p>In 1792, the <i>Providence</i> and <i>Assistant</i>, Captains
Bligh and Portlock, sailed through the Straits, conveying the
bread-fruit plant from Tahiti to the West Indies. Serving in this
expedition was Lieutenant Flinders.</p>

<p>In 1791, Captain George Vancouver, on his way to America, came
to the southern shore, and found and named King George's Sound. He
landed and examined the country, but saw nothing of any
consequence, and, after a short stay, sailed away to the eastward,
intending to follow the coast line, but was prevented by baffling
winds.</p>

<p>In 1793, previously to the <i>Investigator</i>, and in the year
following Bligh and Portlock, Messrs. William Bampton and Matthew
B. Alt, commanders of the ships <i>Hormuzeer</i> and
<i>Chesterfeld</i>, sailed from Norfolk Island, with the intention
of passing through Torres Straits by a route which the commanders
did not know had been before attempted.</p>

<p>The terrible dangers of the Straits encountered appear to have
deterred others from following them up to the time of the
<i>Investigator</i>.</p>

<p>Vancouver was quickly followed in the year 1792 by M.
D'Entrecasteaux, who, having with him the ships <i>La Recherche</i>
and <i>L'Espérance</i>, was in quest of the fate of La Perouse. Off
Termination Island-the last land seen by Vancouver&mdash;a gale
sprang up, and the French ships had to seek shelter. They remained
at anchor a week, and the officers made many excursions to the
islands now known as the Recherche Archipelago.</p>

<p>He sailed along some portions of the Great Bight, which he
described as of "an aspect so uniform that the most fruitful
imagination could find nothing to say of it." Water failing him, he
steered for Van Dieman's Land.</p>

<p>We now come across one of the grandest names in the history of
our colony. Bass, the surgeon of the <i>Reliance</i>, whose work
has survived him in the name of the well-known strait.</p>

<p>In a tiny cockle shell, the <i>Tom Thumb</i>, a boat of eight
feet long, he and Flinders, at first but an adventurous middy,
cruised around the coast and examined every inlet and opening
visible, at the very peril of their lives. It is almost equal to an
imaginative story of adventures to read the tale of their various
trips, suffice it they did good work, and came back safely to carry
that work on with better and fuller means.</p>

<p>A voyage to Norfolk Island interrupted their further proceedings
until the next year, 1796. Bass and Flinders then again, in the
<i>Tom Thumb</i>, left to explore a large river, said to fall in
the sea some miles to the south of Botany Bay, and of which there
was no indication in Cook's chart.</p>

<p>In 1797, Bass obtained leave to make an expedition to the
southward and was furnished with a whale boat and a crew of six
men. Although he sailed with only six weeks' provisions, by birds
and fish caught, and abstinence, he was enabled to prolong his
voyage to eleven weeks, and his labours were crowned with a success
not to be expected from such frail means. In the three hundred
miles of coast examined from Port Jackson to Ram Head, a number of
discoveries were made that had escaped Captain Cook.</p>

<p>From Ram Head&mdash;the southernmost part of the coast that had
been examined by Cook-Bass began to reap a rich harvest of
important discoveries, and another three hundred miles followed,
the appearance of which confirmed his belief in the existence of a
strait between the continent and Van Dieman's Land.</p>

<p>It was with great reluctance he returned before verifying this
belief beyond doubt of others.</p>

<p>In September, 1798, we find him on board the <i>Norfolk</i>,
associated with Flinders, seeking to prove his theory. After many
and strong head winds, and much delay, the two had the supreme
pleasure of greeting the westward ocean, and returning to Port
Jackson with the tidings.</p>

<p>Flinders says:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"To the strait which had been the great object of research,
and whose discovery was now completed, Governor Hunter gave, at my
recommendation, the name of 'Bass's Straits.' This was no more than
a just tribute to my worthy friend and companion for the extreme
dangers and fatigues he had undergone in first entering it in the
whale boat, and to the correct judgment he had formed, from various
indications, of the existence of a wide opening between Van
Dieman's Land and New South Wales."</i>
</p>

<p>In 1799, Flinders, in the <i>Norfolk</i>, followed up Cook's
discoveries in the neighbourhood of Glass House Bay, and in 1801 we
must accompany him on his great voyage round Terra Australis.</p>

<p>The north coast of Australia, both from its more interesting
formation and the lack of settlement, has received a good deal of
attention from our navigators of the present century, and by far
the most fascinating part of Captain Flinders' log refers to the
north coast.</p>

<p>In 1802, we find him following the track of M. D'Entrecasteaux
round the Great Bight. Flinders seems to have been as much puzzled
as he was regarding the great extent of level cliffs passed. He
conjectures that within this bank, as he terms it, there could be
nothing but sandy plains or water, and that, in all probability, it
formed a barrier between an exterior and interior sea. He little
thought how, some years afterwards, a lonely white man would tramp
round those barren cliffs, eagerly scanning Flinders' chart for any
sign of a break in their iron uniformity.</p>

<p>On February 16th, 1801, Matthew Flinders was promoted to the
rank of commandant, and left England with the <i>Investigator</i>,
to prosecute his voyage to Terra Australis. His instructions
were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"To make the best of your way to New Holland, running
down the coast from 130 degrees east longitude to <i>Bass's</i>
Straits, putting, if you should find it necessary, into <i>King
George the Third's Harbour</i> for refreshments and water, previous
to your commencing the survey, and on your arrival on the coast,
use your best endeavour to discover such harbours as may be in
those parts, and in case you shall discover any creek or opening
likely to lead to an <i>inland sea or strait</i>, you are at
liberty either to examine it or not, as you 'shall judge it most
expedient, until a more favourable opportunity shall enable you so
to do.<br>
<br>
"When it shall appear to you necessary, you shall repair to
<i>Sydney Cove</i>, for the purpose of refreshing your people,
refitting the sloop under your command, and consulting the Governor
of New South Wales upon the best means of carrying on the survey of
the coast; and having received from him such information as he may
be able to communicate, and taken under your command the <i>Lady
Nelson</i> tender, which you may expect to find in Sydney Cove, you
are to recommence your survey by first diligently examining the
coast from <i>Bass's</i> Straits to <i>King George the Third's
Harbour</i>."</blockquote>

<p>Flinders was then instructed to repair from time to time to
Sydney Cove, to be very diligent in the examination, and to take
particular care to insert in his journal every circumstance that
might be useful to a full and complete knowledge of the
coast&mdash;the wind, weather, the productions, comparative
fertility of the soil, the manners and customs of the inhabitants,
and to examine the country as far inland as it was prudent to
venture with so small a party as could be spared from the vessel
whenever a chance of discovering anything useful to the commerce or
manufacturies of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>From thence they were to explore the north-west coast of New
Holland, where, from the extreme height of tides observed by
Dampier, it was thought probable valuable harbours might be found;
also the Gulf of Carpentaria and the parts to the westward. When
that was completed, a careful investigation and accurate survey of
Torres Straits; then an examination of the whole of the remainder
of the north, the west, and the north-west coasts of New
Holland.</p>

<blockquote>"So soon as you shall have completed the whole of these
surveys and examinations as above directed, you are to proceed to,
and examine very carefully the east coast of New Holland, seen by
Captain Cook, from Cape Flattery to the Bay of Inlets; and in order
to refresh your people, and give the advantages of variety to the
painters, you are at liberty to touch at the Fijis, or some other
islands in the South Seas."</blockquote>

<p>As soon as the whole of the examinations and surveys were
completed, he was to lose no time in returning with the sloop under
his command to England.</p>

<p>The vessel was fitted with a plant cabin for the purpose of
making botanical collections for the Royal Gardens at Kew, and on
each return to Sydney Cove, all plants, trees, shrubs, etc., were
to be transferred to the Governor's garden until the
<i>Investigator</i> sailed for Europe.</p>

<p>King George's Sound being chosen as the place to prepare
themselves for the examination of the south coast of Terra
Australis, they anchored off Point Possession, on the south side of
the entrance to Princess Royal Harbour, previous to wind and water
being favourable for entering the harbour to refit and procure wood
and fresh water.</p>

<p>Many excursions were made by the naturalist, botanist, and
artist, and a new survey of King George's Sound made.</p>

<blockquote>"On the east side of the entrance to Princess Royal
Harbour we landed, and found a spot of ground six or eight feet
square dug up and trimmed like a garden, and upon it was lying a
piece of sheet copper bearing this inscription:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"'AUGUST 27TH 1800. CHR. DIXON.<br>
'&mdash;SHIP ELLEGOOD.'"</blockquote>

<p>This answered the finding of the felled trees on Point
Possession, also of the disappearance of the bottle left by Captain
Vancouver in 1791, containing parchment that Flinders had looked
for on landing.</p>

<p>In Flinders' description of the country in the neighbourhood of
King George's Sound he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The basis stone is granite, which frequently shows
itself at the surface in the form of smooth, bare rock; but upon
the sea-coast hills and the shores on the south side of the sound
and Princess Royal Harbour the granite is generally covered with a
crust of calcareous stone, as it is also upon Michaelmas Island.
Captain Vancouver mentions having found upon the top of Bald Head
branches of coral protruding through the sand, exactly like those
seen in the coral beds beneath the surface of the sea&mdash;a
circumstance which would seem to bespeak this country to have
emerged from the ocean at no very distant period of time.<br>
<br>
"This curious fact I was desirous to verify, and his description
proved to be correct. I found, also, two broken columns of stone,
three or four feet high, formed like stumps of trees, and of a
thickness superior to the body of a man, but whether this was coral
or wood now petrified, or whether they might not have been
calcareous rocks worn into that particular form by the weather I
cannot determine. Their elevation above the present level of the
sea could not have been less than four hundred feet."</blockquote>

<p>On January 4th, 1802, a bottle containing parchment, to inform
future visitors of their arrival and departure, was left on the top
of Seal Island, and on the morrow they sailed out of King George's
Sound to continue the survey eastwards. They anchored on the 28th
in Fowler's Bay&mdash;the extremity of the then known south coast
of Terra Australis.</p>

<p>Off Cape Catastrophe, a cutter, with eight men, was sent on
shore in search of an anchorage where water could be procured.
Nothing of the boat and crew was again seen but the wreck of the
boat showing that it had been stove in by the rocks. After a
careful but hopeless search for the men, their pressing need for
water caused them to abandon further delay, and they left to
examine the opening to the northward.</p>

<blockquote>"I caused an inscription to be engraven upon a sheet of
copper, and set it up on a stout post at the head of the cove,
which I named Memory Cove, and further to commemorate our loss, I
gave each of the six islands nearest to Cape Catastrophe the name
of one of the seamen."</blockquote>

<p>Flinders sailed up the gulf, which he called Spencer's Gulf, and
had a long look towards the interior from the summit of Mount
Brown.</p>

<p>The Gulf of St. Vincent then fell to his share to discover, and
shortly afterwards he met with the French ship <i>Le Géographe</i>
Captain Baudin; says Flinders:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"We veered round as <i>Le Géographe</i> was passing, so
as to keep our broadside to her, lest the flag of truce should be a
deception, and having come to the wind on the other tack, a boat
was hoisted out, and I went on board the French ship, which had
also hove to."</blockquote>

<p>The two Captains exchanged passports and information, but
Flinders was afterwards much annoyed to find on the publication of
M. Péron's book, that all his late discoveries had been
rechristened with French names, and, in fact, his work ignored
completely. Parting from the French ship in Encounter Bay, as he
named it, the English navigator sailed for Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Suddenly coming to the Harbour of Port Phillip, Flinders thinks
he has entered Port Western, but finds his mistake next morning;
then congratulates himself upon having made a new and most useful
discovery, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"There I was again in error, this place, as I afterwards
learned in Port Jackson had been discovered ten weeks before by
Lieutenant John Murray, in command of the 'Lady Nelson'. He had
given to it the name of Port Phillip, and to the rocky point on the
east side of the entrance Point Nepean."</i>
</p>

<p>On the 9th May, the <i>Investigator</i> anchors in Sydney Cove,
and again left in company with the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, on the
morning Of July 22nd, for the examination of the east coast, making
many discoveries before reaching Torres Straits that had escaped
Captain Cook, among others Port Curtis and Port Bowen.</p>

<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i> in consequence of being disabled left the
<i>Investigator</i> on the east coast, and returned to Port
Jackson.</p>

<p>We will again take up Flinders' narrative during his examination
of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which had not been visited since the
days of the Dutch ships. The first point Flinders mentions finding
corroborative of the fidelity of their charts is the entrance to
the Batavia River and there is no doubt that this spot is indicated
by the words "fresh water," in the map accredited to Tasman, as
there is a capital boat entrance of two fathoms to this stream, and
at a comparatively short distance from the mouth of the water at
low tide is quite fresh. This river heads from a plateau of
springs, a tableland covered with scrubby heath, and intersected by
scores of running gullies, boggy and impassable; in fact, the same
country as caused such trouble to the Jardine brothers when they
explored this shore of the Gulf.</p>

<p>From this place, however, Flinders seems very doubtful as to the
identity of some of the rivers laid down. One point, the most
remarkable on the coast, and which Yet was not in the Dutch chart,
Flinders named "Duyfhen Point," and another, he called "Pera Head,"
after the second yacht that entered the Gulf.</p>

<p>At Cape Keer-Weer he fairly gives in that he could see nothing
approaching a cape, but a slight projection being visible from the
mast-head, out of respect to antiquity, he puts it down on his map.
The "Vereenidge River" he concludes, has no existence, and the
"Nassau River" turned out to be a lagoon at the back of a beach.
Still the existence of anything approaching the reality of what was
indicated on the charts, proves that at any rate the ships had been
there, even if they had not kept close enough to the land to be
quite certain of what they saw. So shallow is the approach to this
shore, that when so far from land even at the mast-head the tops of
the trees could only be partially distinguished, Flinders only
found from four to six fathoms of water.</p>

<p>Of the Staaten River he says that&mdash;"Where that river can be
found I know not," and at last he begins to fancy that the
formation of the mouths of the rivers must have altered since
Tasman's time.</p>

<p>Reaching the head of the Gulf, Flinders sighted a hill, which
gave him hope of a change in the flat monotony of the coast he had
now followed for one hundred and seventy-five leagues. This Will,
which turned out to 'be an island, Flinders judged to be a headland
marked on the western side of "Maatsuyker's River." The river he
failed to discover, to the island he gave the name of Sweer's
Island. Here Flinders remained some time, having found fresh water.
and an anchorage adapted to cleaning and caulking his ship. But a
great disappointment awaited him. The report of the master and
carpenter who overhauled the <i>Investigator</i>, was to the effect
that the ship was perfectly rotten. It ends in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"From the state to which the ship seems now advanced, it is
our joint opinion that in twelve months there will scarcely be a
sound timber in her; but that if she remains in fine weather and
happen no accident, she may run six months longer without much
risk."</blockquote>

<p>This was a death blow to Flinders' hope of so completing the
survey of the coast, that no after work should be necessary. Under
the circumstances, he determined to finish the exploration of the
Gulf, and then to proceed to Port Jackson by way of the west coast,
should the ship prove capable, if not to make for the nearest port
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Leaving Sweer's Island, Flinders next investigated Cape Van
Dieman, and found it to be an island, which he called Mornington
Island. Cape Vanderlin of the Dutch was the next point sighted, and
it too was an island, one of the Sir Edward Pellew Group. On taking
leave of this group, Flinders remarks on these discrepancies as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"In the old Dutch charts, Cape Vanderlin is represented to be
a great projection from the mainland, and the outer ends of North
and West Islands to be smaller points of it. There are two indents
or bights marked between the points which may correspond to the
opening between the islands, but I find a difficulty in pointing
out which are tile four small isles laid down on the west of Cape
Vanderlin; neither does the line of the coast, which is nearly
W.S.W. in the old chart, correspond with that of the outer ends of
the islands, and yet there is enough of similitude in the whole to
show the identity. Whether any changes have taken place in these
shores, and made islands of what were parts of the mainland a
century and a half before&mdash;or whether the Dutch discoverer
made a distant and cursory examination, and brought conjecture to
aid him in the construction of a chart, as was too much the
practice of that time-it is not now possible to ascertain, but I
conceive that the great alteration produced in the geography of
these parts by our survey, gives authority to apply a name which,
without prejudice to the original one, should mark the nation by
which the survey was made. I have called the cluster of islands Sir
Edward Pellew Group."</i>
</p>

<p>As no marked change has taken place since Flinders' survey, we
may conclude that his last conclusion is the right one, and that a
great deal in conjecture was brought to bear on the construction of
the chart.</p>

<p>Still following the bend of the gulf, Flinders next ascertained
that Cape Maria was only an island (Maria Island) and so with many
points up to the northern termination of the Gulf. Along part of
the southern and most western shore of Carpentaria many indications
of the Malay visits were found&mdash;scraps of bamboo, rude stone
fireplaces, and stumps of mangrove trees, cut down with iron axes.
When amongst the English Company's Islands, a fleet of proas was
met with, fishing for trepang. A friendly interview was obtained
with them, and from the chief, Pobassoo, Flinders learnt that this
was the sixth or seventh voyage that he had made to the Australian
coast. He had a great horror of the pigs on board the
<i>Investigator</i>, but a decided liking for the port wine with
which he was regaled.</p>

<p>The state of his vessel now decided Flinders to relinquish the
survey, thinking himself fortunate in having escaped any heavy
weather.</p>

<blockquote>"We had continued the survey of the coast for more than
one-half of the six months the master and carpenter had judged the
ship might run without much risk, provided she remained in fine
weather, and no accidents happened; and the remainder of the time
being not much more than necessary for us to reach Port Jackson, I
judged it imprudent to continue the investigation longer. In
addition, the state of my own health, and that of the ship's
company, were urgent to terminate the examination here ...It was,
however, not without much regret that I quitted the coast...The
accomplishment of the survey was, in fact, an object so near my
heart, that could I have foreseen the train of ills that were to
follow the decay of the <i>Investigator</i>, and prevent the survey
being resumed-and had my existence depended upon the expression of
a wish&mdash;I do not know that it would have received
utterance."</blockquote>

<p>Thinking himself fortunate in escaping any heavy weather, he
sailed for Coepang, and from there to Port Jackson.</p>

<p>In July, 1803, in the <i>Porpoise</i>, Captain Flinders, with
the officers and men of the <i>Investigator</i>, left Port Jackson
for England, to procure another vessel to continue the survey left
incomplete on the north coast, but were wrecked on Wreck Reef, and
afterwards taken prisoners by the French.</p>

<p>His subsequent career and early death were both unhappy, and no
effort has been made by either England or Australia to do tardy
justice to his name. After his shameful detention in the Isle of
France, and his reluctant release, he returned to England to find
his rightful promotion in the navy had been passed over during his
long years of captivity, and that the licensed bravo of Napoleon,
General de Caen, had retained (stolen would be the right word) his
private journals; and it was only after much trouble and
correspondence between the two Governments that they were restored.
Flinders completed the work of his life by preparing for the press
his charts and logs, and died on the 14th June, 1814, of-there is
every reason to believe&mdash;a broken heart.</p>

<p>Captain King, when he visited the Isle of France after his
Australian surveys, speaks with pride of the kindly memory
entertained by the residents for the unfortunate Flinders, and the
contempt bestowed upon his cowardly gaoler.</p>

<p>Australia at the time of the explorer's detention was not
certainly in a position to demand his liberation. But what has been
done since? Sir John Franklin, an official visitor to our shores,
erected a memorial to him in the little township of Port
Lincoln&mdash;a tribute to a brother sailor. Ask the average
native-born Australian of the southern colonies about Flinders. He
will tell you that it is the name of a street in Melbourne. In
Queensland, the boy will say that it is the name of a river
somewhere in the colony. That is the amount of honour Australia has
bestowed on her greatest navigator.</p>

<p>What was the fate of his companion, Bass?</p>

<p>After the return from the investigation of Bass's Straits, the
young surgeon shipped on board an armed merchant vessel on a voyage
to South America. At Valparaiso the governor of the town refused to
allow the vessel to trade. Bass, who was then in command,
threatened to bombard the town if the refusal was not withdrawn. It
was rescinded, but, watching their opportunity, the authorities
seized Bass when he was off his guard, and it is supposed that he
was sent to the mines in the interior, where he died. He was never
heard of again, nor was any attempt made to ascertain his fate.</p>

<p>Not only can we admire both of these men for their dauntless
courage, so often tried, but all their work on the coast of
Australia was done with no hope of ulterior gain for themselves;
their one thought was the extension of geographical knowledge and
the benefit of their fellow men.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The voyage of the <i>Géographe</i> and <i>Naturaliste</i>, under
Commander Baudin, was undertaken whilst the explorations of
Flinders were in progress, and their meeting on the south coast,
and the subsequent substitution of French for English names, led to
a very sore feeling on the part of the English navigator.</p>

<p>The expedition was under the special sanction of Buonaparte, and
there is little doubt was mainly dictated by his morbid jealously
of the maritime supremacy of England.</p>

<p>Even at the time when the army of reserve was on the move to
cross the Alps, he found leisure to attend to the details of the
projected expedition and nominate twenty-three persons to accompany
the ships and make scientific observations. "Astronomers,
geographers, mineralogist, botanists, zoologists, draftsmen,
horticulturists, all were found ready in number, double, treble, or
even quintreple."</p>

<blockquote>"Particular care had been taken that the stores might
be abundant and of the best quality. The naval stores at Havre were
entirely at the disposal of our commander. Considerable sums were
granted him for the purchase of supplies of fresh provisions, such
as wines, liquors, syrups, sweetmeats of different kinds, portable
soups, Italian pastes, dry lemonade, extracts of beer, etc., some
filtering vessels, hand mills, stoves, apparatus for distilling,
etc., had been shipped on board each vessel."</blockquote>

<p>Added to which a national medal was struck to preserve the
memory of the undertaking, and unlimited credit opened on the
principal colonies in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Think of Flinders in the crazy old <i>Investigator</i>, of King
and Cunningham cramped up in the <i>Mermaid</i>, where the cabin
was not big enough for their mess-table, and imagine with what
scorn they would have looked on these luxurious preparations.</p>

<p>M. Péron writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"On the shores to which we were destined were many
interesting nations. It was the wish of the First Consul, that as
deputies of Europe, we should conciliate these uninformed people,
and appear among them as friends and benefactors. By his order the
most useful animals were embarked in our vessels, a number of
interesting trees and shrubs were collected in our ships, with
quantities of such seeds as were most congenial to the temperature
of the climate. The most useful tools, clothing, and ornaments of
every sort were provided for them; even the most particular
inventions in optics, chemistry, and natural philosophy were
contributed for their advantage, or to promote their
pleasure."</blockquote>

<p>Certainly if M. Baudin failed it would not be the fault of the
First Consul.</p>

<p>On the 27th of May, 18oi, the coast of New Holland was
made&mdash;"a blackish stripe from the north to the south was the
humble profile of the continent first caught sight of." Their first
acquaintance with the coast was not encouraging. Landing at
Géographe Bay to examine a river reported to be there, the longboat
was lost, a sailor named Vasse drowned, and the <i>Naturaliste</i>
lost two anchors. The ships now parted company, the
<i>Géographe</i> steering north to Dirk Hartog's Road, or Shark's
Bay. Here they waited some time for the appearance of the
<i>Naturaliste</i>, but that vessel not appearing, the
<i>Géographe</i> sailed north, and on the 27th July they were in
the neighbourhood of the much visited Rosemary Island. On the 5th
of August the Lacepede Islands were found and named, but no
landings were effected, and the voyagers described the appearance
of the islands as "hideously sterile."</p>

<blockquote>"In the midst of these numerous islands there is not
anything to delight the mind. The soil is naked; the ardent sky
seems always clear and without clouds; the waves are scarcely
agitated, except by the nocturnal tempests: man seems to fly from
these ungrateful shores, not a part of which, at least as far as we
could distinguish, had the smallest trace of his presence. The
aspect is altogether the most whimsical and savage, at all parts
raising itself into a thousand different shapes of sandy, sterile,
and chalky isles, many of them resembling immense antique tombs;
some of them appear united by chains of reefs, others protected by
immense sand-banks, and all that one could see of the continent
displayed the same sterility, and the same monotony of colour and
appearance. The dismayed and astonished navigator turns away his
eyes, fatigued with the contemplation of these unhappy isles and
hideous solitudes, surrounded, as he views them, with continual
dangers; and when he reflects that these inhospitable shores border
those of the archipelago of Asia, on which nature has lavished
blessings and treasures, he can scarcely conceive how so vast a
sterility could be produced in the neighbourhood of such great
fecundity. We continued to range the coast, which seemed to make
part of the archipelago, everywhere bordered with reefs and
quicksands, against which the sea struck with violence, and varied
itself as it were in sheafs of foam. Never was such a spectacle
before presented to our observation. 'These breakers,'" says M.
Boulanger, in his journal, "'seem to form several parallel lines at
the shore, and little distant one from the other, above which the
waves are seen raising themselves, successively breaking with great
fury, and forming a horrible cascade of about fifteen leagues in
length. We navigated at this time in the midst of shallows; the
lead found only at times six fathoms. Then, though more distant
from the land, we were not out of sight of it. This part of New
Holland is truly frightful. All the islands that we could
reconnoitre presented alike hideous characters of sterility. We
continued to sail in the midst of shallows and sandbanks, compelled
to repeatedly tack, and avoiding one danger only to fall into
another.'"</blockquote>

<p>Their privations were very heavy at this time; the food to which
they had been reduced since their departure from the Isle of France
had affected the health even of the strongest, and the scurvy
increased its ravages. Added to that, the allowance of water
beginning to fail, and their belief in the utter impossibility of
taking any from these shores, the <i>Géographe</i>, after naming
the archipelago of the north-west coast, <i>Buonapartes</i>, a name
now obsolete, sailed for Timor, and here, after a lapse of some
time, was joined by her consort. The stay at Coepang was a long
one, for scurvy and sickness was rife amongst the crews and many
died.</p>

<p>During the time Captain Hamelin of the <i>Naturaliste</i> was
absent from his consort, he had been busy along the coast. The Swan
River was explored by Bailly the naturalist, and the island of
Rottnest examined.</p>

<blockquote>"The River of Swans," says M. Bailly, .'was discovered
in 1697 by Vlaming, and was thus named by him, from the great
number of black swans he there saw. The river cannot be considered
as proper to supply the water necessary for a ship; in the first
place it is difficult to enter, and its course is obstructed by
many shoals and sandbank; and secondly, the distance from the mouth
of the river is too great before we can find any fresh water.<br>
<br>
"In the meantime the days fixed by Captain Hamelin to wait for the
<i>Géographe</i> had expired, and we had heard nothing of her, nor
did it now appear likely that we should obtain any news of her by
staying any longer on this coast, we therefore determined to sail
for Endracht's Land, leaving on this island of Rottnest a flag, and
a bottle with a letter for the Commander, in case he should touch
there."</blockquote>

<p>Leaving the Isle of Rottnest, they sailed north, intending to
examine the shore, but the wind compelled them to keep off the
land. After several attempts they succeeded in keeping near enough
to distinguish the general constitution of the soil, and pronounced
this part of Edel's Land of the same melancholy appearance as the
shore of Leeuwin's Land. On the 9th of July they were in sight of
the Isles of Turtel-Duyf and the Abrolhos, on which Pelsart was
wrecked in the year 1629. Their first care on anchoring in the "Bay
of Sea-dogs"&mdash;or Shark's Bay&mdash;so called by
Dampier&mdash;was to find if the <i>Géographe</i> was there, or had
been there, this being the second rendezvous appointed. No signs
being found, they concluded to wait eight or ten days in the hope
she would appear.</p>

<blockquote>"Our chief coxswain, on his return from the island of
Dirck Hartighs, brought us a pewter plate of about six inches in
diameter, on which was roughly engraven two Dutch inscriptions, the
first dated 25th of October, 1616, and the second dated 4th of
February, 1697. This plate had been found on the northern point of
the island, which for this reason we named Cape Inscription. When
found it was half covered with sand, near the remains of a post of
oak-wood, to which it seemed to have been originally nailed.<br>
<br>
"After having carefully copied these two inscriptions, Captain
Hamelin had another post made and erected on the spot, and replaced
the plate in the same place where it had been found. Captain
Hamelin would have thought it sacrilege to carry away this plate,
which had been respected for near two centuries of time, and by all
navigators who might have visited these shores. The Captain also
ordered to be placed on the N.E. of the island a second plate, on
which was inscribed the name of our corvette, and the date of our
arrival on these shores."</blockquote>

<p>Evidently M. de Freycinet had no such veneration for antiquity,
for on his return from the voyage round the world he subsequently
made, he is reported to have carried the relic home and deposited
it in the Museum of the Institute in Paris.</p>

<p>Having done much to determine the size and formation of the
great bight called Shark's Bay, the <i>Naturaliste</i> resumed her
voyage, and joined her consort at Coepang, finding the
<i>Géographe</i> had arrived there more than a month before. The
<i>Naturaliste</i>, more fortunate than her companion, had few
cases of scurvy on board, owing principally to their many and long
stoppages on shore.</p>

<p>The ships in September took their departure from Timor for Van
Dieman's Land, having on board a large proportion of sick. On
drawing near the coast, the humidity of the climate and short
allowance of water caused many deaths.</p>

<blockquote>"On the 2nd of December, in 15 deg., we observed the
first bird of paradise&mdash;the most beautiful of equatorial
sea-birds. On the 22nd we saw more of them, and on this day we
passed the Tropic of Capricorn. Thus these observations agree with
what is so elegantly said by Buffon on the limits of the climates
in which these beautiful birds are seen.<br>
<br>
"Following the chariot of the sun in the burning zone between the
tropics, ranging continually beneath that ardent sky, without ever
exceeding the extreme boundaries of the route of the mighty stars
of heaven, it announces to the navigator his approaching passage
under the celestial signs.<br>
<br>
"On the 29th of December, the sea appeared covered with janthines,
the most beautiful of the testaceous molusques. This jellyfish, by
means of a bunch of small vesicles filled with air, floats on the
surface of the waters. On this shining shell I discovered a new
kind of crustaceous animal, of a beautiful ultramarine blue, like
the shell; I knew this to be a Pinnothera. This discovery is so
much the more interesting, as it does not appear that any of these
adhesive animals were ever before found in univalve shells. On this
same day died my colleague, M. Levillian. During his stay in
Dampier's Bay, he had made a fine collection of shells and
petrifactions, which form long banks on these shores, and which are
so much the more interesting, as most of them seem to have their
living resemblance at the feet of the same rocks, which are
composed of these petrified shells."</blockquote>

<p>On their departure from Timor the ships sailed for Van Dieman's
Land, having on board a large proportion of sick, and losing many
lives on the way.</p>

<p>Through calms and wind they had much difficulty in doubling Cape
Leeuwin, and on the 10th of January, 1802, they sighted the
southern coast of Van Dieman's Land, and devoted some time to the
examination of that island, finding many discrepancies in the chart
of D'Entrecasteaux.</p>

<p>Sailing up the east coast, the <i>Géographe</i> sighted the
mainland of Australia on the 28th March, near Wilson's Promontory,
most carefully examining and naming all capes, bays, and harbours,
little thinking that they were directly after Flinders. Whilst off
this shore, the encounter with the <i>Investigator</i> took place,
which has before been referred to. After the ships parted, Baudin
continued along the south coast, already surveyed by Flinders,
which he re-christened Napoleon's Land, and in Péron's narrative no
reference at all is made to Flinders' prior investigation.</p>

<p>The French claim to the discovery and names of these shores was
not received in France until after the publication of Flinders'
book, which took place the day after his death.</p>

<p>Throughout the voyage Baudin had greatly embittered himself with
his crew. He showed no sympathy nor care for the sick, and was
harsh and unfeeling in his conduct to all on board; in fact, he is
blamed for the constant presence of scurvy that had decimated his
men. He seemed utterly to ignore all precautions for health, and
refused to take the many preventatives that were accessible to
prevent that dread disease. After the magnificent preparations that
had been made, it is astonishing to read of the state of the ship
before entering Port Jackson. M. Péron writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Several of our men had already been committed to the
deep already more than the half of our seamen were incapable of
service from the shocking ravages of scurvy, and only two of our
helmsmen were able to get on deck. The daily increase of this
epidemic was alarming to an extreme degree, and, in fact, how
should it be otherwise?<br>
<br>
"Three-quarters of a bottle of stinking water was our daily
allowance; for more than a year we had not tasted wine; we had not
even a single drop of brandy, instead was substituted half a bottle
of a bad sort of rum, made in the Isle of France, and there only
used by the black slaves. The biscuit served out was full of
insects; all our salt provisions were putrid and rotten, and both
the smell and taste were so offensive that the almost famished
seamen sometimes preferred suffering all the extremities of want
itself to eating these unwholesome provisions, and, even in the
presence of their commander, often threw their allowance into the
sea.<br>
<br>
"Besides, there were no comforts of any kind for the sick. The
officers and naturalists were strictly reduced to the same
allowance as the seamen, and suffered with them the same
afflictions of body and mind."</blockquote>

<p>With unlimited credit and a princely outfit, this state of
things did not speak well for the captain's management.</p>

<p>The sickness of his crew and want of provisions compelled the
French commander to make for Port Jackson, and on arrival they
heard of the safety of the <i>Naturaliste</i>, that vessel having
parted from them off the coast of Van Dieman's Land and arrived
there earlier, but left in search of them a few days before the
<i>Géographe</i> made the port.</p>

<p>From Port Jackson the <i>Naturaliste</i> went home to France,
the <i>Géographe</i>, in company with a small vessel purchased in
Sydney, and placed in charge of Lieutenant Freycinet, pursuing her
geographical labours in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>The many voyages of Captain P. P. King, son of the Governor of
that name, are some of the most adventurous voyages ever chronicled
in our history. On the 22nd December, in a tiny cutter called the
<i>Mermaid</i>, he left Sydney for the first of his survey trips.
It was the year 1817, and his mission was:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"To examine the hitherto unexplored coasts of New South
Wales from Arnhem Bay, near the western entrance of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, westward and southward, as far as the North-West Cape,
including the opening, or deep bay, called Van Dieman's Bay, and
the cluster of islands called Rosemary Islands, also the inlets
behind them, which should be most minutely examined; and, indeed,
all gulfs and openings should be the objects of particular
attention, as the chief motive for sour survey is to discover
whether there be any river on that part of the coast likely to lead
to an interior navigation into this great continent.<br>
<br>
"It is for several reasons most desirable that you should arrive on
this coast and commence your survey as early as possible, and you
m-ill therefore, when the vessel shall be ready, lose no time in
proceeding to the unexplored coasts, but you are at liberty to
commence your survey at whichever side you may judge proper, giving
a preference to that which you think you may be able soonest to
reach, but in case you think that indifferent, my Lords would wish
you to commence by the neighbourhood of the Rosemary Islands.<br>
<br>
"Either on your way out, or on returning, you should examine the
coast between Cape Leeuwin and the Cape Gosselin, in M. De
Freycinet's chart, and generally you will observe that it is very
desirable that you should visit those ranges of coast which the
French navigators have either not seen at all, or at too great a
distance to ascertain and lay down accurately."</blockquote>

<p>Captain King was further instructed to take from Port Jackson
seeds of all vegetables that he considered most useful to propagate
on the coasts to be visited, and to plant them not only in the best
situations for their preservation, but that, also, they might be in
sight and reach of succeeding navigators.</p>

<p>All notes, surveys, and drawings were to be made in duplicate,
and on every opportunity to dispatch a copy, with full report, of
his progress.</p>

<p>The most important subjects to obtain information on
were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The general nature of the climate as to heat, cold,
moisture, winds, rains, periodical seasons, and the temperature.
The direction of the mountains, their names, general appearance as
to shape, whether detached or continuous in ranges. The animals,
whether birds, beasts or fishes, insects, reptiles, etc.,
distinguishing those that are wild from those that are
domesticated. The vegetables, and particularly those that are
applicable to any useful purpose, whether in medicine, dyeing
carpentry, etc.; all woods adapted for furniture, shipbuilding,
etc. To ascertain the quantities in which they are found, the
facility, or otherwise, of floating them down to a convenient place
for shipment. Minerals, any of the precious stones, how used or
valued by the natives; the description and characteristic
difference of the several tribes of people on the coast. Their
occupation and means of subsistence. A circumstantial account of
such articles growing on the sea coast, if any, as might be
advantageously imported into Great Britain, and those that would be
required by the natives in exchange for them. The state of the
arts, or manufactures, and their comparative perfection in
different tribes. A vocabulary of the language spoken by, every
tribe which you meet, using in the compilation of each word the
same English words."</blockquote>

<p>How much was expected to be accomplished by King with his
company of seventeen, including Messrs. Bedwell and Roe as mates,
and Mr. Allan Cunningham, botanical collector! he also had
"Boongaree," a Port Jackson native, who had accompanied Captain
Flinders in the <i>Investigator</i>, And promised to be of great
service in any intercourse with the natives. Provisions for nine
months were procured, and twelve weeks water.</p>

<p>The <i>Mermaid's</i> outfit being completed too early in the
season to attempt the passage by way of Torres Straits to the
north-west coast, King, rather than remain inactive, determined to
sail <i>viâ</i> Bass' Strait and Cape Leeuwin.</p>

<p>At Seal Island they landed, and searched in vain for the bottle
left there by Captain Flinders, containing an account of the
<i>Investigator's</i> visit, not with any motive of removing it,
but to add a memorandum. On the summit of the island or
rock&mdash;for it can scarcely be called an island&mdash;the
skeleton of a goat's head was found, and near it were the remains
of a glass case-bottle. These, as was afterwards learned, were left
by Lieutenant Forster, R.N., in 1815, on his passage from Port
Jackson to Europe.</p>

<p>Next day they anchored off Oyster Harbour, and examined the bar,
finding they could lie close to the shore. It was convenient for
all purposes, the wood being abundant and close to the waterholes,
which were dug in the sand; so that both wood and water could be
procured without going far away from the vessel, thus preventing
any possibility of a surprise from the blacks.</p>

<p>It was here that Captain Vancouver planted and stocked a garden
with vegetables, but no signs of it now remained, also the ship
<i>Ellegood's</i> garden, which Captain Flinders found in 1802; the
lapse of sixteen years, however, would make a complete revolution
in the vegetation. Cunningham made here a large collection of seeds
and dried specimens from the vast variety of beautiful plants and
flowers.</p>

<blockquote>"A small spot of ground near our tent was dug up, and
enclosed with a fence, in which Mr. Cunningham sowed many culinary
seeds and peach stones; and on the stump of a tree, which had been
felled by our wooding party, the name of the vessel and the date of
our visit was inscribed; but when we visited Oyster Harbour three
years afterwards, no signs remained of the garden, and the
inscription was scarcely perceptible, from the stump having been
nearly destroyed by fire."</blockquote>

<p>Sickness having attacked the crew, little attempt was made to
investigate the west coast, but a straight course was steered to
Cape North-west, that goal of so many navigators. On the 10th of
February, 1818, while at anchor off the Cape, the cable parted, and
they lost one of their anchors, an accident which considerably
endangered the remainder of the voyage, as on the 12th the fluke of
a second anchor broke in consequence of the wind freshening during
the night. Three days afterwards they reached a secure anchorage,
which he named the Bay of Rest, as the crew had been long fatigued
when the found it. Here a landing was effected, and Allan
Cunningham took occasion to measure one of the gigantic ant-hills
of that coast. He found it to be eight feet in height and
twenty-six in girth, which after all is not so large as some to be
seen in that region. All examinations of the country tending to
give King and his companion a very poor opinion of the place; they
left the inlet in which they had found shelter, and the large bay
in which it was situated received the name of Exmouth Gulf.</p>

<p>They pursued their course to the north-east. On the 25th they
arrived at Rosemary Island, so long supposed to mask the entrance
to a strait, and commenced a closer examination of the coast line.
Here the always active botanist planted peach stones, and the party
made their first capture of an "Indian." He and some more were
paddling from island to island on logs&mdash;their only means of
navigation&mdash;and a regular "duck hunt" ensued before one was
caught, and taken on board the cutter by a boat's crew.</p>

<blockquote>"The tribe of natives collected upon the shore,
consisting of about forty persons, and of whom the greater number
were women and children, the whole party appeared to be overcome
with grief, particularly the women, who most loudly and vehemently
expressed their sorrow by cries and rolling on the ground, covering
their bodies with the sand. When our captive arrived alongside the
vessel, and saw Boongaree, he became somewhat pacified, and
suffered himself to be lifted on board; he was then ornamented with
beads and a red cap, and upon our applauding his appearance, a
smile momentarily played on his countenance, but it was soon
replaced by a vacant stare. He took little notice of anything until
he saw the fire, and this appeared to occupy his attention very
much. Biscuit was given him, which as soon, as he tasted it he spat
out, but some sugared water being offered to him he drank the
whole, and upon sugar being placed before him in a saucer, he was
at a loss how to use it, until one of the boys fed him with his
fingers, and when the saucer was emptied he showed his taste for
this food by licking it with his tongue."</blockquote>

<p>He was then restored to his log and around his neck a bag was
suspended containing a little of everything he had appeared to
fancy during his short captivity, this was to induce him to give a
favourable account to his companions. He rejoined his tribe, and
the amused seamen watched the interview on the beach. He was
ordered to stand at a distance until he had thrown away the red cap
and axe that had been given him. Each black held his spear poised,
and a number of questions were seemingly put to him. Upon his
answering them apparently satisfactorily he was allowed to
approach, his body was carefully examined, then they seated
themselves in a ring, he placed in the middle. Evidently he told
them his story, which occupied about half an hour. When finished,
after great shouting, the tribe departed to the other side of the
island, leaving the presents on the beach, having carefully
examined them first. After some days spent amongst this group of
islands, endeavouring to establish friendly communication with the
natives, the little vessel resumed her voyage, and on the 4th of
March anchored in and christened Nickol Bay.</p>

<p>Steering on E.S.E. to Cape Arnheim, where the examination of the
west coast was to commence, they named and passed through Macquarie
Strait, and anchored off Goulburn Island, making a complete survey
of the Bay in which they were anchored, and the surrounding
islands, calling them Goulburn Islands. Here they found traces of
the visits of the Malays on their voyages after trepang, before
mentioned by Captain Flinders, and also could tell from the
boldness and cunning of the natives that they were well used to
visitors; they even had the audacity to swim. off after dark and
cut the whale boat adrift, fortunately the theft was detected
before the boat drifted out of sight.</p>

<p>Their hostile conduct caused much trouble whilst getting wood
and water, so much so, that King determined to finish wooding on
Sims Island to the northward. It was fortunate that they were not
often obliged to resort to the muskets for defence, as the greater
number of the twelve they had taken from Port Jackson were useless,
yet they were the best they could then procure in Sydney.</p>

<p>Meantime Cunningham greatly added to his collection, and took
advantage of a good spot of soil to sow every sort of seed he
possessed, but with little hope of their surviving long; as fire no
doubt would soon destroy all.</p>

<blockquote>"The country, was thickly, in some parts impenetrably,
clothed with eucalyptus, acacia, pandanus, fan-palms, and various
other trees, whilst the beaches are in some parts studded, and in
others thickly lined with mangroves. The soil is chiefly of a grey
sandy earth, and in some parts might be called even rich; there
was, however, very few places that could bear so favourable a
character.<br>
<br>
"The climate here seems to favour vegetation so much, that the
quality of the soil appears to be of minor importance, for
everything thrives and looks verdant."</blockquote>

<p>Whilst on this part of the coast they encountered a fleet of
Malay proas, fifteen in number, but King, with his little unarmed
cutter, did not care to have any communication with such very
doubtful characters.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April, Raffles Bay was found, and named after Sir
Stamford Raffles, and the next day they entered Port Essington,
which was christened after Vice-Admiral Sir William Essington.</p>

<p>King thought that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Port Essington being so good a harbour, and from its
proximity to the Moluccas and New Guinea, and its being in a direct
line of communication between Port Jackson and India, as well as
from the commanding situation with respect to the passage through
Torres Straits, it must at no very distant period become a place of
great trade, and of very considerable importance."</blockquote>

<p>At Knocker's Bay, immediately to the west of this port, the
natives made a very determined attack on the boat, whilst she was
hemmed in amongst the mangroves, but without doing any damage. King
next entered and examined Van Dieman's Gulf, so called by the three
Dutch vessels that sailed from Timor in 1705. The examination of
this Gulf formed a prominent feature in his instructions. Here he
found part of the Malay fleet at anchor, and feeling strong enough
to encounter a few of them at a time, he anchored and allowed them
to come on board. He showed them his rough chart, when they
instantly understood the occupation of the cutter. Like the
visitors who came off to Flinders, they showed a great liking for
port wine. Upon mentioning the natives of the coast, and showing a
stone-headed spear, they evinced great disgust. They called them
"Marega," being the Malay definition of that portion of the
coast.</p>

<p>King, during his survey of Van Dieman's Gulf, found and named
the two Alligator Rivers, afterwards traversed by Leichhardt on his
trip to Port Essington. From the Gulf they sailed to Melville
Island, which was named after the First Lord of the Admiralty. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"We passed round Cape Van Dieman and anchored in the
mouth of a very considerable river-like opening, the size of which
inspired us with the flattering hope of having made an important
discovery, for as yet we had no idea of the insularity of Melville
Island."</blockquote>

<p>Here once more they had trouble with the natives, whose
intercourse with the Malays had made them adroit and treacherous
thieves.</p>

<p>Whilst on shore taking some bearings, the party was suddenly
surprised, and, beating a hasty retreat, the theodolite stand and
Cunningham's insect net were left behind, and immediately
appropriated by the natives.</p>

<p>This stand they obstinately refused to deliver or exchange,
although offered tomahawks and other tempting presents. Once, after
a long discussion, they brought it down to the beach and minutely
examined it, but the brass mountings took their fancy too much to
allow them to part with it, and King could not take it by force
without bloodshed. On the 19th May, Apsley Strait was discovered,
and the second island received the name of Bathurst.</p>

<p>King next surveyed and named the Vernon Islands, and Clarence
Strait.</p>

<blockquote>"The time had now arrived for our leaving the coast;
our provisions were drawing to an end, and we had only a
sufficiency of bread to carry us back to Port Jackson; although we
had been all the voyage upon a reduced allowance; our water had
also failed, and several casks which we had calculated upon being
full were found to be so bad that the water was perfectly useless;
these casks were made in Sydney, and proved-like our bread casks-to
have been made from the staves of salt provision casks: besides
this defalcation, several puncheons were found empty, and it was,
therefore, doubly necessary that we should resort to Timor without
any more delay."</blockquote>

<p>While at Timor, "Dramah," the principal rajah of the Malay
fishing fleet, gave King the following information respecting the
coast of New Holland, which he had frequently visited in command of
the fleet that visits its shores yearly for trepang:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The coast is called by them 'Marega,' and has been
known to them for many years. A fleet, to the number of two hundred
proas, annually (this number seems exaggerated), leave Macassar for
this fishery; it sails in January, during the westerly monsoons,
and coasts from island to island until it reaches the north-east of
Timor, where it steers S.E. and S.S.E., which courses carry them to
the coast of New Holland; the body of the fleet then steers
eastward, leaving here and there a division of fifteen or sixteen
proas, under the command of an inferior rajah who leads the fleet,
and is always implicitly obeyed. His proa is the only vessel
provided with a compass; it also has one or two swivel or small
guns, and is perhaps armed with musquets. Their provisions chiefly
consist of rice and cocoa-nuts, and their water&mdash;which during
the westerly monsoon is easily replenished on all parts of the
coast&mdash;is carried in joints of bamboo. Besides trepang, they
trade in sharks' fins and birds' nests."</blockquote>

<p>Their method of curing is thus described by Flinders:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"They get the trepang by diving in from three to eight
fathoms of water, and where it is abundant a man will bring up
eight or ten at a time. The mode of preserving it is thus&mdash;the
animal is split down on one side, boiled and pressed with a weight
of stones, then stretched open by slips of bamboo, dried in the sun
and afterwards in smoke, when it is fit to put away in bags, but
requires frequent exposure to the sun. There are two kinds of
trepang, the black and the white or grey slug."</blockquote>

<p>From Dramah's information, it would seem a perpetual warfare
raged between the natives and Malays, which was unfortunate for
King, as it would make it a very difficult matter to establish
friendly communication with people who could not be expected to
distinguish between the English and Malays. After a short stay in
Timor, he sailed for Sydney by way of the west coast, and anchored
in Port Jackson on the 29th of July, 1818.</p>

<p>The early loss of the anchors had not allowed King so much
opportunity of detailed examination as would otherwise have been
the case; but much of the work that he had been sent to do had been
carried out; the examinations of the opening behind Rosemary
Island, and of Van Dieman's Gulf, beside the survey of the numerous
smaller openings and islands.</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. Cunningham made a very valuable and extensive
collection of dried plants and seeds; but, from the small size of
our vessel and the constant occupation of myself and the two
midshipmen, who accompanied me, we had neither space nor time to
form any other collection of natural history than a few insects,
and some specimens of the geology of those parts where we
landed!"</blockquote>

<p>The equipment of the vessel for the second voyage, and the
construction of charts of the first, occupied Captain King until
December, when he left Port Jackson to survey the entrance of
Macquarie Harbour, which had lately been discovered, on the western
coast of Van Dieman's Land, and in February, 18ig, he returned to
Sydney.</p>

<p>King now started to return to the scene of his labours, this
time intending to make his way along the east coast and through
Torres Straits. With him went Surveyor-General Oxley, in the
colonial brig, <i>Lady Nelson</i>, to examine Port Macquarie, in
New South Wales, where, it will be remembered, Oxley reached the
coast after his descent of the Main Range. On the 8th of May, 1819,
the two vessels left Port Jackson, and arrived at their destination
in two days. Here, after spending a short time in the necessary
examination, they parted company, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> returning
to Sydney with the Surveyor-General, and the <i>Mermaid</i>
continuing her voyage.</p>

<p>The east coast having been twice surveyed by Cook and Flinders,
there was little left beyond minor details for King to complete. An
opening which had escaped Captain Flinders was examined, finding
good, well sheltered anchorage within. They named it Rodd's Bay.
Amongst other places they landed at, was Cleveland Bay.</p>

<blockquote>"Near the extremity of Cape Cleveland some bamboo was
picked no, and also a fresh green cocoa-nut that appeared to have
been hastily tapped for milk. Heaps of pumice stone was noticed
upon this beach; not any of this production had been met with
floating. Hitherto no cocoa-nuts have been found on this continent,
although so great a portion of it is within the tropic, and its
north-east coast, so near to islands on which this fruit is
abundant. Captain Cook imagined that the husk of one, which his
second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, picked up at the Endeavour River, and
which was covered with barnacles, came from the Terra del Espiritu
Santo of Quiros; but from the prevailing winds it would appear more
likely to have been drifted from New Caledonia, which island was at
that time unknown to him; the fresh appearance of the cocoa-nut
seen by us renders, however, even this conclusion doubtful; Captain
Flinders also found one as far to the south as Shoal Water Bay.<br>
<br>
"In the gullies, Mr. Cunningham reaped an excellent harvest both of
seeds and plants. Here as well as at every other place that we had
landed upon within the tropic, the air is crowded with a species of
butterfly, a great many of which were taken. It is doubtless the
same species as that which Captain Cook remarks are so plentiful in
Thirsty Sound. He says, 'We found also an incredible number of
butterflies, so that for the space of three or four acres the air
was so crowded with them, that millions were to be seen in every
direction, at the same time that every branch and twig were covered
with others that were not upon the wing.' The numbers seen by us
were indeed incredible; the stem of every grass tree, which plant
grows abundantly upon the hills, was covered with them, and on
their taking wino, the air appeared, as it were, in perfect
motion."</blockquote>

<p>King landed at the Endeavour River to build a boat that he had
on board in frame&mdash;in all probability the very same spot that
Captain Cook landed upon forty-nine years before. He took the
precaution to burn the grass that the natives should not attempt
the same trick upon him that they had played on Cook. During the
time the boat was building the inevitable thieving of the natives
took place, and the usual tactics of firing over their heads had to
be resorted to.</p>

<blockquote>"On the 10th of July our boat was launched and
preparations were made for leaving the place which had afforded us
so good an opportunity of repairing our defects.<br>
<br>
"The basis of the country in the vicinity of this river is
evidently granitic; and from the abrupt and primitive appearance of
the land about Cape Tribulation, and to the north of Weary Bay,
there is every reason to suppose that granite is also the principle
feature of those mountains, but the rocks that lie loosely
scattered about the beaches and surface of the bills on the south
side of the entrance, are of quartzoze substance; and this,
likewise, is the character of the hills at the east end of the
northern beach. Where the rocks are coated with a quartzoze crust,
that, in its crumbled state, forms a very productive soil. The
hills on the south side of the port recede from the banks of the
river, and form an amphitheatre of low grassy land, and some
tolerable soil, upon the surface of which, in many parts, we found
large blocks of granite heaped one upon another. Near the tent we
found coal, but the presence of this mineral in a primitive
country, at an immense distance from any part where a coal
formation is known to exist, would puzzle the geologist were I not
to explain all I know upon the subject.<br>
<br>
"Upon referring to the late Sir Joseph Banks' copy of the
<i>Endeavour</i> log, I found the following remark:&mdash;'June
21st and 22nd, 1770&mdash;Employed getting our coals on shore.'
There remains no doubt that it is a relic of that navigator's
voyage, which must have been lying undisturbed for nearly half a
century."</blockquote>

<p>Leaving the Endeavour, the next object of interest they fell in
with was the wreck of a vessel, which, on examination, proved to be
the <i>Frederick</i>, but no signs of the fate of her crew were to
be seen. They next had a narrow escape of being wrecked themselves
on a bank at the mouth of a river running into Newcastle Bay, which
King christened Escape River, and which was afterwards destined to
come into fatal prominence as the scene of Kennedy's death.</p>

<p>Off Good Island, in Torres Straits, the arm of their anchor
broke.</p>

<blockquote>"A remarkable coincidence of our two losses upon the
two voyages has now occurred. Last year, at the North-West Cape, we
lost two anchors just as we were commencing the survey; and now, on
rounding the North-East Cape, to commence our examination of the
north coast, we have encountered a similar loss; leaving us, in
both instances, only one bower anchor to carry on the
survey."</blockquote>

<p>Eleven weeks now since they had left Port Jackson, during that
time King had laid down the different projections of the coast, and
the track within the Barrier Reefs and between the Percy Islands
and Cape York; surveyed Port Macquarie, examined Rodd's Bay, and
constructed the boat at the Endeavour River.</p>

<p>Frequent rain between Cape Grafton and Torres Straits not only
increased the danger of navigation, but the continued dampness of
the small cabins, and&mdash;from the small size of the
vessel&mdash;no stove to dry them, caused much sickness; but on the
voyage from the straits to the western head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria&mdash;Cape Arnhem&mdash;they found drier air, and finer
weather, which soon restored the invalids to perfect health.</p>

<p>King sailed across the Gulf, and sighted the land again at Cape
Wessel, and on the 30th July anchored off the "<i>Cocodriles'
Eylandts</i>" of the old charts. Here King discovered a river which
he named the Liverpool, and is doubtless the Spult of the Dutch
navigators. Up this river, the commander, accompanied by Bedwell
and Cunningham, made a long excursion, but the country was too flat
for him to gain much information.</p>

<p>At Goulburn Island, where they landed at their old watering
place, they were again attacked by their friends, the natives, as
of old. There is no doubt that the bad habits of these blacks had
been induced by their long intercourse with the Malays.</p>

<p>Leaving Goulburn Island they passed round Cape Van Dieman,
steering so as to see several parts of the coast of Melville
Island, in order to check the last year's survey. After rounding
the cape they kept a course down the western side of Bathurst
Island. On the 27th they made land on the south side of Clarence
Strait, in the vicinity of the Vernon Islands.</p>

<blockquote>"This was the last land seen by us on leaving the coast
in May, 1818."</blockquote>

<p>Captain King's next important discovery was the now well-known
Cambridge Gulf. On Adolphus Island, in the Gulf, he buried one of
his seamen, named William Nicholls, and in memorial, the north-west
point of the island was named after him. From this point King was
very anxious to examine the coast most carefully, as the French
ships, under M. Baudin, had seen but very little of it; but he had
been unable to find fresh water in Cambridge Gulf, and his stock
was running low. They were very weak handed, three men, besides Mr.
Bedwell, being ill.</p>

<blockquote>"The greater part of the crew were affected with
ophthalmia, probably caused by the excessive glare and reflection
of the sun's rays from the glassy surface of the sea."</blockquote>

<p>Under these unfavourable circumstances they were obliged to make
for Coepang. King says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"In the space between Cape Bougainville and Cape
Voltaire, which was named Admiralty Gulf, we have given positions
to at least forty islands or islets. Having now emerged from the
archipelago of islands which front this part of the north-west
coast, we seized the opportunity of taking leave of it for the
present, and directed our course for Timor."</blockquote>

<p>Here he heard that some of the crew of the wrecked vessel, the
<i>Frederick</i>, that they had seen on the east coast, had
arrived, but the greater number of the crew in the long boat had
not been heard of.</p>

<p>On the 12th January, 1820, the <i>Mermaid</i> returned to Port
Jackson, having surveyed five hundred miles of coast, in addition
to five hundred and forty surveyed on the previous voyage, and a
running survey of the east coast from Percy Islands to Torres
Straits, which had not formerly been narrowly examined.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>King, now got ready for his third voyage, and on the 14th June,
1820, left Port Jackson to again encounter the perils of the north
coast in his little cutter, with the addition to his company of Mr.
James Hunter, as surgeon.</p>

<p>His late voyage had led him to recommend to vessels the passage
of the Barrier Reef, between the reef and the shore, instead of the
outside passage, that had been usually adopted by northern bound
ships. His start was unfortunate; heavy weather set in, the cutter
lost her bowsprit, and they had to put back. On the way up, after
repairs had been effected, the little craft struck heavily on a
sandbank, and damaged her hull considerably, but the voyage was
continued.</p>

<p>On the 19th of August the voyagers were at their former
anchorage at Goulburn Island, taking in fresh water, and watching
narrowly for their old friends the natives, who were so long in
making their appearance. They cut off Lieutenant Roe, when by
himself, and nearly succeeded in spearing him; he was only rescued,
when quite exhausted, by the boat's crew coming to his
assistance.</p>

<p>King proceeded to examine that part of the north-west coast that
M. Baudin had overlooked, more minutely than he had been enabled to
do before. Reaching Hunter's River on September 14th, an
opportunity was offered for filling the water casks. The harbour of
this river is of considerable size, and in most parts offers good
anchorage, with abundance of fuel and water. The harbour was called
Prince Frederic's, and the sound that fronts it, York Sound.</p>

<blockquote>"After passing Point Hardy we entered a fine harbour,
bounded on the west by a group of islands, and on the east by the
projection of land that forms the western side of Prince Frederic's
Harbour. The flood tide was not sufficient to carry us to the
bottom, so we anchored off the east end of the southernmost island
of the group, which, on the occasion of the anniversary of the late
king's coronation, was subsequently called the Coronation Islands.
The harbour was called Port Nelson, and a high, rocky hill that was
distinguished over the land to the southward received the name of
Mount Trafalgar."</blockquote>

<p>From the alarming increase of the leak which the <i>Mermaid</i>
had sprung, it was found necessary to find a place to careen her
in, in order, if possible, the damage might be repaired, that they
might continue the survey, or, at least, ensure their safe return
to Port Jackson. On the sandy beach of a bay, which they named
Careening Bay, a place was found in every way suitable.</p>

<blockquote>"These repairs were completed by the 28th, but just as
we were congratulating ourselves upon having performed them, a
fresh defect was discovered, which threatened more alarming
consequences than the others. Upon stripping off some sheets of
copper, the spike nails which fastened the planks were found to be
decaying, and many were so entirely decomposed by oxidation that a
straw was easily thrust through the vacant holes. As we had not
enough nails to replace the copper, for that was now our only
security, we could not venture to remove more than a few sheets
from those parts which appeared to be the most suspicious, under
all of which we found the nails so defective that we had reason to
fear we might start some planks before we reached Port
Jackson...When the repairs were completed, and the people were more
at leisure, I made an excursion as far as Bat Island, off Cape
Brewster...Bat Island is a mass of sandstone superincumbent upon a
quartzoze basis, and intersected by nearly vertical veins of white
quartz, the surface of which was in a crystallised state. The floor
of the cavern was covered with heaps of water-worn fragments of
quartzoze rock containing copper pyrites, in some of which the
cavities were covered by a deposit of greenish calcedony. The sides
of the cavern had a stalagmitical appearance, but the recess was so
dark that we could not ascertain either its formation or
extent...On first entering it we were nearly overpowered by a
strong, sulphurous smell, which was soon accounted for by the
flight of an incredible number of small bats, which were roosting
in the bottom of the cave, and had been disturbed at our approach.
We attempted to grope our way to the bottom, but not having a
light, were soon obliged to give up its further examination...From
the summit of this place a set of bearings were obtained,
particularly of the islands to the northward and westward, and Mr.
Cunningham secured here specimens of eighteen different sorts of
plants."</blockquote>

<p>On the 9th, leaving Careening Bay, passing between Cape Brewster
and the Coronation Islands, they enter a spacious sound, which
received the name of Brunswick Sound. And here they also found and
named the Prince Regent's River, afterwards the scene of Grey's
discomfiture. Here it was patent that, in spite of their late
repairs, the cutter leaked so much that, for the safety of the
crew, King had reluctantly to return to Sydney; and when off Botany
Bay, narrowly escaped total wreck during a dark and stormy
night.</p>

<p>The tiny craft that had carried King so far and so safely was
now laid up for repairs, and a brig of one hundred and fifty tons
was purchased and re-christened the <i>Bathurst</i>. On the 26th of
May, 1821, King sailed from Port Jackson upon his fourth and last
voyage to the north coast, accompanied by the merchant ships
<i>Dick</i> and <i>San Antonio</i>, bound for Batavia, who
requested permission to accompany King through Torres Straits.</p>

<p>Meantime, the <i>Mermaid</i> had been thoroughly repaired and
fitted out, leaving Port Jackson to carry the first establishment
to Port Macquarie, on which service she was wrecked.</p>

<p>Their company now numbered thirty-three, but three days after
they left port, King says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"A discovery was made of another addition to the crew.
Upon opening the hold, which had been locked ever since the day
before we sailed, a young girl, not more than fourteen years of
age, was found concealed among the casks, where she had secreted
herself in order to accompany the boatswain to sea. Upon being
brought on deck she was in a pitiable plight...that her
acquaintances, of which she had many on board, could scarcely
recognise her. Upon being interrogated, she declared she had,
unknown to all on board, concealed herself in the hold the day
before the vessel sailed, and that her swain knew nothing of the
step she had taken. As it was now inconvenient to return to put her
on shore, and as the man consented to share his rations with her,
she was allowed to remain; but in a very short time heartily
repented of her imprudence, and would gladly have been re-landed,
had it been possible."</blockquote>

<p>Along the east coast the <i>Bathurst</i> was accompanied by the
<i>Dick</i> and <i>San Antonio</i>, both going north, and near the
wreck of the <i>Frederick</i>, they had a trifling brush with the
natives. While here, Mr. Cunningham visited Clack's reef:</p>

<blockquote>"The reef abounded with shells, of which they brought
back a large collection, but not in any great variety; an
indifferent <i>Cypraea</i> was the most common, but there were also
some <i>Volutae</i> and other shells, besides trepang and
<i>Asteriae</i> in abundance.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Cunningham observed a singularly curious cavern upon the
rock, of which he gave me a description in the following account of
the island:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"'The south and south-eastern extremes of Clack's Island
presented a steep rocky bluff, thinly covered with small trees. I
ascended the steep head, which rose to an elevation of a hundred
and eighty feet above the sea.<br>
<br>
"'The remarkable structure of the geological feature of this
islet led me to examine the south-east part, which was the most
exposed to the weather, and where the disposition of the strata
was, of course, more plainly developed. The base is a coarse
granular, silicious sandstone, in which large pebbles of quartz and
jaspar are imbedded. This stratum continues for sixteen to twenty
feet above the water; for the next ten feet there is a horizontal
stratum of black schistose rock, which was of so soft a
consistence, that the weather had excavated several tiers of
galleries, upon the roof and sides of which some curious drawings
were observed, which deserve to be particularly described. They
were executed upon a ground of red ochre (rubbed on the black
schistus), and were delineated by dots of white argillaceous earth,
which had been worked up into a paste. They represented tolerable
figures of sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards (of which I saw
several small ones among the rocks), trepang, star-fish, clubs,
canoes, water-gourds, and some quadrupeds, which were probably
intended to represent kangaroos and dogs. The figures, besides
being outlined by the dots, were decorated all over with the same
pigment in dotted transverse belts. Tracing a gallery round to
windward, it brought me to a commodious cave, or recess, overhung
by a portion of the schistous sufficiently large to shelter twenty
natives, whose recent fire places appeared on the projecting area
of the cave.<br>
<br>
"'Many turtles' heads were placed on the shelfs or niches of the
excavation, amply demonstrative of the luxurious and profuse mode
of life these outcasts of society had, at a period rather recently,
followed. The roof and sides of this snug retreat were also
entirely covered with the uncouth figures I have already
described.'<br>
<br>
"As this is the first specimen of Australian taste in the fine arts
that we have detected in these voyages, it became me to make a
particular observation thereon. Captain Flinders had discovered
figures on Chasm Island [Note, below] in the Gulf of Carpentaria,
formed with a burnt stick, but this performance, exceeding a
hundred and fifty figures, which must have occupied much time,
appears at least to be one step nearer refinement than those simply
executed with a piece of charred wood. Immediately above this
schistose stratum is a superincumbent mass of sandstone, which
appeared to form the upper stratum of the island."</blockquote>

<p>[Note: "Chasm Island lies one mile and a half from a low point
of <i>Groote Eylandt</i>, where the shore trends southward and
seemed to form a bay. In the deep sides of the chasms were deep
holes or caverns, undermining the cliffs; upon the walls of which I
found rude drawings made with charcoal and something like red paint
upon the white ground of the rock. These drawings represented
porpoises, turtle, kangaroos, and a human hand; and Mr. Westall,
who went afterwards to see them, found the representation of a
kangaroo, with a file of thirty-two persons following after it. The
third person of the band was twice the height of the others, and
held in his hand something resembling the 'whaddie' or wooden sword
of the native chiefs of Port Jackson, and was probably intended to
represent a chief. They could not, as with us, indicate superiority
by clothing or ornament, since they wear none of any kind, and,
therefore, with the addition of a weapon similar to the ancients,
they seem to have made superiority of person the principal emblem
of superior power, of which, indeed, power is usually a consequence
of the very early stages of society."]</p>

<p>From the wreck of the <i>Frederick</i> the crew had been busy
during their stay here procuring all the spars and planks that
would be of use to them, and on the 25th June the <i>Bathurst</i>
got under weigh, and with her two companions resumed their course
to the northward, following the same route as that traversed last
year by the <i>Mermaid</i>&mdash;steering across the Gulf of
Carpentaria to Cape Wessell, which they sighted on the 3rd June.
Anchoring in South-West Bay, they landed at their former watering
place on Goulburn Island, but found the stream had failed, and the
parched appearance of the island showed that the season had been
unusually dry. Leaving South-West Bay, they passed to the eastward
of New Year's Island, and the following day sighted Cape Van
Dieman. Here they parted company with their companions, the
<i>Dick</i> and <i>San Antonio</i>, by an interchange of three
cheers, the <i>Dick</i> having King's letters for conveyance to
England. The course of the <i>Bathurst</i> was now south-west
towards Cape Londonderry, sighting, during the next few days,
Eclipse Hill, Sir Graham Moore's Islands, and Troughton Island.
Light baffling winds detained them for two days in the vicinity of
Cassini Island, and on the 23rd the <i>Bathurst</i> anchored about
half a mile off the sandy beach of Careening Bay.</p>

<blockquote>"As soon as the vessel was secured we visited the
shore, and recognised the site of our last year's encampment, which
had suffered no alteration except what had been occasioned by a
rapid vegetation. A sterculia, the stem of which had served as one
of the props of our mess tent, and to which we had nailed a sheet
of copper, with an inscription, was considerably grown, and the gum
had oozed out in such profusion where the nails had pierced the
bark that it had forced one corner of the copper off. The large,
gouty-stemmed tree on which the <i>Mermaid's</i> name had been
carved in deep indented characters remained without any alteration,
and seemed likely to bear the marks of our visit longer than any
other memento we had left. The sensations experienced at revisiting
a place which had so seasonably afforded us a friendly shelter and
such unlooked-for convenience for our purposes, can only be
estimated by those who have experienced them; and it is only to
strangers to such feelings that it will appear ridiculous to say
that even the nail to which our thermometer had been suspended was
the subject of pleasurable recognition.<br>
<br>
"No water in the gully where last year it was running, and no
sign that it had contained any for some time, yet from the
luxuriant vegetation and verdant appearance of the grass, it was
the more astonishing. After examining the bight to the eastward,
where formerly there had been a considerable stream, all hope of
success in finding water here was given up, and an anchorage made
in St. George's Basin, finding an abundant supply at the cascade in
Prince Regent's River.<br>
<br>
"While the boat's crew rested and filled their baricas, I ascended
the rocks over which the water was falling, and was surprised to
find its height had been so underrated when we passed by it last
year; it was then thought to be about forty feet, but I now found
it could not be less than one hundred and fifty. The rock&mdash;a
fine-grained, silicious sandstone&mdash;is disposed in horizontal
strata, from six to twelve feet thick, each of which projects about
three feet from that above it, and forms a continuity of steps to
the summit, which we found some difficulty in climbing; but where
the distance between the ledges was great, we assisted our ascent
by tufts of grass firmly rooted in the luxurious moss that grew
abundantly about the watercourses. On reaching the summit, I found
that the fall was supplied from a stream winding through rugged
chasms and thickly-matted clusters of plants and trees, among which
the pandanus bore a conspicuous appearance, and gave a picturesque
richness to the place. While admiring the wildness of the scene,
Mr. Montgomery joined me; we did not, however, succeed in following
the stream for more than a hundred yards, for at that distance its
windings were so confused among rocks and spinifex that we could
not trace its course. Large groves of pandanus and hibiscus, and a
variety of other plants, were growing in great luxuriance upon the
banks of the Prince Regent's River, but, unhappily, the sterile and
rocky appearance of the country was some alloy to the satisfaction
we felt at the first sight of the fresh water."</blockquote>

<p>Water had been obtained sufficient to last until October.
Preparations were then made to leave this anchorage, when they
explored Half-way Bay, finding in it a strait that communicated
with Munster Water, so insulating the land that forms the northwest
shore of the Bay. This island was named Greville Island.</p>

<p>Whilst in Hanover Bay, a skirmish with the natives enlivened
proceedings. In spite of all the many warnings the party had
received by this time, they would venture amongst the natives quite
unarmed, and when their men came to their assistance the muskets,
as a rule, would not go off. This time the surgeon, Mr. Montgomery,
was speared in the back&mdash;fortunately, not fatally.</p>

<p>From Hanover Bay, King sailed some distance to the westward,
anchoring on August 21st, near the Lacepede Islands. The next day
Cape Baskerville was named, and the smoke of fires was noticed at
intervals for miles along the shore; from which one might infer
that this part of the coast was very populous. Captain Dampier saw
forty Indians together on one of the rocky islands to the eastward
of Cape Levêque, and in his quaint description of them
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"The inhabitants of this country are the miserablest
people in the world. The Hodmadods, of Monomatapa, though a nasty
people, yet for wealth are gentlemen to these, who have no houses
and skin garments, sheep, poultry, and fruits of the earth, ostrich
eggs, etc., as the Hodmadods have; and, setting aside their human
shape, they differ but little from brutes. They are tall,
straight-bodied, and thin, with small, long limbs. They have great
heads, round foreheads, and great brows. Their eye-lids are always
half-closed to keep the flies out of their eyes, they being so
troublesome here that fanning will not keep them from coming to
one's face; and without the assistance of both hands to keep them
off, they will creep into one's nostrils, and mouth too, if the
lips are not shut very close. So that, from infancy, being thus
annoyed with those insects, they do never open their eyes as other
people; and therefore they cannot see far unless they hold up their
heads, as if they were looking at somewhat over them. They have
great bottle noses, pretty full lips, and wide mouths. The two
fore-teeth of their upper jaw are wanting in all of them, men and
women, old and young. Whether they draw them out or not I know not.
Neither have they any beards. They are long-visaged, and of a very
unpleasant aspect, having not one graceful feature in their faces.
Their hair is black, short, and curled like that of the negroes;
and not long and lank like the common Indians. The colour of their
skins, both of their faces and the rest of their body, is
coal-black like that of the negroes of Guinea. They have no sort of
clothes but a piece of the rind of a tree tied like a girdle about
their waists, and a handful of long grass, or three or four small
green boughs full of leaves thrust under their girdle to cover
their nakedness. They. have no houses, but lie in the open air
without covering, the earth being their bed and heaven their
canopy.<br>
<br>
"They live in companies-twenty or thirty men, women, and
children together. Their only food is a small sort of fish, which
they get by making weirs of stone across little coves or branches
of the sea, every tide bringing in the small fish, and there
leaving them a prey to these people, who constantly attend there to
search for them at low water. This small fry I take to be the top
of their fishery. They have no instruments to catch great fish
should they come, and such seldom stay to be left behind at low
water; nor could we catch any fish with our hooks and lines while
we lay there. In other places, at low water, they seek for cockles,
mussels, and periwinkles; of these shell-fish there are fewer
still, so that their chief dependency is upon what the sea leaves
in their weirs, which, be it much or little, they gather tip and
march to the places of their abode. There is neither herb, root,
pulse, nor any sort of grain for them to eat that we saw, nor any
sort of bird or beast that they can catch, having no instruments. I
did not perceive that they did worship anything. These poor people
have a sort of weapon to defend their weirs or fight with their
enemies, if they have any, that will interfere with their poor
fishery. They did at first endeavour with their weapons to frighten
us, who, lying ashore, deterred them from one of their fishing
places. Some of them had wooden swords, others had a sort of lance.
The sword is a long, straight pole, sharp at one end, and hardened
afterwards by heat. I saw no iron, nor any sort of metal;
therefore, it is probable they use stone hatchets. How they get
their fire I know not, but, probably, as Indians do, out of wood. I
have seen the Indians of Bon-Airy do it, and have myself tried the
experiment. They take a flat piece of wood that is pretty soft, and
make a small dent in one side of it; then they take another hard,
round stick, about the bigness of one's little finger and sharpened
at one end like a pencil; they put that sharp end in the hole or
dent of the flat, soft piece, and then rubbing or twirling the hard
piece between the palm of their hands, they drill the soft piece
till it smokes and, at last, takes fire.<br>
<br>
"These people speak somewhat through the throat, but we could
not understand one word they said...We went over to the islands,
and there we found a great many of the natives. I do believe there
were forty on one island&mdash;men, women, and children. The men,
on our first coming ashore, threatened us with their lances and
swords, but they were frightened by firing our gun, which we
purposely fired over their heads. The island was so small that they
could not hide themselves, but they were much disordered by our
landing. This, their place of dwelling, was only a fire, with a few
boughs before it, set up on the side the winds were off.<br>
<br>
"After we had been here a little while, the men began to be
familiar, and we clothed some of them, designing to have some
service of them for it; for we found some wells of water here, and
intended to carry two or three barrels of it aboard. But it being
somewhat trouble some to carry to the canoes, we thought to have
made these men to have carried it for us, and therefore, we gave
them some old clothes; to one an old pair of breeches, to another a
ragged shirt, to the third a jacket that was scarce worth owning,
which yet would have been very acceptable at some places where we
had been, and so we thought they might have been with these people.
We put them on them, thinking that this finery would have brought
them to work heartily for us; and our water being filled in small,
long barrels, about six gallons in each, which were made purposely
to carry water in, we brought these our new servants to the well,
and put a barrel on each of their shoulders for them to carry to
the canoe. But all the signs we could make were to no purpose, for
they stood like statues, without motion, but grinned like so many
monkeys, staring one upon another; for these poor creatures seem
not accustomed to carry burthens, and I believe that one of our
ship boys, of ten years old, would carry as much as one of them. So
we were forced to carry our water ourselves, and they very fairly
put the clothes off again, and laid them down, as if clothes were
only to work in. I did not perceive that they had any great liking
to them at first, neither did they seem to admire anything we had.
Four men, captured while swimming, were brought aboard; two of them
were middle aged, the other two young men about eighteen or twenty
years old. To these we gave boiled rice, and with it turtle and
manatee boiled. They did greedily devour what we gave them, but
took no notice of the ship, or anything on it, and when they were
set on land again, they ran away as fast as they could. At our
first coming, before we were acquainted with them, or they with us,
a company of them, who lived on the main, came just against our
ship, and standing on a pretty high bank threatened us with their
swords and lances, by shaking them at us; at last the captain
ordered the drum to be beaten, which was done of a sudden with much
vigour, purposely to scare the poor creatures. They, hearing the
noise, ran away as fast as they could drive, and when they ran away
in haste they would cry <i>gurry-gurry</i>, speaking deep down in
the throat. Those inhabitants, also, that live on the main would
always run away from us yet we took several of them. For, as I have
already observed, they had such bad eyes that they could not see us
till we came close to them; we did always give them victuals, and
let them go again." ["Dampier." Vol. I, p464.]</blockquote>

<p>August 20. King, when laying down the plan of the coast upon his
chart, found Cape Levêque to be the point Dampier anchored under
when on his buccaneering voyage in the <i>Cygnet</i>, 1688. In
commemoration of his visit the name of Buccaneer's Archipelago was
given to the islands that front Cygnet Bay, which bay is so named
after his vessel; and on August 26, Roebuck Bay received its name
after the ship Captain Dampier commanded when he visited this coast
in 1699. Their water being nearly out, and the provisions generally
being in a bad state, besides the want of a second anchor being
very much felt, King deemed it prudent not to rely longer upon the
good fortune that had attended them, but to sail for the Mauritius,
entering Port Louis on September 26th.</p>

<p>On November 15th they were again ready for sea, and left the
Mauritius to re-commence their survey on the south-west coast of
New Holland. Sighting Cape Chatham, a course was directed to the
eastward for King George's Sound, where they intended to get wood
and water previous to commencing the examination, and anchored
close to the entrance of Princess Royal Harbour. This harbour not
proving suitable, their old anchorage in Oyster Harbour was taken
up. The luxuriant growth of vegetation had almost entirely
destroyed all traces of the visit of 1818. The garden in which Mr.
Cunningham had planted seeds was covered with three or four feet of
additional soil, formed of sand and decayed vegetable matter, and
clothed with a thicket of plants in flower. The natives appeared to
be very friendly, and some visited the vessel.</p>

<blockquote>"After an absence of an hour our two friends returned,
when it appeared that they had been at their toilet, for their
noses and faces had evidently been fresh smeared over with red
ochre, which they pointed out to us as a great ornament; affording
another proof that vanity is inherent in human nature, and not
merely the consequence of civilization.<br>
<br>
"Two of them were watching a small seal that, having been left by
the tide on the bank, was endeavouring to waddle towards the deep
water. At last one of the natives, fixing his spear in its
throwing-stick, advanced very cautiously, and when within ten or
twelve yards, lanced it, and pierced the animal through the neck,
when the other instantly ran up and stuck his spear into it also;
and then, beating it about the head with a small hammer, very soon
despatched it. This event collected the whole tribe to the spot,
who assisted in landing their prize and washing the sand off the
body. They then carried the animal to their fire, at the edge of
the grass, and began to devour it even before it was dead.
Curiosity induced Mr. Cunningham and myself to view this barbarous
feast, and we landed about ten minutes after it had commenced. The
moment the boat touched the sand the natives, springing up and
throwing their spears away into the bushes, ran down towards us,
and before we could land, had all seated themselves in the boat,
ready to go on board, in as unceremonious a manner as passengers
would seat themselves in a ferry-boat; but they were obliged to
wait whilst we landed to witness their savage feast. On going to
the place, we found an old man seated over the remains of the
carcass, two-thirds of which had already disappeared. He was
holding a long strip of the raw flesh in his left hand, and tearing
it off the body with a sort of knife. A boy was also feasting with
him, and both were too intent upon their breakfast to notice us, or
to be the least disconcerted at our looking on. We, however, were
very soon satisfied, and walked away perfectly disgusted with the
sight of so horrible a repast, and the intolerable stench
occasioned by the effluvia that arose from the dying animal,
combined with that of the bodies of the natives, who had daubed
themselves from head to foot with a pigment made of redocherous
earth, mixed up with seal-oil. Returning on board, the natives were
very attentive to the mixture of a pudding, and a few small
dumplings were made and given to them, which they put on the bars
of the fire-place, but, being too impatient to wait until they were
baked, ate them in a doughy state, with much relish. One of them,
an old man, was very attentive to the sail-makers cutting out a
boat's sail, and, at his request, was presented with all the strips
that were of no use. When it was completed, a small piece of canvas
was missing. After a great search, in which the old rogue assisted,
it was found secreted under his arm. The old man appeared ashamed
and conscious of his guilt, and although he was frequently
afterwards with us, yet he always hung down his head and sneaked
into the background."</blockquote>

<p>So with the exception of a few thefts all communication with the
natives was here carried on in a most friendly manner, and on the
1st of January the anchors were lifted, and the <i>Bathurst</i>
left for Seal Island, where they intended to refit the sails.
Leaving King George's Sound they sailed at a distance from the land
to ensure a quicker passage to Cape Péron, Flinders and M. Baudin
having minutely examined the coast between.</p>

<p>Frederick Houtman's Abrolhos were sighted on January 17th, and
the passage or channel between the Abrolhos Bank and the coast has
been distinguished by the name of Vlaming's ship, the
<i>Geelvink</i>, since she was the first vessel that passed there,
1697. The cliffs of Red Point named by Vlaming partake of a reddish
tinge, and appear to be of horizontal strata; behind Red Point is a
bight, named by the French Gantheaume Bay. Reaching Dirk Hartog's
Island they anchored off Cape Inscription, and searched for the
historical plates, but although the posts were standing, the plates
had been removed.</p>

<p>King found that former navigators had taken that part of the
coast he named Point Cloates for an island, calling it Cloates
Island; the next day Vlaming Head, of the North-West Cape, came in
sight, and a north course bore him to Rowley Shoals, wishing to fix
their position with greater correctness, and to examine the extent
of the bight round Cape Levêque, which during the earlier part of
their voyage they were obliged to leave unexplored. Landing next at
Point Cunningham, Mr. Cunningham botanized with great success; a
fresh stream was running down the rocks into the sea, and at the
back of the beach was a hollow full of sweet water; the heat was
terrible, and the soil of a red coloured earth of a very sandy
nature.</p>

<p>Another anchor lost, in a bay they afterwards called Disaster
Bay. The succession of bad weather, and only one anchor left, made
it desirable to go to Port George the Fourth, as they wanted both
food and water; and during the delay here, a part of the crew in
the boats could examine the islands in Rogers Strait, and trace the
continuation of the mainland, behind the. islands, that forms the
south-east coast of Camden Bay, of which nothing was known; also
continuing the examination of the deep bay behind Montgomery's
Islands, and connect that part with the gulf or strait behind
Buccaneers' Archipelago, which King felt sure existed. Here they
had a most amazing escape, that reads more like fiction than sober
fact. The astonishing influx and reflux of the tides amongst these
islands had been noticed by Dampier, and had led that navigator to
conclude that a strait or large river must be situated near this
part of the coast. Whilst among these islands, King was caught in
one of these tidal draughts during a dead calm. The following is
his description of the position. He was at the mast-head&mdash;his
usual position for conning the ship when near the land&mdash;but
seeing his vessel carried swiftly and, as he thought, inevitably on
the rocks, he descended to the deck:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Happily, however, the stream of the tide swept us past
the rocks without accident, and after carrying us about half-a-mile
farther, changed its direction to south-east, and drifted us
towards a narrow strait separating two rocky islands, in the centre
of which was a large insulated rock, that seemed to divide the
stream. The boat was now hoisted out to tow, but we could not
succeed in getting the vessel's head round. As she approached the
strait the channel became much narrower, and several islands were
passed at not more than thirty yards from her course. The voices of
natives were now heard, and soon afterwards some were seen on
either side of the strait, hallooing and waving their arms. We were
so near to one party that they might have thrown their spears on
board. BY this time we were flying past the shore with such
velocity that it made us quite giddy; and our situation was too
awful to give us time to observe the motions of the Indians; for we
were entering the narrowest part of the strait, and the next moment
were close to the rock, which it appeared almost impossible to
avoid, and it was more than probable that the stream it divided
would carry us broadside upon it, when the consequences would have
been dreadful. The current, or sluice, was setting past the rock at
the rate of eight or nine knots, and the water being confined by
its intervention, fell at least six or seven feet; at the moment,
however, when we were upon the point of being dashed to pieces, a
sudden breeze providentially sprang up, and filling our sails,
impelled the vessel forward three or four yards. This was enough,
but only just sufficient, for the rudder was not more than six
yards from the rock. No sooner had we passed this frightful danger
than the breeze fell again, and was succeeded by a dead calm; the
tide, however, continued to carry us on with a gradually decreasing
strength until one o'clock, when we felt very little effects from
it."</blockquote>

<p>This was the last danger that King was to escape on the
north-west coast, as after a little more examination of the
neighbourhood of this dangerous archipelago, the thick weather and
easterly winds compelled him to relinquish his work and sail for
Sydney.</p>

<p>King left the coast thoroughly impressed with the idea that
behind Buccaneers' Archipelago there was, if anywhere, an opening
into the interior of New Holland; the constant loss' of his anchors
had prevented him from confirming his conjecture; but he had good
reason for then thinking so. In these days of strong, well-found
surveying steamers, it is wonderful to recall the work that King
did in the <i>Mermaid</i>, amongst all the dangers of unknown seas,
and constantly having to get his wood and water in the face of
hostile savages.</p>

<p>It was not long after his return to England, and whilst engaged
preparing his journal for publication, that he heard a settlement
had been founded on Melville Island, one of his discoveries. As
this settlement was in accordance with his recommendation, and a
detailed account of its foundation has not been given in these
pages, the present may be a fitting time to do so.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this settlement was finally, after
many removals, abandoned, and the one established at Port
Essington, when Leichhardt arrived there, was a second attempt at
colonisation.</p>

<p>The <i>Tamar</i>, under captain Bremer, left Sydney in August,
1824, having with her the <i>Countess of Harcourt</i>, and that
ever useful colonial brig, the <i>Lady Nelson</i>.</p>

<p>Arrived at Port Essington, the little fleet anchored off Table
Point, the marines landed, the Union Jack was hoisted, and formal
possession taken of the north coast of Australia, between the
meridians of 129 deg. and 136 deg. east of Greenwich. After the
<i>Tamar</i> had fired a royal salute, and the marines three
volleys, the business of finding a site commenced.</p>

<p>This was no such easy matter, the first object being to find
fresh water; parties were despatched in all directions, but for a
long time unsuccessfully; at last some was obtained at a sandy
point, where there was an old Malay encampment, but it was a
deficient supply, only to be got by digging holes in the sand, and
the inducements for remaining were not considered sufficiently
attractive. An examination of St. Asaph Bay, in Melville Island,
was next made, and possession taken in like manner; but no fresh
water was forthcoming there, and at last, after much searching, a
small river and plenty of water were found in another part of
Melville Island, opposite Harris Island. A point of the land for
the town was fixed upon, and named Point Barlow, after the
commandant. The cove where the ship anchored was called King's
Cove, and the entrance to Apsley Strait, Port Cockburn.</p>

<p>A redoubt was built of logs, seventy-five feet long by fifty
broad, and a ditch dug surrounding it; the quarter-deck guns were
mounted, the colours hoisted, and it was formally christened Fort
Dundas, under a royal salute from itself.</p>

<p>After all this display of enthusiasm and gunpowder, work
commenced in earnest, quarters were built inside the stockade, a
deep well sunk, a wharf constructed, and gardens laid out.</p>

<p>As might have been reasonably supposed, the evil-disposed
natives of the island soon got over their first scare at this
invasion of their territory. At first they came into the fort in
friendly guise.</p>

<blockquote>"I was greatly astonished to see amongst them," says
Lieutenant Roe, "a young man of about twenty years of age, not
darker in colour than a Chinese, but with perfect Malay features,
and like all the rest, entirely naked; he had daubed himself all
over with soot and grease to appear like the others, but the
difference was plainly perceptible. On observing that he was the
object of our conversation, a certain archness and lively
expression came over his countenance, which a native Australian
would have strained his features in vain to produce. It seems
probable that he must have been kidnapped when very young, or found
while astray in the woods."</blockquote>

<p>All this friendliness soon disappeared, the aborigines took to
robbing the working parties of their tools, and spear and musket
soon came to be used on either side. Up to the time the
<i>Tamar</i> left, however, no harm had been done. In all, the
settlement consisted of one hundred and twenty-six individuals, of
whom four were women, and forty-five convicts.</p>

<p>The fortunes of this little colony, and even its existence,
being almost forgotten, it may be interesting to the reader to
follow them to the end. After the <i>Tamar</i> left for India, and
the <i>Countess of Harcourt</i> proceeded on her voyage, the
settlement was left with the colonial brig, the <i>Lady Nelson</i>,
as the nucleus of a fleet, but she sailed for Timor, and was never
heard of again. The hostility of the natives increased, and the
Malays, who were expected to visit and trade with the English, did
not put in an appearance, it being out of the track of their proas;
and of Fort Dundas, of which such high hopes were entertained, in a
few short years not a vestige remained.</p>

<p>At last, what with scurvy amongst the garrison (which,
considering the amount of vegetables grown, should not have been
the case), the incessant feud with the natives, the most gloomy
reports were sent down at every opportunity afforded by a vessel
calling. Latterly, it was unsafe to venture out of the camp
unarmed, and the surgeon and commissariat officer were murdered
only a few yards from the stockade. The public policy pursued was
not of a liberal nature, and it was decided to try the experiment
of a settlement on the mainland.</p>

<p>As it was considered that Port Essington was deficient in fresh
water, Raffles Bay was selected, and two years before Melville
Island was finally abandoned, Captain Stirling, of the
<i>Success</i>, was ordered to proceed there. The settlement was
formed on the 18th June, and in honour of the date, was called Fort
Wellington.</p>

<p>The usual scene of activity ensued, the erection of a house, the
formation of a garden, and finally, the old routine of commencing
intercourse with the natives; then the thieving and the usual
retaliation.</p>

<p>Two shipwrecked men were picked up during the early days of the
settlement, one a Portuguese sailor belonging to the
<i>Frederick</i>, wrecked on the east coast, so often mentioned by
King. This man, in company with two others, had escaped in a small
boat, and reached Port Essington, where his two companions had
died. The other was a Lascar belonging to the ship <i>Fame</i>,
that had been wrecked in the straits. He had been with the blacks
six or seven years.</p>

<p>On the final abandonment of Melville Island, in 1829, the live
animals, stores, plants, etc., were transferred to Raffles Bay, but
although such doleful accounts of the island had been sent down,
Captain Lawes, who visited it only a few months before the removal,
gives a favourable report of its healthiness, and of the success
attending the growth of vegetables and tropical fruits. The same
dismal reports concerning the unhealthiness of the climate were
reported about Raffles Bay, and, much to the surprise of the
commandant, Captain Barker, orders were received to abandon that
place, too, in the same year.</p>

<p>On the 28th of August the abandonment took place. The principal
natives, who had been admitted near the settlement, were taken over
the stockade and garden, and an attempt made to teach them the
value of the fruits.</p>

<p>The whites left behind them orange, lime, and lemon trees,
bananas, in abundance, shaddocks, citrons, pine-apples, figs,
custard apples, cocoa-nuts, sugar-cane, and many other plants. In
addition, paw-paws, bananas, and cocoa-nuts were planted in many
other places where it was thought they would thrive.</p>

<p>Poultry, pigs, a bull and three cows (buffaloes), a Timor horse,
and mare in foal, were also left, in the hope of their increasing.
An old Union Jack was then nailed on the deserted fort, and the
garrison went on board the brig. On notice being given of the
intended removal, a disposition to abscond had been evinced by many
of the prisoners. Some succeeded; the idea being to hide until the
departure of the commandant, and then live with the natives until
the arrival of the Malay proas. All returned and gave themselves up
with the exception of two, and these two were left behind. Their
fate is of course unknown. This was the end of the first attempt at
colonisation of the north coast.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The next voyage of importance in these waters was conducted by
Captains Wickham and Stokes. Few narratives of the survey of our
coasts have read with so much interest as that of the cruise of the
<i>Beagle</i>. Partly is this owing to the intense love of
exploration and discovery that seems to have animated the spirit of
her commander, Captain Lort Stokes, throughout whose journal there
breathes the very essence of genuine enthusiasm. In addition, the
incidents and results of the survey added so much to our knowledge
of Australia, that one can look upon him as a most worthy successor
to Flinders and King.</p>

<p>The <i>Beagle</i> was an old surveying vessel, and Captain
Stokes had served on board of her for nearly eighteen years,
passing through all the grades, from midshipman upwards, in many
parts of the world. She left Plymouth on the 5th July, 1837, under
the command of John Clements Wickham, who invalided in March, 1841,
when John Lort Stokes, lieutenant and assistant surveyor, was
appointed to the vacant command.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Beagle</i>, at her departure from Plymouth, were
Lieutenants Grey and Lushington, on their way to explore the
interior of Western Australia. These gentlemen parted company from
the <i>Beagle</i> at the Cape of Good Hope, the sloop proceeding to
the Swan River. In January, 1838, the <i>Beagle</i> left Swan
River, and sailed north, where, on the 15th, they anchored in
Roebuck Bay, and commenced a search for the much talked of channel
supposed to exist by Captains King and Dampier&mdash;a channel that
would connect Roebuck Bay with an opening behind Buccaneer's
Archipelago, thus making Dampier's Land an island. As was
anticipated by Stokes, this proved unsuccessful, but the stay there
was terminated by an unfortunate but, luckily, not fatal accident,
Lieutenant Usborne being accidentally shot.</p>

<blockquote>"At the time this unlucky accident occurred, some
twenty natives rushed from the concealment, whence they had been,
doubtless, watching all the proceedings of the party, as though
they, designed to bear a part in what probably seemed to them, as
poor Usborne went down, an approaching fray; however, the sight of
the two boats in the distance, which, upon deploying, they had full
in view, deterred them from acting upon any hostile intentions,
supposing such to have existed in their minds. The accident,
however, and their sudden appearance could only serve additionally
to flurry the little party, who had to convey their disabled
officer to a place of safety, and Mr. Helpman, who may well be
pardoned the want of his usual self-possession at such a moment,
left behind a pair of loaded pistols. They would puzzle the savages
greatly, of course, but I hope no ill consequences ensued; if they
began pulling them about, or put them in the fire, the better to
separate the wood and iron, two or three poor wretches might be
killed or maimed for life, and their first recollections of the
'Quibra men,' as Miago calls us, would naturally be anything but
favourable.<br>
<br>
"Thus disastrously terminated our examination of Roebuck Bay, in
which the cheering reports of former navigators had induced us to
anticipate the discovery of some great water communication with the
interior of this vast continent. A most thorough and careful search
had clearly demonstrated that the hoped-for river must be sought
elsewhere."</blockquote>

<p>Touching here and there along the coast, and having occasional
communication with the natives, which Stokes amusingly describes,
they finally anchored in, and christened King's Sound after the
narrow escape that King experienced there from the tidal race. The
point had now been reached where they expected to carry on their
most important operations, and the first question to settle was if
they could rely on fresh water. The delightful verdure that clothed
the country after the long ranges of sandhills, and shores covered
with mangroves, also the fact of many natives living here, would on
any other coast have been looked upon favourably, but upon the
coasts, and in the heart of Australia nature seems to delight in
contradiction.</p>

<p>Heavy rains provided them with an abundance of rain water, and
they collected in the hollows of the rocks several boat loads, so
preventing a more distant search.</p>

<blockquote>"While waiting here a party was made up for the purpose
of penetrating a little way into the interior. Everything wore a
green and most delightful appearance, but the reader must bear in
mind how vegetation had just been forced by heavy rains upon a
light, heated soil, and also recollect that to one who has been
pent up for some time on board ship a very barren prospect may seem
delightful. The country was more open in character than I had
before noticed it, and the numerous traces of native fires which we
found in the course of the excursion seemed readily to account for
this. Indeed, during dry seasons it not infrequently happens that
an immense tract of land is desolated with fire, communicated
either by the design or carelessness of the natives, to the dry
herbage on the surface. The moment the flame has been kindled, it
only waits for the first breath of air to spread it far and wide;
then, on the wings of the wind, the fiery tempest streams over the
hillsides and through the vast plains. Brushwood and herbage, the
dry grass, the tall reed, the twining. parasite, or the giant of
the forest, charred and blackened, but still proudly erect-alike
attest and bewail the conquering fire's onward march; and the bleak
desert, silent, waste, and lifeless, which it leaves behind, seems
for ever doomed to desolation. Vain fear! The rain descends once
more upon the dry and thirsty soil, and, from that very hour which
seemed the date of cureless ruin, Nature puts forth her wondrous
power with increased effort, and again her green and
flower-embroidered mantle decks the earth with a new
beauty."</blockquote>

<p>Leaving this anchorage, another was found in a bay on the
mainland, eleven miles N.W. from a remarkable headland, named by
Captain King Point Cunningham, and remained here a week, by which
time the coast, as far as Point Cunningham, was carefully
examined.</p>

<blockquote>"We named this Skeleton Point, from our finding here
the remains of a native, placed in a semi-recumbent position under
a wide-spreading gum-tree, enveloped, or, more properly, shrouded,
in the bark of the papyrus. All the bones were closely packed
together, the larger being placed outside, and the general mass,
surmounted by the head, resting on its base; the fleshless, eyeless
skull 'grinning horribly' over the right side. The removal of the
skeleton was effected, and presented by Captain Grey to the Royal
College of Surgeons, in whose museum it is now to be
found."</blockquote>

<p>From the summit of Point Cunningham a fine view of the opposite
shore of the sound was obtained. It appeared very rugged and
broken, and from the geological formation of the country, and no
land to the south-cast or south, Captain Stokes' hopes were again
raised of finding the long and anxiously expected river. A singular
cliff on the south-east side of the point is called by King,
"Carlisle Head." Rounding Point Cunningham, they anchored near a
red cliffy head, called by Captain King "Foul Point." It was here
King was compelled to leave the coast, and Foul Point marks the
limit of his survey on the northern shore.</p>

<p>On the 23rd February they crossed the limit of King's Sound, and
entered unknown waters. Here, at Disaster Bay, Stokes was sent in
command of the whaleboat and yawl, to inspect the coast ahead,
whilst the survey of the bay proceeded. On the 26th, Stokes
discovered a new river, which he named the Fitzroy, after his
former commander. Whilst exploring this river, Stokes and his
companions, Helpmann and a sailor, had a most narrow escape. They
had left the boat, and were making their way through the
mangrove-fringed banks on foot to a certain point where they were
to meet the boat again; but rising tide proved so strong that the
boat could not reach them, and although Stokes and Helpman could
swim, the sailor could not, and they would not desert him. There
they had to stand with the tide creeping up their bodies, and watch
the desperate efforts of the crew to contend against its force.
Only when the water was high enough to allow the boat to creep
along the shelter of the mangroves, and they were shoulder deep,
were they rescued.</p>

<p>On the return to the ship, a fresh expedition was immediately
despatched, Captain Wickharn himself taking command, and they
pulled up the Fitzroy a distance of twenty-two miles in a straight
direction, and ninety miles following the bend of the river.
Returning, Stokes had the satisfaction of seeing a monster
alligator reposing on the mud-bank, where he had such a near escape
from drowning.</p>

<p>After a lengthened survey of the sound, the <i>Beagle</i>
returned to Port George the Fourth, where she arrived on the 7th of
April, from whence they made a boat excursion to Collier Bay. Many
natives were seen on the shore, evidently wanting to be friendly.
On board the <i>Beagle</i>, the party had a native of Swan
River&mdash;Miago. He turned out an excellent gun room waiter, and
they hoped that in any communication with the natives he might
prove useful. When off Point Swan, Stokes says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"They closely examined the heroic Miago, who submitted
to be handled by these much-dreaded 'northern men' with a very
rueful countenance, and afterwards construed the way in which one
of them had gently stroked his beard, into an attempt to take him
by the throat and strangle him&mdash;an injury and indignity which,
when safe on board, he resented by repeated threats, uttered in a
sort of wild chant, of spearing. their thighs, back, loins, and,
indeed, every individual portion of the frame.<br>
<br>
"When Captain Wickharn and myself left the ship at Point
Cunningham, in the hope of inducing the natives to return with us,
Miago, hearing of the expected visit, immediately went below and
dressed himself to the best possible advantage. No sooner did the
boat come alongside, than he appeared at the gangway, inquiring,
with the utmost possible dignity, 'Where blackfellas?' and was
evidently deeply mortified that he had no opportunity of
'astonishing the natives.'"</blockquote>

<p>On their return to the ship, from the examination of Collier
Bay, they found the exploring party, under Grey and Lushington, had
arrived on the coast at Hanover Bay, twelve miles away.</p>

<blockquote>"From Lieutenant Grey's description of the tribes his
party had encountered, he must have been among a people more
advanced in civilization than any me had hitherto seen upon this
coast. He found several curious figures, images, and drawings,
generally in colours, upon the sides of caves in the sandstone
rock, which, notwithstanding their rude style, yet evince a greater
degree of advancement and intelligence than we have been able to
find any traces of; at the same time, it must be remembered that no
certain date absolutely connects these works with the present
generation; the dryness of the natural walls upon which they are
executed, and the absence of any atmospheric moisture may have, and
may yet preserve them for an indefinite period, and their history,
read aright, may testify-not the present condition of the
Australian School of Design, but the perfection which it had
formerly attained. Lieutenant Grey, too, like ourselves, had seen
certain individuals, in company with the natives, much lighter in
colour, and widely differing in figure and physiognomy from the
savages by whom they were surrounded, and was inclined to believe
that they are descended from Dutch sailors who, at different times
suffering shipwreck upon the coast, have intermarried with its
native inhabitants; but as no authentic records can be produced to
prove that this portion of the coast was ever visited by Dutch
navigators at all, I am still more disposed to believe that these
lighter coloured people are Malays captured from the trepang
fishers, or, perhaps, voluntarily associating with the Australians,
as we know that the Australian not unfrequently abandons his
country and his mode of life to visit the Indian Archipelago with
them."</blockquote>

<p>From Port George the Fourth the <i>Beagle</i> sailed for Swan
River, where she arrived on the 25th of May. Her most important
discovery during this cruise was King's Sound and the Fitzroy
River. As they neared Miago's birthplace, Stokes says he questioned
him upon the account he intended giving his friends of the scenes
he had witnessed.</p>

<blockquote>"I was quite astonished at the accuracy with which he
remembered the various places we had visited during the voyage. He
seemed to carry the ship's track in his memory with the most
careful accuracy. His description of the ship's sailing and
anchoring was most amusing. He used to say: 'Ship
walk&mdash;walk&mdash;all night&mdash;hard walk&mdash;then,
by-and-by, anchor tumble down.' His manner of describing, his
interviews with the wicked 'northern men' was most graphic. His
countenance and figure became at once instinct with animation and
energy, and no doubt he was then influenced by feelings of baffled
hatred and revenge, from having failed in his much-vaunted
determination to carry off in triumph one of their gins. I would
sometimes amuse myself by asking him how he was to excuse himself
to his friends for having failed in the promised exploit, but the
subject was evidently a very unpleasant one, and he was always
anxious to escape it.<br>
<br>
"We were considerably amused with the consequential air Miago
assumed towards his countrymen on our arrival, which afforded us a
not uninstructive instance of the prevalence of the ordinary
infirmities of our common human nature, whether of pride or vanity,
universally to be met with, both in the civilised man and the
uncultivated savage. He declared that he would not land until they
first came off to wait on him. Decorated with an old full-dress
lieutenant's coat, white trousers, and a cap with a tall feather,
he looked upon himself as a most exalted personage, and for the
whole of the first day remained on board, impatiently, but in vain,
prying into each boat that left the shore for the dusky forms of
some of his quondam friends. His pride, however, could not long
withstand the desire of display. Yielding to the impulse of vanity
he, early the following morning, took his departure from the ship.
Those who witnessed the meeting described it as cool on both sides,
arising on the part of his friends from jealousy; they, perhaps,
judging from his costume that he had abandoned his bush
life."</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Beagle</i> had arrived at Fremantle just in time to allow
her company to share in the annual festivities with which the
inhabitants celebrate the formation of the colony. It may give some
idea of the neglected state of this then infant colony to mention
that during the six months' absence of the <i>Beagle</i>, only one
boat had arrived there, and that, H.M.S. <i>Pelorus</i> from the
Indian station. Communication with the home country was sadly
needed, apart from the wish for news. Necessary articles of home
manufacture or importation were becoming unattainable.</p>

<p>From the Swan River settlement, the <i>Beagle</i> proceeded to
Sydney, passing Cape Leeuwin on the 23rd June, the south-western
extremity of the continent named by the first discoverer in 1622,
"Landt van de Lewin," or the Land of Lions. It was their intention
to pass through Bass's Strait, but the weather had been extreme on
rounding Cape Leeuwin, making that impossible.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th, the south-western extremity of Van
Dieman's Land was seen. Van Dieman's Land, as before noted, was
discovered in 1633 by Abel Janz Tasman, the Dutch navigator, and so
named by him after the Governor of Batavia, under whose authority
his voyage had been performed, but the insularity of the island was
not fully proved until Bass passed through the Strait in 1798.</p>

<p>The bad state of weather detained the <i>Beagle</i> in Hobart
Town for some time, reaching Port Jackson on July 24th.</p>

<p>It was not until the 11th of November that the <i>Beagle</i>
left Port Jackson, and anchored close to the southern shore of Port
Phillip. Surveying operations were set to work in good earnest,
chiefly in determining the position of the mouths of the various
channels intersecting the bank that extended across the entire bay,
three miles from the entrance, then continuing the examination to
the westward. Passing the mouth of the Barwon, the nature of the
country begins to change, and high grassy downs, with rare patches
of woodland, present themselves; then, as they near Cape Otway, a
steep rocky coast, with dense woodland rising abruptly over it.
Cape Otway, being the northern point of the western extremity of
Bass's Strait, is swept by all the winds that blow into that end of
the funnel, and this is the cause of the stunted appearance of the
trees in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Having coasted the northern side of the strait, they cross to
Tasmania to examine the south side.</p>

<p>Again, in May 1840, the <i>Beagle</i> left Sydney to cruise on
the north coast, and explore the north-western part of the
continent, this time taking the inside passage between the east
coast and the Barrier Reef to reach her destination, and after
discovering the mouth of a river near Cape Upstart (the present
Burdekin), and making other minor corrections and additions in
King's chart, the vessel anchored at the new settlement of Port
Essington. In 1829, it will be remembered that Fort Dundas and Fort
Wellington had been abandoned, and it was not until the year 1829
that any fresh attempt was made. The ships <i>Alligator</i> and
<i>Britomart</i>, under Sir Gordon Bremer and Lieutenant Owen
Stanley, were then despatched to Port Essington; but the new
settlement to be formed was intended to be a purely military one,
and although many intending settlers volunteered and sought
permission to try their fortunes, no inducement was held out to
them.</p>

<p>The township (destined to follow the date of its predecessors)
received the imposing name of Victoria. Not long after the arrival
of M. D'Urville with the <i>Astrolabe</i> and <i>Zelie</i> in
Raffles Bay, Lieutenant Stewart, when visiting that bay to invite
the French officers to the new settlement, found nothing remaining
of the old one, but the graves of those buried there; the garden
and stockade had totally disappeared.</p>

<p>Leaving Port Essington, the <i>Beagle</i> discovered a river at
the head of Adam Bay, which was explored for eighty miles, and
called the Adelaide. Here occurred the trago-comic episode that
gave the name of Escape Cliffs to the neighbourhood.</p>

<blockquote>"Messrs. Fitzmaurice and Keys went ashore to compare
the compasses. From the quantity of iron contained in the rocks it
was necessary to select a spot free from their influence. A sandy
beach at the foot of Escape Cliffs was accordingly chosen. The
observations had been commenced and were about half completed, when
on the summit of the cliffs, which rose about twenty feet above
their heads, suddenly appeared a large party of natives with poised
and quivering spears, as if about immediately to deliver them.
Stamping on the ground and shaking their heads too and fro, they
threw out their long shaggy locks in a circle, whilst their glaring
eyes flashed with fury as they champed and spit out the ends of
their long beards (a custom with Australian natives when in a state
of violent excitement). They were evidently in earnest, and bent on
mischief. It was therefore not a little surprising to behold this
paroxysm of rage evaporate before the happy presence of mind
displayed by Mr. Fitzmaurice, in immediately beginning to dance and
shout, though in momentary expectation of being pierced by a dozen
spears. In this he was imitated by Mr. Keys, and they succeeded in
diverting them from their bad designs until a boat landing in a bay
drew off their attention.<br>
<br>
"Messrs. Fitzmaurice and Keys had fire-arms lying on the ground
within reach of their hands, the instant, however, they ceased
dancing, and attempted to touch them, a dozen spears were pointed
at their breasts. Their lives hung upon a thread, and their escape
must be regarded as truly wonderful, and only to be attributed to
the happy readiness with which they adapted themselves to the
perils of their situation. This was the last we saw of the natives
in Adam Bay, and the meeting is likely to be long remembered by
some and not without pleasant recollections, for although at the
time it was justly looked upon as a serious affair, it afterwards
proved a great source of mirth. No one could recall to mind,
without laughing, the ludicrous figure necessarily cut by our
shipmates, when to amuse the natives they figured on the light
fantastic toe; they literally danced for their lives."</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Beagle</i> now returned to Port Essington, first
examining the southern shore of Melville Island. It was a visit not
soon to be forgotten. Here they encountered their first experience
of the green ants. Standing under a tree, whilst taking some
observations, they found themselves covered, and nothing but
undressing, at least tearing off their clothes, relieved them of
the torture. The name of Ant Cliffs records this visit on the south
shore of Melville Island.</p>

<p>Leaving Port Essington for the second time on September 4th,
1839, the <i>Beagle</i> threaded her way through Clarence Straits,
to examine the western entrance, and on the 7th came in sight of
the mouth of an opening not examined by Captain King. The next
morning, with the boat provisioned for four days, they started on
their exploring trip, and named the opening Hope Inlet, to
commemorate the feelings it excited on its first discovery, and the
bay in which it lies, Shoal Bay, it being very shallow at the head.
Another wide opening, some fifteen miles ahead, having a more
favourable appearance, they pulled for it, and reached the entrance
at dark. In the morning, they found themselves at the entrance of a
large and promising harbour, which they at once proceeded to
investigate, and Stokes gave it the name of Port Darwin. Stokes
seems to have been far more anxious to discover a river than a
harbour; the discovery of the Adelaide elated him far more than did
the finding of Port Darwin, and he does not seem to have at all
anticipated finding the site of the future capital of the north,
that was to take the place of all the former settlements. Stokes
returned to the ship, and the <i>Beagle</i> entered the new found
port, and a thorough survey was made. Resuming her voyage, the
<i>Beagle</i>, after examining Port Patterson and Bynoe Harbour,
sailed for a large opening one hundred and forty miles to the
westward.</p>

<blockquote>"Captain King's visit to this part of the coast was in
1819, and under very adverse circumstances; his vessel had but one
anchor left, and the strong easterly winds then prevailing, with
thick hazy weather, rendered his progress into the opening both
difficult and hazardous. After a trial of two days, and having
several narrow escapes from getting on shore, he bore away to
examine the coast to the south-west, where he was repaid for his
disappointment by the discovery of Cambridge Gulf. Thus did the
exploration of this wide and interesting opening fall to our good
fortune."</blockquote>

<p>The explorers had great hopes of finding the mouth of an
important river. These hopes were rewarded by the discovery of the
Victoria, which Stokes, in his extravagant joy, deemed equal in
importance to the Murray. Captain Wickharn bestowed the present
name on it, and the delighted explorers proceeded to trace their
new found stream, and pulled up it thirty miles. After their
return, Lieutenant Fitzmaurice returned, having also discovered a
river more to the eastward, which received the name of Fitzmaurice,
after its discoverer. A long and interesting task now
commenced&mdash;the examination of the new river, and the process
of taking the vessel up as far as possible. After this had been
successfully accomplished, Captain Wickharn being unwell, Stokes
was put in charge of a boat party to follow the river up as far as
possible. Taking the boats as far as practicable, and then forming
a land party, they managed to reach a distance of one hundred and
forty miles from the sea, and finding the river still of
considerable size, and full of large freshwater reaches, Stokes
hugged the belief that at last the highway to the interior was
discovered.</p>

<p>His raptures on this point led to a much higher estimate of the
value of this river being entertained than it deserved; and until
its exploration by Gregory, many shared Stokes' opinion as to its
future importance. The party returned in safety, and on going to
weigh the anchors found them so firmly embedded in the bottom,
which must have been a quicksand, that they had to slip both.</p>

<p>While anchored at the mouth of this river, Stokes went on shore
to take observations, and, when ahead of his companions, was
suddenly surprised and speared by the natives; the wound narrowly
escaped being a fatal one. By December 12th he was sufficiently
recovered to bear the motion of the ship, and sail was made for
Swan River, where they arrived safely, having made some most
important discoveries. A cruise on the west coast, and to Coepang,
followed, and thence they returned by way of the west coast and
Cape Leeuwin to Adelaide.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, 1841, the <i>Beagle</i>, now in charge
of Captain Stokes, Captain Wickharn having gone home on sick leave,
left Sydney for another northern cruise. On the way up the ship
fell in with four merchant vessels, which she convoyed as far as
Booby Island, she herself pursuing her way down the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Their first stay of any length was at Sweer's Island,
and all the coastal inlets in the neighbourhood were well examined,
resulting in the discovery of the Flinders River, on the 20th July,
and of the Albert on the 1st of August. On the merits of this river
Stokes waxes nearly as eloquent as he did over the Victoria, and
once more indulges in excited hopes of reaching the centre of the
continent. At fifty miles from the mouth the fallen logs stayed the
progress of the boats, and the party landed and made an excursion
on foot. Stokes now saw the plains to which he gave the name of the
Plains of Promise, the position of which gave rise to so much
discussion amongst the land explorers in after years. As may be
imagined, the extent of level country, and its apparent richness,
gave rise to much enthusiastic speculation on his part, and he
returned to his ship well satisfied with his work.</p>

<p>During the discovery and examination of the Albert, Mr.
Fitzmaurice had been engaged to the eastward, where he found the
other mouth of the Flinders River, known as Bynoe Inlet.
Unfortunately, another gun accident resulted in his being lamed for
life, a charge of shot having entered his foot. This was the second
accident while in the Gulf, a gun having burst with Lieutenant
Gore, and badly lacerated his hand.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Flinders a native burial tree was
found:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"On the eastern bank rose a tree, the branches of which
were laden with a most singular looking bundle or roll of pieces of
wood. Struck with its appearance, we rested our oars to observe it.
Landing, I advanced for nearer inspection towards the huge bundle
of sticks before mentioned. It seemed almost like the nest of some
new bird, and greatly excited my curiosity. As I approached a most
unpleasant smell assailed me, and on climbing up to examine it
narrowly I found that it contained the decaying body of a
native.<br>
<br>
"Within the outer covering of sticks was one of net, with an inner
one of the bark of the papyrus tree enveloping the corpse.
According to the singular practice of uncivilised peoples of
providing for the wants of those who have nothing more to do with
earthly things, some weapons were deposited with the deceased in
this novel kind of mortuary habitation, and a little beyond was a
rill of water."</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Beagle</i> then sailed to Booby Island, and from there to
Victoria&mdash;the settlement at Port Essington&mdash;which they
found in a comparatively flourishing state. Strange to say, Stokes,
the discoverer of Port Darwin, says of Port Essington:</p>

<blockquote>"As steam communication, moreover, must soon be
established between Singapore and our colonies on the south-eastern
shores of Australia, this port, the only real good one on the north
coast, will be of vast importance as a coal depôt."</blockquote>

<p>Another of the many instances of the hasty and fallacious
deductions of first discovery, a second proof of which was afforded
on the arrival of the <i>Beagle</i> at Swan River, whither, after
calling at Coepang, they directed her course. Here they found the
colonists in a state of doubt as to the existence of an inlet
called Port Grey. A large number of immigrants had arrived from
England, with the intention of settling there, but owing to the
rumours of its non-existence, the name was changed to Leschenault
Inlet. Captain Stokes was asked to settle the question, which he
did by confirming the rumour that there was no Port Grey, and that
the fertile country at the back of the spot indicated had likewise
no existence. Grey, it will be remembered, reported seeing this
available country when on his return from the hair-brained
expedition to Sharks' Bay, and called it the Province of Victoria,
but no subsequent exploration ever confirmed its existence.</p>

<p>The work of exploration by the <i>Beagle</i> now came to an end.
Her remaining cruises in Australian waters were in the
neighbourhood of the south coast and Tasmania. The work performed
by her was more intimately connected with land exploration than
that done by any other survey ship, and her close examination of
the north coast resulted in the discovery of many important rivers.
The Flinders, the Albert, the Adelaide, Victoria, and Fitzroy, all
owe their names to the commander of the <i>Beagle</i>, and with her
last cruise the maritime explorations of Australia may be said to
close.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>By common consent the nationality of the first navigators who
landed on our shores is awarded to the Spanish. Following them came
the Dutch, and, finally, the French and English. And, although the
record of the Spanish visit to our northern coast is but vague, the
fact of their being the first to acquaint the Western nations with
the undoubted existence of a far southern land is generally
allowed. Amongst the people inhabiting the many islands of the
Malay Archipelago and portions of the mainland of Asia, there can
be little doubt that our continent was known, and intercourse of an
occasional kind carried on with its natives. That no permanent
settlement was ever formed, or probably attempted, we may ascribe
to the unpromising nature of the soil, compared to the fertile
islands left by the visitors, and the fact that the products of
which they came in search were mostly found in the sea itself, the
shore only being at times visited for obtaining fresh water or
seeking shelter.</p>

<p>During these visits no inducements would be forthcoming for
undertaking an excursion inland. The monotonous character of the
country would not excite curiosity, and the absence of all
temptation in the way of articles of barter and traffic likely to
be found, would confine their investigations chiefly to the sea
shore. A temporary camp for drying the sea-slugs of commerce, a
refuge for their crafts when the sudden storms of the tropics broke
loose, met all their requirements. It is to the Malay ancestors of
the men whose proas are still to be found fishing among the
outlying reefs of the north, that we must look for the first
discoverers of our island continent, and failing all written record
or existing monument of their doings, search amongst the natives
themselves for confirmation of the fact.</p>

<p>The presence of the bamboo in Arnheim's Land only, and its
indigenous nature, is strong evidence of its Malay origin. It is
found in abundance over this large promontory, and on the banks of
the different rivers and creeks. Its extensive spread and thick
growth point to many centuries of introduction, and that the
Australians first obtained it from their northern visitors is
almost certain. In abandoned camps pieces of bamboo would be left
sticking in the ground, and formed, as most of their camps are, on
the sandy banks of a creek, their growth would be under favourable
circumstances, and their spread down the watercourses rapid.</p>

<p>Amongst all the tribes whose hunting grounds are between Cape
Arnheim, and Cambridge Gulf, the traces of small-pox can be seen
unmistakeably on many of the old men. Some are blind, and deeply
pitted, others but lightly marked. Apparently the disease has worn
itself out, for only the oldest members of the tribes have
suffered. None seem to have it now, nor are the marks of the
disease to be seen on the middle-aged men. The ravages of this
scourge must have been confined to the coast tribes, as no evidence
of its having been amongst the natives of the interior is to be
found. The belt of dry country separating the aborigines of the
plain from those of the sea may have saved the former, as this belt
is often left uncrossed for years. This disease must have been
brought from the north, and the date of its introduction would
probably lie many centuries back.</p>

<p>Many of their customs and tribal rites bear a close resemblance
to some that may be found in the New Testament, and are foreign to
the usual habits of the Australian blackfellow. Add to this an
innate antipathy to the flesh of swine when tasted for the first
time, and it seems evident that some of the laws and traditions of
more civilised nations have drifted down and been partly
appropriated by the Australians.</p>

<p>In many of the sea-coast blacks of the north, sleepy eyes and
straight-cut noses are often prominent, and render some of them
especially remarkable; these features giving their faces an
entirely different aspect to the common blackfellow type adjoining
them inland. That, in the event of the wreck of a proa on the
coast, some intermixture of the races would take place, and the
survivors, perhaps, pass the remainder of their lives amongst the
blacks, is quite possible, seeing that to many of our countrymen it
has happened.</p>

<p>The close acquaintanceship shown by the Malay bêche-de-mer
fishers with the nooks and inlets that are so thickly strewn along
the coast, west of Cape Wessell, appears to be the result of much
old-world seafaring lore, handed down from father to son. Whether
the Chinese ever ventured so far south as Australia cannot be
affirmed with certainty. Accident may have led them to our shores,
but it is scarcely probable that the love of adventure would have
tempted them so far.</p>

<p>Taking, then, the exceptional customs common to the natives of
that portion 'of Australia still visited by the Malays, and seeing
that these customs would only be the outcome of some centuries of
intercourse, it is reasonable to suppose that from these outposts
of Asiatic civilisation came the first adventurous traders to the
lone land of the south. The distinct type of the Australian, while
showing in exceptional cases the signs of foreign blood, precludes
the idea that the continent was peopled from the north; but, at the
same time, it is evident that some rudimentary forms of a higher
development drifted down in after ages from that source.</p>

<p>The effect that the repellant nature of the Australian coast has
had upon the southern progress of semi-civilisation is remarkably
distinct. Each successive wave of improvement from the Asiatic
continent seems to grow weaker and weaker as it travels south,
until it breaks hopelessly on Australia. Nor is it hard to find the
reason. The savage, coming from islands where a rude cultivation of
indigenous fruits, valuable in their nature, had induced primitive
land laws, and consequently settled habitations and a defined code
of laws concerning tribal rights and boundaries, found himself
amongst a nomadic race, trusting to hunting and fishing solely for
the means of existence. The soil, formed of the denudation of the
sandstone rocks, scantily fertilised here and there by the decaying
jungle, presented no field for rude agriculture, even had the dry
seasons permitted; and gave forth no native fruits, save tasteless
berries and half-poisonous roots. No knowledge of minerals would
tempt him into the semi-scorched ranges inland; he would simply see
that life after the old fashion of village existence was no longer
for him, and would become a hunter and fisher like his fellows.</p>

<p>It would have been of inestimable benefit to the Australians,
had tribes from the northern countries, only slightly higher than
themselves in the scale, established a permanent footing on the
mainland, and gradually worked their way throughout the land,
carrying their superior knowledge with them, and having in the
extended area before them a wide field for future development.
Intermixing socially with the aborigines, they would have in a few
generations made an indelible mark upon their mental capacity,
which, after all, is only dormant; and the march of improvement
once set in motion, centuries of confirmed intercourse with races
of greater culture, and the consequent spread of new ideas would
have peopled our continent with a different race to the improvident
native of the present.</p>

<p>But the force of nature was against it; the new land of the
south held forth no inducements even for the pirate or marauder. In
the hand to mouth struggle for existence, not even a supply of food
would be found in a ransacked camp; no land seen tempting
settlement by its luxuriant vegetation and produce. The visitors of
the straits scorned the inhospitable coast, and returned north.
Only those whom ill-fate had deprived of the means of return stayed
perforce, and lost their identity amongst the aborigines.</p>

<p>The white man, when he came, looked upon the country as he would
upon an uninhabited land; the native was too far beneath him to
profit by his coming, no inter-mixture of races could take place,
the difference was too widely marked; and the aborigines of
Australia were from the first numbered amongst the doomed tribes of
the earth. An earlier introduction of the spirit of progress,
however meagre in form, might have saved them. Had our northern
coasts but possessed some lure for Asiatic nations, the story would
have travelled and brought their overflowing population down to
settle the continent long before the advent of our countrymen.</p>

<p>It is an accepted fact that on the continent of Australia proper
there is very little unexplored territory left, and that we pretty
well know what resources, in the way of land, we have still to fall
back upon. This acceptance of our knowledge of the unsettled
regions of our country is both right and wrong. Right, inasmuch
that in a general sense, arguing from our knowledge of climatic
influences in different latitudes, we can infer the particular
nature of a particular district, although untrodden as yet by any
one capable of giving us information. Wrong, in that the
geographical formations of Australia are so persistently
antagonistic that no true nor reliable deduction can always be
arrived at. When I say persistently antagonistic, I mean that the
two formations common to the interior, namely, sandstone and
limestone, produce either a desert or a rich prairie. As a rule, in
the vast interior, still unvisited and unsettled, the conditions
are that the soil either grows grasses and herbs of the most
nutritive character, or such as are totally unfitted to support
graminivorous animal life. And these two conditions we may call
antagonistic, as far as our efforts at practical settlement are
concerned. When the outcrop is limestone, we may reckon on good
pastoral country, and a fair water supply. When the outcrop is the
pure red sandstone, we can hope for little else but the desert
spinifex.</p>

<p>The distinction between these two formations is so strongly
marked that it almost seems that a hard and fast line had, in
places, been drawn between the productive and unproductive portions
of Australia. That these strange and sudden alterations occur right
through the continent, we have the evidence in the diaries of Giles
and Forrest; and although we cannot doubt that a great portion of
unexplored Australia consists of country that will never support
population, we have as yet no valid reason for condemning the
whole.</p>

<p>The continent of Australia contains, roughly speaking, three
millions of square miles less about thirty-five thousand square
miles. It may be summarised as follows: that New South Wales
contains no unexplored country; Victoria, none; Queensland, a small
portion of Cape York Peninsula; South Australia, a considerable
area; and Western Australia, a very great deal. All the important
explorations of late years have been in the last two mentioned
colonies, for the very reason that in these colonies only the
unknown exists. South Australia has at least 300,000 square miles
of unexplored and partly explored country, and Western Australia
can claim more than half a million of miles just touched here and
there by the tracks of Eyre, Gregory, Giles, Forrest, and
Warburton.</p>

<p>In speculating upon the future capabilities of this great
expanse, we must fairly weigh the testimony of these men, and, by
comparison, see what chance we have in the future of finding fresh
pasture lands for the next generation. On the whole the testimony
is unfavourable, but, on close inspection, there are strange
coincidences in their diaries which would lead one to think that,
perhaps, after all the "hopeless desert" that witnessed both their
struggles and successes may yet hold secrets worth knowing and
worth seeking for. In our time we have seen how the desert theory
has been exploded in New South Wales&mdash;forced, as it were,
outside our boundaries by the mere expansion of settlement. It is
but a question of time for the mysteries of the yet unknown
interior to share the same fate, and in the solution of the unknown
great possibilities exist.</p>

<p>The development of the towns along the northern sea-board must
necessarily be rapid. From the sheep-growing downs of the inland
plateau, to the sugar and coffee-growing flats of the coast, the
exports will be ever on the increase, and the wants of a growing
people will necessitate ports in places that are now uninhabited.
That the north will become one of the richest portions of our
continent there is no doubt; its immense mineral wealth stands but
partially revealed, while its adaptability for settlement is
practically unbounded. The progress and utilisation of the waste
lands of the north will be an interesting experiment to watch.
Nature has, to a great extent, indicated the laws of settlement
that will dominate the territory. To the capitalist she has given
the rich wool-growing slopes of the inland country, where the
expenditure of money is necessary, in order that the full value may
be reaped from the land leased; money expended in water-storage,
that repays the owner in a hundred ways. To the man of humbler
means the well-watered coast districts offer facilities for small
cattle stations and selections, and on the banks of some of the
rivers the planter will soon be making a home, whilst for the
miners are the broken ranges and gullies of the Dividing Range.</p>

<p>A settled Australia&mdash;that is, comparatively settled-this
century may not witness, but that it will be a fact of the future,
few, who have lived in the colonies during the last two decades,
can doubt.</p>

<p>We may look forward to the crowning work of the future, when we
shall no longer be altogether dependent upon the caprices of
climate; nor sit idly by whilst our heritage of rainfall rushes
past us into the ocean.</p>

<p>From the arrival of Governor Phillip with the first fleet, 1789,
to the year 1813, when Wentworth, Lawson, and Blaxland succeeded in
crossing the main range&mdash;the Blue Mountains&mdash;all attempts
at exploration into the interior had been limited, the main range
proving an impenetrable barrier. For the wants of the colony, the
country up to that time found had proved sufficient. In the
neighbourhood of Sydney, the Nepean, Grose, and Hawkesbury; to the
north, the River Hunter; and to the south, the district known now
as the Illawarra. But combined with the severe drought of 18 13,
and the increase of stock, it was necessary to seek pastures
new.</p>

<p>Their hopes of finding a navigable river flowing west into the
sea were never realised, although for years it was each explorer's
dream. On following a stream, they invariably found it run out into
a shallow swamp, and then thought the continent possessed an inland
sea or lake. Oxley pronounced this portion desert, and to them it
then was; no thought could enter their minds of how after years of
stocking, the entire country would change; how time and labour
alone could make that vast waste profitable.</p>

<p>Directly the pass of the Blue Mountains had been won, and a
public road made across the range, settlers with their stock
steadily flowed west; the township of Bathurst sprang up, and
settlement was made south towards the Shoalhaven River. The first
large expedition into the interior was undertaken by Oxley, and he
again comes to the conclusion that "the interior westward of a
certain meridian is uninhabitable, deprived, as it is, of wood,
water, and grass...that the interior of this vast country is a
marsh, and uninhabitable." Only the edge of the interior crossed,
it was early to come to this conclusion. But we must remember that
the party were weary and disgusted with their want of success-the
barren country, with no variety of trees, or soil; everything
always the same. Eventually they reached good, well-watered
country, and turning back from the Macquarie, delighted with the
river, believed that the high road to the interior had been
found.</p>

<p>This trip successful, he again left to follow the Macquarie, and
although the inland sea remained undiscovered, large tracts of
fertile country were opened for settlement; moreover, he had
crossed the coast range to the north, and discovered that Port
Macquarie (which, on following down the River Hastings, he had
found and named) proved a practicable route to the interior.</p>

<p>About this time the pioneer squatter took share with the
explorer, and settlement quickly advanced. Lawson and Scott were
disappointed in their attempt to reach Oxley's discovery of
Liverpool Plains; unable to penetrate the southern boundary of the
plains, they discovered the Goulburn River. The year 1823 found
Oxley, Cunningham, and Currie, all out in different directions;
Currie to the south of Lake George, Cunningham engaged north of
Bathurst, first in his capacity of botanist, and the discovery of a
pass through the northern range on Liverpool Plains, which Lawson
and Scott had sought in vain. He found and named the Pandora Pass,
it proving practicable as a stock route.</p>

<p>Oxley then left Sydney in the <i>Mermaid</i>, to examine the
inlets of Port Curtis, Moreton Bay, and Port Bowen, with a view to
forming a penal settlement there. It was on this trip, while at
Moreton Bay, that they rescued from the blacks the two men Pamphlet
and Finnigan, who had been wrecked at Moreton Island seven months
before. Oxley named the Brisbane River. This was his last work, and
he died near Sydney in 1828. His career as an explorer was very
successful. He had done much to aid the new colony, but was ever
disappointed in his hopes of reaching the inland sea or lake, and
of proving, except to his own satisfaction, whether any large
rivers entered the sea between Cape Otway and Spencer's Gulf. Then
Sir Thomas Brisbane thought of landing a party of prisoners near
Wilson's Promontory, and by offer of a free pardon and a land
grant, to find their way back to Sydney.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume, the first Australian-born explorer, and Mr. Hovell,
took a party from Lake George, at that time the most outside
station, to Western Port, and they were the first to see the
Australian Alps. This trip helped to prove the hasty condemnation
of Oxley's "desert" theory, and besides giving to the colony
millions of acres of well-watered fertile country, and adding
another large and important river&mdash;the Murray&mdash;it also
held out far higher hopes for the future of the interior. During
this time a settlement was formed at Moreton Bay, and subsequently
removed to a better site on the Brisbane River. Cunningham, in
1827, left on a trip destined materially to effect the immediate
progress of this new colony. Crossing Oxley's track, and entering
the unexplored region, after naming the Gwydir and Dumaresque
Rivers, he finally emerged on the Darling Downs. He was in raptures
at the inexhaustible range of cattle pasture, the permanent water,
and the grass and herbage generally. Then a passage across the
range to Moreton Bay was found by way of Cunningham's Gap, but it
was not used until the next year, when, accompanied by Mr. Frazer,
colonial botanist, they proceeded by sea to Moreton Bay, and
connected the settlement with the Darling Downs. How easy was the
main range crossed here, and the fertile downs laid open, compared
to the years of labour spent on the pass of the Blue Mountains. In
the year following Cunningham made his last expedition, closing ten
years of unceasing work in the cause of exploration.</p>

<p>Sturt followed Oxley's tracks. He exposed some of Oxley's
mistakes, but only to make others as great; for the land was
smitten with drought, and the rivers that Oxley had followed were
now mere creeks, and in passing judgment no allowance was made for
the seasons, and the country was valued according to the standard
of other countries. His descriptions of the interior are wonderful
pictures of the desolate, waterless, abandoned desert, "I scorched
beneath a lurid sun of burning fire." His mission was to ascertain
what lay beyond the shallow bed of reeds to the westward, in which
Oxley lost the Macquarie; but as suddenly and as mysteriously the
river ran out, and they were as completely baffled as Oxley had
been. Dry on all sides, nothing was found but stony ridges or open
forest, the country was monotonously level, and no sign of a river.
Creek after creek they followed, only to lose it in a marsh.
Suddenly they found themselves on the banks of a noble river, and
from its size and saltness, Sturt conjectured he was near its
confluence with an inland sea; but to be convinced in a few more
days that the saltness was of local origin, fed by saline springs.
This river Sturt called the Darling. The homeward march began, and
the same harassing hunt for water; no break in the country, or
change in the vegetation; all brown, blank, and desolate; not even
inhabited by a bird-the drought had so long continued. Sturt had
found the Darling, and he it was who eventually traced its course
and outlet. Starting for that purpose the next year, they sailed
down the Murray, proving its confluence with the Darling, and on
down the united streams of the Murray and Darling with boundless
flats on each side. The river widened day by day; the flight of
sea-gulls, and the chopping sea caused by the wind, surely showed
they were near the ocean. Still, Sturt had reached his
goal&mdash;the Murray ended in a lake. They had hoped that succour
would have waited them, had the ocean been reached. Now they must
re-enter the Murray while the weary party had still strength to
face each day's never-ending toil, and return to the camp on the
Murrumbidgee. The great satisfaction of having successfully
followed the course of the Murray was damped by the apparently
valueless nature of the country passed through. And this trip,
while adding greatly to Australian geography, gave a proof of the
most patient endurance and courage&mdash;even to heroism&mdash;not
excelled in the many records of bravery and dangers undergone by
other explorers.</p>

<p>We have now looked through the reports of the country given by
many men, and become familiar with their opinions of the future of
the interior; they are almost unanimous in pronouncing it barren
and uninhabitable. We must remember it was not their want of
ability, but their inexperience of the value of the native grasses
and herbs. In comparison with other countries, they appeared
worthless. They did not realize that stocking would force the
waters into natural channels, and that the stock would bring fresh
grasses in their train, getting accustomed to and, after a while,
fattening on the despised bushes and herbs. To them it was the
embodiment of a desert&mdash;irreclaimable.</p>

<p>During the time these explorations were in progress, a
settlement had been formed in Western Australia, and some attempt
at exploration made, but for a few years not to any great distance.
No difficulties here presented themselves to a passage through the
coast range, and the country discovered seemed fitted both for
pasture and agriculture.</p>

<p>For many years little was done in the way of fresh expeditions,
until the year 1831. Major Mitchell in charge of a party traced the
rivers, discovered by Oxley and Cunningham; his explorations were
also surveys and the river system of the continent was partially
worked out, but the hope of a river running through the interior to
the north-west coast bad to be finally abandoned. His report of the
country was also more favourable, and his after expeditions, merely
connecting surveys, confirming and verifying previous discoveries,
rather than an exploration into the unknown. His reports were
glowing of the country passed through generally; from snow-topped
mountains to level plains, watered with permanent streams and
rivers, fitted for immediate occupation of the grazier or
farmer.</p>

<p>Now it may be said the difficulties were overcome of entering
the interior, for it was assailed from three points; Perth on the
west, Port Phillip and St. Vincent's Gulf on the south, and from
the settled parts of New South Wales and Moreton Bay on the east.
Henceforth the settler so promptly followed the explorer, that the
country became settled and stocked almost as quickly as known, and,
foot by foot, the desert driven back.</p>

<p>Grey and Lushington wishing to verify the existence or not of a
large river supposed to empty itself into the sea, at Dampier's
Archipelago, endured great hardships. They were without experience
of the colonies, or of the capabilities of the country; but as far
as they could judge, pronounced the country well grassed and
timbered. Their second trip resulted in the discovery of the
Gascoigne, but little else; no great results to compensate for
their terrible suffering and privation.</p>

<p>Small explorations were rapidly carried on to provide for the
number of stock imported and the best stock routes; and now it was
time to turn north, to look for the inland sea and the chain of
mountains&mdash;Australia's backbone&mdash;that was supposed to
exist. E. J. Eyre's discovery of Lake Torrens turned the colonists'
attention north as a practicable stock route to Western Australia.
From the sterile nature of the coast of the bight, and the absence
of any rivers emptying into the sea, it was useless to seek in that
direction. His march round the Great Bight was a journey of
terrible suffering; it certainly proved that no water flowed into
the south coast, and gave us our knowledge of the barren country
shut in by the impenetrable, monotonous cliff line that closed its
secrets against our mariners, but it gave no knowledge of the
interior. After some of his men had deserted, and the one that
remained murdered, Eyre, alone, on foot, with his stubborn courage,
wearied out and starving, followed the coast line for numberless
miles. Any errors of judgment leading to the tragic end of his
expedition must needs be overlooked in the face of the great
dangers and the perseverance that carried him through.</p>

<p>Sturt has been called the father of Australian exploration, and
may well be held as one of our greatest scientific
explorers&mdash;his object always to solve the mystery of the great
interior; its strange peculiarity and physical formation. He
returned disappointed, baffled. But was he in reality beaten? He
was exceptionally unlucky in his seasons, and the report of the
land he brought back caused settlement to progress slowly; only
after years, when men had grown accustomed to the terrors of the
desert, and knew that experience robbed them of their effect, Sturt
found, but unwittingly, the outflow of the second river system. He
longed to be the first to reach the centre of Australia, and hoped
that once past the southern zone of the tropics he would reach a
country blessed with a heavy and constant rainfall. Always he
looked back with pleasure upon his travels, and said: "My path
amongst savage tribes has been a bloodless one."</p>

<p>Next among our explorers comes Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, and his
trip from Fort Burke, on the Darling, to the Gulf of Carpentaria,
which opened up so much well-watered country and attracted
universal attention; but, unlike Sturt, he had exceptional good
fortune, travelling always through country easy to penetrate and
well watered&mdash;not one night had the party to camp without
water.</p>

<p>During this expedition, Sir Thomas Mitchell started with one
having almost the same end in view as Dr. Leichhardt's. He did not
reach the Gulf, but threw open our wonderful western prairies, and
found the upper tributaries of the second great river system. This
was his last expedition, and it fully confirmed his reputation.
More fortunate than Sturt, he had been favoured in having plentiful
and bountiful seasons of water and vegetation; but both men had
done wonders in the cause of exploration. Mitchell's discovery of
the Victoria, along the banks of which river he felt the high road
to the north coast was found, was continued by Kennedy, who had
been second in command during the first expedition of Sir Thomas
Mitchell.</p>

<p>With a lightly equipped party Kennedy started to follow the
course of the Victoria. Finally the river led them into the desert
described by Sturt: "Plains gaping with fissures, grassless and
waterless," and he turned back satisfied that the Victoria had not
its outflow in the Gulf of Carpentaria, as hoped for by Sir Thomas
Mitchell, but lost itself in Cooper's Creek. The loss of flour,
through the natives, prevented Kennedy from extending his
explorations towards the Gulf.</p>

<p>Kennedy's second trip, to examine Cape York Peninsula, ended
most disastrously. Out of his party of thirteen only two men and a
black boy were rescued. Through marshes and scrubs&mdash;seemingly
the one monotonous entry in their journal being, "Cutting scrub all
day"&mdash;they endeavoured to push their way to Port Albany, the
extreme north of the Peninsula, where a ship would meet them.
Saltwater creeks and marshy ground, with the ranges inhabited by
hostile natives, was their prospect, while their horses were
rapidly failing on the sour coast grasses. From first to last this
was a most unfortunate expedition-the awful and impassable nature
of the country travelled through, the hostile blacks and loss of
the horses, and then, when sickness came upon the little band, it
was doomed.</p>

<p>In the south, Baron von Mueller was busy exploring some of the
unknown portion of South Australia and the Australian
Alps-botanical and geographical researches combined. The heights of
several of the highest mountains in Australia were fixed, and
geographical positions accurately placed.</p>

<p>Leichhardt, encouraged by his successes, makes his final
venture, but what befel his party&mdash;shall we ever know? It is
so late now that we can entertain little hope of ever elucidating
his fate.</p>

<p>In 1846, the Gregory brothers are in the west, led by A. C.
Gregory, who so distinguished himself afterwards as a scientific
explorer, and in 1855 he was in command of the North Australian
Expedition; with him his brother and the celebrated botanist Baron
Von Mueller. Captain Stokes reported the Victoria as an important
stream, and the probable means of gaining access to the interior,
upon which Gregory traced its course. He professed great
disappointment at the reality of Captain Stokes' "Plains of
Promise," compared to what he had been led to expect. The
successful conclusion of this expedition, which had covered nearly
five thousand miles, proves Gregory an explorer of undoubted
qualifications, and it is to he regretted that so scanty a record
of his travels has been published.</p>

<p>Lake Torrens still occupied the attention of the South
Australian colonists, its probable extent and direction, and
several expeditions were undertaken to solve the question. To the
south-east fresh water and well grassed pastoral country, but Lake
Torrens still remained as on its first discovery by Eyre&mdash;a
dry bed covered with a thick incrustation of salt, and far away
surrounded on all sides by barren country. Goyder found fresh water
in the lake, but its unavailability was confirmed.</p>

<p>M'Dowall Stuart has been recognised as the man who first crossed
from sea to sea, from the south to the north coast, and now on
Stuart's track is built the overland telegraph line, a lasting
witness of his indomitable perseverance. In his subsequent
expeditions following his old tracks, he was destined to meet
success, and come to the sea near the mouth of the Adelaide River.
Stuart dipped his hands and feet in the sea, and his initials were
cut on the largest tree they could find. This was his last trip,
and he never recovered from the great suffering of his return
journey.</p>

<p>The expedition under Burke and Wills left amid great
celebration; in fact, it was a gala day in Melbourne, and their
journey through the settled districts one triumphant march. Their
purpose was to cross to Carpentaria. Fate seemed so propitious that
one would think in irony she laughed, as she thought of their
return.</p>

<p>They accomplished their task; they reached the Gulf; but did not
know their exact position; and when they turned back it became a
terrible struggle for existence. In spite of the princely outfit
with which they started, short rations and great hardships was
their lot, and the men tried to live like the blacks, on fish and
nardoo, and an occasional crow or hawk which they shot. Wills met
his death alone, while Burke and King were searching for food, and
to him, suffering from such extreme exhaustion, death must have
come as the "comforter." He met it as a gallant man would, without
fear. From his last entries he had given up hope and waited calmly.
Burke died the second day; when King looked at him in the dawning
light, he saw that he was really, alone. Meantime, the rest of the
party were left on Cooper's Creek, and were slowly starving to
death. Parties from all sides were now being equipped to go in
search of them.</p>

<p>M'Kinlay's trip across the continent did great service. It
verified Stuart's report that the country always considered as a
terrible desert was not unfit for all pastoral occupation, and,
being an experienced man, his report carried conviction.</p>

<p>One of the search parties for Burke and Wills was under William
Landsborough, having, through previous explorations, good knowledge
of the country; and another, in charge of Frederick Walker,
composed of native troopers. Now the eastern half of Australia was
nearly all known; it had been crossed and re-crossed from south to
north; still, the distinctive value of the country had yet to be
learned, and the delusion that the sheeps' wool would turn to hair
in the torrid north to be given up. All around the coast settlement
was surely and steadily creeping, and unoccupied country going
further back every day.</p>

<p>On the north coast, Burketown, under the care of William
Landsbrough, was growing up, and in the north of Arnheim's Land,
M'Kinlay was looking for a suitable site to establish a port for
the South Australian Government. Somerset was formed on the
mainland of Cape York Peninsula, and the formation of this led to
the expedition of the Jardine brothers. The successful termination
of their journey, when we look at the difficulties through which
they passed, and the misfortunes they had to encounter, merits our
greatest admiration; and although it did not result in the
discovery of good pastoral country, still they accomplished their
object.</p>

<p>The overland telegraph line, and the small explorations made on
either side of it, led greatly to our knowledge of the
interior.</p>

<p>John Forrest made his first important journey in 1869, but found
no great results in good country to the eastward of Perth. Then a
journey was made from Perth to Adelaide by way of the Great
Bight&mdash;never traversed since Eyre's journey. Owing to a better
equipment, he was able to give a more impartial report of the
country passed through; for Eyre was struggling for life, and it
was natural that nature to him would then look at her blackest.</p>

<p>Warburton and Giles now occupied attention, and their great
hope, the country between the overland telegraph line and the
western settlements.</p>

<p>Warburton's expedition led to the western half of the continent
being condemned as a hopeless desert. He no doubt got into a strip
of barren country, and being so occupied in pressing straight
through, devoted no time to the examination of country on either
side.</p>

<p>Giles was twice driven back in his attempts to reach Western
Australia. Then, with an equipment of camels, made a third, and
successful, attempt. No discoveries of any importance were made;
the country was suffering from severe drought.</p>

<p>William Hann, one of the pioneer squatters of the North of
Queensland, took charge of a party sent by the Queensland
Government to investigate the tract of country at the base of Cape
York Peninsula, both for its mineral and other resources. Naming
the Palmer, and finding here prospects of gold, the further
examination of the river resulted in the discovery of what turned
out to be one of the richest goldfields in Queensland.</p>

<p>Again the Queensland Government sent out an expedition, under
charge of W. 0. Hodgkinson, to determine the amount of pastoral
country to the west of the Diamantina River.</p>

<p>Buchanan and F. Scarr next attacked the country between the
overland telegraph line and the Queensland border, and in 1878, Mr
Lukin, proprietor of the <i>Courier</i>, in Brisbane, organised an
expedition for the purpose of exploring the country in the
neighbourhood of a proposed railway line, which had been
inaugurated in Port Darwin, and to find the nature, value, and
geographical features of the unexplored portions. Under the
leadership of Ernest Favenc, the party started from Blackall. This
expedition had the effect of opening up a great area of good
pastoral country, nearly all of which is now stocked.</p>

<p>In 1883, Favenc traced the heads of the rivers running into the
Gulf of Carpentaria, near the Queensland border, and in the year
following, crossed from the Queensland border to the telegraph
line, and across the coast range to the mouth of the Macarthur
River. Soon after, the South Australian Government surveyed this
river, and opened it as a port; a good road was formed from the
interior to the coast, and the settlement of the country
followed.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, Alexander Forrest led an expedition from
the De Grey River to the telegraph line, which they reached after a
great struggle. It was a most successful trip, and the district
found contains some of the best country in Western Australia, both
for pastoral and mineral purposes.</p>

<p>Stockdale, with a view to settlement, explored the country in
the neighbourhood of Cambridge Gulf. Landing there by steamer, he
began the journey, which ended in a tragedy. After a hard struggle,
he reached the telegraph line.</p>

<p>McPhee's exploration east of Daly Waters may be said to conclude
the expeditions between the Queensland border and the overland
line.</p>

<p>To complete the exploration of Arnheim's Land, the South
Australian Government fitted out an expedition under the guidance
of Mr. David Lindsay, but the country passed over was not available
for pastoral settlement, some of it being good sugar country.
Messrs. Carr Boyd and O'Donnell, undertaking another trip from the
Katherine River to Western Australia, were more fortunate in
finding good country, but no geographical discovery resulted.</p>

<p>Thus our island continent has been opened to us by the
indomitable courage and endurance of navigators and explorers. Can
we look for instances of greater bravery in the exploration of any
other portion of the globe? Our old navigators, with their meagre
equipment, searched minutely every portion of the coast, until the
termination of the survey of the <i>Beagle</i>, for the mouth of
some river that would communicate with the interior, as our earlier
explorers hoped to find a waterway in the wilderness through which
they travelled.</p>

<p>The idea of the work they did, being verified as it now is,
could never have been dreamt of. Think of Flinders, in the old
<i>Investigator</i>, as he. sailed from group to group of islands,
and from point to point of reefs; when he got at last through
Torres Straits, and stood down the Gulf, looking up the old land
marks of the early Dutch visitors to our shores&mdash;Duyfhen
Point, the Van Alphen River, <i>Groote Eylandt</i>, and the
rest&mdash;names still preserved, that bear witness to the brave
old navigator who visited these shores before we did. Many an
anxious day and night, doubtless, he had. Now, with steam at our
command, the straits have become the safe highway of traffic to all
the leading marts of the world.</p>

<p>It is well for us to bear in mind that, as a rule, experienced
bushmen do find the best points of new country, and not the worst.
The after result generally is that the discoveries of the first
explorers are extended, but not improved on. Therefore, in
comparing the different routes that traverse the western half of
our continent, we can safely allow that each man found, and noted,
the most promising features on his line of travel.</p>

<p>By close comparison of the work done by the men who have laid
bare so many of the secrets of the interior, and by deductions to
be drawn from the physical conformation and climatic peculiarities
already revealed, we may, to some extent, conjecture the
possibilities of the future. With every variety of climate between
temperate and tropical, with enormous mineral treasures&mdash;the
extent of which, even at the present time, can only be
conjectured&mdash;boundless areas of virgin soils, and a coastline
dotted with good harbours and navigable rivers, we have all the
elements of a nation yet to take rank among the recognised powers
of the world. But in the interim there is much to be done. The flat
and monotonous nature of most of the continent, which is at present
to a certain extent our bane, will, when the principles of water
storage, and its distributation are fully understood, be of
wonderful assistance. The physical formation of the interior lends
itself to the creation of artificial channels, and the work of
leading waterways through the great areas of unwatered country,
that for months lie useless and unproductive, will be comparatively
easy. We have always, or nearly always, our annual floods to depend
upon, and the supply furnished by them should be amply sufficient
for use. Flood water is surplus water, and its conservation should
be the thing aimed at. Many a dry watercourse, that is now but a
slight depression, could be utilised as a channel for conducting
the flood waters to the back country. What would be impossible in
an island of bold mountain ranges, becomes easy in the flats of our
dry interior.</p>

<p>In the dry inland plains, a water supply that will relieve the
frontage from overstocking during the droughty months, means the
preservation of some of our most valuable indigenous fodder plants.
The overcrowding of stock on the natural permanent waters during
dry periods, has often been the cause of a depreciation in the
natural grasses on some of our principal rivers. And whilst this
has been going on, sun-cracked lagoons and lakes, surrounded by
good, if dry, feed have been lying unnoticed and useless, waiting
for the time to come when they would be turned to account.</p>

<p>Back from the main watercourses are countless natural
reservoirs, that lie for years dry, and drought-smitten, save in an
exceptional flood. They are never filled, and the fact of supplying
them with water is practicably feasible.</p>

<p>In many districts of the inland slope, the rivers have sandy
beds, incapable of retaining the water for more than a few months;
whilst running parallel with them on either side, are chains of
lagoons that often run dry through the floods not being excessive
enough to overflow the banks. These lagoons are, as a rule, well
calculated to hold water, and could be brought under the influence
of ordinary floods, instead of being, as now, dependent upon
extraordinary ones; thus atoning for the insufficient retaining
power of the river bed.</p>

<p>The present great need of Australia is the conservation of
water, and the irrigation works which have been already commenced
on the banks of the Murray River, coupled with the recent
discoveries of an apparently unlimited artesian supply on the and
plains of Western Queensland, testify alike to the recognition of
the want, and to the ease with which it may be met. One inevitable
rule of settlement is that population follows water; present
prospects therefore amply justify the hope that at no very distant
date the one-time "central desert" of the first explorers will be
the centre of attraction for the fast-growing population of the
coast line; and that in the merging together of the peoples of the
colonies, now separated by merely imaginary boundary lines, will be
found the one great help to the fulfilment of the desire of every
true Australiana Federated Australia&mdash;a grand result of the
indomitable courage, heroic self-sacrifice, and dogged perseverance
of the men of all nationalities, who have established a claim to
the proud title of "Australian Explorer."</p>

<h2><a name="app01" id="app01"></a>APPENDIX I - The Pandora
Pass.</h2>

<p>The following memorandum, written on parchment, was enclosed in
a bottle, and buried under a marked tree in the Pandora Pass:</p>

<p>"MEMORANDUM.</p>

<p>"After a very laborious and harassing journey from Bathurst,
since April last, a party, consisting of five persons, under the
direction of Allan Cunningham, H.M. Botanist (making the sixth
individual), having failed of finding a route to Liverpool Plains,
whilst tracing the south base of the Barrier Mountains (before us
north), so far as fifty miles to the eastward of this spot, at
length upon prosecuting their research under this great mountain
belt, in a westerly direction, reached this valley, and discovered
a practicable and easy passage through a low part of the mountain
belt, north by west from this tree, to the very extensive levels
connected with the abovementioned plains, of which the southernmost
of the chain is distant about eleven or twelve miles (by
estimation), N.N.W. from this valley, and to which a line of trees
has been carefully marked, thus opening an unlimited, unbounded,
seemingly well-watered country, N.N.W., to call forth the exertions
of the industrious agriculturist and grazier, for whose benefit the
present labours of the party have been extended. This valley, which
extends to the S.W. and W.S.W., has been named 'Hawkesbury Vale,'
and the highest point of the range, bearing N.W. by W. from this
tree, was called 'Mount Jenkinson,' the one a former title, and the
other the family name of the noble earl whose present title the
plains bear, and which, from the southern country, this gap affords
the only passage likely to be discovered. The party in the earlier
and middle stages of their expedition encountered many privations
and local difficulties of travelling to, and in their return from
the eastward; in spite, however, of these little evils, 'a
<i>hope</i> at the bottom,' or, at this almost close of their
journey, an encouragement induced them to persevere westerly a
limited distance, and thus it was this passage was discovered. It
has therefore been named 'Pandora's Pass.' Due east and west by
compass from this tree, in a direct line (by odometrical
admeasurement) were planted the fresh stones of peaches, brought
from the colony in April last, with every good hope that their
produce will one day or other afford some refreshment to the weary
farmer, whilst on his route beyond the bourne of the desirable
country north of Pandora's Pass. A like planting took place on the
plains, twelve miles distance north at the last marked trees, with
similar good wishes for their growth. A remarkably high mount above
the pass east, being a guide to the traveller advancing south from
the plains, has been named 'Direction Head.' The situation of this
tree is as follows:&mdash;Latitude, observed on the 7th and 8th of
June, 1832, 32 deg. 15 min. 19 sec. S; its longitude being presumed
about 149 deg. 30 min. E. The party now proceed with the utmost
despatch south for Bathurst.</p>

<h2><a name="app02" id="app02"></a>APPENDIX II - Death of
Surveyor-General Oxley.</h2>

<p>ABSTRACT FROM THE "GOVERNMENT GAZETTE" OF MAY 27TH, 1828.</p>

<p>"It would be impossible for his Excellency, consistently with
his feelings, to announce the decease of the late Surveyor-General
without endeavouring to express the sense he entertains of Mr.
Oxley's services, though he cannot do justice to them.</p>

<p>"From the nature of this colony, the office of Surveyor-General
is amongst the most important under Government, and to perform its
duties in a manner Mr. Oxley has done for a long series of years is
as honourable to his zeal and abilities as it is painful for the
Government to be deprived of them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oxley entered the public service at an early period of his
life and has filled the important situation of Surveyor-General for
the last sixteen years.</p>

<p>"His exertions in the public service have been unwearied, as has
been proved by his several expeditions to explore the interior. The
public have reaped the benefit, while it is to be apprehended that
the event, which they cannot fail to lament, has been accelerated
by the privations and fatigue he endured during the performance of
these arduous services. Mr. Oxley eminently assisted in unfolding
the advantages of this highly-favoured colony from an early stage
of its existence, and his name will ever be associated with the
dawn of its advancement. It is always gratifying to the Government
to record its approbation of the services of meritorious public
officers, and in assigning to Mr. Oxley's name a distinguished
place in that class to which his devotion to the interests of the
colony has so justly entitled him, the Government would do honour
to his memory in the same degree as it feels the loss it has
sustained in his death."</p>

<h2><a name="app04" id="app04"></a>APPENDIX IV - Richard
Cunningham's Fate.</h2>

<p>REPORT OF LIEUTENANT ZOUCH, OF THE MOUNTED POLICE, REGARDING THE
DEATH OF RICHARD CUNNINGHAM.</p>

<p>"SIR,<br>
"Bathurst, December 7th, 1835.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to state that, in conforming with the
instructions contained in the Colonial Secretary's letter of the
16th October, together with your orders, directing me to proceed to
the interior for the purpose of ascertaining the fate of Mr.
Cunningham, I proceeded with the party on the 24th of October for
Buree, which place I left on the 29th, accompanied by Sandy (the
native black mentioned in my instructions). On the 2nd of November
I fortunately met with two blacks who knew the particulars of a
white man having been murdered on the Bogan, also the names and
persons of the perpetrators of the deed. They likewise offered to
accompany the police to where the tribe to which the murderers
belonged were encamped. I accordingly took them as guides, and on
the evening of the 6th they informed me they could see the smoke
from the fires of the Myall blacks, on the borders of a lake called
Budda.</p>

<p>"On arriving at the banks of the lake, we found a tribe encamped
consisting of upwards of forty men, women, and children, all of
whom we succeeded in making prisoners, without any resistance on
their part. Having questioned them as to the murder of a white man,
they acknowledge to one having been killed on the Bogan by four of
their tribe, three of whom they delivered up; the fourth, they
stated, was absent on the Big River. On searching the bags of the
tribe, we found a knife, a glove, and part of a cigar case, which
the three blacks acknowledged they had taken from the white man,
and which Muirhead said he was sure belonged to Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>"The three murderers, whose names are Wongadgery, Boreeboomalie,
and Bureemal, stated that they and another black, about six moons
ago, met a white man on the Bogan, who came up and made signs that
he was hungry; that they gave him food, and that he encamped with
them that night. The white man repeatedly getting up during the
night excited suspicion, and they determined to destroy him the
following morning, which they did by Wongadgery going unperceived
behind him and striking him on the back of the head with a
nulla-nulla. The other three men then rushing upon him with their
weapons, speedily effected their purpose.</p>

<p>"I then determined to proceed to the spot where the murder was
committed, which I was informed by the blacks was distant three
days' journey, but, learning from them that there was a great
scarcity of water, Muirhead, and one of the prisoners (Burreemal)
as a guide across to the Bogan, leaving the other two prisoners in
charge, under the command of Corporal Moore, to proceed to a
station about thirty miles distant from Wellington, there to await
my return.</p>

<p>"On Tuesday, the 10th, I arrived at a place called Currindine,
where the black showed me some bones, which he said were those of a
white man they had killed, and pointed out a small portion of a
coat, and also of a Manilla hat. Being thus convinced of the truth
of their statement, and also of the spot where the melancholy event
had occurred, I collected all the remains I could discover, and
having deposited them in the ground, raised a small mound over
them, and barked some of the nearest trees, as the only means in my
power of marking the spot.</p>

<p>"Having thus accomplished the object of my expedition, I
proceeded on my return, and on rejoining the party under Corporal
Moore, I learned the escape of the two prisoners, which took place
on the night of the 11th November, when trooper Lard was on sentry,
against whom I have forwarded a charge for neglect of duty. The
fulfilment of my instructions being thus partially defeated, I
considered it my duty to proceed in search of the runaways, and
continued the pursuit, I regret to say, without success, until I
was obliged to return, our stock of provisions being consumed. I
arrived here with the party yesterday, and shall forward the
prisoner, 'Bureemal,' to Sydney, together with the articles I was
enabled to collect, supposed to have belonged to the late Mr.
Cunningham.</p>

<h2><a name="app05" id="app05"></a>APPENDIX V - Cave Drawings.</h2>

<p>The singular cave paintings found by Lieutenant George Grey near
the Glenelg River, in Western Australia, during the expedition of
1838.</p>

<p>"The cave was twenty feet deep, and at the entrance seven feet
high, and about forty feet wide. As before stated, the floor
gradually approached the roof in the direction of the bottom of the
cavern, and its width also contracted, so that at the extremity it
was not broader than the slab of rock, which formed a natural seat.
The principal painting in it was the figure of a man ten feet six
inches in length, clothed from the chin downwards in a red garment,
which reached to the wrists and ankles; beyond this red dress the
feet and hands protruded and were badly executed.</p>

<p>"The face and head of the figure were enveloped in a succession
of circular bandages or rollers, or what appeared to be painted to
represent such. These were coloured red, yellow, and white, and the
eyes were the only features represented on the face. Upon the
highest bandage or roller, a series of lines were painted in red,
but although so regularly done as to indicate they have some
meaning, it was impossible to tell whether they were intended to
depict written characters, or some ornament for the head. This
figure was so drawn on the roof that its feet were just in front of
the natural seat, whilst its head and face looked directly down on
any one who stood in the entrance of the cave, but it was totally
invisible from the outside.</p>

<hr align="center" width="30%">

<p>"It would be impossible to convey in words an adequate idea of
this uncouth and savage figure; I shall, therefore, only give such
a succint account of this and the other paintings as will serve as
a sort of description. Its head was encircled by bright red rays,
something like the rays which one sees proceeding from the sun,
when depleted on the signboard of a public house; inside of this
came a broad stripe of very brilliant red, which was coped by lines
of white, but both inside and outside of this red space were narrow
stripes of a still deeper red, intended probably to mark its
boundaries. The face was painted vividly white and the eyes black;
being, however, surrounded by red and yellow lines, the body, hands
and arms were outlined in red, the body being curiously painted
with red stripes and bars.</p>

<p>"Upon the rock which formed the left hand wall of this cave, and
which partly faced you on entering, was a very singular painting,
vividly coloured, representing four heads joined together. From the
mild expression of the countenances, I imagined them to represent
females, and they appeared to be drawn in such a manner, and in
such a position, as to look up at the principal figure which I have
before described; each had a very remarkable head dress coloured
with a deep bright-blue, and one had a necklace on. Both of the
lower figures had a sort of dress, painted with red in the same
manner as that of the principal figure, and one of them had a band
round her waist. Each of the four faces was marked by a totally
distinct expression of countenance, and although none of them had
mouths, two, I thought, were otherwise rather good looking.</p>

<p>"The whole painting was executed on a white ground. The next
most remarkable drawing in the cave was an ellipse, three feet in
length, and one foot ten inches in breadth. The outside line of
this painting was of a deep-blue colour, the body of the ellipse
being of a bright yellow, dotted over with red lines and spots,
whilst across it ran two transverse lines of blue. The portion of
the painting above described formed the ground, or main part of the
picture, and upon this ground was painted a kangaroo in the act of
feeding, two stone spear-heads, and two black balls. One of the
spear-heads was flying to the kangaroo, and one away from it, so
that the whole subject probably constituted a sort of charm, by
which the luck of an enquirer in killing game could be
ascertained.</p>

<p>"There was another rather humorous sketch, which represented a
native in the act of carrying a kangaroo, the height of the man
being three feet. The number of drawings in the cave could not
altogether have been less than from fifty to sixty, but the
majority of them consisted of men, kangaroos, etc., the figures
being carelessly and badly executed, and being evidently a very
different origin to those which I have first described.</p>

<p>"Another very striking piece of art was exhibited in the little
gloomy cavities, situated at the back of the main cavern. In these
instances some rock at the sides of the cavity had been selected,
and the stamp of a hand and arm by some means transferred to it.
This outline of the hand and arm was then painted black, and the
rock about it white, so that on entering that part of the cave it
appeared as if a human hand and arm were projecting through a
crevice, admitting light."</p>

body, the young volunteer of Grey's party who died. Warrup was a
Western Australian native who accompanied the search party under
Mr. Roe:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"7th Day. The next day away, away, away, away,

"Away, away; along our tracks away; hills ascending; then

<br>
"Away, away we go (I, Mr. Roe, and Kinchela), along the shore away,

footsteps ascending a sand-hill; onwards I go, regarding his
footsteps. I see Mr. Smith dead. We commence digging the earth. Two
<i>sleeps</i> had he been dead; greatly did I weep, and much I
grieved. In his blanket folding him, we scraped away the earth.<br>
<br>
"We scrape earth into the grave, we scrape the earth into the
grave, a little wood we place in it. Much earth we heap upon
it-much earth we throw up. No dogs can dig there, so much earth we
throw up. The sun had inclined to the westward as we laid him in

LETTERS.</h2>

<p>Adelaide, 4th January, 1844.</p>

<p>"Having observed that during the past year the subject of an
overland journey from Moreton Bay to Port Essington has again been
mooted by the Legislative Council of New South Wales, I do myself
the honour of applying to you for information as to whether the
Executive Government have any such expedition in contemplation
during the present year.</p>

<p>"In the event of such being the case, I beg leave respectfully
to offer my services to conduct the explorations, and should his
Excellency the Governor do me the honour to confide in me so
honourable and important an employment, his Excellency may
confidently rely that no effort or exertions should be wanting on
my part to ensure all practicable success. In a former
communication on the subject, I had the honour of giving a rough
estimate of the probable expense of the undertaking, if carried out
in accordance to a plan of operations and a scale of party then
proposed. The altered circumstances of the colonies would now
probably enable an equipment to be prepared at much lower prices
than were then estimated for, and I may remark that, although in my
former letter to his Excellency, Sir G. Gipps, I specified, in
accordance with his Excellency's request, the nature of the party I
thought it advisable to have, and the general line of route I
deemed most likely to be practicable, I shall be most happy to
endeavour to carry out any views his Excellency may entertain upon
the subject, with any party or any direction his Excellency may
think desirable. The only point to which I would call the attention
of his Excellency the Governor, in the event of an expedition being
now in contemplation, is the great necessity there would be for the
party to take the field early in the season, so as to have the
whole winter before them for active operations; and, even then, I
feel very doubtful whether it would be possible for a party to
accomplish the whole distance to Port Essington in less than two
winters, being, as I am, strongly of opinion that it will be found
quite impracticable to travel in a tropical climate during the
summer months.</p>

<p>"Adelaide, 23rd December, 1841.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Having understood from Captain Sturt that your
Excellency is desirous of sending an expedition into the interior
from the northeast coast towards Port Essington, I do myself the
honour of. addressing your Excellency upon the subject, as I feel a
very great interest in the investigation of the interior of this
singular continent, and shall be most ready to give my services to
conduct an expedition should your Excellency decide upon fitting
one out, and confide to me that responsible and honourable duty. In
September last I met with a printed copy of a letter addressed by
your Excellency to Lord John Russell, in which some allusion was
made to your wish to send an expedition to explore the interior,
and I at once wrote to the Colonial Secretary of Sydney to
volunteer my services, but, from various causes, I am induced to
believe that my communication must have miscarried, and I now
therefore beg leave to renew that offer.</p>

<p>"As I am not in possession of your Excellency's views as to the
nature of the expedition it might be in contemplation to send out,
or the direction it might be considered desirable to take, I cannot
do more at present than express my willingness to engage in the
undertaking generally, and should your Excellency do me the honour
of entertaining the offer I have made, I shall be most happy, when
put in possession of your Excellency's wishes on the subject, to
enter more fully into the necessary detail.</p>

<p>"Being now engaged in the public service at some distance
inland, I should be most anxious to have as early notice as
possible of your Excellency's reply to my proposal, so that, by
giving timely notice to the colonial Government here, no
obstruction of the public service might take place. It would also
be necessary for me to be in Sydney as early as may be practicable
to prepare the equipment of the expedition in time to take the
field at the close of the summer.</p>

of the offer of Mr. Eyre's services in the proposed expedition,
provided no prior claim be preferred by Captain Sturt, with whom I
have had some communication on the subject. The whole expense of
the expedition would be defrayed by the Government; but before I
can enter into any engagement with Mr. Eyre it will be necessary
that I should be furnished with some account of the equipment,
etc., which would be considered necessary, in order that some
estimate of the expense of the expedition may be formed.</p>

<h2><a name="app08" id="app08"></a>APPENDIX VIII - EXTRACT OF
LETTER FROM MAJOR MITCHELL.</h2>

<p>"5th September, 1845.</p>

<p>"In attention to your letter of yesterday, I have now the honour
to submit the outlines of my plan for the exploration of the
northern interior.</p>

<p>"I would therefore first beg leave to observe that my proposed
line of route is founded on views which I have always entertained
respecting the interior, but not more so than on the expediency of
ascertaining the character of that portion of the colony to the
northwest of the River Darling. To avoid unnecessary repetition, I
shall annex a quotation here from my despatch, dated Peel's River,
29th February, 1832, in which my reasons for believing that there
is a dividing range beyond the Darling, and that a great river may
be looked for beyond it, are stated at length. I have had no
occasion to alter my plans or views respecting the interior since
that time; on the contrary, subsequent experience has rather tended
to support these views. The course of the Condamine, now better
known, affords now a better indication that the high ground is in
the situation I supposed. And I annex also a communication from
Walter Bagot respecting that portion of the country beyond the
Darling which is nearly opposite to Fort Bourke, affording
additional evidence of the existence of a lofty range to the
north-west, and a great river beyond it. The overflowing of the
'Waramble' agreed so well with what I observed at the upper part of
the Darling in 1831, and near Fort Bourke in 1836, and the
situation of the range and river beyond accord so well with all
that can reasonably be assumed, as to leave no doubt in my mind as
to the accuracy of Mr. Bagot's statement, even where it is founded
on that of the natives."</p>

<p>MINUTE BY SIR G. Gipps.</p>

<p>"Acknowledge receipt, and inform Sir Thos. Mitchell, that
desiring to leave him as far as possible free to act upon his own
judgment in the arduous undertaking in which he is about to embark,
I do not consider it necessary to do more than communicate to him
my approval of the course which he has proposed. Mr. Townsend will
be authorised to accompany him, and act as his next in command, and
Mr. Stephenson may, should Sir Thomas himself approve of it, be
engaged at a salary of 7s. 6d. per diem from the day of his leaving
Sydney; he must, however, find his own horse.</p>

<p>"Mr. Townsend will, during his absence, as well as Sir Thomas
Mitchell himself, continue to receive his usual salary from the
land fund, but every other expense will be charged against the sum
voted for the purpose by the Legislative Council, which is now
increased to £2,000."</p>

<h2><a name="app09" id="app09"></a>Appendix IX - EXTRACT OF A
LETTER OF MR. WALTER BAGOT.</h2>

<p>"20th January, 1844.</p>

<p>"The country beyond the Darling for the first few miles from the
river exhibits the same features as on its southern bank, the soil
blackish, soft, and yielding; the trees principally myall, and a
species of myall, called by the squatters rosewood, interspersed
with the small and gnarled forest oak. About ten miles from the
river, and nearly parallel to it, is the Waramble, a sort of swamp,
boggy, and difficult to cross after wet weather, directly after
which water remains in the holes along its course. From thirty to
forty miles beyond this is the Nareen Creek. Here, except in very
dry seasons, water stands. This I know from the Nareen blacks
coming into the Barwin only at those times when they are in much
danger from the Barwin blacks, who are extremely hostile to them. I
cannot tell where the Nareen joins the Barwin; as far as I am
acquainted with it, it is nearly parallel to it, slightly
converging to the river westward. Between the Waramble and Nareen
there is no perceptible rising ground; from the harder nature of
the soil, the plain becoming more open, and the timber straighter
and larger. I have no doubt that there is a gradual ascent. The
grass is extremely luxuriant, like all the unstocked portions of
rich ground in this country, the long kangaroo grass rising to the
saddle skirts. The brigalow, which I have never seen in any but
high ground, is here too.</p>

<p>"I now come to the reports of the blacks, which are: That about
three days' journey of theirs (ninety miles) beyond the Barwin is a
lofty range of mountains (I have beard of these mountains also from
a gentleman who got a distant view of them from a plain near the
Nareen); that a river, called the Culgoa, runs at the foot of these
mountains, which river, from the similarity of the name, I am
inclined to think, is one which empties itself into the Barwin,
about one hundred miles lower down than the junction of the
Castlereagh. I have remarked that the word Culgoa in the Wilem
dialect signifies 'waterfall,' which adds to the likelihood of its
being a mountain stream; that after crossing the mountains, which
occupies one day (thirty miles), and travelling for two days (sixty
miles), still north-west, they reach a large river, broader and
deeper than the Barwin, the waters of which river never fail. Their
name for this river I cannot now recollect. The old black, who gave
the clearest account of this river, and who was the only one I have
seen who admitted having been actually at this river, distinctly
described its course to be different from that of the Barwin, and,
perhaps, north or south-west. Might not this river be a tributary
to one of the large rivers which flow into the Gulph of
Carpentaria? and if so, how well adapted for a line of road
traversing its valley to the Gulph? I have often wished, while
residing on the Barwin, to make up a party to explore the size and
course of this river, but the dangerous character of the black
tribes in its direction, with the late Iong-continued drought, were
enough to prevent it."</p>

RECEIVED FROM DR. LEICHHARDT.</h2>

<p>"M'Pherson's Station, Cogoon,</p>

<p>"April 3, 1848.</p>

<p>"I Take the last opportunity of giving you an account of my
progress. In eleven days we travelled from Mr. Burell's station, on
the Condamine, to Mr. M'Pherson's, on the Fitzroy Downs. Though the
country was occasionally very difficult, yet everything went on
very well. My mules are in excellent order-my companions in
excellent spirits. Three of my cattle are footsore, but I shall
kill one of them to-night, to lay in our necessary stock of dried
beef. The Fitzroy Downs, over which we travelled for about
twenty-two miles from east to west, is indeed a splendid region,
and Sir Thomas has not exaggerated their beauty in his account. The
soil is pebbly and sound, richly grassed, and, to judge from the
Myalls, of the most fattening quality. I came right on Mount
Abundance, and passed over a gap in it with my whole train. My
latitude agreed well with Mitchell's. I fear that the absence of
water on Fitzroy Downs will render this fine country to a great
extent unavailable. I observe the thermometer daily at 6 a.m. and 8
p.m., which are the only convenient hours. I have tried the wet
thermometer, but am afraid my observations will be very deficient.
I shall, however, improve on them as I proceed.</p>

<p>"The only serious accident that has happened was the loss of a
spade, but we are fortunate enough to make it up on this station.
Though the days are still very hot, the beautiful clear nights are
cool, and benumb the mosquitoes, which have ceased to trouble us.
Myriads of flies are the only annoyance we have.</p>

<p>"Seeing how much I have been favoured in my present progress, I
am full of hopes that our Almighty Protector will allow me to bring
my darling scheme to a successful termination.</p>

<h2><a name="app11" id="app11"></a>Appendix XI - THE NARDOO
PLANT.</h2>

<p>The Nardoo appears generally to be considered the seed of the
lentil, or some other plant of the bean tribe, whereas it belongs
to one of those cryptogamic or flowerless plants, which, like ferns
and mosses, do not produce perfect seeds, but are increased by
cellular bodies named spores. It belongs to the genus
<i>Marsillea</i>, order <i>Marsilleaceae</i>, and that class of
sexual or flowerless plants called Acrogens, which have
distinguishable stems and leaves, in contra-distinction to
<i>Thallogens</i>, in which stems and leaves are indistinguishable,
as sea-weeds, fungi, and lichens. The part used for food is the
<i>Involucen Sporangium</i>, or spore case, with its contained
spores, which is of an oval shape, flattened, and about one-eighth
of an inch in its longest diameter; hard and horny in texture,
requiring considerable force to crush or pound it when dry, but
becoming soft and mucila ginous when exposed to moisture. The
natives pound it between two stones, and make it into cakes like
flour. The spores vegetate in water, and root in soil at the
bottom, where the plant grows to maturity. After the water dries
up, the plants die, and leave the spore cases on, in many instances
quite covering the surface of the dried mud. It is then that they
are gathered for food. On the return of moisture, the spore cases
softened, become mucilaginous, and discharge their contents to form
a fresh crop of plants. The foliage is green, and resembles clover
somewhat, being composed of three fleshy leaflets on the top of a
stalk a few inches in length.</p>

<h2><a name="app12" id="app12"></a>Appendix XII - THE FINDING OF
JOHN KING.</h2>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>The details connected with the rescue of John King, the sole
survivor of the Burke and Wills Expedition, have, strangely enough,
never yet found their way into print, owing to a series of minor
accidents, into the particulars of which it is not necessary to
enter here.</p>

<p>The relief party, under the leadership of Mr. A. W. Howitt,
fully equipped and provisioned to follow the supposed track of the
expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, if necessary, knew nothing
up to the time of the actual finding of King of the miserable fate
which had overtaken the lost explorers; nor had they the faintest
reason for supposing that they were actually on the verge of the
discovery which was to so completely elucidate the mystery of their
disappearance.</p>

<p>Early in September, 1861, Howitt's party reached Cooper's Creek,
accompanied by W. Brahe, a member of Burke's expedition, who had
been left in charge of the depôt at Fort Wills by Burke. He had
remained there a month over the time mentioned in his instructions;
his men were attacked by scurvy; the blacks in the neighbourhood
were getting troublesome, and his provisions getting low. He
therefore planted all the stores he could spare under a tree,
marked "dig," and with them an explanatory letter to his leader, in
the event of the return of the absent men, and retired to the depôt
at Bulloo. He then started for Melbourne to report himself, but was
intercepted by Howitt and taken back to Cooper's Creek as a
guide.</p>

<p>King was found by Mr. Edwin J. Welch, the surveyor, and second
in command of Howitt's party, a gentleman who afterwards identified
himself with journalism, and who has been for many years favourably
known in connection with the country press as a proprietor of
newspapers, both in Northern and Western Queensland and Victoria.
The following interesting account of his first meeting with King is
taken from Mr. Welch's diary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"13th September, 1861. Shortly after leaving camp this
morning, Howitt and I, accompanied by Brahe, rode on down the
creek, ahead of the party, to the depôt at Fort Wills, hoping
against hope that we should find Brahe's plant empty and some
record of the missing men. We were doomed to disappointment. After
a careful examination of the spot, Brahe declared that everything
was as he had left it six weeks before. The <i>caché</i> had not
been disturbed, and nothing but a few blacks' tracks in the loose
soil existed to show that any human life had broken the solitude.
We, therefore, continued our way, wondering what could have become
of them, and discussing with keen interest the suggestions offered
by each to guide us in our future movements...Camped the horses and
camels about 3 p.m., on the bank of a large waterhole in the creek,
covered with wild-fowl and partially surrounded by a dense growth
of dead mallows of great size and height.<br>
<br>
"14th September. Proceeded slowly westward, along the north bank of
the creek, carefully searching for tracks...Country opening out and
improving in character. Magnificent reaches of water in the creek;
some of the water quite salt, other holes containing water of a
milky tint, sweet and pleasant to the taste, while in others again,
it was brackish, and the edges were lined with petrified boughs,
leaves, and some few fish...Several times during the day we noticed
blacks stealthily watching our movements from a distance, and
travelling through the long grass in the direction we ourselves
were going...In the afternoon, Howitt, who had been riding well out
from the creek, returned with the news that he had struck fresh
camel tracks trending northwards, apparently those of a lost
camel...Another comfortable camp on the creek, with plenty of
feed.<br>
<br>
"15th September (Sunday). Left camp at 8 a.m. Howitt, with one of
the black boys, started to run the camel track seen yesterday. I
gave Sampson (the leading man of the file) a compass bearing to
follow, with instructions to keep as closely to it as the windings
of the creek would permit, and rode on ahead, actuated by curiosity
as to the movements of our black friends of yesterday. After
travelling about three miles, my attention was attracted by a
number of niggers on the opposite bank of the creek, who shouted
loudly as soon as they saw me, and vigorously waved and pointed
down the creek. A feeling of something about to happen excited me
somewhat, but I little expected what the sequel was to be. Moving
cautiously on through the undergrowth which covered the banks of
the creek, the blacks kept pace with me on the opposite side, their
cries increasing in volume and intensity; when suddenly rounding a
bend, I was startled at seeing a large body of them gathered on a
sandy neck in the bed of the creek, between two large waterholes.
Immediately they saw me, they too commenced to howl, throw their
arms about, and wave their weapons in the air. I at once pulled up,
and considered the propriety of waiting the arrival of the party,
for I felt far from satisfied with regard to their intentions. But
here, for the first time, my favourite horse&mdash;a black cob,
known in the camp as 'Piggy,' a Murray Downs bred stock horse, of
good local repute, both for foot and temper&mdash;appeared to think
that his work was cut out for him, and the time arrived in which to
do it. Pawing and snorting at the noise, he suddenly slewed round,
and headed down the steep bank, through the undergrowth, straight
for the crowd, as he had been wont to do after many a mob of
weaners on his native plains. The blacks drew hurriedly back to the
top of the opposite bank, shouting and gesticulating violently, and
leaving one solitary figure, apparently covered with some scarecrow
rags, and part of a hat, prominently alone in the sand. Before I
could pull up, I had passed it, and as I passed it tottered, threw
up its hands in the attitude of prayer, and fell on the ground. The
heavy sand helped me to conquer Piggy on the level, and when I
turned back, the figure had partially risen. Hastily dismounting, I
was soon beside it, excitedly asking, 'Who, in the name of wonder,
are you?' He answered, 'I am King, sir.' For a moment I did not
grasp the thought that the object of our search was attained, for
King being only one of the undistinguished members of the party,
his name was unfamiliar to me. 'King?' I repeated. 'Yes,' he said;
'the last man of the exploring expedition.' 'What, Burke's?' 'Yes.'
'Where is he&mdash;and Wills?' 'Dead&mdash;both dead, long ago;'
and again he fell to the ground. Then I knew who stood before me.
Jumping into the saddle, I rode up the bank, fired two or three
revolver shots to attract the attention of the party, and, on their
coming up, sent the other black boy to cut Howitt's track and bring
him back to camp. We then put up a tent to shelter the rescued man,
and by degrees, as he recovered from the excitement of the meeting,
we got from him the, sad story of the fate of his leader. We got it
at intervals only, between the long rests which his exhausted
condition compelled him to take, and the main facts are, as
summarised, given below:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"'Burke, Wills, Gray, and I, left the depôt in charge of Brahe, at
Fort Wills, on the 16th December, 1860, with six camels, one horse,
and provisions for three months. The stock was in splendid
condition, and we were in high spirits. Keeping a steady course
northwards, we reached salt water and mangrove swamps on&mdash;but
I can't tell you the date; you will find it in Wills' field-books.
He said it was the Gulf of Carpentaria, and we were satisfied; we
could not get through the mangroves, and never saw the open water,
but we had accomplished the object of the expedition. One of the
camels had knocked up some distance back, and we had to plant his
load, so that we were afraid to stay too long, for fear of getting
short of rations. We did not follow our own tracks all the way
back, but hurried as much as possible to reach the depôt in time.
On the way back we killed the horse and one camel for meat, and one
of the camels got away from us, so that we had only two left to
finish the journey. We all walked, and threw away everything except
the rations, a gun, and the clothes we had on. At one of the camps
we buried all Mr. Wills' instruments, but I don't remember which
one it was. Gray was getting knocked up worse and worse every day,
and then he got to taking more than his share of the flour and
sugar when he got a chance. Mr. Burke threatened him and boxed his
ears for this, and when he turned in one night, about two days
before we expected to reach the depôt, he said he felt he would not
live till morning, and, sure enough, he didn't. When we turned out
at daylight, Gray was dead; so we stopped there that day, and
scooped a hole in the sand about three feet deep with our hands,
and buried him in it. The next morning we pushed on for the depôt,
and when we got there, two days after, it was deserted. The fire
was still alight, and the tracks of Brahe's party were all fresh.
There was a tree marked 'DIG,' and when we were able to get at the
plant we found Brahe's note, which said they had left that morning;
but we did not mind it very much, as there was plenty to eat. Of
course, we were disappointed, but Mr. Burke said we could get back
by Strzelecki's Creek to Mount Hopeless, and so to Adelaide. We
stopped at the depôt five days, which was a good spell for
ourselves and the two camels, and we felt much better. When we were
ready to start, we buried all the field-books and some letters, to
let anybody who came by know where we were going, and then covered
up the plant carefully, so that the blacks should not find it out.
We went westerly down the creek, and saw lots of blackfellows, but
Mr. Burke did not care to try and make friends with them; he said
there were too many of them, and it was no good wasting time. After
we got some distance down the creek, it was decided to cross and
strike to the southward, but we must have picked a bad place, for
one of the camels got stuck in a quicksand at the end of a
waterhole, and we could not get him out, although we worked hard
for nearly twenty-four hours; so, as there was nothing else left
for it, we shot him, cut off as much meat as we could carry, and,
after drying it, started on again; but our load was so much heavier
now that we had to travel very slowly, and the other camel was
beginning to knock up. After two days more, he got so weak that he
couldn't get up off the ground, so we had to shoot him too, pack
some more of the meat, and then go on. We got on to a branch creek,
which ran in the direction we wanted to go, but after a few more
miles it ran out, and lost itself in channels in an earthy plain:
so we had to go back to the last water. We were all three beginning
to feel bad now, so it was decided to take a good spell before
making another attempt. While we were doing this the rations were
getting very short, and we began to cat nardoo the same as the
blacks. Sometimes the blacks would come by and give us a few fish,
which we could not catch ourselves, and sometimes we managed to
shoot a crow or a hawk, but we had no strength to go and look for
anything. Mr. Wills, however, determined to go back to the depôt,
and see if anybody had been there, and he was away some days by
himself. When he came back, he told us that he had seen nobody, but
that he had opened the plant in the night, to bury another letter
to the committee, and carefully covered it up again. A good thing
for us, it happened that the weather was very fine, although cold
at night, and we felt the cold badly, having very few clothes. Then
we shifted camp a little higher up the creek, where there were two
or three blacks' gunyahs, and Mr. Wills got so weak that he could
not move out of his at all. Mr. Burke and I were getting very weak,
too, but I was not so bad as they were, and managed to collect and
pound enough nardoo to keep us all from starving outright. In a few
days things were so bad that Wills, who was getting worse all the
time and suffering great pain, persuaded Mr. Burke and I to go up
the creek, while we had strength, and look for the blacks, as our
only chance of life. We didn't like the idea of separating, but it
seemed to be our only chance, so we made him some nardoo bread, and
left it, with a billy of water, beside him, and went away.
Together, Mr. Burke and I wandered slowly up the creek, but could
not see a sign of any blacks, and after we had gone fourteen or
fifteen miles, Mr. Burke said he could not go any farther, and lay
down under a tree. I found some nardoo close by, and had the good
luck to shoot a crow. The night was very cold, and we felt it
dreadfully, and before daylight Mr. Burke said he was dying, and
told me not to try and bury him or cover up his body in any way,
but just put his pistol in his right hand. I did this, and then he
wrote something in his pocket-book, and died about two hours after
sunrise. When I was able to move, I went on again, to try and find
help for Wills, but the blacks had all disappeared. I found some
nardoo in one of their camps, though, and with this and another
crow I shot, I started back to Wills. It took me four days to get
back, and when I got there I found he was dead, too. I covered up
his body with boughs and sand as well as I could, and then rested
for two days, and started off again to look for blacks. I don't
know how many days it was before I found them, but I think a good
many. At first they were very kind to me, and gave me plenty to
eat; after that they tried to drive me away, but I stuck to them,
and the women gave me some nardoo every day, and sometimes one of
the men would give me some fish. I don't know how long I have been
with them, but I think it must be about three months. I knew you
were coming before I saw you, for some strange blacks came down the
creek and brought the news to the others, and somehow I got to
understand that they had seen some white men on horses, who I knew
would look for me. I could not learn to talk to them, but I began
slowly to understand what they were saying. I think I could have
lived for a long time with them, for I was all the while getting a
little bit stronger.'"</blockquote>

<p>From the foregoing narrative it will be at once seen that the
unfortunate collapse of Gray, when within only two days' journey of
the depôt, was the direct cause of the death of Burke and Wills.
King was a young man, of good physique, and of a nature in which
the disposition to mental worry or anxiety had no part. The leaders
had to endure this in addition to their physical sufferings, and
the bitterness of dying within the reach of help, after having
successfully accomplished the most dashing feat ever recorded in
the annals of Australian exploration. They had performed their
allotted task, and they perished miserably in the hour of their
success.</p>

<p>The criticisms of Australians generally, and of bushmen in
particular, were for a long time afterwards directed to the
apparently unaccountable circumstance that neither Howitt, Welch,
nor Brahe detected at their first visit to the depôt that the
<i>caché</i> had been opened. King's narrative showed that it had
actually been twice opened, but it must be borne in mind that on
each occasion the best precautions were adopted to conceal the
fact, and thereby avoid attracting the attention of the blacks. The
unfortunate men, who were slowly starving to death on the banks of
the creek, had left no visible sign of their visit to the spot.
Brahe, who made the plant, positively asserted that it had not been
interfered with, and Howitt, therefore, wisely declined to burden
himself with an additional weight of stores for which he had no
present use. Even had it been opened on that 13th of September, the
knowledge which it would have revealed was too late to be of
service, and could not have expedited the rescue of King by more
than a few hours, if at all.</p>

<h2><a name="app13" id="app13"></a>Appendix XIII - POISON
PLANTS.</h2>

<p>The properties of the Australian plants are only imperfectly
known, very few species having been chemically examined; numbers
are suspected, but have not been positively proved. The poison
plant that caused such havoc amongst the horses of both Jardine and
Austin mostly affects the spinifex country. It is a ground plant,
and liable to be cropped by a horse amongst the grass, when the
animal would probably refuse to touch a bush.</p>

<p>Amongst the most poisonous plants known in Australia may be
mentioned the "thorny apple," <i>Datura Stramonium</i>, and
<i>Datura tatula</i>; also the <i>Excaecaria agallocha</i>, and
<i>Lolium termulentum</i>.</p>

<p>The indigo plant, <i>Swainsona galegifolia</i>, is a glabrous
perennial, or undershrub, with erect flexuose branches, sometimes
under one foot, sometimes ascending, or even climbing, to the
height of several feet. The flowers are rather large, and deep-red
in the original variety; pod much inflated, membranous one to two
inches long, on a stipe varying from two to six lines. The species
varies, with light, purplish-pink flowers, <i>S.
coronillaefolia</i>; and white flowers, <i>S. albiflora</i>. The
difference in the length of the stipes of the pod does not, as had
been supposed, coincide with the difference in the colour of the
flower. This plant acts in a peculiar way upon sheep, driving them
insane until death ensues. The sheep, however, select it as an
especial tit-bit, it, apparently, possessing an irresistible
fascination for them.</p>

<p>The "Darling pea" <i>Swainsona procumbens</i>. Glabrous; or the
young shoots and foliage slightly silky; or sometimes pubescent, or
hirsute, with procumbent ascending, or erect stems of one to three
feet. Leaflets varying from oblong or almost linear, and
one-quarter inch to half-inch long, to lanceolate, or linear-acute,
and above one inch long. Flowers: large, fragrant, violet, or blue;
pod sessile, above one inch long.</p>

<p>The "Pitchuri plant," <i>Anthocercis Hopwoodii</i>. A glabrous
tree, or shrub. Leaves: narrow-linear, acutely acuminate, with the
point often recurved, entire, rather thick, narrowed into a short
petiole, two to four inches long; fruit unknown.</p>

<p>"Australian Tobacco," <i>Nicotian suaveolens</i>. An erect
annual, or biennial, of one to two feet. Flowers: white, or
greenish on side; sweet-scented, especially at night.</p>

<p>Amongst those that are but slightly poisonous are: <i>Typhonium
Brownii</i>, and <i>Colocasia Macrorrhiza</i>; the <i>Crinum
flaccidum</i> and <i>C. pendunculatum</i>, both bulbous herbs;
<i>Carcumbum populifolium</i> and <i>C. Stillingiaefolium</i>, tall
shrubs; <i>Duboisea myoporoides</i> and <i>D. Leichhardtii</i>,
shrubs; <i>Aristolochia</i> praevenos, a tall, climbing shrub;
<i>A. pubera</i>, a small, prostrate, or trailing herb; <i>Chamae
fistula laevigata</i> and <i>C. Sophera</i>, erect, glabrous
shrubs.</p>

<p>The "Nightshade," <i>Solanum Nigrum</i>. An erect annual, or
biennial, with very spreading branches, one to nearly two feet
high. Leaves: petiolate, ovate, with coarse, irregular, angular
teeth, or nearly entire, one to two inches long. Flowers; small and
white, in little cymes, usually contracted into umbels on a common
peduncle, from very short, to nearly one inch long. Berry: small,
globular, usually nearly black, but sometimes green-yellow, or
dingy-red.</p>

<p>The "Bean tree," <i>Castanospermum Australe</i>. A tall,
glabrous tree; pods eight or nine inches long, about two inches
broad; the valves hard and thick, the spongy substance inside
dividing it into three to five cells each, containing a large,
chestnut-like seed.</p>

others of the party on Cooper's Creek. Gray died; Burke, Wills, and
King stop to bury him by scraping a hole in the sand, and reached
the depôt only to find that Brahe and the other three men had left
that morning. Stopping to bury Gray cost Burke and his companions
their lives. They could scarcely walk, and their camels were in the
same state. Gray died of exhaustion and fatigue. Wills, who was so
weak, was left lying under some boughs, with a supply of water and
nardoo, to meet his death alone. Two days after, Burke gave in, and
King found himself alone. The remains of the explorers were

expedition had the effect of opening up a great area of good
pastoral country which is now stocked. 1878-1879.</p>

<p>Traced the heads of the rivers running into the Gulf of
Carpentaria near the Queensland border, and in the f ollowing year
took a more lengthened expedition across the coast range to the

east coasts of Australia, and explored the Gulf of Carpentaria and
the coast of Arnheim's Land. The <i>Investigator</i> being then
found unseaworthy, he returned to Port Jackson, after a visit to,
Timor. For the purpose of procuring another vessel to continue the
survey, he took passage for England with his officers and crew in
the <i>Porpoise</i>. Seven days after leaving Sydney, the vessel
was wrecked on the Barrier Reef, and Flinders in an open boat made
his way back to Sydney, a distance of seven hundred miles. Governor
King gave him the <i>Cumberland</i>, in which vessel he proceeded
homeward, and on putting in to the Mauritius, he was there made
prisoner by General de Caen, the French Governor, and detained in
the Isle of France nearly seven years. Flinders' journal of his

Took charge of a private expedition, in search of new pastoral
country. 1871.</p>

<p>Led an expedition from De Grey River to the telegraph line,
striking Daly Waters. A most successful trip; finding some of the
most valuable country in the northern part of Western Australia;
which has since been stocked with both cattle and sheep, and large
mineral wealth has been developed. 1879.</p>

<p><b>Forrest, John&mdash;</b><br>
First expedition, Lake Barlee. Not Successful in finding good
available country, but obtained a reliable survey of a great deal
of country hitherto unknown. 1869.</p>

<p>Accompanied by his brother, made a journey from Perth to
Adelaide by way of the Great Bight, not traversed since Eyre's
celebrated march; and was able to give a more impartial verdict of
the country, travelling, as he did, with larger facilities. His
report showed that the fringe of gloomy thicket was only confined
to the coast. Beyond, he found fine pastoral country. 1870.</p>

<p>With his brother, Alexander Forrest, started from the furthest
outside station on the Murchison, and made a successful trip to
Peak Station, on the overland telegraph line. With nothing but
pack-horses, crossed the middle of the continent, where the very
heart of the terrible desert is supposed to exist, taking his men,
and most of his horses, in safety; concluding one of the most
valuable journeys on record. 1874.</p>

<p><b>Furneaux, Captain Tobias&mdash;</b><br>
With the <i>Adventure</i>, accompanied Cook on his second voyage in
search of the Southern Continent. Separated from Cook, and
afterwards, when they met, gave his opinion that Tasmania and New
South Wales were joined with a deep bay intervening. This opinion
Cook thought sufficient to prevent a further examination by himself
being necessary. 1772.</p>

<p><b>Gawler, Colonel&mdash;</b><br>
Governor of South Australia. Made an excursion to the Murray. He
was accompanied by Captain Sturt (Surveyor-General), Miss Gawler,
and Mrs. Sturt, but it is to be presumed Miss Gawler and Mrs, Sturt

<p><b>Giles, Ernest&mdash;</b><br>
Starting from Chamber's Pillar, South Australia, made a journey to
the westward, but was stopped by a large dry salt lake. He named it
Lake Amadens. He returned, having traversed a great deal of country
before unknown. 1872.</p>

<p>Left on his second trip, starting from the Alberga, that flows
into Lake Eyre, travelling north-west. Made many determined
attempts to cross the spinifex desert, but returned unsuccessful.
One of the party, Gibson, died, and several horses. The scene of
Gibson's death is now marked as Gibson's Desert. 1873.</p>

<p>With an equipment of camels, made his third and successful
attempt to reach Western Australia, but, from want of water, no
knowledge of the country was obtained beyond their immediate track.
Giles then retraced his steps to the overland line, following a
track to the north of Forrests route, by way of the Murchison, and
crossed over to the Ashburton. Then striking south of east he came
to his former track of 1873, at the Alfred and Marie
Range&mdash;the range he had so vainly tried to reach when the man
Gibson met his death. Finally arrived at Peak Station. 1875-76.</p>

<p><b>Gonneville, Paulmier De&mdash;</b><br>
Visited the south seas, and is claimed by the French to have landed
on New Holland. 1503.</p>

<p><b>Gosse, W. C.&mdash;</b><br>
In charge of the Central and Western Exploring Expedition. Left
Alice Springs, on the overland telegraph line, with the intention
of reaching Perth, having a mixed equipment of camels and horses.
After many attempts to penetrate westward, Gosse was obliged to
return, the heat of the weather and the dryness of the country
rendering it useless to think of risking his party with any hope of
success. 1873.</p>

<p><b>Gould, Captain&mdash;</b><br>
On the south coast, near Port Lincoln, 1827-28.</p>

<p><b>Goyder, G. W.&mdash;</b><br>

misled by a mirage. 1857.</p>

<p>In the Great Bight, to the north of Fowler's Bay. Found nothing
but mallee scrub and spinifex. 1862.</p>

<p>Selected Port Darwin as a suitable site for a township, and
removed to that place the settlement from Escape Cliffs. 1865.</p>

<p><b>Grant, James&mdash;</b><br>
In <i>Lady Nelson</i>, the first vessel to pass through Bass's
Straits, and verified Bass's examination. 1801.</p>

<p><b>Gregory, Frank&mdash;</b><br>
Reached the long-sought Gascoyne, and followed it to Shark's Bay.
Followed the Murchison down to the Geraldine mine, finding good
pastoral country, and well watered. This was a much needed
encouragement to the colony. 1858.</p>

<p>In charge of party, left Perth in the <i>Dolphin</i> for Nickol
Bay, on the north-west coast, to land their horses and commence the
trip. Discover the Fortescue, the Hammersley Range, and the
Ashburton, which was traced upwards through a large extent of good
pastoral country. Named the De Grey and Oakover rivers. The stigma
of desolation was now partially removed by the discoveries of this
expedition. 1861.</p>

<p><b>Gregory, A. C.&mdash;</b><br>
Accompanied by his two brothers. Their first expedition in Western
Australia; travelled through a large extent of salt swampy country,
entering the salt lake region, until they reached a range of
granite hills forming the watershed of the coast streams. After
several disappointments, turned to the westward to examine rivers
discovered by Grey. On the head of one of these (the Arrowsmith)
they found a seam of coal; and returned to Bolgart Springs.
1846.</p>

<p>With party to explore the Gascoyne. Found a galena lode on the
Murchison. 1848.</p>

<p>With Baron Von Mueller, the celebrated botanist, and his
brother, H. C. Gregory. North Australian expedition in search of
Leichhardt. Proceed north to follow the Victoria. Reached the head
of that stream, and discovered Sturt's Creek and the Elsey.
Crossing the head waters of the Limmen Bight River, skirted the
Gulf for some distance south of Leichhardt's track, crossing the
rivers that he did, only higher up on their courses. Greatly
disappointed with the Plains of Promise&mdash;so named by Captain
Stokes. 1855.</p>

This expedition originated in England. Found the Glenelg, and
discovered cave drawings. 1838.</p>

<p>(Afterwards Governor of South Australia), Started on his second
expedition from the west coast. Encountering great troubles Grey
had to push on to Perth and send back a relief party. A party under
Lieutenant Roe, after some trouble in tracking the erratic
wanderings of the unfortunates, came upon them hopelessly gazing at
a point of rocks that stopped their march along the beach, too weak
to climb it. They had been three days without fresh water, and
Smith, a lad of eighteen, was dead. [See Appendix.] Grey claims the
discovery of the Gascoyne, Murchison, Hutt, Bower, Buller, Chapman,
Greenough, Irwin, Arrowsmith, and Smith Rivers. 1839.</p>

<p><b>Kindur, The&mdash;</b><br>
A mysterious river in the unknown interior, supposed to run
north-west. A runaway convict, named Clarke, brought up the story
first. He said he had heard of it from the natives, so determined
to make his escape and follow it, to see if it would lead him to
another country. He started on his adventurous trip and said he
followed the river to the sea. When at the mouth of the river he
ascended a hill, and seaward saw an island inhabited, the natives
told him, by copper-coloured men, who came in their canoes to the
mainland for scented wood. He introduced various details of large
plains which he had crossed, and a large burning mountain, but as
he saw no prospect of getting away from Australia, he returned.

To the west of Lake Torrens. 1851.</p>

<p><b>Overlanders&mdash;</b><br>
"The first overlanders with stock from Sydney side to Port Phillip
were Messrs. Ebden (afterwards treasurer), Joe Hawdon, Gardener (of
Gardener's Creek), and Captain Hepburn. This was in 1837, one year
before Mr. Mackinnon arrived in the colonies. In 1838 Captain
Hepburn made a second overland trip, starting from Braidwood, New
South Wales, with sheep purchased from Captain Coghill of that
place, and in January same year (1838), Mr. Gardener started on
second trip with 460 head of cattle purchased from my father, the
late Dr. Reid. of Inverary Park, in Argyle; delivery of same made
by myself at Yass end of January month. This trip with Mr. Gardener
so far imbued me with the love for adventure that I followed with
stock the June following, and formed stations on the Ovens River,
near where the town of Wangaratta now stands. The first overlanders
with stock to Adelaide were Joe Hawdon and Eyre, the latter
afterwards celebrated as an explorer. Well can I remember the
excitement caused by the then so-called race, who should be first
to Adelaide, Hawdon or Eyre, but Hawdon was too good a bushman for
Eyre and had more experience, and was a better judge of the season
(it was a dry one). Hawdon wisely followed the course of the Murray
right to Lake Alexandrina, and consequently had food and water in
abundance. Eyre crossed from Goulburn to go over the Wimmera
Plains&mdash;no doubt a shorter way had the season been propitious,
but as it turned out dry he had to retrace his steps, and follow
the track of friend Hawdon. Hawdon by this time had a long start,
and arrived in Adelaide two weeks before Eyre, and had his stock
disposed of. I may remark very few of us overlanders are now left,
but should this meet the eye of any such of 1837 and 1838, I make
no doubt they will remember the facts above stated."&mdash;Extract
