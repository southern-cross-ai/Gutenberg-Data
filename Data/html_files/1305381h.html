<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>THE storm had descended swiftly, sweeping in suddenly from the
sea, driving across the downs to the hills at high speed, blotting
out the faint rays of a crescent moon and hiding the country-side
beneath a pall of blackness, which was forked at intervals by
flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>The darkness was so impenetrable, and the fury of the storm so
fierce, that Harry Marsland pulled his hat well over his eyes and
bent over his horse's neck to shield his face from the driving
rain, trusting to the animal's sagacity and sure-footedness to take
him safely down the cliff road in the darkness, where a slip might
plunge them into the breakers which he could hear roaring at the
foot of the cliffs.</p>
<p>Hardly had Marsland done so when his horse swerved violently
right across the road&mdash;fortunately to the side opposite the
edge of the cliffs&mdash;slipped and almost fell, but recovered
itself and then stood still, snorting and trembling with fear.</p>
<p>He patted and spoke to the horse, wondering what had frightened
it. He had seen or heard nothing, but the darkness of the night and
the roar of the gale would have prevented him, even if his face had
not been almost buried in his horse's neck. However, the rain,
beating with sharp persistence on his face and through his clothes,
reminded him that he was some miles from shelter on a lonely
country road, with only a vague idea of his whereabouts. So, with a
few more soothing words, he urged his horse onward again. The
animal responded willingly enough, but as soon as it moved Marsland
discovered to his dismay that it was lame in the off hind leg. The
rider was quick to realize that it must have sprained itself in
swerving.</p>
<p>He slipped out of his saddle and endeavoured to feel the extent
of the horse's injury, but the animal had not entirely recovered
from its fright, and snorted as his master touched it. Marsland
desisted, and gently pulled at the bridle.</p>
<p>The horse struggled onwards a few paces, but it was badly lamed,
and could not be ridden. It thrust a timid muzzle against its
master's breast, as though seeking refuge from its fears and the
fury of the storm. Marsland patted its head caressingly, and,
facing the unpleasant fact that he was on an unknown lonely road
with a lame horse in the worst storm he had ever seen, drew the
bridle over his arm and started to walk forward.</p>
<p>He found it difficult to make progress in the teeth of the gale,
but he realized that it would be useless to retrace his steps with
the wind at his back, for only the bleak bare downs he had ridden
over that afternoon lay behind, and the only house he had seen was
a shepherd's cottage on the hill-side where he had stopped to
inquire his way before the storm came on. There was nothing to be
done but face the gale and go forward, following the cliff road
which skirted the downs, or to seek shelter for himself and his
horse at the way-side house until the fury of the storm had abated.
Prudence and consideration for his horse dictated the latter
course, but in the blackness of the night&mdash;which hung before
him like a cloud&mdash;he was unable to discern a twinkle of light
denoting human habitation.</p>
<p>The storm seemed to gather fresh force, rushing in from the sea
with such fury that Marsland was compelled to stand still and seek
shelter beside his horse. As he stood thus, waiting for it to
abate, a vivid flash of lightning ran across the western sky,
revealing lividly the storm clouds flying through the heavens, the
mountainous yellow-crested sea, and the desolate, rain-beaten
downs; but it revealed, also, a farm-house standing in the valley
below, a little way back from the road which wound down towards it
from where Marsland stood.</p>
<p>The lightning died away, the scene it had illumined disappeared,
and a clap of thunder followed. Marsland heaved a sigh of relief.
He judged that the house was less than a half a mile down the hill,
a large, gaunt, three-storied stone building, with steeply sloping
roof, standing back from the road, with a barn beside it. Doubtless
it was the home of a sheep-farmer of the downs, who would at any
rate afford shelter to himself and his horse till the violence of
the storm had passed.</p>
<p>The horse responded to an encouraging appeal as though it fully
understood, and Marsland doggedly resumed his battle with the
storm. The road slanted away slightly from the cliff when horse and
rider had covered another hundred yards, and wound through a long
cutting on the hill which afforded some protection from the gale,
enabling them to make quicker progress. But still Marsland could
not see a yard in front of him. Even if his eyes had become
accustomed to the darkness, the heavy rain, beating almost
horizontally on his face, would have prevented him seeing
anything.</p>
<p>He had matches in his pocket, but it was useless to attempt to
strike them in such a wind, and he reproached himself for having
come away without his electric torch. Slowly and cautiously he made
his way down the road, feeling his footsteps as he went, the tired
horse following obediently. The cutting seemed a long one, but at
length a sudden blast of wind, roaring in from the sea, told him
that he had emerged into the open again. He counted off another
hundred paces, then paused anxiously.</p>
<p>"The house ought to be somewhere on the left down there," he
muttered, staring blindly into the dark.</p>
<p>He wondered in an irritated fashion why there were no lights
showing from the farm-house, which he felt must be very close to
where he stood. But he recollected that farmers kept early hours,
and he realized that the occupants of the house might well be
excused for going to bed on such a night even earlier than
usual.</p>
<p>As though in answer to an unspoken wish, a flash of lightning
played over the sky. It was faint and fitful, but it was sufficient
to reveal the farm standing a little way ahead, about a hundred
yards back from the road. He saw clearly the hedge which divided
its meadows from the road, and noted that a gate leading into a
wagon drive on the side of the meadow nearest him had been flung
open by the force of the gale, and was swinging loosely on its
hinges. "They'll thank me for closing that gate if they've got any
stock in the meadows," said Marsland.</p>
<p>The swinging white gate was faintly visible in the darkness when
Marsland came close to it, and he turned into the open drive. He
noticed as he walked along that the gale was not so severely felt
inside as out on the road, and he came to the conclusion that the
farm was in a more sheltered part of the downs&mdash;was probably
shielded from the wind by the hill through which the cutting
ran.</p>
<p>He reflected that it was a good idea to build in a sheltered
spot when farming on low downs facing the English Channel. He was
glad to be able to walk upright, with the wind behind him and the
rain on his back instead of beating on his face. For one thing, he
found he was able to make some use of his eyes in spite of the
darkness, and soon he discerned the house looming bleakly ahead of
him, with the barn alongside.</p>
<p>As Marsland passed the barn, his horse surprised him by
whinnying sharply and plucking the loose bridle from his arm. He
felt for his matchbox and hastily struck a match. The wind
extinguished it, but not before its brief splutter of light showed
him the horse disappearing through an open doorway.</p>
<p>He followed it and struck another match. It flared up steadily
under cover, and he saw that he was in a small storehouse attached
to the barn. Gardening tools were neatly piled in one corner, and
in another were a stack of potatoes and some bags of grain. His
horse was plucking ravenously at one of the bags. By the light of
another match Marsland espied an old lantern hanging on a nail
above the tools. He took it from the nail, and found that it
contained a short end of candle&mdash;a sight which filled him with
pleasure.</p>
<p>He found a tin dish on top of the cornstack, opened one of the
bags, poured a measure of oats into it, and set it before his
horse. The animal eagerly thrust his nose into the dish and
commenced to eat. Marsland patted its wet flank, and then examined
the injured leg by the light of the lantern. His examination failed
to reveal any specific injury beyond a slight swelling, though the
horse winced restively as he touched it.</p>
<p>Marsland left the horse munching contentedly at its food, shut
the door of the storehouse to prevent the animal wandering away,
and set out for the house. The light of the lantern showed him a
path branching off the drive. He followed it till the outline of
the house loomed before him out of the darkness.</p>
<p>The path led across the front of the house, but Marsland looked
in vain for a ray of light in the upper stories which would
indicate that one of the inmates was awake. He walked on till the
path turned abruptly into a large porch, and he knew he had reached
the front door. Instead of knocking, he walked past the porch in
order to see if there was any light visible on the far side of the
house. It was with pleasure that he observed a light glimmering
through the second window on the ground floor. Judging by the
position of the window, it belonged to the room immediately behind
the front room on the right side of the house.</p>
<p>Marsland returned to the porch and vigorously plied the knocker
on the door, so that the sound should be heard above the storm. He
listened anxiously for approaching footsteps of heavily-shod feet,
but the first sound he heard was that of the bolt being drawn
back.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" exclaimed a feminine voice. "I have been
wondering what could have happened to you."</p>
<p>The girl who had opened the door to him had a candle in her
hand. As she spoke, she shielded the light with her other hand and
lifted it to his face. She uttered a startled exclamation.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," said Marsland, in an ingratiating tone. "I
have lost my way and my horse has gone lame. I have taken the
liberty of putting him in the outbuildings before coming to ask you
for shelter from the storm."</p>
<p>"To ask me?" she repeated. "Oh, of course. Please come in."</p>
<p>Marsland closed the door and followed her into the dark and
silent hall. She led the way into the room where he had seen the
light, placed the candle on the table, and retreated to a chair
which was in the shadow. It occurred to him that she was anxious to
study him without being exposed to his scrutiny. But he had noticed
that she was wearing a hat and a dark cloak. These things suggested
to him that she had been on the point of going out when the storm
came on. The mistaken way in which she had greeted him on opening
the door seemed to show that she had been waiting for some one who
was to have accompanied her. Apparently she was alone in the house
when he had knocked.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to have intruded on you in this unceremonious way,"
he said, reviving his apology with the object of enabling her to
dismiss any fears at her own unprotected state. "I am completely
lost, and when I saw this house I thought the best thing I could do
was to seek shelter."</p>
<p>"You are not intruding upon me," she said coldly. "The house is
not mine&mdash;I do not live here. I saw the storm coming on, and,
like you, I thought it was a good idea to seek shelter."</p>
<p>It was apparent to him that her greeting had been intended for
some one who had accompanied her to the house and had gone to one
of the farm buildings for some purpose. He noted that her manner of
speaking was that of a well-bred young lady rather than of a
farmer's daughter.</p>
<p>The room in which they were sitting was evidently used as a
parlour, and was sombrely furnished in an old-fashioned way. There
was a horsehair suite, and in the middle of the room a large round
table. Glancing about him into the dark corners of the room which
the feeble light of the candle barely reached, Marsland noticed in
one of them a large lamp standing on a small table.</p>
<p>"That will give us a better light," he said; "providing, of
course, it has some oil in it."</p>
<p>He lifted the lamp to the centre table, and found it was nearly
full of oil. He lit it, and it sent out a strong light, which was,
however, confined to a radius of a few feet by a heavy lampshade.
He glanced at the girl. She had extinguished her candle, and her
face remained obstinately in shadow.</p>
<p>He sat down on one of the horsehair chairs; but his companion
remained standing a little distance away. They waited in silence
thus for some minutes. Marsland tried to think of something to say,
but there was a pensive aloofness about the girl's attitude which
deterred him from attempting to open a conversation with a
conventional remark about the violence of the storm. He listened
for a knock at the front door which would tell him that her
companion had returned, but to his surprise the minutes passed
without any sign. He thought of asking her to sit down, but he
reflected that such an invitation might savour of impertinence. He
could dimly see the outline of her profile, and judged her to be
young and pretty. Once he thought she glanced in his direction, but
when he looked towards her she had her face still turned towards
the door. Finally he made another effort to break down the barrier
of silence between them.</p>
<p>"I suppose we must wait here until the storm has cleared away,"
he began. "It is a coincidence that both of us should have sought
shelter in this empty house in the storm&mdash;I assume the house
is empty for the time being or we would have heard from the
inmates. My name is Marsland. I have been staying at Staveley, and
I lost my way when out riding this afternoon&mdash;the downs seem
endless. Perhaps you belong to the neighbourhood and know them
thoroughly."</p>
<p>But instead of replying she made a swift step towards the
door.</p>
<p>"Listen!" she cried. "What was that?"</p>
<p>He stood up also, and listened intently, but the only sounds
that met his ears were the beating of the rain against the windows
and the wind whistling mournfully round the old house. "I hear
nothing&mdash;" he commenced.</p>
<p>But she interrupted him imperatively.</p>
<p>"Hush!" she cried. "Listen!" Her face was still turned away from
him, but she held out a hand in his direction as though to enjoin
silence.</p>
<p>They stood in silence, both listening intently. Somewhere a
board creaked, and Marsland could hear the wind blowing, but that
was all.</p>
<p>"I do not think it was anything," he said reassuringly. "These
old houses have a way of creaking and groaning in a gale. You have
become nervous through sitting here by yourself."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is so," she assented in a friendlier tone than she
had hitherto used. "But I thought&mdash;in fact, I felt&mdash;that
somebody was moving about stealthily overhead."</p>
<p>"It was the wind sighing about the house," he said, sitting down
again.</p>
<p>As he spoke, there was a loud crash in a room above&mdash;a
noise as though china or glass had been broken. Marsland sprang to
his feet.</p>
<p>"There <i>is</i> somebody in the house," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Who can it be?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Probably some one who has more right here than we have," said
Marsland soothingly. "He'll come downstairs and then we'll have to
explain our presence here."</p>
<p>"The man who lives here is away," she replied, in a hushed tone
of terror. "He lives here alone. If there is anybody in the house,
it is some one who has no right here."</p>
<p>"If you are sure of that," said Marsland slowly, "I will go and
see what has happened in the room above. The wind may have knocked
something over. Will you stay here until I return?"</p>
<p>"No, no!" she cried, "I am too frightened now. I will go with
you!"</p>
<p>He felt her hand on his sleeve as she spoke.</p>
<p>"In that case we may as well take this lamp," he said. "It will
give more light than this." He put down his lantern and picked up
the lamp from the table. "Come along, and see what havoc the wind
has been playing with the furniture upstairs."</p>
<p>He led the way out of the room, carefully carrying the lamp, and
the girl followed. They turned up the hall to the staircase. As the
light of the lamp fell on the staircase they saw a piece of paper
lying on one of the lower stairs. Marsland picked it up and was so
mystified at what he saw on it that he placed the lamp on a stair
above in order to study it more closely.</p>
<p>"What can this extraordinary thing mean?" he said to his
companion. He put his left hand in the top pocket of his waistcoat,
and then exclaimed: "I have lost my glasses; I cannot make this out
without them."</p>
<p>She came close to him and looked at the paper.</p>
<p>The sheet was yellow with age, and one side of it was covered
with figures and writing. There was a row of letters at the top of
the sheet, followed by a circle of numerals, with more numerals in
the centre of the circle. Underneath the circle appeared several
verses of Scripture written in a small, cramped, but regular
handwriting. The ink which had been used in constructing the
cryptogram was faded brown with age, but the figures and the
writing were clear and legible, and the whole thing bore evidence
of patient and careful construction. "This is very strange," she
said, in a frightened whisper.</p>
<p>Marsland thought she was referring to the diagrams on the
paper.</p>
<p>"It is a mysterious sort of document, whoever owns it," he said.
"I think I'll put it on the table in there and we will study it
again when we come down after exploring the other parts of the
house."</p>
<p>He picked up the lamp and went back to the room they had left.
He deposited the sheet of paper on the table and placed the
candlestick on it to keep it from being blown away by the wind.</p>
<p>"Now for the ghosts upstairs," he said cheerfully, as he
returned.</p>
<p>He noted with a smile that his companion made a point of keeping
behind him in all his movements. When they had climbed the first
flight of stairs, they stood for a moment or two on the landing,
listening, but could hear no sound.</p>
<p>"Let us try this room first," said Marsland, pointing to a door
opposite the landing.</p>
<p>The door was closed but not shut, for it yielded to his touch
and swung open, revealing a large bedroom with an old-fashioned
fourposter in the corner furthest from the door. Marsland glanced
round the room curiously. It was the typical "best bedroom" of an
old English farm-house, built more than a hundred years before the
present generation came to life, with their modern ideas of fresh
air and light and sanitation. The ceiling was so low that Marsland
had almost touched it with his head as he walked, and the small
narrow-paned windows, closely shuttered from without, looked as
though they had been hermetically sealed for centuries.</p>
<p>The room contained furniture as ancient as its surroundings:
quaint old chests of drawers, bureaux, clothes-presses, and some
old straight-backed oaken chairs. On the walls were a few musty old
books on shelves, a stuffed pointer in a glass case, a cabinet of
stuffed birds, some dingy hunting prints. The combination of low
ceiling, sealed windows, and stuffed animals created such a
vault-like atmosphere that Marsland marvelled at the hardy
constitution of that dead and gone race of English yeomen who had
suffered nightly internment in such chambers and yet survived to a
ripe old age. His eyes wandered to the fourposter, and he smiled as
he noticed that the heavy curtains were drawn close, as though the
last sleeper in the chamber had dreaded and guarded against the
possibility of some stray shaft of fresh air eluding the
precautions of the builder and finding its way into the room.</p>
<p>"Nothing here," he said, as he glanced round the floor of the
room for broken pieces of glass or china ornaments that might have
been knocked over by the wind or by a cat. "Let us try the room
opposite."</p>
<p>She was the first to reach the door of the opposite room to
which they turned. It occurred to Marsland that her fears were
wearing off. As he reached the threshold, he lifted up the lamp
above his head so that its light should fall within.</p>
<p>This room was a bedroom also, deep and narrow as though it had
been squeezed into the house as an afterthought, with a small,
deep-set window high up in the wall opposite the door. The room was
furnished in the old-fashioned style of the room opposite, though
more sparsely. But Marsland and the girl were astonished to see a
man sitting motionless in a large arm-chair at the far end of the
room. His head had fallen forward on his breast as though in
slumber, concealing the lower part of his face.</p>
<p>"By heavens, this is extraordinary," said Marsland, in a low
hoarse voice. With a trembling hand he placed the lamp on the large
table which occupied the centre of the room and stood looking at
the man.</p>
<p>The girl crept close to Marsland and clutched his arm.</p>
<p>"It is Frank Lumsden," she whispered quickly. "Do you think
there is anything wrong with him? Why doesn't he speak to us?"</p>
<p>"Because he is dead," he answered swiftly.</p>
<p>"Dead!" she exclaimed, in an hysterical tone. "What makes you
think so? He may be only in a fit. Oh, what shall we do?"</p>
<p>Marsland pushed her aside and with a firm step walked to the
chair on which the motionless figure sat. He touched with his
fingers the left hand which rested on the arm of the chair, and
turned quickly.</p>
<p>"He is quite dead," he said slowly. "He is beyond all help in
this world."</p>
<p>"Dead?" she repeated, retreating to the far end of the table and
clasping her trembling hands together. "What a dreadful lonely
death."</p>
<p>He was deep in thought and did not respond to her words.</p>
<p>"As we have discovered the body we must inform the police," he
said at length. "I did not know he was ill," she said, in a soft
whisper. "He must have died suddenly."</p>
<p>Marsland turned on her a searching questioning look. Her
sympathy had conquered her vague fears of the presence of death,
and she hesitatingly approached the body. Something on the table
near the lamp attracted her attention. It was an open pocket-book
and beside it were some papers which had evidently been removed
from it.</p>
<p>"What does this mean?" she cried. "Some one has been here."</p>
<p>"It is extraordinary," said Marsland.</p>
<p>He stood between her and the arm-chair so as to hide the dead
body from her. She stepped aside as if to seek in the appearance of
the dead man an explanation of the rifled pocket-book.</p>
<p>"Don't!" he said quickly, as he grasped her by the arm. "Do not
touch it."</p>
<p>His desire to save her from a shock awoke her feminine
intuition.</p>
<p>"You mean he has been murdered?" she whispered, in a voice of
dismay.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>SHE hurried from the room in terror. Marsland remained a few
minutes examining the papers that had been taken from the
pocket-book.</p>
<p>With the lamp in his hand he was compelled to descend
cautiously, and when he reached the foot of the staircase the girl
had left the house. He extinguished the lamp he was carrying, relit
the lantern, and stepped outside. The lantern showed him the girl
waiting for him some distance down the path.</p>
<p>"Oh, let us leave this dreadful house," she cried as he
approached. "Please take me out of it. I am not frightened of the
storm&mdash;now."</p>
<p>"I will take you wherever you wish to go," he said gently. "Will
you tell me where you live? I will accompany you home."</p>
<p>"You are very good," she said gratefully. "I live at
Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>"That is the little fishing village at the end of the cliff
road, is it not?" he said inquiringly. "I am staying at Staveley,
but I have not been there long. Come, I will take you home, and
then I will inform the police about&mdash;this tragic
discovery."</p>
<p>"There is a police station at Ashlingsea," she said, in a low
voice.</p>
<p>He explained to her that he wanted to look after the comfort of
his horse before he accompanied her home, as it would be necessary
to leave the animal at the farm until the following day. She
murmured a faint acquiescence, and when they reached the storehouse
she took the lantern from him without speaking, and held it up to
give him light while he made his horse comfortable for the
night.</p>
<p>They then set out for Ashlingsea. The violence of the storm had
passed, but the wind occasionally blew in great gusts from the sea,
compelling them to halt in order to stand up against it. The night
was still very black, but at intervals a late moon managed to send
a watery beam through the scudding storm clouds, revealing the
pathway of the winding cliff road, and the turbulent frothing waste
of water dashing on the rocks below. Rain continued to fall in
heavy frequent showers, but the minds of Marsland and his companion
were so occupied with what they had seen in the old farm-house that
they were scarcely conscious of the discomfort of getting wet.</p>
<p>The girl was so unnerved by the discovery of the dead body that
she was glad to avail herself of the protection and support of
Marsland's arm. Several times as she thought she saw a human form
in the darkness of the road, she uttered a cry of alarm and clung
to his arm with both hands. At every step she expected to encounter
a maniac who had the blood of one human creature on his hands and
was still swayed by the impulse to kill.</p>
<p>The reserve she had exhibited in the house had broken down, and
she talked freely in her desire to shut out from her mental vision
the spectacle of the murdered man sitting in the arm-chair.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the discovery of the body had made Marsland
reserved and thoughtful.</p>
<p>He learned from her that her name was Maynard&mdash;Elsie
Maynard&mdash;and that she lived with her widowed mother. Marsland
was quick to gather from the cultivated accents of her voice that
she was a refined and educated girl. He concluded that Mrs. Maynard
must be a lady of some social standing in the district, and he
judged from what he had seen of the girl's clothes that she was in
good circumstances. She remarked that her mother would be anxious
about her, but would doubtless assume she had sought shelter
somewhere, as having lived in Ashlingsea for a long time she knew
everybody in the district.</p>
<p>Marsland thought it strange that she made no reference to the
companion who had accompanied her to the farm. If no one
accompanied her, how was it that on opening the door to him she had
greeted him as some one whom she had been expecting? She seemed
unconscious of the need of enlightening him on this point. Her
thoughts centred round the dead man to such an extent that her
conversation related chiefly to him. Half-unconsciously she
revealed that she knew him well, but her acquaintance with him
seemed to be largely based on the circumstance that the dead man
had been acquainted with a friend of her family: a soldier of the
new army, who lived at Staveley.</p>
<p>She had told Marsland that the name of the murdered man was
Frank Lumsden, but she did not mention the name of the soldier at
Staveley. Lumsden had served in France as a private, but had
returned wounded and had been invalided out of the army. He had
been captured by the Germans during a night attack, had been shot
through the palm of his right hand to prevent him using a rifle
again, and had been left behind when the Germans were forced to
retreat from the village they had captured. After being invalided
out of the Army he had returned home to live in the old
farm-house&mdash;Cliff Farm it was called&mdash;which had been left
to him by his grandfather, who had died while the young man was in
France. The old man had lived in a state of terror during the last
few months of his life, as he was convinced that the Germans were
going to invade England, destroy everything, and murder the
population as they had done in Belgium. He ceased to farm his land,
he dismissed his men, and shut himself up in his house.</p>
<p>His housekeeper, Mrs. Thorpe, who had been in his service for
thirty years, refused to leave him, and insisted on remaining to
look after him. When he died as the result of injuries received in
falling downstairs, it was found that he had left most of his
property to his grandson, Frank, but he had also left legacies to
Mrs. Thorpe and two of the men who had been in his employ for a
generation. But these legacies had not been paid because there was
no money with which to pay them. Soon after the outbreak of the war
the old man had drawn all his money out of the bank and had
realized all his investments. It was thought that he had done this
because of his fear of a German invasion.</p>
<p>What he had done with the money no one knew. Most people thought
he had buried it for safety, intending to dig it up when the war
was over. There was a rumour that he had buried it on the farm.
Another rumour declared that he had buried it in the sands at the
foot of the cliffs, for towards the end of his life he was often
seen walking alone on the sands. In his younger days he had
combined fishing with farming, and there was still a boat in the
old boat-house near the cliffs. Several people tried digging in
likely places in the sands after his death, but they did not find
any trace of the money. Other people said that Frank Lumsden knew
where the money was hidden&mdash;that his grandfather had left a
plan explaining where he had buried it.</p>
<p>"What about the piece of paper with the mysterious plan on it
which we found on the staircase?" said Marsland. "Do you think that
had anything to do with the hidden money?"</p>
<p>"I never thought of that," she said. "Perhaps it had."</p>
<p>"We left it on the table in the room downstairs," he said. "I
think we ought to go back for it, as it may have something to do
with the murder."</p>
<p>"Don't go back," she said. "I could not bear to go back. The
paper will be there when the police go. No one will go there in the
meantime, so it will be quite safe."</p>
<p>"But you remember that his pocket-book had been rifled," he
said, as he halted to discuss the question of returning. "May not
that plan have been taken from his pocket-book after he was
dead?"</p>
<p>"But in that case how did it come on the staircase?"</p>
<p>"It was dropped there by the man who stole it from the
pocket-book."</p>
<p>"He will be too frightened to go back for it," she declared
confidently. "He would be afraid of being caught."</p>
<p>"But he may have been in the house while we were there," he
replied. "We did not solve the mystery of the crash we heard when
we were in the room upstairs."</p>
<p>"You said at the time it was possibly caused by the wind
upsetting something."</p>
<p>He was amused at the inconsequence of the line of reasoning she
adopted in order to prevent him going back for the plan.</p>
<p>"At the time we did not know there was a dead body upstairs," he
said.</p>
<p>"Do you think the murderer was in the house while we were
there?" she asked.</p>
<p>"It is impossible to say definitely. My own impression now is
that some one was in the house&mdash;that the crash we heard was
not caused by the wind."</p>
<p>"Then he must have been there while I was sitting downstairs
before you came," she said, with a shiver at the thought of the
danger that was past.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered. "The fact that you had a candle alight kept
him upstairs. He was afraid of discovery. When we went upstairs to
the first floor he must have retreated to the second
floor&mdash;the top story."</p>
<p>She remained deep in thought for a few moments.</p>
<p>"I am glad he did not come down," she said at length. "I am glad
I did not see who it was."</p>
<p>Again Marsland was reminded of the way in which she had greeted
him at the door. Could it be that, instead of having gone to the
farm for shelter with a companion, she had gone there to meet some
one, and that unknown to her the person she was to meet had reached
the house before her and had remained hidden upstairs?</p>
<p>"Did you close the front door when we left?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. I slammed it and I heard the bolt catch. Why do you
ask?"</p>
<p>"There is something I want to ask you," she said, at length.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I want you to promise if you can that you will not tell the
police that I was at Cliff Farm tonight; I want you to promise that
you will not tell any one."</p>
<p>"Do you think it&mdash;wise?" he asked, after a pause in which
he gave consideration to the request.</p>
<p>"I do not want to be mixed up in it in any way," she explained.
"The tragedy will give rise to a lot of talk in the place. I would
not like my name to be mixed up in it."</p>
<p>"I quite appreciate that," he said. "And as far as it goes I
would be willing to keep your name out of it. But have you
considered what the effect would be if the police subsequently
discovered that you had been there? That would give rise to greater
talk&mdash;to talk of a still more objectionable kind."</p>
<p>"Yes; but how are they to discover that I was there unless you
tell them?" she asked.</p>
<p>He laughed softly.</p>
<p>"They have to try to solve a more difficult problem than that
without any one to tell them the solution," he said. "They have to
try to find out who killed this man Lumsden&mdash;and why he was
killed. There will be two or three detectives making all sorts of
inquiries. One of them might alight accidentally on the fact that
you, like myself, had taken shelter there in the storm."</p>
<p>She took refuge in the privilege of her sex to place a man in
the wrong by misinterpreting his motives.</p>
<p>"Of course, if you do not wish to do it, there is no reason why
you should." She removed her hand from his arm.</p>
<p>He pulled her up with a sharpness which left on her mind the
impression that he was a man who knew his own mind.</p>
<p>"Please understand that I am anxious to do the best I can for
you without being absurdly quixotic about it. I am quite willing to
keep your name out of it in the way you ask, but I am anxious that
you should first realize the danger of the course you suggest. It
seems to me that, in order to avoid the unpleasantness of allowing
it to be publicly known that you shared with me the discovery of
this tragedy, you are courting the graver danger which would attach
to the subsequent difficulty of offering a simple and satisfactory
explanation to the police of why you wanted to keep your share in
the discovery an absolute secret. And you must remember that your
explanation to me of how you came to the farm is rather vague. It
is true that you said you went there for shelter from the storm.
But you have not explained how you got into the house, and from the
way you spoke to me when you opened the door it is obvious that you
expected to see some one else who was not a stranger."</p>
<p>She came to a halt in the road in order to put a direct question
to him.</p>
<p>"Do you think that I had anything to do with this dreadful
murder? Do you think that is the reason I asked you to keep my name
out of it?"</p>
<p>"I am quite sure that you had nothing whatever to do with the
tragedy&mdash;that the discovery of the man's dead body was as
great a surprise to you as it was to me."</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said. The emphasis of his declaration imparted
a quiver to her expression of gratitude. "You are quite right about
my expecting to see some one else when I opened the door," she
said. "I expected to see Mr. Lumsden."</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon. I never thought of that." He flushed at
the way in which her simple explanation had convicted him of having
harboured unjust suspicions against her.</p>
<p>"I went to the farm to see him&mdash;I had a message for him,"
she continued, with seeming candour. "The storm came on just before
I reached the house. I knocked, but no one came, and then I noticed
the key was in the lock on the outside of the door. Naturally I
thought Mr. Lumsden had left it there&mdash;that when he saw the
storm he had gone to the stable or cowshed to attend to a horse or
a cow. I went inside the house, expecting he would be back every
moment. When I heard your knock I thought it was he."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you must think me a dreadful boor," he said. "I
apologize most humbly."</p>
<p>She replied with a breadth of view that in its contrast with his
ungenerous suspicions added to his embarrassment.</p>
<p>"No, you were quite right," she said. "As I asked you to keep my
name out of it&mdash;as I virtually asked you to show blind trust
in me&mdash;you were at least entitled to the fullest explanation
of how I came to be there."</p>
<p>"And I hope you quite understand that I do trust you
absolutely," he said. "I know as well as it is possible to know
anything in this world that you were not connected in the remotest
way with the death of this man."</p>
<p>Having been lifted out of the atmosphere of suspicion, she felt
she could safely enter it again.</p>
<p>"I was not quite candid with you when I asked you to keep me out
of the dreadful tragedy because of the way I would be talked
about," she said, placing a penitent and appealing hand on his arm.
"There are other reasons&mdash;one other reason at least&mdash;why
I do not want it known I was at Cliff Farm to-night."</p>
<p>He was prepared to shield her if she was prepared to take the
risk of being shielded.</p>
<p>"That alters the case," he said. "My reluctance to keep your
name out of it arose from the fear that you did not realize the
risk you would run."</p>
<p>"I realize it," she said. "And I wish to thank you for pointing
it out so clearly. But it is a risk I must take."</p>
<p>"In that case you can rely on me."</p>
<p>"You will keep my name out of it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I will tell no one," he replied.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>"IT seems to me as if the storm is abating," said Sir George
Granville to his week-end guest.</p>
<p>He moved a piece on the chess-board and then got up from his
chair and went to the window to listen to the rain on the
glass.</p>
<p>His guest was so intent on the chess-board that he did not
reply. Sir George Granville remained at the window, his attention
divided between watching for his opponent's next move and listening
to the storm.</p>
<p>Sir George's opponent was a young man; that is to say, he was
under forty. He was evidently tall, and his well-cut clothes
indicated that he possessed the well-built frame which is the
natural heritage of most young Englishmen of good class. But his
clear-cut, clean-shaven face suggested that its owner was a man of
unusual personality and force of character. It was a remarkable
face which would have puzzled the student in physiognomy. The upper
portion was purely intellectual in type, the forehead broad, and
the head well-shaped, but the dark eyes, with a touch of dreaminess
and sadness in their depths, contrasted strangely with the energy
and determination indicated by the firm mouth and heavy lower
jaw.</p>
<p>The guest moved a piece and then looked at his host.</p>
<p>"You are not yourself to-night, Sir George," he said. "I think
we had better finish this game some other time, or cancel it."</p>
<p>Sir George walked over to the table and looked at the position
on the chess-board.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it would be better to cancel it," he said, "though it
is generous on your part to offer to do so, with a piece to the
good and the threatening development of your pawns on the queen's
side. But I am off my game to-night. I am too worried about that
nephew of mine to give you a good game."</p>
<p>"It is a bad night to be out," said the guest. "But surely he
would find shelter somewhere in the downs."</p>
<p>"He may have met with an accident. He must have seen this storm
coming. He should have been home hours ago in any case."</p>
<p>"Putting aside the possibility of an accident, the fact that he
hasn't turned up in the storm indicates that he has found shelter,"
said the guest. "He is waiting until the storm is over."</p>
<p>"But on the downs there are so few places where one can obtain
shelter except at a shepherd's cottage."</p>
<p>Sir George sat down in an arm-chair near the fire and invited
his guest to take the chair on the other side. The room they were
in was a large one, expensively furnished in black oak. The small
chess-table with the chess-board and men had been placed near the
large table in the centre of the room for the benefit of the light,
but the autumn night was chilly, and the fire comfortable, and an
open box of cigars and spirit-stand close by enhanced the
appearance of indoor comfort. After his guest had declined a drink,
Sir George mixed himself a whisky and soda and settled himself in
an easy chair. His guest lit a cigar.</p>
<p>They had been seated in front of the fire but a few minutes when
the sound of the telephone bell was heard in the hall. Sir George
jumped to his feet with an alacrity that was surprising in a man of
his weighty figure.</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is Harry," he said to his guest as he hurried into
the hall.</p>
<p>The guest lit another cigar and leaned back in his chair as he
awaited the return of his host. The length of time Sir George was
at the telephone would indicate to some extent the nature of the
conversation. An absence of over a minute would suggest good news,
and that his host was desirous of obtaining the full measure of it.
To the surprise of the guest, five minutes elapsed without any sign
of the return of his host. That the telephone conversation should
have lasted so long seemed improbable.</p>
<p>The guest, with a delicate regard for what was due to a host,
tried to keep his active mind from speculating on the nature of the
news by telephone that was keeping Sir George away. He got up to
examine the paintings on the wall, but found little in them to
claim his attention. Nearly a quarter of an hour had elapsed since
the telephone bell had rung. With a smile the guest returned to his
chair. He had alighted on a solution of his host's long absence:
Sir George had received good news and had gone upstairs to announce
it to his wife.</p>
<p>Lady Granville was the second wife of Sir George, and was many
years his junior. The baronet was sixty-four, and in spite of the
fact that he was an experienced man of the world, whose wealth
enabled him to get his own way, he was easily managed by his
beautiful young wife.</p>
<p>Sir George, with a passion for chess and a predilection for a
quiet life, had at the instance of his wife, taken a big house on
the front at the fashionable resort of Staveley and had plunged
into its social gaieties. That afternoon he had revolted to the
extent of excusing himself from accompanying her to a garden fête
in aid of the funds of the Red Cross by declaring that he must stay
at home to welcome his guest, who was to motor down from London.
Lady Granville had gone unaccompanied to the fête, and on her
return home had adopted the wifely revenge of retiring to rest
early, on the grounds that she had a severe headache.</p>
<p>When Sir George returned to his guest he was in a happy state of
mind.</p>
<p>"It was he, Crewe," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"And nothing wrong?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"No, nothing wrong with him," was the reply. "But he has had the
most extraordinary adventure&mdash;gruesome, in fact."</p>
<p>"Gruesome?" The tone in which Crewe repeated the word showed
that his interest had been aroused.</p>
<p>"Well, you might not call it gruesome, Crewe, as you have had so
much to do with gruesome tragedies, but the fact of the matter is
the boy seems to have discovered a murder."</p>
<p>"A murder?"</p>
<p>"That is how the police look at it, he says. Harry rang me up
from the police station at Ashlingsea&mdash;a fishing village about
twelve miles from here along the coast. His horse went lame and he
was caught in the storm. He came across an old farm-house and went
there for shelter, but he found the house was empty. He got in
somehow, and on going upstairs found the dead body of a young
man&mdash;the owner of the farm. Lumsden the owner's name is; quite
a boy, that is to say, something under thirty. Cliff Farm is the
name of the place. I know it well&mdash;I have often passed it
while out motoring."</p>
<p>"How was he killed&mdash;did your nephew say?"</p>
<p>"Shot."</p>
<p>"The dead body was there and the house empty," said Crewe, in a
meditative voice. "That looks as if the police will not have much
difficulty in picking up the scent. The fact that he would be alone
could not have been known to many people."</p>
<p>"I suppose not. I do not profess to be quite clear about
everything Harry told me because I was so pleased to hear his voice
and so astonished at his adventure. I went straight upstairs and
told my wife. I know she was anxious about Harry though she said
nothing before retiring&mdash;that is her way. Of course I only
told her that Harry was safe. I said nothing about a murder because
it would upset her. But, as I was saying, this young Lumsden,
according to what Harry has learned from the police sergeant at
Ashlingsea, lived alone. He didn't farm his land: he was a bit of a
recluse."</p>
<p>"How far away is his farm?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"About nine or ten miles from here. What about motoring over in
the morning?"</p>
<p>"Can we pick up your nephew? I should like to hear his account
at first hand."</p>
<p>"We can go over to Ashlingsea first and bring him back to the
farm with us. He is staying at an inn there, but I can get the
Ashlingsea police station, from where Harry rang up, to let him
know that we will be over for him in the car in the morning."</p>
<p>Crewe nodded. Sir George mixed himself another whisky and soda,
and lit a cigar. Crewe also lit a cigar, and then they settled
themselves in front of the fire for a chat before retiring.</p>
<p>The tie between the great crime investigator and his host was
chess. Sir George Granville had been in the front rank of English
chess-players when Crewe disappointed the chess world by suddenly
retiring from match chess, at the outset of a brilliant career, in
order to devote his wonderful gifts of intuition and insight to
crime detection. His intellect was too vigorous and active to be
satisfied with the sedate triumphs of chess; his restless
temperament and vital force needed a wider and more vigorous
scope.</p>
<p>But, despite the wide fame he had won as a criminologist, chess
enthusiasts still shook their heads when his name was mentioned, as
people are wont to do when they hear the name of a man of brilliant
parts who has not made the most of his life. It was nothing to them
that Crewe had achieved fame in the rôle he had chosen for himself;
that the press frequently praised him as a public benefactor who
had brought to justice many dangerous criminals who would have
escaped punishment but for his subtle skill. These were vain
triumphs for a man who had beaten Turgieff and the young South
American champion, and had seemed destined to bring the world's
championship to England.</p>
<p>The chess tie between Crewe and Sir George Granville had long
ago strengthened into mutual regard. Sir George liked and admired
Crewe, though he did not understand the depths of his character.
Crewe respected the baronet for the shrewd ability with which he
controlled his large interests, and the fact that he had never
allowed his career as a business man to warp the kindliness of his
nature or interfere with the natural generosity of his
disposition.</p>
<p>They talked of various things: of chess, at first, as is
inevitable with two chess-players. Sir George pulled up the
chess-table and reset the abandoned game in order to see if there
was not some defence to Black's position at the stage when the game
was abandoned&mdash;the baronet had played with the black pieces.
He came to the conclusion that there wasn't, and congratulated
Crewe on his attack.</p>
<p>"Do you know, I cannot help regretting sometimes that you have
practically given up the game," he added, as he placed the ivory
chess-men one by one in the box. "It is a long while since England
has had a really great chess-player."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Crewe. "There are more things in
life than chess."</p>
<p>"Some people do not think so," replied Sir George, with a smile.
"Your old opponent Merton was telling me at the club the other
night that he would consider his life had been well spent if he
could but find a sound answer to that new opening of
Talsker's."</p>
<p>"That is proof that chess gets hold of one too much," replied
Crewe, with an answering smile.</p>
<p>"Still, you might have been champion of England," pursued Sir
George meditatively.</p>
<p>Crewe shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>"One cannot have it both ways," he said.</p>
<p>"You prefer crime investigation to chess?" continued Sir George
inquiringly.</p>
<p>"In some ways&mdash;yes. Both have their fascination, but in
chess the human element is lacking. It is true you have an
opponent, but he is not like your hidden opponent in crime. When
your hidden opponent has intelligence, then the game is
wonderful&mdash;while it lasts. But intelligence in crime is as
rare as it is in every other walk of life. Most crimes are like
chess problems&mdash;once you find the key-move, the rest is easy.
The really perfect crime mystery is as rare as a perfect chess
problem. As a rule, the machinery of the human brain is not
delicately adjusted enough, or sufficiently complex, to devise a
problem both complex and subtle in crime&mdash;or in chess."</p>
<p>Sir George did not speak. It was so rarely that Crewe could be
induced to speak of his experiences in crime investigation that he
did not wish to check him by interrupting. But Crewe showed no sign
of continuing. He sighed slightly, threw his half-smoked cigar into
the fire, produced a large brierwood pipe with an amber mouthpiece,
and slowly filled it, with his eyes fixed on the flames.</p>
<p>They remained thus for some moments in silence, though Sir
George kept glancing from time to time at his companion. Several
times the baronet was on the verge of speaking, but checked
himself. At length Crewe, without looking away from the fire,
said:</p>
<p>"You would like to ask me to go into this case your nephew has
discovered to-night, but you do not think it would be quite
courteous on your part to do so, because I am your guest."</p>
<p>"Well, yes, I <i>was</i> thinking that, though I don't know how
you guessed it," said Sir George, in some surprise. "For more
reasons than one I am worried about my nephew getting mixed up with
this tragedy."</p>
<p>"Tell me why," said Crewe sympathetically, turning away from the
fire and looking at his host.</p>
<p>It was past one o'clock when Crewe retired to his room. The
object of his visit to Sir George Granville had been to obtain a
rest after some weeks of investigation into the Malmesbury case, as
the newspapers called it; his investigation having resulted in the
capture of the elusive Malmesbury who had swindled the insurance
companies out of £20,000 by arranging his own death and burial.</p>
<p>Crewe smiled to himself once or twice as he slowly undressed.
Instead of entering into a quiet week-end he found that within a
few hours of his arrival he was on the threshold of another
investigation. He had not met his host's nephew, Harry Marsland, as
the young man had left for his ride on the downs before Crewe
reached the house. But from what Sir George had told him Crewe felt
attracted to the young man. Marsland, who was the only son of Sir
George's only sister, had purchased a junior partnership in a firm
of consulting engineers shortly after attending his majority, but
as soon as the war broke out he offered his services and obtained a
commission.</p>
<p>He had seen over six months' fighting before being wounded by a
shell. The long strain of warfare, the shock of the explosion and
the wounds he had received in the head from shell splinters made
his recovery very slow. He had been in hospital for three months,
and though now convalescent he would never be fit for service again
and had been invalided out of the army. There had been a time in
hospital when his life hung by a thread. During days and nights of
delirium his mind had been haunted by the scenes of horror he had
witnessed at the front. He had seen hundreds of men go through the
agonies of death from terrible wounds and gas torture; he had seen
human forms blown to pieces, and the men falling in hundreds from
machine-gun fire as they charged the German trenches.</p>
<p>The hospital doctors had hinted to Sir George of the possibility
of his nephew's reason being affected by what he had gone through,
but fortunately the young man was spared this calamity. Sir George
had been warned not to let his nephew talk about the war and to
keep his mind occupied with more cheerful subjects of conversation.
In pursuance of these instructions no reference was made to the war
in young Marsland's presence, and his rank as captain was
studiously forgotten.</p>
<p>It was on the ground of his nephew's health and the danger that
lay in mental worry that Sir George Granville begged Crewe, before
he retired, to promise to investigate the crime at Cliff Farm if it
turned out to be a case which was likely to baffle the police and
result in protracted worry to those innocently brought into it,
Crewe recognized the force of the appeal and had promised to give
some time to the case if the circumstances seemed to demand it. He
reserved his final decision until after the visit to Cliff Farm,
which Sir George had arranged to make in the morning.</p>
<p>Anxiety on his nephew's behalf got Sir George out of bed early,
and when Crewe reached the breakfast-room he found his host waiting
for him. The heartiness with which he greeted Crewe seemed to
embody some relief after a strain on patience.</p>
<p>"I rang up Ashlingsea police station half an hour ago and asked
them to make some inquiries about Harry," said Sir George. "He
doesn't seem to be much the worse for his night's experience. At
all events, the landlady sent word back that he had gone out for a
swim."</p>
<p>"I am very glad to hear that he is all right," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"They have given him our message," continued Sir George, "so he
will be waiting for us."</p>
<p>"It ought not to take us much more than half an hour to run
over. Is the road good?"</p>
<p>"Fairly good. We will get away as soon as we have finished
breakfast. I told my wife not to expect us back until after lunch.
That will give you time to look over the farm-house where the man
was murdered."</p>
<p>Crewe smiled slightly at his host's idea that it would not take
him long to reconstruct the crime.</p>
<p>"Are we to keep the object of our journey a secret from Lady
Granville when we return?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Well, no. The fact of the matter is that I told her all about
it this morning. It was best to do so. She will be of valuable
assistance in looking after Harry if he has been upset by his
experiences of last night."</p>
<p>They finished breakfast quickly, and Sir George got up from his
chair.</p>
<p>"I told Harris to have the car ready," he said. "It will be
waiting for us."</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were in the car and were going along
the front at a good rate. When the houses became scattered, the
road left the outline of the shore, made a detour round some sand
dunes about a mile from Staveley, and then stretched like a white
ribbon along the cliffs, between the downs and the sea, to the
distant village of Ashlingsea. The road justified Sir George's
description as fairly good, but there were places where it was very
narrow, the width being scarcely sufficient to allow one vehicle to
pass another. On the side where the road joined the downs there was
a ditch, and in some places the water had collected and formed a
pool.</p>
<p>"What is this?" exclaimed Sir George, as he pointed to an object
at the side of the road some distance away.</p>
<p>The object was a motor-car, which had struck the ditch and
overturned. Part of the car was lying on the downs. One of the
front wheels had been wrenched out of position. To Crewe's surprise
the chauffeur drove past without more than a sidelong glance at the
wreck.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Crewe. "We must have a look at this."</p>
<p>"Yes, we may as well have a look at it," said Sir George, as the
car stopped. "But it is only one of Gosford's old cars. He has a
garage at Staveley and has three or four old cars which he lets out
on hire. They are always coming to grief. Quite a common thing to
find them stuck up and refusing to budge. The occupants have to get
out and walk."</p>
<p>Crewe got out of the car to inspect the wreck, but Sir George
did not follow him. He was content to look on from his seat in the
car. With some impatience he watched Crewe, as the detective
examined the car first on one side and then the other. Crewe went
back along the road for about forty yards and examined the track
the wheels had made in running off the road and striking the ditch.
Then he stood back a few yards, and, going down on his knees,
examined the grass. He put his shoulder underneath the upturned
side of the car to judge the weight of the vehicle.</p>
<p>"I believe we could turn it over," he called out to Sir George.
"It is not very heavy."</p>
<p>"Get out, Harris, and see what you can do," said Sir George.</p>
<p>He sat and watched Crewe and Harris exerting their strength to
lift the car. They were not successful in moving it.</p>
<p>"Do you mind, Sir George?" said Crewe persuasively.</p>
<p>Sir George did mind, but convention demanded that he should
pretend to his guest that he did not.</p>
<p>"Gosford won't thank us," was the length of the protest he
offered. "We may give the thing a bump that will bring it to
pieces."</p>
<p>"I do not want to shove it right over," explained Crewe. "If we
can get it on its side so that I can have a look at it inside I
will be satisfied."</p>
<p>Sir George's contribution to the task turned the scale. Slowly
the car was raised until it rested on its right side. Crewe bent
down and inspected the inside of the car and the driver's seat.</p>
<p>"Thanks," he said. "I've got all I want."</p>
<p>"And what is that you wanted?" demanded Sir George, in
astonishment.</p>
<p>"Several things," said Crewe. "I wanted to get an idea of when
the accident took place."</p>
<p>"How on earth could you expect to tell that?" asked Sir
George.</p>
<p>"By the state of the car&mdash;outside and inside. The way the
mud is splashed on the outside indicates that the car was out in
last night's storm. The wet state of the cushions inside showed
that rain had fallen on them&mdash;they must have got wet before
the car capsized."</p>
<p>"Extremely interesting," said Sir George. "I'd never have
thought of these things. Perhaps you can tell how many people were
in the car at the time."</p>
<p>"No. All I can say is that one of them was injured, but not very
seriously, as far as I can make out."</p>
<p>"And how do you make that out?" asked Sir George.</p>
<p>"By the blood-stains on the grass at the side of the car."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>POLICE-SERGEANT Westaway sat in the sitting-room of Cliff Farm
preparing an official report, with the assistance of his
subordinate, Police-Constable Heather, whose help consisted in
cordially agreeing with his superior on any point on which the
sergeant condescended to ask his advice.</p>
<p>The constable was a short, florid-face, bullet-headed young man,
and he whistled cheerfully as he explored the old farm-house. His
superior officer was elderly and sallow, with hollow dark eyes, a
long black beard streaked with grey, and a saturnine expression,
which was the outward manifestation of a pessimistic disposition
and a disordered liver.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway looked like a man who found life a miserable
business. A quarter of a century spent in a dull round of official
duties in the fishing village of Ashlingsea, as guardian of the
morals of its eight hundred inhabitants, had deepened his natural
bent towards pessimism and dyspepsia. He felt himself qualified to
adorn a much higher official post, but he forbore to air his
grievance in public because he thought the people with whom his lot
was cast were not worth wasting speech upon. By his aloofness and
taciturnity he had acquired a local reputation for wisdom, which
his mental gifts scarcely warranted.</p>
<p>"Heather," he said, pausing in his writing and glancing up
irritably as his subordinate entered the room, "do not make that
noise."</p>
<p>"What noise, sergeant?" asked Constable Heather, who gathered
his impressions slowly.</p>
<p>"That whistling. It disturbs me. Besides, there is a dead man in
the house."</p>
<p>"All right, sergeant, I forgot all about him." Constable Heather
stopped in the middle of a lively stave, sat down on a chair, got
up again, and went out of the room with a heavy tread.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway returned to his official report with a worried
expression on his gaunt face. He was a country police officer with
no previous experience of murders, and twenty-five years' official
vegetation in Ashlingsea, with nothing more serious in the way of
crime to handle than occasional outbreaks of drunkenness or an odd
case of petty larceny, had made him rusty in official procedure,
and fearful of violating the written and unwritten laws of
departmental red tape. He wrote and erased and rewrote,
occasionally laying down his pen to gaze out of the open window for
inspiration.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day in early autumn. The violent storm of the
previous night had left but few traces of its visit. The sun was
shining in a clear blue sky, and the notes of a skylark singing
joyously high above the meadow in front of the farm floated in
through the open window. The winding cliff road was white and clean
after the heavy rain, and the sea was once more clear and green,
with little white-flecked waves dancing and sparkling in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway, gloomily glancing out at this pleasing
prospect, saw two men entering the farm from the road. They had
been cycling, and were now pushing their machines up the
gravel-path to the front door. One of them was in police uniform,
and the other was a young man about thirty years of age, clad in
cycling tweeds and knickerbockers, with a tweed cap on the back of
his curly head. He had blue eyes and a snub nose, and a cigarette
dangled from his lower lip. He was a stranger to Sergeant Westaway,
but that acute official had no hesitation in placing him as a
detective from Scotland Yard. To the eye of pessimism he looked
like the sort of man that Scotland Yard would send to assist the
country police. His companion in uniform was Detective-Inspector
Payne, of the County police headquarters at Lewes, and was well
known to Sergeant Westaway. The latter had no difficulty in
arriving at the conclusion that the County Commissioner of Police,
having several other mysterious crimes to occupy the limited number
of detectives at his disposal, had asked for the assistance of
Scotland Yard in unravelling the murder at Cliff Farm. Sergeant
Westaway knew what this would mean to him. He would have a great
deal to do In coaching the Scotland Yard man regarding local
conditions, but would get none of the credit of sheeting home the
crime to the murderer. The Scotland Yard man would see to that.</p>
<p>"How are you, Westaway?" exclaimed Inspector Payne, as he stood
his bicycle against the wall of the house near the front door.
"What do you mean by giving us a murder when we've got our hands
full? We've burglaries in half a dozen towns, a murder at Denham,
two unidentified bodies washed ashore in a boat at Hemsley, and the
disappearance from Lewes of a well-known solicitor who is wanted
for embezzling trust funds. Let me introduce you to Detective
Gillett, of Scotland Yard. I'm turning the investigation of this
murder of yours over to him. You will give him all the assistance
he wants."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Sergeant Westaway.</p>
<p>"Glad to meet you, Westaway," said Detective Gilett, as he shook
hands with the Sergeant.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway had come to the door to meet the new-comers,
and he now led the way back to the room where he had been preparing
his report.</p>
<p>Detective Gillett took up a position by the open window, and
sniffed gratefully at the soft air.</p>
<p>"Fine view, here," he said, waving his hand in the direction of
the cliff road and open bay. "Fine, bracin'
air&mdash;sea&mdash;country&mdash;birds&mdash;and all that sort of
thing. You chaps in the country have all the best of it&mdash;the
simple life, and no hustle or bustle."</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway looked darkly at the speaker as though he
suspected him of a desire to rob him of the grievance he had
brooded over in secret for twenty-five years.</p>
<p>"It's dull enough," he said ungraciously.</p>
<p>"But the air, man, the air!" said the London detective, inhaling
great gulps of oxygen as he spoke. "It's exhilarating; it's
glorious! Why, it should keep you going until you reach a
hundred."</p>
<p>"Too salt," commented Sergeant Westaway curtly.</p>
<p>"The more salt in it the longer it will preserve you," said
Gillett. "What a glorious day it is."</p>
<p>"The day is right enough," said Westaway. "But to-morrow will be
different."</p>
<p>"Westaway doesn't like to be enthusiastic about this locality
for fear we will shift him somewhere else," said Inspector Payne.
"However, let us get to business. I must be on my way back to Lewes
in an hour."</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway coughed in order to clear his throat, and then
began his narrative in a loud official voice:</p>
<p>"At five minutes past nine last night a gentleman named Marsland
came to the police station. I was in my office at the time,
preparing a report. He told me that he had found the dead body of a
man in this house."</p>
<p>"Who is this Marsland?" asked Inspector Payne. "Does he live in
the district?"</p>
<p>"He does not," replied the sergeant. "He lives at Staveley. That
is to say, he lives in London, but he is staying at Staveley. He is
staying there with his uncle, Sir George Granville."</p>
<p>"I know Sir George," said the inspector. "And so this young
gentleman who discovered the body is his nephew. How old is
he?"</p>
<p>"About twenty-eight, I should say."</p>
<p>"What sort of young man is he? How did he impress you?"</p>
<p>"He impressed me as being an honest straightforward young
gentleman. He gave me a very clear statement of who he was and how
he came to call in at this farm last night. Nevertheless, I took
the precaution of telephoning to Inspector Murchison at Staveley
and asking him to have inquiries made. The inspector's report
coincides with what Mr. Marsland told me. He has been in ill-health
and came down from London to Staveley to recuperate. He has been
there five days. Yesterday he left Staveley for a ride on the
downs. He got lost and was caught in the storm which came up
shortly after dusk. His horse went lame, and seeing this house he
came here for shelter. The horse is in the stable now. There was no
light in the house, and when he went to the front door to knock he
found it open. He struck a match and lit a candle which was on the
hallstand. He could see no one about. Then he lit a lamp in this
room and sat down to wait until the storm was over. He was sitting
here for some time listening to the rain when suddenly he heard a
crash above. He took the lamp and made his way upstairs. In a
sitting-room on the first floor he found the dead body of a man in
an armchair. At first he thought the man had died a natural death,
but on inspecting the body he found that the man had been shot
through the body. As the storm was abating, Mr. Marsland made his
way down to Ashlingsea and reported his discovery to me."</p>
<p>"And what did you do?" asked Inspector Payne, in an
authoritative voice.</p>
<p>"I closed the station and in company with Mr. Marsland I knocked
up Police-Constable Heather. Then the three of us came here. I
found the body as Mr. Marsland had described. I identified the body
as that of Frank Lumsden, the owner of this farm. Leaving Heather
in charge of it, I returned to Ashlingsea accompanied by Mr.
Marsland, and reported the matter by telephone to headquarters at
Lewes, as you are aware, inspector. This morning I returned here to
make a minute inspection of the scene of the crime and to prepare
my report."</p>
<p>"Is the body upstairs now?" asked Detective Gillett.</p>
<p>"It has been left exactly as it was found. I gave Heather orders
that he was not to touch it."</p>
<p>"What sort of a man was this Lumsden?" asked Inspector Payne.
"Had he any enemies?"</p>
<p>"He may have," replied the cautious sergeant. "There are some
who bore him no good will."</p>
<p>"Why was that?"</p>
<p>"Because they thought he hadn't acted rightly by them. He was
the executor of his grandfather's will, but he didn't pay the
legacies his grandfather left. He said there was no money. His
grandfather drew all his money out of the bank when the war broke
out, and no one was ever able to find where he hid it. But there
are some who say Frank Lumsden found it and stuck to it all."</p>
<p>"This is interesting," said Detective Gillett. "We must go into
it thoroughly later on."</p>
<p>"And what makes it more interesting is that a sort of plan
showing where the money was hidden has disappeared," continued
Sergeant Westaway. "It disappeared after Lumsden was murdered. Mr.
Marsland told me that he found it when he was going upstairs to
find out the cause of the crash he heard. It was lying on the
second bottom stair. Mr. Marsland picked it up and put it on the
table with the candle stuck on top of it. But when we came here
this morning it was gone."</p>
<p>"That is strange," commented Inspector Payne. "What was the plan
like? And how does Mr. Marsland know it had anything to do with the
missing money?"</p>
<p>"Of course he doesn't know for certain. But when I happened to
tell him about the murdered man's grandfather and the missing money
he called to mind a strange-looking paper he had picked up. As he
described it to me, it had some figures written in the shape of a
circle on it, and some letters or writing above and below the
circle of figures. He did not scrutinize it very closely when he
first found it, for he intended to examine it later."</p>
<p>"And it disappeared after Mr. Marsland left the farm to go to
the police station?" asked Detective Gillett.</p>
<p>"Showing, to my mind, that the murderer was actually in the
house when Mr. Marsland left," added Sergeant Westaway, with
impressive solemnity. "In all probability the murderer was hiding
in the top floor at the time. I have ascertained that the crash Mr.
Marsland heard was caused by a picture being knocked down and the
glass broken. This picture I found on the stairs leading to the top
floor. It used to hang on the wall near the top of the stairs. My
theory is that the murderer, feeling his way in the dark while Mr.
Marsland was in this room, accidentally knocked it down."</p>
<p>"I take it that Marsland did not go up to the top floor but left
the house after examining the body," remarked Detective
Gillett.</p>
<p>"That is so," replied the Sergeant. "He forgot about the crash
when he found the body of a murdered man. His first thought was to
communicate with the police."</p>
<p>"And the murderer, leaving the house after Marsland had gone,
found this plan on the table and took it?" suggested Detective
Gillett. "That is my theory," replied Sergeant Westaway. "I forgot
to say, however, that the plan was probably stolen in the first
place from the murdered man's pocket-book&mdash;his pocket-book was
found on the table near him. It had been opened and most of the
papers it contained had been removed. The papers were scattered
about the table. The way I see the crime is this: the murderer had
killed his victim, had removed his pocket-book, and had obtained
possession of the plan. He was making his way downstairs to escape
when he saw Marsland in the doorway. In his alarm he dropped the
plan on the stairs and then crept softly upstairs to the top of the
house. After Mr. Marsland left, the murderer came downstairs again,
looked about for the plan, and after finding it then made off."</p>
<p>"A very ingenious reconstruction, sergeant," said Inspector
Payne. "I shouldn't wonder if it proved to be correct. What do you
say, Gillett?"</p>
<p>"Westaway is wasting his time down here," said the young
detective. "We ought to have him at Scotland Yard."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>SERGEANT Westaway was flattered at the manner in which his
theory of the murder had been received by men who were far more
experienced than himself in investigating crime. His sallow cheeks
flushed with pleasure and his pessimism waned a little. In his
determination to place his hearers in possession of all the facts
concerning the crime and the victim he gave them details regarding
Lumsden's mode of life at Cliff Farm after his discharge from the
army, and the gossip that was current in the district concerning
him. While he was dealing with these matters they heard a motor-car
approaching. It stopped outside the gates of the farmhouse, and the
three police officials went to the door to see who had arrived.</p>
<p>"Why, it's Crewe!" exclaimed Detective Gillett, in a tone of
surprise. "I wonder who has put him on to this?"</p>
<p>"That is Sir George Granville with him&mdash;the stout elderly
man," said Inspector Payne.</p>
<p>"The other gentleman is Mr. Marsland," said Sergeant
Westaway.</p>
<p>"Which is Crewe and which is Marsland?" asked Inspector
Payne.</p>
<p>"The tall one on the left is Crewe," answered Detective
Gillett.</p>
<p>As a police official, Inspector Payne was indignant at the idea
of Crewe intruding into the case, but as a man he was delighted at
the opportunity of meeting the famous private detective who had so
often scored over Scotland Yard by unravelling mysteries which had
baffled the experts of the London detective department. Crewe's
fame had even penetrated to Ashlingsea, and Sergeant Westaway
studied the private detective with awed interest as the three
occupants of the motor-car walked up the drive.</p>
<p>Inspector Payne had pictured Crewe as a more striking
personality than the tall young man in tweeds who was accompanying
Sir George Granville and his nephew. The latter was talking
earnestly, and Crewe was listening closely. Inspector Payne had an
opportunity of noting the distinction and character which marked
the detective's face in repose: the clear, clean-cut profile, the
quick penetration and observation of his dark eyes as they took in
the exterior of Cliff Farm. He concluded that Crewe was rather
young for the fame he had achieved&mdash;certainly under forty:
that he liked his face; that he looked like a gentleman; and that
his tweed suit displayed a better cut than any provincial tailor
had ever achieved.</p>
<p>His companion, Sir George Granville's nephew, was a young man of
Saxon type, fair-haired, blue-eyed, with a clear skin which had
been tanned brown as the result of his war campaigning in France.
He was two or three inches shorter than Crewe, but was well set up
and well-built, and although he did not wear khaki his recent
connection with the army was indicated by his military carriage and
bearing.</p>
<p>After the necessary introductions Crewe explained with an air of
modesty that, Sir George Granville's nephew having had the
misfortune to become associated with the tragedy through the
discovery of the body, Sir George, as a public man, had conceived
the idea that he ought to do something towards discovering the
author of the crime. That was how he himself came to be present. He
hoped that he would not be in the way of the police.</p>
<p>"Not at all; not at all," said Inspector Payne, answering for
the County Police. "We'll be glad of your help. And as for anything
we can do for you, Mr. Crewe, you have only to ask."</p>
<p>"That is very kind of you," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"You are just in time," continued Inspector Payne. "Gillett and
I have been here only a few minutes. We were just going upstairs to
look at the body when you arrived."</p>
<p>On their way upstairs Gillett drew attention to some marks on
the margin of the stairs between the carpet on the staircase and
the wall. These marks were irregular in shape, and they looked as
if they had been made by wiping portions of the stairs with a dirty
wet cloth. Some of the stairs bore no mark.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that some one has been wiping up spots of blood
on the stairs," said Inspector Payne, as he examined the marks
closely.</p>
<p>On the linoleum covering the landing of the first flight there
were more traces of the kind, the last of them being beside the
door of the room in which the body had been discovered.</p>
<p>The dead man was still in the arm-chair near the window. There
was such a resemblance to life in his stooping posture that the men
entering the room found it difficult at first to realize they were
confronted with the corpse of a man who had been murdered. A ray of
sunlight fell through the narrow window on the bent head, revealing
the curly brown hair and the youthful contour of the neck. The
right arm was slightly extended from the body towards the table
near the arm-chair in which the corpse was seated, as though the
murdered man had been about to pick up the pocket-book which lay on
the table. The pocket-book was open, and the papers which had been
in it were scattered about the table.</p>
<p>Payne, Gillett and Crewe inspected the body closely. Sir George
Granville and Marsland waited a little distance away while the
others conducted their examination. The dead man had been fully
dressed when he was shot. On the left side of his vest was the hole
made by the bullet, and around it was a discoloured patch where the
blood, oozing from the wound, had stained the tweed. There were
numerous blood-stains on the floor near the dead man's feet, and
also near the window at the side of the arm-chair.</p>
<p>"I see that the window is broken," said Inspector Payne,
pointing to one of the panes in the window near the arm-chair.</p>
<p>"By a bullet," said Sergeant Westaway. He pulled down the window
blind and pointed to a hole in it which had evidently been made by
a bullet. "When I came in the blind was down. I pulled it up in
order to let in some light. But the fact that there is a hole in
the window blind shows that the murder was committed at night, when
the blind was down. I should say two shots were fired. The first
went through the window, and the other killed him."</p>
<p>"I think the bullet that killed him has gone through him," said
Crewe, who had moved the body in order to examine the back of it.
"It looks as if he was shot from behind, because the wound in the
back is lower down that the one in front." He pointed to a hole in
the back of the coat where the cloth showed a similar discoloured
patch to the one in the vest.</p>
<p>"It must have been a powerful weapon if the bullet has gone
through him," said Gillett. "That means we shall have no bullet to
guide us as to the calibre of the weapon, unless we can find the
one that went through the window."</p>
<p>"Perhaps there was only one shot fired after all," remarked
Inspector Payne. "The victim may have been standing by the window
when he was shot, and then have staggered to the chair. Otherwise
if he were shot in the back while sitting in the chair the bullet
should be embedded in the chair or wall. But I can see no sign of
it."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily," said Gillett. "Look at the position on the
arm-chair. It is possible that the bullet, after going through the
man, went through the window. That would account for the broken
pane of glass."</p>
<p>The pocket-book and the papers it contained were next examined.
Inspector Payne asked Marsland concerning the mysterious plan he
had picked up on the stairs. Marsland borrowed a sheet of paper
from the inspector's large official note-book and drew a rough
sketch of the plan as he remembered it. He explained that as he had
lost his glasses while out in the storm he had not been able to
make a close study of the plan. While he was engaged in reproducing
the plan as far as he remembered it, Sergeant Westaway enlightened
Crewe and Sir George Granville about the theory he had formed that
the murderer was in the house when Marsland discovered the body,
and that, after Marsland left, the murderer made his escape and
took from the sitting-room downstairs the plan he had dropped on
the stairs when he heard Marsland in the house.</p>
<p>"What do you make of this, Mr. Crewe?" asked Inspector Payne, as
he took up the paper on which Marsland had sketched what he
recalled of the plan. "Do you think this was meant to show where
the old grandfather had his money?"</p>
<p>"That is very probable," said Crewe. "But it is not worth while
trying to solve the riddle from a sketch drawn from memory. Get the
murderer and you will probably get the original plan as well."</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway, in pursuance of his duties as guide, took his
visitors downstairs to the sitting-room for the purpose of showing
them how the window had been forced in order to provide an
entrance. He pointed to a mark on the sash which indicated that a
knife had been used to force back the catch.</p>
<p>This was the room in which Miss Maynard had been sitting when
Marsland had arrived to obtain shelter from the storm. Marsland
noticed the chair beside which she had stood while they were in the
room together before going upstairs to investigate the cause of the
crash they had heard. He gave a start as he saw behind the chair a
small tortoiseshell comb such as ladies sometimes wear to keep
their hair up. He stooped quickly to pick it up, and as he did so
he realized that he had blundered badly. In order to rectify the
blunder he made a weak attempt to hide the comb, but he saw
Detective Gillett's eye on him. "What have we here?" asked the
Scotland Yard man genially.</p>
<p>Marsland held out his hand with the comb resting in it.</p>
<p>"A woman in the case," commented Inspector Payne. "That ought to
help to simplify matters."</p>
<p>Marsland bit his lips at the thought of how he had been false to
his promise to Miss Maynard. He had kept her name out of the
discovery of the crime, but he had unwittingly directed attention
to the fact that a woman had only recently been in that room.</p>
<p>The comb was handed to Crewe for examination. It was about three
inches long and was slightly convex in shape. On the outside was a
thin strip of gold mounting. Crewe handed the comb back.</p>
<p>"You sat in this room before going upstairs, Marsland?" he
asked, turning to Sir George's nephew.</p>
<p>"Yes; I was here about a quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes."</p>
<p>"Was the window open when you came in? Did you close it?"</p>
<p>"I did not close it, but it must have been closed, as otherwise
I would have noticed it open. It was raining and blowing hard while
I was here." Marsland thought to himself that any information he
could give about the window was useless in view of the fact that
Miss Maynard had been in the room some time before he arrived.</p>
<p>"Was this the room in which you found the lamp that you took
upstairs?" continued Crewe.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I think you told me that there was no light in the house when
you entered?"</p>
<p>"The place was in darkness. I found a candlestick on the
hallstand. I lit that first and after coming in here I lit the
lamp." He had decided to adhere in his statements to what Miss
Maynard had told him she had done before he arrived.</p>
<p>"Did you notice when you lit the lamp whether the lamp chimney
was hot, warm, or quite cold?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"I cannot be certain. I think it was cold, or otherwise I should
have noticed."</p>
<p>"You lit the lamp before you heard the crash which startled
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I lit it a few moments after I came into the room."</p>
<p>"Any foot-marks outside the window?" said Inspector Payne,
thrusting his head out of the open window. "Yes, there they are,
quite plainly, in the ground. Made by heavy hobnailed boots. We
must get plaster impressions of those, Gillett. They are an
important clue."</p>
<p>"I notice, inspector," said Crewe, "that there are no marks of
any kind on the wall-paper beneath the window. One would expect
that a man getting in through this window would touch the
wall-paper with one foot while he was getting through the window,
and as it was a wet night there ought to be some mark on it."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily," replied the inspector. "He may have jumped to
the floor without touching the wall-paper."</p>
<p>"But there do not seem to be any impressions inside the house of
these heavy nailed boots," returned Crewe. "Those impressions
beneath the window show that they were made when the ground was
soft from the rain. Wet muddy boots with nails in the soles ought
to leave some traces on the carpet of this room and on the
staircase."</p>
<p>"And what about those marks we saw on the staircase? They show
that some one had been over the staircase with a wet rag."</p>
<p>"To wipe out the traces of those boots?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Why did the person wearing those boots walk on the uncarpeted
part of the stairs near the wall instead of the carpeted part?"</p>
<p>"Because he knew that it would be easier for him to remove the
traces of his footprints from the wood than from the carpet."</p>
<p>Crewe smiled at the ingenuity displayed by the inspector.</p>
<p>"One more doubt, inspector," he said. "Why did the man who wore
those boots take such care to remove the traces of footprints
inside the house and show so much indifference to the traces he
left outside?"</p>
<p>"Because he thought the rain would wash out the footprints
outside. And so it would have done if it had rained until morning.
Let us go outside and have a good look at them."</p>
<p>They went out by the front door and made their way to the
window, taking care to keep clear of the footprints.</p>
<p>"There you are, Mr. Crewe," said Inspector Payne. "There is
evidence that the man got in through the window." He pointed to a
spot beneath the window where a small piece of mortar between the
brickwork had been broken off about fifteen inches above the
ground. "And look at those parallel scratches on the mortar. It
looks to me as if they were made by the nails in a boot."</p>
<p>"Very true," assented Crewe, examining the marks closely.</p>
<p>"Now let us follow the footsteps to see where they start from,"
continued Inspector Payne.</p>
<p>It was no difficult matter to follow the marks of the heavy
boots. In the soft soil, which had formerly been part of a
flower-bed, they were quite distinct. Even on the grass beyond the
flower-bed the impressions were visible, though not so distinctly.
Eventually they reached the gravel-walk which skirted the front of
the house, and here the traces were lost.</p>
<p>"I should say that the boots which made these marks are the
ordinary heavy type worn by farm-hands and fishermen in this
locality," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"No doubt," answered Inspector Payne. "But, though there are
some hundreds of men in this locality who wear the same type of
boot, the number of pairs of boots absolutely the same are small.
That is particularly the case with these heavy nailed
boots&mdash;the positions of some of the nails vary. A cast of
three or four of the best of these impressions will narrow down the
circle of our investigations. What do you say, Gillett?"</p>
<p>"It looks to me as if it is going to be a comparatively simple
affair."</p>
<p>Inspector Payne turned to Marsland.</p>
<p>"I think you said you found the door open, Mr. Marsland. Do you
mean wide open or partly closed?"</p>
<p>"I found it wide open," replied Marsland. "I thought at the time
that it had not been properly closed and that the wind had blown it
open."</p>
<p>"That means that the murderer got in through this window and
left by the door," said Inspector Payne to Detective Gillett. "He
left it open when he fled."</p>
<p>"But what about Westaway's theory that he was in the house when
Mr. Marsland came here?" asked Gillett. "What about the crash Mr.
Marsland heard when the picture fell down? What about the plan of
the hidden money that disappeared after Mr. Marsland left?"</p>
<p>It was plain that Detective Gillett, who had to investigate the
crime, was not in sympathy with Inspector Payne's method of solving
difficult points by ignoring them.</p>
<p>Inspector Payne stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of interesting little points to be cleared up,"
he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, there are," responded Detective Gillett, "and I've no
doubt we will find more of them as we go along."</p>
<p>It was obvious to Marsland that in keeping silent about Miss
Maynard's presence at Cliff Farm on the night of the storm, and the
means by which she had entered the house, he was placing obstacles
in the way of the elucidation of the tragedy.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>FROM the front gate of Cliff Farm the road wound up the hill
steeply and sinuously, following the broken curves of the coastline
till it disappeared in the cutting of the hill three hundred yards
from the house, and reappeared on the other side. As far as could
be seen from the house, the cutting through the hill was the only
place where the road diverged from the cliff.</p>
<p>No other short cut on a large scale had been attempted by the
makers of the road, which, for the most part, skirted the irregular
outline of the bluff and rocky coast until it seemed a mere white
thread in the distant green of the spacious downs which stretched
for many miles to the waters of the Channel.</p>
<p>On the far side of the cutting the downs came fully into view,
rolling back from the edge of the cliffs to a low range of distant
wooded hills, and stretching ahead till they were merged in the
town of Staveley, nearly ten miles away. Staveley's church spires
could be seen from the headland near Cliff Farm on a clear day, and
the road in front of the farm ran to the town, skirting the edge of
the cliffs for nearly the whole of the way.</p>
<p>Crewe and Marsland walked up the road from the house for some
distance in silence. Sir George Granville had gone back to Staveley
in his car, but his nephew and Crewe had arranged to stay behind
and spend the night at Ashlingsea. Crewe desired to begin his
investigations without delay, and Inspector Payne had asked Mr.
Marsland to remain at Ashlingsea in case Detective Gillett wanted
further light from him on incidental points. As they walked along,
Crewe was thoughtful, and Marsland scrutinized the way-side
closely, anxious to find the spot where his horse had swerved and
stumbled on the previous night. Thus preoccupied, they reached the
highest point of the cliff, a rocky headland which ran out from the
hill-top on the other side of the cutting, forming a landmark well
known to the fishermen of the district.</p>
<p>The headland, which was not more than a hundred yards across at
the base, jutted sharply out into the sea. Immediately beyond it,
on the Staveley side, the road ran along the edge of the cliffs for
several hundred yards, with a light rail fence on the outside as
some protection for traffic from the danger of going over the side
to the rocks below. Where the grassy margin of the headland
narrowed to this dangerous pass, an ancient and faded notice board
on a post which had departed from its perpendicular position warned
drivers that the next portion of the road was DANGEROUS, and a
similar board was affixed to the other end of the protecting
fence.</p>
<p>Marsland stopped opposite the point where the first notice-board
confronted them from the narrowing margin of headland.</p>
<p>"It was somewhere about here that my horse took fright last
night, I think," he said, examining the green bank on the side of
the road farthest from the cliff. "Yes, here is where he slipped."
Crewe examined the deep indentation of hoofmarks with interest.</p>
<p>"It's lucky for you your horse shied in that direction," he
said. "If he had sprung the other way you might have gone over the
cliffs, in spite of the fence. Look here!"</p>
<p>Marsland followed him to the edge of the cliff and glanced over.
The tide was out, and the cliffside fell almost perpendicularly to
the jagged rocks nearly 300 feet below.</p>
<p>"They'd be covered at high tide," said Crewe, pointing downward
to the rocks. "But even if one fell over at high tide there would
not be much chance of escape. The breakers must come in with
terrific force on this rocky coast."</p>
<p>"It's a horribly dangerous piece of road, especially at
night-time," said Marsland. "I suppose there was some bad accident
here at one time or another, which compelled the local authorities
to put up that fence and the warning notices. Even now, it's far
from safe. Somebody's had a narrow escape from going over: look at
that notice-board leaning down on one side. Some passing motor-car
has gone too close to the edge of the road&mdash;probably in the
dark&mdash;and bumped it half over."</p>
<p>"I noticed it," said Crewe. "I agree with you: this piece of
road is highly dangerous. There will be a shocking accident here
some day unless the local authorities close this portion of the
road and make a detour to that point lower down where those sheep
are grazing. But local authorities never act wisely until they have
had an accident. Still, I suppose the people of the country-side
are so well used to this cliff road that they never think of the
danger. Apparently it's the only road between Ashlingsea and
Staveley."</p>
<p>Crewe slowly filled his large pipe, and lit it. He smoked
thoughtfully, gazing round at the scene. The high headland on which
they stood commanded an uninterrupted view of downs, sea, and
coast. It was a clear day, and the distant city of Staveley, with
its towering spires, was silhouetted against the sky like an
etching in grey. To the left the fishing village of Ashlingsea
nestled on the sands, its stone-grey houses gleaming in a silver
setting, the sails of its fishing fleet flecked white on the sunlit
blue of the sea.</p>
<p>On the Ashlingsea side the cliffs fell away quickly, and sloped
down to a level beach less than a mile from the headland. About
five hundred yards from the headland the cliff front was less
precipitous, and a footpath showed a faint trail on its face,
running down to a little stone landing place, where a fisherman
could be seen mooring a boat. Crewe pointed out the path to
Marsland.</p>
<p>"I should like to explore that path," he said. "I should say it
is not very far from Cliff Farm. Do you think you could manage
it?"</p>
<p>The question referred to the fact that Marsland was a wounded
man. Crewe had taken a fancy to Marsland on account of his
unaffected manner and manly bearing. It was evident to him that the
young man had been a good officer, a staunch comrade, and that he
had been extremely popular with the men under him. No word in
reference to Marsland's military career had passed between Crewe
and his companion.</p>
<p>Crewe was anxious to respect the medical advice which forbade
Marsland to discuss the war or anything relating to his experience
at the front. But in order to clear the way for candour and
companionship Crewe thought it best to give an occasional
indication that Sir George Granville had confided in him about his
nephew's state of health and the cause of it. Crewe was somewhat
amused at the pains taken to make Marsland forget his past
connection with the Army, when in so many ways he betrayed to any
keen observer the effects of military training and discipline.</p>
<p>"I can manage it quite easily," said Marsland with a smile, in
reply to Crewe's question. "I am not such a wreck as you'd all like
to make me out. Come along! I'll get to the bottom before you."</p>
<p>They walked along to the cliff path. When they reached it they
found it was not noticeable from the road, which at that point ran
back three hundred yards or more from the cliff to enter the
hill-cutting. Cliff Farm stood in the hollow less than a quarter of
a mile away. The commencement of the path was screened from view by
the furze which grew along the edge of the cliffs at this point. It
took Crewe and Marsland some minutes before they could find the
entrance to the path, but when they did they found the descent by
it to the rocks below tolerably easy, the cliff at this point not
being more than seventy feet high. The track ended abruptly about
fifteen feet from the bottom, but the rocks afforded good foothold
and handhold for the remaining distance.</p>
<p>The tide was out, and the coastline at the foot of the cliffs
showed for miles towards Staveley in black rocky outline, with
broken reefs running hundreds of yards out to sea.</p>
<p>"It's a bad piece of coast," said Marsland, eyeing the reefs and
the rocky foreshore. "If a ship had run ashore anywhere between
here and Staveley in last night's storm she would not have had much
chance."</p>
<p>Crewe did not reply; his keen eyes were fixed on a line of rocks
on the right about a hundred yards from where they stood. He walked
rapidly to the spot, and Marsland could see him stoop down by a
pool in the rocks and pick up something. As he returned, Marsland
saw that the detective was carrying a man's soft grey felt hat,
stained and saturated with sea-water.</p>
<p>"I suppose somebody lost it from the cliffs last night,"
remarked Marsland.</p>
<p>Crewe wrung the hat as dry as he could with his hands, rolled it
up, and placed it in an inside pocket of his coat before
replying.</p>
<p>"I do not think it blew off from the headland," he said. "In
fact, it couldn't have done so. There may be nothing in the find,
but it's worth a few inquiries. But look at that fisherman,
Marsland. He's a picturesque touch of colour."</p>
<p>The fisherman who had been mooring his boat had turned to come
off the rough landing-stage. He stopped when he saw Crewe and
Marsland, and stared suspiciously at them. He was an old man, but
vigorous and upright, with a dark swarthy face, hooked nose, and
flashing black eyes, which contrasted strikingly with a long
snow-white beard. He wore a long red cloak fastened to his neck
with clasps, and reaching nearly to his feet, which were bare.</p>
<p>He stood for a few moments looking at the two men, his red cloak
making a bright splash of colour against the grey stones of the
landing. Then, with a slight shrug of his shoulders, he walked
quickly off the landing-place. Crewe nodded to him pleasantly as he
approached, and asked him to where the path they had just descended
led.</p>
<p>The old man, with a slight shake of his head, pointed to his
lips and his ears, and then, accelerating his pace, walked rapidly
away along the rocks towards the headland.</p>
<p>"Deaf and dumb, poor beggar!" said Marsland, watching his
retreating figure until it turned the headland and was lost to
view. "I say, Crewe, did you ever see such an odd fish on an
English foreshore?"</p>
<p>"Italian, I should say," said Crewe. "But he looks as if he
might have stepped out of a Biblical plate. He would make an
admirable model for St. Peter, with his expressive eyes and hooked
nose and patriarchal beard. We'll have a look at his boat."</p>
<p>They walked along the landing-place to the boat, which had been
moored to an iron ring at the end. It was a halfdecked motor-boat
about twenty feet long, empty except for a coil of rope thrown
loosely in the bottom, and a small hand fishing-net. The boat was
painted white, and the name <i>Zulietta</i> could be seen on the
stern in black letters.</p>
<p>They turned away, and Crewe suggested to his companion that they
should walk along the beach and back to Cliff Farm by the road
instead of returning by the path they had just descended. He added
that he wanted to have a good look at the approach to the farm from
the village.</p>
<p>Marsland readily agreed, and they walked for some distance in
silence. He glanced at Crewe expectantly from time to time, but the
detective appeared to be wrapped in thought. When they had covered
more than half the distance between the landing-place and the point
where the cliffs sloped down to level ground, Marsland spoke.</p>
<p>"Have you reached any conclusions yet, Crewe?"</p>
<p>"About this murder?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"I have not come to many definite conclusions so far," said
Crewe meditatively. "But of one thing I am certain. The unravelling
of this crime is not going to be quite such a simple matter as
Inspector Payne seems to think."</p>
<p>"I gathered that you were doubtful about his theory that the man
who killed Lumsden got in through the window."</p>
<p>"Doubtful about it?" echoed Crewe. "Doubtful is a mild word. I
am absolutely certain that he didn't get in through the
window."</p>
<p>"But the catch was forced."</p>
<p>"It was forced from the inside."</p>
<p>Marsland looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>"How did you find out that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"By inspecting the sash. I had a good look at it from the inside
and out. Apparently it hadn't been opened for some time before last
night, and the marks of the knife which was used to force it were
very distinct in the sash in consequence. But the marks were
broader and more distinct at the top of the sash inside than at the
bottom. Therefore the knife was inserted at the top, and that could
be done only by a man inside the house."</p>
<p>"But why was the window forced if the man was inside?"</p>
<p>"In order to mislead us."</p>
<p>"But the footprints led up to the window."</p>
<p>"No," said Crewe. "They led away from it."</p>
<p>"Surely you are mistaken," said Marsland. "I don't like trying
to put you right on a matter of this kind, but the marks of the
boots were so distinct; they all pointed the one way&mdash;towards
the window."</p>
<p>"Look behind you, at our own footprints in the sand," said
Crewe.</p>
<p>They had left the rocks behind them some time previously and for
five minutes had been walking on a strip of sand which skirted the
cliff road&mdash;now level with the sea&mdash;and broadened into a
beach nearer the village. Crewe pointed to the clear imprint of
their footsteps in the firm wet sand behind them.</p>
<p>"We'll try a little experiment," he said. "Let us walk backwards
for a few yards over the ground we have just covered."</p>
<p>He commenced to do so, and Marsland wonderingly followed suit.
After covering about twenty yards in this fashion Crewe
stopped.</p>
<p>"That will be sufficient for our purpose," he said. "Now let us
compare the two sets of footprints&mdash;the ones we have just
made, and the previous ones. Examine them for yourself, Marsland,
and tell me if you can see any difference."</p>
<p>Marsland did so. With the mystified air of a man performing a
task he did not understand, he first scrutinized the footprints
they had made while walking forwards, and then examined the
backward ones.</p>
<p>"Find any difference in them?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>Marsland stood up and straightened his back with the
self-conscious look of an Englishman who feels he has been made to
do something ridiculous. "I cannot say that I do. They look very
much alike to me."</p>
<p>"You are not very observant," said Crewe, with a smile. "Let me
explain the difference. In ordinary walking a man puts down the
heel of his boot first, and then, as he brings his body forward, he
completes the impression of his foot. He lifts his heel first and
springs off the ball of his foot for the next step. But in walking
backwards a man puts down the ball of his foot first and makes but
a very faint impression with his heel. If he walks very carefully
because he is not sure of the ground, or because it is dark, he may
take four or five steps without bringing his heel to the ground. If
you compare the impressions your boots have made in the sand when
we were walking forward with the others made by walking backward,
you will find that few of the latter marks give the complete
impression of your boot."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see now," said Marsland. "The difference is quite
distinct."</p>
<p>"When I examined the window this afternoon, and came to the
conclusion that it had been forced from the inside, I felt certain
that a murderer who had adopted such a trick in order to mislead
the police would carry it out in every detail," said Crewe. "After
forcing the window he would get out of it in order to leave
footprints underneath the window in the earth outside, and of
course he would walk backwards from the window, in order to convey
the impression that he had walked up to the window through the
garden, forced it and then got into the house. As I expected, I
found the footsteps leading away from the window were deep in the
toe, with hardly any heel marks. It was as plain as daylight that
the man who had made them had walked backwards from the window. But
even if I had not been quite sure of this from the footprints
themselves, there was additional confirmation. The backward
footsteps led straight to a fruit tree about twenty feet from the
window, and on examining that tree I found a small branch&mdash;a
twig&mdash;had been broken and bent just where the footsteps were
lost in the gravel walk. The man who got out of the window had
bumped into the tree. Walking backwards he could neither see nor
feel where he was going."</p>
<p>"I see&mdash;I see," Marsland stood silent for a moment
evidently pondering deeply over Crewe's chain of deductions. "It
seems to me," he said at length, "that this man, clever as he was,
owed a great deal to accident."</p>
<p>"In what respect?"</p>
<p>"Because the window where you found the footprints is the only
window on that side of the house which has a bare patch of earth
underneath. All the others have grass growing right up to the
windows. I noticed that when I saw the footprints. If he had got
out of any of them he would have left no footprints."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, he knew that and chose that window because he
wanted to leave us some footprints. The fact that he selected in
the dark the only window that would serve his purpose shows that he
is a man who knows the place well. He is clever and resourceful,
but that is no reason why we should not succeed in unmasking
him."</p>
<p>"Doesn't the fact that he wore hobnailed boots indicate that he
is a labouring man?"</p>
<p>"My dear Marsland, may he not have worn boots of that kind for
the same reason that he walked backwards&mdash;to mislead us
all?"</p>
<p>"I gathered that you do not agree with Inspector Payne that the
marks on the stairs were caused by the intruder trying to
obliterate with a wet cloth the marks he made by his muddy
boots."</p>
<p>"Outside the house he does his best to leave footprints; and
inside, according to Inspector Payne, he takes special pains to
remove similar traces. It is hopeless trying to reconcile the two
things," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think were the original marks on the stairs
that the intruder was so anxious to remove?"</p>
<p>"Blood-stains."</p>
<p>"But why should he go to the trouble of removing blood-stains on
the stairs and yet leave so much blood about in the room in which
the body was discovered?"</p>
<p>"I have asked myself that question," said Crewe. "At the present
stage it is very difficult to answer."</p>
<p>"You think it adds to the mystery?"</p>
<p>"For the present it does. But it may prove to be a key which
will open many closed doors in this investigation."</p>
<p>"Your mention of closed doors suggests another question," said
Marsland. "Why did this man get out of the window and walk
backwards? If he wanted to leave misleading clues it would have
been just as easy for him to go out by the front door, walk up to
the window from the path so as to leave footprints and then force
the window from the outside."</p>
<p>"Just as easy," assented Crewe. "But it would have taken longer,
because it is more difficult to force the catch of a window from
the outside than the inside. I think that we must assume that he
was pressed for time."</p>
<p>"But I understand that this man Lumsden lived alone. In that
case there would be little danger of interruption."</p>
<p>"A man who has just committed a murder gets into a state of
nervous alarm," was Crewe's reply. "He is naturally anxious to get
away from the scene of the crime."</p>
<p>"But if this man knew the place well he must have known that
Lumsden lived alone, and that the discovery of the crime would not
take place immediately. But for the accident of my taking shelter
there the body might have remained undiscovered for days."</p>
<p>"Quite true. But that does not affect my point that a murderer
is always in a hurry to get away."</p>
<p>"Isn't the fact that he went to the trouble of washing out
blood-stains on the stairs evidence that he was not in a
hurry?"</p>
<p>"No," said Crewe emphatically. "I should be more inclined to
accept it as evidence that he expected some one to call at the
farm&mdash;that either he or Lumsden had an appointment with some
one there."</p>
<p>Marsland looked very hard at Crewe as he recalled the greeting
Miss Maynard had given him when she opened the door to his
knock.</p>
<p>"I did not think of that," he said.</p>
<p>"That supposition gives us a probable explanation why the
blood-stains were wiped off the stairs, and not off the floor of
the room in which you saw the body. The murderer was expecting a
visitor by appointment. The suspicions of this visitor would be
aroused if he saw blood-stains on the stairs. But as he was not
expected to go upstairs the murderer did not trouble about the
stains in the room. This is another indication of pressure of
time."</p>
<p>Marsland felt that Crewe was on the track of discovering Miss
Maynard's presence at the farm. He began to see in the light of
Crewe's deductions that her chief object in having asked him to
keep her name out of the affair was to shelter some one else. But
having given his word he must keep it and stand by the
consequences.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>DETECTIVE GILLETT made a journey to London in order to visit
Somerset House and inspect the will left by James Lumsden, the
grandfather of the man who had been murdered. He had been able to
ascertain, from local sources of information at Ashlingsea, some of
the details of the will, but as an experienced detective he knew
the value of exact details obtained from official sources.</p>
<p>His perusal of the will showed him that Cliff Farm and all the
testator's investments and personal property had been left to his
nephew Frank, with the exception of legacies to three old servants
who had been in his employ for over a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>Gillett had ascertained from previous inquiries that Frank was
at the front in France when his grandfather died. He had been
brought up at the farm, but as his inclinations did not tend to a
farming life, he had left his grandfather, and gone to London,
where he had earned a livelihood as a clerk prior to enlisting in
the Army. According to Ashlingsea gossip, old James Lumsden had
been a man of considerable wealth: though local estimates of his
fortune varied considerably, ranging from £20,000 to five times
that amount. Gillett's inspection of the terms of the will
convinced him that the lower amount was somewhat nearer the correct
figure; and an interview with Messrs. Holding, Thomas &amp;
Holding, the London solicitors who had drawn up the will, supported
this view.</p>
<p>It was the elder Mr. Holding, the senior partner of the firm,
who had transacted Mr. Lumsden's business and had taken the
instructions for drawing up the will. The document had been
executed seven years ago. Mr. Holden, senior, a white haired old
gentleman whose benign appearance seemed out of harmony with the
soulless profession he adorned, told Gillett that Mr. Lumsden had
consulted him on several occasions about business matters, but the
old man was extremely intelligent and capable, and kept his affairs
so entirely in his own hands that he was not a very profitable
client.</p>
<p>The solicitor did not even know the extent of the old farmer's
investments, for his client, who hated to disclose much of his
private affairs even to his solicitor, had taken care when the will
was drawn up not to tell him much about the sources of his income.
Mr. Holding had been consulted by Frank Lumsden after he had come
into his grandfather's estate, and on his behalf had made some
investigations concerning the time the old man had converted his
securities into cash. Of course the grandfather had lost heavily in
doing so, for the stock market was greatly depressed immediately
after the war broke out. But he had probably realized between ten
and fifteen thousand pounds in cash.</p>
<p>Where this money had gone was a mystery. All the ready money
that Frank Lumsden had handled when he came into the property was
the sum of eighty-five pounds, which had been standing to the old
farmer's credit in the bank at Staveley. Most of this amount had
been swallowed up by the funeral and legal expenses connected with
the transfer of the deeds. The young man had naturally been eager
to find some trace of the missing money. Mr. Holding was inclined
to the belief that the old man's mental balance had been disturbed
by the war. He thought that fear of a German invasion had preyed on
his mind to such an extent that he had buried his money, intending
to dig it up after the war was over. Frank had sold some of the
farming machinery in order to provide himself with ready money. In
this way over £200 had been obtained.</p>
<p>Nothing had been paid to the three old servants who had been
left legacies. The old farmer had fractured his skull through
falling downstairs, and had died without recovering consciousness,
and therefore without realizing the emptiness of the reward he had
left to his faithful servants. To Mrs. Thorpe, his housekeeper, he
intended to leave £200, and legacies of half that amount to two of
his old farm-hands, Samuel Hockridge and Thomas Jauncey.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorpe was a widow who had had charge of the domestic
management of the house for thirty-seven years. Hockridge, who was
over seventy years of age, had spent over thirty years with James
Lumsden as shepherd, and Jauncey, another shepherd, had been
twenty-eight years at Cliff Farm.</p>
<p>Detective Gillett had no difficulty in tracing each of these
three old servants and interviewing them. Mrs. Thorpe had gone to
live with a married daughter at Woolwich. Gillett found her a
comparatively cheerful old woman, and, though the loss of her
legacy which her old master had intended to leave her was a sore
memory, she had little complaint to make against him. She was full
of hope that her master's money would ultimately be found and that
she would get her legacy.</p>
<p>Hockridge had gone into the service of a neighbouring
sheep-farmer on the Staveley Downs. It was true that his best days
were over, but he had a profound practical knowledge of sheep, and
as labour was scarce, owing to the war, the farmer had been glad to
get him. When Gillett interviewed him in his new employment he
found that the loss of his promised legacy from his old master had
soured him. To the detective's optimistic view that the missing
money would be found, he replied that it would be too late for
him&mdash;he would be in his grave.</p>
<p>One hundred pounds was more than his year's earnings, and it
represented wealth to him. He dwelt on the ease and comfort he
would have been able to command with so much money. He could give
no clue regarding the hiding-place of the old farmer's fortune. He
was familiar with every foot of ground on the farm, but he knew of
no place that suggested a hiding-place for a large sum of money. If
it had been buried, his old master must have buried it himself, and
therefore the garden was the most likely place. But the garden had
been turned over by zealous searchers under the direction of Master
Frank, and no trace of money had been found there.</p>
<p>It was evident to Detective Gillett that this feeble old man had
not killed Frank Lumsden. Although he regarded the loss of the
legacy as the greatest disappointment that could befall any man, he
felt no active resentment. He accepted it as a staggering blow from
fate which had dealt him many blows during a long life. The
detective's inquiries showed that on the day of the murder, and for
weeks before it, Hockridge performed his ordinary duties on the
farm of his new employer, and therefore could not have been near
Cliff Farm, which was ten miles away from the farm on which he was
now employed.</p>
<p>Thomas Jauncey was an inmate of Staveley Infirmary, suffering
from a severe attack of rheumatism which rendered him unable to get
about except with the aid of two sticks. Gillett's inquiries
established the fact that he was crippled in this way when Frank
Lumsden was murdered. Nevertheless, he went over to Staveley to
interview the old man. He found him sitting in a chair which had
been wheeled into the yard to catch the weak rays of the autumn
sunshine. He was a tall old man, with a large red weather-beaten
face surrounded by a fringe of white whisker, and his two hands,
which were crossed on a stick he held in front of him, were twisted
and gnarled with the rheumatism that had come to him as a result of
half a century's shepherding on the bleak downs. The mention of the
legacy he had not received brought a spark of resentment to his dim
eyes.</p>
<p>"Seems to me I ought to have been paid some'et of what belongs
to me," he said to Detective Gillett, after that officer had
engaged him in conversation about his late master. "Why didn't
Master Frank sell the farm and pay his grandfather's debts
according to what the will said? That's what ought to be done."</p>
<p>"Well, of course, he might have done that," said the detective
soothingly. "But there are different ways of looking at
things."</p>
<p>"There is a right way and a wrong way," said the old shepherd,
in a tone which ruled out the idea of compromise as weakness. "I
ought to have been paid some'et. That's what my son says."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Gillett, with sudden interest. "That is how your son
looks at it, is it? And now I come to consider it, I think he's
right. He's a man with ideas."</p>
<p>"No one can't say as he ain't always been a clever lad," said
the withered parent, with a touch of pride in his offspring.</p>
<p>"I'd like to meet him," said the detective; "Where is he to be
found?"</p>
<p>"He is gard'ner to Mrs. Maynard at Ashlingsea. Mrs. Maynard she
thinks a heap of him."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," said Gillett. "I remember Sergeant Westaway telling
me that you had a son there. I'll look him up and have a talk with
him about your legacy. We may be able to do something&mdash;he and
I."</p>
<p>On returning to Ashlingsea, Detective Gillett made inquiries
concerning the gardener at "Beverley," the house of Mrs. Maynard.
Sergeant Westaway was able to supply him with a great deal of
information, as he had known young Tom Jauncey for over a score of
years. Young Tom was only relatively young, for he was past forty,
but he bore the odd title of Young Tom as a label to distinguish
him from his father, who to the people of Ashlingsea was old
Tom.</p>
<p>The information Gillett obtained was not of a nature which
suggested that young Tom was the sort of man who might commit a
murder. Mrs. Maynard lived on her late husband's estate two miles
south from Ashlingsea. The household consisted at present of
herself, her daughter, a cook, a housemaid and young Tom, who was
gardener, groom and handy man. Young Tom bore a reputation for
being "a steady sort of chap." He liked his glass of ale, and was
usually to be found at <i>The Black-Horned Sheep</i> for an hour or
so of an evening, but no one had ever seen him the worse for
liquor.</p>
<p>Detective Gillett took a stroll over to "Beverley" in order to
interview young Tom. The house, an old stone building, stood in the
midst of its grounds&mdash;well away from the sea&mdash;on a gentle
eminence which commanded an extensive view of the rolling downs for
many miles around, but the old stone building was sheltered from
the fury of Channel gales by a plantation of elm-trees.</p>
<p>The detective found his man digging in the kitchen-garden and
preparing the ground for the spring sowing. Young Tom was a
thickset man of middle age with a large round face that he had
inherited from his father. He was a man of slow thought, slow
actions, and hard to move once he had made up his mind. According
to Gillett's standards his appearance scarcely justified the
parental description of him as a clever lad.</p>
<p>The detective was not an expert in gardening, his life having
been spent in congested areas of London where the luxury of a plot
of ground is unknown, but something in young Tom's method of
digging attracted his attention. It was obvious that young Tom was
not putting much energy into the operation. The fact that his
shirt-sleeves were not rolled up but were buttoned at the wrist
seemed to bear out this opinion. With his heavy boot young Tom
pressed down the spade vigorously, but he brought up only a thin
spadeful of earth each time. Then with his spade in his right hand
he twisted the blade among the earth so as to break it up.</p>
<p>Detective Gillett brought the conversation round from the
weather and vegetable growing to his recent visit to young Tom's
father. He spoke of the legacy and expressed regret that old Tom,
who if he had his rights would be able to pay for proper care and
nourishment, should have had to go to the infirmary. But, according
to Detective Gillett, even adversity had its uses. The fact that
old Tom was practically bedridden when the murder was committed
prevented the idle gossip of the town from trying to connect him
with the tragedy.</p>
<p>The detective had not expected to find in young Tom a fluent
conversationalist, but after a few moments he came to the
conclusion that he was a more than ordinarily hesitating one, even
according to the slow standard of Ashlingsea. Apparently young Tom
did not want to discuss the murder. Detective Gillett kept the
conversation on that subject and soon arrived at the conclusion
that young Tom was uneasy. It came to him suddenly that what was
wrong with the man's method of digging was that to all practical
purpose he was using only one arm. Young Tom was careful not to put
any weight on his left arm.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with your arm?" exclaimed the detective in an
imperative tone. Tom stopped digging and looked at him.</p>
<p>"Nothing," he replied in a surly tone.</p>
<p>"Let me have a look," said the detective, stepping towards
him.</p>
<p>"No, I won't," answered young Tom, stepping back slowly.</p>
<p>Gillett looked him over from head to foot as if measuring him.
His eyes rested on the man's boots, and then turned to an
impression made on the soft earth by one of the boots.</p>
<p>"I want you to come along to the police station with me," he
said suddenly.</p>
<p>"What for?" asked Tom in a tone of defiance.</p>
<p>Gillett looked him over again as if to assure himself that he
had made no mistake in his first measurements.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you when you get there," was the reply.</p>
<p>"I had nothing to do with it," said Tom.</p>
<p>It was plain to Gillett that the man was undergoing a mental
strain.</p>
<p>"With what?" asked the detective.</p>
<p>"With what you want to ask me about."</p>
<p>For a clever lad young Tom seemed to be making a hash of
things.</p>
<p>"I have not said what it is," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"But I know," said Tom.</p>
<p>If that was the extent of young Tom's cleverness it seemed to be
leading him in the direction of the gallows.</p>
<p>"You think it is about this murder?" suggested Gillett.</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Gillett kept his eyes steadily on his
man, determined not to help him out by substituting another
question for the plain one that Tom found it so difficult to
answer.</p>
<p>"I'll come with you to the police station," said Tom at length.
"But you go first and I'll follow you behind."</p>
<p>It was obvious to Detective Gillett that Tom wanted to avoid
giving the village cause for gossip by his being taken to the
police station by a detective. The detective was not disposed to
consider Tom's feelings, but he reflected that his main purpose was
to get Tom to the station, and that since he was not prepared to
arrest Tom at present it was desirable to get him there as quietly
as possible.</p>
<p>"No," he said. "You go on ahead and I'll follow."</p>
<p>Tom accepted this plan and walked up the village street to the
police station with the detective about forty yards behind.
Constable Heather was in charge of the station, and when he saw Tom
he greeted him affably. When Heather was made to realize by Tom's
awkwardness that Detective Gillett was responsible for his visit,
he whistled in a significant manner.</p>
<p>When Gillett entered the building Tom rolled up the sleeve of
his left arm and displayed a bandage round the upper part.</p>
<p>"Do you want to see this?" he asked doggedly.</p>
<p>"I do," replied the detective with keen interest. He was anxious
as to the nature of the wound, but he was too cautious to display a
curiosity which would reveal his ignorance. He assisted at
unwinding the bandage.</p>
<p>"Be careful," said Tom wincing, as the detective's hand touched
his arm. "The bullet is in it."</p>
<p>"Is it?" said Gillett. When the bandage was off he examined the
wound carefully. It was a bullet wound through the fleshy upper
part of the arm, dangerously inflamed and swollen from dirt and
neglect.</p>
<p>"You had better get this attended to," said Gillett. "There is a
risk of blood poisoning and the bullet must be removed. You'll be
more comfortable without that bullet, and I want it."</p>
<p>"I had nothing to do with him," said Tom. He spoke in a loud
excited voice. It was evident that he was feeling the strain of
being under suspicion.</p>
<p>"But you were at Cliff Farm the night Frank Lumsden was
murdered," said Gillett, eyeing him closely as he put the
question.</p>
<p>Young Tom nodded a surly admission, but did not speak.</p>
<p>"What were you doing there? How did you get this?" Detective
Gillett pointed to the wound. "Take my advice and make a clean
breast of it. I'll give you five minutes to make up your mind."
Gillett picked up a pair of handcuffs from the office table as he
spoke, and jingled them together nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Young Tom's ruddy colour faded as he glanced at the handcuffs,
and from them his eyes wandered to Police Constable Heather, as
though seeking his counsel to help him out of the awkward position
in which he found himself. But Police Constable Heather's chubby
face was set in implacable lines, in which young Tom could
recognize no trace of the old acquaintance who for years past had
made one of the friendly evening circle in the tap-room of <i>The
Black-Horned Sheep</i>. Young Tom turned his gaze to the floor and
after remaining in silent cogitation for some moments spoke:</p>
<p>"I was in the garden. It was before the storm came on. I don't
know who killed Frank Lumsden. I didn't see either of them. They
were in the house before I got there. I saw a light in a room
upstairs. Then a gun or something of the kind was fired and I felt
that I was hit. I got up and ran."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that some one fired at you from the house?"</p>
<p>"That's what I mean."</p>
<p>"Whereabouts were you?"</p>
<p>"Just near the cherry-tree at the side of the house."</p>
<p>"Did you see who fired it at you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Didn't anyone call out and ask you what you were doing
there?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He just fired&mdash;whoever it was."</p>
<p>"I heard the gun go off and then I felt a pain in my arm. I
touched it and saw it was bleeding. Then I ran and that is all I
know."</p>
<p>"I want to know a lot more than that," said Gillett sternly.
"Your story won't hold water. What were you doing there in the
first place? Why did you go there?"</p>
<p>"I went there to look for the money. I thought there was no one
at home and I meant to look for it in the garden round about."</p>
<p>"Did you take a spade with you?" asked Gillett.</p>
<p>"What would I want to do that for?" asked Tom.</p>
<p>"Well, you can't dig without a spade," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"There's spades enough in the barn," said Tom. "You meant to dig
for the money?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"In the garden."</p>
<p>"Whereabouts in the garden? Don't you know that the garden has
been turned over several times?"</p>
<p>"I've heard that, but I wanted to dig for myself."</p>
<p>"It would take one man a week to dig over the garden. No one
knows that better than you."</p>
<p>"I was going to try just near the pear-tree. I count that's a
likely place."</p>
<p>"And did you dig there?"</p>
<p>"No. Didn't I tell you there was lights in the house when I got
there?"</p>
<p>"A likely story," sneered the detective. "You went there to dig
in the garden, although you knew it had been turned over
thoroughly. You didn't take a spade with you, and you didn't turn
over as much as a single clod. But you came away with a bullet
wound in the arm from a house in which the murdered body of the
owner was subsequently found."</p>
<p>Dull as young Tom was, he seemed to realize that the detective
had a gift of making things appear as black as they could be.</p>
<p>"I've told you the truth," he said obstinately.</p>
<p>"And I don't believe a word of your story," said Detective
Gillett.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>CREWE spent two days in making investigations at Cliff Farm and
at Ashlingsea. He went over the farm very carefully in search of
any trace of disturbed ground which might indicate where old James
Lumsden had buried the money he had obtained from the sale of his
investments. But he found nothing to support the theory that the
money had been buried in the fields.</p>
<p>There were, of course, innumerable places where a few bags of
money might be hidden, especially along the brook which ran through
the farm, but though Crewe searched along both banks of the brook,
as well as in the open fields, he found no trace of disturbed
ground. The garden, he ascertained, had been thoroughly searched
under the direction of Frank Lumsden.</p>
<p>Crewe realized that searching for the money without the
assistance of the mysterious plan which Marsland had seen on the
staircase was almost hopeless, and he was not affected by his
failure.</p>
<p>His inquiries at Ashlingsea concerned the character and habits
of the grandfather and the murdered man. In the course of his
inquiries about the grandson he went up to London and called on the
former employers of Frank Lumsden, and the firm of Messrs.
Tittering &amp; Hammings, wholesale leather merchants, gave Frank
an excellent character. He had been a sober, industrious, and
conscientious clerk, and they were greatly shocked at the fate that
had befallen him. They could throw no light on the murder, for they
knew of no one who had any enmity against Frank. Inquiries were
also made by Crewe at the headquarters of the London Rifle Brigade,
in which the young man had enlisted. His military record was good,
and threw no light on his tragic fate.</p>
<p>Crewe returned to Staveley to continue his work on the case. Sir
George Granville, in his anxiety to be helpful in solving the
mystery, put forward many suggestions to his guest, but they were
not of a practical kind. On points where Crewe did ask for his
host's assistance, Sir George was unable to respond, in spite of
his eagerness to play a part in the detective's investigations. For
instance. Sir George was not able to give any information about the
old boatman whom Crewe and Marsland had seen at the landing-place,
at the foot of the cliffs near the scene of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Sir George had often seen the man in the scarlet cloak, and knew
that he plied for hire on the front, but he had never been in the
old man's boat, and did not know where he lived or anything about
him beyond the fact that he was called Pedro by the Staveley
boatmen, and was believed to be an Italian.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what, Crewe," said Sir George, a bright idea
occurring to him as the result of reactionary consciousness that he
was not a mine of information in local matters. "You go up and see
Inspector Murchison. He's a rare old gossip. He has been here for a
generation and knows everybody and all about them. And mention my
name&mdash;I'll give you my card. You will find he will do anything
for me. I'd go along with you myself, only I have promised to make
a call with Mildred. But Harry will go with you&mdash;Harry knows
Murchison; I introduced him yesterday on the front."</p>
<p>After lunch, Crewe, accompanied by Marsland, walked up to the
police station at Staveley to call on Inspector Murchison. The
police station was a building of grey stone, standing back in a
large garden. It would have been taken for a comfortable
middle-class residence but for the official notices of undiscovered
crime which were displayed on a black board erected in the centre
flower-bed. A young policeman was sitting writing in a front room
overlooking the garden, which had been turned into a general
office.</p>
<p>Crewe, without disclosing his name or using Sir George's card,
asked him if he could see the inspector in charge. The young
policeman, requesting him to take a seat, said he would inquire if
the inspector was disengaged, and disappeared into an inner office.
He shortly returned to say that Inspector Murchison would see them,
and ushered them into the inner office, where a police officer sat
writing at a large desk.</p>
<p>Inspector Murchison of Staveley was in every way a contrast to
Police-Sergeant Westaway of Ashlingsea. He was a large and portly
man with a good-humoured smile, twinkling blue eyes, and a
protecting official manner which ladies who had occasion to seek
his advice found very soothing. He had been stationed at Staveley
for nearly thirty years, but instead of souring under his
circumscribed existence like Sergeant Westaway, he had expanded
with the town, and become more genial and good-tempered as the
years rolled on.</p>
<p>He was a popular and important figure in Staveley, taking a deep
and all-embracing interest in the welfare of the town and its
inhabitants. He was a leading spirit in every local movement for
Staveley's advancement; he was an authority in its lore,
traditions, vital statistics, and local government; he had even
written a booklet in which the history of Staveley was set forth
and its attractions as a health and pleasure resort were described
in superlative terms. He was regarded by the residents as a capable
mentor and safe guide in all affairs of life, and was the chosen
receptacle of many domestic confidences of a delicate and important
nature. Husbands consulted him about their wives' extravagance;
wives besought him to warn husbands against the folly of prolonged
visits to hotels on the front because there happened to be a new
barmaid from London.</p>
<p>It was striking proof of Inspector Murchison's rectitude that,
although he was the repository of as many domestic histories as a
family physician or lawyer, none of the confidences given him had
ever become common gossip. For all his kindly and talkative ways,
he was as secret and safe as the grave, despite the fact that he
had a wife and five grown-up daughters not less curious than the
rest of their sex. He was an efficient police officer, carefully
safeguarding the public morals and private property entrusted to
his charge, and Staveley shopkeepers, as they responded to his
smiling salutations when he walked abroad, felt that they could
sleep in peace in their beds, safe from murder, arson, or robbery,
while his portly imposing official personality guarded the
town.</p>
<p>Inspector Murchison swung round on his office chair as Crewe and
Marsland were brought in by the young policeman.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he asked courteously.</p>
<p>"This is Mr Crewe," said Marsland. "Mr. Crewe has been making
inquiries about the murder at Cliff Farm."</p>
<p>"Glad to see you both," said Inspector Murchison, extending his
hand. "If I can be of any assistance to Mr. Crewe he has only to
say so. Of course I've heard all about the murder at Cliff Farm. It
was you who discovered the body, Mr Marsland. A terrible affair.
Poor, inoffensive Frank Lumsden! I knew him well, and his
grandfather too&mdash;a queer old stick. Buried his money where no
one can find it. And that is what is at the back of this murder, Mr
Crewe, I have no doubt."</p>
<p>"It certainly looks like it," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion, inspector, with regard to the money?"
asked Marsland. "Do you think that young Lumsden found it and
refused to pay the legacies, or that it has never been found?"</p>
<p>"It has never been found," said Inspector Murchison in a
positive tone. "I'm quite certain of that. Why, it is scarcely more
than a week ago that young Lumsden and his friend Brett came to ask
me if I could throw any light on it. They had a mysterious looking
cryptogram that young Lumsden had found among his grandfather's
papers, and they were certain that it referred to the hidden money.
They showed it to me, but I could not make head or tail of it. I
recommended them to go and see a man named Grange who keeps a
second-hand book shop in Curzon Street, off High Street. He's a
bibliophile, and would be able to put them on the track of a book
about cryptograms, even if he hadn't one in stock himself."</p>
<p>"What was the cryptogram like?" asked Marsland. "Was it like
this?" He took up a pen from the table and attempted to reproduce a
sketch of the mysterious document he had found on the stairs at
Cliff Farm.</p>
<p>"Something like that," said the inspector. "How do you come to
know about it?"</p>
<p>"I found it at the dead man's house before I discovered the
body. I left it there, but it was stolen between the time I left
the house and when I returned with Sergeant Westaway. At any rate
it has not been seen since."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the inspector, "there you have the motive for the
murder."</p>
<p>"You spoke just now of young Lumsden's friend, Brett," said
Crewe. "Who is Brett?"</p>
<p>"He lives in Staveley&mdash;a young fellow with a little private
means. He and Lumsden were close friends&mdash;I have often seen
them together about the town. They served in the same regiment,
were wounded together, taken prisoners together by the Germans,
tortured together, and escaped together."</p>
<p>"Brett?" exclaimed Marsland in a tone which awakened Crewe's
interest. "I know no one named Brett."</p>
<p>"No, of course you wouldn't know him, Mr. Marsland," said the
inspector genially. "You have not been so long in Staveley that you
can expect to know all the residents. It's not a very large place,
but it takes time to know all the people in it."</p>
<p>"I was thinking of something else," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"What sort of man was Brett to look at?" asked Crewe of the
inspector.</p>
<p>"About the same age as Lumsden&mdash;just under thirty, I should
say. A thin, slight, gentlemanly looking fellow. Rather a better
class than poor Lumsden. I often wondered what they had in
common."</p>
<p>Crewe, who was watching the effect of this description on
Marsland, pressed for further particulars.</p>
<p>"Average height?" he asked.</p>
<p>"A little under," replied the inspector. "Dark complexion with a
dark moustache&mdash;what there was of it."</p>
<p>"I think you said he had been wounded and captured by the
Germans?" said Marsland.</p>
<p>"Tortured rather than wounded," replied the inspector. "The
Germans are fiends, not men. Brett and Lumsden were captured while
out in a listening patrol, and because they wouldn't give their
captors any information they were tortured. But these brave lads
refused to give the information the Germans wanted, and ultimately
they succeeded in making their escape during an attack. I've
listened to many of the experiences of our brave lads, but I don't
think I've heard anything worse than the treatment of Brett and
this poor fellow who has been murdered."</p>
<p>"Was it at Armentières this happened?" asked Marsland.</p>
<p>"I think it was," replied the inspector. "Then you've heard the
story, too, Mr. Marsland?"</p>
<p>"No, I was thinking of something else," he answered.</p>
<p>"We must look up Brett," said Crewe. "Just write down his
address, inspector&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>
<p>"He lives at No. 41 Whitethorn Gardens," said the police
officer. "But I don't think you will find him there to-day. His
landlady, Mrs. Penfield, promised to send me word as soon as he got
back. When I heard of this murder I went down to see Brett to find
out when he had last seen Lumsden, and to get a statement from him.
But he had gone up to London or Liverpool the day before the
murder. Mrs. Penfield expects him back early next week, but it is
impossible to be certain about his return. The fact is, Mr Crewe,
that he does some secret service work for the Foreign Office, and
naturally doesn't talk much about his movements. He is an excellent
linguist I'm told, knows French and Russian and German&mdash;speaks
these languages like a native."</p>
<p>"There is no hurry about seeing him," said Crewe. "I'll look him
up when he returns. In the meantime will you write down his address
for me?"</p>
<p>Marsland, who was nearer the inspector, took the paper on which
the police officer wrote Brett's address, and before handing it to
Crewe looked at it carefully.</p>
<p>"And now can you tell me anything about an old boatman who wears
a scarlet coat?" asked Crewe. "A tall old man, with a hooked nose
and white beard?"</p>
<p>"That's old Pedro," replied Inspector Murchison. "He's well
known on the front, although he's not been here very long,
certainly not more than twelve months. But I hope you don't think
Pedro had anything to do with the Cliff Farm murder, Mr. Crewe?
We're rather proud of Pedro on the front, he's an attraction to the
place, and very popular with the ladies."</p>
<p>"Marsland and I saw him in his boat at an old landing-place near
the farm a few days ago," replied Crewe. "He's a man not easily
forgotten&mdash;once seen. I'd like to find out what took him over
in the direction of Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>"He's often over there," said the inspector. "That is his
favourite trip for his patrons&mdash;across the bay and over to the
cliff landing, as we call it. That is the landing at the foot of
the cliffs near Cliff Farm&mdash;I daresay you noticed it, Mr.
Crewe?"</p>
<p>"Yes. They told me at Ashlingsea that the landing-place and
boat-house belong to Cliff Farm&mdash;that they were put up by old
James Lumsden."</p>
<p>"That is right," said the inspector. "The old man used to do a
bit of fishing&mdash;that is ten or fifteen years ago when he was
an active man, though getting on a bit&mdash;a strange thing to
combine farming and fishing, wasn't it? But he was a queer sort in
many ways, was James Lumsden."</p>
<p>"And where is this man with the scarlet cloak to be found when
he is not on the front?" asked Crewe. "I'd like to have a little
talk with him."</p>
<p>"You'll find that rather difficult," said the inspector with a
laugh. "Old Pedro is deaf and dumb."</p>
<p>"Has he any friends here, or does he live alone?"</p>
<p>"He came here with his daughter and her husband and he lives
with them. His daughter is a dwarf&mdash;a hunchback&mdash;and is
supposed to be a bit of a clairvoyant or something of that kind.
The husband is English, but not a very robust type of Englishman.
They have a shop in Curzon Street off High Street&mdash;second-hand
books."</p>
<p>"What is his name?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Grange."</p>
<p>"And it was to this man you recommended young Lumsden to go for
a book on cryptograms?"</p>
<p>"Yes; the same man," said the inspector. "I can tell you a queer
thing about his wife. I've said she is a bit of a clairvoyant.
Well, you know there is not much love lost between the police and
clairvoyants; most of them are shallow frauds who play on the
ignorant gullible public. But Mrs. Grange is different: she isn't
in the business professionally. And, being a broad-minded man, I am
ready to admit that there may be something in clairvoyance and
spiritualism, in spite of the fact that they are usually associated
with fraud. Well, one of my men, Constable Bell, lost a pendant
from his watch-chain. It was not very valuable, but it had a
sentimental value. He had no idea where he lost it, but he happened
to mention it to Mrs. Grange&mdash;this dwarf woman&mdash;and she
told him she might be able to help him in finding it.</p>
<p>"She took him into a sitting-room above the shop, and after
getting his watch from him held it in her hands for a few moments.
She told him to keep perfectly still, and concentrate his mind on
the article he had lost. She closed her eyes and went into a sort
of trance. Then in a strange far-away voice she said, 'I see
water&mdash;pools of water among the rocks. I see a man and a woman
walking near the rocks, arm in arm. I see the man take the woman in
his arms to kiss her, and the pendant, caught by a button of her
blouse, drops into the pool at their feet.' That was true about the
kissing. Bell when off duty visited Horseley three miles from here,
with his sweetheart, and he thought the dwarf must have seen them
and was having a joke at his expense. However, he cycled over to
Horseley when the tide was out next day, and much to his surprise
he found the pendant in the water&mdash;just as the dwarf had told
him. How do you account for a thing like that, Mr. Crewe?"</p>
<p>"It is very difficult to account for," said Crewe. "Does this
dwarf hold spiritualistic séances?"</p>
<p>"Not that I am aware of," replied the inspector. "If she does,
it is in a private capacity, and not as a business."</p>
<p>"Her acquaintance is worth cultivating. We will go and see her,
Marsland."</p>
<p>Crewe cordially thanked Inspector Murchison for the information
he had supplied, and set out with Marsland for Mr. Grange's shop in
Curzon Street.</p>
<p>"A good man, Murchison; he has given us a lot of information,"
he said to his companion as they drove along.</p>
<p>"It seemed very scrappy and incomplete to me," was Marsland's
reply.</p>
<p>"Gossipy is the right word&mdash;not scrappy. And there is
nothing more valuable than gossipy information; it enables you to
fill in so many blanks in your theory&mdash;if you have one."</p>
<p>"You have formed your theory of how this tragedy occurred?" said
Marsland interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Part of one," replied Crewe.</p>
<p>Marsland accepted this reply as an intimation that the detective
was not prepared to disclose his theory at that stage.</p>
<p>"That story about the pendant was remarkable," he said. "Do you
believe it?"</p>
<p>"It is not outside the range of possibility," replied Crewe.
"Some remarkable results have been achieved by psychists who
possess what they call mediumistic powers."</p>
<p>"Do you really think it possible that, by surrendering herself
to some occult influence, this woman was able to reproduce for
herself the scene between Constable Bell and his sweetheart, and
see the pendant drop?"</p>
<p>"That is the way in which psychists would explain it, but I
think it can be accounted for in a much less improbable way. I
know, from my own investigations into spiritualism and its claims,
that some mediums are capable, under favourable conditions, of
reading a little of another person's thoughts, provided the other
person is sympathetic and tries to help. But even in this limited
field failure is more frequent than success. But let us suppose
that Constable Bell was an extremely sympathetic subject on this
occasion. How was this woman, after getting Bell to concentrate his
thoughts on the events of the day when he lost the pendant, able to
discover it by reading Bell's thoughts?"</p>
<p>"Bell's thoughts would not be of much help to her, as he did not
remember when or how he lost the pendant," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"The point I am aiming at is that sub-consciously Bell may have
been aware of the conditions under which he lost the pendant, and
yet not consciously aware of them. The human brain does not work as
a uniform piece of machinery; it works in sections or in
compartments. Suppose part of Bell's brain became aware that the
pendant had become detached and tried to communicate the fact to
that part of Bell's brain where he keeps toll of his personal
belongings. That would be the normal procedure, and under normal
conditions a connection between these two compartments of the brain
would be established, and Bell would stoop down and pick up the
pendant. But on this occasion Bell was intoxicating himself with
kisses and had put his brain into an excitable state. Possibly that
part which keeps toll of his personal possessions was particularly
excited at the prospect of adding the lady to the list of Bell's
belongings.</p>
<p>"Let us assume that it was too excited to hear the small warning
voice which was crying out about the lost pendant. And when Bell's
brain had become normal the small voice had become too weak to be
heard. It was never able subsequently to establish a connection
between that part of the brain to which it belonged and that part
where Bell keeps toll of his property&mdash;perhaps it never tried
again, being under the impression that its first attempts had
succeeded. And so when Bell was asked by Mrs. Grange to concentrate
his thoughts on the lost pendant he was able to reproduce the state
in which his brain was at the time, and the medium was able to hear
the warning in Bell's brain which Bell himself had never
consciously heard."</p>
<p>Marsland looked hard at Crewe to see whether he was speaking
jestingly or seriously, for he had been shrewd enough to discover
that the detective had a habit at times of putting forth fanciful
theories the more effectually to conceal his real thoughts. It was
when Crewe talked most that he revealed least, Marsland thought.
But as Crewe's face, as usual, did not reveal any clue to his mind,
the young man murmured something about the explanation of the
pendant being interesting, but unscientific.</p>
<p>"What science cannot explain, it derides," was Crewe's
reply.</p>
<p>"Do you sympathize with the complaints of the spiritualists,
that scientists adopt an attitude of negation and derision towards
spiritualism, instead of an attitude of investigation?" continued
Marsland inquiringly.</p>
<p>"I think there is some truth in that complaint, though as far as
I am concerned I have not found much truth in spiritualism.
However, Mrs. Grange may be able to convince me that she uses her
powers to enlighten, and not to deceive. I am most anxious to see
her."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>STAVELY only differed from a hundred other English seaside
resorts by having a sea front which was quite flat, the cliffs
which skirted the coastline from Ashlingsea falling away and
terminating in sand dunes about half a mile to the south of the
town. At that point the cliff road, after following the coastline
for nearly twelve miles, swept inland round the sand dunes, which
had encroached on the downs more than half a mile from the sea, but
turned back again near the southern outskirts of the town in a bold
picturesque curve to the sea front.</p>
<p>From the sea front the town rambled back with characteristically
English irregularity of architecture to the downs. There was the
usual seaside mixture of old and new houses, the newest flaunting
their red-tiled ugliness from the most beautiful slopes of the
distant hills.</p>
<p>Crewe and Marsland drove slowly along to High Street by way of
the front after leaving the police station. A long row of
boarding-houses and hotels faced the sea; and there were pleasure
boats, bathing-machines, a pier and a bandstand. The season was
practically over, but a number of visitors still remained, making
the most of the late October sunshine, decorously promenading for
air and exercise. It was a typically English scene, except that the
band was playing German music and the Kursaal still flaunted its
German name.</p>
<p>The front was bisected about midway by the main business
thoroughfare of the town, and there was a sharp distinction between
the two halves of the promenade which it divided. The upper half
was the resort of fashion and the mode: the hotels were bigger and
more expensive; the boarding-houses were designated private hotels.
All the amusements were situated in this part of the front: the
pleasure boats, the pier, the band, the goat carts, and the Bath
chairs. The lower part of the front was practically deserted, its
hotels and boarding-houses looked empty and neglected, and its
whole aspect was that of a poor relation out of place in
fashionable surroundings.</p>
<p>Although Marsland did not know much about Staveley he was able
to guide Crewe to Curzon Street, and once in Curzon Street they had
not much difficulty in finding the shop kept by Mr. Grange. It was
a curious little white house standing back a few feet from the
footpath, and trays of second-hand books were arranged on tables
outside.</p>
<p>Crewe, after getting out of his car, began an inspection of the
books on the trays outside the shop, and while engaged in this way
he saw a young lady being shown out of the shop. She was a well
dressed graceful girl, not much more than twenty. Behind her was
the shopkeeper, a tall thin man past middle age, with a weak
irresolute face disfigured by some cutaneous disorder, small
ferrety grey eyes, and a straggling beard. As he opened the door to
let the young lady out Crewe's quick ears heard him remark:</p>
<p>"Well, as I said, we didn't go because we saw the storm coming
up. I'm very glad now we didn't, as things turned out. It's a
dreadful affair&mdash;dreadful."</p>
<p>To Crewe's surprise Marsland stepped forward when he saw the
young lady, lifted his hat and put out his hand. Crewe thought she
hesitated a little before responding.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you, Miss Maynard," Marsland declared. "You
are the very person I wanted to see. But this is quite an
unexpected meeting."</p>
<p>"It is very kind of you," said the young lady with a smile.</p>
<p>To Crewe it was evident that she was more embarrassed than
pleased at the meeting.</p>
<p>Marsland walked along the street a few paces with Miss Maynard
and then came back to Crewe.</p>
<p>"Please excuse me for half an hour or so, Crewe. I have some
things to talk over with this lady."</p>
<p>He rushed back to Miss Maynard's side without waiting for an
answer. Crewe watched them for a moment and then he became aware
that the shopkeeper standing at his doorway was watching them with
a gaze of perplexity.</p>
<p>"Mr. Grange, I believe?" said Crewe.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper produced a pair of spectacles from his pocket and
put them on before replying. With the spectacles on his small grey
eyes he peered at Crewe, and said:</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, sir?"</p>
<p>Crewe saw that the man was ill at ease, and he endeavoured to
bring him back to his normal state.</p>
<p>"Have you a copy of a book called <i>Notitiae Monastica</i>?"
asked the detective. "It's a work on the early British religious
establishments," he explained. "No, sir: I don't think I've ever
heard of the book. But perhaps I could get you one if you
particularly want it."</p>
<p>"You might try and let me know. I'll leave you my address.
Inspector Murchison told me that if anyone could help me you
could."</p>
<p>"Inspector Murchison?" echoed Mr. Grange peering again at
Crewe.</p>
<p>"He was most enthusiastic about you," continued Crewe. "He said
that if ever he wanted to know anything about rare books he would
come to you. You have a good friend in the inspector, Mr.
Grange."</p>
<p>"I did not know&mdash;yes I think so&mdash;it was very good of
him&mdash;very good indeed." Mr. Grange was both relieved and
pleased at being commended by the head of the local police, for he
smiled at Crewe, blinked his eyes, and rubbed his hands
together.</p>
<p>"And about Mrs. Grange he was no less enthusiastic," continued
Crewe. "He told me about her extraordinary psychic powers and the
recovery of Constable Bell's watch-chain pendant. A most remarkable
case. I take a great interest in occultism, Mr. Grange, and in all
forms of psychic power&mdash;I have done so for years. Perhaps your
wife would grant me the favour of an interview? I should so much
like to meet her and talk to her."</p>
<p>"Certainly," exclaimed Mr. Grange, who was now delighted with
his visitor. "I am sure she would like to meet a gentleman like
yourself who is interested in&mdash;er&mdash;occultism. Excuse me
while I run upstairs to her."</p>
<p>He left the shop by a side-door opening on the passage leading
to the private apartments above the shop. A few minutes later he
came back with an invitation to Crewe to follow him upstairs to the
sitting-room. Crewe followed him into a room which overlooked the
street. In an arm-chair beside one of the two windows sat Mrs.
Grange. She rose to meet Crewe. She was about four feet in height
but her deformed figure seemed to make her look smaller. Her skin
was dark and coarse and her teeth were large. On her upper lip
there was a slight growth of hair and her eyebrows were very thick
and shaggy. She had deep black eyes, and after her bow to Crewe she
gazed at him in a fixed penetrating way&mdash;the look of an animal
on the watch.</p>
<p>Crewe took particular note of the way in which her black hair
was dressed. He closed the door behind him and took a seat near it
when the dwarf sat down in her arm-chair. Mr. Grange stood a few
feet from his wife and again rubbed his hands together to express
his satisfaction.</p>
<p>"It is very good of you to see me," said Crewe to the dwarf. "I
was so much struck with the account Inspector Murchison gave me of
your psychic powers that it occurred to me that you might be able
to assist me in a somewhat similar way to that in which you
assisted Constable Bell."</p>
<p>"I shall be pleased to try," said the dwarf slowly. "But success
is not always possible." She spoke in a thin high pitched
voice.</p>
<p>"So I understood," said Crewe. "But my case is, I think, less
difficult than that of Constable Bell. I have not lost anything. On
the contrary I have found something, which I want to restore to the
owner. If I gave you this thing I have found to hold, you could
describe the owner to me, could you not?"</p>
<p>"It is possible," said the dwarf.</p>
<p>Crewe produced from one of the pockets of his motor coat a brown
paper parcel. He unwrapped the paper, keeping covert observation on
the Granges as he did so, and displayed the old felt hat which he
had found while making his way down the path from the top of the
cliff.</p>
<p>"I am anxious to restore this to its owner," he said, as he held
out the hat to the dwarf.</p>
<p>He intercepted the glance of angry reproach which she gave her
husband. The latter had stopped rubbing his hands and now stood
gazing alternately at the hat and at Crewe, with visible
trepidation on his features. The dwarf gave the hat a quick glance,
and then resolutely turned to Crewe.</p>
<p>"It is of no value," she said, in her high pitched voice,
meeting his glance intently.</p>
<p>"Of very little value&mdash;from the monetary point of view,"
said Crewe. "But there are other reasons why the owner would like
to have it restored to him. Do you think you could help me to find
him?"</p>
<p>"No," she replied decisively. "I could not help you."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Because it does not interest me. I must feel an
interest&mdash;I must feel in sympathy with the object on which I
am asked to exert my powers. Without such sympathy I can do
nothing, for when I close my eyes to see the vision I become as
blind as those born without sight."</p>
<p>"And you have no interest in helping me to restore this hat to
its owner?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"None," she replied.</p>
<p>"And you?" said Crewe, turning to her husband.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I know nothing about it," he stammered. "It is not
mine."</p>
<p>"This hat was lost over the cliffs near Ashlingsea. It was lost
the night that the murdered body of the owner of the Cliff Farm was
found. The owner was so anxious to secure possession of it that the
morning after the murder he sent a boatman over to the scene to
look for it. Is not that correct?" asked Crewe looking searchingly
at Mr. Grange.</p>
<p>"I know nothing about it," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would like to try it on," said Crewe, picking up
the hat and holding it out to the woman's husband.</p>
<p>"Me?" exclaimed the man, recoiling as he spoke. "Why should I?
It is not mine."</p>
<p>"Come," said Crewe, "I will exchange the hat for a candid
statement of what happened at Cliff Farm on that fateful
night."</p>
<p>"It is not his," declared the dwarf. "We know nothing about
Cliff Farm&mdash;we have never been there."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>"WILL you come to some place where we can have a talk?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Where shall we go?"</p>
<p>Her eyes met his frankly, as she replied, and Marsland as he
looked at her was impressed with her beauty and the self-possession
of her manner. She was young, younger than he had thought on the
night of the storm&mdash;not more than twenty-two or twenty-three
at the most&mdash;and as she stood there, with the bright autumn
sunshine revealing the fresh beauty of her face and the slim grace
of her figure, she made a striking picture of dainty English
girlhood, to whom the sordid and tragic sides of life ought to be a
sealed book. But Marsland's mind, as he glanced at her, travelled
back to his first meeting with her in the lonely farm-house where
they had found the body of the murdered man on the night of the
storm.</p>
<p>He led her to one of the numerous tea-rooms on the front,
choosing one which was nearly empty, his object being to have a
quiet talk with her. Since the eventful night on which he had
walked home with her after they had discovered the dead body of the
owner of Cliff Farm, several important points had arisen on which
he desired to enlighten her, and others on which he desired to be
enlightened by her.</p>
<p>"I thought of writing to you," he said after he had found seats
for his companion and himself in a quiet corner of the large
tea-room and had given an order to the waitress. "But I came to the
conclusion that it was unwise&mdash;that you might not like
it."</p>
<p>He found it difficult to strike a satisfactory balance in his
attitude to her. On the one hand, it was impossible to be distant
and formal in view of the fact that they were united in keeping
from the police the secret of her presence at Cliff Farm on the
night of the murder; on the other hand, he did not wish to adopt a
tone of friendly familiarity based on his knowledge that she had
something to hide. When he studied her from the young man's point
of view as merely an attractive member of the opposite sex he felt
that she was a charming girl whose affection any one might be proud
to win, but his security against her charms was the feeling of
distrust that any one so good-looking should have anything to hide.
He had no sentimental illusion that she would confide her secret to
him.</p>
<p>She waited for him to continue the conversation, and pretended
to be engaged in glancing round the room, but from time to time she
gave him a quick glance from beneath her long lashes.</p>
<p>"What I wanted to tell you most of all is that, when I went back
to Cliff Farm the next day, the detective from Scotland Yard found
a comb on the floor of the sitting-room downstairs where we sat
after you let me in."</p>
<p>"A comb!" she cried. "What sort of a comb?"</p>
<p>"A tortoise-shell comb about three inches long, with a gold
mounting."</p>
<p>"That is strange," she said. "It was found on the floor?"</p>
<p>"Close to the chair where you stood."</p>
<p>"Do they know whom it belongs to?"</p>
<p>"No, fortunately. But they are very anxious to find out.
Naturally they think it points to the conclusion that there is a
woman in the case."</p>
<p>"Of course they would think that," she said.</p>
<p>"Do you think any one in Ashlingsea could identify it as yours?"
he asked. "Have you had it any length of time?"</p>
<p>"It was not mine," she declared. "I did not lose a comb."</p>
<p>"Not yours?" he exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<p>"I am trying to think to whom it belonged," she said
meditatively. "As far as I know, lady visitors at Cliff Farm were
few. And yet it could not be Mrs. Bond&mdash;the woman who went
there to tidy up the place once a week&mdash;you say it was gold
mounted?"</p>
<p>"Rather an expensive looking comb, I thought," said the young
man.</p>
<p>"Yes; it looks as if there was a woman in the case."</p>
<p>The arrival of the waitress with the tea-things brought about a
lengthy pause in the conversation.</p>
<p>To Marsland it looked as if there must be two women in the case
if the comb did not belong to Miss Maynard. But he was not
altogether satisfied with her statement that it was not hers. It is
difficult for a young man of impressionable age to regard a
good-looking girl as untruthful, but Marsland recalled other things
which indicated that she was not averse to seeking refuge in false
statements. He remembered her greeting when he had knocked at the
farm-house on the night of the storm. "Where have you been?" was
the question she put to him, and then she had added, "I have been
wondering what could have happened to you."</p>
<p>They were not questions which might reasonably be directed to a
chance visitor on such a night, and he remembered that there had
been a note of impatience in her voice. This impatience harmonized
with the start of surprise which she gave when he spoke to her.
Obviously she had been expecting some one and had mistaken his
knock for the arrival of the man for whom she had been waiting. And
yet her subsequent story to Marsland in explanation of her presence
at the farm was that she had been overtaken by the storm and had
sought shelter there. She had made no reference to the man whom she
had expected to see when she opened the door in response to
Marsland's knock. When directly questioned on the matter she had
declared that it was Frank Lumsden she had expected to see.</p>
<p>"Whom do the police suspect?" she asked, after the waitress had
departed.</p>
<p>"I do not think they suspect any one in particular just yet," he
replied.</p>
<p>"Have they no clue of any kind?"</p>
<p>"They have several clues of a kind. They have discovered some
footprints outside the window of the room in which we sat. The
window itself has been forced. And that reminds me of something
else I wanted to tell you. The police have naturally questioned me
in order to obtain any light I can throw on the mystery. One of the
first things they asked me was how I got into the house. I told
them that the door was open, and that as no one came when I knocked
I walked in and sat down. I think that was what you told me you
did."</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied. "The door was open."</p>
<p>"You see, I forgot to fortify myself with a ready made story
which would fit all these questions. The theory of the police at
present is that the murderer was in the house all the time we were
there."</p>
<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. It was obvious that she was deeply
interested in that theory. "Because of the crash we heard?"</p>
<p>"Partly because of that, and partly because that strange looking
document we found on the stairs has disappeared. It was gone when I
went back to the house with the police sergeant. Their theory is
that the murderer was in the house when I arrived&mdash;that is,
when you arrived&mdash;but of course they didn't know about your
being there. As they reconstruct the tragedy, the murderer was
making his way downstairs with the plan in his hand just as
I&mdash;meaning you&mdash;arrived at the door. In his alarm he
dropped the plan and retreated upstairs. The crash we heard was
made by him knocking down a picture that hung on the wall near the
top of the staircase&mdash;that is on the second floor. After we
left the house he came down, found the plan in the sitting-room and
made off with it."</p>
<p>"To think of his being in the house all the time I was there
alone!" she said. "It makes me shudder even now."</p>
<p>"The police are under the impression that they will not have
much difficulty in getting hold of him, but on the other hand Mr.
Crewe thinks there are some puzzling mysterious features which the
police have overlooked."</p>
<p>"Mr. Crewe!" she exclaimed. "Do you mean the famous London
detective?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How does he come into it?"</p>
<p>"My uncle, Sir George Granville, is responsible for that.
Perhaps you know him?"</p>
<p>"I know him by sight," she said.</p>
<p>"I have been staying with him," continued the young man. "And
when I rang him up from the police station at Ashlingsea, after
leaving you, he was greatly excited about my discovery. He knows
Crewe very well&mdash;they used to be interested in chess, and that
brought them together. Crewe had come down to Staveley for the
week-end as my uncle's guest, and they were sitting up for me when
I telephoned from Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>"Was that Mr. Crewe who was with you this morning?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Rather a fine looking man, don't you think?"</p>
<p>She had other things to think of than the appeal of Mr. Crewe's
appearance to her feminine judgment.</p>
<p>"What did he want at Grange's shop?" she asked.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that he would like to ask that question
concerning her own visit there. What he said was:</p>
<p>"He wanted to make some inquiries there."</p>
<p>"Inquiries?" She looked at him steadily, but as he did not offer
further information she had to put her anxiety into words. "About
this comb?"</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I am not fully in his confidence," said
Marsland with a constrained smile. "Crewe is a man who keeps his
own counsel. He has to, in his line of business." She was not quite
sure that a rebuke was contained in this reply, but she gave
herself the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Crewe know that I was at Cliff Farm that night?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"No. I thought I made my promise on that point quite
definite."</p>
<p>"You did," was her candid reply to his undoubted rebuke. "But I
will release you from that promise if you think you ought to tell
him."</p>
<p>"I am under no obligation to tell him anything more than I have
told the police."</p>
<p>"I thought that perhaps the fact that your uncle has brought Mr.
Crewe into the case might make a difference."</p>
<p>As he made no reply to that suggestion she branched off to
something else that was in her mind:</p>
<p>"Do you think Mr. Crewe is as clever as people say he is?"</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that he is a very remarkable man. I have
already had proof of his wonderfully quick observation."</p>
<p>"Then I suppose there is no doubt that he will find out who
killed Frank Lumsden?"</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily as he replied:</p>
<p>"His appearance in the case lessens the guilty person's chance
of escape. But Mr. Crewe does not claim to solve every mystery
which is presented to him."</p>
<p>"Do you think he will solve this one?" she asked.</p>
<p>He knew that she had a secret reason for hoping that some aspect
of it would prove insoluble, but this knowledge did not influence
his reply. "It may baffle him," he replied meditatively. "But I
have been so deeply impressed with the keenness of his observations
and his methods of deduction that I feel sure he will get very near
to the truth."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>CREWE walked to the street known as Whitethorn Gardens, which he
learned was situated in the older portion of the town, off the less
fashionable end of the front. It was a narrow street, steep of
ascent, full of old stone houses of deserted appearance, which
faced cobbled footways from behind prim grass-plots. It looked like
a place which had seen better days and was proud in its poverty,
for very few "Apartments" cards were displayed in the old-fashioned
bay windows. No. 41 was half-way up the street on the right-hand
side, and was distinguished from its fellows by a magnolia in the
centre of the grass-plot, and two parallel close-clipped ivy
screens which had been trained to grow in panel fashion on both
sides of the front door.</p>
<p>Crewe walked up the gravel path and rang the bell. After a
considerable pause, he rang again. His second ring brought a
grim-faced servant to the door, who, when he asked if her mistress
was in, opened the door and invited him to enter. She took him into
a small sitting-room, and vanished with a gruff intimation that she
would tell Mrs. Penfield.</p>
<p>Five minutes elapsed before a woman entered the room noiselessly
and stood before him. She was a woman of attractive appearance,
about thirty, with clear grey eyes and well kept brown hair, and
her graceful and ladylike demeanour suggested that she was of
superior class to the type of womanhood usually associated with
seaside apartment houses.</p>
<p>"I understand that you are looking for apartments?" she said in
a pleasant voice.</p>
<p>"No," said Crewe. "I came to see Mr. Brett."</p>
<p>"He is not in," was the reply. Her smile had gone and her voice
had lost its ingratiating tone. She looked at Crewe steadily.</p>
<p>"When do you expect him in?"</p>
<p>"He is away."</p>
<p>"When do you expect him back?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say definitely when he will be back."</p>
<p>"Do you expect him in the course of the next few days?"</p>
<p>"He may come any time." Her suspicions were fully aroused, and
with the object of dismissing him and also extracting some
information from him she said, "And who shall I tell him
called?"</p>
<p>Crewe handed her a card and watched her as she read the
name.</p>
<p>"Mr. Crewe!" she exclaimed with a note of surprise and alarm in
her voice. "Not Mr. Crewe of&mdash;of London?"</p>
<p>"I live in London," he replied.</p>
<p>"Not Mr. Crewe, the&mdash;famous detective?"</p>
<p>"That is my occupation," was the modest rejoinder.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am pleased to see you," was her unexpected exclamation.
She smiled as she looked him over. He was much younger and much
better-looking than the Mr. Crewe of her imagination, and these
things lessened her fear of him. "Inspector Murchison came down to
see Mr. Brett on Saturday last, but he had gone away two days
before," she said. "I promised the inspector I would send him word
when Mr. Brett returned." She seemed to have changed completely
since learning Crewe's name, and to be anxious to supply
information.</p>
<p>"I have seen Inspector Murchison," he said.</p>
<p>"If I knew Mr. Brett's present address I would telegraph to
him," she continued. "I don't think he can have heard of the murder
of poor Mr. Lumsden, or he would have come back at once."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt of that," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"As of course you know, from the inspector, Mr. Brett is engaged
from time to time on very important business of a confidential
nature for the Government. He has often been away for three weeks
at a time without sending me as much as a postcard."</p>
<p>"On what day did he go away?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"On Thursday last&mdash;Thursday morning. It was on Friday night
that Mr. Lumsden was killed, was it not?"</p>
<p>"It was on Friday night that his body was discovered," said
Crewe.</p>
<p>"A dreadful crime," she continued.</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Brett leave by train?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;that is, as far as I know. Oh, of course he must have
gone by train. He only took a light suitcase with him, so I do not
expect he will be away very long."</p>
<p>There was a pause during which she did some earnest
thinking.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would like to look at Mr. Brett's rooms?"</p>
<p>"If it is not too much trouble." He was suspicious of the change
in her attitude after learning his name.</p>
<p>She led the way upstairs and opened a door on the first
landing.</p>
<p>"This is his sitting-room," she said.</p>
<p>It was a large, comfortably furnished room, with a window
looking onto the front garden. Crewe's keen eye took in the details
of the interior. The manner in which the room had been left
suggested that its owner intended to return. Several pipes and a
box of cigars, nearly full, stood on a table near the fireplace.
Beside them was a folded newspaper, and on top of it was a
novel.</p>
<p>An arm-chair was drawn up close to the fire-place, and beside it
was a pair of slippers. Near the window was another table, on which
there was an open writing-desk containing notepaper, envelopes and
pens. The room looked neat and tidy, as if for an occupant of
regular habits who liked his comfort to be studied. It was this
impression which gave Crewe the clue to the landlady's invitation
to inspect the apartments. If Brett had anything to hide he could
depend on the loyal support of Mrs. Penfield.</p>
<p>Among the photographs which decorated the room, the one that
claimed Crewe's attention was that which occupied the place of
honour in the centre of the mantelpiece. It was enclosed in a
silver frame. He took it in his hands to examine it closely, and
glancing at Mrs. Penfield as he lifted it down he saw her give a
slight disdainful toss of her head.</p>
<p>"A very pretty girl," said Crewe, looking critically at the
photograph.</p>
<p>"It is very flattering," was the cold comment of his companion.
"But even allowing for that"&mdash;he left the sentence unfinished,
as if unable to find words for his admiration of the subject of the
photograph. His real interest in the photograph was that he had
recently seen the sitter, and was astonished to find that she had
some connection with Brett. "Do you know her?"</p>
<p>"I have seen her. She came here several times to see Mr. Brett.
She came to-day about an hour ago."</p>
<p>"She didn't know that Mr. Brett had gone away?"</p>
<p>It occurred to Mrs. Penfield that she had made a mistake in
volunteering this information&mdash;a mistake due to the feminine
desire to convey the impression that the subject of the photograph
was in the habit of running after Mr. Brett.</p>
<p>"She wanted to know when he would be back," she answered
hastily.</p>
<p>"What is her name?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Miss Maynard."</p>
<p>"Is she Mr. Brett's fiancée?"</p>
<p>"I have heard some people say that they are engaged, but I never
heard Mr. Brett say so. At any rate, she doesn't wear an engagement
ring."</p>
<p>"That seems to settle it," said Crewe, who knew the value of
sympathy in a jealous nature. "And this photograph, I presume, is
one of Mr. Brett," he added, pointing to a photograph of a young
man which stood at the other end of the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penfield nodded without speaking.</p>
<p>"Would you like to look at Mr. Brett's bedroom?" she asked after
a pause.</p>
<p>"I may as well, now that I am here."</p>
<p>She led the way to the door of another room and Crewe entered
it. Here, again, there were many indications that the occupant of
the room did not expect to be absent for any great length of time.
It was smaller than the sitting-room, but it looked very cheerful
and cosy. Behind the door a dressing-gown was hanging.</p>
<p>Crewe's rapid inspection of the room showed him that there was
no shaving tackle visible, and that there were no hair-brushes or
clothes-brushes on the dressing-table. It was to be assumed from
these facts that Mr. Brett had taken his brushes and shaving things
with him. As far as appearances went, his departure had not been
hurried.</p>
<p>"A very nice set of rooms," said Crewe. "I think you said you
promised to let Inspector Murchison know when Mr. Brett returns. I
shall get the inspector to ring me up when he hears from you. There
are one or two questions I should like to ask Mr. Brett. When he
comes back, will you please tell him I called?"</p>
<p>Crewe's next act was to get his car and visit the garage kept by
Gosford in High Street. Inside the building he saw the proprietor
standing by a large grey motor-car in the centre of the garage,
watching a workman in blue overalls who was doing something to one
of the wheels.</p>
<p>"Not much the worse," said Crewe, nodding his head in the
direction of the grey car, and addressing himself to the proprietor
of the garage.</p>
<p>Gosford, a short stout man, looked hard at him as he approached.
He was clean-shaven, and his puffed-out cheeks made his large face
look like a ball.</p>
<p>Gosford again looked at Crewe out of his little black eyes, but
said nothing. His business caution acted as a curb on his natural
geniality, for he had learnt by experience of the folly of giving
information to strangers until he knew what business brought them
into the garage.</p>
<p>"Not much the worse for its accident," said Crewe. "You were not
long in getting it into repair."</p>
<p>The proprietor's glance wandered backwards and forwards from the
car to his visitor.</p>
<p>"As good as ever," he said. "Do you want to buy it?"</p>
<p>"No," said Crewe. "I have one already." He nodded in the
direction of his car outside.</p>
<p>"She's a beauty," said Gosford. "But those Bodesly touring cars
run into a lot of money. You paid a big price for her, I'll be
bound."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. You motor-car people are never
reasonable&mdash;manufacturers, garage proprietors, repairers, you
are all alike."</p>
<p>"No, no, sir, we are very reasonable here. That is what I pride
myself on."</p>
<p>"In that case I'll know where to bring my repairs. But to-day
all I want is some petrol. That is what I came for, but when I saw
this car I thought I'd like to see what sort of job you had made of
it. The last time I saw it was when it was lying in the ditch about
six miles from here on the road to Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>"Oh, you saw her there?" said Mr. Gosford genially. "But there
wasn't much the matter with her, beyond a bent axle."</p>
<p>"I hope that is what you told the gentleman who left it
there&mdash;Mr.&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Brett," said Mr. Gosford, coming to the relief of his
visitor's obvious effort to recall a name.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; Mr. Brett," said Crewe. "Was it Thursday or Friday
that I met him on the Ashlingsea road in this car?"</p>
<p>"Friday, sir. This car wasn't out on Thursday. Friday was the
night of the big storm. She was out in it all night. I didn't know
where she was until Mr. Brett rang me up on Saturday morning."</p>
<p>"So he was in Staveley on Saturday morning?"</p>
<p>"No, no, sir. He said he was speaking from Lewes. He must have
caught an early train out from Staveley or Ashlingsea before we
were open. That is why he didn't ring up before."</p>
<p>Crewe, on leaving the garage, drove through the western
outskirts of the town, and kept on till he passed the sand dunes,
and the cliff road stretched to Ashlingsea like a strip of white
ribbon between the green downs and grey sea. About a mile past the
sand dunes he saw a small stone cottage with a thatched roof,
standing back on the downs about fifty yards from the road.</p>
<p>Crewe stopped his car, and walked up the slope to the little
cottage. The gate was open, and he walked through the tiny garden,
which was crowded with sweet-scented wallflowers and late roses,
and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>His knock brought a woman to the door&mdash;an infirm and bent
old woman, with scattered grey locks falling over her withered
face. She peered up at him with rheumy eyes.</p>
<p>Crewe looked at the old woman in some doubt whether she was not
past answering any questions. Before he could put the point to the
proof she solved it for him by turning her head and crying in a
shrill cracked voice:</p>
<p>"Harry, lad, come here and see to the gentleman."</p>
<p>A man approached from the back in reply to the call. He was
short and stout, and his perspiring face and bare arms showed that
he had been hard at work. He looked at Crewe, made a movement of
his knuckle towards his forehead, and waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>"I am trying to get in touch with a friend of mine who I believe
motored along this road on Friday last," said Crewe. "It was on
Friday night that we had the big storm. He must have driven along
here on Friday afternoon; he was driving a big grey car. Did you
see him?"</p>
<p>"Friday afternoon?" the man repeated. "I'm just trying to get my
bearings a bit. Yes, Friday was the night we had the storm, and
Friday was the day I seen this gentleman I'm thinking of."</p>
<p>"In a grey car?" suggested Crewe.</p>
<p>"In a grey car, as you say, sir. There ain't so many cars pass
along this road this time of year."</p>
<p>"Then you saw a grey car go past in the direction of Ashlingsea
on Friday afternoon?" said Crewe. He put a hand in his trousers
pocket and jingled the silver there.</p>
<p>"I did," exclaimed the other, with the positiveness of a man who
had awakened to the fact that he possessed valuable information for
which he was to be paid, "I was standing here at this very door
after selling two bushels of apples to Mr. Hope, and was just
thinking about going back to dig some more taters, when I happened
to hear a motor-car coming along. It was the grey car, sure enough,
sir. No doubt about that."</p>
<p>"And was there anyone with my friend&mdash;or was he alone in
the car?"</p>
<p>This was a puzzling question, because it contained no indication
of the answer wanted.</p>
<p>"I can't say I noticed anybody at the time, cos I was thinking
more about my taters&mdash;-it's a bit late to be getting up
taters, as you know, sir. I'd left 'em over late through having so
much thatching to do, there being so few about as can thatch now
that the war is on, and not many at the best o'
times&mdash;thatching being a job as takes time to learn. My father
he was best thatcher they ever did have hereabouts, and it was him
taught me."</p>
<p>"And there was no one but my friend in the car?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't say that I did see any one, my mind being more on
taters, but, mind you, sir, there might have been. Your friend he
went past so quickly I didn't rightly see into the car&mdash;not
from here. It ain't reasonable to expect it, is it, sir?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not," said Crewe. "I'm very much obliged to you."
He produced half a crown and handed it to the man.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir." The unexpected amount of his reward had a
stimulating effect. "I'll tell you a strange thing about your
friend, sir, now that I've had time to think about it. I hadn't dug
more'n a row, or perhaps a row and a half of my taters, when I seen
him coming back again."</p>
<p>"Coming back again?" exclaimed Crewe. "Surely not."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; the same grey car."</p>
<p>"Driving back in the direction of Staveley?"</p>
<p>"Driving back along the road he'd come."</p>
<p>"And this would be less than an hour after you saw him pass the
first time?"</p>
<p>"Not more'n half-hour. I reckon it don't take me full twenty
minutes to dig a row o' taters."</p>
<p>"But the grey car I mean didn't go back past here to Staveley,"
said Crewe. "It was wrecked on Friday night about four miles from
here in the direction of Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>"That's right," exclaimed the man, with childish delight.
"Didn't I see it go past here noon Saturday&mdash;another car
drawing it because it wouldn't work. I said to myself, something's
gone wrong with it."</p>
<p>"But, according to your story, it was driven back to Staveley
that afternoon. The car you saw going back to Staveley could not
have been the car that was wrecked on Friday, unless the driver
turned round again and went back towards Ashlingsea&mdash;but that
seems impossible."</p>
<p>"That's what he did, sir. That's what I was going to tell you,
only I hadn't come to it. What I said was, I hadn't dug more'n a
row and half of taters after dinner afore I see this car coming
back Staveley way, and when I'd got to end of second row I happened
to look up the road and there was this car coming back again. I
didn't know what to think&mdash;that is, at first. I stood there
with the fork in my hand thinking and thinking and saying to myself
I'd not give it up&mdash;I'm a rare one, sir, when I make up my
mind. I don't wonder it's puzzled you, sir, just as it puzzled me.
What has he been driving up and down for&mdash;backwards and
forwards? That's how it puzzled me. Then it came to me quite sudden
like&mdash;he'd lost something and had drove back along the road
until he found it."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>IT was not Elsie Maynard's first visit to London, but her visits
had been so few that London had presented itself to her as a vast
labyrinth of streets, shops and houses. The prevailing impression
of all previous visits was that, since it was a simple matter to
get lost involuntarily in the labyrinth, it would be a simple
matter for any one to disappear voluntarily and remain hidden from
search. But on this occasion, when there was need for secrecy as to
her visit and its object, she fancied the vast city to be full of
prying eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed improbable that among the thousands of people she met
in the streets there would not be some one who knew her. There
might be some one watching her&mdash;some one who had received a
telephone message regarding her journey by train from Ashlingsea.
To disappear from some one who was watching her seemed to be
impossible, for among the throng of people it was impossible to
single out the watcher.</p>
<p>From Victoria Station she took a tube ticket to Earl's Court, so
as to give the impression to any one who was following her that her
destination was in the west of London. She inspected closely all
the people who followed her into the carriage. She alighted at
South Kensington and changed to the Piccadilly tube. She got out at
Holborn and then took a bus to Aldgate. She walked along to the
junction of Whitechapel Road and Commercial Road, where she took a
tram. After a short journey by tram along Commercial Road she got
out and walked along the south side of the street, keeping a look
out for the names of the side streets.</p>
<p>When she reached Quilter Street she turned down it, and
eventually stopped at the door of No. 23. It was a short street
with a monotonous row of houses on each side. At one side of the
corner where it joined Commercial Road was a steam laundry, and at
the other side a grocer's which was also a post office. The faded
wrappings of the tinned goods which had been displayed for many
months in the windows were indicative of the comparative poverty of
the locality. In the ground-floor windows of most of the houses
were cardboard notices showing that tailoring was the craft by
which the inhabitants earned their bread. It was here that a great
deal of the work sent out by tailors' shops in the City was done,
and the placards in the windows proclaimed a desire for work from
chance customers whose clothes needed repairs and pressing.</p>
<p>There were dirty ragged children playing in the gutters, and
dirty slatternly women, with black shawls over their heads and
shoulders and jugs in their hands, were to be seen hurrying along
the pavement for milk and beer. Although Miss Maynard had taken
care not to dress herself elaborately for her journey to London,
she was aware that her appearance before the door of No. 23 was
attracting some attention among the women standing at their doors
and gossiping across area railings. When the door was opened by a
girl in her early teens who had her sleeves rolled up and was
wearing a piece of sacking as an apron, Miss Maynard entered
hurriedly and closed the door after her.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Miller live here?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the girl.</p>
<p>"Is he in now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he told me he was expecting a lady to call. Are you
her?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"First floor&mdash;front," said the girl, jerking a dirty thumb
in the direction of the stairs as an indication to her visitor that
she could find her way up unaided.</p>
<p>But before she had reached the top of the stairs the door of the
front room on the first floor was opened, and the man she had come
to see appeared on the stairs to welcome her. He clasped her hands
eagerly and led her to his room, closing the door carefully behind
him. For a moment he hesitated and then placed his arms around her.
Her head fell back on his shoulder and he pressed his lips to hers
in a long lingering kiss.</p>
<p>Arnold Brett was a young man of spare build whose military
training had taught him to keep his shoulders well back. He had a
slight black moustache, and his hair, which was carefully brushed
down on his head, was raven black in colour. His aquiline nose
seemed to emphasize the sharpness of his features; the glance from
his dark eyes was restless and crafty.</p>
<p>"Darling, I knew you would come," he said. He released her, but
only for the purpose of taking her again in his arms and kissing
her.</p>
<p>"But why are you here?" she asked, giving a glance at the
impoverished furniture&mdash;the narrow bed with its faded
counterpane, the cheap chest of drawers, the dressing-table with a
cracked mirror, the dirty window curtains and the single wooden
chair.</p>
<p>"Before God, I swear I had nothing to do with it, Elsie," he
exclaimed passionately.</p>
<p>It was a relief to hear him declare his innocence. Even if he
had spoken without emphasis she would not have doubted his word. It
was because her belief in his innocence deepened the mystery of his
reason for hiding that she repeated:</p>
<p>"But why are you here?"</p>
<p>"Do you believe me?" he asked. Between lovers faith counts for
much more than reason.</p>
<p>"Of course I do."</p>
<p>"I knew you would," he said. "It is because I know you were true
that I asked you to come. I am beginning to think that perhaps I
made a great mistake in running away. But I was unnerved by the
accident. I was thrown out of the car and I must have been
unconscious in the road for more than an hour. And, recalling how
poor Frank had met his death, it seemed to me that there was a
diabolical scheme on foot to murder me as well. Perhaps I was
wrong. Tell me everything. Do the police suspect me? Have they a
warrant out for me? Did you go to the farm that night? I have sent
out for a newspaper each day, but the London newspapers have said
very little about the murder. All I have seen is a couple of small
paragraphs."</p>
<p>She was more immediately concerned in the discovery that he had
been thrown out of a motor-car and injured than in his thirst for
information about the murder at Cliff Farm. She was solicitous as
to the extent of the injury he had suffered, the length of time he
had been unconscious, and his movements after he came to his senses
on the lonely road. Not only were her feminine sympathies stirred
by the thought of the sufferings of the man she loved, but by the
fear that the accident must have affected his mind temporarily and
prompted him to hide himself.</p>
<p>He was too impatient for her news to spare time for more than a
vague disconnected account of the accident. He assured her that he
was all right again, except for a cut on the head which he showed
her. It was on her news more than on anything else that the
question of his return to Staveley depended.</p>
<p>She told him in response to his questions that the murder had
created a sensation. Every one was talking about it. The
<i>Staveley Courier</i> had published a two column account of the
tragedy with details about the victim and the eccentricities of his
grandfather in later years. Stress was laid, in the newspaper
account of the story, on the rumour that old Joseph Lumsden had
buried his money after the war broke out, and on the disappointment
of the legatees whose legacies could not be paid at his death
because the money could not be found. The police, it was stated,
had questioned these legatees as to their movements on the night of
the murder. The theory of the police seemed to be that the murder
had been committed by some one who had heard about the buried money
and believed it was hidden in the house, or thought the victim had
known where it was hidden.</p>
<p>She told him that Scotland Yard had sent down a detective to
investigate the crime, and that Mr. Crewe, the famous private
detective, was also working on it.</p>
<p>"Crewe!" he exclaimed in dismay. "Who has brought him into
it?"</p>
<p>"He happened to be staying at Staveley with Sir George Granville
on the night of the murder, and when Mr. Marsland rang up his
uncle, Sir George Granville, from the Ashlingsea police station to
say he was all right, and to tell Sir George about the murder, Mr.
Crewe was naturally interested in it. He took up the case on his
own initiative because his host's nephew discovered the body."</p>
<p>"I can't follow you," he said. "Who is Mr. Marsland?" He started
back with a look of terror in his eyes. "My God, you don't mean
Captain Marsland? That is who it is; that is who it is! I knew I
was right."</p>
<p>"Arnold, what is the matter?" she exclaimed, rising to her feet
and putting a hand on his shoulder. "You look dreadful."</p>
<p>"Captain Marsland," he muttered. "Captain Marsland come to life
again." He raised his clenched hand and shook it slowly as if to
give impressive emphasis to his words. "That is the man who shot
poor Frank. I knew I was right."</p>
<p>"Impossible."</p>
<p>He turned on her fiercely.</p>
<p>"Impossible," he echoed. "Who are you to say it is impossible?
What do you know about it or about him? Perhaps you are in love
with him?"</p>
<p>"Don't be foolish, Arnold," she said sternly. "The Mr. Marsland
I am speaking of is not a captain&mdash;at least, he does not wear
uniform, and I have not heard any one call him 'captain.' At any
rate, it is impossible for him to have killed Frank Lumsden. I was
at the farm before he was, and poor Frank's dead body was upstairs
all the time I was there, though I did not know it."</p>
<p>"All the time you were there? When did you get there?"</p>
<p>"About six o'clock&mdash;just as the storm came on."</p>
<p>"Six o'clock? And was there no one at the house when you got
there?"</p>
<p>"No one."</p>
<p>"You saw no trace of anyone having been there?"</p>
<p>"No. I found the key of the door in the lock and naturally I
thought that Frank had left it there&mdash;that you and he were
inside. You remember that you told me to be there about six
o'clock, and that you and Frank would be there before then."</p>
<p>"Yes. That was the arrangement, but&mdash;well, never mind that,
Elsie, now; tell me your story."</p>
<p>"I opened the door and walked in," she said. "I called out 'Is
there anybody in?' but I got no answer. I thought then that you and
Frank were in one of the sheds, and I sat down in the sitting-room,
expecting you would be back in a moment. I took the key out of the
door so as to make you knock in order to get in. The rain was just
commencing then, but it had been blowing hard for half an hour.
About ten minutes after I had been in the sitting-room there was a
knock at the front door. Naturally I thought it was you. I rushed
to open it and as I flung it back I asked what had kept you so
long. But the man on the door step was a stranger&mdash;this Mr.
Marsland."</p>
<p>"What is he like?" asked Brett quickly. "He is rather
good-looking; fair-haired and fair-skinned and blue-eyed&mdash;the
Saxon type. He is about medium height&mdash;not quite so tall as
you."</p>
<p>"How old is he?"</p>
<p>"Quite young&mdash;about 26 or 27, I should say."</p>
<p>"Does he wear glasses&mdash;gold-rimmed eye-glasses?"</p>
<p>"He was not wearing them then, but he does wear them as a rule.
I think he told me subsequently that he had lost a pair while he
was riding along&mdash;blown off by the wind."</p>
<p>"What explanation did he give of his visit?"</p>
<p>"He had been riding across the downs from Staveley and had lost
his way in the storm. His horse was lame and when he saw the house
he decided to seek shelter."</p>
<p>"Did you believe him?"</p>
<p>"Of course I did&mdash;then."</p>
<p>"Do you believe him now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Arnold, after what you have said. He may have
been there before I was&mdash;it may have been he who left the key
in the door."</p>
<p>"I am sure of it."</p>
<p>"He came in and sat down&mdash;he certainly acted as if he had
never been in the house before. I do not know how long we were in
the sitting-room&mdash;perhaps twenty minutes. We did not talk very
much. I was busy trying to think what had become of you and Frank.
I thought it best to tell him as little as possible, so I made up a
story that I had found the door open and had walked in with the
intention of taking shelter until the storm was over. I said
nothing about the key. I began to get a little nervous as we sat
there listening to the storm. I was upset about you."</p>
<p>"Go on," he said impatiently, as she paused.</p>
<p>"Presently we heard a crash upstairs&mdash;it was like breaking
glass or china. Mr. Marsland said he would go upstairs and see what
it was. I determined to go with him, as I was too frightened by
that time to stay alone. On one of the stairs he picked up
Grandfather Lumsden's cryptogram. I felt then that Frank had been
there, and that something dreadful had happened. We went upstairs,
and there we found Frank's dead body in the arm-chair. I thought at
first that he had been taken ill after you and he got there that
afternoon, and that he had died alone while you were away trying to
get a doctor. But Mr. Marsland said he had been shot. Poor Frank!
What a dreadful end."</p>
<p>"What time did you leave?"</p>
<p>"We left almost at once. That would be about a quarter to seven.
He went to Ashlingsea police station to report the discovery of the
body. I asked him not to drag me into it&mdash;not to tell the
police that I had been at the farm. I thought that was the best
thing to do until I saw you&mdash;until I found where you had
been."</p>
<p>"Quite right, Elsie&mdash;everything you do is right, my dear
girl. And while you and this Marsland were at the farm I was just
recovering consciousness on the Staveley road after a bad smash. It
was after five o'clock before I left Staveley; I had told Frank I
would leave about three o'clock, but I was delayed by several
things. He told me he would come along the road to meet me. I was
driving along the road fairly fast in order to reach the farm
before the storm broke, and I must have been dazed by a flash of
lightning. The next thing I remember was being awakened by the rain
falling on my face as I lay unconscious beside the car, which had
been overturned."</p>
<p>"Were you badly hurt, dear?"</p>
<p>"I was badly shaken and bruised, but the only cut was the one on
my head. I didn't know what to do at first. I thought I would walk
back to Staveley and tell them at the garage about the car. But
finally I decided to go on to the Cliff Farm, as it was so much
nearer than Staveley, and then go to Staveley by train in the
morning. It must have been nearly eight o'clock when I reached the
farm and found the front door open."</p>
<p>"We locked it," she interposed. "That is, Mr. Marsland did: he
told me that he was sure he heard the lock click."</p>
<p>"It was open when I got there&mdash;wide open," he
persisted.</p>
<p>"Then Mr. Marsland was right. The murderer was in the house
while we were there. The crash we heard was made by him, and after
we went away he bolted and left the hall door open."</p>
<p>"The murderer was in the house while you were there," he said.
"There is nothing more certain than that. The murderer was Captain
Marsland."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," she said.</p>
<p>"Wasn't it he who put the idea into your head, after you had
left the house, that the murderer might have been upstairs all the
time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was."</p>
<p>"And he told you that he had slammed the hall door when he left?
You didn't see him close it?"</p>
<p>"No, I was waiting for him down the path. After seeing poor
Frank I felt too frightened to stay in the house.</p>
<p>"Marsland left the door open, but told you he had closed it, his
object being to give the police the impression that it had been
left open by some one who left the house after he did. But I closed
it when I left&mdash;I distinctly remember doing so."</p>
<p>"What makes you suspect Marsland? He had no grudge against
Frank. Why should he kill him?"</p>
<p>"If Marsland didn't kill him, who did?"</p>
<p>"Any one may have done so. A tramp, for instance, who had broken
into the house and was there when Frank came home."</p>
<p>"Do tramps in this country carry revolvers?"</p>
<p>"Not usually. But since the war many of the men discharged from
the army do."</p>
<p>"There you've said it. Many of the officers who have been
discharged carry revolvers, but not the men. They have got used to
doing it. At the front only officers carry revolvers. And Marsland
is an officer&mdash;a captain. He was a captain in the London Rifle
Brigade, in the battalion to which Frank and I belonged."</p>
<p>"Oh!" There was a note of dismay in the exclamation of surprise.
"Does he know you, Arnold?"</p>
<p>"I was not one of his company, but of course he knows me."</p>
<p>"Did he know Frank? Do you think he knew Frank when he saw his
dead body in the room?"</p>
<p>"Of course he knew Frank. Frank was in his Company."</p>
<p>"He did not say anything to me about this as we walked home,"
said Elsie thoughtfully. "And perhaps he has not told the police.
It is very strange."</p>
<p>"There is nothing strange about it. He had good reasons for
saying nothing."</p>
<p>"You think he shot Frank? Why should he commit such a
crime?"</p>
<p>"My dear Elsie, strange things happen in war. Frank told me
something about Captain Marsland, and as soon as you mentioned his
name it all came back to me. But we thought he was dead. Frank told
me he was killed at the front&mdash;a stray bullet or
something."</p>
<p>"What was it that Frank told you about him? I must know."</p>
<p>"Marsland sent a man to certain death to get him out of the way.
One night he sent Frank and another man&mdash;Collingwood, I think
Frank said his name was&mdash;as a listening patrol. They had to
crawl up near the German trenches and, lying down with their ears
to the ground, listen for sounds in the German trenches which might
indicate that the Germans were getting ready to make an attack.
While they were out this fellow Collingwood told Frank his history.
Collingwood had a sort of premonition that he would not get back
alive, and he took Frank into his confidence. He said he knew that
Marsland had sent him out in the hope that the Germans would get
him. It appears that Collingwood and Marsland were both in love
with the same girl, and she preferred Collingwood, though her
parents didn't approve of him. Collingwood was a gentleman, like a
great many more of the rankers in Kitchener's Army. He gave Frank a
letter to this girl, and her photograph, and asked Frank to see
that she got them if he himself was killed. And killed he was that
night&mdash;through the treachery of Marsland. While they were
listening they heard the Germans getting ready for an attack. They
crept back to warn their comrades, but there was no one to warn.
The trench had been evacuated. When Marsland sent Frank and
Collingwood out as a listening patrol he had an order in his pocket
to vacate the trench, as it had been decided to fall back half a
mile to a better position. He thought he was sending Collingwood
and Frank to their death. Collingwood was killed. The Germans
attacked before he and Frank could get away, but Frank, as you
know, was taken prisoner. I was taken prisoner the same day, but at
a different sector about a mile away. Subsequently Frank and I met
as prisoners&mdash;and after being tortured by the Germans we got
away."</p>
<p>"And did Frank deliver Collingwood's letter to the girl?"</p>
<p>"No, that is the sad part of it. The Germans took all his papers
from him and he never saw them again. He did not know the address
of the girl or even her name."</p>
<p>"It was a dreadful thing for Captain Marsland to do," she
murmured.</p>
<p>"A great many dreadful things have been done out there," he
said. "I'll tell you my idea of how this murder was committed.
Marsland thought Frank had been killed by the Germans. After riding
across the downs beyond Staveley he met Frank, who was walking
along the road to meet me. He stopped Frank and pretended to be
very friendly to him. They talked over old times at the front,
Marsland being anxious to know how Collingwood had died and whether
Collingwood had any idea that he had been sent to his death. As
there was no sign of my car, Frank turned back with Marsland to the
farm. While they were in the house Frank let slip the fact that
Collingwood had confided in him before he died. Perhaps Marsland
became aware of it through an effort on Frank's part to get from
him the name of the girl to whom Collingwood had been practically
engaged.</p>
<p>"No doubt there were angry words between them; and Marsland, in
order to save himself from being exposed by Frank to the regimental
authorities, and to the girl, shot him dead. That would be a few
minutes before you reached the farm. When you reached the house
Marsland had gone outside to remove traces of the
crime&mdash;perhaps to burn something or to wash blood-stains from
his hands or clothing at the pump. He left the key in the door so
that he could enter the house again. When he found the key gone he
was confused: he was not certain whether he had placed the key in
the lock. He did not believe that any one had entered the house,
but to make sure on that point he knocked. He was surprised when
you opened the door, but he played his part so well that you did
not suspect he had been in the house before. As you had not
discovered the body, he thought it best that you and he should
discover it together. That would be less suspicious, as far as he
was concerned, than for you to go away without discovering it. Had
you betrayed any suspicion that you thought he was the murderer he
would have shot you too, and then made off."</p>
<p>"But his horse was there," she said. "It was quite lame. He
could not have ridden away on it; and to leave it behind was to
leave the police a convincing clue that he had been to Cliff
Farm."</p>
<p>"I was forgetting about his horse," said Brett. "It was the fact
that his horse was there which made him knock after he saw the key
had been taken from the door. He had to brazen it out."</p>
<p>"The police have no suspicion of him, so far as I can
ascertain," said the girl.</p>
<p>"We must direct their attention to him," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Will you come back to Staveley and tell Inspector
Murchison?"</p>
<p>"No, that would be injudicious. My instinct was right in telling
me to get out of sight when I saw Frank's dead body. It was after
you left the house with Marsland that I got there. The door was
open as I said&mdash;Marsland left it open purposely, and told you
a lie about closing it. I went upstairs, as I couldn't see Frank
about below, and when I saw him dead I felt immediately that his
murder was but the continuation of some black deed in France. I
knew instinctively that if I didn't disappear I should be the next
victim. And so I should be if Marsland knew how much I know about
him. The man is a cold-blooded villain, who thinks nothing of
taking human life. If I went back to Staveley and accused him, he
would take steps to put me out of the way. We must get him arrested
for the murder, and when he is under lock and key I'll come back to
Staveley and tell the police all I know about him."</p>
<p>"But how can we get the police to arrest him unless you first
tell them all you know?" she asked.</p>
<p>"We must find a way," he said thoughtfully.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>CREWE engaged a room in Whitethorn Gardens in order to watch
Mrs. Penfield's movements, and took up his post of observation
immediately. As he did not want Mrs. Penfield to know he was
watching her house, he had chosen an attic bedroom on the opposite
side and some distance higher up the steep street&mdash;an elevated
vantage point, which not only commanded a view of all the houses in
the street but of a great portion of Staveley and the surrounding
country-side as well. From this eyrie the detective could see the
front, the downs, and the distant cliff road to Ashlingsea; but the
residence of Brett's landlady engrossed his attention.</p>
<p>There was very little sign of life in the street. One or two old
ladies walked primly in the front gardens before dusk, but went
inside as soon as the evening sea-mist began to rise. Sedate
maidservants lit the gas and lowered blinds, and the street was
left to darkness till a lamplighter came and lit a street-lamp
which stood near No. 41. Crewe observed that the front rooms of No.
41 remained black and unlighted: apparently Mrs. Penfield lived in
the back of the house and took her meals there.</p>
<p>As darkness was falling, Mrs. Penfield's elderly servant came
from the back of the house, carrying a large basket. She went out
of the front gate, turned up the street, and disappeared round the
corner. About half an hour later Crewe heard the front gate click,
and saw Mrs. Penfield appear. Her face was plainly visible by the
street light as she glanced anxiously up and down the street
several times, as though she feared she was watched. Then she
turned down the street and walked quickly away.</p>
<p>Crewe ran downstairs, let himself noiselessly out of the front
door and followed quickly in her wake. As he neared the bottom of
the street, he saw her a little distance in front of him. When she
reached the end of Whitethorn Gardens she turned to the right along
the sea front.</p>
<p>The night was mild, and a few drops of rain were falling. The
front seemed deserted, and was shrouded in a mist which reduced the
lamplights to a yellow glimmer. It was an easy matter for Crewe to
follow closely behind the woman, conscious that the mist would
shield him from observation if she turned.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penfield walked rapidly along the front till she came to
High Street. Half-way along the front the mist seemed suddenly to
grow thicker and Crewe crept closer in order to keep her in view.
She walked swiftly with her head down, looking neither to the right
nor the left. She passed under the faint light of a street lamp,
and as Crewe came up behind he saw a uniformed figure in front of
him. It was Police Constable Heather who had come over from
Ashlingsea on official business. Heather was so pleased at this
unexpected meeting with the great London detective that he called
out in a loud voice:</p>
<p>"Good night, Mr. Crewe."</p>
<p>Crewe answered softly and passed on. He could only hope that
Mrs. Penfield was so absorbed in her own thoughts that she had not
heard Constable Heather's stentorian utterance of his name.
Suddenly he heard her footsteps cease and he, too, came to a stop.
Then he saw her confronting him.</p>
<p>"Why are you following me, Mr. Crewe?" she asked in quick
excited tones. "It was you who telephoned to me to come up and see
Inspector Murchison. I should have known it was a hoax. You wanted
to get me out of the house."</p>
<p>"If I wanted to get you out of the house, Mrs. Penfield, why
should I follow you?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"But you were following me," she persisted.</p>
<p>"It is not the sort of night I would choose for such work," he
replied.</p>
<p>"When I heard that man call out your name, I knew I had been
hoaxed."</p>
<p>"By whom?" asked Crewe, who was puzzled at this example of
feminine reasoning.</p>
<p>"I shall go back and see," she said. "I will ring up Inspector
Murchison from there and find out if he sent a message to me to go
up to the police station."</p>
<p>Crewe was keenly interested in knowing if she had been hoaxed,
and by whom. Therefore he offered to accompany her home, as it was
not a nice night for a lady to be in the street unattended.</p>
<p>When they reached 41 Whitethorn Gardens, she opened the gate,
and walked up to the house rapidly. At the porch she stopped,
touched Crewe lightly on the arm, and pointed to the front door. In
the dim light a patch of blackness showed; the door was open.</p>
<p>"Come with me," she whispered, "and we will take him by
surprise. Don't strike a match; give me your hand." She walked
noiselessly along the dark hall, and turning into a passage some
distance down it led the way through an open doorway into a
room&mdash;a small and stuffy storeroom, Crewe imagined it to be,
as the air was suggestive of cheese and preserves.</p>
<p>"Go, Arnold, the police are here! Go at once!"</p>
<p>The words rang shrilly through the house. Crewe realized that he
had been tricked by the woman and he sprang forward to the door.
But the click of a lock told him he was too late. He struck a match
and its light revealed to him Mrs. Penfield standing with her back
against the door she had closed.</p>
<p>"There is a candle on the shelf behind you," she said
composedly.</p>
<p>Crewe's glance followed the turn of her head; he lit the candle
with his expiring match. The candle flickered, then burnt brightly,
and the detective saw that he was in a small storeroom with shelves
lining the walls. He turned again to Mrs. Penfield who was watching
him closely.</p>
<p>"Why did you alarm him?" he asked. "You think it was Brett?"</p>
<p>Although his tone was one of curiosity rather than anger, the
woman threw her arms out at full length as though she feared he
would attempt to drag her away from the door.</p>
<p>"Do not be afraid," said Crewe. "You have nothing to fear from
me. And, as for him, it is too late to pursue him."</p>
<p>"I must give him ample time to make his escape," she said. "You
will go and tell the police he was here."</p>
<p>"What makes you think it was Brett?" asked Crewe. "If he came
back this way&mdash;if he hoaxed you with a telephone message in
order to get you out of the house&mdash;he has shown a lamentable
want of trust in you."</p>
<p>"He knows he can trust me," she said confidently. "He can never
doubt it after to-night."</p>
<p>"I cannot conceive why he should take the great risk of coming
back," he said meditatively.</p>
<p>"That means you would like to go up to his rooms and find out
what he came for. But I forbid you. If you attempt to go upstairs,
I will rouse the neighbourhood with the cry that there are burglars
in the house."</p>
<p>"I think you have more reason to be afraid of the police than
I," said Crewe. "However, I am in your hands. As far as I am
concerned, you can have full credit for having saved him
to-night."</p>
<p>She showed her faith in this assurance by unlocking the door.
Taking the candle from the shelf, she led the way along the passage
and the hall again. She opened the front door, and held the candle
higher to light him out. She stood in the open doorway till Crewe
reached the garden gate.</p>
<p>He walked back along the front. The mist was still rising from
the sea in great white billows, which rolled across the beach and
shrouded everything in an impenetrable veil. It penetrated
unpleasantly into the eyes and throat, and Crewe was glad when he
turned off the deserted parade and reached Sir George Granville's
house.</p>
<p>The servant who admitted him told him the family were in the
drawing-room, and thither he directed his steps. Lady Granville was
seated at the piano, playing softly. Marsland in an easy chair was
listlessly turning over the pages of a bound volume of
<i>Punch</i>. Sir George was in another easy chair a little
distance away, nodding in placid slumber with his handsome white
beard on his breast, and an extinguished cigar between his
fingers.</p>
<p>Lady Granville smiled at Crewe as he entered, and stopped
playing. The cessation of the music awakened Sir George, and when
he saw Crewe his eyes wandered towards the chess-table.</p>
<p>"Do you feel inclined for a game of chess?" he exclaimed in his
loud voice. "I want my revenge, you know."</p>
<p>"I'll be pleased to give it to you," responded Crewe.</p>
<p>"A very unpleasant night outside," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"The mist seems to be thicker up this end of the front," replied
Crewe. "Have you been out in it?"</p>
<p>"I came in about five minutes ago. I went for a walk."</p>
<p>Lady Granville took a book and seated herself not far from the
chess-table. Marsland came and stood near the players, watching the
game. He soon got tired of it, however, and went back to
<i>Punch</i>. Sir George was a slow player at all times, and his
anxiety when pitted against a renowned player like Crewe made him
slower than usual. He studied each move of Crewe's in all its
bearings before replying, scrutinizing the board with set face,
endeavouring to penetrate his opponent's intentions, and imagining
subtle traps where none existed. Meanwhile, his fingers hovered
nervously above the pieces with the irresoluteness of a
chess-player weighed down by the heavy responsibility of his next
move, and, finally, when the plunge had been taken Sir George sat
back, stroking his long white beard doubtfully, and fixed his eyes
on Crewe, as though mutely asking his opinion of the move. "Game"
seemed an inappropriate word to apply to chess as played by Sir
George Granville.</p>
<p>It was during one of these strategical pauses, after the game
had been in progress for nearly an hour, that Crewe heard a
frightened exclamation from Lady Granville. He looked up and saw
Marsland standing near the fire-place with his hand over his heart,
swaying as though about to fall. Crewe sprang forward and supported
him to an easy chair.</p>
<p>"A little brandy," said Crewe quietly.</p>
<p>Sir George hurriedly brought a decanter of brandy and a glass,
and Crewe poured a little down Marsland's throat. The colour came
slowly back to the young man's cheeks, and he smiled feebly at the
three faces looking down at him.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I've been giving you a lot of trouble," he said,
with an obvious effort to collect himself.</p>
<p>"I'll ring up for Dr. Harrison," Sir George spoke in a loud
voice, as though to reassure himself.</p>
<p>"There is not the slightest need to send for Harrison," said
Marsland. "I'm quite right again. I must expect these attacks
occasionally for some time to come. They're nothing&mdash;just
weakness. All I need is a good night's rest, and if you'll excuse
me I'll retire now." He got up and walked resolutely out of the
room with square shoulders, as though to demonstrate to those
watching him that no trace of his weakness remained.</p>
<p>"Do you think it is safe to leave him alone?" said Sir George
turning to Crewe, as the door closed on his nephew's retreating
figure. "I feel very anxious about him. Anything might happen to
him during the night."</p>
<p>"A good night's rest will do him more good than anything else.
He has been under a rather severe nervous strain during the last
few days. We will go to his room in a few minutes to see how he
is."</p>
<p>They settled down to their game again and Lady Granville moved
up her chair near the chess-table for the sake of their company and
pretended to take an interest in the game. Only a few moves had
been made when there was a loud report of an explosion. Lady
Granville jumped up from her chair and screamed and then fell back
into the chair in a faint.</p>
<p>"Look to her," said Crewe to his host, "while I go and see
what's the matter."</p>
<p>As he ran along the hall to the staircase he met two of the
maids, who with white faces and hands clasped in front of them
seemed too frightened to move.</p>
<p>"Where was it?" asked Crewe. "Upstairs?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, upstairs," said one of them.</p>
<p>"It came from Mr. Marsland's room," added the other, in an awed
whisper.</p>
<p>Crewe ran straight for Marsland's room, expecting to find there
some evidence of a tragedy. As he burst into the room he saw to his
great relief that Marsland was there, leaning out of the
window.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Crewe. "Did you fire a revolver?"</p>
<p>Marsland, who was wearing a dressing-gown, came from the window.
In his right hand he was holding a big revolver.</p>
<p>"I missed him," he said, "Missed whom?"</p>
<p>"A burglar."</p>
<p>"It is very early in the night for a burglar to be out."</p>
<p>"He took advantage of the mist. He must have thought that there
was no one in the room. I had turned out the light and was resting
on the bed. I was half asleep, but he knocked a brush off the
dressing-table as he was getting through the window and that woke
me up. I caught a good glimpse of him and I fired. He dropped at
once, and I thought I had hit him, but when I looked out of the
window I saw him disappear in the mist. What an awful pity I didn't
get him."</p>
<p>"How did you happen to be lying down with a revolver beside
you?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"I often take it to bed with me. That is the result of the life
at the front. And to-night I had a kind of presentiment that I
should need it."</p>
<p>It occurred to Crewe that the young man had been subject to
hallucinations during his illness. This habit of sleeping with a
revolver under his pillow seemed to indicate that his cure was
still far from complete. Was the burglar a phantom of a sick
mind?</p>
<p>He went over to the window for the purpose of looking out but
his attention was arrested by a stain on the outside sill.</p>
<p>"You did not miss him altogether," he said to Marsland. "Look
here."</p>
<p>Marsland touched the stain and held a blood-stained finger up to
the light for his own inspection.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>CREWE steered to the stone landing-place and tied the little
motor-boat to a rusty iron ring which dangled from a stout wooden
stake, wedged between two of the seaweed covered stones. The tide
was out, and the top of the landing-place stood well out of the
water, but it was an easy matter for a young and vigorous man to
spring up to the top, though three rough and slippery steps had
been cut near the ring, perhaps for the original builder in his old
and infirm days.</p>
<p>Looking down, he noticed that while his little boat floated
easily enough alongside, a boat of slightly deeper draught would
have scraped on the rocky bottom, which was visible through the
clear water. The surface of the landing-place was moist, and the
intersections between the rough stones were filled with seaweed and
shells, indicating that the place was covered at high tide.</p>
<p>Crewe had come from Staveley by boat instead of motoring across,
his object being to make a complete investigation of Cliff Farm
without attracting chance attention or rural curiosity about his
motor-car, which was too big to go into the stables. He wanted to
be undisturbed and uninterrupted in his investigation of the house.
As he entered the boat-house, he looked back to where he had left
his boat, and saw that the landing-place was high enough out of the
water to prevent passers-by on the cliff road seeing the boat
before high tide. By that time he hoped to have completed his
investigations and be on his way back to Staveley.</p>
<p>The boat-house was a small and rickety structure perched on a
rough foundation of stones, which had been stacked to the same
height as the landing-place. The inside was dismal and damp, and
the woodwork was decaying. Part of the roof had fallen in, and the
action of wind and sea and storm had partly destroyed the boarded
sides. Many of the boards had parted from the joists, and hung
loosely, or had fallen on the stones. An old boat lay on the oozing
stones, with its name, <i>Polly</i>, barely decipherable on the
stern, and a kedge anchor and rotting coil of rope inside it. Crewe
had no doubt that it was the boat James Lumsden used to go fishing
in many years ago. A few decayed boards in front of the boat-house
indicated the remains of a wooden causeway for launching the boat.
In a corner of the shed was a rusty iron windlass, which suggested
the means whereby the eccentric old man had been able to house his
boat without assistance when he returned with his catch.</p>
<p>Having finished his scrutiny of the boatshed and its contents,
Crewe made his way up the cliff path, and walked across the strip
of downs to the farm.</p>
<p>Cliff Farm looked the picture of desolation and loneliness in
the chill, grey autumn afternoon. Its gaunt, closely-shuttered
ugliness confronted Crewe uncompromisingly, as though defying him
to wrest from it the secret of the tragic death of its owner. It
already had that air of neglect and desertion which speedily
overtakes the house which has lost its habitants. There was no sign
of any kind of life; the meadows were empty of live-stock.
Somewhere in the outbuildings at the side of the house an
unfastened door flapped and banged drearily in the wind. Even the
front door required main strength to force it open after it had
been unlocked, as though it shared with the remainder of the house
the determination to keep the secret of the place, and resented
intrusion. The interior of the house was dark, close and musty.
Through the closed and shuttered windows not a ray of light or a
breath of air had been able to find an entrance.</p>
<p>Crewe's first act was to open the shutters and the windows on
the ground floor; his next to fling open the front and back doors,
and the doors of the rooms. He wanted all the light he could get
for the task before him, and some fresh air to breathe. He soon had
both: wholesale, pure strong air from the downs, blowing in through
doors and windows, stirring up the accumulated dust on the floors,
causing it to float and dance in the sunbeams that streamed in the
front windows from the rays of an evening sun, which had succeeded
in freeing himself in his last moments above the horizon from the
mass of grey clouds that had made the day so chill and
cheerless.</p>
<p>Crewe commenced to examine each room and its contents with the
object of trying to discover something which would assist him in
his investigation of the Cliff Farm murder. He worked carefully and
minutely, but with the swiftness and method of a practised
observer.</p>
<p>The front room that he first entered detained him only a few
minutes. Originally designed for the sitting-room, it had been
dismantled and contained very little furniture, and had evidently
not been used for a considerable time. A slight fissure in the
outside wall explained the reason: the fissure had made the room
uninhabitable by admitting wind and weather, causing damp to appear
on the walls, and loosening the wall-paper till it hung in
festoons.</p>
<p>Crewe next examined the opposite front room in which Sergeant
Westaway conducted his preliminary inquiries into the murder. This
room was simply furnished with furniture of an antique pattern.
Apparently it had been used at a more or less recent date as the
sitting-room, for a few old books and a couple of modern cheaply
bound novels were lying about; a needle with a piece of darning
cotton which was stuck in the wall suggested a woman's occupation,
or perhaps the murdered man or his grandson had done bachelor
darning there in the winter evenings. The latter hypothesis seemed
most probable to Crewe: only a very untidy member of the other sex
would have left a darning needle sticking in the sitting-room
wall.</p>
<p>Crewe then examined the room behind the front room in which
Marsland and Miss Maynard had sat before discovering the murdered
man. It was the front room of an English farm-house of a bygone
age, kept for show and state occasions but not for use, crowded
with big horse-hair chairs and a horse-hair sofa. There were two
tables&mdash;a large round one with a mahogany top and a smaller
one used as a stand for the lamp Marsland had lit&mdash;a glass
case of stuffed birds; an old clock in a black case on the
mantelpiece, which had been stopped so long that its works were
festooned with spiders' webs; a few dingy oil-paintings on the
walls, alternately representing scenes from the Scriptures and the
English chase, and a moth-eaten carpet on the floor. There was also
a small glass bookcase in a corner containing some bound volumes of
the <i>Leisure Hour</i> of the sixties, <i>Peter Parley's Annual,
Johnson's Dictionary</i>, an ancient <i>Every Day Book</i>, and an
old family Bible with brass clasps.</p>
<p>It was in the room next to the sitting-room that Crewe found the
first article which suggested possibilities of a clue. It was a
small room, which had evidently been used by a former occupant as
an office, for it contained an oak case holding account books, some
files of yellowing bills hanging from nails on the wall, and an
old-fashioned writing bureau. It was this last article that
attracted Crewe's attention. It was unlocked, and he examined
closely the papers it contained. But they threw no light on the
mystery of Cliff Farm, being for the most part business letters,
receipted bills, and household accounts.</p>
<p>There was a bundle of faded letters in one of the pigeon-holes
tied with black ribbon, which had been written to Mrs. James
Lumsden from somebody who signed himself "Yours to command,
Geoffrey La Touche." These letters were forty years old, and had
been sent during a period of three years from "Her Majesty's sloop
<i>Hyacinth</i>" at different foreign ports. They were stiff and
formal, though withal courteous in tone, and various passages in
them suggested that the writer had been an officer in the Royal
Navy and a relative of Mrs. Lumsden. They ceased with a letter
written to "James Lumsden, Esq.," expressing the writer's "deep
regret and sincere sorrow" on learning of his "dear niece's sad and
premature end."</p>
<p>There was another room opposite this office which had doubtless
been intended for a breakfast-room, but was now stored with odds
and ends: superfluous articles of furniture, some trunks, a pile of
bound volumes of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, and a few
boxes full of miscellaneous rubbish. The passage on which these
rooms opened terminated in two stone steps leading into the
kitchen, which was the full width of the house. A notable piece of
furniture in this room was an oaken dresser with shelves reaching
to the ceiling. There were also a deal table, some kitchen chairs,
and an arm-chair.</p>
<p>From the blackened beams of its low sloping ceiling some hams
and strings of onions hung, and an open tea-caddy stood on the
table, with a leaden spoon in it, as though somebody had recently
been making tea. An old brown earthenware teapot stood by the
fire-place with tea-leaves still in the pot, and Crewe noticed on
the mantelpiece a churchwarden pipe, with a spill of paper
alongside. He found a pair of horn spectacles and an old newspaper
on the top of the press beside the old-fashioned fire-place.
Evidently the kitchen had been the favourite room of Frank
Lumsden's grandfather&mdash;the eccentric old man who had built the
landing-place.</p>
<p>Before examining the upper portion of the house Crewe closed the
doors and windows he had opened, restoring things to the condition
in which he had found them. Then he went upstairs, and, after
opening the windows and blinds as he had opened them downstairs,
entered the room in which the murdered man had been discovered.</p>
<p>It was while Crewe was thus engaged that his quick ears detected
a slight crunch of footsteps on the ground outside, as though
somebody was approaching the house. The room he was searching
looked out on pasture land, but he was aware that there was a
gravel path on the other side, running from the outbuildings at the
side to the rear of the house. He crossed over to the corresponding
room on that side of the house, and looked out of the open window,
but could see no one.</p>
<p>He ran quietly downstairs and into the kitchen. His idea was to
watch the intruder by looking through one of the kitchen windows,
without revealing his own presence, but he found to his annoyance
that the little diamond shaped kitchen window which looked out on
the back was so placed as to command a view of only a small portion
of the bricked yard at the back of the house.</p>
<p>He waited for a moment in the hope that the visitor would enter
the house through the unlocked kitchen door, but as he heard no
further sound he decided to go in search of the person whose
footsteps he had heard. He opened the door and looked over the
empty yard. Suddenly a woman's figure appeared in the doorway of
the barn on the left. Immediately she saw Crewe she retreated into
the shed in the hope that she had not been seen. In order to
undeceive her on this point, Crewe walked down the yard to the
barn, but before he reached it she came out to meet him. She was
young and pretty and well dressed.</p>
<p>"You are Mr. Crewe," she said with composure. "And you are Miss
Maynard. We have not met before, but I have heard a great deal
about you."</p>
<p>She read suspicion in his use of the conventional phrase and she
decided to meet it.</p>
<p>"I came out to look at the old place&mdash;at the scene of this
dreadful tragedy&mdash;before finally deciding what I ought to
do."</p>
<p>He realized that having said so much she had more to say, and he
gave her no assistance.</p>
<p>"Perhaps Mr. Marsland has not told you, Mr. Crewe, that I was
with him in the house when he discovered the body."</p>
<p>"He has not," replied Crewe.</p>
<p>"That makes it all the more difficult for me. I do not mind
telling you, for you are his friend, and you are such a clever man
that I feel I will be right in taking your advice."</p>
<p>Crewe's mental reservation to be slow in offering her advice was
an indication that his suspicions of her were not allayed.</p>
<p>"I also sought shelter here from the storm on that fateful
night," she continued. "But because I was afraid of the gossip of
Ashlingsea I asked Mr. Marsland if he would mind keeping my name
out of it. And he very generously promised to do so."</p>
<p>"A grave error on both sides," said Crewe.</p>
<p>She was quick in seizing the first opening he gave her.</p>
<p>"That is the conclusion I have come to; that is why I think I
ought to go to the police and tell them that I was here. They may
be able to make something out of my story&mdash;they may be able to
see more in it than I can. My simple statement of facts might fit
in with some other information in their possession of which I know
nothing, and in that way might lead to the detection of the man who
killed Frank Lumsden. But how can I go to them and tell them I was
here after I begged Mr. Marsland to say nothing about me? He would
never forgive me for placing him in such an embarrassing position.
It would not be right."</p>
<p>"And it is not right to keep from the police any information to
which they are entitled."</p>
<p>"That is my difficulty," she said, with a smile of gratitude to
him for stating it so clearly.</p>
<p>"I have no hesitation in advising you to tell the police the
whole truth," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"And Mr. Marsland?"</p>
<p>"He must extricate himself from the position in which his
promise to you has placed him. He knows that the promise should
never have been made, and doubtless in the end he will be glad to
have been released from it."</p>
<p>"I hope he will understand my motives," she said.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. But he will begin to realize, what all young men
have to learn, that it is sometimes difficult to understand the
motives which actuate young ladies."</p>
<p>That reply seemed to indicate to her that their conversation had
reached the level of polite banter.</p>
<p>"Will you plead for me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"That is outside my province," was the disappointing reply. "I
understood you to say, Miss Maynard, that you came here that night
for shelter from the storm. Did you arrive at the house before
Marsland or after him?" There was a moment of hesitation before her
reply was given.</p>
<p>"A few minutes before him."</p>
<p>"No doubt you will materially assist the police by giving them a
full account of what you know," said Crewe.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>"GOOD MORNING, sergeant."</p>
<p>"Good morning, Miss Maynard. What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>It was seldom that Sergeant Westaway was so obliging as to make
a voluntary offer of his services, but then it was still more
seldom that a young lady of Miss Maynard's social standing came to
seek his advice or assistance at the police station. As the
daughter of a well-to-do lady, Miss Maynard was entitled to
official respect.</p>
<p>The sergeant had known Miss Maynard since her mother had first
come to live at Ashlingsea fifteen years ago. He had seen her grow
up from a little girl to a young lady, but the years had increased
the gulf between them. As a schoolgirl home from her holidays it
was within the sergeant's official privilege to exchange a word or
two when saluting her in the street. Her development into long
dresses made anything more than a bare salutation savour of
familiarity, and the sergeant knew his place too well to be guilty
of familiarity with those above him.</p>
<p>With scrupulous care he had always uttered the name "Miss
Maynard," when saluting her in those days, so that she might
recognize that he was one of the first to admit the claims of
adolescence to the honours of maturity. Then came a time with the
further lapse of years when she reached the threshold of womanhood,
and to utter her name in salutation would have savoured of
familiarity. So the salute became a silent one as indicative of
Sergeant Westaway's recognition that his voice could not carry
across the increased gulf between them.</p>
<p>"I have something very important to tell you," said Miss
Maynard, in reply to his intimation that the full extent of his
official powers were at her disposal.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>The sergeant realized that a matter of great personal importance
to Miss Maynard might readily prove to be of minor consequence to
him when viewed through official glasses; but there was no hint of
this in the combination of politeness and obsequiousness with which
he opened the door leading from the main room of the little police
station to his private room behind it.</p>
<p>He placed a chair for her at the office table and then went
round to his own chair and stood beside it. There was a pause, due
to the desire to be helped with questions, but Sergeant Westaway's
social sense was greater than his sense of official importance, and
he waited for her to begin.</p>
<p>"It is about the Cliff Farm murder," she said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>"Oh!" It was an exclamation in which astonishment and
anticipation of official delight were blended. "And do you&mdash;do
you know anything about it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I am not sure what you will think of my story&mdash;whether
there is any clue in it. I must leave that for you to judge. But I
feel that I ought to tell you all that I do know."</p>
<p>"Quite right," said the sergeant. His official manner, rising
like a tide, was submerging his social sense of inequality. "There
is nothing like telling the police the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. It is always the best way." His social sense
made a last manifestation before it threw up its arms and sank.
"Not that I suppose for one moment, Miss Maynard, that you had
anything to do with it&mdash;that is to say, that you actually
participated in the crime."</p>
<p>He looked at her inquiringly and she shook her head, smiling
sadly as she did so.</p>
<p>"But there is no reason why, after all, you might not know who
did it," said the sergeant in a coaxing voice which represented an
appeal to her to do her best to justify his high hopes. "In some
respects it is a mysterious crime, and although the police have
their suspicions&mdash;and very strong suspicions too&mdash;they
are always glad to get reliable information, especially when it
supports their suspicions."</p>
<p>"And whom do you suspect?" she asked.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway was taken aback at such a question. It was
such an outrageous attempt to penetrate the veil of official
secrecy that he could refrain from rebuking her only by excusing it
on the ground of her youth and inexperience.</p>
<p>"At present I can say nothing," was his reply.</p>
<p>She turned aside from his official manoeuvring and took up her
own story:</p>
<p>"What I came to tell you is that I was at Cliff Farm on the
night that poor Mr. Lumsden was shot."</p>
<p>"You were there when he was shot?" exclaimed the sergeant.</p>
<p>"No; he was dead when I got there."</p>
<p>"Did you hear the shot?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But you saw some one?"</p>
<p>"I saw Mr. Marsland."</p>
<p>"Ah!" The commonplace tone in which the word was uttered
indicated that the sergeant was deeply disappointed with her story.
"We know all about his visit there. He came and told us&mdash;it
was through him that we discovered the body. He has been
straightforwardness itself: he has told us everything."</p>
<p>"Did he tell you I was there?"</p>
<p>"No; he has not mentioned your name. Perhaps he didn't see
you."</p>
<p>"We were in the house together, and I was with him when he went
upstairs and discovered the body."</p>
<p>"He has said nothing about this," said the sergeant
impressively. "His conduct is very strange in that respect."</p>
<p>"I am afraid I am to blame for that," she said. "As he walked
home with me from the farm on his way to the police station I asked
him if he would mind saying nothing about my presence at the house.
I told him that I was anxious to avoid all the worry and
unpleasantness I should have to put up with if it was publicly
known that I had been there. He readily agreed not to mention my
name. I thought at the time that it was very kind of him, but in
thinking it all over since I am convinced that I did wrong. I have
come to the conclusion that it was a very extraordinary thing for
him to agree to as he did, not knowing me&mdash;we had never met
before. I felt that the right thing to do was to come to you and
tell you all I know so that you can compare it with what Mr.
Marsland has told you. In that way you will be able to make fuller
inquiries, and to acquit him of any sinister motive in his kind
offer to me to keep my name out of it."</p>
<p>The sergeant nodded his head slowly. There was much to take in,
and he was not a rapid thinker.</p>
<p>"Any sinister motive?" he repeated after a long pause.</p>
<p>"Of course I don't wish to cast any suspicions on Mr. Marsland,"
she said looking at the police officer steadily. "But it has
already occurred to you, Sergeant, that Mr. Marsland, in kindly
keeping my name out of it, had to depart from the truth in the
story he told you about his presence at Cliff Farm, and that he may
have thought it advisable to depart from the truth in some other
particulars as well."</p>
<p>The sergeant's mental process would not have carried him that
far without assistance, but there was no conscious indication of
assistance in the emphasis with which he said:</p>
<p>"I see that."</p>
<p>"Let me tell you exactly what happened so far as I am
concerned," she went on.</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly." He sat down in his chair and vaguely seized
his pen. "I'll write it down, Miss Maynard, and get you to sign it.
Don't go too fast for me; and it will be better for you if you take
time&mdash;you will be able to think it over as you go along. This
promises to be most important. Detective Gillett of Scotland Yard
will be anxious to see it. I am sorry he's not here now; he has
been recalled to London, but I expect him down again tomorrow."</p>
<p>"On Friday, the night of the storm, I left my house about
dusk&mdash;that would be after five o'clock&mdash;with the
intention of taking a walk," she began. "I walked along the downs
in the direction of Cliff Farm, intending to return along the sands
from the cliff pathway. I was on the downs when the storm began to
gather. I thought of retracing my steps, but the storm gathered so
swiftly and blew so fiercely that I was compelled to seek shelter
in the only house for miles around&mdash;Cliff Farm.</p>
<p>"The wind was blowing hard and big drops of rain were falling
when I reached the door. I knocked, but received no answer. Then I
noticed that the key was in the door. Owing to the darkness, which
had come on rapidly with the storm, I had not seen it at first. The
door had a Yale lock and the key turned very easily. I was wearing
light gloves, and when I turned the key in the lock I noticed it
was sticky. I looked at my glove and saw a red stain&mdash;it was
blood."</p>
<p>"Ah!" interrupted Sergeant Westaway. "A red stain&mdash;blood?
Just wait a minute while I catch up to you."</p>
<p>"I was slightly alarmed at that," she continued, after a pause;
"but I had no suspicion that a cruel murder had been committed. In
my alarm I took the key out of the lock and closed the door. I felt
safer with the door locked against any possible intruder. I went
into the sitting-room and sat down, after lighting a candle that I
found on the hallstand. Then it occurred to me that Mr. Lumsden
might have left the key in the door while he went to one of the
outbuildings to do some work. The blood might have got on it from a
small cut on his hand."</p>
<p>"What did you do with the key?" asked the Sergeant.</p>
<p>"I brought it with me here." She opened her bag and handed a key
to the police officer.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway looked at it closely. Inside the hole made for
the purpose of placing the key on a ring he saw a slight stain of
dried blood. He nodded to Miss Maynard and she continued her
story.</p>
<p>"I felt more at ease then, and when I heard a knock at the door
I felt sure it was he&mdash;that he had seen the light of the
candle through the window and knew that whoever had taken the key
had entered the house. I opened the door, but it was not Mr.
Lumsden I saw, but Mr. Marsland. He said something about wanting
shelter from the storm&mdash;that his horse had gone lame. He came
inside and sat down. I told him that I, too, had sought shelter
from the storm and that I supposed Mr. Lumsden, the owner of the
house, was in one of the outbuildings attending to the animals. I
saw that he was watching me closely and I felt uneasy. Then I saw
him put his hand to the upper pocket of his waistcoat."</p>
<p>"What was that for?" asked the sergeant.</p>
<p>"I think he must have lost a pair of glasses and temporarily
forgotten that they were gone. He was not wearing glasses when I
saw him but I have noticed since that he does wear them."</p>
<p>"I've noticed the same thing," said the sergeant. "He was not
wearing glasses the night he came here to report the discovery of
Mr. Lumsden's body&mdash;I am sure of that."</p>
<p>Miss Maynard, on resuming her narrative, told how Mr. Marsland
and she, hearing a crash in one of the rooms overhead, went
upstairs to investigate and found the dead body of the victim
sitting in an armchair. When she realized that a dreadful crime had
been committed she ran out of the house in terror. She waited in
the path for Mr. Marsland and he was kind enough to escort her
home. It was because she was so unnerved by the tragedy that she
had asked Mr. Marsland to keep her name out of it not to tell any
one that she had taken shelter at the farm. It was a dreadful
experience and she wanted to try and forget all about it. But now
she realized that she had done wrong and that she should have come
to the police station with Mr. Marsland and told what she knew.</p>
<p>"That is quite right, Miss Maynard," said the sergeant, as he
finished writing down her statement. "Does Mr. Marsland know that
you have come here to-day with the intention of making a
statement?"</p>
<p>"No; he does not, and for that reason I feel that I am not
treating him fairly after he was so kind in consenting to keep my
name out of it."</p>
<p>The sergeant had but a limited view of moral ethics where they
conflicted with the interests of the police.</p>
<p>"He should not have kept your name from me," he said. "But,
apart from what you have told me, have you any reason for
suspecting that Mr. Marsland had anything to do with the murder of
Frank Lumsden?"</p>
<p>"That it was he who left the key in the door?"</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;yes."</p>
<p>"If that is the case, his object in leaving the house for a few
minutes might be to destroy traces of his guilt. But I saw nothing
of a suspicious nature in his manner after I admitted him to the
house."</p>
<p>The sergeant was impressed with the closeness of her
reasoning&mdash;it seemed to shed more light. Clearly she had given
the matter the fullest consideration before deciding to make a
statement.</p>
<p>She added with a slight laugh:</p>
<p>"You cannot call his action in feeling for a missing pair of
glasses suspicious?"</p>
<p>"No, no," said the sergeant generously. "We can scarcely call
that suspicious."</p>
<p>"What I do regard as suspicious&mdash;or, at any rate, as
wanting in straightforwardness&mdash;is the fact that Mr. Marsland
did not tell me that he knew Mr. Lumsden in France. They were both
in the London Rifle Brigade&mdash;Mr. Marsland was a captain and
Mr. Lumsden a private."</p>
<p>"Where did you learn this, Miss Maynard?" was the excited
question. "Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Hasn't he told the police?" she asked in a tone of
astonishment. "Then perhaps it is not true."</p>
<p>"Where did you hear it?"</p>
<p>"In Staveley. I was talking to a wounded officer there on the
front&mdash;Mr. Blake. He knew Mr. Marsland as Captain Marsland and
he knew Mr. Lumsden as well. I think he said poor Mr. Lumsden had
been Captain Marsland's orderly for a time."</p>
<p>"I must look into this," said Sergeant Westaway.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Mr. Blake has returned to the front. He left
Staveley yesterday."</p>
<p>"No matter. There are other ways of getting at the truth, Miss
Maynard. As I said, Detective Gillett will be down here tomorrow
and I'll show him your statement. He will probably want to
interview you himself and in that case I'll send for you. But don't
you be alarmed&mdash;he's a nice gentlemanly young fellow and knows
how to treat a lady."</p>
<p>He was about to bow her out of the station when he suddenly
remembered that she had not signed her statement.</p>
<p>"Would you please read through this and sign it?" he asked. "A
very important statement&mdash;clear and concise. I feel I must
congratulate you about it, Miss Maynard."</p>
<p>She read through the sergeant's summary of her narrative, but
was unable to congratulate him on the way in which he had done his
work. She felt that the statement she and her lover had compiled,
to guide her in her narrative to the police, was a far more
comprehensive document.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>MISS Maynard's statement made such an impression of Sergeant
Westaway that he determined to ride over to Staveley that afternoon
and lay it before Inspector Murchison. He was so restless and
excited at the new phase of the Cliff Farm murder which had been
opened up by the young lady's revelations that he decided the
matter was too important to be allowed to remain where it was until
Detective Gillett returned to Ashlingsea on the following day.</p>
<p>Besides, twenty-five years' rustication in Ashlingsea had made
him so much of an idealist that he actually believed that any
zealous activity he displayed in the only great crime which had
ever happened during his long régime at Ashlingsea would be placed
to his credit in the official quarters.</p>
<p>After a midday dinner Sergeant Westaway wheeled forth his
bicycle and, having handed over to Constable Heather the official
responsibility of maintaining order in Ashlingsea, pedalled away
along the cliff road to Staveley. The road was level for the
greater part of the way and he reached Staveley in a little more
than an hour of the time of his departure from Ashlingsea.</p>
<p>Several persons&mdash;mostly women&mdash;were in the front
office of the police station, waiting their turn to lay their
troubles before the recognized guide and confidant of Staveley, but
the constable in charge, who knew Sergeant Westaway, deferred to
his official position by taking him straight into the presence of
Inspector Murchison and closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>The inspector was seated in his office chair talking earnestly
to a shabby young woman who carried a baby, and was crying
bitterly. He looked up as Westaway entered, and then he rose from
his chair, as an intimation to the young woman in front of him that
he had given her as much of the Government's time as she had a
right to expect. The young woman took the hint, rose to her feet
and turned to go. On her way to the door she turned round and said
in a pleading voice:</p>
<p>"You'll do the best you can to get him back, won't you,
sir?"</p>
<p>"You can rely on me, Mrs. Richards," responded the inspector,
adding cheerily: "Keep your heart up; things are bound to come
right in the end."</p>
<p>The young woman received this philosophic remark with a sob as
she closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>"A very sad case, that," said Inspector Murchison to Sergeant
Westaway.</p>
<p>"Eh&mdash;yes?" responded the sergeant absently, for he was
thinking of other things.</p>
<p>"She's Fanny Richards, the wife of Tom Richards, the saddler's
son," continued the inspector. "I've known her since she was
<i>that</i> high. Tom Richards was called up for service a little
while ago, and his wife moved heaven and earth to get him exempted.
She went to the right quarters too&mdash;she used to be housemaid
there&mdash;but perhaps I'd better not mention names. At all
events, the tribunal gave her husband total exemption. And what
does her husband do? Is he grateful? Not a bit! Two days after the
tribunal had exempted him the scoundrel cleared
out&mdash;disappeared from the district with a chambermaid from one
of the hotels on the front. I tell you, Westaway, the ingratitude
of some of our sex to the women they have sworn to love and cherish
makes me angry. But, however, you haven't come from Ashlingsea to
discuss the failings of human nature with me. What can I do for
you?"</p>
<p>Before leaving Ashlingsea, Sergeant Westaway had withdrawn Miss
Maynard's statement from its official repository, and placed it
carefully in his pocket-book. His hand wandered towards his breast
pocket as he replied that his visit to Staveley was connected with
the Cliff Farm case.</p>
<p>"And what is the latest news about that?" asked the inspector
with interest.</p>
<p>It was the moment for Sergeant Westaway's triumph, and he slowly
drew his pocket-book from his breast pocket and extracted the
statement.</p>
<p>"I have made an important discovery," he announced, in a voice
which he vainly strove to keep officially calm. "It affects
a&mdash;well-known and leading gentleman of your district. This
paper"&mdash;he flattened it out on the table with a trembling
hand&mdash;"is a statement made by Miss Maynard of Ashlingsea,
which implicates Mr. Marsland, the nephew of Sir George
Granville."</p>
<p>"In the Cliff Farm case?"</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway nodded portentously, and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead&mdash;for the office fire was hot
and he had ridden fast.</p>
<p>Inspector Murchison took up the girl's statement, and read it
through. When he had finished it, he turned to the front page, and
read it through again. Then he glanced up at his colleague
gravely.</p>
<p>"This is very important," he said. "It throws a new aspect on
the case."</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway nodded.</p>
<p>"This girl," pursued Inspector Murchison, "she is of fairly good
position, is she not?"</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway nodded again.</p>
<p>"Her mother is a lady of independent means."</p>
<p>"I've heard of them, and I've seen the young lady and her mother
once or twice when they've visited Staveley. Do you think the young
lady is telling the whole truth here?"</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly." Sergeant Westaway's tone indicated that when a
member of the leading family of Ashlingsea set out to tell the
truth nothing was kept back.</p>
<p>The inspector got up from his chair and took a few turns up and
down the office in a meditative way.</p>
<p>"It's a most extraordinary disclosure that this young woman has
made," he said at length. "Extraordinary&mdash;and awkward. I do
not know what Sir George Granville will say when he learns that his
nephew, instead of assisting the police, made a false and
misleading statement. It is a very grave thing; a very dangerous
thing in such a grave crime as this. It will give Sir George
Granville a dreadful shock."</p>
<p>"It gave me a shock," said Sergeant Westaway.</p>
<p>"No doubt," replied the inspector. "But Sir George
Granville&mdash;is a different matter. We must consider his
feelings; we must try to spare them. I hardly know what is best to
be done. Obviously, the matter cannot be allowed to remain where it
is, yet it is difficult to see what is the proper course of action
to pursue. I think the best thing will be to wait until Gillett
returns from London and leave it to him. When do you expect him
back?"</p>
<p>"I expect him back in the morning. I wired to him that I had
obtained most important information."</p>
<p>"I'll be at the station when the London express comes in in the
morning. If Gillett is on board I'll go on with him to
Ashlingsea."</p>
<p>In accordance with this arrangement, Inspector Murchison arrived
at Ashlingsea in the morning, in the company of Detective
Gillett.</p>
<p>If Sergeant Westaway expected praise from the representative of
Scotland Yard it was not forthcoming. Detective Gillett seemed in a
peevish humour. His boyish face looked tired and careworn, and his
blue eyes were clouded.</p>
<p>"Let me have a look at this statement that you are making such a
fuss about," he said.</p>
<p>Long afterwards, when Sergeant Westaway had ample leisure to go
over all the events in connection with the Cliff Farm case, he
alighted on the conviction that the reason Detective Gillett was so
offensive and abrupt in regard to Miss Maynard's statement was that
he did not like important information to reach the police while he
was absent.</p>
<p>"It is a voluntary and signed statement by Miss Maynard, a young
lady of the district, who was at Cliff Farm the night of the
murder," said the sergeant, with dignity.</p>
<p>"So much I know from Inspector Murchison, and also that the
statement in some way implicates young what's his
name&mdash;Marsland. Let me have the document itself,
Westaway."</p>
<p>The sergeant took it from his desk, and placed it in Detective
Gillett's hands.</p>
<p>"I have added on a separate sheet of paper a few notes I
gathered in the course of conversation with Miss Maynard. The most
important of them deals with the fact that young Marsland was a
captain in the Army, and that Lumsden was under his command in
France."</p>
<p>Gillett began with an air of official weariness to read the
document Westaway had handed to him, but before he had read far the
abstraction vanished from his face, and was replaced by keen
professional interest. He read it closely and carefully, and then
he produced his pocket-book and stowed it away.</p>
<p>"Westaway," he said, "this is a somewhat important contribution
to the case." He paused for a moment and then turned sharply on
Inspector Murchison. "I think you should have told me, Murchison,
how damaging a piece of evidence this is against young
Marsland."</p>
<p>"Not so damaging," said the inspector, in defence. "You see,
young Marsland is Sir George Granville's nephew&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So you told me half a dozen times in the train," said Gillett,
"and as I knew it before I wasn't much impressed with the
information. What I say is that this statement places Marsland in a
very awkward position. He has been deceiving us from first to
last."</p>
<p>"I admit it is very thoughtless&mdash;very foolish of him,"
replied the inspector. "But surely, Gillett, you don't think this
young gentleman had anything to do with the murder?"</p>
<p>"I am not going to be so foolish as to say that it could not
possibly be him who did it. What does he mean by hiding from us the
fact that Lumsden was under his command in France, and that on the
night of the murder he met this girl Maynard at the farm. He seems
to be a young gentleman who keeps back a great deal that the police
ought to know. And I think you will admit, Murchison, that in that
respect he is behaving like a very guilty man."</p>
<p>"But there may be other explanations which will place his
conduct in a reasonable light&mdash;reasonable but foolish," said
the inspector, with an earnest disregard for the way in which these
words contradicted each other. "Sir George Granville himself told
me his nephew was an officer in the Army, but on account of his
nervous breakdown the Army was never mentioned in his presence. And
as for keeping Miss Maynard's name out of his statement after she
had asked him to do so&mdash;why it seems to me the sort of thing
that any young man would do for a pretty girl."</p>
<p>"Especially if it played into his hands. If Marsland committed
the crime, he must have jumped at the chance offered him by Miss
Maynard to keep silence about her presence at the farm, because
that left him a free hand in the statement he made to Westaway. He
had no need to be careful about any part of his statement, because
he had not to harmonize any of it with what she knew about his
presence there."</p>
<p>"And what are you going to do about her statement?" asked the
inspector. "You will confront Marsland with it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but before I do that I am going to make a search of the
farm for clues."</p>
<p>"But you have already done that. Westaway told me that he and
Heather put in two days searching the buildings and the ground
round the house."</p>
<p>"Inspector, you are not quite equal to the demands of the
situation," said the Scotland Yard man patronizingly. "Westaway,
myself and Heather searched the house, the out-buildings and the
grounds for clues&mdash;for traces left behind unwittingly by the
murderer. Our impression then was that the murderer had got away as
soon as he could&mdash;everything pointed to that. But in the light
of this girl's statement we must now search for clues purposely
hidden by the murderer. What was Marsland doing when he went
outside the house and left the key in the door so as to let himself
in again? Hiding something, of course! And where would he hide
it?</p>
<p>"There is only one place we haven't searched, and that is the
well," continued Gillett. "The reason I didn't have it emptied
before was because I was not looking for hidden traces&mdash;the
circumstances of the crime suggested that the murderer had gone off
with the weapon that ended Lumsden's life. But this girl's
statement showed that Marsland went out of the house and came back.
What was he doing while he was outside? This is what I am going to
find out."</p>
<p>"I'll go up to the farm with you," said the inspector. "I want
to see what comes of this. I want to know what I've got to say to
Sir George Granville."</p>
<p>"You've got to say nothing; you leave it to me," said Detective
Gillett. "How long will it take to get the well emptied,
Westaway?"</p>
<p>"Four or five hours ought to be long enough, if I can get a
couple of good men," said the sergeant.</p>
<p>"See about it at once. Send Heather up with the men to
superintend. We will drive out there this afternoon. I have some
inquiries to make in the village this morning, and I must also see
Miss Maynard."</p>
<p>Gillett, after interviewing Miss Maynard and having his lunch
with Inspector Murchison at <i>The Black-Horned Sheep</i>, got into
an antiquated hooded vehicle, drawn by a venerable white horse,
which Sergeant Westaway hired at the inn to take them to Cliff
Farm. The innkeeper, who, like all the rest of the town, was
bursting with curiosity to learn the latest developments in the
case, had eagerly volunteered to drive the police officers up to
the farm, but Sergeant Westaway, determined that village gossip
should learn nothing through him, had resolutely declined the
offer, and drove the equipage himself. They set off with half the
village gaping at them from their doors.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway had intended to ask Detective Gillett for
details concerning his interview with Miss Maynard, but he found
that the sluggish and ancient quadruped between the shafts needed
incessant urging and rein-jerking to keep him moving at all. This
gave him no time for conversation with the detective, who was
seated in the back of the vehicle with Inspector Murchison.</p>
<p>When they reached Cliff Farm Sergeant Westaway found another
problem to engage his attention. A number of Ashlingsea people had
been impelled by curiosity to take a hand in the pumping
operations, until tiring of that mechanical labour, they had
distributed themselves around the farm, strolling about, gazing
vacantly at the farm buildings, or peering through the windows of
the house. Constable Heather, who had been sent up with the
fishermen in order that constituted authority might be represented
in the pumping proceedings, frankly admitted to his superior
officer that he had been unable to keep the curious spectators away
from the scene.</p>
<p>On hearing this, Sergeant Westaway jumped from the vehicle, and
strode into the farmyard with a stern authority which had never
been weakened by convivial friendship at <i>The Black-Horned
Sheep</i>. It says much for the inherent rural respect for law and
order that he was able to turn out the intruders in less than five
minutes, although the majority of them lingered reluctantly outside
the front fence, and watched the proceedings from a distance.</p>
<p>The two fishermen whom Constable Heather had engaged for the
task of emptying the well had, with the ingenuity which
distinguishes those who make their living on the sea, reduced the
undertaking to its simplest elements. A light trench had been dug
on that side of the well where the ground had a gentle slope, and,
following the lie of the land, had been continued until it
connected with one of the main drains of the farm. Therefore, all
that remained for the two fishermen to do was to man the pump in
turns till the well was empty, the water pouring steadily into the
improvised trench and so reaching the main drain, which was
carrying the water away to the ditch beside the road. The
originator of this plan was an elderly man with a round red face, a
moist eye, and an argumentative manner. As the originator of the
labour-saving device, he had exercised the right of superior
intelligence to relegate to his companion most of the hard labour
of carrying it out.</p>
<p>"You see," he said to Inspector Murchison, who happened to be
nearest to him, "Tom here"&mdash;he indicated his
assistant&mdash;"wanted to dig a long trench to yon hedge and carry
the water out into the valley, but I says 'What's the use of going
to all that trouble when it can be done a quicker way?' I says to
Tom, 'Let's put a bit of gumption into it and empty it the easiest
way. For once the water's out of the well, it don't matter a dump
where it runs, for it's no good to nobody.'"</p>
<p>"Very true," said Inspector Murchison, who believed in being
polite to everybody.</p>
<p>"'Therefore,' says I to Tom, 'it stands to reason that the
quickest way to empty the well, and the way with least trouble to
ourselves, will be to cut from here to that there drain
there.'"</p>
<p>"How much longer will you be emptying it?" demanded Detective
Gillett, approaching the well and interrupting the flow of the old
man's eloquence.</p>
<p>"That depends, sir, on what water there's in it."</p>
<p>This reply was too philosophical to appeal to the practical
minded detective. He declared with some sharpness that the sooner
it was emptied the better it would be for everybody.</p>
<p>"We are getting towards the bottom now, sir," said the man at
the pump, who interpreted the detective's words as a promise that
beer would make its appearance when the water had gone. "It ain't a
very deep well, not more than fourteen feet at most, and I should
say another half hour&mdash;maybe more&mdash;would see the end of
this here job."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, be as quick as you can."</p>
<p>The three police officers remained beside the well, watching the
pumping. In a little more than half an hour the flow of water from
the mouth of the pump began to decrease. Then the pump began to
gurgle and the water stopped. Suction had ceased and the well was
practically empty.</p>
<p>Under Detective Gillett's instructions the men who had emptied
the well removed the boards which covered the top, and one of them
went to the barn and returned with a long ladder. Between them they
lowered the ladder into the empty well. The ladder was more than
long enough to reach the bottom, for the top was several feet above
the mouth of the well.</p>
<p>"That will do, men," ordered the Scotland Yard detective. He
climbed to the edge of the well as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Have you a light?" asked Sergeant Westaway in a moment of
inspiration.</p>
<p>For reply Detective Gillett displayed a powerful electric torch,
and placed one foot on the ladder.</p>
<p>"Better take the stable lantern, sir," urged the inventor of the
well-emptying plan. "You'll find it better down there than them
new-fangled lights. You'll be able to see further with a sensible
lantern."</p>
<p>"And you'd better put on my boots," said the other fisherman.
"The well's a bricked 'un, but it'll be main wet and muddy down
there."</p>
<p>Detective Gillett pronounced both ideas excellent and acted on
them. Sergeant Westaway procured the stable lantern, and lighted it
while the detective drew on the fisherman's long sea boots. Thus
equipped, and holding the lantern in his right hand, with an empty
bag over his shoulder, the Scotland Yard man stepped on to the
ladder, and disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway intimated to the fishermen who had emptied the
tank that the work for which they had been engaged was finished;
but it was some minutes before he could make it clear to their slow
intellects that their presence was no longer required. When they
did understand, they were very loath to withdraw, for they had
looked forward with delight to seeing the emptied well yield up
some ghastly secret&mdash;perhaps another murdered body&mdash;and
it was only by the exercise of much sternness that Sergeant
Westaway was able to get them away from the scene by personally
escorting them off the farm and locking the gate after them.</p>
<p>He returned to the well to see Detective Gillett emerging from
it. Gillett was carrying the bag and the lantern in one hand, and
it was obvious that the bag contained something heavy. The
triumphant face of the detective, as he emerged into the upper air,
indicated that he had made some important discovery. He stepped off
the ladder and emptied the contents of the bag on the ground. They
consisted of a heavy pair of boots, hobnailed and iron-shod, such
as are worn by country labourers and farmers, and a five-chambered
revolver. The revolver was rusty through immersion in the water,
and the boots were sodden and pulpy from the same cause.</p>
<p>Inspector Murchison and Sergeant Westaway inspected the articles
in silence. At length the former said:</p>
<p>"This is a very important discovery."</p>
<p>"I would direct your attention to the fact that it is a Webley
revolver&mdash;one of the two patterns approved by the War Office
for Army officers," said Detective Gillett. "Unless I am much
mistaken it is a 4.5&mdash;that is the regulation calibre for the
Army. And I have discovered more than that!"</p>
<p>The police officers ceased looking at the articles on the
ground, and directed their eyes to the Scotland Yard detective in
response to the note of exultation in his voice. In answer to their
look he put his hand into a side pocket and withdrew a small
article which he had wrapped in a handkerchief. Unrolling the
latter carefully, he held up for their inspection a pair of
gold-rimmed eyeglasses.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>"WE have evidence, Captain Marsland, that the statement you made
to Sergeant Westaway regarding your discovery of the dead body of
Frank Lumsden at Cliff Farm on the night of Friday, 16th October,
is untrue."</p>
<p>If Detective Gillett had expected the young man to display
either alarm or resentment at this statement he was disappointed.
Marsland made no outward sign of astonishment at being addressed by
his military title by the detective, or at being accused of having
made a false statement. With steady eyes he met the detective's
searching gaze.</p>
<p>In response to a request telephoned by Detective Gillett to Sir
George Granville's house at Staveley, Marsland and Crewe had
motored over to Ashlingsea police station. They had been met on
their arrival by the detective and Sergeant Westaway, and after a
constrained welcome had been conducted to the Sergeant's inner
room. The door had been carefully closed, and Constable Heather,
who was in the outer room, had been told by his superior that on no
account were they to be disturbed.</p>
<p>There was such a long pause after Detective Gillett had exploded
his bomb, that the obligation of opening up the situation suggested
itself to him.</p>
<p>"Do you deny that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I do not." In a clear tone and without any indication of
embarrassment the young man made his reply.</p>
<p>"You admit that your statement is false?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"What was your object in making a false statement to the
police?"</p>
<p>"I am not prepared to tell you at present."</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps you know your own business best, Captain
Marsland, but I warn you that you are in a very serious position.
It is for you to decide whether the truth will help you or
not."</p>
<p>"Do you intend to make a charge against me?"</p>
<p>Gillett was taken aback at this blunt question. He had arranged
the interview because he believed he was in a position to embarrass
the young man with a veiled threat of police action, but the young
man, instead of waiting for the threats, wanted to know if the
police were prepared to act. But Detective Gillett was too
experienced an officer to display the weakness of his hand.</p>
<p>"I intend to detain you until I have made further inquiries," he
said.</p>
<p>"How long will these inquiries take?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"No one knows better than you, Mr. Crewe, that it is impossible
for me to answer such a question," said the Scotland Yard man. "One
thing leads to another in these cases. As Captain Marsland shows no
disposition to help us, they will take at least three or four
days."</p>
<p>"But perhaps I can help you," suggested Crewe.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know what evidence you have picked up in the
course of your investigations, Mr. Crewe, but I can tell you that
Westaway and I have some evidence that will startle you. Haven't
we, Westaway?"</p>
<p>"Very startling evidence, indeed," said the sergeant, in a proud
official tone.</p>
<p>"I am glad of that," said Crewe. "Perhaps the addition of the
little I have picked up&mdash;that is the addition of whatever part
of it is new to you&mdash;will enable you to solve this puzzling
crime."</p>
<p>"Very likely indeed," said Gillett. "There are not many links
missing in our chain of evidence."</p>
<p>"I congratulate you," responded Crewe. "There are a good many
missing in mine."</p>
<p>Gillett broke into a laugh in which there was a distinct note of
self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>"That is a very candid admission, Mr. Crewe."</p>
<p>"As between you and me why shouldn't there be candour?" said
Crewe. "But what about my young friend Marsland? As it is a case
for candour between you and me, we can't have him present. For my
part, I should prefer that he was present, but of course that is
impossible from your point of view. You cannot go into your case
against him in his presence."</p>
<p>"Certainly not," said Gillett decisively. "And before I produce
my evidence to you, Mr. Crewe, I must have your word of honour not
to tell a living soul, not to breathe a hint of it to any one,
least of all to Captain Marsland. If you give me your word of
honour I'll be satisfied. That is the sort of reputation you have
at Scotland Yard&mdash;if you want to know."</p>
<p>"It is very good of you to talk that way," replied Crewe. "I
give you my word of honour not to speak to any one of what happens
here, until you give me permission to do so. Marsland will wait
outside in charge of Constable Heather. He will give you his word
of honour not to attempt to escape."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" asked Gillett of the young man.</p>
<p>Marsland nodded, and was handed over to Constable Heather's care
by Sergeant Westaway. When the sergeant returned he closed the door
carefully.</p>
<p>"Lock it," said Gillett. "And cover up the keyhole; we don't
want any one peeping through at what we've got here."</p>
<p>"I like this," said Crewe with a smile. "I feel that I am behind
the scenes."</p>
<p>"As regards Captain Marsland," said Gillett after a pause, "I
may as well tell you, Mr. Crewe, that I don't want to deal more
harshly with him than the situation demands&mdash;at this stage.
Things may be very different a little later&mdash;it may be outside
my power to show him any consideration. But I don't want to detain
him here&mdash;I don't want to lock him up if it can be avoided.
You know what talk there would be both here and in Staveley. I am
thinking of his uncle, Sir George Granville. I'll tell you what
I'll do. If he will give me his word of honour that he will not
attempt to escape, and if you and his uncle will do the same, I'll
let him go back to Staveley in charge of Heather. There will be no
difficulty in explaining Heather's presence there to any friends of
Sir George's. What do you think of it?"</p>
<p>"Excellent!" said Crewe.</p>
<p>What was most excellent about it, in the private opinion of
Crewe, was the ingenious way in which it extricated Detective
Gillett from an awkward situation. When he had arranged the
interview for the purpose of frightening Marsland with a threat of
detention, he had had this plan in his mind. He had not quite
sufficient evidence against Marsland to justify him in arresting
that young man without some damaging admissions on the part of the
young man himself. And the plan to place him in charge of Heather
was a technical escape from the difficulties that surrounded
Marsland's actual arrest at that stage; but, on the other hand, it
would appear in the young man's eyes as though he were under arrest
and this was likely to have an important influence in getting some
sort of confession from him.</p>
<p>"Bring out those things," said Detective Gillett to Sergeant
Westaway, and pointing to the cupboard against the wall.</p>
<p>Westaway produced a hand-bag and placed it on the table. Gillett
took a bunch of keys from his trousers pocket and unlocked the
bag.</p>
<p>"First of all, here is the key of the house," he said, as he
held out in the palm of his hand the key of a Yale lock. "As you
must have noticed, Mr. Crewe, the front door of the farmhouse
closes with a modern Yale lock; the old lock is broken and the bolt
is tied back with a string. You will notice, inside the hole for
the key to go on a ring, that there is a stain of blood. Next, we
have a pair of heavy boots. These were worn by the man who murdered
Frank Lumsden, for they correspond exactly with the plaster casts
we took of the footprints outside the window."</p>
<p>Westaway, who had opened the door of the cupboard, placed on the
table near Crewe two plaster casts.</p>
<p>Crewe, after returning the key he had been examining, compared
the boots with the plaster casts.</p>
<p>"I believe you are right," he said, after a pause.</p>
<p>"Here we have the bullet that was fired. As you will remember,
Mr. Crewe, it went clean through Lumsden's body, and through the
window. But what you don't know is that it struck a man who was
hiding in the garden near the window. It struck him in the left
arm."</p>
<p>"Who was this man?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"His name is Tom Jauncey. He is the son of an old shepherd who
worked for Lumsden's grandfather."</p>
<p>"One of the servants who was left a legacy in the old man's
will?" said Crewe inquiringly.</p>
<p>"That is correct," replied Gillett. "From the bullet we go to
the weapon that fired it. Here it is&mdash;an ordinary Webley
revolver such as is issued to army officers, Mr. Crewe."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know a little about them," said Crewe, as he took it in
his hands to look at it.</p>
<p>"And, last of all, here is a pair of glasses which we have
ascertained came from the well-known optical firm of Baker &amp;
Co., who have branches all over London, and were made for Captain
Marsland."</p>
<p>"Where did you find them?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"In the well at the farm."</p>
<p>"How did they get there?"</p>
<p>"I don't think it is an unnatural assumption that they were
blown off when the wearer was stooping over the well to drop some
articles into it. Remember that there was a big storm and a high
wind on the night of the murder. The boots and the revolver we also
found in the well. Our theory is that the murderer dropped these
things into the well in order to get rid of them, and that while he
was doing it his glasses were blown into the well. As you know,
Marsland wears glasses&mdash;he is wearing them now. But Sergeant
Westaway will swear that he was not wearing them when he came to
the station to report the discovery of the body. We have other
interesting evidence in the same direction, but let that go for the
present."</p>
<p>"But the boots," said Crewe. "You don't pretend that they belong
to Marsland?"</p>
<p>"They probably belonged to the murdered man&mdash;that is a
point which we have not yet settled."</p>
<p>"And how does that fit in with your theory that the murderer
broke into the house?"</p>
<p>"The murderer found these boots in the barn, the cowshed, or one
of the other outbuildings. Lumsden did not wear such heavy boots
habitually&mdash;remember that he had been a clerk, not a farmer.
But he would want a heavy pair of boots like these for walking
about the farm-yard in wet weather, and probably he kept them in
one of the outbuildings, or at any rate left them there on the last
occasion he wore them. The intending murderer, prowling about the
outbuildings before breaking into the house, found these boots, and
with the object of hiding his traces put them on. After he had
finished with them he put on his own boots and threw these down the
well."</p>
<p>"And your theory is that Marsland is the murderer?"</p>
<p>"I don't say that our case against him is quite complete yet,
but the evidence against him is very strong."</p>
<p>"Can you suggest any motive?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Marsland was a captain in the London Rifle Brigade;
Lumsden was a private in the same battalion. They served together
in France."</p>
<p>"But the motive?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Our information is that Lumsden and a man against whom Captain
Marsland had a personal grudge&mdash;a man whom it was his interest
to get out of the way&mdash;were sent by Captain Marsland on a
false mission towards the German lines. Marsland expected that both
would fall victims to the Germans. Lumsden's companion was killed,
but Lumsden was captured alive and subsequently escaped. What is
more likely than that Marsland, riding across the downs, should
call in at Cliff Farm when his horse fell lame. There, to his
surprise, he found that Lumsden was the owner of the farm. They
talked over old times, and Marsland learned that Lumsden was aware
of his secret motive in sending them on such a dangerous mission.
Marsland took his leave, but determined to put Lumsden out of the
way. He stole back and hid in the outbuildings, broke into the
house, and shot the man who could expose him."</p>
<p>"A very ingenious piece of work," said Crewe. "Everything
dovetails in."</p>
<p>"I am glad you agree with it," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"But I don't," was the unexpected reply. "Lumsden was not
murdered at the farm. He was shot in the open, somewhere between
Staveley and Ashlingsea, and his dead body was brought into the
house in a motor-car. It could not have been Marsland who brought
the dead body there, because he was on horseback, and his lamed
horse was in the stable at the farm when we were all there next
day."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>"YOU are on the wrong track, Mr. Crewe," said Gillett, who was
determined not to part with the theory he had built up round the
evidence he had collected. "I was positive the murder took place in
the house. This man Jauncey, whom I mentioned, can swear that he
heard a shot fired. And more than that, he can swear that he was
hit by the bullet. This is the bullet that was extracted from his
wound in the left arm. It fits this revolver."</p>
<p>"My dear Gillett, I don't dispute any of these things," said
Crewe. "They merely support my contention that the murder was not
committed at the farm, but that the body was brought there, and
that the man who took the body there took certain steps with the
object of creating the impression that the tragedy took place in
the room in which the body was found."</p>
<p>"What evidence have you of that?" asked Sergeant Westaway,
coming to the aid of his official superior.</p>
<p>"The bullet that killed Lumsden went clear through his
body&mdash;so much was decided at the post-mortem examination,"
Crewe said. "But that fact was also evident from a cursory
examination of the body, as we saw it in the chair. You will
remember that I drew attention to the fact when we were looking at
the body. Your theory is that the shot was fired as Lumsden was
standing at the window, with his back towards his murderer, that
the bullet went through him, through the window, and lodged in the
arm of this man Jauncey who stated he was outside in the garden.
But the course of the bullet through Lumsden's body was slightly
upward. How in that case could it strike downward and wound a man
on the ground ten or twelve feet below the windows on the first
story?"</p>
<p>"The bullet might have been deflected by the glass of the
window," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"It might have been, but it is highly improbable that ordinary
window-glass would deflect a bullet&mdash;even a spent one. In any
case this bullet hit the cherry-tree outside the window before
hitting Jauncey. You will find that it cut the bark of the
cherry-tree&mdash;the mark is 4 ft. 4-1/2 inches from the
ground."</p>
<p>"Then it was the cherry-tree that deflected it?" said Sergeant
Westaway.</p>
<p>"Yes and no," said Crewe. "Certainly its course was deflected
downwards after hitting the cherry-tree&mdash;I assume that Jauncey
was close to the tree. But if it had not been travelling downwards,
it would have hit the tree much higher up&mdash;somewhere near the
level of the window. The bullet that hit Jauncey was fired in the
room in which we saw the body, but it was fired by the man who took
the body to the farm, with the intention of giving the impression
that the crime took place there. Knowing that the bullet which
killed Lumsden had gone through his body, he placed the body in a
chair near the window and then fired a shot through the window. He
made the mistake of going close up to the window to fire, and as a
result he fired downwards instead of on a level at the height of
the wound in Lumsden's body."</p>
<p>"If that is all you have to support your theory&mdash;" began
Detective Gillett.</p>
<p>"It isn't all," said Crewe, with a slight indication of
impatience. "It is only my first point. You will recall that on the
stairs there were indications that a wet rag had been used for
wiping away some traces or stains. Inspector Payne suggested that
the rag had been used to wipe away muddy boot-marks on the
stairs&mdash;the traces of these boots. These boots were not worn
by the man as he went upstairs; he put them on afterwards.
Presently I will tell you why he did. But the marks on the stairs
were not the marks of muddy boots. They were stains of blood which
dropped from the dead man's wound, as his body was carried
upstairs. These marks are in the hall leading to the stairs and on
the landing leading to the room in which the body was placed. In
the room itself no attempt to remove the blood-stains was made,
because they were an indication that the shooting took place there.
If he had been aware that there was a stain of blood on the
latch-key which he took from the dead man's pocket, he would have
washed it away."</p>
<p>"If he had possession of the key in order to get the body into
the house in the way you state, Mr. Crewe, why did he break into
the house? Remember one of the downstairs windows was forced."</p>
<p>"It was forced by the man who took the body there. But he forced
it in breaking out of the house&mdash;not in breaking into it. He
wanted to give the impression that some one had broken into the
house, but he was pressed for time&mdash;he was anxious to get
away. In searching for a rag in the kitchen with which to wipe out
the bloodstains, he saw these boots. They belonged to Lumsden, as
you have said, but it was more likely that Lumsden kept them in the
kitchen than in the barn or cowshed. This man&mdash;let us call him
the murderer&mdash;saw in the boots a means of averting suspicion
from himself. He decided to leave clues that would suggest that the
murderer broke into the house. But, instead of going out of the
front door and breaking into the house, he forced the window from
inside the room. Then, with these boots on, he climbed out of the
window backwards, and when he reached the ground he walked
backwards across the garden bed to the path in order to give the
impression that some one had walked forwards across the bed to the
window.</p>
<p>"You saw from the sash of the window that the catch had been
forced back by a knife, but apparently you overlooked the fact that
the marks of the knife are much broader at the top, where the catch
is, than at the bottom, where the knife would enter if the catch
had been forced by some one outside. It was at the top, near the
catch, and not at the bottom below it, that the knife was inserted;
that is to say, the knife was used by some one inside the room. The
footprints outside the window showed that they were made by a
person walking backwards; the impression from the toe to the ball
of the foot being very distinct and the rest of the foot
indistinct. A person in walking backwards puts down his toes first,
and gradually brings the rest of his foot down; a person walking
forwards puts his heel down first and then puts down the rest of
his foot as he brings his weight forward. Our man, having made his
way to the garden path from the window, walked along the path to
the motor-car at the gate, probably carrying his own boots in his
hand. As soon as he entered his car he drove off along the road in
the direction of Staveley with the lights out. He took a risk in
travelling in the dark, and in spite of the fact that he knew the
road well he came to grief before he reached Staveley."</p>
<p>"How do you know all this?" asked Gillett. "How do you know he
had a car?" He had not given up his own theory in favour of
Crewe's, but he realized that Crewe's theory was the more striking
one.</p>
<p>"In Marsland's statement he said that his horse swerved from
something in the dark as he was coming down the Cliff road, and
fell lame," said Crewe. "The horse shied at the motor-car as it
passed. Marsland neither saw nor heard the car because of the
darkness, intensified by the storm, and because of the roar of the
wind and waves."</p>
<p>"You don't really expect us to regard the swerving of the horse
as proof there was a motor-car there?" demanded Gillett, with a
superior smile.</p>
<p>"Contributory proof," said Crewe. "If you went along the cliff
road, as I did on leaving the farm after meeting you there, you
would have noticed that the danger post nearest the farm was out of
the perpendicular. That was not the case previous to the night of
the storm. This motor-car without lights bumped into it. The mark
of the wheels where the car had left the road was quite plain when
I looked&mdash;it had not been obliterated by the rain. Four miles
away the car was run into the ditch and overturned. I saw it as Sir
George Granville and I drove along to Cliff Farm on Saturday
morning. If you want information concerning it and the person who
drove it you can obtain it at Gosford's garage at Staveley. The car
was hired from Gosford."</p>
<p>"By whom?" asked Gillett.</p>
<p>"By a man named Arnold Brett, who was a very close friend of the
dead man."</p>
<p>"I know all about Brett from Inspector Murchison," said Gillett.
"He rang me up about him and promised to let me know when he came
back to his lodgings at Staveley. He said that Brett was a close
friend of Lumsden's, and would probably be able to give us some
useful information when he returns."</p>
<p>"When will he return?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"You think he has cleared out?" suggested Gillett.</p>
<p>"I'm sure of it," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Murchison gave the impression that he was sure to come
back&mdash;that he had left Staveley the day before the murder. I
understood from Murchison that Brett is doing some secret service
work for the Government, and that it was quite a regular thing for
him to disappear suddenly."</p>
<p>"No doubt it was," said Crewe. "But this time he is not coming
back."</p>
<p>"I'll ring up Murchison," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"Don't waste your time," was Crewe's reply. "Murchison is an
excellent fellow&mdash;an ideal police official for a quiet seaside
place where nothing happens, but too genial and unsuspecting for an
emergency of this kind. Go and see Brett's apartments at
Staveley&mdash;No. 41 Whitethorn Gardens&mdash;and the landlady,
Mrs. Penfield, will tell you as she told Murchison, and as she told
me also, that Brett left Staveley on secret service work on
Thursday morning, 15th October, and that she expects him back at
any moment. But go to Gosford and he will show you the car that
Brett hired on Friday.</p>
<p>"He will tell you that on Saturday about midday Brett rang him
up&mdash;from Lewes, Gosford says, but it was more probably from
Marlingsea, on his way to London&mdash;and told him that he had met
with an accident with the car, and that it was lying in the ditch
on the side of the road about six miles out from Staveley on the
road to this place. It was there that Gosford's foreman found the
car when he went for it. If Brett hired a car at Staveley on Friday
he couldn't have left Staveley on Thursday, as his landlady says.
She doesn't know what to think in regard to this murder, but she is
ready to shield Brett all she can because she is in love with
him."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>"I must say that I feel very grateful to you, Mr. Crewe," said
Detective Gillett after a pause. "You have certainly got hold of
some facts of which I was not aware. And your deductions are most
interesting. What do you say, Westaway?"</p>
<p>"Most interesting," said the sergeant. "I had heard a lot of Mr.
Crewe before I met him, but I'd like to say that it's a great
privilege to listen to his deductions."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't go so far as to accept his theory and abandon my
own," interposed Gillett hurriedly. "To my mind there is truth in
both of them, and the whole truth will probably be found in a
judicious combination of both."</p>
<p>Crewe could scarcely hide his impatience at Gillett's obstinacy,
and his determination to claim at least an equal share in solving
the mystery.</p>
<p>"My dear Gillett," he said, "let us abandon theories and keep to
facts. The great danger in our work is in fitting facts to theories
instead of letting the facts speak for themselves. If you still
think you have a case against Marsland, let us go into it. It is no
part of my work to prove Marsland innocent if he is guilty; I have
no object in proving Brett guilty if he is innocent. But as the
guest of Sir George Granville, I want to save him and his nephew
unnecessary distress and anxiety. By a full and frank discussion we
can decide as man to man whether there is any real case for
Marsland to answer. I admit that you have justification for some
suspicions in regard to him, but let us see if the fog of suspicion
cannot be cleared away by a discussion of the facts."</p>
<p>"It will take a great deal to convince me that he doesn't know
more about this tragedy than he has told us," said Gillett
doggedly.</p>
<p>"But are we to find him guilty merely because he chooses to keep
silence on certain points?"</p>
<p>"What is his object in keeping silence? What was his object in
making a false statement? What is his object in putting obstacles
in our way? Is that the conduct of an innocent man?"</p>
<p>"It is not the conduct of a man anxious to help the police to
the utmost of his power without regard to consequences," said
Crewe. "But there is a wide gulf between being guilty of keeping
something back and being guilty of murder."</p>
<p>"When the thing kept back suggests a motive for getting the man
who was murdered out of the way, it is natural to see a connection
between the two," returned Gillett.</p>
<p>"And what was the thing that Marsland kept back?"</p>
<p>"He kept back that he was an officer in the army&mdash;Captain
in the London Rifle Brigade. He kept back that this man Lumsden was
a private in his company."</p>
<p>"But the discovery of these things did not present any great
difficulty to a police official of your resources, Gillett."</p>
<p>"No, they did not," the detective admitted. "But we should have
been told of them in the first place."</p>
<p>"True. But listen to the explanation why you were not told.
Marsland has been an invalid for some months. He was invalided out
of the army because of wounds and nervous shock. He broke down as
many others have broken down, under a long experience of the awful
horrors of the front. In order to assist in his recovery the
doctors ordered that as far as possible his mind should be kept
from dwelling on the war. For this reason the war is never
mentioned in his presence by those who know of his nervous
condition. He is never addressed by them as an army officer, but as
a civilian."</p>
<p>"All that is very interesting, Mr. Crewe, but it does not
dispose of the information in our possession. You see, the
circumstances in which Captain Marsland came into this affair were
so very extraordinary, that he might well have told Westaway the
truth about the military connection between himself and Lumsden. It
was an occasion when the whole truth should have been told. We
could not have been long in learning from his relatives that he was
suffering from nervous shock, and we would have shown him every
consideration."</p>
<p>"That is an excellent piece of special pleading," said Crewe.
"But you do not take into consideration the fact that the evasion
of everything that dealt with the Army, and particularly with his
old regiment, has become a habit with Marsland."</p>
<p>"Our information," said Gillett slowly and impressively, "is
that he believed Lumsden was dead&mdash;that he had been killed in
France. That in his capacity as an officer he sent Lumsden and
another man to their death. He had a grudge against this other man.
Lumsden's companion was killed but Lumsden was taken prisoner and
subsequently escaped. If that is correct, it supplies a strong
motive for getting Lumsden out of the way when he discovered that
Lumsden was alive and in England."</p>
<p>"When did Marsland make this discovery?"</p>
<p>"That I don't know. But he could easily have made it and
obtained Lumsden's address from the headquarters of the London
Rifle Brigade."</p>
<p>"Did he make such inquiries there?"</p>
<p>"I have not obtained positive proof that he did. But as a
retired officer of the Brigade, who knows his way about their
headquarters, he could do it for himself in a way that would leave
no proof."</p>
<p>"Who was the man that Marsland sent out on a mission of death
with Lumsden?"</p>
<p>"I haven't got the name."</p>
<p>"Can't you get it?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid not. It is not a thing one could get from the
regimental records."</p>
<p>"But cannot you get it from your informant&mdash;from the person
who is your authority for the story?"</p>
<p>"Not very well."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"Our informant is anonymous. He sent me a letter."</p>
<p>"And since when have you begun to place implicit faith in
anonymous letters, my dear Gillett?"</p>
<p>The detective flushed under this gentle irony. "I don't place
implicit faith in it. But it fits in with other information in our
possession. And you ought to know better than to despise anonymous
information, Mr. Crewe. It is not difficult to conceive
circumstances in which a man is willing to give the police very
valuable information, but will not come into the open to do
it."</p>
<p>"But it is even less difficult," replied Crewe, "to conceive
circumstances in which a man tries to divert suspicion from himself
by directing the attentions of the police to some one else by means
of an anonymous letter."</p>
<p>"I haven't overlooked that," said Gillet confidently.</p>
<p>"And this anonymous communication fits in with other information
in your possession&mdash;other information that you have received
from Miss Maynard?" Crewe looked steadily at Gillett, and then
turned his gaze on Westaway.</p>
<p>"So, you know about her?" was Gillett's comment.</p>
<p>"She did me the honour of asking my advice when I met her two
days ago at Cliff Farm."</p>
<p>"What was she doing there?"</p>
<p>"Didn't she tell you?"</p>
<p>"She did not."</p>
<p>"I understood from her that it was her firm determination to
tell you everything&mdash;to take you fully into her confidence,
and throw all the light she could on the tragedy."</p>
<p>"She told us that she was at the farm the night Captain Marsland
was there," said Gillett. "She sought shelter there from the storm
and went upstairs with Captain Marsland when the body was
discovered. He said nothing whatever about this in his statement to
Westaway."</p>
<p>"Nothing whatever," said Westaway. "He led me to believe he was
entirely and absolutely alone."</p>
<p>"But why didn't she come to the police station that night and
make her own statement?" asked Crewe. "Why all this delay?"</p>
<p>"Her first impulse was to keep her name out of it because of the
way people would talk," said Sergeant Westaway, who, as an old
resident of Ashlingsea, felt better qualified than Detective
Gillett to interpret the mental process of one of the inhabitants
of the little town.</p>
<p>"And so she asked Marsland to say nothing about her presence at
the farm?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"She admits that," was Westaway's reply.</p>
<p>"Of course she had to admit it in order to clear the way for a
statement implicating Marsland in the crime," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"That was not her motive. After thinking over all that happened,
she decided that by shielding herself from idle gossip she might be
helping unconsciously to shield the murderer."</p>
<p>"And she told you everything," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"Everything," said Sergeant Westaway emphatically.</p>
<p>"She told you why she was waiting at the farm on the night that
Lumsden's dead body was brought there?"</p>
<p>"She went there for shelter from the storm," explained the
confident sergeant. "That would be after the body was brought
there&mdash;if your theory is correct, Mr. Crewe; and after he was
shot in the house&mdash;if our theory is correct. Our theory is
that Captain Marsland, after committing the crime, went outside the
house to hide the traces of it&mdash;probably to get rid of these
boots and revolver, which he threw down the well."</p>
<p>"It hasn't occurred to you, sergeant, that these things may have
been placed in the well within the last few days in order that you
might find them there?" said Crewe.</p>
<p>"Who would place them there?" asked Gillett coming to the rescue
of the sergeant with a poser.</p>
<p>"I think you asked me just now what Miss Maynard was doing at
the farm two days ago," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"And you think that there may be some connection between her
visit there and these things?"</p>
<p>"With all due deference to the sergeant as a judge of character,
and particularly of the feminine character, I am quite convinced
that she has not told you everything."</p>
<p>"Can you tell us anything she is keeping back?"</p>
<p>"She is keeping back the real reason why she went to Cliff Farm
on the night the body was taken there."</p>
<p>"You do not think she went there to shelter from the storm?"</p>
<p>"She had an appointment there," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"With whom?" asked Gillett breathlessly.</p>
<p>"With Brett&mdash;the man to whom she is engaged."</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed Gillett.</p>
<p>"Surely she explained to you the nature of her relations with
Brett?" said Crewe maliciously. "Except in regard to Marsland she
does not seem to have taken you into her confidence at all."</p>
<p>"She may be playing a deep game," said Gillett, in a tone which
indicated that although an attempt might be made to hoodwink them,
it was not likely to prove successful.</p>
<p>"I think you will find that she is a very clever young woman,"
was Crewe's comment.</p>
<p>"What was the nature of her appointment at Cliff Farm with
Brett? Why not meet him at Ashlingsea or at Staveley?" asked
Gillett.</p>
<p>"As to the nature of the appointment, I will refer you for full
details to Mrs. Grange. You know her, sergeant, of course?" Crewe
said, turning to Westaway.</p>
<p>"The dwarf woman at Staveley?" asked the sergeant.</p>
<p>"Yes. If I am not much mistaken Grange and his wife were in the
vicinity of Cliff Farm when the dead body of the owner was brought
there. What part they played in the tragedy I must leave you to
find out from them. I am not certain myself of their part, but I
have a fairly clear idea. You can let me know what admission you
get from them. Before they admit anything it may be necessary to
frighten them with arrest, Gillett. But I don't suppose you mind
doing that?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least," replied Gillett with a smile that was free
from embarrassment. "But what evidence can I produce to show that I
know they know all about Miss Maynard's presence at the farm? What
evidence is there that this man and his wife were anywhere in the
neighbourhood of the place?"</p>
<p>"They went over in the afternoon of October both in a motor-boat
in charge of a boatman at Staveley, who is called Pedro, and wears
a scarlet cloak. Murchison told me that Pedro is the father of Mrs.
Grange, the dwarf woman&mdash;they are Italians. But Grange, the
husband, is an Englishman. He keeps a second-hand bookshop in
Curzon Street, at Staveley, and lives over the shop with his wife.
Is that not so, Westaway?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. That is quite correct."</p>
<p>"They reached the landing-place at the foot of the cliffs, near
the farm, before there was any appearance of the storm. The next
morning, as I was descending the cliff by the secret path, I found
an old felt hat on the rocks just before Pedro, who had come over
in his boat to look for it, reached the place. My impression is
that the hat belonged to Grange, and was blown off as he was
descending the cliff by the path when the storm was abating. If it
had been blown off in the afternoon, while he was ascending the
cliff in daylight, he could have recovered it without much
difficulty. The fact that he left it behind indicates that it was
blown off in the dark and that he was too excited and upset to hunt
for it. But on reaching Staveley in Pedro's boat, after the storm
had abated, he began to think that his old hat was a dangerous
object to leave about in the vicinity of a house where there was
the body of a murdered man awaiting discovery by the police, so he
sent Pedro back to the landing-place to recover the hat."</p>
<p>"But, hang it all, Crewe! Some of your reasoning about the hat
is merely surmise. You say it was blown off while Grange was
descending the cliff path. How do you arrive at that conclusion? It
might have been blown off at any time&mdash;while he was crossing
to the farm, or standing on the cliffs."</p>
<p>"No," replied Crewe. "The gale was blowing in from the sea, and
if Grange's hat had blown off while he was on the cliffs it would
have blown inward&mdash;that is, across the downs."</p>
<p>Detective Gillett nodded.</p>
<p>"I overlooked that point," he said. "Have you possession of the
hat now?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You can have it if you call for it at Sir George
Granville's, on your way to interview Grange this afternoon or
to-morrow. But the Granges know that I have the hat. I went there
with it just to convince myself that Grange did own it."</p>
<p>"Did he admit that it was his?"</p>
<p>"He denied it. But he is not a good hand at dissimulation. I
offered to hand over the hat to him in exchange for a truthful
account of all he and his wife knew about the tragedy, but the
offer was not entertained. They denied that they were there at
all."</p>
<p>"I'll soon get them to alter that tune!" exclaimed the
resourceful Gillett. "I will put the screw on this man in the
scarlet cloak until I squeeze something out of him."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you will have a slight difficulty in making Pedro
reveal anything," said Crewe. "He is deaf and dumb."</p>
<p>Gillett looked somewhat confused at finding that his impetuous
confidence had carried him beyond his resources.</p>
<p>"That is unfortunate," he said.</p>
<p>"It is of no consequence," returned Crewe, "for you have
evidence in your possession that Mrs. Grange was inside the
farmhouse. The comb you found in the sitting-room downstairs
belongs to her. When I went to see her she was wearing one exactly
similar to it. Apparently she had two of them. And she does not
know where she lost the one the police have, or she would not wear
its fellow."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>DINNER was just over at Sir George Granville's house, and Crewe,
on hearing that Detective Gillett and Sergeant Westaway had called
to see him, took them into the library at his host's
suggestion.</p>
<p>"I have seen Grange and his wife, and also Mrs. Penfield," said
Gillett.</p>
<p>"And what did you get from them?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"A great deal of interesting information&mdash;and most of it
bearing out your theory, Mr. Crewe. I must say that this crime has
more twists and turns than any I have ever had anything to do
with."</p>
<p>"I formed the impression some time ago that it was a complicated
and interesting case," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"And I want to say, Mr. Crewe, that you have been a great help
to us. If it wasn't for you we shouldn't have got on the right
track so soon, should we, sergeant?"</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway, who was not very quick at arriving at
conclusions, had discovered that Detective Gillett was generally
ready to call him to official comradeship in the mistakes that had
been made, but less disposed to give him an equal share in any
success achieved. He nodded in silent acquiescence with the
admission that they owed something to Crewe.</p>
<p>"And whom did you see first?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"I went to the garage first to learn about the motor-car Brett
hired," said Gillett. "I had a look at their books, and found that
he had the car on Friday afternoon. Gosford will not only swear by
his books, but he remembers quite distinctly that it was on Friday
that Brett had the car. As he told you, the next thing he heard of
it was that it was lying in the ditch about six miles away. He says
Brett, when telephoning, said he was speaking from Lewes&mdash;but
that is probably a lie. As Brett was making his escape he would not
be likely to say where he was. But I can easily find out from the
telephone exchange where the call came from. It was a trunk call,
and the only trunk call Gosford received that day, so there will be
no difficulty in getting it from the records of the exchange. Then
I went to Brett's lodgings in Whitethorn Gardens. This woman, Mrs.
Penfield, tried to bluff me&mdash;she said she was certain that
Brett had left on Thursday, and that Gosford was mistaken in
thinking Brett had the car on Friday. But, when I threatened to
arrest her for being an accessory, she broke down and admitted that
Brett left her place after lunch on Friday to drive to Cliff Farm,
and that she has not seen or heard of him since."</p>
<p>"Not seen or heard of him?" echoed Crewe meditatively.</p>
<p>"By this time I felt that I was getting on," continued Detective
Gillett.</p>
<p>Sergeant Westaway nodded to himself in sour depression at the
deliberate exclusion of himself from the story of progress.</p>
<p>"I next called at Grange's shop. Westaway showed me the
place."</p>
<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the sergeant, as if he were in pain.</p>
<p>"I explained to Grange who I was, and he nearly fell through the
floor with fright. I saw there would not be much difficulty in
dealing with him. But the ugly little dwarf upstairs was a
different proposition. She protested that she and her husband knew
nothing about Cliff Farm, or what had happened there. Even when I
produced the hat you gave me she would not give in. But when I
produced the comb&mdash;it is exactly similar to the one she was
wearing&mdash;it made an impression, and then when I followed that
up with a threat to arrest them both&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah!" interrupted Crewe with a smile, "that is where you
Scotland Yard men have the advantage. And I must say that you don't
neglect to use it on every occasion. If I could only threaten
people with arrest I should be able to surmount many of the
difficulties which confront me from time to time."</p>
<p>"It is a good card," admitted Detective Gillett, with the pride
of a man who holds a strong hand which he has dealt himself. "It
enabled me to get their story out of them, and a most interesting
story it is."</p>
<p>"I thought it would be," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"The body was brought to the farm by Brett. Grange and his wife
were in the house when he carried it upstairs."</p>
<p>"But did Brett know they were there?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"He did not; he never suspected there was anybody in the house.
They hid on the top floor."</p>
<p>"And they were there when Miss Maynard came after Brett had
gone," said Crewe, pursuing a train of thought. "They were there
when Marsland and she went up to the first floor and discovered the
body. It was Grange who knocked over the picture at the top of the
staircase, and caused the noise which alarmed Marsland and Miss
Maynard."</p>
<p>"Right," said Gillett. "You seem to know the whole story; it is
not worth while for me to go over it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes it is. If you got the whole truth out of that little
dwarf and her husband, you will be able to fill in for me some
blanks in my reconstruction of the crime."</p>
<p>Detective Gillett was mollified by the assurance that he had in
his possession some information which was new to Crewe, and he
resumed his story with interest:</p>
<p>"What do you think took the Granges over to the farm? It was to
hold a séance there with the object of finding where old
grandfather Lumsden had hidden his money. Young Lumsden had heard
from Murchison something about the dwarf's psychic powers, and in
company with Brett he went to see her. First of all they produced
the cryptogram old Lumsden had left behind, and asked Grange if he
knew anything about cryptograms or could get them a book on how to
solve them. Grange couldn't help them there, and from that the
conversation turned to spiritualism, and one of them&mdash;probably
Brett&mdash;suggested that Mrs. Grange should try to solve the
cryptogram by getting into communication with the spirit of old
Lumsden and asking him where he had hidden the money. A splendid
idea, don't you think, Mr. Crewe?"</p>
<p>"Excellent!"</p>
<p>"There is nothing in this spiritualistic business," said
Sergeant Westaway, with official certainty. "No good ever comes of
those who dabble in it&mdash;I've seen cases of the kind at
Ashlingsea. We had a sort of medium there once, but I managed to
clear her out, after a lot of trouble."</p>
<p>"Once spiritualism gets into good working order there will be no
work for police or detectives, sergeant," said Crewe. "The mediums
will save all the trouble of collecting evidence."</p>
<p>"I don't believe in it at all; it is nothing but fraud and
deception," returned Sergeant Westaway.</p>
<p>"Here is the cryptogram," said Detective Gillett.</p>
<p>He held out to Crewe a sheet of paper which he took from his
pocket-book.</p>

<br></p>
<p>"A curious document!" said Crewe, examining it intently.</p>
<p>"I got it from the dwarf woman," said Gillett. "She had it
hidden away in her sitting-room."</p>
<p>"I suppose she didn't want to part with it?"</p>
<p>"She did not. But when I threatened to arrest&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, I can honestly congratulate you on getting it," said
Crewe. "I have been very anxious to see it. This is the cryptogram
that Marsland found on the stairs, and subsequently disappeared
from the house. Mrs. Grange secured it before she left the house,
after the departure of Marsland and Miss Maynard."</p>
<p>"That is what I thought, but the dwarf says, 'No.' She says that
this is the original cryptogram, and that she got it from young
Lumsden in order to study it before holding a séance. Lumsden would
not part with it until he had made a copy, in case anything
happened to the original. Mrs. Grange took the original with her
over to Cliff Farm, but it has never been out of her possession
since Lumsden gave it to her. She did not see the copy Lumsden
made; she did not see it at the house, and does not know what
became of it. However, the copy is of no consequence."</p>
<p>"Oh, isn't it?" said Crewe. "I would like to know where it went.
The cryptogram can be solved just as well from the copy as the
original."</p>
<p>"It probably got blown away and destroyed," said Detective
Gillett. "There was a high wind that night."</p>
<p>"You might leave this with me for a day or two," said Crewe,
looking at the cryptogram earnestly. "I take an interest in
cryptograms."</p>
<p>"You must take great care of it," Detective Gillett replied. "I
shall want to produce it as evidence at the trial."</p>
<p>"When you get Brett?"</p>
<p>"Yes. And now let us get back to my story. It was arranged that
a séance should be held at the farm on Friday, October 16th."</p>
<p>"Who was to be there?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"Grange and his wife, Lumsden, Brett and Miss Maynard. This
young lady has been playing a deep game, as you suggested. I will
settle with her tomorrow."</p>
<p>"And this man, Tom Jauncey, who was shot in the arm, wasn't he
one of the party?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I thought he might be there to represent the unpaid legatees,"
said Crewe.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that he knew about the séance&mdash;that he had
heard Brett and Miss Maynard talking about it. Brett was in the
habit of visiting the young lady at her home. No doubt Jauncey went
out to the farm in order to learn what happened, and see if the
money was found."</p>
<p>"That is much more likely than that he went there to dig in the
garden."</p>
<p>"Let me reconstruct the crime for you, Mr. Crewe. I have got all
the threads," said Detective Gillett eagerly. "The séance was to
take place at 6 p.m. on Friday. The dwarf and her husband went over
to the place in the afternoon in the motor-boat belonging to old
Pedro. They climbed the cliff, and on reaching the farm found that
there was no one about, but that the front door was not locked.
Lumsden had gone for a walk along the Staveley road to meet Brett,
who was to motor over, and he had left the door unlocked, so that,
if any of his guests arrived during his absence, they could enter
the house and make themselves at home. He was not afraid of thieves
going there, for very few people travel along that road on foot.
That was the arrangement he had made with the Granges.</p>
<p>"They entered the house, and had a look round the old place. No
doubt it occurred to them that if they were thoroughly acquainted
with the rooms, and all the nooks and crannies, they would be able
to give a more impressive séance. And perhaps they had an idea that
in searching round they might find the money without the assistance
of the former owner's spirit, in which case, I have no doubt, they
would have helped themselves. They had reached the house about 5
o'clock, and they had not been there half an hour before the storm
began to burst, and it got dark.</p>
<p>"It was probably the noise of the rising wind which prevented
them hearing Brett's motor-car, and the first intimation they had
that any one had arrived was hearing the front door open. They had
closed it when they entered the house, their object being to
examine the rooms undisturbed. Brett, thinking there was no one in
the house, opened the door with Lumsden's key. The Granges who were
on the top floor did not call out to him, as they had no
satisfactory explanation to offer for exploring the house. They saw
Brett staggering up the stairs carrying something on his left
shoulder. At first they could not make out what it was, as it was
dark inside the house. Half-way up the stairs Brett came to a halt
to shift his burden, and he turned on an electric torch in order to
see where he was. By the light of the torch the Granges saw that
Brett was carrying the body of a man. They thought at first that
Lumsden had been injured in an accident to the motor-car, but the
fact that they heard no voices subsequently&mdash;that Brett did
not speak aloud&mdash;convinces me that you were right, and that
Lumsden was dead.</p>
<p>"Brett entered the room on the left of the stairs on the first
floor, and was there some minutes&mdash;probably getting Lumsden's
pocket-book, and disarranging the papers it contained in the way we
saw. Then he went downstairs, and a few moments later the little
dwarf, who was leaning over the staircase, saw him moving about
below, with the torch in one hand and a bucket in the other. He
began washing away the stains of blood in the hall, and on the
staircase. He came up the stairs one by one with his bucket and
torch, searching for blood-stains, and swabbing them with the cloth
whenever he found them. After cleaning the stairs and landing in
this way, he went downstairs with the bucket. A minute later he
came back to the room which he had first entered, and immediately
afterwards they heard a shot. This was the shot fired through the
window. No doubt the bullet hit the cherry-tree, and then struck
Jauncey in the arm. It seems a strange thing that Jauncey knew
nothing about the motor-car at the gate. But of course it had no
lights, and Jauncey, intent on spying, did not go up to the front
gate to enter the garden. He must have got through the hedge lower
down, and made his way across the home field. I must see him about
this and ask him.</p>
<p>"After firing the shot Brett went downstairs again, and the
Granges saw no more of him," continued Detective Gillett. "No doubt
Brett found Lumsden's boots in the kitchen, as you said, and after
putting them on forced the window downstairs and climbed out. He
got into his car and drove off without lights, being very thankful
to get away without any one seeing him&mdash;as he thought.</p>
<p>"The Granges did not know he had gone, and while they were
quaking upstairs, wondering what to do, the front door was opened
again and there was a light step in the hall. This was Miss
Maynard. She had found the key in the lock which Brett had left
there. By this time the storm had reached the farm. There was a
high wind with heavy drops of rain. Miss Maynard, unconscious that
there was a dead man upstairs, and Grange and his wife on the floor
above, lighted the candle on the hallstand, and then took it into
the sitting-room, where Brett had got out of the house. She sat
down to wait for the appearance of Brett and Lumsden. No doubt the
fact that she had found the key in the door convinced her that they
were in the outbuildings. According to the Granges' story, Miss
Maynard arrived less than ten minutes after Brett's final trip
downstairs, and about a quarter of an hour after her arrival there
came a knock at the front door. This was Captain Marsland.</p>
<p>"The rest of the story we know, from Captain Marsland's
statement to Westaway, the only thing that is wrong with it being
his omission of all mention of Miss Maynard. Grange, bending over
the stairs to watch, knocked down the picture that made such a
crash. When Captain Marsland and Miss Maynard found the body, she
knew immediately that Brett must have had something to do with the
tragedy, and therefore she asked Captain Marsland to say nothing
about her presence there. If he had done so she would have had to
give us an account of her movements, and the object of her visit
there, and all this would have directed suspicion to Brett.</p>
<p>"Not till half an hour after Grange and his wife heard the door
close, when Captain Marsland and Miss Maynard departed, did they
venture downstairs. They looked in at the room in which the body
had been taken, and by the light of matches they saw the dead man
in the chair. They got away from the house as fast as they could.
They found the path down the cliff, and while Grange was helping
his wife down it his hat blew off. He thought nothing of this at
the time. In the old boat-house at the foot of the cliff they found
Pedro, who had been sheltering there from the storm. They waited in
the boat-house until the storm abated, and about nine o'clock they
pushed off in the boat for Staveley, which they were unable to
reach until nearly midnight, owing to the rough sea running.</p>
<p>"They decided to say nothing about what they knew, their
intention being to keep out of the whole affair. They were afraid
that they would be worried a great deal by the police if they said
anything, and they were still more afraid that the fact that they
had been connected with a murder would ruin their business. In the
morning old Pedro was sent over to the landing-place to find the
hat Grange had lost."</p>
<p>"A very interesting story," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"It is," said Gillett with pride in his success as a narrator.
"And it won't lose much in dramatic interest when it is unfolded in
evidence at the trial. In fact, I think it will gain in interest.
What a shock it will be to Brett when he finds that he was seen
carrying the body of Lumsden upstairs!"</p>
<p>"You are convinced that Brett was the murderer?" asked
Crewe.</p>
<p>"Absolutely certain. Aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Detective Gillett stared in surprise at the inscrutable face of
the man whose powers of deduction he had learned to look on with
admiring awe. Sergeant Westaway, whose legs had become cramped
owing to his uncomfortable attitude in a low chair, shifted his
position uneasily, and also looked intently at Crewe.</p>
<p>"Then whom do you suspect?" exclaimed Gillett in
astonishment.</p>
<p>"Suspect?" said Crewe with a slight note of protest in his
voice. "I suspect no one. Suspicions in regard to this, that and
the other merely cloud the view. Let us look at the facts and see
what they prove."</p>
<p>"I don't think you want better proof of murder than that the man
who was seen carrying the body of the murdered man subsequently
disappears, in order to escape being questioned by the police."</p>
<p>"It looks what you call suspicious," said Crewe, "but it is not
proof. You assume that Brett is the murderer, but you do not know
any of the circumstances under which the crime was committed."</p>
<p>"Lumsden was walking along the road to meet Brett. They did
meet, and in discussing this séance they quarrelled about the
division of the money."</p>
<p>"But why quarrel about dividing the money before the money was
found? They already had had some disappointments about finding the
money."</p>
<p>"They may have quarrelled about something else. But why did
Brett disappear, and why did he take the body to the farm and
endeavour to manufacture misleading clues?"</p>
<p>"I admit that his conduct is suspicious&mdash;that it is
difficult to account for. But if he is guilty&mdash;if he shot
Lumsden on the road or when they were driving along the
road&mdash;why did he take the body to the farm where it was sure
to be discovered, as he knew the Granges were to get there by 6
p.m.? Wouldn't it have been better for him to hide the body in a
field or a ditch? That would have given him more time to
escape."</p>
<p>"He took the body to the farm for the purpose of making us
believe that the murder was committed there," rejoined Gillett
slowly and positively. "And then disappeared in order to direct the
police suspicions to himself," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"No doubt he was inconsistent," Gillett admitted. "But a
murderer manufacturing false clues would scarcely be in the frame
of mind to think out everything beforehand. The object of leaving
false clues was to get sufficient time to escape. Surely, Mr.
Crewe, you are not going to say that you believe Brett had nothing
to do with the murder&mdash;that he is an innocent man?"</p>
<p>"I believe that he knows more about the crime than you or I, and
that he disappeared in order to escape being placed in a position
in which he would have to tell most of what he knows."</p>
<p>"And another person who knows a great deal about the crime is
Miss Maynard," said Gillett.</p>
<p>"Yes. I think you have some awkward questions to ask her."</p>
<p>"I have," replied the Scotland Yard representative
emphatically.</p>
<p>"You might ask her where she got Marsland's eyeglasses that she
dropped down the well. The boots and revolver she got from
Brett&mdash;or perhaps Brett dropped them there himself on the
night of the murder. But the eyeglasses are a different thing."</p>
<p>"She may have picked them up in the house, or along the garden
path. I understand that Captain Marsland lost a pair of glasses
that night."</p>
<p>"He did, but not the pair that were found in the well. The pair
that he lost that night he has not found, but the pair you found in
the well were in his possession for nearly a week after the murder.
He is quite sure on that point, but does not know where he lost
them."</p>
<p>"Of course, he knows that it was Miss Maynard who tried to
direct our suspicions to him?" asked Gillett.</p>
<p>"I told him very little, and what I did tell him was for the
purpose of satisfying him on a few minor points. That was implied
in my promise to you. But he asked about her before I had mentioned
her name. He asked if you had seen her."</p>
<p>"And I suppose he was very indignant with her?"</p>
<p>"No. He took it all very calmly. His calmness, his indifference,
struck me as remarkable in one who has suffered from nervous
shock."</p>
<p>"I would like to apologize to him if he is anywhere
about&mdash;if it is not too much trouble to send for him."</p>
<p>"Not at all," said Crewe. He touched the bell, and when the
parlour maid appeared, he sent her in search of Captain
Marsland.</p>
<p>The young man entered the room a few minutes later in evening
dress, and nodded cheerfully to the two police officials. He
listened with a forgiving smile to Detective Gillett's halting
apology for having believed that he had endeavoured to mislead the
police in the statement made to Sergeant Westaway on the night of
the murder.</p>
<p>"Miss Maynard will find that she has over-reached herself," said
Gillett to the young man in conclusion. "I will look her up in the
morning and frighten the truth out of her. She knows more about the
crime than any one&mdash;except Brett. As far as I can see she will
be lucky if she escapes arrest as an accomplice."</p>
<p>"Have you ever considered, Gillett, the possibility of her
having been the principal?" asked Crewe.</p>
<p>"No," said the detective, who obviously was surprised at the
suggestion. "Do you think that she fired the shot; that she and
Brett are both in it?"</p>
<p>"She fits into the tragedy in a remarkable way&mdash;she fits
into the story told by the Granges."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the detective doubtfully. "She does."</p>
<p>"Let us attempt to reconstruct the crime with her as the person
who fired the shot," continued Crewe. "Mrs. Grange was to hold a
séance at the farmhouse about 6 p.m. Lumsden, Brett and this girl
were to be present. Lumsden walked along the road to Staveley in
the expectation of meeting Brett, who was to drive over in a
motor-car. Miss Maynard, who was a good walker, set out from
Ashlingsea. She left early in the afternoon, in the expectation
that Brett would be at the farmhouse early. She found no one there
and then set out along the Staveley road to meet Brett. He was late
in starting from Staveley, and she met Lumsden, who, perhaps, was
returning along the road. They decided to sit down for a little
while and wait for Brett. Lumsden, who was in love with her, was
overcome by passion, and seized her in his arms. There was a
struggle in which the revolver that Lumsden carried fell out of his
belt. She picked it up and in desperation shot him. A few minutes
later Brett arrived in his car. He was horrified at what had
occurred but his first thought was to save the girl he loved from
the consequences of her act. He lifted the body of Lumsden into the
car, and with Miss Maynard beside him on the front seat, drove to
the farmhouse. She waited in the car while he carried the body into
the house, and took steps for giving the impression that Lumsden
was shot by some one who broke into the house. Then he went back to
the car, and after giving the girl his final directions bade her a
tender farewell. She entered the house and waited in accordance
with the plan Brett had thought out. She expected the Granges to
arrive at any moment; she did not know they were hiding upstairs.
Brett's plan was that she and the Granges should discover the body.
That would clear her of suspicion of complicity in the tragedy.
Marsland came to the house, and for Miss Maynard's purpose he
suited her better than the Granges because he took on himself the
discovery of the body and, at her request, kept her name out of it
to the police. Brett disappeared that night, ostensibly on secret
service work. His object was to shield his fiancée by directing
suspicion to himself."</p>
<p>"I don't think Brett is capable of such chivalry," said
Marsland.</p>
<p>"It is a very ingenious theory, very ingenious, indeed," said
Gillett. "I don't say that it is absolutely correct, Mr. Crewe, but
the reconstruction is very clever. What do you say, Westaway?"</p>
<p>"Very ingenious&mdash;very clever," said the Sergeant. "Only it
is no good asking me to believe that Miss Maynard did it; I could
never bring myself to believe that she was capable of it. I have
known her since she was a little girl. She is the daughter of a
highly respected&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We know all about that," said Gillett impatiently. "But lots of
highly respectable people commit murder, Westaway. Even among the
criminal classes there are no professional murderers. I'll see this
young lady in the morning, Mr. Crewe, and let you know the result.
I think I can promise that I'll shake the truth out of her."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>DETECTIVE Gillett cycled across to Ashlingsea the following
morning, after spending the night in Staveley as the guest of
Inspector Murchison. The morning was clear, the downs were fresh
and green beneath a blue sky, and the sea lapped gently at the foot
of the cliffs. In the bay the white sails of several small boats
stood out against the misty horizon. But Detective Gillett saw none
of these things. His mind was too busily engaged in turning over
the latest aspects of the Cliff Farm case to be susceptible to the
influences of nature.</p>
<p>He reached Ashlingsea after an hour's ride and decided to call
on Miss Maynard before going to the police station. The old stone
house and its grounds lay still and clear in the morning sun. The
carriage gates were open and Gillett cycled up the winding gravel
drive. The house looked silent and deserted, but the shutters which
protected the front windows were unclosed, and a large white
peacock strutting on the lawn in front of the house uttered harsh
cries at the sight of the man on a bicycle.</p>
<p>The bird's cries brought a rosy-cheeked maidservant to the front
door, who stared curiously at Gillett as he jumped off his bicycle
and approached her. A request for Miss Maynard brought a doubtful
shake of the head from the girl, so Gillett produced his card and
asked her to take it to her mistress. The girl took the card, and
shortly returned with the announcement that Mrs. Maynard would see
him. She ushered him into a large, handsomely furnished room and
left him.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards Gillett heard the sound of tapping in
the hall outside the door. Then the door was opened by the maid who
had admitted Gillett, and he saw an elderly lady, with refined
features and grey hair, looking at him with haughty dark eyes. She
was leaning on an ebony stick, and as she advanced into the room
the detective saw that she was lame.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see Miss Maynard," said Gillett, making the best
bow of which he was capable.</p>
<p>"You cannot see my daughter." She uttered the words in such a
manner as to give Gillett the impression that she was speaking to
somebody some distance away.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"She is not at home."</p>
<p>"Where is she?"</p>
<p>"That I cannot tell you."</p>
<p>"When will she return?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"But, madam, I must know," replied Gillett. "Your daughter has
placed herself in a very serious position by the statement she made
to the police concerning the Cliff Farm murder, and it is important
that I should see her at once. Where is she?"</p>
<p>"I decline to tell you."</p>
<p>"You are behaving very foolishly, madam, in taking this course.
Surely you do not think she can evade me by hiding from me. If that
is her attitude I will deal with it by taking out a warrant for her
arrest."</p>
<p>"I must decline to discuss the matter any further with you,"</p>
<p>Mrs. Maynard moved towards the bell as she spoke, as though she
would ring for a servant to show the detective out of the house.
Gillett, seeing that further argument was useless, did not wait for
the servant to be summoned, but left the room without another
word.</p>
<p>He rode down to the Ashlingsea police station, with an uneasy
feeling that his plans for the capture of Brett were not destined
to work out as smoothly as he had hoped. It had seemed to him a
simple matter then to see Miss Maynard in the morning, "frighten
the truth out of her," ascertain from her where her lover was
hiding, and have him arrested as quickly as the telegraph wires
could apprise the police in the particular locality he had chosen
for his retreat. But he had overlooked the possibility of the hitch
he had just encountered. Obviously the girl, in finding that
Marsland had not been arrested, had begun to think that her plans
had miscarried and had therefore decided to evade making any
further statement to the police as long as she could.</p>
<p>Gillett was hopeful that Sergeant Westaway, with his local
knowledge, would be able to tell him where she was likely to seek
seclusion in order to escape being questioned.</p>
<p>He had not conceived the possibility of Miss Maynard having
taken fright and disappeared from the town, because he deemed it
impossible that she could have known that he was aware how she had
tried to hoodwink the police. Yet that was the news that Sergeant
Westaway conveyed to him when he mentioned the young lady's
name.</p>
<p>"She left Ashlingsea by the last train from here last
night&mdash;the 9.30 to Staveley, which connects with the last
train to London."</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed the detective. "Do you mean to tell me you've
let the girl slip out of your hands? Why the blazes didn't you stop
her from going?"</p>
<p>"How was I to stop her?" replied the sergeant, in resentment at
the imperative tone in which the detective spoke. "I didn't get
home from Staveley last night until nearly ten o'clock and after
looking in here I went straight to bed. The station-master told me
about an hour ago that she had gone. She came along just before the
train started, and he put her in a carriage himself. He thought it
a bit strange, so he mentioned it to me when I was down on the
station this morning. I rang up Inspector Murchison in order to let
you know, but he told me you'd left for here."</p>
<p>"She's gone to warn Brett&mdash;she's in London by now," said
Gillett. "The question is how did she get to know that I was coming
over to see her this morning and expose the tissue of lies in her
statement to you. How did she get to know that the game was up?
You've said nothing to anybody, Westaway, about the conversation
that took place last night at Sir George Granville's house?"</p>
<p>"Of course I've said nothing," replied Sergeant Westaway. "She
had gone almost before I got back here last night."</p>
<p>"It beats me," said Gillett. "Who could have warned her?"</p>
<p>He picked up the telephone book off the office table, and turned
its leaves hurriedly. When he had found the number he wanted he
took up the telephone and spoke into the receiver.</p>
<p>"Double one eight Staveley, and be quick. Is that Sir George
Granville's? Is Mr. Crewe in? Yes, at once please. Is that you, Mr.
Crewe? It's Gillett speaking. The girl has gone&mdash;cleared out.
I cannot say: I've no idea. What's that you say? Oh, yes, I'll
telephone to Scotland Yard and tell them to keep a look out for
her, but I am afraid it won't be of much use&mdash;she's had too
long a start. But it's now more necessary than ever that we should
act quickly if we hope to lay our hands on the man. I think the
first thing to be done is to make a thorough search of the cliff
road for the actual spot where the job was done. Oh, you have? By
Jove, that's good! I'd be glad if you'd come with me then, because
it's on your theory that it was done away from the house that I'm
working&mdash;"</p>
<p>Police Constable Heather entered the office at this point with a
message for his superior officer. Sergeant Westaway, divided by
anxiety to hear the telephone conversation and a determination that
his subordinate should not hear it, imperiously motioned Constable
Heather away. But as Constable Heather misunderstood the motion and
showed no inclination to depart, Sergeant Westaway hurriedly led
him out of the office into the front garden, heard what he had to
say, and dismissed him with the mandate that he was on no account
to be interrupted again. He then returned to the office, but the
telephone conversation was finished, and Detective Gillett was
seated in the sergeant's office chair, looking over a document
which Sergeant Westaway recognized as Miss Maynard's statement.</p>
<p>"Crewe's going to drive us along the cliff road this afternoon
to see if we can locate the spot where Lumsden was shot," said the
detective, restoring Miss Maynard's statement to his pocket-book
and looking up. "I've arranged to meet him the other side of the
cutting at the top of the farm, and we will drive back along the
road in his car."</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Crewe express any opinion as to who&mdash;who had
warned Miss Maynard to take to flight?" asked Sergeant Westaway
eagerly.</p>
<p>"That was not a matter for discussion through the telephone,"
responded Gillett curtly. "I'll talk it over with him this
afternoon. I'll call for you here, at two o'clock. I've several
things to do in the meantime."</p>
<p>They met again at the appointed hour and cycled along as far as
Cliff Farm, where they put up their bicycles. Then they walked up
the hill from the farm. At the end of the cutting, they saw Crewe's
big white car, stationary, and Crewe and Marsland standing on the
greensward smoking cigars. The two police officers advanced to meet
them.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of very bad luck about this girl disappearing, Mr.
Crewe," said Gillett. "What do you make of it? Westaway thinks she
may have gone to stay with friends at Staveley, and that her
departure at this juncture is merely a coincidence."</p>
<p>"Miss Maynard would not pay a visit to friends by the last train
at night," said Crewe.</p>
<p>"Then somebody warned her that the game was up and that safety
lay in flight."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's the only reasonable explanation for her
disappearance," replied Crewe. "But who warned her?"</p>
<p>"That's the point!" exclaimed Gillett. "I have been thinking it
over ever since I discovered she had gone, and I've come to the
conclusion that it must have been that infernal little dwarf or her
husband, though what is their object is by no means clear. Who else
could it have been? The only other people who know that I intended
to unmask her are yourself, Westaway and Mr. Marsland. By a process
of elimination suspicion points to the Granges."</p>
<p>Crewe did not reply. While Gillett was speaking a flash of that
inspiration which occasionally came to him when he was groping in
the dark for light revealed to him the key by which the jigsaw of
clues, incidents, hints, suspicions, and evidence in the Cliff Farm
murder could be pieced together. But the problem was one of
extraordinary intricacy, and he needed time to see if all the
pieces would fit into the pattern.</p>
<p>It was at Detective Gillett's suggestion that they walked up to
the top of the hill, to the headland where Marsland's horse had
taken fright on the night of the storm.</p>
<p>He took Crewe's arm and walked ahead with him, leaving the
sergeant to follow with Marsland. As they went along, he
unconsciously revealed the extent of his dependence on Crewe's
stronger intelligence by laying before him the remaining
difficulties regarding the case. His chief concern was lest Miss
Maynard should warn Brett in time to enable him to slip through the
net which had been woven for him. To Crewe's inquiry whether the
London police had come across any trace of him he shook his head.
"No, he is lying low, wherever he is. My own belief is that he has
not gone to London, but that he is hidden somewhere in the Staveley
district. I shall look for him here, and Scotland Yard is watching
his London haunts. He's a pretty bad egg, you know. We've a record
of him at Scotland Yard."</p>
<p>"What has he done?"</p>
<p>"He's identical with a fashionable rogue and swindler who, under
the name of Delancey, kept a night club and a gambling hell in
Piccadilly, during the first year of the war. We had reasons for
closing the place without a prosecution, and Delancey, instead of
being sent to gaol, was allowed to enlist. He returned to England a
few months ago, invalided out of the army, where he was known under
the name of Powell. Since then he has been employed by the
Government in secret service work: mixing with the Germans who are
still at large in this country, and getting information about
German spies. He was given this work to do because he speaks German
so fluently that he can pass as a German amongst Germans.</p>
<p>"I suppose this girl Maynard will try to join him wherever he
is," resumed Gillett, after a pause. "It's a queer thing, don't you
think, for a well-brought-up English girl of good family to make
such a fool of herself over an unmitigated scoundrel like Delancey
or Brett, or Powell, or whatever he calls himself? From what I have
learnt up at Staveley this girl first met Brett about three months
ago. I do not know how they came to know each other, but from her
visit to Cliff Farm on the night of the murder I think that Lumsden
must have introduced them. There was some bond between Brett and
Lumsden which I have been unable to fathom. It is true they knew
each other through being in the army together, but that fact
doesn't account for their continued association afterwards, because
there was nothing in common between the two men: Brett was a
double-dyed scoundrel, and Lumsden was a simple, quiet sort of
chap.</p>
<p>"It may have been the attraction of opposites, or, it is more
likely that Lumsden knew nothing about Brett's past," continued
Gillett. "Brett was certainly not likely to reveal it, more
especially after he met the girl, because then he would keep up his
friendship with Lumsden in order to have opportunities of meeting
her at Cliff Farm. She also used to visit Brett at Staveley;
they've been seen together there several times. Apparently it was
Brett's idea to keep his meetings with this girl as secret as
possible, and for that reason he used to see her at Cliff Farm with
Lumsden's connivance. Nevertheless, he was not altogether
successful in keeping his love affair dark. On two occasions he was
seen walking with the girl on Ashlingsea downs, not far from her
mother's house, and there's been some local gossip in
consequence&mdash;you know what these small country places are for
gossip."</p>
<p>"You've put this part of the case together very well," said
Crewe.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not so bad," Gillett laughed complacently. "Of course
it was Scotland Yard that fished up all that about Brett's
antecedents. I flatter myself that we do that kind of thing better
in London than anywhere: it's difficult for a man to get rid of a
shady past in England. However, I'd be more satisfied with my work
if I had Brett under lock and key. What a fool I was not to go
straight across to that girl's house last night after I saw you,
instead of waiting till the morning!"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't have made much difference: I think she was warned
by telephone, and probably the person who warned her knew you did
not intend to look her up until the morning. If you had altered
your plans she would have altered hers."</p>
<p>"I could have telephoned to have her stopped at Victoria or
London Bridge."</p>
<p>"Not much use," responded Crewe, with a shake of the head. "She
wouldn't have revealed Brett's hiding-place."</p>
<p>"I'd have kept her under lock and key to prevent her warning
him," said Gillett viciously.</p>
<p>"Quite useless. Her detention would have been notified in the
press. Brett would have taken warning and disappeared. By the way,
Gillett, I'll be glad if you will refrain from referring to the
doubt I formerly expressed about Brett's guilt. And I must ask
Westaway to do the same."</p>
<p>"I thought you'd come around to my way of thinking," said
Gillett. "It was plain to me that it couldn't be anyone but Brett.
However, you can rest assured I won't try to rub it in. We all make
mistakes at this game, but some don't care to acknowledge a mistake
as candidly as you have done, Mr. Crewe."</p>
<p>The cliffs rose to a height of three hundred feet at this part
of the road, and a piece of headland jutted out a hundred yards or
so into the sea&mdash;a narrow strip of crumbling sandstone rock,
running almost to a point, with sea-worn sides, dropping
perpendicularly to the deep water below. Just past the headland, on
the Staveley side, the road ran along the edge of the cliffs for
some distance, the side nearest to the sea being protected by a low
fence, and flanked by "Danger" notices at each end. Crewe pointed
out the danger post which had been knocked out of the
perpendicular&mdash;it was the one nearest to the headland.</p>
<p>Detective Gillett examined it very closely, and when Marsland
and the Sergeant joined them he asked Marsland if he could point
out to him the exact spot where his horse had taken fright on the
night of the storm.</p>
<p>"I think it was somewhere about here, Crewe? It was about here
we saw the hoof marks, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Crewe measured the distance with a rule he had brought with him
from the motor-car.</p>
<p>"A trifle more to this way&mdash;about here," he said at
length.</p>
<p>Gillett glanced over the edge of the cliff, and at the white
water breaking over the jagged tooth-pointed rocks nearly three
hundred feet below.</p>
<p>"By Jove, you can congratulate yourself that you happened to be
on the right side of the road," he said, addressing himself to
Marsland. "If you'd gone over there, you wouldn't have stood much
chance."</p>
<p>"It was purely good fortune, or my horse's instinct," laughed
Marsland. "The road was so dark that I didn't know where I was
myself. I couldn't see a hand's turn in front of me."</p>
<p>"The marks of the car wheels ran off the road at this point,
bumped into the post, and then ran on to the road again." Crewe
traced the course with his stick. "Brett had a narrower escape than
Marsland. It's a wonder that the impact didn't knock away that
crazy bit of fencing."</p>
<p>"When Brett is on his trial it will be necessary for the jury to
visit this spot," said Sergeant Westaway solemnly.</p>
<p>"We've got to catch the beggar first," grumbled Gillett. "But
let's get along and see if we can hit upon the spot where the
murder was actually committed. How far along is it, Mr. Crewe, to
where the countryman you talked to saw him pass?"</p>
<p>"A little more than five miles from here."</p>
<p>"Then somewhere between the two places the murder must have been
committed, I should say."</p>
<p>"I know the place&mdash;approximately," replied Crewe. "I've
been over the ground several times, and I've been able to fix on it
more or less definitely."</p>
<p>"How did you fix it?" asked Gillett curiously.</p>
<p>"I had several clues to help me," replied Crewe, in a
non-committal voice. "Let us get back to the car and I will drive
you to the place."</p>
<p>They walked back to the car and drove slowly along the winding
cliff road. About two miles from the danger post the road turned
slightly inland, and ran for a quarter of a mile or more about two
hundred yards distant from the edge of the cliff. At this point the
downs began to rise above the level of the road, and continued to
do so until they were above the heads of the party in the car. It
was not a cutting; merely a steep natural inclination of the land,
and the road skirted the foot of it for some distance. A ragged
fringe of beech-trees grew along the top of the bank; doubtless
they had been planted in this bare exposed position of the downs to
act as a wind screen for the sheep which could be seen grazing
higher up the slope.</p>
<p>Crewe pulled up the car and looked about him, then turned his
head and spoke to Gillett: "This part of the road is worth
examining. There are several features about it which fit in with my
conception of the scene of the crime."</p>
<p>The four men got out of the car and walked forward, looking
about them. Crewe walked a little ahead, with his eyes roving over
the rising bank and the trees at the top. Several times he tried to
clamber up the bank, but the incline was too steep.</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do?" said Gillett, who was watching his
proceedings curiously.</p>
<p>"I am trying to fit in my theory of the crime by actual
experiments. If I can satisfy myself that Lumsden was able to climb
this bank at some point I believe we shall have reached the scene
of the murder."</p>
<p>"But why is it necessary to prove that?" asked Gillett, in a
puzzled voice. "Brett might have met him on the road, shot him from
the car which had been pulled up, and then carried the body to
Cliff Farm."</p>
<p>"My dear Gillett, have you forgotten that the bullet which
killed Lumsden took an upward course after entering the body? If he
had been shot from the car it would have gone downwards."</p>
<p>"Damn it! I forgot all about that point," exclaimed Gillett,
reddening with vexation.</p>
<p>"Lumsden couldn't have been shot on the road, either, because in
that case the bullet would have gone straight through
him&mdash;unless the man who fired the shot knelt down in the road
and fired upwards at him, which is not at all likely. Furthermore,
Lumsden was shot in the back low down, and the bullet travelled
upwards and came out above the heart. Therefore we've got to try
and visualize a scene which fits in with these circumstances.
That's why I have been looking at this bank so carefully. Let us
suppose that Lumsden was walking along the road and encountered his
would-be slayer. Lumsden saw the revolver, and turned to run. He
thought his best chance of escape was across the downs, so he
dashed towards the bank and sprang up it. He had almost reached the
top when the shot was fired. That seems to me the most possible way
of accounting for the upward course of the bullet."</p>
<p>"I see," said Gillett, nodding his head. "Brett might have fired
from his seat in his car, in that case."</p>
<p>"Precisely," returned Crewe. "But the weak point in my argument
is that so far we have not reached a point in the bank which is
capable of being scaled."</p>
<p>"A little further along it narrows and is less steep," said
Marsland, who had been listening intently to Crewe's remarks.
"Come, and I will show you."</p>
<p>He led the way round the next bend of the road, and pointed out
a spot where the branches of the trees which formed the wind screen
hung down over the slope, which was much less steep. It was a
comparatively easy matter to scramble up the bank at this point,
and pull oneself up on to the downs by the aid of the overhanging
branches.</p>
<p>Crewe made the experiment, and reached the top, without
difficulty; so did Gillett. Marsland and Sergeant Westaway remained
standing in the road below, watching the proceedings.</p>
<p>The downs from the top of the bank swept gradually upwards to
the highest point of that part of the coast: a landmark known as
the Giants' Knoll, a lofty hill surrounded by a ring of dark fir
trees, which gave the bald summit the appearance of a monk's
tonsure, This hill commanded an extensive view of the Channel and
the surrounding country-side on a clear day. But Detective Gillett
was not interested in the Giant's Knoll. He was busily engaged
examining the brushwood and dwarf trees forming the wind screen at
the point where they had scrambled up. Suddenly he turned and
beckoned to Crewe with an air of some excitement.</p>
<p>"Look here!" he said, as Crewe approached. "This seems to bear
out your theory." He pointed to the branch of a stunted beech-tree,
which had been torn away from the parent trunk, but still hung to
it, withered and lifeless, attached by a strip of bark.</p>
<p>"If Brett shot Lumsden as he was scrambling up the bank, Lumsden
might easily have torn this branch off in his dying
struggle&mdash;the instinct to clutch at something&mdash;as he fell
back into the road."</p>
<p>"It's possible, but it's not a very convincing clue by itself,"
returned Crewe. "It might just as easily have been torn off by the
violence of the storm. The thing is to follow it up. If Lumsden was
shot at this point the bullet which went through him may have
lodged in one of the trees."</p>
<p>Gillett had begun to search among the scattered trees at the top
of the bank very much like an intelligent pointer hunting for game.
He examined each tree closely from the bole upwards. Suddenly he
gave a shout of triumph.</p>
<p>"Look here, Crewe."</p>
<p>He had come to a standstill at a tree which stood a few yards on
the downs away from the wind screen&mdash;a small stunted oak with
low and twisted branches. Fair in the centre of its gnarled trunk
was a small hole, which Gillett was hacking at with a small
penknife. As Crewe reached his side, he triumphantly extracted a
bullet which had been partly flattened by contact with the
tree.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed. "What a piece of luck! What a piece of
luck!"</p>
<p>He held the bullet in the palm of his left hand, turning it over
and over with the penknife which he held in his right. He was so
absorbed in his discovery, that he did not notice Crewe stoop and
pick up some small object which lay in the grass a few yards from
the tree.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>CREWE and Marsland sat at a table in Sir George Granville's
library with the cryptogram before them. The detective was absorbed
in examining it through a magnifying glass, but Marsland kept
glancing from the paper to his companion's face, as though he
expected to see there some indication of an immediate solution.
Finally he remarked in a tone which suggested he was unable to
control his impatience any longer:</p>
<p>"Well, what do you make of it?"</p>
<p>"Not very much as yet," replied Crewe, putting down the
magnifying glass, "but there are one or two points of interest. In
the first place, the paper has been cut with a pair of scissors
from the fly leaf or title page of an old book&mdash;an expensive
book of its period, of the late fifties, I should say&mdash;but the
writing is of much later date. These facts are obvious, and do not
help us much towards a solution of the contents."</p>
<p>"They may be obvious to you, but they are not so obvious to me,"
said Marsland, taking the paper into his hands and looking at it
thoughtfully. "I suppose you judge the sheet to have been taken
from an old book, because it is yellow with age, but why an
expensive one of the fifties? And how do you know it was cut out
with a pair of scissors? Again, how do you know the writing is of a
much later date than the book? The ink is completely faded."</p>
<p>"The smooth yellow, and glossy surface of the blank side of the
paper indicates conclusively that it is the title-page or fly-leaf
of a good class book of the fifties. You will not find that
peculiar yellow colour&mdash;which is not the effect of
age&mdash;and velvety 'feel' in books of a much later date. The
unevenness of the cut proves that the sheet was taken from the book
with a pair of scissors; haven't you ever noticed that
nobody&mdash;except, perhaps, a paperhanger&mdash;can cut straight
with a pair of scissors? If it had been cut with a knife it might
have slanted a little, but it would have been straighter: a knife
cut is always straighter than the wavering cut of a pair of
scissors directed by the eye. The faded ink proves nothing:
inferior ink such as is sold in small village shops&mdash;from
where the ink at Cliff Farm was probably procured&mdash;will fade
in a few days; it is only the best ink that retains its original
colour for any length of time. But the character of this writing
indicates to me that it was written with a particular kind of fine
nib, which was not invented till after 1900."</p>
<p>"Can you make anything of the figures and letters on the paper?"
asked Marsland.</p>
<p>"That is where our difficulties commence. We have to ascertain
the connection between the figures and the letters and the circle;
to find out whether the former explain the latter or whether the
circle explains the figures and the letters. If the figures and the
letters are a cryptogram we ought to be able to find the solution
without much difficulty. The circle, however, is a remarkable
device, and it is difficult to fathom its meaning without something
to guide us. I thought at first it might have been capable of some
Masonic interpretation, but now I doubt it. The most likely
assumption is that the circle and the lines in some way indicate
the hiding place of the money."</p>
<p>"By geometry?" suggested Marsland, closely examining the circle
on the paper.</p>
<p>"I think not. It is hardly likely that the old farmer who
concealed the treasure would be versed in the science of geometry.
He may have drawn the circle to indicate a certain place where he
had concealed the money, and added the two lines to indicate the
radius or point where it was to be found."</p>
<p>"Local gossip declares that the old man hid his money somewhere
in the landing-place or old boathouse, where it is covered at high
tide, and that his ghost watches over it at low tide to prevent
anybody stealing it. There are stories of treasure-seekers having
been chased along the sands almost to Ashlingsea by the old man's
ghost. The villagers give the landing place and that part of the
coast road a wide berth at night in consequence."</p>
<p>"I do not think the old man hid his money in the boat-house or
landing-place," said Crewe. "He would have known that the action of
weather and tide would make such a hiding-place unsafe. He would
look for a safer place. He has almost certainly hidden it somewhere
about the farm, and the circle and the letters and figures will
tell us where, when we discover their meaning."</p>
<p>Crewe opened his notebook and commenced to make some
calculations in figures. Marsland meantime occupied himself by
looking at the circle through the magnifying glass, and in counting
the figures in its circumference.</p>
<p>"Perhaps these marks in the circle represent paces," he said,
struck by a new thought. "Suppose, for instance, that the old man
measured off a piece of ground with a tape measure fastened to some
point which would represent the pivot or centre of his circle. He
may have fastened the end of his tape measure to the well pump in
the bricked yard, and walked round in a circle holding the other
end in his hand, sticking in pegs as he walked. The top figure
inside the circle&mdash;150&mdash;may mean that the circle is 150
yards in circumference. Within the radius of the circle he buries
his money, makes a drawing of the circle of figures and the
remaining figures to indicate its whereabouts, and then removes the
cord and pegs."</p>
<p>"Ingenious, but unlikely," commented Crewe. "For one thing, such
a plan would need compass points to enable the searchers to take
their bearings."</p>
<p>"North or south may be indicated in the cryptogram&mdash;when we
discover it," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"No, no," said Crewe, shaking his head. "Your idea is based on
treasure-hunt charts in novels. My experience is that in real life
people do not go to much trouble in hiding money or valuables; they
put them away in some chance place or odd receptacle which happens
to appeal to them, and where I think they really have a better
chance of remaining undiscovered for years than in a more
elaborately contrived hiding-place. In the Farndon missing will
case, involving one of the largest estates in England, the will was
found after the lapse of ten years concealed in the back of a book,
where the deceased Lord Farndon had placed it in his latter days,
when he imagined himself surrounded by thieves. If you open a large
book about the middle it discloses an aperture at the back
sufficiently large to conceal a paper, and when the book is closed
there will be no sign. Lord Farndon concealed his will in one of
the estate ledgers which was in constant use for some time after
his death, and yet the will would probably have never been
discovered if a mouse had not eaten through the leather back long
afterwards, disclosing the hidden parchment.</p>
<p>"In the case of the stolen Trimarden diamond, the thief&mdash;a
servant in the house&mdash;escaped detection by hiding the jewel in
a common wooden match-box in a candlestick in his bedroom. The
police searched his room, but never thought of looking into the
matchbox, and he got away with the diamond. If he had not bragged
of the trick in a tavern he would never have been caught. As
regards hidden money, people of miserly proclivities who are
frightened to put their money into banks prefer a hiding-place
under cover to one in the open. A hiding-place in the house seems
safer to them, and, moreover, it enables them to look at their
money whenever they feel inclined. I knew one miser who used to
hide sovereigns in a bar of yellow soap&mdash;thrusting them in
till they were hidden from view. The treasure of Cliff Farm is
hidden somewhere in the farm, and the circle and the cryptogram are
the keys. The explanation is hidden in the cryptogram, and I have
no doubt that there is a very simple explanation of the
circle&mdash;when we discover the cryptogram."</p>
<p>"I remember as a boy at school that we used to have endless fun
solving cryptograms which appeared in a boys' magazine," said
Marsland. "Figures were substituted for letters, and the
interpretation of the cryptogram depended largely on hitting on the
book from which the figures had been taken. The system was to put
down the number of the page, then the number of the line, then the
number of letters in the line which would form a word. The key book
happened to be a bound volume of the magazine in question: I
guessed that, and won a prize. Another form of cryptogram for
competition in the same journal was a transposition of the letters
of the alphabet. But that was easily guessed, from the repeated
occurrence of certain letters used to represent the vowels."</p>
<p>"I remember those boyish devices," said Crewe, with a smile.
"But true cryptography is more scientifically based than that.
Systems of secret writing are practically unlimited in number and
variety&mdash;and so are solutions. Human nature hates being
baffled, and the human brain has performed some really wonderful
achievements&mdash;at the expense of much effort and
patience&mdash;in solving systems of cryptography which the
inventors deemed to be insoluble. I have a weakness for cryptograms
myself, and at one time collected quite a small library on secret
writing, from the earlier works by Bacon and Trithemius, to the
more modern works by German cryptographists, who have devised some
remarkably complicated systems which, no doubt, were largely used
by the Germans before and during the war for secret service work.
It is astonishing the number of books which have been written on
the subject by men who believed they had discovered insoluble
systems of secret writing, and by men who have set out to prove
that no system of secret writing is insoluble. Even the ancient
Hebraic prophets used cryptography at times to veil their attacks
on the wicked kings of Israel."</p>
<p>"How long do cryptograms&mdash;the more scientific, I
mean&mdash;usually take to solve?"</p>
<p>"Some cryptograms can be solved in an hour; others may take
months."</p>
<p>"Do you think that this one will prove very difficult?" asked
Marsland, pointing to the Cliff Farm plan as he spoke.</p>
<p>"I cannot say until I have studied it more closely. The solution
of any cryptogram depends first on whether you have any knowledge
of the particular system used, and then on finding the key. It is
quite possible, and frequently happens, that one is able to
reconstruct the particular system of secret writing from which a
cryptogram has been constructed, and then fail to find the key. A
really scientific cryptogram never leaves the key to guesswork, but
gives a carefully hidden clue for the finder to work upon; because
most cryptograms are intended to be solved, and if the composer of
the message left its discovery to guesswork he would be defeating
his own ends. This particular cryptogram looks to me to be
scientifically constructed; I cannot say yet whether it is possible
to reconstruct it and solve it."</p>
<p>Crewe resumed his scrutiny of the plan, making occasional
entries in his notebook as he did so.</p>
<p>Marsland leaned back in an easy chair, lit a cigar, and watched
him in silence. The detective's remark convinced him that there was
a wide difference between serious cryptography and the puzzle
diversions of his schoolboy days, and he felt that he would be more
of a hindrance than a help if he attempted to assist Crewe in his
task of unravelling the secret of the hidden wealth whose
hiding-place had been indicated by its deceased owner in the
symbols and hieroglyphics on the faded sheet of paper. He reclined
comfortably in his chair, watching languidly through half-closed
eyes and a mist of cigar smoke the detective's intellectual face
bent over the plan in intense concentration. After a while Crewe's
face seemed to grow shadowy and indistinct, and finally it
disappeared behind the tobacco smoke. Marsland had fallen fast
asleep in his chair.</p>
<p>He was awakened by a hand on his shoulder, and struggled back to
consciousness to find Crewe standing beside him, his dark eyes
smiling down at him.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I fell into a doze," Marsland murmured
apologetically, as the room and its surroundings came back to
him.</p>
<p>"You've been sleeping soundly for nearly two hours," said Crewe,
with a smile.</p>
<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Marsland. He took out his watch and
looked at it in astonishment. "By Jove, it's actually six o'clock.
Why didn't you wake me?"</p>
<p>"What for? I became so absorbed in the old man's secret that I
had no idea of the flight of time till I looked at my watch a few
minutes ago. He has evolved a very neat cryptogram&mdash;very neat
and work-manlike. It was quite a pleasure to try and decipher
it."</p>
<p>"Have you found out anything about it?"</p>
<p>"I believe I have solved it."</p>
<p>"And what is the solution?" asked Marsland, now thoroughly
awake. "Where is the money hidden?"</p>
<p>"Now you are going too fast," said Crewe. "I said I believed I
have solved the secret. In other words, I believe I have hit on the
old man's cryptogram, and the key which solves it, but I have
deferred applying the key till I awakened you, as I thought you
would like to share in it."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>CREWE went to the table and picked up the plan.</p>
<p>"My first impression was that the circle of figures represented
some form of letters of the alphabet arranged on what is called the
cardboard or trellis cipher, in which a message is concealed by
altering the places of the letters without changing their powers.
Such messages are generally written after the Chinese
fashion&mdash;upwards and downwards&mdash;but there is no reason
why a circle should not be used to conceal the message. In this
case I did not expect to find a message hidden in the circle, but
rather, the key to the solution of the letters above the circle,
which, I was convinced, formed the real cryptogram.</p>
<p>"The recurring T's and M's in the top line seemed to indicate
that it was some form of changed letter cipher, complicated by
having to be read in connection with the figures in the circle,
which represented other letters of the alphabet. The numbers,
representing an ascending series from 6 to 89, with one recurring
6, suggested the possibility of this form of cryptogram having been
used. The numbers in the centre suggested a sum, which, when done,
would throw some light on the arithmetical puzzle in the centre of
the circle by division, subtraction, or multiplication.</p>
<p>"I worked for a solution on these lines for some time, but
ultimately came to the conclusion that the solution did not lie
within them. I am not an arithmetician, but my calculations told me
enough to make me realize that I was on the wrong track.</p>
<p>"I next attempted to ascertain if the two mysterious
messages&mdash;the lines on the top and the circle of
figures&mdash;were two separate messages read independently of one
another. I did not think they were, but I determined to put it to
the test. Obviously, if they were, the top line was merely a
changed letter cipher, and nothing more. These are usually easy to
decipher because of the frequency with which certain letters recur.
In English the letter that occurs oftenest is E, then T, then A, O,
N, I, then R, S, H; the others in lessening frequency down to J and
Z, which are the least used letters in the English alphabet. The
recurring letters in our cryptogram are T's and M's. Using these as
a basis to give me the key, I tried all likely combinations on the
changed letter basis, but without success.</p>
<p>"I came back to my original idea that the figures in the circle
were the solvent of the line of letters above, and concentrated my
efforts in attempting to discover their meaning. I finally came to
the conclusion that the figures represented the pages or lines of
some book."</p>
<p>"Like the cryptograms I used to solve when I was at school,"
suggested Marsland, with a smile.</p>
<p>"Rather more difficult than that. In that form of cryptogram
rows of figures are turned into words once you hit on the right
book. This cryptogram is much more ingenious, for it consists of
three parts&mdash;a line of meaningless letters and a circle of
equally meaningless figures, with other figures within it, and some
plain English verses of Scripture, the whole probably
interdependent. If the circle of figures represented some book
necessary to the solution of the whole cryptogram, the first thing
to find out was the book from which the figures had been taken. I
had not much difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that this
book was a large brass-bound family Bible I saw at Cliff Farm."</p>
<p>"I suppose the texts on the bottom of the sheet suggested that
idea to you?" said Marsland.</p>
<p>Crewe shook his head.</p>
<p>"I've learnt to mistrust guesswork," he said. "It would be a
jump at random to come to the conclusion that the cryptogram had
been drawn on the fly-leaf of a Bible because it contained some
Scripture texts. There is no connection between the facts. In fact,
it seemed unlikely to me at first that a religious man like the old
farmer would have mutilated his family Bible for such a purpose. I
was inclined to the view that he had taken a fly-leaf from one of
his <i>Leisure Hour</i> bound volumes, which at the farm range from
1860 to the early seventies&mdash;a period of years when this kind
of glossy thick paper was much used for fly-leaves by English
printers. But while I was examining the sheet through the
magnifying glass I detected this mark on the edge, which proved
conclusively to me that the cryptogram had been drawn on the
fly-leaf of the family Bible. Have a look at it through the
glass&mdash;you cannot detect it with the naked eye."</p>
<p>Crewe held the sheet edgeways as he spoke, and pointed to one of
the outer corners. Marsland gazed intently through the glass, and
was able to detect a minute glittering spot not much larger than a
pin's point.</p>
<p>"I see it," he said, relinquishing the glass. "But I do not
understand what it means."</p>
<p>"It is Dutch metal or gold-leaf. The book from which this sheet
was cut was gilt-edged. That disposes of the volumes of <i>Leisure
Hour</i> and other bound periodicals, none of which is gilt-edged.
When I was looking at the books at the farm I noticed only two with
gilt-edged leaves. One was the big family Bible, and the other was
a large, old fashioned <i>Language of Flowers</i>. But this sheet
could not have been cut from <i>The Language of Flowers</i>."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because it has two rounded corners. As a rule, only sacred
books and poetry are bound with rounded corners. In any case, I
remember that <i>The Language of Flowers</i> at the farm is
square-edged. Therefore the sheet on which the cryptogram has been
drawn was cut from the Bible.</p>
<p>"The next question that faced me was how the numbers had been
used: they did not represent the numbers of the pages, I was sure
of that. The Bible is a book in which figures are used freely in
the arrangement of the contents. The pages are numbered, the
chapters are divided into verses which are numbered, and there is a
numbered table of contents at the beginning of each chapter.
Obviously, the Bible is an excellent book from which to devise a
cryptogram of numbers owing to the multiplicity of figures used in
it and the variety of ways in which they are arranged. I found both
a Bible and Prayer Book in the bookshelves, here, and set to work
to study the numerical arrangement of the chapters, the divisions
of the verses, and the arrangement of figures at the head of the
chapters."</p>
<p>"It was while I was thus engaged that I remembered that at the
beginning of the authorised version of the Bible is inserted a
table of the books of the Old and New Testaments, the pages on
which they begin, and the number of chapters in each. Here was the
possibility of a starting-point, sufficiently unusual to make a
good concealment, yet not too remote. I turned to the table, and,
on running my eye down it, I saw that the Psalms, and the Psalms
alone, contain 150 chapters. Now, the first line of central figures
in the cryptogram is 150. I was really fortunate in starting off
with this discovery, because otherwise I might have been led off
the track by the doubling and trebling of the 3 in the second line
of central figures, and have wasted time trying to fathom some
mystic interpretation of the 9&mdash;a numeral which has always had
a special significance for humanity: the Nine Muses, the Nine
Worthies, 'dressed up to the nines,' and so on. But with 150 as the
indication that the cryptogram had been composed from the Book of
Psalms, it was obvious that the next line of numerals in the centre
directed attention to some particular portion of them. As there are
not 396 verses in any chapter of the Psalms&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Just what I was going to point out," broke in Marsland.</p>
<p>"Quite so. But it was possible that 396 meant Psalm 39, 6.
Therefore I turned to the thirty-ninth Psalm. Verse six of that
Psalm reads:</p>
<p>"'Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall
gather.'"</p>
<p>"Appropriate enough," commented Marsland.</p>
<p>"There remained the final 6, under the 396, to be explained,
before I was able to start on the table which had been used to
build up the cryptogram. The fact that the figures in the outside
circle start at 6 indicated that there was some connection between
it and the inner 6. I came to the conclusion that the inner 6 meant
one of two things: either the designer preferred to start from the
number 6 because he thought the figure 1 was too clear an
indication of the commencement of his cryptogram, or else he made
his start from the sixth letter of the text. I thought the former
the likelier solution, but I tried them both, to make sure. The
first five figures on the latter solution gave me a recurring Y,
which indicated that I was on the wrong track because it was
essential there should be no recurring letters. There are no
recurring letters in the other key, as the table shows:</p>

<p>"The circle of figures taken in their ascending order and
starting with the second six, run thus:</p>
<p>6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 39, 51, 54,
72, 80, 89.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that my interpretation of the solitary six in the
circle is correct&mdash;that the old man started from six because
he thought the use of the figure one gave away too much&mdash;we
will substitute for these figures the letters which appear
underneath them in the table. The substitution gives us the
following row of letters:</p>
<p>S R E L Y V M N W A K T H I U D Q P C O S</p>
<p>"This is the line of letters from which we will endeavour to
reconstruct the old man's cryptogram. We can, I think, go forward
with the assurance that they are the actual letters represented by
the cryptogram, for several reasons. There are no recurring
letters, and they represent every letter in the text in consecutive
order, with three exceptions which are capable of a simple
explanation. The U has been taken from the second 'surely' instead
of the first, to mislead the solver. Otherwise you would have
surely for the first five numbers, which would be too clear an
indication. The same reason exists for making A the tenth letter
instead of the eighth; which would reveal the word 'man.' The final
letter&mdash;the 'G' in 'gather'&mdash;has been excluded, for a
reason which I will presently explain."</p>
<p>"What about the second S&mdash;the final letter? Do you not call
that a recurring letter?" asked Marsland, who was closely examining
the table the detective had prepared.</p>
<p>"Not in the cryptographic sense. It is the first letter of the
text repeated after the line had been completed without recurring
letters. There is a special reason for its use. The old man has
worked on what is called the keyword cipher, which is the most
difficult of all ciphers to discover. This system consists of
various arrangements, more or less elaborate, of tables of letters,
set down in the form of the multiplication table, and from the
table agreed upon messages are constructed whose solution depends
on the use of some preconcerted keyword. The most scientific
adaptation of this principle was constructed by Admiral Sir Francis
Beaufort. In his system the letters of the alphabet are set down
one under another from A to Z, then A is added to the line. The
next line starts with B and runs to another B at the bottom. You
continue till you have the whole alphabet set down in this fashion.
From this table and an agreed keyword, which may consist of a
proper name or a sentence of several words, you construct a cipher
message."</p>
<p>"How?" asked Marsland, in a tone of keen interest.</p>
<p>"That is what I now propose to demonstrate to you, if, as I
think, the old man constructed his cryptogram in accordance with
this principle. I have come to the conclusion that he modified and
adapted this system to his own ends, using the letters of the text
from the Bible to conceal it better, and then made it more
difficult still by turning the letters into figures after the
manner I have described. He has also made a slight but not uncommon
variation from the Beaufort principle by striking out the 'G' in
'gather,' which would follow the 'O' if every letter in the text
was used once, and substituting the final S, instead of placing the
'S' after 'G.' But the clue that suggested to my mind that he had
worked on this principle are the two figures 6 coming together at
the top of the circle. In the substituted letters they form two
S's. Now, why does he have two S's when he carefully avoids
recurring letters in the rest of the table? And why did he insert
the first S again, as represented by the figure 6, instead of
taking the next S in this table?</p>
<p>"In pondering over these points I discovered, as I believe, the
system of cryptogram he used to construct his secret. He wanted to
make the cryptogram difficult of solution, but at the same time he
wanted to give some indication of the form of cryptogram he was
using when his heirs came to search for the money. The recurring S
indicates that he was working on a modification of the system I
have explained, in which you add the first letter of your first
column to the bottom, and continue on that system throughout the
table. It is not much of a hint, because we have got to find the
keyword before we can use the table, but by its help we will start
with the assumption that the old man worked on the following
table:</p>

<p>"It is from this table, unless I am very much mistaken, that he
constructed the cipher at the top of the sheet," said Crewe.</p>
<p>Marsland examined the curious table of letters, with close
scrutiny, from various points of view, finally reversing it and
examining it upside-down. He returned it to Crewe with a
disappointed shake of his head.</p>
<p>"I can make nothing of it," he said.</p>
<p>"It is necessary for us to discover the keyword he worked on
before we can make use of it," said Crewe. "Once we get the
keyword, we will have no trouble in deciphering the mysterious
message. The keyword is the real difficulty in ciphers of this
kind. It is like the keyword of a combination lock. Without it, you
cannot unlock the cipher. It is absolutely insoluble. Suppose, for
example, he had picked a word at random out of the dictionary, and
died without divulging it to anybody, we should have to go through
the dictionary word for word, working the table on each word, till
we came to the right one."</p>
<p>"But that would take years," exclaimed Marsland blankly.</p>
<p>"Unless we hit on it by a lucky accident. That is why the
keyword cipher is practically insoluble without knowledge of the
keyword. It is not even necessary to have a word. A prearranged
code of letters will do, known only to the composer of the
cryptogram. If he wanted anybody else to decipher his cryptogram,
he would have to divulge to him not only the form of table he
worked on but the code of letters forming the keyword."</p>
<p>"Well, I do not see we are much further forward," said Marsland
despondently. "Of course, it's very clever of you to have found out
what you have, but we are helpless without the keyword. The old man
is not likely to have divulged it to anybody."</p>
<p>"You are wrong," said Crewe. "He has divulged it."</p>
<p>"To whom?"</p>
<p>"To this paper. As I said before, he did not want his cryptogram
to be insoluble; he wanted his heirs to have his money, but he did
not want it found very easily. You have forgotten the texts at the
bottom of the paper. They have not been placed there for nothing.
The keyword is hidden in them."</p>
<p>"I forgot all about the texts&mdash;I was so interested in your
reconstruction of the cryptogram," said Marsland. "As you say, he
didn't put the texts there for nothing, so it seems likely that he
has hidden the keyword in them. But even now we may have some
difficulty in finding it. Do you propose to take the texts word for
word, testing each with the table, till you find the right
one?"</p>
<p>"That would take a long while," said Crewe. "I hope to simplify
the process considerably. In fact, I think I have already
discovered the keyword."</p>
<p>"You have!" exclaimed Marsland, in astonishment. "How have you
managed that?"</p>
<p>"By deduction from the facts in front of us&mdash;or perhaps I
should say by reflecting on the hints placed in the texts. Isn't
there something about those texts that strikes you as
peculiar?"</p>
<p>Marsland examined them attentively for some time, and shook his
head.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I'm not sufficiently well up in the Scriptures to
notice anything peculiar about them. I should say they were from
the Old Testament, but I couldn't tell you what part of it."</p>
<p>"The texts are from the Old Testament, from Jeremiah XXV and
Isaiah VII. They are remarkable for the fact that they represent
two passages&mdash;the only two instances in the whole
Bible&mdash;where the writers used cryptograms to hide their actual
meaning. In the first instance the prophet, Jeremiah, living in
dangerous times, veils his attack on the King of Babylon by writing
Sheshak for Babel&mdash;Babylon; that is, instead of using B B L,
the second and twelfth letters of the Hebrew alphabet, from the
beginning, he wrote Sh Sh K from the end&mdash;a simple form of
cryptogram which is frequently used, even now. In the second
instance the prophet Isaiah, working on a very similar form of
cryptogram, writes 'Tabeal' for 'Remaliah.'</p>
<p>"Now, we are faced by two facts concerning the presence of these
two texts on the paper containing the cryptogram. In the first
place, the cryptogram was complete without the texts; for what
purpose, then, could they have been at the bottom of the sheet
except to give a clue to the discovery of that keyword without
which no recovery of the hidden treasure was possible, unless it
was found by a lucky chance? In the second place, the selection by
the old man of the only two cryptographic texts in the Bible was
certainly not chance, but part of a deliberate harmonious design to
guide the intelligent searcher to the right keyword. He was
evidently versed in cryptography, constructed this one as carefully
as a mechanic putting together a piece of mechanism, fitting all
the parts carefully into one another. The figures in the centre of
the circle give the key to the outside figures: the outside figures
are the key to the cryptographic table of letters from which the
cryptogram is to be solved; there remains the key to be found. It
is not likely that the composer of such an ingenious cryptogram
would leave the keyword to guesswork.</p>
<p>"The whole thing is a Bible cryptogram from first to last:
figures, letters, words, and texts. It is even drawn on a sheet cut
from the Bible. Why? Such an act might be deemed irreverent in a
deeply religious man like the old man was, but when we piece the
thing together we find that he was actuated by a religious spirit
throughout. Not the least skilful part of his cryptogram is his
concealment of the keyword in the text at the bottom. The text
would convey nothing to most people, for very few people know
anything about cryptograms, still fewer people would know that
these texts contain the only two cryptograms in the Bible.
Therefore, in accordance with his harmonious design, it seems to me
that the keyword should be found in the five alternatives of the
cryptic texts: Babel, Babylon, Sheshak, Remaliah, or Tabeal.</p>
<p>"Babel and Babylon may be discarded because there is no letter B
in the cryptographic table, and it is essential that the keyword
shall contain no letter which doesn't also appear in the table.
'Sheshak' may also be discarded for the present as unlikely because
of the awkwardness of the recurring 'Sh' in a keyword. There remain
Tabeal and Remaliah. The tendency of the composer would be to use
the longer word, because a long keyword is the better for the
purpose. I think, therefore, we should first try whether Remaliah
is the keyword we are in search of."</p>
<p>"By Jove, Crewe, that is cleverly reasoned out!" exclaimed
Marsland, in some excitement. "Let's put it to the test. How do we
apply this keyword to the table?"</p>
<p>"Easily enough. On this sheet of paper we will write down the
cryptogram; and the keyword underneath it, letter for letter,
thus:</p>
<p>T Y N M V R T T H S M<br>
R E M A L I A H R E M</p>
<p>"Now, the first word of the cryptogram is T. Look in the first
column of the table for it, and then run your eye across the table
for the first letter of the keyword. When you have found it, look
at the top of the column and tell me the letter."</p>
<p>"K," said Marsland. "Very well, then. We put down 'K' as the
first word of the solution and proceed in like manner through the
whole of the cipher. The second letter is Y&mdash;find it in the
table, then look across for the second letter of the key E, and
then to the top of the column. What letter have you?"</p>
<p>"C," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"KC, then, are the first two letters of our solution, and we go
on to the third, always repeating the same process. N in the first
column, M across, and the top gives you?"</p>
<p>"O," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"The next letter is M in the cryptogram and A in the keyword.
What does the top of the column give you?"</p>
<p>"L," replied Marsland. "But I say, Crewe, do you think we are on
the right track? K, C, O, L, is a queer start for a word isn't it?
I know of no word commencing like that."</p>
<p>"I may be mistaken, but I do not think so," replied Crewe
firmly. "Let us keep on till we've finished it, at all events."</p>
<p>They resumed their task, and ultimately brought out the letters:
K, C, O, L, C, H, C, R, A, E, S. Marsland gazed at the result in
dismay.</p>
<p>"By Jove, we're on the wrong track," he said ruefully. "It is
the wrong word, Crewe. These letters mean nothing; you'll have to
try again."</p>
<p>But Crewe did not reply. He was examining the result of his
night's labours closely. Suddenly he put down the paper with an
unusual light in his eye.</p>
<p>"No," he said. "I am right, the old man was thorough to the last
detail. He has given another clue to his heirs in the circle and
the two lines. They represent a clock face. But the figures round
them run the reverse way to clock figures. The cryptogram reads
backwards. Hold it up to that mirror, and see."</p>
<p>Marsland did so, and laid down the paper with a look of
bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Search clock! The old grandfather clock at Cliff Farm!" he
said.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>AS the car swept around the deserted sea-front and through the
scattered outskirts of the town, Crewe gradually increased the
going, till by the time Staveley was left behind, and the Cliff
road stretched in front of them, his powerful car was driving along
at top speed. The night was not dark for the time of year; the
windings of the road were visible some distance ahead: from the
cliffs the rollers of the incoming tide could be seen breaking into
white froth on the rocks below.</p>
<p>"It has occurred to me that, for a man who was afraid of a
German invasion, old Lumsden selected a very bad hiding-place for
his money," said Marsland. "He could not have known of the
reputation the German soldiers made for themselves in stealing
French clocks in the war of 1870."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," replied Crewe. "But I do not think he intended to
leave the money in the clock when the Germans came. If he fled from
the farm he would have taken it with him. His object in hiding it
in the clock was to have it constantly under his eye."</p>
<p>The car mounted the hill to the cutting through the cliff road
near their destination, and as the road dipped downwards Crewe
slackened the pace. Both of them were looking across towards the
farm on the left. As it came into view Crewe exclaimed to his
companion:</p>
<p>"Did you see that?"</p>
<p>"A light!" said Marsland excitedly.</p>
<p>"It is gone now; it was probably a match. There must be some one
there. I wonder who it could be?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is Gillett. We will soon see."</p>
<p>"No, we will drive past. It may be some one who wants to escape
being seen. We will run the car off the road a little way down past
the farm, then extinguish the lights and make our way back."</p>
<p>He increased the pace of the car so that if there was any one at
the farm it would appear that the car was going on to Ashlingsea.
They both kept their eyes on the house as the car sped past, but
there was no repetition of the flash of light they had seen. Less
than half a mile away Crewe shut off the engine, and carefully ran
the car off the road on to a grassy path. He extinguished the
lights and jumped out of the car. He took an electric torch from
his overcoat pocket and after turning it on to see if it was in
order he set off in the direction of the farm.</p>
<p>"We will not keep to the road, as there may be some one on the
watch," he said. "Follow me, I know my way across the fields."</p>
<p>He clambered over the gate of a field and set off at a run, with
Marsland following him closely. He led the way over ditches and
across hedges and fences until they reached the meadow at the side
of the farm. Before climbing the low, brick wall Crewe waited for
Marsland.</p>
<p>"You watch the front of the house while I go to the back. If you
see any one challenge him in a loud voice so that I can hear you,
and I'll come to your assistance. If I want you I'll call out."</p>
<p>They climbed the wall and dropped noiselessly on to the grass.
Crewe waited until Marsland had taken up his station behind a
plum-tree in the garden, and then crept towards the kitchen door.
He stood outside the door listening intently for a few minutes, but
as he heard no sound he selected the right key from the bunch he
had borrowed from Gillett, and turned the lock. He waited to see if
the sound of the turning lock had alarmed any one inside the house.
Slowly he turned the handle, opened the door and stepped
noiselessly into the kitchen.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Marsland heard him approaching him from the
back of the house.</p>
<p>"Come quickly," he said. "Some one has been before us and found
the money, but he is coming back again."</p>
<p>Marsland silently followed Crewe along the side of the house to
the kitchen, and into the room where the great grandfather clock
stood. Crewe flashed the torch on it, and Marsland started back
with a cry of astonishment. The wooden case had been smashed beyond
repair. It had been hacked and splintered with a heavy weapon,
which had not only battered in the front of the case, but smashed
the back as well. Pieces of the wood had been pulled off and flung
about the room. About the bottom of the broken case several
sovereigns were lying.</p>
<p>"The treasure!" he cried. "It was here then. Has he got away
with it?"</p>
<p>"Most of it, but not all of it," said Crewe. "See here!" He
knelt down by the case, plunged in his hand, and drew forth a
canvas bag which clinked as he held it up. "This is the sort of bag
that banks use for holding sovereigns&mdash;the banks put a
thousand sovereigns into each bag and seal it up so as to render it
unnecessary to count the coins every time the bags are handled.
There are four of these bags still here."</p>
<p>"But where are they hidden?" asked Marsland, in amazement.
"Where did you find this one? Wasn't it lying on the floor when you
came in?"</p>
<p>"The old man devised a skilful hiding-place," said Crewe. "He
fitted the case with a false back, and stowed his treasure in
between. Look here!"</p>
<p>He flashed the light around the interior of the case, and
Marsland, looking closely, saw that the back of it, which had been
smashed, was a false one, skilfully let in about three inches in
front of the real back. In the space between the two backs the
eccentric old owner of Cliff Farm had concealed his treasure as he
had obtained it from the bank.</p>
<p>"It's an ingenious hiding-place," said Crewe. "He laid the clock
on its face, took off the back, fitted his false slide into a
groove, stacked in his money-bags, replaced the proper back, and
then restored the clock to its original position. You see, he was
careful to make the space between the false and the real backs so
narrow that there was very little possibility of the hiding-place
being discovered by chance or suspicion. Even the man who has
forestalled us with the solution of the cryptogram was unable to
discover the treasure until he had recourse to the clumsy method of
smashing up the clock. This is what he used to do it." Crewe
pointed to an axe lying near. "With that he smashed the case, found
the treasure, and carried off what he could. He would be able to
carry four of these bags at a time&mdash;two in each hand. He has
left these four for another trip. How many trips he has already
made I do not know, but probably more than one."</p>
<p>"He may be back again any moment," said Marsland, lowering his
voice to a whisper. "Hadn't we better hide?"</p>
<p>"He won't be back just yet," said Crewe confidently.</p>
<p>"What makes you so certain of that?"</p>
<p>"He was here when we saw the flash of light. That is less than
half an hour ago. To walk from here with four of these bags to the
cliff, down the path in the dark to the boat he has waiting for him
would take more than half an hour."</p>
<p>"But what makes you think he has a boat? Why do you feel sure he
has come by sea?"</p>
<p>"Because that is the better way to come if he wanted to escape
observation. If he came by road he would have brought a vehicle and
would have taken the whole of the treasure away in a few minutes.
But in a vehicle he might be met along the road by some one who
knew him."</p>
<p>"Have you any idea who it is?" asked Marsland.</p>
<p>"Some one who has solved the cryptogram or got it solved for
him," said Crewe. "By making a tour of the second-hand bookshops in
London he probably got in touch with some one who has made a study
of cryptograms, and in that way got it solved. There are some
strange human types in these big second-hand bookshops in
London&mdash;strange old men full of unexpected information in all
sorts of subjects."</p>
<p>"But how did he get a copy of the cryptogram? Could he have got
possession of the copy I found on the stairs?"</p>
<p>"I think so."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Miss Maynard gave it to him."</p>
<p>"Miss Maynard!" echoed the young man. "How could she have got
it? She left the house with me and did not come back. In fact, she
was very much opposed to coming back when I suggested that we
should do so in order to get it."</p>
<p>"If she had it in her possession at the house her opposition to
your proposal to go back for it is quite reasonable. I think you
said that after you found the dead body upstairs she rushed
downstairs and waited outside for you. She had ample time to go
into the room and take the cryptogram from the table where you
placed it. Doubtless her main thought was that its presence might
implicate Brett in some way."</p>
<p>"Then it is Brett who has taken this money and is carrying it
down the cliff to the boat?" said Marsland excitedly.</p>
<p>"Yes. Probably Miss Maynard is down at the boat keeping guard
over the bags as he brings them."</p>
<p>"And you think he will come back here for the rest?" asked
Marsland.</p>
<p>Crewe noticed the eagerness in the young man's voice: it seemed
as if Marsland was excited by the thought of meeting Brett.</p>
<p>"He is not likely to leave £4,000 behind unless he knows the
place is being watched."</p>
<p>"Let us go towards the cliffs and meet him," declared Marsland
impatiently. "To think that I am to meet him face to face, and here
of all places."</p>
<p>"We might miss him in the dark, and he might get clean
away."</p>
<p>"Where shall we hide?" asked the young man, again sinking his
voice to a whisper. "He may reach here any moment now."</p>
<p>"He came in by the front door. The lock has not been injured, so
apparently he has a key. You hide in the room on the
left&mdash;just inside, close to the door. I will hide in the
cupboard underneath the staircase. When he reaches the clock he
cannot escape without passing us. Give him time to get the money,
and as soon as he has the bags in his hands ready to start off, we
will both spring out at him."</p>
<p>Crewe watched Marsland enter the sitting-room on the left and
then opened the door of the cupboard beneath the staircase and
crouched down. The cupboard opened into the hall, and through the
crack of the door Crewe was able to see into the room where the
shattered clock was. The door of the room where Marsland was hidden
also commanded a view of the interior of the room in which the
clock stood. The stillness was so complete that Crewe could hear
the watch in his pocket ticking off the ebbing moments. Once the
distant yelp of a sheep-dog reached him, then there was another
long period of stillness. Twice his keen ear caught a faint
creaking in the old house, but he knew they were but the mysterious
night noises which are so common in all old houses: the querulous
creakings and complaints of beams and joists which have seen many
human generations come and go.</p>
<p>But, as the time dragged on without a sound to indicate that the
thief was returning, Crewe found to his vexation that he had
increasing difficulty in keeping his senses alert in that dark and
muffled silence. The close and confined atmosphere of the cupboard,
the lack of air, his cramped position, compelled an unconquerable
drowsiness.</p>
<p>Then he heard a sound which drove away his drowsiness&mdash;the
sound of a key in a lock. He heard the door creak as it was pushed
back and then came steps advancing along the hall, stumbling along
noisily, as though their owner thought that the need for
precautions ceased when the front door was passed: that once inside
the house he was safe, and need not fear interruption.</p>
<p>There was a scrape and a splutter, and a flickering flame in the
hall; the thief had struck a match. Through the crack of the
cupboard door Crewe watched the tiny blue flame grow larger, turn
yellow, and burn steadily, and he could see the dim outline of a
man's back and a hand shielding the match showing transparent
through the flame. The thief had struck his match with his face to
the doorway. The outline of his other hand approached, and the
light grew brighter&mdash;the intruder had lit a piece of candle.
As it burnt up the man turned towards the clock, and Crewe saw the
face of Brett for the first time. His impression was of a pair of
hunted nervous eyes roving restlessly in a livid waxen mask, a
tense sucked-in mouth.</p>
<p>He saw no more. Apparently Marsland had been too excited to wait
until the thief had the bags in his hands, for Brett started as
though he heard a movement, and quickly extinguished his candle.
There was a moment of intense silence, and then Crewe heard
Marsland's voice raised in a strange high-pitched scream that made
it seem unfamiliar.</p>
<p>"Powell, you traitor and murderer! I am Marsland&mdash;Captain
Marsland. I will kill you without sending you to trial."</p>
<p>Crewe had thrown open the door of the cupboard at the first
sound of the voice, but before he could get on to his feet there
was the deafening sound of a revolver shot, followed by the rush of
feet and the fall of a body.</p>
<p>The bullet had missed the thief, and Marsland, advancing on him
after firing, had been knocked over by Brett's rush for the door.
Before Crewe could reach him across Marsland's prostrate form Brett
had thrown open the door and was outside the house.</p>
<p>Crewe dashed for the door in pursuit. He caught a glimpse of a
fleeing figure, bent nearly double to shield himself from another
shot, running down the gravel path at amazing speed. Then the
figure was swallowed up in the night.</p>
<p>Crewe followed, without waiting to find out how Marsland had
fared. He failed to catch another glimpse of Brett, but had no
doubt he would make for the path down the cliff, about a quarter of
a mile away, Crewe, who had been a long-distance runner at school,
and was in excellent training, knew that he would last the distance
better than Brett.</p>
<p>He caught sight of Brett again before half the distance between
the downs and the cliffs had been covered&mdash;a fantastic flying
figure bobbing into view against the sky-line for an instant as he
ran across the crest of a little hill, and as suddenly disappeared
again. But that brief glimpse of the fugitive revealed to Crewe
that Brett had mistaken his course: he was running too much to the
right. Crewe ran on steadily in a straight line for the path. When
Brett discovered that he had run too wide he would have to curve
back, taking almost a semicircular course before he reached the
beginning of the path. Crewe's course was the shorter&mdash;the
cord to Brett's bow, and would bring him to the path before Brett
could possibly reach it. The detective slackened pace slightly, and
cast a glance over his shoulder to see if Marsland was following
him; but he could not see him.</p>
<p>Crewe reached the hidden path, and waited, listening, by the
bushes which concealed the entrance. Soon his quick ear caught the
pad of footsteps, and as they drew nearer they were accompanied by
the quick breathing of a man running hard. Then the form of Brett
loomed up, running straight for the path.</p>
<p>Crewe sprang at him as he came close, but the runner saw his
danger in time to fling himself sideways. He was on his feet again
in an instant, and made away along the edge of the cliff, bounding
along with great jumps among the rocks from point to point and rock
to rock. Crewe drew so close that he could hear Brett's panting
breath as he ran, but each time Brett with a desperate spurt put a
few more yards between them again. Once he staggered and seemed
about to fall, but he sprang up again and ran with the speed of a
hare.</p>
<p>They had reached the rocky headland which jutted into the sea a
hundred yards or more by the dangerous turn of the cliff road.
Crewe slackened his pace to call out a warning to the man he was
pursuing.</p>
<p>"Look out or you will fall over the cliff!" he cried.</p>
<p>Brett paused, turned irresolutely, and then began slowly to
retrace his steps. But as he did so a figure appeared suddenly out
of the gloom and dashed past Crewe towards him.</p>
<p>"You dog, I have you!" screamed Marsland. "You cannot get away
from me again."</p>
<p>"Look out, Marsland!" cried Crewe, springing after him. "You
will both go over."</p>
<p>Marsland ran on without heeding, cursing savagely at the hunted
man. Brett had fled away again at the sound of his voice, and Crewe
could hear his gasping breath as he stumbled over the slippery
rocks. The two figures appeared clearly against the sky-line for a
moment as they raced towards the end of the headland. Then the
foremost disappeared over the cliff with a scream. Brett,
endeavouring to double in his tracks at the edge of the headland,
had slipped and gone over.</p>
<p>Marsland was standing on the edge of the cliff, peering down
into the sea mist which veiled the water below, when Crewe reached
his side. Crewe drew him back.</p>
<p>"Come away if you don't want to follow him," he said. "We shall
have to get the police out to look for his body, but perhaps the
sea will carry it away."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>THE search for the body began in the morning, at low tide.
Inspector Murchison had come from Staveley to superintend, and from
the landing place he and Sergeant Westaway directed the operations
of the Ashlingsea fishermen who had been engaged to make the
search.</p>
<p>Some of the townspeople who had walked up from the town to
witness the proceedings thought that the body would be swept out to
sea and never recovered, but the fishermen, with a deeper knowledge
of a treacherous piece of sea from which they wrested their living,
shook their heads. If the gentleman had fallen in near the deep
water of the landing-place the undercurrent might have carried him
out into the Channel, but there were too many reefs and sand-banks
running out from the headland, and too many cross-currents, to let
a body be carried out to sea.</p>
<p>They gave it as their opinion that the body would be found
before high tide, either in one of the shallows near the big
sand-bank, a quarter of a mile out, or in one of the pools between
the reefs whose jagged, pointed edges showed above the surface of
the sea nearer the headland.</p>
<p>The sea lay grey and still under an October sky of dull silver.
The boats, as they came from Ashlingsea, put in at the
landing-place to receive the instructions of the police officers
standing there, and then started to search. There were two rowers
in each boat, and standing at the stern was a man holding the rope
to which the grappling irons were attached. Slowly and mechanically
the boats were rowed out some distance to sea, and then rowed back
again. The men in the stern watched the ropes in their hands for
the first sign of tautness which would indicate that the grappling
irons had hooked in to something. Frequently one of the irons
caught on a piece of rock, and when this happened the boat had to
be eased back until the irons could be released. The boats
searching further out, near the sand-bank, used nets instead of
grappling irons.</p>
<p>Crewe, who had driven over in his car from Staveley, after
watching this scene for some time, turned back to the road in order
to put up his car at Cliff Farm. Marsland had not accompanied him.
The young man had motored over with his uncle, who, after hearing
from his nephew a full account of the events of the previous night,
had insisted on participating in the search for the missing man.
Sir George Granville, on arriving at the headland, had scrambled
down the cliff with some idea of assisting in the search, and at
the present moment was standing on the landing-place with Inspector
Murchison, gesticulating to the rowers, and pointing out likely
spots which he thought had escaped their attention.</p>
<p>Crewe, on regaining his car, found Marsland leaning against it,
contemplating the scene before him with indifferent eyes. He nodded
briefly to the detective, and then averted his eyes. Crewe
explained his intention regarding the car, and Marsland said he
might as well go down with him. He got up into the front seat with
the same listlessness that had characterized his previous actions,
but did not speak again till they reached the farm.</p>
<p>At the house Crewe and Marsland met Detective Gillett, who had
gone there to store his bicycle preparatory to watching the
operations of the fishermen searching for the body.</p>
<p>"I have had a pretty busy time since you came along to us last
night," he said, referring to the visit of Crewe and Marsland to
Ashlingsea police station to report the fall of Brett over the
cliff. "We got the money&mdash;£l2,000 altogether. There was £8,000
in the motor-boat and £4,000 here in the bottom of the old clock
case, as you said."</p>
<p>"What about the girl?" asked Crewe. "Was she there?"</p>
<p>Detective Gillett looked in the direction of Marsland before
replying.</p>
<p>The young man, with the same air of detachment that had marked
his previous actions, had wandered some distance down the
gravel-walk, and was carelessly tossing pebbles from the path at
some object which was not apparent to the two men in the porch.</p>
<p>"I found her searching along the cliffs with a lantern," said
Gillett, in a low voice. "She was looking for Brett; she told me
that she had heard a scream and she thought he must have fallen
over accidentally. I didn't enlighten her. Poor thing, she is
half-demented. She has got it into her head that she is responsible
for some document or paper which Brett had given into her
safe-keeping, and which she handed back to him last night at his
request before he went to the farm to look for the money."</p>
<p>"Doesn't she know what is in the paper?" asked Crewe
quickly.</p>
<p>"Her mind is in such a state that it is useless to question her.
She keeps repeating that it was to be opened in the event of his
death. It was only after great difficulty I ascertained from her
that she had given the paper back to Brett last night. I am anxious
that Brett's body should be recovered in order to ascertain what
its contents are."</p>
<p>"I should think the girl would have a fair idea of the
contents."</p>
<p>"I think so too, but she is not in a fit state to be questioned
at present, and may not be for some time. The strain has been too
much for her. In my opinion she is in for a severe illness."</p>
<p>"Where is she now?"</p>
<p>"At the station. Of course, I had to take her into custody on a
charge of attempting to steal this money. Whether the public
prosecutor will go on with the charge or whether he will bring any
other charge of a more serious nature against her remains to be
seen."</p>
<p>Marsland, who had abandoned his stone throwing, had strolled
back to the porch in time to hear Gillett's last remarks.</p>
<p>"It is a strange thing to find a girl of her type in love with
such a scoundrel," he said.</p>
<p>"Quite a common thing," said Detective Gillett, speaking from
the experience of the seamy side of life which comes under the
attention of Scotland Yard. "There are some women brought up in
good surroundings who seem to be attracted irresistibly to
scoundrels. You never know what a woman will do. By the by, it is a
good thing, Mr. Marsland, that you did not hit him when you fired
at him last night. If you had killed him I should have had to
arrest you, and the case would have had to go to a jury. Of course,
there is no doubt how it would have ended, but it would have been
an unpleasant experience for you."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have minded that," was the young man's answer.</p>
<p>Gillett regarded this declaration as bravado, and merely
continued:</p>
<p>"As it is, you are virtually responsible for his death in
frightening him over the cliff, but the law takes no account of
that."</p>
<p>"I should prefer to have shot him," said Marsland.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, I must get away and see what they are doing," said
the Scotland Yard detective, who obviously disliked Marsland's
attitude. "I suppose I'll see you again during the day?"</p>
<p>When he had gone off towards the cliffs Crewe turned to Marsland
and said:</p>
<p>"I am going to have another look at the place&mdash;now that
this case is concluded."</p>
<p>He entered the house and Marsland followed him. The interior
looked more sombre and deserted than ever. The fortnight which had
elapsed since the tragedy&mdash;during which time the place had
been left untenanted&mdash;had intensified the air of desolation
and neglect that brooded over the empty rooms, had thickened the
dust on the moth-eaten carpets and heavy old furniture, and gave an
uncanny air to the staring eyes of the stuffed animals which hung
on the wall in glass cases&mdash;dead pets of dead occupants of
Cliff Farm.</p>
<p>Crewe and Marsland looked through the house, entered the room
where the grandfather clock stood, and Crewe pointed out the mark
of the bullet which Marsland had fired at Brett the previous night.
In his excitement he had fired too high, and the bullet had gone
into the wall about eight feet from the floor, between two
photographs which hung on the wall. One of these photographs was of
James Lumsden, the eccentric old owner of Cliff Farm, who had
broken his neck by falling downstairs. The other was Frank Lumsden,
whose dead body had been found in the house by Marsland thirteen
days before.</p>
<p>"That was the second time I missed Brett," said Marsland,
staring at the bullet hole in the wall between the photographs.</p>
<p>"The second time?" echoed Crewe. "Do you mean that he was the
burglar at whom you fired a week ago?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I came into the room just as he was getting out of the
window. I caught only a glimpse of him but I knew him instantly. I
had a presentiment that he was near and that is why I happened to
be wearing my revolver."</p>
<p>"What was his object in breaking into the house?"</p>
<p>"He wanted to be sure that I was the man he had to fear just as
I wanted to be sure that he was the man I wanted to kill. An hour
before I had broken into his rooms at 41 Whitethorn Gardens, for
the purpose of making sure about him. I saw his photograph there,
and that is all I wanted."</p>
<p>"And it was you and not he who was in the house when Mrs.
Penfield called out that the police were in the house?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that was I. I didn't understand why she called out, but it
served as a warning to me that she expected him. And so when I got
back to my uncle's I got my revolver out of the drawer. The first I
heard of him being in England was when Inspector Murchison told us,
although I was prepared in a way after finding that Lumsden had
been here. Murchison spoke of him as Brett, but I did not know him
by that name. So to make sure I got Mrs. Penfield out of the house
by a hoax on the telephone and broke into the place in her absence.
I did not know that it was you who came back with her."</p>
<p>"But his object in breaking into your room was probably to get
some article of yours which would help to bring suspicion against
you with regard to Lumsden's death. No doubt it was he who took the
glasses which were subsequently found in the well. As you lost a
pair of glasses in the storm and arrived at the farm without them,
Miss Maynard probably mentioned the fact to Brett. Did you tell her
that you had lost your glasses that night?"</p>
<p>"I forget. Oh, yes, I did! I mentioned it when we were looking
at the cryptogram on the stairs."</p>
<p>"He was certainly an enterprising scoundrel."</p>
<p>"Don't you wish to know why I wanted to kill him?" asked the
young man after a pause.</p>
<p>"I do, very much."</p>
<p>"I feel that I must speak about it," he said. "And you are the
only man to whom I can. You heard Murchison tell us that Lumsden
and Brett, as he called himself, had been tortured by the Germans
but that they gave away no information. That is their version; let
me tell you the truth about them. Both of them belonged to my
company in France. Lumsden had been under me for four or five
months and I had nothing against him. He was a fairly good soldier
and I thought I could depend upon him. Powell&mdash;or
Brett&mdash;had come over with a recent draft. One night when I was
holding a short advanced trench to the south of Armentières I sent
Lumsden and Brett out on a listening patrol. The trench we were
holding was reached through a sap: it was the first of four or five
that were being dug as jumping off places for an attack on the
German trenches.</p>
<p>"It was just about midnight that I sent Lumsden and Brett out
and they ought to have been back by 2 a.m. It was the middle of
summer and dawn commenced about 3 a.m. Either they had been
captured or had lost their way and were waiting for dawn. When it
was light enough to see the landscape, two figures appeared on the
parapet of a German trench in front about three hundred yards away.
They were calling and gesticulating to us. At that distance it was
impossible to make out what they were saying, but from their
gestures we gathered that the Germans had deserted the trench and
it was ours if we liked to go over and occupy it.</p>
<p>"It came as such a surprise that none of us stopped to think;
but if we had stopped no one would have thought of treachery. The
men went over the parapet&mdash;every one of them. It was a
race&mdash;they were laughing and joking as to who should be there
first. And when we were within forty yards or so there was a volley
from rifles and machine guns. The bullets seemed to come from every
quarter. The men were taken by surprise and they dropped almost
before they had time to realize what had happened. I was one of the
first to go down but it was only a bullet in the leg. As I lay
where I fell I was struck by another bullet in the shoulder. Then I
crawled to a shell hole for shelter. I found seven of my men there,
all of whom had been hit.</p>
<p>"We were not there long before the Germans commenced to lob hand
grenades into the shell hole. How I escaped death I do not know: it
was an awful experience to see those murderous bombs coming down
and to be powerless to escape from them. I saw several of my poor
men with limbs blown off dying in agony, and from what I learned
subsequently much the same thing had happened in other shell holes
where men had crawled for shelter. Out of my company of 82&mdash;we
were not at full strength, and I had only three second lieutenants
besides myself&mdash;I was the only one to come through alive. And
I lay in a state of semi-collapse in the shell hole for two days
before being rescued when our men drove the Germans out of their
trenches."</p>
<p>"A dreadful experience," said Crewe sympathetically.</p>
<p>"These two miserable loathsome creatures, Brett and Lumsden, to
save their own lives, had beckoned my company into the trap. They
had been captured by the Germans, and no doubt were tortured in
order to make them do what they did. But as British soldiers they
should have died under torture rather than be guilty of treachery.
The memory of how my poor men died without having a chance to
defend themselves haunts me day and night. I hear their
voices&mdash;their curses as they realized that they were the
victims of a horrible act of treachery, their cries and moans in
the agony of death."</p>
<p>He sat down on the upturned clock case and buried his face in
his hands.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>"AM I the first man to whom you have told this story?" asked
Crewe, in a gentle voice.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Marsland. "It is not a story that I would care to
tell to many. It is not a story that reflects any credit on
me&mdash;my company wiped out through treachery on the part of two
of my men."</p>
<p>"But when you came back to England, wouldn't it have been better
to have reported the matter to the military authorities and have
had Brett and Lumsden tried by court martial?"</p>
<p>"I did not know they were in England until I came down here: I
thought that if they were not dead they were prisoners in Germany.
I have no witnesses for a court martial, and after being off my
head in the hospital for a couple of months I doubt if a court
martial would believe my story. Counsel for the defence would say I
was suffering from delusions. And it would have driven me mad if
such a scoundrel as Brett had been acquitted by a court martial for
want of evidence. Besides, the satisfaction of having him shot was
not to be compared with the satisfaction of shooting him down
myself just as if he were a dog."</p>
<p>"But it is a terribly grave thing to take human life&mdash;to
send a man to his death without trial."</p>
<p>"I have seen so many men die, Crewe, that death seems to me but
a little thing. If a man deserves death, if he knows himself that
he deserves it a hundredfold, why waste time in proving it to
others? If I had shot Brett I should doubtless have had to stand my
trial for murder. But if the police searched all over England could
they have found a jury who would convict me if I saw fit to tell my
story in the dock? Told by a man in the dock it would carry
conviction; but told by a man in the witness-box at a court martial
it might not."</p>
<p>"I believe there is some truth in that," said Crewe, in a firm,
quiet voice. "But it is a matter which must be put to the
test."</p>
<p>Marsland stood up and fixed on him an intent gaze.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" he said. "If Brett is dead he died by
accident&mdash;by a fall over the cliff. The law cannot touch
me."</p>
<p>The detective did not speak, but his eyes held the young man's
glance intently for a moment, and then travelled slowly to the
portrait of Frank Lumsden on the wall.</p>
<p>"I mean that," he said slowly.</p>
<p>"Do you know all?" Marsland asked, in a voice which was little
more than a whisper.</p>
<p>"I know that it was you who shot Frank Lumsden."</p>
<p>"Yes, I shot him!" The young man sprang to his feet and uttered
the words in a loud, excited tone which rang through the empty
house. "And so little do I regret what I have done, that if I had
the chance to recall the past I would not falter&mdash;I would
shoot him again."</p>
<p>"Sit down again," said Crewe kindly. "Do not excite yourself.
You and I can discuss this thing quietly whatever else is to happen
afterwards."</p>
<p>"How long have you known that I did it?" asked Marsland, after a
pause.</p>
<p>"It was not until yesterday that I felt quite certain. What
annoys me&mdash;what offends my personal pride&mdash;is that my
impetuous young friend Gillett picked you out as the right man
before I did. He was wrong in his facts, wrong in his deductions,
wrong in his theories, and hopelessly wrong in his reconstruction
of the crime. He had no more chance of proving a case against you
than against the first man he might pick out blindfolded from a
crowd, and yet he was right. True, he came to the conclusion that
he was wrong when I put him right as to the circumstances under
which the tragedy occurred, but that doesn't soothe my pride
altogether. If there is one lesson I have learned from this case,
it is that humility is a virtue that becomes us all.</p>
<p>"But, after all, I do not think I have been so very long in
solving the problem," the detective continued. "It is only thirteen
days since the tragedy took place, and from the first I saw it was
a complicated case. I never ruled out the possibility of your being
the right man after Brett and Miss Maynard tried to sheet home
Lumsden's death to you. I do not think she was fully in Brett's
confidence&mdash;in fact, it is fairly obvious that he would not
tell her the story of his treachery. But he knew that you had shot
Lumsden and she caught at his conviction without being fully
convinced herself. Brett's conduct was inconsistent with guilt. But
it was consistent with the knowledge that Lumsden had met his death
at your hands and that he himself would share the same fate if you
encountered him.</p>
<p>"I am under the impression that he reached Lumsden a few minutes
after you rode away from the spot, and that Lumsden was then alive.
Probably he was able to breathe out your name to Brett. The latter
helped the dying man into the motor-car and started to drive back
to Staveley for medical aid, and after passing the thatched cottage
on the right he became aware that Lumsden had collapsed and was
past human aid. So he decided to take the body to the farm, and in
order to disappear, without drawing immediate suspicion on himself,
he tried to indicate that Lumsden was shot in the house.</p>
<p>"Then he disappeared because he was afraid of you. If he had got
you under lock and key he might have risked coming into the open
and giving evidence against you. But I rather fancy that his
intention was to get away to a foreign country with old Lumsden's
money, and then put the police on your track by giving the true
circumstances under which Lumsden was shot."</p>
<p>"Did he write to you?" asked Marsland.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I was always afraid he would. What put you on my track?"</p>
<p>"The conviction that you had warned this girl to clear out as
Gillett had obtained some awkward facts against her. You were the
only person who had any object in warning her, though Gillett
thinks you had even less reason to do so than Brett. I regarded you
merely as an average human being and not actuated by Quixotic
impulses. I remembered that she had tried to sheet home the crime
to you and therefore you had little cause to be grateful to
her&mdash;so far I am in accord with Gillett. But if you knew that
she had nothing to do with the tragedy, and if you felt that
Gillett's close questioning might lead to information from Brett
which would tell against you, it was common sense on your part to
get her out of the way."</p>
<p>"It is wonderful how you have divined my mind and the line of
thought I followed," said the young man. His even tones were an
indication that he was regaining his composure.</p>
<p>"Next, there was your attempt to kill Brett instead of helping
me to capture him. That told against you. True, it indicated that
you had what you regarded as a just cause of deadly hatred. But if
you were under the belief that Brett had killed Lumsden it would
have suited you better to capture him than to shoot him. Your shot
at Brett showed me that you knew it was not Brett who had killed
Lumsden, and also that you feared if Brett were arrested he would
charge you with shooting Lumsden."</p>
<p>"Go on," said the young man breathlessly.</p>
<p>"There is little more to tell," said Crewe. "I had to ask
Gillett yesterday not to refer to the doubts I had expressed to him
regarding Brett's guilt. I was afraid he might do so in your
presence and that would have put you on your guard. The final proof
came when Gillett discovered the bullet in the tree where Lumsden
fell. At the moment Gillett found the bullet I picked up these in
the grass."</p>
<p>Crewe produced from his waistcoat pocket a pair of
eye-glasses.</p>
<p>"So that is where I lost them!" exclaimed Marsland. "It never
occurred to me before. I have no recollection of their dropping
off&mdash;I suppose I was too excited to notice they had gone."</p>
<p>"Your meeting with him was accidental?" said Crewe.</p>
<p>"Quite. I had been out riding on the downs and when I struck the
road I wasn't sure which way I had to go to get home. I saw a man
coming along the road and I rode up to him. It was Lumsden. I tell
you, Crewe, he was terrified at the sight of me&mdash;no doubt he
thought that I had been killed in France. As I was dismounting and
tying up my horse he pleaded for his life. He grovelled at my feet
in the dirt. But I didn't waste much time or pity. I told him that
he had earned death a hundredfold, and that the only thing I was
sorry for was that I could kill him only once. He sprang up the
bank in the hope of getting away, but I brought him down with a
single shot. I saw that he was done for and I left him gasping in
the agony of death. I had no pity&mdash;I had seen so many men die,
and I had seen my company of good men go to their deaths because of
his treachery.</p>
<p>"I rode back over the downs, and caring little which way I went
I lost my way and was overtaken by the storm. Eventually I saw the
farm and went there for shelter. And upstairs I found the dead body
of this man Lumsden. It was the strangest experience of my life. I
did not know what to think&mdash;I could not make out how the body
had got there. And when Miss Maynard asked me to say nothing to the
police about her having been there I thought it was the least I
could do for her. I knew that whatever errand had brought her there
she had nothing to do with his death."</p>
<p>There was a long pause during which the two men looked at one
another. "You think that I had just cause for shooting him?" said
Marsland.</p>
<p>"I think you had no right to take upon yourself the
responsibility of saying 'The law will fail to punish these men and
therefore I will punish them without invoking the aid of the
law!'"</p>
<p>"I do not regret what I have done. As I said before, if I had to
go through it again I would not hesitate to shoot him. Perhaps it
is because I have lived so much with death while I was at the front
that human life does not seem to me a sacred thing. These two men
deserved death if ever men did."</p>
<p>"You believe that no jury would convict you?" said Crewe.</p>
<p>"I do not see how a jury of patriotic Englishmen could do so.
But I do not care about that. I have finished with my life; I do
not care what becomes of me. When I recall what I have been through
over there in France, when I think of the thousands of brave men
who have died agonized deaths, when I see again the shattered
mutilated bodies of my men in the shell-hole with me&mdash;I want
to forget that I have ever lived. All that remains to be done is
that you should hand me over to the police."</p>
<p>"That is a responsibility which I should like to be spared,"
said Crewe gravely. "I think we may leave it to Brett."</p>
<p>"To Brett!" exclaimed Marsland, springing to his feet again in
renewed excitement. "Do you think he has escaped death; do you
think he has got away?"</p>
<p>"I feel sure he was killed. But if his body is recovered the
police will learn from it that it was you who shot Lumsden."</p>
<p>"How will they find that out?"</p>
<p>"The girl Maynard has told them that he had an important paper
in his possession when he was drowned and that is why they are so
anxious to recover the body. They do not know the contents of the
document but it is an easy matter to divine them. Let us look at
this matter in the way in which Brett must have looked at it after
thinking it over carefully. He knew that you had shot Lumsden; he
knew that if he met you his life would not be worth a moment's
purchase. The shot you fired at him when he was breaking into your
room at Staveley was an emphatic warning on that point, if he
needed any warning.</p>
<p>"Do you think that he would not take steps to bring his death
and Lumsden's death home to you in the event of his being shot
down? If he had got out of the country, as no doubt he had hoped to
do, he would have put the police on your track for shooting
Lumsden. If the police recover Brett's body, they will find on it a
document setting forth Brett's account of how Lumsden met his
death. No doubt his and Lumsden's treachery will be glossed over,
but your share in the tragedy will be plainly put."</p>
<p>"I overlooked all this," said Marsland quietly. "Let us walk
across to the cliffs and see what they are doing."</p>
<p>They left the farm and walked slowly towards the cliffs, each
immersed in his own thoughts. There were a few groups of people on
the road, and another group at the top of the hill. Suddenly there
arose a shout, and the people on the road started running towards
the cliffs.</p>
<p>"They've found it!" The cry of the people on the beach below was
carried up to the cliffs, and Crewe and Marsland, looking down, saw
the fishermen in one of the boats close to the cliff lift from the
water the dripping, stiffened figure of a man which had been
brought to the surface by the grappling irons.</p>
