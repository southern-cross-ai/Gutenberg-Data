<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The main object of this book is to exhibit the facts relative
to the expedition despatched to Australia by Napoleon Bonaparte
in 1800 to 1804, and to consider certain opinions which have been
for many years current regarding its purpose.</p>
<p>Until about five years ago the writer accepted without doubt
the conclusions presented by leading authorities. One has to do
that in regard to the vast mass of historical material, because,
obviously, however much disposed one may be to form one's
opinions on tested facts apart from the writings of historians,
several lifetimes would not be sufficient for a man to inquire
for himself as to the truth of a bare fraction of the conclusions
with which research is concerned.</p>
<p>But it so happened that the writer was interested, for other
reasons than those disclosed in the following pages, in
ascertaining exactly what was done by the expedition commanded by
Captain Nicolas Baudin on the coasts which were labelled Terre
Napoleon. On scrutinising the facts somewhat narrowly, he was
surprised to find that opinions accepted with unquestioning faith
began to crumble away for lack of evidence to support them.</p>
<p>So much is stated by way of showing that the book has not been
written to prove a conclusion formulated a priori, but with a
sincere desire that the truth about the matter should be known.
We read much in modern books devoted to the era of the Corsican
about "the Napoleonic legend." There seems to be, just here, a
little sporadic Napoleonic legend, to which vitality has been
given from quarters whence have come some heavy blows at the
larger one.</p>
<p>The plan adopted has been, after a preliminary sketch of the
colonial situation of Great Britain and France in the period
under review, to bring upon the scene&mdash;the Terre Napoleon
coasts&mdash;the discovery ship Investigator, despatched by the
British Government at about the same time as Napoleon's vessels
were engaged upon their task, and to describe the meeting of the
two captains, Flinders and Baudin, in Encounter Bay. Next, the
coasts denominated Terre Napoleon are traversed, and an estimate
is made of the original work done by Baudin, and of the serious
omissions for which he was to blame. A second part of the subject
is then entered upon. The origin of the expedition is traced, and
the ships are carefully followed throughout their voyage, with a
view to elicit whether there was, as alleged, a political purpose
apart from the scientific work for which the enterprise was
undertaken at the instance of the Institute of France.</p>
<p>The two main points which the book handles are: (1) whether
Napoleon's object was to acquire territory in Australia and to
found "a second fatherland" for the French there; and (2) whether
it is true, as so often asserted, that the French plagiarised
Flinders' charts for the purpose of constructing their own. On
both these points conclusions are reached which are at variance
with those commonly presented; but the evidence is placed before
the reader with sufficient amplitude to enable him to arrive at a
fair opinion on the facts, which, the author believes, are
faithfully stated.</p>
<p>A third point of some importance, and which is believed to be
quite new, relates to the representation of Port Phillip on the
Terre Napoleon maps. It is a curious fact that, much as has been
written on the early history of Australia, no writer, so far as
the author is aware, has observed the marked conflict of evidence
between Captain Baudin and his own officers as to that port
having been seen by their discovery ships, and as to how the
representation of it on the French maps got there. Inasmuch as
Port Phillip is the most important harbour in the territory which
was called Terre Napoleon, the matter is peculiarly interesting.
Yet, although the author has consulted more than a score of
volumes in which the expedition is mentioned, or its work dealt
with at some length, not one of the writers has pointed out this
sharp contradiction in testimony, still less attempted to account
for it. It is to be feared that in the writing of Australian, as
of much other history, there has been on the part of authors a
considerable amount of "taking in each other's washing."</p>
<p>The table of comparative chronology is designed to enable the
reader to see at a glance the dates of the occurrences described
in the book, side by side with those of important events in the
world at large. It is always an advantage, when studying a
particular piece of history, to have in mind other happenings of
real consequence pertaining to the period under review. Such a
table should remind us of what Freeman spoke of as the "unity and
indivisibility of history," if it does no more.</p>

<p><b>PART 1.</b></p>
<p>A continent with a record of unruffled peace.<br>
Causes of this variation from the usual course of history.<br>
English and French colonisation during the Napoleonic wars.<br>
The height of the Napoleonic empire and the entire loss of the
French colonies.<br>

The colony at Port Jackson in 1800.<br>

The audacious exploit of Commodore Dance, and Napoleon's
direction to "take Port Jackson" in 1810.</p>
<p>Australia is the only considerable portion of the world which
has enjoyed the blessed record of unruffled peace. On every other
continent, in nearly every other island large in area, "war's red
ruin writ in flame" has wrought its havoc, leaving evidences in
many a twinging cicatrice. Invasion, rebellion, and civil war
constitute enormous elements in the chronicles of nations; and
Shelley wrote that the study of history, though too important to
be neglected, was "hateful and disgusting to my very soul,"
because he found in it little more than a "record of crimes and
miseries." A map of the globe, coloured crimson as to those
countries where blood has flowed in armed conflicts between men,
would present a circling splash of red; but the vast island which
is balanced on the Tropic of Capricorn, and spreads her bulk from
the tenth parallel of south latitude to "the roaring forties,"
would show up white in the spacious diagram of carnage. No
foreign foe has menaced her thrifty progress since the British
planted themselves at Port Jackson in 1788; nor have any internal
broils of serious importance interrupted her prosperous
career.</p>
<p>This striking variation from the common fate of peoples is
attributable to three causes. First, the development of a British
civilisation in Australia has synchronised with the attainment
and unimpaired maintenance of dominant sea-power by the parent
nation. The supremacy of Great Britain upon the blue water
enabled her colonies to grow to strength and wealth under the
protection of a mighty arm. Secondly, during the same period a
great change in British colonial policy was inaugurated.
Statesmen were slow to learn the lessons taught in so trenchant a
fashion by the revolt of the American colonies; but more liberal
views gradually ripened, and Lord Durham's Report on the State of
Canada, issued in 1839, occasioned a beneficent new era of
self-government. The states of Australia were soon left with no
grievance which it was not within their own power to remedy if
they chose, and virtually as they chose. Thirdly, these very
powers of self-government developed in the people a signal
capacity for governing and being governed. The constitutional
machinery submitted the Executive to popular control, and made it
quickly sensitive to the public will. Authority and subjects were
in sympathy, because the subjects created the authority. Further,
there was no warlike native race in Australia, as there was in
New Zealand and in South Africa, to necessitate armed conflict.
Thus security from attack, chartered autonomy, and governing
capacity, with the absence of organised pugnacious tribes, have
combined to achieve the unique result of a continent preserved
from aggression, disruption, or bloody strife for over one
hundred and twenty years.</p>
<p>There was a brief period, as will presently be related, when
this happy state of things was in some danger of being disturbed.
It certainly would have been impossible had not Great Britain
emerged victorious from her protracted struggle, first against
revolutionary France, and later against Napoleon, in the latter
years of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the
nineteenth.</p>
<p>In those wars colonial possessions "became pawns in the
game."* There was no Imperialism then, with its strident note,
its ebullient fervour and flag waving. There was no national
sense of pride in colonial Empire, or general appreciation of the
great potentialities of oversea possessions. "The final outcome
of the great war was the colonial ascendancy of Great Britain,
but such was not the conscious aim of those who carried through
the struggle."** Diplomacy signed away with a dash of the quill
possessions which British arms had won after tough fights,
anxious blockades, and long cruises full of tension and peril.
Even when the end of the war saw the great Conqueror conquered
and consigned to his foam-fenced prison in the South Atlantic,
Great Britain gave back many of the fruits which it had cost her
much, in the lives of her brave and the sufferings of her poor,
to win; and Castlereagh defended this policy in the House of
Commons on the curious ground that it was expedient "freely to
open to France the means of peaceful occupation, and that it was
not the interest of this country to make her a military and
conquering, instead of a commercial and pacific nation."***</p>

<p><b>PART 2.</b></p>
<p>The events with which this book is mainly concerned occurred
within the four years 1800 to 1804, during which Europe saw
Bonaparte leap from the position of First Consul of the French
Republic to the Imperial throne. After great French victories at
Marengo, Hochstadt, and Hohenlinden (1800), and a brilliant naval
triumph for the British at Copenhagen (1801), came the fragile
Peace of Amiens (1802)&mdash;an "experimental peace," as
Cornwallis neatly described it. Fourteen months later (May 1803)
war broke out again; and this time there was almost incessant
fighting on a titanic scale, by land and sea, until the great
Corsican was humbled and broken at Waterloo.</p>
<p>The reader will be aided in forming an opinion upon the events
discussed hereafter, by a glance at the colonial situation during
the period in question. The extent of the dependencies of France
and England in 1800 and the later years will be gathered from the
following summary.</p>
<p>In America France regained Louisiana, covering the mouth of
the Mississippi. It had been in Spanish hands since 1763; but
Talleyrand, Bonaparte's foreign minister, put pressure upon
Spain, and Louisiana became French once more under the secret
treaty of San Ildefonso (October 1800). The news of the
retrocession, however, aroused intense feeling in the United
States, inasmuch as the establishment of a strong foreign power
at the mouth of the principal water-way in the country
jeopardised the whole trade of the Mississippi valley. President
Jefferson, recognising that the perpetuation of the new situation
"would have put us at war with France immediately," sent James
Monroe to Paris to negotiate. As Bonaparte plainly saw at the
beginning of 1803 that another war with Great Britain was
inevitable, he did not wish to embroil himself with the Americans
also, and agreed to sell the possession to the Republic for
eighty million francs. Indeed, he completed arrangements for the
sale even before Monroe arrived.</p>
<p>Some efforts had also been made, at Bonaparte's instance, to
induce Spain to give up the Floridas, East and West, but European
complications prevented the exertion of pressure in this
direction; and the whole of Florida became part of the United
States by treaty signed in 1819. The sale of Louisiana lowered
the French flag on the only remaining portion of American
territory that acknowledged the tricolour, except the
pestilential fragment of French Guiana, on the north-east of
South America, where France has had a footing since the beginning
of the seventeenth century, save for a short interval (1809 to
1815) when it was taken by the British and Portuguese. But the
possession has never been a profitable one, and a contemporary
writer, quoting an official publication, describes it as enjoying
"neither agriculture, commerce, nor industry."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Fallot, L'Avenir Colonial de la France (1903)
page 237.)</p>
<p>In the West Indies, France had lost Martinique and Guadeloupe
during the naval wars prior to Bonaparte's ascension to supreme
authority. These islands were restored to her under the Treaty of
Amiens; were once more captured by the British in 1809 to 1810;
and were finally handed back to France under the Treaty of Paris
in 1814. Tobago and St. Lucia, taken from France in 1803, were
not restored.</p>
<p>The large island of San Domingo (the present republic of
Haiti, the Espanola of Columbus, and the first seat of European
colonisation in the west) had been occupied by French, Spanish,
and British planters prior to 1796. The French had been there
officially since Richelieu recognised and protected the
settlements made by filibusters early in the seventeenth century.
The decree of the revolutionary Assembly freeing the slaves in
all French possessions led to widespread insurrections. There
were scenes of frightful outrage; and above the storm of blood
and horror rose to fame the huge figure of the black hero,
Toussaint L'Ouverture. At the head of a negro army he at first
assisted the French to overturn Spanish rule; but having attained
great personal power, and being a man of astonishing capacity for
controlling the people of his own race, and for mastering
military and governmental problems, he determined to use the
opportunity to found an autonomous state under the suzerainty of
France. By January 1801 Toussaint L'Ouverture was in possession
of the capital. But Bonaparte would not tolerate the domination
of the black conqueror, and despatched an expedition to San
Domingo to overthrow his government and establish French
paramountcy. The result was disastrous. It is true that Toussaint
was captured and exiled to France, where he died miserably in
prison at Besancon in 1803; but the white troops under General
Leclerc perished of yellow fever in hundreds; the blacks retired
to the mountains and harassed the suffering French; whilst the
vigilance of British frigates, and the requirements of European
policy, obviated all possibility of effective reinforcements
being sent. Gallic authority in San Domingo ended ingloriously,
for the negroes in 1803 drove the debilitated chivalry of France
in defeat and disaster to the sea, and chose to be their ruler
one who, like themselves, had commenced life as a slave. Napoleon
said at St. Helena that his attempt to subjugate San Domingo was
the greatest folly of his life.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean the French possessed the Isle of France
(now, as a British colony, called Mauritius) and Reunion. They
had not yet established themselves in Madagascar, though there
was some trade between the Mascareignes and the colonists of the
Isle of France. Bonaparte during the Consulate contemplated
making definite attempts to colonise Madagascar, and, early in
1801, called for a report from his first colonial minister,
Forfait. When he obtained the document, he sent it back asking
for more details, an indication that his interest in the subject
was more than one of transient curiosity. Forfait suggested the
project of establishing at Madagascar a penal colony such as the
British had at Port Jackson;* but subsequent events did not
favour French colonial expansion, and nothing was done.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Prentout, L'Ile de France sous Decaen,
302.)</p>
<p>The British captured Pondicherry and the other French
settlements in India in 1793, but agreed to restore them under
the Treaty of Amiens. For reasons which will be indicated later,
however, the territories were not evacuated by British troops,
who continued to hold them till the post-bellum readjustment of
1815 was negotiated.</p>
<p>A similar record applies to Senegal, in West Africa. It had
been French since the era of Richelieu, with intervals of
capture, restoration, and recapture. The British ousted their
rivals once more in 1804, and gave back the conquest in 1815.</p>
<p>A careful examination of these details reveals a remarkable
fact. Although the year 1810 saw the Napoleonic empire at the
crest of its greatness in Europe; although by that time the
Emperor was the mightiest personal factor in world politics;
although in that year he married a daughter of the Caesars, and
thought he had laid plans for the foundation of a dynasty that
should perpetuate the Napoleonic name in association with
Napoleonic power&mdash;yet, in that very year, France had been
stripped of the last inch of her colonial possessions. The nation
in whose glorious Pantheon were emblazoned the great names of
Montcalm and Dupleix, of Jacques Cartier and La Salle, of
Champlain and La Bourdonnais, and whose inveterate capacity for
colonisation of even the most difficult kind can never be doubted
by any candid student of her achievements in this field, both
before and since the disastrous Napoleonic age, was now naked of
even so much as a barren rock in a distant sea upon which to
plant her flag.</p>
<p>Such is the picture of the French colonial system as it
presents itself during the period within which occurred the
events described in this book. These facts give poignancy to the
reflection of the distinguished philosophical historian who has
written of his country: "A melancholy consequence of her policy
of interference in neighbouring states, and of occupying herself
with continental conquests, has always been the loss of her naval
power and of her colonies. She could only establish oversea
possessions on a durable foundation on the condition of
renouncing the policy of invasion that she practised in Europe
during the centuries. Every continental victory was balanced by
the ruin of our naval power and of our distant possessions, that
is to say, the decrease of our real influence in the world."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Leroy-Beaulieu, Colonisation chez les Peuples
Modernes, 1902 edition, 1 220.)</p>
<p><b>PART 3.</b></p>
<p>It would be simple to sum up the colonial situation of Great
Britain in the period under review, by saying that she gained
just in the measure that France lost. But such a crude formula
would not convey a sufficient sense of her actual achievements.
The end of the great war left her with a wider dominion than that
with which she was endowed when she plunged into the struggle;
but it left her also with augmented power and prestige, a settled
sense of security, and a steeled spirit of
resolution&mdash;elements not measurable on the scale of the map,
but counting as immense factors in the government and development
of oversea possessions.</p>
<p>The details of the British colonial empire during the storm
epoch, are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>In Canada she governed a belt of country stretching from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, divided for administrative purposes into
two areas, one of which, Lower Canada&mdash;embracing the cities
of Quebec and Montreal, and including the basin of the St.
Lawrence&mdash;was populated principally by people of French
origin. It would be too much to suppose that these colonists, who
jealously preserved the French language and the French tradition,
were indifferent to the doings of their kin across the water; and
there were, indeed, many who cherished the hope that events would
so shape themselves as to restore the authority of France in this
part of the New World. But the habitant was Roman Catholic as
well as French, and the hierarchy was profoundly distrustful of
the regime which it regarded as the heritage of the hateful ideas
of 1789. We may speculate as to what would have happened if
Napoleon had set himself to woo the affections of the French
Canadians. But throughout the great wars Canada remained loyal to
the British connection, despite internal difficulties and
discontents.</p>
<p>Great Britain also held Newfoundland, as well as those
maritime provinces which have since become federated as part of
the Dominion.</p>
<p>In South America she possessed British Guiana, and for a
period, as related above, French Guiana also.</p>
<p>In the West Indies, in 1800, her flag flew over the entire
crescent of the Windward and Leeward groups from Granada to the
Virgins; she was mistress of Trinidad, Tobago, Jamaica, the
"still vexd" Bermudas and the whole bunch of the Bahamas; and she
had interests in San Domingo. At the Peace of Amiens she retained
only Trinidad of the islands captured during the war; and she
presented no very stubborn resistance to the negro revolt that
lost her any further control over the largest of the sugar
islands.</p>
<p>She had the Cape of Good Hope in her custody in 1800, but
weakly allowed it to be bartered away by diplomacy at Amiens;
only, however, to reassert her power there six years later, when
it became at length apparent to British statesmen&mdash;as it
surely should have been obvious to them throughout&mdash;that
Australia and India could not be secure while the chief southern
harbour of Africa was in foreign possession.</p>
<p>Ceylon was retained as a sparkling jewel for the British crown
when so much that had been won in fair fight was allowed to slip
away. The capture of Java (1811) and its restoration to the Dutch
belong to a later period; whilst the growth of British power in
India scarcely falls within the scope of a brief review of the
colonial situation, though of great importance in its
effects.</p>
<p>Malta, which has usually been classed as a colony, though its
principal value is rather strategic than colonial, was occupied
by the British in September 1800, and the cat-footed efforts of
Napoleonic diplomacy to get her out of the island made it a storm
centre in European politics in these fiery years. Out she would
not come, and did not. Neither Tzar nor Emperor could get her
out, by plot or by arms; and there she still remains.</p>
<p><b>PART 4.</b></p>
<p>The position of the British in the South Seas demands special
consideration, as being immediately related to our subject. In
1800 the only part of Australasia occupied by white people was
Norfolk Island and the small area at Port Jackson shut in between
the sea and a precipitous range of mountains that for thirteen
years to come presented an unconquerable barrier to inland
exploration, despite repeated endeavours to find a way across
them. The settlement had spread only a few miles beyond the spot
where Governor Arthur Phillip had resolved to locate his First
Fleet company twelve years before. As yet no attempt had been
made to occupy Tasmania, which had been determined to be an
island only two years previously. New Zealand also was virgin
ground for the European colonist. The Maori had it all to
himself.</p>
<p>The means of defending the little colony, in the event of an
attack during the war which raged from five years after its
foundation till 1802, and again from 1803 for twelve years more,
were insignificant. The population in 1800 numbered rather more
than five thousand, only about one-half of whom were soldiers,
officials, and free people.* The remainder were convicts, some of
them being Irishmen transported for participation in the
rebellion of 1798, including not a few men of education. These
men were naturally writhing under a burning sense of defeat and
oppression, and were still rebels at heart. They were
incarcerated with a miscellaneous horde of criminals made
desperate and resentful by harsh treatment. It is scarcely
doubtful that if a French naval squadron had descended on the
coast, the authorities would have had to face, not only an
enemy's guns in Port Jackson, but an insurrection amongst the
unhappy people whom the colony had been primarily founded to
chastise. The immigration of a farming and artisan class was
discouraged; and it is scarcely conceivable that, apart from the
officials, the gaolers, and the military, who would have done
their duty resolutely, there were any in the colony who, for
affection, would have lifted a hand to defend the land in which
they lived, and the regime which they hated.</p>
<p class="foot">(* The total population of Sydney, Parramatta,
and Norfolk Island on January 1, 1801, was declared to be 5100,
of whom 2492 were convicts&mdash;1431 men, 500 women, and 561
children. Of the remainder, 1887 were "free people," being
neither on the civil nor the military establishment.)</p>
<p>There was at the Governor's command a small military force,
barely sufficient to maintain discipline in a community in which
there were necessarily dangerously turbulent elements;* but he
was destitute of effective vessels for service afloat. When the
navigator Flinders was wrecked in the Porpoise in August
1803&mdash;his own exploring ship, the Investigator, being by
this time unseaworthy&mdash;Governor King had no other craft to
give him for his return voyage than the decrepit Cumberland, a
mere leaky little barge hardly fit for better uses than ferrying
a placid lake. The colony was, in short, simply a kraal for
yarding British undesirables and housing their keepers; its
remoteness was an advantage for the purpose in view; and it never
seemed to strike the officials in England who superintended its
affairs, that the adequate defence of a gaol against foreign
aggression was an undertaking that called for exertion or
forethought. The unreluctant retrocession of the Cape to the
Dutch in 1800 indicates that the interest of defending Australia
was lost sight of in the midst of what appeared to be more
pressing considerations.</p>
<p class="foot">(* In a report to Governor King, April 1805,
Brevet-Major Johnson pointed out that the military were barely
sufficient for mounting guard, and urged "the great want of an
augmentation to the military forces of this colony" (Historical
Records of New South Wales 6 183). Colonel Paterson, in a letter
to Sir Joseph Banks, 1804, remarked that "it will certainly
appear evident that our military force at present is very
inadequate" (Ibid 5 454). John Blaxland, in a letter to Lord
Liverpool, 1809, wrote that "it is to be feared that if two
frigates were to appear, the settlement is not capable of
opposing any resistance" (Ibid 7 231). An unsigned memorandum in
the Record Office, "bearing internal evidence of having been
written by an officer who was in the colony during the
Governorship of Hunter," pointed out that "a naval force is
absolutely necessary on the coast of New South Wales...to protect
the colony from an attack by the French from the Mauritius, which
would have taken place long ago if the enemy had possessed a
naval force equal to the enterprise" (Ibid 7 248 to 250).)</p>
<p>It has been remarked above that there was a period when the
peace of Australia was imperilled. The danger was obviated,
certainly not because of the efficiency of the defence, but
rather through lack of enterprise on the part of the Admiral in
command of the French squadron in the Indian Ocean. It will be
well to narrate the circumstances, together with an incident
which illustrates in an amusing manner the kind of man this
officer was.</p>
<p>After the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, Bonaparte sent out
a squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Linois, conveying General
Charles Decaen, who was commissioned to administer the former
French possessions in India, which, under the terms of the
treaty, were to be surrendered to France. But when the expedition
arrived at Pondicherry, the Governor-General of India, Lord
Wellesley, gave orders to his subordinates that no concessions
were to be made to the French without his express authority; and
as he stubbornly refused to give his warrant for surrendering an
inch of territory, there was nothing for General Decaen to do but
sail away to Mauritius, then, as already remarked, a French
colony. Lord Wellesley acted under secret orders from the
Secretary of State, Lord Hobart, dated October 17, 1802, only
seven months after the treaty was signed, for the British
Government did not believe in the permanency of the peace and did
not desire the French to re-assert a footing in India, where
their presence, in the event of a renewal of hostilities, would
be dangerous.</p>
<p>When the war was renewed, Linois, with his squadron, was still
in the Indian Ocean. The Isle of France was not a self-supporting
colony, but had to depend on money and supplies obtained either
from Europe or from the vessels of the East India Company, which,
from time to time, were captured by French privateers and
men-of-war. When Nelson shattered the naval power of France at
Trafalgar in 1805, and vigilant British frigates patrolled the
whole highway of commerce from Europe to the Cape of Good Hope,
Decaen's position became precarious. The supplies sent out to him
were frequently captured by the enemy; and had it not been that
Port Louis became a regular nest of adventurous French
privateers&mdash;"pirates," the British called them&mdash;who
frequently found a rich prey in the shape of heavily laden India
merchantmen, his garrison must soon have been starved out.</p>
<p>The incident to which reference has been made occurred in
1804, and is probably without a parallel in naval history as an
example of the effect of audacity acting on timidity. It was
known that a convoy of ships belonging to the East India Company
was to leave Canton early in the year. Linois, with five vessels,
including his flagship, the Marengo, 74 guns, sailed for the
Straits of Malacca to intercept them. On February 14, near Polo
Aor, to the north-east of Singapore, the French sighted the
convoy, sixteen Company ships, fourteen merchantmen and a brig,
all laden with tea, silks, and other rich merchandise.</p>
<p>The East India Company's vessels carried guns, but they were
not equipped for facing heavily armed men-of-war. Their crews
were not trained fighting men; they were deeply laden, and their
decks were heavily cumbered. Moreover, they were not protected by
a naval squadron; and had Rear-Admiral Linois been a commander of
daring, initiative, and resource, the greater part, or the whole,
of this enormous mass of floating treasure might have fallen like
a ripe peach into his hands.</p>
<p>But he had to contend with an English sailor of astounding and
quite picturesque assurance in Nathaniel Dance, the commodore of
the fleet. Dance fully expected, when he left Canton, that he
would meet French raiders, though he was astonished when he saw
five sail under the tricolour bearing up towards him. But he had
thought out what he intended to do if attacked; and, partly by
courage, partly by a superb piece of "bluff," he succeeded
completely.</p>
<p>Before sailing, the Company ships had been freshly painted.
Their gun embrasures showed up more fearsome to the eye of
imagination than they were in reality. Dance also carried blue
ensigns, which were hoisted on four of his craft when the French
made their appearance. He resorted to this device with the
deliberate purpose of making the strongest vessels of his convoy
look like British men-of-war. In fact, he commanded a fleet of
opulent merchantmen, the best of which, by the mere use of
brushes and pots of paint, and by the hoisting of a few yards of
official bunting, were made to resemble fighting ships. But,
wonder of wonders! this scarecrow strategy struck terror into the
heart of a real Rear-Admiral, and, as a French historian somewhat
lugubriously, but quite candidly, acknowledges: "Les ruses de
Dance reussirent; les flammes bleues, les canons de bois, les
batteries peintes, produisirent leur effet."</p>
<p>No sooner did the French squadron appear, than Dance drew up
his convoy in two lines, with the fifteen smaller vessels under
the lee of the sixteen larger ones, which presented their painted
broadsides to the foe. It was a manoeuvre which threatened a
determination to fight, and Linois was disposed to be cautious.
He was puzzled by the number of ships, having been informed by an
American captain at Batavia that only seventeen were to leave
Canton. The larger fleet, and the blue ensigns fluttering from
four masts, imbued him with a spirit of reluctance which he
dignified with the name of prudence. As a naval historian puts
it, "The warlike appearance of the sixteen ships, the regularity
of their manoeuvres, and the boldness of their advance, led the
French Admiral to deliberate whether a part of them were not
cruisers."* Linois did not like to attack, as darkness was
approaching, but argued that if the bold face put upon the matter
by the British were merely a stratagem, they would attempt to fly
in the night; in which case he would not hesitate to chase them.
But Dance did nothing of the kind. He had taken his enemy's
measure; or, to quote the French historian again, "il comprit
l'etat moral de son adversaire." He maintained his formation
during the night, keeping blue lights burning on the four ships
which sported the blue ensign, to enforce the illusion that they
were the naval escort of the convoy, and were eager for battle.
In the morning Linois was quite satisfied that he really had to
contend with a fleet pugnaciously inclined, which, if he tried to
hurt them, would probably hurt him more. Cheers broke from the
British decks as the Marengo bore up. Dance then manoeuvred as if
his intention were to shut in the French squadron between two
lines, and rake them on both flanks. This clever movement so
scared the Rear-Admiral that he determined to run. A shot was
fired from his flagship, which killed one man and wounded another
on the Royal George; whereupon the British sailors fired their
guns in return, and kept up a furious, but quite harmless,
cannonade for forty minutes. Not a single French ship was hit;
but under cover of the thick smoke which "the engagement"
occasioned, Linois and his squadron sailed away, and left the
cheering Britons in the peace which they so certainly required,
but had so audaciously pretended that they did not in the least
degree desire.</p>
<p class="foot">(* James, Naval History 3 247. There is a
contemporary account of the incident in the Gentleman's Magazine
(1804) volume 74 pages 963 and 967.)</p>
<p>Dance became temporarily a national hero. The Englishman
enjoys a joke, and at a period of extreme tension the impudent
exploit of the commodore provoked a roar of delighted and
derisive laughter throughout the British Isles. He was feted by
the City of London, knighted by King George, presented with a
sword of honour, and endowed by the Company with a handsome
fortune.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Napoleon was furious. Linois "has made the
French flag the laughing stock of the universe," he wrote to his
Minister of Marine, Decres.* Again he said, "The conduct of
Linois is miserable"; and in a third letter, summing up in a
crisp sentence the cause of so many French failures on the blue
water, he said: "All the maritime expeditions that have been
despatched since I have been at the head of the Government have
failed because our admirals see double, and have found, I do not
know where, that one can make war without running any risks;" "it
is honour that I wish them to conserve, rather than a few wooden
vessels and some men." It was while still smarting under this
same indignity, and urging his Minister to hurry the sending of
ships with supplies for the support of the Isle of France, that
Napoleon made one of his most famous retorts. Decres, with the
obsequiousness of a courtier, had written that if the Emperor
insisted on ordering certain ships to be despatched, "I should
recognise the will of God, and should send them." "I will excuse
you from comparing me to God," wrote Napoleon; and, prodding the
dilatory Minister again to make haste, he wrote, "You can surely,
to meet the needs of our colonies, send from several ports
vessels laden with flour. There is no need to be God for
that!"**</p>

<p class="foot">(** Correspondance, volume 17 document

<p>Now, if instead of the timid Linois, the French squadron in
the Indian Ocean had been commanded by an Admiral endowed with
the qualities of dash, daring, and enterprise, the consequences
to the weak little British settlement at Sydney would have been
disastrous. After Trafalgar, British interests in the South and
the East were more amply safeguarded. But before that great
event, Linois had magnificent opportunities for doing mischief.
Port Jackson would have been a rich prize. Stores, which the Isle
of France badly needed, could have been obtained there
plentifully. Ships from China frequently made it a port of call,
preferring to take the route through the recently discovered Bass
Straits than to run the hazard of capture by crossing the Indian
Ocean. It was just a lucky accident that the enemy's admiral was
a nervous gentleman who was afraid to take risks. General Decaen,
a fine soldier, openly cursed his nautical colleague; but nothing
could strike a spirit of vigorous initiative into the breast of
Linois. He was always afraid that if he struck he would be struck
at&mdash;in which view he was undoubtedly right.</p>
<p>Did Napoleon himself realise that there was so rich a prize in
Port Jackson? Not until it was too late. In 1810, when he was
fitting out another expedition for aggressive service in the
Indian Ocean, he probably remembered what he had read in
P&eacute;ron's account of the Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres
Australes about the British colony there, and directed that the
new squadron should "take the English colony of Port Jackson,
which is to the south of the Isle of France, and where
considerable resources will be found" ("faire prendre la colonie
anglaise de Jackson"&mdash;sic),*But the task was well-nigh
hopeless then, and the squadron never sailed. Probably it would
not have reached the Indian Ocean if it had left Europe, for the
Cape, which was in Dutch hands when Linois had his great chance,
was recaptured by the British in January 1806. In 1810 Admirals
Pellew and Bertie were in command of strong British forces, and
Lord Minto, the Governor-General of India, was determined to root
the French out of the Isle of France, and clear India of danger
from that source. They succeeded, and Mauritius has been British
ever since.</p>

<p>On April 7, 1802, His Majesty's ship Investigator, 334 tons,
Commander Matthew Flinders, was beating off the eastern extremity
of Kangaroo Island, endeavouring to make the mainland of Terra
Australis, to follow the course of discovery and survey for which
she had been commissioned. The winds were very baffling for
pursuing his task according to the carefully scientific method
which Flinders had prescribed for himself. He had declared to Sir
Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, before he left
England, that he would endeavour so to explore the then unknown
coasts of the vast island for which he himself afterwards
suggested the name Australia, "that no person shall have occasion
to come after me to make further discoveries."* This principle of
thoroughness distinguished his work throughout the voyage.
Writing thirteen years later, after the long agony of his
imprisonment in Mauritius, he said that his "leading object had
been to make so accurate an investigation of the shores of Terra
Australis, that no future voyage to the country should be
necessary" for the purpose; and that had not circumstances been
too strong for him, "nothing of importance should have been left
for future discoverers upon any part of these extensive
coasts."** Nobody can study Flinders' beautiful charts without
recognising them as the work of a master of his craft; and so
well did he fulfil his promise, until the debility of his ship
and a chain of misfortunes interposed to prevent him, that the
Admiralty charts in current use are substantially those which
Flinders made over a hundred years ago.***</p>

Records of New South Wales 4 351.)</p>

<p class="foot">(*** Sir J.K. Laughton in Dictionary of National
Biography 19 328.)</p>
<p>His method, though easy enough to pursue in a modern steamer,
comparatively indifferent to winds and currents, was one
demanding from a sailing ship hard, persistent, straining work,
with unflagging vigilance and great powers of endurance. It was
this. The Investigator was kept all day so close along shore that
the breaking water was visible from the deck, and no river mouth
or inlet could escape notice. When the weather was too rough to
enable this to be done with safety, Flinders stationed himself at
the masthead, scanning every reach of the shore-line. "Before
retiring to rest," he wrote, "I made it a practice to finish the
rough chart for the day, as also my astronomical observations and
bearings." When darkness fell, the ship hauled off from the
coast, and every morning, as soon after daylight as possible, she
was brought in-shore again, great care being taken to resume the
work at precisely the point where it was suspended the night
before. "This plan," he wrote, "to see and lay down everything
myself, required constant attention and much labour, but was
absolutely necessary to obtaining that accuracy of which I was
desirous."</p>
<p>Before Flinders reached Kangaroo Island, he had, in this
painstaking manner, discovered and mapped the stretch of coast
westward from the head of the Great Australian Bight, charted all
the islands, and, by following the two large gulfs, Spencer's and
St. Vincent's, to their extremities, had shattered the theory
commonly favoured by geographers before his time, that a passage
would be found cleaving the continent from the Gulf of
Carpentaria to the Strait which George Bass had discovered in
1798.* With these passages may be compared the following from
Kerr's General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels,
published in 1824, ten years after the appearance of Flinders'
book: "There are few voyages from which more important accessions
to geographical knowledge have been derived than from this voyage
of Captain Flinders, especially when we reflect on the great
probability that New Holland...[observe that Kerr had not adopted
the name Australia, which Flinders suggested only in a footnote]
will soon rank high in population and wealth. Before his voyage
it was doubtful whether New Holland was not divided into two
great islands, by a strait passing between Bass Straits and the
Gulf of Carpentaria. Captain Flinders has put an end to all
doubts on this point. He examined the coast in the closest and
most accurate manner; he found, indeed, two great openings; these
he sailed up to their termination; and consequently, as there
were no other openings, and these were mere inlets, New Holland
can no longer be supposed to be divided into two great islands.
It must be regarded as forming one very large one; or rather,
from its immense size, a species of continent" (Kerr 18
462).)</p>
<p class="foot">(* Pinkerton, in his Modern Geography (1807)
volume 2 588, published after Flinders had made his principal
discoveries, but before the results were known, reflected the
general opinion in the passage: "Some suppose that this extensive
region, when more thoroughly investigated, will be found to
consist of two or three vast islands, intersected by narrow
seas." The Committee of the Institute of France, which drew up
the instructions for the expedition commanded by Baudin, directed
him to search for a supposed strait dividing Australia
longitudinally into "two great and nearly equal islands"
(P&eacute;ron, Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes 1
5.)</p>
<p>That part of the southern coast of Australia lying between
Cape Leeuwin and Fowler Bay, in the Bight, had been explored
prior to Flinders' time, partly by Captain George Vancouver, one
of Cook's men, in 1791, and partly in 1792 by the French
commander, Bruni Dentrecasteaux, who was despatched in search of
the gallant La Perouse&mdash;"vanished trackless into blue
immensity."* Flinders carefully revised what they had done,
commencing his elaborate, independent survey immediately after
the Investigator made the Leeuwin, on December 6, 1801. He had
therefore been just four months in this region, when he left his
anchorage at Kangaroo Island&mdash;four months of incessant daily
and nightly labour diligently directed to the task in hand.
Always generous in his praise of good work, he paid a warm
tribute to the quality of the charts prepared by Beautemps
Beaupre, "geographical engineer" of La Recherche,
Dentrecasteaux's corvette. "Perhaps no chart of a coast so little
known as this is, will bear a comparison with its original better
than this of M. Beaupre," he said; and though he put forward his
own as being fuller in detail and more accurate, he was careful
to point out that he made no claim for superior workmanship, and
that, indeed, he would have been open to reproach if, after
having followed the coast with Beaupre's chart in hand, he had
not effected improvements where circumstances did not permit his
predecessor to make so close an examination. It is an attractive
characteristic of Flinders, that he never missed an opportunity
of appreciating valuable service in other navigators.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Carlyle, French Revolution book 2 cap 5.)</p>
<p>But from the time when the Investigator passed the head of the
Bight, the whole of the coast-line traversed was virginal to
geographical science. With a clean sheet of paper, Flinders began
to chart a new stretch of the earth's outline, and to link up the
undiscovered with the known portions of the great southern
continent. Our interest in his work is intensified by the
reflection that of all the coasts of the habitable earth, this
was the last important portion still to be discovered. True it is
that research in the arctic and antarctic circles remained to be
pursued, and still remains. Man will not cease his efforts till
he knows his planet in its entirety, though the price of the
knowledge may be high. But when he has compassed the extreme ends
of the globe, he will not have found a rood of ground upon which
any one will ever wish to live. The earth lust of the nations is
not provoked by thoughts of the two poles. Ruling out the frozen
regions, therefore, as places where discovery is pursued without
thought of future habitation, it is a striking fact that this
voyage of Flinders opened up the ultimate belt of the earth's
contour hitherto unknown. The continents were finally unveiled
when he concluded his labours. Europe, the centre of direction,
had comprehended the form of Asia, had encircled Africa, had
brought America within ken and control. It had gradually pieced
together a knowledge of Australia, all but the extensive area the
greater part of which it was left for Flinders to reveal. The era
of important modern coastal discovery within habitable regions,
which commenced with the researches directed by Prince Henry the
Navigator from 1426 to 1460, and attained to brilliancy with
Columbus in 1492 and Vasco da Gama in 1497, ended with Flinders
in 1802 and 1803. He ranges worthily with that illustrious
company of "men full of activity, stirrers abroad, and searchers
of the remote parts of the world," of whom Richard Hakluyt
speaks, and is outshone by none of them in the faithfulness with
which his work was done, and in all the qualities that make up
the man of high capacity and character entrusted with a great
enterprise.</p>
<p>When Flinders was appointed to the command of the
Investigator, he was only twenty-seven years of age. But he had
already won distinction by his demonstration that Bass Strait was
a strait, and not a gulf, a fact not proved by George Bass's
famous voyage from Sydney to Westernport in a whale-boat. His
circumnavigation of Tasmania&mdash;then called Van Diemen's
Land&mdash;in the Norfolk; the discovery of the Tamar estuary and
Port Dalrymple; some excellent nautical surveying among the
islands to the north-west of Tasmania; and an expedition along
the Queensland coast, had also earned for him the confidence of
his official superiors. His ardour for discovery, and the exact,
scientific character of his charts and observations, won him a
powerful and steadfast friend in Sir Joseph Banks, who had been
with Cook in the Endeavour in 1768 to 1771, and never lost his
interest in Australian exploration. At the beginning of his naval
career Flinders had tasted the "delights of battle." As a
midshipman on the Bellerophon (Captain Pasley), he played his
small part on the "glorious first of June" (1794), when "Black
Dick," Lord Howe, won his greatly vaunted victory over the French
off Brest.</p>
<p>But before this event his tastes and aspirations had set in
the direction of another branch of the naval service. A voyage to
the South Seas and the West Indies under Bligh, in the
Providence, in 1791, had revealed to his imagination the glory of
discovery and the vastness and beauty of the world beyond
European horizons. The fame and achievements of Cook were still
fresh and wonderful in the mouths of all who followed the sea.
Bligh, a superb sailor&mdash;not even the enemies whom he made by
his rough tongue and brusque manner denied that&mdash;taught him
to be a scientific navigator; and when he threaded the narrow,
coral-walled waters of Torres Strait, he knew that to the
southward were coasts as yet unmarked on any chart, seas as yet
unploughed by any keel. For this work of exploration Flinders
nourished a passion as intense as that which inferior natures
have had for love, avarice, or honours. It absorbed all his life
and thought; and opportunity, becoming in his case the handmaid
of capacity, was abundantly justified by accomplishment.</p>
<p>There is one striking fact which serves to "place" Flinders
among navigators. As has just been observed, he learnt his
practical navigation under Bligh, on that historically
unfortunate captain's second bread-fruit expedition, when he was
entrusted with the care of the scientific instruments. Now, Bligh
had perfected his navigation under Cook, on the Resolution, and
actually chose the landing-place in Kealakeakua Bay, where the
greatest English seaman who ever lived was slain. Here is a
school of great sailors: Cook the master of Bligh, Bligh the
master of Flinders; and Flinders in turn had on board the
Investigator as a midshipman, his cousin, John Franklin, to whom
he taught navigation, and who acquired from him that "ardent love
of geographical research" which brought him immortal fame, and a
grave amongst the ice-packs and the snows of the North-West
Passage.* There is nothing comparable with this direct succession
of illustrious masters and pupils in the history of navigation.
The names of all four are indelibly written on the map of the
world. Three of them&mdash;Cook, Flinders, and Franklin&mdash;are
among our very foremost navigators and discoverers, men whom a
race proud of the heritage of the sea will for ever hold in
honour and affection; whilst the fourth, Bligh, though his
reputation is wounded by association with two mutinies, was in
truth a daring and a brilliant seaman, and a brave man in a
fight. Nelson especially thanked him for noble service at
Copenhagen, and his achievement in working a small, open boat
from the mid-Pacific, where the mutinous crew of the Bounty
dropped him, through Torres Strait to Timor, a distance of 3620
miles, stands memorably on the credit side of his account.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Markham, Life of Sir John Franklin page 43
and Traill, Life of Franklin page 16. Traill's graceful sentences
are worth transcribing: "The example of the fine seaman and
enthusiastic explorer under whom he served must indeed, for a lad
of Franklin's ardent temperament, have been an education in
itself. Throughout his whole life he cherished the warmest
admiration for the character of Matthew Flinders, and in later
years he welcomed the opportunity of paying an enduring tribute
to his old commander's memory in the very region of the world
which his discoveries had done so much to gain for civilisation."
It is pleasant to find Flinders speaking cordially of his young
pupil in a letter written during the voyage. "He is a very fine
youth, and there is every probability of his doing credit to the
Investigator and himself.")</p>
<p>See what it meant to have been trained in a school that
observed the rules and respected the traditions of James Cook.
When at the end of his long voyage of nine months and nine days,
Flinders took the Investigator through Port Jackson heads into
harbour (Sunday, May 9, 1802), he had not a sick man on board.*
His crew finished hearty, browned, and vigorous. He was able to
write from the Cape of Good Hope that "officers and crew were,
generally speaking, in better health than on the day we sailed
from Spithead, and not in less good spirits." Scrupulous
attention to cleanliness and hygiene produced this result in an
age when scurvy was more to be feared than shipwreck. On every
fine day the decks below and the cockpit were washed, dried with
stoves, and sprinkled with vinegar. Care was taken to prevent the
crew from sleeping in wet clothes. At frequent intervals beds,
chests, and bags were opened out and exposed to the sweetening
influences of fresh air and sunshine. Personal cleanliness was
enforced. Lime-juice and other anti-scorbutics were frequently
served out: a precautionary measure which originated in Cook's
day, and which down to our own times has caused all British
sailors to be popularly known as "lime-juicers" in the American
Navy. The dietary scale and the cooking were subjects of careful
thought. This keen young officer of twenty-seven looked after his
company of eighty-seven people with as grave and kindly a concern
as if he were a grey-bearded father to them all; and was
liberally rewarded by their affection. During his imprisonment in
Mauritius, one of his men stayed with him voluntarily for several
years, enduring the unpleasantness of life in confinement far
away from home, out of sheer devotion to his commander; and did
not leave until Flinders, becoming hopeless of liberation,
insisted on his taking advantage of an opportunity of going to
England.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage 1 226.)</p>
<p>There is a touching proof of Flinders' tender regard for his
men in the naming of a small group of islands to the west of the
bell-mouth of Spencer's Gulf. A boat's crew commanded by the
mate, John Thistle, was drowned there, through the boat
capsizing. Thistle was an excellent seaman, who had been one of
Bass's whale-boat crew in 1798, and had volunteered for service
with the Investigator. Not only did Flinders name an island after
him, and another after a midshipman, Taylor, who perished on the
same occasion, but he gave to each of the islands near Cape
Catastrophe the name of one of the seamen who lost their lives in
the accident. In a country where men are valued for their native
worth rather than on account of rank or wealth, such as is
happily the case to a very large degree in Australia&mdash;and
this is a far finer thing than mere political
democracy&mdash;perhaps nothing in the career of Flinders is more
likely to ensure respect for his memory, apart from the value of
his achievements, than this perpetuation of the names of the
sailors who died in the service.</p>
<p>Throughout the voyage he promoted amusements among his people;
"and when the evenings were fine the drum and fife announced the
forecastle to be the scene of dancing; nor did I discourage other
playful amusements which might occasionally be more to the taste
of the sailors, and were not unseasonable."* The work may have
been strenuous, and the commander was unsparing of his own
energies; but the life was happy, and above all it was healthy.
The pride which Flinders had in the result was modestly
expressed: "I had the satisfaction to see my people orderly and
full of zeal for the service in which we were engaged." Really,
it was a splendid achievement in itself, and it showed that, if
the hardship of life in a small ship, on a long voyage, could not
be abolished, at least horror could be banished from it.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage 1 36.)</p>
<p>Compare this genial record with that of the French exploring
ships Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste, which were quite as well
equipped for a long voyage. They had, it is true, been longer at
sea, but they had an advantage not open to Flinders in being able
to refit at Mauritius, had rested again for some weeks at Timor,
and had spent a considerable time in the salubrious climate of
southern Tasmania, where there was an abundance of fresh food and
water. When, on June 23, 1802, Le Geographe appeared off Port
Jackson, to solicit help from Governor King, it was indeed "a
ghastly crew" that she had on board. Her officers and crew were
rotten with scurvy. Scarcely one of them was fit to haul a rope
or go aloft. Out of one hundred and seventy men, only twelve were
capable of any kind of duty, and only two helmsmen could take
their turn at the wheel. Not a soul aboard, of any rank, was free
from the disease.* Of twenty-three scientific men and artists who
sailed from Havre, in 1800, only three returned to France with
the expedition, and before its work was over the Commander,
Baudin, and several of the staff were dead. The chief naturalist,
Francois P&eacute;ron, and one of the surgeons, Taillefer, have
left terrible accounts of the sufferings endured. Putrid water,
biscuits reduced almost to dust by weevils, and salt meat so
absolutely offensive to sight and smell that "the most famished
of the crew frequently preferred to suffer the agonies of hunger"
rather than eat it&mdash;these conditions, together with neglect
of routine sanitary precautions, produced a pitiable state of
debility and pain, that made the ship like an ancient city
afflicted with plague. Indeed, the vivid narratives of Thucydides
and Boccaccio, when they counted:</p>
<blockquote>"the sad degrees<br>
Upon the plague's dim dial, caught the tone<br>
Of a great death that lay upon the land,"</blockquote>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron, Voyage de Decouvertes 1 331 to
340; Flinders, Voyage 1 230.)</p>
<p>are not more haggard in their naturalism than is Taillefer's
picture of the sufferings of the sailors to whom he ministered.
Their skin became covered with tumours, which left ugly black
patches; where hair grew appeared sores "the colour of wine
lees"; their lips shrivelled, revealing gums mortified and
ulcerated. They exhaled a breath so fetid in odour that Taillefer
loathed having to administer to them such remedies as he had to
give; and at one part of the voyage even his stock of drugs was
depleted, so great was the demand upon his resources. Their
joints became stiff, their muscles flaccid and contracted, and
the utter prostration to which they were reduced made him regret
that they retained so much of their intellectual faculties as to
make them feel keenly the weight of despair.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 1 340.)</p>
<p>When Le Geographe stood outside Sydney Harbour, a boat's crew
of Flinders' bluejackets from the Investigator, themselves fresh
from their own long voyage, had to be sent out to work her into
port. So enfeebled were the French sailors that they could not
even muster sufficient energy to bring their vessel to the place
where succour awaited them. While we deplore this tale of
distress, we can but mark the striking contrast with the English
vessel and her jolly crew. Truly, it meant something for a
commander to have learnt to manage a ship in a school nourished
on the example of Cook, whose title to fame might rest on his
work as a practical reformer of life at sea, even if his
achievements as a discoverer were not so incomparably
brilliant.</p>
<p>We must now return to the Investigator, which, at the
commencement of the chapter, we left fighting with a contrary
wind east of Kangaroo Island. Although the sloop quitted her
anchorage early on the morning of April 7, at eight o'clock in
the evening she had made very little headway across Backstairs
Passage. On the 8th, she was near enough to the mainland for
Flinders to resume his charting, and late in the afternoon of
that day occurred an incident to which the next chapter will be
devoted. Meanwhile, it is important to observe that had the wind
blown from the west or south-west, instead of from the east or
south-east, Flinders would have accomplished the survey of the
coast between Cape Jervis, at the entrance of St. Vincent's Gulf,
and Cape Banks, before the French discovery ship, Le Geographe,
emerged from Bass Strait on her voyage westward. The wind that
filled Captain Baudin's sails, and drove his ship forward towards
the seas in which the Investigator was making important
discoveries, was the wind that delayed Flinders at Kangaroo
Island. Had the weather been more accommodating to the English
captain and less to the French, there cannot be the slightest
doubt that even the fifty leagues of coast, or thereabouts, which
are all that can be claimed to have been discovered by Baudin,
would have been first charted by Flinders. But the French
expedition was so unfortunate, both as to results and
reputation&mdash;so undeservedly unfortunate, in some respects,
as will be shown in later chapters&mdash;that this small measure
of success may be conceded ungrudgingly. It is, indeed, somewhat
to be regretted that the small part of the Australian coast which
was genuinely their own discovery, should not have been in a more
interesting region than was actually the case; for the true
"Terre Napoleon" is no better for the most part than a sterile
waste, with a back country of sand, swamp, and mallee scrub,
populated principally by rabbits, dingoes, and bandicoots.</p>

Bay.<br>

Second interview: Baudin inquisitive.<br>
Baudin's account of his explorations.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 8,* the man at the masthead of the
Investigator reported a white rock ahead. He was mistaken.
Glasses were turned towards it, and as the distance lessened it
became apparent that the white object was a sail. The sloop was
at this time in latitude 35 degrees 40 minutes south, longitude
138 degrees 58 minutes east. To meet another vessel in this
region, many leagues from regular trading routes, in a part of
the world hitherto undiscovered, was surprising. The Investigator
stood on her course, and as the strange ship became more clearly
defined it was evident that she was making towards the British
sloop. Flinders therefore "cleared for action in case of being
attacked."</p>
<p class="foot">(* In his manuscript journal, which was used by
the Quarterly reviewer of the first volume of the Voyage de
Decouvertes, in August 1810, Flinders gave the date on which he
met Le Geographe as April 9th (Quarterly Review volume 4 52). But
there is no contradiction. In his journal Flinders gave the date
of the nautical day, which commenced at noon. As he met Baudin's
corvette in the late afternoon, it was, by nautical reckoning,
April 9th. But by the calendar, the civil day commencing at
midnight, the date was April 8th, as stated by Flinders in his
published volumes, by both P&eacute;ron and Louis de Freycinet,
and in the log of Le Geographe. A similar difference of dates,
which puzzled Labilliere in writing his Early History of Victoria
1 108, occurs as to the first sighting of Port Phillip by
Flinders. It is explained in exactly the same way.)</p>
<p>He knew that the French Government had sent out ships having
like objects with his own; he knew that some influential persons
in England, especially the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, were uneasy and suspicious about French designs; and he
had been fully instructed by the Admiralty as to the demeanour he
should maintain if he met vessels flying a hostile flag. But
though his duty prescribed that he must not offer any
provocation, he could not forget that when he left Europe Great
Britain and France were still at war, and preparation for
extremities was a measure of mere prudence.</p>
<p>The stranger proved to be "a heavy-looking ship without any
top-gallant masts up." On the Investigator hoisting her colours,
Le Geographe "showed a French ensign, and afterwards an English
jack forward, as we did a white flag." Flinders manoeuvred so as
to keep his broadside to the stranger, "lest the flag of truce
should be a deception." But the demeanour of the French being
purely pacific, he had a boat hoisted out and went on board, Le
Geographe having also hove to.</p>
<p>On the French vessel, meanwhile, similar curiosity had been
provoked as to the identity of the ship sailing east. Captain
Baudin's men had been engaged during the morning in harpooning
dolphins, which they desired for the sake of the flesh.
P&eacute;ron, in his narrative, waxes almost hysterically joyous
about the good fortune that brought along a school of these fish
just as the ship's company were almost perishing for want of
fresh food. They appeared, he says, like a gift from Heaven.*
Unlike the bronzed and healthy crew of the Investigator, the
company on Le Geographe were suffering severely from scurvy. The
virulence of the disease increased daily. They were rejoicing at
the capture of nine large dolphins, which would supply them with
a feast of fresh meat, when the look-out man signalled that a
sail was in sight.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* "Cette peche heureuse nous parut comme un
bienfait du ciel. Alors, en effet, le terrible scorbut avoit
commence ses ravages, et les salaisons pourries et rongees de
vers auxquelles nous etions reduits depuis plusieurs mois
precipitoient chaque jour l'affreux developpement de ce fleau."
Voyage de Decouvertes 1 323.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Mr. T. Ward, in his Rambles of an Australian
Naturalist (1907) page 153, relates that in 1889 he harpooned a
large dolphin, Grampus gris, in King George's Sound, and that
whalers told him that dolphins were at one time common in the
Bight, in schools of two and three hundred. As to dolphin flesh
as food, the reader may like to be reminded that Hawkins's men,
in 1565, found dolphins "of very good colour and proportion to
behold, and no less delicate in taste" (Hakluyt's Voyages edition
of 1904 10 61). So also in 1705 a voyager to Maryland related the
capture of dolphins, "a beautiful fish to see...it is also a good
fish to eat." "Narrative of a Voyage to Maryland," printed from
manuscript in American Historical Review 12 328.)</p>
<p>At first it was considered that the ship was Le Naturaliste,
the consort of Le Geographe, the two vessels having become
separated in a storm off the Tasmanian coast. But as the
Investigator steered towards the French and hoisted her flag, the
mistake was corrected.</p>
<p>Flinders took Brown, the naturalist, with him on board,
because he was a good French scholar; but Captain Baudin spoke
English "so as to be understood," and the conversation was
therefore conducted for the most part in that language. Brown was
the only person present at the first interview on the 8th, and at
the second on the following morning;* both taking place in the
French captain's cabin. P&eacute;ron, in the first volume of the
Voyage de Decouvertes, wrote as though he were present and heard
what occurred between the two commanders. "En nous fournissant
tous ces details M. Flinders se montre d'une grande reserve sur
ses operations particulieres," he wrote; and again: "apres avoir
converse plus d'une heure avec nous." But his testimony in this,
as in several other respects, is not reliable. Baudin wrote no
detailed account of the conversations, nor did Brown; but
Flinders related what occurred with the minute care that was
habitual with him. P&eacute;ron's evidence is at best
second-hand, and he supplemented it with such information as
could be elicited by "pumping" the sailors in Flinders' boat.**
Even then he blundered, for some of the things stated by him were
not only contrary to fact, but could not have been ascertained
from Baudin, from Flinders, or from the sailors.</p>
<p class="foot">(* "No person was present at our conversations
except Mr. Brown" (Flinders, Voyage 1 190). Robert Brown was a
very celebrated botanist. Humboldt styled him "botanicorum facile
princeps." His Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae is a classic of
price.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** "Nous apprimes toutefois par quelques-uns de
ses matelots qu'il avoit eu beaucoup a souffrir de ces memes
vents de la partie du Sud qui nous avoient ete si favorables."
The boatmen were not questioned by P&eacute;ron himself, who at
this time could not speak English (Freycinet, Voyage de
Decouvertes 2 Preface page 17). Freycinet admits that
P&eacute;ron was not present at the interviews, but says that
Baudin related what took place with "more or less exactitude."
But as Freycinet was not present himself either at the interviews
or on the ship when Baudin related what occurred, how could he
know that the version of the commander&mdash;at whom, after
Baudin's death, he never missed an opportunity of
sneering&mdash;was merely "more or less" exact?)</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron stated, for example, that Flinders said that he
had been accompanied from England by a second vessel, which had
become separated from him by a violent tempest. There had been no
second vessel, and Flinders could have made no such assertion.
Again, P&eacute;ron wrote that Flinders said that, hindered by
contrary winds, he had not been able to penetrate behind the
islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, in Nuyts Archipelago.
Flinders made no such absurd statement. He had followed the coast
behind those islands with the utmost particularity. His track,
with soundings, is shown on his large chart of the section.* Once
more, P&eacute;ron stated that Flinders said that he had lost a
boat and eight men in the same gale as had endangered the French
ships in Bass Strait. Flinders had lost John Thistle, an officer
to whom he was deeply attached, and a crew of eight men off Cape
Catastrophe, but the incident occurred during a sudden squall.
Moreover, Thistle and his companions were drowned on February 21,
whilst the storm in the Strait&mdash;as Baudin told
Flinders&mdash;occurred exactly a month later.</p>
<p class="foot">(* On this statement the Quarterly reviewer of
1810 bluntly wrote: "Now, we will venture not only to assert that
all this is a direct falsehood (for we have seen both the journal
and charts of Captain Flinders, which are fortunately arrived
safe in this country), but also to pledge ourselves that no such
observations are to be found either in Captain Baudin's journal
or in the logbook of the Geographe." Quarterly Review 4 52. It
was a good guess. No such observation is contained in the printed
log of Le Geographe.)</p>
<p>When Flinders got on board Le Geographe, he was received by an
officer, of whom he inquired for the commander. Baudin was
pointed out to him, and conducted him and Brown into the
captain's cabin. Flinders then "requested Baudin to show me his
passport from the Admiralty, and when it was found, and I had
perused it, I offered him mine from the French marine minister,
but he put it back without inspection." The incident serves to
remind us that both commanders believed their nations to be at
war at this time. As a matter of fact, just a fortnight before
the meeting in Encounter Bay, diplomacy had patched up the
brittle truce ironically known as the Peace of Amiens (March 25).
But neither Flinders nor Baudin could have known that there was
even a prospect of the cessation of hostilities. Europe, when
they last had touch of its affairs, was still clanging with
battle and warlike preparations, and the red star of the Corsican
had not yet reached its zenith. Baudin's readiness to produce his
own passport when "requested"&mdash;in a style prompt if not
peremptory, it would seem&mdash;and his indifference about that
of the English commander, should be noted as the first of a
series of facts which establish the purely peaceful character of
the French expedition.</p>
<p>Baudin talked freely about the work upon which he had been
engaged in Tasmanian waters. Flinders inquired concerning a large
island said to lie in the western entrance of Bass
Strait&mdash;that is, King Island&mdash;but Baudin "had not seen
it and seemed to doubt much of its existence." As a matter of
fact, Le Geographe had sailed quite close to the island, as
indicated on the track-chart showing her course, and that it
should have been missed indicated that the look-out was not very
vigilant. Curiously enough, too, Baudin marked down on his chart,
presumably as the result of this inquiry of Flinders, an island
"believed to exist," but he put it in the wrong place.</p>
<p>An incident that appealed to Flinders' dry sense of humour
occurred in reference to a chart of Bass Strait which Baudin had
with him. This chart was one which had been drawn from George
Bass's sketch by Flinders himself, and incorporated with his own
more scientific chart of the north coast of Tasmania and the
adjacent islands. Bass had traversed, in his whale-boat, the
southern coast of Victoria as far as Westernport, but not being a
surveyor he had furnished only a rough outline of the lay of the
shore. Up to this time Baudin had not inquired the name of the
commander of the Investigator, and it was from not knowing to
whom he was talking that he fell into a blunder which the
politeness, native to a French gentleman, would certainly have
made him wish to avoid. He began to criticise the chart, finding
great fault with the north side, but commending the drawing of
the south&mdash;that is, of northern Tasmania and the islands
near it. "On my pointing out a note upon the chart explaining
that the north side of the Strait was seen only in an open boat
by Mr. Bass, who had no good means of fixing either latitude or
longitude, he appeared surprised, not having before paid
attention to it. I told him that some other and more particular
charts of the Strait and its neighbourhood had since been
published, and that if he would keep company until next morning I
would bring him a copy, with a small memoir belonging to them.
This was agreed to, and I returned with Mr. Brown to the
Investigator."</p>
<p>On the following morning Flinders and Brown again visited Le
Geographe with the promised chart. At the conclusion of this
second interview, Baudin requested that, should the Investigator
fall in with Le Naturaliste, Flinders would inform her captain
that it was his intention to sail round to Port Jackson as soon
as the bad weather set in. "On my asking the name of the captain
of Le Naturaliste, he bethought himself to ask mine, and finding
it to be the same as the author of the chart which he had been
criticising, expressed not a little surprise, but had the
politeness to congratulate himself on seeing me." In a letter to
Banks, Flinders said that Baudin "expressed some surprise at
meeting me, whom he knew by name."* He had the name, of course,
upon Flinders' chart of 1799.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* Historical Records of New South Wales 4
755.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** The new chart which Flinders gave to Baudin
was published after Le Geographe left Havre. The chart which he
had in his possession was the one advertised in the Moniteur on
8th Vendemiaire, Revolutionary Year 10. (September 30, 1800):
"Nouvelle carte du detroit de Basse, situe entre la Nouvelle
Galles Meridionale, a la Nouvelle Hollande, lequel separe ces
deux parties; avec la route du vaisseau qui l'a parcouru et
partie de la cote a l'est de la Nouvelle Hollande, levee par
Flinders. Prix deux francs." This chart had been reproduced by
the French Department of Marine from the one published by
Flinders in England in 1799, and several copies of it had been
supplied to Baudin and his officers for the use of the
expedition, though it was also offered for sale. See the
Moniteur, 27 Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11 (August 15, 1803),
as to the engraving of the chart at the French depot for the use
of the expedition.)</p>
<p>At the second interview Baudin was more inquisitive than he
had been on the previous day. He had then been more disposed to
talk about his own discoveries in southern Tasmania than to ask
questions about the Investigator's work. "It somewhat surprised
me," said Flinders, "that Captain Baudin made no inquiries
concerning my business upon this unknown coast, but as he seemed
more desirous of communicating information I was happy to receive
it." Another of the inaccuracies of P&eacute;ron is that "M.
Flinders showed a great reserve concerning his particular
operations." There was no need of reserve, and none was shown.
But "tact teaches when to be silent," as Disraeli's Mr. Wilton
observed; and an occasion for the exercise of this virtue is
presented when information likely to be valuable is being given.
Reflection, and what his officers had been able to learn from
Flinders' boat crew, however, had stimulated Baudin's curiosity.
On the 9th, therefore, he asked questions. Flinders, so far from
maintaining reserve, readily explained the discoveries he had
made, and furnished Baudin with some useful information for his
own voyage. He described how he had explored the whole of the
south coast as far as the place of meeting;* related how he had
obtained water at Port Lincoln by digging in the clay; pointed
out Kangaroo Island across the water, where an abundance of fresh
meat might be procured; "told him the name I had affixed to the
island," in consequence of the marsupials shot there; and "as
proof of the refreshment to be obtained at the island, pointed to
the kangaroo skin caps worn by my boat's crew." The return made
for this courtesy was that upon the Terre Napoleon maps the name
Flinders gave was ignored, and "L'Ile Decres" was scored upon it,
this being done while the true discoverer was pent up in French
custody in an island of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Manuscript Journal.)</p>
<p>The most interesting statement made by Baudin will be dealt
with in the next chapter. The two commanders conversed on the 8th
for about half an hour, and on the second occasion, when Flinders
presented the new chart of Bass Strait, for a shorter period.
Early on the morning of the 9th they bade each other adieu.
Flinders returned to the Investigator, and the two ships sailed
away&mdash;the French to retrace the coast already followed by
Flinders, but to find nothing that was new, because he had left
so little to be found; the English to proceed, first to King
Island and Port Phillip, and then through Bass Strait to Port
Jackson, where the two commanders met again.</p>

<p>One statement made by Captain Baudin to Flinders has been

examination.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* The more so as the conflict of evidence to be
pointed out seems to have escaped the notice of writers on
Australian history. The contradictions are not observed in
Bonwick's Port Phillip Settlement, in Rusden's Discovery, Survey,
and Settlement of Port Phillip, in Shillinglaw's Historical
Records of Port Phillip, in Labilliere's Early History of
Victoria, in Mr. Gyles Turner's History of the Colony of
Victoria, nor in any other work with which the author is
acquainted.)</p>
<p>He gave an account of the storm in Bass Strait which had
separated him from Le Naturaliste on March 21, and went on to say
that "having since had fair winds and fine weather, he had
explored the south coast from Westernport to our place of meeting
without finding any river, inlet, or other shelter which afforded
anchorage." In his report to the Admiralty, dated May 11, 1802,
Flinders related what Baudin told him on this point, in the
following terms, which it is worth while to compare with those
used by him in his book, quoted above: "Captain Baudin informed
me that after parting with the Naturaliste in the Strait, in a
heavy gale, he had had fine weather, and had kept the coast close
on board from Westernport to the place of meeting, but that he
had found no bay or place where a vessel could anchor, the coast
having but few bights in it, and those affording nothing to
interest." It will be seen that the official report and the
account given to the public twelve years later are in close
agreement. The important fact to be noticed is that Le Geographe
had slipped past Port Phillip without observing the entrance, and
that her captain was at this time entirely ignorant of the
existence of the harbour which has since become the seat of one
of the greatest cities in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p><b>ADMIRALTY CHART OF ENTRANCE TO PORT PHILIP</b></p>
</center>
<p>Now this statement, which is sufficiently surprising without
the introduction of complicating contradictions, becomes quite
mysterious when compared with the accounts given by Lieutenant
Louis de Freycinet and Francois P&eacute;ron, the joint authors
of the official history of the French voyage. It is astonishing
in itself, because a vessel sent out on a voyage of exploration
would not be expected to overlook so important a feature as Port
Phillip. Here was not a small river with a sandbar over its
mouth, but an extensive area of land-locked sea, with an opening
a mile and a half wide, flanked by rocky head-lands, fronted by
usually turbulent waters, at the head of a deep indentation of
the coast. The entrance to Port Phillip is not, it must be
acknowledged, so easy to perceive from the outside as would
appear from a hasty examination of the map. If the reader will
take a good atlas in which there is a map of Port Phillip, and
will hold the plate in a horizontal position sufficiently below
the level of the eye to permit the entrance to be seen ALONG the
page, he will look at it very much as it is regarded from a ship
at sea.* It will be noticed that a clear view into the port,
except from a particular angle, is blocked by the land on the
eastern side (Point Nepean) overlapping the tongue of land just
inside the port on the western side (Shortland's Bluff). Not
until a vessel stands fairly close and opposite to the entrance,
so that the two lighthouses on the western side, at Queenscliff,
"open out," can the passage be discerned.** Indeed, a pilot of
much experience has assured the writer that ships, whose captains
know the port, are sometimes seen "dodging about" (the phrase is
the pilot's) looking for the entrance. Yet it may be allowed that
if Le Geographe had sailed close in, with the shore on her
starboard quarter, and the coast had been examined with care, she
would hardly have missed the port; and, her special business
being exploration, she certainly ought not to have missed
it.***</p>
<p class="foot">(* A reduced copy of the Admiralty chart of the
entrance (1907) is prefixed to this chapter. The reader can
perform the experiment with that.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Ferguson, Sailing Directions for Port
Phillip, 1854&mdash;he was harbour-master at the time&mdash;says
(page 9): "Vessels having passed Cape Schanck should keep a good
offing in running down towards the entrance until they open out
the lighthouses, WHICH ARE NOT SEEN BEFORE BEARING NORTH 1/2 EAST
OWING TO THE HIGH LAND OF POINT NEPEAN INTERVENING." Findley,
Navigation of the South Pacific Ocean, 1863, has a remark about
the approach to the port from the west: "In approaching Port
Phillip from the westward, the entrance cannot be distinguished
until Nepean Point, the eastern point, bears north-north-east,
when Shortland's Bluff, on which the lighthouses are erected,
opens out, and a view of the estuary is obtained." A Treatise on
the Navigation of Port Phillip, by Captain Evans (a pilot of
thirty-six years' experience), has also been consulted.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** In Appendix B, at the end of this chapter,
are given quotations from the journals of Murray and Flinders, in
which they record how they first saw the port.)</p>
<p>But although Baudin said he had seen nothing "to interest,"
both P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, in their volumes&mdash;published
years later, after they had learnt of the discovery of Port
Phillip by Lieutenant John Murray in January 1802&mdash;stated
that it was seen from Le Geographe on March 30. P&eacute;ron
wrote that shortly after daybreak, the ship being in the curve of
the coast called Baie Talleyrand on the Terre Napoleon
maps&mdash;that is, between Cape Schanck on the eastern side of
Port Phillip heads, and Cape Roadknight on the western
side&mdash;the port was seen and its contours were distinguished
from the masthead.* P&eacute;ron did not say that he saw it
himself. He merely recorded that it was seen. Freycinet did not
see it himself either. He was at this time an officer on Le
Naturaliste, and was not on the Terre Napoleon coasts at all
until the following year, when he penetrated St. Vincent's and
Spencer's Gulfs. He, without indicating the time of day, or
stating that the port was merely viewed from aloft, asserted that
the entrance was observed, though the ship did not go inside.</p>
<p class="foot">(* The matter is sufficiently important to
justify the quotation of the passages in which P&eacute;ron and
Freycinet recorded the alleged observation, and these are given
at length in Appendix A to this chapter.)</p>
<p>In the first place, the statements of P&eacute;ron and
Freycinet are not in agreement. To observe the entrance was one
thing; to trace the contours from the masthead quite another. To
do the first was quite possible, though not, as will be shown,
from any part of the route indicated on the track-chart of Le
Geographe. But to distinguish the contours of Port Phillip from
outside, over the peninsula, was not possible.</p>
<p>Here, at all events, is a sharp conflict of evidence. We must
endeavour to elicit the truth.</p>
<p>It is certain that Baudin had no motive for concealing his
knowledge, if he knew of the existence of Port Phillip when he
met Flinders. Had his cue been to prefer claims on account of
priority of discovery, he would have been disposed to make his
title clear forthwith. Frankness, too, was an engaging
characteristic of Baudin throughout. He was evidently proud of
what his expedition had already done, and was, as Flinders wrote,
"communicative." Had he discovered a new harbour, he would have
spoken about it jubilantly. Moreover, as Flinders explained to
him how he could obtain fresh water at Port Lincoln, a
fellow-navigator would surely have been glad to reciprocate by
indicating the whereabouts of a harbour in which the Investigator
might possibly be glad to take shelter on her eastern course.</p>
<p>It is also clear that Flinders did not misunderstand Baudin.
He was an extremely exact man, and as he said that he was
"particular in detailing all that passed," we may take it that
one with whom precision was something like a passion would be
careful not to misunderstand on so important a point. Brown, too,
was with him, a trained man of science, who would have been quick
to correct his chief in the event of a misapprehension. Flinders
so far relied on Baudin's statement that when, on April 26, he
sighted Port Phillip heads himself, he thought he was off
Westernport, which his friend George Bass had discovered in 1798.
"It was the information of Captain Baudin which induced this
supposition," he wrote.* It was not till he bore up and took his
bearings that he saw that he could not be at Westernport; and he
then congratulated himself on having made "a new and useful
discovery"&mdash;unaware, of course, that Murray had found Port
Phillip in the Lady Nelson in the previous January.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See also the entry in his journal, Appendix
B.)</p>
<p>It must be noted in addition that Baudin wrote a letter to
Jussieu, the distinguished French botanist and member of the
Institute, nine months later, in which he gave an account of his
voyage up to date.* Therein he said not a word about seeing Port
Phillip, nor did he allude to the possibility of there being a
harbour between Westernport and Encounter Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Printed in the Moniteur, 22 Fructidor,
Revolutionary Year 11. (September 9, 1803).)</p>
<p>Baudin, then, knew nothing about Port Phillip when he met
Flinders on April 8. But if somebody else saw it from the
masthead on March 30, why was not the fact reported to the
commander? Why was he not asked the question whether so large a
bay should be explored? Again, if Le Geographe did sight Port
Phillip, why did she not enter it? Here was a magnificent chance
for discoverers. They were necessarily unaware of Murray's good
fortune in January. As far as their knowledge could have gone,
the port was absolutely new to geography. If we believe
P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, surely these were the most negligent
explorers who ever sailed the seas.* But if we believe that
Baudin spoke the truth to Flinders&mdash;and the absence of all
reference to the port in his letter to Jussieu is alone
sufficient to show that he did&mdash;what shall we say of the
statements of P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, written after Baudin's
death, after they had learnt of Murray's discovery, and when they
had set themselves the task of making the work of the expedition
appear as important as possible?</p>
<p class="foot">(* It is true that Cook did not enter Port
Jackson when he discovered and named it on May 6, 1770. But
exploration, it must always be remembered, was not the primary
object of the voyage of the Endeavour, as it was of Le Geographe.
Cook, when he achieved the greatest extent of maritime discovery
made at one time by any navigator in history, was simply on his
way homeward from a visit to Tahiti, the primary purpose of which
was to enable astronomers to observe the transit of Venus. Cook,
too, made a record of the latitude and longitude of Port Jackson.
No such entry was made by the French relative to Port Phillip, as
will presently be shown.)</p>
<p>Now, Baudin's statement is confirmed by five documents, the
testimony of which is convincing.</p>
<p>1. As an appendix to volume 3 of the Voyage de Decouvertes aux
Terres Australes, is printed the entire log of Le Geographe. The
entry for March 30, 1802* (9th Germinal, Year 10 in the
revolutionary calendar, which is printed parallel with the
ordinary dates), is latitude 38 degrees 33 minutes south,
longitude 142 degrees 16 minutes east. The reckoning is from the
meridian of Paris, not of Greenwich.) The situation when the
entry was made, presumably at noon, was about midway between
Lorne and Apollo Bay, off the coast leading down in a
south-westerly direction to Cape Otway. The winds were east,
east-north-east, south-east, and east-south-east; weather very
fine; a fresh wind blowing ("joli frais; beau temps"). It was the
wind which was hindering Flinders, sailing in the opposite
direction. The column for "Remarques" opposite this date was left
blank. In other places where anything remarkable was
seen&mdash;even such a thing as a striking sunset&mdash;it was
duly entered in the proper place. But there was no entry relative
to seeing Port Phillip from the masthead, or observing the
entrance, at any time. Baudin is corroborated by the ship's
log.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Page 499.)</p>
<p>2. There is also appended to volume 3 of the same work a table
of geographical positions as calculated by the ship's officers.
The situation of Cape Schanck (Cap Richelieu on the French map)
and of Ile des Anglois (Phillip Island) are given; and next in
the list comes Cap Desaix (Cape Otway).* There is no record of a
latitudinal and longitudinal reading between these points. That
is to say, the position of Port Phillip is not indicated at all.
In this case also the column for "Remarques" is blank. Can we
believe that if the port had been observed, no attempt would have
been made to fix the situation of it? The latitudes and
longitudes of some quite unimportant features of the coast were
duly noted. Here was a large bay, and not the slightest reference
was made to it in the table. The inevitable inference is that the
French saw nothing worth recording between Cape Schanck and Cape
Otway. Baudin is corroborated by the table of "positions
geographiques."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Page 544.)</p>
<p>3. The atlas issued with the first volume of the Voyage de
Decouvertes in 1807 contained several coloured plates of views of
coasts traversed by Le Geographe. The work of the artists
accompanying the expedition was very beautiful; some of the
plates have rarely been excelled in atlases of this kind. These
coast sketches, like narrow ribbons, prettily tinted, were done
from the deck of the ship, and represented the aspect of the
shore-line from seaward. The coasts of Bass Strait were duly
represented, but there was a gap between the Schanck and the
Otway sides of Port Phillip. Why? Obviously because the ship was
not near enough to the coast to enable the artists to see it
clearly. Can we believe that men whose particular task it was to
depict the coasts traversed, would have missed the picturesque
gateway of Port Phillip if they had seen it? Baudin is
corroborated by the atlas.</p>
<p>4. The Moniteur of July 2, 1808, contained a long article by
Lieutenant Henri de Freycinet&mdash;elder brother of
Louis&mdash;reviewing the work of the expedition, on the occasion
of the publication of P&eacute;ron's first volume. Now, Henri de
Freycinet was Baudin's first lieutenant on Le Geographe. If Port
Phillip was seen from that ship on March 30, he should have seen
it if Baudin did not. If the captain was ill, or asleep, Henri de
Freycinet would be in charge. But in his article, though he
described the discoveries claimed to have been made with
particular regard to the so-called Terre Napoleon coasts, he made
no reference to Port Phillip. Baudin is corroborated by his chief
officer.</p>
<p>5. Lastly, when Captain Hamelin returned to Europe with Le
Naturaliste in 1803, Bonaparte's official organ, the Moniteur,
published an article on the voyage from information supplied
partly by him and partly contained in despatches.* Referring to
Baudin's voyage along the "entierement inconnues" southern coasts
of Australia, the article said that he first visited Wilson's
Promontory (which it called Cap Wilson), and then advanced along
the coast till he met Captain Flinders. No reference was made to
seeing any port, although if one had been seen by any one on
board Le Geographe, it surely would have been mentioned with some
amount of pride in an official despatch.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 27 Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11
(August 15, 1803).)</p>
<p>As has already been said, Freycinet was not with Le Geographe
on this voyage, and therefore knew nothing about it personally.
But before the publication of the official history was completed,
P&eacute;ron died. Baudin was also dead. Freycinet, who was
preparing the maps, was instructed to finish the work. He
therefore wrote up from the notes and diaries of other members of
the expedition a geographical description of the coasts
traversed. His general plan, when describing coasts with which he
had no personal acquaintance, was to acknowledge in footnotes the
particular persons on whose notes he relied for his descriptions.
But it is a singular circumstance that when he came to describe
this part of the coast of Terre Napoleon, and to repeat, with an
addition, P&eacute;ron's statement that Port Phillip was seen on
March 30, he gave no footnote or reference. In whose diary or
notes was that fact recorded? It was not in the ship's log, as we
have seen. Who, then, saw Port Phillip from Le Geographe? Henri
de Freycinet did not; Baudin did not; P&eacute;ron did not; Louis
de Freycinet was not there. If it were seen by a look-out man,
did no officer, or scientist, or artist on board, take the
trouble to look at it, or to make a note about it, or a drawing
of it? What singular explorers these were!</p>
<p>We must examine Freycinet's story a little more closely. He is
not content with saying, as P&eacute;ron had done, that the port
was seen from the masthead. He is more precise&mdash;he, the man
who was not there. He says: "Nous en avons observe l'entree."
That is more than P&eacute;ron, who was there, had claimed. If
the "entrance" to Port Phillip was "observed" on March 30, still
more incomprehensible is it that the ship did not enter, that the
fact was not mentioned in the log, that the latitude and
longitude were not taken, and that the artists neglected so
excellent an opportunity.</p>
<p>But that is not all. Freycinet, the man who was not there, and
whose narrative was not published till thirteen years after the
voyage, has further information to give us. He states, on whose
authority we are not told, that the country observed along part
of this coast, between Cap Suffren and Cap Marengo (that is,
between Cape Patton and Cape Franklin), presented "un aspect
riant et fertile." The book containing these descriptive words
was, the reader will recollect, published in 1815. Now, Flinders'
volumes, A Voyage to Terra Australis, were published in 1814.
There he had described the country which he saw from inside the
port as presenting "a pleasing and in many places a fertile
appearance." "Un aspect riant et fertile" and "a pleasing and
fertile appearance" are identical terms. It may be a mere
coincidence, though the comparison of dates is a little
startling. All the words which one can use are, as Boileau said,
"in the dictionaries"; every writer selects and arranges them to
suit his own ideas. But when Flinders said that the country
around Port Phillip looked "pleasing and fertile," he had seen it
to advantage. On May 1 he had climbed Station Peak, one of the
You-Yang group of mountains, and saw stretched at his feet the
rich Werribee Plains, the broad miles of fat pastures leading
away to Mount Macedon, and the green rolling lands beyond
Geelong, opening to the Victorian Western District. In May the
kangaroo-grass would be high and waving, full of seed, a wealth
of luxuriant herbage, the value of which Flinders, a country-bred
boy, would be quick to appreciate. On the other side of the bay
he had climbed Arthur's Seat at the back of Dromana, saw behind
him the waters of Westernport which Bass had discovered, and
traced the curve of the coast as far into the blue distance as
his eye could penetrate. He had warrant for saying that the
country looked "pleasing and fertile." But how did Freycinet come
to select those words, "un aspect riant et fertile"? He was not
there himself, and, as a matter of probability, it seems most
unlikely that such terms would occur to a person who was there,
either as applicable to the lands near Points Nepean and
Lonsdale, with their bastions of rock and ramparts of sand, or to
the scrubby and broken coast running down to Cape Otway, which,
as a matter of fact, is not fertile, except in little patches,
and, even after half a century of settlement, does not look as if
it were. The conclusion is hardly to be resisted that Freycinet
thought he was safe in appropriating, to describe land seen from
seaward, terms which Flinders had employed to describe land seen
inside the port.</p>
<p>Three additional facts strengthen the conviction that Port
Phillip was never seen from Le Geographe, but that the statements
of P&eacute;ron and Freycinet were made to cover up a piece of
negligence in the exploration of these coasts. The French, on
their maps, lavishly bestowed names on the capes, bays, and other
features of the coasts seen by them. More will be said on this
subject in the next chapter. But meanwhile it is important to
notice that they gave no names to the headlands at the entrance
to Port Phillip, which are now known as Point Lonsdale and Point
Nepean. If they saw the entrance on March 30, why did they lose
the opportunity of honouring two more of their distinguished
countrymen, as they had done in naming Cap Richelieu (Schanck),
Cap Desaix (Otway), Cap Montaigne (Nelson), Cap Volney (Moonlight
Head), and so many other features of the coast? It is singular
that while they named some capes that do not exist&mdash;as, for
instance, Cap Montesquieu, to which there is no name on modern
maps to correspond, and no projection from the coast to which it
can be applicable&mdash;they left nameless these sharp and
prominent tongues of rock which form the gateway of Port Phillip.
But if they knew nothing about the port until they learnt of its
existence later at Sydney, and saw no chart of it till an English
chart was brought to their notice, the omission is
comprehensible.</p>
<p>Another fact which must not escape notice is that the French
charts show two lines of soundings, one along the inside of the
Nepean peninsula, and a shorter one towards the north. Mud Island
is also indicated. How did they get there? It was not even
pretended in the history of the voyage that Le Geographe went
inside the heads. But see how the story grew: (a) Baudin saw no
port; (b) P&eacute;ron says the port was seen from the masthead;
(c) Freycinet says the entrance was seen; (d) on the charts there
are actually soundings shown inside the harbour. Further
consideration will be given to these soundings in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>The reader who has carefully followed the argument so far,
will probably have come to the conclusion that Captain Baudin's
statement to Flinders was perfectly true, and that the assertions
of P&eacute;ron and Freycinet which, if veracious, would make Le
Geographe the second ship that ever saw Port Phillip&mdash;cannot
be accepted. One other fact will clinch the case and place the
conclusion beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In 1812 Freycinet published a large folio volume of charts.
The sixth chart in the book is most valuable for our purpose. It
is called a "Carte generale du Detroit de Bass." Its importance
lies in the fact that by means of a dotted line it marks the
track of Le Geographe throughout her course. Now, this
track-chart shows clearly that the ship was never, at any moment,
nearer than six or seven miles to Port Phillip heads. On the
greater part of her course across the so-called Baie Talleyrand
she was much farther from the land than that. On no part of her
course would it have been possible for a person at the masthead
to see either the entrance to Port Phillip or any part of the
port itself. It shows that the ship, while steering across from
Cape Schanck in the direction of Cape Otway, diverted a few miles
to the north-west, and then abruptly turned south-west. From any
part of this course, the stretch of coast where Port Phillip
heads are would present the appearance of an unbroken wall of
rock, the gap being covered by the overlapping land on the
western side. The sudden north-westerly diversion, and then the
sharp turn south-west, seem to indicate that Baudin thought it
well to sail up to see if there was anything worth examining at
the head of the bight, and concluded that there was not.</p>
<p>There can be no more authoritative opinion on the possibility
of doing what P&eacute;ron and Freycinet claimed was done, than
that of a member of the Port Phillip pilot service. The pilot
steamer is almost incessantly on duty in what the French chose to
call Baie Talleyrand. The pilots know the ground intimately; they
are familiar with every part of the coast; they see it in all
weathers; they observe the entrance under all conditions of light
and atmosphere. Wishing, therefore, to confirm an opinion already
adequately supported, the writer showed two large photographed
copies of two of Freycinet's charts to an experienced member of
the pilot service, and asked him whether it would have been
possible for Port Phillip to be seen from the situation
indicated, or anywhere in the vicinity, under any conceivable
conditions. He at once replied that it was utterly impossible.*
Even if Le Geographe had sailed close along shore, he further
observed, nothing like the contour of the port shown on
Freycinet's chart could have been drawn from the masthead; and
the track-chart shows that the ship's course was several miles
from the coast. In fact, the chart shows more than could have
been seen if the French had sailed close up to the heads and
looked inside.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Indeed, he promptly said, in the direct,
emphatic speech which is the special privilege of sailors: "The
man who said he saw Port Phillip or the entrance from any point
in that neighbourhood would be lying.")</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron's statement&mdash;which is not confirmed by
Freycinet&mdash;that it had at first been determined to call the
port "Port du Debut,"* is also rather puzzling. "Du Debut" of
what? The eastern extremity of the region marked "Terre Napoleon"
on Freycinet's charts is Wilson's Promontory, and the real "Port
Du Debut" of the territory so designated would be, if there is
any relation between words and things, not Port Phillip but
Westernport.** Was there some confusion in P&eacute;ron's mind as
to what port was seen? Unquestionably Le Geographe did sight
Westernport. Was it originally Baudin's intention to ignore
Bass's discovery of 1798, and, giving a French name to every
feature of the coast in Terre Napoleon, to call Westernport "Port
du Debut"? That would not have been an appropriate name for Port
Phillip had it really been seen on the morning of March 30, as it
most certainly was not. But, it being determined to denominate
the land between Wilson's Promontory and Cape Adieu "Terre
Napoleon," Westernport might well have been counted as the port
of the beginning of the exploration of the territory, and, as
such, it would truly have been the Port du Debut. Freycinet,
writing in 1824, acknowledged that P&eacute;ron, "having written
before the charts were finished, made some mistakes relative to
geography."*** It is possible that this was one of his errors;
and it would be an easy one for a man to make who was not
familiar with the coast. But assuredly there was no mere error on
Freycinet's part.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Appendix A to this chapter.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** In the Moniteur article of 27th Thermidor,
Revolutionary Year 11, Wilson's Promontory is referred to as the
point of departure: "Il visita d'abord le cap Wilson, d'ou il
prit son point de depart, et s'avanca vers l'ouest en suivant la
cote jusqu'a la distance de 15 degres de longitude.")</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Preface to the second edition of the Voyage
de Decouvertes (1824) 1 page 16.)</p>
<p>What, then, are we to make of the statements of P&eacute;ron
and Freycinet?</p>
<p>The latter officer tells us, in one of his prefaces, that the
French Government was dissatisfied with the work of the
expedition, and was at first disposed to refuse to publish any
record of it. Sir Joseph Banks, closely in touch with movements
relative to scientific work, had news of the displeasure of
Napoleon's ministers, and wrote to Flinders, then a prisoner: "M.
Baudin's voyage has not been published. I do not hear that his
countrymen are well satisfied with his proceedings" (June 1805).
Finally it was determined to issue a history of the expedition;
but to have published any charts without showing Port Phillip
would have been to make failure look ridiculous. By this time
Freycinet, who was preparing the charts, knew of the existence of
the port. The facts drive to the conclusion that the French had
no drawing of Port Phillip of their own whatever, but that their
representation of it was copied from a drawing of which
possession had been acquired&mdash;how? It is quite clear that
Freycinet had to patch up the omissions in the work of his
companions from some source, to hide the negligent exploration
which had missed one of the two most important harbours in
Australia. We shall hereafter see how he did it.</p>
<p><b>APPENDIX A.</b></p>
<p>The following are the two passages from P&eacute;ron and
Freycinet to which reference is made in the text. P&eacute;ron
wrote (Voyage de Decouvertes 1 316): "Le 30 mars, a la pointe du
jour, nous portames sur la terre, que nous atteignimes bientot.
Un grand cap, qui fut appele Cap Richelieu [it is now Cape
Schanck] se projette en avant, et forme l'entree d'une baie
profonde, que nous nommames Baie Talleyrand. Sur la cote
orientale de cette baie, et presque vers son fond, se trouve un
port, dont on distinguoit assez bien les contours du haut des
mats; nous le designames sous le nom de Port du Debut; mais ayant
appris dans la suite qu'il avoit ete reconnu plus en detail par
le brick Anglois The Lady Nelson, et qu'il avoit ete nomme Port
Philipp [sic] nous lui conserverons avec d'autant plus de plaisir
ce dernier nom, qu'il rappelle celui du fondateur d'une colonie
dans laquelle nous avons trouve des secours si genereux et si
puissans."</p>
<p>Freycinet wrote (Voyage de Decouvertes 3 115): "Nous venons de
vanter la beaute du port Western; mais celui que l'on rencontre a
peu de distance vers l'O ne paroit pas moins recommandable, tant
par son etendue que par commodite. Nous en avons observe l'entree
le 30 mars 1802, sans toutefois penetrer dans son interieur. Les
Anglois, qui l'ont examine avec details, lui ont donne le nom de
Port Phillip en l'honneur du premier gouverneur de la colonie du
Port Jackson...Vers l'interieur on voit de hautes montagnes;
elles se rapprochent du rivage a la hauteur du Cap Suffren; et de
ce point jusqu'au cap Marengo, la cote, plus elevee encore, est
d'un aspect riant et fertile."</p>
<p><b>APPENDIX B.</b></p>
<p>The reader may find it convenient to have appended also, the
passages from the journals of Murray and Flinders, in which they
record their first view of Port Phillip. These journals were used
by Labilliere in writing his Early History of Victoria (1 78 and
110). Murray's was then at the Admiralty; it is now in the Public
Record Office. That of Flinders was placed at the disposal of
Labilliere by the distinguished grandson of the explorer,
Professor Flinders Petrie, whose great work in revealing to us
moderns an ampler knowledge of the oldest civilisations, those of
Syria and Egypt, is not a little due, one thinks, to capacity
inherited from him who revealed so much of the lands on which the
newest of civilisations, that of Australia, is implanted.</p>
<p>Murray, in the Lady Nelson, sailing close along-shore west
from Westernport on January 5, 1802, saw a headland bearing
west-north-west distant about twelve miles, and an opening in the
land that had the appearance of a harbour north-west ten or
twelve miles. When within a mile and a half, he wrote: "With
closer examination of my own, and going often to the masthead, I
saw that the reef did nearly stretch across the whole way, but
inside saw a fine sheet of smooth water of great extent. From the
wind blowing on this shore, and fresh, I was obliged to haul off
under a press of sail to clear the land, but with a determination
to overhaul it by and by, as no doubt it has a channel into it,
and is apparently a fine harbour of large extent." Murray did not
enter the port until after his mate, Bowen, had found the way in,
with a boat, in February.</p>
<p>Flinders, after visiting King Island, resumed his work along
the mainland on April 25. He wrote in his journal: "Until noon no
idea was entertained of any opening existing in this bight; but
at that time an opening became more and more conspicuous as we
ran farther west, and high land at the back appeared to be at a
considerable distance. Still, however, I entertained but little
hopes of finding a passage sufficiently deep for a ship, and the
bearings of the entrance prevented me from thinking it the west
entrance into Westernport." In the journal, as in the report to
the Admiralty, and, twelve years later, in his book, Flinders
wrote that it was what Baudin told him that made him think there
could be no port in the neighbourhood. "From appearances I at
first judged this port to be Westernport, although many others
did not answer; though Captain Baudin had met with no harbour
after leaving that, and from his account he had fine weather and
kept the shore close on board to the time of his meeting us."</p>

<p>What happened to Matthew Flinders when, after a brief sojourn
in Sydney Harbour, he left to continue his explorations in the
northern waters of Australia, is generally known. While he was at
work in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the condition of the
Investigator caused him much uneasiness, and when she was
overhauled, the rotten state of her timbers compelled him to
return. She was then condemned as unseaworthy. On again sailing
north in the Porpoise, he was wrecked on the Barrier Reef. Making
his way back to Sydney in a small open boat built from the
wreckage, and well named the Hope, he was given the use of the
Cumberland, a mere barge of only twenty-nine tons, in which to
carry himself and part of his shipwrecked company to England.
Compelled by the leaky condition of the crazy little craft, and
the inefficiency of the pumps, to put into Mauritius, then a
French possession, he was detained as a prisoner by the French
governor, General Decaen, for six and a half years.</p>
<p>There is no need, for our immediate purpose, to linger over
these occurrences, inviting as they are, with a glint of
Stevensonian romance in the bare facts, and all the pathos that
attaches to the case of a brave and blameless man thwarted and
ruined by perversity and malignity. Frequently have the facts
been wrongly written, as for instance when Blair states, in his
Cyclopaedia of Australia, that Baudin in Le Geographe called at
Mauritius after Flinders was imprisoned, and, instead of
procuring his release, "persuaded the Governor to confine him
more rigorously." Poor Baudin&mdash;he had been in his grave
three months when Flinders appeared at the island in dire
distress, and Le Geographe itself left the day before his
arrival.</p>
<p>What is clear, however, is that Flinders was detained in a
captivity that broke down his health and wrecked his useful life,
first on General Decaen's own responsibility, and
later&mdash;though the evidence on this point is not
specific&mdash;in accordance with influences from Paris; and that
during his imprisonment an attempt was made to deprive him of
credit for his discoveries by the publication of the first volume
of the French official history and its accompanying atlas.</p>

<p><b>MAP OF TERRE NAPOL&Eacute;ON</b><br>
<b>From Freycinet's Atlas, 1808.</b></p>
</center>
<p>The atlas published in 1807* contained two large charts, the
work of Lieutenant Louis de Freycinet. The first was a "Carte
generale de la Nouvelle Hollande," with the title inscribed upon
a scroll clutched in the talons of an imperial eagle, a most
fearsome wild-fowl, that with aggressive beak and flaming eye
seemed to assert a claim to the regions denominated on what it
held. This was the most complete map of Australia published up to
the date named. The second was entitled "Carte generale de la
Terre Napoleon." In this case the title was held by feathered
Mercury in graceful flight, displaying the motto "Orbis Australis
dulces exuviae." An exquisite little vignette under the title (by
Lesueur) should not escape notice. Upon both charts, the whole of
southern Australia, from Wilson's Promontory to Cape Adieu in the
Bight, was styled Terre Napoleon. To nearly every cape, bay,
island, peninsula, strait, and gulf in this extensive region was
affixed a name, in most cases, though not in all, that of some
Frenchman of eminence during the revolutionary and Napoleonic
period. The Spencer's Gulf and St. Vincent's Gulf, which Flinders
had discovered, were respectively named Golfe Bonaparte and Golfe
Josephine.** The large island which Flinders had pointed out to
Baudin, and which he informed that officer he had named Kangaroo
Island, became Ile Decres. The Yorke's Peninsula of Flinders was
styled Presqu'Ile Cambaceres; his Investigator Strait became
Detroit de Lacepede; and his Backstairs Passage, Detroit de
Colbert. To-day the Terre Napoleon charts look like a partial
index to the Pantheon and Pere Lachaise. Laplace, Buffon, Volney,
Maupertuis, Montaigne, Lannes, Pascal, Talleyrand, Berthier,
Lafayette, Descartes, Racine, Moliere, Bernadotte, Lafontein,
Condillac, Bossuet, Colbert, Rabelais, D'Alembert, Sully, Bayard,
Fenelon, Voltaire,*** Jeanne d'Arc, L'Hopital, Massena, Turenne,
Jussieu, Murat&mdash;soldiers, statesmen, scientists, authors,
philosophers, adorn with their memorable names these most
un-Gallic shores. The Bonaparte family was pleasantly provided
for. Thus we find the Isles Jerome, Baie Louis and Baie Hortense
(after Josephine's daughter). Outside the Terre Napoleon region,
on the north coast, the name Golfe Joseph Bonaparte bespoke
geographical immortality for another member of the family. But we
miss Rousseau and Turgot, deplore the absence of Corneille and La
Bruyere, and feel that at least a sand-bank or two might have
been found for Quesnay and the economists, if only as a set-off
against the disparagement of Burke.</p>
<p class="foot">(* The date on the imprint of volume 1, though
the charts bear the date 1808. A second part of the atlas,
containing a few additional small charts, was issued in
1811.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** The latter was named "in honour of our august
Empress," said P&eacute;ron. It was a pretty piece of
courtiership; but unfortunately Napoleon's nuptial arrangements
were in a state of flux, and when the trenchant Quarterly
reviewer of 1810 came to discuss the work, the place of Josephine
was occupied by Marie Louise. The reviewer saucily suggested:
"Bonaparte has since changed it for Louisa's Gulf.")</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Voltaire's name is on the Terre Napoleon
sectional chart, but it seems to have been crowded out of the
large Carte Generale. As there is no actual bay in Spencer's Gulf
to correspond with the Baie Voltaire shown on the Terre Napoleon
chart, the omission does not matter much. But one would have
liked to have Voltaire's opinion on the subject of his
exclusion.)</p>
<p>Yet it is on the whole an illustrious company, representative
of the best and brightest in French intellect and character. When
the brave old Spanish navigators of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries discovered a new port or cape, they commonly gave it
the name of the saint on whose day in the calendar it was found;
and the map of Central and South America is a memorial at once of
their piety and their enterprise. But Baudin's expedition having
no such guide&mdash;Comte's Positivist Calendar, if not of later
date, would have been useful&mdash;their selection of names was
quite an original effort. Unfortunately, the "discoveries" to
which the names were applied were not original.</p>
<p>Two facts are incontrovertible: (1) that Flinders had
discovered and charted the whole of the south coast of Australia
from Fowler Bay to Encounter Bay&mdash;except the south of
Kangaroo Island, which is represented by a dotted line on his
charts&mdash;before he met Le Geographe on April 8, 1802; and (2)
that the French officers knew that he had done so. Flinders
explained to Baudin the discoveries which he had made when they
met in Encounter Bay, and afterwards when the Investigator and
the French ships lay together in Port Jackson he showed him one
of his finished charts to illustrate what he had done. "So far
from any prior title being set up at that time to Kangaroo Island
and the parts westward," wrote Flinders, "the officers of the
Geographe always spoke of them as belonging to the
Investigator."</p>
<p>The French names would appear to have been applied by Baudin,
if Freycinet is to be believed; for he uses the phrase "les
nommes que Baudin a donnes."* But when Freycinet wrote those
words Baudin was dead, and the publication of the charts had
evoked much indignation on account of the gross wrong done to
Flinders. In one or two cases the names were certainly not
Baudin's, as will be made clear in a later chapter.** Certainly
Baudin was in no sense responsible for the publication.
P&eacute;ron and Freycinet were the men who put their names to
the charts and volumes; and they were by no means exculpated by
the suggestion that Baudin devised a nomenclature calculated to
deprive Flinders of the credit that he had won. Both P&eacute;ron
and Freycinet knew, too, when they issued their volume and atlas,
that Flinders was being held in captivity in Mauritius; and the
dead captain was certainly not guilty of the meanness and
mendacity of hurrying forward the issue of books that pretended
to discoveries never made, while the real discoverer was
prevented from asserting his own rightful claims.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 2 Preface page 23.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Take, for instance, Ile Decres, the name
given to Kangaroo Island. Decres did not become Minister for the
Navy till October 3, 1801. Baudin was then at sea, and probably
never knew anything about Decres' accession to office. It is
pretty well certain that the name was not given to the island
until after the return of the expedition, when Baudin was
dead.)</p>
<p>That the publication was hurried forward as soon as Napoleon's
government gave the order to print, is evident from the
incompleteness of the atlas of 1807. It contained a table of
charts&mdash;"Tableau General des planches qui composent l'atlas
historique"&mdash;which were not inserted in the book; and in one
of the four copies of this rare volume which the author has been
able to examine, the previous owner, or the bookseller from whom
it was purchased, collating the contents with the table, had
pencilled in the margin, "All wanting," being under the
impression that the copy was imperfect. But the charts detailed
in the table were not issued with the book. They were not ready,
and the table stands as an eloquent indicator of the hurry in
which the publication was performed. The first volume of the
Voyage de Decouvertes contains numerous marginal references to
charts not contained in the atlas issued with it. Readers of the
book must have been puzzled by these references,* when they
turned to the atlas and found no charts corresponding with them.
Freycinet's complete folio volume of charts was not published
till 1812, five years after the issue of the book which they were
necessary to explain. Flinders had then been released; but it is
significant that he was held in the clutches of General Decaen,
despite constant demands for his liberation, until the
preparation of the French charts was sufficiently advanced to
make it impossible for his own to be issued until theirs had been
placed before the world.</p>
<p class="foot">(* As the present writer was when he began to
study the subject closely, and as the Quarterly reviewer was in
1810. He said: "The atlas is of quarto size; it contains not a
single chart nor any sketch or plan of a coast, island, bay, or
harbour, though frequent references are made to such in the
margin of the printed volume" (page 60). The reviewer should have
said, "except the two cartes generales" described on a previous
page.)</p>
<p>Flinders, generous in his judgments of other men even when
smarting under great grievances, put forth an excuse for
P&eacute;ron, suggesting that he had acted under pressure. "How,
then, came M. P&eacute;ron to advance what was so contrary to
truth?" he wrote. "Was he a man destitute of all principle? My
answer is, that I believe his candour to have been equal to his
acknowledged abilities, and that what he wrote was from
overruling authority, and smote him to the heart. He did not live
to finish the second volume."</p>
<p>This would be an acceptable way of disposing of the question
if we could reasonably accept the explanation. But can we?
Freycinet denied that any pressure was exerted. Those who knew
P&eacute;ron's character, he wrote,* were aware that he would
have refused to do anything with which his conscience could
reproach him. He was so able and zealous a man of science, that
we should like to believe that of him. justice demands that we
should give full weight to every favourable factor in the case as
affecting him. Flinders was a British naval officer, and naval
men at that period were disposed to see the hand of Napoleon in
every bit of mischief. But the "pressure" theory does not sustain
examination.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 2 page 21.)</p>
<p>The task thrust upon P&eacute;ron in the writing of the
historical narrative of the voyage was one for which he had not
prepared himself, and which did not properly pertain to him. The
death of Baudin, whose work this would naturally have been,
compelled the naturalist to become historian. He had not kept the
log, and it may be reasonably assumed that he had not concerned
himself in a particular degree with those events of which he
would have made careful notes had it been intended from the
beginning that he should be the official recorder. He had applied
himself with passionate energy to the collection and
classification of zoological specimens. This was his special
vocation, and he pursued it worthily. It is probably safe to say
that no expedition, French or English, that ever came down to
Australasian waters, added so much that was new to the world's
scientific knowledge, or accumulated so much material, as did
this one whose chief naturalist was Francois P&eacute;ron. When
it is added that two of the greatest figures in British
scientific history, Darwin and Huxley, were among the workers in
this fruitful field, it will be admitted that the acknowledgment
is not made in any niggard spirit. But we are now concerned with
P&eacute;ron as historian of what related to Terre Naploeon and
the surrounding circumstances. Here his statements have been
shown to be unreliable. It is probable that he wrote largely from
memory; almost certainly from insufficient data. Further, he was
weak and ill when engaged upon the book. The hardships and
unhealthy conditions of the voyage had undermined his
constitution. One would conclude from his style of writing that
he was by temperament excitable and easily subject to depression.
A zealous savant, to whom fishes and birds, beetles and
butterflies, were the precious things of the earth, and for whom
the discovery of a new species was as great a source of joy as a
glorious victory was to his imperial master, P&eacute;ron appeals
to us as a pathetic figure whom one would rather screen from
blame than otherwise. He suffered severely, and did his final
work under the difficulty of breaking health. He died in 1810,
before his second volume was ready for publication.</p>
<p>Freycinet wrote a series of notes by way of preface to volumes
2 and 3, in attempted justification of the Terre Napoleon maps.*
He was put on the defensive because "the audacious attempt which
was made in the first volume of this work, to rob Captain
Flinders of the well-earned merit of his nautical labours and
discoveries, while he was basely and barbarously kept in prison
in a French colony, was regarded with becoming indignation
throughout Europe, and with shame by the better part of the
French nation."** That that is a fair description of the state of
feeling among people concerned with the advancement of knowledge,
is beyond question; and the French above all, with their love of
enterprise, their sentiment of honour, their eager applause of
high achievement, their chivalrous sense of justice, and their
quick sympathy with suffering wrongly inflicted and bravely
borne, would have no taste for laurels plucked in their name from
the brow of him who was entitled to wear them. Thoroughly
repugnant to French intellect and feeling was conduct of this
description. National animosities were more bitter at this period
than they have ever been at any other time, but science knows no
nationality. Even when the two governments had ceased to have
relations with each other, we still find English and French men
of science communicating on friendly terms; and Napoleon himself
was willing to grant the requests of an English savant while
English arms and English diplomacy were at furious war with him.
Thus Sir Joseph Banks, who was a corresponding member of the
Institute of France, could write in 1805, "I have obtained the
release of five persons from the gracious condescension of the
Emperor, the only five, I believe, that have been regularly
discharged from their parole."</p>
<p class="foot">(* The second volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes
was published&mdash;out of its due order&mdash;in 1816, the third
in 1815.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Quarterly Review volume 17 (1817) page
229.)</p>
<p>Freycinet, then, had to defend his charts. But there never was
a more complete example of the remark that "qui s'excuse
s'accuse." He argued that when Le Geographe cruised along the
coasts discovered by Flinders, there was no published work in
which they were described, therefore the French were justified in
applying their own names. But this plea ignored the fact that if
the coasts were not charted in any work published before 1807,
they had been, to the full knowledge of the French officers,
charted by Flinders, whose work would have been published earlier
if he had not been forcibly detained. Again he argued* that,
inasmuch as "jamais P&eacute;ron ni moi"&mdash;where Freycinet
assumed part of the responsibility&mdash;knew of the work done by
Flinders until his book was published, the work of the French was
truly one of discovery; and as to the names given by the English
navigator, "it is certain that we could not employ them without
knowing them." But it was not true that Freycinet, P&eacute;ron,
or Baudin was unaware of the discoveries made by Flinders. Even
were there not his specific statement that he explained his
discoveries and showed one of his charts to illustrate them, it
would be incredible that while the French and English ships lay
together for some weeks at Port Jackson, with tents erected on
the same piece of ground, the officers frequently meeting on
friendly terms, Freycinet and P&eacute;ron should not have learnt
what the Investigator had been doing. Both the French authors are
individually mentioned by Flinders as having been present on one
or other of these occasions, and Freycinet does not deny the
statement. Further, Captain Hamelin reported to the French
Government, in 1803, that Flinders had traced the coast from the
Leeuwin to Encounter Bay, and had discovered a large and
beautiful island which he had named "L'Ile des Kangaroux."**</p>
<p class="foot">(* Preface to volume 3.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Moniteur, 27 Thermidor, Revolutionary Year
11.)</p>
<p>It is true that the French were not acquainted with Flinders'
names, except in the one case of Kangaroo Island. He told Baudin
what name he had given in that case. Nevertheless they ignored
it, and called the island Ile Decres. But even when they did know
of the names given to features of the coast by a previous English
navigator, P&eacute;ron and Freycinet disregarded them. Grant's
Narrative of the Voyage of the Lady Nelson was published,
together with his eye-chart of the coast from Cape Banks to
Wilson's Promontory, in 1803. Flinders states positively that
Grant's "discoveries were known to M. P&eacute;ron and the French
expedition in 1802";* as indeed we might well suppose, for Grant
was not the man to allow any one with whom he came in contact to
remain unaware of his achievements, and he was in Sydney just
before the French arrived there. They would hear of him from many
people. Yet Grant's names, inscribed in plain print on his
published chart, were all ignored on the Terre Napoleon
charts&mdash;his Cape Nelson becoming Cap Montaigne; his Cape
Otway, Cap Desaix; his Cape Schanck, Cap Richelieu; and so
forth.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage 1 201.)</p>
<p>The contention that the south coast exploration of the French
was "entirely a work of discovery,"* although they were
forestalled in it by Flinders and Grant, is neither true nor
sensible. If it could be held that the voyage of a vessel sailing
without a chart or a pilot along a coast previously unknown to
its officers was "entirely a work of discovery," then a ship that
should sail under such conditions along any piece of
coast&mdash;say from Boulogne to La Hague&mdash;would accomplish
"a work of discovery." Discovery is a matter of priority, or the
word is meaningless.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Freycinet, 2 page 23.)</p>
<p>Freycinet's notes nowhere meet the gravest feature of the
case&mdash;the prolongation of the imprisonment of Flinders until
the French could complete their own charts for publication. The
talk about not knowing what Flinders' names were, the affected
ignorance of his prior claims, were crudely disingenuous.
Freycinet knew perfectly where Flinders was, and why his charts
were not issued. The Moniteur contained several references to his
case. Sir Joseph Banks repeatedly pressed leading members of the
Institute to lend their influence to secure his liberation. But
Freycinet, who had shared in the generous hospitality of the
British governor in Sydney&mdash;extended at a time when the
French crews were sorely stricken&mdash;and should have been
moved by gratitude, to say nothing of justice, to help in undoing
an act of wrong to a fellow-navigator, does not seem to have
taken the slightest step in this direction, nor does he in any of
his writings express any regret concerning the unhappy fate that
overtook the English captain.</p>
<p>The claim made in behalf of Baudin's expedition can best be
stated in the language of P&eacute;ron. Dentrecasteaux, he wrote,
not having advanced beyond the islands of St. Peter and St.
Francis, which form the extremity of Nuyts Land, and the English
not having carried their researches farther than Westernport, "it
follows that all the portion between the last-mentioned port and
Nuyts Land was unknown at the time when we arrived on these
shores." P&eacute;ron's words were not candid. It is true that
part of the shores in question were unknown when Baudin's ships
"arrived." They "arrived" off Cape Leeuwin in May 1801, before
Flinders left England, though not before Grant had discovered his
stretch of coast. (Grant reached Sydney, having roughly traced
the coast from Cape Banks to Cape Schanck, on December 16, 1800.)
If, however, P&eacute;ron meant to convey that the coasts were
unknown when Baudin's ships actually sailed along them, he stated
what was not the case. Let us hear Flinders in reply. "M.
P&eacute;ron should not have said that the south coast from
Westernport to Nuyts Land was then unknown, but that it was
unknown to them, for Captain Grant, of the Lady Nelson, had
discovered the eastern part from Westernport to the longitude 140
degrees 14 minutes in the year 1800, before the French ships
sailed from Europe, and on the west I had explored the coast and
islands from Nuyts Land to Cape Jervis in 138 degrees 10
minutes." In other words, Grant's eye-chart connected up the
coast between the extremity of George Bass's exploration,
Westernport, and Cape Banks to the east, while Flinders had
traversed the coast between Nuyts Land and Encounter Bay to the
west, leaving a gap of only about fifty leagues of sandy shore,
upon which there is "neither river, inlet, or place of shelter,"
that was actually discovered by Baudin. Flinders not only
admitted that the French had discovered this particularly barren
and uninteresting stretch of land, but marked it upon his charts*
as "discovered by Captain Baudin, 1802." The French on their
charts, however, made not the slightest reference to the
discoveries of either Flinders or Grant.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Cf. plate 4 in Flinders' Atlas, for
example.)</p>
<p>The true Terre Napoleon, therefore, if the name were to
survive at all, would be from a point north-west of Cape Banks in
the state of South Australia, to the mouth of the river Murray in
Encounter Bay. The names marked on a modern map indicate the sort
of country that it is in the main. Chinaman's Wells, M'Grath's
Flat, Salt Creek, Martin's Washpool, Jim Crow's Flat, and
Tilley's Swamp are examples. They are not noble-sounding
designations to inscribe at the back of coasts once dignified by
the name of the greatest figure in modern history. It is rather
to be regretted that the name Terre Napoleon has slipped off
modern maps. It is historically interesting. When Eric the Red,
as the Saga tells us, discovered Greenland, he so called it
because "men would be the more readily persuaded thither if the
land had a good name." Most will agree that Terre Napoleon sounds
a bit better than Pipe Clay Plain or Willow Swamp, which are
other choice flowers in the same garden.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* These "virginal chaste names" are taken from
the map of South Australia, by the Surveyor-General of that
State, 1892.)</p>
<p>There is no evidence to warrant the belief that Napoleon had
anything whatever to do with affixing his name to the territory
to which it was applied, or with the nomenclature of the features
of the coast. Nor would there be anything remarkable in the use
of the name Terre Napoleon, if the French had really discovered
the region so described. In every part of the world there are
lands named after the rulers of the nations to which the
discoverers or founders belonged. Raleigh named Virginia "from
the maiden Queen"; the two Carolinas preserve the name of the
amorous monarch who granted the original charter of colonisation
"out of a Pious and good intention for ye propogacion of ye
Christian faith amongst ye Barbarous and Ignorant Indians, ye
Inlargement of his Empire and Dominions, and Inriching of his
Subjects"; and two states of Australia commemorate by their names
the great Queen who occupied the British throne when they were
founded. There would have been nothing unusual or improper in the
action of the French in styling the country from Wilson's
Promontory to Cape Adieu "Terre Napoleon," except that they did
not discover it. What they did excites a feeling akin to
derision, because it bore the character of "jumping a claim," to
use an Australian mining phrase.</p>
<p>Nor is it to be inferred that affixing the name was intended
to assert possession. An examination of the large chart of
Australia shows that the whole of the coast-line, except this
particular stretch, was previously named. There was Terre de
Nuyts on the south-west; Terre de Leeuwin, Terre d'Endrels, Terre
d'Endracht were on the west; Terre de Witt on the north-west;
Terre d'Arnheim and Terre de Carpentarie on the north. New South
Wales was marked as occupying the whole of the east. The styling
of the freshly discovered south Terre Napoleon was a mere piece
of courtiership. If Napoleon had ever been strong enough to
strike a blow at the British in Australia, the probabilities are
that he would have endeavoured to oust them from New South Wales,
and would not have troubled himself very much about the coasts
that were named after him. It was his way to strike at the heart
of his enemy, and the heart of British settlement in Australia
was located at Port Jackson.</p>
<p>It has been represented in one of the best books in English on
the Napoleonic period,* that "the names given by Flinders on the
coasts of Western and South Australia, have been retained owing
to the priority of his investigation, but the French names have
been kept up on the coast between the mouth of the Murray and
Bass Straits for the same reason." That statement, however, is
very much too wide. Capes Patton, Otway, Nelson, Bridgewater,
Northumberland and Banks, Portland Bay and Julia Percy Island,
all lie between the points mentioned, and all of them were named
by Grant, who first discovered them and marked them on his chart.
None of the French names is properly in present employment east
of Cape Buffon; for their Cap Boufflers, which is marked on a few
maps, is really the Cape Banks of Grant. The only names freshly
applied by Baudin to natural features of the mainland on the
Terre Napoleon charts, and which are in current use, are Cape
Buffon, Cape Lannes, Rivoli Bay, Cape Jaffa, Cape Rabelais, Cape
Dombey, Guichen Bay, Cape Bernoulli, Lacepede Bay, and Cape
Morard de Galles. Some or other of these names may be found, in
some order, on some modern map, but the sequence is variable, and
they are not all to be found on any single map with which the
author is acquainted; because there are more names than there are
natural capes and bays to which they can apply. The remainder of
the French names between Lacepede Bay and Cape Jervis, and most
of those in the more easterly section, are not marked on any
current map, because in some instances they do not represent
features of the coast which are sufficiently pronounced to
require names, whilst in other cases they are applied to islands,
capes, and bays that do not exist.** Where are Cap Monge, Cap
Caffarelli, Cap Mollien, Cap du Mont St. Bernard, Ile Latrelle,
or Baie Descartes? They are not to be found. Freycinet***
complained that Flinders, on his charts, had erroneously applied
the French names between Cap Monge and Cap Lannes. It was a
singular complaint to make, seeing that Flinders gave the French
full credit for their discoveries, whilst they omitted all
reference to his work on their charts. But Flinders' difficulty
was that of all later map-makers: he could not find all the
places to which Baudin had given names. He did his best; but it
is evidently easier to sprinkle a coast-line with the contents of
a biographical dictionary, than to fit all the names in.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Dr. Holland Rose's Life of Napoleon 1
381.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** The difficulty of identifying the features
marked on the Terre Napoleon charts is made clear by comparing
them with a few good modern maps. Thus, taking them from
south-east to north-west, they appear on the French charts in the
following order: 1, Cap Buffon; 2, Cap Lannes; 3, Baie de Rivoli;
4, Cap de Jaffa; 5, Cap Rabelais; 6, Cap Dombey; 7, Baie de
Guichen; 8, Cap Bernoulli; 9, Baie Lacepede; 10, Cap Morard de
Galles; 11, Cap Fermat; 12, Cap Monge 13, Cap Caffarelli; 14, Cap
Villars; 15, Baie Mollien; 16, Cap Mollien 17, Baie Cretet; 18,
Cap Cretet; 19, Iles Decaen; 20, Cap Decaen; 21, Cap Montelivet.
On the large Continental map constructed by the Department of
Lands and Survey, State of Victoria, 1879, the order of the names
included is as follows: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3, Lannes; 4,
Guichen; 5, Jaffa; 6, Lacepede. Rabelais, Dombey, Bernoulli, and
the rest are omitted, the draftsman evidently being unable to
find features to which to apply them. On the large map compiled
in the office of the Surveyor-General, State of South Australia,
1892, the order of the names is: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3,
Rabelais; 4, Lannes; 5, Dombey; 6, Guichen; 7, Jaffa; 8,
Lacepede. On the excellent map in M'Lean's New Atlas of
Australia, 1886, we find: 1, Buffon; 2, Rivoli; 3, Lannes; 4,
Guichen; 5, Jaffa; 6, Lacepede. Flinders, on his separate chart
of this part of the coast, found features for the names of
Buffon, Lannes, Rivoli, and Bernoulli, but left out Rabelais,
Dombey, Guichen, and Lacepede. In no case is the cape or bay on
the Terre Napoleon chart of this part of the coast a tolerably
good representation of an actuality.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Preface to the 1824 edition of the Voyage de
Decouvertes page 13, note.)</p>
<p>The French cartography of the portions of the coast eastward
of the two gulfs was so badly done, in fact, that many of the
features indicated on the charts are mere geographical Mrs.
Harrises&mdash;there "ain't no sich" places. The coast was not
surveyed at all, but was sketched roughly, inaccurately, and out
of scale; so that even the sandy stretch now known as the
Coorong, which is about as featureless as a railway embankment,
was fitted with names and drawn with corrugations as though it
were as jagged as a gigantic saw. Our respect for such names as
Montesquieu and Descartes causes us to regret that they should
have been wasted on a cape and a bay that geography knows not;
and our abiding interest in the sinister genius of Talleyrand
fosters the wish that his patronymic had been reserved for some
other feature than the curve of the coast which holds "the Rip"
of Port Phillip, though in one sense he who was so wont to "fish
in troubled waters" is not inaptly associated with that boil of
sea."*</p>

<p><b>FRENCHMAN'S ROCK, KANGAROO ISLAND</b></p>
</center>
<p>The south and west of Kangaroo Island were, however, first
charted by Baudin, and his names survive there. Flinders had
marked these shores with a dotted line on his chart, to signify
that he had not surveyed them. He intended to complete this bit
of work on his return, but he was "caught in the clutch of
circumstance," and was never permitted to return. Such names as
Cape Borda, Cape Linois, Maupertuis Bay, Cape Gautheaume,
Bougainville Bay, and a few others, preserve the memory of the
French expedition on Kangaroo Island. A rock, known as
Frenchman's Rock, upon which a record of the visit was cut, also
survives there.</p>
<p>A few months after the publication of the Terre Napoleon
charts in 1807, the truth about the matter became known. Sir
Joseph Banks, who had been kept well informed by Flinders about
the work which he had performed, and who had done all that was
possible to obtain his release from Mauritius, was influential in
scientific circles throughout Europe. Fortunately, he had ample
material at his disposal. Flinders had sent home some finished
charts from Sydney, and during his imprisonment he wrote up a
manuscript journal which he succeeded in getting conveyed to
England. It was this manuscript which the Admiralty permitted to
be perused by the writer of the powerful Quarterly Review article
of August 1810. The feeling of indignation evoked by the
treatment which the navigator received was intensified when the
publication of his Voyage and his charts in 1814 showed the
measure of his shining merits&mdash;his thoroughness, his
accuracy, his diligence, the beauty of his drawings, the vast
extent of the entirely new work which he had done, and the
manliness, gentleness, courage, and fairness of his personal
character.</p>
<p>In addition to the discredit, of which he had to bear his full
share, Freycinet was involved in perplexities of another kind. It
was a convenient piece of flattery to name the two great gulfs
after Napoleon and Josephine when they were Emperor and Empress;
but the courtier-like compliment was embarrassing when Josephine
was supplanted by Marie Louise, and it became offensive when
Napoleon himself was overthrown and a Bourbon once more occupied
the throne of France. Many of the other names, too, were those of
men no longer in favour. Yet the earlier volumes of the Voyage de
Decouvertes had referred in the text to the names on the French
charts as though they formed a final system of nomenclature. What
was poor Freycinet to do in completing the work? Here, indeed,
was a sailor hoist to his own yard-arm with his own halyard. The
work could not be dropped, since faith had to be kept with
purchasers. In the event, the old names were employed in the text
of the completed book, but a fresh atlas was issued (1817) with
the name Terre Napoleon wiped off the principal chart, most of
the names changed to those given by Flinders and Grant, and a
neat note in the corner taking the place of the former
eagle&mdash;which was moulting; no longer the screaming fowl it
used to be&mdash;announcing that "this map of New Holland is an
exact reduction of that contained in the first edition."* The
announcement was not quite true. It was not "une reduction
exacte." The imperial bird had flown, and the names had undergone
systematic revision. The Bonaparte family were pitilessly
evicted. It was a new and smaller map, with a new allocation of
names. Freycinet's name appeared upon it, and he probably wrote
the inscription in the corner.</p>

Later career of Decaen.</p>
<p>Flinders, in the decrepit little Cumberland, put into Port
Louis, Mauritius, on December 16, 1803. He was not permitted to
sail out again till July 1810; and then he was a broken man,
smitten with diseases, the painful product of exposure,
shipwreck, confinement in a tropical climate, anxiety, and bitter
years of heart-sickness and weary disappointment; yet a brave man
still, with some hope nobly burning in the true hero's heart of
him; but with less vitality than hope, so that he could do no
more than write his big book of travel, and then lie down to
die.</p>
<p>Many loose statements have been written about the use which
the French made of Flinders' charts while he was held in
captivity. It has been too often taken for granted that the
evidence of plagiarism is beyond dispute. Not only popular
writers, but historians with claims to be considered scientific,
are substantially in agreement on this point. Two examples will
indicate what is meant. Messrs. Becke and Jeffery, in their Naval
Pioneers of Australia (page 216), assert that "among other
indignities he suffered, he found that the charts taken from him
by Decaen had been appropriated to Baudin's exploring
expedition." Again, to take a work appealing to a different
section of readers, the Cambridge Modern History also charges the
French with "the use of his papers to appropriate for their ships
the credit of his discoveries."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Volume 9 page 739 (Professor Egerton). Two
more examples may be cited. Thus, Laurie, Story of Australasia
(1896) page 86. "He found that his journals and charts had been
stolen by the French governor of the Mauritius and transferred to
Paris, where the fullest advantage was taken of them by M.
P&eacute;ron." Again, Jose, Australasia (1901) page 21: "His maps
were taken to France to be published there with French names as
the work of French explorers.")</p>
<p>The charge is, it will be observed, that not only did the
French governor of Mauritius imprison the English navigator
despite his passport, detaining him years after the other members
of the Cumberland's company had been liberated, but that
Flinders' charts and papers were improperly used in the
preparation of the history of Baudin's expedition. Indeed, the
accusation is equivalent to one of garrotting: that General
Decaen seized and bound his victim, robbed him, and enabled
Freycinet and P&eacute;ron to use his work as their own.</p>
<p>So widely has this view been diffused, that probably few will
be prepared for the assurance that there is no evidence to
support it. On the contrary, as will be shown, neither
P&eacute;ron nor Freycinet ever saw any chart or journal taken
from Flinders. Use was made, it is believed, of one British chart
which may possibly have been his&mdash;that embodying a drawing
of Port Phillip&mdash;but reasons will be given for the opinion
that this, whether it was Flinders' chart or Murray's, was seen
by the French before Baudin's ships left Sydney, and was
certainly not copied at Mauritius.</p>
<p>Before proving these statements, it will be convenient to make
the reader acquainted with the Captain-General or
Military-Governor of Mauritius, Charles Decaen. He was a rough,
dogged, somewhat brutal type of soldier, who had attained to
eminence during the revolutionary wars. Born at Caen in Normandy
in 1769, he served during his youth for three years in the
artillery, and then entered a lawyer's office in his native town;
but during the wars of the Revolution, when France was pressed by
enemies on all sides, he threw aside quills and parchments, and,
in his twenty-third year, entered upon his strenuous fighting
career. Thenceforth, until after the signing of the Treaty of
Luneville in 1801, he was almost constantly engaged in military
operations. He had risen from the ranks, and won commendation for
stubborn valour from such commanders as Desaix, Kleber, Hoche,
Westermann, and Moreau. He participated in the cruel war of La
Vendee, won fresh laurels during the campaign of the Rhine
(1796), and fought with a furious lust for battle under the noble
Moreau at Hohenlinden. By that time (1800) he had become a
general of division, and on the eve of the battle, when he
brought up his force and made his appearance at a council of war,
Moreau greeted him with the flattering remark, "Ah! here is
Decaen; the battle will be ours to-morrow." He was recognised as
a strong-willed general, not brilliant, but very determined, and
as also a thoroughly capable and honest administrator. Napoleon,
in 1803, selected him for Indian service, and stationed him at
the Isle of France (Mauritius), in the hope that if all went well
a heavy blow might some day be struck at British power in India.
Decaen was not a courtier, nor a scholar, nor a man of sentiment,
but a plain, coarse, downright soldier; a true Norman, and a
thorough son of the Revolution. He was not the kind of man to be
interested in navigation, discovery, or the expansion of human
knowledge; and appeals made to him on these grounds on behalf of
Flinders were futile. Yet we must do justice to the admirable
side of Decaen's character, by observing that he bore a
reputation for generosity among his fellow-soldiers; and he was a
very efficient and economical governor, maintaining a reputation
for probity that did not distinguish too many of the
Revolutionary and Napoleonic generals. Flinders, just in his
opinion even of an enemy, wrote to Sir Joseph Banks that Decaen
bore among the people of the island "the character of having a
good heart, though too hasty and violent." It is pleasant to find
him writing thus of the man who had wronged him, at a time when
he had good reason for feeling bitter; and we certainly need not
think worse of Decaen than did the man who suffered most from the
general's callous insensibility.</p>
<p>Now, the clear facts with regard to the taking from Flinders
of his charts, papers, log-books, and journals are these. On
December 17, the day after his arrival at the island, it was
signified to him that the governor intended to detain him. All
his charts and journals relating to the voyage, and the letters
and official packets which he was carrying to England from
Sydney, were put in a trunk, which was sealed by Flinders at the
desire of the French officers who were sent by Decaen to arrest
him. He signed a paper certifying that all the "charts, journals,
and papers of the voyage" had been thus placed in the trunk.* On
the following day (Sunday, December 18) he was informed that the
governor wished to have extracts made from his journals, showing
the causes which had compelled him to quit the Investigator, for
which ship and for no other, according to Decaen's contention,
the passport had been granted. He also wished to elicit from the
journals evidence of the reasons which had induced Flinders to
stop at Mauritius, instead of sailing for the Cape of Good Hope.
The officers explained that General Decaen considered it to be
necessary to have these extracts for transmission to the French
Government, "to justify himself for granting that assistance to
the Cumberland which had been ordered for the Investigator." So
far he had not, as a fact, granted any assistance to the
Cumberland; for the imprisonment of her commander and crew can
hardly be called "assistance." But as Flinders was convinced that
an examination of his latest log-book would manifest his bona
fides, and assure both the governor and the French Government
that he was no spy, as Decaen accused him of being, he broke the
seal of the trunk, and took out "the third volume of my rough
log-book, which contained the whole of what they desired to know,
and pointing out the parts in question to the secretary, told him
to make such extracts as should be thought requisite."** All the
other papers and books were at once returned to the trunk, and
sealed as before.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Flinders, Voyage 2 361.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Flinders, Voyage 2 364.)</p>
<p>The third log-book was the only document pertaining to
Flinders' discoveries which Decaen ever had in his possession. It
was never returned. The rightful owner never saw it again. It has
never since been produced. Flinders applied for it repeatedly. On
the very day before he was liberated, he made a final demand for
it. Mr. Hope, the British commissary for the exchange of
prisoners, made a formal official application for it in 1810, but
met with "a positive refusal both of the book and of permission
to take a copy of it."* In 1811, after Flinders reached England,
the Admiralty, at his instance, requested the French Government
to insist upon its restoration. At the end of his book, published
1814, Flinders earnestly protested against Decaen's continued
detention of it. But it was not restored.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Hope's report to the Admiralty, October 25,
1810 (Historical Records of New South Wales 7 435).)</p>
<p>This book contained Flinders' "Journal of transactions and
observations on board the Investigator, the Porpoise, the Hope
cutter, and Cumberland schooner," for the preceding six months.*
There was therefore nothing in it which could have been of any
use in relation to the so-called Terre Napoleon. The log-book
embodying Flinders' observations on those coasts pertained to a
period before the six months just mentioned, and was never seen
by Decaen, nor did he see any of Flinders' charts whatever.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Flinders, Voyage 2 378 and 463.)</p>
<p>Towards the end of December the whole of the remaining books
and papers of Flinders, even including his family letters, were,
in his presence, collected from the ship by M. Bonnefoy, an
interpreter, and Colonel Monistrol, Decaen's secretary&mdash;who
"acted throughout with much politeness, apologising for what they
were obliged by their orders to execute"&mdash;and sealed up in
another trunk.* Later in the same month (December 26), Flinders,
wishing to occupy his time in confinement by proceeding with his
work, wrote to the governor, requesting that he might have his
printed volumes, and two or three charts and manuscript books,
for the purpose of finishing his chart of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, adding in explanation that some of his papers were
lost in the wreck of the Porpoise, and he wished to finish the
work from memory, with the aid of the remaining materials, before
the details faded from his recollection. Decaen acceded to his
request, and Flinders took out two log-books, such charts as were
necessary, all his private letters, and his journals of bearings
and astronomical observations. He also took out his naval
signal-book, which he destroyed, lest it should be seen by any
French officer. He gave a receipt for the documents, and the
remainder were once more locked up in the trunk, which was again
sealed by Flinders.** The papers so obtained were the "greatest
part"*** of his books and charts, and the possession of them,
enabling Flinders to devote his energies to the work he loved,
relieved the depression which imprisonment and illness cast upon
his active brain and body.</p>

<p>In February of the following year Flinders made another
application for more books and papers, consisting of the greater
part of his "original fair charts,"* for the purpose of making an
abridgment of his discoveries upon a single sheet. The governor
was by this time very angry with his captive; the more so,
probably, as he was conscious of the inadequacy of the reasons
for detaining him. But the demeanour of the English captain did
not please him either. Flinders, maintaining the dignity of his
uniform, had not assumed a humble mien, and had even refused an
invitation to dine with the general unless he could attend, not
as a prisoner, but as an officer free and unsuspect. If Decaen
really believed him to be a spy, why did he invite him? The
governor, however, was not now in a mood to oblige his prisoner,
and in response to his application for more papers, curtly
replied that he would attend to the request when freed from more
pressing business. Flinders in March urged Colonel Monistrol to
intercede; complained in May that the manuscripts were still
withheld; and, being unable to make any impression on the
obdurate Decaen, completed his map with the aid of another
journal kept by Mr. Akin, the master of the Investigator, who was
a fellow-prisoner until May 1805.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage 2 384.)</p>
<p>These remaining documents were not restored till August 1807,
when Flinders was invited to go to Port Louis from the house in
the country where part of his imprisonment was spent, and take
possession of the trunk. He found that rats had eaten their way
into it, and had made great havoc among his papers, totally
destroying some. But the seals were unbroken, and Flinders gave a
receipt for the contents, acknowledging that the most important
documents had happily escaped the rats.* He was an observant man,
and if he had had any suspicion that the charts had been tampered
with, would have promptly said so. There is not, however, the
faintest reason for believing that the trunk had been opened
between December 1803, when Flinders was permitted to take out
the "greatest part" of his important papers, and August 1807,
when the remainder were restored to him. The only missing
documents were the few which the rats had eaten, the third
log-book, which Decaen refused to give up, and two packets of
official despatches which the Cumberland was carrying from Sydney
to England, and which Colonel Monistrol informed him had been
"long ago disposed of." The Colonel "supposed that something in
them had contributed to my imprisonment." They had been "disposed
of" by being sent to Paris for the perusal of Napoleon's
Government.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage 2 462.)</p>
<p>Why, however, did Decaen refuse permission to Flinders to have
the last of his papers till the year 1807? Why had he willingly
permitted him to take some of them in December 1803, but declined
to let him have any more till nearly four years later? A
comparison of dates is instructive on this point. As has already
been said, the first volume of P&eacute;ron's Voyage de
Decouvertes aux Terres Australes, and the first edition of the
atlas containing two of Freycinet's charts, were published in
1807. Making all allowances for the obstinate character of
Decaen, it is most significant that the remainder of Flinders'
charts and papers were kept from him until the very time when
Freycinet was ready to publish the first and hurried edition of
his atlas. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the
governor was acting under influences exerted from Paris, private
if not official, in refusing the navigator access to the material
which it was believed was essential to the completion of the
charts that would demonstrate his discoveries, until the French
officer could hurry out a makeshift atlas and fictitious claims
could be based upon it.</p>
<p>This conduct was reprehensible enough, but, it must be
insisted, there is no ground whatever for the too frequently made
assertion that Flinders' charts were surreptitiously copied or
actually stolen&mdash;for the loose manner in which the affair
has been related in some books renders doubtful which of the two
accusations the authors desired to make.* Not only is there no
evidence to support any such charge, but Flinders himself never
accused Decaen of making an improper use of the papers in the
trunk, nor did he ever allege that the two charts contained in
the French atlas of 1807, or those in Freycinet's folio atlas of
1812&mdash;which he probably saw before his death in July
1814&mdash;were founded upon or owed anything to his drawings. He
simply set forth the facts with his habitual exactness and
fairness; and where Flinders was just, there is surely no warrant
for others to perpetuate an accusation which originated in a
period of intense national hatred and jealousy, and bears its
birth-mark upon it.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Blair, Cyclopaedia of Australasia page 131,
actually says that Baudin, "having taken copies of Flinders'
charts, sailed for France, where he published a book and received
great applause from the French nation, who called him the
greatest discoverer of the present century." Spirit-writing one
has heard of, but not even the Psychical Research Society has
recorded the case of a dead man copying hydrographical charts. A
similar disregard of the fact that Baudin died before the return
of his ships occurs in J.E. Tenison Woods' History of Exploration
in Australia (1865) volume 1 page 174, where we are informed that
Flinders was detained in Mauritius, because "at that time the
Emperor Napoleon was obliging Admiral Baudin [sic] to usurp the
glory of his discoveries"; a case of post-mortem promotion.)</p>
<p>A critical examination of Freycinet's charts is alone
sufficient to shatter the opinion that he utilised the drawings
of the English navigator. Had he even seen them, his own work
would have been more accurate than it was, and his large chart of
New Holland would have been more complete. It has already been
shown that the French chart of the so-called Terre Napoleon
coasts was in large measure defective, many capes, islands, and
bays being represented that have no existence in fact, and a
large portion of the outline being crudely and erroneously drawn.
Not only so, but if Freycinet had had copies of Flinders' charts
before him, use would certainly have been made of them to give
greater completeness to the eastern and north-western shores.
Flinders, in his last voyage in the Investigator, had made
important discoveries on the Queensland coast and in the Gulf of
Carpentaria. He had discovered, for instance, Port Bowen and Port
Curtis, which had been missed by Cook, had given greater
definiteness to the islands near the southern end of the Great
Barrier Reef, and had made a dangerous acquaintance with the Reef
itself, discovering one narrow alley through it which is marked
on modern maps as Flinders' Passage. In the Gulf of Carpentaria
he had also done some entirely original work. He had shown, for
example, that Cape Van Diemen, represented as a projection from
the mainland on all previous maps, was really part of an island,
which he named Mornington Isle. Freycinet's charts reveal not the
faintest trace of the fresh discoveries which Flinders had
achieved around east and north-east Australia, nor do they in any
particular indicate that their manifold serious imperfections had
been corrected by reference to Flinders' superb charts. In short,
the French work, though beautifully engraved and printed, was, in
a geographical sense, for the most part too poor to justify the
suspicion that Freycinet received aid from the drawings of the
persevering captain of the Investigator.</p>
<p>The circumstances attending the imprisonment of Flinders, and
the precipitate haste with which Freycinet's work was pushed
forward, undoubtedly furnished prima facie justification for the
suspicion, indignantly voiced by contemporary English writers,
and which has been hardened into a direct accusation since, that
an act of plagiarism was committed, dishonest in itself, and
doubly guilty from the circumstances in which it was performed.
The Quarterly reviewer of 1817* pointed out that the few charts
in Freycinet's atlas "ARE VERY LIKE THOSE OF CAPTAIN FLINDERS,
ONLY MUCH INFERIOR IN POINT OF EXECUTION." They are very like in
one respect, namely, in the representation of Spencer's and St.
Vincent's Gulfs and Kangaroo Island. In other particulars, at all
events as far as relates to the Terre Napoleon coasts, the French
charts are quite unlike those of Flinders. But
contemporaries&mdash;knowing that Flinders' charts had been taken
from him by Decaen, and that he had been held in captivity until
the French could finish their work, and then, comparing his
charts with Freycinet's, finding that parts of the coasts
discovered by the English captain were well represented on the
French charts, while other parts of the outline of Terra
Australis were badly done or inadequate&mdash;not unnaturally
drew the inference that the well-drawn sections were based upon
drawings improperly acquired. If the chain of evidence was not
complete, the violent racial animosities then prevalent moulded
the missing links in the fervent heat of imagination.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Volume 17 pages 229 to 230; the italics are
the reviewer's. The plagiarism legend&mdash;for such it
is&mdash;originated with this Quarterly article. The earliest
biographer of Flinders, in the Naval Chronicle 32 page 177, wrote
very strongly of General Decaen, considering that he was "worthy
of his Corsican master," and that his name "will be consigned to
infamy as long as mankind shall consider it honourable to promote
science and civilised to practise hospitality," but alleged no
improper use of the charts. C.A. Walckenaer, who wrote the
excellent life of Flinders in the Biographie Universelle,
published in 1856, said that the French Government was
"inexcusable d'avoir retenu Flinders en captivite," but denied
that his charts were improperly used, and promised that when he
came to write the life of P&eacute;ron in a succeeding volume, he
would by an analysis of the evidence refute the story. But
Walckenaer died in 1852, before his Flinders article was
published, and the author of the article on P&eacute;ron did not
carry out his predecessor's undertaking. It is to be presumed
that Walckenaer would have exhibited the facts set out above.
Alfred de Lacaze, in his article on Flinders in the Nouvelle
Biographie Generale 17 932, wrote that the excuses given for the
imprisonment of Flinders formed "pauvres pretextes"; but declared
that the seals put on Flinders' papers in Mauritius were
"loyalement respecte pendant les six ans que dura la captivite du
navigateur anglais." That was true. It is a pleasure to
acknowledge that all the references to Flinders which the author
has seen in French works unanimously and strongly condemn the
treatment of him, and do ample justice to his splendid
qualities.)</p>
<p>But it is quite easy to account for the superior cartography
of the two gulfs and Kangaroo Island. Le Geographe visited this
region twice. In April 1802, after meeting Flinders in Encounter
Bay, Baudin sailed west, and endeavoured to penetrate the two
gulfs. But his corvette drew too much water to permit him to go
far, and he determined to give up the attempt, and to devote "une
seconde campagne" to "la reconnaissance complete de ces deux
grands enfoncements."* In Sydney, Governor King permitted him to
purchase a small locally constructed vessel of light
draught&mdash;called the Casuarina, because she was built of
she-oak&mdash;with which to explore rivers and shallow waters.
The command of this boat was entrusted to Lieutenant Louis de
Freycinet, the future cartographer and part historian of the
expedition; and the charts of the two gulfs and Kangaroo Island
were made by, or under the superintendence of, that officer.
Freycinet was not with Le Geographe on her first cruise in these
waters, and was not responsible for the original drawings upon
which his charts of the Terre Napoleon coasts eastward of Cape
Jervis were founded. But the fact that he surveyed the gulfs and
Kangaroo Island on the second visit, in 1803, is quite sufficient
to account for the improved cartography of this region in the
French atlas. Whatever we may think of the part played by
Freycinet in relation to Flinders and the history of the
expedition, his professional ability was of a high character. All
the charting work done by him, when he had not to depend upon the
rough drawings of inferior men, was very good. His interest in
scientific navigation was deep, and when, in 1817, he was given
the command of a fresh French expedition, consisting of the
Uranie and the Physicienne, the large folio atlas produced by him
indicated that he had studied the technicalities of his
profession to excellent purpose.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 3 11.)</p>
<p>The superiority of the work done by Baudin's expedition in the
vicinity of the two gulfs, then, was not due to any fraudulent
use of Flinders' material, but simply to the fact that there was
a competent officer in charge of it at that time; and there is
nothing on the charts for which Freycinet was personally
responsible to justify the belief that his work claiming to be
original was not genuinely his own. When, in 1824, he published a
second edition of the Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres
Australes,* he repudiated with quiet dignity the suggestion that
the work of the English navigator had been plagiarised.** Except
for the Port Phillip part of the work, we might fairly say that
history has commonly done him and his confreres a serious
injustice.</p>
<p class="foot">(* In octavo volumes; the first edition was in
quarto.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** "C'est assez," he wrote, "repousser des
accusations odieuses et envenimees, fondees sur des idees
chimeriques, avec absence de toute espece de preuve. Le temps,
qui calme les passions humaines et permet toujours a la verite de
reprendre ses droits, fera justice d'accusations concues avec
legerete et soutenues avec inconvenance. P&eacute;ron et Flinders
sont morts; l'un et l'autre ont des titres certains a notre
estime, a notre admiration; ils vivront, ainsi que leurs travaux,
dans la memoire des hommes, et les nuages que je cherche a
dissiper auront disparu sans retour" (volume 1 Preface page 11).
One cannot but be touched by that appeal; but at the same time it
is to be observed that in the very preface in which he made it,
Freycinet did far less than justice to the work of Flinders.)</p>
<p>But we have seen that, although Port Phillip was included in
the French charts, and inside soundings were actually shown,
neither the port nor the entrance was seen by the expedition. How
was that information obtained?</p>
<p>Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste lay in Sydney harbour from
June 20 to November 18, 1802, their afflicted crews receiving
medical treatment, and their officers enjoying the hospitality of
Governor King. Flinders and Lieutenant John Murray, who
discovered Port Phillip, were both there during part of the same
time. It was then that the French learnt of the existence of the
great harbour of which Baudin was ignorant when he met Flinders
in Encounter Bay; and it is highly probable that by some means
they obtained a copy of the chart which they saw.</p>
<p>Grounds for stating that that is a probability will be
advanced a little later. But let us first see how the drawing of
Port Phillip that does appear on the Terre Napoleon charts got
there.</p>
<p>It was taken, as Freycinet acknowledged,* "from a manuscript
chart prepared on the English ship Armiston, in 1804. In 1806 the
French frigate La Piedmontoise captured the British ship Fame.
Amongst the papers found on board was this manuscript chart. It
so happened that one of the officers of La Piedmontoise was
Lieutenant Charles Baudin des Ardennes, who had been a junior
officer on Le Naturaliste from 1800 to 1804. (He was no relative
of Captain Baudin. The family of Baudin des Ardennes was very
well known in France; and this officer became a distinguished
French admiral.) He took possession of the manuscript, and handed
it over to Freycinet, who made use of it in preparing his
charts.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 3 430.)</p>
<p>Probably it was a very rough chart; but even so, if Freycinet
had had anything like a drawing of Port Phillip made on Le
Geographe, he would have turned out a better piece of work. Not
only is the outline very defective, but the "lay" of the Nepean
peninsula is so grossly wrong that this alone would suffice to
show that Freycinet did not merely correct his chart with the aid
of that captured from the Fame, but that the whole drawing of
Port Phillip was fitted in, like a patch. However ill a navigator
may draw, he always knows whether a coast along which he is
sailing runs west or north-west. A mariner's apprentice would
know that. But on the Terre Napoleon charts, the peninsula lies
due east and west, whereas in reality, as the reader will see by
reference to any good map, it has a decidedly north-westerly
inclination. The patch was not well put on. The consequence of
this bad cobbling was to give a box-like, rectangular appearance
to the bay, utterly unlike the reality. The east and west sides
were carried about as far as Mornington and St. Leonards
respectively, in two nearly straight and parallel lines; Swan Bay
and Swan Island were missed altogether; and the graceful curve of
the coast round by Sorrento and Dromana&mdash;a curve most
grateful to the eye on a day when sea and sky are blue, and the
silver sands and white cliffs shine in the clear light&mdash;was
tortured into a sharp bend. It was a very rough bit of work.</p>
<p>The fact that an expedition sent out for discovery purposes,
and which named a considerable extent of the coast-line traversed
after the Emperor who had enabled it to be despatched, had to
depend upon a manuscript accidentally obtained from a captured
British merchant ship for a chart of the principal port in the
territory so flauntingly denominated, hardly calls for comment.
But even when we are in possession of this information, we are
still left in some doubt as to whether the French had not some
sort of a drawing of Port Phillip before they left Sydney.
Otherwise the course pursued by their commodore after quitting
that port is quite unaccountable. The following reasons induce
that belief.</p>
<p>When Baudin bade an affectionate and grateful farewell to
Governor King at Sydney on November 18, he sailed direct to King
Island, which is situated in Bass Strait, on the 40th parallel of
south latitude, about midway between the south-east of Cape Otway
and the north-west corner of Tasmania. Le Geographe was
accompanied by Le Naturaliste and the little Casuarina. A camp
was established on the island, which was fully charted. Baudin
had missed it on his former voyage, though he had sailed within a
few miles of it. It will be remembered that when Flinders
conversed with him in Encounter Bay, and "inquired concerning a
large island said to lie in the western entrance of Bass Strait,"
Baudin said he had not seen it, "and seemed to doubt much of its
existence."* But Flinders found it easily enough, and spent a
little time there before entering Port Phillip. It was doubtless
this inquiry of Flinders that induced Baudin to mark down on his
chart a purely fictitious island far westward of the actual one,
and to inscribe against it the words, "it is believed that an
island exists in this latitude."**</p>
<p class="foot">(*Flinders, Voyage 1 188.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** "On croit qu'il existe une ile par cette
latitude." See the chart, a little west of Cape Bridgewater (Cap
Duquesne).)</p>
<p>As Baudin afterwards found the real island, it is curious that
the imaginary one should have been kept upon his chart; but there
is a reason for that also. While the French lay at King Island,
most of the work done up to date&mdash;geographical, zoological,
and other&mdash;was collected and sent back to France on Le
Naturaliste; Le Geographe and the Casuarina remaining to finish
the exploratory voyage. Le Naturaliste sailed for Europe on
December 16, and entered the port of Havre on June 6, 1803. Had
Baudin lived to return to France, and to supervise the completion
of the charts, it is most probable that he would have erased the
island which was merely supposed, as he had since charted the
real one; but Freycinet, not having been present at the meeting
with Flinders, and knowing nothing of the reason which induced
Baudin to set it down, left it there&mdash;a quaint little
fragment of corroboration of the truth of Flinders' narrative of
the Encounter Bay incident.</p>
<p>Now, when at the end of December Le Geographe and the
Casuarina sailed from King Island&mdash;the naturalists having in
the interval profitably enjoyed themselves in collecting plants,
insects, and marine specimens&mdash;they made direct for Kangaroo
Island, four hundred miles away, to resume the work which had
been commenced in the gulfs in the previous April and May. The
whole of the movements of the ships up to this time are to be
read in the printed logs appended to volume 3 of the Voyage de
Decouvertes. Baudin made no call at Port Phillip, nor did one of
his three vessels visit the harbour either before or after
reaching King Island. But by this time Baudin knew all about the
port, and it is surely difficult to suppose that he would have
sailed straight past it in December unless at length he had it
marked on his rough charts. His officers knew about it too,
though none of them had seen it; for Captain Hamelin of Le
Naturaliste reported when he reached Paris, that, as he left King
Island, he met and spoke to "an English goelette on her way to
Port Philips [sic], south-east coast."* It was the Cumberland,
Lieutenant Charles Robbins, bound on a mission to be explained
later.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 27 Thermidor.)</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to assume that when Le Naturaliste sailed
for France on December 16, and the two other ships for Kangaroo
Island later in the same month, Baudin was quite satisfied that
he had in his possession as complete a representation of the
whole of the Terre Napoleon coasts westward to the gulfs, as
would justify him in resuming the work from that situation.
Clearly, then, he obtained a Port Phillip drawing of some kind
before he left Sydney.</p>
<p>From what source could Baudin have obtained such a chart,
however rough and partial?</p>
<p>Up to the time when he lay at Port Jackson, only two ships had
ever entered Port Phillip. These were the Lady Nelson, under
Murray's command, in February 1802&mdash;the harbour having been
discovered in the previous month&mdash;and the Investigator,
under Flinders, in April and May. No other keels had, from the
moment of the discovery until Baudin's vessels finally left these
coasts, breasted the broad expanse of waters at the head of which
the great city of Melbourne now stands. The next ship to pass the
heads was the Cumberland, which, early in 1803, entered with
Surveyor Grimes on board, to make the first complete survey of
the port. But by that time Baudin was far away. From one or other
of the two available sources, therefore, Baudin must have
obtained a drawing, assuming that he did obtain one in Sydney;
and if he did not, his sailing past the port, when he had an
opportunity of entering it in December, was surely as
extraordinary a piece of wilful negligence as is to be found in
the annals of exploration.</p>
<p>It is possible that Baudin or one of his officers saw some
drawing made on the Lady Nelson. If they saw one made by Murray
himself, it is not likely to have been a very good one. Murray
was not a skilled cartographer. Governor King, who liked him, and
wished to secure promotion for him, had to confess in writing to
the Duke of Portland, that he did not "possess the qualities of
an astronomer and surveyor," which was putting the matter in a
very friendly fashion. If a chart or crude drawing by Murray had
been obtained, Freycinet might still be glad to get the Fame
chart which he used.</p>
<p>Both in his book and his correspondence Flinders mentions
having shown charts to Baudin; and though the French commodore
did not reciprocate by showing any of his work to Flinders, we
may fairly regard that as due to reluctance to challenge
comparisons. Flinders was without a rival in his generation for
the beauty, completeness, and accuracy of his hydrographical
work, and Captain Baudin's excuses probably sprang from pride.
The reason he gave was that his charts were to be finished in
Paris. But there was nothing to prevent his showing the
preliminary drawings to Flinders, and as a fact he had shown them
to King. If Flinders had had a sight of them he would have
detected at a glance the absence of any indication of Port
Phillip. But we learn from the Moniteur of 27 Thermidor,
Revolutionary Year 11 (August 15, 1803), which published a
progress report of the expedition, that the charts sent home by
Baudin were very rough. Part of the coast was described as being
"figuree assez grossierement et sans details."</p>
<p>Flinders, it should be explained, did not publish the chart
which he made when he entered Port Phillip with the Investigator,
because by the time when he was preparing his work for
publication, a copy of the complete survey chart made by Grimes
had been supplied to him by the Admiralty. He used Grimes's
drawing in preference to his own&mdash;acknowledging the
authorship, of course&mdash;because when he found Port Phillip he
was not in a position to examine it thoroughly. His supplies,
after his long voyage, had become depleted, and he could not
delay.</p>
<p>It is most likely that the French learnt of the existence of
Port Phillip from Flinders, though not at all likely that they
were able to obtain a copy of his drawing. If Baudin got one at
all, it must have been Murray's.</p>
<p>Freycinet did not acknowledge on any of his charts the source
whence he obtained his Port Phillip drawing. Obviously, it would
have been honest to do so. All he did was to insert two lines at
the bottom of the page in that part of volume 3 dealing with
navigation details, where very few readers would observe the
reference.</p>
<p>There remains the question: Why did General Decaen keep
Flinders' third log-book when restoring to him all his other
papers? The reason suggested by Flinders himself is probably the
right one: that the governor retained it in order that he might
be better able to justify himself to Napoleon in case he was
blamed for disregarding the passport. He "did not choose to have
his accusations disproved by the production either of the
original or of an authenticated copy." It is difficult to see
what other motive Decaen can have had. The sheer cantankerous
desire to annoy and injure a man who had angered him can hardly
have been so strong within him as even to cause a disregard of
the common proprietary rights of his prisoner. The book could
have been of no use to Decaen for any other purpose. Its contents
had no bearing on the Terre Napoleon coasts, as they related to a
period subsequent to Flinders' voyage there. Doubtless the book
showed why the Cumberland called at Mauritius, but the reason for
that was palpable. The idea that a leaky twenty-nine ton
schooner, with her pumps out of gear, could have put into Port
Louis with any aggressive intent against the great French nation,
which had a powerful squadron under Admiral Linois in the Indian
Ocean, was too absurd for consideration. But Decaen was plainly
hunting for reasons for detaining Flinders, and it is possible
that he found a shred of justification in the despatches which
the Cumberland was carrying from Governor King to the British
Government; though the protracted character of the imprisonment,
after every other member of the ship's company had been set free,
cannot have been due to that motive.</p>
<p>It is most probable that representations made to Decaen by
P&eacute;ron, before Le Geographe sailed, had an effect upon the
mind of the governor which induced him to regard any ship flying
the British flag as an enemy to French policy. P&eacute;ron, from
what he had seen of the growth of Port Jackson, and from the
prompt audacity and pugnacious assertiveness of an incident which
occurred at King Island&mdash;to be described in the ninth
chapter&mdash;had conceived an inflated idea of the enormity of
British pretensions in the southern hemisphere. He was convinced
that, using the Sydney settlement as a base of operations, the
British intended to dominate the whole Pacific Ocean, even to the
degree of menacing the Spanish colonies of South America. On 20th
Frimaire, Revolutionary Year 12 (December 11, 1803), four days
before Le Geographe sailed from the island, P&eacute;ron set his
views on paper in a report to Decaen, stating that his interviews
with officers, magistrates, clergymen, and other classes of
people in Sydney, had convinced him that his anticipations were
well founded. He pointed out that already the English were
extending their operations to the Sandwich, Friendly, Society,
Navigator, and other islands of the South Pacific; that at
Norfolk Island they had a colony of between fifteen hundred and
sixteen hundred people, and found its timber to be of great value
for shipbuilding; and that gradually the British Government, by
extending their military posts and trading stations across the
ocean, would sooner or later establish themselves within striking
distance of Chili and Peru.* P&eacute;ron pointed to the
political insecurity of the Spanish-American colonies, and
predicted that the outbreak of revolution in them, possibly with
the connivance of the English, would further the deep designs of
that absorbent and dominating nation.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron's report to General Decaen is
given in M. Henri Prentout's valuable treatise, L'Ile de France
sous Decaen, 1803 to 1810; essai sur la politique coloniale du
premier empire, Paris 1901 page 380. M. Prentout's book is
extremely fair, and, based as it is mainly upon the voluminous
papers of General Decaen, preserved in his native town of Caen,
is authoritative.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** A French author of later date,
Prevost-Paradol (La France Nouvelle, published in 1868),
predicted that some day "a new Monroe doctrine would forbid old
Europe, in the name of the United States of Australia, to put
foot upon an isle of the Pacific.")</p>
<p>Decaen was pondering over P&eacute;ron's inflammatory
memorandum when the lame little Cumberland staggered into Port
Louis. Here, a victim ready to hand, was one of the instruments
of the extension of British dominion, the foremost explorer in
the service of the British Crown. True, Flinders had a passport
from the French Government, but it was made out, not for the
Cumberland but for the Investigator. To take advantage of such a
point, when the Investigator had had to be abandoned as
unseaworthy, was manifestly to seize the flimsiest pretext for
imprisoning the man whom the winds and waves had brought within
his power.* But Decaen was in the temper for regarding the
English navigator as a spy, and he imprisoned him first and
looked for evidence to justify himself afterwards. He had just
read P&eacute;ron's report; and "it was not unnatural," says a
learned French historian somewhat naively, "that the
Captain-General should attribute to the English savant the
intention of playing at Port Louis the role that our naturalist
had played at Port Jackson."** The imputation is unjust to
P&eacute;ron, who had not "spied" in Port Jackson, because the
English there had manifested no disposition to conceal. Nothing
that he reported was what the Government had wished him not to
see; they had helped him to see all that he desired; and his
preposterous political inferences, though devoid of foundation,
hardly amounted to a positive breach of hospitality. Besides, had
Decaen feared that the release of Flinders would be dangerous
because he might report the weak state of the defences of the
island, the same would have applied to the liberation of the
junior officers and men of the Cumberland. They, however, were
permitted to return to England after a brief period of
detention.</p>
<p class="foot">(* "C'etait une chicane," says M. Henri Prentout,

<p class="foot">(** Ibid.)</p>
<p>Decaen also alleged that Flinders was personally rude to him
in presenting himself before him "le chapeau sur la tete."
Flinders was undoubtedly smarting under a sense of wrong at the
time, but discourtesy was by no means a feature of his character;
and to imprison a man for six and a half years for not taking his
hat off would have been queer conduct from a son of the
Revolution!</p>
<p>But Decaen's reasons for his treatment of his captive were not
consistent with themselves. He gave quite another set in a report
to his Government, alleging that the detention of Flinders was
justified as a measure of reprisals on account of the action of
the English at Pondicherry and the Cape; and, entirely in the
manner of a man looking for a shred of justification for doing
the unjustifiable, he alleged that vigorous aggressive action on
his part was necessary, because it was evident to him that the
English meant to absorb the whole commerce of the Indian Ocean,
the Pacific, and the China Sea, basing his statements on the
report of P&eacute;ron, of which he sent a copy to Paris. Not
only did he represent that the British intended to annihilate
French power in India, and supplant Spanish authority in South
America, but he regarded their repeated visits to Timor, their
action in regard to Java in 1798, and their establishment at
Penang, off the Malay Peninsula, as clear evidence that the
"greedy and devouring jaws" of the English lion were ready to
swallow the Dutch East Indies likewise. How these nefarious
designs afforded a reason for imprisoning Matthew Flinders is not
apparent; but Decaen was pleading for the despatch of troops to
enable him to make an effective attack upon the English in
India,* and he seemed to suppose that the holding up of the
explorer would give satisfaction in Paris, and further the
accomplishment of his plans.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Prentout, page 383.)</p>
<p>In October 1810, only three months after the liberation of
Flinders, the Isle of France was closely blockaded by a British
squadron under Vice-Admiral Bertie. In December, General Decaen
agreed to capitulate, and Major-General Abercromby took
possession of the island, which has ever since been a British
dependency. It is unfortunate that the British officers did not
at this time remember that Decaen had kept Flinders' third
log-book. He had written to Vice-Admiral Bertie from the Cape of
Good Hope, in July 1810, requesting that "if any occurrences
should put General Decaen within his power," he would demand the
volume from him. But the request was overlooked, "in the tumult
of events," when the capitulation took place.* It is, however,
significant of the honour in which naval men held the intrepid
navigator, that after the capitulation the British officers
refused to dine with Decaen, on account of his treatment of
Flinders.** It was not the first time that gentlemen wearing the
naval uniform of England had refused to eat at his table.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Flinders, letter to the Admiralty, in
Historical Records of New South Wales 7 529.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Souvenirs d'un vieux colon, quoted by
Prentout, page 660.)</p>
<p>On January 6, 1811, a French schooner was captured bearing
despatches from France. Amongst them was a despatch informing
Decaen that Napoleon had superseded him in the governorship.*
Before he could obey the summons to France, the British had
captured the island and sent him home. It is scarcely likely that
the Emperor's order of recall was due to disapproval of Decaen's
conduct in continuing Flinders' imprisonment after the French
Government had ordered his release, although there is in
existence a decree signed by Napoleon, dated March 11, 1806,
"authorising the Minister of Marine to restore his ship to
Captain Flinders of the English schooner Cumberland."** As
Flinders was not released till July 1810, Decaen certainly did
disregard the Emperor's command for three years&mdash;from July
1807, when the decree was received by him, though it is to be
remembered that he restored the trunk of papers in the very next
month (August). But Napoleon had signified to Decaen's
aide-de-camp, Barois&mdash;who was sent to France in 1804 with
special instructions to mention the Flinders affair to the
Emperor&mdash;that he approved of what the general had done;***
and Napoleon was scarcely likely to be gravely concerned about
the calamities of an English sea captain at that particular time.
It is true that between 1804 and the release, Sir Joseph Banks
and other influential men in the world of learning had been
active in urging the liberation of the navigator. The venerable
Bougainville was one of these. It is also true that Napoleon
prided himself on his interest in scientific work. But Decaen had
been a good servant, placed in a difficult situation, where there
was much responsibility and little glory to be won; and even if
the Emperor had felt annoyed at the disregard of orders, the
matter did not affect his major lines of policy, and Decaen was
safe in reckoning that the Imperial displeasure would not be
severely displayed. But why he risked giving offence to Napoleon
at all by the disregard of orders, there is, it would seem,
nothing in Decaen's papers to show. M. Prentout, who has studied
them carefully, is driven back on the suggestion that the
prolongation of the captivity was due to
"entetement"&mdash;stubbornness. But it cost the administration
four hundred and fifty francs per month to maintain Flinders,****
and it seems improbable, when the finances of the island were
difficult to adjust and severe economies were enforced, that
Decaen, an economical man, would have kept up this expense year
after year, disregarding alike the protests of the prisoner, the
demands of Lord Wellesley and Admiral Pellew, and later, the
direct orders of the French Government, unless some influence
were at work and some practical interest furnished a motive. The
obstinacy of Decaen is not a sufficient reason. We know, however,
that it suited Freycinet very well to have Flinders detained till
he could get his own charts ready, and that his atlas was
precipitately published in the first instance. The connection
between these occurrences and Decaen's cruel perversity must, in
the absence of clear proof, be bridged by inference, if at
all.</p>

</center>
<p>Napoleon was, however, a soldier after all&mdash;much else as
well, but a soldier first and foremost; and so was Decaen. When
the general returned to France, his Imperial master had urgent
need for stern, stubborn, fighting men of his type. He submitted
to a court-martial* in reference to the surrender of Mauritius,
but was exonerated. The discretion that he had exercised in not
obeying the decree for the liberation of Flinders was evidently
not made the ground of serious complaint against him, for in 1813
we find him commanding the army of Catalonia, participating
gallantly in the campaign of the Pyrenees, and distinguishing
himself at Barcelona under Marshal Suchet. For this service he
was made a Comte of the Empire. When Napoleon was banished to
Elba the Comte Decaen donned the white cockade, and took service
under Louis XVIII, but on the return of his old master he, like
Ney and some other of the tough warriors of the First Empire,
forswore his fidelity to the Bourbons. He was one of the generals
left to guard the southern frontiers of France while Napoleon
played his last stake for dominion in the terrific war game that
ended with the cataclysm of Waterloo. That event terminated
Decaen's military course. For a while he was imprisoned, but his
life was not taken, as was that of the gallant Ney; and in a few
months he was liberated at the instance of the Duchesse
d'Angouleme. Thenceforth he lived a colourless, quiet, penurious
life in the vicinity of his native Caen, regretting not at all,
one fancies, the ruin of the useful career of the enterprising
English navigator. His poverty was honourable, for he had handled
large funds during the Consulate and Empire; and there is
probably as much sincerity as pathos in what he said to Soult and
Gouvion-Saint-Cyr in his declining days, that nothing remained to
him after thirty years of honourable service and the occupancy of
high offices, except the satisfaction of having at all times done
his duty. He died in 1832. His official papers fill no fewer than
one hundred and forty-nine volumes and are preserved in the
library of the ancient Norman city whose name he bore as his
own.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER 6. THE MOTIVES OF
BONAPARTE.</h2>
<p>Did Bonaparte desire to establish French colonial dominions in
Australia?<br>
The case stated.</p>
<p>We will now turn to quite another aspect of the Terre Napoleon
story, and one which to many readers will be more fruitful in
interest. An investigation of the work of Baudin's expedition on
the particular stretch of coast to which was applied the name of
the most potent personage in modern history has necessarily
demanded close application to geographical details, and a minute
scrutiny of claims and occurrences. We enter into a wider
historical realm when we begin to consider the motives which led
Bonaparte to despatch the expedition of 1800 to 1804. Here we are
no longer confined to shores which, at the time when we are
concerned with them, were the abode of desolation and the nursery
of a solitude uninterrupted for untallied ages, save by the
screams of innumerable sea-birds, or, occasionally, here and
there, by the corroboree cries of naked savages, whose
kitchen-middens, feet thick with shells, still betray the places
where they feasted.</p>
<p>We wish to know why Bonaparte, who had overturned the
Directory by the audacity of Brumaire and hoisted himself into
the dominating position of First Consul in the year before Le
Geographe and Le Naturaliste were sent to the South Seas,
authorised the undertaking of that enterprise. Was it what it
purported to be, an expedition of exploration, or was it a move
in a cunning game of state-craft by a player whose board, as some
would have us believe, was the whole planet? Had Bonaparte, so
soon after ascending to supremacy in the Government of France,
already conceived the dazzling dream of a vast world-empire
acknowledging his sway, and was this a step towards the
achievement of it? If not that, was he desirous by this means of
striking a blow at the prestige of Great Britain, whose hero
Nelson had smashed his fleet at the Nile two years before? Or had
he ideals in the direction of establishing French colonial
dominions in southern latitudes, and did he desire to obtain
accurate information as to where the tricolour might most
advantageously be planted? It ought to be possible, out of the
copious store of available material relative to Napoleon's era,
to form a sound opinion on this fascinating subject. But we had
better resolve to have the material before we do formulate a
conclusion, and not jump to one regardless of evidence, or the
lack of it.</p>
<p>In this inquiry very little assistance is given to the student
by those classical historians of the period to whose voluminous
writings reference might naturally be made. There is not, for
example, the slightest allusion to Baudin's expedition or the
Terre Napoleon incidents in Thiers' twenty-tomed Histoire du
Consulat et de l'Empire; nor can the reader get much assistance
from consulting many British works on the same epoch. An
endeavour has, however, been made to set the facts in their right
perspective, by a brilliant contemporary English historian, Dr.
John Holland Rose, somewhat curtly in his Revolutionary and
Napoleonic Era, but more fully in his Life of Napoleon.* The
present writer, after an independent study of the facts, is
unable to share Dr. Holland Rose's view, as will presently
appear, but the desire being less to urge an opinion than to
present the case in its true relations, it will be convenient to
state Dr. Rose's presentment of it before proceeding to look at
it from other aspects.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Life of Napoleon 1 379 to 383. Still later, in
his lecture on "England's Commercial Struggle with Napoleon,"
included in the Lectures on the Nineteenth Century, edited by
F.A. Kirkpatrick (1908), Dr. Holland Rose pursues the same
theme.)</p>
<p>"The unknown continent of Australia," says the historian,
"appealed to Napoleon's imagination, which pictured its solitudes
transformed by French energy into a second fatherland." Bonaparte
had "early turned his eyes to that land." He took a copy of
Cook's voyages with him to Egypt, and no sooner was he firmly
installed as First Consul, than he "planned with the Institute of
France a great French expedition to New Holland." It is
represented that the Terre Napoleon maps show that "under the
guise of being an emissary of civilisation, Commodore Baudin was
prepared to claim half the continent for France."* Indeed, his
inquiry "about the extent of British claims on the Pacific coast
was so significant as to elicit from Governor King the reply that
the whole of Van Diemen's Land and of the coast from Cape Howe on
the south of the mainland to Cape York on the north, was British
territory." The facts relative to the awakening of suspicion in
Governor King's mind&mdash;to be discussed hereafter&mdash;are
likewise stated; together with those affecting the settlements of
Hobart and Port Phillip; and it is concluded that "the plans of
Napoleon for the acquisition of Van Diemen's Land and the middle
of Australia, had an effect like that which the ambition of
Montcalm, Dupleix, Lally, and P&eacute;ron has exerted on the
ultimate destiny of many a vast and fertile territory."**</p>
<p class="foot">(* Ibid page 381. The Terre Napoleon region is
far from being half the continent of Australia, if that be what
Dr. Holland Rose's words mean. One observes, by the way, a
tendency on the part of English writers to use very small maps
when speaking of the size of things in Australia.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Ibid page 382. One or two errors of fact may
as well be indicated. Murray's discovery of Port Phillip was made
in 1802, not in 1801, as stated on page 380 of the Life of
Napoleon; the title of Flinders' book was not "A Voyage of
Discovery to the Australian Isles" (page 381), but A Voyage to
Terra Australis; Bass, the discoverer of the Strait bearing his
name, was not a lieutenant (page 380), but a surgeon on H.M.S.
Reliance. The Freycinet Peninsula, the French name of which is
mentioned as being "still retained" (page 381), is not, it should
be understood, on the Terre Napoleon coast at all, but in Eastern
Tasmania. Dr. Rose's error as to the retention of other French
names has been dealt with in Chapter 4.)</p>
<p>These passages submit with definiteness the view that
Bonaparte, in 1800, despatched Baudin's ships from motives of
political policy. He had "plans" for the requisition of territory
in Australia; he wished to found a "second fatherland" for the
French; Baudin was "prepared to claim half the continent for
France." Now, the reader who turns to Dr. Holland Rose's book *
for references to proofs of these statements, will be
disappointed. The learned author, who is usually liberal in his
citation of authorities, here confines himself to the Voyage de
Decouvertes of P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, the Voyage of
Flinders, and the collection of documents in the seven volumes of
the Historical Records of New South Wales&mdash;all works of
first-class importance, but none of them bearing out the broad
general statements as to the First Consul's plans and intentions.
Not a scrap of evidence is adduced from memoirs, letters, or
state papers. To represent Napoleon as obsessed with magnificent
ideas of universal dominion, scanning, like Milton's Satan from
the mountain height, the immensity of many realms, and aspiring
to rule them all&mdash;to do this is to present an enthralling
picture, inflaming the imagination of the reader; and, perhaps,
of the writer too. But we must beware of drawing an inference and
painting it to look like a fact; we must regard historical data
through the clear white glass of criticism, not through the
coloured window of a gorgeous generalisation.</p>
<p class="foot">(* He who turns to it without reading it through
will miss an opulent source of profit and pleasure.)</p>
<p>The remainder of our task, then, shall be devoted to examining
the origins of Baudin's expedition. We will inquire into the
instructions given to the commander; we will follow his vessels
with a careful eye to any incidents that may point to ulterior
political purposes; we will have regard to the suspicions
engendered at the time, how far they were justifiable, and what
consequences followed from them; we will search for motives; and
we will look at what the expedition did, in case there should by
any chance thereby be disclosed any hint of an aspiration towards
territorial acquisition. We will try to regard the evidence as a
whole, the object being&mdash;as the object of all honest
historical inquiry must be&mdash;to ascertain the truth about it,
freed from those jealousies and prejudices which, so freely
deposited at the time, tend to consolidate and petrify until, as
with the guano massed hard on islets in Australasian seas, it is
difficult to get at the solid rock beneath for the accretions
upon it, and sometimes not easy to discriminate rock from
accretion.</p>

<p>French interest in southern exploration did not commence nor
did it cease with the expedition of 1800 to 1804. We fall into a
radical error if we regard that as an isolated endeavour. It was,
in truth, a link in a chain: one of a series of efforts made by
the French to solve what was, during the eighteenth century, a
problem with which the scientific intellect of Europe was much
concerned.</p>
<p>The tardy and piecemeal fashion in which definiteness was
given to southern latitudes on the map of the world makes a
curious chapter in the history of geographical research. After
the ships of Magellan and Drake had circumnavigated the globe,
and a very large part of America had been mapped, there still
lay, south of the tracks of those adventurers who rounded the
Horn and breasted the Pacific, a region that remained
unknown&mdash;a Terra Australis, Great Southern Continent, or
Terra Incognita as it was vaguely and variously termed.
Map-makers, having no certain data concerning this vast uncharted
area, commonly sprawled across the extremity of the southern
hemisphere a purely fanciful outline of imaginary land. Terra
Australis was the playground of the cartographers of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They seemed to abhor blank
spaces. Some of the most beautiful of the old maps make the
oceans busy with spouting whales, sportive dolphins, and galleons
with bellying sails; but what to do with the great staring
expanse of vacancy at the bottom their authors did not know. So
they drew a crooked line across the map to represent land, and
stuck upon it the label Terra Australis, or one of the other
designations just mentioned. The configuration of the territory
on different maps did not agree, and not one of them signified a
coast with anything like the form of the real Great Southern
Continent.</p>
<p>To the period of fancy succeeded that of patchwork. Came the
Dutch, often blown out of their true course from the Cape of Good
Hope to the Spice Islands, and stumbling upon the shores of
Western Australia. To some such accident we probably owe the
piece of improved cartography shown upon Emmerie Mollineux's map,
which Hakluyt inserted in some copies of the second edition of
his Principal Navigations, and which Shakespeare is supposed to
have had in mind when, in a merry scene in Twelfth Night, he made
Maria say of Malvolio (3 2 85): "He does smile his face into more
lines than is in the new map with the AUGMENTATION OF THE
INDIES."* This map marks an improvement, in the sense that an
approach to the truth, probably founded on actual observation, is
an improvement on a large, comprehensive piece of guess work.
Emmerie Mollineux expunged the imaginary region, and substituted
a small tongue of land, shaped like a thimble. It was doubtless
copied from some Dutch chart; and though we must not look for
precision of outline at so early a date, it is sufficient to show
that some navigator had seen, hereabouts, a real piece of
Australia, and had made a note of what it looked like. It is not
much, but, rightly regarded, it is like the first gleam of light
on the dark sky where the dawn is to paint its radiance.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Mr. Charles Coote's paper in Transactions
of New Shakespeare Society, 1877 to 1879. He read the phrase
"augmentation of the Indies," as referring to this and some other
additions to the map of the world, now for the first time shown.
In those days, of course, "the Indies" meant pretty well
everything out of Europe, including America. It is curious that
Flinders called the aboriginals whom he saw in Port Phillip
"Indians." Probably all coloured peoples were "Indians" to seamen
even so late as his day. There is a fine copy of the map referred
to in volume 1 of the 1903 edition of Hakluyt, edited by
Professor Walter Raleigh.)</p>
<p>English Dampier (1686 to 1688, and 1699 to 1701) and Dutch
Tasman (1642 to 1644) made the most substantial contributions to
the world's knowledge of the true form of Australia to be
credited to any individual navigators before the coming of Cook,
the greatest of all.</p>
<p>It is very strange that so long a period as a century and a
half should have been allowed to lapse between Tasman's very
remarkable voyage and Flinders' completion of the outline of
Australia, and that three-quarters of a century should have
separated the explorations of Dampier and Cook. Here, crooned
over by her great gum forests, baring her broad breast of plains
to the sun and moon, lay a land holding within her immense
solitudes unimaginable wealth; genial in climate, rich in soil,
abounding in mineral treasures, fit to be a home for happy,
industrious millions. Yet, while avarice and enterprise schemed
and fought for the west and the east, this treasury of the south
remained unsolicited. It is not for us to regret that Australia
was left for a race that knew how to woo her with affection and
to conquer her with their science and their will, yet we can but
wonder that fortune should have been so tardy and so reticent in
disclosing a fifth division of the globe.</p>
<p>While this piecing together of the outline of the continent
was proceeding, speculation was naturally rife among men of
science as to what countries southern latitudes contained, and
what their capabilities were. It was essentially a scientific
problem awaiting solution; and it is not surprising that the
French, quick-brained, inquisitive, eager in pursuit of ideas,
should have been active in this field.</p>
<p>Their intellectual concern with South Sea discovery may be
said to date from the publication of the Petites Lettres of
Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He was, like some of whom
Browning has written, a "person of some importance in his day,"
and his writings on physics are still mentioned with respect in
works devoted to the history of science. But he is perhaps
chiefly remembered as the savant whom Frederick the Great
attracted to his court during a period of aloofness from the
scintillating Voltaire, and who consequently became a writhing
target for the jealous ridicule of that waspish wit. Poor
Maupertuis, unhappy in his exit from life, would appear to have
been restless after it, for his ghost is averred to have stalked
in the hall of the Academy of Berlin, and to have been seen by a
brother professor there, the remarkable phenomenon being solemnly
recorded in the Transactions of that learned body.* But of far
more practical importance than the appearance of his perturbed
shade, was the effect of his Petites Lettres, which suggested
twelve projects for the advancement of knowledge, one of which
was the promotion of discovery in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Sir Walter Scott's Demonology and
Witchcraft, Letter 1.)</p>
<p>Shortly after its publication, Maupertuis' proposition was
discussed by a society of accomplished students meeting at Dijon,
the ancient capital of Burgundy. A member of the Society to whom
much deference was paid, was Charles de Brosses, lawyer, scholar,
and President of the Parlement of the Province.* De Brosses was
an industrious student and writer, the translator of Sallust into
French, and author of several valuable historical and
philological works, including a number of learned papers which
may be read&mdash;or not&mdash;in the stout calf-bound quartos
enshrining the records of the Academy of Inscriptions.** He was
also Voltaire's landlord at Tournay, and had a quarrel with him
about a matter of firewood; but De Brosses was a lawyer, whilst
Voltaire was only a philosopher and a poet, so that of course the
result was "qu'il enrage d'avoir enfin a payer."***</p>
<p class="foot">(* The local parliaments were abolished in the
reign of Louis XV, reinstated by Louis XVI, and finally swept
away in the stormy demolition of ancient institutions to make
ground for the constitution of 1791.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** His papers in that regiment of tomes range
over a period of fifty years, from 1746 to 1796. They deal
chiefly with Roman history, and especially with points suggested
by the author's profound study of Sallust. Gibbon pays De Brosses
the compliment of quoting two of his works, and commends his
"SINGULAR diligence," with emphasis on the adjective. (See
Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Bury's edition 4
37 and 7 168.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Lanson's Voltaire page 139.)</p>
<p>The discussion at Dijon was more fruitful in results than such
colloquies usually are. De Brosses was especially struck with the
utility of exploration in southern seas, and considered that the
French nation should take the lead in such an endeavour. He spoke
for a full hour in support of this particular suggestion of
Maupertuis, and when he had finished his fellow-members assured
him that what he had advanced was so novel and interesting that
he would do well to expand his ideas into an essay, to be read at
the next meeting. De Brosses did more: for he wrote two solid
quarto volumes, published at Paris in 1756&mdash;"avec
approbation et privilege du Roy," as the title page says&mdash;in
which he related all that he could learn about previous voyages
to the south, and pointed out, with generous amplitude, in
limpid, fluent French, the desirableness of pursuing further
discoveries there. Incidentally he coined a useful word: to
Monsieur le President Charles de Brosses we owe the name
"Australasia."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* De Brosses, Histoire des Navigations aux
Terres Australes 1 426 and 2 367. Max Muller, in his Lectures on
the Origin of Religion page 59, stated that De Brosses coined
three valuable words, "fetishism," "Polynesia," and "Australia."
He certainly did not originate the word Australia, which does not
occur anywhere in his book. Quiros, in 1606, named one of the
islands of the New Hebrides group Austrialia del Espiritu Santo,
though he seems to have done so in compliment to Philip III, who
ruled Austria as well as Spain. See Markham, Voyages of Quiros
volume 1 page 30 Hakluyt Society. "Australasia" was De Brosses'
new name for a broad division of the globe. He derived it from
the Latin australis = southern + Asia.)</p>
<p>A work written over one hundred and fifty years ago,
recommending a project long since completed, can hardly be
expected to be full of living interest. Yet this book of De
Brosses, apart from the research which it evinced, was infused
with a large, humane spirit that lifted it high above the level
of a prospectus. The author had a sense of patriotism that looked
beyond the aggrandisement that might accrue from extensive
acquisitions, to the ideal of spreading French civilisation as a
beneficent force. He wished his country to share in a great work
of discovery that would redound to its glory as well as to its
influence. Glory, he wrote, in a fine piece of French prose, is
the dominant passion of kings; but their common and inveterate
error is to search for it in war&mdash;that is to say, in the
reciprocal misfortunes of their subjects and their neighbours.
But there never is any true glory for them unless the happiness
of nations is the object of their enterprises. In the task which
he recommended, the grandeur of the object was joined to utility.
To augment the lands known to civilised mankind by a new world,
and to enrich the old world with the natural products of the
new&mdash;this would be the effect of the fresh discoveries that
he anticipated. What comparison could there be between such a
project and the conquest&mdash;it might be the unjust
conquest&mdash;of some ravaged piece of territory, of two or
three fortresses battered by cannon and acquired by the massacre,
the ruin, the desolation, and the regrets of the vanquished
people; bought, too, at a price a hundred times greater than
would suffice for the entire voyage of discovery proposed. He
pointed out that the task could only be taken in hand by a
government; it was too large for individuals. But the result was
certain. In truth, to succeed in the complete discovery of the
Terres Australes, it was not necessary to have any other end in
view than success: it was simply necessary to employ proper means
and sufficient forces.</p>
<p>De Brosses discussed the probably most advantageous situation
for settlement in the South Seas, though in doing so he was
hampered by insufficient knowledge. Relying upon the reports of
Tasman, he considered New Zealand and "la terre de
Diemen"&mdash;that is, Tasmania&mdash;too distant and too little
known for an experiment; whilst the narratives of Dampier did not
make those parts of New Holland that he had visited&mdash;the
west and north of Australia&mdash;appear attractive. On the
whole, he favoured the island to the east of Papua-New
Guinea&mdash;known as New Britain (now New Pomerania), and the
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo of the Spanish navigator Quiros as
very suitable. It is interesting to note that the present French
settlements in the New Hebrides embrace the latter island, whilst
their possessions in the New Caledonia group are quite close; so
that ultimately they have planted themselves on the very spot
which a century and a half ago the savant of Dijon considered
best fitted for them. De Brosses admitted that the establishment
of such settlements as he recommended would not be the work of a
day. Great enterprises require great efforts. It is for
individuals to measure years, he loftily said; nations calculate
by centuries. Powerful peoples must take extended views of
things; and kings, as their chiefs, animated by the desire of
glory and the love of country and of humanity, ought to consider
themselves as personalities persisting always, and working for
eternity.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* The passages summarised are to be found in De
Brosses, 1: 4, 8, 11, 19; and 2: 368, 380, 383.)</p>
<p>The elevated tone of De Brosses' book was calculated to make a
telling appeal to the French nation, with their love of eclat and
their ready receptivity. It was made, too, in the age of
Voltaire, when the great man was living at Lausanne; and when,
too, another of equally enduring fame, Edward Gibbon, was, in the
same neighbourhood, polishing those balanced periods in which he
has related the degeneracy of the successors of the Caesars. It
was an age of intellectual ferment. Rousseau was writing his
Contrat Social (1760), the Encyclopedie was leavening Gallic
thought. There was a particular proneness to accept fresh ideas;
a new sense of national consciousness was awakening.</p>
<p>The effect of the President's work was almost immediate. De
Brosses published it in 1756; and in 1766 Louis de Bougainville
sailed from France in command of La Boudeuse and L'Etoile on a
voyage around the world.* A eulogy pronounced on De Brosses
before the Academy of Inscriptions by Dupuy** hardly put the case
too strongly when it was said that before he died he had the
satisfaction to see in Europe men animated by his spirit, who had
gone forth, braving the risks of a long voyage, to make
discoveries; though the prophecy that centuries to come would
doubtless count to his glory the achievements of navigators has
not been verified. The world is perhaps too little inclined to
accord to him who promulgates an idea the praise readily bestowed
upon those who realise it.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See the Voyage du Monde par la frigate du Roi

<p class="foot">(** Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions 42
177.)</p>
<p>Bougainville discovered the Navigator Islands, re-discovered
the Solomon group, and was only just forestalled by the
Englishman, Wallis, in the discovery of Tahiti. He produced a
book of travel which may be read with scarcely less interest than
the wonderful work of his contemporary, Cook.</p>
<p>The voyage of Nicholas Marion-Dufresne (1771) differed from
the other French expeditions of the series in that one of the
ships belonged to the commander, and part of the cost was
sustained by him. He was fired by a passion for exploration,
which led him to propose that he should take out his vessel, Le
Mascurin, in company with a ship of the navy, and that a grant
should be made to him from the public funds. The French
Government acquiesced, and gave him Le Marquis de Castries. He
did some exploring in southern Tasmania, but his career was cut
short in New Zealand, where, in the Bay of Islands, he was killed
and eaten by Maories in 1772.* One of the objects of the voyage
was to take back to Tahiti a native woman, Aontouron, who had
been brought to Paris by Bougainville to be shown at the court of
Louis XV; but she died of smallpox en route.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Rochon, Nouveau Voyage a la Mar du Sud, Paris
1783.)</p>
<p>Again, in 1785, the expedition commanded by the ill-fated La
Perouse sailed from France on a discovery voyage.* The appearance
of his two ships, La Boussole and l'Astrolabe, in Port Jackson
only a fortnight after Governor Phillip had landed in Botany Bay
to establish the first British settlement in Australia, was an
event not less surprising to the governor than to La Perouse, who
had left France before colonisation was intended by the English
Government, though he heard of it in the course of the voyage.
The French navigator remained in the harbour from February 23 to
March 10 (1788), on excellent terms with Phillip; and then,
sailing away to pursue his discoveries, "vanished trackless into
blue immensity, and only some mournful mysterious shadow of him
hovered long in all heads and hearts." His remark to Captain
King, "Mr. Cook has done so much that he has left me nothing to
do but admire his work," indicated the generous candour of his
disposition. His fate after he sailed from Sydney remained a
mystery for forty years, Flinders, on his voyage inside the
Barrier Reef in 1802, kept a lookout for wreckage that might
afford a key to the problem. He wrote: "The French navigator La
Perouse, whose unfortunate situation, if in existence, was always
present to my mind, had been wrecked, as it was thought,
somewhere in the neighbourhood of New Caledonia; and if so the
remnants of his ships were likely to be brought upon this coast
by the trade winds, and might indicate the situation of the reef
or island which had proved so fatal to him. With such an
indication, I was led to believe in the possibility of finding
the place; and though the hope of restoring La Perouse or any of
his companions to their country and friends could not, after so
many years, be rationally entertained, yet to gain some knowledge
of their fate would do away with the pain of suspense, and it
might not be too late to retrieve some documents of their
discoveries.** The vigilance of Flinders to this end indicates
the fascination which the mysterious fate of the French mariner
had for seamen, until doubts were finally set at rest in 1827,
when one of the East India Company's ships, under Captain Dillon,
found at Manicolo, in the New Hebrides, traces of the wreckage of
the vessels of La Perouse. Native tradition enabled the history
of the end of the expedition to be ascertained. The French ships,
on a dark and stormy night, were both driven on the reef, and
soon pounded to match-wood. A few of the sailors got ashore, but
most were drowned; and the bulk of the remainder were lost in an
unsuccessful attempt to make for civilised regions from the coral
isolation of Manicolo. A monument to the memory of the gallant La
Perouse, on the coast a few miles from Sydney, now fronts the
Pacific whose winds wafted him to his doom, and beneath whose
waters he found his grave.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See the Voyage de la Perouse, redige par M.
L.A. Milet-Mureau, volume 1 Paris 1797.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Flinders, Voyage 2 48.)</p>
<p>The next link in the chain was furnished by the expedition
commanded by Bruni Dentrecasteaux, who, while the hurricane of
the Revolution was raging, was despatched (1791) to search for La
Perouse. He made important discoveries on his own account,* both
on the mainland of Australia and in Tasmania; and though he found
no trace of his predecessor, his own name is honourably
remembered among the eminent navigators who did original work in
Australasia. It was Dentrecasteaux's hydrographer, Beautemps
Beaupre, whose charting of part of the southern coast of
Australia was so highly praised by Flinders.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Dentrecasteaux, redige par M. de
Rossel, Paris 1808; Labillardiere, Relation du Voyage a la
Recherche de la Perouse, Paris 1800.)</p>
<p>The expeditions thus enumerated were all despatched before the
era of Napoleon, and appreciation of their objects cannot
therefore be complicated by doubts as to his Machiavellian
designs. Bougainville's voyage, and that of Marion-Dufresne, were
promoted under Louis XV, that of La Perouse under Louis XVI, and
Dentrecasteaux's under the Revolutionary Assembly. Each was an
expedition of discovery.</p>
<p>Next came the expedition commanded by Nicolas Baudin, with
which we are mainly concerned, and which was despatched under the
Consulate. It will presently be demonstrated that it did not
differ in purpose from its predecessors, and that there is
nothing to show that in authorising it Bonaparte had any other
object than that professed. But before pursuing that subject, let
it be made clear that French exploring expeditions to the South
Seas were continued after the final overthrow of the Empire.</p>
<p>In 1817, while Napoleon was mewed up in St. Helena, and a
Bourbon once more occupied the throne of France as Louis XVIII,
the ships Uranie and Physicienne were sent out under the command
of Captain Louis de Freycinet, the cartographer of Baudin's
expedition.* They visited some of the scenes of former French
exploits, and Freycinet took advantage of his position on the
west coast to pull down and appropriate for the French Academy of
Inscriptions the oldest memorial of European presence in
Australia. That is to say, he took the plate put up by the
Dutchman Vlaming in 1697, in place of that erected in 1616 by
Dirk Haticks on the island bearing the name of "Dirk Hartog," to
commemorate his visit in the ship Eendraght of Amsterdam.**
Freycinet had desired to take the plate when he was an officer on
Le Naturaliste in July 1801, but Captain Hamelin, the commander,
would not permit it to be disturbed. On the contrary, he set up a
new post with the plate affixed to it, and expressed the opinion
that to remove an interesting memorial that for over a century
had been spared by nature and by man, would be to commit a kind
of sacrilege.*** Freycinet was not so scrupulous.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage autour du Monde, entrepris par ordre du
Roi, par Louis de Freycinet, Paris 1827.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Ibid 1 449.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** "Il eut pense commettre un sacrilege en
gardant a son bord cette plaque respectee pendant pres de deux
siecles par la nature et par les hommes qui pouvoient avant nous
l'avoir observee." P&eacute;ron, Voyage de Decouvertes 1
195.)</p>
<p>Again, in 1824, the Baron de Bougainville, a son of the older
navigator, and who as a junior officer had sailed with Baudin,
took out the ships Thetis and Esperance on a voyage to the South
Seas, for purely geographical purposes;* and still later, in 1826
to 1828, during the reign of Charles X, Dumont d'Urville, in the
Astrolabe, did valuable exploratory work, especially in the
Western Pacific.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* Journal de la Navigation autour du monde de la
fregate La Thetis et de la corvette L'Esperance, pendant les
annees 1824-1826; publie par ordre du Roi. Par M. le Baron de
Bougainville.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Voyage de la corvette L'Astrolabe, execute
par ordre du Roi, pendant les annees 1826-1829, sous le
commandement de M. J. Dumont D'Urville, Paris 1830.)</p>
<p>The whole of these expeditions, with the partial exception of
that of Marion-Dufresne, were conducted in ships of the French
navy, commanded by French officers, supported by French funds,
and their official records were published at the expense of the
French Government. A certain unity of purpose characterised them;
and that purpose was as purely and truly directed to extend man's
knowledge of the habitable earth as was that of any expedition
that ever sailed under any flag.</p>
<p>To attempt, therefore, to isolate Baudin's expedition from the
series to which it rightly belongs, simply because it was
undertaken while Bonaparte was at the head of the State, is to
convey a false idea of it. If there were any evidence to show
that it differed from the others in its aims, it would be quite
proper to make it stand alone. But there is not.</p>
<p>Nor must it be supposed that this particular enterprise
originated with the First Consul. It was not a scheme generated
in his teeming brain, like the strategy of a campaign, or a
masterstroke of diplomacy. It was placed before him for approval
in the shape of a proposition from the Institute of France, a
scientific body, concerned not with political machinations, but
with the advancement of knowledge. The Institute considered that
there was useful work to be done by a new expedition of
discovery, and believed it to be its duty to submit a plan to the
Government. We are so informed by P&eacute;ron, and there is the
best of reasons for believing him.* The history of the voyage was
published after Napoleon had become Emperor, under his sanction,
at the Imperial Press. If his had been the originating mind, it
is quite certain that credit for the idea would not have been
claimed for others. On the contrary, we should probably have had
an adulatory paragraph from P&eacute;ron's pen about the
beneficence of the Imperial will as exercised in the cause of
science.</p>
<p class="foot">(* "L'honneur national et le progres des sciences
parmi nous se reunissoient donc pour reclamer une expedition de
decouvertes aux Terres Australes, et l'Institut de France crut
devoir la proposer au gouvernement." P&eacute;ron, Voyage de
Decouvertes 1 4.)</p>
<p>Quite apart from P&eacute;ron's statement, however, there are
three official declarations to the like effect. First there is
the announcement in the Moniteur* that it was the Institute which
requested Bonaparte to sanction the expedition. Secondly, when
Vice-Admiral Rosily reported to the Minister of Marine on
Freycinet's charts in 1813,** he commenced by observing that the
expedition "had for its object the completion of the knowledge of
the coasts of New Holland which were not hitherto entirely
known." Thirdly, Henri de Freycinet, writing in 1808,*** said
that it was the high interest stimulated by the voyages of La
Perouse and Dentrecasteaux that made the Institute eagerly
desirous of a new enterprise devoted to the reconnaissance of
Australia. The last two statements were, it will be observed,
published by Napoleon's official organ when the Empire was at its
height.</p>
<p class="foot">(* 23rd Floreal, Revolutionary Year 8;
"L'Institut national a demande au premier consul, et a
obtenu.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Moniteur, January 15, 1813.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Ibid July 2, 1808.)</p>
<p>There is no positive evidence as to what members of the
Institute were chiefly instrumental in formulating the proposal
for Napoleon's consideration. We do not know whether leading
members explained their scheme to him orally, or laid before him
a written statement. If there was a plan in manuscript, the text
of it has never been published.* There is only one document
relating to the expedition in the collected correspondence of
Napoleon;** and that concerned an incident to which reference
will be made in the next chapter. The reason for the absence of
letters concerning the matter among Napoleon's papers is
presumably that he left the carrying out of the project to the
Institute; for he was not wont to restrain his directing hand in
affairs in which he was personally concerned.</p>
<p class="foot">(*"Probably it was suppressed or destroyed," says
Dr. Holland Rose (Life of Napoleon 1 379). But why should it have
been? There is no reason to suppose that it contained anything
which it was to anybody's interest to destroy or suppress.
Indeed, it is by no means clear that there was such a document.
It is quite likely that the scheme of the Institute was explained
verbally to the First Consul. Why manufacture mysteries?)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Edition of 1861.)</p>
<p>But there were two leading members of the Institute who had
already concerned themselves with Australasian discovery, and who
may safely be assumed to have taken the initiative in this
matter. They were Bougainville the explorer, who had commanded
the expedition of 1766 to 1771, and Charles Pierre Claret de
Fleurieu, who had been Minister of Marine in 1790, and had
written a book on the Decouvertes des Francais dans le sud-est de
la Nouvelle Guinee (Paris, 1790), in which he maintained the
prior claims of the French navigators Bougainville and Surville
to discoveries to which later English explorers had in ignorance
given fresh names. Fleurieu had also intended to write the
history of the voyages of La Perouse, but was prevented by
pressure of official and other occupations, and handed the work
over to Milet-Mureau.* He stood high in the esteem of Napoleon,
was a counsellor of State during the Consulate, became
intendant-general of the Emperor's household, governor of the
palace of Versailles, senator, and comte. Both Fleurieu and
Bougainville had abundant opportunities for explaining the
utility of a fresh voyage of exploration to Napoleon.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de la Perouse, Preface 1 page 3.)</p>
<p>It was, too, quite natural that these men should desire to
promote a new French voyage of discovery. None knew better what
might be hoped to be achieved. We are fairly safe in assuming
that they moved the Institute to submit a proposition to the
First Consul; and it is not improbable that they personally
interviewed him on the subject.</p>
<p>Bonaparte, at any rate, received the proposal "with interest,"
and we learn from P&eacute;ron* that he definitely authorised the
expedition at the very time when his army of reserve was about to
move from Geneva to cross the Alps in that astonishing campaign
which conduced, by swift, toilsome, and surprising manoeuvres, to
the crushing victory of Marengo. The plan of the Institute was
therefore ratified in May 1800. The Austrians at that time were
holding French arms severely in check in Savoy and northern
Italy. Suchet, Massena, Oudinot, and Soult were, with fluctuating
fortunes but always with stubborn valour, clinging desperately to
their positions or yielding ground to superior strength, awaiting
with confidence the hour when the supreme master would strike the
shattering blow that, while relieving the pressure on them, would
completely change the aspect of the war. It was while pondering
his masterstroke, and deliberating on the choice of the path
across the Alps that was to lead to it, that Bonaparte gave his
approval; while elaborating a scheme to overwhelm the armies of
Austria in an abyss of carnage, that he expressed the wish that,
as the expedition would come in contact with ignorant savages,
care should be taken to make it appear that the French met them
as "friends and benefactors."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes 1 4.)</p>
<p>It may here be parenthetically remarked that it does not make
us think more favourably of Freycinet that when, in 1824, he
issued a new edition of the Voyage de Decouvertes, he omitted all
P&eacute;ron's references to Napoleon's interest in the
expedition, and his direction that when savages were met the
French should appear among them "comme des amis et des
bienfaiteurs."* While P&eacute;ron tells us that this laudable
wish was personally expressed by the First Consul, Freycinet**
altered the phrase to "le gouvernement voulut," etc. He had
absolutely no justification for doing so. The reader of the
second edition of the book had a right to expect that he was in
possession of the original text, save for the correction of
incidental errors. But in 1824 Napoleon was dead, a Bourbon
reigned in France, and Freycinet was the servant of the monarchy
to which he owed the command of the expedition of 1817. The
suppression of Napoleon's name and the record of his actions from
P&eacute;ron's text, was a puerile piece of servility.</p>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron, 1 10.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** 1 74, in the 1824 edition.)</p>
<p>There is nothing surprising in Bonaparte's cordial approval of
the enterprise. One has only to study the volumes in which M.
Frederic Masson has collected the papers and memoranda relating
to Napoleon's youth and early manhood to realise how intensely
keen was his interest in geography and travel. In one of those
interesting works is a document occupying eight printed pages, in
which Napoleon had summarised a geographical textbook, with a
view to the more perfect mastery of its contents.* It is curious
to note how little the young scholar was able to ascertain about
Australasia from the volume from which he learnt the elements of
that science for which, with his genius for strategy and tactics,
he must have had an instinctive taste. "La Nouvelle Guinee, la
Carpentarie, la Nouvelle Hollande," etc., figure in his notes as
the countries forming the principal part of the southern
hemisphere now grouped under the denomination of Australasia; "la
Carpentarie" thus signalised as a separated land being simply the
northern region of Australia proper, the farthest limit of which
is Cape York.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Masson's Napoleon Inconnu; Papiers
Inedits; Paris 1895 volume 2 page 44. The text-book was that of
Lacroix.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Mallet's Description de l'Univers (Frankfort
1686) mentions "Carpenterie" as being near the "Terre des
Papous," and as discovered by the Dutch captain, Carpenter.)</p>
<p>It is not a little interesting, that when, in April 1800,
twenty sculptors were commissioned to execute as many busts of
great men to adorn the Galerie des Consuls, the only Englishmen
among the honoured score were Marlborough and Dampier.* It is
curious to find the adventurous ex-buccaneer in such noble
company as that of Cicero, Cato, Caesar, Demosthenes, Frederick
the Great, and George Washington, but the fact that he was among
the selected heroes may be taken as another evidence of
Bonaparte's interest in the men who helped to find out what the
world was like. Perhaps if somebody had seen him reading
Dampier's Voyages, as he read Cook's on the way to Egypt, that
fact would have been instanced as another proof, not of his
fondness for extremely fascinating literature, but of the
nourishment of a secret passion to seize the coasts which Dampier
explored.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Aulard, Paris sous le Consulat 1 267.)</p>
<p>Napoleon had been a good and a diligent student. The
fascinating but hateful characteristics of his later career, when
he was the Emperor with a heart petrified and corroded by
ambition, the conqueror ever greedy of fresh conquest, the
scourge of nations and the tyrant of kings, too often make one
overlook the liberal instincts of his earlier years. His passion
for knowledge was profound, and he was the pronounced friend of
every genuine man of science, of every movement having for its
object the acquisition and diffusion of fresh enlightenment. It
is an English writer* who says of him that he was, "amongst the
great heroes and statesmen of his age, the first and foremost if
not the only one, who seemed thoroughly to realise the part which
science was destined to play in the immediate future"; and the
same author adds that "some of the glory of Laplace and Cuvier
falls upon Napoleon." He took pleasure in the company and
conversation of men of science; and never more so than during the
period of the Consulate. Thibaudeau's memoirs show him dining one
night with Laplace, Monge, and Berthollet; and the English
translator of that delightful book** emphasises the contrast
between the "just and noble sanity of the First Consul of 1802
and the delirium of the Emperor of 1812." The failure to keep
that difference in mind&mdash;to recognise that the Bonaparte of
the early Consulate was capable of exalted ideals for the general
well-being that were foreign to the Napoleon of ten years
later&mdash;is fruitful of mistakes in interpreting his
activities. On April 8 he attended a seance of the Institute, and
was there instrumental in reconciling several persons who had
become estranged through events which occurred during the
Revolution.*** He was therefore on good terms with this learned
body, and was himself a member of that division of it which was
devoted to the physical and mathematical sciences.****</p>
<p class="foot">(* Merz, History of European Thought in the
Nineteenth Century 1 152 to 154.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Dr. Fortescue, page 273. Compare also Lord
Rosebery, Napoleon, the Last Phase page 234: "In the first period
of his Consulate he was an almost ideal ruler. He was firm,
sagacious, far-seeing, energetic, just.")</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Aulard, Paris sous le Consulat, 1 252.)</p>
<p class="foot">(**** Thibaudeau (English edition) page 112.)</p>
<p>It was quite natural, then, that when the national
representatives of scientific thought in France approached him
with a proposition that was calculated to make his era
illustrious by a grand voyage of exploration which should
complete man's knowledge of the great continents, the First
Consul gave a ready consent.</p>
<p>The task of preparing instructions for the voyage was
entrusted to a Committee of the Institute, consisting of
Fleurieu, Bougainville, Laplace, Lacepede, Cuvier, Jussieu,
Lelievre, Langles, and Camus; whilst Degerando wrote a special
memorandum upon the methods to be followed in the observation of
savage peoples&mdash;the latter probably in consequence of the
First Consul's particular direction on this subject. It was an
admirably chosen body for formulating a programme of scientific
research. A great astronomer, two eminent biologists, a famous
botanist, a practical navigator, a geographer, all men of
distinction among European savants, and two of them, Laplace and
Cuvier, among the greatest men of science of modern times, were
scholars who knew what might be expected to be gained for
knowledge, and where and how the most fruitful results might be
obtained.</p>
<p>In their instructions, the committee directed attention to the
south coast of Tasmania&mdash;by that time known to be an island,
since the discoveries of Bass and Flinders, and their
circumnavigation, had been the subject of much comment in
Europe&mdash;as offering a good field for geographical research.
They indicated the advisableness of exploring the eastern coast
of the island, of traversing Bass Strait with a view to a more
complete examination than appeared to the Institute to have been
made up to that time, and of pursuing the southern coasts of
Australia as far as the western point of Dentrecasteaux's
investigations, especially with the object of searching that part
of the land "where there is supposed to be a strait communicating
with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and which, consequently, would
divide New Holland into two large and almost equal islands." So
much accomplished, the expedition was to pay particular attention
to the coasts westward of the Swan River, since the old
navigators who had determined their contour had necessarily had
to work with imperfect instruments. The vessels were then to make
a fuller exploration of the western and northern shores than had
hitherto been achieved, to attack the south-west of Papua (New
Guinea), and to investigate the Gulf of Carpentaria. No
instructions seem to have been given relative to a further
examination of the eastern coasts of the continent. Cook's work
there was evidently thought to be sufficient, though Flinders
found several fresh and important harbours. The programme, as
P&eacute;ron pointed out, involved the exploration in detail of
several thousands of miles of coasts hitherto quite unknown or
imperfectly known, and its proper performance was calculated to
accomplish highly important work in perfecting a knowledge of the
geography of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>The French Government fitted out the expedition in a lavish
and elaborate fashion.* Funds were not stinted, and the commander
was given unlimited credit to obtain anything that he required at
any port of call. The best scientific instruments were procured,
and the stores of the great naval depot of Havre were thrown open
for the equipment of the ships with every necessity and comfort
for a long voyage. Luxuries were not spared; "in a word," says
P&eacute;ron, "the Government had ordered that nothing whatever
should be omitted that could assure the preservation of health,
promote the work of the staff, and guarantee the independence of
the expedition."</p>
<p class="foot">(* "Les savans ont vu avec le plus grand interet
les soins que le gouvernement a pris pour rendre ce voyage utile
a l'histoire naturelle et a la connaissance des moeurs des
sauvages." Moniteur, 22nd Fructidor.)</p>
<p>Two vessels lying in the port of Havre were selected. The
principal one, which was named Le Geographe, was a corvette of 30
guns, 450 tons, drawing fifteen or sixteen feet of water, a fast
sailer, but, in P&eacute;ron's opinion, not so good a boat for
the purpose as her consort. Flinders described her as a
"heavy-looking ship." The second vessel, named Le Naturaliste,
was a strong, lumbering store-ship, very slow, but solid. She was
a "grosse gabare," as one French writer described her.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Dr. Holland Rose (Revolutionary and Napoleonic
Era page 139) heightens the effect of his argument by stating
that Bonaparte "sent out men-of-war to survey the south coast of
Australia for a settlement." It may be true that, strictly
speaking, the ships were "men-of-war," inasmuch as they were
ships of the navy. But the reader would hardly derive the
impression, from the words quoted, that they were vessels utterly
unwarlike in equipment, manning, and command. As will presently
be seen, they were very soon loaded up with scientific specimens.
Nor is there any warrant for the statement that the expedition
was instructed to "survey the south coast of Australia for a
settlement." There was nothing about settlement in the
instructions, which were not, as the passage would lead the
reader to infer, confined to the south coast.)</p>
<p>The staff was selected with great care, special examinations
being prescribed for the younger naval officers. A large company
of artists, men of science, and gardeners accompanied the
expedition for the collection of specimens, the making of charts
and drawings, and the systematic observation of phenomena. There
were two astronomers, two hydrographers, three botanists, five
zoologists, two mineralogists, five artists, and five gardeners.
Probably no exploring expedition to the South Seas before this
time had set out with such a large equipment of selected,
talented men for scientific and artistic work. The whole
staff&mdash;nautical, scientific, and artistic&mdash;on the two
ships consisted of sixty-one persons, of whom only twenty-nine
returned to France after sharing the fatigues and distress of the
whole voyage. Seven died, twenty had to be put ashore on account
of serious illness, and five left the expedition for other
causes.</p>
<p>The great German traveller and savant, Alexander von Humboldt,
was in Paris while preparations were being made for the despatch
of the expedition; and, being at that time desirous of pursuing
scientific investigations in distant regions, he obtained
permission to embark, with the instruments he had collected, in
one of Baudin's vessels. He confessed, however, that he had "but
little confidence in the personal character of Captain Baudin,"
chiefly on account of the dissatisfaction he had given to the
Court of Vienna in regard to a previous voyage.* Humboldt's
testimony is interesting, inasmuch as, if it be
reliable&mdash;and, as he was in close touch with leading French
men of science, there is no reason to disbelieve him&mdash;the
original intention was to make the voyage more extensive in
scope, and different in the route followed, than was afterwards
determined. "The first plan," he wrote, "was great, bold, and
worthy of being executed by a more enlightened commander. The
purpose of the expedition was to visit the Spanish possessions of
South America, from the mouth of the River Plata to the kingdom
of Quito and the isthmus of Panama. After traversing the
archipelago of the great ocean, and exploring the coasts of New
Holland from Van Diemen's Land to that of Nuyts, both vessels
were to stop at Madagascar, and return by the Cape of Good Hope."
Concerning the reasons why he was not ultimately taken, Humboldt
was not accurately informed. "The war which broke out in Germany
and Italy," he wrote, "determined the French Government to
withdraw the funds granted for their voyage of discovery, and
adjourn it to an indefinite period." Such was not the case. The
funds were not withdrawn; the expedition was not adjourned. But
Humboldt was a German, and the Institute very naturally desired
that French savants should do the work which was to be sustained
by French funds. There would probably be the less inclination to
employ Humboldt, as he reserved to himself "the liberty of
leaving Captain Baudin whenever I thought proper." He believed
himself to be "cruelly deceived in my hopes, seeing the plans
which I had been forming during many years of my life overthrown
in a single day." But in view of his confessed dislike of the
commander, it does not seem that, on this ground alone, it would
have been good policy to enrol him as a member of the staff, when
there were French men of science eager for appointment.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Humboldt's Personal Narrative of Travels,
translated by H.M. Williams, London 1814 volume 1 pages 6 to
8.)</p>
<p>The chief naturalist and future historian of the expedition,
Francois P&eacute;ron, was twenty-five years of age when he was
commissioned to join Le Geographe. Born at Cerilly (Allier) in
1775, he was left fatherless at an early age; but he was a
bright, promising scholar, and the cure of his native place took
him into his house with the object of educating him for the
priesthood. But "seduced by the principles of liberty which
served as pretext for the Revolution, inflamed by patriotism, his
spirit exalted by his reading of ancient history," as a
biographer, Deleuze, wrote, he left the peaceful home of the
village priest, and shouldered a musket under the tricolour. He
fought in the army of the Rhine, and in an engagement against the
Prussians at Kaiserslautern, was wounded and taken prisoner.
Always a student, he spent the little money that he had on the
purchase of books, which he devoted all his time to reading. He
was exchanged in 1794, and returned to France.</p>
<p>His short soldiering career had cost him his right eye; but
this deprivation really determined the vocation for which his
genius especially fitted him. The Minister of the Interior gave
him admission to the school of medicine at Paris, where, in
addition to pursuing the prescribed course, he applied himself
with enthusiasm to the study of biology* and comparative anatomy
at the Museum. He was industrious, keen, methodical, and, above
all, possessed of that valuable quality of imagination which,
discreetly harnessed to the use of the scientific intellect,
enables a student to see through his facts, and to read their
vital meaning. The expedition to the South Seas had already been
fitted out, and Baudin's ships were lying at Havre awaiting
sailing orders from the Minister of Marine, when P&eacute;ron
sought employment as an additional biologist. The staff was by
that time complete; but P&eacute;ron addressed himself to
Jussieu, pressing his request with such ardour, and explaining
his well-considered plans with such clearness, that the eminent
botanist was unable to listen to him "sans etonnement et sans
emotion."</p>
<p class="foot">(* The word "biology" was not used till Lamarck
employed it in 1801 to cover all the sciences concerned with
living matter; but we are so accustomed to it nowadays, that it
is the most convenient word to use to describe the group of
studies to which P&eacute;ron applied himself.)</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron was very anxious to travel, not only for the sake
of the scientific work which he might do, but also to find relief
for his feelings, depressed by the disappointment of a love
affair. Mademoiselle was unkind&mdash;because the lover was poor,
his biographer says; but we must not forget that he was also
one-eyed. Many ladies prefer a man with two.</p>
<p>Jussieu conferred with Lacepede the biologist, and the two
agreed that it would be advantageous to permit this enthusiastic
young student to make the voyage. P&eacute;ron was encouraged to
write a paper to be read before the Institute, expounding his
views. He did so, taking as his principal theme the desirableness
of having with the expedition a naturalist especially charged
with researches in anthropology. The Institute was convinced; the
Minister of Marine was moved; P&eacute;ron was appointed. He
consulted with Cuvier, Lacepede, and Degerando as to a programme
of work, procured the necessary apparatus, went to Cerilly to
embrace his sisters and receive his mother's benediction, and
joined Le Geographe just before she sailed.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* The facts concerning P&eacute;ron's early
career are taken from Deleuze's memoir, 1811, and that of Maurice
Girard, 1857.)</p>
<p>The command of the expedition was entrusted to Captain Nicolas
Baudin. He was fifty years of age when he received this
commission, on the nomination of the Institute. In his youth he
had been engaged in the French mercantile marine. In later years
he had commanded two expeditions, despatched under the Austrian
flag, for botanical purposes. From the last of these he returned
in 1797, when, his country being at war with Austria, he
presented the complete collection of animals and plants obtained
to the French nation.* This timely act won him the friendship of
Jussieu, and it was largely through his influence that "Citoyen"
Baudin was chosen to command the expedition to the Terres
Australes.** He had had no training in the Navy, though if, as
some suppose, the expedition had a secret aggressive mission, we
may reasonably conjecture that it would have been placed under
the command of a naval officer with some amount of fighting
experience.</p>
<p class="foot">(* The Moniteur, 25th Prairial (June 13),
1797.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** The Moniteur, 23rd Floreal (May 13),
1800.)</p>
<p>That Baudin did not become popular with the staff under his
command is apparent from the studious omission of his name from
the volumes of P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, and from their
resentful references to "notre chef." They wrote not a single
commendatory word about him throughout the book, and they
expressed no syllable of regret when he died in the course of the
voyage.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may judge of a man's reputation among his
contemporaries by an anecdote, even when we doubt its truth; for
men do not usually tell stories that disparage the capacity of
those whom they respect. An amusing if venomous story about
Baudin was told by the author of a narrative of one of the
botanical voyages.* He related, on the alleged authority of an
officer, that, being in want of a magnetic needle to replace one
belonging to a compass which had been injured, he applied to the
commodore, who had several in a drawer in his cabin. Baudin found
one, but as it was somewhat rusty, the officer feared that the
magnetic properties of the steel would be impaired. Baudin
expressed his regret, and said: "Everything has been furnished by
the Government in the most niggardly fashion; if they had
followed my advice we should have been provided with silver
needles instead of steel ones!"</p>
<p class="foot">(* See the Naval Chronicle volume 14 page 103.
The writer referred to was Bory de Saint-Vincent, who wrote the
Voyage dans les quatre principales iles des mers d'Afrique, Paris
1804.)</p>
<p>Whether or not we believe that a naval commander could be so
ignorant of magnetism, it is certain that Baudin did not enforce
the laws of health on his ships. Sufficient has been said in the
first chapter to show so much. The Consular Government gave
unlimited scope for the proper provisioning of the vessels, and
yet we find officers and men in a wretched condition, the water
insufficient, and the food supplies in utter decay, before the
expedition reached Port Jackson. It must be added,
however&mdash;even out of its proper place, lest an unduly harsh
impression of Baudin's character should be conveyed&mdash;that he
seems to have made an excellent impression upon the English in
Sydney. Governor King treated him as a friend; and the letter of
farewell that he wrote on his departure was such a delicate
specimen of grace and courtesy, that one would feel that only a
gentleman could have written it, were there not too many
instances to show that elegant manners and language towards
strangers are not incompatible with the rough and inconsiderate
treatment of subordinates.</p>

<p>England and France were at war when, in June 1800, application
was made to the British Admiralty for passports for the French
discovery ships. Earlier in that year the Government of the
Republic sent to London Louis Guillaume Otto, a diplomatist of
experience and tried discretion, to arrange for the exchange of
prisoners of war; and it was Otto, whose tact and probity won him
the esteem of King George's advisers, who conducted the
preliminary negotiations which led up to the Treaty of Amiens.
Earl Spencer was First Lord of the Admiralty&mdash;in Pitt's
administration (1783 to 1801)&mdash;when the application was
made.</p>
<p>The Quarterly Review of August 1810 (volume 4 page 42) fell
into a singular error in blaming Addington's administration for
the issue of the passports. Pitt's ministry did not fall till
March 1801; and the censure which the reviewer levelled at the
"good-natured minister," Earl St. Vincent, who was Addington's
First Lord of the Admiralty, for entertaining the French
application, was therefore undeserved by him. "A few months after
the retirement of Mr. Pitt from office and the succession of Mr.
Addington, that is to say, in June 1800," are the opening words
of the Quarterly article&mdash;an extraordinary blunder for a
contemporary to make. The Quarterly was, of course, bitterly
adverse to Addington's administration, in politics; but though
party bias is responsible for strange behaviour, we shall be safe
in attributing to lapse of memory this censure of a minister for
the act of his predecessor. St. Vincent was in active service, as
Admiral in command of the Channel Fleet, when the passports were
issued.</p>
<p>It cannot be assumed that Spencer would have complied with
such a request from a nation with which his country was at war,
had he not been satisfied that the expedition was what it
professed to be, one for discovery and scientific research. The
passports granted guaranteed to Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste
protection from hostile attack from British ships, and bespoke
for them a favourable reception in any British port out of Europe
where they might have to seek shelter.</p>
<p>The Admiralty was in later years severely blamed for
compliance. Circumstances that have been narrated in previous
pages generated the suspicion that the real purpose of the
expedition was "to ascertain the real state of New Holland, to
discover what our colonists were doing, and what was left for the
French to do, on this great continent in the event of a peace, to
find some port in the neighbourhood of our settlements which
should be to them what Pondicherry was to Hindustan, to rear the
standard of Bonaparte on the first convenient spot."* The fact
that this sweeping condemnation was made in a powerful organ of
opinion bitterly hostile to the administration which it meant to
attack, would minimise its importance for us, a century later,
were it not that more recent writers have adopted the same
assumption. To accept it, we have not merely to disregard the
total absence of evidence, but to believe that Spencer was
befooled and that Otto deceived him. The application was, it was
urged, "grounded on false pretences," and the passports were
"fraudulently obtained." It would have been a piece of audacity
of quite superb coolness for the French diplomatist to ask for
British protection for ships on ostensible grounds of research,
had their secret purpose been exactly opposite to the profession;
and the British Minister would have been guilty of grave
dereliction of duty had he not assured himself that Otto's
representations were reliable.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Quarterly Review 4 43. There can be no doubt
that this Quarterly article had a great influence in formulating
the idea which has been current for nearly a century regarding
Napoleon's deep designs. Paterson's History of New South Wales
(1811) repeated portions of the article almost verbally, but
without quotation marks (see Preface page 5), and many later
writers have fed upon its leading themes, without submitting them
to examination.)</p>
<p>The letter of instructions furnished by the Duke of Portland,
Secretary of State in Pitt's administration, to Grant, the
commander of the Lady Nelson, in February 1800, may be quoted as
laying down the principle observed by Great Britain in regard to
an enemy's ships commissioned purely for discovery. "As vessels
fitted out for this purpose," wrote the Duke, "have always been
respected by the nations of Europe, notwithstanding actual
hostilities may at the time have existed between them, and as
this country has always manifested the greatest attention to
other nations on similar occasions, as you will observe by the
letters written in favour of vessels employed in discovery by
France and Spain, copies of which you receive enclosed, I have no
apprehension whatever of your suffering any hindrance or
molestation from the ships of other nations should you fall in
with them...You are also, on pain of His Majesty's utmost
displeasure, to refrain on your part from making prizes, or from
detaining or molesting the ships of any other nation, although
they may be at war with His Majesty."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Historical Records of New South Wales 4
57.)</p>
<p>It was on this enlightened principle that the British
Government furnished passports to Baudin's ships; but the
Admiralty also took steps to prevent the laurels of important
discovery being won by foreign efforts. Flinders returned home in
the Reliance in August, vigorous, eager for fresh work, and
already, notwithstanding his youth, honourably regarded by naval
men as an intrepid and skilful navigator. Lord Spencer, the head
of a family eminently distinguished for the great administrators
whom it has furnished for the furtherance of British polity, did
a far wiser thing than attempting to block French researches,
from suspicion, jealousy, or fear of consequences. He entertained
the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks, ordered the fitting out of
the Investigator, and placed her under the command of the one man
in the Navy who knew what discovery work there was to do, and how
to accomplish it speedily. Pitt's consummate judgment in the
selection of men for crucial work has often been eulogised, and
never too warmly; but one can hardly over-praise the sagacity of
Pitt's colleague at the Admiralty, who especially commended
Nelson as the officer to checkmate Bonaparte in the Mediterranean
in 1798,* and, on the more pacific side of naval activity,
commissioned Matthew Flinders to complete the discovery of
Australia in 1800.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Mahan's Life of Nelson (1899 edition) page
275.)</p>
<p>Baudin's expedition was ready to sail from Havre at the end of
September, but was delayed by contrary winds. The delay was
considered by a friendly contemporary to be fortunate, in that it
enabled the officers and scientific staff to become friendly, so
that the most perfect harmony existed amongst them.* French
readers of the official organ of the Government were also assured
that everybody on the two ships had merited confidence in the
talent of the chiefs; in which case their disappointment with
later developments must have been all the more profound. The
public and the journals took a lively interest in the enterprise;
and the author of one of the world's great stories, Bernardin de
Saint Pierre, from his experience of tropical life in the island
where Paul and Virginia lived and loved, lectured at the
Institute on the dietetic regime which ought to be observed by
Captain Baudin and his men.** But however valuable his advice may
have been, it was sadly disregarded.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 29th Vendemiaire, Revolutionary Year
8 (1800).)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Moniteur, 16th Vendemiaire.)</p>
<p>A livelier function was a banquet given to Baudin at the Hotel
de la Rochefoucauld, in Paris, on the 7th Fructidor, by the
Societe de l'Afrique Interieure. It was attended by several
leading members of the Institute, and an account of it was
accorded over a column of space in the Moniteur.* Baudin was
seated between Bougainville and Vaillant, an African traveller.
There was music, and song, and a long toast list, with many
eloquent speeches. Baudin submitted the toast of Bonaparte,
"First Consul of the French Republic and protector of the
expedition"; Jussieu proposed the progress of the sciences; the
company drank to the "amelioration of the lot of savage races,
and may their civilisation result from the visit which the French
are about to pay to them"; and the immortal memory of La Perouse
was honoured in silence. The last toast appropriately expressed
the wish that the whole company might reassemble in the same
place on the return of the expedition, "inspired by the purest
zeal for the progress of the sciences and of enlightenment." A
short poem was also recited, which it is worth while to rescue
from the inaccessibility of the Moniteur file:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Vous quittez aujourd'hui la France<br>
Mais vous emportez tous nos voeux,<br>
Et deja vos succes heureux<br>
Partout sont applaudis d'avance.</p>
<p>Sur le coeur de tous les mortels<br>
Votre gloire a jamais se fonde,<br>
Il n'est pas de pays au monde<br>
Ou le savoir n'ait des autels."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="foot">(* 22nd Fructidor.)</p>
<p>The poet who thus applauded success in advance, probably lived
long enough to realise that it is much easier to make fair verses
than a true prediction.</p>
<p>There was another banquet at Havre while the ships were
awaiting a fair wind, when again high hopes were expressed
concerning the results to be achieved by the expedition, and
where one of the toasts was proposed by a Chinese, Ah Sam, who
had been found on board a captured English frigate, and was, by
Bonaparte's orders, being taken by Baudin to Mauritius, whence he
was to be shipped to his own country. Ah Sam's toast descended
from ethereal altitudes and took a purely personal view of the
situation. He drank "Aux Francais, bons amis d'A Sam."* The
Chinaman had reason to be grateful, for the First Consul had, by
an order over his own signature, directed that he should be
placed under Baudin's charge, and conveyed to his own country at
the expense of the Government, and that there should be shown to
him that consideration which he merited, both because he was a
stranger and because of his good conduct while residing within
the territories of the Republic.** The treatment of Ah Sam was an
example of that kindness which Napoleon, ruthless in war, so
often displayed towards those who touched his sympathies.***</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 21st Vendemiaire.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Correspondence of Napoleon, 1861 collection
Volume 6, letter dated 7th Vendemiaire, Revolutionary Year 9
(September 29, 1800).)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** P&eacute;ron mentioned Ah Sam's case (1 11),
but Freycinet, in his second edition, cut out the paragraph, in
pursuance of his policy of suppressing references to Napoleon;
P&eacute;ron having written that the Chinaman had reason to bless
the generosity and goodness of the First Consul. It was not
politic in 1824 to talk about Napoleon's generosity and goodness.
But how paltry was the spirit thus displayed!)</p>
<p>The expedition sailed from Havre on the morning of October 19,
1800, amidst cordial popular demonstrations from the inhabitants
of that bustling seaport, and many wishes that fortune might
crown the efforts of the explorers with success. The captain of
the English frigate Proselite, which was watching the harbour
mouth, scrutinised the passports and permitted the ships to pass;
and, with a fair wind to fill his sails, Baudin put out into the
Channel and steered for the open ocean, bound due south.</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron, in his history of the voyage, severely blamed
the obstinacy of "notre chef"&mdash;mention of his name being
carefully avoided&mdash;for the delay occasioned on the run down
to the Cape of Good Hope. Captain Baudin, disregarding the advice
of his officers, insisted on sailing fairly close to the African
coast, instead of making a more westerly course. He argued,
according to P&eacute;ron, that the route which he favoured was
nearer, and as a matter of mileage he was right. But winds and
currents should have been considered rather than bare distance;
and the simple result of bad seamanship was that Baudin's vessels
occupied one hundred and forty-five days on the voyage from Havre
to Mauritius, where they stayed to refit, whilst Flinders brought
out the Investigator from Spithead the whole way to Cape Leeuwin,
where he first made the Australian coast, in one hundred and
forty-two days. The French vessels lay at Mauritius for the
leisurely space of forty days, and did not reach Australia till
May 27, two hundred and twenty days after their departure from
France.</p>
<p>Even then, had reasonable diligence been exercised in the
pursuit of the exploratory work for which his ships had been
commissioned, Baudin would have had the honour of discovering the
unknown southern coast; for Flinders was not allowed to leave
England till July 17, 1801, fifty-one days after the French
actually arrived on the shores of Australia. The prize of
discovery slipped from Baudin's reach in consequence of his
"dawdling" methods, which brought about those "consequences
facheuses et irreparables" deplored by the naturalist.</p>
<p>Soon after the expedition left Mauritius, the officers and
crew were surprised to learn that the supplies of bread were
short "and that for the future ships' biscuit and salt meat would
constitute the principal part of the diet. The wine brought from
France had also been nearly consumed. Instead of the latter, a
cheap, unwholesome drink, tafia, bought at the island, was to be
served out. This was amazing and depressing news, considering the
lavishness with which the Government had fitted out the ships,
and that nearly six weeks had been spent at a French colonial
possession. By this time, too, as is clear from P&eacute;ron's
narrative, very little affection for the commander remained. The
delays already permitted had brought the expedition in face of
the prospect of exploring the southern coasts of New Holland in
the winter season. Baudin considered it unwise to undertake the
work in Tasmanian seas, according to the programme prepared for
him, during months when severe storms would probably be
encountered; and he consequently determined not to sail farther
south on making Cape Leeuwin, but to explore the western coasts
of the continent, reserving the work which the Institute had put
first to be done in the following spring. P&eacute;ron blamed him
for this decision, inasmuch as the course prescribed in the
instructions was the result of careful thought and extensive
research. But though the procrastination which had let slip the
months best suited for exploration in southern waters was caused
by Baudin's own lack of energy and knowledge, his resolve not to
entrust his ships on an unknown coast, where he knew of no secure
harbours, in the months of tempest and cold, was prudent.</p>
<p>On making the Leeuwin, therefore, Baudin steered north.
Geography Bay and Cape Naturaliste, upon current maps, mark the
commencement of his work on the shores of Western Australia. From
Sharks Bay the vessels pursued the course of the first Englishman
to explore any portion of the Australian coast, the resolute,
observant, tough old salt, William Dampier. The biographical
dictionary was here for the first time brought forth, and the
names within it were scattered liberally over the lands
traversed. Some of them have adhered, though Baudin's voyage
along these shores was by no means one of discovery, and there is
clear evidence that names were applied to parts which his ships
did not investigate with any approach to care. The Golfe Joseph
Bonaparte of the large French chart, if traced with some degree
of particularity, would have led to several highly important
discoveries. But it was not carefully investigated at all, and
thus Baudin totally missed Bathurst Island and Melville Island,
which together stretch for over one hundred miles across the
entrance to Van Diemen's Gulf. Instead of definiteness of
outline, the French charts presented the world with a bristling
array of names affixed to contours which were cloudy and
ill-defined, incomplete and inaccurate.</p>
<p>The most serious omission of all was the superb natural
harbour of Port Darwin, the finest anchorage in northern
Australia. The French missed it altogether. Yet here also they
peppered their chart of the neighbouring coasts with the names of
their notable countrymen, as though they had explored the
environs meticulously. Baudin certainly lost a fine opportunity
of doing good original work in north-western Australia; and had
his real object been to find a suitable site for French
settlement, his research would have been amply rewarded had he
found the port which now bears the noble name of the greatest
modern man of science. There is, however, one French name which
should not escape mention, since it serves to remind us that
P&eacute;ron was writing his book at the time when, amidst the
smoke and flame and thunder of Trafalgar, two fleets locked in
fierce conflict were deciding momentous issues. Off the very
broken coast of what is now the Kimberley division of Western
Australia, the French styled a small cluster of rocky islets the
Isles d'Arcole; and one of these was named Ile Lucas, "in honour
of the captain of the vessel which, in the combat of the
Redoutable against the Victory, has lately attained so much
honour."* The English reader will scarcely need to be reminded
that it was by a shot from the mizzen top of the Redoutable in
that immortal fight that Nelson received his death wound; and
thus, by giving his name to a desolate rock, was it sought to
honour the captain of the ship that had accounted for the death
of a nation's hero. The French charting was so inferior that it
is scarcely possible to identify the Ile Lucas, which is not
marked at all on the large Carte Generale, probably because that
was finished before Trafalgar was fought; though the passage in
P&eacute;ron's book is somewhat valuable as showing that the
pepper-box sprinkling of names along coasts explored with less
sufficiency than pretentiousness was not entirely Baudin's work.
The commander of the expedition died before Trafalgar was fought,
so that, as on other grounds we have reason to infer, he was less
responsible for the nomenclature than Freycinet made it appear
when that feature of the work became somewhat discreditable.</p>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron, Voyage de Decouvertes 1
136.)</p>
<p>Scurvy broke out on Le Geographe while the voyage along the
western and north-western coasts was in progress. Water, too, was
becoming scarce, and there seemed to be little opportunity of
replenishing the supply on these barren shores. The ship had
likewise become separated from her consort, Le Naturaliste,
"owing to the false calculations of the chief charged with
directing their common movements," as averred by Freycinet.
Baudin decided to sail to the Dutch possession at Timor, where he
might be able to re-victual, take in fresh water, and enable his
crew to recover from their disease, which was fast reducing them
to helplessness. He therefore discontinued the further
exploration of the north-west coast, and, on August 18, entered
Kupang.</p>
<p>There Le Naturaliste also appeared rather more than a month
later, and the two ships remained in the Dutch port till November
13, Baudin's vessel having thus been at anchor fifty-six days.
There was no hurrying.</p>
<p>In the month of October an English frigate, the Virginia,
suddenly made her appearance in the offing, with her decks
cleared for action. Her captain had heard of two French vessels
being at Kupang, and, supposing them to be lawful prize of war,
he had clapped on all sail and descended on the quiet little port
with the joyful anticipation of finding brisk business to do. But
when he was informed that the two were exploring ships, and had
examined their passports, the English commander gallantly
expressed "his especial esteem and consideration for the object
of our voyage"; and, hearing that Captain Baudin was ill, even
offered a present of excellent wine. It was a shining, graceful
little incident, pleasant to read about in a story in which there
is a surfeit of discontent, disease, and bad feeling. The
frigate, having satisfied herself that there was no fighting to
enjoy, made off without firing a shot.</p>
<p>After the long sojourn at Timor, it might have been expected
that when the expedition sailed for the south of Tasmania, the
ships would be in a clean and wholesome condition, the crews and
staff in good health, and the supplies of food and water
abundant. But distressing fortunes followed in Baudin's wake at
every stage of the voyage. Leaving Kupang on November 13, the
vessels were only six days' sail from that port when
insufficiency of water led to revolting practices, described by
P&eacute;ron. "We were so oppressed by the heat," he says, "and
our ration of water was so meagre, that unhappy sailors were seen
drinking their urine. All the representations of the ship's
doctor with a view of increasing for the time being the quantity
of water supplied, and diminishing the ration when cooler
latitudes were reached, were useless."* It is not wonderful that
scurvy broke out again with increased virulence.</p>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron, 1824 edition 2 7.)</p>
<p>It is more pleasant to turn to the somewhat prolonged stay
made in southern Tasmania. At this time, it should be
recollected, there was no European settlement on the beautiful
and fertile island which then bore the name of the old Dutch
governor of Java, Anthony Van Diemen. Indeed, it was only so
recently as 1798 that Flinders and Bass, in the Norfolk, had
demonstrated that it really was an island, by sailing round it.
On previous charts, principally founded on that of Cook&mdash;the
map attached to the history of Bougainville's voyage (1771) is
particularly interesting&mdash;it had been represented as a long
projection from the mainland, shaped like a pig's snout. Not only
Abel Tasman, the discoverer (1642), but the French explorers,
Marion-Dufresne (1772) and Dentrecasteaux (1791), and the English
navigators, Cook, Furneaux, Cox, and Bligh, had visited it.* But
as yet the European had merely landed for fresh water, or had
explored the south coast very slightly as a matter of curiosity,
and the aboriginal race was still in unchallenged possession. Had
Baudin been furnished with instructions to look for a place for
French settlement, very little diligence and perspicacity would
have enabled him to fix upon a spot suitable to the point of
perfection before the English at Port Jackson knew of his
whereabouts in these seas at all. He might have planted the
tricolour under the shadow of Mount Wellington, on the site of
Hobart, and furnished it from his ships with the requisites for
endurance till he could speed to the Isle of France and bring out
the means of establishing a stable settlement. But though the
geographical work done in this region was important and of good
quality&mdash;Freycinet being on the spot&mdash;it does not
appear that any investigations were made beyond those natural to
a scientific expedition, and certainly no steps were taken by
Baudin to assert possessive rights. Yet there was no part of
Australia as to which the French could have made out stronger
claims on moral grounds; for though the voyage of the first
French navigator who landed in Tasmania was one hundred and
thirty years later than Abel Tasman's discovery, still it was a
solid fact that both Marion-Dufresne and Dentrecasteaux had
contributed more than any other Europeans had done to a knowledge
of what Tasmania was, until Flinders and Bass in their dancing
little 25 ton sloop put an end to mystery and misconception, and
placed the charming island fairly for what it was on the map of
the world.</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Backhouse Walker, Early Tasmania,
published by the Royal Society of Tasmania, Hobart 1902.)</p>
<p>Baudin's ships rounded South-East Cape on January 13 (1802),
and sailed up Dentrecasteaux Channel into Port Cygnet.
P&eacute;ron found plenty to interest him in the fauna of this
strange land, and above all in the aboriginals with whom he was
able to come in contact. His chapters on the three months' stay
in southern and eastern Tasmania are full of pleasant passages,
for the naturalist had a pretty talent for descriptive writing,
was pleased with the novel things he saw, and communicated his
pleasure to his pages. Though he lacked the large grasp, the
fertile suggestiveness, of great scientific travellers like
Humboldt, Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace, he was curious, well
informed, industrious, and sympathetic; and as he was the first
trained anthropologist to enter into personal relations with the
Tasmanian blacks&mdash;a race now become extinct under the
shrivelling touch of European civilisation&mdash;his writings
concerning them have great value, quite apart from the pleasure
with which they may be read. A couple of pages describing
P&eacute;ron's first meeting with the aboriginals when out
looking for water, and the amazement of the savages on
encountering the whites&mdash;an incident given with delightful
humour, and at the same time showing close and careful
observation&mdash;will be likely to be welcomed by the
reader.</p>
<p>"In pursuing our route we came to a little cove, at the bottom
of which appeared a pretty valley, which seemed to offer the
prospect of finding sweet water. That consideration decided M. H.
Freycinet to land there. We had scarcely put foot upon the shore,
when two natives made their appearance upon the peak of a
neighbouring hill. In response to the signs of friendship that we
made to them, one of them leapt, rather than climbed, from the
height of the rock, and was in the midst of us in the twinkling
of an eye. He was a young man of from twenty-two to twenty-four
years of age, of generally strong build, having no other physical
fault than the extreme slenderness of legs and arms that is
characteristic of his race. His face had nothing ferocious or
forbidding about its expression; his eyes were lively and
intelligent, and his manner expressed at once good feeling and
surprise. M. Freycinet having embraced him, I did the same; but
from the air of indifference with which he received this evidence
of our interest, it was easy to perceive that this kind of
reception had no signification for him. What appeared to affect
him more, was the whiteness of our skin. Wishing to assure
himself, doubtless, if our bodies were the same colour all over,
he lifted up successively our waistcoats and our shirts; and his
astonishment manifested itself in loud cries of surprise, and
above all in an extremely rapid stamping of the feet.</p>
<p>"But our boat appeared to interest him even more than our
persons; and after he had examined us for some minutes, he sprang
into it. There, without troubling himself at all about the
sailors whom he found in it, he appeared as if absorbed in his
examination of the novelty. The thickness of the planks, the
curves, the rudder, the oars, the masts, the sails&mdash;all
these he observed with that silent and profound attention which
are the unquestionable signs of a deep interest and a reflective
admiration. just then, one of the boatmen, wishing doubtless to
increase his surprise, handed him a glass bottle filled with the
arack which formed part of the provisions of our search party.
The shining of the glass at first evoked a cry of astonishment
from the savage, who took the bottle and examined it for some
moments. But soon, his curiosity returning to the boat, he threw
the bottle into the sea, without appearing to have any other
intention than that of getting rid of an object to which he was
indifferent; and at once resumed his examination. Neither the
cries of the sailor, who was concerned with the loss of the
bottle of arack, nor the promptness of one of his comrades to
jump into the water to recover it, appeared to concern him. He
made various attempts to push the boat free, but the mooring-rope
which held it fast making his efforts futile, he was constrained
to abandon them, and returned to us, after having given us the
most striking example we had ever had of attention and reflection
among savage peoples."</p>
<p>Presently the companion of the young aboriginal came down the
hill and joined the group. He was an older man, about fifty years
of age, grey-bearded and grey-headed, with a frank and open
countenance. He also was permitted to satisfy himself that the
Frenchmen were white-bodied as well as white-faced; and being
assured that there was nothing to fear from these strange
visitors, he signalled to two black women, who had remained
hidden during the earlier part of the interview. One was a gin of
forty, the second aged about twenty-six; both were naked. The
younger woman carried a black baby girl in a kangaroo skin, and
P&eacute;ron was pleased to observe the affectionate care she
showed for her child. A surprise as great as that which the young
male black had shown concerning the boat, was manifested by the
younger woman in a pair of gloves. The weather being cold, a fire
was lit, when one of the sailors, approaching it to warm himself,
took off a pair of fur gloves which he was wearing. "The young
woman, at the sight of that action, gave forth such a loud cry
that we were at first alarmed; but we were not long in
recognising the cause of her fright. We saw, from her expressions
and gestures, that she had taken the gloves for real hands, or at
least for a kind of living skin, that could be taken off, put in
the pocket, and put on again at will. We laughed much at that
singular error; but we were not so much amused at what the old
man did a little later with a bottle of arack. As it contained a
great part of our drink, we were compelled to take it from him,
which he resented so much that he went off with his family, in
spite of all I could do to detain them longer."</p>
<p>At Bruni Island, P&eacute;ron and a party of his compatriots
had an adventure with a party of twenty native women. He did not
find them charming. All were in the condition in which Actaeon
saw Diana, when "all undrest the shining goddess stood," though
they did not, when discovered, glow with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"such blushes as adorn<br>
The ruddy welkin or the purple morn."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, they appeared to be quite unaware that there was
anything remarkable about their deficiency of clothing. "A naked
Duke of Windlestraw addressing a naked House of Lords" might have
shocked them, but not merely because he was naked. They were
greatly interested when, as a sign of friendliness, one of the
Frenchmen, the doctor of Le Naturaliste, began to sing a song.
The women squatted around, in attitudes "bizarres et
pittoresques," applauding with loud cries. They were not,
however, a group of ladies for whom the Frenchmen had any
admiration to spare. Their black skins smeared with fish oil,
their short, coarse, black hair, and their general form and
features, were repulsive. Two or three young girls of fifteen or
sixteen years of age the naturalist excepted from his generally
ungallant expressions of disgust. They were agreeably formed, and
their expression struck him as being more engaging, soft, and
affectionate, "as if the better qualities of the soul should be,
even amidst hordes of savages, the peculiar appanage of youth,
grace, and beauty." P&eacute;ron remarked that nearly all the
older women were marked with wounds, "sad results of bad
treatment by their ferocious spouses," for the black was wont to
temper affection with discipline, and to emphasise his arguments
with a club.</p>
<p>If the black gins gave no satisfaction to the aesthetic sense
of the naturalist, his white skin appeared to be no less
displeasing to them; and one of them made a kindly effort to
colour him to her fancy. She was one of the younger women, and
had been regarding him with perhaps the thought that he was not
beyond the scope of art, though Nature had offended in making his
tint so pale. Rouge, says Mr. Meredith, is "a form of practical
adoration of the genuine." Charcoal was this lady's substitute
for rouge. A face, to please her, should be black; and, with a
compassionate desire to improve on one of Nature's bad jobs, she
set to work. She approached P&eacute;ron, took up some charred
sticks, rubbed them in her hand, and then made advances to apply
the black powder to his face. He gravely submitted&mdash;in the
sacred cause of science, it may be supposed&mdash;and one of his
colleagues was favoured with similar treatment. "Haply, for I am
black," he might have exclaimed with Othello after the treatment;
and the makers of charcoal complexions were charmed with their
handiwork. "We appeared then to be a great subject of admiration
for these women; they seemed to regard us with a tender
satisfaction," wrote P&eacute;ron; and the reflection occurred to
him "that the white European skin of which our race is so proud
is really a defect, a sort of deformity, which must in these
distant climates give place to the hue of charcoal, dull red
ochre, or clay." Bonaparte would not have concurred; for he, as
Thibaudeau tells us, emphatically told his Council of State, "I
am for the white race because I am a white man myself; that is an
argument quite good enough for me." It was hardly an argument at
all; but it sufficed.</p>
<p>The expedition encountered extremely bad weather along the
eastern coast of Tasmania; where, also, Captain Baudin was too
ill to superintend the navigation in person. He shut himself up
in his cabin, and left the ship to his lieutenant, Henri de
Freycinet. Le Naturaliste was separated from her consort during a
furious gale which raged on March 7 and 8, and the two vessels
did not meet again till both reached Port Jackson. While making
for Bass Strait, Le Geographe fell in with a small vessel engaged
in catching seals, with whose captain the French had some
converse. He told them that the British Government had sent out
special instructions to Port Jackson that, should the French
exploring ships put in there, they were to be received "with all
the regard due to the nature of their mission, and to the dignity
of the nation to which they belonged"*&mdash;surely a noble piece
of courtesy from the Government of a people with whom the French
were then at war. It was this intimation, there can be no doubt,
that a month later determined Baudin to go to Sydney, for Captain
Hamelin of Le Naturaliste was not aware of his intention to do
so, as will appear from the following chapter. Bass Strait was
entered on March 27, and the ship followed the southern coast of
Australia until the meeting with Flinders in Encounter Bay, as
described in the earlier part of this book.</p>
<p class="foot">(* P&eacute;ron, 1824 edition 2 175.)</p>
<p>By this time, as has been related, scurvy was wreaking
frightful havoc among the crew. Before the Encounter Bay incident
occurred, the French sailors had expressed so much disgust with
their putrid meat, weevilly biscuit, and stinking water, that
some of them threw their rations overboard, even in the presence
of the captain, preferring to endure the pangs of hunger rather
than eat such revolting food. After Baudin had made those
investigations which his means permitted in the region of the two
large gulfs, the winter season was again approaching, when high
winds and tempestuous seas might be anticipated. It was therefore
hoped by all on board that when the commandant decided to steer
for the shelter and succour of Port Jackson, he would, as it was
only sensible that he should, take the short route through Bass
Strait. In view of the distressed state of his company, it was
positively cruel to think of doing otherwise. But there was, it
seems, a peculiar vein of perversity in Baudin's character, which
made him prone to do that which everybody wished him not to do.
We may disregard many of the disparaging sentences in which
P&eacute;ron refers to "notre commandant"&mdash;never by
name&mdash;because P&eacute;ron so evidently detested Baudin that
he is a doubtful witness in matters of conduct and character. We
must also give due weight to the fact that we have no statement
of Baudin's point of view on any matter for which he was blamed
by colleagues who were at enmity with him. But even so, we have
his unquestionable actions upon which to form a judgment; and it
is difficult to characterise by any milder term than stupidity
his determination to sail to Port Jackson from Kangaroo Island
round by the south of Tasmania, a route at least six hundred
miles out of his straight path. That he came to this decision
after having himself sailed through Bass Strait from east to
west, and thus learnt that the navigation was free from
difficulty; when he had in his possession the charts of Bass and
Flinders showing a clear course; during a period of storms when
he would be quite certain to encounter worse weather by sailing
farther south; when his crew were positively rotting with the
scorbutic pestilence that made life all but intolerable to them,
and attendance upon them almost too loathsome for endurance by
the ship's surgeon; and when his supplies were at starvation
limit in point of quantity and vermin-riddled in respect of
quality that he resolved to take the long, stormy, southern route
in face of these considerations, seems hardly to admit of
explanation or excuse. "A resolution so singular spread
consternation on board," wrote P&eacute;ron; and it is not
wonderful that it did. The consequence was that the voyage to
Port Jackson made a story of privations pitiful to read. The bare
fact that it took Baudin from May 8 to June 20, forty-three days,
to sail from Kangaroo Island to Sydney, whilst Flinders in the
Investigator, despite contrary winds, covered the distance by the
Bass Strait route in thirty days (April 9 to May 9), including
several days spent at King Island and Port Phillip, is sufficient
to show how much Baudin's obtuse temper contributed to aggravate
the distress of his people.</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron described the weather during the voyage southward
as "frightful."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And now the storm blast came, and he<br>
Was tyrannous and strong:<br>
He struck with his o'er-taking wings,<br>
And chased us south along.</p>
<p>With sloping masts and dipping prow,<br>
As who pursued with yell and blow<br>
Still treads the shadow of his foe,<br>
And forward bends his head,<br>
The ship drove fast, loud roar'd the blast,<br>
And southward aye we fled."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Torrents of very cold rain fell, furious squalls lashed the
sea to a boil, thick fogs obscured the atmosphere; and the ship
had to be worked by men "covered with sores and putrid ulcers,
each day seeing the number of the sick augmented." There was a
short rest in Adventure Bay, Bruni Island, for the purpose of
procuring fresh water on May 20, and when the order to sail again
was given, the crew were so much enfeebled by disease that it
took them four hours to weigh the anchor. On the east coast more
storms came to harass the unfortunate men. A paragraph in
P&eacute;ron's own terms will convey a sufficient sense of the
agony endured on the stricken ship.</p>
<p>"On June 2 and 3 the weather became very bad. Showers of rain
succeeded each other incessantly, and squalls blew with a
violence that we had never experienced before. On the 4th, during
the whole day, the weather was so frightful that, accustomed as
we had become to the fury of tempests, this last made us forget
all that had preceded. Never before had the squalls followed each
other with such rapidity; never had the billows been so
tumultuous. Our ship, smitten by them, at every instant seemed
about to break asunder under the shock of the impact. In the
twinkling of an eye our foremast snapped and fell overboard, and
all the barricading that we had erected to break the force of the
wind was smashed. Even our anchors were lifted from the catheads
despite the strength of the ropes which held them. It was
necessary to make them more secure, and the ten men, who were all
that were left us to work the ship, were engaged in this work
during a great part of the day. During the night the tempest was
prolonged by furious gales. The rain fell in torrents; the sea
rose even higher; and enormous waves swept over our decks. The
black darkness did not permit the simplest work to be done
without extreme difficulty, and the whole of the interior of the
vessel was flooded by sea-water. Four men were compelled to enter
the hospital, leaving only six in a condition to carry out the
orders of the officer on the bridge, and these unfortunates
themselves dropped from sheer exhaustion and fatigue. Between
decks, the sick men lay about, and the air was filled with their
groans. A picture more harrowing never presented itself to the
imagination. The general consternation added to the horror of it.
We had nearly reached the point of being unable to control the
movements of the ship amidst the fury of the waves; parts of the
rigging were broken with every manoeuvre; and despite all our
efforts we could scarcely shift our sails. For a long time our
commandant had had no rest. It was absolutely necessary to get
out of these stormy seas at the extremity of the southern
continent, and hasten on our course for Port Jackson. 'At this
time,' says the commandant in his journal, and the fact was only
too true, 'I had not more than four men in a fit condition to
remain on duty, including the officer in charge.' The ravages of
the scurvy can be estimated from these words. Not a soul among us
was exempt from the disease; even the animals we had on board
were afflicted by it; some, including two rabbits and a monkey,
had died from it."</p>
<p>Slowly, painfully, as though the ship herself were diseased,
like the miserable company on board, the coast was traversed,
until at last, on June 20, Le Geographe stood off Port Jackson
heads. Even then, with the harbour of refuge in sight, the crew
were so paralysed by their affliction that they were positively
unable to work her into port.* But the fact that a ship in
distress was outside the heads was reported to Governor King, who
was expecting Le Geographe to arrive, and who had doubtless
learnt that there was scurvy aboard from Flinders, whose quick
eye would not have failed to perceive some trace of the sad state
of affairs when he boarded the vessel in Encounter Bay.
Accordingly King sent out a boat's crew of robust blue-jackets
from the Investigator; and P&eacute;ron records with what
trembling joy the afflicted Frenchmen saw the boat approaching on
that June morning. Soon the British tars climbed aboard, sails
were trimmed, the tiller was grasped by a strong hand, a brisk
British officer took charge, and the ship was brought through the
blue waters of Port Jackson, where, in Neutral Bay, her anchor
was dropped.</p>
<p class="foot">(* An astonishing statement indeed, but here are
P&eacute;ron's words: "Depuis plusieurs jours, nous nous
trouvions par le travers du port Jackson sans pouvoir, a cause de
la faiblesse de nos matelots, executer les manoeuvres necessaires
pour y entrer.")</p>
<p>It is not overstating the case to say that Le Geographe was
snatched from utter destruction by the prompt kindness of the
British governor. A slight prolongation of the voyage would have
rendered her as helpless as if peopled by a phantom crew; and she
must have been blown before the wind until dashed to fragments on
the rocks on some uninhabited part of the coast. The extremity of
abject powerlessness had unquestionably been reached when the
wide entrance to Port Jackson could not be negotiated.</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron regarded the dreadful condition of the vessel as
furnishing a great and terrible lesson to navigators. "These
misfortunes," he wrote, "had no other cause than the neglect of
our chief of the most indispensable precautions relative to the
health of the men. He neglected the orders of the Government in
that regard; he neglected the instructions which had been
furnished to him in Europe; he imposed, at all stages of the
voyage, the most horrible privations upon his crew and his sick
people." The naturalist concluded his doleful chapter of horrors
by quoting the words of the British navigator, Vancouver, who was
one of Cook's officers on his third voyage: "It is to the
inestimable progress of naval hygiene that the English owe, in
great part, the high rank that they hold to-day among the
nations." He might also have quoted, had he been aware of it, an
excellent saying of Nelson's: "It is easier for an officer to
keep men healthy than for a physician to cure them."</p>

Le Naturaliste sails for Europe.</p>
<p>Le Naturaliste had been unable to rejoin her consort after the
tempest of March 7 and 8. She being a slow sailer, the risk of
the two vessels parting company was constant, and as there had
already been one separation, before the sojourn at Timor, Baudin
should have appointed a rendezvous. But he had neither taken this
simple precaution, nor had he even intimated to Captain Hamelin
the route that he intended to pursue. When, therefore, the storm
abated, the commander of the second ship neither knew where to
look for Le Geographe, nor had he any certain information to
enable him to follow her.</p>
<p>Before making up his mind as to what he should do, Captain
Hamelin had the good luck to pick up an open boat containing
Boullanger, one of the scientific staff of Le Geographe, a
lieutenant, and eight sailors. They were absent from the ship
when the storm burst, and Baudin had sailed away without them.
His conduct on this occasion had been inexplicable. Boullanger
and his party had gone out in the boat to chart a part of the
coast with more detail than was possible from the deck of the
corvette. But they had not been away more than a quarter of an
hour, according to P&eacute;ron, when Baudin, "without any
apparent reason," bore off the coast. Then came the tempest,
night fell, the following days were too stormy for putting off
another boat to search for the missing men; and in the end,
Baudin left them to their fate. They had no chart or compass,
merely enough food and water to last for a day, and were
abandoned on an uninhabited coast, in an open boat, in bitterly
cold, squally weather, with the rain falling in sheets at
frequent intervals. Here again, British kindness saved the
Frenchmen. Before having the good fortune to perceive the sails
of Le Naturaliste, the starved, drenched, and miserable men had
attracted the attention of a sealing brig, the Snow-Harrington,
from Sydney. Her skipper, Campbell, took them on board, supplied
them with warm food, and offered to convey them to Port Jackson
forthwith. They remained on the Snow-Harrington for the night,
but on the following morning sighted Le Naturaliste, and, after
profusely thanking Captain Campbell for his generosity, soon
picked her up.</p>
<p>Hamelin, having no instructions as to where he should go,
resolved to devote himself to work in Bass Strait. Eight days
were spent in Westernport, the limit of Bass's discoveries in
January 1798; and the name French Island preserves the memory of
their researches there. They found the soil fertile, the
vegetation abundant, the timber plentiful; the port was, they
considered, "one of the most beautiful that it would be possible
to find, and it unites all the advantages which will make it some
day a precious possession."</p>
<p>But the supplies on board Le Naturaliste were becoming
exhausted, and, being still without news of his chief, Hamelin
decided to sail for Port Jackson. He arrived there on April 24.
As far as he knew, however, the war between England and France
still raged. News of the Treaty of Amiens was not received at
Sydney till the middle of June. He was therefore gravely
concerned about the reception that would be accorded him. He had
his passport, which protected him from molestation, but he feared
that the British would "at least refuse him succour," of which he
was desperately in need. Evidently the Snow-Harrington had not
communicated to him the same welcome news as the sealing craft
had given to Baudin, concerning the instructions of King George's
Government.</p>
<p>How different was his welcome from his anticipation! He found
"nothing but sweet peace and gentle visitation." "The English
received him, from the first instant, with that great and cordial
generosity which the perfection of European civilisation can
alone explain, and which it alone can produce. The most
distinguished houses in the colony were thrown open to our
companions, and during the entire length of their sojourn, they
experienced that delicate and affectionate hospitality, which
honours equally those who bestow and those who receive it." So
P&eacute;ron testified; but one cannot transcribe his words
without a reflection on the sort of "European hospitality" that
Matthew Flinders received by way of contrast when he was
compelled to seek, shelter in Mauritius.</p>
<p>Le Naturaliste was lying at anchor when Flinders' arrived with
the Investigator in May. Learning from him of the meeting with Le
Geographe in Encounter Bay in the previous month, and inferring
that Baudin would sail for Mauritius after finishing what he had
to do on the southern coast, Hamelin determined also to make his
way to the French colony. He left Sydney harbour on May 18, with
the intention of rounding the southern extremity of Tasmania, and
striking across the Indian Ocean from that point. But here again
fearful storms were encountered. "The sea was horrible; the winds
blew with fury and in squalls; torrents of rain fell
incessantly"; and, increasing the misfortunes, the westerly winds
were so strong at the time when the ship was endeavouring to turn
westward, that no headway could be made. Hamelin's men were
already on short rations, but even so the supplies would not
suffice for a voyage to Mauritius, unless a fairly rapid passage
could be made. The contrary winds, fogs, and storms of "the
roaring forties" offered no such assurance; and the French
captain, casting a "longing, lingering look behind" at the
comforts and hospitalities of Port Jackson, determined to double
back on his tracks. He re-traversed the east coast of Tasmania,
and entered Port Jackson for the second time on July 3, to find
that his chief and the leading ship of the expedition had been
snugly berthed there during the past fortnight. "And so,"
P&eacute;ron comments, "were united for the second time, and by
the most inconceivable luck, two ships which, owing to the
obstinacy of the commandant, had had no appointed rendezvous, and
were twice forced to navigate independently at two periods of the
voyage when it would have been most advantageous for them to act
in concert."</p>
<p>As the two French vessels lay at Sydney for nearly six months,
during which time the officers and men mingled freely with the
population of the colony, whilst the naturalists and artists
occupied themselves busily with the work of their special
departments, the occurrences have a two-fold interest for one who
wishes to appreciate the significance of Baudin's expedition.
There is, first, the interest arising from the observations of so
intelligent a foreign observer as P&eacute;ron* was, concerning
the British colony within fifteen years after its foundation; and
there is, secondly, the special interest pertaining to the
reception and treatment of the expedition by the governing
authorities, their suspicions as to its motives, and the
consequences which arose therefrom.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Curiously enough, there was another
P&eacute;ron who visited Port Jackson in a French ship in 1796,
and gave an interesting account of it in a book which he
wrote&mdash;Memoires du Capitaine P&eacute;ron, two volumes Paris
1824. But the two men were not related. The nautical Captain
P&eacute;ron was born at Brest in 1769.)</p>
<p>Apart from P&eacute;ron's writings, we have a considerable
body of documentary material, in the form of letters and
despatches, which must be considered. We cannot complain of an
insufficiency of evidence. It covers the transactions with
amplitude; it reveals purposes fully; the story is clear.</p>
<p>What P&eacute;ron saw of the infant settlement filled him with
amazement and admiration. "How could we fail to be surprised at
the state of that interesting and flourishing colony," cried the
naturalist. It was only so recently as January 26, 1788, that
Captain Arthur Phillip had entered the commodious and beautiful
harbour which is not eclipsed by any on the planet. Yet the
French found there plentiful evidences of prosperity and comfort,
and of that adaptable energy which lies at the root of all
British success in colonisation. Master Thorne, in the sixteenth
century, expressed the resolute spirit of that energy in a
phrase: "There is no land uninhabitable, nor sea innavigable";
and in every part of the globe this British spirit has applied
itself to many a land that looked hopeless at first, and has
frequently found it to be one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"whose rich feet are mines of gold,<br>
Whose forehead knocks against the roof of stars."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need hardly concern ourselves with P&eacute;ron's survey of
the administrative system, social factors, education, commerce,
agriculture, fisheries,, finance, and political prospects,
valuable as these are for the student of Australian history. Nor
would it further our purpose to extract at length his views on
the reformative efficacy of the convict system, as to which he
was certainly over sanguine. The benevolent naturalist dealt with
the convicts in the next paragraph but one from that in which he
had described the growing wool trade; and it would almost seem
that observations which he had intended to make relative to sheep
and lambs had by chance strayed amongst the enthusiastic
sentences in which he related how transportation humanised
criminals. "All these unfortunates, lately the refuse and shame
of their country, have become by the most inconceivable of
metamorphoses, laborious cultivators, happy and peaceful
citizens"; "nowhere does one hear of thieves and murderers"; "the
most perfect security prevails throughout the colony";
"redoubtable brigands, who were so long the terror of the
Government of their country, and were repulsed from the breast of
European society, have, under happier influences, cast aside
their anti-social manners"; and so forth. On this subject
P&eacute;ron is by no means a witness whom the sociologist can
trust; though it should not escape notice that the generous
temper in which he described what he saw of the convict system in
operation, and his view of it as a noble experiment in
reformation, indicate his desire to appraise sympathetically the
uses to which the British were putting their magnificent
possessions in the South Seas.</p>
<p>Captain Baudin's impressions of the young colony, contained in
his letter to Jussieu,* are also interesting, and may with
advantage be quoted, as they appear to have escaped the attention
of previous writers. "I could not regard without admiration," he
wrote, "the immense work that the English have done during the
twelve years that they have been established at Port Jackson.
Although it is true that they commenced with large resources
["grands moyens"; but, indeed, they did not!] and incurred great
expenditure, it is nevertheless difficult to conceive how they
have so speedily attained to the state of splendour and comfort
in which they now find themselves. It is true that Nature has
done much for them in the beauty and security of the harbour upon
which their principal establishment is erected; but the nature of
the soil in the vicinity has compelled them to penetrate the
interior of the country to find land suitable for the various
crops which abundantly furnish them with the means of
subsistence, and enable them to supply the wants of the European
vessels which the fisheries and commerce attract to this
port."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 22nd Fructidor, Revolutionary Year
11. (September 9, 1803).)</p>
<p>The French visitors were far more genial in their view of the
affairs of the colony than many British writers have been. It was
concerning this very period that Dr. Lang said that the
population consisted, apart from convicts, "chiefly of those who
sold rum and those who drank it."</p>
<p>The reader must not, however, be hurried away from the subject
of the convict population without the pleasure of an introduction
to a delightful rascal, under sentence for forgery, with whom
P&eacute;ron had an interview. The ironical humour of the passage
will lighten a page; and the plausible character revealed in it
might have escaped from a comedy of Moliere. Morand was his name,
and his crime&mdash;"son seul crime," wrote P&eacute;ron in
italics&mdash;was in having "wished to associate himself with the
Bank of England without having an account there."</p>
<p>Morand shall be permitted to tell, in his own bland, ingenuous
way, how, like a patriot, he tried to achieve financially what
Bonaparte failed to do by military genius; and doubtless in after
years he reflected that if his own efforts brought him to Sydney
Cove, Napoleon's landed him at St. Helena.</p>
<p>"The war," said Morand, "broke out between Great Britain and
France; the forces of the two nations were grappling; but it
appeared to me to be easier to destroy our rival by finance than
by arms. I resolved, therefore, as a good patriot, to undertake
that ruin, and to accomplish it in the very heart of London. If I
had succeeded," he cried with enthusiasm, "France would have held
me in the greatest honour; and instead of being branded as a
brigand, I should have been proclaimed the avenger of my country.
Scarcely had I arrived in England when I commenced my operations;
and at first they succeeded beyond all my hopes. Assisted by an
Irishman not less skilful than myself, and who, like me, was
actuated by a noble patriotism, desiring even more fervently than
I did the downfall of England, I was soon enabled to counterfeit
the notes of the Bank with such perfection that it was even
difficult for us to distinguish those which came from our own
press from the genuine paper. I was at the very point of a
triumph; all my preparations were made for inundating England
with our manufactured notes; nothing was wanting except some
information in regard to numbering them&mdash;when my companion,
whom up till then I had regarded as <i>an honest man</i>,* took
it into his head to steal some of the notes, which were as yet
defective, inasmuch as they lacked a few trifling but
indispensable formalities. He was arrested almost immediately;
and as he had behaved dishonourably towards me, he did not
hesitate to relapse into sin in another aspect. He revealed
everything to the authorities; I was arrested and plunged into
prison with him; all my instruments, all our bank notes, were
seized&mdash;and Great Britain was saved from the ruin which I
had prepared for her!</p>
<p class="foot">(* The italics are P&eacute;ron's.)</p>
<p>"Evident as were the proofs of our project, I did not despair,
thanks to the nature of the criminal laws of England, of escaping
death; but such were the feebleness and fright of my wretched
partner, that I had no doubt of our common downfall if I were
compelled to appear before the tribunals in association with that
cowardly wretch. To obviate the aggravation of my own
misfortunes, which could not have prevented his, I determined to
endeavour to get rid of him; and, as the author of both our
disasters, it was quite right that he should suffer. In a speech
to him that was very pathetic, therefore, I tried to prove to
him, that, our death being inevitable, we had nothing better to
think about than how best to sustain the sadness and ignominy
that had come upon us; and that, death for death, it was better
to fall like men of honour than under the hand of the
executioner. The Irishman was moved, but not yet resolved. I then
made him feel that if his own infamy did not touch him, he ought
at least to spare his children the disgrace of being pointed at
as the offspring of one who had been hanged; and that, if he had
not been able to leave them wealth, he should at least, by an act
of generous devotion, save them from that shame.</p>
<p>"These last reflections inflamed the Irishman with a fine
courage. We managed to procure a strong corrosive acid; I feigned
to take some of it; but he took it really, and died; when,
disembarrassed from that silly rascal, I avoided the gallows
which assuredly awaited me had I been tried with him. I was,
instead, sentenced to transportation to this colony, where I am
condemned to pass the remainder of my days. But the period of my
servitude in prison is now finished; I follow with advantage two
of my early trades, those of goldsmith and clockmaker.* The two
knaves who work for me increase my profits threefold. In a few
years I shall be one of the wealthiest proprietors in the colony;
and I should be one of the happiest if I were not constantly
tormented with regret at having so unfortunately failed in an
honourable enterprise, and at being regarded on that account as a
vile criminal, even by those among you, my compatriots, who
cannot know the noble principles [sic "nobles principes"!] which
actuated my conduct, or who cannot appreciate them."</p>
<p class="foot">(* He was an emancipist; that is, a convict
liberated from prison confinement on probation. His two "knaves"
were also convicts. Transported men could often earn their
liberty by exemplary behaviour. When Flinders went north in the
Investigator, he was allowed to take nine convicts with him as
part of his crew, on the promise that a good report from him
would earn them their liberty; but that experiment was not a
marked success. Morand, as I understand it, escaped the death
penalty because the suicide of his companion prevented his being
tried for conspiracy. The punishment for forgery was
transportation.)</p>
<p>As the good P&eacute;ron does not mention discovering that his
pockets had been picked after his interview with this choice and
humorous rogue, it will be agreed that he escaped from the
interview with singular good fortune.</p>
<p>The naturalist presented a lively picture of the port of
Sydney, which even in those very early days was becoming a place
of consequence. There were ships from the Thames and the Shannon,
brought out to engage in whaling, which was an important industry
then and for many years after; ships from China; ships laden with
coal bound for India and the Cape; ships engaged in the Bass
Strait sealing trade; ships which pursued a profitable but risky
business in contraband with the Spanish South American colonies;
ships fitting out for the North American fur trade; ships
destined for enterprises among the South Sea Islands; and,
lastly, there was the ship of "the intrepid M. Flinders" getting
ready to continue the navigations of that explorer in northern
and north-western Australia. "All this ensemble of great
operations, all these movements of vessels, give to these shores
a character of importance and activity that we did not expect to
meet with in regions so little known in Europe, and our interest
redoubled with our admiration." Above all, one is glad to notice,
P&eacute;ron was interested in the boat in which George Bass had
accomplished that "audacieuse navigation," the discovery of Bass
Strait, in 1797 and 1798. It was, at the date of this visit to
Sydney, preserved in the port with a sort of "religious respect,"
and small souvenirs made out of a portion of its keel were
regarded as precious relics by those who possessed them. Governor
King believed that he could not make a more honourable present to
Baudin than a piece of the wood of the boat enclosed in a silver
frame, upon which he had had engraved a short statement of the
facts of Bass's remarkable exploit.</p>
<p>Throughout the long stay made by Baudin's vessels, the utmost
kindness was shown to the whole company by the British. The
governor himself, and the principal citizens, were hospitable;
the scientists were permitted to go wherever they chose; and
guides were provided for them on their inland excursions; and the
scurvy-tortured sailors were attended by Dr. Thomson, the chief
medical officer of the colony, with "the most touching activity."
In addition to this, Governor King gave the French commandant
unlimited credit to obtain whatever stores he needed, even
supplying him with official requisition forms which he could fill
up at his own pleasure; "and these schedules, without any other
guarantee than the signature of the commandant, were accepted by
all the inhabitants with the most entire confidence." The
generosity of King in this respect was all the greater, in that
the Government stores were for the time being short of
requirements, and the governor had to reduce temporarily the
rations of his own people in order to share with the French. The
settlement was not yet self-supporting, and the delay of supply
ships, through storms or other hindrances, meant "short commons"
for all. At the time of the arrival of the French, the stock of
wheat was very low, because floods on the Hawkesbury had
destroyed a large part of the harvest; and to meet the
requirements of one hundred and seventy extra men taxed the
resources of the administration somewhat severely.</p>
<p>But what King had to offer he gave with a graceful liberality.
"Although you will not find abundant supplies of what are most
acceptable to those coming off so long a voyage, yet I offer you
a sincere welcome," he had written; and, happy as he was to be
able to announce that news of the peace had been received on the
day previous to Baudin's arrival&mdash;no doubt the vessel that
brought the despatch reported to the governor that Le Geographe
was near the heads&mdash;"yet the continuance of the war would
have made no difference in my reception of your ships, and
offering every relief and assistance in my power." Not only
Baudin and P&eacute;ron acknowledged gratefully the fine courtesy
shown by the British, but other members of the expedition also
expressed themselves as thankful for the consideration extended
to them. Bailly the geologist made an excursion to the Hawkesbury
and the mountains, in the interest of his own science, when
boats, oarsmen, guide, interpreter, and everything were furnished
by the Government, "our chief having refused us even the food
necessary for the journey." No more could have been done for a
British expedition.</p>
<p>Baudin obtained permission for his officers to erect their
tents for the making of astronomical observations at the same
place as had been appointed for the tents of Flinders' officers,
one of whom, delegated for this service, was the young John
Franklin. This proximity of men engaged in similar work seems to
have extended friendly feelings amongst them. It was possibly on
occasions of their meeting in this manner that Flinders showed
his charts to Baudin to illustrate what the Investigator had
already done; and it was after an examination of the drawings
that Freycinet made a remark that reflected the regret of a keen
officer for the procrastination that conduced to the failure of
their own expedition in a geographical sense. "Ah, captain," said
Freycinet, "if we had not been kept so long picking up shells and
collecting butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would not have
discovered the south coast before us."* That was a mild statement
of the case. If Baudin had applied himself to his task of
exploration with diligence intelligently directed, he would have
discovered the south coast before Flinders reached Australian
waters. It was at this time, also, that the French officers
learnt of the existence of Port Phillip, and probably obtained a
copy of a chart of it.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Flinders, Voyage 1 190.)</p>
<p>The perfect friendliness prevailing during the whole period of
the stay of the discovery ships was disturbed by only two
incidents, neither of which is of surviving importance. One
consisted of a charge against junior officers of having sold
ashore rum which had been purchased, by permission of the
governor, for use during the voyage. The case was investigated,
the accusations broke down, and apologies were made to the
officers affected. The second incident arose out of a
misunderstanding of the French method of honouring the British
flag on King George's birthday. It was an affair of no
consequence, and a brief explanation soon put matters right. A
British officer deemed the French mode of "dressing" their ships
to be disrespectful, but Baudin was able to show that what was
done was in accordance with the regulations of his country's
navy, which provided that "the place of honour for the flag of a
foreign nation which we intend to distinguish, must be on the
starboard of the main-yard arm." The fact that these two trivial
incidents were the only recorded elements of misunderstanding
during a period of nearly six months, at a time when animosities
between English and French people&mdash;and especially
sailors&mdash;were extraordinarily acute, testifies to the good
manners of the French, the hospitable feeling of the English, and
the pleasant temper of all parties.</p>
<p>Governor King, notwithstanding his benevolent disposition, was
mindful of his responsibilities. Before a French sail was sighted
he had been advised of the fact that Baudin's ships were to visit
Australian waters, and it is quite clear that, in common with
most of his contemporaries, he was very suspicious of Gallic
designs. He was a naval officer himself, and British naval men at
that period were pretty well unanimously of Nelson's opinion,
when he wrote to Hugh Elliot, "I never trust a Corsican or a
Frenchman; I would give the devil ALL the good ones to take the
remainder." The arrival of Flinders in the Investigator on May 9,
and his reports as to the presence of the French on the southern
coast, made the governor wary and watchful; and on May 21 he
wrote to the Duke of Portland suggesting the establishment of a
colony at the newly discovered Port Phillip. "I am more
solicitous respecting forming this settlement from the
probability of the French having it in contemplation to make a
settlement on the north-west coast, which I cannot help thinking
is the principal object of their researches."* The letter
exhibits the suspicion in King's mind, and his alertness to
frustrate any attempt to threaten the interests and security of
the colony under his charge by the planting of a foreign
settlement in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Historical Records of New South Wales. The
north-west coast referred to is, of course, north-west
Tasmania.)</p>
<p>But Captain Baudin was very frank. In his first letter to the
governor, dated June 23, and written on the day after his arrival
in port, he requested permission to remain for some time, "as we
all want a little rest, having been at sea for nine consecutive
months"; and he added the assurance that "I shall at the first
interview it will be your pleasure to grant me, furnish you with
all the information which may be of interest to you, concerning
the expedition which I am making by order of the French
Government."</p>
<p>Baudin kept his promise. He handed over to King his journals,
"in which were contained all his orders from the first idea of
his voyage taking place," and also the whole of the drawings made
on the voyage.* The governor was able to examine these at his
leisure, and that he made use of the opportunity is apparent from
his brief summary of the orders. "His object was, by his orders,
the collection of objects of natural history from this country at
large, and the geography of Van Diemen's Land. The south and
south-west coast, as well as the north and north-west coast, were
his particular objects. It does not appear by his orders that he
was at all instructed to touch here, which I do not think he
intended if not obliged by distress." Evidently he did not, as
was indicated by Hamelin's resolve to go to Mauritius in May.
King had to confess, after a perusal of the papers, that he was
left with merely "general ideas" on the nature of the French
visit to Van Diemen's Land. These, however, he communicated to
Baudin, who "informed me that he knew of no idea that the French
had of settling on any part or side of this continent."** It does
not appear that the governor showed any of the French papers or
charts to Flinders, whose statements in his book indicate that he
had not seen them.</p>
<p class="foot">(* King's letter to Banks, Historical Records of
New South Wales 5 133.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** King's letter to Banks, Historical Records of
New South Wales 5 133.)</p>
<p>The governor, then, commenced his relations with the French
commandant by being doubtful and vigilant; but frequent personal
interviews, and an examination of the whole of the ships' orders,
journals, and charts, convinced him that the suspicions were not
justified, and that there were no designs, about which he need be
concerned, behind the pacific professions of the voyagers. From
this time forth Baudin and King met almost daily; and from the
beginning to the end of the visit the governor had not the
faintest reason for doubting the good faith of his guests. On
July 11 he gave his authority for Baudin to purchase the little
colonial-built Casuarina, with which to explore shallow waters,
thus facilitating the pursuit of the objects of the
expedition.</p>
<p>Baudin's letter of farewell was a worthy acknowledgment of the
benefits he had received. On leaving the colony," he wrote, "I
bequeath to the French nation the duty of offering to you the
thanks which are due to you as governor for all you have done as
well for ourselves as for the success of the expedition; but it
is for me to assure you how valuable your friendship has been and
will ever be to me...It will be a satisfaction for me to
correspond with you from whatever country events may bring me to.
It is, as you know, the only means which men who love and esteem
one another can make use of, and it will be the one of which we
shall reciprocally avail ourselves if, on your part, I have been
able by my conduct to inspire you with the feelings which yours
has inspired me with."* Baudin also wrote a general letter,
addressed to the administrators of the French colonies of
Mauritius and Reunion, setting forth the aids which Governor King
had rendered to his people, and expressing the hope that if at
any time a British ship whose commander carried a copy of the
letter should be compelled to call at either island, it would be
shown that the French were not less hospitable and benevolent.**
Twelve signed copies of this letter*** were given to King, who,
however, does not seem to have given one to Flinders when he
sailed with the Cumberland. It is doubtful whether the possession
of one would have made any difference in General Decaen's
treatment of the English navigator, as he was quite well aware of
the services rendered to Baudin's expedition by the British at
Port Jackson. In fact, it is not known that King made any use of
the document. A copy of it was found among his papers after his
death.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Historical Records 4 1006.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Ibid 4 968.)</p>
<p class="foot">(*** Ibid page 133.)</p>
<p>It was not till after Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste had
sailed away (November 18) that a piece of gossip came to King's
ears that caused him uneasiness. According to the rumour,
Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, of the New South Wales corps, had
stated that one of the French officers had told him that one of
the purposes of the expedition was to fix upon a site for a
settlement in Van Diemen's Land. Paterson did not report this
story to the governor, as it was his obvious duty to do were it
true that he had been so informed. Had he reported it, King could
have confronted Baudin with witnesses before his ships left the
harbour. "I should have required a positive explanation from the
French commodore, and would have taken a vessel up to have
preceded any attempt of that kind they might have in
contemplation."</p>
<p>King sent for Paterson, and questioned him as to what he had
heard. His excuse for not personally communicating the story
which he had allowed to drift to the governor's ears by chance,
was that he thought that what he had heard must have come to
King's knowledge also: a supine and almost flippant explanation
of neglect in a matter which was serious if the allegations were
true. He affirmed also that one of the French officers had
pointed out to him on a chart the very place where they intended
to settle. It was in what is now known as Frederick Henry Bay, in
the south of Tasmania.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Backhouse Walker, Early Tasmania page 15.)</p>
<p>The governor took prompt action. He at once fitted out the
armed schooner Cumberland&mdash;the vessel in which Flinders
afterwards sailed to Mauritius&mdash;and placed her under the
command of Acting-Lieutenant Robbins. She carried a company of
seventeen persons in all, including the Surveyor-General, Charles
Grimes; for Robbins was also instructed to take the schooner on
to Port Phillip after finding the French, and to have a complete
survey made.</p>
<p>Robbins was directed to ascertain where the French ships were;
to hand to Baudin a letter, and to lay formal claim to the whole
of Van Diemen's Land for the British Crown; to erect the British
flag wherever he landed; and to sow seeds in anticipation of the
needs of settlers, whom it was intended to send in the Porpoise
at a later date. It was a bold move, for had Baudin's intentions
been such as he was now suspected of entertaining, the one
hundred and seventy men under his command would surely have had
little difficulty in disposing of the handful whom young Robbins
led.</p>
<p>But no assertion of force was necessary at all, and one can
hardly read the letters and despatches bearing upon the incident
without feeling that the proceedings fairly lent themselves to
the ridicule which the nimble-witted French officers applied to
them. Baudin and his people had not gone to Frederick Henry Bay;
they had not planted the tricolour anywhere in Tasmania; they had
not even called at any port in that island. Instead, they were
discovered quietly charting, catching insects, and collecting
plants at Sea Elephants Bay, on the east of King Island, which,
it will be remembered, they had missed on the former part of
their voyage.</p>
<p>But Acting-Lieutenant Robbins was young, and was surcharged
with a sense of the great responsibility cast upon him. A more
experienced officer, having delivered his message, might have
waited quietly alongside the French until they finished their
work, and then seen them politely "off the premises," so to
speak; in which event Governor King's purpose would have been
fully served and no offence would have been given. But instead of
that, after lying at anchor beside Le Geographe for six days, on
friendly and even convivial terms with the French, Robbins landed
with his army of seventeen stalwarts, fastened the British flag
to a tree over the tents of the naturalists, had a volley fired
by three marines&mdash;he was doing the thing in style&mdash;and,
calling for three cheers, which were lustily given, formally
asserted possession of King Island. There was no need to do
anything of the kind, for the island had been discovered four
years before, and was at this very time occupied by British
people, who used it as the headquarters of the Bass Strait
sealing industry.</p>
<p>Robbins' action, though strictly in accordance with the
instructions given to him on the supposition that the French
would be found in occupation of territory in Tasmania, was, in
the circumstances, tactless to the point of rudeness, though it
caused less indignation than amusement among them. It is to be
noticed that the flag of the Republic had not been erected over
the tents of the visitors, nor anywhere on the island. Otherwise,
we may suppose, Acting-Lieutenant Robbins would have gone a step
further and pulled it down; and what would have happened then we
can but surmise.</p>

<p><b>CAPTAIN NICHOLAS BAUDIN</b><br>
<b>From an engraving</b></p>
</center>
<p>Baudin was on his ship, which was anchored a little way off
the shore, when the "hurrahs" of the assertive seventeen directed
his attention to Robbins' solemn proceedings. In a private letter
to King he described what had happened as a "childish ceremony,"
which had been made more ridiculous "from the manner in which the
flag was placed, the head being downwards, and the attitude not
very majestic. Having occasion to go on shore that day, I saw for
myself what I am telling you. I thought at first it might have
been a flag which had been used to strain water and then hung out
to dry; but seeing an armed man walking about, I was informed of
the ceremony which had taken place that morning."* He asserted
that Petit, one of his artists, had made an amusing caricature of
the ceremony, but that he, Baudin, had torn it up, and directed
that it was not to be repeated.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Baudin to King, Historical Records 5 829.)</p>
<p>The tone of Baudin's letters betrayed more annoyance than his
language actually expressed; but assuming that his professions
were true, it must be admitted that he had reason to feel
offended. He had left Sydney on excellent terms with the
governor, who had not only wished well to his undertaking, but
had assisted in its prosecution by enabling the Casuarina to be
purchased. He now found himself pursued by a youthful and
exuberant officer, presented with a letter which suggested
intentions that he had explicitly disavowed, and the British flag
was virtually flapped in his face in a somewhat unmannerly
fashion. King's letter to him explained the rumour which had led
to the despatch of the Cumberland, and contained the following
passage: "You will easily imagine that if any information of that
kind had reached me before your departure, I should have
requested an explanation; but as I knew nothing of it, and at
present totally disbelieving anything of the kind ever being
thought of, I consider it but proper to give you this
information."</p>
<p>Baudin wrote two letters in reply, one officially, and the
second, by far the more interesting document, a personal and
friendly epistle. In the official answer he said: "The story you
have heard, of which I suspect Mr. Kemp, captain in the New South
Wales corps, to be the author, is without foundation, nor do I
believe that the officers and naturalists who are on board can
have given cause for it by their conversation. But in any case
you may rest well assured that if the French Government had
ordered me to remain some days either in the north or south of
Van Diemen's Land, discovered by Abel Tasman, I would have
stopped there without keeping my intention secret from you."
Baudin's additional statement that, prior to the flag incident,
he had taken care to place in four prominent parts of the island
"proofs sufficient to show the priority of our visit," must,
however, have brought a smile to King's lips, and certainly makes
one wonder what Baudin meant by "priority"; since King Island had
previously been visited by Flinders, had been fully charted, and
was the frequent resort of sealers. As a matter of fact, the
Snow-Harrington, which had succoured Boullanger and his boat crew
of abandoned Frenchmen in the previous March, had, after that
fortunate meeting, stayed at the island ten weeks, when there
were killed the enormous number of six hundred sea-elephants and
four thousand three hundred seals.* Besides, Baudin assured King
that "I intend" that the island "shall continue to bear your
name," forgetful that it would not have had a name already if his
own visit had been "prior" to others.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Backhouse Walker, Early Tasmania page 21.)</p>
<p>The second, unofficial, letter which Baudin wrote to the
governor repeated his positive assurances that the suspicions
concerning his objects were without foundation, but on account of
the personal regard which he entertained for King, he determined
to tell him frankly his opinion regarding the forming of European
settlements and the dispossessing of native peoples. The view
expressed by him bears the impress of the "ideas of '89," ideas
which laid stress on the rights of man and human equality, and
professed for the backward races a special fraternal tenderness.
"To my way of thinking," said the commodore, "I have never been
able to conceive that there was any justice or equity on the part
of Europeans, in seizing, in the name of their governments, a
land for the first time, when it is inhabited by men who have not
always deserved the title of savages, or cannibals, which has
been given to them, while they were but children of nature, and
just as little savages as are actually your Scotch Highlanders*
or our peasants of Brittany, who, if they do not eat their
fellowmen, are nevertheless just as objectionable. From this it
appears to me that it would be infinitely more glorious for your
nation, as for mine, to mould for society the inhabitants of the
respective countries over whom they have rights, instead of
wishing to dispossess those who are so far removed by immediately
seizing the soil which they own and which has given them birth.
These remarks are no doubt impolitic, but at least reasonable
from the facts; and had this principle been generally adopted you
would not have been obliged to form a colony by means of men
branded by the law, and who have become criminals through the
fault of the Government which has neglected and abandoned them to
themselves. It follows, therefore, that not only have you to
reproach yourselves with an injustice in seizing their lands, but
also in transporting on a soil where the crimes and the diseases
of Europeans were unknown, all that could retard the progress of
civilisation, but which has served as a pretext to your
Government. I have no knowledge of the claims which the French
Government may have upon Van Diemen's Land, nor of its designs;
but I think that its title will not be any better grounded than
yours."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Had Baudin been reading about the Sage of
Lichfield? "Well, sir, God made Scotland." "Certainly," replied
Dr. Johnson, "but we must always remember that he made it for
Scotchmen; and comparisons are odious, Mr. Strahan, but God made
Hell." Caledonian Societies, of which there are many in various
parts of the world, will observe with gratitude Baudin's
concession that Highlanders did not eat their fellowmen.)</p>
<p>After this taste of Baudin's reflections, it is really a pity
that we possess so little from his pen. Had he lived to be the
historian of the expedition, his work would have been very
different in character from that of P&eacute;ron; though it is
hardly likely that an elaboration of the views expressed in the
personal letter to King would have been favoured with the imprint
"de l'Imprimerie Imperiale." P&eacute;ron's anthropological
studies among Australian aboriginals led him to conclusions
totally at variance with the nebulous "state of nature" theories
of the time, which pictured the civilised being as a degenerate
from man unspoiled by law, government, and convention. The tests
and measurements of blacks which he made, and compared with those
of French and English people, showed him that even physically the
native was an inferior animal; his observations of ways of life
in the wild Bush taught him that organised society, with all its
restraints, was preferable to the supposed freedom of savagery;
and he deduced the philosophical conclusion that the "state of
nature" was in truth a state of subjection to pitiless forces,
only endurable by beings who felt not the bondage because they
knew of no more ennobled condition.* Baudin carried away from his
visits to the abodes of untutored races no truer notion than came
from his own unsubstantiated sentiments, nourished by no contact
with facts, but imbibed uncritically from the rhetorical
rhapsodists of Rousseau's school. Crabbe summed them up in half a
dozen lines:</p>
<p class="foot">(* A more distinguished man was cured of his
early Rousseauism by an acquaintance with peoples far higher in
the scale of advancement than Australian aboriginals. "Up to
sixteen years of age," said Napoleon in a scrap of conversation
recorded by Roederer, "I would have fought for Rousseau against
all the friends of Voltaire. Now it is the contrary. I have been
especially disgusted with Rousseau since I have seen the East.
Savage man is a dog.")</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  "Tis the savage state<br>
Is only good, and ours sophisticate!<br>
See! the free creatures in their woods and plains,<br>
Where without laws each happy monarch reigns,<br>
King of himself&mdash;while we a number dread,<br>
By slaves commanded and by dunces led."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P&eacute;ron spoke of savage peoples, not with less sympathy
but with a sympathy grounded on knowledge; and he wasted no words
about the "injustice" of occupying lands which the aboriginal
only used in the sense that lands are "used" by rabbits and
dingoes. P&eacute;ron's appreciation of well-observed facts gave
him some political insight in the philosophical sense, and he
comprehended the development of which the country was capable.
Could Baudin's shade visit to-day the shores that he traversed
more than a century ago, he would surely acknowledge that
orchards of ripening fruit, miles of golden grain, millions of
white fleeces, the cattle of a thousand hills, great cities
throbbing with immense energies, and a commerce of ever
augmenting vastness, ministering to the happiness of free and
prosperous populations, are, in the large ledger of humanity, an
abundant compensation for the disappearance of the few companies
of naked savages whom, when civilisation once invaded their
ancestral haunts, neither the agencies of government nor
philanthropy could save from the processes of decay.</p>
<p>The account given by P&eacute;ron of the flag-raising incident
was quite accurate, but he presented his readers with a wholly
untrue version of Governor King's letter to Baudin. With the
document before us, we must doubt whether P&eacute;ron ever saw
it. The passage printed by him in quotation marks bears hardly a
resemblance to the courteous terms of the actual letter, which
did not contain any such threat as that "all these countries form
an integral part of the British Empire," and "it will be my duty
to oppose by every means in my power the execution of the design
you are supposed to have in view." It seems probable that
P&eacute;ron heard the letter read, or its contents summarised,
but, in writing, mixed up the substance of it with blustering
language which may have been used by Acting-Lieutenant Robbins.*
At all events, King used no word of menace, while conveying
plainly that the establishment of a French settlement would
require "explanation."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Backhouse Walker also held this view. Early
Tasmania page 18.)</p>
<p>There is no good reason for disbelieving Baudin's disclaimer.
It was plain and candid; and there was nothing in his actions
while he was in Australian waters which belied his words. The
baseless character of the gossip promulgated by
Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, and the alleged exhibition of the
map indicating the exact spot where the French intended to settle
in Frederick Henry Bay, were disposed of by the fact that
Baudin's ships went nowhere near that place after leaving Sydney.
If any French officer did show Paterson a chart, he must have
been amusing himself by playing on the suspicions of the
Englishman, who was probably "fishing" for information. Baudin's
conduct, and that of his officers, never suggested that search
for a site for settlement was part of the mission of the
expedition; and, in the face of the commodore's emphatic denials,
positive evidence, or a strong chain of facts to the contrary,
would have to be forthcoming before such a story could be
entertained. Suspicions were natural enough in face of the
strained feelings, the wars, the plots and counter-plots of
diplomacy, Napoleon's menaced invasion of England, and all the
other factors that made for racial animosity at the beginning of
the nineteenth century; but viewing the circumstances in the
perspective made by the lapse of a hundred years, cool judgment
must dismiss the jealous alarms of 1802 as being unfounded.</p>
<p>Yet a patriotic Frenchman, as P&eacute;ron was, could not
witness this remarkable growth of a new offshoot of British power
in the South Seas without regret and misgiving. "Doubtless," he
commented on Robbins' action, "that ceremony will appear silly to
people who know little about English polity; but for the
statesman such formalities assume a much more serious and
important character. By these public and repeated declarations
England seems every day to fortify her pretensions, to establish
her rights, in a positive manner, and to devise pretexts to
repulse, even by force of arms, all other peoples who may wish to
form settlements in these distant countries." We shall not honour
P&eacute;ron the less because he expressed an opinion so natural
to a man solicitous for his country's prestige.</p>
<p>It has been stated by one or two writers that the action of
Robbins put an end to the cordial relations which had previously
existed between him and the French. But that is an error. They
had cause to be offended, but the young man was treated with
indulgence. P&eacute;ron records that both Grimes and Robbins
visited the tents of the French after the flag incident, and
shared their frugal dinner; and Baudin informed King that, the
Cumberland having lost an anchor, his forge was at work for a
whole day supplying the wants of the British schooner&mdash;a
service akin to heaping coals of fire on the head of the zealous
acting-lieutenant. At the same time, other members of the French
expedition experienced very kind treatment from British
fishermen. Faure, one of the scientific staff, was sent in a
small boat to complete a chart of the island. A violent storm
compelled him to go ashore on the western end, where he and his
sailors were for three days most hospitably entertained by
sealers, who, on their departure, forced upon them some of their
finest furs as presents. "How is it," comments P&eacute;ron,
"that such touching hospitality, of which voyages offer so many
examples, is nearly always exercised by men whose poverty and
roughness of character seem to impose such an obligation least
upon them. It seems that misfortune, rather than philosophy and
brilliant education, develops in mankind that noble and
disinterested virtue which induces us to minister to the woes of
others."</p>
<p>Le Naturaliste sailed for Europe from King Island on December
8, carrying with her all the plants and natural history specimens
collected up to date, as well as the charts. The collections
were, as King wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, "immense."* Le Geographe
and the Casuarina left on December 27, and sailed direct for
Kangaroo Island, to resume in that neighbourhood the charting
which Baudin had abandoned in the previous year. They did not, as
the logs show, make any attempt to examine Port Phillip. Robbins
and his seventeen guardians of British rights on the Cumberland
remained for some time longer making a thorough examination;
after which they sailed for Port Phillip, and Grimes made the
first complete survey of that great sheet of water.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Historical Records 4 844.)</p>
<p>It is only necessary to add that King reported to the
Admiralty his approval of Robbins' action, and that to "make the
French commander acquainted with my intention of settling Van
Diemen's Land was all I sought by this voyage." But it is obvious
from a letter which he wrote to Banks, after Baudin's death, and
after his soul had been moved to righteous wrath by the
iniquitous treatment of Flinders&mdash;whom he so warmly admired
and so loyally aided&mdash;that suspicion, once implanted in
King's mind, was not eradicated by explicit disavowals. Had
Baudin lived another year, he said, "I think it very possible
that the commodore would most likely have visited the colony for
the purpose of annihilating the settlement." But surely here, if
ever, the lines were applicable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the night imagining some fear,<br>
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baudin, after his remarkable exploits in 1800 to 1804, was the
last man whom Napoleon would have chosen to try to annihilate a
British settlement anywhere. Rather, in such an unlikely event,
would his own crew have been in danger of annihilation from his
methods.</p>

Depression of the staff and crew.</p>
<p>Le Geographe sighted Kangaroo Island on January 2, and
anchored on the 6th in Nepean Bay on the eastern side. The
Casuarina joined her consort on the following day.</p>
<p>Freycinet, who was in command of the smaller vessel, was
instructed to make a complete survey of the two gulfs named by
the French after Bonaparte and Josephine, and by Flinders, their
discoverer, after Lord Spencer and Lord St. Vincent, who were
First Lords of the Admiralty when his own expedition was
authorised and when it sailed from England.</p>
<p>The Casuarina was provisioned for twenty-six days for this
task, and Freycinet took with him Boullanger, one of the
hydrographers, who prepared the charts under his supervision. No
part of the French work was better done than was the charting of
the two gulfs and Kangaroo Island, and, as previously indicated,
its quality very naturally aroused the suspicion that the
improvement owed something to the charts of Flinders. It has been
shown, however, that this was not the case. Of Boullanger's
training and qualifications nothing can be said, except that it
may be presumed that the Committee of the Institute of France
which selected him, comprising two such experts as Bougainville
and Fleurieu, must have been satisfied of his attainments. Much
of his work was certainly done under severe trials and
difficulties, but it is chiefly significant that the improvement
in the charting synchronises with the presence in command of
Freycinet; and allusion may again be made to the beautiful work
done by this officer when he commanded the Uranie and the
Physicienne a few years later, as showing his deep interest and
practical skill in employment of this class.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the work would have been better
done throughout had Captain Baudin been a more sympathetic
commander. To what extent the deficiencies of the French charts
of the remainder of the Terre Napoleon coasts are attributable to
his failure to appreciate the requirements of his scientific
staff, can be conjectured; but the peremptory manner in which he
allotted so many days and no more for the survey of the gulfs,
and then sailed off leaving the Casuarina to shift for herself,
reveals an extraordinary temper in a commander on such service,
as well as a fatuous disregard of the many hindrances that made
rigid time conditions difficult to observe.</p>
<p>Flinders had occupied forty days in his exploration of the two
gulfs&mdash;from February 21 to April 1, 1802. Freycinet occupied
only twenty-one days in traversing precisely the same extent of
coast-line&mdash;from January 11 to February 1, 1803. Flinders
had settled the question as to whether there was a passage
through the continent to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and Freycinet
and Baudin were by this time aware that no important discovery of
this character was to be expected. But the navigation was
perilous, the risks were unknown, and Freycinet should have been
able to pursue his task unhampered by the fear that if
circumstances compelled him to over-stay his time for a day or
two, he would be abandoned in a small vessel without provisions
for more than his narrowly prescribed period. "But the character
of our chief was known." "Quite sure of being pitilessly
abandoned in case of delay," Freycinet made haste to return to
Nepean Bay at the end of the month. But when he reached the
anchorage he found that Baudin had already sailed away. "The
abandonment of our companions in the midst of these vast gulfs,
where so many perils might be encountered, had been a subject of
consternation on board Le Geographe," P&eacute;ron records. It
really was unaccountable behaviour; even worse than that of the
abandonment of Boullanger and his boat's crew on the east coast
of Tasmania in the previous March. A commander who treated those
among his subordinates who were sustaining the most dangerous and
exacting part of the work with so little consideration, can
hardly have maintained their confidence, or deserved it.</p>
<p>The Casuarina, making all sail for Nepean Bay westward,
sighted the leading ship in Investigator Strait. But Baudin did
not wait even then. He kept Le Geographe on her course, under a
full head of sail, without permitting the Casuarina to come up
and report, or inquiring after the success of her work. The two
ships soon lost sight of each other. Next day Baudin, evidently
realising the enormity of his folly, veered round, and returned
to Nepean Bay. But as the Casuarina had kept on westward during
the night, in a frantic endeavour to catch her leader, the two
vessels crossed far apart and out of vision. They did not meet
again for fourteen days, when both lay at anchor in King George's
Sound.</p>
<p>It is not wonderful that Freycinet confessed that he was
"astonished" at Baudin's manoeuvres. They were scarcely those of
a rational being, to say nothing of a commander responsible for
the safety of two ships and the lives of their people. The
company on the smaller vessel endured severe privations. They
were reduced to a ration of three ounces of biscuit per man per
day, and to a mere drink of water; and the ship herself sustained
such severe damage from heavy seas that, said Freycinet, had he
been delayed a few hours in reaching King George's Sound, he
would have been compelled to run her ashore to prevent her from
foundering. "Judge of the horror of my position," he wrote, and
he certainly did not exaggerate when he used that term; for the
coast along which he ran for safety is one of the most hopelessly
barren in the whole world, offering to a stranded mariner neither
sustenance, shelter, nor means of deliverance.</p>
<p>The only feature of much interest pertaining to the
geographical work of the expedition in the region of the gulfs,
is the high opinion formed by P&eacute;ron of Port
Lincoln&mdash;called Port Champagny on the Terre Napoleon charts.
The port has not played a large part in the subsequent
development of Australia, but Flinders, who discovered it and
named it after the chief town of his native county, and the
French of Baudin's expedition, who were the second people to
enter it, thought very highly of its beauty and value.
P&eacute;ron spoke of it as a "magnificent port," in which all
the navies of Europe could float, and concluded two pages of
description with the words: "Worthy rival of Port Jackson, Port
Lincoln is, in all respects, one of the finest in the world; and
of all those which we have discovered [yet they had not
discovered a single port of any kind!], whether to the south, the
west, or the north of New Holland, it appears to be, I repeat,
the best adapted to receive a European colony." After many years
of settlement, Port Lincoln boasts of fewer than a thousand
inhabitants; for though the glowing language of admiration
concerning its beauty and convenience written by Flinders and
P&eacute;ron were fully justified, a back country too arid to
support a large population has prevented it from attaining to
great importance among the harbours of Australia. To the student
of the history of exploration, however, Port Lincoln is
interesting even beyond the measure of its beauty; for there, in
1841, Sir John Franklin, then governor of Tasmania, erected at
his own cost a monument to the honour of Flinders, his old
commander, from whom he imbibed that passion for exploration
which was in due time to place his own name imperishably amongst
the glorious company of great English seamen.</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron himself experienced the cross-grained temper of
the commander during the visit of the ships to Sharks Bay. This
was the scene of Dampier's descent upon the Western Australian
coast in 1699, in the rickety little Roebuck. It was here that
his men dined off sharks' flesh, and "took care that no waste
should be made of it, but thought it, as things stood, good
entertainment."* The bay received from Dampier, on account of the
feast, the name it has ever since borne.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Dampier's men were unprejudiced in matters of
gastronomy, but their taste in fish was not to their discredit.
Shark's flesh, especially when young, is, there is reason to
believe, excellent eating. During some weeks in a recent summer,
when what we may term "orthodox" fish was scarce, a fashionable
Australian sea-side hotel was regularly supplied with young
shark&mdash;"gummy"&mdash;by a fisherman, for whose veracity the
author can vouch. Neither proprietor, chef, nor guests knew what
it was, and all were well fed and happy.)</p>
<p>Some of the French sailors who had been ashore returned in a
wild state of alarm on account of giants whom they professed to
have seen&mdash;men of extraordinary strength and stature, they
reported, with long black beards, armed with enormous spears and
shields, who ran at a furious pace, brandishing their weapons and
giving utterance to fearful yells. "However extravagant these
assertions might appear," said the incredulous naturalist, "it
was necessary to collect precise information on the subject." The
scientific Ulysses regarded the reputed Cyclops with a
calculating scepticism. Had Polyphemus been at hand, P&eacute;ron
would have politely requested him to permit himself to be weighed
and measured, and would have written an admirable monograph on
his solitary optic.</p>
<p>There were, he considered, some reasons for thinking that a
race of men of heroic proportions inhabited this western part of
the continent. The Dutch captain, Vlaming, in 1697, had reported
finding gigantic human footprints upon the banks of the Swan
River, near where the city of Perth now stands; and two of
Baudin's officers, whose names were not Munchausen and Sindbad
but Heirisson and Moreau, declared that they also had observed
the same phenomena at the same place. P&eacute;ron set down these
stories to the exaggerative distortion of lovers of the
marvellous, "of whom we counted some amongst us." But when the
sailors came scampering back to the ship with the tale that they
had actually seen the giants and been pursued by them, the
naturalist began to think that there was probably some ground for
the belief. At all events, he determined to go and see for
himself.</p>
<p>He requested Baudin to send a few armed men ashore with him,
but was rudely refused. Not to be thwarted in continuing his
researches in so favourable a place, P&eacute;ron determined to
make use of a couple of days during which a furnace was to be
erected for extracting salt from the sea by evaporation&mdash;the
ship's supply having been depleted&mdash;to run the risk of an
excursion on his own account; whereupon Petit, one of the
artists, and Guichenot, one of the gardeners, resolved to
accompany him.</p>
<p>The adventurous three were soon favoured with a visit from a
troop of aboriginals, who, though by no means giants, were
certainly formidable foes. There were forty of them, all armed
with spears. P&eacute;ron and his companions, to defend
themselves, had only a musket and a pair of pistols. The savages,
terrible fellows, advanced with "clameurs terribles et
menacantes." Retreat for the Frenchmen was impossible. A show of
courage was the best policy; and the three, one of whom, Petit,
had been "plein de terreur" when the blacks first made their
appearance, put on a bold front and marched forward "avec
assurance a leur rencontre." This bold tactical manoeuvre met
with its deserved reward. The savages were visibly disconcerted.
One of them made signs of invitation to a parley, but
P&eacute;ron considered it to be hazardous for one of the three
to isolate himself from his companions. The trio continued to
advance, resolved to sell their lives dearly if die they must.
Such unexpected audacity threw the blacks into a state of
uncertainty, and, after deliberating for a few moments, they
turned their backs and went away, though slowly, and without the
appearance of fear or disorder. P&eacute;ron, Petit, and
Guichenot, "to give the aboriginals a higher idea of our
confidence and our courage," did not halt in their advance, but
marched in the track of the retreating forty, who climbed to the
height of a steep cliff and there continued to yell and
gesticulate as though desiring to have conference with one of the
white men. "After having responded for some time with similar
cries and gestures"&mdash;Ulysses defying Polyphemus will recur
to the mind&mdash;P&eacute;ron and his companions concluded this
signal display of coolness and daring by quietly walking back and
proceeding on their journey inland. They were not pursued nor
further molested.</p>
<p>Cool vision detracted from the gigantic stature of the Sharks
Bay blacks as effectually as a cool demeanour disposed of the
danger from them. The tallest man among them P&eacute;ron
declared to be no more than five feet four or five inches in
height, and most of the forty were small sized, thin-limbed, and
of feeble appearance. It is easy to perceive in this incident,
where a disposition to exaggerate looking through the lens of
fear, magnified a group of slight and slender savages into
terrific giants, how many a legend has come to birth. The
original sons of Anak would probably have been severely shortened
of their inches had a P&eacute;ron been available to bring
illusion promptly to the test of measurement, and perhaps a
scientific Jack the Giant Killer could have done deadly execution
with a foot-rule.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* It may be noted that P&eacute;ron's researches
regarding the physical proportions and capacities of savage races
aroused much interest in France. The Moniteur of April 25 and
June 23, 1808, published two long articles on "the physical force
of savage people," founded upon P&eacute;ron's writings and his
records of comparative dynamometric data.)</p>
<p>The three adventurers suffered far more severely from the heat
of the sun and the fatigues of working among thick bush and sand
than from the natives of the country. They made a fine collection
of specimens, and, congratulating themselves on their success,
endeavoured to make their way back to the boat. But they soon
realised that they were "bushed"&mdash;a term familiar enough to
those who are acquainted with the story of Australian inland
exploration. The country was covered with thick scrub, through
which they endeavoured to make their way. The afternoon sun
poured down a pitiless flood of heat, the white, glaring sand
burnt their feet, the air in the Bush was stifling. It was as
though they were walking through furnaces; and there were no
spreading trees to relieve the ordeal by a touch of shade. They
at length regained the shore, and trudged along the soft, hot
sand; when P&eacute;ron, exhausted after a walk of three hours,
was compelled to throw aside the greater part of the collection
which he had made at the expense of so much painful labour.
Shortly afterwards Guichenot fell to the ground exhausted by
hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and begged his companions to leave
him there to die while they endeavoured to save themselves.
P&eacute;ron remembered a passage he had read in Cook's voyages
about the reviving effect of a plunge in sea-water; and he and
Petit tried it by wading in up to their necks. They assisted
Guichenot to do the same, and revived him sufficiently to enable
him to continue the weary march. The sun set; a breeze sprang up;
and soon the three travellers saw with joy the smoke of a fire
which had been lighted as a guide to them. They staggered on, and
at last all three fell fainting in sight of their companions, who
hurried forward to relieve them.</p>
<p>There is nothing incredible in P&eacute;ron's narrative of the
sufferings of himself and his companions on this excursion. It is
not surprising to one with a knowledge of the local conditions.
The exertions they had made should have earned them commendation,
or at least compassion, from the commandant. But Baudin's view
was censorious. Three times during the evening a gun had been
fired from the ship as a signal to the boat to return. The
officer in charge of the shore party considered that it would be
unjustifiable to leave until the three travellers returned, and
trusted that this explanation would be accepted as excusing the
delay. A sea fog now prevented the boat from returning forthwith;
but the sailors had neither food nor water to give to the parched
and famished unfortunates. When at last they did reach the ship,
they had been for forty hours without sup or sip; they were
prostrate from sheer weakness; and P&eacute;ron himself was
reduced to the extremity that his leathern tongue refused to
articulate. The commandant was the only man aboard who had no
pity to spare for their misery. Baudin actually fined the officer
in charge of the boat ten francs for every gun fired, because he
had not obeyed the return signal, and for not "abandoning all
three." "Those were the very words of our chief," wrote
P&eacute;ron; "and yet I had, to save his life at Timor, given to
his physician part of the small stock of excellent quinine that I
had brought for my own use."</p>
<p>This heartless conduct, taken in conjunction with Baudin's
abandonment of Boullanger on the Tasmanian coast, and his strange
behaviour to the Casuarina after the exploration of the gulfs,
leaves one in no doubt as to his singular deficiency in the
qualities essential to the commander of an expedition of
discovery. It was his invariable practice, we also read, to
provision boats engaged on any special service for the bare time
that he meant them to be absent; so many ounces of food and so
many pints of water per man per day, and no more, leaving no
margin for accidents, allowing of no excuse for unavoidable
delay. A sensible person would not provide for a picnic on such
principles.</p>
<p>The exploration of the west and north-west coasts was
continued till the end of April, when Baudin decided to go once
more to Timor. His intention was, after refreshing his men and
taking in supplies at the Dutch settlement, to spend some time in
the Gulf of Carpentaria and along the southern shores of New
Guinea. On May 6, Kupang harbour was entered for the second time.
There it was learnt that Flinders had called at the port in the
Investigator in April, after having concluded his exploration of
the northern gulf. He had been compelled to relinquish his work
owing to the rotten condition of his ship's timbers, and had
sailed back to Port Jackson. As he had reached the Gulf of
Carpentaria by sailing up the eastern side of the continent, and
returned through Torres Strait down the western coast, and
through Bass Strait on the south, Flinders was the first sailor
to accomplish the circumnavigation of Australia, as he had also
been the first to circumnavigate Tasmania.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Tasman, in 1642, sailed from Batavia, in Java,
thence to Mauritius, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Friendly Islands,
northern New Guinea, and back to Batavia. This was a wide
circumnavigation of the whole of New Holland; but he did not
sight Australia, and as, of course, he did not go near Bass
Strait, he did not circumnavigate the continent proper.)</p>
<p>Le Geographe and the Casuarina remained at Kupang till June
3&mdash;twenty-eight days&mdash;enjoying the hospitality of the
Dutch. P&eacute;ron made several excursions for collecting
purposes, and once shot an alligator nine feet long, which he
skinned. He had the hide and head carried down to the port by
Malays on long bamboo poles, this method of conveyance being
necessitated by the superstitious refusal of the natives to touch
even the skin of the dreaded beast. But the labour was to a large
extent wasted, for putrefaction advanced, while the skin was in
transit, to such an extent that all but the head had to be thrown
into the sea.</p>
<p>Baudin's plan, after leaving Kupang, was to continue the
exploration of the coasts of Western Australia. But very light
breezes, alternating with calms, prevented substantial progress,
and after spending the greater part of the month ineffectually in
traversing only a few leagues, it was concluded (June 28) that to
continue the work in detail from west to east at that season of
the year would merely lead to a futile waste of time. Here again
the logic of facts was required to convince Baudin, who had
previously rejected sound advice that was offered to him, to the
effect that contrary winds would thwart his designs. The winds
blow at certain seasons with steady consistency in these regions,
and an experienced navigator, knowing what he has to expect,
makes his plans accordingly. When Flinders was driven reluctantly
to abandon finishing the exploration of the north coast through
the dangerous condition of the Investigator, he made his way back
to Port Jackson by the western route, because, although it was
considerably longer, he thereby secured favourable winds; and he
reached port in safety. If we may judge from his habitual
perversity, Baudin, under similar circumstances, would have taken
the shorter route, regardless of normal conditions, and would
have lost his ship.</p>
<p>Changing his route after much waste of time, Baudin took his
vessels towards the south-west of New Guinea, with the intention
of making investigations there. But again the sailing was for the
most part slow, especially as the Casuarina made very poor
progress; and when within a few leagues from False
Cape&mdash;called Cape Walshe on the French
charts&mdash;circumstances compelled the commander to review his
position and prospects in a serious light. Once more the supply
of water was running short. The ships carried from Kupang
sufficient for ninety-five days. Apart from the necessities of
the crew, some had to be spared for the plants and
animals&mdash;kangaroos, emus, etc.&mdash;which were being
carried to Europe. Thirty-four days had been dawdled away without
achieving any substantial results. For the ultimate return to
Mauritius sufficient water to last forty days must be conserved.
Consequently Baudin argued that he could not by any possibility
afford to remain in these waters longer than three more weeks;
and as in that time not much could be done, he determined to
return home at once. His decision gave pleasure to his unhappy
people; but surely it was that of a man whose heart was not in
his work. No attempt was made to send parties ashore to search
for fresh water. When Flinders ran short, and did not come across
a convenient spring or stream, he dug and found water, as at Port
Lincoln; and a very experienced traveller has observed that "in
nearly all parts of Australia it is usually found a few feet
beneath the surface of the ground."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Ward, Rambles of an Australian Naturalist page
109.)</p>
<p>But there were other reasons which conduced to create in
Baudin that depression which is inimical to the protracted
pursuit of an allotted task. Sickness once more laid its hand
upon the crews. The commander himself was in bad health. The
demands upon the resources of the doctors were so numerous that
their medicines became exhausted, and they were unable to attend
satisfactorily to the necessities of a constantly increasing
number of ailing men. Bernier, the astronomer, died before the
order to return was given. He was a young man of great
promise&mdash;"savant et laborieux," as P&eacute;ron wrote of
him&mdash;whose original work before he reached full manhood had
attracted the notice of Lalande. Selected by the Institute to
fill a scientific post with the expedition, he did excellent
work, and his death cut short a career that gave indications of
being brilliant and useful. Cape Bernier, on the east coast of
Tasmania&mdash;opposite the southern end of Maria
Island&mdash;preserves his name.</p>
<p>On July 7 the order was given to turn, and sail for Mauritius.
Le Geographe put into Port Louis on August 7, and the Casuarina,
after a very rough voyage, reached the harbour five days
later.</p>
<p>Baudin, whose illness had continued throughout the voyage,
died while his ships lay at Mauritius, on September 16. His death
had been expected for some time before it occurred, and if there
was little surprise at the event, it is pathetic to observe that
there was as little regret. Not a word of sympathy appeared in
the studiously frigid terms in which the decease of the commander
was chronicled in the official history of the voyage. Not a
syllable was used expressing appreciation of any qualities which
he may have possessed, either as an officer or a man. After
curtly mentioning his illness, P&eacute;ron recorded the death
and burial in two sentences sterile of emotion. He showed more
regret when he had to throw away the skin of the alligator which
he shot at Timor, than when mentioning the death of one who had
been his chief for three years. "Finally the last moment arrived;
and on September 16, 1803, at about mid-day, M. Baudin ceased to
exist. On the 17th he was buried with the honours due to the rank
he had occupied in the navy; all the officers and savants of the
expedition assisted at the funeral, which was also attended by
the principal authorities of the colony." That is all. Had it
been P&eacute;ron's manner to record the deaths of the companions
of his voyage with such barren brevity, there would be nothing in
the passage to excite comment. But when a sailor fell overboard
we were told what an excellent and laborious man he was, and how
much he was regretted; the death of Bernier called forth an
appropriate sentence of eulogy; when Depuch, the mineralogist
died, we were properly informed that he was as much esteemed for
his modesty and the goodness of his heart as for the extent and
variety of his knowledge. The contrast between these instances
and the summary plainness of the statement when Baudin's end was
mentioned, cannot escape notice; any more than we can mistake the
meaning of the consistent suppression of his name throughout the
text of the volumes.</p>
<p>Attention has to be directed to this display of animosity
because, in bare justice to Baudin, we have to remember that the
only story of the expedition which we have is that written by
P&eacute;ron and Freycinet, who were plainly at enmity with him.
If the facts were as related by them, Baudin was not only an
absurdly obstinate and ungenial captain, but we are left with
grave doubts as to his competency as a navigator on service of
this description. Yet even facts, when detailed by those who hate
a man, take a different colouring from the same facts set down by
the man himself, with his reasons for what he did. We have no
material for forming an opinion from Baudin's point of view. If
his manuscript journals are capable of throwing fresh light on
the events concerned, their publication, if they remain in
existence, would be welcome. All that at present we can set
against the hard, unsympathetic view of the man as we see him in
the pages written by P&eacute;ron and revised by Freycinet, is
his conduct and correspondence in relation to Governor King at
Port Jackson; and there he appears as a gentleman of agreeable
manners, graceful expression, and ready tact. We do not form a
lower opinion of him in consequence of the letter which he wrote
in reply to the one delivered by Acting-Lieutenant Robbins.
because there he expressed views imbibed as almost a part of the
atmosphere of the Revolution amidst which he had been reared. If
we had only the Baudin-King correspondence, we should think him
not unworthy to be the successor of La Perouse and Bougainville.
If we had only the Voyage de Decouvertes, we should think him
barely fit to command a canal barge. It may not have been the
happiness of many navigators to enjoy the affection of those
under them to such an eminent degree as did Cook and Flinders;
but there are fortunately latitudes of difference between love
and hate. Respect is often felt to be due when deeper sentiments
are not stimulated. The cold chronicle that the honours
appropriate to his rank were paid to Baudin at his funeral seems
very harsh; and one feels that Freycinet, at any rate, whom
Baudin had promoted to the command of the Casuarina, and
furnished with a chance of distinguishing himself, might have
sunk his grievances sufficiently to add a word in praise of at
least some virtue which we may hope that the dead captain
possessed.</p>
<p>Baudin wrote a letter from King Island to Jussieu which
indicated that the experience had been an unhappy one for him.*
"I have never made so painful a voyage," he said. "More than once
my health has been impaired, but if I can terminate the
expedition conformably to the intentions of the Government and to
the satisfaction of the French nation, there will remain little
to desire, and my sufferings will soon be forgotten." To a very
large extent Baudin must be held responsible for the misfortunes
and failures attending his command, but it is an act of justice
to clear him from aspersions that have been made upon him for
things that occurred after his death. He had nothing whatever to
do with the imprisonment of Flinders, for which he has been
blamed by writers who have not looked into the literature of the
subject sufficiently to be aware that he was dead at the time;
nor was he in any way connected with the issue of the Terre
Napoleon maps, with which his name has also been associated.</p>
<p class="foot">(* The letter was printed in the Moniteur, 22nd
Fructidor, Revolutionary Year 11 (September 9, 1803). Baudin's
death was recorded in the Moniteur on 13th Germinal,
Revolutionary Year 12 (April 3, 1804).)</p>
<p>General Decaen, Napoleon's newly appointed governor, arrived
at the island eight days after Le Geographe, and at once began to
administer affairs upon new lines of policy. A little later the
French admiral, Linois, with a fleet of frigates, entered port.
On the death of Baudin, Linois directed that the Casuarina should
be dismantled, and appointed Captain Milius to the command of Le
Geographe, with instructions to take her home as soon as her sick
crew recovered and she had been revictualled. P&eacute;ron, as
has already been explained, had some conversation with Decaen,
imparting to him the conclusion he had formulated relative to the
secret intentions of the British for the augmentation of their
possessions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans; but there is no
record that Decaen saw Baudin, who was probably too ill to attend
to affairs in the period between the general's arrival and his
own death. It is hardly likely that Baudin, who, from his
intimacy with King, knew more about British policy than the
naturalist did, would have supported P&eacute;ron's excited
fancies.</p>
<p>Le Geographe sailed from Mauritius on December 15, and reached
Europe without the occurrence of any further incidents calling
for comment. She entered the port of Lorient on March 24, 1804.
Captain Milius decided not to make for Havre, whence the
expedition had sailed in 1800, in consequence of what had
happened to Le Naturaliste on her return to Europe in the
previous year. War was declared by the British Government against
France in May, and every captain in King George's navy was alert
and eager to get in a blow upon the enemy. The frigate Minerva,
Captain Charles Buller, sighted Le Naturaliste in the Channel,
stopped her, and insisted, despite her passport, on taking her
into Portsmouth. She was detained there from May 27 till June 6,
when the Admiralty, being informed of what had occurred, ordered
her immediate release. She left Portsmouth and arrived at Havre
on the same day, June 6, 1803.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing can convey more effectually the utter
weariness and depression of officers, staff, and crew, than the
language in which Freycinet chronicled the return. It might be
supposed, he wrote, that the end of the voyage would be heralded
with joy. But they were themselves surprised to find that they
were but slightly touched with pleasure at seeing again the
shores of their own country after so long an absence. "It might
be said that the very sight of our ship, recalling too strongly
the sufferings of which we had been the victims, poisoned all our
affections. It was not until we were far away from the coast that
our souls could expand to sentiments of happiness which had been
so long strangers to us."</p>
<p>This, surely, was not the language of men who believed that
they had accomplished things for which the world would hold them
in honour. It was not the language of triumphant discoverers,
whose good fortune it had been to reveal unknown coasts, and to
finish that complete map of the continents which had been so long
a-making. Would it, one wonders, have made Freycinet a little
happier had he known that at this very time the English navigator
who had made the discoveries for which Baudin's expedition was
sent out, was held in the clutch of General Decaen in Mauritius,
and that the way was clear to hurry on the publication of
forestalling maps and records whilst Flinders was, as it were,
battened under hatches?</p>

<p>Startling changes in the political complexion of France had
occurred during the absence of the expedition. Citizen Bonaparte,
who in May 1800 had concurred in the representations of the
Institute that discovery in southern regions would redound to the
glory of the nation, had since given rein to the conception that
the glory of France meant, properly interpreted, his own.* He
meant to found a dynasty, and woe to those whom he regarded as
standing in his way. One of the first pieces of news that those
who landed from Le Geographe at Lorient on the 25th March would
hear, was that just four days before, the Duc d'Enghien, son of
the Duc de Bourbon, had been shot after an official examination
so formal as to be no better than a mockery, for his grave had
actually been dug before the inquiry commenced. When P&eacute;ron
and his companions reached Paris, they would hear and read of
debates among the representatives of the Republic, mostly
favourable to the establishment of a new hereditary Imperial
dignity; and they would be in good time to take an interest in
the plebiscite which, by a majority of nearly fourteen hundred to
one, approved the new constitution and enacted that "Napoleon
Bonaparte, now First Consul of the Republic, is Emperor of the
French." They were, in short, back soon enough to witness the
process&mdash;it may well have suggested to the naturalist a
comparison with phenomena very familiar to him&mdash;by which the
Consular-chrysalis Bonaparte became the Emperor-moth
Napoleon.</p>
<p class="foot">(* It was so from the beginning of his career as
Consul, according to M. Paul Brosses' interpretation of his
character. "Il est deja et sera de plus en plus convaincu que
travailler a sa grandeur, c'est travailler a la grandeur du
pays." Consulat et Empire, 1907 page 27.)</p>
<p>It was, of course, a very busy year for those responsible to
their illustrious master for the administration of departments.
With a great naval war on hand, with plots frequently being
formed or feared, with the wheels and levers of diplomacy to
watch and manipulate, with immense changes in the machinery of
Government going forward, and with the obligation of satisfying
the exacting demands of a chief who was often in a rage, and
always tremendously energetic, the ministers of France were not
likely to have much enthusiasm to spare for maps and charts,
large collections of dead birds, insects, beasts, fishes,
butterflies, and plants, specimens of rocks and quantities of
shells.</p>
<p>It is likely enough that absorption in more insistent affairs
rather than a hostile feeling explains the reluctance of the
French Government to authorise the publication of an official
history of the voyage when such a project was first submitted.
Freycinet and his colleagues learnt "with astonishment" that the
authorities were unfavourable. "It was," he wrote, "as if the
miseries that we had endured, and to which a great number of our
companions had fallen victims, could be regarded as forming a
legitimate ground of reproach against us." It is more reasonable
to suppose that pressure of other business prevented Napoleon's
ministers from devoting much consideration to the subject. Men
who have endured hazards and hardships, and who return home after
a long absence expecting to be welcomed with acclaim, are
disposed to feel snubbed and sore when they find people not
inclined to pay much attention to them. Remembering the banquets
and the plaudits that marked the despatch of the expedition,
those of its members who expected a demonstration may well have
been chilled by the small amount of notice they received. But the
public as well as the official mood was conceivably due rather to
intense concentration upon national affairs, during a period of
amazing transition, than to the prejudice which Freycinet's
ruffled pride suggested. "It would be difficult to explain," he
wrote, "how, during the voyage, there could have been formed
concerning the expedition an opinion so unfavourable, that even
before our return the decision was arrived at not to give any
publicity to our works. The reception that we met with on
arriving in France showed the effects of such an unjust and
painful prejudice."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Preface to the 1824 edition of the Voyage de
Decouvertes.)</p>
<p>When Le Naturaliste arrived at Havre in the previous year, the
Moniteur* gave an account of the very large collection of
specimens that she brought, and spoke cordially of the work; and
in the following month** Napoleon's organ published a long sketch
of the course of the voyage up to the King Island stage, from
particulars contained in despatches and supplied by Hamelin. The
earlier arrival of Le Naturaliste had the effect, also, of taking
the edge off public interest. This may be counted as one of the
causes of the rather frigid reception accorded to Le
Geographe.</p>
<p class="foot">(* 14th Messidor, Revolutionary Year 10. (July 3,
1803).)</p>
<p class="foot">(** 27th Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11.
(August 15).)</p>
<p>The only fact that lends any colour to Freycinet's supposition
of prejudice, is that the Moniteur article of 27th Thermidor
suggested a certain unsatisfactoriness about the charts sent home
by Baudin. His communications clearly led the Government to
believe that he had made important discoveries on the south coast
of Australia, but unfortunately the rough drawings accompanying
his descriptions did not enable official experts to form an
accurate opinion. He mentioned the two large gulfs, but furnished
no chart of them.* The reason for that was, of course, that at
the time when Le Naturaliste left for France Baudin had not
penetrated the gulfs, and could have had no representation of
them to submit. The article also alluded to another chart of part
of the coast in the neighbourhood of Cape Leeuwin, as not
conveying much information.** These statements are useful as
enabling us to understand why Baudin was so shy about showing his
charts to Flinders. If they gave little satisfaction to the
writer of the Moniteur article, we can imagine what a critic who
had been over the ground himself would have thought about
them.</p>
<p class="foot">(* "Cette decouverte [i.e. of the gulfs] du
Capitaine Baudin est tres interessante en ce qu'elle completera
la reconnaissance de la cote sud de la Nouvelle Hollande qui est
due entierement a la France. On ne peut pas encore juger du degre
d'exactitude avec laquelle elle a ete faite, parce que le citoyen
Baudin n'a envoye qu'une partie de la carte qu'il en a dressee,
et que cette carte meme n'est qu'une premiere esquisse. Il y a
jointe une carte qui marque seulement sa route, avec les sondes
le long de toute cette cote, et il promet d'envoyer l'autre
partie de la cote par la premiere occasion qu'il trouvera."
Moniteur, 27th Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** It was "figuree assez grossierement et sans
details.")</p>
<p>These considerations scarcely afford reason for inferring that
the Government had formed a prejudice against the work of the
expedition before making a complete examination of its records,
though it is very probable that dissatisfaction was expressed
about the charts. Hamelin, also, would be fairly certain to
intimate privately what he knew to be the case, that Flinders had
been beforehand with the most important of the discoveries.
Indeed, the Moniteur article expressly mentioned that when Baudin
met Flinders, the latter had "pursued the coast from Cape Leeuwin
to the place of meeting." The information that the English
captain had accomplished so much, despite the fact that he had
left England months after Baudin sailed from France, was not
calculated to give pleasure to Ministers. It was to this feeling
that Sir Joseph Banks referred when, in writing to Flinders, he
said that he had heard that the French Government were not too
well pleased with Baudin's work.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Girard, writing in 1857, stated that rumours
about Baudin's conduct, circulated before the arrival of Le
Geographe, induced the public to believe that the expedition had
been abortive, without useful results, and that it was to the
interest of the Government to forget all about it. F.
P&eacute;ron, page 46. But Girard cites no authority for the
statement, and as he was not born in 1804, he is not himself an
authoritative witness. He merely repeated Freycinet's
assertions.)</p>
<p>The distinguished men of science who stood at the head of the
Institute of France were best qualified to judge of the value of
the work done; and they at least spoke decisively in its praise.
The collections brought home by Le Naturaliste had included one
hundred and eighty cases of minerals and animals, four cases of
dried plants, three large casks of specimens of timber, two boxes
of seeds, and sixty tubs of living plants.* On June 9, 1806, a
Committee of the Institute, consisting of Cuvier, Laplace,
Bougainville, Fleurieu, and Lacepede, furnished a report based
upon an examination of the scientific specimens and the
manuscript of the first volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes,
which, in the meantime, had been written by P&eacute;ron. They
referred in terms of warm eulogy to the industry which had
collected more than one hundred thousand specimens; to the new
species discovered, estimated by the professors at the Musee at
two thousand five hundred; and to the care and skill displayed by
P&eacute;ron in describing and classifying, a piece of work
appealing with especial force to the co-ordinating intelligence
of Cuvier. They directed attention to the observations made by
the naturalist upon the British colony at Port Jackson; and their
language on this subject may be deemed generous in view of the
fact that England and France were then at war. "M. P&eacute;ron,"
reported the savants, "has applied himself particularly to
studying the details of that vast system of colonisation which is
being developed at once upon a great continent, upon innumerable
islands, and upon the wide ocean. His work in that respect should
be of the greatest interest for the philosopher and the
statesman. Never, perhaps, did a subject more interesting and
more curious offer itself to the meditation of either, than the
colony of Botany Bay, so long misunderstood in Europe."** Never,
perhaps, was there a more shining example of the powerful
influence of laws and institutions upon the character of
individuals and peoples. To transform the most redoubtable
highwaymen, the most abandoned thieves of England, into honest
and peaceable citizens; to make laborious husbandmen of them; to
effect the same revolution in the characters of the vilest women;
to force them, by infallible methods, to become honest wives and
excellent mothers of families; to take the young and preserve
them, by the most assiduous care, from the contagion of their
reprobate parents, and so to prepare a generation more virtuous
than that which it succeeds: such is the touching spectacle that
these new English colonies present."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, 14th Messidor, Revolutionary Year 11
(July 3, 1803).)</p>
<p class="foot">(** The colony was not at Botany Bay, though the
mistake was common enough even in England. But the champion error
on that subject was that of Dumas, who, in Les Trois
Mousquetaires, chapter 52&mdash;the period, as "every schoolboy
knows," of Cardinal Richelieu&mdash;represents Milady as
reflecting bitterly on her fate, and fearing that D'Artagnan
would transport her "to some loathsome Botany Bay," a century and
a quarter before Captain Cook discovered it! Dumas, however, was
a law unto himself in such matters.)</p>
<p>The passage may be compared with P&eacute;ron's own
observations on the same subject, given in Chapter 9. A more
erroneous view of the effects of convict colonisation could
hardly have been conveyed; but the paragraph may have been
written to catch the eye of Napoleon, who was a strong believer
in transportation as a remedial punishment for serious crime, and
had spoken in favour of it in the Council of State during the
discussions on the Civil Code.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Thibaudeau, Memoires sur le Consulat,
English edition, translated by G.K. Fortescue, LL.D., London 1908
page 180. Transportation, said Napoleon, "is in accord with
public opinion, and is prescribed by humane considerations. The
need for it is so obvious that we should provide for it at once
in the Civil Code. We have now in our prisons six thousand
persons who are doing nothing, who cost a great deal of money,
and who are always escaping. There are thirty to forty highwaymen
in the south who are ready to surrender to justice on condition
that they are transported. Certainly we ought to settle the
question now, while we have it in our minds. Transportation is
imprisonment, certainly, but in a cell more than thirty feet
square." The highwaymen mentioned by Bonaparte must have been
remarkable persons. It was so like highwaymen to wish to be
arrested! Perhaps there were also birds in the south who were
willing to be caught on condition that salt was put on their
tails.)</p>
<p>In addition to these representations, P&eacute;ron was
accorded an interview with the Minister of Marine, Decres, when,
supported by Fleurieu and other members of the Institute, he
explained what the expedition had done, and exhibited specimens
of his collections and of Lesueur's drawings. Champagny, the
Minister of the Interior, was also induced to listen to the
eloquent pleading of the naturalist. As a result, the Government
resolved to publish; and in 1807 appeared the first volume of the
text, together with a thin folio atlas containing a number of
beautiful drawings and two charts. The books were issued under
the superscription, "par ordre de S.M. L'Empereur et Roi." On
Sunday, January 12, 1808&mdash;"apres la
messe"&mdash;P&eacute;ron, who was accompanied by Lesueur, one of
the artists, had the honour of being admitted to the presence of
the Emperor, and presented him with a copy of the work.* The
naturalist became somewhat of a favourite with the Empress
Josephine, who on several occasions sent a carriage to his
lodgings to take him to Malmaison; and she treated him "as a good
mother would have treated a dear son."** He gave to her a pair of
black swans from Australia, and the Empress generously discharged
debts which he had incurred in acquiring part of his
collection.</p>

</center>
<p>P&eacute;ron died of a throat disease on December 14, 1810,
just seventeen days after the liberated Flinders reached England.
He was buried at Cerilly, where a monument, designed by Lesueur,
marks his grave. At the time of his death he had not quite
finished writing the second volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes.
The conclusion of the work was therefore entrusted to Louis de
Freycinet, who had already been commissioned to produce the atlas
of charts.</p>
<p>Of P&eacute;ron's personal character, and of the value of his
scientific work, nothing but high praise can be written. He was
but a young man when he died. Had he lived, we cannot doubt that
he would have filled an important place among French men of
science, for his diligence was coupled with insight, and his love
of research was as deep as his aptitude for it was keen. A
pleasant picture of the man was penned by Kerandren, who had been
one of the surgeons on the expedition to Australia.
"P&eacute;ron," he said,* "carried upon his face the expression
of kindliness and sensibility. The fervour of his mind, the
vivacity of his character, were tempered by the extreme goodness
of his heart. He made himself useful to most of those who were
the companions of his voyage. There was joined to his confidence
in his own ability, a great modesty. He was so natural&mdash;I
would even say so candid&mdash;that it was impossible to resist
the charm of his manners and his conversation."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Moniteur, January 24, 1811. The Moniteur of
June 7, 1812, also contained a eulogy on P&eacute;ron delivered
before the Societe Medicale d'emulation de Paris, by A.J.B.
Louis.)</p>
<p>Apart from his authorship of the first and part of the second
volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes, P&eacute;ron wrote a number
of short "memoires sur divers sujets," suggested to his mind by
observations made during the voyage. One of the most valuable of
these, from a scientific point of view, was an essay upon the
causes of phosphorescence in the sea, frequently observed in
tropical and subtropical regions, but occasionally in European
waters.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Crabbe described it admirably in The Borough
(9 103):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And now your view upon the ocean turn,<br>
And there the splendour of the waves discern;<br>
Cast but a stone, or strike them with an oar,<br>
And you shall flames within the deep explore;<br>
Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand,<br>
And the cold flames shall flash along your hand;<br>
When, lost in wonder, you shall walk and gaze<br>
On weeds that sparkle and on waves that blaze.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although P&eacute;ron was not the first naturalist to explain
that this aspect of floating fire given to the waves was due to
the presence of multitudes of living organisms, he was the first
naturalist to describe their structure and functional processes.*
His treatise on the Pyrosoma atlanticum is an extremely
interesting example of his scientific work. The creature is
weighed and measured; its appearance is described; then it is
carefully taken to pieces and its structure and internal
organisation are minutely detailed; next there is an account of
its functions, and an explanation of how the phosphorescent
appearance is produced; and finally its mode of life, nutrition,
and system of generation are dealt with. P&eacute;ron collects a
number of specimens, places them in a vessel filled with
sea-water, and observes how, at rhythmic intervals, the creature
alternately contracts and dilates in a fashion analogous to the
art of breathing among more highly organised animals; and he
notices that the phosphorescence appears and disappears with
these movements, being most fully displayed when the creature's
body is most contracted, and disappearing during the moments of
most complete expansion. Here we have careful examination and
observation, study of the organism in its native habitat,
anatomical dissection, and experiment&mdash;a piece of biological
work exceedingly well done. Cuvier would have read the piece with
satisfaction in his pupil.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Phipson on Phosphorescence (1862) page 113,
mentions that as early as 1749 and 1750, Vianetti and Grixellini,
two Venetians, discovered in the waters of the Adriatic
quantities of luminous animalculae; and the true cause of the
phenomena must have occurred to many of those who witnessed it,
though groundless and absurd theories were current. Of the
creature discovered and described by P&eacute;ron, Phipson says
that it is "one of the most curious of animals. It belongs to the
tribe of Tunicata. Each individual resembles a minute cylinder of
glowing phosphorus. Sometimes they are seen adhering together in
such prodigious numbers that the ocean appears as if covered with
an enormous mass of shining phosphorus or molten lava." Professor
Moseley investigated the Pyrosoma while with the Challenger
expedition. He wrote: "A giant Pyrosoma was caught by us in the
deep-sea trawl. It was like a great sac, with its walls of jelly
about an inch in thickness. It was four feet long and ten inches
in diameter. When a Pyrosoma is stimulated by having its surface
touched, the phosphorescent light breaks out just at the spot
stimulated, and then spreads over the surface of the colony to
the surrounding animals. I wrote my name with my finger on the
surface of the giant Pyrosoma as it lay on deck, and my name came
out in a few seconds in letters of fire." The author owes this
last reference to an excellent paper on "Phosphorescence in
Plants and Animals," by Miss Freda Bage, M.Sc., printed in the

on the surface and at measured depths; on the zoology of the
Austral regions; on dysentery in hot countries and the medicinal
use of the betel-nut; on sea animals, such as seals; and on the
art of maintaining live animals in zoological collections, were
valuable; and the subjects on which he wrote are mentioned as
indicating the range of his scientific interests. One of his
pieces of work which, naturally, aroused much interest in Europe,
was an extremely curious investigation relative to the
physiological peculiarities of females of the Bushman tribes in
South Africa, where P&eacute;ron made an inland journey for the
purpose.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* There is a technical note on this delicate
subject in Girard's F. P&eacute;ron, Naturaliste, Voyageur aux
Terres Australes (Paris, 1857); a book which also gives a good
summary of P&eacute;ron's scientific work.)</p>
<p>When he died, P&eacute;ron had not had time to apply himself
adequately to the enormous mass of material that he had
collected. His fertile and curious mind, we cannot doubt, would
have enriched the scientific literature of France with many other
monographs. The deaths at sea of Bernier and Deleuze also
deprived the records of the expedition of contributions which
they would have made on their special lines of research.
Collections of specimens and piles of memoranda, uninformed by
the intelligence of those to whom their meaning is most apparent,
are a barren result.</p>
<p>P&eacute;ron's biological work was done in accordance with the
spirit and principles of Cuvier, who stood at the head of
European savants in his own field. "Trained for four years in
Cuvier's school," wrote the naturalist, "I had for guide not only
his method and his principles, but manuscript instructions that
he had had the goodness to write for me on my departure from
Europe." Cuvier insisted on the importance of structure and
function; "to name well you must know well." The part played by
the creature in its own share of the world, its nervous
organisation, its life as involved in its form, were essentials
upon which he laid stress in his teaching; and he imparted to
those who came under his influence a breadth of view, a feeling
for the unity of nature, that is quite modern, and has governed
all the greatest of his successors. "Not only is each being an
organism, the whole universe is one, but many million times more
complicated; and that which the anatomist does for a single
animal&mdash;for the microcosm&mdash;the naturalist is to do for
the macrocosm, for the universal animal, for the play of this
immense aggregation of partial organisms." Detailed research,
coupled with an outlook on the whole realm of nature&mdash;that
was the essential principle of Cuvier's science; and it is
because we can recognise in P&eacute;ron a man who had profitably
sat at the feet of the great master, that his death before he had
applied his zeal to the material collected with so much labour is
the more deeply to be regretted.</p>
<p>The few paragraphs in which P&eacute;ron expressed his views
regarding the modification of species may be quoted. It has to be
remembered that they were written in the early years of the
nineteenth century, when ideas on this subject were in a state of
uncertainty rather than of transition, and more than half a
century before Darwin gave an entirely new direction to thought
by publishing his great hypothesis. Cuvier at this time believed
in the fixity of species&mdash;constancy in the type with
modification in the form of individuals; but his opinions
underwent some amount of change in the latter part of his career.
The point argued with such gravity, and the conclusion which
P&eacute;ron stresses with the impressiveness of italics, are not
such as a naturalist nowadays would think it worth while to
elaborate, namely, that organisms having a general structural
similarity are modified by climate and environment. It would not
require a voyage to another hemisphere to convince a schoolboy of
that truth nowadays. But the paragraphs have a certain historical
value, for they put what was evidently an important idea to an
accomplished naturalist a century ago. They present us, in that
aspect, with an interesting bit of pre-Darwinian
generalisation.</p>
<p>"Before natural history had acquired a strict and appropriate
language of its own," wrote P&eacute;ron,* "when its methods were
defective and incomplete, travellers and naturalists confused
under one name, in imitation of each other, so to speak, animals
which were essentially different. There is no class of the animal
kingdom which, in the actual state of things, does not include
several orbicular species; that is to say, several species which
are in some degree common to all parts of the globe, however they
may be modified by geographical and climatic conditions. Other
species, although confined to certain latitudes, are, however,
usually regarded as common to all climates, and to all seas
comprised within these latitudes. The existence of these last
animals is regarded as being independent of latitude. To confine
ourselves to marine species, one sees it constantly repeated in
books of the most estimable character, that the great whale
(Balaena mysticetus, Linn.) is found equally amidst the frozen
waters of Spitzbergen and in the Antarctic seas; that the sharks
and seals of various kinds are found in equally innumerable
tribes in seas the farthest apart in the two hemispheres; that
the turtle and the tortoise inhabit indifferently the Atlantic,
the Indian, and the great equinoctial oceans.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Voyage de Decouvertes, 1824 edition 3
243.)</p>
<p>"Were one to consult only reason and analogy, such assertions
would appear to be doubtful, as a matter of experience they are
found to be absolutely false. Let any one glance at the evidence
upon which these pretended identities rest; one will then see
that they exist only in the names, and that there is not a single
WELL-KNOWN animal belonging to the northern hemisphere, which is
not specifically different from all other animals EQUALLY WELL
KNOWN in the opposite hemisphere. I have taken the trouble to
make that difficult comparison in the case of the cetacea, the
seals, etc.; I have examined many histories of voyages; I have
gathered together all the descriptions of animals; and I have
recognised important differences between the most similar of
these supposedly identical species.</p>
<p>"Nobody, I dare say, has collected more animals than I have
done in the southern hemisphere. I have observed and described
them in their own habitat. I have brought several thousands of
kinds to Europe; they are deposited in the Natural History Museum
at Paris. Let any one compare these numerous animals with those
of our hemisphere, and the problem will soon be resolved, not
only in regard to the more perfectly organised species, but even
as to those which are simpler in structure, and which, in that
regard, it would appear, should show less variety in nature...In
all that multitude of animals from the southern hemisphere, one
will observe that there is not one which can be precisely matched
in northern seas; and one will be forced to conclude from such a
reflective examination&mdash;such an elaborate and prolonged
comparison&mdash;as I have been forced to do myself, THAT THERE
IS NOT A SINGLE SPECIES OF WELL-KNOWN ANIMALS WHICH, TRULY
COSMOPOLITE, IS INDISTINGUISHABLY COMMON TO ALL PARTS OF THE
GLOBE.</p>
<p>"More than that&mdash;and it is in this respect above all that
the inexhaustible variety of nature shines forth&mdash;however
imperfect each of these animals may be, each has received its own
distinct features. It is to certain localities that they are
fixed; it is there that they are found to be most numerous,
largest in size and most beautiful; and to the extent that they
are found most distant from the appropriate place, the
individuals degenerate and the species becomes gradually
extinguished."</p>
<p>On the geographical side the series of causes described in
preceding pages prevented the achievement of that measure of
success which the French Government and the Institute had a right
to expect. While Baudin dallied, Flinders snatched the crown of
accomplishment by his own diligent and intelligent application to
the work entrusted to him in the proper field of activity. The
French filled in the map of eastern Tasmania, and contributed
details to the knowledge of the north-west coast of Australia;
but what they did constitutes a poor set-off against what they
failed to do. The chief feature of interest, in an estimation of
the work done, is the publication of the first map of Australia
which represented the whole outline of the continent&mdash;saving
defects&mdash;with any approach to completeness. The Carte
Generale of 1807 showed the world for the first time what the
form of Australia really was, with its south coasts fairly
delimited, and the island of Tasmania set in its proper position
in relation to them. But the circumstances in which this result
was effected were not such as secured any honour to the
expedition, and must, when the facts became known, have been
deeply deplored by instructed French people. Flinders was working
at his own complete map of Australia in his miserable prison at
Mauritius while his splendidly won credit was being filched from
him; and it was merely the misfortune that placed him in the
power of General Decaen that debarred him from issuing what
should have been the first finished outline of the vast island
which he had been the earliest to circumnavigate. Historically
the Carte Generale is interesting, but no honour attaches to
it.</p>
<p>Yet full praise must be given to Louis de Freycinet for the
charts issued by him. He drew them largely from material prepared
by others, and much of that material, as we have seen, was rough
and poor. As a piece of artistic workmanship, the folio of charts
issued by Freycinet in 1812 was a fine performance, and fairly
earned for him the command of the expedition entrusted to him by
the Government of Louis XVIII. Before the volume was published by
the order of Napoleon, it was submitted by the Minister of Marine
to Vice-Admiral Rosily, Director-General du Depot de la Marine.
That officer's report* gave an account of the work which
Freycinet had done not only in the drawing but in regard to the
actual engraving of the charts. "M. Freycinet," said the
Vice-Admiral, "who has done the principal part of this work, was
more capable than any one else known to us of accomplishing such
a result. It is to him that we owe the preparation of this fine
atlas. He has neglected no means of giving to it the last degree
of perfection. He has himself made the drawings of the charts and
plans, and then he has reproduced them upon the copper-plates,
and has engraved the scales of latitude and longitude by a new
method perfected by himself, and which assures the exactitude of
his work. The beauty of the engravings, and the execution of the
work in general, leave nothing to be desired, and testify to the
care that he has devoted to make the collection of charts one of
the most useful of works in promoting the progress of
hydrography."</p>
<p class="foot">(* Printed in the Moniteur, January 15,
1813.)</p>
<p>The praise thus officially bestowed upon Freycinet's work will
be felt to be deserved by any one who studies the atlas of 1812;
but admiration of the workmanship will not commit the careful
student to an equally cordial opinion concerning the completeness
and accuracy of the charts as representations of the coasts
traversed by the expedition. The south coast&mdash;the most
important part, since here the field was entirely fresh&mdash;was
very faulty in outline, and in other parts where Baudin's vessels
had opportunities for doing complete work, important features
were missed. And at the back of it all there looms the shadow of
Matthew Flinders, the merit of whose own work shines out all the
brighter for the contrast.*</p>
<p class="foot">(* A remarkable example of the way to avoid
difficult questions by ignoring them is afforded by Girard's book
on P&eacute;ron, which, throughout its 278 pages, contains no
reference whatever to Flinders. It devotes forty pages to the
voyage, but absolutely suppresses all reference to the Encounter
Bay incident, the imprisonment of Flinders, and other questions
concerning him. Yet Girard's book was "couronne par la Societe
d'emulation de d'Allier." There should have been some "rosemary,
that's for remembrance," in the crown.)</p>

<p>The question of paramount interest connected with the events
considered in the foregoing pages is whether or not the
expedition of 1800 to 1804 had a political purpose. It is hoped
that the examination to which the facts have been subjected has
been sufficient to show that it had not. It was promoted by an
academic organisation of learned men for scientific objects; it
was not an isolated effort, but one of a series made by the
French, which had their counterpart in several expeditions
despatched by the British, for the collection of data and the
solution of problems of importance to science; its equipment and
personnel showed it to be what it professed to be; and the work
it did, open to serious criticism as it is in several aspects,
indicated that purposes within the scope of the Institute of
France, and not those with which diplomacy and politics were
concerned, were kept in view throughout. So much, it is claimed,
has been demonstrated. But the whole case is not exhausted in
what has been written; and in this final chapter will be briefly
set forth a sequence of reasons which go to show that Bonaparte
in 1800 had no thought of founding a new fatherland for the
French in Australasia, or of establishing upon the great southern
continent a rival settlement to that of the British at Port
Jackson.</p>

</center>
<p>It may legitimately be suggested that though all the French
expeditions enumerated in a previous chapter, including Baudin's,
were promoted for purposes of discovery, the rulers of France
were not without hope that profit would spring from them in the
shape of rich territories or fields for French exploitation. It
is, indeed, extremely likely that such was the case. Governments,
being political organisations, are swayed chiefly by political
considerations, or at any rate are largely affected by them. When
Prince Henry the Navigator fitted out the caravels that crept
timidly down the west coast of Africa, penetrating farther and
farther into the unknown, until a new ocean and new realms at
length opened upon the view he was inspired by the ideal of
spreading the Christian religion and of gaining knowledge about
the shape of the world for its own sake; but he was none the less
desirous of securing augmented wealth and dominion for Portugal.*
It was not solely for faith and science that he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   "Heaven inspired,<br>
To love of useful glory roused mankind<br>
And in unbounded commerce mixed the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="foot">(* See Beazley, Henry the Navigator pages 139 to
141; and E.J. Payne, in Cambridge Modern History 1 10 to 15.)</p>
<p>Isabella of Castile did not finance Columbus purely for the
glory of discovery. Luis de Santangel and Alonso de Quintanilla,
who prevailed upon her to befriend the daring Genoese, not only
used the argument that the voyage would present an opportunity of
"spreading her holy religion," but also that it would "replenish
her treasury chests."* It is as natural for the statesman to hope
for political advantage as for the man of science to look for
scientific rewards, the geographer for geographical results, the
merchant for extended scope for commerce, from any enterprise of
the kind in which the State concerns itself. It would have been a
perfectly proper aspiration on the part of French statesmen to
seek for opportunities of development in a region as yet scarcely
touched by European energy. But there is no more reason for
attributing this motive to Bonaparte in 1800, than to the
Ministers of Louis XV and Louis XVI, or to the Government of
France during the Revolution: and that is the point.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Justin Winsor, Christopher Columbus page
178.)</p>
<p>It is to misinterpret the character of the Napoleon Bonaparte
who ruled the Republic in the early period of the Consulate, to
suppose him incapable of wishing to promote research for its own
sake. He desired the glory of his era to depend upon other
achievements than those of war. "My intention certainly is," he
said to Thibaudeau, "to multiply the works of peace. It may be
that in the future I shall be better known by them than by my
victories." The Memoires of the shrewd observer to whom the words
were uttered, give us perhaps a more intimate acquaintance with
the Consular Bonaparte than does any other single book; and it is
impossible to study them without deriving the impression that he
was at this time far more than a great soldier. He was, faults
notwithstanding, a very noble and high-minded man. It was easy
for the savants of the Institute to show him what a fine field
for enterprise there was in the South Seas; and though there is
not a shred of evidence to indicate that, in acquiescing in the
proposition, he yielded to any other impulse than that of
securing for France the glory of discovery, there may yet have
been at the back of his mind, so to speak, the idea that if good
fortune attended the effort, the French nation might profit
otherwise than in repute. To say so much, however, is not to
admit that there is any justification for thinking that the
acquisition of dominion furnished a direct motive for the
expedition. If Bonaparte entertained such a notion he kept it to
himself. There is not a trace of it in his correspondence, or in
the memoirs of those who were intimate with him at this period.
One cannot say what thoughts took shape at the back of a mind
like Napoleon's, nor how far he was looking ahead in anything
that he did. One can only judge from the evidence available. On
some of Flinders' charts there are dotted lines to indicate
coasts which he had not been able to explore fully. He would not
set down as a statement of fact what he had not verified.
History, too, has its dotted lines, where supposition fills up
gaps for which we have no certain information. There is no harm
in them; there is some advantage. But we had better take care
that they remain dotted lines until we can ink them over with
certainty, and not mistake a possibly wrong guess for a fact.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to distinguish between the exalted
motives of which we may think the First Consul capable in 1800,
and for a year or two after, and the use he would have made five,
eight, or ten years later of any opportunities of damaging the
possessions and the prestige of Great Britain. In the full tide
of his passionate hatred against the nation that mocked and
blocked and defied him at every turn of his foreign policy, he
would unquestionably have been delighted to seize any opportunity
of striking a blow at British power anywhere. He kept Decaen at
Mauritius in the hope that events might favour an attempt on
India. He would have used discoveries made in Australasia, as he
would have used Fulton's steamboat in 1807, to injure his enemy,
could he have done so effectually. But to do that involved the
possession of great naval strength, and the services of an
admiral fit to meet upon the high seas that slim, one-armed,
one-eyed man whose energy and genius were equal to a fleet of
frigates to the dogged nation whose hero he was; and in both
these requirements the Emperor was deficient.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can scarcely realise how much Australia owes to
Britain's overwhelming strength upon the blue water at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. But for that, not only
France but other European powers would surely have claimed the
right to establish themselves upon the continent. The proportion
of it which the English occupied at the time was proportionately
no more than a fly-speck upon a window pane. She could not
colonise the whole of it, and the small portion that she was
using was a mere convict settlement. Almost any other place would
have done equally well for such a purpose. It needed some
tremendous exertion of strength to enable her to maintain
exclusive possession of a whole continent, such as Spain had
vainly professed regarding America in the sixteenth century. From
the point of view of Australian "unity, peace, and concord," the
Napoleonic wars were an immense blessing, however great an
infliction they may have been to old Europe. In an age of
European tranquillity, it is pretty certain that foreign
colonisation in Australia would not have been resisted. Great
Britain would not have risked a war with a friendly power
concerning a very distant land, the value and potentialities of
which were far from being immediately obvious. The Englishman,
however, is tremendously assertive when threatened. He will fight
to the last gasp to keep what he really does not want very much,
if only he supposes that his enemy wishes to take a bit of it. It
was in that spirit of pugnacity that he stretched a large
muscular hand over the whole map of Australia, and defied his
foes to touch it. Before the great struggle it would have been
quite possible to think of colonising schemes in the southern
hemisphere without seriously contemplating the danger of
collision with the British. But the end of the Napoleonic wars
left the power and prestige of Great Britain upon the sea
unchallengeable, and her possessions out of Europe were placed
beyond assail. This position was fairly established before
Napoleon could have made any serious attempt to annoy or injure
the English settlement in Australia. Traced back to decisive
causes, the ownership of Australia was determined on October 21,
1805, when the planks of the Victory were reddened with the
life-blood of Nelson.</p>
<p>The remaining points to be considered are the following.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Amiens was negotiated and signed in 1801 and
1802, while Baudin's expedition was at sea. Had Napoleon desired
to secure a slice of Australia for the French, here was his
opportunity to proclaim what he wanted. Had he done so, we can
have no reasonable doubt that he would have found the British
Government compliant. His Majesty's Ministers were in a
concessionary mood. By that treaty Great Britain surrendered all
her maritime conquests of recent wars, except Trinidad and
Ceylon. She gave up the Cape, Demerara, Berbice, Essequibo,
Surinam, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Minorca, and Malta.* She was
eagerly desirous for peace. Bread was dear, and England seethed
with discontent. Napoleon was fully aware that he was in a
position to force concessions. King George's advisers were limp.
"England," wrote Thibaudeau, who knew his master's mind, "was
driven by sheer necessity to make peace; not so Bonaparte, whose
reasons were founded on the desire of the French nation for
peace, the fact that the terms of the treaty were glorious for
France, and the recognition by his bitterest enemy of the
position which the nation had bestowed upon him."** The value of
Australia at this time was scarcely perceived by Great Britain at
all. Sydney was just a tip for human refuse, and a cause of
expense, not of profit or advantage. The only influential man in
England who believed in a future for the country was Sir Joseph
Banks; and he, in 1799, had written to Governor Hunter: "The
situation of Europe is at present so critical, and His Majesty's
Ministers so fully employed in business of the highest
importance, that it is scarce possible to gain a moment's
audience on any subject but those which stand foremost in their
minds, and colonies of all kinds, you may be assured, are now put
in the background...Your colony is a most valuable appendage to
Great Britain, and I flatter myself we shall, before it is long,
see her Ministers made sensible of its real value."*** If that
was the feeling in 1799, we can imagine how a claim to the right
to found a French settlement in Australia during the nerveless
regime of Addington would have been received. It would not have
delayed the signing of the Treaty of Amiens by one hour. England
at that time would not have risked a frigate or spent an ounce of
powder on resisting such a demand. But the subject does not
appear to have been even mentioned during the negotiations.</p>

and Fotheringham, Political History of England 11 9 et seq.)</p>

<p class="foot">(*** Banks to Hunter, February 1, 1799.

<p>Nor was it mentioned by Napoleon during the years of his
captivity at St. Helena. He talked about his projects, his
failures, his successes, with O'Meara, Montholon, Las Cases,
Admiral Malcolm, Antommarchi, Gourgaud, and others. Australia and
the Baudin expedition were never discussed, though Surgeon
O'Meara knew all about Flinders' imprisonment, and mentioned it
incidentally in a footnote to illustrate the hardships brought
upon innocent non-belligerents during the Napoleonic wars.
Indeed, an interesting passage in O'Meara's Napoleon at Saint
Helena* causes a doubt as to whether Napoleon had a clear
recollection of the Flinders case at all. It is true that General
Decaen's aide-de-camp had mentioned it to him in 1804, and that
Banks had written to him on the subject; but he had many larger
matters to occupy him, and possibly gave no more than passing
thought to it. O'Meara records that among Napoleon's visitors at
the rock was an Englishman, Mr. Manning, who was travelling in
France for the benefit of his health in 1805. He had been
arrested, but on writing to Napoleon stating his case, was
released. He mentioned the incident in the course of the
conversation, and expressed his gratitude. "What protection had
you?" asked Napoleon. "Had you a letter from Sir Joseph Banks to
me?" Manning replied that he had no letter from any one, but that
Napoleon had ordered his release without the intervention of any
influential person. The occurrence of Banks's name to Napoleon's
memory in connection with an application for the release of a
traveller may indicate that a reminiscence of the Flinders case
lingered in the mind of the illustrious exile. So much cannot,
however, be stated positively, because Flinders was not the only
prisoner in behalf of whom the President of the Royal Society had
interested himself, though his was the only case which attracted
a very large amount of public attention. But what is chiefly
significant is the absence of any reference to Australia and
Baudin's expedition in the St. Helena conversations, in which the
whole field of Napoleonic policy was traversed with
amplitude.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Edition of 1888, 2 129.)</p>
<p>Had the selection of a site for settlement, rather than
research, been intended, it seems most likely that Napoleon, with
his trained eye for strategic advantages, would have directed
particular if not exclusive attention to be paid to the north
coast of Australia. If he had taken the map in hand and studied
it with a view to obtaining a favourable position, he would
probably have put his finger upon the part of the coast where
Port Darwin is situated, and would have said, "Search carefully
just there: see if a harbour can be discovered which may be used
as a base." The coast was entirely unoccupied; the French might
have established themselves securely before the British knew what
they had done; and had they found and fortified Port Darwin, they
would have captured the third point of a triangle&mdash;the other
two being Mauritius and Pondicherry&mdash;which might have made
them very powerful in the Indian Ocean. And that is precisely
what the East India Company's directors feared that Napoleon
intended. One of them, the Hon. C.F. Greville, wrote to Brown,
the naturalist of the Investigator, "I hope the French ships of
discovery will not station themselves on the north coast of New
Holland";* and the Company, recognising their own interest in the
matter, voted six hundred pounds as a present to the captain,
staff, and crew of the Investigator before she sailed from
England. But instead of what was feared, the French ships devoted
principal attention to the south, where there was original
geographical work to do&mdash;a natural course, their object
being discovery, but not what might have been expected had their
real design been acquisition. P&eacute;ron censured Baudin
because he examined part of the west coast before proceeding to
the unknown south; and when at length Le Geographe did sail
north, the work done there was very perfunctory. Baudin himself
was no fighting man; nor was there with the expedition a military
engineer or any officer capable of reporting upon strategic
situations, or competent to advise as to the establishment of a
fort or a colony. Captain Hamelin and Lieutenant Henri de
Freycinet afterwards saw active service with the Navy, but the
staff knew more about flowers, beetles, butterflies, and rocks
than about fortifications and colonisation.</p>
<p class="foot">(* January 4, 1802. Historical Records of New
South Wales 4 677.)</p>
<p>In recent years research has concentrated powerful rays of
light on the intricacies of Napoleonic policy. Archives have been
thrown open, ransacked, catalogued and codified. Memoirs by the
score, letters by the hundred, have been published. Documents by
the thousand have been studied. A battalion of eager students
have handled this vast mass of material. The piercing minds of
eminent scholars have drilled into it to elucidate problems
incidental to Napoleon's era. But nothing has been brought to
light which indicates that Australia was within the radius of his
designs.</p>
<p>The idea that the publication of the Terre Napoleon maps, with
their unfounded pretensions to discoveries, was a move on
Napoleon's part towards asserting a claim upon territory in
Australia, is surely untenable by any one with any appreciation
of the irony of circumstances.</p>
<p>No man in history had a deeper realisation of the dynamics of
empire than Napoleon had. A nation, as he well knew, holds its
possessions by the power behind its grasp. If he had wanted a
slice of Australia, and had been able to take and hold it, of
what political use to him would have been a few maps, even with
an eagle's picture on one of them? When his unconquerable legions
brought Italy under his sway, absorbed the Low Countries, and
established his dominion on the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube,
he based no claims on maps and documents. He took because he
could. An empire is not like a piece of suburban property, based
on title-deeds drawn by a family solicitor. Its validity is
founded on forces&mdash;the forces of ships, armies, manhood,
treaties, funds, national goodwill, sound government, commercial
enterprise, all the forces that make for solidity, resistance,
permanence. Freycinet's maps would have been of no more use to
Napoleon in getting a footing in Australia than a postage stamp
would be in shifting one of the pyramids. He was capable of many
mean things, but we gravely undervalue his capacity for seeing to
the heart of a problem if we suppose him both mean and silly
enough to conspire to cheat Matthew Flinders out of his well and
hardly won honours, on the supposition that the maps would help
him to assert a claim upon Australia. He could have made good no
such claim in the teeth of British opposition without sea power;
and that he had not.</p>
<p>The consequences of the suspicion that Napoleon intended to
seize a site in Australia, were, however, quite as important as
if he had formally announced his intention of doing so. What men
believe to be true, not what is true, determines their action;
and there was quite enough in the circumstances that occurred to
make Governor King and his superiors in England resolve upon
decisive action. King having communicated his beliefs to
Ministers, Lord Hobart, Secretary of State for War and the
Colonies, in June 1803, wrote a despatch in which he authorised
the colonisation of Van Diemen's Land by the removal of part of
the establishment at Norfolk Island to Port Dalrymple&mdash;"the
advantageous position of which, upon the southern coast of Van
Diemen's Land, and near the entrance of Bass Straits, renders it,
in a political view, particularly necessary that a settlement
should be formed there."* It will be observed that the Secretary
of State's geographical knowledge of the countries under his
regime was quite remarkable. A man who should describe Glasgow as
being on the southern coast of England, near the eastern entrance
of the Channel, would be just about as near the truth as Lord
Hobart managed to get.**</p>
<p class="foot">(* See Backhouse Walker, Early Tasmania page
22.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Froude's amusing story of Lord Palmerston,
when, on forming a Ministry, he thought he would have to take the
Secretaryship of State for the Colonies himself, comes to mind.
He said to Sir Arthur Helps, "Come upstairs with me, Helps; we
will look at the maps, and you shall show me where these places
are." Froude's Oceana page 12.)</p>
<p>King moved immediately. He despatched the Lady Nelson and the
Albion on August 31 to establish a settlement on the river
Derwent, with Lieutenant John Bowen in charge; and in September
1803 the first British colony in Tasmania was planted. It had a
variety of adverse experiences before at length the beautiful
site of the city of Hobart, at the foot of Mount Wellington, was
determined upon; but here, at all events, was a beginning, and
the tale from that time forward has been one of steady
progress.</p>
<p>As soon as the imagined threat of French invasion lost its
impulsion, the colonising energy of the governing authorities
subsided. The Tasmanian settlement remained and grew, but
Trafalgar removed all fear of foreign interference. Hence it was
that nearly forty years elapsed before any real effort was made
to settle the lands within Port Phillip. Then the first energies
that were devoted towards creating the great state of Victoria
were not directed by the Government, which no longer had any
political motive for forcing matters, but were made by
enterprising stock-owners searching for pastures. It was not till
1835 that John Batman pushed up the river Yarra, found the site
of the present city of Melbourne, and said, "This will be the
place for a village!" Trafalgar and the security which it gave to
British possessions oversea made all the difference between the
early occupation of Tasmania for fear the French should take it,
and the leisurely and non-official settlement of the Port Phillip
district, when it was quite certain that no foreign power could
set a foot upon it without British permission.</p>
<p>There was one other occasion when the recurrence of French
exploring ships in Australian waters revived the idea that
foreign settlement on some portion of the continent was
contemplated. just as the appearance of Baudin's expedition at
the commencement of the century expedited the colonisation of
Tasmania, and prompted a tentative occupation of Port Phillip, so
the renewed activity of the French in the South Seas during the
years 1820 to 1826, was the immediate cause of the foundation of
the Swan River Settlement (1829), the nucleus of the present
state of Western Australia. Steps were also taken to form an
establishment at Westernport, where, on the arrival of H.M.S. Fly
with two brigs conveying troops, evidences were found showing
that the French navigators had already paid a call, without,
however, making any movement in the direction of "effective
occupation." The Swan River Settlement grew, but the Westernport
expedition packed up its kit and returned to Sydney when the
alarm subsided.</p>
<p>There is perhaps some warrant for believing that the French
Government, when it sent out Freycinet in the Uranie and the
Physicienne from 1817 to 1820, and the Baron de Bougainville in
the Esperance and the Thetis from 1824 to 1826, desired to
collect information with a possible view to colonise in some part
of Australasia; though the fear that these commanders were
themselves commissioned to "plant" a colony was quite absurd, and
the express exploratory purpose of their voyages was abundantly
justified by results. Lord John Russell, in after years, related
that "during my tenure of the Colonial office, a gentleman
attached to the French Government called upon me. He asked how
much of Australia was claimed as the dominion of Great Britain. I
answered, 'The whole,' and with that answer he went away."* Lord
John Russell was at the head of the Colonial Office in the second
Melbourne Administration, 1839 to 1841, a long time after the
French explorers had gone home and published the histories of
their voyages. But it is still quite possible that the researches
made by Freycinet and the Baron de Bougainville prompted the
inquiry of the Colonial Secretary's visitor. The phrase, "a
gentleman attached to the French Government," is rather vague.
The question was clearly not asked by the French Ambassador, or
it would have been addressed to the Foreign Secretary, who at
that time was Lord Palmerston, and whose reply would certainly
not have fallen short of Lord John's, either in emphasis or
distinctness. It may well be, however, that the Government of
King Louis Philippe&mdash;whose chief advisers during the period
were Thiers (1839 to 1840) and Guizot (from July
1840)&mdash;desired to make their inquiry in a semi-official
manner to avoid causing offence.</p>
<p class="foot">(* Russell's Recollections and Suggestions (1875)
page 203.)</p>
<p>Yet the fact cannot escape notice, that at this particular
time the French were busily laying the foundation of that new
colonial dominion with which they have persevered, with admirable
results, since the collapse of their oversea power during
Napoleon's regime. Though their aptitude for colonisation had
been "unhappily rendered sterile by the faults of their European
policy,"* the more far-seeing among their statesmen and
publicists did not lose sight of the ideal of creating a new
field for the diffusion of French civilisation. They commenced in
1827 that colonising enterprise in Algiers which has converted "a
sombre and redoubtable barbarian coast" into "a twin sister of
the Riviera of Nice, charming as she, upon the other side of the
Mediterranean."**</p>
<p class="foot">(* Fallot, L'Avenir Colonial de la France page
4.)</p>
<p class="foot">(** Hanotaux, L'Energie Francaise (1902) page
284.)</p>
<p>Lord John Russell was not likely to be regardless of this
movement, nor unaware of the strongly marked current of opinion
in France in favour of expansion.</p>
<p>Twenty years later Lord John Russell had the position of
Australia, as a factor in world politics, brought under his
notice again, through a document to which he evidently attached
importance, and which is still the legitimate subject of
historical curiosity. He was then Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs in the second Palmerston Administration (1859 to 1865). A
great change had meanwhile taken place affecting the economic
value of this large island in the South Seas. Apart from the
growth of its commerce and the productive capacity of its great
fertile areas, the gold discoveries of the early
fifties&mdash;the nuggets of Ballarat and the rich auriferous
gravels of wide belts of country&mdash;had turned the eyes of the
world towards the land of whose agricultural and mineral
resources so little had been previously known. France, too, had
passed through a new series of changes in her very mutable modern
history, and a Bonaparte once more occupied the throne, as
Napoleon III.</p>
<p>One day the British Foreign Minister received, from a source
of which we know nothing&mdash;but the Foreign Office in the
Palmerstonian epoch was exceedingly well informed&mdash;a
communication which, having read, he did not deposit among the
official documents at Downing Street, but carefully sealed up and
placed among his own private papers. His biographer, Sir Spencer
Walpole, tells us all that is at present known about this
mysterious piece of writing. "There is still among Lord John's
papers," he says, "a simple document which purports to be a
translation of a series of confidential questions issued by
Napoleon III on the possibility of a French expedition, secretly
collected in different ports, invading, conquering, and holding
Australia. How the paper reached the Foreign Office, what credit
was attached to it, what measures were suggested by it, there is
no evidence to show. This only is certain. Lord John dealt with
it as he occasionally dealt with confidential papers which he did
not think it right to destroy, but which he did not wish to be
known. He enclosed it in an envelope, sealed it with his own
seal, and addressed it to himself. It was so found after his
death."*</p>
<p class="foot">(* Walpole, Life of Lord John Russell 2 177.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the period within which Lord John received the
piece of information which he carefully kept to himself in the
manner described, corresponds with that of the most notorious
effort of Napoleon III to assert his power beyond the confines of
Europe.</p>
<p>In 1853, the year after the establishment of the second
Empire, the Government of Napoleon III had annexed New Caledonia,
commencing on this island the policy of transportation in the
very year in which Great Britain ceased to send convicts to
Australia. Thus for the first time did France secure a footing in
the South. This was a safe step to take, as the annexation was
performed with the concurrence of Great Britain. But Napoleon's
oversea move of nine years later was rash in the extreme.</p>
<p>From 1862 to 1866&mdash;after a joint Anglo-French-Spanish
movement to compel the Republic of Mexico to discharge her debts
to European bondholders, and after a disagreement between the
allies which led to the withdrawal of the British and the
Spaniards&mdash;forty thousand French troops were engaged upon
the quixotic task of disciplining Mexican opinion, suppressing
civil war, and imposing upon the people an unwelcome and absurd
sovereign in the person of Maximilian of Austria. His throne
endured as long as the French battalions remained to support it.
When they withdrew, Maximilian was deposed, court-marshalled, and
shot. The wild folly of the Mexican enterprise, from which France
had nothing to gain, illustrated in an expensive form the
unbalanced judgment and the soaring megalomaniac propensities of
"the man of December." That he should institute such inquiries as
are indicated by the document described by Lord John Russell's
biographer, even though the preservation of friendly relations
with Great Britain was essential to him, was quite in accordance
with the "somewhat crafty" character of the man of whom a
contemporary French historian has said: "He knew how to keep his
own counsel, how to brood over a design, and how to reveal it
suddenly when he felt that his moment had come."* It is a little
singular, however, that Russell did not allude to the mysterious
paper when he wrote his Recollections and Suggestions, five years
after the fall of Napoleon III. There was no imperative need for
secrecy then, and the passage quoted from his book indicates that
the welfare of Australia was under his consideration.</p>
<p class="foot">(* M. Albert Thomas in Cambridge Modern History
11 287.)</p>
<p>The facts set forth in the preceding pages are sufficient to
show that the people of no portion of the British Empire have
greater reason to be grateful for the benefits conferred by the
naval strength maintained by the mother country, during the past
one hundred years, than have those who occupy Australia. Their
country has indeed been, in a special degree, the nursling of sea
power. By naval predominance, and that alone, the way has been
kept clear for the unimpeded development, on British
constitutional lines, of a group of flourishing states forming
"one continent-isle," whose bounds are "the girdling seas
alone."</p>
